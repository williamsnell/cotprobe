Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the polarizability of HBr. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question gives me the dipole moment of HBr as 0.780 D. Dielectric constant is 1.00313 at 273 K and 1 atm. I need to find the polarizability. Wait, I remember that polarizability is related to the dipole moment and some other factors. Oh right, there's the Debye equation or something like that.

So I think the formula connects the dielectric constant (k), the dipole moment (μ), temperature, and the polarizability (α). Or wait, maybe it's the Clausius-Mossotti relation? Yeah, that's right. The Clausius-Mossotti equation relates the dielectric constant to the polarizability of the molecules.

The Clausius-Mossotti equation is: (k - 1)/(k + 2) = (Nα)/(3ε₀) * (something with temperature and pressure maybe?), but wait, wait, no, the equation I remember is (k - 1)/(k + 2) = (n² - 1)/(n² + 2), but that's for refractive index. No, no, another approach.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Debye equation. The Debye formula relates the molar polarization to the dipole moment and the polarizability. Oh wait, molar polarization (Pm) is given by Pm = (4π/3) N_A α, and it's also equal to (ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) * (RT/(P)), where ε_r is the dielectric constant, R is the gas constant, T is temperature, P is pressure.

Wait, let me get this straight. The molar polarization is (ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) * (RT/P). But wait, I think the formula is Pm = ( (ε_r -1 )/(ε_r + 2) ) * (RT)/(P), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and P is pressure.

So once I find Pm, I can find the polarizability α by α = (3 Pm) / (4 π N_A ), where N_A is Avogadro's number.

Wait, let me check: Polarizability α has units of cm³, so I need to make sure the units are correct.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate molar polarization Pm using ( (ε_r -1 )/(ε_r + 2) ) * (RT)/(P).

2. Then, find α = (3 Pm) / (4 π N_A )

Wait, but wait a second. I'm given the dipole moment μ. How does that factor in? Oh wait, maybe I was confusing two different approaches. Because the dipole moment is given, perhaps the polarizability is calculated differently. Hmm.

Wait, I think the other approach is that the molar polarization Pm can also be expressed in terms of the dipole moment μ. The formula is Pm = (N_A μ²)/(3 k_B T), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. But that's for the case of a permanent dipole moment, right? Or wait, perhaps this is the Debye formula for the molar polarization due to permanent dipoles.

Alternatively, polarizability (α) is related to the induced dipole moment, and the dipole moment given here is the permanent dipole. So maybe I'm mixing two different concepts here.

Hmm, maybe I should stick to the Clausius-Mossotti approach. Let me try that.

So, let me first write down the Clausius-Mossotti equation:

(ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) = (n α)/(3 ε_0)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. Also, n is the number density, or maybe molar concentration? Since in some formulations, it's written using the number of molecules per unit volume.

Alternatively, another version of the equation is:

(ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) = (N_A α Pm)/(3 R T)

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me look for the formula.

Wait, the molar polarization Pm is (ε_r -1)/(ε_r + 2) * (RT)/P. Then, the polarizability is (Pm * 4 π)/(3 N_A). Or wait, maybe α is (3 Pm)/(4 π N_A). I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, I've found a formula that says:

α = ( (ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) ) * (3 RT)/(4 π N_A P) ) * (4 π/3) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this systematically.

Let me try to define all the variables:

Given:
- Dipole moment μ = 0.780 D (Debye)
- Dielectric constant ε_r = 1.00313
- Temperature T = 273 K
- Pressure P = 1 atm

I'm to find polarizability α.

I think the key formula here is the Debye equation, which relates the dielectric constant to the dipole moment and the polarizability.

Wait, another approach: the total polarization is the sum of the electronic polarization (from induced dipoles, which is the polarizability) and the orientation polarization (from permanent dipoles). But in this problem, perhaps the dipole moment given is the permanent dipole moment, and the polarizability is the electronic part.

Alternatively, the formula I might use is the Debye-Langevin equation, which is:

μ_eff^2 = μ_0^2 + (3 k_B T α)/N_A

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the dipole moment given is μ_0, and the effective moment includes the polarization. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's what's needed here.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the dielectric constant in terms of the polarizability.

In the Clausius-Mossotti model, the dielectric constant is related to the polarizability as:

ε_r = 1 + (n α)/(ε_0)

But that's in SI units. Wait, no, perhaps I should be more precise.

The Clausius-Mossotti equation is:

(ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) = (n α)/(3 ε_0)

Where n is the number of molecules per unit volume. But in terms of molar concentration, n = N_A * (P)/(R T), since PV = nRT, so n = P/(R T) per mole.

Wait, so substituting n = (P N_A)/(R T), the equation becomes:

(ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) = [ (P N_A α)/(R T) ) ] / (3 ε_0 )

Wait, but ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity, which I think is 8.854 × 10^-12 C²/(N·m²).

Wait, but perhaps I can rearrange this equation to solve for α.

Let me write it again:

(ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) = (n α) / (3 ε_0 )

n = (P N_A)/(R T), so:

(ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) = [ (P N_A α)/(R T) ) ] / (3 ε_0 )

So:

α = [3 ε_0 (ε_r - 1) R T ] / [ (ε_r + 2) P N_A ) ]

Wait, but then the units would need to be considered. Let me make sure all the units are correct. Because the problem gives the answer in cm³, which is a volume, and polarizability is in units of volume.

Wait, polarizability is typically expressed in units of cm³/mol or something? Or per molecule? Hmm, I think polarizability is per molecule, in units of cm³.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The formula I'm using may give molar polarizability, which is per mole, so I'll need to divide by Avogadro's number to get per molecule.

Wait, let me get this right.

In the equation, n is the number density, which is molecules per volume. So n = N/V, where N is the number of molecules.

Wait, the formula for the Clausius-Mossotti equation when expressed in terms of molar quantities is:

(ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) = ( (4 π/3) N_A α ) / (3 ε_0 )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should find a source or formula that directly relates the dielectric constant to the polarizability, considering all the constants.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the molar polarization (Pm) is:

Pm = (ε_r - 1)/(ε_r + 2) * (RT)/(P) [unit: cm³/mol]

And polarizability α is related to Pm by:

α = (Pm * 4 π)/(3 N_A )

So, let's compute Pm first.

Given ε_r = 1.00313, T=273 K, P=1 atm.

Compute (ε_r -1 )/(ε_r +2 ) = (0.00313)/(3.00313) ≈ 0.001042.

Then, RT/P. R is the gas constant. Let me remember the value in appropriate units.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Since T is 273 K and P is 1 atm.

So RT/P = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * 273 K / 1 atm = 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 22.4093 L/mol.

Wait, but wait, units. 0.0821 is in L·atm/(mol·K). So (0.0821 * 273) gives L·atm/(mol) * K? No, wait, 0.0821 * T (in K) gives L·atm per mol. Then divided by P (1 atm) gives L/mol.

So Pm = (0.001042) * (22.4093 L/mol) ≈ 0.02336 L/mol.

Convert to cm³/mol: 1 L = 1000 cm³, so 0.02336 * 1000 = 23.36 cm³/mol.

Now, compute α = (4 π / 3 N_A ) * Pm.

So α = (4 * π / 3 * 6.022e23 mol⁻¹) * 23.36 cm³/mol.

Wait, 4 pi is about 12.566. Dividing by 3 gives roughly 4.189.

So 4.189 * 23.36 ≈ let's compute that.

4 * 23.36=93.44, 0.189 *23.36 ≈4.41, so total ≈97.85 cm³/(mol * ... )?

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it more accurately.

4.189 *23.36:

4 * 23.36 = 93.44
0.189 * 23.36 = approx 4.412
So total is 93.44 + 4.412 = 97.852.

So 97.852 cm³/mol. Wait, but wait, because Pm is in cm³/mol, and α is (4π/3 N_A ) * Pm.

Wait, the calculation is (4 * π / 3) * (1/(6.022e23)) * 23.36 cm³/mol.

Wait, because 23.36 cm³/mol multiplied by (4 pi /3) gives cm³/mol, and dividing by Avogadro's number gives cm³ per molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute.

So:

Pm = 23.36 cm³/mol.

α = (4 π /3) * (Pm) / (N_A )

Plugging in the numbers:

4 * π ≈12.566. 12.566 /3 ≈4.189.

So 4.189 * 23.36 = let's compute 4 *23.36=93.44, 0.189 *23.36≈4.412, so 93.44 +4.412=97.852 cm³/mol.

Divide by Avogadro’s number (6.022e23 /mol):

97.852 cm³/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = approximately (97.852 /6.022e23 ) cm³.

Let me compute that.

97.852 /6.022 is approximately 16.25.

So 16.25e-23 cm³, which is 1.625e-22 cm³.

Wait, that's 1.625 × 10^-22 cm³. Looking at the options, that's not one of them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-23 to 1e-24. So maybe I messed up some unit conversions.

Wait, let me double-check everything. Maybe I made a mistake in the units when computing Pm.

Wait, Pm is (ε_r -1)/(ε_r +2) * (RT/P). R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). T is 273 K, P is 1 atm. So RT/P = 0.0821 * 273 = about 22.409 L/mol.

Then, (ε_r -1)/(ε_r +2 ) is (0.00313)/(3.00313) ≈0.001042.

So Pm = 0.001042 * 22.409 L/mol ≈ 0.02336 L/mol. Convert to cm³: 0.02336 L = 23.36 cm³ (since 1 L = 1000 cm³). So Pm = 23.36 cm³/mol.

Then, α = (Pm * 4 π )/(3 N_A )

Wait, yes. So 4 pi is about 12.566, divided by 3 gives about 4.1888.

Multiply that by Pm (23.36 cm³/mol):

4.1888 *23.36 ≈ 97.85 cm³/mol.

Then divide by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol⁻¹):

97.85 /6.022e23 = approximately 1.625e-22 cm³.

Hmm, but that's 1.625e-22 cm³. But the options are all 1e-23 or lower. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe I should have considered the dipole moment in calculating the polarizability.

Wait, another approach: the polarizability can be related to the dipole moment and the dielectric constant. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is:

α = (μ^2)/(3 k_B T)

But that's for a molecule with a permanent dipole. Wait, but that might give the polarizability due to the dipole, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. The formula for the dielectric constant when there's a permanent dipole is given by the Debye equation:

ε_r = 1 + (N_A μ^2)/(3 ε_0 k_B T)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Debye equation is:

χ = (N_A μ^2)/(3 ε_0 k_B T)

Where χ is the electric susceptibility, which is (ε_r -1).

So, χ = (N_A μ²)/(3 ε_0 k_B T )

So, (ε_r -1) = (N_A μ²)/(3 ε_0 k_B T )

Then, solving for α, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the polarizability α is given by α = (μ²)/(3 k_B T )

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers. Let me compute that.

μ is 0.780 D. Wait, 1 Debye is 3.33564e-30 C·m. So 0.780 D is 0.780 * 3.33564e-30 C·m ≈ 2.602e-30 C·m.

k_B is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

T is 273 K.

So, α = (μ^2) / (3 k_B T )

So μ^2 is (2.602e-30)^2 ≈ 6.775e-60 C²·m².

Then, denominator is 3 * 1.380649e-23 * 273 ≈ 3 * 1.3806e-23 * 2.73e2 = 3 * 3.769e-21 = approx 1.1307e-20.

So α = 6.775e-60 / 1.1307e-20 ≈ 5.99e-40 C²·m²/(J) ?

Wait, but wait, units. Polarizability has units of m³ (since dipole moment is C·m, μ² is C²·m², divided by energy (J), which is kg·m²/s², so overall units would be (C²·m²)/(kg·m²/s²) )= C²·s²/(kg).

But that's not m³. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, actually, polarizability α is defined as the dipole moment p induced by an electric field E: p = α E. Dipole moment has units C·m, E has units V/m = (J/C)/m = (kg·m²/(s³·C)) /m = kg·m/(s³·C). So p = α E implies that α has units C·m²/(kg·m/(s³·C)) )= C²·s³/(kg·m).

Wait, I'm getting stuck on units here. Maybe I should proceed numerically.

So, calculating α as 5.99e-40 C²·m²/(J). Since 1 J = 1 kg·m²/s².

So, α ≈ 5.99e-40 (C²·m²)/(kg·m²/s²) ) = 5.99e-40 C²·s²/(kg).

But I'm not sure if that's useful. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the polarizability to cm³.

Wait, 1 C·m is equivalent to 1 D multiplied by 3.33564e-30 C·m/D.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since I'm not getting the correct units, maybe the formula I used (α=μ²/(3
