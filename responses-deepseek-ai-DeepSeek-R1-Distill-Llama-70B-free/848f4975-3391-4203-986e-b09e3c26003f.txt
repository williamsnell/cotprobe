Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. I.F. Sarbo who bought a fire insurance policy. The question is about calculating his refund after he canceled the policy. Let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the policy was purchased on July 17 with an annual premium of $32. He canceled it on September 22. I need to find out how much he gets back as a refund. Hmm, I think this involves calculating how much of the policy period has passed and then determining the proportional refund.

Wait, insurance policies usually have a term, and if you cancel before the term ends, you get a prorated refund based on the time remaining. So the first thing is to figure out how many days the policy was in effect before cancellation.

The policy started on July 17 and ended on September 22. Let me break this down month by month. July has 31 days. So from July 17 to July 31—that's 31 minus 17, which is 14 days. Then August has 31 days, so that's a full month. And then September: from September 1 to September 22 is 22 days.

So adding that up: 14 (July) + 31 (August) + 22 (September) = 67 days total. Wait, but wait a second. Because the policy was canceled on September 22, so does that day count as part of the coverage? I think so, because the cancellation would take effect on that day, so he's covered up to and including the 22nd. So yes, 22 days in September.

Now, the total policy term is a year, which is 365 days. So the time he used the policy is 67 days. To find the refund, I think we calculate how much of the premium corresponds to the unused portion.

Wait, but some policies might have different refund terms. Like, sometimes they might not refund the entire prorated amount, maybe only a part, or there might be a minimum period. But the question doesn't mention any such conditions, so I think we can assume it's a straightforward prorated refund.

So the annual premium is $32 for 365 days. He used 67 days, so the unused days are 365 - 67 = 298 days.

The refund would be the proportion of the premium corresponding to the unused days. So the calculation would be (unused days / total days) * annual premium.

So that's (298 / 365) * 32. Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, sometimes the refund is calculated as (total days - days used) / total days, then multiplied by the premium. So yes, same thing.

Wait, but I think I might have made an error in calculating the days. Let me double-check that. From July 17 to July 31: that's 14 days because July 17 is day 1, so 31-17=14 days left in July.

Then August has 31 days. Then September 1 to September 22 is 22 days. So 14 +31=45, plus 22 is 67 days total.

So the time he's covered is 67 days, so the unused time is 365-67=298 days.

So the refund is (298/365)*32.

Hmm, let me compute that.

298 divided by 365 equals approximately 0.81575. Then multiply by 32.

0.81575 *32 = Let's see:

0.8 *32=25.6

0.01575 *32= about 0.504

Adding them together: 25.6 + 0.504=26.104.

Wait, but that would be the amount he's used? Or wait, no. Wait, because the refund is for the unused portion. So the total premium is $32, so the amount he should get back is 32*(298/365) ≈ 26.10.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: $12.00

B: $14.72

C: $6.44

D: $16.64

E: $32

F: $22.72

G: $24.00

H: $9.28

I: $19.68

J: $18.36

Hmm, none of these seem to match 26.10. So I must have made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the refund based on the time elapsed, not the unused time. Because the question is about how much he paid for the time he kept the policy. Wait, no, the refund would be the amount corresponding to the unused time because he's canceling early.

Wait, let me think again. The total premium is for 365 days. If he cancels after 67 days, he would have paid for those 67 days, and the refund is for the remaining.

Wait, no, the way insurance works is that the premium is paid upfront for the entire term. So if he cancels after part of the term, he gets a refund for the unused part.

So the calculation is correct: (unused days / total days) * premium.

But 26.10 isn't an option. So I must have miscalculated something.

Wait, perhaps I counted the days wrong. Let me recount the days between July 17 and September 22.

July 17 to July 31: 31-17=14 days (since the 17th is day 1, so from 17th to 31st is 15 days? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If today is the 17th, tomorrow is the 18th. So from the 17th to the 31st inclusive is 15 days.

Because 31 minus 17 is 14, but since both days are included, it's 14 +1=15 days.

Oh, I see, I think I made a mistake here. So July: 15 days.

August: 31 days.

September: 22 days.

Wait, but wait, if the policy started on July 17, then the days in July are from the 17th to the 31st, which is 15 days.

So total days used are 15 +31 +22 = 68 days.

So unused days would be 365-68=297 days.

So the refund is (297/365)*32.

Let me compute that.

297 divided by 365 is approximately 0.8137.

Multiply by 32: 0.8137 *32 = let's see:

0.8 *32=25.6

0.0137*32≈0.4384

So total≈25.6 +0.4384=26.0384, around $26.04. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of days. Let me check again.

Wait, July 17 to July 31: 31-17=14 days. But including both the start and end dates, it's 15 days. So that's correct.

August: 31 days.

September: 22 days.

Total: 15+31=46 +22=68 days.

So another approach is to compute the exact fraction.

68 days out of 365.

So the used portion is 68/365, and the refund is the remaining, which is 1 - (68/365) = (365-68)/365= 297/365.

So 297/365 *32= ?

Let me compute 297*32= let's see:

300*32=9600, minus 3*32=96, so 9600-96=9504.

So 9504 divided by 365.

Now, 365 times 26 is 365*25=9125, plus 365=94890? Wait, no, wait, 365 *26=365*(20+6)=7300 +2190=9490.

Wait, 365*26=9490.

But we have 9504.

So 9504-9490=14.

So 9504/365=26 +14/365.

14 divided by 365 is approximately 0.03835.

So 26.03835, which is about $26.04.

But again, the options don't have this amount. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, maybe the policy is being canceled on September 22, and the refund is based on the time remaining from that date. So perhaps the days covered are from July 17 to September 22, which is 68 days, and the refund is for the remaining 365-68=297 days. So the refund would be (297/365)*32≈26.04.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made an error in calculating the days. Let me double-check the dates again.

Wait, July 17 to July 31: 15 days.

August: 31 days.

September 1 to September 22: 22 days.

Total: 15+31=46 +22=68.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the insurance company calculates on a monthly basis, not daily. Maybe they prorate by the month, not by the day. So perhaps any partial month is considered a full month.

So let me see, he started on July 17, so July is a partial month. August is a full month. September is another partial month.

If the company refunds based on full months only, then perhaps they would calculate the refund as follows:

He used July (partial), August (full), and September (partial). So let's see, from July 17 to the end of September: that's two full months (August and September) plus a partial in July and a partial in September.

Wait, but perhaps the company only refunds full months beyond the current month. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the policy is considered to have been in force for two months (July and August) plus part of September.

Wait, but without the exact terms, it's hard to say. But the question doesn't specify, so I think the daily calculation is intended.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think if the refund might be calculated as 32 minus the cost for the time used.

The time used is 68 days, so the cost per day is 32/365 ≈ $0.08767 per day.

So 68 days * 0.08767 ≈ $6.00.

So the refund would be 32 -6=26, but again, that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of fractions of the year.

68 days is approximately 0.1863 of a year (68/365≈0.1863).

So the amount charged would be 32 * 0.1863≈$5.97. So the refund would be 32-5.97≈26.03.

Again, not matching the options.

Hmm, maybe the question uses a 360-day year for calculation purposes, which is common in some financial calculations.

Let me try that. So 68 days would be 68/360 = 0.1889.

32 * 0.1889 ≈ $6.04. So the refund would be 32-6.04≈25.96.

Still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options again, the closest is option I: $19.68, but that's lower than my calculations. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the policy was canceled on September 22, so the last day of coverage is September 21. Because sometimes the cancellation is effective at the end of the day, so the coverage ends on the day before.

Let me recalculate the days:

July 17 to July 31: 15 days.

August:31.

September:21 days (since September 22 is the day after coverage ends).

So total days:15+31=46 +21=67 days.

So unused days:365-67=298.

So refund: (298/365)*32 ≈26.10.

Again, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the premium is for 12 months, but the calculation is done monthly. So perhaps each month is considered as 1/12 of the premium.

He kept the policy for how many months?

July 17 to September 22: that's two full months (August) and parts of July and September.

If the company does refunds on a monthly basis, perhaps they would charge for the full months used.

So from July 17 to August 17 is one month, August 17 to September 17 is another month. But he canceled on September 22, so that's 5 days into the third month.

But if the company calculates per month, perhaps they charge for the full month if any days in that month are used.

So he used July (partial), August (full), and September (partial). So the company might charge for July as a full month, August as a full month, and September as a full month, totaling 3 months. So 3/12=0.25 of the premium, which is 32*0.25=8. So refund would be 32-8=24. So $24, which is option G.

But wait, that seems a bit off because he only used part of July and part of September. So perhaps they would only charge for the full months.

Wait, another approach: count the number of full months he had the policy. From July 17 to August 17 is one full month. Then from August 17 to September 17 is another. He canceled on September 22, so that's 5 days into the third month. If the company refunds based on full months, they might only charge for the two full months and refund the rest.

So two months would be 2/12=1/6 of the premium. So 32*(2/12)=32/6≈5.333. So the refund would be 32 -5.333≈26.666, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps they consider any partial month as a full month. So he had July (partial), August (full), September (partial). So total of 3 months. So 3/12=0.25. So 32*0.25=8. So refund is 24, which is option G.

But earlier, the exact day calculation gives around $26, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to calculate based on months, not days, and the answer would be $24.00, option G.

But wait, looking back at the options, option G is $24.00. So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the refund based on short-rate cancellation, which is more common in some insurance policies. I'm not too familiar with that, but I think short-rate cancellation means that the refund is not fully prorated but includes a penalty.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about penalties or fees, so I think we can assume a pro-rata refund without any penalties.

Another thought: perhaps the policy is for a term starting on July 17, so the first full month is August. Wait, no, the policy would start on the purchase date, which is July 17.

Alternatively, perhaps the company calculates the refund based on the number of months elapsed, rounding down to the nearest whole month.

So from July 17 to September 22: that's two full months (August and part of July and September). Wait, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the refund is calculated as the total premium minus the premium for the time used, where the time used is calculated in months.

So let's see, from July 17 to September 22 is approximately 2 and 1/3 months.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the exact number of days and then find the closest option.

Wait, let me try 68 days again.

68 days is 68/365 = approx 0.1863.

So the used amount is 32 * 0.1863 ≈ $6.00.

So the refund would be 32 -6 = $26.

But none of the options are close to $26.

Wait, let me check the options again:

A:12, B:14.72, C:6.44, D:16.64, E:32, F:22.72, G:24, H:9.28, I:19.68, J:18.36.

Hmm, none near 26. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the amount he paid, not the refund. No, the question says, what was his refund.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the days. Let me try another approach.

July 17 to September 22:

July: from 17th to 31st is 15 days.

August:31 days.

September:22 days.

Wait, but if the policy is canceled on September 22, does that day count as covered? So from July 17 to September 22 is 15+31+22=68 days.

Yes, that's correct.

So the refund is (365-68)/365 *32 = (297/365)*32.

Let me compute 297 *32 first.

297 *32:

200*32=6400

90*32=2880

7*32=224

Total:6400+2880=9280+224=9504.

So 9504 divided by 365.

Let me do this division.

365 × 26 = 9490, as before.

9504 -9490=14.

So 26 +14/365.

14/365 is approximately 0.03835.

So total is approximately 26.03835, which is about $26.04.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is $24, option G. But why?

Wait, perhaps the policy is considered to have been in force for two full months, July and August, and part of September. Maybe the company calculates on a 30-day month basis.

So 68 days is approx 2.2667 months (since 68/30≈2.2667).

So the used premium would be 32*(2.2667/12)=?

Wait, no, that's not correct. The premium is annual, so per month it's 32/12≈$2.6667 per month.

If the company charges per month, and he used 2 full months and a fraction.

If they charge for each full month and part of the third, then perhaps they charge for 3 months, which would be 3*(32/12)=8, as before. So refund would be 24.

Alternatively, if they only charge for the full months he used, which is 2 months, that's 2*(32/12)=5.333, so refund is 26.666, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the company calculates the refund based on the number of months remaining.

Wait, perhaps the policy was for 12 months starting July 17, so the refund is for the remaining 9 and 1/3 months.

Wait, 12
