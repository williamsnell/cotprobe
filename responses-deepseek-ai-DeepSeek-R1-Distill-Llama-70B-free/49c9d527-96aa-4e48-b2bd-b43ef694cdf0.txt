Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Trauten buying a refrigerator on an installment plan. I need to figure out the down payment and the monthly payments. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The refrigerator costs $225. He's paying 15% down. So the down payment is 15% of 225. Let me calculate that. 15% is 0.15, so 0.15 * 225. Hmm, 0.1 * 225 is 22.5, and 0.05*225 is 11.25. Adding those together gives 33.75. So the down payment is $33.75. That's the first part.

Now, the balance due after the down payment is 225 minus 33.75. Let's see, 225 - 33.75. 225 minus 30 is 195, minus 3.75 is 191.25. So the balance is $191.25. 

But wait, there's also a service charge. The problem says a 7% a year service charge on the balance. Hmm, how does that work? Is it 7% per year, but the payments are monthly. Oh wait, the balance is being paid over 18 months. So I think the service charge is calculated annually on the balance, but since it's 18 months, maybe it's applied once? Or is it 7% per annum, so maybe the rate per month would be 7% divided by 12. But I'm not sure how to apply this.

Wait, the problem says the balance plus the service charge is to be paid in 18 equal monthly payments. Oh, right, so the service charge is added to the balance, and then that total is divided into 18 monthly payments.

So first, calculate the service charge on the balance. The balance is $191.25. 7% of that is 0.07 * 191.25. Let me compute that. 191.25 * 0.07. 200 * 0.07 is 14, so 191.25 is 8.75 less than 200. So 14 - (8.75 * 0.07) = 14 - 0.6125 = 13.3875. Wait, no, perhaps better to just calculate 191.25 * 0.07. 191 *0.07 is 13.37, and 0.25 *0.07 is 0.0175, so total is 13.3875. So the service charge is $13.3875, which I can round to about $13.39 for simplicity.

So the total amount to be paid is the balance plus the service charge: 191.25 + 13.3875 = 204.6375. Let's call it approximately $204.64.

Now, this amount is to be paid in 18 equal monthly payments. So each payment would be 204.6375 / 18. Let me compute that. 204.64 divided by 18. 18*11 is 198, so 11 dollars with 6.64 remaining. 6.64 / 18 is about 0.369, so approximately 11.369 per month. Wait, that can’t be right because looking at the options, the monthly payments are lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the service charge. Let me think again. Maybe the service charge is 7% per annum, but since it's being paid over 18 months (1.5 years), perhaps the effective rate is higher.

Alternatively, maybe the 7% is applied once as a flat rate. So the service charge is 7% of the balance, added once, and then the total is paid over 18 months. That's what I did earlier. Let me check the math again.

So total to pay is 191.25 + (191.25 * 0.07) = 191.25 * 1.07. Let's compute 191.25 * 1.07. 191.25 * 1 = 191.25, 191.25 * 0.07 is 13.3875. So 191.25 +13.3875 = 204.6375.

Now, 204.6375 divided by 18 months. Let me calculate this more accurately. 204.6375 / 18. 

18 * 11 = 198, remainder 6.6375.
6.6375 / 18 = 0.36875. So each payment is approximately 11.36875, so about $11.37 per month.

Wait, but looking at the options, the highest monthly payment I see is $15, but my calculation is around $11.37. The options given are:

A: 25 down, 14.80

B:33.75 down, 11.74

C:40,15

D:45,9.50

E:22.50,13.25

F:35,10

G:30,12

H:37.50,10.25

I:27,12.15

J:33.75,10.50

So option B has a down payment of $33.75 and monthly payment ~11.74. My calculation gave about 11.37, which is close to 11.74 but not exact. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the service charge is calculated differently. Maybe it's 7% per annum, but applied monthly. Let me think about that. Alternatively, perhaps the service charge is being compounded monthly. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify compounding, so it's probably a simple interest.

Wait, maybe I should model the monthly payments as an annuity, using the present value formula.

The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) is:

PMT = PV * r(1+r)^n / [(1+r)^n – 1]

Where PV is the present value (the balance plus service charge?), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

Wait, but in this case, the service charge is 7% per year, so the monthly rate would be 7% / 12 = 0.0058333.

But the total amount to pay is the balance plus the service charge. Or is the service charge included in the PV?

Wait, perhaps the service charge is added to the balance, making the total amount to pay. So the PV is 191.25 + (191.25 * 0.07) = 204.6375 as before.

So PV = 204.6375, r=0.07/12=0.0058333, n=18.

So PMT = 204.6375 * (0.0058333*(1+0.0058333)^18) / [(1+0.0058333)^18 – 1]

Hmm, that's a bit complicated to calculate without a calculator, but let me try to approximate.

First, compute (1 + 0.0058333)^18. Let me compute that. The natural logarithm of 1.0058333 is approximately 0.005817. Multiply by 18: 0.1047. Exponentiating gives e^0.1047 ≈ 1.11. So (1.0058333)^18 ≈ 1.11.

So the numerator is 0.0058333 * 1.11 ≈ 0.006481.

Denominator is 1.11 – 1 = 0.11.

So PMT ≈ 204.6375 * (0.006481 / 0.11) 

0.006481 / 0.11 ≈ 0.0589.

So PMT ≈ 204.6375 * 0.0589 ≈ Let's compute 200*0.0589 = 11.78, 4.6375*0.0589≈0.273. So total ≈12.05.

Wait, that's about $12.05 per month. But none of the options have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Option B is $33.75 down and $11.74. Option J is $33.75 down and $10.50. Hmm, I'm getting around $12, which isn't exactly in the options. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the service charge is treated as a one-time fee added to the balance, and then each monthly payment is calculated without further interest. So maybe it's just 204.6375 /18 = approx 11.36.

Looking at the options, option B is 33.75 down and 11.74 payment. That's very close to my initial calculation without considering the monthly interest. So maybe the service charge is just a flat 7% added once, and then the payments are simple division, without considering the time value of money beyond the initial service charge.

In that case, each payment would be 204.6375 /18 = approx 11.369, which is $11.37, which is close to option B's $11.74. But it's not exact. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should carry the exact calculation.

Wait, 191.25 * 1.07 = 191.25 + (191.25 * 0.07). Let me compute that exactly.

191.25 * 0.07: 191 *0.07=13.37, 0.25 *0.07=0.0175. So total 13.3875.

So 191.25 +13.3875=204.6375.

Now, 204.6375 divided by 18. Let's do exact division.

18*11=198, so 204.6375-198=6.6375.

6.6375 /18=0.36875.

So each payment is 11.36875, which is $11.37 (rounded to the nearest cent).

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 33.75 and 11.74. But wait, 11.37 is closer to 11.37 than 11.74. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe the service charge is calculated monthly, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the initial service charge is 7% of the balance, but the monthly payments are subject to interest as well.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a simple interest loan. The service charge is 7% per annum, so the interest per month is 7% divided by 12, which is 0.583333% per month.

In that case, the total amount to pay would be the balance plus the interest over 18 months.

Wait, but that's not exactly how installment loans work. Typically, you pay both principal and interest each month. So perhaps the monthly payment would be calculated using the present value of an annuity formula.

Let me try that approach.

The present value (PV) is the balance after down payment: $191.25.

The monthly interest rate is 7%/12 = 0.0058333.

Number of payments, n=18.

The monthly payment (PMT) can be found using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We can rearrange to solve for PMT:

PMT = PV * r / [1 - (1 + r)^-n ]

Plugging in the numbers:

PMT = 191.25 * 0.0058333 / [1 - (1 + 0.0058333)^-18 ]

First, compute (1.0058333)^-18. Let me compute (1.0058333)^18 first, then take reciprocal.

As before, (1.0058333)^18 ≈ 1.11, so 1/(1.11) ≈ 0.9009.

So denominator is 1 - 0.9009 = 0.0991.

PMT = 191.25 * 0.0058333 / 0.0991.

Compute numerator: 191.25 * 0.0058333 ≈ 1.1157.

So PMT ≈ 1.1157 / 0.0991 ≈ 11.26.

So approximately $11.26 per month. But none of the options have that exact number. Option B's payment is $11.74, which is close.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.0058333)^18 more accurately. Let me do that step by step.

Compute month by month:

1.0058333^1 = 1.0058333

^2 = 1.0058333 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0116666

^3 ≈ 1.0116666 * 1.0058333 ≈ 1.0176999

^4 ≈ 1.0176999 *1.0058333 ≈1.0238323

^5≈1.0238323 *1.0058333 ≈1.029975

^6≈1.029975*1.0058333≈1.036129

^7≈1.036129*1.0058333≈1.042292

^8≈1.042292*1.0058333≈1.048466

^9≈1.048466 *1.0058333≈1.05466

^10≈1.05466 *1.0058333≈1.060866

^11≈1.060866 *1.0058333≈1.067085

^12≈1.067085 *1.0058333≈1.07332

^13≈1.07332 *1.0058333≈1.07957

^14≈1.07957 *1.0058333≈1.08584

^15≈1.08584 *1.0058333≈1.092126

^16≈1.092126 *1.0058333≈1.09843

^17≈1.09843 *1.0058333≈1.104752

^18≈1.104752 *1.0058333≈1.111127.

So (1.0058333)^18 ≈1.111127.

So (1.0058333)^-18 = 1 / 1.111127 ≈0.8999.

So denominator is 1 - 0.8999 = 0.1001.

Now, PMT = 191.25 * 0.0058333 / 0.1001.

Compute numerator: 191.25 * 0.0058333.

Let me compute 191 * 0.0058333 first. 200 *0.0058333 is 1.16666, so 191 is 9 less, so 1.16666 - (9 *0.0058333)= 1.16666 - 0.0525 = 1.11416.

Then 0.25 *0.0058333 = 0.0014583.

So total numerator is 1.11416 + 0.0014583 ≈1.11562.

So PMT=1.11562 / 0.1001 ≈11.15.

Wait, so about $11.15 per month.

But looking at the options, the closest is option B, which has $11.74. Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the service charge. Let me re-examine the problem.

The balance due, along with a 7% a year service charge, is to be paid in 18 equal monthly payments.

So the service charge is 7% per annum on the balance. But since the payments are over 18 months (1.5 years), perhaps the service charge is 7% *1.5 = 10.5% of the balance.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. So service charge could be 10.5%.

Let me try that approach.

So balance after down payment: 191.25.

Service charge: 7% per annum for 1.5 years: 10.5%.

So service charge amount: 191.25 * 0.105 = let's compute that.

191.25 * 0.1 = 19.125.

191.25 * 0.005 = 0.95625.

So total service charge: 19.125 + 0.95625 = 20.08125.

Total amount to pay: 191.25 +20.08125=211.33125.

Now, divide by 18 months: 211.33125 /18.

18*11=198, remainder 13.33125.

13.33125 /18=0.7407.

So each payment is approximately 11.7407, which is about $11.74.

Now, looking at the options, option B has down payment $33.75 and monthly payment $11.74. That matches perfectly.

So the correct answer would be option B.
</think>

To determine the down payment and monthly payments for the refrigerator purchased on the installment plan, we start by calculating the down payment, which is 15% of the total price of $225. 

\[
\text{Down Payment} = 0.15 \times 225 = 33.75
\]

The balance due after the down payment is:

\[
\text{Balance} = 225 - 33.75 = 191.25
\]

Next, the problem specifies a 7% annual service charge on the balance. Since the payments are spread over 18 months (1.5 years), the service charge is calculated as:

\[
\text{Service Charge} = 191.25 \times (0.07 \times 1.5) = 191.25 \times 0.105 = 20.08125
\]

The total amount to be paid, including the service charge, is:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 191.25 + 20.08125 = 211.33125
\]

This total is to be paid in 18 equal monthly payments. To find the monthly payment:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{211.33125}{18} \approx 11.74
\]

Thus, the down payment is $33.75, and the monthly payment is approximately $11.74. Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: $33.75 and $11.74**

B
