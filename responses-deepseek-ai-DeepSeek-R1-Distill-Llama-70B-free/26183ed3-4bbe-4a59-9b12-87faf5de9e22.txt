Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about where the idea of 'natural law' first appeared. The options are A through D, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that natural law has been a concept in philosophy and legal theory for a long time. It's the idea that there's a universal moral code that's inherent in nature, and it applies to everyone regardless of human laws. But where did this idea originate?

Looking at the options:

A: French Revolution. I know the French Revolution was in the late 18th century and had a lot to do with Enlightenment ideas, including some about natural rights and laws. But was that where natural law started? I don't think so because the Enlightenment was influenced by earlier philosophers.

B: American War of Independence. This was also in the 18th century. The Declaration of Independence mentions "Laws of Nature and Nature's God," so natural law definitely played a role here. But again, this seems like an application of the idea rather than its origin.

C: Roman Law. Roman law was codified in systems like the Corpus Juris Civilis. I remember that Roman jurists, especially Cicero, talked about natural law, or "jus naturale." They believed that certain principles were inherent in nature and should guide human laws. This seems like a strong candidate.

D: Greek Thinking. Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle discussed ideas about natural justice and the concept of a higher law. For example, Aristotle talked about natural justice being universal. But the term 'natural law' as a concept might have been more developed in Roman times.

Wait, so Greek thinking laid the groundwork, but Roman law formalized the idea more. So the concept of natural law as we understand it today probably first appeared in Roman Law. That would make option C the correct answer.

But wait, I should double-check. The Greek philosophers did discuss natural justice, but the specific term and legal framework of natural law might have started with the Romans. So the first appearance of the idea, even if it's in a more primitive form, might be in Greek thinking. Or maybe the concept was first articulated by the Greeks, and then Romans expanded on it.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The question is about where the idea first appeared. Greek philosophers like Heraclitus talked about a common law that's divine, and Plato discussed higher laws. But the Romans, especially through Cicero, developed the concept more explicitly as 'natural law.' So perhaps the idea originated in Greek thinking but was formalized in Roman Law.

Wait, but the question is where it first appeared. So if the Greeks were the first to discuss it, then option D would be correct. But I'm a bit torn because I remember that natural law in the context of legal theory is often attributed to the Stoics, who were Greek, but then the Romans adopted it.

Alternatively, maybe the concept of natural law as a legal principle started in Roman Law, building on Greek philosophy. So the question is about the first appearance, which would be Greek thinking.

Wait, no, the Stoics were Greek but later influenced the Romans. So the idea of natural law in legal terms began with the Stoics, who were part of Greek thinking. So the first appearance would be in D: Greek Thinking.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the concept of natural law as a legal and philosophical idea started with the Greeks. The Romans then incorporated it into their legal system. So the first appearance would be in Greek thinking.

But I'm a bit confused because I remember that the term 'natural law' (jus naturale) was used by the Romans. So perhaps the answer is C: Roman Law.

Wait, maybe I should think about the timeline. Greek philosophers were around 500 BCE to 300 BCE. The Stoics, who were Greek, developed the idea of natural law around 300 BCE. Then the Romans, like Cicero, picked it up in the 1st century BCE. So the first appearance would be in Greek thinking, option D.

But another angle: the question is about where the idea first appeared. If the Greeks discussed natural justice but not exactly 'natural law' as a legal concept, then maybe the Romans were the first to formalize it as part of their legal system. So the answer might be C.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall some key points. The concept of natural law is often attributed to the Stoics, which were Greek. They believed in a universal law based on reason. The Romans then adopted this into their legal framework. So the idea originated in Greek thinking, making D the correct answer.

But wait, the question is about the first appearance, so if the Greeks were the first, then D is correct. However, if the question is about the first formal legal appearance, it's C.

I think the question is asking about the origin, so the answer would be D: Greek Thinking.

The concept of 'natural law' has its roots in ancient philosophy, particularly in Greek thinking. Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle discussed ideas of natural justice and universal principles. The Stoics, who were part of the Greek philosophical tradition, further developed the idea of a universal law based on reason. While the Romans, especially through figures like Cicero, later formalized and incorporated the concept of natural law into their legal system, the idea itself first appeared in Greek thinking. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: Greek Thinking.
