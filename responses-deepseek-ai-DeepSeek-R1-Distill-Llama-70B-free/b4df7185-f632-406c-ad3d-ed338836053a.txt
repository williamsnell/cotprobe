Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about nitroglycerin exploding and producing some gases. I'm a bit rusty on stoichiometry, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question says that 454 grams of nitroglycerin explodes, and we need to find the total volume of gaseous products at STP. The reaction given is:

4 C3H5(NO3)3(l) → 12 CO2(g) + 6 N2(g) + O2(g) + 10 H2O(g)

Hmm, wait, I remember that at STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So the plan is probably to find out how many moles of each gas are produced, add them up, and multiply by 22.4 to get the total volume.

First, I need to find out how many moles of nitroglycerin are involved. The molecular weight is given as 227 g/mol. So moles of nitroglycerin would be mass divided by molar mass.

Mass is 454 grams. So 454 g / 227 g/mol = 2 moles. Oh, that's easy enough.

Now, the balanced equation shows that 4 moles of nitroglycerin produce some gases. Let me check the coefficients on the products:

12 CO2, 6 N2, 1 O2, 10 H2O. So total moles of gas per 4 moles of nitroglycerin.

Wait, but all products are gases except maybe H2O? Oh, the question says it's producing only gaseous products, so I guess H2O is in gas form here. So all are gases.

So for 4 moles of nitroglycerin, we have:

12 +6 +1 +10 = 29 moles of gas.

Wait, 12 CO2 is 12 moles, N2 is 6, O2 is 1, H2O is 10. So 12+6 is 18, plus 1 is 19, plus 10 is 29. So 29 moles per 4 moles of nitroglycerin.

Since we have 2 moles of nitroglycerin (because 454/227 is 2), I can set up a proportion.

So moles of gas produced = (29 moles gas / 4 moles nitroglycerin) * 2 moles nitroglycerin.

Calculating that: 29/4 is 7.25, multiplied by 2 is 14.5 moles of gas total.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. 2 moles of nitroglycerin would produce (2/4)*29 = (1/2)*29 = 14.5 moles. Yes.

Then, each mole at STP is 22.4 liters. So 14.5 moles * 22.4 L/mol = ?

Let me compute that. 14 *22.4 is 313.6, 0.5 is 11.2, so total is 324.8 liters.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E is 325 liters, which is very close. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the stoichiometry. Let's go through step by step.

Molar mass of nitroglycerin is 227 g/mol. So 454g / 227g/mol = 2 mol. Correct.

The balanced equation is 4 mol nitroglycerin → produces 12 +6 +1 +10 = 29 mol gas. So per mole of nitroglycerin, it's 29/4 = 7.25 mol gas.

Multiply by 2 mol → 14.5 mol gas. Correct.

14.5 * 22.4 = 324.8, which is approximately 325 liters. So the answer should be E: 325 liters.

Wait, but let me recheck the initial reaction equation. Oh wait, the reaction produces O2 as a gas. So yes, all products are gaseous. So the calculation includes all.

I think that's solid. So I'll go with option E.

To determine the total volume of gaseous products produced at STP when 454 g of nitroglycerin explodes, we start by calculating the number of moles of nitroglycerin involved. The molecular weight of nitroglycerin is given as 227 g/mol, so:

\[
\text{Moles of nitroglycerin} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{454 \, \text{g}}{227 \, \text{g/mol}} = 2 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The balanced reaction is:

\[
4 \, \text{C}_3\text{H}_5(\text{NO}_3)_3(l) \rightarrow 12 \, \text{CO}_2(g) + 6 \, \text{N}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) + 10 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}(g).
\]

From the equation, 4 moles of nitroglycerin produce a total of:

\[
12 + 6 + 1 + 10 = 29 \, \text{moles of gas}.
\]

Thus, the number of moles of gas produced per mole of nitroglycerin is:

\[
\frac{29 \, \text{moles of gas}}{4 \, \text{moles of nitroglycerin}} = 7.25 \, \text{moles of gas per mole of nitroglycerin}.
\]

For 2 moles of nitroglycerin, the total moles of gas produced are:

\[
7.25 \, \text{moles of gas per mole of nitroglycerin} \times 2 \, \text{moles of nitroglycerin} = 14.5 \, \text{moles of gas}.
\]

At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, the total volume of gas produced is:

\[
14.5 \, \text{moles} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 324.8 \, \text{liters}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the total volume is approximately 325 liters. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**E: 325 liters.**
