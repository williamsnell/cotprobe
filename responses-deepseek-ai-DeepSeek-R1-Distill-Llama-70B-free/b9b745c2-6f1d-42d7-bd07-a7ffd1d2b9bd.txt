The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.
William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, "On the Suppression of Sati," 1829
I have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].
George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826

Okay, so I've got this question about Western imperialism and two passages from historical figures. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism is undermined by the first passage. The first passage is from William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India in 1829, discussing the suppression of sati. The second passage is from George Simpson of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826, talking about ruling Indians with a rod of iron.

I need to focus on the first passage. Let me read it again. Bentinck is talking about whether to continue or discontinue the practice of sati. He's clearly conflicted. On one hand, allowing sati means hundreds of women die cruelly each year, which is horrific. On the other hand, he's worried that banning it might threaten the safety of the British Empire in India. But since the British are now supreme, he thinks it's time to prohibit it openly.

So what assumption does this challenge? The options are A to D.

Option A says European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices. But wait, Bentinck is considering interfering by banning sati, which is a religious practice. So this passage actually supports that assumption, not undermines it. So A isn't the answer.

Option B suggests colonizers were deeply concerned with profits. The first passage doesn't mention profits; it's more about moral and political issues. Simpson's passage does talk about trade and dependence on goods, but that's the second passage, not the first. So B might not be the right choice here.

Option C claims colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms. Bentinck's hesitation shows that the decision wasn't straightforward. He was considering the potential backlash and the empire's safety. This suggests that the British weren't uniformly eager; they had internal debates and considered the consequences. So this passage might undermine the idea of uniform eagerness, making C a possible answer.

Option D states that colonizers often used armed force. The first passage doesn't mention using force. Instead, Bentinck is contemplating a policy decision, not necessarily using military might. Simpson's passage does talk about rule through dependence on goods, but again, that's the second passage. So D doesn't seem to be the one.

Wait, so the question is about which assumption is undermined. The first passage shows that Bentinck is conflicted and cautious about interfering in religious practices because of political stability concerns. This goes against the idea that colonizers were always eager to impose their norms without hesitation. So it undermines the assumption that they were uniformly eager, which is option C.

Alternatively, let me think again. The passage shows that Bentinck is willing to interfere but also shows that there was a time when they weren't interfering because of expediency. So it's not that they were always forcing their norms, but that they sometimes refrained when it was expedient. This would mean that the assumption that they were uniformly eager is incorrect.

Yes, so the correct answer should be C because it challenges the idea that all colonizers were uniformly eager to impose their cultural norms without considering other factors.

The first passage by William Bentinck discusses the suppression of sati, revealing a conflicted decision-making process. Bentinck weighs the moral horror of allowing sati against the potential political risks of banning it, ultimately favoring prohibition now that British supremacy is secure. This passage undermines the assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to impose their cultural norms on native populations, as it shows hesitation and consideration of broader consequences rather than a straightforward enforcement of cultural values.

Answer: C
