Okay, so I have this question about vertical integration, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what vertical integration means. From what I remember in my business classes, vertical integration is when a company takes control over more stages of its supply chain. So it's about expanding either forward or backward along the chain.

The question specifically asks about vertical integration forwards. Hmm, I think forward integration means moving towards the end consumer. Like, if a company is in manufacturing and then buys a retail company that sells the products directly to consumers. That way, they're controlling more of the distribution and sales part.

Looking at the options, option A says "Towards the consumer." That sounds right because forward integration would be expanding in the direction where the products go after leaving the factory. Option E is "Towards the manufacturer," which might be backward integration because that's moving towards the production side, like a retailer buying a factory.

Wait, let me make sure. Backward integration is when a company takes over suppliers, like a car manufacturer buying a tire company. So that's moving up the supply chain towards the source. Forward would be moving down the chain towards the customer.

So in the question, vertical integration forwards would mean the firm is merging or acquiring a company that's closer to the consumer. So the correct option should be A: Towards the consumer.

The correct answer is A: Towards the consumer.
