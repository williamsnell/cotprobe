Question:

In an experiment to study heat transfer, a metal box 35 in. long, 10 in. wide, and 3 in. deep, is propelled at a velocity of 73.3 ft/sec. The box has a surface tempera-ture of T_s = 145°F while the ambient air temperature is T_\infty = 35°F. Assume a turbulent boundary layer, and employ the same convective heat transfer coefficient for all sides of the box. Note that the bottom of the box is not exposed to air, and therefore will not lose heat. Calculate the rate of heat flow from the box.

D: 4100 Btu/hr
E: 3200 Btu/hr
F: 2900 Btu/hr
G: 4500 Btu/hr
H: 6800 Btu/hr
I: 7500 Btu/hr

Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I need to figure out the rate of heat flow from this metal box. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me the dimensions of the box: 35 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 3 inches deep. Oh wait, and it's moving at 73.3 feet per second. The surface temperature is 145°F, and the ambient air is 35°F. They mentioned something about a turbulent boundary layer and using the same convective heat transfer coefficient for all sides. Also, the bottom isn't exposed, so no heat loss there.

Alright, so I remember that the basic formula for heat transfer by convection is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convective coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference. But wait, since it's moving through air, I think we have to calculate h first. Oh right, h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, which depends on the flow conditions.

The box is moving, so it's forced convection. For that, I think we use the formula involving the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number for air. Oh wait, but the question says to assume a turbulent boundary layer, so the Reynolds number must be high enough. So I probably need to calculate the Reynolds number to find h.

Wait, but the problem says to employ the same convective coefficient for all sides. So maybe I don't have to calculate h myself? Or maybe I do, because it's not given. Hmm. The question doesn't provide h, so I think I need to compute it.

First, I should probably convert all the units to a consistent system. Let's see, the velocity is given in feet per second, and the dimensions are in inches. Maybe converting everything to inches and seconds would be better, but wait, I remember that in the imperial system, the formula for h might require feet or something. Hmm, perhaps I should convert the velocity from ft/s to in/s or m/s? Wait, let's think about the units for Reynolds number.

Reynolds number Re = (v * L) / ν, where v is velocity, L is characteristic length, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of air. Oh, right, and the characteristic length for a flat plate is the length in the direction of flow, which here would be the length of the box, 35 inches. But wait, I'm not sure if it's the length or another dimension. Hmm.

Wait, the box is 35" long, 10" wide, and 3" deep. When it's moving, the flow is probably along the length, so the characteristic length L would be 35 inches. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should proceed with that.

But wait, I think that for a rectangular object, the characteristic length is the length along the flow direction. So if the box is moving such that the 35" side is facing the flow, then L is 35 inches.

So, the velocity v is 73.3 ft/s. Let's convert that into inches per second because the length is in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 73.3 * 12 = 879.6 inches per second.

Wait, that seems really high. Let me check: 73.3 ft/s * 12 in/ft = 73.3 * 12 = 879.6 in/s. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the kinematic viscosity ν for air. I remember that at around room temperature (like 20°C or so), ν for air is about 0.0000167 ft²/s. But wait, let's get the exact value or at least the right one for the temperature here. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't specify the temperature for the air's properties, so maybe I should stick with standard conditions. Let's take ν as approximately 1.57e-5 ft²/s, but wait, that's in m²/s. Oh, no, wait—wait. Let's clarify the units.

Wait, in the imperial system, the kinematic viscosity of air at around 70°F is about 0.0000171 ft²/s. So I think I should use that value.

Wait, let's check: 70°F is about 21°C, and the kinematic viscosity ν for air at 20°C is approximately 1.5e-5 m²/s. To convert that to ft²/s, since 1 m² = 10.7639 ft², so 1.5e-5 m²/s = approx 1.5e-5 * 0.0929 (since 1 m² = (3.2808 ft)^2 ≈ 10.7639 ft²) so 1.5e-5 m²/s * 0.0929 (ft²/m²) => Wait, no, wait! Oh no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 m² is 10.7639 ft², so 1 ft² is approx 0.0929 m². So if ν is 1.5e-5 m²/s, then in ft²/s, it's 1.5e-5 * (1 m² / 10.7639 ft²) )? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: To convert from m²/s to ft²/s, since 1 m² = 10.7639 ft², then 1 m²/s = 10.7639 ft²/s. So to convert from m²/s to ft²/s, you multiply by 10.7639.

So 1.5e-5 m²/s = 1.5e-5 * 10.7639 ≈ 1.6145e-4 ft²/s. So ν ≈ 0.00016145 ft²/s.

Wait, that seems a bit higher than what I thought earlier. Alternatively, maybe I should just use the commonly accepted value. Let me double-check: At 70°F (21°C), ν for air is approximately 0.0000171 ft²/s. Hmm, that's different. Well, perhaps I should go with that.

So, ν ≈ 0.0000171 ft²/s.

Now, compute the Reynolds number Re = (v * L) / ν.

But wait, let's get the units correct.

v is 73.3 ft/s.

L is 35 inches. So I need to convert that to feet. 35 inches / 12 = 2.9167 feet.

So Re = (73.3 ft/s * 2.9167 ft) / 0.0000171 ft²/s.

Let me compute that:

73.3 * 2.9167 ≈ 73.3 * 2.9167.

Let me compute that: 70 * 2.9167 = 204.169, and 3.3 * 2.9167 ≈ 9.621, so total ≈ 204.169 + 9.621 ≈ 213.79.

Then, Re = 213.79 / 0.0000171 ≈ Let's compute 213.79 / 0.0000171.

Well, 213.79 / 0.0000171 = ?

Let me compute 213.79 / 1.71e-5 = 213.79 / 0.0000171 ≈ 12,505,000 approximately.

So Re ≈ 12.5 million, which is well into the turbulent flow regime (Re > 500,000 is turbulent for flat plates), so that's correct.

Now, for turbulent flow over a flat plate, the average Nusselt number Nu can be calculated using the correlation:

Nu = 0.037 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.333, where Pr is the Prandtl number.

Wait, but sometimes the exponent for Pr is 1/3, so 0.333 is about right.

Now, the Prandtl number for air is about 0.7 (it's around 0.7 for air at moderate temperatures). So Pr ≈ 0.7.

So, plugging in Re ≈ 12.5e6 (12,500,000), let's compute Nu.

Nu = 0.037 * (12.5e6)^0.8 * (0.7)^0.333.

First, (12.5e6)^0.8: Let's compute 12.5e6 is 12,500,000.

Compute ln(12,500,000) = ln(1.25e7) = ln(1.25) + ln(1e7) = 0.2231 + 16.1181 = 16.3412.

Multiply by 0.8: 16.3412 * 0.8 ≈ 13.073.

Exponentiate: e^13.073. Let me think, e^10 ≈ 22026, e^13 ≈ 442413. So e^13.073 ≈ 442413 * e^0.073.

e^0.073 ≈ 1.0757. So 442413 * 1.0757 ≈ 475,500.

Wait, but that's just an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, maybe using log tables or a calculator approach, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can use the power calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (12.5e6)^0.8 as follows:

12.5e6 = 1.25 * 10^7.

So, (1.25)^0.8 * (10^7)^0.8.

(1.25)^0.8 ≈ Let's compute 1.25^0.8.

1.25^0.8: ln(1.25) = 0.2231, multiply by 0.8: 0.1785, e^0.1785 ≈ 1.195.

(10^7)^0.8 = 10^(7*0.8) = 10^5.6 ≈ 3,981,072.

So (1.25e7)^0.8 ≈ 1.195 * 3,981,072 ≈ 4,763,000.

Wait, but that's just the (Re)^0.8 part. So Nu = 0.037 * 4,763,000 * (0.7)^(1/3).

Compute (0.7)^(1/3): The cube root of 0.7 is approximately 0.887.

So Nu ≈ 0.037 * 4,763,000 * 0.887.

Compute 0.037 * 4,763,000: 0.037 * 4.763e6 = 0.037 * 4,763,000 ≈ 176,221.

Then multiply by 0.887: 176,221 * 0.887 ≈ 156,300.

So Nu ≈ 156,300.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of (12.5e6)^0.8. Let me try a different approach.

Let me compute Re^0.8:

Re = 12.5e6 = 1.25e7.

Take natural log: ln(1.25e7) = ln(1.25) + ln(1e7) = 0.2231 + 16.1181 ≈ 16.3412.

Multiply by 0.8: 16.3412 * 0.8 = 13.07296.

Exponentiate: e^13.07296 ≈ e^13 = 442413, plus e^0.07296.

e^0.07296 ≈ 1.0757. So 442413 * 1.0757 ≈ 442413 * 1.075 ≈ 475,300.

So 0.037 * 4.753e5 = 0.037 * 475,300 ≈ 17,596.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: Wait, that's 4.753e5, which is 475,300. So 0.037 times 475,300 is indeed approximately 17,596.

Then, multiply by (0.7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.887: 17,596 * 0.887 ≈ 15,604.

So Nu ≈ 15,604.

Hmm, that's a lot lower than before. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Because 12.5e6 is 12,500,000, which is 1.25e7. So (1.25e7)^0.8 is (1.25)^0.8 * (1e7)^0.8 = (approx 1.195) * (1e5.6).

Wait, 1e5.6 is 10^5.6, which is 10^(5 + 0.6) = 10^5 * 10^0.6 ≈ 100,000 * 3.981 ≈ 398,100.

So 1.195 * 398,100 ≈ 476,300.

So, (Re)^0.8 ≈ 476,300.

Then, 0.037 * 476,300 ≈ 17,613.

Multiply by (0.7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.887: 17,613 * 0.887 ≈ 15,620.

So Nu ≈ 15,620.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because I thought for Re around 1e7, the Nu would be higher. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, the formula is Nu = 0.037 * Re^0.8 * Pr^(1/3).

So, 0.037 * (12.5e6)^0.8 * (0.7)^(1/3).

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an online calculator or table for Nusselt number, but since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with the calculation.

So, with Nu ≈ 15,620.

Now, the Nusselt number is defined as Nu = h * L / k, where k is the thermal conductivity of air.

So, solving for h: h = Nu * k / L.

I need the thermal conductivity of air. At around 70°F, the thermal conductivity k for air is approximately 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). Wait, wait, no: Let me think, in metric units, it's about 0.025 W/m·K, but in imperial units, that's around 0.015 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Wait, 1 W/m·K is approximately 0.5778 BTU/(hr·ft·°F). So 0.025 W/m·K * 0.5778 ≈ 0.01445 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

So, k ≈ 0.0145 BTU/(hr·ft·°F).

Now, L is the characteristic length, which is 35 inches converted to feet: 35/12 ≈ 2.9167 feet.

So, h = Nu * k / L.

h = 15,620 * 0.0145 / 2.9167.

Compute numerator: 15,620 * 0.0145.

15,620 * 0.01 = 156.2.

15,620 * 0.0045 = let's compute 15,620 * 0.004 = 62.48, and 15,620 * 0.0005 = 7.81. So total 62.48 +7.81=70.29.

So 0.0145 is 0.01 + 0.0045: 156.2 +70.29=226.49.

So numerator is approx 226.49.

Divide by L (2.9167 ft): 226.49 / 2.9167 ≈ Let's compute 226.49 ÷ 2.9167.

2.9167 * 77 = 224.6, which is close to 226.49. So 77.0 approximately.

So h ≈ 77.0 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, L is 35 inches, which is 2.9167 ft.

So, h = (15,620) * (0.0145) / (2.9167) = (15,620 * 0.0145) = 226.49. Then 226.49 / 2.9167 ≈ 77.7.

So h ≈ 77.7 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Hmm, okay.

Now, the next step is to compute the heat transfer rate Q using Q = h * A * ΔT.

But wait, we need the total exposed area. The box has 6 faces, but the bottom isn't exposed, so only 5 faces are contributing.

Wait, let's compute the areas.

The box is 35" long, 10" wide, and 3" deep.

So, the faces are:

Top: 35 * 10 = 350 in².

Front and back: Each is 35 * 3 = 105 in², so two of them => 210 in².

Left and right: Each is 10 * 3 = 30 in², so two => 60 in².

So total area is 350 + 210 + 60 = 620 in².

Wait, but the bottom is not exposed, so we subtract the bottom area, which is the same as top: 350 in². So the exposed area is 620 - 350 = 270 in².

Wait, no: wait, the box has 6 faces: top, bottom, front, back, left, right.

Top and bottom are each 35x10 in².

Front and back are 35x3 each.

Left and right are 10x3 each.

So, total area is 2*(35*10) + 2*(35*3) + 2*(10*3) = 700 + 210 + 60 = 970 in².

But the bottom is not exposed, so the exposed area is 970 - 350 = 620 in².

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Wait, let's compute:

Each pair:

Top and bottom: 2 * (35*10) = 2*350=700 in².

Front and back: 2*(35*3)=2*105=210 in².

Left and right: 2*(10*3)=2*30=60 in².

Total area: 700+210+60=970 in².

Exposed area:
