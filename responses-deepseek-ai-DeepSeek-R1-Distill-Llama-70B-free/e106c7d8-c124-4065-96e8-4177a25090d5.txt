Question:

An amoeba is placed in a puddle one day, and on that same day it splits into two amoebas. The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas. After one week, how many amoebas are in the puddle? (Assume the puddle has no amoebas before the first one is placed in the puddle.)

Options:

A: 8192
B: 4096
C: 2048
D: 64
E: 1024
F: 16384
G: 32
H: 512
I: 256
J: 128

Okay, so I have this problem about amoebas splitting, and I need to figure out how many there are after a week. Hmm. Let me think. The question says that an amoeba is placed in a puddle, and on the same day it splits into two. So day one starts with one, and ends with two. 

Wait, but how does the splitting work each day? Each day, every amoeba splits into two new ones. So it's like a doubling every day. So it's exponential growth, right?

Let me break it down day by day. Day 0, maybe, is when there's nothing. Then day 1, we put one amoeba, and it splits into two. So by the end of day 1, we have 2 amoebas. 

Wait, the question says "after one week". So that's seven days. Because a week is seven days. So I think the initial placement is on day 1, and then each subsequent day up to day 7. Or maybe the placement is day 0, and then the splitting happens for seven days. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again.

"An amoeba is placed in a puddle one day, and on that same day it splits into two amoebas." So the first day (day 1) starts with one, then splits into two. Then the next day (day 2), each of those two splits into two each, making four. And so on. So each day, the number doubles.

So the initial day is day 1: 2 amoebas. Then day 2: 4, day 3: 8, etc. So after n days, the number is 2^n. Wait, but wait. Let me count the days carefully.

Wait, the first day (day 1) ends with 2 amoebas. Then each subsequent day doubles. So for day 2, 4, day 3:8, day4:16, day5:32, day6:64, day7:128. Wait, but that would be after 7 days, 128 amoebas. But wait, looking at the options, option J is 128. So is that the answer?

Wait, but another way to think about it is that each day the number doubles, starting from 1 on day 1. Wait, no, because on day 1, the amoeba splits into two. So that's the end of day 1: 2. So the number of amoebas at the end of day n is 2^n. So for day 7, that's 2^7 = 128. So that's option J.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me think about the days:

Day 1: 1 splits to 2 → total 2.
Day 2: each of 2 splits → 4.
Day 3: 8.
Day 4: 16.
Day 5:32.
Day6:64.
Day7:128.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is J:128.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes in these problems, the initial count is considered as day 0. Let me check that. If the day when it's placed and splits is day 0, then after seven days, it's 2^7=128. But in the question, the initial placement is on the same day as the first split. So when they say 'after one week', that's seven days, so the count is 2^7=128. So yes, J is correct.

The problem involves an amoeba placed in a puddle that splits into two amoebas on the same day. Each subsequent day, every amoeba splits into two new amoebas, leading to exponential growth. The task is to determine the number of amoebas after one week (seven days).

- On day 1, the single amoeba splits into 2 amoebas.
- On day 2, each of the 2 amoebas splits into 2, resulting in 4 amoebas.
- This pattern continues, with the number of amoebas doubling each day.

The number of amoebas at the end of day \( n \) can be expressed as \( 2^n \). Since the question asks for the number of amoebas after one week (7 days), the calculation is:

\[
2^7 = 128
\]

Thus, after seven days, there are 128 amoebas in the puddle. The correct answer is:

J: 128
