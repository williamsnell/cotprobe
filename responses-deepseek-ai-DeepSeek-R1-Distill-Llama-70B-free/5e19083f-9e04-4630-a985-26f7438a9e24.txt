Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about chlorine isotopes. Hmm, I remember that chlorine has two main isotopes, right? One is mass 35 and the other is 37. The average atomic mass is given as 35.453 amu. I need to find out the percentage of each isotope in nature.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think it involves some algebra. Maybe I can set up an equation based on the average atomic mass.

Let me think: let’s say the percentage of Cl-35 is x%, and Cl-37 is y%. Since these are the only two isotopes, x + y should equal 100%. That makes sense.

So the average atomic mass is the weighted average of the two isotopes. So the equation would be:

35*(x/100) + 37*(y/100) = 35.453

But since x + y = 100, y is 100 - x. So substituting that in:

35x + 37(100 - x) = 35.453 * 100

Let me compute the right side first. 35.453 times 100 is 3545.3.

Wait, wait, no, actually, let me correct that. Since the equation is (x/100)*35 + (y/100)*37 = 35.453, and y is 100-x. So expanding that:

(35x + 37y)/100 = 35.453

But y is (100-x), so substituting:

(35x + 37*(100-x)) /100 = 35.453

Multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the denominator:

35x + 37*(100 - x) = 3545.3

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, 35.453 times 100 is 3545.3? No, wait, 35.453 * 100 is 3545.3? No, wait, 35.453 * 100 is 3545.3? No, wait, 35.453 * 100 is 3545.3? Wait, 35.453 * 100 is actually 3545.3? Wait, no, 35.453 * 100 is 3545.3? That can't be right because 35 * 100 is 3500, and 0.453 * 100 is 45.3, so total would be 3545.3. Oh, okay, that's correct.

So expanding the left side:

35x + 37*100 -37x = 3545.3

Calculate 37*100: that's 3700.

So 35x -37x + 3700 = 3545.3

Combine like terms: (35x -37x) is -2x.

So: -2x + 3700 = 3545.3

Subtract 3700 from both sides:

-2x = 3545.3 - 3700 → which is -154.7

So -2x = -154.7 → divide both sides by -2:

x = (-154.7)/(-2) = 77.35

So x is 77.35% for Cl-35. Then y is 100 -77.35 = 22.65% for Cl-37.

Looking at the options, option C is 77.35% and 22.65%. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the percent abundance of chlorine isotopes, we start by noting the two isotopes: Cl-35 (atomic mass 35 amu) and Cl-37 (atomic mass 37 amu). The average atomic mass of chlorine is given as 35.453 amu. Let the percentage of Cl-35 be \( x \)%, and the percentage of Cl-37 be \( y \)%. Since these are the only isotopes, \( x + y = 100 \).

The average atomic mass is a weighted average of the isotopic masses:

\[
35 \cdot \frac{x}{100} + 37 \cdot \frac{y}{100} = 35.453
\]

Substituting \( y = 100 - x \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{35x + 37(100 - x)}{100} = 35.453
\]

Multiply through by 100 to eliminate the denominator:

\[
35x + 37(100 - x) = 3545.3
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
35x + 3700 - 37x = 3545.3
\]

\[
-2x + 3700 = 3545.3
\]

\[
-2x = 3545.3 - 3700
\]

\[
-2x = -154.7
\]

\[
x = \frac{-154.7}{-2} = 77.35
\]

Thus, \( x = 77.35\% \) for Cl-35, and \( y = 100 - 77.35 = 22.65\% \) for Cl-37. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C: 77.35%, 22.65%**

Answer: C
