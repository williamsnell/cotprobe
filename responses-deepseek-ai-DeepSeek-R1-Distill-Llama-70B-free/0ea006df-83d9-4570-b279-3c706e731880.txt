Question:

A high school sent a survey to a randomly selected sample of 75 of last year's graduating class. 27 of those selected did not return the survey. The best plan of action would be to:

Options:

A: Use the surveys that were returned and conduct the analysis with a reduced confidence level.
B: Use the surveys that were returned and leave the sample size at 75 for the analysis.
C: Use the surveys that were returned and change the sample size to 48 for the analysis.
D: Randomly select another 75 class members and send the survey to them.
E: Send the survey to all members of the class to ensure a larger response rate.
F: Discard the survey results and opt for a different data collection method.
G: Re-send the survey to those that did not return it without further communication.
H: Use the surveys that were returned and estimate the responses of the 27 non-respondents.
I: Randomly select 27 additional class members and send the survey to them.
J: Follow up with those that did not return the survey to encourage them to respond.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a survey conducted by a high school. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the school sent a survey to a randomly selected sample of 75 graduates from last year. Out of those 75, 27 didn't return the survey. So, the school has 48 responses. Now, they're asking what the best plan of action would be.

Hmm, what are the options here? Let me go through each one.

Option A says use the returned surveys and conduct analysis with a reduced confidence level. Reduced confidence level... Wait, confidence level is a statistical term. If the sample size drops from 75 to 48, the confidence interval might widen because the sample is smaller. But does that mean the confidence level (like 95%) changes? Or is it the margin of error that changes? I think the confidence level is set by the researcher, like 95%, and doesn't change. So maybe this option isn't the best because the confidence level isn't being reduced; the sample size is smaller, affecting the margin of error.

Option B suggests using the returned surveys and keeping the sample size at 75. Oh, wait, but only 48 responded. If they say the sample size is 75, that's misleading because 27 didn't respond. So the actual sample size is 48, not 75. So B might not be correct because it's using the wrong sample size in analysis.

Option C says to use the returned surveys and change the sample size to 48. That makes sense because 48 actually responded. But wait, the initial sample was 75, and 48 is lower. So the analysis would be based on a smaller sample, which might affect the results. But is changing the sample size the best option? Or should they try to get more responses?

Option D is to randomly select another 75 class members. But the original sample was 75, and some didn't respond. If they pick another 75, that's increasing the sample size beyond the original plan. That might not be necessary unless they want a larger sample, but the question is about handling non-response.

Option E suggests sending the survey to all class members. That would definitely increase the response rate, but it's probably not feasible if the class is large. Also, the initial plan was a sample, so moving to a census might not be practical or the best use of resources.

Option F says to discard the results and choose a different method. That seems drastic. They've already collected 48 responses. Maybe it's better to work with that data rather than start over.

Option G is to resend the survey to non-respondents without further communication. But just resending without any encouragement might not increase the response rate much. Maybe following up with a reminder or a phone call would be better.

Option H suggests using the returned surveys and estimating the non-respondents' responses. That sounds like imputation or assuming the non-respondents are similar to respondents. But that's making an assumption which might introduce bias if the non-respondents differ from respondents.

Option I is to randomly select 27 more class members. That would bring the total sample size back to 75. But wait, the original 75 were randomly selected, and 27 didn't respond. Adding another 27 might not be the right approach because those new 27 wouldn't be the same as the original non-respondents. It could change the sample dynamics.

Option J says to follow up with those who didn't respond to encourage them. That makes sense. Sometimes people just need a reminder or a little nudge to respond. Following up could increase the response rate without having to make assumptions or change the sample size.

So, thinking about all the options. The best plan would likely involve trying to get more responses rather than adjusting the sample or making assumptions. Therefore, option J seems like the best approachâ€”encourage the non-respondents to reply by following up with them.

The high school sent a survey to a randomly selected sample of 75 graduates, but only 48 responded. The question asks for the best plan of action to address the 27 non-respondents. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Reducing the confidence level is unnecessary because confidence level is typically set by the researcher (e.g., 95%) and does not change due to sample size. The smaller sample size affects the margin of error, not the confidence level.
- **Option B**: Keeping the sample size at 75 is misleading because only 48 surveys were returned. The actual sample size is 48, and misrepresenting it as 75 would be inaccurate.
- **Option C**: Changing the sample size to 48 is technically correct but may reduce the statistical power of the analysis due to the smaller sample size.
- **Option D**: Selecting another 75 class members would increase the sample size but deviates from the original plan and does not address the issue of non-response from the initial sample.
- **Option E**: Sending the survey to all class members would ensure a larger response rate but may not be practical or necessary if the goal was to analyze a sample.
- **Option F**: Discarding the results and choosing a different method is overly drastic, as 48 responses still provide valuable data.
- **Option G**: Resending the survey without further communication is unlikely to significantly improve the response rate.
- **Option H**: Estimating the responses of non-respondents introduces potential bias, as it assumes non-respondents are similar to respondents.
- **Option I**: Selecting 27 additional class members would restore the sample size to 75 but does not address the original non-respondents and may alter the sample dynamics.
- **Option J**: Following up with non-respondents to encourage them to reply is the most effective approach. It directly addresses the issue of non-response without introducing bias or unnecessary complexity.

The best plan is to follow up with the non-respondents to encourage them to reply, as this approach maximizes the response rate while maintaining the integrity of the original sample.
