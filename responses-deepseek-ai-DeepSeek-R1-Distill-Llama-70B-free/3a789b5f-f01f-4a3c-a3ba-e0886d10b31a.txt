Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Define language. List and define its elements.

Options:

A: Language is the visual representation of ideas through art. The elements include: lines, shapes, colors, and textures.
B: Language is the genetic transmission of information from parent to offspring. The elements include: genes, chromosomes, DNA, and mutations.
C: Language is the written form of communication using an alphabet. The elements include: letters, words, punctuation, and grammar.
D: Language is the complex arrangement of sounds that have accepted referents and can be arranged to derive meanings. The units of language include: phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and prosody.
E: Language is a tool for communication
F: Language is the process of transferring thoughts through telepathy. The elements include: sender, receiver, thought waves, and mental clarity.
G: Language is the combination of words to form sentences
H: Language is a system of gestures used exclusively by primates. The elements include: signals, movements, expressions, and gestures.
I: Language is the use of signs and symbols
J: Language is the method of communication using mathematical symbols and numbers. The elements include: numerals, equations, operations, and proofs.

Okay, so I've got this question about defining language and listing its elements. Hmm, I remember from my classes that language is a system of communication, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through each option.

Option A says language is visual through art. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Language is more about words and sounds, not just art. Plus, the elements like lines and colors are more related to visual arts, not language itself.

Option B talks about genetic transmission. Oh, that's more like biology, like how genes pass on information. Definitely not language as we know it.

Option C mentions the written form with alphabet elements. Well, written language is part of it, but language itself isn't just the written form. There's also spoken language, so this might be too narrow.

Option D describes a complex arrangement of sounds with units like phonemes and morphemes. I think phonemes are the smallest sound units, and morphemes are the smallest meaning units. Syntax is how words are arranged, and prosody is about the rhythm and intonation. That sounds comprehensive, covering both sound and structure.

Option E is too vague. It just says language is a tool for communication, which is true, but the question asks for a definition and elements, so E probably isn't the best choice.

Option F is about telepathy. That's more science fiction, right? Language doesn't rely on thought waves.

Option G says it's combining words into sentences. That's part of it, like syntax, but it doesn't cover all the elements, like sounds or meanings.

Option H refers to gestures used by primates. That's more like animal communication, not human language, which is more complex.

Option I is about signs and symbols. While language does use symbols, like words, this option doesn't list the specific elements like phonemes or syntax.

Option J is about math symbols. That's a different system altogether, not language in the traditional sense.

So putting it all together, the best answer is D. It defines language accurately with its elements like phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and prosody.

The correct answer is:

D: Language is the complex arrangement of sounds that have accepted referents and can be arranged to derive meanings. The units of language include: phonemes, morphemes, syntax, and prosody.
