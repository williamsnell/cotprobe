Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the rate of return on a preferred stock. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says it's a 5 and a half percent preferred stock. Oh wait, 5(1/2)% means 5.5%, right? Because 1/2 is 0.5. So the dividend is 5.5% of the par value each year.

The par value is $50. So I guess the annual dividend would be 5.5% of $50. Let me calculate that. 5.5% as a decimal is 0.055. So 0.055 multiplied by 50. Let's see, 50 times 0.05 is 2.5, and 50 times 0.005 is 0.25, so adding them gives 2.75. So the dividend is $2.75 per share each year.

Now, the stock is selling for 52 and 3/4 dollars. Oh wait, 52(3/4) is the same as 52.75. So the market price is $52.75 per share.

The rate of return, I think, is the dividend divided by the market price. Because rate of return on a stock is usually the dividend yield, which is annual dividends per share divided by the price per share.

So putting it together, the rate of return is $2.75 divided by $52.75. Let me do that division. 2.75 ÷ 52.75. Hmm, maybe I can approximate this.

Let me think about it. 52.75 times 0.05 is 2.6375. Because 52.75 * 0.05 is 2.6375. Oh wait, but 2.75 is a bit more than that. So 0.05 gives me 2.6375, and I have 2.75, which is 0.1125 more. So how much more in terms of percentage?

Hmm, maybe I should just do the division properly. Let me set it up. 2.75 ÷ 52.75. Let's compute this.

Alternatively, I can simplify the numbers. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals. So 275 ÷ 5275.

Wait, maybe I can simplify this fraction. Let's see, both are divisible by 25. 275 ÷25 is 11, and 5275 ÷25 is 211. So now it's 11/211.

Hmm, 11 divided by 211. Let me calculate that. 211 goes into 11 zero times. Add a decimal point, make it 110. 211 goes into 110 0 times. So 0.0... Maybe I should use a calculator approach here.

Wait, 211 × 0.05 is 10.55. Oh, so 0.05 is 10.55. But 11 is a bit higher than that. So 0.05 is 10.55, so the difference is 0.45. So how much more than 0.05 do I need to get 0.45 more?

Each 0.001 is 0.211. So 0.45 ÷ 0.211 ≈ 2.13. So approximately 0.05 + 0.00213 = 0.05213, which is about 5.213%. So approximately 5.2%.

Wait, but let me check that. Because 211 × 0.052 is 211 × 5.2%. Let me compute 211 × 0.052. 200 ×0.052 is 10.4, 11×0.052 is 0.572, so total 10.972. But 11 is the numerator, so 10.972 is less than 11. So 0.052 gives us 10.972, which is less than 11. The difference is 11 -10.972 = 0.028. So how much more?

Each 0.001 is 0.211, so 0.028 ÷0.211 ≈0.1327. So adding 0.001327 to 0.052 gives approximately 0.053327, which is 5.3327%. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was around 5.2%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should just do the division step by step. Let's try that.

Compute 2.75 ÷52.75.

First, 52.75 goes into 275 how many times? Let's see, 52.75 ×5 is 263.75, right? Because 50×5=250, 2.75×5=13.75, so 250+13.75=263.75. So 5 times, with a remainder of 275 -263.75 = 11.25.

So now, I bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals after the point), making it 112.5. Now, 52.75 goes into 112.5 twice. Because 52.75 ×2 is 105.5. Subtracting gives 112.5 -105.5 =7.0.

Bring down another zero, making it 70.0. 52.75 goes into 70 once. 52.75 ×1=52.75. Subtracting gives 70-52.75=17.25.

Bring down another zero, making it 172.5. 52.75 ×3 is 158.25. So subtract 158.25 from 172.5 gives 14.25.

Bring down a zero, making it 142.5. 52.75 ×2 is 105.5, subtract that from 142.5 gives 37.0.

Bring down another zero, making it 370. 52.75 ×7 is 369.25. That leaves a remainder of 0.75.

So putting it all together, the division gives 0.052... Wait, because up to this point:

We had 5 (from 275 ÷52.75), then after the decimal, 5. Then 2, then 1, then 3, then 2, then 7... So the decimal would be 5.0213... approximately.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have mixed up the steps.

Wait, when I started, 52.75 goes into 275 five times, which is 5. So the first digit is 5, but that's the units place. Wait no, because 52.75 is larger than 2.75, so we're dealing with 2.75 as the dividend and 52.75 as the divisor. So it's less than 1, which is why I had to add a decimal point and start with 27.5 divided by 52.75.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me write it as 2.75 ÷52.75 = ?

Alternatively, I can think of it as 275 ÷5275, since multiplying numerator and denominator by 100. So 275 ÷5275.

Let me try this division. 5275 goes into 275 zero times. So we write 0. and then see how many times 5275 goes into 2750. 5275 × 0.5 is 2637.5. So 0.5 is 2637.5, which is less than 2750. The difference is 2750 -2637.5 = 112.5.

Bring down a zero, making it 1125.0. 5275 goes into 1125.0 about 0.213 times. Because 5275 × 0.2 is 1055. So 0.2 gives 1055. Subtracting from 1125 gives 70.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, maybe I should use an approximate method.

Let me try another approach: cross-multiplied percentage.

We know that (dividend) / (market price) = rate of return.

So 2.75 / 52.75 = x.

Let me approximate 2.75 as approximately 2.75 and 52.75 as approximately 53.

2.75 /53 is roughly equal to 0.0519, or 5.19%. So about 5.2%.

Looking at the options, option F is 5.2%, option D is 5.5%, and option H is 5.0%.

Wait, but I'm getting approximately 5.2%, so that would be option F.

Alternatively, let me make a more accurate calculation.

2.75 ÷52.75.

Let me write it as 2.75 ÷52.75 = ?

Well, 52.75 × 0.05 = 2.6375.

So 0.05 gives 2.6375, which is less than 2.75 by 0.1125.

So the remaining 0.1125 needs to be divided by 52.75.

0.1125 ÷52.75 = approximately 0.00213.

So total is approximately 0.05 + 0.00213 = 0.05213, which is 5.213%. So about 5.21%, which rounds to 5.2% when rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.

So the answer should be 5.2%, which is option F.

To calculate the rate of return on the preferred stock, we use the formula for dividend yield:

\[
\text{Rate of Return} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividend}}{\text{Market Price}}
\]

1. **Determine the Annual Dividend**:  
   The stock has a par value of $50 and a dividend rate of \(5\frac{1}{2}\%\), which is \(5.5\%\).  
   \[
   \text{Annual Dividend} = 5.5\% \times 50 = 0.055 \times 50 = 2.75
   \]

2. **Market Price**:  
   The stock is selling for \(52\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(52.75\).

3. **Calculate the Rate of Return**:  
   \[
   \text{Rate of Return} = \frac{2.75}{52.75}
   \]  
   Performing the division:  
   \[
   2.75 \div 52.75 \approx 0.05213 \, \text{or} \, 5.213\%
   \]

4. **Round to the Nearest Tenth of a Percent**:  
   \(5.213\%\) rounds to \(5.2\%\).

From the given options, the closest match is **5.2%**, which corresponds to **Option F**.

Answer: F
