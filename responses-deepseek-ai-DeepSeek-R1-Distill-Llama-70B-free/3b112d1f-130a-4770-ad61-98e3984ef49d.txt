Okay, so I have this question here about types of errors, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about errors in measurements or experiments.

I remember that there are a few main types of errors: gross errors, systematic errors, and random errors. Each has different causes and effects on results.

Gross errors are the big mistakes that happen because of carelessness or lack of attention. Like, if someone reads a measurement wrong or mixes up numbers. These are usually easy to spot and fix because they stand out once you check the data.

Systematic errors, on the other hand, are consistent and repeatable. They happen because of a flaw in the method or equipment. For example, if a scale is calibrated wrong, every measurement taken with it will be off by the same amount. These are harder to find because they affect all the data the same way.

Random errors are just the variations that happen in measurements due to unpredictable factors. They can be minimized by taking multiple measurements and averaging them out.

The question is asking which type of error is mainly caused by human mistakes. So, I'm thinking about each option. Gross error is definitely about mistakes, like a person reading a number wrong. Systematic errors are more about the setup or equipment, not necessarily human error. Instrumental error would relate to the tools used, like a broken instrument giving wrong readings, but that's more about the device than the person using it.

Wait, the options are A: gross error, B: instrumental error, C: systematic error. So the question is between A and the others. Since human mistakes are the cause, the answer should be A: gross error.

The question asks which type of error is mainly caused by human mistakes. Gross errors (A) are directly tied to human oversight, such as incorrect readings or data recording. Systematic errors (C) stem from methodical or equipment issues, while instrumental errors (B) relate to device malfunctions. Thus, the correct answer is:

A

Answer: A
