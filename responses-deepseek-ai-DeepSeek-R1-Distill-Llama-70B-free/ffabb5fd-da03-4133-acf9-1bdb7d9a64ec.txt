Question:

A salesman, who had worked 20 years for the same company, was suddenly terminated for no apparent reason. Thereafter, the salesman sued the company, alleging age discrimination. At trial, he wants to call an employee of the company as an adverse witness. The salesman seeks to have the employee testify that she was present at a company board meeting when the company's president allegedly said, "Now, I'm sure that everyone agrees that the salesman is too old, and he really doesn't typify the image we want our employees to project. " It is the common practice of the company to tape record all such board meetings. Moreover, it is customary for the company's secretary to transcribe the tapes following the board meetings. Upon objection by the company's attomey, the employee's proposed testimony will be held

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the secretary's transcribed notes are the best evidence.
B: inadmissible, because the president's statement is not relevant to the case.
C: admissible, because the employee was present during the board meeting.
D: admissible, because the president's statement is direct evidence of age discrimination.
E: admissible, because the president's statement was an admission by a company representative.
F: inadmissible, because the employee is biased against the company.
G: inadmissible, because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.
H: admissible, because the employee's testimony corroborates the salesman's claim.
I: inadmissible, because the employee's testimony is hearsay.
J: admissible, because the employee's testimony is crucial to proving age discrimination.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question for my law class. Let me read through it again carefully. 

The situation is a salesman who worked 20 years for the same company got terminated and is suing for age discrimination. He wants to call an employee as an adverse witness. The employee would testify that she was at a board meeting where the president said something about the salesman being too old and not fitting the company image. The company usually tapes these meetings, and the secretary transcribes them afterward. The company's attorney objected, so we need to determine if the employee's testimony is admissible.

Hmm. The question is about the admissibility of the employee's testimony. The options are from A to J. I think I remember something about the best evidence rule and hearsay.

First, the best evidence rule, which is FRE 1002, requires that the original document be produced if the content is in question. But there's an exception when the original is lost, destroyed, or unobtainable. Also, I think that the best evidence rule applies to writings, recordings, or photographs. So if the company tapes the meetings, and they have a transcript, maybe the tape or transcript would be the best evidence. But wait, the employee is testifying about what she heard the president say. So she's a witness to the statement, not testifying about the content of the tape or transcript. So the best evidence rule might not apply here because she's testifying to what she personally heard, not to the content of a recording or document. So options A and G, which mention best evidence, might be incorrect because the testimony is about her personal knowledge, not the recording.

Next, the statement itself. The president's statement is being offered to prove that the company discriminated against the salesman based on age. That seems relevant. So option B says it's inadmissible because not relevant. I don't think that's right because the statement directly relates to the discrimination claim, so it's relevant.

Option C says admissible because she was present. Well, presence is important, but that alone doesn't make it admissible. She needs to have personal knowledge, which she does as she was there. But there's more to it.

Option D: direct evidence. The president's statement could be direct evidence of discrimination. That might be a strong point because direct evidence shows the discriminatory motive without inference. So that's a possibility.

Option E: admission by a company representative. Under FRE 801(d)(2)(D), statements by an opposing party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of employment and during employment are not hearsay and are admissible. So the president's statement would qualify as an admission. So the employee's testimony about the president's statement would be admissible as a party admission, making it not hearsay. So option E might be correct.

Option F: bias. The employee being adverse doesn't necessarily make her testimony inadmissible. It's a factor in credibility, but the testimony itself is still admissible. So F is probably not the right answer.

Option H: corroborates the claim. While it does, that's not the legal reason for admissibility. The reason is more about the nature of the statement.

Option I: hearsay. Wait, the employee's testimony is about what the president said. So is that hearsay? Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. But under the admission exception, since the president is a company representative, his statement is an admission and not hearsay. So I is incorrect because it's not hearsay.

Option J: crucial to proving discrimination. While true, the admissibility isn't based on how crucial it is, but on the rules. So J isn't the reason.

Putting it together: The employee's testimony is about a statement made by the company's president, which is an admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(D). Therefore, it's not hearsay and is admissible. So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. The best evidence rule applies when you're proving the content of a writing or recording. Here, the employee is testifying to what she heard, not to the content of the tape. So the best evidence rule doesn't require the tape to be produced in this situation. So A and G are incorrect.

Yes, so E is correct because it's an admission by a party opponent.

The question revolves around the admissibility of an employee's testimony regarding a statement made by the company's president during a board meeting, which the salesman alleges constitutes direct evidence of age discrimination. The key issues involve the best evidence rule, relevance, and whether the statement qualifies as an admission by a party opponent.

1. **Best Evidence Rule (Options A and G):** The best evidence rule requires the original document, recording, or photograph to be produced when the content is at issue. However, in this case, the employee is testifying about what she personally heard, not the content of the tape or transcript. Therefore, the best evidence rule does not apply, making these options incorrect.

2. **Relevance (Option B):** The president's statement is highly relevant as it directly pertains to the salesman's claim of age discrimination. Thus, this option is incorrect.

3. **Presence at the Meeting (Option C):** While the employee's presence at the meeting is a factor, it alone does not determine admissibility. This option is insufficient on its own.

4. **Direct Evidence (Option D):** The president's statement could be considered direct evidence of discrimination, but this is not the primary legal basis for admissibility in this context.

5. **Admission by a Party Opponent (Option E):** Under FRE 801(d)(2)(D), statements made by an opposing party's agent or employee, within the scope of employment and during employment, are admissible as non-hearsay. The president's statement qualifies as such an admission, making this the correct answer.

6. **Bias (Option F):** While the employee's potential bias may affect credibility, it does not render the testimony inadmissible. This option is incorrect.

7. **Corroboration (Option H):** Although the testimony corroborates the salesman's claim, this is not the legal reason for admissibility.

8. **Hearsay (Option I):** The statement is not hearsay because it qualifies as an admission by a party opponent under FRE 801(d)(2)(D).

9. **Crucial Evidence (Option J):** While the testimony is crucial, admissibility is determined by legal rules, not by how critical the evidence is.

The correct answer is **E**, as the president's statement is an admission by a company representative and is admissible under the rules of evidence.

**Answer: E**
