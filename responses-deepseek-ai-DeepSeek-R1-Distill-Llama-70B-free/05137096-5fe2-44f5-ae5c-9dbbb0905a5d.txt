Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting problem here. Let me read it again.

Arno Co. didn't record a credit purchase of merchandise before the end of the year. But the merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory. I need to find out how this affects the balance sheet, specifically looking at assets and liabilities.

Hmm. So, when a company buys merchandise on credit, that should be recorded as a purchase. But in this case, they didn't record it. So what's the normal transaction for a credit purchase? I think it's something like debiting Merchandise Inventory (asset) and crediting Accounts Payable (liability). So if they didn't record the purchase, both of these accounts wouldn't be updated.

Wait, but the inventory was included in the physical count. So that means the inventory balance on the balance sheet is correct because they counted it. But what about the accounts payable? Since the purchase wasn't recorded, accounts payable wouldn't show an increase. So the liability side is understated.

Let's break it down: 

Normally, when you buy on credit, inventory (asset) goes up and accounts payable (liability) goes up. If you don't record the purchase, what happens? The accounts payable isn't recorded, so it's lower than it should be. But the inventory was counted physically, so that part is correct. 

So on the balance sheet, assets would be correct because the inventory is accurate. Liabilities, however, are understated because the accounts payable isn't reflecting the credit purchase.

Wait, but let me think again. Since the purchase wasn't recorded, the accounts payable wouldn't have been increased. So the balance sheet at year end would show the correct amount of inventory (because it's physically there) but a lower accounts payable than there should be. So the liability is understated.

So for the balance sheet, the asset (inventory) is correct, and the liability (accounts payable) is understated.

Looking back at the question, it's asking about the effect on the balance sheet at year end. So the assets would be correct (no effect) and the liabilities would be understated.

So the options are looking for Assets and Liabilities. The first part is assets, second is liabilities.

Looking at the options:

Option C says No effect Understated. That fits. Because assets are not affected (inventory is correct), and liabilities are understated because the accounts payable is lower than it should be.

Another way to think: The purchase was not recorded, so the expense (cost of goods sold) might also be affected, but the question is about the balance sheet, not the income statement.

Wait, actually, the purchase affects the balance sheet, not the income statement directly. The inventory is an asset, and accounts payable is a liability. So if the purchase isn't recorded, the accounts payable is too low, making liabilities understated. But the inventory was counted, so the asset is correct.

So yeah, assets are unaffected, and liabilities are understated. So the answer should be option C.

When Arno Co. failed to record a credit purchase of merchandise prior to year-end, but the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, the following effects on the balance sheet occurred:

1. **Assets**: Since the merchandise was included in the physical inventory, the inventory balance on the balance sheet is accurate. Therefore, there is no effect on assets.

2. **Liabilities**: The credit purchase was not recorded, so Accounts Payable was not updated to reflect the liability. As a result, liabilities are understated.

Thus, the balance sheet reflects no effect on assets and an understatement of liabilities.

The correct answer is **C: No effect Understated**.
