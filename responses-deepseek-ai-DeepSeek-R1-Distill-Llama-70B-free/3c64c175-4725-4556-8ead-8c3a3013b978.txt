Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the vibrational contribution to the molar internal energy of a gas. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question gives a formula for U, the molar internal energy due to vibrations, which is U_m,vib equals R multiplied by a sum over all the modes. Each term is theta_s divided by (e^(theta_s/T) - 1), and theta_s is h nu_s over k. Oh right, and nu_s is the vibrational frequency of each normal mode.

Wait, the question is asking me to calculate the contribution of a single normal mode. So I don't have to sum over all 3N-6 modes, just compute one term. The given wavenumber is 900 cm^-1. I think wavenumber is related to frequency by c, the speed of light. Oh right, because wavenumber tilde nu is nu/c. So nu = c * tilde nu.

But wait, I need to find theta_s, which is h nu_s / k. Let me jot down the values I need. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, which is 298 K. The wavenumber is 900 cm^-1, so I need the Planck constant h, Boltzmann constant k, and the speed of light c.

Let me get the constants together. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Boltzmann constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Speed of light c is about 3e10 cm/s? Wait wait, no. Wait, c is usually 3e8 m/s, but in cm/s that would be 3e10 cm/s. Right, because 1 m is 100 cm, so 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s.

So nu_s is c multiplied by tilde nu. Wait, the units of tilde nu is cm^-1, so when I multiply by c (cm/s), I get nu in s^-1. Oh right, because tilde nu = nu/c, so nu = c * tilde nu.

So, let me compute nu_s first. c is 3e10 cm/s, tilde nu is 900 cm^-1. So nu_s = 3e10 * 900 = 2.7e13 s^-1. Hmm, that seems high, but I think that's correct for vibrational frequencies.

Now theta_s is h nu_s / k. Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
nu_s = 2.7e13 s^-1
k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So theta_s = (6.626e-34 * 2.7e13) / 1.38e-23

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 2.7e13 = 6.626 * 2.7 is approximately 17.9, and 1e-34 * 1e13 is 1e-21. So 17.9e-21 J.

Then divide by 1.38e-23: 17.9e-21 / 1.38e-23 = (17.9 / 1.38) * 1e2. 17.9 /1.38 is about 13 (since 1.38 *13 is 17.94). So 13 *1e2 = 1300. So theta_s is approximately 1300 K.

Wait, but wait. Because in the formula, theta_s is in terms of temperature. So the exponent is theta_s divided by T. T is 298 K.

So the exponent here is 1300 / 298. Let me calculate that. 1300 / 300 is about 4.333, but since it's 298, which is slightly less than 300, so the result is a bit higher. Let's compute 1300 / 298. 298 *4 = 1192. 1300-1192=108. 108/298 is about 0.362. So total is about 4.362.

So the term inside the exponential is e^(4.362). Let's calculate e^4.362. I know e^4 is about 54.598, e^0.362 is e^0.3 is ~1.3498, e^0.06 is ~1.0618. So 1.3498 * 1.0618 ≈ 1.432. So e^4.362 ≈54.598 *1.432 ≈ let me compute that. 54 *1.432 is about 77.3, and 0.598*1.432 is about 0.856. So total around 78.16.

Wait, but wait, exact calculation might be better. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator approach here, but since this is a thought process, let me proceed.

So the denominator is e^(theta_s/T) -1 ≈ 78.16 -1 =77.16.

Now the term theta_s/(e^(theta_s/T)-1) is 1300 /77.16. Let's compute that. 77.16 *16 is about 1234.56. 77.16 *16.8 is 77.16*(16 +0.8)=77.16*16=1234.56 +77.16*0.8=61.728 → total 1296.29. So 16.8 gives 1296.29, which is close to 1300. So it's approximately 16.8 plus (3.71/77.16) → 3.71/77.16≈0.048 → 16.848.

So the term is approximately 16.85.

But wait, the molar internal energy is R multiplied by this. R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So U_m,vib is 8.314 * 16.85.

Let me compute 8 *16.85 =134.8, 0.314 *16.85 = approx 5.30, so total around 140.1 J/mol. Hmm, but wait, wait a second. Let me compute it more accurately.

8.314 *16.85 → 8 *16.85=134.8, 0.314 *16.85=5.2979. So sum is 134.8 +5.2979=140.0979 J/mol. So 140 J/mol, which is 0.140 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait, the options are in kJ/mol. So 140 J = 0.140 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, option J is 0.14 kJ/mol.

But wait, did I make any miscalculations? Let me double-check.

Wait, let's recompute theta_s more accurately. Let me compute h nu_s / k again.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, nu_s is 2.7e13 Hz (since 900 cm^-1 * 3e10 cm/s = 2.7e13 s^-1).

h nu_s = 6.626e-34 * 2.7e13 = let's compute 6.626 *2.7 = 17.8852, and 1e-34 *1e13 is 1e-21. So 17.8852e-21 J.

Divide by k (1.38e-23 J/K):

17.8852e-21 / 1.38e-23 = (17.8852)/(1.38) * 1e2.

17.8852 /1.38 → let's compute that. 1.38 *13 is 17.94, which is a bit more than 17.8852. So approximately 12.97.

So 12.97 * 1e2 → 1297 K. So theta_s ≈ 1297 K.

Then theta_s / T = 1297 / 298 ≈ let's compute this. 298 *4 = 1192, 1297-1192=105. 105/298 ≈ 0.3527. So 4.3527.

e^(4.3527) → what is that? Let's compute e^4 is 54.598, e^0.3527 is about e^0.35 is approximately 1.419. So 54.598 *1.419 ≈ let's compute that.

54 *1.419 =76.626, 0.598 *1.419≈0.598*1.4=0.837, 0.598*0.019≈0.01136. So 0.837+0.01136=0.848. So total is 76.626+0.848=77.474.

So denominator is 77.474 -1 =76.474.

So term is theta_s / (e^(theta/T) -1) =1297 /76.474 ≈ let's compute that.

76.474 *16= 1223.584. 1297 -1223.584=73.416. 73.416 /76.474 ≈0.96. So 16 +0.96=16.96.

So term is approximately 16.96.

Multiply by R (8.314 J/mol·K):

8.314 *16.96 → Let's compute. 8 *16.96=135.68, 0.314*16.96≈5.329. Sum is 135.68 +5.329=140.009 J/mol → 0.140 kJ/mol.

So the correct answer is option J: 0.14 kJ/mol.

To calculate the contribution of a single vibrational mode to the molar internal energy $U_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{vib}}$ at $25^\circ \mathrm{C}$ (298 K), we use the given formula:

\[
U_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{vib}} = R \sum_{s=1}^{3N-6} \frac{\theta_s}{e^{\theta_s / T} - 1}
\]

Here, $\theta_s \equiv \frac{h \nu_s}{k}$, where $\nu_s$ is the vibrational frequency, $h$ is Planck's constant, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The wavenumber $\widetilde{\nu}$ is related to $\nu_s$ by $\nu_s = c \widetilde{\nu}$, where $c$ is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate $\nu_s$
The wavenumber is given as $\widetilde{\nu} = 900 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Using $c = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm/s}$:

\[
\nu_s = c \cdot \widetilde{\nu} = (3 \times 10^{10}) \cdot 900 = 2.7 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate $\theta_s$
Using $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}$ and $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K}$:

\[
\theta_s = \frac{h \nu_s}{k} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{13})}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
h \nu_s = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{13}) = 1.78922 \times 10^{-20} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Now divide by $k$:

\[
\theta_s = \frac{1.78922 \times 10^{-20}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1297 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $\frac{\theta_s}{e^{\theta_s / T} - 1}$
The temperature is $T = 298 \, \mathrm{K}$. First, compute $\theta_s / T$:

\[
\frac{\theta_s}{T} = \frac{1297}{298} \approx 4.3527
\]

Next, calculate $e^{\theta_s / T}$:

\[
e^{4.3527} \approx 77.474
\]

Now compute the denominator:

\[
e^{\theta_s / T} - 1 = 77.474 - 1 = 76.474
\]

Finally, calculate the term:

\[
\frac{\theta_s}{e^{\theta_s / T} - 1} = \frac{1297}{76.474} \approx 16.96
\]

### Step 4: Multiply by $R$
The gas constant is $R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}$. Multiply:

\[
U_{\mathrm{m}, \mathrm{vib}} = R \cdot 16.96 = 8.314 \cdot 16.96 \approx 140.01 \, \mathrm{J/mol} = 0.140 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

### Final Answer
The contribution of the vibrational mode to the molar internal energy is approximately **0.14 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to option **J**.
