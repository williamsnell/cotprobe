Okay, so I've got this question about semiconductors, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The question is asking which of the options is an n-type semiconductor. The options are A through J. I remember that semiconductors can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic are pure semiconductors without any doping, and extrinsic are doped with impurities, which change their electrical properties.

n-type semiconductors are made by doping a semiconductor material with an element that has more valence electrons than the semiconductor. Silicon, for example, is in group IV of the periodic table. So if I dope it with a group V element, like phosphorus or arsenic, it should create an n-type semiconductor because each dopant atom contributes an extra electron.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Silicon. Wait, silicon by itself is an intrinsic semiconductor, not n-type. So I don't think this is the right answer.

Option B: Boron-doped silicon. Boron is in group III. Doping silicon with boron would create a p-type semiconductor because it would introduce holes. So B is p-type, not n-type.

Option C: Pure germanium. Germanium is another group IV element, so pure germanium is intrinsic, not n-type.

Option D: Arsenic-doped silicon. Arsenic is in group V. So when silicon (group IV) is doped with arsenic, each arsenic atom replaces a silicon atom and has an extra electron. This would make it n-type. So D seems like a good candidate.

Option E: Indium Phosphide. I'm not too sure about this one. Indium is group III, phosphorus group V. So InP is a compound semiconductor. Wait, but the question is about whether it's n-type. I think InP can be either depending on doping, but I'm not certain if it's inherently n-type. I'll have to think more about this.

Option F: Zinc-doped silicon. Zinc is a group II element. Doping silicon with zinc would introduce acceptor states, making it p-type. So F is p-type.

Option G: Pure silicon. Like option A, this is intrinsic, not n-type.

Option H: Gallium arsenide. Ga is group III and As is group V. GaAs is a compound semiconductor used in various applications, but again, whether it's n-type depends on doping. I'm not sure if it's inherently n-type. Maybe it's more about the doping.

Option I: Silicon carbide. SiC is a semiconductor, but I think it's often used as a wide bandgap material. Not sure about whether it's n-type unless specified.

Option J: Diamond. Diamond is a form of carbon, which is group IV. It's an intrinsic semiconductor but not n-type unless doped.

So going back, the correct answer should be the one where the semiconductor is doped with a group V element. In this case, option D is arsenic-doped silicon. Arsenic is group V, so this would create an n-type semiconductor.

Wait, what about option E? Indium phosphide (InP) is a III-V semiconductor. In its pure form, is it n-type or p-type? I think InP is typically a p-type semiconductor when undoped because of defects, but I'm not entirely sure. But the question is about which option is an n-type, so unless it's doped with a donor element, it wouldn't be n-type. Since the option just says "Indium Phosphide" without specifying doping, I'm not sure. But I think the more straightforward answer is D.

So the correct choice is D: Arsenic-doped silicon.

To determine which option represents an n-type semiconductor, we analyze the materials based on their doping and intrinsic properties. n-type semiconductors are created by doping a group IV semiconductor (like silicon) with a group V element, which introduces excess electrons.

- **Option A: Silicon** - Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, not n-type.  
- **Option B: Boron-doped silicon** - Boron (group III) creates a p-type semiconductor by introducing holes.  
- **Option C: Pure germanium** - Like silicon, pure germanium is intrinsic, not n-type.  
- **Option D: Arsenic-doped silicon** - Arsenic (group V) donates excess electrons when doped into silicon, making it n-type. This is a strong candidate.  
- **Option E: Indium Phosphide** - InP is a III-V compound semiconductor, but its type (n or p) depends on doping. The question does not specify doping, so this is less likely to be the correct answer.  
- **Option F: Zinc-doped silicon** - Zinc (group II) introduces acceptor states, making it p-type.  
- **Option G: Pure silicon** - Like option A, this is intrinsic, not n-type.  
- **Option H: Gallium arsenide** - GaAs is a III-V semiconductor, but its type depends on doping, which is not specified here.  
- **Option I: Silicon carbide** - SiC is a wide bandgap semiconductor but not inherently n-type unless doped.  
- **Option J: Diamond** - Diamond is an intrinsic semiconductor unless doped.  

The correct answer is **D: Arsenic-doped silicon**, as arsenic (group V) donates electrons, creating an n-type semiconductor.
