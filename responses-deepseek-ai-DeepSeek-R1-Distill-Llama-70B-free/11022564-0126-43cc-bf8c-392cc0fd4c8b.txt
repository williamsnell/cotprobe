Okay, so I have this economics question here about fiscal policy and recessionary gaps. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about a drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap. The options are A to D. I remember that fiscal policy involves government spending and taxation to influence the economy. A recessionary gap occurs when the overall level of economic activity is below potential GDP, leading to higher unemployment and lower incomes.

So, when the government uses fiscal policy to address a recessionary gap, they can either increase government spending or cut taxes. Both actions aim to boost aggregate demand to move the economy back towards potential GDP. But what's the downside here?

Option A: Unemployment will rise. Wait, using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap should actually reduce unemployment because increased demand leads to more jobs. So A doesn't seem like a correct drawback.

Option B: Taxes will have to be raised. No, because during a recession, the government is more likely to cut taxes to increase disposable income and consumption. Raising taxes would take money out of people's pockets, which isn't helpful in a recession. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: The equilibrium price level will rise. Oh, right, when aggregate demand increases due to fiscal policy, if the economy is below potential, prices might not rise much. But once it approaches potential, further increases could cause inflation. So as fiscal policy stimulates the economy, it might lead to higher prices, which is a possible drawback. That makes sense.

Option D: Government spending on important programs will have to be cut. No, that's the opposite. To close a recessionary gap, the government would increase spending, not cut it. So D is incorrect.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. So the question is about the drawback. So, when the government increases spending or cuts taxes, the economy moves towards potential GDP. But once it's near potential, further spending could push it into an inflationary gap, causing prices to rise. So option C is about the equilibrium price level rising, which is a correct concern. Another possible issue is the increase in government debt, but that's not one of the options here.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question asks about a drawback of using fiscal policy to close a recessionary gap. Fiscal policy typically involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes to boost aggregate demand and move the economy toward potential GDP. However, a potential downside is that as aggregate demand increases, it can lead to higher price levels, especially if the economy is near or exceeds potential GDP. This risk of inflation is a valid concern.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Fiscal policy aimed at closing a recessionary gap should reduce unemployment, not increase it.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Taxes are more likely to be cut during a recession to stimulate demand, not raised.
- **Option C**: Correct. Increased aggregate demand from fiscal policy can lead to a rise in the equilibrium price level, potentially causing inflation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Government spending is increased, not cut, to address a recessionary gap.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
