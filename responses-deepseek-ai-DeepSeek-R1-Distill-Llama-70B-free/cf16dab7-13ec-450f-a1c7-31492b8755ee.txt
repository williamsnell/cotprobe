Okay, so I need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 36 and 90. Hmm, I remember that the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, maybe I should list the factors of each number and then find the largest one they have in common. Let's start with 36. The factors of 36 are the numbers that can divide 36 evenly. So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Right, that's all of them.

Now for 90. Let's list its factors. Starting from 1, 90 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90. Wait, did I miss any? Let me check: 90 divided by 4 is 22.5, which isn't an integer, so 4 isn't a factor. 7? 90/7 is about 12.85, so no. 8? 90/8 is 11.25, not an integer. Okay, so the factors I listed are correct.

Now, I need to find the common factors between 36 and 90. Let's see. Comparing both lists:

Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.

The common ones are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18. What's the largest among these? Oh right, it's 18. So the GCF should be 18.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember another method using prime factorization. Maybe I should try that to confirm. Let's break down both numbers into their prime factors.

Starting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18. Again by 2 is 9. 9 is 3 squared. So the prime factors of 36 are 2^2 * 3^2.

Now 90: 90 divided by 2 is 45. 45 divided by 3 is 15, then 5. So 90 is 2 * 3^2 * 5.

To find the GCF, I take the lowest power of all common primes. So for 2: the lowest is 2^1. For 3: lowest is 3^2. Multiply them together: 2 * 9 = 18. Yep, same result as before.

So the GCF is 18. Looking at the options, I is 18. So the answer should be I.

The greatest common factor (GCF) of 36 and 90 is found by identifying the largest number that divides both without a remainder. Listing the factors of each:

- Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36  
- Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90  

The common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The largest is 18. Confirming with prime factorization:

- 36 = 2² × 3²  
- 90 = 2 × 3² × 5  

The GCF is the product of the lowest powers of common primes: 2¹ × 3² = 18. Thus, the GCF is 18.
