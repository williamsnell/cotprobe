Question:

In the 1960s, comprehensive schools did not eradicate class inequalities in education because:

Options:

A: selective schools could still 'cream off' the most able pupils, while the comprehensives put children into ability streams
B: the comprehensive schools did not have the capacity to accommodate all students, leading to overcrowding and reduced quality of education
C: the comprehensive schools were mostly located in affluent neighborhoods, limiting access for working class students
D: teachers in comprehensive schools used the restricted code in the classroom, whereas working class pupils used elaborated codes of speech
E: the segregation between working class and middle class in comprehensive schools was still very apparent
F: they tended to recruit pupils from the inner cities and traditionally working class areas
G: comprehensive schools did not have sufficient funding to provide quality education to all students
H: comprehensive schools did not offer advanced courses, limiting the educational opportunities for gifted students

Okay, so I've got this question about comprehensive schools in the 1960s and why they didn't eliminate class inequalities in education. Hmm, I remember that comprehensive schools were supposed to be a more inclusive alternative to the selective school system, like grammar schools and secondary moderns. The idea was that everyone goes to the same school, so it's more equal, right?

But the question is saying that they didn't eradicate class inequalities. So I need to think about why that happened. Let me look at the options.

Option A says selective schools could still cream off the most able pupils, while comprehensives used ability streams. Wait, I thought comprehensive schools were non-selective, but maybe some areas still had selective schools alongside? So the comprehensives might have been streaming students into different ability groups. Streaming can lead to inequality because kids from different backgrounds might be placed in lower streams, even if they're capable. That could mean middle-class kids are in higher streams, getting better opportunities.

Option B is about capacity and overcrowding. I don't remember overcrowding being the main issue. The problem was more about structure rather than physical space. So maybe not B.

Option C says comprehensives were in affluent areas. I think actually, comprehensives were often in urban or mixed areas. Middle-class families might have moved to areas with better schools, but I'm not sure if location was the main barrier. Not sure about this one.

Option D mentions restricted code and elaborated codes. Oh, that's from Basil Bernstein's theories. Restricted code is used by working-class people, more verbal and context-dependent, while elaborated code is middle-class, more explicit and formal. If teachers used restricted code, but that's the opposite of what Bernstein said. Wait, no, Bernstein said teachers use elaborated code, which working-class students struggle with. So D says teachers used restricted, which doesn't seem right. Maybe D is incorrect.

Option E talks about segregation within schools. Comprehensive schools were supposed to mix everyone, but maybe in reality, kids from different classes still hung out in different groups, leading to segregation. That could affect how they perform academically. That sounds plausible.

Option F says they recruited from inner cities and working-class areas. Wait, if comprehensives were in these areas, maybe they were serving a specific demographic, but I'm not sure how that directly causes class inequality. It's more about the student body composition rather than the structure.

Option G is about funding. If comprehensives didn't have enough money, that could affect quality. But I think the main issue was more about how the schools operated internally rather than funding. Plus, funding issues can vary, but I'm not sure if that's the primary reason.

Option H says they didn't offer advanced courses, limiting gifted students. But that would affect all students, not specifically class-based inequality. Unless middle-class students had more access to those courses elsewhere, but I'm not certain.

So, thinking back, the reason comprehensive schools didn't eliminate class inequalities might be because of the way they structured the education within the school. Even though they weren't selective, they used streaming or banding, which could separate students by ability. If middle-class students were more likely to be in higher streams due to better preparation or resources, that would maintain inequalities.

Wait, Option A says selective schools could cream off the most able, but I thought comprehensives were non-selective. Maybe in some areas, selective schools still existed, so comprehensives weren't the only option. But if that's the case, the comprehensives might have had the less able students, but streaming within them could also cause issues.

Alternatively, Option E points out that segregation within the school was still apparent. That could mean that even though students were in the same school, their social interactions and possibly the way they were grouped kept the class divisions alive.

I'm a bit torn between A and E. Another thought: streaming within comprehensives meant that students were divided into different ability groups. Middle-class students might have better support at home, leading to better performance in these streams. So the school structure itself perpetuated inequality. So Option A, which mentions ability streams, might be the right answer.

Wait, but Option A says that selective schools could still cream off pupils. So if some areas kept selective schools (like grammar schools), then the comprehensives in those areas would have the remaining students. But if that's the case, the comprehensives would have a mix, but the selective schools took the top students. But in areas without selective schools, comprehensives would have everyone, but still use streaming.

I think the main issue was that even in comprehensives, the internal streaming or banding created divisions. So the answer might be A because it talks about both selective schools and streaming in comprehensives contributing to inequality.

Alternatively, Option E is about segregation within schools, which would also contribute. But I'm not sure which is more accurate according to historical context.

Wait, I remember reading that even though comprehensive schools were introduced to reduce inequality, they often ended up streaming students into different ability groups. This led to middle-class students being overrepresented in higher streams, thus maintaining class inequalities. So Option A, which mentions ability streams, seems correct.

So the answer would be A.

In the 1960s, comprehensive schools were introduced to address class inequalities in education by providing a more inclusive and non-selective system. However, they failed to eradicate these inequalities for several reasons. 

Option A suggests that selective schools could still "cream off" the most able pupils, while comprehensives used ability streams. This is plausible because in areas where selective schools coexisted with comprehensives, the latter often ended up with students who were not selected by the former. Additionally, within comprehensive schools, the practice of streaming or banding students into different ability groups perpetuated inequalities. Middle-class students, often better prepared due to superior resources and support at home, were disproportionately placed in higher streams, while working-class students were more likely to be placed in lower streams. This internal stratification within comprehensives mirrored broader class divisions.

Option E highlights segregation within schools, which could also contribute to inequality. However, the more direct cause was the structural issue of ability streaming, as it directly impacted educational opportunities and outcomes based on class. Therefore, Option A provides the most accurate explanation for why comprehensive schools did not eradicate class inequalities in education.
