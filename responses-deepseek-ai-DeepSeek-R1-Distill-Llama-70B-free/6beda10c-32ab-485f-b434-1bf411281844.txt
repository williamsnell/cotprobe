Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the resolving power of a Fabry-Perot interferometer. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me two scenarios: one where the mirror separation is 15mm and the reflecting power is 75%, and another where the reflecting power is 90%. The wavelength used is 5000 Angstroms. I need to find the resolving power for each case and then pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the resolving power (R) of a Fabry-Perot interferometer depends on the finesse (F) of the etalon and the order of interference (m). The formula I think is R = F * m, but wait, isn't finesse related to the reflectivity of the mirrors?

Wait, the finesse F is given by (1 + r)/(1 - r), where r is the reflectivity. Oh wait, no, I think finesse is actually (pi * sqrt(R)) / (1 - R), where R is the reflectivity. Or maybe I have that backward. Let me get this straight.

Wait, I think the formula for finesse when you have two mirrors each with reflectance R is F = (4R)/(1 - R)^2, but maybe that's when considering other factors. Or is it F = (pi R^0.5) / (1 - R)? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Oh wait, maybe the finesse F is given by F = (4 R) / (1 - R)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that finesse is approximately (1 + r)/(1 - r), but that might be the peak transmission or something else.

Wait, no. I think the finesse (F) for a Fabry-Perot etalon when considering the reflectivity (R) of the mirrors is given by F = (4 R) / (1 - R)^2. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when R is higher, the finesse should increase, which this formula does. Let me check the formula again.

Alternatively, I've read that the finesse F can be approximated as F ≈ (4 R) / (1 - R)^2 for high reflectivity mirrors. So, when R is 0.75 (75%), F would be (4 * 0.75)/(1 - 0.75)^2. Let's compute that: numerator is 3, denominator is (0.25)^2 = 0.0625. So 3 / 0.0625 = 48. So F is 48 for R=75%.

Wait, but what about the other case where R is 90% (0.9)? So F would be (4 * 0.9)/(1 - 0.9)^2. Let's compute that. 4 * 0.9 is 3.6. Denominator is (0.1)^2 = 0.01. So 3.6 / 0.01 is 360. So F is 360 for R=90%.

Wait, but I'm not 100% confident about that formula. Another approach I remember is that finesse is given by F = (pi * sqrt(R)) / (1 - R). Let me try that with R=0.75: sqrt(0.75) is about 0.866. Multiply by pi gives roughly 2.72. Denominator is 0.25. So 2.72 / 0.25 ≈ 10.88. That's way lower than what I got before. So now I'm confused because the two formulas give different results. Which one is correct?

Wait, I think I might have mixed up different formulas. Let me think again. The finesse of a Fabry-Perot interferometer is given by F = (4 R) / (1 - R)^2 when considering the reflection from both mirrors. Or is that for something else like the contrast?

Alternatively, I've come across the formula F = pi * (sqrt(R)) / (1 - R). Let me check with R=0.75: sqrt(0.75)=0.8660, pi*0.866 is about 2.72. 1-R is 0.25, so 2.72/0.25 is about 10.88. But I think this might be the finesse when considering only a single mirror, but in a Fabry-Perot setup, both mirrors contribute, so perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula again. Oh wait, I can't, but I remember that the finesse is related to the reflectivity. Let me think about the relation between finesse and resolving power.

Wait, the resolving power R (not to confuse with reflectivity R) of a Fabry-Perot interferometer is given by R = (2 n F) / lambda, where n is the refractive index of the medium between the mirrors. If the medium is air, n is approximately 1. So R = 2 F d / lambda, where d is the separation between the mirrors.

Wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is the resolving power R = (m * F) where m is the order of interference, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the resolving power could be R = (2d F) / lambda. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the resolving power formula is R = (2 d m F) / lambda. Or R = (2 F d) / (lambda/m), since the order m is involved. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's try to approach this step by step. First, I'll need to find the finesse F for each case (R=75% and R=90%). Then, use the finesse to compute the resolving power.

I think the correct formula for finesse F is F = (4 R) / (1 - R)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that F = (pi * sqrt(R)) / (1 - R). Let me try both and see which gives an answer matching the options.

Wait, I found in my notes that the finesse F of a Fabry-Perot etalon is given by F = (4 R) / (1 - R)^2, but only when considering the case of two identical mirrors with reflectivity R. So I'll go with that formula for now.

So, for R = 75% (0.75):

F = (4 * 0.75) / (1 - 0.75)^2. Let's compute:

4 * 0.75 = 3.

Denominator: (0.25)^2 = 0.0625.

So F = 3 / 0.0625 = 48.

For R = 90% (0.9):

F = (4 * 0.9) / (1 - 0.9)^2 = 3.6 / 0.01 = 360.

Now, the resolving power R (I'll use R_res to avoid confusion with reflectivity R) is given by R_res = (2 d F) / (lambda * (1 - R)).

Wait, no, perhaps R_res is (2 d F m) / lambda, where m is the order. Alternatively, maybe the formula is R_res = (2 d F) / lambda.

Wait, I think the general formula for the resolving power of a Fabry-Perot interferometer is R_res = (2 d F) / (lambda/m), considering that the order of interference m affects the separation of wavelengths. Alternatively, maybe it's R_res = (2 d m F) / lambda.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The resolving power R is defined as the ratio of the wavelength to the minimum resolvable difference in wavelength, R = lambda / delta_lambda.

For a Fabry-Perot interferometer, delta_lambda is approximately lambda / (2 d F), so R = (2 d F)/lambda. So yes, R_res = (2 d F) / lambda.

Wait, I think that's correct. So R_res = (2 d F) / lambda.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about whether d is the physical separation or the optical path difference. Oh, in Fabry-Perot, the mirrors are usually in air, so d is the physical separation, so n=1, so the formula remains R_res = (2 d F) / lambda.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Given d = 15 mm = 15e-3 m. Lambda = 5000 Angstroms = 5000e-10 m = 5e-7 m.

For R=75%, F=48:

R_res = (2 * 15e-3 m * 48) / (5e-7 m) = (1440e-3) / 5e-7.

Compute numerator: 1440e-3 = 1.44 m? Wait, 15e-3 is 0.015 m, 2 * 0.015 m = 0.03 m. 0.03 m * 48 = 1.44 m.

Wait, but the denominator is 5e-7 m, so 1.44 / 5e-7 = (1.44 / 5) * 1e7.

1.44 /5 = 0.288. So 0.288e7 = 2,880,000.

Wait, but looking at the options, the first numbers are around 500,000 to 600,000. So this can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, maybe I swapped the formula. Maybe R_res is (d F) / lambda, not 2d F / lambda.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula I found earlier: R = (lambda) / (delta lambda) = (2 d F) / lambda.

Wait, but perhaps it's R_res = (m * F), where m is the order of interference. But without knowing m, that approach might not be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R_res = (2 F d) / (lambda/m), where m is the order. But without knowing m, I can't compute it. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. The resolving power is also given by R = (2d)/(lambda) * F.

Wait, let me check the units. d is in meters, lambda in meters, F is unitless.

So R_res would be unitless as well, which makes sense because it's a ratio.

Wait, but in the formula I used, R_res = (2 d F)/lambda, which would have units of (m * 1) / m = 1, which is correct.

So for R=75%, F=48:

R_res = (2 * 15e-3 m * 48) / (5e-7 m) = (1440e-3 m) / 5e-7 m = (1.44 m) / 5e-7 m = 1.44 / 5e-7 = 2.88e6.

Which is 2,880,000. But none of the options have such a high number for the first case. The options max out at around 1.6 million. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for finesse. Let me try the other approach where F = (pi * sqrt(R)) / (1 - R).

For R=0.75, F = (pi * sqrt(0.75)) / (1 - 0.75) = (pi * 0.8660) / 0.25 ≈ (2.720) / 0.25 ≈ 10.88.

Then R_res = (2 * 15e-3 m * 10.88) / 5e-7 m.

So numerator: 2 * 0.015 m = 0.03 m. 0.03 *10.88=0.3264 m.

So R_res = 0.3264 / 5e-7 = 0.3264 / 0.0000005 = 652,800.

Hmm, 652,800. Looking at the options, let's see which ones have numbers in that vicinity for the first case.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 530,350 and 1,459,923

Option B: 620,420 ...

Option C: 560,450...

Option D:580,500...

Option E: 500,000...

Option F:550,380...

Option G:450,300...

Option H:600,400...

Option I:540,400...

Option J:540,400...

So 652,800 isn't exactly there, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I used the wrong formula for finesse.

Wait, maybe the finesse is given by F = (4 R) / (1 - R)^2, and I should use that. Let me recalculate with that.

So for R=0.75, F= (4*0.75)/(1 - 0.75)^2 = 3/(0.0625) = 48.

Then R_res = (2 * 15e-3 m * 48) / (5e-7 m).

Wait, 15e-3 is 0.015 m. 2 * 0.015 = 0.03 m. 0.03 *48=1.44 m. Divide by 5e-7 m: 1.44 /5e-7 = 2.88e6, which is 2,880,000. But again, that's way higher than any options given. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the formula for resolving power doesn't include the factor of 2. Let me try without the 2.

So R_res = (d * F) / lambda.

So for R=0.75, F=48:

(15e-3 m * 48) / 5e-7 m = (0.72 m) / 5e-7 m = 0.72 / 5e-7 = 1,440,000.

Still way higher than the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe the finesse is given by F = (pi * R) / (1 - R^2). Wait, that might be the case for other cavity configurations. Let me try that.

So for R=0.75, F = pi * 0.75 / (1 - (0.75)^2) = (2.356) / (1 - 0.5625) = 2.356 / 0.4375 ≈ 5.385.

Then R_res = (2 * 15e-3 * 5.385) / 5e-7 = let's compute:

2*15e-3 = 0.03 m. 0.03 *5.385 = 0.16155 m.

0.16155 /5e-7 = 0.16155 / 0.0000005 = 323,100.

Hmm, still not matching any options. But some options have the first number around 500,000.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider the finesse formula. I think I'm confusing the formulas for finesse in different contexts. Let me try another approach.

Upon reviewing, I realize that the finesse of a Fabry-Perot interferometer is given by F = (4 R) / (1 - R)^2. So that's correct. So with R=0.75, F=48, R_res=2,880,000. But that's not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula for resolving power also includes the order m. But the problem doesn't specify the order, so perhaps it's considering m=1. Or maybe it's considering the maximum possible resolving power, which would be when m is large, but that doesn't help here.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the resolving power is given by R = (lambda / delta_lambda) = (2 d F) / lambda. So for R=75%, F=48:

R = (2 * 15e-3 * 48) / 5e-7 = (1440e-3) /5e-7 = (1.44) /5e-7 = 2,880,000.

But the options don't go that high. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula uses F = (pi * sqrt(R)) / (1 - R). Let's try that again.

For R=0.75:

F = (pi * sqrt(0.75)) / (1 - 0.75) = (3.1416 * 0.8660) / 0.25 ≈ (2.720) / 0.25 ≈ 10.88.

Then R_res = (2 * 15e-3 * 10.88) /5e-7 = (0.3264 m) /5e-7 m = 652,800.

Looking at the options, option B is 620,420 and ~1.489 million. Option D is 580,500 and ~1.6 million. Option F is 550,380 and ~1.5 million.

Hmm, 652,800 is closest to option B's first value of 620,420, but not exact. But perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let's recalculate F with F = (pi * sqrt(R)) / (1 - R) for R=0.75:

sqrt(0.75) = 0.8660. pi * 0.8660 ≈ 2.720. 1-R=0.25. So F≈2.720/0.25=10.88.

Then R_res = (2 * 0.015 m *10.88) / 5000e-10 m.

Wait, wait, wait, lambda is 5000 Angstroms, which is 5e-7 m, right? Because 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 m, so 5000 Angstroms is 5000e-10 m = 5e-7 m.

So, R_res = (2 * 0.015 *10.88) /5e-7.

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.015 = 0.03 m. 0.03 *10.88=0.3264 m. Denominator 5e-7 m.

So R_res = 0.3264 /5e-7 = 0.3264 / 0.0000005 = 652,800.

Which is approximately 652,800. Looking at the options, the closest first value is option B: 620,420. But that's a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate sqrt(0.
