Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me read through each option carefully and think through them one by one.

The question is asking which statement is correct regarding calculus concepts, specifically about derivatives and continuity. Let's go through each option.

Option A: If f'(c) ≠ 0, then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c)). Hmm, wait a second. I remember that f'(c) being zero is a necessary condition for a local extremum, but it's not sufficient. So if the derivative isn't zero, it can't be a maximum or minimum. So this statement says that if the derivative isn't zero, there's an extremum, which doesn't make sense. So A is probably false.

Option B: If f'(c) = 0, then f has a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c)). No, wait. Just because the derivative is zero doesn't mean it's an extremum. For example, consider the point (0,0) on the function f(x) = x^3. The derivative is zero there, but it's a saddle point, not a max or min. So B is false.

Option C: If f is differentiable at x = c, then f is continuous at x = c. I think this is correct. Differentiability implies continuity, but the reverse isn't true. So if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous there. So C is true.

Option D: If f(x) is discontinuous at x = c, then f might be differentiable at x = c. Well, if a function is discontinuous at a point, it can't be differentiable there. Because differentiability requires continuity. So D is false.

Option E: If f is differentiable at x = c, then f'(c) might or might not exist. Wait, no. If f is differentiable at c, that means the derivative f'(c) exists by definition. So E is incorrect.

Option F: If f(x) is continuous at x = c, then the graph of f has a minimum or maximum at (c, f(c)). No, continuity doesn't imply an extremum. For example, f(x) = x is continuous everywhere but has no max or min. So F is false.

Option G: If f(x) is continuous at x = c, then f'(c) exists. No, continuity doesn't guarantee differentiability. For example, |x| is continuous at 0 but not differentiable there. So G is false.

Option H: If f''(c) = 0, then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c, f(c)). Hmm, I think having the second derivative zero doesn't necessarily mean there's an inflection point. It could be a point of inflection if the concavity changes, but it's not guaranteed. For example, f(x) = x^4 has f''(0)=0, but there's no inflection there. So H is false.

Option I: If f'(c) = 0, then f(x) is constant for all x. No, that's not true. It could have a local max or min, or a saddle point, but the function doesn't have to be constant everywhere. For example, f(x) = x^2 has f'(0)=0, but it's not constant. So I is false.

Option J: If f''(c) ≠ 0, then the graph of f has an inflection point at (c, f(c)). Wait, no. The second derivative not being zero would indicate that the function is concave up or down at that point. An inflection point is where the concavity changes, which would require f''(c) to be zero. So if f''(c) isn't zero, there's no inflection. So J is false.

Wait, but let me double-check option C. Differentiable implies continuous, yes. So C is correct. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The question is which statement is true, and from the options, only C seems correct.

To determine which statement is true, let us analyze each option carefully:

- **Option A**: If \( f'(c) \neq 0 \), then \( f \) has a local maximum or minimum at \( (c, f(c)) \). This is false because a non-zero derivative indicates the function is increasing or decreasing at that point, not an extremum.

- **Option B**: If \( f'(c) = 0 \), then \( f \) has a local maximum or minimum at \( (c, f(c)) \). This is also false because \( f'(c) = 0 \) is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a local extremum. For example, \( f(x) = x^3 \) at \( x = 0 \) has \( f'(0) = 0 \), but it is not a maximum or minimum.

- **Option C**: If \( f \) is differentiable at \( x = c \), then \( f \) is continuous at \( x = c \). This is true because differentiability implies continuity.

- **Option D**: If \( f(x) \) is discontinuous at \( x = c \), then \( f \) might be differentiable at \( x = c \). This is false because differentiability requires continuity.

- **Option E**: If \( f \) is differentiable at \( x = c \), then \( f'(c) \) might or might not exist. This is false because differentiability at \( x = c \) means \( f'(c) \) exists by definition.

- **Option F**: If \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = c \), then the graph of \( f \) has a minimum or maximum at \( (c, f(c)) \). This is false because continuity does not guarantee an extremum.

- **Option G**: If \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = c \), then \( f'(c) \) exists. This is false because continuity does not guarantee differentiability.

- **Option H**: If \( f''(c) = 0 \), then the graph of \( f \) has an inflection point at \( (c, f(c)) \). This is false because \( f''(c) = 0 \) does not necessarily imply a change in concavity, which is required for an inflection point.

- **Option I**: If \( f'(c) = 0 \), then \( f(x) \) is constant for all \( x \). This is false because \( f'(c) = 0 \) only indicates a critical point, not that the function is constant everywhere.

- **Option J**: If \( f''(c) \neq 0 \), then the graph of \( f \) has an inflection point at \( (c, f(c)) \). This is false because an inflection point requires \( f''(c) = 0 \) and a change in concavity.

The only correct statement is **Option C**: If \( f \) is differentiable at \( x = c \), then \( f \) is continuous at \( x = c \).
