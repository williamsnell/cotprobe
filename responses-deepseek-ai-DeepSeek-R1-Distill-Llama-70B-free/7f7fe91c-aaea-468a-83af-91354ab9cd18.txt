Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the probability that Y7 is less than 27.3. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, first, the problem says we have eight independent observations from a continuous distribution, and Y1 to Y8 are the order statistics. So Y1 is the smallest, Y8 the largest. The 70th percentile of this distribution is given as 27.3. I'm trying to find P(Y7 < 27.3).

Hmm, order statistics. I remember that for a sample of size n, the k-th order statistic's probability can be found using the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Since the distribution is continuous, each observation has a probability of p of being less than a certain value, say x. In this case, x is 27.3, and p is the CDF at that point.

Wait, the 70th percentile means that P(Y <= 27.3) is 0.7, right? So F(27.3) = 0.7, where F is the CDF.

Now, Y7 is the seventh order statistic out of eight. So I'm looking for the probability that the seventh smallest value is less than 27.3. I think the formula for the CDF of the k-th order statistic in a sample of size n is given by:

P(Y_k <= x) = sum from i=k to n of [C(n, i) * (F(x))^i * (1 - F(x))^(n-i)]

Wait no, that's the PMF for a binomial distribution. Oh wait, no, the CDF for the k-th order statistic is actually:

P(Y_k <= x) = sum from i=k to n of [C(n, i) * (F(x))^i * (1 - F(x))^(n-i)]

Wait, no. Actually, the CDF for Y_k is the probability that at least k of the n samples are less than or equal to x. So it's the sum from i=k to n of the binomial probabilities, each term being C(n, i) * (F(x))^i * (1 - F(x))^{n-i}.

But wait, for continuous distributions, the probability that Y_k <= x is equal to the probability that at least k out of n samples are <= x. So that would be the sum from i=k to n of C(n,i) p^i (1-p)^(n-i), where p is F(x).

In this problem, p is 0.7 because F(27.3) = 0.7.

So for Y7, k=7, n=8. So P(Y7 <= 27.3) is the sum from i=7 to 8 of C(8,i) * (0.7)^i * (0.3)^{8-i}.

Let me compute that.

C(8,7) is 8, and C(8,8) is 1.

So the terms are:

For i=7: 8 * (0.7)^7 * (0.3)^1

For i=8: 1 * (0.7)^8 * (0.3)^0

Let me calculate each term.

First term: 8 * (0.7)^7 * 0.3

Second term: 1 * (0.7)^8 * 1

Let me compute 0.7^7 and 0.7^8.

0.7^1 = 0.7

0.7^2 = 0.49

0.7^3 = 0.343

0.7^4 = 0.2401

0.7^5 = 0.16807

0.7^6 = 0.117649

0.7^7 = 0.0823543

0.7^8 = 0.05764801

So first term: 8 * 0.0823543 * 0.3

8 * 0.0823543 = 0.6588344, then multiply by 0.3: 0.6588344 * 0.3 = 0.19765032.

Second term: 1 * 0.05764801 = 0.05764801.

Adding both terms: 0.19765032 + 0.05764801 = 0.25529833.

So P(Y7 < 27.3) is approximately 0.2553.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.2553. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Since Y7 is the seventh order statistic, the probability that Y7 < 27.3 is the same as the probability that at least seven out of eight observations are less than or equal to 27.3. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation I did is right.
</think>

To determine \( P(Y_7 < 27.3) \), we use the properties of order statistics. The 70th percentile of the distribution is given as \( \pi_{0.7} = 27.3 \), which implies \( F(27.3) = 0.7 \), where \( F \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF). 

For the 7th order statistic \( Y_7 \) in a sample of size \( n = 8 \), the probability \( P(Y_7 < 27.3) \) is equivalent to the probability that at least 7 out of 8 observations are less than or equal to 27.3. This can be calculated using the binomial probability formula:

\[
P(Y_7 < 27.3) = \sum_{i=7}^{8} \binom{8}{i} (0.7)^i (0.3)^{8-i}.
\]

Here, \( \binom{8}{i} \) is the binomial coefficient, \( 0.7 \) is the probability that an observation is less than or equal to 27.3, and \( 0.3 \) is the probability that it is greater than 27.3.

### Calculations:
1. For \( i = 7 \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{7} (0.7)^7 (0.3)^1 = 8 \cdot (0.7)^7 \cdot 0.3.
   \]
   Using \( (0.7)^7 \approx 0.0823543 \):
   \[
   8 \cdot 0.0823543 \cdot 0.3 = 0.19765032.
   \]

2. For \( i = 8 \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{8} (0.7)^8 (0.3)^0 = 1 \cdot (0.7)^8 \cdot 1.
   \]
   Using \( (0.7)^8 \approx 0.05764801 \):
   \[
   1 \cdot 0.05764801 = 0.05764801.
   \]

Adding these probabilities:
\[
P(Y_7 < 27.3) = 0.19765032 + 0.05764801 = 0.25529833 \approx 0.2553.
\]

### Conclusion:
The probability \( P(Y_7 < 27.3) \) is approximately 0.2553, which corresponds to option **C**.
