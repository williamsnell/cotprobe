Question:

One of the methods for the synthesis of dilute acetic acid from ethanol is the use ofacetobacter. A dilute solution of ethanol is allowed to trickle down overbeechwoodshavings that have been inoculated with a culture of the bacteria. Air is forced through the vat countercurrent to the alcohol flow. The reaction can be written as C_2H_5OH (aq) + O_2 CH_3COOH (aq) + H_2O (l) acetic acid Calculate the Gibbs Free Energy, ∆G°, for this reaction, given the following Gibbs Free Energies of Formation: Ethanol = - 43.39 Kcal/mole, H_2O (l) = - 56.69 Kcal/mole, and Acetic acid = - 95.38 Kcal/mole.

Options:

A: - 89.1 Kcal/mole
B: - 65.5 Kcal/mole
C: - 120.5 Kcal/mole
D: - 20.3 Kcal/mole
E: - 150.9 Kcal/mole
F: - 56.69 Kcal/mole
G: - 108.7 Kcal/mole
H: - 95.38 Kcal/mole
I: - 78.2 Kcal/mole
J: - 43.39 Kcal/mole

Okay, so I have this question about calculating the Gibbs Free Energy change for a reaction. Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy change, ΔG°, is calculated using the standard Gibbs free energies of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is ΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants). Right, so I need to apply that here.

The reaction given is C₂H₅OH (aq) + O₂ → CH₃COOH (aq) + H₂O (l). Wait, wait, I should make sure I have the correct stoichiometry. Oh yeah, it's a complete reaction as written. So the reactants are ethanol and oxygen, and the products are acetic acid and water.

The Gibbs free energies of formation given are:
- Ethanol (C₂H₅OH): -43.39 Kcal/mol
- Water (H₂O(l)): -56.69 Kcal/mol
- Acetic acid (CH₃COOH): -95.38 Kcal/mol
Oxygen (O₂) is in its standard state, so its ΔGf° is zero, I think. Because elements in their standard form have a ΔGf° of zero.

So, plugging into the formula. The products are acetic acid and water. So for the products' side, I add their ΔGf° values. Acetic acid is -95.38 and water is -56.69. So that's (-95.38) + (-56.69) = -152.07 Kcal/mol.

Wait wait, wait. No, wait. The formula is sum of products minus sum of reactants. So the products are acetic acid and water. Reactants are ethanol and oxygen. But oxygen is zero, so the reactants sum is just ethanol's ΔGf°, which is -43.39.

So now, the calculation is [(-95.38) + (-56.69)] - [(-43.39) + 0]. Let me compute that. 

First, sum of products: -95.38 + (-56.69) = -152.07.

Sum of reactants: -43.39 + 0 = -43.39.

So ΔG° = (-152.07) - (-43.39) = -152.07 + 43.39 = -108.68 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option G is -108.7 Kcal/mol. So that's pretty close. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Ethanol is a reactant, so it's subtracted. So the products are (acetic acid and water) minus (ethanol). So it's (-95.38 -56.69) - (-43.39) = (-152.07) +43.39 = -108.68, which rounds to -108.7. So yes, option G is correct.

To calculate the Gibbs Free Energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction:

**C₂H₅OH (aq) + O₂ → CH₃COOH (aq) + H₂O (l)**  

we use the formula:  

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \sum \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

### Given Data:
- **ΔGf°(C₂H₅OH)** = -43.39 Kcal/mol  
- **ΔGf°(O₂)** = 0 Kcal/mol (standard state)  
- **ΔGf°(CH₃COOH)** = -95.38 Kcal/mol  
- **ΔGf°(H₂O(l))** = -56.69 Kcal/mol  

### Calculation:
1. **Sum of products' ΔGf°**:  
   \[
   \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{CH₃COOH}) + \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{H₂O}) = -95.38 + (-56.69) = -152.07 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
   \]

2. **Sum of reactants' ΔGf°**:  
   \[
   \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{C₂H₅OH}) + \Delta G_f^\circ (\text{O₂}) = -43.39 + 0 = -43.39 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
   \]

3. **ΔG° for the reaction**:  
   \[
   \Delta G^\circ = (-152.07) - (-43.39) = -152.07 + 43.39 = -108.68 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated ΔG° is approximately **-108.7 Kcal/mol**, which matches option **G**.
