Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about an elastic collision between two particles. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the problem states that we have two masses, m₁ and m₂. Their initial velocities are u₁ and u₂ respectively. Oh wait, u₂ is given as alpha times u₁. So, u₂ = α u₁. And the initial kinetic energies of both particles are equal. Interesting. 

The goal is to find the conditions on the ratio u₁/u₂ such that after the collision, m₁ is at rest. Also, alpha is positive. The answer choices are given from A to J, each with some expressions involving square roots.

First, I need to recall what happens in an elastic collision. In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. So I should probably start by writing down the conservation equations.

Let me jot down the initial conditions:

- Initial velocities: u₁ and u₂ = α u₁.
- Kinetic energies are equal, so (1/2)m₁ u₁² = (1/2)m₂ u₂².

Oh wait, that's an important point. Since the kinetic energies are equal, I can set them equal and maybe find a relation between m₁ and m₂. Let me write that out.

(1/2)m₁ u₁² = (1/2)m₂ (α u₁)²

The 1/2 cancels out, so:

m₁ u₁² = m₂ α² u₁²

Divide both sides by u₁² (assuming u₁ isn't zero, which makes sense because if it were, both would be at rest already):

m₁ = m₂ α²

So m₁/m₂ = α². That gives a relation between the masses. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, considering the collision. After the collision, m₁ is at rest. So the final velocity of m₁ is zero. Let me denote the final velocities as v₁ and v₂. So v₁ = 0.

In an elastic collision, conservation of momentum holds:

m₁ u₁ + m₂ u₂ = m₁ v₁ + m₂ v₂

Since v₁ is zero, this simplifies to:

m₁ u₁ + m₂ u₂ = m₂ v₂

But u₂ is alpha u₁, so substitute that in:

m₁ u₁ + m₂ (α u₁) = m₂ v₂

Factor out u₁:

u₁ (m₁ + m₂ α) = m₂ v₂

Solving for v₂:

v₂ = [u₁ (m₁ + m₂ α)] / m₂

Hmm, but I also know from the conservation of kinetic energy in elastic collisions. Wait, in elastic collisions, the kinetic energy is conserved as well. So the total kinetic energy before equals after.

The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)m₁ u₁² + (1/2)m₂ u₂². But wait, earlier we found that these two are equal, so the total initial KE is 2*(1/2)m₁ u₁²) = m₁ u₁².

After the collision, since m₁ is at rest, the KE is (1/2)m₂ v₂². So:

m₁ u₁² = (1/2) m₂ v₂²

Wait, but I can substitute v₂ from the momentum equation into this.

Let me write that:

m₁ u₁² = (1/2) m₂ [ (u₁ (m₁ + m₂ α) ) / m₂ ) ]²

Simplify that expression.

First, square the term in the brackets:

[ u₁ (m₁ + m₂ α) / m₂ ]² = u₁² (m₁ + m₂ α)^2 / m₂²

So substituting back:

m₁ u₁² = (1/2) m₂ * [ u₁² (m₁ + m₂ α)^2 ) / m₂² ]

Simplify the right side:

The m₂ in the numerator cancels with the denominator's m₂ squared, leaving 1/m₂. Also, 1/2 factor remains.

So right side becomes (1/2) * u₁² (m₁ + m₂ α)^2 / m₂

So equation is:

m₁ u₁² = (1/2) u₁² (m₁ + m₂ α)^2 / m₂

We can cancel u₁² from both sides (assuming u₁ isn't zero, which it isn't as per initial conditions).

So:

m₁ = (1/2) (m₁ + m₂ α)^2 / m₂

Multiply both sides by m₂:

m₁ m₂ = (1/2) (m₁ + m₂ α)^2

Let me expand the right side:

(m₁ + m₂ α)^2 = m₁² + 2 m₁ m₂ α + (m₂ α)^2

So substituting:

m₁ m₂ = (1/2)( m₁² + 2 m₁ m₂ α + m₂² α² )

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2 m₁ m₂ = m₁² + 2 m₁ m₂ α + m₂² α²

Let me bring all terms to one side:

0 = m₁² + 2 m₁ m₂ α + m₂² α² - 2 m₁ m₂

Hmm, okay, let's try to arrange terms:

m₁² + 2 m₁ m₂ (α - 1) + m₂² α² = 0

Wait, perhaps I can factor this as a quadratic in terms of (m₁/m₂). Let me think.

Let me define r = m₁ / m₂. Then, m₁ = r m₂.

Substituting into the equation:

(r m₂)^2 + 2 (r m₂)(m₂)(α -1) + m₂² α² = 0

Simplify each term:

r² m₂² + 2 r m₂² (α -1) + m₂² α² = 0

Factor out m₂²:

m₂² [ r² + 2 r (α -1) + α² ] =0

Since m₂ isn't zero, the expression in the brackets must be zero:

r² + 2 r (α -1) + α² = 0

This is a quadratic equation in r. Let's write it as:

r² + 2 (α -1) r + α² = 0

We can solve for r using the quadratic formula:

r = [ -2(α -1) ± sqrt( [2(α-1)]^2 - 4*1* α² ) ] / 2

Simplify the discriminant:

[2(α-1)]^2 =4 (α² - 2α +1 )

So the discriminant becomes:

4(α² - 2α +1 ) -4 α² = 4α² -8 alpha +4 -4 alpha² = -8 alpha +4

Factor out 4:

4(-2 alpha +1 )

So the sqrt becomes sqrt(4(1-2 alpha)) ) = 2 sqrt(1-2 alpha)

Wait, but for the discriminant to be real, 1-2 alpha must be >=0, so alpha <= 1/2.

Hmm, interesting. So alpha must be less than or equal to 0.5.

Now, putting it back into the solution for r:

r = [ -2(alpha -1) ± 2 sqrt(1-2 alpha) ] / 2

Factor out 2 in numerator:

r = [ 2 [ -(alpha-1) ± sqrt(1-2 alpha) ] ] / 2

The 2's cancel:

r = -(alpha -1) ± sqrt(1-2 alpha)

Simplify -(alpha-1) to (1 - alpha):

r = (1 - alpha) ± sqrt(1-2 alpha)

But wait, r is m₁/m₂, which must be positive since masses are positive. So we need r to be positive.

Let me think about the possible solutions.

So, r can be (1 - alpha) + sqrt(1-2 alpha) or (1 - alpha) - sqrt(1-2 alpha)

Hmm. Let's see under what conditions these are positive.

But before I get into that, perhaps I can find another approach since I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, earlier I found that m₁ = m₂ alpha². So since r = m₁/m₂, r = alpha².

So substituting r = alpha squared into the equation.

Wait, because from the initial condition, m₁ = m₂ alpha², so r = m₁/m₂ = alpha squared.

So I can substitute r = alpha² into the equation r² + 2 r (alpha -1) + alpha² =0.

Let me do that:

(alpha²)^2 + 2 (alpha²)(alpha -1) + alpha² = 0

Expand each term:

alpha^4 + 2 alpha^3 - 2 alpha² + alpha^2 = 0

Wait, the last term is alpha squared. So that's:

alpha^4 + 2 alpha^3 - alpha² =0

Factor out alpha squared:

alpha² (alpha² + 2 alpha -1 )=0

So the solutions are when alpha²=0 (which would imply alpha=0, but alpha is positive, so not possible), or when:

alpha² + 2 alpha -1 =0

Solving for alpha:

alpha = [ -2 ± sqrt(4 +4) ] / 2 = [ -2 ± sqrt(8) ] /2 = [ -2 ± 2*sqrt(2) ] /2 = [ -1 ± sqrt(2) ]

Since alpha is positive, take the positive solution:

alpha = [ -1 + sqrt(2) ] ≈ 0.414, which is less than 0.5, which fits with earlier condition.

Wait, but the question is about u1/u2, not alpha. Since u2 = alpha u1, then u1/u2 = 1/alpha.

Let me compute 1/alpha, where alpha is sqrt(2)-1.

So 1/alpha = 1/(sqrt(2)-1 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(2)+1 ) to rationalize:

(1*(sqrt(2)+1 )) / [ (sqrt(2)-1)(sqrt(2)+1) ) ] = (sqrt(2)+1 )/(2-1) ) = sqrt(2)+1.

So u1/u2 = sqrt(2) +1.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly show this. Hmm, wait the options are all in terms of u1/u2. Let me see: sqrt(2)+1 is approximately 2.414, which is about 2 + 1.414, so 2.414.

Looking back at the options, option D is 2 ±√2. So 2 +√2 is about 3.414, which doesn't match. Option H is 1 ±√2, which is about 2.414 and 0.414. Wait, 1 +√2 is about 2.414, which matches our value.

Wait, that's interesting. Because the problem is asking for the ratio u1/u2, which is 1/alpha. And I found that alpha = sqrt(2)-1, so 1/alpha is sqrt(2)+1, which is approximately 2.414, which is 1 + sqrt(2) because sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414. So 1 + 1.414 is 2.414. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options are given as expressions, so 1+sqrt(2) would be option H's positive case. But wait, let me look again.

Wait, the options are labeled A to J, each with various expressions. Option H is 1±sqrt(2). So 1 + sqrt(2) is 2.414, which is our solution. But wait, the question states that m1 is at rest after the collision, which depends on both velocities and masses, but I think I got it right.

Wait, but in the quadratic equation for alpha, I only found one solution, alpha = sqrt(2)-1. So u1/u2 would be 1 + sqrt(2). So the ratio is 1 + sqrt(2), which is option H's positive solution.

But wait, the options also have a negative sign. So perhaps the ratio could have two solutions, but in this case, since alpha is positive, u1/u2 would be positive as well, so the negative case would lead to a negative alpha, which isn't allowed here.

Wait, but let me think again. Since alpha is positive, and u2 = alpha u1, then u1 and u2 have the same direction. So u1/u2 is 1/alpha, which would be positive. So the ratio is positive, so only the positive solution applies. So the answer would be 1 + sqrt(2), which is option H.

Wait, but looking back, the options for H are 1 ± sqrt(2), so the positive is correct.

Hmm, but earlier I thought that the only solution for alpha is sqrt(2)-1, which is approximately 0.414, making u1/u2 about 2.414, which is 1+sqrt(2). So the correct answer would be H: 1 ± sqrt(2), but only the positive solution applies here, so 1 + sqrt(2).

Wait, but in the options, H is "1 ± sqrt(2)", which would include both 1+sqrt(2) and 1-sqrt(2). The latter is about -0.414, which can't be because the ratio u1/u2 is positive. So the only possible solution is 1 + sqrt(2), which is option H's positive case.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I derived the quadratic equation for r, I found that r = (1 - alpha) ± sqrt(1-2 alpha). But then I also had another approach where substituting r = alpha squared led to another equation. I'm not sure if I made a mistake there. Let me retrace.

Wait, in the first approach, I used the condition m₁ = m₂ alpha squared, leading to r = alpha squared. Then I substituted that into the quadratic equation r² + 2 r(alpha-1) + alpha²=0, which led to solving for alpha, getting alpha = sqrt(2)-1.

In that case, the ratio u1/u2 is 1/alpha = 1/(sqrt(2)-1) = sqrt(2)+1, which is 1 + sqrt(2). So this would correspond to option H.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss another solution. Because when I solved for alpha, the quadratic equation gave me alpha = [ -1 + sqrt(2) ] and [ -1 - sqrt(2) ], but the latter is negative, so alpha must be [ -1 + sqrt(2) ].

Wait, but what about the other approach where I considered the quadratic in r?

Let me go back to that equation:

r² + 2 r (alpha -1) + alpha²=0.

But since r = alpha squared, substituting gives alpha^4 + 2 alpha^3 - alpha^2=0.

Which factors as alpha^2 (alpha^2 + 2 alpha -1 )=0, leading to alpha=0 or alpha = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +4)]/2 = (-2 ± 2√2)/2 → -1 ±√2.

Only alpha = -1 +√2 is positive, so that's the only solution. Thus, the ratio u1/u2 is 1/alpha = 1/(√2 -1 )= √2 +1, which is 1 +√2.

So the correct answer is H: 1 ± sqrt(2). But only the positive solution is valid, so the ratio is 1 + sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is written as "1 ± sqrt(2)", which includes both possibilities, but since u1/u2 is positive, only 1 + sqrt(2) is acceptable. So the correct answer must be H. But let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option H is 1 ±√2, which includes 1 +√2 and 1 -√2. Since 1 -√2 is negative (~ -0.414), which can't be the case here, the only valid ratio is 1 +√2. So the answer is H: 1 ±√2, specifically the positive one.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be option D: 2±√2. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, in the problem statement, the initial velocities are u1 and u2=alpha u1. So, u2 = alpha u1 → alpha = u2/u1.

Wait, wait a second, I think I made a mistake in defining alpha. The problem says u2 = alpha u1, so alpha is u2/u1, which is (u2/u1). So the ratio u1/u2 would be 1/alpha.

Wait, that would change things. So in my earlier steps, when I wrote u2 = alpha u1, then alpha = u2/u1. So the ratio u1/u2 is 1/alpha.

So when I found alpha = sqrt(2) -1, then u1/u2 = 1/(sqrt(2)-1) = sqrt(2)+1, as before. So that part seems correct.

But I'm a bit concerned because in my earlier substitution, I might have confused alpha with u1/u2. Let me make sure.

Wait, the problem defines u2 = alpha u1. So u2/u1 = alpha → u1/u2 = 1/alpha.

The question asks for the conditions on u1/u2. So when I found alpha = sqrt(2)-1, then u1/u2 = 1/(sqrt(2)-1) = sqrt(2)+1, which is approximately 2.414. So the ratio u1/u2 is sqrt(2)+1, which is 1 + sqrt(2).

So the correct answer is option H: 1 ± sqrt(2), but only the positive solution is valid, so 1 + sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 1 ± sqrt(2), which includes 1 + sqrt(2) and 1 - sqrt(2). Since 1 - sqrt(2) is negative (~-0.414), which isn't possible for u1/u2 as velocities are in the same direction (alpha positive), so only the positive solution applies.

So the correct answer is option H: 1 ± sqrt(2), specifically 1 + sqrt(2).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the
