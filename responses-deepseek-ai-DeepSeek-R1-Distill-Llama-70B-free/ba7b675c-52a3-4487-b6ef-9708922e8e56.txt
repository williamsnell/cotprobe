Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Charles Darwin. The question is asking what he was the first to propose. Let me read through the options carefully.

The question is: "Charles Darwin was the first person to propose" with options A to J.

I remember that Darwin is famous for his theory of evolution. So let's go through each option.

Option A: that humans evolved from apes. Wait, I think that's more associated with the idea of evolution, but was Darwin the first? I'm not sure. Maybe someone else proposed that before him.

Option B: that evolution occurs. I don't think so because earlier scientists like Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had ideas about species changing over time, so Darwin wasn't the first to propose evolution itself.

Option C: that evolution occurs through gradual change. Hmm, I think Darwin did emphasize gradualism, but I'm not certain if he was the first. Maybe others had similar ideas.

Option D: that the Earth is older than a few thousand years. That sounds more like something from geologists like Charles Lyell. I think Uniformitarianism and deep time were established before Darwin.

Option E: a mechanism for how evolution occurs. Oh, right, Darwin proposed natural selection as the mechanism. But was he the first to suggest a mechanism? I think so because before him, people didn't have a clear mechanism for evolution.

Option F: a mechanism for evolution that was supported by evidence. Yes, Darwin's Origin of Species provided a lot of evidence for natural selection, so this seems accurate.

Option G: a complete taxonomy of all known species. That doesn't sound right. Taxonomy was more Linnaeus's work, and it's an ongoing process.

Option H: the idea of natural selection. Yes, Darwin is known for this. He introduced natural selection as the driving force behind evolution.

Option I: the theory of relativity. That's Einstein, so definitely not Darwin.

Option J: the concept of genetic inheritance. That's more like Mendel and later discoveries, so not Darwin.

Now, let's think again. The question is about what Darwin was the first to propose. So the key is to identify what was novel about his contributions.

The theory of evolution existed before Darwin, but he provided the mechanism. So option E is a mechanism, but F says it was supported by evidence. I think F is more specific because Darwin not only proposed the mechanism (natural selection) but also supported it with evidence from his observations and studies.

Wait, but option H is the idea of natural selection. So both E and H are about the mechanism. Let me clarify: H says "the idea of natural selection," which is accurate because that's what Darwin proposed. E is more general, just a mechanism. So H is correct.

Alternatively, the question is about what he was the first to propose. So if someone else had proposed natural selection before, then H wouldn't be correct. But I believe Darwin was the first to propose natural selection as the mechanism.

Wait, actually, Patrick Matthew and others had similar ideas before Darwin published, but Darwin is the one who developed it fully. So maybe the answer is H.

Alternatively, option E says "a mechanism for how evolution occurs." Since evolution was already proposed before, Darwin's main contribution was the mechanism, which is natural selection. So perhaps E is correct because it's about the mechanism, regardless of the specific name.

But wait, the options are about what he was first to propose. So if someone else had proposed a mechanism before, then E wouldn't be correct. But I think Darwin was the first to propose natural selection as a mechanism for evolution.

Wait, another angle. The question is about the first to propose. So:

- Evolution as a concept: not Darwin, because others like Lamarck.
- Mechanism: Darwin's big contribution was natural selection, so he was the first to propose this mechanism.

So the options are E, F, H.

Option E: a mechanism for how evolution occurs. Correct, because that's what he did in Origin of Species.

Option F: a mechanism supported by evidence. Also correct, as he provided evidence.

Option H: the idea of natural selection. Yes, that's the mechanism he proposed.

So the question is, which of these was he the first to propose.

If the question is about the mechanism, then E and H are both about the mechanism, but E is more general, H is specific.

The question is phrased, "the first person to propose". So if someone else had proposed the idea before, then it's not H. But I think Darwin is credited with being the first to propose natural selection, even if others had similar ideas.

Wait, actually, Alfred Russel Wallace also came up with the idea of natural selection around the same time as Darwin, but Darwin was the first to publish it extensively. So perhaps H is correct.

Alternatively, the question might be pointing towards option E because it's about the mechanism. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about which of these options correctly states what Darwin was the first to propose. Let's look at each option.

Option A: humans from apes. Not first, as others had that idea.

Option B: evolution occurs. Not first.

Option C: gradual change. I think he was a proponent, but maybe not the first.

Option D: Earth's age. Not him.

Option E: mechanism for evolution. He was the first to propose natural selection as the mechanism.

Option F: mechanism supported by evidence. He had evidence, but perhaps F is more about providing evidence rather than being the first to propose.

Option H: natural selection. Yes, he proposed it, so first.

So I'm torn between E, F, and H. But the question is about proposing, not about evidence.

So E is about a mechanism, H is about natural selection. Since natural selection is the mechanism, H is a subset of E. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but the question is, what was Darwin the first to propose. So if he proposed natural selection, which is a mechanism, then both E and H are correct. But looking at the options, the more specific answer is H.

Alternatively, let me think about what each option states.

Option E: a mechanism for how evolution occurs. So that's correct because Darwin proposed natural selection.

Option H: the idea of natural selection. So that's correct as well.

So which one is the correct answer?

The question is, which option correctly states something Darwin was the first to propose.

I think the intended answer is H: the idea of natural selection.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because it's more general, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the full title of Darwin's book is "On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection". So he proposed the mechanism of natural selection, making H correct.

So the answer should be H.

Charles Darwin is best known for his contributions to the theory of evolution, particularly through his book *On the Origin of Species*. While earlier scientists like Jean-Baptiste Lamarck had proposed that species change over time, Darwin was the first to propose a specific mechanism for how evolution occurs: **natural selection**. This idea, introduced in 1859, revolutionized biology by explaining how species adapt and diversify over generations through a process of survival and reproduction of the fittest individuals.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: The idea that humans evolved from apes was not first proposed by Darwin.
- **B**: Evolution as a concept existed before Darwin, so he was not the first to propose it.
- **C**: While Darwin emphasized gradual change, he was not the first to propose this idea.
- **D**: The concept of an older Earth was established by geologists like Charles Lyell, not Darwin.
- **E**: Darwin did propose a mechanism for evolution (natural selection), but this option is less specific than **H**.
- **F**: Darwin provided evidence for his mechanism, but the question focuses on what he was the first to propose, not the evidence.
- **G**: Taxonomy was not Darwin's contribution.
- **H**: Darwin was the first to propose the idea of natural selection as the mechanism driving evolution.
- **I**: The theory of relativity is attributed to Albert Einstein, not Darwin.
- **J**: Genetic inheritance was developed by Gregor Mendel, not Darwin.

The most accurate and specific answer is **H**, as Darwin was the first to propose the idea of natural selection as the mechanism for evolution.

Answer: H
