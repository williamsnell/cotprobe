Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The meteorologist says there's a 30% chance of rain and no sun. Wait, so that's the probability of both rain and no sun happening together? Or is it the probability of either rain or no sun? Hmm, in probability terms, when they say "probability of A and B", it usually means both happening together, right? So I'll take it as P(Rain and no Sun) = 0.3.

Then, there's a 40% probability of no rain. So P(No Rain) = 0.4. That means the probability of rain is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, because either it rains or it doesn't, so they must add up to 1.

The question is asking for the probability of both rain and sun. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because if it's raining, can there be sun? Or does the 'sun' imply no rain? I think in this context, 'sun' means no rain. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think. Maybe the options are about the probability of rain and sun occurring at the same time, but that doesn't make much sense because if it's raining, typically it's cloudy, not sunny. But perhaps in this problem, 'sun' is just another event, maybe like a different condition. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, the first statement says a 30% probability of rain and no sun. So P(Rain and no Sun) = 0.3. So 'no sun' is an event here. Let me denote:

Let me define the events properly.

Let R = Rain

Let S = Sun

So the first statement is P(R and not S) = 0.3.

The second statement is P(not R) = 0.4, so P(R) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

We're to find P(R and S). But wait, can it rain and be sunny at the same time? That seems contradictory, but maybe in this problem, it's possible. Or perhaps 'sun' here refers to a different aspect, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the events are not mutually exclusive.

Wait, but let's think in terms of probabilities. We know that P(R and not S) is 0.3. Since the total probability of R is 0.6, then the rest of R must be when it's sunny. Because R can be split into two parts: R and S, and R and not S.

So P(R) = P(R and S) + P(R and not S). We know P(R) is 0.6 and P(R and not S) is 0.3. So substituting:

0.6 = P(R and S) + 0.3

So P(R and S) = 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3.

Wait, that would give 0.3, which is option C. But let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the first statement. Suppose the meteorologist says the probability of rain and no sun is 30%, which is P(R and not S)=0.3.

We also have P(not R)=0.4, so P(R) = 0.6.

Now, the total probability space is 1. Let me think about all possible scenarios.

The events can be:

1. Rain and Sun: R and S
2. Rain and not Sun: R and not S = 0.3
3. Not Rain and Sun: not R and S
4. Not Rain and not Sun: not R and not S

We know that P(R and not S) =0.3.

We need to find P(R and S).

Since P(R) = P(R and S) + P(R and not S) = P(R and S) +0.3 =0.6.

So P(R and S) =0.6 -0.3= 0.3.

Alternatively, that would make the answer C:0.3.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because another approach is to think about the probabilities of sun and no sun.

The sum of all probabilities must be 1.

We have P(R and not S) =0.3.

P(not R) =0.4, which includes both not R and S, and not R and not S.

So P(not R) = P(not R and S) + P(not R and not S) = 0.4.

But we don't know either of those terms yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability of Sun is P(S) = P(R and S) + P(not R and S).

Similarly, P(not S) = P(R and not S) + P(not R and not S) =0.3 + something.

But without more information, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.

So P(R and S) =0.3, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. If the problem is asking for the probability of both rain and sun, perhaps it's considering that when it's raining, it's not sunny, so the probability would be zero. But that's not what the numbers say here.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the first statement. Let me read it again: "30% probability of rain and no sun." So that's P(Rain and no Sun) =0.3.

Then, the second statement is 40% probability of no rain, so P(No Rain)=0.4, which implies P(Rain) is 0.6.

So, the total P(Rain) is 0.6, which is the sum of P(Rain and Sun) and P(Rain and no Sun).

So, P(Rain and Sun) = P(Rain) - P(Rain and no Sun) =0.6 -0.3=0.3.

So that's 30%, option C.

But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the 30% is the probability of rain, and no sun is another event. Or maybe the problem is considering that rain and sun can't happen together, but that's not stated. So I should proceed with the given data.

So, the calculation gives 0.3, which is option C.

The problem involves determining the probability of both rain and sun occurring, given the following information:

1. The probability of rain and no sun is 30%, i.e., \( P(R \text{ and } \neg S) = 0.3 \).
2. The probability of no rain is 40%, i.e., \( P(\neg R) = 0.4 \), which implies \( P(R) = 1 - P(\neg R) = 0.6 \).

To find \( P(R \text{ and } S) \), we use the fact that the total probability of rain, \( P(R) \), can be broken down into two mutually exclusive events:
- Rain and sun (\( R \text{ and } S \))
- Rain and no sun (\( R \text{ and } \neg S \))

Thus, we have:
\[
P(R) = P(R \text{ and } S) + P(R \text{ and } \neg S)
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
0.6 = P(R \text{ and } S) + 0.3
\]

Solving for \( P(R \text{ and } S) \):
\[
P(R \text{ and } S) = 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3
\]

Therefore, the probability of both rain and sun is 0.3.
