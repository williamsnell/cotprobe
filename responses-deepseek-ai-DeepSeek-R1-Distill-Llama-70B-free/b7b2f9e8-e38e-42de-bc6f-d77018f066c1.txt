Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with colligative properties, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about boiling point elevation when a solute is dissolved in benzene. I remember that boiling point elevation is a colligative property, which depends on the number of solute particles in the solution. The formula for boiling point elevation is ΔT = Kb * m, where ΔT is the change in boiling point, Kb is the boiling point elevation constant for the solvent, and m is the molality of the solution.

Alright, the problem gives me some data. Let me jot down the important numbers:

First scenario:
- 1 mole of solute in 1000 g benzene.
- Boiling point of solution: 82.73°C.
- Benzene's normal boiling point is 80.10°C.
So the ΔT here is 82.73 - 80.10 = 2.63°C.

Second scenario:
- 1.2 g of elemental sulfur in 50 g benzene.
- Boiling point is 80.36°C.
So ΔT here is 80.36 - 80.10 = 0.26°C.

We need to find the molecular weight of sulfur. Hmm, right. Because if we can find the molality in the second case, we can find moles of sulfur, which will let us calculate its molar mass.

Wait, but first, I think I need to determine Kb for benzene using the first scenario, because that's where the solute is 1 mole in 1000 g solvent. Oh wait, that sounds like a 1m solution. Because molality is moles per kg solvent. So 1 mole in 1 kg (1000 g) is 1 m.

So in the first case, m is 1 mol/kg. Then ΔT is 2.63 = Kb * 1. So Kb must be 2.63°C·kg/mol.

Wait, that makes sense. So Kb for benzene is 2.63.

Now, using the second scenario. The sulfur is 1.2 g in 50 g benzene. So the mass of benzene is 50 g, which is 0.05 kg.

We can find the molality (m) of the sulfur solution using the formula:

ΔT = Kb * m

In this case, ΔT is 0.26°C. Kb is 2.63. So:

0.26 = 2.63 * m → m = 0.26 / 2.63 → let me calculate that.

Hmm, 0.26 divided by 2.63. Let me approximate. 2.63 is about 2.6. 0.26 / 2.6 is 0.1. But wait, let me do exact calculation.

2.63 * 0.1 = 0.263. Oh, our ΔT is 0.26, a bit less than 0.263. So m would be approximately 0.0988 ≈ 0.099 mol/kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 0.26 / 2.63 = ?

Let me compute 0.26 ÷ 2.63. Let's see:

2.63 goes into 0.26 how many times? 2.63 is larger than 0.26, so it's 0. something.

Let's compute 0.26 / 2.63:

2.63 * 0.1 = 0.263. Which is more than 0.26, so a bit less than 0.1. So 0.26 / 2.63 = approximately 0.099 m. So m ≈ 0.099 mol/kg.

Now, molality m is moles of solute per kg of solvent. The solvent here is 50 g = 0.05 kg. So moles = m * kg = 0.099 * 0.05 = 0.00495 moles.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, because m is in mol/kg. So if you have a solution where m is 0.099 mol/kg, and you have 0.05 kg of solvent, the moles of solute would be 0.099 * 0.05 = 0.00495 moles. Right.

So, the amount of sulfur in the second case is 0.00495 moles. But the mass of sulfur used is 1.2 grams. So, molar mass M is mass/moles → M = 1.2 g / 0.00495 mol.

Calculating that: 1.2 / 0.00495 → Let me compute this.

0.00495 is approximately 0.005. 1.2 / 0.005 is 240. But since it's 0.00495, it's a bit less than 240. Let me do exact calculation.

1.2 / 0.00495 = ?

Let's compute 0.00495 * 240 = 1.188. Hmm, 240 * 0.00495 = 1.188. But our numerator is 1.2. So 1.2 is 0.012 more than 1.188. So 0.012 / 0.00495 is approximately 2.424. So 240 + 2.424 ≈ 242.424 g/mol.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.2 ÷ 0.00495.

0.00495 is 4.95e-3. 1.2 / 0.00495 = (1.2 * 1000) / 4.95 = 1200 / 4.95.

So 4.95 * 242 = let's see. 4.95 * 240 = 1188. 4.95 *2 =9.9 → 1188 + 9.9= 1197.9. So 4.95 * 242 = 1197.9. But 1200 is 2.1 more than 1197.9. So 242 + (2.1 /4.95) → 2.1/4.95 is about 0.424 → 242.424. So M ≈ 242.4 g/mol.

But let me think: none of the options is 242. Let me check the options. The options are A:180, B:420, C:600, D:300, E:240, F:480, G:90, H:150, I:120, J:360.

Hmm, option E is 240. Close to our calculation of 242.4, which is approximately 240. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check each step.

Let me start over.

First, Kb calculation. First case: 1 mole in 1000 g (1 kg) benzene. So m = 1 mol/kg.

Boiling point increases by 2.63°C, which is ΔT = Kb * m → 2.63 = Kb * 1 → Kb = 2.63°C kg/mol.

Second case: 1.2 g S in 50 g benzene → 0.05 kg solvent.

ΔT is 80.36 -80.10 = 0.26°C.

So m = ΔT / Kb → 0.26 / 2.63 ≈ 0.0988 mol/kg.

Wait, yes. So m is 0.0988 mol/kg.

Molality is moles per kg of solvent. So in 0.05 kg solvent, moles of S is 0.0988 * 0.05 = 0.00494 moles.

Mass of S is 1.2 grams. So molar mass M = mass / moles = 1.2 / 0.00494 ≈ let's compute 1.2 ÷ 0.00494.

Wait, 0.00494 is approximately 0.005. 1.2 /0.005 is 240. But more accurately:

Compute 1.2 / 0.00494 → let me compute 0.00494 * 242 = ?

0.00494 *240 = 1.1856.

0.00494 *2=0.00988.

Total 1.19548. Which is close to 1.2. So 242 would give 1.19548, which is 0.00452 less than 1.2. So perhaps 242 gives 1.19548, and 243 would give 0.00494 *243 = let's see:

243 - 240 =3. So 0.00494 *3 =0.01482. So 1.19548 + 0.01482=1.2103.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just compute 1.2 / 0.00494.

Let me compute 1.2 ÷ 0.00494.

I'll write it as 1200 ÷ 4.94.

4.94 * 242 = 4.94*240=1185.6 + 4.94*2=9.88 → 1195.48.

1200 - 1195.48 =4.52.

So 4.52 /4.94 = approx 0.915.

So 242 + 0.915 = 242.915 → approx 242.92 g/mol.

Hmm, that's about 243 g/mol. But the options don't have that. The closest option is E:240, which is 240. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles of sulfur.

Wait, let me recalculate.

In the second case:

m = 0.26 / 2.63 → let me compute this precisely.

2.63 goes into 0.26 how many times? Let me do the division:

0.26 ÷ 2.63.

Let me compute 0.26 / 2.63.

First, 2.63 × 0.1 = 0.263. That's larger than 0.26, so 0.1 is too much. So perhaps 0.0988.

0.0988 × 2.63 → let me compute:

0.09 *2.63 = 0.2367.

0.0088 *2.63 → 0.023144.

Adding together, 0.2367 +0.023144= 0.259844. So 0.0988 *2.63=0.259844, which is just a bit less than 0.26. So 0.26 -0.259844 = 0.000156. So, perhaps 0.0988 + (0.000156 / 2.63) ≈ 0.0988 + 0.000059≈ 0.098859. So m=0.098859 mol/kg.

So m=0.098859.

Then, in 0.05 kg of solvent, moles of S = 0.098859 *0.05 = 0.00494295 moles.

Mass of S is 1.2 grams, so M = 1.2 / 0.00494295 → let me compute that.

1.2 ÷ 0.00494295 → let me write as 1200 ÷ 4.94295.

Compute 4.94295 × 242 = ?

4.94295 × 240 = 4.94295 *200= 988.59, 4.94295*40=197.718 → total 988.59 +197.718= 1186.308.

4.94295 *2=9.8859 → 1186.308 +9.8859= 1196.1939.

So 4.94295 ×242=1196.1939.

But we have 1200. So 1200 -1196.1939=3.8061.

So 3.8061 /4.94295 ≈ 0.77. So 242.77 → approximately 242.77 g/mol.

That's about 243. So no option is 243, but option E is 240. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in Kb?

Wait, let me double-check Kb. In the first scenario, 1 mole in 1000 g (1 kg) → m=1. Boiling point increases by 2.63°C. So Kb=2.63. That seems right.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact numbers without approximation.

Let me compute m in the second case more accurately:

ΔT =0.26 = Kb * m → m=0.26 /2.63 = let's compute that.

0.26 ÷ 2.63.

Let me write it as 26 / 263 (since I multiplied numerator and denominator by 100).

26 ÷ 263 = ?

Let me compute 263 × 0.0988 → 263 ×0.09=23.67; 263 ×0.0088=2.3124 → total 25.9824. That's close to 26. So 0.0988.

So m=0.0988 mol/kg.

Moles of S in 0.05 kg solvent: 0.0988 *0.05 = 0.00494 mol.

Mass of S is 1.2 g → M=1.2 /0.00494 = ?

1.2 ÷ 0.00494 = 242.7 g/mol.

So about 243. But the options don't have that. Hmm. But wait, the problem says that the solute in the first case is 1 mole, but perhaps it's not sulfur. Oh wait, in the first case, it's a different solute, but in the second case, it's sulfur.

Wait, no. The first case is a general solute. The second case is sulfur, so perhaps sulfur is not a strong electrolyte, so it doesn't dissociate. So the van't Hoff factor is 1.

Wait, but I'm getting a molecular weight of about 243, which is not an option. The options are A:180, E:240, J:360, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check all steps again.

First, Kb calculation:

First case: 1 mole in 1000g (1kg) → m=1.

Boiling point goes from 80.10 to 82.73 → ΔT=2.63°C.

So Kb=ΔT/m =2.63 /1 =2.63°C·kg/mol. Correct.

Second case: 1.2g S in 50g benzene (0.05kg). Boiling point 80.36 → ΔT=0.26°C.

So m=0.26/2.63 ≈0.0988 mol/kg.

Moles of S = m * kg =0.0988 *0.05 =0.00494 mol.

Mass of S is 1.2g, so M=1.2g /0.00494mol ≈242.7 g/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. Wait, the options have E:240, which is close. Maybe the approximation is intended to give 240.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb. Wait, perhaps I should calculate Kb more accurately.

Wait, in the first case, the solution's boiling point is 82.73°C. So ΔT is 82.73-80.10=2.63. Correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem uses the formula with the solution's molality, but perhaps the first case isn't exactly 1.000 mole. Let me check the first case again.

Wait, the first case says 1 mole of a solute in 1000g benzene. So m=1mol/1kg=1m. So Kb=2.63°C·kg/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should compute m in the second case using more precise numbers.

Wait, let me recompute m:

m=ΔT / Kb =0.26 /2.63.

Let me compute 0.26 divided by 2.63.

2.63 × 0.1 = 0.263. Which is larger than 0.26, so m is 0.1 - some small amount.

Compute 0.26 ÷ 2.63:

2.63 × 0.0988 = ?

0.0988 ×2 =0.1976.

0.0988 ×0.63 = 0.062244.

Total 0.1976 +0.062244=0.259844. So 2.63 ×0.0988=0.259844.

Which is 0.000156 less than 0.26. So 0.0988 + (0.000156/2.63) = 0.0988 + 0.000059≈0.098859.

So m=0.098859 mol/kg.

Then, moles of S =0.098859 *0.05 kg =0.00494295 mol.

Mass is 1.2g. So M=1.2 /0.00494295 ≈ 242.7 g/mol.

Hmm, but that's not among the options. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to round it to 240, which is option E. But why?

Wait, let's see: 1.2g /0.005 mol =240 g/mol. Because 0.005 is 1/200. 1.2 *200 = 240.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to approximate m as 0.1, leading to:

m=0.26 /2.63 ≈0.1 → 0.1 mol/kg.

Then, moles of S =0.1 *0.05 kg =0.005 mol.

M=1.2g /0.005 mol=240 g/mol. So option E:240.

Ah, I see. So perhaps the question expects us to approximate Kb or m to make the calculation simpler.

So the correct answer would be E:240.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the concept of boiling point elevation, a colligative property, which is given by the formula:

\[
\Delta T = K_b \cdot m
\]

where:
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in boiling point,
- \(K_b\) is the boiling point elevation constant for the solvent,
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kg of solvent).

### Step 1: Determine \(K_b\) for benzene
From the first scenario:
- 1 mole of solute is dissolved in 1000 g (1 kg) of benzene, making the molality \(m
