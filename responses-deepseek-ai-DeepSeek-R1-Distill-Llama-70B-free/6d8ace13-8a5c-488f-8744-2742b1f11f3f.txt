Okay, so I've got this tax question here about Johnson and his fringe benefits. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. Johnson works for ABC Co. and earns a salary of $100,000. He also gets group term life insurance as a fringe benefit, and the coverage is twice his salary. The IRS has an annual uniform cost of insurance at $2.76 per $1,000. I need to find out how much Johnson must include in his gross income.

Hmm, I remember that group term life insurance is a type of fringe benefit, and the taxable part is based on the cost of the insurance above a certain threshold. I think the rule is that the first $50,000 of coverage is non-taxable, but anything beyond that is considered taxable income to the employee.

So Johnson's coverage is twice his salary, which is 2 * $100,000 = $200,000. The first $50k is tax-free, so the taxable amount is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.

Now, to find out how much this taxable amount adds to his income, we need to calculate the cost using the IRS's uniform rate. The rate is $2.76 per $1,000 of coverage. So for $150,000, it's 150 * $2.76.

Wait, let me compute that: 150,000 divided by 1,000 is 150. So 150 * 2.76. Let me do the math. 150 * 2 is 300, and 150 * 0.76 is 114. So 300 + 114 equals 414. So that's $414.

So Johnson's salary is $100,000, and he includes $414 from the life insurance. So his total gross income would be 100,000 + 414 = $100,414.

Looking at the options, option D is $100,414. So the answer should be D.

To determine the amount Johnson must include in his gross income, we analyze the taxable portion of the group term life insurance (GTLI) he received as a fringe benefit. 

1. **Calculate the Total Insurance Coverage**:  
   Johnson’s coverage is twice his salary:  
   \[
   2 \times \$100,000 = \$200,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Taxable Portion of the Coverage**:  
   The first \$50,000 of GTLI coverage is non-taxable. The taxable amount is:  
   \[
   \$200,000 - \$50,000 = \$150,000
   \]

3. **Compute the Cost of the Taxable Coverage**:  
   The IRS uniform cost of insurance is \$2.76 per \$1,000 of coverage. For \$150,000:  
   \[
   \frac{\$150,000}{\$1,000} \times \$2.76 = 150 \times \$2.76 = \$414
   \]

4. **Calculate Total Gross Income**:  
   Johnson’s salary plus the taxable cost of the insurance:  
   \[
   \$100,000 + \$414 = \$100,414
   \]

Thus, the amount Johnson must include in his gross income is \$100,414. The correct answer is:

**D: $100,414**
