Okay, so I've got this problem where Mr. Scaccioborrows $100 from his credit union. He agrees to pay back $20 a month, and there's an interest of 1% per month on the unpaid balance. I need to figure out how much he'll end up paying in total. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I think I should understand how the payments work. He's paying $20 each month, but part of that might go towards the interest, and the rest would reduce the principal amount. Because the interest is on the unpaid balance, the interest each month will decrease as the principal goes down.

Wait, so the first month, the interest would be 1% of $100, right? That's $1. So he pays $20, but $1 is interest, so the remaining $19 goes to the principal. So the new balance after the first payment would be $100 - $19 = $81.

Then the second month, the interest is 1% of $81, which is $0.81. He pays another $20, so the interest is subtracted, leaving $19.19 to go towards the principal. So the new balance is $81 - $19.19 = $61.81.

Third month: interest is 1% of $61.81, which is approximately $0.6181. So he pays $20, so $0.6181 is interest, and $19.3819 goes to principal. New balance: $61.81 - $19.3819 = $42.4281.

Fourth month: interest is 1% of $42.4281, which is about $0.4243. He pays $20, so $0.4243 is interest, leaving $19.5757 for principal. New balance: $42.4281 - $19.5757 = $22.8524.

Fifth month: interest is 1% of $22.8524, which is $0.2285. So the payment of $20 would have $0.2285 as interest, and $19.7715 towards principal. New balance: $22.8524 - $19.7715 = $3.0809.

Wait, but after the fifth payment, the balance is about $3.08. But he's paying $20 each month, so in the sixth month, would he just pay the remaining amount plus interest? Or does he continue paying $20 until it's all paid off?

Hmm, maybe I should check how many payments he needs to make until the balance is zero. Let me try to calculate each step.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula to calculate the total interest paid. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. Since each month the payment is $20, and the interest is applied on the remaining balance, it's an amortizing loan. So each payment covers the interest, and the rest goes to principal.

Wait, but the question is asking how much he pays, not how many payments. Oh, no, wait, the question is how much he pays in total. Wait, no, the options are all around $100 to $120, so maybe he's paying it off in 6 months or so.

Wait, let me try to compute each month's payment and see when the balance reaches zero.

Month 1:
Principal: $100
Interest: 1% of 100 = $1
Payment: $20 → $19 to principal
Balance: $100 - $19 = $81

Month 2:
Principal: $81
Interest: 1% of 81 = $0.81
Payment: $20 → $19.19 to principal
Balance: $81 - $19.19 = $61.81

Month 3:
Principal: $61.81
Interest: 0.01 * 61.81 ≈ $0.6181
Payment: $20 → $19.3819 to principal
Balance: $61.81 - $19.3819 ≈ $42.4281

Month 4:
Principal: ≈$42.4281
Interest: ≈0.01 * 42.4281 ≈ $0.4243
Payment: $20 → $19.5757 to principal
Balance: ≈$42.4281 - $19.5757 ≈ $22.8524

Month 5:
Principal: ≈$22.8524
Interest: 0.01 * 22.8524 ≈ $0.2285
Payment: $20 → $19.7715 to principal
Balance: ≈$22.8524 - $19.7715 ≈ $3.0809

So after month 5, the balance is about $3.08. Now, in month 6, he would have to pay the remaining balance plus interest.

So the next payment would be: interest on $3.0809 is 0.01 * 3.0809 ≈ $0.0308. So the total payment would be $3.0809 + $0.0308 ≈ $3.1117. But since he's been paying $20 each month, maybe he just pays that amount in the sixth month, but wait, that's overpaying. So perhaps he only needs to pay the remaining balance plus interest in the sixth month.

So total payments would be 5 months of $20 each, which is $100, plus the sixth month's payment of approximately $3.11, making the total around $103.11. Looking at the options, option J is $103.00, which is close.

Wait, but let me check the exact figures because approximations might be off. Let me recalculate more precisely.

Let me create a table:

Month | Payment | Interest | Principal Paid | Balance After Payment
-----|---------|---------|---------------|-----------------------
1    | $20     | $1.00   | $19.00        | $81.00
2    | $20     | $0.81   | $19.19        | $61.81
3    | $20     | $0.6181 | $19.3819      | $42.4281
4    | $20     | $0.424281| $19.575719   | $22.852381
5    | $20     | $0.22852381| $19.77147619| $3.08090481
6    | $3.0809 + interest. Interest is $0.030809 ≈ $3.1117.

So total paid is 5*$20 = $100, plus $3.1117, totaling approximately $103.11. So the closest option is J: $103.00.

But wait, perhaps I should think about whether the interest is applied each month and whether the last payment is adjusted. Alternatively, maybe the total amount paid is calculated differently. Let me think: each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance, then the payment is applied.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for the total amount paid. The total amount would be principal plus total interest over the period.

But perhaps it's simpler to just simulate each month until the balance is zero.

Wait, perhaps I should see if the balance after five payments is $3.08, so the sixth payment will be that amount plus interest. So total payment is 5 * 20 = 100, plus the sixth payment of about 3.11, totaling 103.11. So the correct answer would be J: $103.00.

Wait, but another way: let me compute the exact interest each month without rounding.

Starting balance: $100.

Month 1:
Interest = 100 * 0.01 = $1.00.
Payment = $20. So principal paid = $19.00.
Balance = 100 - 19 = $81.0000.

Month 2:
Interest = 81 * 0.01 = $0.81.
Payment = $20. Principal paid = 20 - 0.81 = $19.19.
Balance = 81 - 19.19 = $61.81.

Month 3:
Interest = 61.81 * 0.01 = $0.6181.
Payment = $20. Principal paid = 20 - 0.6181 = $19.3819.
Balance = 61.81 - 19.3819 = $42.4281.

Month 4:
Interest = 42.4281 * 0.01 = $0.424281.
Payment = $20. Principal paid = 20 - 0.424281 = $19.575719.
Balance = 42.4281 - 19.575719 = $22.852381.

Month 5:
Interest = 22.852381 * 0.01 = $0.22852381.
Payment = $20. Principal paid = 20 - 0.22852381 = $19.77147619.
Balance = 22.852381 - 19.77147619 = $3.08090481.

Month 6:
Interest = 3.08090481 * 0.01 = $0.0308090481.
Total payment needed: 3.08090481 + 0.0308090481 = $3.1117138581.

So total payments: 5 * 20 = $100, plus $3.1117, total $103.1117.

The options include J as $103.00, which is the closest. So the answer should be J.

To determine how much Mr. Scaccioborrows pays in total, we analyze the loan repayment process. He borrows $100 at an interest rate of 1% per month on the unpaid balance and makes fixed monthly payments of $20. Each payment consists of interest and principal, with the interest calculated on the remaining balance at the start of the month.

### Month-by-Month Breakdown:
1. **Month 1**:  
   - Interest: $100 * 1% = $1.00  
   - Principal paid: $20 - $1.00 = $19.00  
   - Balance: $100 - $19.00 = $81.00  

2. **Month 2**:  
   - Interest: $81.00 * 1% = $0.81  
   - Principal paid: $20 - $0.81 = $19.19  
   - Balance: $81.00 - $19.19 = $61.81  

3. **Month 3**:  
   - Interest: $61.81 * 1% ≈ $0.6181  
   - Principal paid: $20 - $0.6181 ≈ $19.3819  
   - Balance: $61.81 - $19.3819 ≈ $42.4281  

4. **Month 4**:  
   - Interest: $42.4281 * 1% ≈ $0.4243  
   - Principal paid: $20 - $0.4243 ≈ $19.5757  
   - Balance: $42.4281 - $19.5757 ≈ $22.8524  

5. **Month 5**:  
   - Interest: $22.8524 * 1% ≈ $0.2285  
   - Principal paid: $20 - $0.2285 ≈ $19.7715  
   - Balance: $22.8524 - $19.7715 ≈ $3.0809  

6. **Month 6**:  
   - Interest: $3.0809 * 1% ≈ $0.0308  
   - Total payment: $3.0809 + $0.0308 ≈ $3.1117  

### Total Payments:
- First 5 months: $20/month * 5 = $100.00  
- Month 6: $3.1117  
- **Total paid**: $100.00 + $3.1117 ≈ $103.11  

The closest option to the total payment is **$103.00**.
