Okay, so I have this problem about the evaporation rate of a volatile fuel. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem gives me a lot of parameters. Let's list them out to make sure I don't miss anything. The fuel is spilled on a flat surface and spreads to a depth of 1/4 inch and a length of 7 feet. The temperature is 60°F, and the vapor pressure is 2 psia. The physical properties given are the kinematic viscosity (nu) as 1e-5 ft²/sec, density (rho) as 54 lbm/ft³, and the diffusion coefficient (D_AB) as 0.55 ft²/hr. The air's kinematic viscosity is 1.62e-4 ft²/sec. There's a breeze blowing at 75°F, 15 mph, parallel to the fuel surface.

I'm supposed to find the evaporation rate, and the options are given as various lbm/hr-ft². 

Wait, evaporation rate... I remember that evaporation depends on several factors, including the vapor pressure of the liquid, the surrounding conditions like temperature and air movement, and diffusion properties. I think the formula might involve the mass transfer coefficient and the concentration gradient.

Right, the mass flux (evaporation rate) can be calculated using Fick's Law of diffusion. The general form is:

N = (D_AB / delta) * (C_s - C_infinity)

But wait, delta is the thickness of the boundary layer or the depth over which the concentration gradient exists. Alternatively, in some cases, especially with flowing air, the mass transfer coefficient (k) comes into play. The formula might also involve the Sherwood number, which relates to convective mass transfer.

Wait, another approach: the evaporation rate can be determined using the mass transfer coefficient multiplied by the concentration difference. The formula would be something like:

m" = k * (rho_air * Y_s - rho_air * Y_infinity)

But Y is the mass fraction. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact setup here. Alternatively, maybe using the equation with vapor pressure and considering the flow.

Wait, I think the more appropriate approach here is to calculate the mass transfer coefficient using the analogy between mass and momentum transfer. So, using the Sherwood number (Sh), which is the analogue of the Nusselt number for mass transfer.

The Sherwood number can be approximated for flow over a flat plate. The formula is Sh = (0.0296) * Re^(4/5) * Sc^(1/3), for Re > 10^5. But wait, maybe another correlation applies here, especially if the flow is laminar or turbulent.

Wait, the problem gives me the airspeed (15 mph) and the length over which it's flowing (7 ft). So, perhaps I can calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent.

Let me compute the Reynolds number (Re) for the airflow. Re is (u * L) / nu, where u is the velocity, L is the length, and nu is the kinematic viscosity of air.

First, I need to convert the breeze speed from mph to ft/s. Let's see, 15 mph. There are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour. So 15 mph = 15 * 5280 ft / 3600 s = 22 ft/s. Wait no, wait, 15 * 5280 = 79200 ft per hour. Divided by 3600 is 22 ft/s? Let me double-check. 5280/3600 is 1.4667 ft/s per mph. So 15 mph is 15 * 1.4667 ≈ 22 ft/s. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, wait, 60 mph is 88 ft/s, so 15 would be 22 ft/s. Yeah, that's correct.

So u = 22 ft/s, L = 7 ft, nu_air = 1.62e-4 ft²/s.

Re = (22 * 7) / 1.62e-4 = (154) / (0.000162) ≈ 154 / 0.000162 ≈ 950,370. Wait, that's almost a million. So Re is about 9.5e5, which is definitely in the turbulent flow regime. So the earlier correlation for Sh would apply.

The Sherwood number equation for turbulent flow over a flat plate is Sh = 0.0296 * Re^(4/5) * Sc^(1/3). 

But wait, what's the Schmidt number (Sc)? Sc is nu_air / D_AB. Oh, but wait, D_AB is given in ft²/hr. Hmm, because the units for Sc must be (ft²/s) / (ft²/s), since D_AB's units are m²/s or ft²/s. Wait, D_AB is given as 0.55 ft²/hr. Oh, that's a different unit. So I need to convert D_AB into ft²/s to compute Sc correctly.

Wait, 0.55 ft²/hr is equal to 0.55 / 3600 ft²/s ≈ 0.0001528 ft²/s.

So Sc = nu_air / D_AB = (1.62e-4 ft²/s) / (0.0001528 ft²/s) ≈ (1.62e-4) / (0.0001528) ≈ approximately 1.06. Let me compute this more accurately.

1.62e-4 is 0.000162. 0.000162 / 0.0001528 = 1.0606. So Sc ≈ 1.06.

Now, compute Sh.

Re is approx 9.5e5. Let me calculate Re^(4/5). So 9.5e5 is 950,000. 950,000^(0.8) ≈ since 1e6^0.8 is 1e4.8 (since 1e6 is 10^6, and 10^(6*(4/5))=10^(24/5)=10^4.8). 10^4.8 is about 63,095. So 950,000 is 0.95e6. So (0.95e6)^(0.8) = (0.95)^(0.8) * (1e6)^(0.8) ≈ 0.95^0.8 ≈ about 0.93, multiplied by 63,095 gives 58,700 approximately.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it numerically.

Re = 950,370.

Sh = 0.0296 * (950370)^(4/5) * (1.06)^(1/3).

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute Re^(4/5): 

Take natural log of Re: ln(950370) ≈ ln(950000) ≈ ln(9.5e5) = ln(9.5) + ln(1e5) ≈ 2.2518 + 11.5129 ≈ 13.7647.

Multiply by 4/5: 13.7647 * 0.8 ≈ 11.0118.

Exponentiate: e^11.0118 ≈ e^11 is about 59874, e^0.0118 is about 1.0119. So total is 59874 * 1.0119 ≈ 60542.

So Re^(4/5) ≈ 60542.

Now, multiply by 0.0296: 60542 * 0.0296 ≈ let's see, 60,000 * 0.03 = 1800, so 60542 * 0.0296 ≈ 60542 * 0.03 is about 1816, but subtract 60542*0.0004 (since 0.0296=0.03-0.0004) so 1816 - (60542 * 0.0004) = 1816 - 24.2168 ≈ 1791.78.

So 0.0296 * Re^(4/5) ≈ 1791.78.

Next, compute Sc^(1/3). Sc is 1.06, so cube root of 1.06 is approximately 1.0185 (since 1.0185^3 ≈ 1.06).

So Sh = 1791.78 * 1.0185 ≈ 1791.78 * 1.0185 ≈ approx 1823.

Wait, but wait, that seems high. Let me think: Sh is the Sherwood number, which relates the convective mass transfer. So Sh is about 1823.

Now, the mass transfer coefficient k_c (in ft/s) is Sh * D_AB / L. Wait, yes: k_c = Sh * D_AB / L.

Wait, D_AB is in ft²/hr, but when we use it in this formula, it must have consistent units. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, Sh = (k_c * L) / D_AB. So solving for k_c, we get k_c = Sh * D_AB / L.

Wait, but D_AB is in ft²/hr. L is in ft. So the units would be (ft²/hr) / ft = ft/hr. So k_c would be in ft/s if D_AB is ft²/s. Oh, wait, but in our case D_AB is 0.55 ft²/hr, so 0.55/3600 ft²/s.

Wait, perhaps I should convert D_AB to ft²/s before using it. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, let me compute k_c in consistent units.

Sh is dimensionless. So k_c = Sh * D_AB / L.

D_AB is 0.55 ft²/hr, which is 0.55/3600 ft²/s. So D_AB = 0.55 / 3600 = 0.0001527778 ft²/s.

So k_c = Sh * D_AB / L. Sh is 1823, D_AB is 0.0001527778 ft²/s, L is 7 ft.

So k_c = 1823 * 0.0001527778 / 7.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 1823 * 0.0001527778 ≈ 1823 * 0.00015 = 0.27345, but more accurately:

0.0001527778 = approx 1.527778e-4.

1823 * 1.527778e-4 = let me compute 1823 * 1.527778e-4.

Compute 1823 * 1.527778e-4:

First, 1823 * 1.527778 = let's compute that.

1823 * 1.5 = 2734.5

1823 * 0.027778 ≈ 1823 * 0.027 = approx 49.221

So total is approximately 2734.5 + 49.221 ≈ 2783.721.

But wait, wait, that's 1823 * 1.527778, but since it's multiplied by 1e-4, the actual value is 2783.721e-4 = 0.2783721.

So k_c = 0.2783721 /7 ≈ 0.03976317 ft/s.

Wait, so k_c is approximately 0.03976 ft/s.

Now, the mass transfer rate (evaporation rate) is given by:

m" = k_c * (rho_fuel) * (Y_fuel_surface - Y_infinity)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expression here. Alternatively, another approach is to use the equation:

m" = (P_vapor * M) / (R * T) * (k_c)

Wait, perhaps that's another way. Let me think. The molar flux can be expressed as m" = (k_c / D_AB) * (C_s - C_infinity). Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the mass transfer using the equation:

m" = (k_c * rho_air) * (Y_s - Y_inf)

But I'm not entirely sure about the correct formula. Alternatively, considering that the mass transfer is driven by the concentration gradient, and using the mass transfer coefficient.

Wait, another approach: the evaporation rate can be determined using the formula involving the vapor pressure and the mass transfer coefficient.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is m" = (k_c * P_vapor * M) / (R T)

Wait, let's think in terms of molar concentration. The molar concentration at the surface is C_s = P_vapor / (R T). The molar concentration in the air far away is C_inf, which is zero if the air is fresh. So the molar flux N is k_c * (C_s - C_inf) = k_c * C_s.

So N = k_c * (P_vapor) / (R T). 

But then, to get the mass flux m", we multiply by the molar mass M:

m" = N * M = (k_c * P_vapor * M) / (R T).

Wait, that sounds plausible.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the units here. Let me check the units.

k_c is in ft/s. P_vapor is in psia, which is lb/in². R is the gas constant. M is the molar mass.

Hmm, perhaps I should convert P_vapor into appropriate units. Let me think about the units in more detail.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, so concentration C (n/V) is P/(RT). So C has units of (lb-force/in²) * (1/(ft·lb_m/(R T)))).

Wait, perhaps it's better to use consistent units. Let me convert P_vapor to lb-ft units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the molar concentration C_s as P_vapor divided by (R T). But I need to ensure the units are consistent.

Wait, P_vapor is given as 2 psia, which is 2 lb/in².

R is the universal gas constant. Let me use R in units of ft·lb_force/(lb_mol·R).

Wait, R is 10.7316 ft·lb_force/(lb_mol·R).

So, T is 75°F. Wait, no, the breeze is at 75°F, but the fuel is at 60°F. Hmm, wait, the problem says the fuel is at 60°F, and the breeze is at 75°F. So which temperature do I use for the gas phase?

I think the temperature in the denominator would be the temperature of the gas, which is the air's temperature, so 75°F. Because the vapor is in the air, which is at 75°F.

So T is 75°F, which is 459.67 +75 = 534.67 R.

So C_s = P_vapor / (R T) = (2 lb/in²) / (10.7316 ft·lb_force/(lb_mol·R) * 534.67 R).

Wait, units need to be consistent. Let me convert P_vapor into lb_force/ft².

1 lb/in² = 144 lb/ft². So 2 psia = 2 * 144 = 288 lb/ft².

So C_s = (288 lb/ft²) / (10.7316 ft·lb_force/(lb_mol·R) * 534.67 R)

Compute the denominator: 10.7316 * 534.67 ≈ 10.7316 * 500 = 5365.8, 10.7316 * 34.67 ≈ 372. So total ≈ 5365.8 + 372 ≈ 5737.8.

So denominator ≈ 5737.8 ft·lb_force/(lb_mol).

So C_s = 288 / 5737.8 ≈ 0.0502 lb_mol/ft³.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 10.7316 * 534.67 = let me compute it step by step.

534.67 * 10 = 5346.7

534.67 * 0.7316 ≈ 534.67 * 0.7 = 374.269, 534.67 * 0.0316 ≈ 16.88. So total ≈ 374.269 + 16.88 ≈ 391.15.

So total 5346.7 + 391.15 ≈ 5737.85.

So denominator is 5737.85 lb_force·ft/(lb_mol·R) * R → the R cancels, so units are lb_force·ft/(lb_mol).

Wait, no, wait. The R in the denominator was in the denominator of R, so when I multiply, it's 10.7316 ft·lb_force/(lb_mol·R) * T in R → so the R units cancel out.

So denominator is 5737.85 ft·lb_force/(lb_mol).

So C_s = 288 lb_force/ft² / (5737.85 ft·lb_force/(lb_mol)) )

Hmm, the units: (lb/ft²) / (ft·lb/(lb_mol)) ) → (lb/ft²) * (lb_mol)/(ft·lb) ) → (lb_mol)/(ft^3).

So yes, correct units.

So C_s = 288 / 5737.85 ≈ 0.0502 lb_mol/ft³.

Wait, let me compute 288 / 5737.85.

5737.85 * 0.05 = 286.8925 → which is close to 288. So 0.05 is 286.89, so 288 is approximately 0.05 + (288 - 286.89)/5737.85 → 1.11/5737.85 ≈ 0.000193 → so 0.050193 ≈ 0.0502 lb_mol/ft³.

So C_s ≈ 0.0502 lb_mol/ft³.

Assuming that the concentration in the air is zero (C_inf ≈ 0), the molar flux N is k_c * C_s.

k_c is 0.03976 ft/s.

So N = 0.03976 ft/s * 0.0502 lb_mol/ft³ ≈ 0.001994 lb_mol/(s·ft²).

But we need the mass flux in lb_m/hr-ft². So we need to convert lb_mol/(s·ft²) to lb_m/(hr·ft²).

First, multiply by the molar mass M of the fuel. But wait, I don't think the molar mass was given. Oh wait, perhaps I can find it from the given density and
