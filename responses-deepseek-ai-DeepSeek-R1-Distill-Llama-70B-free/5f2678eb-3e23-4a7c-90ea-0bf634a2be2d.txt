Okay, so I've got this question about a shunt motor's field winding and the power it uses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on motors, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, the question says the field winding has a resistance of 110 ohms, and the voltage applied is 220 volts. I need to find the power expended in the field excitation. Right, power in electrical terms usually relates to voltage, current, and resistance.

Wait, I remember that power can be calculated in a few ways. Oh right, the basic formula is P = V * I, but another formula uses P = I² * R or P = V² / R. Since I have both voltage and resistance, maybe using V squared over R would work here.

So let me jot that down. The formula would be P = V² / R. Plugging in the values, that's 220 squared divided by 110. Let's compute that. 220 squared is 220 * 220. 200 squared is 40,000, and 20 squared is 400, so 220 squared is 48,400. Right, because (200+20)^2 is 200² + 2*200*20 + 20² = 40,000 + 8,000 + 400 = 48,400.

So 48,400 divided by 110. Let me do that division. 48,400 ÷ 110. Hmm, 110 times 400 is 44,000. Subtract that from 48,400 and you get 4,400 left. Now 110 times 40 is 4,400. So 400 + 40 = 440. So the power is 440 watts. Oh wait, but wait a second, let me double-check that.

Alternatively, I could calculate the current first using Ohm's law. V=IR, so I = V/R. 220 volts divided by 110 ohms is 2 amperes. Then, power is V * I, which is 220 * 2 = 440 watts. Same result. Okay, that makes me more confident.

Looking at the options, option H is 440 watts. So the answer should be H. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up shunt and series motors. Oh, wait, in a shunt motor, the field winding is connected across the same voltage as the supply, so the voltage applied to the field is indeed 220 volts. So I think the calculation is correct.

To determine the power expended in the field excitation of the shunt motor, we use the formula for power in terms of voltage and resistance:

\[
P = \frac{V^2}{R}
\]

Given:
- Voltage (\(V\)) = 220 volts
- Resistance (\(R\)) = 110 ohms

Substituting the values:

\[
P = \frac{220^2}{110} = \frac{48,400}{110} = 440 \, \text{watts}
\]

This calculation can also be verified by first finding the current using Ohm's law (\(I = \frac{V}{R}\)):

\[
I = \frac{220}{110} = 2 \, \text{amperes}
\]

Then, calculating power as \(P = V \cdot I\):

\[
P = 220 \cdot 2 = 440 \, \text{watts}
\]

Both methods yield the same result. Therefore, the power expended in the field excitation is 440 watts.

The correct answer is **H: 440 watts**.
