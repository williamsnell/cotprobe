Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about Helms’s White Racial Identity Development Model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is asking in which stage a White therapist would be most successful when working with a client from an ethnic or racial minority group. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the model describes the process White individuals go through to develop their racial identity. It's about how they become aware of their own race and how they view others. The stages probably help therapists understand themselves better to be more effective in cross-racial counseling.

I think the stages are something like: contact, disintegration, reintegration, pseudo-independence, immersion-emersion, and then integrative awareness or autonomy. Or maybe internalization is another term. Wait, I might be mixing up some terms here.

So the contact stage is the initial phase where people don't really think much about race because they've had little exposure. Then, as they encounter different races, they might experience disintegration, where their previous views are challenged, leading to confusion or anxiety. After that, reintegration might be where they try to find a new sense of identity, perhaps by idealizing their own race again. Then pseudo-independence is when they start to reject their old views but aren't fully secure yet. Then immersion-emersion, where they delve into understanding their own race's experiences, and finally, the integrative awareness stage where they can see multiple perspectives and integrate them into a healthy identity.

Wait, the model might have six stages. Let me try to list them in order. I think it's:

1. Contact: No awareness of race issues.
2. Disintegration: Becoming aware, leading to confusion.
3. Reintegration: Return to a more rigid, perhaps pro-White stance.
4. Pseudo-independence: Starting to question but not fully there.
5. Immersion/Emersion: Deep exploration of one's own whiteness and what it means.
6. Autonomy/Integrative Awareness: Able to see and appreciate all perspectives without the previous biases.

So the question is about when the therapist is in which stage they'd be most effective with minority clients.

I think the later stages are better because the therapist would have worked through their own biases and be more aware of their racial identity. So if they're in the autonomy or integrative awareness stage, they can approach the client without projecting their own racial issues.

Looking back at the options, D is integrative awareness, H is internalization, and J is autonomy. Wait, I'm a bit confused because some sources might use different terms. I think the last stage is autonomy or sometimes called internalization-commitment. Or maybe integrative awareness is another term for the same thing.

Wait, another thought: the model has two phases, maybe? Or perhaps the stages are Contact, Disintegration, Reintegration, Pseudo-independence, Immersion, and then Autonomy.

So, when a therapist is in the autonomy stage, they have a secure sense of their own racial identity, which means they can more effectively navigate cross-racial therapeutic relationships. They can understand the client's experiences without their own issues getting in the way.

So looking at the options again, the last stage would be either autonomy (J) or integrative awareness (D). I'm trying to remember which term is correct in the model. I think Helms uses the term "Autonomy" as the final stage. But wait, another possibility is that the integrative awareness is the later stage, which might be the same as autonomy. Or perhaps the answer is that the therapist is in the internalization stage.

Alternatively, I might have the stages mixed up. Let me think again: Contact, Disintegration, Reintegration, Pseudo-independence, Immersion-Emersion, and then Integrative Awareness. So the last stage is integrative awareness. So if that's the case, the answer would be D.

But I'm a bit uncertain because some sources might refer to the final stage as autonomy. So I'm trying to recall. For example, in some models, autonomy is the last stage where the person can interact without the previous biases.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is D: integrative awareness. Because in this stage, the therapist can see their own racial identity and the client's, and integrate all perspectives. So they're more effective.

So the options are A: contact, B: immersion-emersion, C: pseudo-independence, D: integrative awareness, E: pre-encounter, F: immersion, G: reintegration, H: internalization, I: disintegration, J: autonomy.

I think the correct answer is D: integrative awareness. Because in that stage, the therapist has a balanced understanding and can work effectively with clients from other backgrounds.

The question asks which stage of Helms’s White Racial Identity Development Model a White therapist would be most successful in when working with a client from an ethnic/racial minority group. The model describes the stages White individuals go through to develop their racial identity, with the later stages representing greater self-awareness and reduced bias.

The stages, in order, are as follows:

1. **Contact**: Initial lack of awareness of race issues.
2. **Disintegration**: Awareness leads to confusion and anxiety.
3. **Reintegration**: A return to rigid, often pro-White views.
4. **Pseudo-independence**: Questioning old views but not fully secure.
5. **Immersion-Emersion**: Deep exploration of one's own whiteness.
6. **Integrative Awareness (Autonomy)**: Ability to see and appreciate multiple perspectives without bias.

In the final stage, **Integrative Awareness**, the therapist has worked through their biases and developed a secure racial identity, enabling them to interact effectively with clients from other backgrounds. This stage is also sometimes referred to as **Autonomy** in other models, but based on the options provided, **Integrative Awareness (D)** is the correct answer.

Answer: D
