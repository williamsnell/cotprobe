Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about abelian groups. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but let me think through this.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says, "Every free abelian group is torsion-free." Statement 2 claims, "Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group." I need to determine if each statement is true or false and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Starting with Statement 1: Every free abelian group is torsion-free. Wait, what's a free abelian group? From what I remember, a free abelian group is one that has a basis, meaning every element can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients. Torsion-free means that there's no non-identity element with finite order; in other words, the only element that satisfies nx = 0 for some positive integer n is x=0. So in a free abelian group, since the elements are like vectors in a vector space but over the integers, there shouldn't be any torsion. For example, the integers Z are free abelian and torsion-free. So Statement 1 seems true.

Now, Statement 2: Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group. Hmm, I think I remember something about this. I recall that for finitely generated abelian groups, the fundamental theorem says that every such group can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic groups. If the group is torsion-free, then those cyclic groups must all be infinite cyclic, which are isomorphic to Z. So a finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a direct sum of copies of Z, which makes it free abelian. So Statement 2 is also true.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, no, I think I'm right. Because in the finitely generated case, being torsion-free does imply that it's free abelian. Because if it's finitely generated and torsion-free, it's a free Z-module. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true. Let me look at the options. Option I says both are true. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake? Because sometimes people confuse things like projective modules or other structures. But no, in the case of abelian groups, which are Z-modules, the structure theorem says finitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free. So I think I'm correct.

Statement 1: "Every free abelian group is torsion-free."  
A free abelian group is one with a basis, where every element can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients. Since there are no non-trivial elements of finite order (i.e., no torsion), this statement is **True**.

Statement 2: "Every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is a free abelian group."  
According to the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, such groups can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic groups. If the group is torsion-free, all cyclic components are infinite cyclic, which are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. This makes the group free abelian. Therefore, this statement is also **True**.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is:

I: True, True

Answer: I
