Question:

Tay-Sachs is a disease caused by a recessive allele. Individuals with the genetic disorder usually do not survive more than a few years, and thus are not able to reproduce and pass on the gene. What would explain how this allele and its associated disease is preserved in the population?

Options:

A: Occasionally the gene will instead increase the fitness of the individual.
B: Tay-Sachs is asymptomatic in people who are homozygous recessive.
C: The recessive allele is actually beneficial in certain environments.
D: The disease increases the fertility of those who carry it.
E: Tay-Sachs is a dominant disease, so carriers will show symptoms.
F: Spontaneous mutation converts the dominant allele to the recessive form.
G: Heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms.
H: The gene for Tay-Sachs also provides resistance to another disease.
I: The disease can be cured, so individuals with the disorder are able to reproduce.
J: The allele is not preserved and is actually decreasing in frequency.

Okay, so I have this genetics question about Tay-Sachs disease. Hmm, I remember that Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder, and it's recessive. So, the question is about why this allele is preserved in the population even though people with the disease don't survive long and can't pass it on.

Wait, so the disease is caused by a recessive allele. That means you need two copies of the allele to actually have the disease. People who are carriers (heterozygous) don't get the disease, right? Because recessive diseases only show up when both alleles are recessive.

So, the individuals who have the disease are homozygous recessive, and they don't survive to reproduce. But the carriers are heterozygous and don't get the disease. So, maybe the carriers can still pass on the allele. That makes sense because carriers don't show symptoms, so they can have children. If two carriers have a child, there's a chance that child could get two recessive alleles and have the disease.

But wait, the question is why the allele is preserved. If the carriers don't get the disease, they can still pass the allele to their offspring. So even though the affected individuals don't survive, the carriers do, and they can carry the allele forward.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Sometimes the gene increases fitness. I don't think that's the case for Tay-Sachs. It's a deadly disease, so probably doesn't help.

Option B: Asymptomatic in homozygous recessive. No, that's the opposite; the disease is symptomatic and deadly.

Option C: Recessive allele is beneficial in some environments. I'm not sure. I think that's more like sickle cell where being heterozygous gives malaria resistance. But for Tay-Sachs, I don't recall that.

Option D: Disease increases fertility of carriers. I don't think so. Carriers have normal fertility, I believe.

Option E: Tay-Sachs is dominant, so carriers show symptoms. No, it's recessive, so carriers don't show symptoms.

Option F: Spontaneous mutation converts dominant to recessive. That might contribute to new alleles, but I don't think that's the main reason it's preserved.

Option G: Heterozygous individuals show no symptoms. That's correct because they're carriers. So the allele can be passed on by carriers who don't get sick.

Option H: The gene provides resistance to another disease. I'm not sure about that. Maybe, but I don't remember that being the case for Tay-Sachs.

Option I: Disease can be cured, so they reproduce. No, historically, Tay-Sachs wasn't curable, so that's probably not it.

Option J: The allele is decreasing. Well, the question states that even though affected individuals don't pass it on, the allele is preserved. So J can't be right.

So, the correct reasoning is that carriers don't have the disease and can pass the allele. So the answer would be G: Heterozygous individuals show no symptoms.

Wait, but another thought: In some cases, like sickle cell, the heterozygous has a benefit. But for Tay-Sachs, I think the main reason is carriers don't show the disease, so the allele stays in the gene pool through them. So the answer is G.
</think>

The Tay-Sachs allele is preserved in the population because it is a recessive allele, meaning that individuals must inherit two copies (one from each parent) to manifest the disease. Heterozygous individuals, who carry only one copy of the recessive allele, do not exhibit symptoms and are therefore able to survive and reproduce. This allows them to pass the allele to their offspring, maintaining its presence in the gene pool. While the disease is fatal in homozygous recessive individuals, the fact that carriers are asymptomatic ensures the allele's persistence.

Option G correctly captures this explanation, as it highlights that heterozygous individuals show no symptoms, enabling the allele to be passed on without the disease affecting the carriers' ability to reproduce.

Answer: G
