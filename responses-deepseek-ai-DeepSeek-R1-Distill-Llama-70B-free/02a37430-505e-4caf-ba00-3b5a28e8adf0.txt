Question:

Two brothers who were in need of money approached their wealthy uncle's housekeeper and asked her to poison him. The brothers would inherit the uncle's estate when he died. The housekeeper agreed, but on the condition that they would pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. After the brothers agreed to her demand, the housekeeper decided to place some cyanide in the uncle's tea one morning. As the housekeeper was preparing the tea, the uncle was visited by his personal physician. When the housekeeper was ready to serve the tea, the uncle asked her to fix some tea for his physician also. The housekeeper did so and then carefully set the tea on the table so that the uncle's cup was facing him. However, when the physician reached over to get some sugar, he inadvertently took the uncle's cup with the cyanide and drank it. Seconds later, the physician died from the poison. Which of the following crimes are the brothers guilty of?

Options:

A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
B: Murder of both their uncle and the physician.
C: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
D: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.
E: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle and the physician.
F: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the housekeeper.
G: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
I: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle only.
J: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about criminal law, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question involves two brothers who approach their uncle's housekeeper to poison their uncle. They want to inherit his estate, so they agree to pay the housekeeper $10,000 from their inheritance. The housekeeper agrees and decides to put cyanide in the uncle's tea. But then, the uncle's physician arrives, and when the housekeeper serves the tea, she sets the cups in a way that the uncle's cup is facing him. However, the physician accidentally takes the uncle's cup, drinks it, and dies from the poison.

The question is asking which crimes the brothers are guilty of.

Hmm. Let me think about the elements here. So, the brothers approached the housekeeper and asked her to poison their uncle. That sounds like solicitation because they're asking someone else to commit a crime, specifically murder. So that might be one charge.

Then, the brothers and the housekeeper agreed to this plan. That agreement could be a conspiracy to commit murder. Conspiracy is when two or more people agree to commit a crime and take some step towards it. So the brothers would be part of that conspiracy, aiming to murder their uncle.

But things went wrong. The housekeeper prepared the tea with cyanide, intending for the uncle to drink it. However, the physician took the cup by mistake. So the intended victim was the uncle, but the victim who died was the physician.

Now, the brothers didn't intend for the physician to die. They wanted the uncle dead. So, what does that mean for their liability?

In criminal law, when you intend to kill one person but accidentally kill another, that's called transferred intent. But wait, transferred intent applies when the intent to kill one person is transferred to an unintended victim. So, if they intended to kill their uncle, and the act resulted in the physician's death, the brothers could be held liable for the murder of the physician under transferred intent.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Because the brothers didn't actually commit the act that caused the death; the housekeeper did. So, the brothers' liability would be through their conspiracy and any acts they're responsible for as part of that conspiracy.

So, the initial plan was to kill the uncle. The brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit the uncle's murder. But what about the physician's death? Since the brothers didn't intend to kill the physician, it's not murder in the traditional sense. But under the felony murder rule, if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, all participants can be held liable for murder, regardless of intent.

Wait, but the felony murder rule applies when the underlying felony is inherently dangerous. Here, the conspiracy to commit murder is a felony. So, during the commission of that felony (the act of poisoning, which is attempted murder or murder), any death that occurs would make all conspirators liable for murder, even if unintended.

So, the brothers might be guilty of the physician's murder under the felony murder doctrine.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider if the act that caused the death was within the scope of the conspiracy. The housekeeper was acting in furtherance of the conspiracy when she put the poison in the tea. The physician's death, although unintended, was a direct result of that act. So, the brothers, as co-conspirators, could be liable for that murder.

But wait, the brothers didn't personally commit the act; they just conspired. So under the law of conspiracy, each conspirator is liable for the crimes of other conspirators if those crimes are in furtherance of the conspiracy and could have been foreseen.

In this case, the housekeeper's act of poisoning the tea was in furtherance of the conspiracy. The unforeseeable act here is the physician taking the wrong cup. But I think that as long as the act that caused death was part of the conspiracy's objectives, the brothers can be held liable.

Alternatively, maybe the brothers are guilty of attempted murder of the uncle and murder of the physician. But wait, the uncle didn't die, so it's attempted murder, but the physician did die, so murder.

Wait, but the brothers didn't actually attempt to kill the uncle themselves; the housekeeper did. So the brothers' liability is through conspiracy and possibly aiding and abetting.

But the question is about the brothers' crimes, so let's go back.

They solicited the housekeeper to commit murder (solicitation), which is a crime. Then, they conspired with her to commit the uncle's murder. That's conspiracy. Now, when the housekeeper acted and the physician died, the brothers might be liable for that murder as part of the conspiracy.

So, the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit the uncle's murder and, because the physician died as a result of the conspiracy's execution, they're also guilty of the physician's murder.

But wait, the options don't all include both murders. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and attempted murder of physician.

But the physician died, so attempted murder wouldn't apply. So A is out.

Option B: Murder of both uncle and physician. But the uncle didn't die, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and murder of physician. That seems possible.

Option D: Solicitation, conspiracy, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician. Involuntary manslaughter is when someone dies due to recklessness or criminal negligence, not necessarily intent. But here, the intent was to kill the uncle, but the physician's death was a direct result, so it's more likely murder than manslaughter.

Option E: Conspiracy to commit murder of both uncle and physician. No, because the plan was only to kill the uncle, not the physician.

Option F: Conspiracy to commit uncle's murder and murder of the housekeeper. No, the housekeeper isn't dead.

Option G: Conspiracy and attempted murder of physician. Again, physician died, so attempted doesn't fit.

Option H: Solicitation, conspiracy, and murder of physician. So that's possible.

Option I: Only conspiracy to commit uncle's murder. But the physician's death might add another charge.

Option J: Conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter of physician.

So, considering all, the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit the uncle's murder and murder of the physician. So option C or H.

Wait, option C says Conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and murder of physician. Option H includes Solicitation as well.

The brothers approached the housekeeper and asked her to poison their uncle. That's solicitation to commit murder. So they're guilty of solicitation, conspiracy, and murder of the physician.

Wait, so the correct answer would include all three: solicitation, conspiracy, and murder of the physician. So looking at the options, option H is "Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician."

But wait, another thought: in some jurisdictions, solicitation merges into conspiracy when the conspiracy is formed. So maybe they wouldn't be charged with both. But I think for the purposes of this question, both are separate charges.

Alternatively, maybe the brothers are guilty of conspiracy and murder, but not necessarily solicitation as a separate charge. But the question lists the options, and some include solicitation.

Wait, the initial act was the brothers asking the housekeeper to kill their uncle. That's solicitation. Then, when the housekeeper agrees, they form a conspiracy. So both solicitation and conspiracy are applicable.

So the brothers are guilty of solicitation (for asking the housekeeper), conspiracy to commit the uncle's murder, and because the physician died as a result of the conspiracy's actions, they're guilty of the physician's murder.

So looking at the options, option H includes Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and murder of physician. So H would be the correct answer.

But wait, another point: the brothers didn't actually kill the physician. The housekeeper did. So under the law of conspiracy, each conspirator is liable for the crimes committed by other conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy. So the brothers can be held liable for the murder of the physician because the housekeeper was acting in furtherance of the conspiracy when she placed the poison, which led to the physician's death.

Therefore, option H is correct.

The question involves two brothers who solicited their uncle's housekeeper to poison their uncle, agreeing to pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. The housekeeper agreed and placed cyanide in the uncle's tea. However, the physician, who was visiting the uncle, accidentally drank the poisoned tea and died. The issue is determining the crimes for which the brothers are guilty.

1. **Solicitation**: The brothers asked the housekeeper to commit murder, which constitutes solicitation to commit a felony (murder).

2. **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**: When the housekeeper agreed to the plan, a conspiracy was formed. The brothers and the housekeeper agreed to kill the uncle, and steps were taken to carry out the plan (e.g., placing cyanide in the tea). Thus, the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit the uncle's murder.

3. **Murder of the Physician**: Although the brothers intended to kill their uncle, the physician's death was a direct result of the conspiracy's execution. Under the felony murder rule, all conspirators are liable for deaths that occur during the commission of the agreed-upon felony, even if the victim was unintended. Therefore, the brothers are guilty of the physician's murder.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect because the physician died, so "attempted murder" does not apply.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the uncle did not die.
- **Option C**: Correct in part but does not include solicitation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because the physician's death constitutes murder, not involuntary manslaughter.
- **Option E**: Incorrect because the conspiracy was only to kill the uncle, not the physician.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because the housekeeper is not a victim.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because the physician died, so "attempted murder" does not apply.
- **Option H**: Correct. It includes solicitation, conspiracy to commit the uncle's murder, and murder of the physician.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because it does not account for the physician's death.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because the physician's death constitutes murder, not involuntary manslaughter.

The correct answer is **Option H**, as it accurately reflects the brothers' liability for solicitation, conspiracy to commit the uncle's murder, and the physician's murder. 

H
