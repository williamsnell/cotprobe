Question:

Paper pulp (almost 100 % cellulose) is prepared commercially by digesting wood chips in a hot aqueous solution of calciumbisulfite, Ca(HSO_3)_2. The latter dissolves lignin and resins in the wood, leaving nearly pure cellulose. The sulfite solution is prepared by the following reactions: S + O_2\ding{217} SO_2 SO_2 + H_2O\ding{217} H_2SO_3 CaCO_3 + 2H_2SO_3\ding{217}Ca(HSO_3)_2 + CO_2 + H_2O (a) For every 250 kg of limestone (CaCO_3) used in the process , what weight of sulfur would be required? (b) What weight of Ca(HSO_3)_2 is produced from the limestone and sulfur in part (a)?

Options:

A: 220 kg of sulfur, 350 kg of Ca(HSO_3)_2
B: 180 kg of sulfur, 450 kg of Ca(HSO_3)_2
C: 200 kg of sulfur, 400 kg of Ca(HSO_3)_2
D: 170 kg of sulfur, 520 kg of Ca(HSO_3)_2
E: 100 kg of sulfur, 300 kg of Ca(HSO_3)_2
F: 160 kg of sulfur, 505 kg of Ca(HSO_3)_2

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the production of paper pulp using calcium bisulfite, Ca(HSO3)2. The process involves some reactions, and I need to find out how much sulfur is required and how much Ca(HSO3)2 is produced based on the given amounts of limestone (CaCO3).

Alright, let's break it down. The problem has two parts: part (a) asks for the weight of sulfur needed for every 250 kg of limestone used, and part (b) asks for the weight of Ca(HSO3)2 produced from that. The answer options are given from A to J, each with different values for (a) and (b), so I need to calculate both.

The reactions provided are:
1. S + O2 → SO2
2. SO2 + H2O → H2SO3
3. CaCO3 + 2 H2SO3 → Ca(HSO3)2 + CO2 + H2O

Hmm, okay. So it looks like the first two reactions produce H2SO3, which then reacts with CaCO3 to form Ca(HSO3)2. So I think I need to calculate the stoichiometry here, starting from the CaCO3 and working backwards to find how much S is needed.

Let's tackle part (a) first. For every 250 kg of CaCO3, how much S is needed?

I think I should write the balanced equations and then compute the molar ratios.

Let me start by writing down the molar masses of the substances involved because I'll need them to convert between mass and moles.

Molar masses:
- CaCO3: 40 (Ca) + 12 (C) + 16*3 (O) = 100 g/mol
- S: 32 g/mol
- H2SO3: 2*(1) + 32 + 16*3 = 98 g/mol
- Ca(HSO3)2: 40 + 2*(1 + 32 + 3*16) = 40 + 2*(1+32+48) = 40 + 2*81 = 40 + 162 = 202 g/mol

Wait, let me double-check that Ca(HSO3)2 calculation. Each HSO3^- ion: H is 1, S is 32, O3 is 48. So HSO3 is 81 g/mol. Two of them would be 162, plus Ca (40), so 202 g/mol. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the third reaction is:
CaCO3 + 2 H2SO3 → Ca(HSO3)2 + CO2 + H2O

So for every 1 mole of CaCO3, 2 moles of H2SO3 are needed.

But the H2SO3 comes from the second reaction: SO2 + H2O → H2SO3. So each mole of SO2 gives one mole of H2SO3.

And the SO2 comes from the first reaction: S + O2 → SO2. Each mole of S gives one mole of SO2.

Putting it all together, the overall process for each mole is:
1 S → 1 SO2 → 1 H2SO3 → which is used in the third reaction.

Wait, but in the third reaction, each CaCO3 uses 2 H2SO3. So for each mole of CaCO3, we need 2 moles of H2SO3. Which means 2 moles of SO2, which comes from 2 moles of S.

Wait, let me make it clearer. Let me track the moles:

Looking at the third reaction: 1 CaCO3 requires 2 H2SO3.

Each H2SO3 comes from 1 SO2 (from reaction 2), and each SO2 comes from 1 S (from reaction 1).

So for each H2SO3, you need 1 S. Therefore, 2 H2SO3 would require 2 S.

So per CaCO3, 2 S are needed.

Wait, but wait, let me think in terms of moles to be precise.

Let me write this as a stoichiometric chain.

The overall reaction can be thought of as:

S → SO2 → H2SO3 → reacting with CaCO3.

So per mole of CaCO3, we need 2 moles of H2SO3. Each mole of H2SO3 requires 1 mole of SO2, which requires 1 mole of S.

So 2 moles of H2SO3 → 2 moles SO2 → 2 moles S.

Thus, 1 mole of CaCO3 requires 2 moles of S.

Now, I have 250 kg of CaCO3. Let's convert that to moles.

Molar mass of CaCO3 is 100 g/mol, so 250 kg is 250,000 g.

Moles of CaCO3 = 250,000 g / 100 g/mol = 2500 moles.

Each mole of CaCO3 requires 2 moles of S, so total moles of S needed = 2500 * 2 = 5000 moles.

Now, the molar mass of S is 32 g/mol. So mass of S needed is 5000 * 32 = 160,000 g, which is 160 kg.

Wait, that's 160 kg of S. Let me see the options. Looking at the options for part (a), option F is 160 kg S, part (a) is 160. So part (a)'s answer would be 160 kg of S.

Now, moving to part (b): How much Ca(HSO3)2 is produced from 250 kg CaCO3 and the corresponding S?

From reaction 3, 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of Ca(HSO3)2.

So moles of CaCO3 = 2500 moles → moles of Ca(HSO3)2 = 2500 moles.

Molar mass of Ca(HSO3)2 is 202 g/mol as calculated earlier.

So mass = 2500 * 202 = let's compute that.

2500 * 200 = 500,000
2500 * 2 = 5,000
Total = 505,000 g → 505 kg.

So part (b) is 505 kg of Ca(HSO3)2.

Looking back at the options, option F is (a) 160 kg S and (b) 505 kg Ca(HSO3)2. So the correct answer would be option F.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.

Another approach: Let me write the entire process as a combined reaction.

From the three reactions:

1. S + O2 → SO2
2. SO2 + H2O → H2SO3
3. CaCO3 + 2 H2SO3 → Ca(HSO3)2 + CO2 + H2O

If I combine them, considering that each H2SO3 comes from SO2, which comes from S.

So combining reaction 1 and 2, we get S + O2 + H2O → H2SO3 (but I'm not sure if that's necessary, but perhaps it's easier to combine everything into one reaction).

Alternatively, sum all the reactions:

Reaction 1: S + O2 → SO2
Reaction 2: SO2 + H2O → H2SO3
Reaction 3: CaCO3 + 2 H2SO3 → Ca(HSO3)2 + CO2 + H2O

So for each CaCO3, I need 2 H2SO3, which requires 2 SO2, which requires 2 S.

So per CaCO3: 2 S consumed.

So 250 kg CaCO3 is 2500 moles, so 2 * 2500 = 5000 moles of S.

5000 moles * 32 g/mol = 160 kg S.

Then, CaCO3 → Ca(HSO3)2 in 1:1 molar ratio, so 2500 moles → 2500 * 202 = 505 kg.

So yes, that's correct. So the answer is F: 160 kg S, 505 kg Ca(HSO3)2.

To solve the problem, we analyze the reactions and calculate the required masses using stoichiometry.

### Part (a): Weight of Sulfur (S) Required
1. **Reaction 3**:  
   \[
   \text{CaCO}_3 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{SO}_3 \rightarrow \text{Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2 + \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
   \]  
   For every 1 mole of \(\text{CaCO}_3\), 2 moles of \(\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3\) are required.

2. **Reaction 2**:  
   \[
   \text{SO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{SO}_3
   \]  
   Each mole of \(\text{H}_2\text{SO}_3\) requires 1 mole of \(\text{SO}_2\).

3. **Reaction 1**:  
   \[
   \text{S} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{SO}_2
   \]  
   Each mole of \(\text{SO}_2\) requires 1 mole of \(\text{S}\).

Thus, for every 1 mole of \(\text{CaCO}_3\), 2 moles of \(\text{S}\) are required.

4. **Moles of \(\text{CaCO}_3\)**:  
   Given 250 kg of \(\text{CaCO}_3\), its molar mass is \(100 \, \text{g/mol}\):  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CaCO}_3 = \frac{250,000 \, \text{g}}{100 \, \text{g/mol}} = 2500 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

5. **Moles of \(\text{S}\)**:  
   Since 1 mole of \(\text{CaCO}_3\) requires 2 moles of \(\text{S}\):  
   \[
   \text{Moles of S} = 2500 \times 2 = 5000 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

6. **Mass of \(\text{S}\)**:  
   The molar mass of \(\text{S}\) is \(32 \, \text{g/mol}\):  
   \[
   \text{Mass of S} = 5000 \times 32 = 160,000 \, \text{g} = 160 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

### Part (b): Weight of \(\text{Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2\) Produced
1. **Reaction 3**:  
   For every 1 mole of \(\text{CaCO}_3\), 1 mole of \(\text{Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2\) is produced.

2. **Moles of \(\text{Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2\)**:  
   Since 2500 moles of \(\text{CaCO}_3\) are used:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2 = 2500 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Mass of \(\text{Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2\)**:  
   The molar mass of \(\text{Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2\) is \(202 \, \text{g/mol}\):  
   \[
   \text{Mass of Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2 = 2500 \times 202 = 505,000 \, \text{g} = 505 \, \text{kg}.
   \]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:  
- Part (a): \(160 \, \text{kg}\) of sulfur is required.  
- Part (b): \(505 \, \text{kg}\) of \(\text{Ca(HSO}_3\text{)}_2\) is produced.  

The correct option is **F**.
