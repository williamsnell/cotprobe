Question:

Explain the method of copulation in the earthworms.

Options:

A: Earthworms reproduce asexually by fission.
B: Earthworms engage in internal fertilization where one worm injects sperm directly into the ovaries of the other.
C: Each earthworm fertilizes its own eggs internally without the need for a mate.
D: Earthworms attract mates through airborne pheromones and mate on the surface without physical contact.
E: Earthworms reproduce by budding, where small worms grow out of the parent's body.
F: Earthworms exchange sperm by connecting their posterior ends and then separate to lay fertilized eggs.
G: Earthworms reproduce by external fertilization in water.
H: Earthworms lay eggs without any copulation.
I: Two earthworms unite ventral surface to ventral surface with opposite anterior ends. They discharge sperm into the other's seminal receptacles. After separation, a cocoon is secreted for egg and sperm deposition.
J: Two earthworms connect at their anterior ends and exchange sperm through their mouths before separating to lay eggs independently.

Okay, so I have this biology question about earthworms' copulation method. Hmm, I'm not too sure, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that earthworms are annelids, right? And they're hermaphroditic, meaning each worm has both male and female reproductive organs. But since they're hermaphroditic, they still need to mate with another worm to exchange sperm.

Wait, so how do they actually do it? I think they mate by aligning their bodies. Oh right, they probably attach to each other in some way. I remember something about them connecting their ventral surfaces. Ventrals are the belly sides, so maybe they press those together.

Oh, and when they mate, they exchange sperm. Each worm has seminal receptacles where they store the sperm from the other. So each worm acts as a male and female during mating. After they separate, each one will use the stored sperm to fertilize their eggs.

So looking at the options, let's see. Option A says asexual reproduction by fission. No, earthworms don't do that; fission is more like some flatworms or other invertebrates. Option B says internal fertilization by injection. I don't think earthworms inject sperm directly; I believe it's an exchange during mating.

Option C suggests each worm fertilizes its own eggs without a mate. That can't be right because they are hermaphroditic but still need cross-fertilization. Option D talks about pheromones and mating without contact. I don't think so; they probably have physical contact since they exchange sperm.

Option E is about budding, which I don't think applies here. Option F says they connect posterior ends and exchange sperm. Wait, posterior is the tail end. Do they connect tails? I thought they align anterior to posterior, like head to tail but opposite directions.

Option G is external fertilization in water. Earthworms are terrestrial, so they don't need water for fertilization. Option H says they lay eggs without copulation, which isn't correct because they do mate.

Option I: Two worms unite ventral to ventral with opposite anterior ends. They discharge sperm into each other's seminal receptacles. After separating, they secrete a cocoon for eggs and sperm. That sounds right because they align opposite ends, exchange sperm, and then each produces a cocoon where fertilization happens.

Option J says they connect anterior ends and exchange through mouths. No, I don't think they use their mouths. It's more about the ventral surface contact.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The correct answer is I.

Earthworms are hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs, but they still require mating to exchange sperm. During copulation, two earthworms align their bodies ventral surface to ventral surface, with their anterior ends pointing in opposite directions. They discharge sperm into each other's seminal receptacles. After separating, each worm secretes a cocoon where eggs are deposited and fertilized using the stored sperm. This process ensures successful reproduction.

Answer: I
