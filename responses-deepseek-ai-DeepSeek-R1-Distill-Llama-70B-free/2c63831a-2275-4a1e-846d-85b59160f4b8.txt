Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about Justin who needed to overcome his fear of flying. His therapist taught him relaxation exercises, and he practiced these while gradually exposing himself to things related to flying. First, he looked at pictures of airplanes, then watched them take off at the airport, then went into an empty plane that wouldn't take off, and finally took a short flight. The question is asking which treatment he underwent.

The options are A through J, each representing a different type of psychological therapy. I need to figure out which one matches the scenario described.

I remember that there are several types of therapies. Let me think about each one. 

Option A: Psychoanalysis. That's Freudian, right? It involves things like free association, dream analysis, and exploring the unconscious mind. I don't think that's what's happening here. The scenario doesn't mention anything about unconscious thoughts or past experiences in that way.

Option B: Behavior Therapy. This focuses on changing maladaptive behaviors through various techniques. I recall that behavior therapy often uses methods like systematic desensitization. Systematic desensitization is a technique where a person is gradually exposed to the feared object or situation, starting from something not too scary and moving up to more intense exposures. They do this while using relaxation techniques to stay calm. That sounds exactly like what Justin is doing. He's starting with pictures, then moving to real planes, then being in a plane, and finally flying. And he's practicing relaxation exercises each time. So this seems like a good match.

Option C: Cognitive Therapy. This focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns. The therapist might help the person challenge their irrational beliefs. While cognitive approaches can be part of treatments, the scenario here doesn't mention anything about changing thoughts or beliefs, just using relaxation and gradual exposure. So maybe it's not C.

Option D: Humanistic Therapy. This approach emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and the client's inherent value. Therapists like Carl Rogers developed this. The scenario doesn't talk about self-actualization or the therapeutic relationship in that way, so probably not D.

Option E: Existential Therapy. This focuses on the meaning of life, freedom, and responsibility. It helps clients find meaning and purpose. Again, the scenario doesn't align with this approach.

Option F: Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT). This is similar to cognitive therapy but focuses on identifying and disputing irrational beliefs. It's more about the thought processes leading to emotions. The scenario doesn't mention challenging thoughts, so F might not be the right choice.

Option G: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). This combines cognitive-behavioral techniques with mindfulness practices. It's often used for things like depression. While it includes relaxation, the systematic desensitization part points more directly to behavior therapy than MBCT.

Option H: Group Therapy. This involves therapy sessions with multiple clients. The scenario doesn't mention a group setting, so H is unlikely.

Option I: Gestalt Therapy. Focuses on the present moment and awareness of emotions and experiences. Techniques include role-playing and empty chair exercises. Doesn't fit the scenario here.

Option J: Reality Therapy. Focuses on problem-solving and taking responsibility for choices. It's more about setting goals and actions. Doesn't seem to match the gradual exposure method.

Putting it all together, the key elements here are gradual exposure and relaxation techniques. That's classic systematic desensitization, which falls under Behavior Therapy. So the answer should be B: Behavior Therapy.

The scenario describes Justin undergoing a treatment that involves gradual exposure to the feared stimulus (flying) alongside relaxation exercises. This method is characteristic of systematic desensitization, a technique commonly used in behavior therapy to reduce anxiety by progressively exposing the individual to the feared situation while teaching relaxation to manage anxiety. Other options, such as cognitive therapy, humanistic therapy, or existential therapy, do not align with the described approach. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: behavior therapy

Answer: B
