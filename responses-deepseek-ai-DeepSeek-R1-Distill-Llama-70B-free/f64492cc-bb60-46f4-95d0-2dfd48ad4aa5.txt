Question:

The financial aid office at a state university conducts a study to determine the total student costs per semester. All students are charged $4500 for tuition. The mean cost for books is $350 with a standard deviation of $65. The mean outlay for room and board is $2800 with a standard deviation of $380. The mean personal expenditure is $675 with a standard deviation of $125. Assuming independence among categories, what is the standard deviation of the total student costs?

Options:

A: $700
B: $24
C: $405
D: $190
E: $510
F: $570
G: $320
H: $91
I: $800
J: $635

Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the standard deviation of total student costs per semester. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I know that the total cost is the sum of four components: tuition, books, room and board, and personal expenditure. But wait, the problem says that the tuition is a fixed charge of $4500. Fixed, right? So that means the standard deviation for tuition is zero because there's no variation. Everyone pays exactly $4500, so no spread there.

Now, the other three categories are books, room and board, and personal expenditure. Each of these has a mean and a standard deviation provided. The question is about the standard deviation of the total cost. I remember that when variables are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances. Oh right, because variance adds when variables are independent. So I should calculate the variance for each of these three, sum them up, and then take the square root to get the standard deviation of the total.

Let me jot down the numbers:

- Books: mean $350, std dev $65. So variance is 65 squared, which is 4225.
- Room and Board: mean $2800, std dev $380. Variance is 380 squared. Let me compute that... 380 * 380. Hmm, 38^2 is 1444, so 380^2 is 144400.
- Personal Expenditure: mean $675, std dev $125. Variance is 125 squared, which is 15625.

Wait, wait. Tuition's variance is zero, so I can ignore it in the sum. So the total variance is the sum of the variances of books, room/board, and personal.

So adding them up: 4225 (books) + 144400 (room) + 15625 (personal). Let's compute that.

First, 4225 + 144400 is 148625. Then add 15625: 148625 + 15625 = 164250. So the total variance is 164250.

But wait, variance is in squared dollars, so to get the standard deviation, I take the square root of 164250. Let me compute that. Hmm, square root of 164250. Let me think about what's a good approximation.

I know that 400 squared is 160,000. So 405 squared is (400+5)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*5 +5^2 = 160000 +4000 +25= 164025. Oh wait, that's very close to 164250. So 405^2 is 164025. So the square root of 164250 is a bit more than 405. Let me calculate the exact value.

405^2 = 164025. The difference is 164250 - 164025 = 225. Oh, so 405 + (225)/(2*405) approximately, using linear approximation. So 225/(810) is about 0.277. So approximately 405.28. But looking at the options, maybe it's rounded to the nearest dollar?

Wait, let me check the options. The options are in dollars, and I'm looking for the standard deviation. Let's see the options again.

Option F is $570. Option E is $510. Option G is $320. Option A is $700. Hmm, none of these are around 405. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a second, maybe I messed up adding the variances. Let me recheck.

Books' variance: 65^2 = 4225.

Room: 380^2 is (300+80)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*80 +80^2 =90000 +48000 +6400= 144400.

Personal: 125^2 = 15625.

Sum: 4225 + 144400 = 148625. Then 148625 +15625 = 164250. That looks correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 405. Did I miss a component? Oh wait, I forgot that the tuition is fixed. So its variance is zero, so it doesn't contribute. So the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the initial problem statement. Does it say that the standard deviations are given, and to assume independence? Yes. So the approach is correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have 405. Let me look again. The options given are A-J.

Looking at the options:

A: $700

B: $24

C: $405

Oh wait, option C is $405. But wait, why is the option C's number $405? Because the square root is approximately 405.28, so 405 is the closest. Oh, so option C is correct.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me recheck the variances.

Books: 65^2 = 4225.

Room: 380^2=144400.

Personal:125^2=15625.

Total variance: 4225 + 144400 = 148625; plus 15625 gives 164250.

Square root of 164250 is sqrt(164250). Let me compute it more accurately.

405^2 is 164025.

So 164250-164025=225.

So the square root is 405 + 225/(2*405) =405 + 225/810=405 + 0.2777â‰ˆ405.28.

So approximately 405.28, which rounds to 405. So the standard deviation is $405. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but looking back, the options have some other numbers. Let me make sure the question didn't say something else. Oh, the question is about total student costs. So the total is tuition + books + room + personal. Tuition is fixed, so variance is zero. The other three components contribute their variances, which we summed correctly.

So yes, the correct answer is option C: $405.
</think>

To determine the standard deviation of the total student costs per semester, we start by noting that the total cost is the sum of four components: tuition, books, room and board, and personal expenditure. Tuition is a fixed cost of $4500, so its variance is $0. For the remaining three components, we calculate the variances and sum them, assuming independence.

### Step 1: Calculate variances
- **Books**: Mean = $350, Standard Deviation = $65  
  Variance = \( 65^2 = 4225 \)
- **Room and Board**: Mean = $2800, Standard Deviation = $380  
  Variance = \( 380^2 = 144400 \)
- **Personal Expenditure**: Mean = $675, Standard Deviation = $125  
  Variance = \( 125^2 = 15625 \)

### Step 2: Sum the variances
The total variance is the sum of the variances of books, room and board, and personal expenditure:  
\[
\text{Total Variance} = 4225 + 144400 + 15625 = 164250
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the standard deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the total variance:  
\[
\text{Total Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{164250}
\]  
Approximating, \( \sqrt{164250} \approx 405.28 \), which rounds to $405.

### Final Answer
The standard deviation of the total student costs is **$405**, corresponding to option **C**.
