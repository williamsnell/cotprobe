Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about determining the molecular weight of a new compound using the freezing point depression method. Hmm, I remember that freezing point depression is a colligative property, which depends on the number of particles in solution. Right, the formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = i * Kf * m, where ΔTf is the change in freezing point, i is the van 't Hoff factor, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality.

Wait, so the chemist dissolved 2.00 grams of the unknown compound in 10 grams of water. The freezing point went down to -1.22°C. The normal freezing point of water is 0°C, so the change ΔTf is 1.22°C, but since it's a depression, I think it's the absolute value, so 1.22°C.

I need to find the molecular weight (M) of the compound. The formula I think involves molality (m), which is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So, m = n / kg solvent.

But wait, the solvent here is 10 grams, which is 0.010 kg. So m = (mass of solute / M) / kg of solvent. Rearranging that, M = (mass of solute) / (m * kg of solvent).

But wait, I need to find m first. Since ΔTf = i * Kf * m. I think for this problem, we can assume that the solute is a nonelectrolyte, so i would be 1. Or wait, the problem doesn't mention dissociation, so maybe I should just go with i=1.

What's the Kf for water? I remember Kf for water is 1.86°C·kg/mol. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. I think Kf is 1.86°C·kg/mol. Yeah, that's correct.

So putting it all together:

ΔTf = i * Kf * m

We have ΔTf = 1.22°C, i=1, Kf=1.86. So solving for m:

m = ΔTf / (i * Kf) = 1.22 / (1 * 1.86) ≈ 0.656 mol/kg.

Wait, 1.22 divided by 1.86. Let me compute that. 1.22 ÷ 1.86.

Hmm, 1.86 times 0.6 is 1.116. 0.656 is 0.6 + 0.056. Because 1.86 * 0.656 = 1.22?

Let me check: 1.86 * 0.6 = 1.116. 1.86 * 0.05 = 0.093. So 0.65 *1.86= 1.209. That's very close to 1.22. So m≈0.656 mol/kg.

Now, molality m is moles per kg of solvent. The solvent is 10 grams, which is 0.010 kg. So the moles of solute, n, is m * kg of solvent = 0.656 * 0.010 = 0.00656 moles.

But wait, the mass of the solute is 2.00 grams. So the molecular weight M is mass (g) / moles (mol). So M = 2.00 g / 0.00656 mol ≈ 304.8 g/mol. Hmm, that's approximately 305 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 305 g/mol. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I mix up mass and kg? Oh wait, m is in moles per kg. So 10 grams is 0.01 kg. So n = m * 0.01. That part is correct.

Yes, so n = 0.656 * 0.01 = 0.00656 mol. So M = 2.00 / 0.00656 ≈ 304.8, which is 305. So option C makes sense.

To determine the molecular weight of the new compound, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta T_f = 1.22^\circ \text{C}\) (freezing point depression),
- \(i = 1\) (assuming the compound does not dissociate in water),
- \(K_f = 1.86^\circ \text{C·kg/mol}\) (cryoscopic constant for water),
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution.

Rearranging for \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T_f}{i \cdot K_f} = \frac{1.22}{1 \cdot 1.86} \approx 0.656 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

Molality is defined as:

\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}}.
\]

The mass of the solvent is 10.0 g, or 0.010 kg. Let \(n\) represent the moles of solute:

\[
n = m \cdot \text{kilograms of solvent} = 0.656 \cdot 0.010 = 0.00656 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molecular weight (\(M\)) is given by:

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{moles of solute}} = \frac{2.00 \, \text{g}}{0.00656 \, \text{mol}} \approx 305 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Thus, the molecular weight of the compound is approximately **305 g/mol**, corresponding to option **C**.
