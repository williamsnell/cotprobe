Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about strings and their frequencies. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with strings under tension, the frequency of vibration depends on a few factors. Let me think... Oh right, it's related to the length of the string, the tension, and the mass per unit length. But wait, the problem says the tension is the same for both strings, so that simplifies things a bit.

The first string is 100 centimeters long and has a frequency of 200 vibrations per second. The second string is 50 centimeters, half the length, and I need to find its frequency. Since the tension is the same, maybe the formula I need is the one that relates frequency to the length of the string.

I recall the formula for the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string. It's given by f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where L is the length, T is the tension, and μ is the mass per unit length. Oh wait, but in this problem, the tension T is the same for both strings, and since they're similar, their mass per unit length μ should be the same too. So looking at the formula, the frequency f is inversely proportional to the length L. Because all other factors (T and μ) are the same, if L changes, f changes in the opposite way.

So, if the first string is 100 cm and the second is 50 cm, the length is halved. Because f is inversely proportional to L, halving the length should double the frequency. Let me check that again. If L becomes L/2, then f becomes 2f. So the original frequency is 200 vps, and the new one should be 400 vps.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Suppose I have two strings. String A is length L and has frequency f. String B is length L/2. Since f is proportional to 1/L, String B's frequency should be 2f. So yes, 200 times 2 is 400.

Looking at the options, option C is 400 vps. That should be the correct answer.

The frequency of a vibrating string under tension is inversely proportional to its length, as given by the formula \( f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}} \), where \( L \) is the length, \( T \) is the tension, and \( \mu \) is the mass per unit length. Since the tension \( T \) and the mass per unit length \( \mu \) remain constant for both strings, the frequency \( f \) is inversely proportional to the length \( L \).

The first string is 100 cm long and has a frequency of 200 vibrations per second (vps). The second string is 50 cm long, which is half the length of the first string. Because frequency is inversely proportional to length, halving the length doubles the frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the second string is \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \, \text{vps} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

C: 400vps
