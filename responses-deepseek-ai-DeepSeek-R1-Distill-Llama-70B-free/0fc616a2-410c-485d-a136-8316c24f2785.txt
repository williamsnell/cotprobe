Okay, so I've got this question here about how many diagonals are in a regular octagon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, an octagon has eight sides, right? So it's an eight-sided polygon. I remember that a diagonal is a line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. So, for any polygon, the number of diagonals depends on the number of vertices.

I think there's a formula for calculating the number of diagonals in a polygon. Wasn't it something like n(n - 3)/2? Let me see. Oh right, because each vertex can connect to n-3 other vertices (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices), and then you divide by 2 to avoid double-counting.

So, n is 8 for an octagon. Plugging that into the formula: 8*(8 - 3)/2. That simplifies to 8*5/2. Which is 40/2, so 20. So that would be 20 diagonals.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think about it: each vertex connects to 5 other vertices via diagonals (since it can't connect to itself or the two adjacent ones). So 8 vertices each have 5 diagonals, that's 8*5=40. But wait, that counts each diagonal twice because each diagonal connects two vertices. So I need to divide by 2, which gives me 20 again. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A is 20. So the answer should be A.

To determine the number of diagonals in a regular octagon, we use the formula for the number of diagonals in a polygon, which is:

\[
\text{Number of diagonals} = \frac{n(n - 3)}{2}
\]

Here, \(n = 8\) for an octagon. Plugging in the value:

\[
\frac{8(8 - 3)}{2} = \frac{8 \times 5}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Thus, the number of diagonals in a regular octagon is 20. The correct answer is:

A: 20
