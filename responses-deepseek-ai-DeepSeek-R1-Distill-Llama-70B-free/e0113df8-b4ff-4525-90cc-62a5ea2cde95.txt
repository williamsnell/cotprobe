Question:

Consider the following code segment, which uses the variables r, s, and t.

   DISPLAY (r)
   DISPLAY (s)

 What is displayed as a result of running the code segment?

Options:

A: 3 3
B: 3 2
C: 2 1
D: 2 3
E: 1 2
F: 1 1

Okay, let's see. I have this code segment with variables r, s, and t. I need to figure out what values are displayed after running the code. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, the initial assignments are r ← 1, s ← 2, t ← 3. So, r is 1, s is 2, and t is 3. Got that.

Then, the next line is r ← s. Oh wait, right, that means r gets the value of s. Since s is 2, r becomes 2 now. So after this line, r is 2.

Next, s ← t. Since t is 3, s will be set to 3. So s changes from 2 to 3 here.

Now, the code displays r and then s. So first, it displays r which is 2. Then it displays s which is 3. So the output should be 2 and 3, in that order.

Looking at the options, option D is 2 3. So that should be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up anything. The assignments happen in order: r gets s's value, then s gets t's. So yeah, the final values are r=2 and s=3. So the displays should be 2 and 3.

The code begins with initial assignments: r=1, s=2, and t=3. It then updates r to the value of s (r=2) and s to the value of t (s=3). Finally, it displays r=2 and s=3.

Answer: D
