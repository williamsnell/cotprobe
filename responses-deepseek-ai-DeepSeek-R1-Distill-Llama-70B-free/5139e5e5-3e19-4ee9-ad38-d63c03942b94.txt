Okay, so I've got this problem here about Pauline Key's earnings, and I need to figure out her gross pay for the week. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, she earns $3.50 per hour. The pay structure is a bit different for different hours. So, for all hours worked over 40 in a week, she gets time and a half. And for Sunday work, she gets double her regular rate. 

Last week, she worked 48 hours during the regular week and 4 and a half hours on Sunday. I need to calculate her total gross earnings.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I think I should separate her hours into the regular hours, the overtime hours during the week, and the Sunday hours.

So, during the regular week, she worked 48 hours. The standard is 40 hours, right? So, 40 hours are regular, and anything over is overtime. That means 8 hours of overtime (48-40=8).

For the regular hours, she gets paid her normal rate. So 40 hours * $3.50 per hour.

Then, the overtime hours are 8. Time and a half means she gets 1.5 times her regular rate. So 8 hours * (3.50 * 1.5).

And then there's the Sunday work. She worked 4.5 hours there. But wait, the problem says she's paid double the regular rate for Sunday. So that's 4.5 hours * (3.50 * 2).

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, regular pay: 40 * 3.50. Let's see, 40 times 3 is 120, and 40 times 0.50 is 20. So 120+20=140. So $140 for regular hours.

Next, the overtime. 8 hours, time and a half. Her rate is 3.50, so 3.50 * 1.5 = 5.25. So 8 * 5.25. Let's calculate that. 8 *5 is 40, and 8 *0.25 is 2. So 40+2=42. So $42 for overtime.

Then the Sunday pay. 4.5 hours at double rate. Double of 3.50 is 7.00. So 4.5 *7. Let me compute that. 4 *7 is 28, 0.5 *7 is 3.5. So 28+3.5=31.5. So $31.5 for Sunday.

Now, adding all three parts together: 140 +42 +31.5. Let's add them step by step. 140 +42=182. Then 182 +31.5=213.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Regular: 40 *3.5=140, correct.

Overtime: 8 * (3.5 *1.5)=8*5.25=42, correct.

Sunday: 4.5 * (3.5*2)=4.5*7=31.5, correct.

Total: 140+42=182, plus 31.5 is 213.5.

Looking at the options, F is $213.50. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait, did I consider all the possibilities? Let me make sure I didn't mix up the rates.

Yes, Sunday is double, so 7 per hour. Overtime is 1.5 times, so 5.25 per hour. Regular is 3.5.

Yes, that's correct. And she worked 48 regular hours, which are split into 40 regular and 8 overtime. Sunday is separate.

So, yes, the total is 213.50, which is option F.

Pauline Key's gross earnings for the week are calculated as follows:

1. **Regular Hours (40 hours):**  
   \( 40 \, \text{hours} \times \$3.50/\text{hour} = \$140.00 \)

2. **Overtime Hours (8 hours):**  
   Overtime rate = \( 1.5 \times \$3.50 = \$5.25/\text{hour} \)  
   \( 8 \, \text{hours} \times \$5.25/\text{hour} = \$42.00 \)

3. **Sunday Hours (4.5 hours):**  
   Sunday rate = \( 2 \times \$3.50 = \$7.00/\text{hour} \)  
   \( 4.5 \, \text{hours} \times \$7.00/\text{hour} = \$31.50 \)

**Total Gross Earnings:**  
\( \$140.00 + \$42.00 + \$31.50 = \$213.50 \)

The correct answer is **F: $213.50**.
