Question:

A man mailed a letter to a woman promising to sell her his motorcycle for $1,000.

" The next day, the woman telephoned the man and said, "I changed my mind, I will pay $1,000 for the motorcycle. " The man refused to sell the woman his motorcycle. If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?

Options:

A: The man had the right to change his mind about the sale at any time.
B: The woman did not respond to the offer in a timely manner.
C: The man's refusal to accept $800 was not communicated in writing.
D: The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.
E: The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.
F: Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.
G: The initial letter from the man was not a formal offer to sell.
H: The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.
I: The woman's initial refusal to pay the full price voided the contract.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a man and a woman making a deal over a motorcycle. The man mailed a letter offering to sell his motorcycle for $1,000. Then the woman faxed back saying the price is a bit high and offered $800. The man faxed back saying he won't accept $800. The next day, the woman called and said she'd pay the full $1,000, but the man refused to sell. Now, she's suing for breach of contract. The question is about the man's best defense.

Hmm. So, I remember that in contract law, the key elements are offer, acceptance, and consideration. The first thing I need to determine is whether a contract was formed between them.

The man's letter was an offer. The woman responded with a counter-offer of $800. Wait, was that a counter-offer or just a negotiation? I think when someone responds to an offer with different terms, it's a counter-offer, which has the effect of rejecting the original offer. So, by offering $800, she's rejecting the $1,000 offer and making her own offer. 

Then the man responded by fax saying he won't accept $800. That would be a rejection of her counter-offer. So at that point, the original offer is off the table because the woman already rejected it with her counter-offer. So when she later calls and agrees to the original $1,000, is that still valid?

Wait, in contract law, once the offeree (the woman) makes a counter-offer, the original offer is no longer open for acceptance unless the offeror (the man) reaffirms it. Because the woman's counter-offer was a rejection, the original offer was terminated. So when she later tries to accept the original offer, it's too late because that offer was already rejected.

So looking at the options, the defenses are about why there's no contract. Let's go through the options.

Option A: The man had the right to change his mind. That's not quite right because once an offer is accepted, he can't really change his mind. But in this case, the woman didn't accept yet, so maybe the offer was revoked.

Option B: The woman didn't respond timely. I'm not sure about the time aspect here. The woman's counter-offer came after the man's offer, and the man rejected it. Then she accepted the next day. But the main issue is whether the offer was still open.

Option C: The man's refusal wasn't in writing. I don't think that matters because contract law doesn't require a specific mode unless it's under the statute of frauds, which I don't think applies here.

Option D: The woman's counter-offer terminated her power of acceptance. Wait, does a counter-offer terminate the original offer? I think yes. Because when the woman made a counter-offer, it was a rejection of the original offer. So the original offer is no longer on the table. So when she then tries to accept the original offer, she can't because it's already been rejected. So this might be a good option.

Option E: The man's rejection of her counter-offer terminated her power. Hmm, but the man's rejection would be of her counter-offer, which was her offer to him. So that doesn't necessarily terminate her power to accept the original offer, unless the original offer was already terminated.

Wait, I think the key point is that the woman's counter-offer (offering $800) was a rejection of the man's original offer. Once she does that, the original offer is no longer open. So when she later says she'll pay $1,000, that's an attempt to accept an offer that's already been rejected. So her power of acceptance ended when she rejected the offer with her counter-offer.

So option D says: The woman's counter-offer terminated her power of acceptance. That sounds right because she can't accept after she's already rejected the offer.

Option E says the man's rejection of her counter-offer terminated her power. But I think the termination happened when she made the counter-offer. So E is about the man's action, but the termination was by her action.

Option F: The woman's acceptance was oral, different mode. The original offer was in writing, but the acceptance was oral. Generally, unless the offer specifies otherwise, acceptance can be in any manner. So I don't think this is a valid defense.

Option G: The initial letter wasn't a formal offer. I think the letter was an offer; it's not about being formal, but whether it was an offer. So G is probably incorrect.

Option H: Contract unenforceable under statute of frauds because oral. But the statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, like sales of goods over $500. Here, the motorcycle is likely a good, so under UCC Article 2, contracts for goods over $500 need to be in writing. But here, the man's offer was in writing, so if the woman accepted in writing, it would be okay. But she tried to accept orally. Wait, but the statute of frauds requires the contract to be in writing. However, if the offer was in writing and the acceptance was oral, maybe there's an issue. But I'm not sure if that's the main point here. The main issue is whether a contract was formed, not whether it's enforceable under the statute of frauds. So maybe H is not the best defense.

Option I: The woman's initial refusal voided the contract. But the contract wasn't formed yet, so this doesn't apply.

So putting it all together, the man's best defense is that the woman's counter-offer terminated her power of acceptance. So the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether a contract was formed between the man and the woman. The man's letter offering to sell the motorcycle for $1,000 constituted an offer. The woman responded with a counter-offer of $800, which rejected the original offer and terminated its validity. When the man rejected her counter-offer, it further confirmed that the original offer was no longer on the table. The woman's subsequent attempt to accept the original offer by agreeing to pay $1,000 was too late, as the original offer had already been terminated by her counter-offer.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The man's right to change his mind is irrelevant because the issue is not about revocation but the termination of the original offer due to the woman's counter-offer.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The timeliness of the response is not the central issue; the key is that the original offer was terminated by the woman's counter-offer.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The man's refusal to accept $800 does not need to be in writing to be effective.
- **Option D**: Correct. The woman's counter-offer of $800 rejected the original offer and terminated her power of acceptance under the original terms.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the man rejected the woman's counter-offer, the termination of the original offer occurred when the woman made her counter-offer, not because of the man's rejection.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The mode of acceptance (oral vs. written) is not the issue here; the original offer was terminated by the woman's counter-offer.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The man's letter was an effective offer, so this is not a valid defense.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While the statute of frauds applies to contracts for the sale of goods over $500, the issue here is the termination of the original offer, not enforceability.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The woman's initial refusal did not void a contract because no contract had been formed yet.

The best defense is that the woman's counter-offer terminated her power of acceptance.
