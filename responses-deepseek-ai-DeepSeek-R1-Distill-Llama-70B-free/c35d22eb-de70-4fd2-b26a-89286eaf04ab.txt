Okay, so I've got this question about the classification of tissues in higher plants. Hmm, I remember from my biology classes that plant tissues can be a bit tricky to categorize. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the difficulties in classifying these tissues. The options are A through F, and I need to pick the right one. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A says the inability to observe cells. Wait, I don't think that's right. I mean, microscopes have been around for a while, so observing plant cells shouldn't be a big problem anymore. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B suggests homogeneity of cell structures in all tissues. That doesn't make sense. If all tissues had the same cell structures, they'd be easy to classify, right? But I remember that different tissues have different types of cells, like parenchyma, sclerenchyma, etc. So B is likely incorrect.

Option C claims identical functional roles for all tissue types. That can't be true because different tissues perform different functions. For example, xylem and phloem have distinct roles in transport. So C is probably wrong.

Option D mentions intergrade cells, variety of cell types, and unreliable maturity-based classification. Hmm, this rings a bell. I think plant tissues can sometimes have intermediate forms, making it hard to classify them distinctly. Also, the presence of various cell types within tissues adds complexity. Plus, if the classification is based on the maturity of the plant, that might not always be reliable because tissues can develop differently at various stages. So D seems like a strong candidate.

Option E says tissues are too robust to classify. I don't think that's the issue. Robustness might affect physical handling, but not the classification system itself. So E is probably not right.

Option F points to a lack of suitable technology. Again, with modern microscopy and other tools, this doesn't seem like a major problem. So F is likely incorrect.

Putting it all together, the main difficulties are the existence of intermediate cell types (intergrade cells), the variety of cell types within tissues, and the unreliability of using maturity as a basis for classification. So the correct answer should be D.

The classification of tissues in higher plants is challenging due to several factors. Microscopic observation of cells is not a significant issue, so option A is incorrect. Tissues are not homogeneous in their cell structures, as different tissues consist of specialized cells like parenchyma and sclerenchyma, making option B incorrect. Similarly, tissues do not have identical functional roles, as xylem and phloem, for example, serve distinct purposes, so option C is also incorrect. Option D correctly identifies the difficulties: the presence of intergrade cells (cells with intermediate characteristics), the variety of cell types within tissues, and the unreliability of classifying tissues based on maturity. Options E and F are incorrect because tissue robustness and lack of technology are not significant barriers to classification. 

Answer: D
