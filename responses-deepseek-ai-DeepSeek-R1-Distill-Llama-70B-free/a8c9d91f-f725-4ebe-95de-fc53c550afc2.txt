Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about which power can't stand alone to support federal law. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through it carefully.

The question is asking which of the listed powers can't support a federal law on its own. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the U.S. Constitution gives the federal government certain enumerated powers, and each of these can be the basis for federal laws. Some powers are broad, like the commerce power, taxing power, and the necessary and proper power.

I think about each option:

A: Defense power. That's related to national defense, so Congress can make laws for defense, like creating an army. That definitely supports federal laws.

B: Treaty power. Treaties are made by the President with Senate approval, but wait, does the treaty power itself allow Congress to pass laws? Or is it more about the President negotiating treaties? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think treaties can lead to laws, but maybe the treaty power isn't a standalone power for Congress to legislate.

C: Legislative power. That's a broad one. Congress has the authority to make laws, so this obviously supports federal laws.

D: Executive power. That's the President's power. But can the executive power alone support a law? Or does it require legislative action? I think the executive branch enforces laws, but Congress passes them, so maybe executive power isn't the basis for the law itself.

E: Judicial power. That's the courts' power to interpret laws, but again, not the power to create them. So I don't think judicial power can support a law on its own.

F: Commerce power. Yes, this is a big one. Congress can regulate interstate commerce, so laws based on this are definitely valid.

G: Spending power. Congress can spend for the general welfare, so this supports laws like appropriations.

H: Necessary and proper power. Also known as the elastic clause, it allows Congress to make laws necessary to carry out their powers. So this is a standalone basis.

I: Taxing power. Congress can levy taxes, so laws based on this are supported.

J: Police power. Wait, I remember that police power is primarily a state power. The states have the authority to regulate for health, safety, and welfare. The federal government doesn't have police power in the same way. So if a law is based solely on police power, the federal government can't do that; it's not one of their enumerated powers.

Wait, but let me make sure. The options are about which power cannot support a federal law. So looking back:

- Police power is a state power under the 10th Amendment. The feds can't exercise police power unless it's tied to another enumerated power. So a federal law can't be based solely on police power.

So the answer would be J: police power.

The question asks which power cannot stand alone to support a federal law. The federal government's powers are enumerated in the Constitution, and each listed option must be evaluated to determine if it can independently support federal legislation.

- **A: Defense power**: Congress can make laws for national defense, so this supports federal laws.  
- **B: Treaty power**: While treaties are negotiated by the President and approved by the Senate, this power doesn't independently allow Congress to enact laws.  
- **C: Legislative power**: This is the broad authority of Congress to make laws, so it supports federal laws.  
- **D: Executive power**: This pertains to the President's role in enforcing laws, not creating them, so it doesn't support laws on its own.  
- **E: Judicial power**: This is the courts' power to interpret laws, not create them, so it doesn't support laws independently.  
- **F: Commerce power**: Congress can regulate interstate commerce, so this supports federal laws.  
- **G: Spending power**: Congress can spend for the general welfare, supporting federal laws.  
- **H: Necessary and proper power**: This allows Congress to make laws to carry out its powers, so it supports federal laws.  
- **I: Taxing power**: Congress can levy taxes, so this supports federal laws.  
- **J: Police power**: This is primarily a state power under the 10th Amendment. The federal government cannot exercise police power unless tied to another enumerated power, so it cannot support a federal law on its own.

The correct answer is **J: police power**, as it is not an independent federal power and is reserved to the states. 

Answer: J
