Question:

A rancher was the owner of a parcel of land in fee simple. The rancher left the parcel in 1977 to move to the city. A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. Upon the rancher's death in 2010, his son, as his sole heir, brings an ejectment suit to recover possession of the property from the man. In his action, the son will most probably

Options:

A: lose, because the man's occupation of the property was continuous and hostile.
B: lose, because the man has been living on the property for more than 20 years.
C: lose, because the man's occupation of the land was uninterrupted.
D: win, because the man did not have a legitimate claim to the property.
E: win, because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year.
F: win, because the man did not have the rancher's permission to live on the property.
G: win, because the statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder- man until his interest becomes possessory.
H: lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.
I: win, because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.
J: win, because the man had abandoned the property for a year.

Alright, so I've got this question about adverse possession, and I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: A rancher owns a parcel of land in fee simple. He leaves in 1977. Then, a man takes possession in 1978 as an adverse possessor. He stays until 1988, then leaves for a year to care for his sick mother, comes back in 1990. So he was there from 78 to 88, left for a year, then back in 90 and stays until 2010. The rancher, during this time, in 1994, deeds the parcel to his son. The rancher dies in 2010, and the son sues to eject the man.

The question is about whether the son will win or lose, and why. The state's statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.

Hmm. So, adverse possession requires certain elements: the possession must be open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and for the statutory period. I think those are the main points.

Let's see. The man started in 1978. So from 78 to 88 is 10 years. Then he left for a year, 1988-1989, and came back in 1990. So from 1990 to 2010 is another 20 years. Wait, 1990 to 2010 is 20 years, but does that make the total period enough?

Wait, wait. Wait, the statutory period is 20 years. So, the man needs to have possessed the land openly, etc., for 20 continuous years. But here, he left for a year. So does that break continuity?

I remember that for adverse possession, the possession needs to be continuous and uninterrupted. If he left for a year, that might break the continuity. So, when he came back in 1990, would that restart the clock?

Alternatively, sometimes if the person returns after a temporary absence, it might not break the continuity. But I think it usually does. Like, if you leave for a year, that's a significant break, so the previous period doesn't count towards the 20 years.

So, the man was on the land from 78-88: 10 years. Then 1 year absence. Then from 90-2010: 20 years. Wait, 1990 to 2010 is 20 years. So, from 1990 onwards, he has 20 years. So, does that mean he meets the 20-year requirement?

But wait, the statutory period is 20 years. So, if he has 20 years of continuous possession, he can claim title. But in this case, he had a break. So, the period from 78-88 is 10 years, but then he left for a year, so that period can't be added to the later period. So, the later period from 1990-2010 is 20 years. Does that count?

But wait, the rancher conveyed the land to his son in 1994. So, the son became the owner then. Does that affect the adverse possession? Because adverse possession runs against the current owner. So, from 1994 onwards, the son is the owner. So, the man's possession from 1994 to 2010 is 16 years. But the statutory period is 20, so maybe that's not enough.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline the timeline.

- 1977: Rancher leaves.
- 1978: Man takes possession (adverse).
- 1978-1988: 10 years.
- 1988-1989: Man leaves for a year.
- 1990: Man returns.
- 1994: Rancher deeds to son.
- 2010: Rancher dies; son sues.

So, the man's possession is from 78-88 (10 yrs), then 90-2010 (20 yrs). But the break in 88-90 is a problem.

So, does the 1990-2010 period count as continuous? Because from 90-2010 is 20 years, which meets the statutory period. But wait, the son became the owner in 1994. So, the man's possession from 1994 to 2010 is 16 years against the son. That's less than 20, so maybe not enough.

Alternatively, does the adverse possession against the rancher before 1994 count towards the son? Because the son is the new owner. So, the man would have to have adverse possession against the son for 20 years, I think.

Wait, no. Adverse possession can run against the original owner, and once the time is up, the possessor gains title. But in this case, the rancher conveyed the property to the son in 1994. So, if the man had already acquired title by then, then the son's ownership would be irrelevant. But if not, then the man would have to continue possessing against the son.

Wait, but the man's possession from 78-88 is 10 years, then a break, then 90-2010. So, the total would be 10 + 20 = 30, but with a break. So, the continuous period is only 20 from 90-2010. But against whom?

From 90-94, the rancher was the owner. Then from 94-2010, the son was the owner. So, the man's possession against the son is only 16 years. But the statutory period is 20. So, he hasn't completed the 20 years against the son.

Wait, but the rancher conveyed the property to the son in 1994, so from 94 onwards, the son is the owner. So, the man's possession against the son is from 94 to 2010, which is 16 years. That's less than 20, so he can't claim adverse possession against the son.

But could the time before 1994 count towards the 20 years? Because the man was possessing against the rancher from 78-94, which is 16 years. But that's still less than 20. So, he didn't complete the 20 years against the rancher either.

Hmm, but wait, the man's total adverse possession against the rancher would be from 78-88 (10 years), then a break, then from 90-94 (4 years), totaling 14 years. Still less than 20.

So, the man hasn't completed the 20 years against either the rancher or the son. Therefore, he hasn't acquired title through adverse possession. So, when the son sues in 2010, the man can't claim adverse possession because he hasn't met the 20-year requirement.

But wait, another thought: The man left for a year, but does that break continuity? Suppose the man intended to return; does that make the absence temporary and not a break? I think the general rule is that temporary absences don't break continuity, but a prolonged absence might. A year might be considered a break.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, if the adverse possessor leaves the property, it's considered abandonment, and the possession is no longer continuous. So, the man leaving for a year would break the continuity, so the 10 years before don't count, and the 20 after would start from 1990. But from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years, which meets the statute. But does that mean he has acquired title?

Wait, but the son became the owner in 1994. So, the man's possession from 1990-1994 is against the rancher, and from 1994-2010 against the son. So, in total, from 1990-2010 is 20 years, but split between two owners. So, can he tack the time against the rancher and the son?

Wait, I think that once the ownership changes, the adverse possession has to be against the new owner. So, the time before the conveyance counts towards the rancher, but after the conveyance, it's against the son. So, the man's possession against the son is only 16 years, which is less than 20. So, he hasn't acquired title against the son.

Alternatively, if the man's possession was continuous from 1990-2010, regardless of the ownership change, maybe that 20-year period counts. But I'm not sure. Because the son is a different owner, so the man would have to have adverse possession against the son for 20 years. But he only had 16 years against the son.

Wait, but the rancher conveyed the land in 1994. So, prior to that, the man was possessing against the rancher. After that, against the son. So, the man can't combine the time before and after the conveyance to make up the 20 years, because they were against different owners.

So, even though the man was on the land for 20 years from 1990 to 2010, the ownership changed in 1994. So, he only has 16 years against the son.

That's less than the required 20. So, the son would win because the man hasn't completed the 20 years of adverse possession against him.

Wait, but another angle: The man started adverse possession against the rancher in 1978. He had 10 years, then a break, then from 1990-1994, another 4 years against the rancher. That's 14 years total against the rancher. But the statutory period is 20, so he didn't complete it before the rancher conveyed to the son.

So, the son's title is better than the man's claim, which hasn't matured yet. Therefore, the son can eject the man.

So, looking at the options, let me see:

Option E: win because the man left for a year.

Option G: win because the statutory period doesn't run against a remainderman until possessory.

Wait, the son was a remainderman? Or was it a current conveyance? The rancher conveyed to the son in 1994, so the son became the present owner, not a remainderman. So, G probably doesn't apply.

Option H: lose, because man acquired title. But I don't think so, because he didn't have 20 years against the son.

Option J: win because man abandoned for a year. So, the break in possession would mean he didn't have continuous possession for 20 years. So, the son wins because the man's possession was interrupted.

Alternatively, option E says the son wins because the man left for a year. That seems similar to J, but J is about abandonment, E is about leaving to care for mother.

Wait, the options are:

E: win, because the man left to take care of mother for a year.

J: win, because the man had abandoned the property for a year.

So, the key issue is whether the man's leaving for a year breaks the continuity. If it does, then the man didn't have continuous possession for 20 years, so he can't claim adverse possession.

In that case, the son would win because the man's possession was not continuous. So, the answer would be E or J.

Wait, but E is about the reason he left, while J is about abandonment. The fact that he left for a year would break continuity, making his possession not continuous. So, the son would win because the man didn't meet the 20-year continuous requirement.

So, the correct answer would be either E or J. But looking at the options, E says the son wins because the man left for a year. J says the son wins because the man abandoned for a year.

Wait, but the man didn't abandon; he came back after a year. So, it's more about interruption than abandonment. So, perhaps E is the reason, but J is the result.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E because the man's leaving for a year interrupted the continuity, so the son wins.

Wait, but another thought: the man had a total of 30 years of possession, but with a one-year break. So, from 78-88 (10), then 90-2010 (20). So, 30 years, but the break in the middle. So, the continuous period after the break is 20 years. So, maybe the man has acquired title by 2010, because from 1990-2010 is 20 years. But that's against the son for 16 of those years.

Wait, but the son became owner in 1994, so the man would need 20 years against the son. He only had 16, so that's not enough.

So, the man hasn't met the 20-year requirement against the current owner (the son). Therefore, the son can eject him.

So, the answer would be E: win because the man left for a year, breaking continuity.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is G: win because the statutory period doesn't run against a remainderman until his interest becomes possessory.

Wait, but the son was not a remainderman. The rancher owned the property in fee simple, and conveyed it to the son in 1994. So, the son became the present owner, not a remainderman. So, G doesn't apply here.

So, the best options are E or J.

Between E and J, which is correct? Because the man's possession was interrupted by a year, making it not continuous. So, the son wins because the man didn't have continuous possession for 20 years.

So, the correct answer is E: win because the man left to care for his mother for a year, interrupting the continuity.

Alternatively, J says win because he abandoned for a year. But abandonment implies giving up, which he didn't; he came back. So, E is more accurate.

Wait, but in adverse possession, any break in continuity restarts the clock. So, if he left for a year, the clock starts again from 1990. So, from 1990-2010 is 20 years. So, does that mean he has met the requirement?

Wait, that's a conflicting thought. If the man's possession from 1990-2010 is 20 years, and that's continuous, then he has met the 20-year requirement. But during that time, the ownership changed in 1994. So, the man would have to have 20 years against the current owner, the son. But he only had 16 years against the son.

So, perhaps the man hasn't completed the 20 years against the son. Thus, the son can eject him.

So, the answer would be E, because the man left for a year, interrupting the continuity, so he couldn't complete the 20 years against the son.

Wait, but from 1990-2010 is 20 years, but the son became owner in 1994. So, the man's possession against the son is 1994-2010, which is 16 years. Not enough. So, the son wins.

So, the reason is that the man's possession against the son wasn't 20 years. But the question is, which option states that?

Looking at the options:

Option E: win because the man left for a year.

Option G: win because the statutory period doesn't run against a remainderman until his interest becomes possessory.

But as discussed, G doesn't apply because the son wasn't a remainderman.

So, the answer is E or J.

Wait, option J says the son wins because the man abandoned for a year. But the man didn't abandon; he came back. So, J's reasoning is incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is E: the son wins because the man left for a year, breaking the continuity.

Wait, but another angle: The man's possession from 1990-2010 is 20 years, which meets the statutory period. But he was possessing against the son only from 1994-2010, which is 16 years. So, he hasn't met the 20-year requirement against the son. Therefore, the son can eject him.

So, the reason the son wins is that the man didn't have 20 years against him. But the options don't directly state that. The closest is E or J.

Alternatively, option G: if the son's interest was not possessory until the rancher's death, but that doesn't seem right. Because the son became the owner in 1994 when the rancher conveyed it to him. So, the son's interest was possessory from 1994 onwards.

So, the man needed 20 years against the son, but only had 16. Therefore, the son wins because the man didn't complete the adverse possession against him.

Looking back at the options, option G is about remaindermen, which doesn't apply here. So, the best option is E: the man left for a year, breaking continuity.

Wait, but if the man had a break, then his possession after 1990 would start the clock again. So, from 1990-2010 is 20 years, which would meet the requirement. But again, the son became the owner in 1994. So, the man's possession against the son is only 16 years, not 20.

So, the man can't claim against the son because he didn't have 20 years. Therefore, the son wins.

But the question is why. The reason is either because the man's possession was interrupted (E) or because the son's interest wasn't possessory until later (G, which doesn't apply here).

So, the correct answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the son of the rancher can eject the man who has been in possession of the property since 1978, given the statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. To succeed in adverse possession, the man must demonstrate that his possession was open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and uninterrupted for the statutory period.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Timeline of Possession**:
   - The man took possession in 1978 and stayed until 1988 (10 years).
   - He left for one year (1988-1989) to care for his sick mother.
   - He returned in 1990 and remained until 2010 (20 years).

2. **Continuity of Possession**:
   - The man's absence from 1988 to 1989 constitutes a significant break in continuity. This break means the period from 1978 to 1988 (10 years) cannot be combined with the period from 1990 to 2010 (20 years) to meet the 20-year requirement.
   - From 1990 to 2010, the man's possession appears continuous, but this period is split between two owners: the rancher (1990-1994) and the son (1994-2010).

3. **Ownership Change**:
   - The rancher conveyed the property to his son in 1994, making the son the new owner. Adverse possession must run against the current owner, so the man's possession from 1994 to 2010 (16 years) is insufficient to meet the 20-year requirement against the son.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option E
