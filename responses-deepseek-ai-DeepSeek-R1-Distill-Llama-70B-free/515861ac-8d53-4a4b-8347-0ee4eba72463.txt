Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the ratio of solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface at perihelion versus aphelion. Hmm, I remember that solar flux has something to do with the inverse square law. Let me think.

So, the question gives the distances in astronomical units (AU). Perihelion is when Mercury is closest to the Sun, right? So that's 0.304 AU, and aphelion is when it's farthest, at 0.456 AU. I need to find the ratio of the flux at these two points.

Wait, flux decreases with the square of the distance. Oh right, the inverse square law. So the flux is proportional to 1/r². So the ratio would be (F_peri)/(F_aphel) = (r_aphel / r_peri)². No, wait, because when the planet is closer, the flux is higher. So if F is proportional to 1/r², then the flux at perihelion is higher than at aphelion.

So F_peri is more than F_aphel. So the ratio F_peri / F_aphel would be (r_aphel / r_peri) squared, because when r increases, flux decreases.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me denote the perihelion distance as r1 = 0.304 AU, and aphelion as r2 = 0.456 AU. The Sun's flux at a distance r is given by F = L / (4πr²), where L is the solar luminosity. So F is inversely proportional to r squared. So F1 (at perihelion) = L/(4π r1²), and F2 (at aphelion) = L/(4π r2²).

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (r2/r1)². Because (L/(4π r1²)) / (L/(4π r2²)) )= (r2²)/(r1²) = (r2/r1)^2.

So calculating (r2 / r1) squared. Let me compute that.

r1 is 0.304 AU, r2 is 0.456 AU. So r2/r1 = 0.456 / 0.304. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 0.456 divided by 0.304.

Hmm, 0.456 ÷ 0.304. Let me compute. 304 goes into 456 once (because 304 *1=304), subtract to get 152. Bring down a zero (making it 1520). 304 goes into 1520 five times (5*304=1520). So 1.5. So 0.456/0.304 = 1.5.

Wait, wait, let me check. 0.304 * 1.5 = 0.456. Yes, that's correct. So r2/r1 is 1.5.

Then (r2/r1)^2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the ratio F1/F2 is 2.25. But the question asks for the ratio of the fluxes at perihelion to aphelion, which is F_peri/F_aphel = 2.25. So 2.25 is 9/4, because 9 divided by 4 is 2.25.

So looking at the options, option C is 9:4, which matches. So the answer should be C.

To calculate the ratio of the solar radiation flux on Mercury's surface at perihelion versus aphelion, we use the inverse square law. The flux \( F \) is proportional to \( 1/r^2 \), where \( r \) is the distance from the Sun. Let \( r_1 = 0.304 \, \text{AU} \) (perihelion) and \( r_2 = 0.456 \, \text{AU} \) (aphelion). The ratio of the fluxes is given by:

\[
\frac{F_{\text{peri}}}{F_{\text{apheli}}} = \left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^2
\]

First, compute \( \frac{r_2}{r_1} \):

\[
\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \frac{0.456}{0.304} = 1.5
\]

Now, square this value:

\[
\left(\frac{r_2}{r_1}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Thus, the ratio of the fluxes is \( 2.25:1 \), which simplifies to \( 9:4 \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**C: 9:4**
