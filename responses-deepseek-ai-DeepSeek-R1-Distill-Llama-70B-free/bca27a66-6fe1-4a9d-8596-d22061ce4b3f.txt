Okay, so I've got this problem here where a salesman sold some brushes over two weeks, and I need to find the percentage increase from the first week to the second. Let me see how to approach this.

Alright, the first week he sold 927 brushes. The next week, it's 1,059. I remember that percentage increase is calculated by taking the difference between the new and original numbers, dividing by the original, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

So the formula should be: ((New - Original) / Original) * 100.

Let me plug the numbers in. New is 1,059 and Original is 927. The difference is 1,059 minus 927. Let me subtract those. 1,059 - 927 is... let's see, 1,000-927 is 73, and then plus the remaining 59, which would make 132. So the increase is 132.

Now I take that 132 and divide by the original 927. So 132 / 927. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that equals off the top of my head. Maybe I can simplify the fraction.

Let me see if both numbers can be divided by something. 132 and 927. Let's try 3. 132 divided by 3 is 44, and 927 divided by 3 is 309. Wait, 309 can be divided by 3 again. 309 /3 is 103. So now it's 44/103. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 132/927 simplifies to (132 รท3)/(927 รท3) = 44/309. Then 44 and 309, let me see if they have a common factor. 44 is 4*11, 309 is 3*103. 103 is a prime number, I think. So no, they don't have any more common factors. So 44/309 is as simplified as it gets.

Now I need to calculate 44 divided by 309. Let me see, 44 รท 309. Let me think, 309 goes into 44 zero times, so I add a decimal point and some zeros. 440 divided by 309 is 1, because 309*1=309, which leaves 131. Bring down next zero: 1310. 309*4 is 1236. So 4 goes there, subtract 1236 from 1310, that's 74. Bring down another zero: 740. 309*2 is 618. So 2, subtract 618 from 740 gives 122. Another zero: 1220. 309*3 is 927. So 3, subtract 927 from 1220 leaves 293. Another zero: 2930. 309*9 is 2781. So 9, subtract 2781 from 2930 gives 149. Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me see how much I have so far.

So 44 / 309 is approximately 0.1423... Let me check, because when I multiplied 309 by 0.14, that's 43.26. 0.1423*309 is about 44 exactly, so 0.1423 is the decimal.

To get the percentage, I multiply by 100, so that's 14.23%. Looking at the options, option I is 14.239%, which matches. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects rounding. Let me see the options again.

Wait, the options are A:10%, B:22.7%, C:16.8%, D:20.4%, E:17.3%, F:18.6%, G:13.5%, H:12.5%, I:14.239%, J:15.2%.

So option I is 14.239%, which is exactly what I got when I calculated. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my subtraction earlier. 927 to 1,059. 927 + 132 is 1,059. Yes, correct. So the difference is indeed 132. So the formula was correctly applied.

I think that's it. So the answer should be I.

To find the percentage increase in the number of brushes sold, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New} - \text{Original}}{\text{Original}} \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the original number of brushes sold is 927, and the new number is 1,059. The difference is:

\[
1,059 - 927 = 132
\]

Dividing the increase by the original number:

\[
\frac{132}{927} \approx 0.1423
\]

Multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.1423 \times 100 \approx 14.23\%
\]

Among the given options, the closest match is **14.239%**, which corresponds to option I.
