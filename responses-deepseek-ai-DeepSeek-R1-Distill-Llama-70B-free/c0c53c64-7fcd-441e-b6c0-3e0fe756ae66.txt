Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what the question is asking. Oh right, I need to calculate the minimum power required to cool 100 lb-moles per minute of air from 550°R to 500°R when the surrounding temperature is 550°R. And then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with cooling, especially in the context of the second law of thermodynamics, the most efficient way would involve a Carnot cycle operating in reverse, which is essentially a Carnot refrigerator or heat pump. The Carnot cycle gives the maximum coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigeration, so for the minimum power input, that's probably the way to go.

Wait, right, the COP for a refrigerator is the heat removed from the cold reservoir divided by the work input. But wait, in this case, since we're cooling the air, the heat is being removed from the air and expelled to the surroundings. So the cold reservoir here is the air being cooled, and the hot reservoir is the environment, which is at 550 R.

Wait, but wait. The temperatures given are the initial and final temperatures of the air. So the air is going from 550 R to 500 R. So the cold temperature is 500 R, and the hot temperature is 550 R. Because during cooling, the heat is extracted from the cold reservoir (the air) and rejected to the hot reservoir (the surroundings).

So the COP for a Carnot refrigerator is T_cold / (T_hot - T_cold). But wait, is that correct? Wait, actually, the COP is Q_cold / W, where W is work input. And for Carnot, Q_cold = T_cold / (T_hot - T_cold) * W. So COP = Q_cold / W = T_cold / (T_hot - T_cold).

Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, the formula I remember is COP_refrigerator = T_c / (T_h - T_c), where T_c is the temperature of the cold reservoir and T_h is the hot reservoir. So that's correct.

So in this problem, T_c is 500 R, and T_h is 550 R. Plugging in, COP = 500 / (550 - 500) = 500 / 50 = 10. So COP is 10.

Now, the COP is the heat removed (Q_c) divided by the work input (W). So COP = Q_c / W. Therefore, W = Q_c / COP.

So I need to find the heat removed per unit time, which is the cooling rate, and then divide by the COP to get the power required.

But wait, how do I compute Q_c? Let's think. The air is being cooled, so the heat removed is the change in internal energy of the air. Since air can be approximated as an ideal gas, the internal energy depends on temperature.

For an ideal gas, the change in internal energy ΔU is n*Cv*ΔT. Here, n is the number of moles, Cv is molar specific heat at constant volume. Since air is diatomic, Cv is (5/2)R, where R is the gas constant.

Wait, but wait. The problem states 100 lb-moles per minute. So the flow rate is 100 lb-mol/min. So per minute, 100 lb-mol of air are being cooled from 550 R to 500 R.

So the heat removed per minute, Q_c, would be n*Cv*(T_initial - T_final). Wait, since it's cooling, the heat is being removed, so Q_c is positive.

Wait, let me clarify. The air is losing heat, so Q is negative for the system (the air). But from the refrigerator's perspective, Q_c is the heat extracted, which is positive.

So, Q_c = n * Cv * (T_initial - T_final). Because the air is cooling from higher to lower T, so ΔT is T_initial - T_final, and n is the number per minute.

But wait, units: we need to make sure they're consistent. R is in Btu units? Or wait, in the options, the answer is in Btu/min and hp. So I need to use R with units compatible with Btu.

Wait, the gas constant R for air (assuming it's air) is typically around 53.3533 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·R), but wait, that's in imperial units. Alternatively, since we're dealing with Btu, perhaps I should use R in units that will cancel properly.

Wait, another approach: use the specific heat capacity in Btu units. Let's think. The molar specific heat at constant volume for diatomic gases is (5/2)R, where R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·R) or similar. But perhaps it's easier to use the value in Btu/(lb-mol·R).

Wait, the specific heat at constant volume Cv for air is approximately 0.172 Btu/(lb-mol·R). Let me confirm that. I think that's correct. Because for diatomic gases, Cv is (5/2)R, and R is about 10 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·R) which is roughly 0.002568 Btu/(lb-mol·R) [since 1 Btu is about 778 ft·lbf]. So (5/2)*0.002568 ≈ 0.00642 Btu/(lb-mol·R). Wait, that doesn't match 0.172. Hmm, I might be mixing units. Alternatively, perhaps 0.172 is correct when using certain unit conventions.

Wait, perhaps I should use the value of Cv for air as 0.172 Btu/(lb-mol·°R). I think that's correct. Let me proceed with that.

So, Q_c (per minute) is n * Cv * (T_initial - T_final).

n is 100 lb-mol/min.

Cv = 0.172 Btu/(lb-mol·R)

T_initial = 550 R, T_final=500 R.

So Q_c = 100 lb-mol/min * 0.172 Btu/(lb-mol·R) * (550 - 500) R.

Calculating that: 100 * 0.172 * 50 = ?

100 * 0.172 is 17.2, multiplied by 50 gives 860 Btu/min.

So Q_c is 860 Btu/min.

Then, the COP is 10 as calculated earlier. So W = Q_c / COP = 860 / 10 = 86 Btu/min.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the COP is Q_c / W, so W = Q_c / COP. So yes, 860 /10 =86.

But wait, the options are given in negative numbers. Oh, because it's the power required. So the work is input into the system, so it's negative when considering the system's energy perspective, but I think in the options, the negative sign is just indicating that it's power required (input), so maybe they just present it as negative.

So the power required is 86 Btu/min. But wait, let me check the options. The options are in the hundreds like 1300, 1600, etc. So 86 isn't among them. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the specific heat value. Let me double-check the specific heat of air.

Wait, another approach: For air, the molar specific heat at constant volume Cv is (5/2) R. Let's compute R in Btu units.

The gas constant R is 10.7316 (psia·ft³)/(lb-mol·R). But to convert that to Btu units, since 1 Btu is about 778.169 ft·lbf, and 1 ft³ is about 778.169 ft·lbf per Btu. But perhaps it's better to find R in Btu/(lb-mol·R).

Wait, another approach: 1 Btu ≈ 778 ft·lbf. So R is 53.3533 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·R). So converting to Btu:

53.3533 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·R) * (1 Btu / 778.169 ft·lbf) ≈ 53.3533 / 778.169 ≈ 0.06855 Btu/(lb-mol·R).

So for a diatomic gas, Cv = (5/2) R = (5/2) * 0.06855 ≈ 0.17125 Btu/(lb-mol·R). So that's where the 0.172 I used earlier comes from. So that part seems correct.

So Q_c is 100 * 0.172 * (550 -500) = 100 * 0.172 *50 = 860 Btu/min. That seems correct.

Then, with COP 10, W = 860 /10 = 86 Btu/min.

But none of the options are around 86. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: -1600 Btu/min or -37.7 hp

B: -2100 or -49.8 hp

C: -1500 or -35.7 hp

D: -1300 or -30.8 hp

E: -2200 or -52.2 hp

F: -1900 or -45.0 hp

G: -2000 or -47.4 hp

H: -1400 or -33.2 hp

I: -1800 or -42.7 hp

J: -1700 or -40.7 hp

Hmm, the numbers don't match. So where did I go wrong? Let me think.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should have used the enthalpy change instead of internal energy. Because for a flow process, especially where the gas is expanding or contracting, we might consider enthalpy. Wait, but in this case, the process is cooling, but if it's at constant pressure, then heat transfer would be based on enthalpy change (Q = n Cp ΔT). But wait, when dealing with cooling, whether it's a constant volume or constant pressure process? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but in cooling, especially in refrigeration, it's often a constant pressure process, but I might have to think again.

Wait, wait. In thermodynamics, when calculating the heat transfer for a process, if it's a steady flow process, the heat transfer is based on enthalpy change. So the formula would be Q = n Cp ΔT, where Cp is the molar specific heat at constant pressure.

Oh, wait, that's it! Because the air is flowing, it's a steady flow situation, so the heat removed would be based on enthalpy, not internal energy. So I used Cv instead of Cp. That's the mistake.

So let's correct that. The correct approach is to use Cp, the molar specific heat at constant pressure. For diatomic gases, Cp = (7/2) R.

So with R as 0.06855 Btu/(lb-mol·R), Cp would be 0.06855 * (7/2) ≈ 0.06855 *3.5 ≈ 0.239425 Btu/(lb-mol·R).

So let's recalculate Q_c:

Q_c = n * Cp * (T_initial - T_final)

n =100 lb-mol/min

Cp= ~0.2394 Btu/(lb-mol·R)

ΔT=50 R

So Q_c =100 * 0.2394 *50 = 100 * 0.2394 *50 = 100 *11.97 = 1197 Btu/min.

Approximately 1200 Btu/min.

Now, the COP is still 10 as before, because that's based on temperatures and the Carnot cycle, which depends on the temperatures of the reservoirs. So COP remains the same.

So W = Q_c / COP = 1197 /10 = 119.7 Btu/min.

Again, the options don't have 119.7, but let me check the options again. The closest is option D: -1300 Btu/min, which is 1300. Hmm, 1197 is close to 1200, but the options don't have that. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I approximated R as 0.06855, but let me get the exact value.

R in Btu units: 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf. So R = 53.3533 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·R) * (1 Btu / 778.169 ft·lbf) = 53.3533 / 778.169 ≈ 0.06856 Btu/(lb-mol·R).

So Cp for diatomic is (7/2)*0.06856 ≈ 0.2394 Btu/(lb-mol·R).

So n=100, ΔT=50 R.

Q_c = 100 * 0.2394 *50 = 100 * 11.97 = 1197 Btu/min.

Which is about 1197, roughly 1200. But the options don't have exactly that. Let me see if perhaps the problem expects me to use a different Cp value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the COP calculation.

Wait, no. The COP is based on the temperatures, so that's correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, not the Carnot COP, but actual refrigeration cycles. But in the absence of other information, the minimum power is achieved by the Carnot cycle, so I think my approach is correct.

Wait, let me check the options again. The closest to 1200 is option D: -1300 Btu/min. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the Q_c.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the heat transfer from the air to the refrigerant as Q_h, the heat rejected, and the COP is based on that. Wait, no, the COP for a refrigerator is Q_c / W, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should be using Kelvin instead of Rankine? No, because the Rankine scale is absolute like Kelvin. So 550 R is 550 - 459.67 = 90.33 F, but that's not relevant here since in the COP formula, the temperatures are in absolute (Rankine), so 550 and 500 R are correct.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is considering using the specific heat at constant pressure for the cooling process, but perhaps the COP is calculated differently. Wait, no—I think the mistake is in the specific heat value. Alternatively, perhaps I should be using the specific heat in units that match better.

Wait, another way to approach the problem: Use the specific heat in BTU units. Alternatively, perhaps using the mass flow rate instead of molar flow rate, but the problem gives lb-moles, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the COP for heat pumps and refrigerators. Wait, no, the COP for a refrigerator is Q_c / W, and for a heat pump, it's Q_h / W. But in this case, we're cooling, so it's a refrigerator, so COP is correct as Q_c / W.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for R or Cp. For example, sometimes Cp is approximated as 0.24 Btu/(lb-mol·R), which would make the calculation 100 * 0.24 *50 = 1200 Btu/min. So Q_c is 1200.

Then, W = 1200 /10 = 120 Btu/min. Still, none of the options match.

Wait, but the options start at 1300 (option D). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the work input is W = Q_h / COP, where Q_h is the heat rejected. Because Q_h = Q_c + W.

Wait, since Q_h = Q_c + W, and COP = Q_c / W. So substituting, Q_h = W*(COP +1). So W = Q_h / (COP +1). Hmm, but that's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the heat rejected instead of the heat absorbed.

Wait, but in this problem, the heat is removed from the air (Q_c) and expelled to the surroundings (Q_h). So the COP is based on Q_c. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the sign conventions. Let me think again. The COP is Q_c / W, so W = Q_c / COP. So if Q_c is 1200, W is 120.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heat transfer as positive when leaving the system, so Q_c would be negative, but that doesn't affect the magnitude.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Let me compute 100 lb-mol/min * Cp * delta T.

Cp is 0.24 Btu/(lb-mol·R), delta T is 50 R.

So 100 * 0.24 =24, 24 *50=1200 Btu/min.

So yes, 1200 Btu/min.

But in the options, the closest is D: -1300. So perhaps the problem expects me to use a different value for Cp. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the work done on the gas or something else.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the cooling process as a constant pressure process, so using enthalpy, which I did, but perhaps the specific heat used is different. Let me check a reference value. For air, the molar specific heat at constant pressure is approximately 0.24 Btu/(lb-mol·R). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the COP is calculated using T_hot and T_cold in a different way. Let me recheck the COP formula.

COP_refrigerator = T_c / (T_h - T_c). So with T_c=500 R, T_h=550 R, so 500/(550-500)=10. Correct.

So W=1200/10=120 Btu/min. So the power required is 120 Btu/min. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the power from Btu/min to horsepower to see if that aligns with any options. Because each option gives both Btu/min and hp.

So 1 hp is approximately 0.023581 Btu/sec, or per minute, that's 0.023581 *60 = 1.41486 Btu/min per hp.

So to convert W from Btu/min to hp: W (hp) = W (Btu/min) / 1.41486.

So if W is 120 Btu/min, then hp = 120 / 1.41486 ≈ 84.85 hp. But looking at the
