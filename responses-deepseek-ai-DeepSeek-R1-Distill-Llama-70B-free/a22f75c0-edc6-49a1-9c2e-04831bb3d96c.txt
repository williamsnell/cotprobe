Okay, so I have this problem here where a toy was originally priced at $2.25 and then marked down to $2.00. I need to find the percent of markdown. Hmm, markdown percentage, right. I think that's the percentage decrease from the original price to the new price.

Wait, so the markdown is the amount by which the price was reduced, expressed as a percentage of the original price. So first, I need to find the amount of the markdown. That would be the original price minus the new price. Let me calculate that.

Original price is $2.25, and the new price is $2.00. So 2.25 minus 2.00 is $0.25. So the markdown amount is 25 cents. But I need to find what percentage that is relative to the original price.

So the formula for percent markdown is (markdown amount / original price) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: 0.25 divided by 2.25, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Let me compute that. 0.25 divided by 2.25. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on division, but I think 2.25 goes into 0.25 how many times? Wait, 2.25 is larger than 0.25, so the result will be less than 1. Let me think. 2.25 times 0.111 is 0.25, because 2.25 * (1/9) equals 0.25. Because 1/9 is approximately 0.1111. So 0.25 / 2.25 = 1/9 â‰ˆ 0.1111.

So converting that to percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives approximately 11.11%. Looking at the options, I see that option J is 11%, which is the closest. But wait, let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way to compute 0.25 / 2.25. Let's express both as fractions. 0.25 is 1/4, and 2.25 is 9/4. So (1/4) divided by (9/4) equals (1/4) * (4/9) = 1/9. So yes, that's correct. 1/9 is about 0.1111, so 11.11%.

Looking back at the options, option J is 11%, which is the nearest whole number. So the correct answer should be J: 11%.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misunderstand the formula. Markdown is always based on the original price, right? So the formula is correct. So I think I'm confident that the answer is J.

The markdown percentage is calculated by determining the reduction amount and expressing it as a percentage of the original price. The original price is $2.25, and the new price is $2.00, so the markdown amount is $0.25. Using the formula for percent markdown:

\[
\text{Percent Markdown} = \left( \frac{\text{Markdown Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.25}{2.25} \right) \times 100 \approx 11.11\%.
\]

The closest option to 11.11% is 11%, which corresponds to option J.
