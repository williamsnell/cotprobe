Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the product of 0.07 multiplied by 5.8. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my multiplication with decimals, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

First, I'll try to remember the basics. When you multiply two numbers with decimals, you treat them as whole numbers first and then adjust the decimal point afterward. So, maybe I can ignore the decimals for a moment and just multiply 7 by 58. Wait, no, 0.07 is the same as 7 hundredths, right? And 5.8 is five and eight tenths. So perhaps I should think about it another way.

Alternatively, I can break down the numbers. Let's see, 0.07 times 5 is 0.35 because 0.07 * 5 is 0.35. Then, 0.07 times 0.8 would be... wait, 0.07 * 0.8 is 0.056. Oh wait, that might not be the right approach because 5.8 is 5 + 0.8, so maybe I should split it up like that.

So, 0.07 * 5 = 0.35, and 0.07 * 0.8 = 0.056. Then I add those two results together. Adding 0.35 and 0.056 gives me 0.406. Hmm, that seems right. Let me check another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another method is to multiply 0.07 by 5.8 directly. Let's write it down as if they're whole numbers. 7 times 58. Let me calculate that: 7 * 50 is 350, and 7 * 8 is 56, so 350 + 56 is 406. Now, I need to adjust the decimal places. The original numbers have two decimal places in total (one from 0.07 and one from 5.8), so I move the decimal two places to the left in 406. That gives me 0.406.

Wait, let me count the decimal places again. 0.07 has two decimal places (the 0 and the 7) and 5.8 has one. So together, that's three decimal places. Oh wait no, 0.07 is two decimal places (as it's hundredths), and 5.8 is one (tenths), so total is three. Wait, but when I multiplied 7 * 58, I treated them as whole numbers, so the product is 406, but I need to account for three decimal places. So moving the decimal three places to the left in 406 would give me 0.406. Wait, no, 406 with three decimal places would be 0.406? Let me think again. 406 is 406.0, moving decimal three places left: 406.0 becomes 40.60 after two places, and 4.060 after three. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got 0.35 + 0.056 = 0.406, which is two decimal places. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the decimal places.

Wait, 0.07 has two decimal places, 5.8 has one. So total of three decimal places. So the product should have three decimal places. So 406 becomes 0.406 when moving three places. Because 406 divided by 1000 is 0.406. So that's correct.

Looking back at the options: A is 0.406, B is 0.0406, C is 4.06, D is 40.6. So the correct answer should be A: 0.406.

Wait, but earlier when I split it into 5 and 0.8, I added 0.35 and 0.056 to get 0.406, which matches. So I think A is correct.

To find the product of 0.07 and 5.8, we can multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers and then adjust the decimal point. 

1. Multiply 7 (from 0.07) by 58 (from 5.8):  
   \( 7 \times 58 = 406 \).

2. Count the total number of decimal places in the original numbers. 0.07 has 2 decimal places, and 5.8 has 1 decimal place, for a total of 3 decimal places.

3. Place the decimal point in 406 such that it accounts for the 3 decimal places:  
   \( 406 \rightarrow 0.406 \).

Thus, the product of 0.07 and 5.8 is 0.406. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

A: 0.406
