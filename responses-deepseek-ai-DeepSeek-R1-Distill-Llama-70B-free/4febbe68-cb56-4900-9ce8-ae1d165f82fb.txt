Okay, so I've got this series to check for convergence: the sum from n=0 to infinity of n! divided by (n squared times cosine n). The options given are multiple choice, A through J. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with series convergence, there are several tests we can use: comparison test, ratio test, root test, integral test, alternating series test, etc. I'll need to figure out which one applies here.

Looking at the general term: n! / (n² cos n). So the numerator is factorial, which grows very rapidly. The denominator has n squared, which grows polynomially, and cos n, which oscillates between -1 and 1.

Wait, cos n is the cosine of n radians, right? So as n increases, cos n doesn't settle to a particular value; it keeps oscillating. That might complicate things because the sign of the terms could alternate or vary unpredictably. But wait, wait—actually, for large n, cos(n) doesn't really alternate signs in a regular way because n is in radians and each increment is a full radian, so the sequence cos(n) oscillates but not like (-1)^n.

But in any case, the magnitude of the denominator's cosine term is between 0 and 1. So the denominator could be as small as n² * 0 (but wait, cos(n) can't be zero for integer n? Or can it? Hmm, let me check. Oh wait, cos(n) for integer n in radians—n isn't necessarily a multiple of π/2, so cos(n) doesn't become zero. So the denominator is always non-zero. So the terms are defined for all n.

Now, the general term is n! / (n² cos n). Let's see how this behaves as n approaches infinity.

Factorial grows faster than exponential, which in turn grows faster than any polynomial. So n! in the numerator is going to dominate over the n squared in the denominator. But then, we have the cosine term. The problem is that the cosine term's absolute value is at most 1, so 1/cos n could be as large as 1 or as small as... well, depends on cos n. But when cos n is near zero, 1/cos n becomes very large. Wait, but does that happen? For integer n, can cos(n) approach zero? Because n is an integer, each step is 1 radian, but I don't think cos(n) gets arbitrarily close to zero. Because the values of cos(n) for integer n are dense in [-1,1], I think. So it's possible that cos(n) comes arbitrarily close to zero, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: since π is irrational, the sequence n mod 2π is dense in [0, 2π), so cos(n) is dense in [-1,1]. So yes, cos(n) can get as close to zero as we like, which means that 1/cos(n) can become arbitrarily large in magnitude.

Wait, but for convergence, we usually care about the limit of the terms going to zero. If the terms don't approach zero, the series can't converge. So let's check the limit of n!/(n² cos n) as n approaches infinity.

But wait, n! grows faster than any exponential function. So even though n squared is growing, n! will dominate that. So the numerator grows very rapidly, while the denominator grows polynomially but is multiplied by a cosine term which fluctuates. So the question is, does the general term approach zero?

If the limit of a_n as n approaches infinity is not zero, then the series diverges. So let's compute the limit.

lim_{n→∞} n!/(n² cos n). Hmm, the numerator n! is massive, while the denominator is n² times something that's at most 1 in absolute value. So the numerator's growth will make the whole fraction go to infinity, unless it's somehow tempered by the denominator.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The denominator is n² * cos(n). The cos(n) varies between -1 and 1. So the denominator can be as small as n² * (some small positive number, like approaching zero). So n!/(n² cos n) could become infinitely large if cos(n) approaches zero. But for the limit, we're looking at the behavior as n increases, but for the series to converge, it's necessary (but not sufficient) that the terms approach zero.

So if the limit of a_n doesn't exist (because sometimes it's positive and sometimes negative, and with varying magnitudes), but even if the terms don't approach zero, then the series can't converge.

Wait, but for n!/(n² cos n), as n becomes very large, n! is growing faster than n², so the terms are blowing up. Unless cos(n) is negative, but even then, the magnitude is growing.

Wait, but let's take absolute values. The absolute value of a_n is n!/(n² |cos n|). Since |cos n| ≤ 1, the denominator is ≤ n². So n! grows faster than n², so n!/(n²) tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_n| tends to infinity, which means a_n doesn't approach zero. 

If the terms don't approach zero, the series can't converge. So it must diverge.

Wait, but wait another thought: what if the series alternates in sign enough that positive and negative terms might cancel out? But no, because the terms are growing in magnitude. So even if there's some cancellation, the terms are getting larger in magnitude, so the partial sums might oscillate without settling down. But in this case, since |a_n| → ∞, the series can't converge; it diverges.

So looking at the options: option D is "Diverges", and option I is "Diverges to infinity". Wait, but does it diverge to infinity, or does it oscillate? Because the terms could alternate in sign if cos(n) sometimes is positive and sometimes negative.

Wait, but in the given series, the terms can be positive or negative based on cos(n). So the series isn't necessarily all positive or all negative. So the partial sums could oscillate, but with the terms growing in magnitude. So it's more like the series doesn't settle to any particular value, but the terms themselves get larger in magnitude. So in that case, the series would diverge. So the correct answer would be D: Diverges.

Wait, but looking back, the options are: D is "Diverges", I is "Diverges to infinity". Hmm, but if the terms alternate in sign, but their magnitudes increase, then the series doesn't go to positive or negative infinity; it might oscillate without bound. So in that case, the series would diverge (option D) but not necessarily diverge to infinity (option I). So the correct choice would be D.

Alternatively, if the terms all had the same sign and their magnitudes increased, then it would diverge to infinity. But in this case, since the sign alternates, the series just diverges without approaching any particular direction.

Wait, but wait: let me reevaluate the behavior. The general term a_n = n!/(n² cos n). Let's think about the magnitude |a_n| = n!/(n² |cos n|). Since |cos n| ≤1, |a_n| ≥ n! /n². As n increases, n! grows much faster than n², so |a_n| tends to infinity. Therefore, the terms don't approach zero, so the series can't converge. So the series diverges.

So the correct answer is D: Diverges.

The given series is $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n!}{n^2 \cos(n)}$. To determine whether this series converges, we analyze the behavior of its general term $a_n = \frac{n!}{n^2 \cos(n)}$.

1. **Numerator and Denominator Analysis**:  
   - The numerator $n!$ grows very rapidly, faster than any polynomial or exponential function.  
   - The denominator $n^2 \cos(n)$ grows polynomially ($n^2$) but is modulated by $\cos(n)$, which oscillates between $-1$ and $1$.  

2. **Behavior of $\cos(n)$**:  
   - Since $\cos(n)$ oscillates between $-1$ and $1$, it does not approach a specific value as $n \to \infty$. Additionally, because $n$ is an integer, $\cos(n)$ does not settle to zero but can come arbitrarily close to it due to the density of $n \mod 2\pi$ in $[0, 2\pi)$.  

3. **Magnitude of the General Term**:  
   - The magnitude of the general term is $|a_n| = \frac{n!}{n^2 |\cos(n)|}$. Since $|\cos(n)| \leq 1$, the denominator is at most $n^2$.  
   - As $n \to \infty$, $n!$ grows much faster than $n^2$, so $|a_n|$ tends to infinity.  

4. **Necessity of Terms Approaching Zero**:  
   - For a series to converge, it is necessary (but not sufficient) that the terms $a_n$ approach zero. Here, $|a_n| \to \infty$, so $a_n$ does not approach zero.  

5. **Conclusion on Convergence**:  
   - Since the terms $a_n$ do not approach zero and their magnitudes grow without bound, the series cannot converge. Additionally, because the terms oscillate in sign due to $\cos(n)$, the series does not diverge to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ but instead diverges without settling to any specific value.

From the given options:  
- **D: Diverges** is correct because the series does not converge.  
- **I: Diverges to infinity** is incorrect because the series does not settle to $+\infty$ or $-\infty$ due to the oscillating nature of $\cos(n)$.  

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
