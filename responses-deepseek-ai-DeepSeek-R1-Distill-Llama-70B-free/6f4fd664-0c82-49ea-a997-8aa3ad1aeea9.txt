Okay, so I have this question about Ebola and I need to figure out the biggest risk factor for infection. Let me start by recalling what I know about Ebola. 

Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever, right? It's spread through contact with infected bodily fluids. So things like blood, sweat, and saliva. I remember that it's highly contagious, especially in certain situations.

The question asks for the biggest risk factor. The options are A through D. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Working in a category IV laboratory. Category IV labs handle the most dangerous pathogens. They have strict safety protocols, like biosafety suits and containment measures. So while the pathogens are dangerous, the risk might be lower because of the precautions taken. Plus, lab workers are trained professionals, so maybe this isn't the biggest risk factor.

Option B: Attending a funeral of a victim outside. I remember reading that funerals, especially in certain cultures, involve touching or handling the body of the deceased. If the person died from Ebola, their body still has the virus in their fluids. So people attending the funeral might come into contact with the body, increasing their risk. This seems like a significant risk factor.

Option C: Nursing a patient at home. Nursing someone with Ebola without proper protective equipment is extremely risky. In the home setting, the caregiver might not have access to the same level of PPE as in a hospital. Direct contact with the patient's fluids can lead to infection. This is a high-risk scenario.

Option D: Attending football matches or large gatherings. Large gatherings could potentially spread the virus if someone is infected, but Ebola isn't airborne. Transmission requires direct contact with infected fluids. So unless there's a lot of close contact with someone who's symptomatic, the risk might be lower than the other options.

Now, comparing the options. Both B and C seem high-risk. Nursing at home involves direct, prolonged contact with the patient, which is a major risk. Funerals involve handling the body, which also poses a significant risk. Which one is bigger?

I think in Ebola outbreaks, funerals have been identified as super-spreader events. Traditional burial practices where mourners touch or wash the body can lead to widespread transmission. So attending a funeral might be a bigger risk factor than nursing at home. But wait, nursing at home still involves direct care, which is risky too.

Alternatively, maybe the highest risk is in healthcare settings where patients are being treated without proper precautions. But the question is about the biggest risk factor. From what I've learned, attending funerals where the body is handled without protection is a major contributor to outbreaks. So perhaps option B is the answer.

Wait, but in another perspective, healthcare workers, even at home, are at high risk because they're in close contact with the patient's fluids. So maybe option C is higher than B. I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. In Ebola, the virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected secretions. So both situations involve contact, but the nature of contact might differ. At a funeral, people might touch the body, which is a direct exposure. Nursing involves more frequent and intimate contact, like handling bodily fluids during care. So which is a bigger risk?

I think the risk might be higher in the nursing scenario because it's more hands-on and occurs over a longer period. However, funerals often involve multiple people coming into contact, leading to more cases in a short time. But the question is about the biggest risk factor for an individual getting infected.

Hmm, perhaps the highest risk is in direct care without protection. So option C, nursing a patient at home, is the biggest risk factor because it involves close, repeated contact with the patient's fluids without proper PPE. Alternatively, funerals are a significant source of transmission but maybe not the highest individual risk factor.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. I remember that during the 2014 outbreak, a lot of cases were linked to funerals. The CDC and other organizations emphasized that touching the body of someone who died from Ebola is a high-risk activity. So attending a funeral where you touch the body would be a major risk.

But then, in a home care setting, without proper precautions, each interaction with the patient could expose the caregiver. So perhaps the individual risk is higher in nursing.

Alternatively, looking at the options again: Option C is "nursing a patient at home." If you're a caregiver without proper PPE, that's very risky. But option B is attending a funeral, where perhaps the contact is less prolonged but still direct.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to look for which is more likely to cause infection. If someone is nursing a patient, they might be exposed multiple times a day, increasing the chance. At a funeral, it's a one-time exposure but involving a corpse, which might have high viral load.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the biggest risk factor is direct contact with infected bodily fluids, which would occur both in nursing and at funerals. But which is the highest? Maybe attending a funeral is a bigger risk because it's a known high-risk activity. Alternatively, maybe the act of nursing involves more exposure.

Wait, another approach: the question is about the biggest risk factor. So looking for the option that is most strongly associated with transmission. I think healthcare workers, even in home settings, are at higher risk because they are in close contact with the patient's fluids. So option C might be the answer.

But I'm not certain. I'm a bit torn between B and C. Another way to think: category IV lab (A) is probably the safest, so not the answer. Football matches (D) are low risk. So between B and C.

I think the correct answer is C: Nursing a patient at home, because that's direct and repeated exposure. Alternatively, some sources say that funerals are a major risk. For example, the initial spread in outbreaks often happens at funerals where traditional practices involve washing the body. But for an individual, the risk might be higher when providing care without protection.

Wait, I'm going to look for how the CDC describes risk factors. According to CDC, Ebola is spread through direct contact with blood or body fluids of a patient. Healthcare workers are at high risk if infection control is not followed. Similarly, participating in funeral rites that involve direct contact with the body can spread the disease.

So which is the bigger risk? It's hard to say, but perhaps in terms of individual risk, direct care without PPE is higher than a single exposure at a funeral.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: in the options, option B is attending a funeral outside. Maybe the risk is lower because it's outside, but that's not necessarily the case. Handling the body would still be risky regardless of location.

I'm going to go with option C: Nursing a patient at home as the biggest risk factor because it involves direct, continuous exposure to the patient's fluids without proper protective measures.

The question asks for the biggest risk factor for infection with Ebola, which is a viral hemorrhagic fever spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. The analysis evaluates four options:

- **Option A: Working in a category IV laboratory**  
  While category IV labs handle dangerous pathogens, they also have strict safety protocols, including biosafety suits and containment measures. This reduces the risk of infection despite the dangerous nature of the pathogens.

- **Option B: Attending a funeral of a victim outside**  
  Funerals, particularly in cultures where mourners touch or handle the body of the deceased, are known to be high-risk events. Ebola virus remains present in the bodily fluids of the deceased, and direct contact can lead to transmission. Funerals have been identified as super-spreader events in Ebola outbreaks.

- **Option C: Nursing a patient at home**  
  Nursing a patient at home involves direct and often prolonged contact with the patient's bodily fluids. Without proper personal protective equipment (PPE), this setting poses a significant risk of infection. The repeated and intimate nature of caregiving increases the likelihood of exposure.

- **Option D: Attending football matches or large gatherings**  
  While large gatherings could theoretically spread Ebola if an infected person is present, the virus is not airborne and requires direct contact with infected fluids. Thus, the risk in such settings is relatively low compared to other options.

Comparing the highest-risk options, **B (attending a funeral)** and **C (nursing a patient at home)**, both involve direct contact with infected fluids. However, nursing a patient at home typically involves more frequent and prolonged exposure, increasing the individual risk of infection. While funerals are significant contributors to outbreaks, the continuous and intimate nature of caregiving at home makes it the biggest risk factor for individual infection.

**Answer: C**
