Okay, so I have this question about GDP, which stands for Gross Domestic Product. I remember that GDP is a measure of a country's economic performance. The equation given is GDP = C + I + G + X. I need to figure out what X stands for.

Let me try to recall the components of GDP. From what I learned before, GDP is calculated by adding up different expenditure categories. The basic formula is GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports. Oh wait, I think sometimes it's written as C + I + G + (X - M), where X is exports and M is imports. But in this question, X is just one term, so maybe X represents net exports.

Alternatively, I think X could stand for exports minus imports. Because sometimes the formula is written as GDP = C + I + G + X, where X is net exports, which is exports minus imports. So in that case, X would be option A: exports minus imports? Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option A is exports. Option B is exports minus imports. So if X is net exports, that's B. But wait, I've seen the formula where X is just exports, and then imports are subtracted as a separate term, but that doesn't make sense because the standard formula includes net exports as a single component.

Wait, no. The standard formula is C + I + G + (X - M), where X is exports and M is imports. So X alone would be just exports, but in the equation given here, it's just X. So maybe in this case, X stands for net exports, which would be exports minus imports. So that would be option B.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because sometimes X is used to denote exports. Wait, in some textbooks, they might use X as the net export term. For example, if the equation is GDP = C + I + G + X, where X is net exports (exports minus imports), then X would correspond to option B.

So the options are:

A: exports.

B: exports minus imports.

So if X is net exports, then the correct answer is B. But wait, another thought: in some contexts, X might just represent exports, and the formula might implicitly subtract imports elsewhere, but I think the standard is that net exports are included as a separate term. So the equation would be C + I + G + (exports - imports) = GDP, which would make X equal to exports - imports, so option B.

Wait, but in the equation given, it's written as X, not (X - M), so perhaps the question is using X as the net export term. So yes, X would be exports minus imports, which is option B.

The equation GDP = C + I + G + X represents the components of Gross Domestic Product, where C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, and X is the remaining term to be identified. In the standard formula for GDP, the term representing international trade is net exports, which is calculated as exports minus imports. Since the equation provided does not explicitly separate exports and imports, X must stand for net exports, which is exports minus imports.

Option A refers only to exports, which is incomplete in this context. Option B correctly identifies X as exports minus imports, aligning with the standard GDP formula. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: exports minus imports.

Answer: B
