Okay, let's see. I have this equation to solve: 18.5 dollars over m gallons equals 3.60 dollars over 7.5 gallons. I'm supposed to find m and round it to the nearest hundredth if needed. Hmm, so it's a proportion problem, I think.

Alright, so the equation is 18.5/m = 3.60/7.5. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is 18.5 dollars over m gallons. Oh, right, so dollars per gallon maybe? Or maybe it's dollars for m gallons. Oh, right, the setup is 18.5 dollars for m gallons equals 3.60 dollars for 7.5 gallons. So maybe it's a unit price comparison.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as a proportion. Let me think. It's like saying 18.5 dollars is to m gallons as 3.60 dollars is to 7.5 gallons. So 18.5/m = 3.60/7.5. No, wait, wait. Because if 18.5 is for m gallons, then the price per gallon would be 18.5/m. Similarly, 3.60 is for 7.5 gallons, so 3.60/7.5 is the price per gallon. So setting them equal: 18.5/m = 3.60/7.5.

Wait, but that would imply that the price per gallon is the same in both cases. So yes, solving for m would give me the equivalent gallons at that price.

Wait, maybe I should cross-multiply. So 18.5 multiplied by 7.5 equals 3.60 multiplied by m. Then m would be (18.5 * 7.5) / 3.60.

Let me calculate that. Let's compute 18.5 times 7.5 first. 18 times 7 is 126, 18 times 0.5 is 9, so 135. Then 0.5 times 7 is 3.5, 0.5 times 0.5 is 0.25. Wait, maybe an easier way. 18.5 *7.5 is the same as 18.5*(7 + 0.5) = 18.5*7 + 18.5*0.5.

18.5*7: 10*7=70, 8*7=56, 0.5*7=3.5. So 70+56=126 +3.5=129.5.

18.5*0.5 is 9.25.

So 129.5 +9.25 = 138.75.

So 18.5 *7.5 = 138.75.

Now, divide that by 3.60 to get m. So m = 138.75 / 3.60.

Hmm, let me compute that. 3.60 goes into 138.75 how many times?

Well, 3.60 times 38 is 136.80, right? 3.60 *38=136.80. Because 3.60*30=108, 3.60*8=28.80, so 108+28.80=136.80.

Subtract that from 138.75: 138.75 -136.80 = 1.95.

Now, 3.60 goes into 1.95 how many times? 3.60 *0.5 is 1.80, so 0.5 times. That leaves 0.15 remaining.

So 38 + 0.5 =38.5, and 0.15/3.60 is 0.041666...

So m is approximately 38.541666..., which is about 38.54 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 38.44, which is close but not exactly what I got. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the division. 3.60 into 138.75.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by simplifying the division. Let's write 138.75 divided by 3.60.

I can multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 13875 / 360.

Now, let's simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 15, perhaps.

Wait, 15 times 922.5 is 13875? Wait, maybe better to see:

Wait 360 times 38 is 13,680. 360 *38=13,680. Then 13,680 plus 360*0.5=180, so 13,860. Hmm, but the numerator is 13,875. So 13,875 -13,860 =15. So 360*38.5 is 13,860 + 180=14,040, which is more than 13,875. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 138.75 / 3.6.

Let me do this step by step.

3.6 * 38 = ?

3.6 *30 = 108.

3.6 *8=28.8.

So 108 +28.8=136.8.

So 3.6 *38=136.8.

Subtract that from 138.75: 138.75 -136.8 =1.95.

So now, how much is 1.95 /3.6?

Well, 3.6 * 0.5=1.8, so 0.5 *3.6=1.8.

Subtract 1.8 from 1.95, leaves 0.15.

So now, 0.15 /3.6 = 0.041666...

So total is 38 +0.5 +0.041666... which is 38.541666..., approximately 38.54.

Looking back at the options, I don't see 38.54. The options are A:45.67, B:28.14, C:36.99, D:32.54, E:8.86, F:38.44, G:40.88, H:33.21, I:42.25, J:50.32.

Hmm, the closest is F:38.44, but my calculation says 38.54. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial multiplication.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recalculate 18.5 multiplied by 7.5.

18.5 *7.5. Let's compute 18 *7.5 and 0.5 *7.5, then add.

18*7.5: 10*7.5=75, 8*7.5=60, so 75+60=135.

0.5 *7.5=3.75.

So 135 +3.75=138.75. That part seems correct.

Now, 138.75 divided by 3.60. Let me try another approach.

138.75 ÷ 3.60.

Let me express both as fractions. 138.75 is 138 and 3/4, which is 555/4. 3.60 is 18/5.

So (555/4) ÷ (18/5) = (555/4) * (5/18) = (555 *5)/(4*18) = 2775 /72.

Now, 2775 ÷72.

Let me compute 72*38=2736. 2775-2736=39.

So 38 with a remainder of 39.

39/72 = 13/24 ≈ 0.541666...

So 38.541666..., which is 38.54 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Wait, but the options don't have 38.54. The closest is F:38.44.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-examine the original problem.

The problem says 18.5 dollars over m gallons equals 3.60 dollars over 7.5 gallons.

So 18.5/m = 3.60/7.5.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of unit price: dollars per gallon.

So, the price per gallon in the first case is 18.5/m, and in the second case, 3.60/7.5. So setting them equal: 18.5/m = 3.60/7.5.

Then, cross-multiplying, 18.5 *7.5 = 3.60 *m.

So m = (18.5 *7.5)/3.60.

Wait, that's what I did earlier, which gives 38.54.

But the options don't have that. So maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the equation is 18.5/m equals 3.60/7.5, and I'm solving for m, which is correct. So perhaps the options have a typo, or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for dollars per gallon, not gallons. Let me check the question again.

The question says: Solve 18.5 dollars over m gallons equals 3.60 dollars over 7.5 gallons. Round to the nearest hundredth if necessary.

Wait, perhaps I should solve for m, which I did, getting 38.54, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me compute 3.60 /7.5 first.

3.60 ÷7.5 = ?

Well, 7.5 times 0.48 is 3.6, right? 7.5 *0.4=3.0, 7.5*0.08=0.6; so 3.0+0.6=3.6. So 0.48 dollars per gallon.

So 18.5/m =0.48 dollars per gallon.

So m=18.5 /0.48.

Compute that. 18.5 ÷0.48.

Let me compute that. 0.48 *38=18.24.

Subtract that from 18.5: 18.5 -18.24=0.26.

So 0.26/0.48 = approximately 0.541666...

So m=38 +0.541666... =38.541666... which is 38.54 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

So why isn't 38.54 an option? The options are A:45.67, B:28.14, C:36.99, D:32.54, E:8.86, F:38.44, G:40.88, H:33.21, I:42.25, J:50.32.

Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated somewhere. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative calculation: 18.5 *7.5 = ?

Wait, 18*7=126, 18*.5=9, .5*7=3.5, .5*.5=0.25. So 126 +9=135, 3.5+0.25=3.75, total 138.75.

138.75 divided by 3.60: Let me do this on paper.

3.60 ) 138.75

3.60 goes into 138.75 how many times?

3.60 *38 = 136.80.

138.75 -136.80 =1.95.

Bring down a zero (since decimals): 19.50.

3.60 goes into 19.50 five times (3.60*5=18.00). Subtract 18 from 19.50, get 1.50.

Bring down another zero: 15.00.

3.60 goes into 15.00 four times (3.60*4=14.40). Subtract, get 0.60.

Bring down another zero: 6.00.

3.60 goes into 6.00 once (3.60), subtract, remainder 2.40.

Bring down another zero: 24.0.

3.60 goes into 24.0 six times (3.60*6=21.60), remainder 2.40.

Wait, I'm seeing a repeating decimal here. So after 38, it's 38.541666...

So m=38.541666..., which is approximately 38.54.

But the options don't include 38.54. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe the equation is set up incorrectly. The problem says 18.5 dollars over m gallons equals 3.60 dollars over 7.5 gallons.

Wait, perhaps it's 18.5/m = 3.60/7.5. Yes, that's how I set it up.

Alternatively, maybe the question is 18.5 dollars for m gallons equals 3.60 dollars for 7.5 gallons, meaning that 18.5 is the price for m gallons and 3.60 is the price for 7.5 gallons, and they are the same price per gallon, so m would be the equivalent gallons.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate 18.5 divided by 3.60, then multiply by 7.5 to get m. Let me try that.

Wait, 18.5 /3.60 = ?

3.60 *5=18.0, so 5 with a remainder of 0.5.

0.5/3.60=0.138888...

So 5.138888...

Then multiply by 7.5: 5.138888... *7.5.

Compute 5*7.5=37.5.

0.138888... *7.5: 0.138888 is 5/36.

5/36 *7.5 = (5 *7.5)/36 = 37.5/36 ≈1.041666...

So total is 37.5 +1.041666...=38.541666..., same as before.

So m=38.54.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options: A:45.67, B:28.14, C:36.99, D:32.54, E:8.86, F:38.44, G:40.88, H:33.21, I:42.25, J:50.32.

Hmm, F is 38.44, which is close to 38.54 but not exact. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try 18.5*7.5=138.75.

Then divide by 3.60.

Compute 3.60 *38=136.80.

138.75-136.80=1.95.

Now, 1.95 /3.60 = 0.541666...

So 38 +0.541666...=38.541666...

Which is 38.54 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's impossible because it's a multiple-choice question. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is 18.5 dollars over m gallons equals 3.60 dollars over 7.5 gallons, and we're solving for m. So the setup is correct.

Wait, maybe I should check if the question was written correctly. Oh wait, maybe the equation is (18.5/m) = (3.60/7.5). Yes, that's how I approached it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is 18.5 over m equals 3.60 over 7.5, but perhaps it's 18.5/m = 3.60/(7.5).

Wait, that's the same as I did before.

Wait, maybe the question is 18.5 over m equals 3.60 over 7.5, but perhaps the setup is different. Maybe it's 18.5/(m gal) = 3.60/(7.5 gal), but that would imply that the units are dollars per gallon, which would make the equation 18.5/m = 3.60/7.5, which is what I have.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is not in the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me try computing 18.5 *7.5 again.

18 *7=126, 18*.5=9, 0.5*7=3.5, 0.5*.5=0.25.

Wait, 18.5*7.5 can be done as (20-1.5)*7.5=20*7.5 -1.5*7.5=150 -11.25=138.75. So that's correct.

Then 138.75 divided by 3.60.

Let me try another approach: 3.60 * x =138.75.

x=138.75/3.60.

Let me express both in terms of fractions.

138.75 is 138 and 3/4, which is 555/4.

3.60 is 36/10, which is 18/5.

So x= (555/4) / (18/5) )= (555/4) * (5/18)= (555*5)/(4*18)=2775/72.

Simplify 2775/72.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 925/24.

925 ÷24: 24*38=912. 925-912=13.

So 38 and 13/24, which is approximately 38.541666...

So again, 38.54.

But in the options, F is 38.44, which is 0.10 less.

Wait, perhaps I should check if 3.60 is in the numerator instead of the denominator.

Wait, if the equation was 18.5/m =3.60/7.5, then m= (18.5 *7.5)/3.60=138.75/3.60=38.541666...

But if the equation was 3.60/m=18.5/7.5, then m would be (3.60 *7.5)/18.5=27/18.5= approximately 1.459, which is option E:8.86? No, wait, 27/18.5 is 1.459, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I inverted the equation.

Wait, maybe the correct setup is 3.60/18.5 =7.5/m.

Wait, that would be if 3.60 dollars for 18.5 gallons equals 7.5 gallons for m dollars, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps the question is
