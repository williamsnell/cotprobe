Okay, so I have this problem here where James Milford spent $348.88 on tea, and each kilogram costs $0.98. I need to find out how many kilos he bought. Alright, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when you want to find out how many items you can buy with a certain amount of money, you divide the total amount by the price per item. So in this case, it's the total money spent divided by the cost per kilogram.

So the total spent is $348.88, and each kilo is $0.98. So the calculation should be 348.88 divided by 0.98.

Hmm, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Sometimes when dealing with money, it's easy to mix up the decimal places. But I think as long as both numbers are in dollars, the units will work out to kilos.

Let me write that down: 348.88 ÷ 0.98. How do I do this division? Well, dividing by a decimal can be tricky, but I remember that I can adjust it to make it easier. If I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals, that might help.

So, 348.88 becomes 34888, and 0.98 becomes 98. Now the problem is 34888 ÷ 98. That seems a bit simpler.

Wait, but maybe there's a quicker way without doing that. Let me think. 0.98 is almost 1, so the number of kilos should be a bit less than 348.88. Because each kilo is slightly less than a dollar. So the answer should be just under 348.88, maybe around 350 or so.

Looking at the options, I see J is 350, which seems close. But wait, let's calculate it accurately.

Let me try doing the division step by step. 

I can start by seeing how many times 98 fits into 348.88.

Alternatively, perhaps I can simplify the division. Let's try dividing 348.88 by 0.98 using a calculator approach.

But since I might not have a calculator, let me think about it differently. 0.98 is the same as 98/100, so dividing by 0.98 is the same as multiplying by 100/98. So 348.88 * (100/98).

Wait, that might be easier. Let's compute that.

100/98 simplifies to approximately 1.0204. So 348.88 multiplied by approximately 1.0204.

Let me compute that. 348.88 * 1 = 348.88, and 348.88 * 0.0204 is roughly... Let's see, 348.88 * 0.02 is 6.9776, and 348.88 * 0.0004 is about 0.13955. So adding those together: 6.9776 + 0.13955 = 7.11715. So total is approximately 348.88 +7.11715= 355.997, roughly 356.

Wait, so that's approximately 356 kilos. Let me check the options. Option H is 356 kilos. So that would be the answer.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because 0.98 is 98 cents, so when I divide 348.88 by 0.98, another approach is to think how much 348.88 is when each kilo is 98 cents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can do the division more precisely.

Let me compute 348.88 ÷ 0.98.

I can write this as 348.88 / 0.98 = ?

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 34888 / 98.

Now, let's compute 34888 ÷98.

How many times does 98 go into 34888?

Let me try to compute this step by step.

First, 98 * 350 is 34300, because 98 * 300 = 29400, 98*50=4900, so 29400+4900=34300. 34300 is less than 34888.

The difference is 34888 -34300=588.

Now, how many times does 98 go into 588? Let's compute 588 ÷98.

98 *6=588, exactly. So 6.

So total is 350 +6=356.

So 98 *356=34888, which means 348.88 ÷0.98=356.

So the correct answer is 356 kilos, which is option H.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 356 kilos. So that should be the correct choice.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in arithmetic.

So 98 *356.

Let me compute 98 *300=29400.

98 *50=4900.

98 *6=588.

So adding those together: 29400 +4900=34300, plus 588 is 34888. So yes, correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is H: 356 kilos.

To determine how many kilograms of tea James Milford purchased, we divide the total amount spent ($348.88) by the cost per kilogram ($0.98). 

1. **Set up the calculation**:  
   \[
   \text{Kilos purchased} = \frac{348.88}{0.98}
   \]

2. **Simplify the division**:  
   To eliminate decimals, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100:  
   \[
   \frac{34888}{98}
   \]

3. **Perform the division**:  
   - \(98 \times 350 = 34300\), which is less than 34888.  
   - The difference is \(34888 - 34300 = 588\).  
   - \(98 \times 6 = 588\), so 98 fits into 588 exactly 6 times.  

4. **Add the results**:  
   \[
   350 + 6 = 356
   \]

Thus, James Milford purchased **356 kilos** of tea.  

**Answer: H**
