Okay, so I've got this problem here about successively discounting an amount. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the net amount obtained from $4,500.00 successively discounted at 20%, 15%, and 2½%. I'm a bit rusty on successive discounts, but I think it means applying each discount one after the other. 

Alright, let me break it down step by step. First, I need to calculate the discount at each step and then find the remaining amount after each discount. 

Starting with the initial amount, which is $4,500.00. The first discount is 20%. So, I need to find 20% of 4,500 and subtract that from 4,500 to get the new amount after the first discount.

Wait, calculating percentages. 20% is like 0.2 in decimal form. So, 20% of 4,500 is 0.2 * 4500. Let me compute that. 0.2 times 4500 is 900. So, subtracting that from 4500 gives me 3600. So after the first discount, the amount is $3,600. 

Next, the second discount is 15%. Now, I think I apply this 15% discount to the new amount, which is $3,600. So, 15% of 3600. 15% is 0.15. 0.15 * 3600 is... let me calculate. 0.1 * 3600 is 360, 0.05 * 3600 is 180, so 360 + 180 is 540. So the discount here is $540. Subtracting that from 3600 gives 3600 - 540 = 3060. So now, the amount is $3,060 after the second discount.

Now, the third discount is 2½%. Hmm, that's 2.5%. So I apply this 2.5% discount to the latest amount, which is $3,060. Let's compute 2.5% of 3060. 2.5% is 0.025. So 0.025 * 3060... Let me think. 3060 divided by 40 (since 2.5% is 1/40th) is 76.5. So, the discount here is $76.50. 

Subtracting that from 3060 gives 3060 - 76.50 = 2983.50. So the final amount after all three discounts is $2,983.50. 

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

First discount: 20% of 4500 is 900, so 4500-900=3600. That's correct. 

Second discount: 15% of 3600 is 540, so 3600-540=3060. That's right. 

Third discount: 2.5% of 3060. Let me compute it another way. 1% of 3060 is 30.60, so 2% is 61.20 and 0.5% is 15.30. Adding them together: 61.20 +15.30=76.50. So yes, subtracting 76.50 gives 3060 -76.50=2983.50. 

Looking at the answer options, option G is $2,983.50. So the correct answer should be G.

But wait, another thought. Sometimes, when dealing with successive discounts, people might think about combining them into a single equivalent discount. But in this case, since each discount is applied on the reduced price, it's easier to just compute them step by step as I did. So, I think my approach is correct.

The problem involves calculating the net amount after successively applying three discounts—20%, 15%, and 2½%—to the initial amount of $4,500.00. Each discount is applied to the reduced amount from the previous step.

1. **First discount (20%):**  
   - 20% of $4,500 is $900.  
   - Subtracting this from $4,500 gives $4,500 - $900 = $3,600.

2. **Second discount (15%):**  
   - 15% of $3,600 is $540.  
   - Subtracting this from $3,600 gives $3,600 - $540 = $3,060.

3. **Third discount (2½%):**  
   - 2.5% of $3,060 is $76.50.  
   - Subtracting this from $3,060 gives $3,060 - $76.50 = $2,983.50.

Thus, the net amount after all three discounts is $2,983.50. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is **G: $2,983.50**.
