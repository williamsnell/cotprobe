Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the median of a set of numbers. The numbers given are 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. Hmm, let's see... I remember that the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. But wait, how exactly does that work again?

First, I think I need to sort the numbers from smallest to largest. So let me list them out again: 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. Oh right, I should rearrange them. Let me do that step by step. Starting with the smallest, I know 3 is the smallest, then 5 comes next. After that, 8, then 9, and the largest is 12. So the sorted list should be 3, 5, 8, 9, 12.

Now, since there are five numbers, which is an odd count, the median will be the number right in the middle. So in this case, the third number in the sorted list is the median. Let me count them: first is 3, second 5, third 8, fourth 9, fifth 12. So the median is 8.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I sort them correctly? Let me double-check. Original numbers: 5,8,12,3,9. Oh yeah, 3 is the smallest, then 5, then 8, then 9, then 12. So the sorted list is correct.

I think I got this right. So the median is 8. Now looking at the options, option B is 8. So the answer should be B.

The median is found by sorting the numbers and selecting the middle value. Sorting 5, 8, 12, 3, 9 gives 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. With five numbers, the median is the third number, which is 8.

Answer: B
