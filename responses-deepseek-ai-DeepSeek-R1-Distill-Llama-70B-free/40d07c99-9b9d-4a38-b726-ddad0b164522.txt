Okay, so I've got this question about earnings per share, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: What are the earnings per share of a company showing a profit to common shareholders of $4,750, if the company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding. The options are A through J with different dollar amounts.

Hmm, I remember that earnings per share (EPS) is a key metric in finance. From what I've learned, EPS is calculated by taking the net income of the company and dividing it by the number of outstanding shares. That makes sense because it shows how much profit each share gets.

So the formula should be something like EPS = Net Income / Number of Shares. Let me make sure I get that right. Wait, is there anything else I need to consider here? Like preferred dividends or anything? Oh, right, sometimes the net income figure already subtracts preferred dividends, so the profit given is after that. The question mentions "profit to common shareholders," which I think implies that it's the net income available to common stockholders, so we don't need to adjust it further.

In this case, the profit is $4,750, and the number of shares is 1,000. So plugging in the numbers, it's 4750 divided by 1000. Let me do that math. 4750 divided by 1000 is 4.75. So the EPS should be $4.75.

Looking at the options, option D is $4.75. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other factors? Like, sometimes companies have different classes of shares or options that could dilute the EPS, but the question doesn't mention anything about that. It just says 1,000 shares outstanding, so I think that's all I need to consider.

Yes, I'm pretty confident now. The calculation is straightforward: 4750 / 1000 = 4.75. So the correct answer is D.

The earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit available to common shareholders by the number of outstanding shares. Given a profit of $4,750 and 1,000 shares outstanding, the EPS is:

\[
\text{EPS} = \frac{\$4,750}{1,000} = \$4.75
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: $4.75

Answer: D
