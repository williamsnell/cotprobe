Question:

A large man with red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a defendant was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the corrections officer was not present at the scene of the crime.
B: inadmissible, because it is irrelevant to the case.
C: inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.
D: admissible as a character evidence.
E: admissible as a prior identification.
F: admissible, as it is a part of the arresting officer's routine report.
G: admissible, as it is a part of the chain of evidence in the case.
H: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
I: admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.
J: inadmissible, as it is prejudicial against the defendant.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a corrections officer's testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a robbery where the suspect is a large man with red hair. The defendant was arrested and charged. At the trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they saw a large redheaded man commit the robbery. But when the defendant appears at trial, he's shaven-headed, so he doesn't have red hair anymore. The prosecution wants a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was brought to jail. The defense objects, and we need to decide if the testimony is admissible.

Hmm, the key here is understanding what the corrections officer is testifying about and whether that's relevant or admissible. So, the eyewitnesses said the robber had red hair, and the defendant, when arrested, had red hair but now has a shaved head. The prosecution is trying to link the defendant's appearance at the time of arrest to the eyewitness descriptions.

First, I think about relevance. The testimony is about the defendant's hair color when he was arrested, which is directly related to the eyewitness accounts. So it's relevant because it helps connect the defendant to the crime as described by the witnesses.

Next, I consider possible objections. The defense might argue that the testimony is hearsay, but I don't think that's the case here. The corrections officer is testifying about what he personally observedâ€”the defendant's hair color when he was brought in. That's a personal observation, not hearsay.

Looking at the options, option A says it's inadmissible because the officer wasn't at the crime scene. But the officer's testimony isn't about the crime itself, just the defendant's appearance after arrest. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B claims it's irrelevant, but I don't agree because the hair color is a key detail matching the suspect's description.

Option C says it's inadmissible as opinion testimony. No, the officer is stating a fact he observed, not an opinion, so C is out.

Option D is about character evidence, which isn't applicable here. The testimony isn't about the defendant's character, just his appearance.

Option E suggests it's a prior identification. Prior identification usually refers to someone identifying the defendant in a lineup or before trial, not just describing his appearance when arrested. So E might not fit.

Option F talks about it being part of an arresting officer's report. But the question is about a corrections officer, not the arresting one. So maybe F isn't the right choice.

Option G says it's part of the chain of evidence. Chain of custody is more about how evidence is handled, not about a person's appearance. So G doesn't seem to apply.

Option H argues it's hearsay without exception. But as I thought earlier, the officer's testimony is based on personal knowledge, so it's not hearsay. So H is incorrect.

Option I says it's admissible to clarify discrepancies in witnesses' testimony. The eyewitnesses said red hair, and the defendant now has none. The corrections officer's testimony would explain that discrepancy by showing he did have red hair when arrested, supporting the eyewitnesses. That makes sense.

Option J claims it's prejudicial. While any evidence against the defendant could be seen as prejudicial, if it's relevant and admissible, the judge would allow it. So J might not be the best choice.

Putting it all together, the corrections officer's testimony is admissible to clarify why the defendant doesn't have red hair now, supporting the prosecution's case that he's the man with red hair from the robbery. So the correct answer should be I.

The corrections officer's testimony is admissible to clarify the discrepancy between the defendant's current appearance (shaven head) and the eyewitness descriptions of the robber as a large redheaded man. The testimony is based on the officer's personal observation of the defendant's red hair when he was brought to jail, making it relevant and not hearsay. This evidence helps link the defendant to the crime as described by the eyewitnesses. 

The trial judge should rule the corrections officer's testimony admissible for the limited purpose of clarifying this discrepancy.

I

Answer: I
