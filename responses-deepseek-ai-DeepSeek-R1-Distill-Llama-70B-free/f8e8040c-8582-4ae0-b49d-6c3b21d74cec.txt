Alright, so I've got this biology question here about African butterfly species and their color patterns. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which term describes an African butterfly that has two strikingly different color patterns. The options are A through J, each a different evolutionary or selection term.

Hmm, I remember that when a species splits into two different forms based on different traits, it's often due to some kind of selection pressure. But wait, let me break this down.

I think about the types of selection. There's natural selection, but that's a broad term. Then there's directional selection, which is when a population's trait shifts in one direction, like getting taller on average. Stabilizing selection would favor the average, making the population more uniform. Disruptive selection is when extremes are favored, leading to two distinct groups.

Oh, right! So if a butterfly species has two different color patterns, it's likely that disruptive selection is occurring. Because disruptive selection favors both extremes, leading the population to split into two distinct forms. That makes sense because if the environment is such that being very different is advantageous, maybe for camouflage or avoiding predators, then having two color morphs could help survival.

Wait, but what about balanced selection? That's when selection maintains both alleles in a population, like sickle cell anemia. It keeps the heterozygote fit, so the population has a balance. But in this case, it's about the traits being different, not about maintaining both in the same individuals.

Convergent evolution is when different species develop similar traits, which doesn't fit here. Divergent selection might imply the species is diverging, but I'm not sure that's exactly the term used here.

So putting it all together, the answer should be disruptive selection because it leads to two distinct phenotypes in the same population, which fits the two color patterns described.

The African butterfly species described, which exhibits two strikingly different color patterns, is an example of disruptive selection. Disruptive selection occurs when extreme traits are favored over intermediate ones, leading to the formation of distinct groups within a population. This mechanism explains how the butterfly species developed two different color morphs, likely as an adaptation to environmental pressures such as predation or camouflage.
