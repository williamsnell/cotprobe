Question:

Aronson and Mills examined the effects severity of initiation into a group on subsequent attitudes toward the group. Results of their study indicated that, compared to women who underwent a mild initiation, women who underwent a severe initiation as a precondition of group membership:

Options:

A: were more likely to drop out of the group.
B: rated the group as less interesting and enjoyable.
C: felt more alienated within the group.
D: felt more indifferent towards the group.
E: were less likely to contribute to group activities.
F: were more likely to assume leadership roles within the group.
G: were more likely to dislike fellow group members.
H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable.
I: were less likely to recommend the group to others.
J: experienced less satisfaction from group activities.

Okay, so I've got this psychology question here about Aronson and Mills' study on initiation severity and group attitudes. Hmm, I remember learning about this in my social psych class, but I need to think carefully.

So the question is asking what happens when women undergo a severe initiation compared to a mild one. The options are A to J. From what I recall, Aronson and Mills did an experiment where they had women go through different initiations to join a group. The main idea was about cognitive dissonance, right?

Cognitive dissonance is when someone experiences discomfort because of conflicting thoughts or actions. So if someone goes through a tough initiation, which is uncomfortable or painful, they might feel the need to justify that effort. How? By convincing themselves that the group is actually really good. Because if they didn't, they'd feel like they went through all that for nothing, which is dissonant.

So in the study, I think the severe initiation group ended up rating the group more highly. Like, they found the group more interesting and enjoyable. That makes sense because they needed to reduce the dissonance of going through a tough initiation. If the group wasn't that great, why did they suffer? So they change their attitude to match the effort.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one reflects this. Option H says they rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable. That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Option A says they were more likely to drop out. No, I think the opposite. If they went through a tough initiation, they're more committed. So maybe they stay more. Option B is the opposite of H, so that's not it. C says felt more alienated, which doesn't fit because they'd feel more connected. D is indifferent, which also doesn't align. E is less likely to contribute â€” no, they might contribute more if they like the group more. F is about leadership roles; the question doesn't specify that, but maybe not directly related. G says dislike members, which doesn't fit. I and J are negative, so H seems correct.

Wait, another thought: the study might have found that the severe initiation led to more positive attitudes. So H is the right choice.

The study by Aronson and Mills examined how the severity of initiation into a group affects subsequent attitudes toward the group. The results indicated that women who underwent a severe initiation, compared to those who experienced a mild one, were more likely to rate the group as more interesting and enjoyable. This outcome aligns with the concept of cognitive dissonance, where individuals justify the effort or discomfort of a severe initiation by convincing themselves that the group is worthwhile. Among the provided options, the one that correctly reflects this finding is:

H: rated the group as more interesting and enjoyable.

Answer: H
