Okay, so I have this economics question here about the effect of a tax cut on savings and whether it's inflationary or deflationary. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says there's a $10 billion tax cut. I remember that taxes affect disposable income. When the government cuts taxes, people have more money in their pockets. But what's the effect on savings?

Wait, I think it's about the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and how that relates to savings. Oh right, the MPC is the fraction of additional income that people spend rather than save. So if the MPC is 0.85, that means for every extra dollar they get, 85 cents goes into consumption and the remaining 15 cents goes into savings.

But wait, the question asks about the effect on savings. So a tax cut increases disposable income, and thus savings should increase by the amount not consumed. So if the MPC is 0.85, then the marginal propensity to save (MPS) would be 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

So the tax cut is $10 billion. The increase in savings would be MPS multiplied by the tax cut. That would be 0.15 * 10 billion, which is $1.5 billion. So savings increase by $1.5 billion.

But wait, the question also asks whether this is inflationary or deflationary. Let me think. A tax cut increases disposable income, which leads to more consumption. Higher consumption means more demand for goods and services. If demand increases, businesses might increase production, which could lead to inflation if they can't meet demand without raising prices. So this would be inflationary.

Wait, but wait another point. Savings increase by $1.5 billion, which is option A. But looking at the options, A is $1.5 billion. So the effect on savings is a $1.5 billion increase.

Wait, no, hold on. The question is what is the effect on savings of a tax cut. So the correct answer would be an increase in savings by $1.5 billion. So looking at the options, option A is $1.5 billion. But wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:
A: $1.5 billion
B: $8.5 billion
C: $0.85 billion
D: $15 billion
E: $56.67 billion
F: 0.15
G: -$1.5 billion
H: $85 billion
I: $10 billion
J: $5 billion

So the increase in savings is $1.5 billion, which is option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. I might have confused MPS and MPC. Let me make sure. Yes, MPC is 0.85, so MPS is 0.15. So 10 billion times 0.15 is 1.5 billion increase in savings. So the correct effect is an increase of $1.5 billion, making option A the correct answer.

But wait, the second part of the question is whether it's inflationary or deflationary. Oh, right, the question asks what is the effect on savings and whether it's inflationary or deflationary.

Wait, the initial part of the question is "What is the effect on savings of a tax cut of $10 billion? Is this inflationary or deflationary?" So I think the answer they're looking for is the effect on savings, which is the $1.5 billion increase, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is $1.5 billion. So the effect on savings is an increase, and the overall effect on the economy is inflationary because higher consumption leads to higher demand, which can cause inflation.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option A for the savings effect, but the question also asks whether it's inflationary or deflationary. Wait, but the options are all single choice. Wait, no, the question is part of a multiple-choice. Oh, wait, looking again, the question is a single question, and the options are possible answers. So perhaps the options are just the effect on savings.

Wait, the question is: "What is the effect on savings of a tax cut..." So the answer is the amount of change in savings, which is $1.5 billion. So the correct option is A.

But wait, let me double-check my reasoning. The tax cut is 10 billion. People's disposable income increases by 10 billion. They consume 85% of that, so 8.5 billion, and save 15%, which is 1.5 billion. So yes, the saving increases by 1.5 billion. So option A is correct.

But wait, another angle: sometimes, the effect is considering the multiplier effect. Wait, tax cuts can have a multiplier effect on income, but the question is about the effect on savings. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the overall impact on the economy whether it's inflationary or deflationary.

Wait, the initial tax cut is $10 billion. The MPC is 0.85, so the initial consumption increase is 8.5 billion, and then the multiplier effect would lead to additional rounds of spending.

Wait, but that's more about the effect on GDP or income. The question is about the effect on savings, which is 0.15 times the tax cut, so 1.5 billion. So I think that's correct.

So the answer should be A: $1.5 billion. And the effect on the economy is inflationary because increased spending leads to higher demand, potentially causing inflation.

The question asks about the effect on savings of a $10 billion tax cut and whether it is inflationary or deflationary, given a marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of 0.85. 

1. **Effect on Savings**:  
   The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of additional income spent on consumption, while the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction saved. Since MPS = 1 - MPC, MPS = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.  
   A $10 billion tax cut increases disposable income by $10 billion. The increase in savings is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Increase in Savings} = \text{Tax Cut} \times \text{MPS} = 10 \, \text{billion} \times 0.15 = 1.5 \, \text{billion}.
   \]  
   Therefore, savings increase by $1.5 billion.

2. **Inflationary or Deflationary**:  
   A tax cut increases disposable income, leading to higher consumption and demand for goods and services. This increased demand can lead to inflation if businesses cannot meet the higher demand without raising prices. Thus, the effect is inflationary.

3. **Correct Option**:  
   Among the given options, the effect on savings corresponds to **$1.5 billion**, which is option **A**.

**Answer:** A
