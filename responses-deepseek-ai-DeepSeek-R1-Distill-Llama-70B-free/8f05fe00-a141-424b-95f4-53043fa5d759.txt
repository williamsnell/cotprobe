Okay, so I've got this question about atmospheric carbon sources, and I need to figure out which option isn't one. Let's see, the options are A through D: Respiration, Photosynthesis, Bacterial decomposition, and Combustion of fossil fuels.

Hmm, I remember that carbon cycles through the atmosphere in various ways. Let me think about each process.

Respiration is when organisms, like animals and some microbes, break down glucose to produce energy. This process releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So that's a source of atmospheric carbon. So option A is a source.

Photosynthesis, on the other hand, is when plants, algae, and some bacteria take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to produce glucose. This process removes CO2, so it's a sink, not a source. Wait, but the question is about what's NOT a source. So B might be the correct answer because it's a sink, not a source.

Bacterial decomposition: When bacteria break down organic matter, like dead plants or animals, they release CO2 as well. So that's adding carbon to the atmosphere, making it a source. So option C is a source.

Combustion of fossil fuels: Burning coal, oil, and gas releases a lot of CO2. Humans have been doing this a lot, so this definitely adds to atmospheric carbon. So D is a source.

So the question asks which is NOT a source. Photosynthesis takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, so it's the opposite. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The question asks which option is NOT a source of atmospheric carbon. 

- **Respiration (A):** Releases CO₂ into the atmosphere, so it is a source.  
- **Photosynthesis (B):** Removes CO₂ from the atmosphere, making it a sink, not a source.  
- **Bacterial decomposition (C):** Releases CO₂, so it is a source.  
- **Combustion of fossil fuels (D):** Releases CO₂, making it a source.  

Photosynthesis is the only process listed that does not add carbon to the atmosphere; instead, it removes it.  

Answer: B
