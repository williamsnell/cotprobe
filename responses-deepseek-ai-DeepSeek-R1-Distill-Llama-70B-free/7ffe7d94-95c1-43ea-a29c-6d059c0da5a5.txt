Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The President and sole stockholder of a small business negotiated to sell the business to an individual investor. The parties met and signed a "Letter Agreement", which set forth the price, down payment amount, financing terms, the assets to be included, and a host of other pertinent details. The final closing date was not stated, but the purchasers left a down payment of $20,000 with the seller. The letter stated that the terms comprised their essential agreement, but that a formal document would be drafted by the parties' attorneys. Before that happened, the seller returned the check and refused to perform. The investor brought an equity action for specific performance to compel the sale. The equity court ruled that there was a complete and binding contract that must be specifically performed. Will the appellate court likely affirm the lower court's decision?

Options:

A: Yes, because the seller accepted the down payment, indicating acceptance of the agreement.
B: No, because this type of letter is basically a "gentlemen's agreement" that is not intended to be legally binding.
C: No, because the seller has the right to refuse the sale at any time before the final contract is signed.
D: Yes, because a letter of intent is legally binding if it sets forth the price, describes the business and is signed by both parties.
E: No, because the terms of the agreement were not finalized by the parties' attorneys.
F: No, because a letter agreement is not a legally binding document.
G: Yes, because the letter agreement contained all the necessary details for the sale.
H: No, because closing date was left out and the attorneys were supposed to compose the final contract with all of the remaining details put in.
I: Yes, because the buyer left a down payment, signifying their intention to follow through with the purchase.
J: Yes, because where the letter contains all of the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as a contract.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically regarding whether a letter agreement is enforceable. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that the President and sole stockholder of a small business negotiated to sell it to an investor. They signed a "Letter Agreement" that included the price, down payment, financing terms, assets included, and other details. But the closing date wasn't stated. The buyer left a $20k down payment. The letter mentioned that it was their essential agreement but that a formal document would be drafted by their attorneys. Then, the seller returned the check and refused to perform. The buyer sued for specific performance, and the lower court said there was a binding contract. Now, the question is whether the appellate court will affirm that decision.

I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, consideration, mutual intent to be bound, and sufficient definiteness. The letter here seems to outline all the key terms except the closing date. But sometimes, even if some details are left out, as long as the essential terms are there, a contract can exist. 

The fact that the parties intended to have a formal document later doesn't necessarily mean the letter isn't binding. Sometimes, letters of intent can be binding if they show clear intent. Here, the letter says it's their essential agreement, which suggests they intended it to be binding. 

The down payment was left with the seller, and the seller accepted it. That could indicate acceptance of the offer. But wait, the seller later returned the check, but that might be after the fact. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the seller accepted the down payment, showing acceptance. That could be a point, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The key is whether the letter itself is a binding contract.

Option B says no because it's a gentlemen's agreement. But that's more of an informal term, and if the letter is detailed, it's likely intended to be binding.

Option C says no because the seller can refuse before the final contract. But that's only if there's no binding agreement yet. If the letter is a binding contract, then the seller can't just refuse.

Option D says yes because the letter sets forth price, describes the business, and is signed. That sounds plausible, but I think the general rule is that even if it's signed, if it's a letter of intent, it's not always binding unless it's clear.

Option E says no because the attorneys didn't finalize. But the presence of attorneys doesn't negate a contract; if the parties have agreed on essential terms, the contract exists regardless of future formalities.

Option F says no because a letter agreement isn't binding. But that's not necessarily true. Some letters are binding if they meet contract requirements.

Option G says yes because the letter has all necessary details. That seems correct if the essential terms are there, but the closing date was missing. Is that an essential term? Maybe, but sometimes the closing date can be implied or determined later without affecting the contract's validity.

Option H says no because the closing date was left out and more details were to be added. That might be a valid point. If the closing date is a material term, its absence could make the contract unenforceable. But sometimes, such terms can be filled in with reasonable standards.

Option I says yes because of the down payment. Similar to A, but again, the down payment supports acceptance but doesn't by itself make the contract binding if other elements are missing.

Option J says yes because the letter contains all essential terms required for a contract. That sounds like the correct approach because, under the UCC or common law, if the essential terms are agreed upon, even if some details are left for later, the contract is enforceable. The Statute of Frauds might require a writing, but the letter here seems sufficient.

So, putting it together, the key points are whether the letter is sufficiently definite and whether the parties intended to be bound. The letter included essential terms, and the parties acted on it (down payment). The fact that a formal contract was to be drafted later doesn't negate the binding nature if the letter itself is a valid agreement.

I think the appellate court would affirm because the letter had all the essential terms, showing mutual intent, and the parties acted on it. So options G and J are the closest. Option J emphasizes that the letter contains all essential terms, which aligns with contract law principles. So the answer should be J.

The appellate court is likely to affirm the lower court's decision because the letter agreement contained all the essential terms required for a contract, demonstrating the parties' mutual intent to be bound. Although the closing date was omitted, this detail does not necessarily render the agreement unenforceable, as such terms can often be implied or determined later. The letter explicitly stated that it comprised their essential agreement, and the buyer's down payment further evidenced the parties' commitment. The fact that a formal document was to be drafted later does not negate the binding nature of the letter if it meets the requirements of a valid contract. 

Option J correctly captures this reasoning, as it emphasizes that when a letter contains all the essential terms required for a contract, it will be enforced as such.
