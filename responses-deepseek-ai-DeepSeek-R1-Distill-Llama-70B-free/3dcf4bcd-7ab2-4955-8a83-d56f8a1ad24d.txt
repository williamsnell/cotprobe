Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the entropy H(X1, X2, ..., X52) for a shuffled deck of 52 cards, where there are 26 red and 26 black cards. Each Xi represents the color of the ith card. Hmm, I remember that entropy is a measure of uncertainty or information content, right?

Wait, entropy for a single random variable is calculated using the probabilities of each outcome. But here, we're dealing with a sequence of 52 variables, each representing the color of each card. So it's the joint entropy of all these variables together.

I think joint entropy for multiple variables can be calculated by considering how each variable adds to the uncertainty. But wait, in this case, each Xi isn't independent because once you draw a card, it affects the composition of the deck for the next draw. Oh right, because it's without replacement, so the colors are dependent on each other.

So how do I compute the joint entropy H(X1, X2, ..., X52)? Let's think. The joint entropy of multiple variables can sometimes be broken down, but in this case, since each card drawn affects the next, it's probably better to model it as a Markov chain or use the concept of entropy for dependent variables.

Wait, another approach: the entropy of the entire sequence is the same as the entropy of the process of drawing all 52 cards, considering the order. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, I remember that for a shuffled deck with equal numbers of red and black cards, the entropy might relate to the number of possible permutations. Since all sequences are equally likely, perhaps the entropy can be found using the number of possible sequences.

Wait, the deck is shuffled, so every possible ordering of the 52 cards is equally probable. So the number of possible distinct sequences is the number of ways to arrange 26 red and 26 black cards. That's the binomial coefficient C(52,26) = 52!/(26!26!).

But wait, the entropy H is the logarithm (base 2) of the number of possible outcomes, right? Because entropy in bits is log2(N), where N is the number of possible equally likely outcomes.

So H = log2(C(52,26)) bits. Because each outcome is equally probable, and there are C(52,26) possible sequences.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the entropy for a uniform distribution over N outcomes is log2(N) bits. So yes, that's correct.

So I need to compute log2(52!/(26!26!)).

Hmm, calculating that exactly might be tricky, but maybe there's an approximation or a known value. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the entropy of a binomial distribution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe Stirling's approximation can help here. Stirling's formula approximates n! as sqrt(2πn)(n/e)^n. So maybe I can approximate 52! and the 26! terms.

Let's try that. So,

log2(52!/(26!26!)) = log2(52!) - 2*log2(26!).

Using Stirling's approximation:

n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n.

Taking log base 2:

log2(n!) ≈ log2( sqrt(2πn) ) + n log2(n/e )

Which is log2( sqrt(2πn) ) + n (log2(n) - log2(e)).

Since log2(e) is approximately 1.4427.

So compute each term:

First, compute log2(52!) using Stirling:

sqrt(2π*52) = sqrt(104π) ≈ sqrt(326.795) ≈ 18.08. So log2(18.08) ≈ ln(18.08)/ln(2) ≈ 2.894 / 0.693 ≈ 4.176 bits.

Then the second term: 52*(log2(52) - 1.4427).

log2(52) is about 5.7004 (since 2^5=32, 2^6=64, so 52 is between 5 and 6. Let me compute it more accurately: 2^5.7 is about 52? Let's see, 2^5=32, 2^5.7 = 32 * 2^0.7 ≈ 32 * 1.6245 ≈ 52. So yes, log2(52)=5.7004.

So 52*(5.7004 - 1.4427) = 52*(4.2577) ≈ 52*4.2577 ≈ 221.401.

Wait, but wait, the formula is in natural logs? Or am I mixing up? No, the formula is for natural logs, but we're converting to bits. Wait, Stirling's formula is for natural logs, so when I take log2(n!), I have to account for that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in natural logs first and then convert to bits.

Wait, let me clarify. Stirling's approximation is for ln(n!) ≈ n ln n - n + (1/2) ln(2πn).

So, ln(52!) ≈ 52 ln 52 - 52 + 0.5 ln(2π*52).

Similarly for ln(26!).

So, let's compute ln(52!) - 2 ln(26!) using Stirling.

Compute A = ln(52!) = 52 ln52 -52 + 0.5 ln(104π)
Compute B = 2 ln(26!) = 2[26 ln26 -26 + 0.5 ln(52π)]

So A - B = [52 ln52 -52 + 0.5 ln(104π)] - 2[26 ln26 -26 + 0.5 ln(52π)].

Let me compute each term:

52 ln52 = 52*3.9512 ≈ 52*3.9512 ≈ 205.5624
-52 → -52
0.5 ln(104π) ≈ 0.5 * ln(326.795) ≈ 0.5 * 5.783 ≈ 2.8915.

For the B term:
2[26 ln26] = 2*(26*3.2581) ≈ 2*(84.71) ≈ 169.42
2*(-26) = -52
2*(0.5 ln(52π)) = ln(52π) ≈ ln(163.362) ≈ 5.091.

So putting it all together:

A = 205.5624 -52 + 2.8915 ≈ 205.5624 -52 is 153.5624 +2.8915 ≈ 156.4539.

B = 169.42 -52 +5.091 ≈ 169.42 -52 is 117.42 +5.091 ≈ 122.511.

So A - B = 156.4539 - 122.511 = 33.9429 in natural logs.

So ln(N) ≈ 33.9429 → N ≈ e^33.9429. But we need log2(N) = (ln N)/ln 2 ≈ 33.9429 / 0.6931 ≈ 48.96 bits.

Wait, that's approximately 49 bits. Looking at the options, option I is 48.8, which is close. But perhaps I made some approximation errors.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recompute A and B.

Compute A = 52 ln52 -52 + 0.5 ln(104π)
Compute B = 2*(26 ln26 -26 + 0.5 ln(52π)).

Compute 52 ln52: 52 * ln(52) = 52 * 3.9512 ≈ 52*3.9512.

3.9512 * 50 = 197.56, 3.9512 * 2 = 7.9024 → total ≈ 205.4624.

-52 → so 205.4624 -52 = 153.4624.

0.5 ln(104π): 104 * π ≈ 326.795; ln(326.795) ≈ 5.783 → 0.5 *5.783≈2.8915.

So A ≈153.4624 + 2.8915≈156.3539.

Now B:

2*(26 ln26) = 2*(26 *3.2581) = 2*(84.7106) = 169.4212.

2*(-26) = -52.

2*(0.5 ln(52π)) = ln(52π) ≈ ln(163.362) ≈5.091.

So B =169.4212 -52 +5.091 = (169.4212 -52)=117.4212 +5.091=122.5122.

So A - B =156.3539 -122.5122=33.8417.

So ln(N)=33.8417 → log2(N)=33.8417 / ln(2) ≈33.8417 /0.693147≈48.84 bits.

So approximately 48.84, which is closest to option I:48.8.

But wait, the options are:

A:53.2, B:50.2, C:47.3, D:46.5, E:51.5, F:50.0, G:49.9, H:45.6, I:48.8, J:52.

So the answer should be I:48.8.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the entropy H(X1,...X52) is the same as the entropy of the entire deck, which is log2(C(52,26)).

But wait, another way to think about it: when you have a deck with n red and n black cards, the entropy of the entire sequence is n H(1/2) + ... wait, no, that's for independent events. Since draws are dependent, maybe the entropy is different.

Wait, but earlier approach said it's log2(C(52,26)), which we computed as about 48.84, matching option I.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the entropy of the entire permutation. For a deck of 52 unique cards, the entropy would be log2(52!) ≈ 223 bits. But since the cards are not unique, only the colors matter, and we have 26 of each, the entropy is log2(C(52,26)).

But wait, the problem states that each Xi is the color of the ith card. So the outcome is a binary sequence of 52 bits, but with exactly 26 ones and 26 zeros. So the number of possible sequences is C(52,26), and each is equally likely.

Thus, the entropy is log2(C(52,26)) ≈48.84 bits, which is option I.

So the correct answer is I:48.8.

To compute the entropy \( H(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{52}) \) for a shuffled deck of 52 cards with 26 red and 26 black cards, we note that each \( X_i \) represents the color of the \( i \)-th card. The entropy of the entire sequence is equivalent to the entropy of the joint distribution of all 52 variables.

Since the deck is shuffled uniformly at random, all possible sequences of 26 red and 26 black cards are equally likely. The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{52}{26} = \frac{52!}{26!26!}.
\]

The entropy \( H \) for a uniform distribution over \( N \) outcomes is given by:

\[
H = \log_2(N),
\]

where \( N \) is the number of possible outcomes. Here, \( N = \binom{52}{26} \), so:

\[
H = \log_2\left(\binom{52}{26}\right).
\]

Using Stirling's approximation for factorials, \( n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n \), we approximate \( \log_2(52!) \) and \( \log_2(26!) \). After simplifying:

\[
\log_2\left(\binom{52}{26}\right) \approx 48.84 \, \text{bits}.
\]

This matches the closest option, \( \mathbf{I: 48.8} \).

Thus, the entropy \( H(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{52}) \) is approximately **48.8 bits**.
