Alright, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about CPI and MMPI. Let me start by recalling what I know about these two assessments.

I remember that CPI stands for California Psychological Inventory. I think it's a personality test, but I'm not exactly sure how it's different from the MMPI. MMPI is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. I believe MMPI is used more in clinical settings to assess personality traits and detect psychopathology.

Wait, so the question is asking what each is and how they differ. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option.

Option A says CPI is a variant of MMPI, but I don't think that's right. They are separate tests, not versions of each other.

Option B claims CPI is a tool for diagnosing mental illnesses, which doesn't sound right. I think CPI is more about normal personality traits rather than diagnosing illnesses.

Option C says CPI is cognitive, while MMPI assesses personality. That doesn't fit because I think both are personality assessments, not cognitive.

Option D mentions CPI being projective and MMPI objective. Wait, projective tests are like Rorschach, where you interpret ambiguous stimuli. Objective tests use standardized questions. So CPI and MMPI are both objective, so D is incorrect.

Option E suggests CPI is for education and MMPI for clinical. Maybe that's possible. I think CPI is used in employment or educational settings to assess personality traits, whereas MMPI is more clinical.

Option F says CPI measures inflation, which doesn't make sense. I know CPI is a personality test, not related to economics. So F is wrong.

Option G states that CPI is an objective inventory for less clinical groups than MMPI. That sounds familiar. I think MMPI was developed for clinical populations, like those with psychopathology, while CPI is for the general population, assessing normal traits.

Option H says CPI measures psychopathy, but I'm not sure. I think MMPI has scales related to psychopathy, like the Pd scale.

Option I says they're the same, which is wrong. They're different tests.

Option J says CPI is a newer version with updated scales. I don't think so; MMPI has had revisions, but CPI is a separate test.

So putting it together, G seems correct: CPI is an objective personality inventory used with less clinically deviant groups than MMPI.

The correct answer is G. The California Psychological Inventory (CPI) is an objective personality inventory designed for use with less clinically deviant populations compared to the MMPI, which is more focused on clinical settings and assessing psychopathology.
