Okay, I need to figure out which of these statements about economic profits and costs is correct. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll try to think through each option step by step.

First, I remember that in economics, there are different terms like explicit costs, implicit costs, accounting profits, economic profits, and opportunity costs. Let me start by recalling what each of these means.

Explicit costs are the direct, out-of-pocket expenses a firm pays, such as wages, rent, and materials. These are the costs that appear on a firm's financial statements. On the other hand, implicit costs are the opportunity costs of using resources that the firm already owns, like the salary a business owner could have earned if they worked elsewhere instead of running their own firm. So implicit costs are not directly observable but are real costs in economic terms.

Accounting profit is calculated as total revenue minus explicit costs. It's the profit that businesses usually report. Economic profit, however, is a bit different. It's calculated as total revenue minus both explicit and implicit costs. So economic profit takes into account all the opportunity costs, not just the explicit ones. If economic profit is positive, it means the firm is earning more than the average return in the industry.

Opportunity cost refers to the value of the next best alternative that is given up when a choice is made. It's a key concept in economics because it acknowledges that every decision has a cost, even if it's not a direct, out-of-pocket expense.

Now, let's look at each option:

Option A: Economic Profits = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.
Wait, no. Economic profit is revenue minus both explicit and implicit costs. So this would be subtracting, not adding. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Opportunity Costs = Economic Profits.
Hmm, I don't think so. Opportunity costs are the costs of alternatives, while economic profits are the overall measure of profit accounting for all costs. They might be related, but they're not equal. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Accounting Profits = Explicit Costs minus Implicit Costs.
No, that's not right. Accounting profit is revenue minus explicit costs. Implicit costs are subtracted when calculating economic profit, not accounting profit. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Economic Costs = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.
Yes, this rings a bell. Economic costs include all the costs, both explicit and implicit. So D seems correct. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option E: Economic Costs = Explicit Costs minus Implicit Costs.
No, that would be subtracting implicit costs, which doesn't make sense. So E is wrong.

Option F: Economic Profits = Accounting Profits.
No, because accounting profits don't subtract implicit costs. Economic profits do. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Implicit Costs = Economic Profits minus Opportunity Costs.
I'm not sure about this one. Wait, opportunity cost is more of a concept, not a direct subtraction. I don't think this is correct. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Economic Costs = Accounting Profits minus Opportunity Costs.
Hmm, not sure. Economic costs are explicit plus implicit. Accounting profits are revenue minus explicit. So if you subtract opportunity costs, that might not directly give you economic costs. It's a bit confusing, so I'll put H aside for now.

Option I: Opportunity Costs = Explicit Costs minus Implicit Costs.
No, that doesn't make sense. Opportunity costs are about alternatives, not a subtraction of implicit from explicit. So I is wrong.

Option J: Economic Profits = Opportunity Costs plus Implicit Costs.
Wait, economic profit is revenue minus all costs (explicit and implicit). Opportunity costs are part of the implicit costs. So adding opportunity costs and implicit might not be the right approach. I think J is incorrect.

So, going back, the only option that makes sense is D: Economic Costs equal Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs. That aligns with what I remember about economic costs encompassing all expenses, both direct and opportunity-based.

The correct statement is:

**D: Economic Costs = Explicit Costs plus Implicit Costs.**

Economic costs include all expenses incurred by a firm, both the direct, out-of-pocket expenses (explicit costs) and the opportunity costs of using resources the firm already owns (implicit costs). This definition aligns with the economic concept of costs, which accounts for all sacrifices made in production, whether directly observable or not.

Answer: D
