Okay, so I've got this question here about which food is the cheapest and most nutritious in terms of price per calorie. Hmm, let's think this through. The options are A through J, each a different food item. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about the price per calorie, so the cheapest option would be the one that gives the most calories for the least money. But it also has to be the most nutritious, so it's a balance between cost-effectiveness and nutritional value.

Let me list out the options again to get a clear picture:

A: Bag of chips
B: Chicken breast
C: Banana
D: Slice of bread
E: Pasta
F: Slice of pizza
G: Apple
H: Broccoli
I: Can of soda
J: Cheese burger

Alright, I should probably evaluate each option based on two factors: cost per calorie and nutritional value.

Starting with A: Bag of chips. Chips are usually cheap, right? But are they nutritious? I think they're high in calories but low in nutrients. They have a lot of fats and sodium, not much in terms of vitamins or fiber. So maybe they are cheap per calorie, but not very nutritious.

B: Chicken breast. Chicken breast is a good source of protein and is considered healthy. But it's also more expensive compared to some other options. I think it's not the cheapest per calorie since proteins, especially lean ones like chicken, can be pricier.

C: Banana. Bananas are pretty affordable. They're a good source of potassium and some vitamins. They have a decent amount of calories, mostly from carbs. So they might be a good value, but I'm not sure how they compare to others in terms of cost per calorie.

D: Slice of bread. Bread is inexpensive. A loaf can have many slices and is usually cheap. Each slice doesn't have a lot of calories, maybe around 80-100. But in terms of nutrients, it's mostly carbs, some fiber if it's whole grain, but not a lot of vitamins or minerals. So it's cheap but not very nutritious.

E: Pasta. Pasta is another carb-heavy food. It's usually inexpensive, especially if you buy it in bulk. Cooked pasta has a good number of calories, so the price per calorie might be low. It does provide some B vitamins, especially if it's enriched, but it's not packed with nutrients like vegetables or proteins.

F: Slice of pizza. Pizza can vary in price, but a slice from a place is probably more expensive than making it at home. It has a mix of carbs, some protein from cheese, and maybe some veggies. But it's also high in calories and not the healthiest option. So maybe not the cheapest per calorie, and not the most nutritious either.

G: Apple. Apples are relatively cheap, especially when in season. They provide fiber and some vitamins. They're lower in calories compared to other options, so the price per calorie might be higher. They're healthy, but maybe not the best in terms of cost-effectiveness for calories.

H: Broccoli. Broccoli is a superfood, packed with vitamins and fiber. But it's also lower in calories. The problem is that it's more expensive than some other veggies, I think. So while it's nutritious, it might not be the cheapest per calorie.

I: Can of soda. Soda is cheap, but it's basically empty caloriesâ€”lots of sugar without any nutritional value. So while it's cheap per calorie, it's not nutritious at all.

J: Cheese burger. Burgers can vary in price, but they're generally more expensive than some other options. They provide a mix of carbs, protein, and fats, but they're also high in calories and not very healthy. So probably not the best in either category.

Now, thinking about which of these offers the best balance. We're looking for something that's both cheap and nutritious.

Bananas (C) and apples (G) are both fruits, healthy but maybe not the cheapest per calorie because they don't have as many calories. Bread (D) is cheap but not nutritious. Pasta (E) is a good candidate because it's inexpensive and has a decent number of calories, making the price per calorie low. It also has some B vitamins, which adds to its nutritional value.

Comparing pasta to other options like rice or bread, pasta is often similar in price and calorie content. Chicken breast is more expensive, so it's out. Bag of chips is cheaper but less nutritious. So I think pasta (E) might be the best option here because it's affordable, provides a good number of calories, and has some nutritional benefits.

In terms of price per calorie and nutritional value, pasta (E) emerges as the most cost-effective and nutritious option. It is inexpensive, provides a significant number of calories, and offers some nutritional benefits like B vitamins from enriched varieties. Other options, while potentially cheaper or more nutritious individually, do not balance both factors as effectively as pasta.
