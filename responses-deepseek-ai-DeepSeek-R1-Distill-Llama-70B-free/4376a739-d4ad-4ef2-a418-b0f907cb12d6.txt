Question:

A participant in a single-trial free-recall task is presented with a list of words, one at a time, in the following order: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad. In accord with the serial position curve, which of the following words is the participant most likely to forget?

Options:

A: Salad
B: Computer
C: The last word presented
D: Dog
E: The word presented in the middle of the list
F: House
G: Water
H: Flower
I: License
J: Table

Okay, so I've got this question about the serial position curve in a free-recall task. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that the serial position effect has to do with how well people remember items based on their position in a list. Let me think through this.

So the question says that a participant is presented with a list of eight words in a specific order: house, flower, dog, table, license, water, computer, salad. The task is to recall them in order, I think. The options are about which word is most likely to be forgotten.

Wait, the serial position curve typically shows that the first few items (the primacy effect) and the last few items (the recency effect) are remembered better than the ones in the middle. So the middle items are harder to recall because they don't benefit as much from either effect. That makes sense because the first items get more rehearsal since there's nothing before them, and the last items are still fresh in memory.

So the list here has eight words. Let me count them: 1. house, 2. flower, 3. dog, 4. table, 5. license, 6. water, 7. computer, 8. salad. So the middle would be around the fourth and fifth positions. Because with an even number of items, the middle isn't a single item. So positions 4 and 5 are in the middle.

Looking at the options, option E says "the word presented in the middle of the list." That would be either the fourth or fifth word. The fourth word is table, and the fifth is license. Wait, but the options don't provide both; E is about the middle, not specific words. The question is asking which word is most likely forgotten, so the one in the middle.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option C says "the last word presented," which would be salad, option A. But according to the recency effect, the last items are usually better remembered. So that's probably not the answer.

Option F is house, which is the first word. Primacy effect says it's more likely to be remembered, so probably not forgotten.

Options D is dog (third word), H is flower (second word), G is water (sixth), I is license (fifth), J is table (fourth), and B is computer (seventh). The seventh is near the end, so likely to be remembered because of recency.

So the middle is around 4 and 5. The options are E (the middle), which would include table and license. So the participant is most likely to forget a word in the middle, which is either table or license. But the question is which word is most likely forgotten, so perhaps the exact middle. Since it's an eight-word list, the middle is between 4 and 5, so the fourth and fifth positions.

Looking at the options, E says the word in the middle, which would be either table or license. Now, the options don't have E as a specific word, but as a description. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the serial position curve is more about the relative positions. The first and last are better recalled, and the middle is the worst. So the words in the middle of the list are more likely to be forgotten.

So the question is which word is most likely to be forgotten. Among the options, E is about the middle position, which is the most likely to be forgotten. So the answer should be E.

The serial position curve describes how items presented at the beginning (primacy effect) and end (recency effect) of a list are typically better remembered than those in the middle. In this case, the list has eight words, and the middle positions are the fourth and fifth words: "table" and "license." These middle items are less likely to be remembered due to the absence of both primacy and recency effects. Among the options provided, "the word presented in the middle of the list" (Option E) corresponds to the most likely forgotten word.

Answer: E
