Okay, so I have this statistics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding a probability related to the sample mean of maximal oxygen intake. Alright, I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that X is the maximal oxygen intake, measured in ml per minute per kg. The population mean μ is 54.030, and the standard deviation σ is 5.8. We're taking a random sample of size n=47, and we need to find the probability that the sample mean X̄ is between 52.761 and 54.453. So, P(52.761 ≤ X̄ ≤ 54.453).

I remember that when dealing with sample means, especially for large samples, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) applies. The CLT says that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large. Here, n=47, which is pretty decent, so I think it's safe to use the CLT.

So the distribution of X̄ should be approximately normal with mean μ_X̄ = μ = 54.030 and standard deviation σ_X̄ = σ / sqrt(n). Let me calculate that standard deviation first.

σ is 5.8, and n is 47. So sqrt(47) is approximately... let me think. 6^2 is 36, 7^2 is 49. So sqrt(47) is just under 7, maybe around 6.8557. Let me confirm: 6.8557^2 is about 47. So yes.

So σ_X̄ = 5.8 / 6.8557 ≈ let's compute that. 5.8 divided by 6.8557. Let me do the division. 6.8557 goes into 5.8 about 0.85 times, maybe? Hmm, wait: 6.8557 * 0.85 = 5.827... which is a bit higher than 5.8. So maybe around 0.846?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let's see: 5.8 ÷ 6.8557.

Let me compute 5.8 / 6.8557. Let me see:

6.8557 * 0.8 = 5.4846
6.8557 * 0.84 = 6.8557*0.8 + 6.8557*0.04 = 5.4846 + 0.2742 = 5.7588
That's 0.84 gives 5.7588, which is less than 5.8.

The difference between 5.7588 and 5.8 is 0.0412. So how much more do I need? So each 0.01 adds 0.068557 to the product (since 6.8557 *0.01=0.068557). So 0.0412 / 0.068557 ≈ 0.6. So approximately 0.846.

So σ_X̄ ≈ 0.846.

Wait, perhaps a calculator approach would be better, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed with the approximate value of 0.845.

Now, the next step is to find the probability that X̄ is between 52.761 and 54.453. Since X̄ follows a normal distribution, I can convert these values into Z-scores and use the standard normal distribution table.

The Z-score formula is Z = (X̄ - μ) / (σ_X̄)

So first, let's compute the Z for the lower bound, 52.761.

Z1 = (52.761 - 54.030) / 0.845 ≈ (-1.269) / 0.845 ≈ let's calculate that.

Divide 1.269 by 0.845. 0.845 * 1.5 is 1.2675, which is very close to 1.269. So Z1 ≈ -1.5.

Wait, wait, 0.845 * 1.5 = 1.2675. So 1.269 is just a bit more, so maybe Z1 ≈ -1.501 or so. But for approximation purposes, maybe we can take it as -1.5.

Now the upper bound is 54.453. So let's compute Z2.

Z2 = (54.453 - 54.030) / 0.845 ≈ 0.423 / 0.845.

Calculate 0.423 / 0.845.

Well, 0.423 ÷ 0.845. Let me think. 0.845 goes into 0.423 about 0.5 times because 0.845 * 0.5 = 0.4225, which is very close to 0.423. So Z2 ≈ 0.5.

So now, I need to find P(-1.5 ≤ Z ≤ 0.5) in the standard normal distribution.

I can look up the Z-scores in the Z-table. Let's recall that the standard normal table gives the probability that Z is less than or equal to a certain value.

So P(Z ≤ 0.5) is the area to the left of 0.5, and P(Z ≤ -1.5) is the area to the left of -1.5. The desired probability is the difference between these two.

Looking up Z=0.5: The standard normal table for Z=0.5 gives approximately 0.6915. For Z=-1.5, it's about 0.0668.

So P(-1.5 ≤ Z ≤ 0.5) = P(Z ≤ 0.5) - P(Z ≤ -1.5) = 0.6915 - 0.0668 = 0.6247.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 0.7021

B: 0.5462

C: 0.6247

D: 0.5000

E: 0.9456

F: 0.4835

G: 0.7753

H: 0.2589

I: 0.8118

J: 0.3764

So option C is 0.6247, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check my Z-scores because I approximated them. Maybe I should be more precise. Let me recalculate the Z-scores more accurately.

First, let me compute σ_X̄ exactly. σ is 5.8, n=47.

σ_X̄ = 5.8 / sqrt(47) = 5.8 / 6.8557 ≈ let's compute this more precisely.

Let me compute 5.8 ÷ 6.8557.

Divide 5.8 by 6.8557:

6.8557 × 0.846 = ?

Let me compute 6.8557 × 0.8 = 5.4846

6.8557 × 0.04 = 0.274228

6.8557 × 0.006 = 0.0411542

Adding those together: 5.4846 + 0.274228 = 5.758828 + 0.0411542 ≈ 5.79998. So 0.846 gives approximately 5.8, which is exactly our numerator. So σ_X̄ is approximately 0.846.

So the standard deviation of X̄ is 0.846.

Now, Z1 is (52.761 - 54.030) / 0.846.

52.761 - 54.030 = -1.269.

So Z1 = -1.269 / 0.846 ≈ let's compute this division accurately.

1.269 ÷ 0.846.

Let me compute 0.846 × 1.5 = 1.269, exactly. So Z1 is exactly -1.5. Nice, that's a clean number.

Now Z2 is (54.453 - 54.030) / 0.846 = 0.423 / 0.846.

Compute 0.423 ÷ 0.846. Let me see: 0.423 is exactly half of 0.846. So 0.423 / 0.846 = 0.5. So Z2 is exactly 0.5.

So the Z-scores are Z1 = -1.5 and Z2 = 0.5.

Now, let's look up these Z-values in the standard normal distribution table.

For Z = 0.5: The table gives the cumulative probability up to 0.5. The standard value is 0.6915.

For Z = -1.5: The cumulative probability is 0.0668.

So the area between -1.5 and 0.5 is 0.6915 - 0.0668 = 0.6247.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.6247, which matches exactly.

So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that the distribution of the sample mean \(\bar{X}\) is approximately normal for large sample sizes. Here, the sample size \(n = 47\), so the CLT applies. The mean of \(\bar{X}\) is \(\mu_{\bar{X}} = \mu = 54.030\), and its standard deviation is \(\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sigma / \sqrt{n} = 5.8 / \sqrt{47}\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\sigma_{\bar{X}}\)
\[
\sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{5.8}{\sqrt{47}} \approx \frac{5.8}{6.8557} \approx 0.846
\]

### Step 2: Convert the bounds to Z-scores
The Z-score formula is:
\[
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}}
\]

For the lower bound (\(\bar{X} = 52.761\)):
\[
Z_1 = \frac{52.761 - 54.030}{0.846} = \frac{-1.269}{0.846} \approx -1.5
\]

For the upper bound (\(\bar{X} = 54.453\)):
\[
Z_2 = \frac{54.453 - 54.030}{0.846} = \frac{0.423}{0.846} \approx 0.5
\]

### Step 3: Find the probability
Using the standard normal distribution table:
- \(P(Z \leq 0.5) = 0.6915\)
- \(P(Z \leq -1.5) = 0.0668\)

The probability that \(\bar{X}\) lies between 52.761 and 54.453 is:
\[
P(52.761 \leq \bar{X} \leq 54.453) = P(-1.5 \leq Z \leq 0.5) = P(Z \leq 0.5) - P(Z \leq -1.5) = 0.6915 - 0.0668 = 0.6247
\]

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **C: 0.6247**.
