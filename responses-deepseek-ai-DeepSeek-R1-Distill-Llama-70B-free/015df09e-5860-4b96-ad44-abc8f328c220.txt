Question:

An Insect class is to be written, containing the following data fields: age, which will be initialized to 0 when an Insect is constructed. nextAvailableID, which will be initialized to 0 outside the constructor and incremented each time an Insect is constructed. idNum, which will be initialized to the current value of nextAvailableID when an Insect is constructed. position, which will be initialized to the location in a garden where the Insect is placed when it is constructed. direction, which will be initialized to the direction the Insect is facing when placed in the garden. Which variable in the Insect class should be static?

Options:

A: position and direction
B: age and idNum
C: All of them
D: idNum
E: nextAvailableID and position
F: None of them
G: direction
H: position
I: age
J: nextAvailableID

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the Insect class and which variables should be static. I remember that static variables are shared by all instances of a class, meaning they have the same value across all objects created from that class. 

The question gives four data fields in the Insect class: age, nextAvailableID, idNum, position, and direction. I need to determine which of these should be static.

First, I'll go through each variable one by one.

1. **Age**: The age is initialized to 0 when an Insect is constructed. Each insect probably has its own age, like a real insect's age. So age doesn't need to be static; each instance should have its own value.

2. **NextAvailableID**: This is initialized to 0 outside the constructor. Every time a new Insect is made, this variable is incremented. Oh, right, because each new insect should get a unique idNum. So nextAvailableID must be a static variable because it's tracking the count across all instances. If it's non-static, each insect would have its own nextAvailableID, which wouldn't work because they'd all start at 0 and not increment properly.

3. **IdNum**: This is set to the current value of nextAvailableID when an Insect is constructed. Each insect has its own unique id, so this should be an instance variable, not static. Because each instance needs its own idNum.

4. **Position**: This is where the insect is placed in the garden. Each insect's position is different, so this should be an instance variable. Static doesn't make sense here.

5. **Direction**: Similar to position, each insect faces a certain direction. So each instance should have its own direction, making it an instance variable.

So the only variable that needs to be static is nextAvailableID. Looking at the options, option J is nextAvailableID. So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks which variable in the Insect class should be static. Static variables are shared across all instances of a class. 

- **Age** is instance-specific, as each insect has its own age.  
- **NextAvailableID** is initialized outside the constructor and increments each time a new Insect is created. This must be static to ensure it tracks the same value across all instances.  
- **IdNum** is unique to each insect, so it should be an instance variable.  
- **Position** and **Direction** are specific to each insect, so they are instance variables.  

Only **nextAvailableID** should be static.  

Answer: J
