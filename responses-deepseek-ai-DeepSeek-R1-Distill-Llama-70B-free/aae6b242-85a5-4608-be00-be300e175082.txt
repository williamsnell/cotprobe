Question:

Light from a laser falls on a pair of very narrow slits separated by 0.5 micrometer, and bright fringes separated by 1.0 millimeter are observed on a distant screen. If the frequency of the laser light is doubled, what will be the separation of the bright fringes?

Options:

A: 0.25 mm
B: 0.75 mm
C: 3.0 mm
D: No change in the separation of bright fringes
E: 0.5 mm
F: 2.5 mm
G: 1.25 mm
H: 1.5 mm
I: 1.0 mm
J: 2.0 mm

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the diffraction of light through double slits. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through two slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen. The bright fringes are the regions where the waves constructively interfere.

The problem says the slits are separated by 0.5 micrometers. Oh wait, micrometers are 1e-6 meters. So d = 0.5e-6 meters. The bright fringes are separated by 1.0 millimeters, which is 1e-3 meters. The screen is distant, so I think the far field approximation holds, meaning we can use the formula for the fringe separation.

The formula I remember is the fringe separation beta is given by (lambda * D) / d, where lambda is the wavelength, D is the distance to the screen, and d is the slit separation. So beta = (lambda D)/d.

The question says the frequency of the laser is doubled. Oh, right, frequency and wavelength are inversely related because c = lambda * f. So if the frequency doubles, the wavelength halves. Because lambda1 = c/f1, and lambda2 = c/(2f1) = lambda1/2.

So initially, beta_initial = (lambda_initial * D)/d. After the frequency is doubled, the new wavelength is lambda2 = lambda_initial/2. So the new beta would be beta_new = (lambda2 * D)/d = (lambda_initial/2 * D)/d.

Wait, that would make beta_new = beta_initial /2. Because beta_initial is (lambda D)/d, so dividing by 2.

But wait, the initial beta_initial is given as 1.0 mm. So the new separation should be 0.5 mm. Let me check the options. Option E is 0.5 mm. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up which variable is changing. The problem doesn't change the slit separation or the screen distance. So if wavelength changes, beta changes inversely. So yes, the separation should decrease by half.

So the answer should be E: 0.5 mm.

The problem involves a double-slit interference setup where the separation between the slits is \( d = 0.5 \, \mu\text{m} \), and the bright fringe separation is initially \( \beta_{\text{initial}} = 1.0 \, \text{mm} \). The formula for fringe separation is:

\[
\beta = \frac{\lambda D}{d}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light, \( D \) is the distance to the screen, and \( d \) is the slit separation. When the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the wavelength is halved because \( \lambda \propto 1/f \). Thus, the new wavelength is \( \lambda_{\text{new}} = \lambda_{\text{initial}} / 2 \).

Substituting into the formula for fringe separation, the new fringe separation becomes:

\[
\beta_{\text{new}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{new}} D}{d} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{initial}} / 2 \cdot D}{d} = \frac{\beta_{\text{initial}}}{2}
\]

Since \( \beta_{\text{initial}} = 1.0 \, \text{mm} \), the new fringe separation is:

\[
\beta_{\text{new}} = \frac{1.0 \, \text{mm}}{2} = 0.5 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the separation of the bright fringes decreases by half when the frequency of the laser light is doubled. The correct answer is:

E: 0.5 mm
