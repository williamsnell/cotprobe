Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with a defendant charged with first-degree murder and their right to a list of prospective jurors. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer here.

The question is asking about when the defendant should be furnished with such a list. The options are A through J, each giving a different condition.

I remember that in the US, there are certain rights provided to defendants, especially in serious cases like first-degree murder. I think the right to know who the jurors are is part of ensuring a fair trial, maybe related to challenges or knowing if there's any bias.

Wait, I think it's something about the defendant having the right to the list upon request. But when exactly? I recall that in some cases, the court has to provide this information, but I'm not sure if it's automatic or requires some showing.

Let me think about the rules. In federal courts, I believe that under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, specifically Rule 24, which deals with the jury. Rule 24(b) says that after the jury is sworn, the court must give the attorney for each defendant a copy of the jury list. But wait, this might be after voir dire or when the jury is selected.

Wait, but the question is about prospective jurors before selection. I'm a bit confused. Another thought: in some states, the defendant has a right to the list of prospective jurors, but maybe it's upon request. Or perhaps it's only under certain circumstances.

I think in some cases, the court might require a showing of good cause before releasing the list. So maybe the defendant can't just get it automatically but has to show why it's needed for their defense.

Looking at the options, option C says "upon request and showing of good cause," which sounds like that. Option H is "upon request," so no showing needed. Which one is it?

I remember a Supreme Court case, maybe Turner v. Louisiana, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in some jurisdictions, the defendant can get the list without any showing, but I think generally, it's not an automatic right except in certain circumstances.

Wait, another angle: in capital cases, which first-degree murder often is, the procedures are more stringent. So perhaps the defendant is entitled to more information. But does that include the juror list automatically?

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the options again. Option C is upon request and showing good cause. Option H is upon request without any cause. Which is correct?

I think the rule is that the defendant doesn't automatically get the list but can request it and must show why it's necessary. So the court would order it if good cause is shown. Therefore, option C would be correct.

Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with other discovery rules. For example, in some states, the prosecution must provide certain information, but for the defense to get the juror list, they might need to ask and justify it.

So, considering all that, the correct answer should be option C: upon request and showing of good cause.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that a defendant charged with first-degree murder does not automatically receive a list of prospective jurors. Instead, they must request the list and demonstrate good cause for why it is necessary for their defense. This aligns with the principle that such information is not unconditionally provided but may be granted upon a showing of legitimate need.

Answer: C
