Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the molarity of a sulfuric acid solution. Hmm. I remember molarity is moles per liter, right? So I need to figure out how many moles of H2SO4 I have and then divide that by the volume in liters.

Wait, the problem says there's 10.0 grams of sulfuric acid in 500 ml of solution. Oh, right, so first I should find the number of moles. To do that, I need the molar mass. The problem gives that as 98.1 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass.

Let me calculate that. 10.0 grams divided by 98.1 g/mol. Let me see, 10 divided by 98 is roughly 0.102. But wait, 98.1 is a bit more than 98, so maybe a little less than 0.102. Oh wait, 98.1 times 0.102 is about 10. So 10 / 98.1 is approximately 0.102 moles, right?

Wait no, wait. 98.1 * 0.102 is 98.1 * 0.1 is 9.81, and 98.1 * 0.002 is 0.1962. So 9.81 + 0.1962 is about 10.0062. So yeah, 0.102 is about right.

So moles of H2SO4 is 0.102. Now, the solution is 500 ml, which is half a liter. So volume in liters is 0.5 L.

Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.102 moles divided by 0.5 liters. That would be 0.204 M. Wait, because 0.102 /0.5 is the same as 0.102 * 2, which is 0.204.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.204 M. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. Does that affect the molarity calculation? Oh wait, no, molarity is just about the concentration of the solute. Each molecule contributes to the molarity, regardless of how many ions it releases. So for sulfuric acid, each molecule counts as one mole in solution, even though it can donate two protons. So my initial calculation holds. So the correct molarity is 0.204 M, which is option A.

To calculate the molarity of the sulfuric acid solution, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}}
\]

1. **Determine the moles of sulfuric acid (H\(_2\)SO\(_4\)):**  
   The mass of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is 10.0 g, and its molar mass is 98.1 g/mol. Using the formula:

   \[
   \text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{10.0}{98.1} \approx 0.102 \, \text{moles}
   \]

2. **Convert the volume of the solution to liters:**  
   The solution volume is 500 mL, which is equivalent to:

   \[
   500 \, \text{mL} = 0.5 \, \text{L}
   \]

3. **Calculate the molarity:**  
   Using the formula for molarity:

   \[
   \text{Molarity} = \frac{0.102}{0.5} = 0.204 \, \text{M}
   \]

Thus, the molarity of the sulfuric acid solution is **0.204 M**.

**Final Answer:** A
