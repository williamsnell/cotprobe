Okay, so I've got this problem here about setting a target selling price for a new product called Duct. The goal is to find the selling price that gives a 20% target contribution margin. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my accounting terms, but I think I can figure this out.

Let's start by understanding what a contribution margin is. From what I remember, the contribution margin is the amount of money left after covering variable costs. It's calculated as (Selling Price - Variable Costs). The target contribution margin ratio is the percentage of this contribution that goes towards covering fixed costs and generating profit. So, a 20% target means that 20% of the selling price is the desired contribution margin.

Wait, no, wait. I think I might have that backwards. Contribution margin is usually Sales minus Variable Costs. The contribution margin ratio is (Contribution Margin / Sales) * 100. So if the target is 20%, that means 20% of the selling price is the contribution margin. So, Contribution Margin = 0.20 * Selling Price.

But wait, another approach: Contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage of sales. So, Target Contribution Margin Ratio = (Sales - Variable Costs) / Sales. So if the target is 20%, then (Sales - Variable Costs) = 0.20 * Sales. That would mean Variable Costs = 0.80 * Sales. So, Sales = Variable Costs / 0.80.

Wait, but in this problem, the variable costs include both manufacturing and selling/admin. Oh right, because variable costs are all the costs that vary per unit, regardless of which department they're in. So the total variable cost per unit is the sum of variable manufacturing and variable selling & admin costs.

Looking at the data: Variable manufacturing is $12, variable selling & admin is $3. So total variable costs per unit = 12 + 3 = $15.

Now, the target contribution margin is 20% of the selling price. So, the contribution margin per unit is 0.20 * Selling Price. But the contribution margin is also equal to Selling Price minus Total Variable Costs. So:

Contribution Margin = Selling Price - Total Variable Costs
0.20 * Selling Price = Selling Price - $15

Let me write that equation again:

0.20 SP = SP - 15

Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.20 SP would be less than SP, so SP - 15 equals a smaller number. Let me rearrange this equation.

0.20 SP = SP - 15

Subtract 0.20 SP from both sides:

0 = 0.80 SP - 15

Then, 0.80 SP = 15

So, SP = 15 / 0.80 = 18.75

Wait, that gives SP as $18.75. Let me check the options. Option A is $18.75, so that's one possibility.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. The target contribution margin is 20% of the selling price. So, the formula should be:

Contribution Margin (CM) = SP - Variable Costs (VC)
Target CM Ratio = CM / SP = 20% => CM = 0.20 SP

Substituting:

0.20 SP = SP - VC

So,

0.20 SP = SP - 15

Subtract 0.20 SP from both sides:

0 = 0.80 SP - 15

0.80 SP = 15

SP = 15 / 0.80 = 18.75

Yes, that's correct. So the selling price should be $18.75. Looking at the options, option A is $18.75. So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me double-check if I considered all the variable costs. Yes, variable manufacturing is $12, variable S&A is $3, so 15 total. Fixed costs don't matter here because contribution margin only considers variable costs. So the calculation holds.

Alternatively, sometimes problems might approach it differently, but I think this is the correct way. Let me think if there's another way someone might approach it. Oh, wait, sometimes people confuse contribution margin with profit margins. But in this case, the problem specifies the target contribution margin, which is about covering variable costs and contributing to fixed and profit. So yes, the approach is correct.

To determine Duct's target selling price with a 20% target contribution margin, we start by understanding that the contribution margin is calculated as:

\[
\text{Contribution Margin (CM)} = \text{Selling Price (SP)} - \text{Total Variable Costs (VC)}
\]

The target contribution margin ratio is given as 20%, which means:

\[
\text{Target CM Ratio} = \frac{\text{CM}}{\text{SP}} = 20\% \implies \text{CM} = 0.20 \cdot \text{SP}
\]

Substituting the expression for CM:

\[
0.20 \cdot \text{SP} = \text{SP} - \text{VC}
\]

The total variable costs per unit are the sum of variable manufacturing and variable selling & admin costs:

\[
\text{VC} = \$12 + \$3 = \$15
\]

Substituting VC into the equation:

\[
0.20 \cdot \text{SP} = \text{SP} - 15
\]

Rearranging:

\[
0 = 0.80 \cdot \text{SP} - 15
\]

\[
0.80 \cdot \text{SP} = 15
\]

\[
\text{SP} = \frac{15}{0.80} = 18.75
\]

Thus, the target selling price is \$18.75. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**A: \$18.75**
