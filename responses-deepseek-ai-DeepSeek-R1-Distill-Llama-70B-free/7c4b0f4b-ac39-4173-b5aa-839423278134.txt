Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about a state lottery. Let me try to understand what's going on. So the setup is that four digits are drawn randomly one at a time with replacement from 0 to 9. And I win if any permutation of my selected integers is drawn. The question is, what's the probability of winning if I select 6,7,8,9.

Hmm, wait. So, when they say "with replacement," that means each digit is drawn independently, right? So each of the four digits is equally likely to be any number from 0 to 9, and each draw doesn't affect the others. So each digit has 10 possibilities, making the total number of possible combinations 10^4, which is 10,000. Got that part.

Now, I'm selecting the numbers 6,7,8,9. So my selected set is these four distinct digits. Now, the key here is that I win if any permutation of these four is drawn. So that means that if the lottery draws any of the possible orderings of 6,7,8,9, I win.

Wait, but since the digits are drawn with replacement, does that affect the number of possible winning combinations? Because in the case without replacement, each draw is unique, but here, since it's with replacement, the same digit can appear more than once. But wait, in my case, I've selected four distinct digits, so the winning numbers must be some permutation of these four, and none of them are the same. So in the lottery draw, the four digits must all be distinct and match 6,7,8,9 in some order.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because the lottery is drawn with replacement, it's possible that some digits are repeated. But in my selection, all four are distinct. So the winning condition is that any permutation of my four numbers is drawn. So does that mean that the lottery's four digits must be exactly my four digits, possibly in any order, regardless of repetition? Or does it mean that all four must be a permutation, implying that each must appear exactly once?

I think the latter. Because if the lottery draws four digits, say 6,6,7,8, that's not a permutation of 6,7,8,9, because 9 isn't there and 6 is repeated. So for me to win, the lottery's four digits must be a permutation of 6,7,8,9, meaning each appears exactly once, just in any order. So the lottery must draw all four of my numbers exactly once each, in any order.

So the total number of possible lottery draws is 10,000, as each digit is independent.

Now, how many winning combinations are there? Well, since it's the permutations of 4 distinct numbers, that's 4 factorial, which is 24. So there are 24 possible winning combinations.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Each winning combination is a unique ordering of 6,7,8,9. So yes, 4! =24.

So the probability of winning would be the number of winning combinations divided by the total possible combinations. So that's 24 / 10,000.

Let me compute that. 24 divided by 10,000 is 0.0024. So the probability is 0.0024.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.0024. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility I'm missing something? For example, does the problem consider that digits can be repeated, but in my selection, I have unique digits, so the winning cases must have all four unique digits. So yes, that's correct. So the number of favorable outcomes is 24.

Alternatively, someone might think that the number of favorable outcomes includes any arrangement where each of my digits appears at least once, but that's not the case here because with replacement, the digits can repeat. But in this problem, the winning condition is any permutation of the selected digits, which implies each digit appears exactly once, in any order.

So yes, 24 is correct. So 24/10000 is 0.0024, which is option G.

In this problem, the lottery involves drawing four digits with replacement from 0 to 9, meaning each digit is independent and can repeat. The total number of possible combinations is \(10^4 = 10,000\). The winning condition is that any permutation of the selected digits (6, 7, 8, 9) is drawn. Since the selected digits are distinct, the winning combinations must also consist of these four digits appearing exactly once, in any order. 

The number of favorable outcomes is the number of permutations of the four distinct digits, which is \(4! = 24\). Therefore, the probability of winning is:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{24}{10,000} = 0.0024.
\]

Among the given options, the correct answer is **G: 0.0024**.
