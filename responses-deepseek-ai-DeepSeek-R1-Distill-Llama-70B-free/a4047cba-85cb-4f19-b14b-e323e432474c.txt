Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to color the faces of a cube using three colors, and the catch is that two colorings are considered the same if one can be rotated to look like the other. Hmm, I remember that this kind of problem involves combinatorics and group theory, maybe something called Burnside's lemma. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably figure out the total number of colorings without considering rotations. Since each face can be colored in three ways and there are six faces, that's 3^6. Let me calculate that: 3*3*3*3*3*3 is 729. So without considering rotations, there are 729 possible colorings. But of course, many of these are equivalent under rotation, so the actual number is much lower.

Now, using Burnside's lemma, I need to find the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry of the cube. The lemma says the number of distinct colorings is equal to the average number of fixed colorings across all the symmetry operations of the cube.

So I should break down the cube's rotation group into its different types of symmetries. From what I remember, the cube has various types of axes: identity, 90-degree and 180-degree rotations about face axes, 120-degree rotations about body diagonals (vertex axes), and 180-degree rotations about edge axes.

Wait, let me get the count right. The cube's rotation group has 24 elements. Let me list them:

1. Identity rotation: Do nothing. There's only 1 such element.

2. Rotations about an axis through the centers of opposite faces. For each such axis, we can rotate by 90°, 180°, or 270°. There are 3 axes (x, y, z), and for each, 3 non-identity rotations. So that's 3 axes * 3 rotations = 9 elements, but wait, wait. Actually, each face can be rotated in 90 and 270, which are distinct, plus 180. So for each of the 3 axes, there are 3 non-identity rotations (90,180,270). Wait no: 90° and 270° are the same as each other in terms of being distinct, but 180 is its own inverse. So for each axis, 3 rotations (90, 180, 270). So 3 axes * 3 rotations = 9 elements. Plus the identity makes 10 so far. Hmm, but I thought the total was 24. Maybe I'm missing some.

3. Rotations about an axis through opposite vertices (body diagonals). For each such axis, we can rotate by 120° and 240°. There are 4 such axes (since a cube has four space diagonals, but each rotation axis goes through two opposite vertices. Hmm, wait, the number of such axes is actually 4, because each pair of opposite vertices defines an axis. Or wait, no, for a cube, the number of body diagonals is 4, but each rotation axis uses two of them. So maybe the number of such axes is 4 choose 2? No, wait, no. Let me think: a cube has 4 space diagonals, and each rotation axis is determined by a pair of opposite vertices. So the number of such axes is 4/2 = 2? No, wait, no. Wait, each space diagonal connects two opposite vertices. So how many unique axes do these rotations have? Let's see: each rotation axis goes through two opposite vertices. The cube has 8 vertices, so the number of such axes is 8/(2*1) )= 4? Wait no, because each axis is defined by two opposite vertices. So 8 vertices make 4 pairs, but each axis is one pair. So 4 axes? Wait, no, that can't be right because I thought the cube has 4 space diagonals. A space diagonal runs from a vertex to the opposite vertex. So for each pair of opposite vertices, there's one space diagonal. So the cube has 4 space diagonals. But each rotation about such an axis at 120° and 240°. So for each of these 4 axes, two rotations (120 and 240). So that's 4 * 2 = 8 elements.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the number of axes through opposite vertices is 4, each with two non-identity rotations (120 and 240), giving 8 elements. So far, including the identity, we have 1 + 9 +8=18. But the cube's rotation group has 24 elements, so I'm missing some.

Ah, right. There are also rotations about axes through the midpoints of opposite edges. These are 180-degree rotations. Each such axis allows a single non-identity rotation (180 degrees). How many such axes are there?

Each edge has a midpoint, and opposite edges are those that are parallel and non-intersecting. Let me think: the cube has 12 edges. Each axis goes through the midpoints of a pair of opposite edges. How many such pairs? For each edge, there's exactly one opposite edge. So the number of such axes is 12/2 =6? No, wait, because each axis is defined by a pair of opposite edges, and each axis is shared by two pairs. Hmm, perhaps another approach: in a cube, how many axes are there through midpoints of opposite edges? For example, consider edges along the x-axis: there are four edges along the x-direction (front top, front bottom, back top, back bottom). Wait no: more accurately, each cube has edges along x, y, z directions. For each axis direction, there are edges in pairs. Let me think: for each face, there are four edges, but perhaps an easier way is to realize that there are 6 axes through edge midpoints. Because each axis is perpendicular to a pair of opposite edges. Alternatively, the number of such axes is 6. Because for each of the three coordinate axes, there are two possible orientations? Or wait, perhaps there are 6 axes, each corresponding to a pair of opposite edges. For example, for the x-axis edges, there are two possible axes (along y and z directions). Hmm, maybe it's easier to just recall that the cube has 6 such axes, each allowing a 180-degree rotation. So that's 6 elements.

So adding that to the previous count: 1 (identity) + 9 (face rotations) +8 (vertex rotations) +6 (edge rotations) =24 elements. Yes, that adds up.

Now, for Burnside's lemma, I need to calculate, for each type of rotation, the number of colorings fixed by that rotation, and then average them.

So the different types of rotations are:

1. Identity (1 element)
2. 90-degree and 270-degree rotations about face axes (6 elements: 3 axes, each with two non-180 rotations)
3. 180-degree rotations about face axes (3 elements: 3 axes, each 180)
4. 120 and 240-degree rotations about vertex axes (8 elements: 4 axes, each two rotations)
5. 180-degree rotations about edge axes (6 elements)

Wait, let me correct. Burnside requires considering each conjugacy class. So, perhaps it's better to group the rotations by their types, where each type has the same cycle structure in terms of face permutations.

So the conjugacy classes in the cube's rotation group are:

1. Identity: 1 element
2. 90-degree and 270-degree rotations about face axes: 6 elements total (each face axis has two such rotations)
3. 180-degree rotations about face axes: 3 elements
4. 120 and 240-degree rotations about vertex axes: 8 elements (because each of the 4 axes contributes two rotations)
5. 180-degree rotations about edge axes: 6 elements

Now, for each conjugacy class, we calculate the number of colorings fixed by any element of that class. Then, multiply by the number of elements in the class, sum all, and divide by the group size (24) to get the average.

Let me proceed for each class.

1. Identity rotation:
Every coloring is fixed by the identity. So the number is 3^6 =729.

2. 90-degree and 270-degree face rotations:
Let's think about a 90-degree rotation about a face axis. For a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, the four side faces around the axis must all be the same color. Because when you rotate 90 degrees, each face moves to the next position, so all four must be the same. The top and bottom (the faces on the rotation axis) can be any color.

So for each such rotation, the number of fixed colorings is 3 (for the top face) * 3 (for the bottom face) * 3 (for the four side faces, which must be the same color). So 3^3=27.

But wait, wait. Wait, the four side faces must all be the same color. So top and bottom can be any color, and the four side faces must be the same. So yes, 3 choices for top, 3 for bottom, 3 for the sides: 3*3*3=27.

But wait, in a 90-degree rotation, the four side faces form a single cycle. So for the coloring to be fixed, all four must have the same color. So the count is correct.

Since the conjugacy class has 6 elements (each 90 and 270 for each of 3 axes), each contributes 27 fixed colorings. So total for this class is 6*27=162.

3. 180-degree face rotations:
A 180-degree rotation swaps opposite side faces. So for example, front and back are swapped, left and right are swapped, etc. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the rotation is about a face axis. So the top and bottom are fixed, and the four side faces are rotated 180 degrees, which swaps front with back and left with right.

Wait, no. If we rotate 180 degrees about the vertical axis, the front face swaps with the back face, and the left swaps with the right. So each face is either fixed (top and bottom) or swapped in pairs.

For a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, the pairs must have the same color. So top can be any color, bottom any color, and front=back, left=right.

So the number of fixed colorings is 3 (top) *3 (bottom) *3 (front=back) *3 (left=right) = 3^4 =81.

Wait, because front and back must be same, left and right must be same. So four independent choices: top, bottom, front-back, left-right. So 3^4=81.

Since there are 3 such rotations, total fixed colorings for this class is 3*81=243.

4. 120 and 240-degree vertex rotations:
These rotations cycle three faces around a vertex. Let me think: imagine rotating the cube 120 degrees about a space diagonal (from vertex A to the opposite vertex). This would cycle three faces around A and the other three around the opposite vertex.

Wait, more accurately, a 120-degree rotation about a body diagonal will cycle three adjacent faces in a cycle of length 3. Hmm, perhaps each 120-degree rotation causes three faces to rotate among each other and the other three to do the same.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a permutation of the faces. Let me consider the cube: when you rotate about a body diagonal (vertex axis), the three faces meeting at that vertex are cycled. So each 120-degree rotation creates a 3-cycle of three faces and another 3-cycle of the opposite three faces.

So for a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, each cycle must have all faces the same color. So each 3-cycle's faces must all be the same color.

So for the three faces in one cycle, they must have the same color, and the other three must have the same color as well. The two sets can be different colors.

So the number of fixed colorings is 3 (color for first 3-cycle) *3 (color for second 3-cycle) =9.

But wait, wait. Wait, in a 120-degree rotation, the three faces in each of the two cycles must be the same color. So yes, each set must be monochromatic. So two independent choices: 3 *3=9.

Each such rotation contributes 9 fixed colorings. Since there are 8 elements in this class (each axis has two rotations: 120 and 240), total is 8*9=72.

Wait, but wait, are 120 and 240-degree rotations different in their effect? Let me think. The permutation for 120 and 240 degrees are actually inverses of each other, but in terms of cycle structure, both create the same cycle decomposition. So each would impose the same condition on the colorings. So yes, each contributes 9.

5. 180-degree edge rotations:
These are rotations about an axis that goes through the midpoints of opposite edges. Let me imagine such a rotation: it swaps two pairs of opposite faces and leaves none fixed. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how the faces are permuted.

Wait, a 180-degree rotation about an edge axis swaps two pairs of opposite faces and leaves the other two faces swapped as well. Wait, no, perhaps it's a double transposition.

Wait, let's think of the cube. For example, take an axis through the midpoints of front-top and back-bottom edges. A 180-degree rotation about this axis would swap the front and back faces, swap the top and bottom, and swap left and right. Wait, no, perhaps I'm not visualizing it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps each 180-degree edge rotation results in three pairs of swapped faces.

Wait, no. Let me think again: another approach. When you rotate 180 degrees about an edge axis, each face is either swapped with another or stays in place. But wait, in this case, no face remains in place. Each face is part of a 2-cycle.

Wait, no. A cube has six faces. So a 180-degree rotation would decompose into three independent 2-cycles. So each face is part of a pair that's swapped.

So for a coloring to be fixed under this rotation, each pair must have the same color. So the number of fixed colorings is 3^3=27. Because each of the three pairs must have matching colors, and each pair contributes one choice.

Wait, let me see: if three pairs are swapped, then each pair must have the same color. So the number of fixed colorings is 3^3=27.

Each of these 6 rotations contributes 27 fixed colorings. So total for this class is 6*27=162.

Now, to apply Burnside's lemma, I sum all the fixed colorings for each class and divide by the order of the group (24).

So the total is:

Identity: 729
90/270 face: 162
180 face: 243
120/240 vertex:72
180 edge:162

Adding them up: 729 +162=891; 891+243=1134; 1134+72=1206; 1206+162=1368.

So sum is 1368. Now divide by 24.

1368 /24 = let's compute.

24 * 50 = 1200. 1368-1200=168.

24*7=168. So 50+7=57.

So the number of distinct colorings is 57.

Looking at the options, option E is 57.

To determine the number of distinct ways to color the faces of a cube with three colors, up to rotation, we use Burnside's lemma. This involves calculating the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry operation in the cube's rotation group, which has 24 elements. The cube's rotation group is divided into the following conjugacy classes:

1. **Identity rotation (1 element)**: All \(3^6 = 729\) colorings are fixed.

2. **90° and 270° rotations about face axes (6 elements)**: For a coloring to be fixed, the four side faces must be the same color, while the top and bottom can be any color. The number of fixed colorings is \(3^3 = 27\) per rotation. Total for this class: \(6 \times 27 = 162\).

3. **180° rotations about face axes (3 elements)**: For a coloring to be fixed, pairs of opposite faces must have the same color. The number of fixed colorings is \(3^4 = 81\) per rotation. Total for this class: \(3 \times 81 = 243\).

4. **120° and 240° rotations about vertex axes (8 elements)**: For a coloring to be fixed, the three faces in each of the two 3-cycles must have the same color. The number of fixed colorings is \(3^2 = 9\) per rotation. Total for this class: \(8 \times 9 = 72\).

5. **180° rotations about edge axes (6 elements)**: For a coloring to be fixed, the three pairs of swapped faces must have the same color. The number of fixed colorings is \(3^3 = 27\) per rotation. Total for this class: \(6 \times 27 = 162\).

Summing the fixed colorings for all classes:

\[
729 + 162 + 243 + 72 + 162 = 1368
\]

Dividing by the order of the group (24) gives the number of distinct colorings:

\[
\frac{1368}{24} = 57
\]

Thus, the number of distinct ways to color the faces of a cube with three colors, up to rotation, is **57**.
