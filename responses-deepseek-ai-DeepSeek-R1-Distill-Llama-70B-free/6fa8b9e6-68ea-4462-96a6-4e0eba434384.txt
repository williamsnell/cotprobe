Okay, so I've got this question about Gestalt therapy and transference. Hmm, I remember that Gestalt therapy is a type of psychotherapy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

Transference, I think, is when the client redirects their feelings towards important figures in their life onto the therapist. Like, they might see the therapist as a parent or something. In Freudian psychoanalysis, transference is a big deal and is analyzed a lot. But Gestalt therapy is different, right?

Wait, Gestalt focuses more on the present moment and the therapeutic relationship. They emphasize awareness and the here and now. So how does that affect their view on transference?

I recall that in Gestalt, the therapist tries to create a genuine and authentic relationship with the client. They don't encourage transference in the traditional sense because they want the client to see them as a real person, not as a substitute for someone else. So maybe they don't focus on transference as much as other therapies.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Seen as a projection of the therapist's issues. No, that doesn't sound right. Transference is usually about the client's feelings, not the therapist's.

B: Ignored as it's not relevant. I don't think they ignore it, but maybe they don't focus on it as much.

C: Created by the client's fantasy. That seems more like the Freudian view, where transference is a projection.

D: Encouraged to deepen the relationship. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. I thought Gestalt doesn't encourage transference because it's more about the real relationship.

E: Sign of client's regression. Maybe in some therapies, but not sure about Gestalt.

F: Sign therapy is progressing. I'm not certain about that either.

G: Interpreted early in treatment. I don't think Gestalt does a lot of interpreting; they focus more on experience.

H: Worked through via dream work. No, Gestalt isn't big on dream analysis as the primary method.

I: Sign of resistance. Could be, but I'm not sure if that's specific to Gestalt.

Wait, I think in Gestalt therapy, transference is viewed as a distraction from the real, present relationship. So they might not encourage it and instead focus on the actual interactions between client and therapist. So transference isn't really something they encourage or delve into deeply. Instead, they might see it as a sign that the client is not fully present.

Looking back at the options, maybe option B says it's ignored. But I'm not sure if "ignored" is the right term. Alternatively, perhaps they consider it a sign of resistance, which would be option I.

Alternatively, the question is asking what transference is "usually" seen as. In Gestalt, transference isn't a central concept, so maybe they don't focus on it much. So perhaps the answer is that it's ignored as not relevant. But wait, that might not be accurate because any therapist would notice it, but maybe not make it a focus.

Alternatively, I think that in Gestalt, transference is viewed as a way the client avoids the present moment. So when transference happens, the therapist might point out that the client is bringing in past feelings rather than staying present. So it's not ignored, but perhaps seen as a sign that the client is not fully engaged in the here and now.

Wait, but the options don't exactly say that. Let me look again.

Option I says it's a sign of resistance. Resistance in therapy refers to the client's unconscious blocking of progress. If the client is transferring feelings, maybe the Gestalt therapist sees it as the client resisting the present interaction.

Alternatively, I've heard that Gestalt therapists might not place much emphasis on transference. So perhaps they don't encourage it and instead focus on the real relationship. So maybe the answer is that transference is usually ignored as it's not relevant. That would be option B.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm not entirely sure if Gestalt therapists ignore it or address it as resistance.

Wait, another angle: in Gestalt, the therapeutic relationship is authentic. So when transference occurs, the therapist might address it by pointing out the difference between the client's past experiences and the present reality. So they don't ignore it, but they don't encourage it either. They work through it to bring the client back to the present.

But the question is about what transference is "usually" seen as. So if they don't encourage it and instead see it as a sign that the client is avoiding the present, perhaps it's considered a sign of resistance, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps it's seen as a sign that therapy is progressing, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, I think I remember that in Gestalt therapy, transference is not a primary focus. They might view it as a form of resistance because the client is not engaging with the therapist in the present. So the answer could be I, considered a sign of resistance.

Alternatively, some sources might say that Gestalt therapists don't emphasize transference and may ignore it, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. I think they do acknowledge it but don't dwell on it as much as in psychoanalysis.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to recall. In Gestalt, the focus is on the here and now, so transference would be addressed to bring the client back to the present. So perhaps they don't encourage it but instead work through it as resistance.

So the answer would be I: considered a sign of resistance from the client.

In Gestalt therapy, the focus is on the present moment and the authentic therapeutic relationship. Transference, which involves the client redirecting feelings from past figures onto the therapist, is not typically encouraged or emphasized. Instead, Gestalt therapists aim to address transference by bringing the client back to the here and now. This approach suggests that transference is not ignored but is viewed as a potential sign of resistance, where the client may be avoiding engagement with the present reality.
