Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a swimming pool that's contaminated with dye, and we need to find the time when the concentration of dye reaches a certain level after using the pool's filtering system.

Hmm, so the pool has 60,000 gallons of water, and 5 kg of dye. Wait, I should convert that kg to grams because the concentration is given in grams per gallon. Oh right, 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 5 kg is 5000 grams. So the initial concentration would be the total dye divided by the volume of the pool. Let me calculate that: 5000 grams divided by 60,000 gallons. That comes out to 5000/60000 = 1/12 grams per gallon. So approximately 0.083333 g/gal initially.

The pool's filter can process water at 200 gallons per minute. But wait, I think the filtering system removes the dye. So as it processes the water, it's taking out the dye and returning clean water. So the dye is being removed over time.

This sounds like a differential equation problem. Let me think. The rate at which the dye is removed depends on the current concentration because the filter processes water based on concentration. So the change in dye over time is proportional to the concentration.

Wait, the differential equation for this kind of problem is usually: dQ/dt = -r * Q, where Q is the quantity of dye at time t, and r is the rate. But wait, the rate here might be related to the flow rate and the volume.

Wait, more accurately, the rate at which dye is removed is the flow rate multiplied by the concentration. Because the filter is taking in water, removing the dye, so the rate of removal is (flow rate) * (concentration). But the flow rate is 200 gal/min, and the volume is 60,000 gal. So the fraction of the pool processed per minute is 200/60000 = 1/300 per minute.

So the differential equation should be dQ/dt = - (200 gal/min) * (Q/(60,000 gal)) ) * (1 min) ). Wait, let me make sure the units work out. So dQ/dt has units of grams per minute. (200 gal/min) * (Q/(60,000 gal)) ) is (200/60000)*Q per minute, which is (1/300)*Q per minute. So the equation becomes dQ/dt = - (1/300) * Q.

Wait, no, because the flow rate is 200 gal/min, and the concentration is Q/V, so the dye being removed per minute is (200 gal/min) * (Q/(60,000 gal)) ) grams per minute. Because Q is in grams, so 200*(Q/60000) gives the grams removed per minute. So dQ/dt = -200*(Q/60000) = -(200/60000) Q = -(1/300) Q. So that's correct.

So the solution to this differential equation is an exponential decay. The general solution is Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-kt), where k is 1/300 per minute. So Q0 is 5000 grams.

Wait, but we're looking for the time when the concentration reaches 0.02 g/gal. Oh, right, so the concentration is Q(t)/V. So when does (Q(t)/60000) = 0.02 g/gal?

So let's set that up. Q(t) = 0.02 g/gal * 60000 gal = 1200 grams.

Wait, wait. Because 0.02 g/gal times 60,000 gal is 1200 grams. Because 0.02 * 60000 = 1200. So when Q(t) = 1200 grams.

So plugging into the equation:

1200 = 5000 * e^(-t/(300)).

Wait, not exactly. Because the exponential's exponent is -kt, and k is 1/300 per minute. So t is in minutes. So the exponent is - (1/300)*t.

So solving for t:

Divide both sides by 5000: 1200 / 5000 = e^(-t/300)

That's 0.24 = e^(-t/300)

Take natural log of both sides: ln(0.24) = -t/300

Multiply both sides by -1: -ln(0.24) = t/300

So t = 300 * (-ln(0.24)).

Wait, what's ln(0.24)? Let me compute that. Hmm, ln(0.24) is approximately... well, ln(0.25) is -1.3863, since e^-1.3863 ≈ 0.25. But 0.24 is a bit less than 0.25, so ln(0.24) is a bit more negative than -1.3863. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, let me approximate. Let me think, ln(0.24) ≈ ln(0.25) - (0.25-0.24)/(0.25). Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the Taylor expansion around 0.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute it numerically. Let me think:

We know that e^-1.4271 is approximately 0.24. Because:

e^-1 = 0.3679

e^-1.3863 ≈ 0.25

Wait, let me try e^-1.4271:

1.4271 is about 1.4 + 0.0271.

e^-1.4 is about 0.2466.

Wait, e^1.4271? Let me compute e^1.4 = 4.055, e^0.0271 ≈ 1.0275. So e^1.4271 ≈4.055 *1.0275≈4.167. So 1/e^1.4271≈1/4.167≈0.24. So ln(0.24)≈-1.4271.

Wait, wait, no. Because e^a = b, so a= ln b. So if e^-1.4271 = 0.24, then ln(0.24) = -1.4271.

So back to the calculation: t= 300 * ( - ln(0.24) ) = 300 * 1.4271 ≈ 300 * 1.4271.

Let me compute that: 300 *1.4 is 420, 300 * 0.0271 is 8.13, so total is about 428.13 minutes.

Wait, but I need to convert minutes to hours. So 428.13 minutes divided by 60 gives the time in hours.

428.13 /60 = let's compute 60 *7=420, so 7 hours with 8.13 minutes left. 8.13/60 ≈ 0.1355 hours. So total time is approximately 7.1355 hours.

Looking at the options, option G is 7.136 hours. So that's matching.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, the initial concentration is 5000 grams. The model is dQ/dt = -(1/300) Q.

So the solution is Q(t) = 5000 e^(-t/300).

We set Q(t) to 1200 grams, which is 0.02 g/gal *60000 gal.

So 1200=5000 e^(-t/300).

Divide both sides by 5000: 0.24 = e^(-t/300).

Take natural logs: ln(0.24)= -t/300.

So t= -300 * ln(0.24).

Yes, and ln(0.24)≈-1.4271, so t≈300 *1.4271=428.13 minutes.

Convert to hours: 428.13/60≈7.1355 hours, which is approximately 7.136 hours, option G.

To solve the problem, we start by converting the initial mass of dye into grams:  
\[
5 \, \text{kg} = 5000 \, \text{g}.
\]  
The initial concentration of dye in the pool is then:  
\[
\text{Initial concentration} = \frac{5000 \, \text{g}}{60,000 \, \text{gal}} = \frac{1}{12} \, \text{g/gal} \approx 0.08333 \, \text{g/gal}.
\]

The filtering system processes water at a flow rate of \(200 \, \text{gal/min}\), and the pool's volume is \(60,000 \, \text{gal}\). The fraction of the pool processed per minute is:  
\[
\frac{200}{60,000} = \frac{1}{300} \, \text{per minute}.
\]

The differential equation governing the dye concentration is:  
\[
\frac{dQ}{dt} = -\frac{1}{300} Q,
\]  
where \(Q(t)\) is the amount of dye in the pool at time \(t\). The solution to this equation is:  
\[
Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-t/300},
\]  
where \(Q_0 = 5000 \, \text{g}\) is the initial amount of dye.

We are tasked with finding the time \(T\) when the concentration of dye reaches \(0.02 \, \text{g/gal}\). At this concentration:  
\[
Q(T) = 0.02 \, \text{g/gal} \times 60,000 \, \text{gal} = 1200 \, \text{g}.
\]

Substituting \(Q(T) = 1200 \, \text{g}\) into the solution:  
\[
1200 = 5000 e^{-T/300}.
\]

Dividing through by 5000:  
\[
0.24 = e^{-T/300}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:  
\[
\ln(0.24) = -\frac{T}{300}.
\]

Solving for \(T\):  
\[
T = -300 \ln(0.24).
\]

Using \(\ln(0.24) \approx -1.4271\):  
\[
T = -300 \times (-1.4271) = 300 \times 1.4271 = 428.13 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

Converting to hours:  
\[
T = \frac{428.13}{60} \approx 7.136 \, \text{hours}.
\]

Thus, the time at which the concentration of dye first reaches \(0.02 \, \text{g/gal}\) is approximately **7.136 hours**.

**Final Answer: G**
