Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days. The distribution is normal, with a mean of 3250 and a standard deviation of 320. Hmm, right, I remember that in a normal distribution, the middle 50% is related to the interquartile range. 

Wait, wait, let me think. The middle 50% would be between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, right? So that's the interquartile range (IQR), which is Q3 minus Q1. But how do I calculate that when I know the mean and standard deviation?

Oh, right, in a normal distribution, certain percentiles correspond to specific z-scores. The 25th percentile is at z = -0.6745 and the 75th percentile at z = 0.6745. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Let me get that right. I think the 25th and 75th percentiles are each about 0.6745 standard deviations away from the mean. So the z-scores are -0.6745 and +0.6745.

So to find the values, I can use the formula X = μ + z*σ. So for the lower bound (25th percentile), it would be 3250 + (-0.6745)*320. And the upper bound (75th percentile) would be 3250 + 0.6745*320.

Let me calculate each part. First, 0.6745 multiplied by 320. So 0.6745 * 320. Let me compute that. 0.6 *320 is 192. 0.0745 *320 is about 23.84. So total is approximately 192 +23.84 = 215.84. So around 215.84.

So the lower bound is 3250 - 215.84. That would be 3250 - 200 is 3050, minus another 15.84 is 3034.16. And the upper bound is 3250 +215.84, which is 3465.84.

So the range is approximately from 3034 to 3466. Let me look at the options. Let me see the options:

Option B is (3,034;3,466). Oh, wait, because 3034.16 is about 3034, and 3465.84 is about 3466. So B is (3034, 3466). So that's the range.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are in the thousands, so each unit is 100, perhaps? No, looking at the options:

Option A: (3,100, 3,400) → 3100-3400. That's too narrow.

Option B: (3,034, 3,466) → 3034-3466, which matches what I calculated.

Option C: (3,000, 3,500) → 3000-3500, which is wider than B.

So the correct answer should be B.

The number of customers served per day follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 3,250 and a standard deviation (σ) of 320. To find the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days, we need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR), which corresponds to the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3). 

In a normal distribution, the 25th and 75th percentiles are located at z-scores of -0.6745 and +0.6745, respectively. Using the formula \( X = \mu + z \cdot \sigma \):

- For Q1 (25th percentile):  
  \[
  X = 3250 + (-0.6745) \cdot 320 = 3250 - 215.84 = 3034.16
  \]

- For Q3 (75th percentile):  
  \[
  X = 3250 + 0.6745 \cdot 320 = 3250 + 215.84 = 3465.84
  \]

Thus, the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days is approximately (3034, 3466). Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is:

**B: (3,034, 3,466)**.
