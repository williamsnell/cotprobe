Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about pricing strategies, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again: "Where the price is set low relative to the competition to gain market share, this strategy is known as:"

Hmm, I remember that different pricing strategies have different goals. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Captive product pricing. I think this is when a company has a captive market, meaning customers have no choice but to buy from them. Like, maybe if you're selling printer ink and you're the only one compatible with that printer. But the question is about setting a low price to gain market share, so this might not be it.

Option B: High-low pricing. I recall this involves setting high prices initially and then offering discounts or promotions. Like, when a new product comes out expensive but later goes on sale. Not sure if this is about being low relative to competition.

Option C: Price skimming. Oh wait, skimming is when you set a high price at first to maximize profits, especially when there's little competition. So the opposite of low pricing. Not this one.

Option D: Value added pricing. I'm not too sure, but I think this involves adding extra features or services to justify a higher price. Again, not about being lower than competitors.

Option E: Penetration pricing. Penetration... that sounds familiar. I think this is when you enter a market with a low price to attract customers and gain market share quickly. So this fits the question because the price is set low relative to others.

Option F: Premium pricing. That's setting a high price to make the product seem exclusive or high-quality. Definitely not low, so no.

Option G: Cost-plus pricing. This is where you calculate costs and add a markup. It's more about covering costs than about market position, so probably not the answer.

Option H: Economy pricing. This is for budget products, like no-frills goods. The prices are low because production costs are kept low. But I'm not sure if it's specifically about gaining market share by being lower than competitors. It might be more about the product's value proposition.

Option I: Psychological pricing. Techniques like setting a price just below a round number, like $9.99 instead of $10. It's more about perception than competitive strategy regarding market share.

Option J: Competitive pricing. This involves setting prices based on what competitors are doing, maybe matching or slightly adjusting. But the question is about setting low to gain share, so maybe this is just part of competitive pricing. Wait, but isn't penetration pricing a specific type of competitive strategy?

Wait, I'm a bit confused between E and J. Penetration pricing is a specific strategy where you enter the market with a lower price to capture a large share. Competitive pricing is a broader term where you adjust prices based on the competition, not necessarily always lower. So the question is specifically about setting low prices to gain market share, which points to penetration pricing, which is option E.

The correct answer is E: Penetration pricing. This strategy involves setting a lower price than competitors to quickly gain market share by attracting customers.

Answer: E
