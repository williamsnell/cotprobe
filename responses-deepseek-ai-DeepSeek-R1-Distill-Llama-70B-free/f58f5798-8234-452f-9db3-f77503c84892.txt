Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the change in enthalpy when heating copper. Hmm, let me see. The question says that 2 moles of Cu are heated from 50°C to 200°C. They've given me the constants a and b, which are 5.41 cal/(mol·K) and 1.50 cal/(mol·K²), respectively.

Wait, I remember that the formula for the enthalpy change when the temperature changes involves the heat capacity. Oh right, for solids, the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) can be approximated using the equation Cp = a + bT, where T is the temperature in Kelvin. Or wait, sometimes it's Cp = a + bT + cT², but here they only give a and b, so maybe it's just a linear function.

So the formula for the change in enthalpy (ΔH) when heating from T1 to T2 would be the integral of Cp dT. Because Cp is a function of T, I can't just multiply by the temperature change directly; I need to integrate.

Let me write that out. ΔH = n * ∫ from T1 to T2 of (a + bT) dT. The limits are from T1 to T2, and n is the number of moles.

Wait, but the temperatures given are in Celsius. I need to convert them to Kelvin because the equation uses absolute temperature. Oh right, because integrating from a lower T to a higher T in K is better.

So, T1 is 50°C, which is 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K. T2 is 200°C, which is 200 + 273.15 = 473.15 K.

Now, let's calculate the integral. The integral of a dT is aT, and the integral of bT dT is (b/2)T². So putting it together, the integral from T1 to T2 is [aT + (b/2) T²] evaluated at T2 minus T1.

So ΔH = n * [a(T2 - T1) + (b/2)(T2² - T1²)].

Let me plug in the numbers. n is 2 moles. a is 5.41 cal/(mol·K), and b is 1.50 cal/(mol·K²).

Calculating each part step by step.

First, compute T2 - T1. T2 is 473.15 K, T1 is 323.15 K. So 473.15 - 323.15 = 150 K.

Then, a*(T2-T1) = 5.41 * 150 = let's compute that. 5 * 150 is 750, 0.41*150 is 61.5, so total 811.5 cal/mol.

Next, compute (T2² - T1²). Hmm, that's (473.15)^2 - (323.15)^2. Let me calculate each square.

Wait, perhaps I can factor that as (T2 - T1)(T2 + T1). Oh yeah, because T² - T1² = (T2-T1)(T2+T1). So that would make it 150 * (473.15 + 323.15) = 150 * 796.3 = let me compute 150 * 796.3.

Wait, 150 * 700 is 105000, 150 * 96.3 is 14445, so total 105000 +14445 = 119445 K².

Then multiply by (b/2), which is 1.50 / 2 = 0.75 cal/(mol·K²). So 0.75 * 119445 = let's see. 0.75 * 100000 is 75000, 0.75 * 19445 is 14583.75. So total 75000 +14583.75 = 89583.75 cal/mol.

Wait wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because the units would be cal/(mol·K²) multiplied by K² gives cal/mol. So yes, that makes sense.

So now, the integral gives [811.5 + 89583.75] = 90494.25 cal/mol. Wait no, wait: the integral is a(T2-T1) + (b/2)(T2² - T1²) = 811.5 + 89583.75 = 90494.25 cal/mol.

But wait, no, wait, 811.5 is cal/(mol·K) * K, so cal/mol. 89583.75 is cal/mol as well. So adding them gives 90494.25 cal/mol.

Then multiply by n=2 moles. So 2 * 90494.25 = 180,988.5 cal.

Wait, that's in calories. But the answer options are in Joules. Oh right, because 1 cal is approximately 4.184 Joules. So I need to convert calories to Joules.

So 180,988.5 cal * 4.184 J/cal = let's calculate this.

Hmm, let's approximate. 180,988.5 * 4 = 723,954. Then 180,988.5 * 0.184 = let's see. 180,988.5 * 0.1 = 18,098.85; 0.08 is 14,479.08; 0.004 is 723.954. So 18,098.85 +14,479.08 = 32,577.93 +723.954 = 33,301.884.

So total is 723,954 + 33,301.884 ≈ 757,255 J. So approximately 757,255 J. Looking at the options, I don't see 757,000J. The options are A:9000, B:7200, C:8200, D:8700, E:8000, F:6500, G:7000, H:5000, I:7540, J:6800.

Wait wait a second, that can't be right. Because the answer options are way smaller than 757,000 J. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me check the numbers again. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion. Wait, the a and b are given in cal/(mol·K) and cal/(mol·K²). So the integral is in cal/mol, and when multiplied by n=2, it's cal. Then to convert to J, multiply by 4.184.

Wait, but let me re-express. Let me recompute the numbers carefully.

First, compute (T2 - T1) = 473.15 - 323.15 = 150 K.

a(T2-T1) = 5.41 cal/(mol·K) * 150 K = 5.41 *150. Let me compute that: 5 *150=750, 0.41*150=61.5 → total 811.5 cal/mol.

Then (T2^2 - T1^2) = (473.15^2 - 323.15^2). Let me compute each square.

473.15^2: Let's compute 473^2. 400^2=160,000, 73^2=5,329, 2*400*73=58,400 → (400+73)^2 = 160,000 +58,400 +5,329=223,729. But wait, 473.15 is 473 +0.15, so (473.15)^2 = (473)^2 + 2*473*0.15 + (0.15)^2 = 223,729 + 141.9 + 0.0225 ≈ 223,870.9225.

Similarly, 323.15^2: 323^2=104,329. 2*323*0.15=96.9. (0.15)^2=0.0225 → 104,329 +96.9 +0.0225 ≈ 104,425.9225.

So T2^2 - T1^2 = 223,870.9225 - 104,425.9225 = 119,445 K².

Then, (b/2)(T2^2 - T1^2) = (1.5 / 2) * 119,445 = 0.75 * 119,445 = 89,583.75 cal/mol.

So the integral [a(T2-T1) + (b/2)(T2^2 - T1^2)] is 811.5 + 89,583.75 = 90,495.25 cal/mol.

Multiply by n=2 → 2 * 90,495.25 = 180,990.5 cal.

Convert to J: 180,990.5 cal * 4.184 J/cal ≈ let's compute this.

180,990.5 * 4 = 723,962 J.

180,990.5 * 0.184 = let's compute 180,990.5 * 0.1 = 18,099.05; 0.08 * 180,990.5 =14,479.24; 0.004 *180,990.5=723.962.

Adding those: 18,099.05 +14,479.24 = 32,578.29 +723.962 = 33,302.25 J.

So total is 723,962 + 33,302.25 = 757,264.25 J. Approximately 757,264 J.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the highest is 9000 J. Wait, 757,264 J is 757 kJ. None of the options are in that range. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me read the question again. Oh wait! Oh no! Wait, the question says the temperature is from 50°C to 200°C. Oh, but converting that, 50°C is 323.15 K, and 200°C is 473.15 K. So the delta T is 150 K. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread the number of moles. The question says 2 moles of Cu. So n=2, correct.

Wait, perhaps the equation for Cp is different. Oh wait, another thought: sometimes, the heat capacity is given as Cp = a + b*T, but where T is in Kelvin or Celsius? Because if T is in Celsius, the numbers would be different.

Wait, the problem gives a and b in terms of K^-1 and K^-2, so T should be in Kelvin.

Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error when computing T2² - T1². Let me recompute that.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should compute 473.15^2 and 323.15^2 more accurately.

473.15^2:

Let me compute 473 * 473. Let me do this step by step.

400 * 400 = 160,000.

400 *73 = 29,200. But wait, 400 * 73 = 29,200, but since it's (400+73)^2, the expansion is 400^2 + 2*400*73 + 73^2.

Wait, 400^2=160,000.

2*400*73= 2*400=800; 800 *73= 800*70=56,000; 800*3=2,400 → 58,400.

73^2=5,329.

So 160,000 +58,400 = 218,400 +5,329= 223,729.

But wait, 473.15 is 473 + 0.15. So (473 +0.15)^2 = 473^2 + 2*473*0.15 + 0.15^2 = 223,729 + 141.9 + 0.0225 = 223,870.9225.

Similarly, 323.15 is 323 +0.15. So (323.15)^2 = 323^2 + 2*323*0.15 + 0.15^2.

323^2: 300^2=90,000; 2*300*23=13,800; 23^2=529 → 90,000 +13,800=103,800 +529=104,329.

2*323*0.15= 646 *0.15=96.9.

0.15^2=0.0225.

So 104,329 +96.9 = 104,425.9 +0.0225=104,425.9225.

So T2^2 - T1^2 = 223,870.9225 -104,425.9225 = 119,445. So that was correct.

Hmm. Then the integral is 811.5 + (1.5/2)*119,445 = 811.5 + (0.75 * 119,445) = 811.5 + 89,583.75 = 90,395.25 cal/mol.

Wait, earlier I had 90,495.25. Oh wait, 5.41 *150 is 811.5, correct. 0.75*119,445 is 89,583.75. So 811.5 + 89,583.75 = 90,395.25. Oh, earlier I must have miscalculated. So 90,395.25 cal/mol.

Multiply by 2 moles: 2 * 90,395.25 = 180,790.5 cal.

Now, convert to J: 180,790.5 cal *4.184 J/cal.

Let me compute this.

180790.5 *4 = 723,162 J.

180790.5 *0.184: Let's compute 180790.5 *0.1 = 18,079.05; 0.08 *180790.5 =14,463.24; 0.004 *180790.5=723.162.

Adding them: 18,079.05 +14,463.24 =32,542.29 +723.162=33,265.452 J.

Total ΔH =723,162 +33,265.452 =756,427.45 J.

Still around 756,427 J, but the options are 5,000 to 9,000 J. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the Cp formula is given as Cp = a + b*T in cal/(mol·K), but perhaps the integration is different. Or perhaps the calculation is per mole and per Kelvin, so perhaps I should not multiply by moles?

Wait, no. The formula I used is correct: ΔH = n * ∫ Cp dT.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the question uses Celsius instead of Kelvin in the Cp formula. Because if T is in Celsius, then the integral would be different.

Wait, but the problem states that a and b are in cal/(mol·K) and cal/(mol·K²), so T must be in Kelvin.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The molar heat capacity as a function of temperature is Cp = a + b*T, with T in Kelvin. So the change in enthalpy for one mole is the integral from T1 to T2 of (a + b T) dT.

So for each mole, the integral is a*(T2 - T1) + (b/2)*(T2² - T1²). Multiply by n=2.

Wait, that's what I did. But the result is way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the a and b are given in different units, like J instead of cal? No, the question says a =5.41 cal mol^-1 K^-1, so that's calories per mole per Kelvin.

Wait, let me double-check the arithmetic.

Compute a*(T2-T1): 5.41 *150 = 811.5 cal/mol.

Compute (b/2)(T2² - T1²) = 0.75 * 119,445 = 89,583.75 cal/mol.

Adding 811.5 +89,583.75 =90,395.25 cal/mol.

Then multiply by 2 moles: 2 *90,395.25 =180,790.5 cal.

Convert to J: 180,790.5 *4.184 = let's compute this more accurately.

180,790.5 *4 =723,162 J.

180,790.5 *0.184.

Let me compute 180790.5 *0.1 =18,079.05.

180790.5 *0.08 =14,463.24.

0.004 *180790.5=723.162.

Adding these: 18,079.05 +14,463.24 =32,542.29 +723.162=33,265.452.

So total J:723,162 +33,265.452=756,427.452 J.

But the options are all below 10,000 J. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the a and b are in J/(mol·K) and J/(mol·K²), not calories. Because 1 cal is 4.184 J, but if a was 5.41 J/(mol·K), then the numbers would be much smaller.

Wait, the question says a=5.41 cal mol^-1 K^-1, so that's calories. So that can't be it.

Wait another thought: Perhaps I forgot that the formula uses (T2 - T1) in the a term, but the b term uses (T2^2 - T1^2), which is correct. So perhaps my calculation is correct, but the options are in a different unit.

Wait the question asks for the answer in J, and the options are up to 9000 J. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles, or the temperature change.

Wait, wait, 2 moles being heated from 50 to 200°C. So ΔT is 150 K.

Wait, but 50°C is 323 K, 200°C is 473 K. So ΔT is 150 K. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Cp = a + b/(T), but that's not what the question says. The question gives a and b as coefficients of T^0 and T^1.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Cp = a + b*T^(-1), but that would change the integral. But the question states a and b as cal/(mol·K), K^-1 and K^-2, so T is in the denominator for the second term. So perhaps the formula is Cp = a + b/T
