Question:

On Thursday morning, two plainclothes police officers were shot to death while trying to arrest a bank robber who had just robbed a bank. Following the killings, the police issued an "all-points-bulletin" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.
B: succeed, if the man can prove the security guard had no reason to suspect him
C: succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.
D: not succeed, because the security guard was performing his duty
E: succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.
F: succeed, if the security guard used excessive force during the arrest
G: succeed, if the man experienced emotional trauma as a result of the false arrest
H: not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about assault. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is that on Thursday, two police officers were shot while trying to arrest a bank robber. The police then issued an all-points bulletin looking for a 40-year-old Caucasian male, 6 feet tall, weighing 150-155 pounds. Then, on Friday, a security guard saw a tall African American man who fit the age, height, and weight description. The guard approached him, pulled a gun, and arrested him, believing him to be the suspect. But the police said he was the wrong person. The man was humiliated and now is suing for assault.

The question is whether the man can succeed in a claim for assault against the security guard.

I remember that assault generally involves an intentional act that causes reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. It's about the fear of being touched in a harmful way without consent.

So the elements of assault would be: intent, apprehension, imminence, and causation. The security guard pulled a gun on the man, which is a direct threat. But the guard thought he was arresting the right person, but it turned out to be wrong.

Wait, but the guard was mistaken about the man's identity. So, does that affect the intent? Because the guard intended to arrest the suspect. But from the man's perspective, he was being threatened with a gun, so he would have feared for his safety.

Now, the possible defenses might include whether the guard had a reasonable belief. But for assault, the key is whether the act would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent harm. So even if the guard was mistaken, the act itself could still constitute assault if it's a reasonable apprehension.

Looking at the options:

Option A says he won't succeed because no injury. But assault doesn't require physical injury; it's about the apprehension. So A is incorrect.

Option B: succeed if no reason to suspect. But the guard thought he had a reason because the description matched in age, height, weight. The suspect was a different race, though. So maybe the guard had some reason, but perhaps it was a mistaken belief.

Option C: succeed if the mistaken belief was unreasonable. So if the guard's mistake was unreasonable, then perhaps assault. Because if the guard had no reasonable grounds to believe the man was the suspect, then pulling a gun would be an assault. Because the man didn't consent, and there was no privilege (like self-defense or making a lawful arrest), then the guard's act would be intentional and cause apprehension.

Option D: not succeed because the guard was performing duty. But the guard is a security guard, not a police officer. Also, even police can be liable if they act unlawfully. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: succeed if the man saw the gun. Well, I think that's a given because the guard pulled the gun on him, so he likely saw it. But E is too narrowâ€”maybe the man didn't see, but the act still happened. So E isn't the right condition.

Option F: succeed if excessive force. But assault is about the act causing apprehension, not necessarily the force used. So even if the force was reasonable for an arrest, if the arrest itself was unlawful, then assault might apply.

Option G: succeed if emotional trauma. Assault doesn't require physical harm, but emotional trauma alone might not be enough unless it's accompanied by the apprehension. But the question is about whether the claim would succeed based on certain conditions.

Option H: not succeed because no intent to injure. But intent for assault is the intent to cause apprehension, not intent to cause injury. So H is incorrect.

So the main issue is whether the guard had a reasonable belief. If the guard's belief was unreasonable, then the arrest was unlawful, and the act of pulling a gun would be assault.

The man was African American, while the suspect was Caucasian. So the guard must have seen beyond that. But the problem states the man fit the description in age, height, weight. So the guard had some reason, but race was different. Was the guard's mistake reasonable?

If the guard had no reasonable grounds to believe the man was the suspect, then the arrest was unlawful, and the guard's actions would constitute assault. So the success of the claim depends on whether the guard's mistake was unreasonable.

Looking at the options again, option C says the man will succeed if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. That makes sense because if the guard had no reasonable basis to detain, then the act of pulling a gun would be an assault.

So the answer should be C.

The question revolves around whether the man can succeed in a claim for assault against the security guard. Assault requires an intentional act that causes a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. The security guard pulled a gun on the man, which could create such apprehension. However, the guard mistakenly believed the man was the bank robbery suspect, matching the description in age, height, and weight, though the man was African American while the suspect was Caucasian.

For the man to succeed in his assault claim, it must be shown that the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable. If the guard had no reasonable grounds to detain the man, the act of pulling a gun would constitute assault. The analysis of the options reveals:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because assault does not require physical injury.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the guard had some reason to suspect based on the description.
- **Option C**: Correct because if the guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable, the act would constitute assault.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because the guard's duty does not justify an unlawful act.
- **Option E**: Too narrow, as the man likely saw the gun, but this is not the determining factor.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because assault focuses on apprehension, not just excessive force.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because emotional trauma alone does not define assault.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because intent to injure is not required for assault.

Thus, the man will succeed if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.
