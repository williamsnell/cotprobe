Question:

D: $15,000
E: $35,000

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question about foreign currency gains. Let's see what the question says.

Mentor Co. is a U.S. company and owns 100% of a Swiss corporation. The Swiss franc is the functional currency. They have two things happening here: remeasurement and translation of financial statements. Remeasurement resulted in a $25,000 gain, and translation in a $40,000 gain. The question is asking how much foreign currency gain Mentor should recognize in its income statement.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency is important. If the functional currency is the same as the local currency, which it is here (Swiss franc), then remeasurement and translation are involved.

Wait, remeasurement is when you convert the financial statements from the functional currency to the reporting currency (which is USD here) using current exchange rates. This process can result in gains or losses, which are recognized in the income statement. So the $25,000 gain from remeasurement would go into the income statement.

Then there's translation. Translation is adjusting the financial statements into the reporting currency, and any gains or losses from this are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) account, which is part of other comprehensive income, not the regular income statement. So the $40,000 gain from translation wouldn't be part of the income statement; it's in equity.

So the only gain that affects the income statement is the remeasurement gain of $25,000. The translation gain doesn't get recognized as income; it's deferred. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the key difference is remeasurement vs. translation. Remeasurement is for the books when the functional currency isn't the same as the local currency. But wait, in this case, the functional currency is the Swiss franc, which is the local currency. So maybe the remeasurement applies when the books are kept in a different currency than the functional. Oh wait, no. I think when the functional currency is the same as the local, remeasurement isn't needed. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait no, I think when the subsidiary's books are maintained in the functional currency (which is the same as the local currency here), then when you consolidate, you translate, not remeasure. Hmm, maybe I got that part wrong.

Wait, let me clarify. Remeasurement is done when the functional currency is different from the local currency. For example, if the subsidiary's functional currency is USD but they operate in a country where the local currency is Swiss francs. Then you would remeasure their financials into USD, the functional currency, and then translate into the parent's currency if needed.

But in this case, the functional currency is the same as the local currency (Swiss franc). So the subsidiary's books are in Swiss francs, which is their functional currency. So when Mentor Co. (the parent) wants to report in USD, they translate the financials from CHF to USD. Translation uses the current rate for assets and liabilities, resulting in a translation adjustment, which goes to CTA in equity, not income.

So then, where does remeasurement come into play here? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the scenario. Oh wait, perhaps the question is talking about the remeasurement of the financial statements of the subsidiary before translation. But if the functional currency is the same as the local currency, remeasurement isn't necessary. Because remeasurement is only when you have to adjust from the local currency to the functional currency, which is different.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The process is: the subsidiary's books are in the local currency (CHF), which is their functional currency. So when Mentor (the parent) prepares consolidated financial statements in USD, they translate the CHF financials into USD. So the translation process would involve gains or losses that go to CTA.

But where does remeasurement fit in? Remeasurement is when you have financial statements in a currency other than the functional currency. So if the functional currency is CHF, but the books were kept in another currency, then you would remeasure them into CHF first, which could result in gains/losses that go to income. But in this case, the books are already in CHF, the functional currency. So no remeasurement is needed. So perhaps the $25,000 gain from remeasurement is incorrect? Or maybe the question is mixing things up.

Wait the question says that remeasurement resulted in a gain. So maybe the initial step is that the subsidiary's financials are in a different currency, and then they're remeasured into CHF (functional currency), resulting in a $25k gain. Then, when translating into USD, a $40k gain occurs. But then, only the remeasurement gain affects the income statement.

So the total gain recognized in the income statement would be $25,000. The translation gain of $40k goes to CTA. So the answer should be $25,000, which is option H.

Wait, but why would there be a remeasurement gain if the functional currency is CHF? Maybe the subsidiary's books are maintained in another currency, say EUR, but their functional currency is CHF. So to get the financials into functional currency, you remeasure from EUR to CHF, which gives the $25k gain. Then, translate CHF to USD, which gives $40k gain in CTA.

In that case, the $25k is recognized in income, and $40k in CTA. So the answer would be $25k, which is option H.

The question involves Mentor Co., a U.S. corporation, which owns 100% of a Swiss subsidiary. The Swiss franc (CHF) is the functional currency of the subsidiary. Mentor must prepare its consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars (USD). The process involves two key steps: remeasurement and translation.

1. **Remeasurement**: This step is required when the subsidiary's financial statements are not already in the functional currency. If the subsidiary's books are maintained in a currency other than CHF, remeasurement into CHF (the functional currency) would occur. In this case, the remeasurement process resulted in a $25,000 gain. Remeasurement gains or losses are recognized in the income statement.

2. **Translation**: After remeasurement, the financial statements are translated from CHF (functional currency) to USD (reporting currency). This step uses current exchange rates and results in a $40,000 gain. However, translation gains or losses are not recognized in the income statement; instead, they are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) account, which is part of other comprehensive income.

Given this, only the $25,000 remeasurement gain is recognized in the income statement. The $40,000 translation gain is deferred to the CTA account and does not affect the income statement.

Thus, the amount Mentor should recognize as a foreign currency gain in its income statement is **$25,000**.
