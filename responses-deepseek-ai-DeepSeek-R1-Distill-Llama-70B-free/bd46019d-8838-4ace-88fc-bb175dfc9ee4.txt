Question:

A producer of widgets contacted a manufacturer of boxes about the possibility of purcIiasing specially designed boxes for shipping the widgets to customers. The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held

Options:

A: unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.
B: unenforceable, because the manufacturer was under a pre-existing duty.
C: unenforceable, due to the Statute of Frauds.
D: enforceable, as the parties' intentions were clear and unambiguous.
E: unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.
F: enforceable, due to the oral agreement being a modification of the written contract.
G: enforceable, because the manufacturer was motivated by a business advantage.
H: enforceable.
I: unenforceable, as the agreement to supply more boxes was not in writing.
J: unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the scenario: A producer of widgets contacts a manufacturer to buy specially designed boxes. They send over the specs and their logo. Then, after negotiations, they enter into a written contract. The contract says the manufacturer will supply as many boxes as the producer needs, up to 10,000 per month. So that's the written agreement.

Later the same day, the producer calls and says they're doing a one-time promotion, expecting higher sales, so they need 15,000 boxes for the first month only. The manufacturer agrees orally. The question is about whether this oral agreement is enforceable.

The options are A through J, each giving a different reason why it might be enforceable or not.

Hmm, I remember that contract modifications can sometimes be oral, but it depends on the circumstances. Let's think about the basic principles.

First, the written contract is for up to 10,000 boxes per month. The oral agreement is to supply 15,000 for the first month. So this is a modification of the original contract.

Under common law, a modification of a contract typically requires consideration to be enforceable. Consideration means both parties exchange something of value. But wait, there's also the pre-existing duty rule. If a party is doing something they're already obligated to do, that doesn't count as consideration. So if the manufacturer was already supposed to supply up to 10,000, and now they're agreeing to 15,000, is that a new obligation?

In this case, the original contract allows up to 10,000. So the producer is asking for more. The manufacturer's agreement to supply 15,000 is a new promise beyond their existing duty. So that would require consideration. But wait, what's the consideration here? The producer is agreeing to buy more boxes, but under the original contract, they could have bought up to 10,000. So the producer isn't really giving anything new; they're just increasing the quantity. Does that count as consideration?

Wait, another point: Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which applies to the sale of goods, modifications can be enforceable without consideration if the modification is in good faith. UCC ยง 2-209(1) says that an agreement modifying a contract within the statute of frauds (like a contract for goods over $500) doesn't require consideration to be enforceable if it's made in good faith.

So the original contract is for the sale of boxes, which are goods. So UCC applies. Therefore, the modification (increasing the number) doesn't need consideration as long as it's done in good faith.

But wait, the Statute of Frauds might come into play. The original contract is for up to 10,000 boxes a month. If the oral agreement is for 15,000, does that fall under the SOF? The SOF requires contracts for goods over $500 to be in writing. But since the original contract is already in writing and covers the terms, an oral modification might not need a new writing if it's a good faith modification under UCC 2-209.

So in this case, the oral agreement to increase the number is a modification. Since it's about goods, UCC applies. Therefore, the modification doesn't need consideration as long as it's in good faith. So the oral agreement should be enforceable.

Looking at the options:

Option F says it's enforceable because it's a modification of the written contract. That seems to align with what I thought about UCC allowing modifications without consideration.

Option D says enforceable because intentions were clear. That's also a possibility, but I think F is more precise because it's about the modification under UCC.

Option E says it's unenforceable due to lack of consideration. But under UCC, consideration isn't required for a good faith modification, so E would be incorrect.

Option A says it's unenforceable because the written contract is the final integration. But that's about the parol evidence rule, which isn't directly relevant here because this is a subsequent modification, not a prior agreement. So A is incorrect.

Option C is about the Statute of Frauds, but since the original contract was in writing and the modification is oral but under UCC, which allows it without a writing if in good faith, C is incorrect.

Option I says it's unenforceable because not in writing. But again, under UCC 2-209, it can be oral.

So the correct answer should be F: enforceable due to being a modification under UCC.
</think>

The question revolves around the enforceability of an oral modification to a written contract under contract law principles, specifically the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The original written contract between the producer and the manufacturer specified a maximum supply of 10,000 boxes per month. Later, the producer requested 15,000 boxes for the first month, and the manufacturer orally agreed. The issue is whether this oral modification is enforceable.

Under the UCC, which governs contracts for the sale of goods, modifications to a contract do not require consideration if they are made in good faith (UCC ยง 2-209(1)). The original written contract is for the sale of boxes, which are goods, so the UCC applies. The oral agreement to increase the number of boxes is a modification of the original contract. Since there is no indication of bad faith, the modification is enforceable under the UCC without requiring additional consideration.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The written contract is not the final integration because the oral modification is a subsequent agreement, not a prior or contemporaneous one, so the parol evidence rule does not apply.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The pre-existing duty rule is not relevant here because the manufacturer's agreement to supply 15,000 boxes constitutes a new obligation beyond the original contract.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The Statute of Frauds does not bar the oral modification because the original contract was in writing, and the UCC allows oral modifications in good faith.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the parties' intentions may be clear, this is not the primary reason for enforceability; the UCC's allowance for oral modifications is the key factor.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Under the UCC, consideration is not required for a good faith modification.
- **Option F**: Correct. The oral agreement is enforceable as a modification of the written contract under the UCC.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the manufacturer may have been motivated by a business advantage, this is not the legal basis for enforceability.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. This option is too vague and does not address the specific legal principles at play.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The oral modification is enforceable under the UCC, even without a written agreement.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The parol evidence rule is not applicable here.

The correct answer is **F**, as the oral modification is enforceable under the UCC due to the good faith modification rule.

Answer: F
