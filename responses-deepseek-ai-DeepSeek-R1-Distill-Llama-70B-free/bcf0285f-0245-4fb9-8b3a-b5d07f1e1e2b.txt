Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about Booth's 1901 study on poverty in London. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Charles Booth conducted a significant study on poverty in London in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work was influential in shaping social policies, especially concerning the poor. I think his research was detailed, involving data collection through interviews and observations.

Wait, Booth's study was actually conducted in two parts, I believe. The first was around 1889-1891, and then he did a follow-up around 1901 or so. Or maybe the exact years are a bit different. But the key point is that he categorized the population into different classes based on their economic conditions.

Booth categorized the population of London into eight classes. If I recall correctly, Classes A and B were the poorest. Class A was the "lowest class" of semi-criminal or loafers, and Class B were the very poor. The percentage in these classes combined would give the poverty rate.

I think in his initial study, around 1889-1891, he found that about 35% of London's population lived in poverty. But the question is about his 1901 study, so I need to be careful here. Did the percentage change in his later work?

Wait, I remember reading that in his 1901 study, the percentage of people living in poverty had decreased compared to his earlier findings. So if the first was around 35%, the second might be lower, perhaps in the mid to high 20s or so.

Looking at the options, the choices are from about 18% up to 35.8%. So the initial 35% is option A, but if the 1901 study showed a decrease, the answer would be lower than that.

I'm trying to recall specific numbers. I think in 1901, Booth's study indicated that about 25% of the population was still living in poverty. Wait, no, maybe it was a bit higher than that. Or perhaps it was around 30%? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the context. The initial study was in 1889-1891, and the follow-up was in 1901. If the first was 35%, and conditions improved a bit due to various social reforms, the 1901 figure might be lower. So perhaps around 25% to 28%?

Looking at the options, option C is 28.90%, which is close to 29%. Option B is 24.20%, which is about 24%. Option H is 25.40%, and option D is 27.50%.

Wait, I think the exact figure from Booth's 1901 study is around 25%. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about 30%, but that seems a bit high if there was improvement.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the 1901 study found that about 30% of London's population was still in poverty. But I'm not certain. Or perhaps it was 25%? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I can try to think of other sources or what I've read before. I believe that the initial figure was around 35%, and the later figure was lower, maybe around 25-28%. So looking at the options, 25.40% is option H, 27.50% is D, 28.90% is C.

I'm a bit torn between these. I think the correct figure is 25.4%, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it might be 30.7%, which is option G.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the percentages. Let me try to visualize the data. Booth's 1901 study found that about 25% were living in poverty. So that would correspond to option H, 25.40%.

Wait, but another part of my memory says that the figure was around 30%, so maybe option G is 30.70%. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1901 study showed that about 30% were in poverty, but I'm getting conflicting memories here. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, I think the correct answer is 30.7%, which is option G. Because I remember that in 1901, the percentage was still around 30%, which is a significant decrease from the initial 35%, but not as low as 25%.

Wait, but Booth's initial study in 1889-1891 found 35%, and then in 1901, he found that the percentage had decreased to around 25% due to improved conditions and social reforms. So maybe the correct answer is option H, 25.40%.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. I think I need to go with what I remember more clearly. I think the 1901 figure was around 25%, so option H, 25.40%. But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can think of the numbers. If the initial was 35.8% (option A), and the follow-up was lower, but not by a huge margin. So looking at the options, options around 25-28% are possible. Alternatively, some sources say that in 1901, Booth estimated that 25% were still in poverty.

I think I'll go with option H, 25.40%.

The question asks about the percentage of people living in poverty in London according to Booth's 1901 study. Charles Booth conducted influential research on poverty, categorizing the population into classes based on economic conditions. His initial study (1889-1891) found approximately 35% of London's population in poverty, but the 1901 study showed a decrease due to social reforms and improved conditions.

The options range from 18.60% to 35.80%, with several plausible choices around 25-30%. After considering the context of improved conditions and recalling that the 1901 figure was lower than the initial 35%, the most likely answer is 25.40%, corresponding to option H.

Answer: H
