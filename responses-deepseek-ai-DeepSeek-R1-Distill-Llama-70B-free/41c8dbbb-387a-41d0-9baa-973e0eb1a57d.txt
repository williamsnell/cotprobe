Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the total change in entropy when a sample of nitrogen gas undergoes an adiabatic reversible expansion. Let me break it down.

First, the problem states that the gas is nitrogen with a mass of 14 grams. I know the molar mass of nitrogen is about 28 grams per mole, so 14 grams would be 0.5 moles. That seems right because 14 is half of 28, so n = 0.5 mol.

The initial conditions are 298 K and 1.00 bar pressure. The process is an adiabatic reversible expansion where the volume doubles. I remember that in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings (Q=0), so the first law of thermodynamics (ΔU = Q + W) tells me that the work done is at the expense of the internal energy.

But wait, the question is about entropy change. I recall that for a reversible process, the change in entropy can be calculated using ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) when temperature is constant, but that's for isothermal processes. Or wait, no, actually, the formula might be ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1) for more general cases. But since the process is adiabatic and reversible, I think it's an isentropic process, meaning the entropy change is zero. Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, no, wait. If the process is reversible and adiabatic, then it's isentropic, so the entropy change of the system is zero. Because in reversible adiabatic processes, the system undergoes no entropy change. So the total change in entropy (system + surroundings) would be zero, but wait, no—wait, in that case, the surroundings' entropy change is also zero, because in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange, so the surroundings don't have any change. So the system’s entropy change is zero because it's a reversible adiabatic process. Therefore, the total entropy change is zero.

Wait, but am I mixing things up here? Let me think again. The entropy change for the system in a reversible adiabatic process is zero because dS = Q_rev/T, and Q is zero since it's adiabatic. So yes, ΔS_system = 0. And since the process is reversible, the surroundings don't have any entropy change either because any heat exchanged would be in a reversible way, but since Q=0 for the system, the surroundings also have Q=0. So the total entropy change is zero.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not confusing system and surroundings. The process is adiabatic and reversible, which implies that the entropy change of the system is zero. Because for a reversible process, the entropy change is calculated, and for adiabatic reversible, it's isentropic. So in this case, the system's entropy doesn't change. And since the surroundings aren't exchanging heat, their entropy change is also zero.

Wait, but another approach: let's think about the formula for entropy change when both temperature and volume change. The general formula for entropy change when both variables change is ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1). But for an adiabatic reversible process, we can relate T and V. The relation for adiabatic processes is TV^(γ-1) = constant, where γ is the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv). So for diatomic gas like nitrogen, γ is 7/5 or 1.4.

Wait, but in an adiabatic reversible expansion, the system does work, so the temperature should drop. So the volume increases, which would cause the temperature to decrease. Let me think about how that affects entropy.

Hmm, but wait, if I use the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) + nCv ln(T2/T1), but in an adiabatic process, Q=0, so for a reversible process, the entropy change ΔS would be zero because it's isentropic. So perhaps I don't need to calculate using that formula because it's a reversible adiabatic process, and the entropy change is zero.

So putting that together, the total change in entropy is zero. Looking at the options, option F is 0. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a moment. The question says, "the total change in entropy." Does that refer to the system plus the surroundings? In this case, the system's entropy change is zero because it's a reversible adiabatic process. The surroundings, since the process is adiabatic, don't exchange heat, so their entropy change is also zero. So total entropy change is zero.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is F: 0.

To calculate the total change in entropy for the given process, we analyze the scenario as follows:

1. **Process Description**: The problem involves an adiabatic reversible expansion of nitrogen gas. The gas expands such that its volume doubles. In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings (Q = 0). Additionally, the process is reversible, meaning it occurs isentropically.

2. **Entropy Change in the System**: For a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy change of the system is zero (ΔS_system = 0). This is because entropy change is defined as \( \Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T} \), and since \( Q = 0 \) in an adiabatic process, the system's entropy remains unchanged.

3. **Entropy Change in the Surroundings**: In an adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange between the system and the surroundings. Therefore, the surroundings also experience no entropy change (ΔS_surroundings = 0).

4. **Total Entropy Change**: The total entropy change is the sum of the entropy changes of the system and the surroundings. Since both are zero, the total entropy change is \( \Delta S_{\text{total}} = 0 \).

5. **Conclusion**: The total change in entropy for this adiabatic reversible expansion is zero. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

F: 0
