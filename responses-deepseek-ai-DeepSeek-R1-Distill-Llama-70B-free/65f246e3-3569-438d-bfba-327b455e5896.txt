Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about market structures, specifically comparing pure competition and monopolistic competition. It's asking whether a purely competitive market could turn into a monopolistically competitive one. And if that happens, why wouldn't the lower prices of pure competitors drive out the higher-priced monopolistic ones.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that pure competition is a market structure where many firms produce a homogeneous product. They have no market power, so they're price takers. Monopolistic competition, on the other hand, has many firms too, but they produce differentiated products. They have some pricing power because their products are unique, even if just a little.

So the first part of the question is whether pure competition could become monopolistic competition. I think that's possible because in pure competition, firms might try to differentiate their products to get ahead. If they start doing that, the market shifts towards monopolistic competition.

Now the second part: why wouldn't lower prices from pure competitors eliminate the higher-priced ones? Because in monopolistic competition, firms have product differentiation. Their products aren't the same, so even if some are priced higher, consumers might prefer them because of the unique features. So the pure competitors can't just drive them out because the products are different, and some consumers are willing to pay more for those differences.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the reason why higher-priced firms survive. The key is product differentiation. So the answer should relate to that.

Option B is "Introduction of product differentiation." That makes sense because once products are differentiated, firms can charge higher prices, and consumers choose based on preferences, not just price.

Other options don't fit as well. Option A is about marketing strategies, which might be part of it, but the core is differentiation. Option C, price wars, probably lead to lower prices, not higher. Option D is mergers, which would create monopoly, not monopolistic competition. E is increased costs, which would affect all firms perhaps. F is lower demand, which might reduce sales but not directly cause the shift. G is consumer preference for uniform products, which is the opposite of differentiation. H is collusion, which is more about oligopoly. I is market entry barriers, which can affect competition but not directly the differentiation. J is government regulations, which could influence structure but not directly cause differentiation.

So the correct answer should be B.

The question examines the transition from a purely competitive market to a monopolistically competitive one, focusing on why higher-priced monopolistic competitors might survive despite lower-priced pure competitors. In pure competition, firms produce homogeneous goods and act as price takers. However, firms may shift to monopolistic competition by differentiating their products. This differentiation allows them to charge higher prices because consumers value the unique features of their products, making them willing to pay more. Lower prices from pure competitors cannot drive out these differentiated firms because the products are no longer identical, and consumer preferences play a significant role.

Among the options, "Introduction of product differentiation" (Option B) is the correct answer, as it directly explains the mechanism by which higher-priced firms survive due to the unique appeal of their products.

Answer: B
