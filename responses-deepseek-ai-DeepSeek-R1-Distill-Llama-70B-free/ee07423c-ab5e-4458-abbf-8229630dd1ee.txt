Okay, so I have this problem about a discounted note, and I'm trying to figure out the proceeds. Let's see. The note is for $850, and it's a 3-month note with an interest rate of 6%. Then it's discounted at 6% a month after it was issued. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that when a note is discounted, it means the holder sells it before maturity at a discount. The discount is calculated based on the interest rate. So the proceeds would be the present value of the note.

The note's face value is $850, and it's a 3-month note. The discounting rate is 6% per annum, but wait, the problem says 6% a month. Oh, no, wait, the discounting is done at 6% a month. Wait, maybe the discount rate is 6% per annum, but sometimes people might use the same rate as the interest rate. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the note is bearing interest at 6%, which I think is the annual rate. So the annual interest rate is 6%. But when it's discounted a month later, I think the discount rate would be the same as the interest rate, or perhaps the same 6% per annum. Or is the discount rate 6% per month? That part's a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says it was discounted at 6% a month after it was issued. Oh, maybe the discount rate is 6% per annum, but the time since issuance is a month. So the discounting period is one month.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount rate is 6% per month. That would make a big difference because 6% per month is a lot higher than 6% per annum.

Wait, the note is for 3 months, so if it's a month after issuance, that leaves two months remaining until maturity. So the time factor is two months.

Wait, no. Wait, when the note is discounted a month after it was issued, it's being sold before maturity. So the time remaining is 2 months. So the discounting is for two months at 6% per annum or 6% per month.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The note has a 3-month term. It's being discounted a month after issuance, so the remaining time is 2 months until maturity. So to calculate the present value, I need to discount the maturity value (which is the face value plus interest) back by the remaining period at the given rate.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the present value is calculated as the face value plus the interest that would accrue over the remaining period, but discounted at the given rate.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up simple interest and discounting methods. Let's break it down.

The note is 3 months old, so it has 2 months left. The interest on the note would be calculated as simple interest, I think. The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where P is principal, r is rate, t is time in years.

But then, when the note is discounted, the proceeds are calculated as the present value. So the present value (PV) would be the maturity value (which is face value plus interest) divided by (1 + r * t), where r is the discount rate and t is the time remaining in years.

Wait, but wait, the note is being discounted at 6% a month. Oh, perhaps the discount rate is 6% per annum, but the time is one month. No, because the note was held for a month, so the discounting is for the remaining period. Or the discount rate is 6% per month? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount rate is the same as the note's interest rate, which is 6% per annum. So the discounting would be based on the remaining time at 6% annual.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. The note is for $850, 3 months, 6% interest. So the maturity value (what the holder would get at 3 months) is 850 plus interest.

Wait, actually, I think the note is a simple interest note, so the interest would be 850 * 0.06 * (3/12) = 850 * 0.06 * 0.25 = 850 * 0.015 = $12.75. So the maturity value is 850 + 12.75 = $862.75.

But wait, the note is being discounted a month after it was issued. So the holder has already held it for a month, so the remaining time is 2 months. So the question is, what is the present value of the note now, given that the remaining time is 2 months.

But at what rate is it being discounted? The problem says it's discounted at 6% a month. Wait, that can't be right because 6% per month is 72% per annum, which is very high. Alternatively, maybe it's 6% annual, and the time is 2 months, which is 2/12 = 1/6 of a year.

Wait, perhaps the discounting rate is 6% per annum, so the discount factor would be (1 + 0.06 * (2/12)).

Let me calculate that. 2/12 is 1/6, so 0.06*(1/6)=0.01. So the discount factor is 1.01.

The present value would be the maturity value divided by 1.01.

Wait, no. Wait, the maturity value is $862.75, which is what the note will pay in 3 months. But when we discount it after one month, the remaining period is two months. So the present value is the amount that, when invested at the discount rate for two months, will grow to $862.75.

So PV = FV / (1 + r * t), where FV is $862.75, r is 6% per annum, t is 2/12 = 1/6.

So r*t = 0.06*(1/6) =0.01. So denominator is 1.01.

So PV = 862.75 / 1.01.

Let me compute that. 862.75 divided by 1.01.

Hmm, 1.01 times 850 is 855.5. Let's see: 1.01 * 850 = 850 + 8.5 = 858.5. Wait, no, 850 * 1.01 is 850 + (850 * 0.01)= 850 + 8.5 = 858.50.

Wait, but 862.75 divided by 1.01 is approximately 854.12.

Wait, let me check: 1.01 times 854.12 would be 862.75.

Yes, because 854.12 * 0.01 is 8.5412, so 854.12 +8.5412=862.6612, which is approximately 862.75, considering rounding.

So the present value would be approximately $854.12. Looking at the options, option E is $854.12.

Wait, but wait. Did I compute the interest correctly?

Alternatively, perhaps the note is being discounted at 6% per month, which would be a much higher rate. Let me see.

Wait, the problem states it's discounted at 6% a month after being issued. Oh, perhaps the discounting rate is 6% per month, meaning 6% per month.

In that case, the remaining time is 2 months, so the discount factor is (1 + 0.06)^2.

Wait, but that would be a high rate. Let me compute that.

FV is $862.75, as before. PV = 862.75 / (1.06)^2.

Compute 1.06 squared: 1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236.

So 862.75 / 1.1236 ≈ let's see. Let's compute 862.75 / 1.1236.

Approximately, 862.75 divided by 1.1236.

Let me compute this step by step. 

First, 1.1236 times 770 is approximately 770*1=770, 770*0.12=92.4, 770*0.0036≈2.77. So total ≈770+92.4+2.77=865.17. That's higher than 862.75, so perhaps the PV is lower than 770.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 862.75 / 1.1236.

Using a calculator approach:

1.1236 * 767 = let's see:

767 * 1 = 767.

767 * 0.12 = 92.04.

767 *0.0036≈2.765.

So total≈767 +92.04=859.04 +2.765=861.805.

That's very close to 862.75. So 767 would give approximately 861.805.

The difference is 862.75 -861.805=0.945.

So 0.945 /1.1236≈0.842.

So total is approximately 767.842, so about $767.84 when rounded. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the discount rate is 6% per month.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounting is done at 6% annual, but for one month. Wait, the note was held for a month, so the discounting is for the remaining two months.

Wait, maybe the discount rate is 6% per annum, so the rate for two months is 6% * (2/12) = 1%.

So the discount factor is 1.01.

So present value is 862.75 / 1.01 ≈ 854.12, which is option E.

Alternatively, another approach: The note was issued for 3 months at 6% interest. After one month, the holder wants to discount it. So the interest accrued in the first month is 850 * 0.06 * (1/12) = 850 *0.005= $4.25. So the holder has accrued $4.25 in interest. But when discounting, perhaps the present value is calculated on the remaining amount.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up different methods. Let me think about this again.

Another approach: The note's face value is $850, and it's a 3-month note with 6% interest. So when issued, the maturity value is 850 + (850 * 6% * 3/12) = 850 + 12.75 = $862.75.

Now, after one month, the holder has the right to the remaining two months' interest. So the present value of that would be calculated by discounting the $862.75 at the discount rate for two months.

But the discount rate is given as 6% a month, which is 6% per month, or 72% per annum. That would make the present value much lower, but none of the options seem to match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounting is done at 6% annual, so for two months, it's 6% * (2/12) = 1%, so discount factor is 1.01.

So present value is 862.75 /1.01 ≈ 854.12, which is option E.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making any mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the proceeds are calculated as the present value of the note using the discount rate.

Wait, another way: the proceeds from discounting the note would be the present value of the face value plus the interest that hasn't been accrued yet.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try to outline the steps clearly.

1. The note is for 3 months (90 days), with face value $850, interest at 6% per annum.

2. One month has passed since issuance, so the remaining time is 2 months.

3. The note is now being discounted at a rate of 6% per annum. So the discounting rate is 6% annual, but the time is 2 months, which is 2/12 = 1/6 of a year.

4. The maturity value (FV) is $850 plus interest for 3 months: 850 * 0.06 * (3/12) = 850 *0.015= $12.75. So FV is 862.75.

5. The present value (PV) is FV / (1 + r*t), where r=0.06, t=2/12=1/6.

So t=1/6, so r*t=0.06*(1/6)=0.01.

So denominator is 1.01.

So PV=862.75 /1.01= approximately 854.12.

Looking at the options, that's option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounting is done at 6% per month, which would be 0.06 per month. Then t=2 months, so r*t=0.12. So denominator is 1.12.

Then PV=862.75 /1.12= let's compute that.

862.75 divided by 1.12.

Well, 1.12 times 770 is 770 + 770*0.12 =770+92.4=862.4. Close to 862.75.

So 770 gives 862.4, so 770 + (0.35/1.12) ≈770.31.

So about $770.31, which isn't one of the options. So this approach might not be correct.

Therefore, I think the correct approach is to use the annual rate, leading to option E, $854.12.

To determine the proceeds from discounting the note, we need to calculate the present value of the note after one month, given the remaining term of two months. The note has a face value of $850, an annual interest rate of 6%, and is discounted at an annual rate of 6%. The remaining time is 2 months, which is \( t = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \) years.

1. **Calculate the maturity value (FV):**  
   The maturity value is the sum of the face value and the interest accrued over the full 3-month term.  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = P \cdot r \cdot t = 850 \cdot 0.06 \cdot \frac{3}{12} = 12.75
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Maturity Value} = 850 + 12.75 = 862.75
   \]

2. **Calculate the present value (PV):**  
   The present value is the maturity value discounted back to the present at the given annual rate of 6% for the remaining 2 months.  
   \[
   \text{Discount Factor} = 1 + r \cdot t = 1 + 0.06 \cdot \frac{2}{12} = 1.01
   \]  
   \[
   \text{PV} = \frac{\text{FV}}{\text{Discount Factor}} = \frac{862.75}{1.01} \approx 854.12
   \]

Thus, the proceeds from discounting the note are approximately **$854.12**.

**Critical analysis of options:**  
- Option E ($854.12) matches the calculated present value.  
- Other options do not align with the calculations, particularly if the discount rate were incorrectly interpreted as 6% per month (which would result in a much lower value, inconsistent with the options provided).

The correct answer is **E: $854.12**.
