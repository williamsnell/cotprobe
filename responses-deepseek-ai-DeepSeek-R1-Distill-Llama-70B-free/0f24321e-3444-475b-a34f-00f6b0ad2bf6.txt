Okay, so I have this question about a voltmeter's accuracy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a voltmeter ranges from 0 to 100 volts and has a guaranteed accuracy of 2% of the full scale reading. The measured voltage is 75 volts, and we need to find the limiting error in percentage. The options are from A to J, each with different percentages.

Hmm, I remember that when a device has an accuracy specified as a percentage of full scale, that percentage is based on the maximum value it can measure. So in this case, the full scale is 100 volts. The guaranteed accuracy is 2% of that full scale. 

Wait, but when they say the limiting error is in percentage, I think they might be referring to the percentage of the reading, not the full scale. Or is it? No, wait, sometimes the error is given as a percentage of the full scale, which is fixed. So for example, 2% of 100 volts is 2 volts. That would be the maximum error possible, regardless of the actual reading. So if the voltmeter reads 75 volts, the error could be up to 2 volts above or below.

But the question is asking for the limiting error in percentage, relative to the measured value, I think. Oh wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says the voltage measured is 75 V, and asks for the limiting error as a percentage. So I think the error is calculated based on the reading, not the full scale. Because 2% of full scale is 2 volts, which is a 2% error of 100 V. But when the reading is 75 V, what's the percentage error based on that reading?

So the maximum error (limiting error) is 2 volts. So the percentage error relative to the measured value (75 V) would be (2/75) * 100%. Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 75 is approximately 0.026666..., which is about 2.666...%. So that would be 2.666% as the error percentage relative to the measured value.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.66%, which matches my calculation. Another option is E, which is 2%, but that's the percentage of the full scale, not the reading. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes, the question might be asking for the percentage error relative to full scale, but the question specifically says the limiting error is in percentage. Oh, but wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem again.

The question states: The limiting error is in percentage. So perhaps it's the error expressed as a percentage of the measured value. Because the measured value is 75 V, the error is 2 V, so (2/75)*100% is about 2.66%.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is B: 2.66%.
</think>

The voltmeter has a full-scale range of 0 to 100 V, with a guaranteed accuracy of 2% of full scale. This means the maximum possible error is 2% of 100 V, which equals 2 V. When the measured voltage is 75 V, the limiting error as a percentage of the measured value is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Error}}{\text{Measured Value}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{75} \right) \times 100 \approx 2.66\%.
\]

Thus, the limiting error in percentage is **2.66%**, which corresponds to option **B**.

B
