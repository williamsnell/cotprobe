Okay, so I have this problem about calculating various thermodynamic quantities for a substance. The question gives me some data, and I need to compute the enthalpy of vaporization, fusion, sublimation, and the vapor pressure at the triple point. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, let's jot down the given data. The molecular weight (M) is 60 g/mol. The critical temperature (Tc) is 400°C, which I think is 673 K (since I have to convert Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273). The normal melting point (T_m) is 15.000°C, and the triple point melting point is 14.980°C. Wait, the triple point is where solid, liquid, and gas coexist. The solid and liquid densities are 0.85 g/cc and 0.80 g/cc, respectively.

I remember that the triple point has its own vapor pressure, which is lower than the normal boiling point. So part d is about finding that vapor pressure.

But first, the problem is divided into four parts: a) ΔHvap, b) ΔHfus, c) ΔHsub, and d) vapor pressure at triple point.

Wait, wait. Actually, looking back, the problem states: a is ΔHvap, b is ΔH_s (maybe fusion?), c is ΔH_f, and d the vapor pressure. Oh, wait, maybe the letters are miswritten. Let me check the original question again.

Ah, the question says: a) ΔH_vap, b) ΔH_s, c) ΔH_f, d) the vapor pressure. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because usually, the subscript s would be solid related, maybe sublimation, and f for fusion. Or perhaps it's a typo and they meant fusion for b and sublimation for c. I'll have to clarify.

Wait, the standard terms are ΔHvap (vaporization), ΔHfus (fusion, melting), and ΔHsub (sublimation, solid to gas). So in the question, part b is ΔH_s, which I think is ΔH_fusion (melting). Part c is ΔH_f, which is unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and part c is ΔH_sub (sublimation). Or perhaps part c is the standard enthalpy of formation, but that's probably unrelated here. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed and see.

I think the problem is as follows:

a) Enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) - liquid to gas.

b) Enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus) - solid to liquid.

c) Enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) - solid to gas, which would be the sum of ΔHfus and ΔHvap.

Wait, because sublimation is solid → gas, which can be thought of as solid → liquid → gas. So ΔHsub = ΔHfus + ΔHvap.

But then, the question's parts are a, b, c, d. So perhaps part c is ΔHsub.

Alternatively, maybe part c is the enthalpy of fusion, but that's same as part b. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

Now, to compute these values, I think I'll need to use some thermodynamic equations, probably the Clausius-Clapeyron equation or similar.

Wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the change in vapor pressure with temperature to the enthalpy of vaporization. The equation is usually written as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). But in this problem, I don't have pressure data except at the triple point. Hmm, perhaps that's for part d.

Wait, but the triple point's vapor pressure is given in the options, so maybe I can compute it using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation if I know the normal boiling point and the critical temperature.

Wait, let me think. The normal boiling point is where the vapor pressure equals 1 atm. The critical temperature is the temperature above which the liquid cannot exist, regardless of pressure. So, perhaps I can use the critical temperature to find ΔHvap.

Alternatively, I remember that at the critical point, the latent heat of vaporization becomes zero, but I'm not sure how that helps here.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the heat of vaporization can be estimated using the formula:

ΔHvap = (R Tc / 2) * ( (1 - (T_triple / Tc)) )

No, wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, there's a rule of thumb that ΔHvap ≈ 1.4 R Tc for nonpolar substances, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, another approach: The normal boiling point (Tb) is given by the temperature where the vapor pressure equals 1 atm. Using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation between the triple point and the normal boiling point could let me compute ΔHvap.

But wait, do I know the vapor pressure at the triple point? The problem doesn't give it directly; that's part d of the question. So maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the melting points at normal conditions and at the triple point to find ΔHfus.

Wait, the normal melting point is 15.000°C, which is 288.15 K. The triple point's melting point is 14.980°C, which is 288.13 K. The difference is 0.02 K. So the melting point drops by 0.02 K at the triple point, which has a lower pressure than 1 atm.

Wait, wait, because at the triple point, the pressure is lower, the melting point would change. The melting point can be affected by pressure, according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for solid-liquid transitions.

The equation for the slope of the melting curve is dP/dT = (ΔHfus / T) * (1 / (Vliquid - Vsolid)).

Rearranged, this gives dT/dP = (T (Vliquid - Vsolid)) / ΔHfus.

Wait, but since I know the change in melting temperature (ΔT) and the change in pressure (from 1 atm to the triple point pressure), perhaps I can compute ΔHfus.

But I don't know the triple point pressure yet. Hmm, that's part d. So maybe I have to approach this in a different order.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the change in volume upon melting (ΔV = Vliquid - Vsolid) using the densities.

Density is mass/volume, so specific volume (volume per unit mass) is inverse of density. Let me compute that.

Solid density ρ_s = 0.85 g/cm³. So specific volume v_s = 1/ρ_s = 1/0.85 cm³/g ≈ 1.17647 cm³/g.

Liquid density ρ_l = 0.80 g/cm³. So v_l = 1/0.80 = 1.25 cm³/g.

So ΔV = v_l - v_s = 1.25 - 1.17647 = 0.07353 cm³/g.

But wait, since we're dealing with molar quantities, we need to multiply by molecular weight to get molar volume change.

Molecular weight M = 60 g/mol, so ΔV_molar = 0.07353 cm³/g * 60 g/mol = 4.4118 cm³/mol.

Wait, but 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 4.4118 cm³/mol = 4.4118e-6 m³/mol.

But perhaps I can keep units in cm³ for now, as long as I'm consistent.

Now, the change in melting temperature (ΔT) from normal pressure (1 atm) to triple point is T_m_normal - T_triple = 15.000 - 14.980 = 0.02°C, which is 0.02 K.

Wait, but we need to find the change in pressure (ΔP) that causes this ΔT. Since at normal pressure, the melting point is 15.000°C, and at triple point, it's 14.980°C. So the pressure is lower at the triple point, causing the melting point to drop.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for the solid-liquid transition. The equation is:

dP/dT = (ΔHfus) / (T (V_l - V_s)).

We can approximate ΔT for a small change in P, assuming ΔHfus and ΔV are constant over the temperature and pressure range (which is reasonable for small changes).

So, rearranging,

ΔP ≈ (ΔHfus / (T (ΔV))) * ΔT.

Wait, no, because dP = (ΔHfus / (T ΔV)) dT.

Wait, actually, integrating from T1 to T2 and P1 to P2:

ΔHfus / (T ΔV) = dP/dT.

Assuming ΔHfus and ΔV are constant, then integrating from T1, P1 to T2, P2:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHfus / (ΔV)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing this up with the vapor case. Let's think again.

Wait, the correct form for the solid-liquid transition is:

( dP / dT )_{sl} = ( ΔHfus ) / ( T ( V_l - V_s ) )

Which can be rearranged as:

dP = (ΔHfus / (T (V_l - V_s))) dT.

So, over a small temperature change ΔT, the pressure change ΔP is approximately:

ΔP ≈ (ΔHfus / (T (V_l - V_s))) ) * ΔT.

We know ΔT is T_triple - T_normal = 14.980°C - 15.000°C = -0.02°C = -0.02 K.

Wait, the triple point is at a lower temperature than the normal melting point, which suggests that the pressure is lower than 1 atm (since lowering pressure can lower the melting point for some substances, depending on whether the substance expands upon freezing).

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: when you lower the pressure, does the melting point increase or decrease?

It depends on whether the substance expands or contracts upon freezing. If the substance contracts upon freezing (i.e., liquid has higher volume than solid), then according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, if V_l > V_s, then (V_l - V_s) is positive.

So, if V_l > V_s, then dP/dT is positive if ΔHfus is positive. So, higher pressure favors the phase with lower volume. So, if you increase pressure, the melting point increases if V_l > V_s.

Wait, in this case, our V_l is greater than V_s (since v_l = 1.25 cm³/g and v_s = 1.176 cm³/g), so V_l > V_s. So, if pressure increases, melting point increases.

So, if at lower pressure, the melting point is lower. So, the triple point, which is at a lower pressure than 1 atm, has a lower melting point than the normal melting point. Which aligns with the given data: normal is 15.000°C, triple point is 14.980°C.

So, the change in temperature is ΔT = T_triple - T_normal = -0.02 K.

The corresponding change in pressure is ΔP = P_triple - P_normal.

We know P_normal is 1 atm, so ΔP = P_triple - 1 atm.

But we can write:

ΔP ≈ (ΔHfus / (T (V_l - V_s))) ) * ΔT.

We can plug in the known values:

ΔT = -0.02 K.

V_l - V_s = 0.07353 cm³/g * 60 g/mol = 4.4118 cm³/mol.

Wait, that's 4.4118 cm³/mol. To convert to m³/mol, it's 4.4118e-6 m³/mol.

But maybe let's work in cm³ for simplicity, since units might cancel.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, so maybe I should convert ΔV to m³.

So, 4.4118 cm³/mol = 4.4118e-6 m³/mol.

ΔHfus is what we're trying to find.

So, rearranging the equation to solve for ΔHfus:

ΔHfus = (ΔP * T * (V_l - V_s)) / ΔT.

But wait, since ΔT is negative, and ΔP is also negative (since P_triple is less than 1 atm), the negatives would cancel.

But wait, I don't know P_triple yet. Hmm, but part d is to find P_triple, so perhaps I can't proceed that way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that at the triple point, the vapor pressure is P_triple, and that the enthalpy of sublimation can be calculated from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation between the triple point and the normal boiling point.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck because I don't know enough variables. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the latent heat formula. Oh, wait, another way to get ΔHvap is using the formula:

ΔHvap = (R * Tc) * (1 - ln(2)) ≈ R * Tc * 0.693.

Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. I think this might be an approximation or a rule of thumb for estimating ΔHvap when the critical temperature is known.

Given that Tc is 400°C, which is 673 K.

So, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So, ΔHvap ≈ 8.314 * 673 * 0.693.

Let me calculate that:

8.314 * 673 ≈ 8.314 * 600 = 4988.4, 8.314*73 = approx 607, so total around 5595 J/mol. Multiply by 0.693: 5595 * 0.693 ≈ 3876 J/mol, which is about 3.876 kJ/mol. Wait, that can't be right because the options are in kcal, and 3.876 kJ is about 0.925 kcal, which is way lower than any of the options. So maybe that formula isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach. Let me think about the Antoine equation, which relates vapor pressure to temperature. But I don't have enough data points for that.

Wait, another thought: at the normal boiling point, the vapor pressure is 1 atm. The critical temperature is 400°C (673 K). I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation between the triple point and the normal boiling point to find ΔHvap.

Wait, but I don't know the triple point's vapor pressure yet. However, part d asks for that. Maybe I can find ΔHvap first using another method, then use it to find the vapor pressure at the triple point.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relationship between the latent heat and the critical temperature. Another approach is to use the fact that at the critical point, the latent heat of vaporization is zero, but I'm not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that ΔHvap ≈ (8.314 * Tc) / (0.693) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard of the Watson equation, which estimates ΔHvap based on Tc and the normal boiling point.

The Watson equation is:

ΔHvap = 8.314 * Tc * (1 - (Tb / Tc))^(0.38)

Where Tb is the normal boiling point, and Tc is the critical temperature.

Wait, let me test this. Here, Tb is the normal boiling point, which I don't know. Wait, no, the normal melting point is given, not the boiling point. Hmm, maybe that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the data I have. The molecular weight is 60 g/mol, which is useful for calculating molar volumes.

Wait, going back to part b, ΔHfus. I have the change in melting point with pressure, which can be used with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for solid-liquid transitions.

The equation is:

ΔT = (T (V_l - V_s) / ΔHfus) * ΔP

We can rearrange to solve for ΔHfus:

ΔHfus = (T (V_l - V_s) * ΔP) / ΔT

But I don't know ΔP, which is P_triple - 1 atm. Since P_triple is what I'm trying to find in part d, this seems like a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the vapor pressure at the triple point first, then use that to find ΔHfus. But I don't know how.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that at the triple point, the vapor pressure corresponds to the melting point under that pressure, and from that, use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find ΔHvap.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me consider the options given. They include values for ΔHvap around 7-10 kcal/mol, which is 29-42 kJ/mol. That makes sense because ΔHvap for water is about 40 kJ/mol, but for other substances, it varies.

Wait, let me try to compute ΔHvap using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation between the triple point and the normal boiling point.

Wait, but I don't have the normal boiling point. The problem gives the normal melting point as 15°C and triple point as 14.98°C. But the normal boiling point isn't provided. Hmm, perhaps I can estimate it using the critical temperature.

Wait, the critical temperature is 400°C, which is much higher than the normal melting point. So the normal boiling point would be somewhere between 15°C and 400°C, but without more data, it's hard to say. Maybe this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the change in Gibbs free energy at the triple point and set it to zero for the three phases coexisting.

Wait, at the triple point, the chemical potentials are equal for solid, liquid, and gas. So, for solid and liquid, the difference in Gibbs free energy is zero.

But I'm not sure how to apply that here without more data.

Wait, perhaps I should switch focus to part d
