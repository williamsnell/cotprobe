Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a honeybee and a pollen grain. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the problem says the honeybee is a sphere with a diameter of 1.000 cm and has a charge of +45.0 pC uniformly spread on its surface. Then there's a pollen grain, which is also spherical, with a diameter of 40.0 micrometers. The pollen is held on the bee's surface because the bee's charge induces a charge on the pollen. Specifically, the near side of the pollen gets -1.00 pC and the far side +1.00 pC. The question is asking for the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on the grain due to the bee. The options are given from A to J.

So, I think I remember that when a charged object induces charges on another object, it's called polarization or induction. In this case, the bee's positive charge is causing the pollen grain to have opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side. But wait, the problem states the induced charges as -1 pC on the near and +1 pC on the far. So the net charge on the pollen would be zero? Because -1 +1 =0. Oh, right, but that's just the induced charges; the actual charge of the pollen isn't given, but perhaps it's neutral overall except for these induced charges.

Wait, no, the problem says the bee's charge induces these charges on the pollen. So the pollen must have been neutral before, and now it has these induced charges. So the net charge on the pollen is indeed zero. So the charges are +1 and -1, but their sum is zero.

But how does this relate to the force? I'm a bit confused. The bee is positively charged, so the near side of the pollen is negative, which would attract the bee. The far side is positive, which would repel the bee. But since the charges are induced, the force on the pollen would be the sum of the forces from the bee's charge on each of the induced charges.

Wait, but the bee is a sphere with a uniform charge distribution. So the electric field from the bee at the location of the pollen would be important. Let me think about how the charges are arranged.

The bee has a charge of +45 pC. The pollen is on its surface. So the distance between the centers of the bee and the pollen would be the sum of their radii. Wait, the bee has a diameter of 1.000 cm, so radius is 0.5 cm, which is 5 mm or 5e-3 meters. The pollen has a diameter of 40 micrometers, which is 40e-6 meters, so radius 20e-6 m. So the separation between centers is 5e-3 m + 20e-6 m = 5.02e-3 m approximately. Hmm, but maybe the exact separation isn't needed because the size of the pollen is much smaller than the bee. So perhaps we can model this as charges in an external electric field.

Wait, but the problem says the bee's charge induces charges on the pollen. So the bee's electric field at the location of the pollen would cause the charges on the pollen to separate. So the pollen's dipole is formed due to the bee's field.

But the problem gives the induced charges as -1 pC and +1 pC. So the dipole moment of the pollen would be the product of the charge and the separation between them. The separation is the diameter of the pollen, which is 40 micrometers or 40e-6 m. So the dipole moment p is q*d, where q is 1e-12 C (since 1 pC is 1e-12 C) and d is 40e-6 m. So p = (1e-12 C) * (40e-6 m) = 4e-17 C·m.

Wait, but the force on a dipole in an external electric field is given by F = p * E, where E is the electric field strength. But wait, actually, the force on a dipole is F = q * E, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the net force on a dipole in a uniform field is zero because the forces on the two charges are equal and opposite. But if the field is non-uniform, then there's a net force.

Wait, the bee's electric field at the location of the pollen isn't uniform, especially because the pollen isn't a point charge. So maybe we can model it as the two charges on the pollen experiencing forces due to the bee's field, and the net force being the sum of those two.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the electric field from the bee at the location of the pollen grain. Then, since the pollen grain has charges +1 pC and -1 pC, each at a distance of 20 micrometers from the center of the pollen. But wait, the bee's field varies with distance, so the field at the near end of the pollen is stronger than at the far end.

Wait, the electric field from a point charge (or a uniformly charged sphere, which acts as a point charge at external points) is E = kQ / r². But the pollen is on the surface of the bee, so the distance from the bee's center to the pollen's center is r = R_bee + R_pollen. As I calculated earlier, that's 5e-3 m + 20e-6 m = 0.00502 m.

So the electric field at the center of the pollen due to the bee is E = (k * Q_bee) / r². Let's compute that. k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C², Q_bee is 45 pC which is 45e-12 C, and r is 0.00502 m.

So E = (8.988e9) * (45e-12) / (0.00502)^2.

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 45e-12 C is 4.5e-11 C. So 8.988e9 * 4.5e-11 = let's compute 8.988 *4.5 = approx 40.46, and the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-11 = 1e-2. So 40.46e-2 = 0.4046.

Then divide by (0.00502)^2. 0.00502 squared is (5.02e-3)^2 = about 25.2e-6 or 2.52e-5.

So E = 0.4046 / 2.52e-5. Let's compute that. 0.4046 divided by 2.52e-5 is approximately 0.4046 / 0.0000252 = let's see, 0.4046 / 2.52e-5 ≈ 16050 N/C. Wait, that's about 1.6e4 N/C.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 0.00502 meters is 5.02 mm. So (0.00502)^2 = (5.02)^2 * 1e-6 = approx 25.2 *1e-6 = 2.52e-5 m².

So 0.4046 divided by 2.52e-5 is 0.4046 / 0.0000252. Let me compute 0.4046 / 0.0000252.

Well, 0.0000252 is 2.52e-5. So 0.4046 / 2.52e-5 = 0.4046 * (1 / 2.52e-5) = 0.4046 * approx 39683 (since 1/2.52e-5 is about 39683).

0.4046 * 39683 ≈ let's compute 0.4 *39683 = 15873.2, and 0.0046 *39683 ≈ 182. So total is about 16055 N/C.

So E ≈ 1.6055e4 N/C.

But this is the electric field at the center of the pollen due to the bee. Now, the pollen has a diameter of 40 micrometers, so each end is 20 micrometers from the center. So the near end of the pollen is 20e-6 m closer to the bee, and the far end is 20e-6 m farther away.

So the electric field from the bee at the near end of the pollen would be E_near = k Q_bee / (r - d)^2, where d is 20e-6 m. Similarly, E_far = k Q_bee / (r + d)^2.

Wait, r is the distance from bee's center to pollen center, so when you go 20e-6 m towards the bee, the distance is r - d, and when you go 20e-6 m away, it's r + d.

But wait, our initial r is 0.00502 m, which is 5.02e-3 m, and d is 20e-6 m, which is 0.00002 m. So r is much larger than d, so perhaps we can approximate the electric fields at the near and far ends using a Taylor expansion or binomial approximation.

Alternatively, let's compute E_near and E_far exactly.

First, E_near = k Q_bee / (r - d)^2.

r is 0.00502 m, d is 0.00002 m.

r - d = 0.00500 m.

E_near = (8.988e9) * (45e-12) / (0.00500)^2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *45e-12 = same as before, 0.4046.

Denominator: (0.005)^2 = 0.000025.

So E_near = 0.4046 / 0.000025 = 16184 N/C.

Similarly, E_far = (8.988e9 *45e-12) / (0.00504)^2.

Wait, r + d = 0.00502 + 0.00002 = 0.00504 m.

So (0.00504)^2 = (5.04e-3)^2 = approx 25.4016e-6 m² = 2.54016e-5 m².

So E_far = 0.4046 / 2.54016e-5.

0.4046 / 0.0000254016 ≈ Let's compute that.

Approximate 0.4046 / 0.0000254 = 0.4046 / 2.54e-5.

0.4046 / 2.54e-5 = (0.4046 / 2.54) * 1e5.

0.4046 / 2.54 ≈ 0.1593.

So 0.1593 * 1e5 = 15930 N/C.

So E_near ≈ 16184 N/C, E_far ≈ 15930 N/C.

The electric field at the near end is a bit stronger than at the far end.

Now, the charges on the pollen are -1 pC at the near end and +1 pC at the far end. So each charge experiences a force due to the bee's electric field.

The force on a charge is F = q * E.

So F_near = (-1e-12 C) * E_near.

Similarly, F_far = (+1e-12 C) * E_far.

Wait, the direction matters. Let's think about the directions. The bee is positively charged, so the electric field points away from it. At the near end of the pollen, the field is pointing away (since it's the same direction as the bee's field). The near end has a negative charge, so the force would be opposite to the field. So F_near would be towards the bee (since negative charge is attracted to the positive bee). Similarly, the far end is positive, so the force would be in the same direction as the field, which is away from the bee, so F_far is away from the bee.

Wait, but wait, the bee's electric field at any point is radially outward because the bee is positively charged. So at the near end of the pollen, the field is pointing towards the bee's surface. Wait, no, wait: the bee's field at a point is away from the bee because it's positive. So at the near end of the pollen (which is on the surface of the bee), the field is pointing away from the bee, towards the pollen. Wait, no, no, the bee's field is away from itself. So at the near end of the pollen (which is the point closest to the bee), the electric field direction is pointing towards the bee's center, because that's the direction away from the bee's surface. Wait, no, wait: the bee is a positively charged sphere. The electric field lines go radially outward. So at a point near the surface of the bee, the field points away from the surface. So for the pollen grain on the bee's surface, the near end is the point closest to the bee's center, so the field at the near end is pointing towards the bee's center. Wait, no, that's not correct. Electric field lines go away from positive charges. So at the surface of the bee, the field points radially outward, away from the bee. So for the pollen grain attached to the bee's surface, the near end is the part of the grain closest to the bee's center. So the electric field at the near end (a point on the grain's surface near the bee) is pointing away from the bee, i.e., towards the far end of the grain.

Wait, perhaps I should draw a diagram mentally. The bee has positive charge, so field lines go out. The pollen is on the bee's surface, so the near end of the pollen is the point closest to the bee's center. The electric field at that point due to the bee is pointing directly away from the bee, so in the direction from the near end of the pollen towards the far end.

So for the near charge (-1 pC), the force is F = q * E. Since E is pointing away from the bee, and q is negative, the force on the near charge is opposite to E, so towards the bee.

Similarly, the far end has +1 pC. The electric field at the far end is also pointing away from the bee (since the bee's field lines are radial outward everywhere). So the force on the far charge is in the same direction as E. So the force on the far charge is away from the bee.

Wait, but wait, the electric field at the far end of the pollen is due to the bee. At that point, the field is still pointing away from the bee, so the force on the +1 pC charge is in that same direction, away from the bee.

So the forces on the two charges are in opposite directions relative to the pollen grain. The near charge experiences a force towards the bee, and the far charge experiences a force away from the bee.

Wait, but the net force on the pollen would be the sum of these two forces. Let's compute their magnitudes and directions.

F_near = (-1e-12 C) * E_near (which is pointing away from the bee, so F_near is towards the bee).

F_far = (+1e-12 C) * E_far (pointing away, so F_far is away from the bee).

So the net force is F_net = F_far - F_near (since F_near is towards, which we can consider negative if we take away as positive direction).

Wait, let's assign a coordinate system: let's say the direction away from the bee is positive. Then, F_near is negative because it's towards the bee, and F_far is positive.

So F_net = F_far + F_near.

Wait, no. Because F_near is the force on the near charge, which is (-1e-12 C) * E_near. Since E_near is pointing away (positive direction), F_near would be (-1e-12) * E_near, which is negative. Similarly, F_far is (+1e-12) * E_far, which is positive.

So F_net = F_far + F_near = (1e-12 * E_far) + (-1e-12 * E_near) = 1e-12 (E_far - E_near).

Wait, because F_far is positive and F_near is negative. So F_net is (E_far - E_near) multiplied by 1e-12.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. E_far is about 15930 N/C, E_near is about 16184 N/C.

So E_far - E_near = 15930 - 16184 = -254 N/C.

So F_net = 1e-12 C * (-254 N/C) = -254e-12 N = -2.54e-10 N.

The negative sign indicates that the net force is in the negative direction, which is towards the bee. So the magnitude is 2.54e-10 N.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A: 5.2e-10 N

B:7.2e-10

C:4.5e-11

D:6.5e-10

E:8.1e-10

F:3.9e-10

G:9.8e-11

H:2.6e-10

I:1.3e-10

J:1.1e-9

Hmm, my calculation gives 2.54e-10 N, which isn't exactly among the options. The closest is option H: 2.6e-10 N. Alternatively, perhaps my approximations have caused some error. Let me recheck the calculations with more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating E. Let's recalculate E precisely.

E = (k Q_bee) / r².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Q_bee = 45 pC = 45e-12 C.

r is 5.02e-3 m.

So E_center = (8.988e9) * (45e-12) / (5.02e-3)^2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 45e-12 = 8.988 * 45 * 1e-3.

8.988 *45 = let's compute 8 *45 =360, 0.988 *45≈44.46. So total ≈404.46. So 404.46e-3 = 0.40446.

Denominator: (5.02e-3)^2 = (5.02)^2 * 1e-6 = 25.2004 *1e-6 = 2.
