Okay, so I've got this problem here about John Backus paying the bank a certain amount, and I need to find out how much he borrowed. Let me try to break this down.

The problem says John Backus will pay the Third National Bank $342.65 on July 1st, and the interest is $17.25. I'm supposed to find the amount he borrowed. Hmm, so I think this is a simple interest problem. 

Wait, simple interest formula is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal (the amount borrowed), r is the rate, and t is the time. But wait, in this problem, I don't know the rate or the time. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. 

Wait, another approach: when you borrow money, you pay back the principal plus the interest. So the total payment (the amount he's paying) is equal to the principal plus the interest. So total payment = principal + interest.

Oh, that makes sense! So in this case, the total he's paying is $342.65, and the interest is $17.25. So if I subtract the interest from the total payment, I should get the principal, which is the amount he borrowed.

So let's do the math: $342.65 (total) minus $17.25 (interest) equals the principal. Let me calculate that.

342.65 minus 17.25. Let's see, 342.65 - 17 is 325.65, then subtract another 0.25 to get 325.40. So the principal should be $325.40.

Looking at the options, option J is $325.40. So I think that's the right answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So if you borrow $325.40 and pay $17.25 in interest, the total would be 325.40 +17.25= 342.65, which matches the amount he's paying. Yep, that checks out. So the answer should be J.

The problem involves determining the amount John Backus borrowed, given that he will pay the Third National Bank $342.65 on July 1, with an interest of $17.25. This is a simple interest scenario where the total payment consists of the principal (amount borrowed) plus the interest. 

Using the relationship:

\[
\text{Total Payment} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

we can solve for the principal by rearranging the formula:

\[
\text{Principal} = \text{Total Payment} - \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Principal} = \$342.65 - \$17.25 = \$325.40
\]

Thus, the amount John Backus borrowed is $325.40, which corresponds to option J.
