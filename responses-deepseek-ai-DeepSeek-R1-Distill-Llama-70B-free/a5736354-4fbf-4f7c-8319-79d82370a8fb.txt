Okay, so I've got this problem here where Mike sold his car, and I need to find out what percent the selling price is of the cost. Hmm, let's break this down. 

The cost price is $12,640, and he sold it for $11,628.80. So, I think the question is asking what percentage 11,628.80 is of 12,640. Right, because percent means per hundred, so we're looking for how much of the original cost he got when he sold it.

So the formula for percentage is (part / whole) * 100. In this case, the part is the selling price, which is 11,628.80, and the whole is the cost price, 12,640. So I'll set it up like that: (11,628.80 / 12,640) * 100.

Let me calculate the division first. 11,628.80 divided by 12,640. Hmm, doing that on paper would be easier, but maybe I can approximate it. Let's see, 12,640 is a bit more than 12,628.80, so the division should be a little less than 1. Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, 12,640 is the denominator, and 11,628 is the numerator. So 11,628.80 ÷ 12,640 is less than 1, right?

Wait, let me do this step by step. Let me write it as 11,628.80 ÷ 12,640. Maybe I can simplify this. Both numbers end with a decimal and a zero, so perhaps I can multiply both by 100 to eliminate decimals. So 1162880 ÷ 126400. Hmm, that might not help much. Maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by 16 to simplify. Let's see: 12,640 divided by 16 is 790, and 11,628.80 divided by 16 is 726.80. So that makes it 726.80 / 790. Hmm, that's still a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can convert both to the same unit. Let me try doing the division step by step. 12,640 goes into 11,628.80 how many times? Well, 12,640 is larger than 11,628.80, so that's less than 1. Let me compute 11,628.80 ÷ 12,640.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as a fraction. 11,628.80 / 12,640. Maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by 100 first to make it easier: 116.288 / 126.4. Hmm, that's a bit better.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate. Let's see, 12,640 is about 12.64 thousand, and 11,628.80 is about 11.6288 thousand. So 11.6288 / 12.64 = ?

Let me compute 11.6288 divided by 12.64. Let me do this division. 12.64 goes into 11.6288 how many times. Since 12.64 is larger, it's less than 1. Let's see, 12.64 x 0.9 is 11.376. Wait, 0.9 *12.64=11.376. Because 12*0.9=10.8, 0.64*0.9=0.576, so 10.8+0.576=11.376. Now, 11.6288 is higher than 11.376, so 0.9 is too low. So let's try 0.92. 12.64 *0.92 = ?

Let me compute that: 12 *0.92=11.04, 0.64*0.92=0.5888. So 11.04 + 0.5888 = 11.6288. Oh wait, that's exactly our numerator! So 12.64 *0.92 = 11.6288. So that means 11.6288 /12.64=0.92, which is 92%. So the percentage is 92%.

Wait, but wait, the numbers I worked with were in thousands. Let me make sure. Oh, no, wait: I had 11,628.80 as 11.6288 thousand and 12,640 as 12.64 thousand. So when I did the division, it's correct. So 0.92 times 100 is 92%. So the correct answer should be B: 92%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: Let's compute 11,628.80 / 12,640.

I can write this as (11,628.80 ÷ 12,640) * 100%. So 11,628.80 divided by 12,640.

Let me compute 11,628.80 ÷12,640. Let's see, 12,640 × 0.9 = 11,376. So subtract that from 11,628.80: 11,628.80 -11,376=252.8. Now, 252.8 divided by 12,640 is how much? Let's compute 252.8 ÷12,640. 12,640 × 0.02 = 252.8. Because 12,640 ×0.01=126.4; 126.4×2=252.8. So 0.02.

So total is 0.9 + 0.02 = 0.92, which is 92%. So that confirms it.

Looking at the options, option B is 92%, so the answer is B.

To determine what percent the selling price is of the cost, we use the formula for percentage:  

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the selling price (\$11,628.80) is the "part," and the cost price (\$12,640) is the "whole." Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{11,628.80}{12,640} \right) \times 100
\]

First, perform the division:

\[
\frac{11,628.80}{12,640} = 0.92
\]

Then multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.92 \times 100 = 92\%
\]

Thus, the selling price is 92% of the cost price. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 92%**

The final answer is:

B
