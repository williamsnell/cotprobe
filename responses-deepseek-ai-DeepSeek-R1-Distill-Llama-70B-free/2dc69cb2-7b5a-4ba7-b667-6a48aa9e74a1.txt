Okay, so I've got this question about completing nuclear equations, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what each part is asking.

The question has four parts, (a) through (d), each giving an incomplete nuclear equation. I remember that in nuclear reactions, the mass numbers and atomic numbers must balance on both sides of the equation. So for each part, I'll check the mass and atomic numbers to see what's missing.

Starting with part (a): _7N^14 + _2He^4 → _8O^17 + ...

The left side has Nitrogen-14 and Helium-4. The right side starts with Oxygen-17. Let me add up the mass numbers first. On the left: 14 + 4 = 18. On the right: 17 plus the unknown equals 18. So the missing mass number is 1. Now for atomic numbers: Nitrogen has 7, Helium 2. Total atomic number on left is 7+2=9. Oxygen has 8, so the missing particle must have an atomic number of 1 because 8 + 1 =9. So what particle has atomic number 1 and mass number 1? That's a proton. Wait, no, wait. Wait, protons have atomic number 1 but mass number 1, so maybe it's a proton. Alternatively, could it be a hydrogen isotope like H^1. Because a proton is just _1H^1. So the missing particle is a proton. So the equation becomes N^14 + He^4 → O^17 + _1H^1.

Wait, but looking at the options, the order of the blanks is (a), (b), (c), (d), and each has a certain particle filled in. So for (a), the missing is a proton, so the first blank is filled with proton. Hmm. Now, let's go to part (b): _4Be^9 + _2He^4 → _6C^12 + ...

Left side: Be has mass 9, He 4, so total 13. Right: C^12 plus unknown equals 13. So the unknown mass is 1. Atomic numbers: Be is 4, He is 2, so total 6. C is 6, so the unknown must have atomic number 0. What has mass 1 and atomic number 0? That's a neutron. So the missing particle is a neutron. So the equation becomes Be^9 + He^4 → C^12 + _0n^1.

So for part (b), the missing is a neutron. Now part (c): _15P^30 → _14Si^30 + ...

Here, P has atomic 15, and Si is 14. So the missing must have atomic number 1. The mass numbers on both sides are the same (30), so the missing particle's mass is 0. What has atomic number +1 and mass 0? That's a positron, which is a beta-plus particle. Because positron emission increases the atomic number. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Positron emission: when a proton converts into a neutron, positron, and neutrino. The positron has charge +1, atomic number +1, but mass is negligible (considered 0). So in the decay, P^30 (atomic 15) becomes Si^30 (atomic 14) plus something. Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, P has atomic number 15, Si is 14. So the daughter is lower in atomic number by 1. So that suggests beta-minus decay, because beta-minus increases the atomic number. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In beta-minus decay, a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. So the atomic number increases by 1. But in this case, the atomic number is decreasing by 1, so it must be positron emission, where a proton turns into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So the emitted particle is a positron, which has atomic number +1 but in the equation, the daughter is lower by 1, so the positron is emitted, making the atomic number go down by 1. Wait, because the positron is +1, so the equation would have to account for that. Let me write the equation:

P^30 → Si^30 + ?

P is 15, Si is 14. So 15 =14 + x. So x must be +1. So the emitted particle has charge +1. That's a positron, which is _{+1}e^0. So the equation becomes _15P^30 → _14Si^30 + _+1e^0.

So for part (c), the missing particle is a positron.

Now part (d): _1H^3 → _2He^3 + ...

H has atomic number 1, He has 2. So the missing must have atomic number -1. The mass numbers: H^3 → He^3 + something. So the mass number on the left is 3, on the right He^3 has mass 3, so the missing must have mass 0. So what has atomic number -1 and mass 0? That's a beta-minus particle, an electron. So the equation becomes H^3 → He^3 + _{−1}e^0 (electron) + ... (maybe a neutrino, but the question might not include that; sometimes they might just put the electron).

So for part (d), the missing is an electron.

Putting it all together:

(a) → proton

(b) → neutron

(c) → positron

(d) → electron

Wait, but the options are given as a list of four, each part (a)-(d) gets one of the options, which are all lists of four answers in some order.

Wait, looking back, the options are A through J, each option has four particles in order (a) to (d). So for each part, the answer is a particle, and the four particles form a sequence.

So, the four blanks are filled in the order (a) proton, (b) neutron, (c) positron, (d) electron.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this sequence: (a) proton, (b) neutron, (c) positron, (d) electron.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Neutron, Positron, Proton, Electron → a: neutron, no.

Option B: Neutron, Proton, Electron, Positron → a: neutron no.

Option C: Electron, Positron, Neutron, Proton → a: electron no.

Option D: Neutron, Electron, Positron, Proton → a: neutron no.

Option E: Positron, Neutron, Electron, Proton → a: positron no.

Option F: Electron, Neutron, Proton, Positron → a: electron no.

Option G: Positron, Proton, Neutron, Electron → a: positron no.

Option H: Proton, Neutron, Positron, Electron → a: proton yes, b: neutron yes, c: positron yes, d: electron yes. So H matches.

Option I: Proton, Positron, Neutron, Electron → a: proton yes, b: positron no.

Option J: Positron, Electron, Proton, Neutron → a: positron no.

So option H is the one that matches all four parts correctly.

To complete the nuclear equations, we must ensure that both the mass numbers and atomic numbers balance on both sides of the equation. Here's the analysis for each part:

### (a) \(_{7}N^{14} + _{2}He^{4} \rightarrow _{8}O^{17} + \dots\)
- **Mass numbers**: \(14 + 4 = 18\) on the left, and \(17 + x = 18\) on the right. Thus, \(x = 1\).
- **Atomic numbers**: \(7 + 2 = 9\) on the left, and \(8 + y = 9\) on the right. Thus, \(y = 1\).
- The particle with mass number 1 and atomic number 1 is a **proton** (\(_{1}H^{1}\)).

### (b) \(_{4}Be^{9} + _{2}He^{4} \rightarrow _{6}C^{12} + \dots\)
- **Mass numbers**: \(9 + 4 = 13\) on the left, and \(12 + x = 13\) on the right. Thus, \(x = 1\).
- **Atomic numbers**: \(4 + 2 = 6\) on the left, and \(6 + y = 6\) on the right. Thus, \(y = 0\).
- The particle with mass number 1 and atomic number 0 is a **neutron** (\(_{0}n^{1}\)).

### (c) \(_{15}P^{30} \rightarrow _{14}Si^{30} + \dots\)
- **Mass numbers**: \(30 = 30 + x\) on both sides, so \(x = 0\).
- **Atomic numbers**: \(15 = 14 + y\). Thus, \(y = 1\).
- The particle with atomic number 1 and negligible mass is a **positron** (\(_{+1}e^{0}\)).

### (d) \(_{1}H^{3} \rightarrow _{2}He^{3} + \dots\)
- **Mass numbers**: \(3 = 3 + x\) on both sides, so \(x = 0\).
- **Atomic numbers**: \(1 = 2 + y\). Thus, \(y = -1\).
- The particle with atomic number \(-1\) and negligible mass is an **electron** (\(_{-1}e^{0}\)).

### Matching the sequence of particles to the options:
- The sequence of particles is: **proton, neutron, positron, electron**.
- The correct option is **H**.

Answer: **H**
