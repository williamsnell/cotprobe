Question:

A basketball player scored 18 points in his first game. This is 4 points fewer than he scored in his second game. Write and solve an equation to find p the number of points he scored in his second game.

Options:

A: 18 = p − 4; 14
B: 18 − p = 4; 22
C: 18 − 4 = p; 14
D: p = 18 - 4; 14
E: 18 = 4 - p; 14
F: 18 + p = 4; 22
G: 18 = p + 4; 22
H: 18 = p − 4; 22

Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the basketball player scored 18 points in his first game. And this is 4 points fewer than he scored in his second game. Hmm, I need to find out how many points he scored in the second game, which is p.

Wait, if the first game was 4 points fewer than the second, that means the second game's points are higher than the first. So the first game is second game minus 4. So maybe the equation is 18 = p - 4. Because 18 is 4 less than p.

Let me check. If p is the second game points, then subtracting 4 gives the first game, which is 18. So equation: 18 = p -4.

Now, solving for p. To get p, I can add 4 to both sides. So 18 +4 equals p. 18 plus 4 is 22. So p should be 22.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H says 18 = p -4; 22. Yes, that looks right. Option A has 18 = p-4 but the answer is 14, which doesn't make sense because 14 +4 is 18, but the second game should be higher.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, if the first game is 18, which is 4 less than the second, then second is 18 +4 =22. So the equation is correct. So option H is the one with equation 18 = p-4 and solution 22. So the correct answer should be H.

The basketball player's first game score (18 points) is 4 points fewer than his second game score (\( p \)). This relationship can be expressed by the equation:

\[
18 = p - 4
\]

Solving for \( p \), add 4 to both sides:

\[
p = 18 + 4 = 22
\]

Thus, the correct equation and solution are given in option H.

Answer: H
