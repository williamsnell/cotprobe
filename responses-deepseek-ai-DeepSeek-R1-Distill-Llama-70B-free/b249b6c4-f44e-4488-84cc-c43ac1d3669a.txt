Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about rotational transitions in HCl. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the frequency of the radiation emitted when the molecule transitions from J=1 to J=0. Oh right, rotational transitions! I remember that in rotational spectroscopy, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number J.

First, I think the formula for the energy levels in rotational spectroscopy is E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, since the transition is from J=1 to J=0, I need to find the energy difference ΔE between these two levels.

So ΔE would be E_1 - E_0. Let me compute each. E_0 is (ħ² / 2I) * 0*(0+1) = 0. And E_1 is (ħ² / 2I) * 1*(1+1) = (ħ² / 2I) * 2, which simplifies to ħ²/(I) * (1/2)*2? Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate. E_1 is (ħ² / (2I)) * (1)(2) = (2ħ²)/(2I) ) which simplifies to ħ²/(I). So ΔE is ħ²/I - 0 = ħ²/I.

But wait, I think the energy difference is actually proportional to J(J+1) for the upper level minus the lower. So when J goes from 1 to 0, the change is E_1 - E_0 = (ħ²/(2I))(1*2 - 0) )= (2ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/I. So that's correct.

Then, the frequency of the emitted photon is given by ΔE = hν, so ν = ΔE / h. Substituting ΔE, ν = (ħ²/I) / h. But wait, ħ is h-bar, which is h/(2π). So let's substitute that.

So ν = ( (h²/(4π²)) / I ) / h = h/(4π² I) * (1/h) ? Wait, let's do the substitution step by step. 

ΔE = (ħ² / I) = (h²/(4π²)) / I.

So ν = ΔE/h = (h²/(4π² I)) / h ) = h/(4π² I).

Wait, no, let's compute that again. ΔE is ħ²/I, which is (h²/(4π²)) / I. Then ν = ΔE/(h) = (h²/(4π² I)) ) * (1/h) ) = h/(4π² I).

Wait, but I think another approach is to use the selection rule for rotational transitions, which is ΔJ = ±1. So the transition J=1→0 is allowed. The frequency is given by the difference in energy between the two levels.

Alternatively, I remember there's a formula for the rotational constant B, which is defined as B = ħ²/(2I), so the energy levels are E_J = B J(J+1). So the energy difference ΔE for J=1→0 is E_1 - E_0 = B(1*2) - B(0) )= 2B.

So ν = ΔE / h = 2B / h. But B is ħ²/(2I), so substituting:

ν = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) / h = (ħ²/I) / h.

Again, substituting ħ = h/(2π):

ν = ( (h²/(4π²)) / I ) / h = h/(4π² I).

Wait, let me compute that correctly. Let me write it as:

ν = (h²/(4π² I)) ) / h = h/(4π² I).

So yes, ν = h/(4π² I).

Now, I need to compute this. To find ν, I need to know I, the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The bond length is given as 1.3 Angstroms, which is 1.3e-10 meters. So r = 1.3e-10 m.

The reduced mass μ is (m_H * m_Cl) / (m_H + m_Cl). The masses of H and Cl are approximately m_H = 1.00784 u (atomic mass units), and m_Cl is about 34.96885 u.

But wait, I should convert these to kilograms. 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So m_H = 1.00784 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈ 1.6735e-27 kg. Similarly, m_Cl = 34.96885 u * 1.6605e-27 ≈ (let me compute that: 34.96885 * 1.6605e-27 ) → 34.96885 * 1.6605 ≈ 58. So 58e-27 kg? Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 34.96885 * 1.6605e-27 kg = ?

Compute 34.96885 * 1.6605:

34.96885 * 1.6605 ≈ Let's see: 35 * 1.66 is about 58.1, but more accurately:

34.96885 * 1.6605 = ?

Well,

34 * 1.6605 = 34 * 1.66 is 56.44, but 34 * 1.6605 = 56.457.

0.96885 * 1.6605 ≈ ~1.612.

So total is approx 56.457 + 1.612 = 58.069. So 58.069e-27 kg. So m_Cl ≈ 5.8069e-26 kg.

Wait, wait, wait, 34.96885 u is 34.96885 * 1.6605e-27 kg. So 34.96885 ≈ 35, 35 * 1.6605e-27 = 5.80675e-26 kg. So m_Cl ≈ 5.80675e-26 kg.

Similarly, m_H is 1.00784 u → 1.00784 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 1.6735e-27 kg.

So the reduced mass μ is (m_H * m_Cl) / (m_H + m_Cl).

Let me compute denominator first: m_H + m_Cl = 1.6735e-27 + 5.80675e-26 = Let's compute 5.80675e-26 is 58.0675e-27. Adding 1.6735e-27 gives 59.74099e-27 kg.

So μ = (1.6735e-27 * 5.80675e-26) / (59.74099e-27).

Compute numerator: 1.6735e-27 *5.80675e-26 = (1.6735*5.80675) * 1e-53.

1.6735 *5.80675 ≈ let's see: 1.6735 *5 is 8.3675, 1.6735 *0.8 is 1.3388, 1.6735 *0.00675≈0.0113. So total is approx 8.3675 +1.3388=9.7063 +0.0113=9.7176. So numerator is approx 9.7176e-53 kg².

Denominator is 59.74099e-27 kg.

So μ = (9.7176e-53) / (59.74099e-27) ) → 9.7176e-53 / 59.74e-27 = (9.7176 /59.74) ) * 1e-26.

Compute 9.7176 /59.74 ≈ 0.1627. So μ ≈ 0.1627e-26 kg → 1.627e-27 kg.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation:

μ = (1.6735e-27 kg)(5.80675e-26 kg) / (1.6735e-27 +5.80675e-26) kg.

Compute denominator:

1.6735e-27 +5.80675e-26 = 1.6735e-27 +58.0675e-27 =59.74099e-27 kg.

So denominator is 5.974099e-26 kg? Wait no, 59.74099e-27 is 5.974099e-26 kg.

Numerator: 1.6735e-27 *5.80675e-26 = let's compute the exponents first: 1e-27 *1e-26 = 1e-53. So 1.6735 *5.80675 = approx 9.7176 as before. So 9.7176e-53.

So μ = 9.7176e-53 / 5.974099e-26 = 9.7176e-53 /5.9741e-26.

Divide the numbers: 9.7176 /5.9741 ≈ 1.627. Then the exponents: 1e-53 /1e-26 =1e-27.

So μ ≈ 1.627e-27 kg.

Now, the moment of inertia I = μ r². r is 1.3e-10 m.

r squared is (1.3e-10)^2 =1.69e-20 m².

So I =1.627e-27 kg * 1.69e-20 m² = (1.627 *1.69) e-47 kg m².

Compute 1.627 *1.69: 1.627 *1.6 is 2.6032, 1.627 *0.09≈0.1464. So total ≈2.7496. So I≈2.7496e-47 kg m².

Now, going back to ν = h/(4π² I).

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J s.

So substituting:

ν =6.62607e-34 / (4 * π² * 2.7496e-47 )

Compute denominator: 4 * π² =4*(9.8696) ≈39.4784.

So denominator: 39.4784 *2.7496e-47 = let's compute 39.4784 *2.7496 first.

39.4784 *2 =78.9568, 39.4784 *.7496≈approx 39.4784 *0.7= 27.634, 39.4784 *0.0496≈1.956. So total for 0.7496 is about 27.634 +1.956≈29.59. So total denominator is approx78.9568 +29.59=108.5468. So denominator is 108.5468e-47.

So ν =6.62607e-34 / (108.5468e-47) ) → 6.62607e-34 /1.085468e-45 → because 108.5468e-47 is 1.085468e-45.

So 6.62607e-34 /1.085468e-45 = (6.62607/1.085468) ) * 1e11.

Compute 6.62607 /1.085468 → approx 6.11. Because 1.085468 *6 =6.5128, which is less than 6.626. 6.11 *1.085468 ≈6.11*1=6.11, 6.11*.085468≈0.522. So 6.11+0.522=6.632, which is very close to 6.626, so approximately 6.11.

So ν≈6.11e11 Hz.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.62607 /1.085468.

Let me do the division: 1.085468 *6=6.512808. The difference is 6.62607-6.512808=0.113262.

Bring down a zero (treating as 0.113262/1.085468). So 0.113262 /1.085468 ≈0.1043.

So the total is approximately 6.1043.

So ν ≈6.1043e11 Hz.

Wait, 6.1e11 Hz is 6.1 ×10^11 Hz.

Looking at the options:

Options are from 0.3e12 to ~1.1e12.

Wait, 6.1e11 Hz is 0.61 ×10^12 Hz. So 0.61e12 Hz, which is option C: 0.615 ×10^12 Hz. Hmm, very close. My calculation gives approximately 0.61e12.

But wait, let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let me retrace.

Wait, when I calculated I, I had I = μ r². Wait, μ was 1.627e-27 kg, r is 1.3e-10 m, so r² is 1.69e-20 m². So I =1.627e-27 * 1.69e-20 = (1.627 *1.69) * 1e-47. 1.627 *1.69 = about 2.749, so I=2.749e-47 kg m².

Then ν = h/(4π² I) =6.626e-34/(4 *pi^2 *2.749e-47) → compute denominator: 4*(pi^2)=39.478. 39.478 *2.749e-47 = 39.478 *2.749 = let me compute that accurately.

39.478 *2.749.

Let me compute 39.478 *2 =78.956.

39.478 *0.7 =27.6346.

39.478 *0.04 =1.57912.

39.478 *0.009=0.3543.

Add all together:78.956 +27.6346=106.5906 +1.57912=108.1697 +0.3543≈108.524.

So denominator is 108.524e-47 → 1.08524e-45.

So 6.626e-34 /1.08524e-45 = (6.626 /1.08524) )e( -34 +45 )= (6.626 /1.08524 ) *1e11.

6.626 /1.08524 → let's compute this.

1.08524 *6 =6.51144. So 6.626 -6.51144=0.11456 left.

0.11456 /1.08524 ≈0.1055.

So 6.1055 → approximately 6.1055e11 Hz → 0.61055e12 Hz → 0.611e12 Hz. 

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 0.615e12, which is very close. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me double-check that.

Reduced mass μ = (m_H * m_Cl)/(m_H + m_Cl).

m_H = 1.00784 u → 1.00784 *1.6605e-27 = approx 1.6735e-27 kg.

m_Cl = 34.96885 u → 34.96885 *1.6605e-27 = let's compute more accurately.

34.96885 *1.6605 → 34 *1.6605 =56.457, 0.96885*1.6605≈1.610. So total is 56.457 +1.610 ≈58.067 → 58.067e-27 kg is 5.8067e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.6735e-27 *5.8067e-26) / (1.6735e-27 +5.8067e-26).

Denominator: 1.6735e-27 +5.8067e-26 = 1.6735e-27 +58.067e-27 =59.7405e-27 kg.

Numerator: 1.6735e-27 *5.8067e-26 = (1.6735 *5.8067) *1e-53.

1.6735 *5.8067 → Let me compute 1.6735 *5=8.3675, 1.6735 *0.8067≈1.6735*0.8=1.3388, 1.6735*0.0067≈0.0112. So 8.3675 +1.3388=9.7063 +0.0112≈9.7175. So 9.7175e-53.

μ = 9.7175e-53 / 59.7405e-27 → 9.7175e-53 /59.7405e-27 → 9.7175 /59.7405 → approx 0.1627 → 0.1627e-26 kg which is 1.627e-27 kg. So that part seems correct.

Another point to check: when I calculated ν, I used the correct formula. The energy difference is E = h ν. So the steps seem correct.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula for the energy levels. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant, B = ħ²/(2I). So for the transition J=1 → J=0, the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = B*(1*2) - B*0 = 2B.

So the frequency is ν = ΔE/h = 2B/h.

But B is ħ²/(2I), so substituting:

ν = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) / h → (ħ²/I) / h → ħ²/(
