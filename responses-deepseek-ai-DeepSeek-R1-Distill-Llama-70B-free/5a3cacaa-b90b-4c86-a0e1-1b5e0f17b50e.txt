Question:

The state has the following statutes regarding liquor sales in effect:"Section 1212. Whoever sells intoxicating liquor to any person who is intoxicated or inebriated is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section shall not apply in the case of sales of intoxicating liquor by a hotel, motel, or inn to any person registered and resident as a guest in such hotel, motel, or inn for consumption upon the premises thereof. ""Section 1213. It shall be unlawful for any vendor with a valid state liquor license to sell intoxicating beverages on Sunday. Anyone in violation of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not less than $100 or more than $1,000. "The state authorities have regularly enforced the aforementioned dram shop statute and "blue law" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales. At 12:30 a. m. on Sunday morning, a customer entered a liquor store and purchased a bottle of wine. The clerk who made the sale, thought the time was 11:30 p. m. Saturday night because that was the time shown on the store's wall clock. Unknown to the clerk, the clock was malfunctioning and was running an hour behind. Thus, the clock displayed the wrong time when the clerk sold the wine to the customer. When the clerk made the sale, the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated. After making the purchase, the customer drank the entire bottle of wine. He then drove off in his car and struck a pedestrian, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the customer was intoxicated from drinking the wine. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the liquor store, will the plaintiff prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the accident would not have occurred but for the sale of the wine to the customer.
B: No, because the clerk did not violate the dram shop statute, and his violation of the "blue law" resulted from the clock's malfunctioning.
C: No, because the customer did not appear to be visibly inebriated when he purchased the wine.
D: Yes, because the liquor store was negligent per se by selling the wine in violation of the "blue law" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales.
E: No, because the purpose of the "blue law" prohibiting Sunday liquor sales was not to prevent accidents caused by drivers driving while intoxicated.
F: Yes, because the clerk should have been aware of the correct time regardless of the store's clock.
G: Yes, because the store should have a system in place to ensure the accuracy of the time.
H: No, because the pedestrian was not the direct victim of the violation of the "blue law."
I: Yes, because the clock's malfunctioning is not a valid excuse for violating the "blue law."
J: No, because the customer was already intoxicated before the purchase was made.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about liquor sales and liability. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The question involves two statutes: Section 1212 and 1213. Section 1212 says that selling liquor to an intoxicated person is a misdemeanor, but there's an exception for hotels, motels, and inns selling to their guests. Section 1213 is a blue law that prohibits selling liquor on Sundays, with penalties for violations.

The scenario is that a customer bought wine at 12:30 a.m. on Sunday. The clerk thought it was 11:30 p.m. Saturday because the store's clock was malfunctioning and was an hour behind. So, the clerk didn't realize it was already Sunday. The customer wasn't visibly drunk when he bought the wine, but after drinking it, he drove and hit a pedestrian. The pedestrian is suing the liquor store.

The question is whether the plaintiff (pedestrian) will prevail against the liquor store.

Let me think about the possible claims. The main ones here are probably under the dram shop act (Section 1212) and the blue law (Section 1213). 

First, the dram shop statute makes it a crime to sell liquor to someone intoxicated. But in this case, the customer didn't appear intoxicated when he bought the wine. So the clerk didn't violate Section 1212 because the customer wasn't visibly inebriated at the time of sale. That means the dram shop statute isn't the issue here.

Next, the blue law. The clerk sold the wine on Sunday, which is prohibited. The clerk thought it was Saturday because the clock was wrong, but the actual time was Sunday. The question is whether the store is liable under the blue law, and whether that violation leads to liability for the accident.

In tort law, a statute can be used to establish negligence per se if the statute was meant to prevent the kind of harm that occurred. So, if the blue law was intended to prevent drunk driving accidents, then violating it could be negligence per se.

Wait, but blue laws are typically about restricting sales on Sundays for religious or social reasons, not specifically to prevent DUIs. The purpose of the blue law here might be more about controlling when liquor is sold rather than directly preventing accidents. So maybe the store's violation of the blue law doesn't directly relate to the harm (the DUI accident).

Alternatively, if the sale on Sunday is illegal, and that led to the customer drinking and driving, the store could be liable. But does the blue law's purpose include preventing such accidents?

I'm a bit confused here. Also, the clerk relied on a malfunctioning clock. Does that matter? Mistake of fact might be a defense, but for a strict liability statute, intent isn't required. So the store might still be liable for violating the blue law regardless of the clerk's mistake.

If the store is found to have violated the blue law, then the next step is proximate cause. The sale led to the customer drinking and driving, which caused the accident. So the chain of causation seems clear.

So, the store could be held liable under negligence per se because they violated the blue law, which could be considered as the standard of care. But wait, does the blue law's purpose align with preventing this kind of injury? If the law is meant to reduce drunk driving by limiting sales, then it might. If not, then maybe not.

Looking at the options:

Option D says yes because of negligence per se under the blue law. Option C says no because the customer wasn't visibly drunk. But the issue isn't the dram shop act, it's the blue law. So C might not be the right reason.

Option E says no because the blue law's purpose isn't to prevent DUI accidents. That could be a possible defense. If the purpose is just to control Sunday sales, then the violation wouldn't be the proximate cause of the accident.

Option I says yes because the clock malfunctioning isn't an excuse. That's about the violation itself, but not about whether the statute's purpose applies.

So, if the blue law's purpose includes preventing such accidents, then D would be correct. But if the purpose is more about public morals or days of rest, then E might be correct.

I think blue laws are more about controlling when alcohol is sold rather than specifically targeting DUI prevention. Dram shop laws are more directly aimed at preventing serving intoxicated people. So maybe the blue law's purpose doesn't align with preventing DUI accidents, making the store's violation not the proximate cause under negligence per se.

Therefore, the answer would be E or B. Wait, no, B says no because the clerk didn't violate the dram shop statute and the blue law violation was due to the clock. But the blue law is a strict liability offense, so the reason for the violation (clock malfunction) doesn't matter. So B might not be correct.

Wait, option E says no because the purpose of the blue law wasn't to prevent DUIs. So if the court decides that the blue law's purpose doesn't include preventing such accidents, then the store isn't liable under negligence per se.

Alternatively, option D says yes because it's negligence per se. But if the statute's purpose doesn't align, then D wouldn't apply.

I'm a bit stuck here. Another angle: even if the sale was illegal under the blue law, does that make the store liable for the customer's actions? Proximate cause requires that the injury was foreseeable. Selling alcohol can lead to DUI, so maybe it's foreseeable.

But the blue law's purpose is more about when sales can occur, not about the behavior of the buyer after the sale. So the connection between the illegal sale and the DUI might be too attenuated.

In that case, the store's liability wouldn't stem from the blue law violation, so the answer would be E or C.

Wait, but the clerk didn't violate the dram shop act because the customer wasn't visibly intoxicated. So C would say no because of that. But the question is about the blue law, not the dram shop.

So the possible options are D, E, or I.

If the store is guilty of violating the blue law, which is a strict liability offense, then negligence per se applies. But negligence per se requires that the statute was intended to protect against this type of harm. If the blue law wasn't intended to prevent DUIs, then the store's violation doesn't establish negligence per se for this injury.

So the pedestrian's claim would fail because the blue law's purpose wasn't to prevent such accidents. Therefore, the answer would be E.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, even if the statute's primary purpose isn't directly to prevent the harm, courts can still find that the harm is within the statute's intended protection. For example, a law against selling to minors is intended to protect minors, but it also indirectly protects others from harm caused by minors' drinking.

But the blue law is more about the day of sale. Maybe the court would say that the purpose is broader, like reducing overall alcohol consumption, which could include reducing DUIs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the sale being illegal is a but-for cause of the accident. If the sale hadn't happened, the accident wouldn't have occurred. So the store could be liable under causation.

But the defenses would argue that the purpose of the statute doesn't extend to this type of harm. So it's a bit of a toss-up.

I think the best answer is D: Yes, because the store was negligent per se by violating the blue law. But wait, does the blue law's purpose include preventing such accidents? If not, then D wouldn't apply.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is D because the violation is clear, and the resulting harm is a foreseeable consequence of selling alcohol illegally, even if the statute's main purpose is different.

The question revolves around whether the liquor store can be held liable for the pedestrian's injuries under the given statutes. The analysis focuses on two key statutes: Section 1212 (dram shop statute) and Section 1213 (blue law prohibiting Sunday liquor sales). 

1. **Section 1212 (Dram Shop Statute):** This statute prohibits selling liquor to an intoxicated person. However, the customer did not appear visibly inebriated at the time of purchase, so the clerk did not violate this statute. Therefore, the dram shop statute does not apply here.

2. **Section 1213 (Blue Law):** The clerk sold liquor on Sunday, which is prohibited under this statute. The clerk's reliance on a malfunctioning clock does not excuse the violation, as the statute imposes strict liability. The key issue is whether the blue law's purpose includes preventing accidents caused by intoxicated drivers. 

   - **Negligence Per Se:** If the blue law's purpose is deemed to include reducing drunk driving accidents, the store's violation could constitute negligence per se, making it liable for the pedestrian's injuries. 
   - **Purpose of the Blue Law:** Blue laws are typically enacted to regulate when liquor can be sold, often for social or religious reasons, rather than specifically to prevent drunk driving. If the court determines that the statute's purpose does not align with preventing such accidents, the store may not be liable under negligence per se.

3. **Causation:** The sale of liquor was a but-for cause of the accident, as the customer would not have driven intoxicated without purchasing the wine. However, proximate cause requires that the harm be foreseeable and within the scope of the statute's purpose. If the blue law's purpose is not aligned with preventing DUI-related accidents, the store may not be held liable.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **Option D:** Correct if the court finds that the blue law's purpose includes preventing drunk driving accidents, making the store liable under negligence per se.
- **Option E:** Correct if the court determines that the blue law's purpose does not extend to preventing DUI-related accidents, breaking the chain of liability.
- **Option C:** Incorrect because the dram shop statute does not apply, as the customer was not visibly intoxicated at the time of sale.
- **Option I:** Incorrect because the clock malfunction does not excuse the violation, but this does not directly address the liability for the accident.

The correct answer hinges on whether the blue law's purpose is interpreted to include preventing drunk driving accidents. If the court finds that it does, the store is liable under negligence per se. If not, the store is not liable because the statute's purpose does not align with the harm caused.

ANSWER: D
