Question:

Company A has found that if it offers a guarantee on its transistor radios, more will be sold than without the guarantee. In a year, the company expects to sell 100 radios if no guarantee is offered, but if the length of the guarantee is t years then the number sold will be Q = 100 + 5t. It is known that 10% of radios sold will fail each year. The cost of fixing a radio is $1 and a profit of $2.80 is made on every radio sold. What is the length of the guarantee period t that maximizes profit?

Okay, so I've got this problem about Company A and their transistor radios. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of optimization problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the guarantee period t that maximizes profit. Let me break down the information given.

First, the company sells 100 radios without a guarantee. But when they offer a guarantee of t years, the number sold increases to Q = 100 + 5t. So more guarantee time means more units sold. That makes sense because consumers probably feel safer buying with a longer warranty.

Now, each year, 10% of the radios sold will fail. So the failure rate is 10% per year. And for each failure, the company has to fix it at a cost of $1. But each radio sold gives a profit of $2.80. So the profit is per radio, but the costs come from the warranties.

I need to model the total profit as a function of t and then find t that maximizes it. Profit would be the revenue from selling the radios minus the costs of fixing the failed ones during the warranty period.

Let me outline the variables:

- Q(t) = 100 + 5t (number of radios sold)
- Failure rate = 10% per year → 0.1 per year
- Cost per failure = $1
- Profit per radio = $2.80

So, the total revenue from sales would be Q(t) multiplied by the profit per radio, which is 2.80 * Q(t).

But then we have to subtract the cost of repairs. The tricky part here is calculating the expected repair costs over the warranty period. For each radio sold, the company is liable for repairs for t years. Each year, 10% of the radios fail. So for each radio, the expected number of failures over t years is the sum of 0.1 each year for t years. Wait, but actually, it's a bit more precise than that. Because each radio can only fail once, right? Or can it fail multiple times? Hmm, the problem says 10% of radios sold will fail each year. So I think each radio has a 10% chance each year of failing, but once it's fixed, it doesn't fail again. Or does it? Wait, the problem says "10% of radios sold will fail each year." So perhaps each radio can fail each year with 10% chance. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a guarantee that if it fails within t years, the company fixes it once. Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear, but I'll make an assumption here.

Wait, the problem says "10% of radios sold will fail each year." So maybe each radio has a 10% chance of failing each year, and if it does, the company has to fix it. So over t years, each radio could potentially fail multiple times. But that seems a bit odd because usually, a product either fails or doesn't, and if it's fixed, it might not fail again. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think I should proceed with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 10% chance that a radio fails in the first year, another 10% in the second, etc., regardless of previous failures. But that might overcomplicate the model. Alternatively, perhaps each radio has a 10% chance per year of failing, so over t years, the expected number of failures per radio is 0.1 * t.

Wait, but that would be the case if each year's failure is independent, but in reality, once a radio fails, it's fixed, so perhaps it can't fail again. Hmm, maybe it's better to model it as each radio having a 10% chance of failing each year during the warranty period. So for each radio, the expected number of failures over t years would be 0.1 * t. So the total failures across all radios sold would be Q(t) * 0.1 * t. But wait, that would be the case if each radio can fail every year. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, another approach: the company sells Q radios. For each radio, the expected number of failures during t years is the sum over each year of the probability of failure that year. Since each year is 10%, the expected number per radio is 0.1 * t. So total expected failures across all radios is Q(t) * 0.1 * t. Therefore, total repair cost is Q(t) * 0.1 * t * 1 (since each repair costs $1). 

So the profit function would be:

Profit(t) = (Profit per radio) * Q(t) - (Repair cost)
= 2.80 * Q(t) - 1 * (Q(t) * 0.1 * t)

Let me write that out:

Profit(t) = 2.8 * (100 + 5t) - 1 * (100 + 5t) * 0.1 * t

Simplify this equation.

First, expand each term.

2.8*(100 +5t) = 2.8*100 + 2.8*5t = 280 + 14t

Then, the second term is (100 +5t)*0.1*t = (10 + 0.5t)*t = 10t + 0.5t²

So the profit becomes:

280 +14t - (10t + 0.5t²) = 280 +14t -10t -0.5t² = 280 +4t -0.5t²

So Profit(t) = -0.5 t² +4t +280

This is a quadratic function in terms of t. The graph of this function is a downward opening parabola, so the maximum occurs at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola given by f(t) = at² + bt + c is at t = -b/(2a)

In this case, a = -0.5, b=4.

So t = -4/(2*(-0.5)) = -4 / (-1) )= 4.

So t=4 years would maximize the profit.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in expanding terms.

Let me recalculate the profit function.

Profit(t) = 2.8*(100 +5t) - (0.1*t)*(100 +5t)

Calculate each part:

2.8*(100 +5t) = 280 +14t

0.1*t*(100 +5t) = 0.1t*100 + 0.1t*5t =10t +0.5t²

So, Profit(t) = (280 +14t) - (10t +0.5t²) = 280 +4t -0.5t²

Yes, that's correct.

So the quadratic is -0.5t² +4t +280. The vertex is at t = -b/(2a) = -4/(2*(-0.5))= -4/-1=4.

So t=4 years.

Looking at the options, option D is 4 years.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I model the repair cost correctly? Because if a radio fails in year 1, it's fixed, but what about year 2? If the same radio fails again, does the company have to fix it again? The problem says 10% of radios sold will fail each year. So perhaps each radio can have multiple failures each year, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 10% chance each year that a radio will fail, but once it's fixed, it doesn't fail again. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think my initial approach is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the 10% is per radio, so each radio has a 10% chance of failing in the first year, a 10% in the second, etc. So for t years, the probability that the radio fails at least once is 1 - (0.9)^t. But that complicates things because then the expected number of failures per radio would be more complex. Wait, no, that's not exactly the same. Because the way the problem is stated, it's 10% of radios sold will fail each year. So perhaps each year, 10% of the sold radios fail, regardless of whether they failed before. So for example, if you have 100 radios, each year 10 fail, so over t years, 10t would fail. But that can't be right because you can't have more failures than the number of radios sold. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait another approach: Let's say the company sells Q radios. Each radio has a 10% chance of failing each year during the warranty period. So for t years, each radio's expected number of failures is 0.1*t. So the total expected failures are Q * 0.1 * t. Hence, the cost is Q * 0.1 * t.

This is the model I used earlier, leading to t=4.

But perhaps I should consider that a radio can't fail more than once because once it's fixed, it might not fail again, but the problem doesn't specify this. So the initial approach might overcount the failures. Alternatively, perhaps each radio can fail only once, and the 10% is the annual probability, so the probability that a radio fails within t years is 1 - (0.9)^t. Then the expected number of failures per radio would be 1 - (0.9)^t, and total failures would be Q*(1 - (0.9)^t). But that would change the model.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think about it.

If each radio has a 10% chance of failing each year, the probability that it doesn't fail in a given year is 0.9. So the probability that it doesn't fail in any of the t years is (0.9)^t. Therefore, the probability that it fails at least once in t years is 1 - (0.9)^t. So the expected number of failures per radio is 1 - (0.9)^t, assuming that once it fails, it's fixed and doesn't fail again. So the total expected failures would be Q(t) * [1 - (0.9)^t].

In that case, the repair cost would be Q(t) * [1 - (0.9)^t] * $1.

Then, the profit would be:

Profit(t) = 2.80 * Q(t) - [1 - (0.9)^t] * Q(t)

= Q(t) [2.80 - (1 - (0.9)^t)]

= (100 +5t) [2.80 -1 + (0.9)^t ]

= (100 +5t) [1.80 + (0.9)^t ]

Hmm, this seems more complicated. But perhaps this is a more accurate model because a radio can't fail more than once. So in this case, the profit function would be more complex, involving an exponential term.

But the problem is a bit ambiguous regarding whether a radio can fail multiple times. The problem states, "10% of radios sold will fail each year." So perhaps each year, 10% of the radios sold will fail, and this can include radios that failed in previous years. Or it could mean that each radio has a 10% chance each year, but if it failed before, it might not fail again. Without more information, it's a bit unclear. However, in the first approach, the model was linear in t, leading to t=4. But perhaps the intended model is the simpler one where the number of failures is 0.1*t per radio.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the simpler model because it's a basic optimization question, and the more complex model would require calculus involving exponential functions, which might be beyond the intended scope.

So perhaps I should stick with the initial approach where the profit is -0.5t² +4t +280, leading to t=4, which is option D.

But to be thorough, let me consider the second approach where the expected failures are 1 - (0.9)^t per radio.

So Profit(t) = 2.80 * Q(t) - 1*(1 - (0.9)^t)*Q(t)

= Q(t) [2.80 - (1 - (0.9)^t) ]

= (100 +5t) [1.80 + (0.9)^t ]

To find the t that maximizes this, I would need to take the derivative of this function with respect to t and set it to zero.

Let me denote P(t) = (100 +5t)(1.80 + (0.9)^t )

To find dP/dt, I'll use the product rule.

Let u =100 +5t → du/dt =5

v=1.80 + (0.9)^t → dv/dt = (0.9)^t * ln(0.9)

So dP/dt = u dv/dt + v du/dt

= (100 +5t)(0.9^t ln(0.9)) + (1.80 +0.9^t)(5)

Set this equal to zero for maximization.

So,

(100 +5t)(0.9^t ln(0.9)) +5(1.80 +0.9^t )=0

This equation seems complicated to solve algebraically. Maybe I can try plugging in the answer choices to see which t gives the maximum.

But this might take some time. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer is t=4.

Wait, but the initial approach was much simpler and led to a clear answer. Maybe the problem is intended to be modeled that way, with the repair cost being 0.1*t per radio.

So given that, the maximum is at t=4, which is option D.
</think>

To determine the length of the guarantee period \( t \) that maximizes profit, we start by defining the profit function. The number of radios sold is given by \( Q(t) = 100 + 5t \), and the profit per radio is $2.80. The cost of repairs is $1 per failure, and 10% of radios sold fail each year. 

### Profit Function
The total profit is calculated as:

\[
\text{Profit}(t) = (\text{Profit per radio}) \cdot Q(t) - (\text{Repair cost})
\]

The repair cost is the expected number of failures over \( t \) years. Since 10% of radios fail each year, the expected number of failures per radio over \( t \) years is \( 0.1 \cdot t \). Therefore, the total repair cost is:

\[
\text{Repair cost} = Q(t) \cdot 0.1 \cdot t \cdot 1 = (100 + 5t) \cdot 0.1 \cdot t = 10t + 0.5t^2
\]

Substituting into the profit function:

\[
\text{Profit}(t) = 2.80 \cdot (100 + 5t) - (10t + 0.5t^2)
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
\text{Profit}(t) = 280 + 14t - 10t - 0.5t^2 = 280 + 4t - 0.5t^2
\]

This is a quadratic function of the form:

\[
\text{Profit}(t) = -0.5t^2 + 4t + 280
\]

### Maximizing the Profit
The maximum of a quadratic function \( at^2 + bt + c \) occurs at \( t = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -0.5 \) and \( b = 4 \), so:

\[
t = -\frac{4}{2(-0.5)} = -\frac{4}{-1} = 4
\]

Thus, the guarantee period \( t = 4 \) years maximizes the profit.

### Verification
The calculations assume that the repair cost is proportional to \( t \), with 10% of radios failing each year. This model aligns with the problem's description, and the derived profit function is consistent with the given data. The quadratic function is maximized at \( t = 4 \), which corresponds to option D.
