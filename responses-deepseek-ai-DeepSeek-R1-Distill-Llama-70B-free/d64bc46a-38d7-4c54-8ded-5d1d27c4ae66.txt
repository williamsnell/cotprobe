Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the acid-test ratio for ABC Plumbing. Hmm, I remember the acid-test ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets that can be quickly converted into cash. But wait, I should make sure I get the exact formula right.

The formula for the acid-test ratio is: (Cash + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable) divided by Current Liabilities. Oh right, because it's like a quicker version of the current ratio, excluding inventory and other less liquid assets.

Looking at the data given: 
Cash is $7,300,
Marketable Securities are $14,200,
Accounts Receivable is $2,120.
So adding those up, that's 7,300 + 14,200 + 2,120. Let me add that. 7,300 plus 14,200 is 21,500, and then plus 2,120 gives me 23,620. So the numerator is $23,620.

Now the denominator is the current liabilities. The question lists Notes Payable as $1,400 and Accounts Payable as $1,850. So total current liabilities are 1,400 + 1,850. Let me calculate that: 1,400 plus 1,850 is 3,250. So denominator is $3,250.

So the acid-test ratio is 23,620 divided by 3,250. Let me compute that. Hmm, 23,620 ÷ 3,250. Let me do this division step by step.

First, 3,250 times 7 is 22,750. Because 3,250 * 7: 3,000*7=21,000, 250*7=1,750. 21,000+1,750=22,750.

Subtracting that from 23,620: 23,620 - 22,750 = 870.

So 870 left. Now, 3,250 goes into 870 how many times? Well, less than once. So 870 / 3,250. Let me compute that as a decimal.

Well, 3,250 * 0.27 is about 878.5. Wait, because 3,250 * 0.2 is 650, and 0.07 is 227.5. So 650 + 227.5 = 877.5. Oh wait, wait, 3,250 * 0.27 = 877.5. But we have 870, which is a bit less than that.

So 0.27 would give 877.5, which is 7.5 more than 870. So actually, it's approximately 0.27 minus (7.5/3250). Let me compute 7.5 / 3250. 7.5 divided by 3250 equals approximately 0.0023. So 0.27 - 0.0023 is approximately 0.2677.

So the total ratio is 7 + 0.2677, which is about 7.2677. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, that's 7.27.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding can be tricky. Let me compute 23,620 ÷ 3,250 more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute 23,620 ÷ 3,250. Let's write it as 23620 ÷ 3250.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 2362 ÷ 325.

Let me compute 325 * 7 = 2275. 2362 - 2275 = 87. So it's 7 with a remainder of 87.

Now, 87 divided by 325 is 0.26769... So 7.26769...

Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 7.27.

Looking at the options, option G is 7.27. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any addition mistakes. Let me re-add the assets: 7,300 + 14,200 is 21,500. Plus 2,120 gives 23,620. Yes, correct. Liabilities: 1,400 + 1,850 is 3,250. Correct.

So yes, 23,620 / 3,250 = ~7.27. So the answer is G.

The acid-test ratio is calculated using the formula: 

\[
\text{Acid-Test Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash} + \text{Marketable Securities} + \text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
\]

From the data provided:
- Cash = $7,300
- Marketable Securities = $14,200
- Accounts Receivable = $2,120
- Notes Payable = $1,400
- Accounts Payable = $1,850

First, calculate the numerator (liquid assets):
\[
\text{Numerator} = 7,300 + 14,200 + 2,120 = 23,620
\]

Next, calculate the denominator (current liabilities):
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1,400 + 1,850 = 3,250
\]

Now, compute the acid-test ratio:
\[
\text{Acid-Test Ratio} = \frac{23,620}{3,250} \approx 7.27
\]

Rounded to the nearest hundredth, the acid-test ratio is 7.27. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: 7.27**
