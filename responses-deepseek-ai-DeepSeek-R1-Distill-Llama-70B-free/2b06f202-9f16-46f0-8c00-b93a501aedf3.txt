Okay, so I need to find the probability that exactly two out of four 20-sided dice show an even number when rolled. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, each die is fair and has numbers from 1 to 20. So, I should figure out the probability of getting an even number on a single die. Well, numbers 1-20 include 10 even and 10 odd numbers. So the chance of rolling even is 10/20, which simplifies to 1/2. Same for odd.

Now, since Ben is rolling four dice, and we want exactly two evens and two odds, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. The formula for binomial probability is:

P(k successes) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

Here, a "success" would be rolling an even number. So n=4 trials (dice), k=2 successes (evens).

C(4,2) is the combination of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that C(n,k) is calculated as n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So 4! is 24, and 2! is 2. So 24/(2*2) = 6. So C(4,2)=6.

p is the probability of success on a single trial, which is 1/2. So p^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The (1-p) part is also 1/2, so (1/2)^(4-2) is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Putting it all together: 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6 * 1/16 = 6/16. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 3/8.

Wait, but let me double-check. Each die is independent, right? So each outcome is multiplied. Oh wait, no, the binomial formula already accounts for that because it's considering each trial as independent.

So the calculation should be correct. 6 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6/16, which is 3/8.

Looking back at the options, option B is 3/8. So the answer should be B.

To determine the probability that exactly two of the four 20-sided dice show an even number, we start by noting that each die has an equal probability of landing on an even or odd number, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is a binomial probability problem with \( n = 4 \) trials (dice rolls), \( k = 2 \) successes (even numbers), and the probability of success \( p = \frac{1}{2} \).

The binomial probability formula is:

\[
P(k \text{ successes}) = \binom{n}{k} \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

Here:
- \( \binom{4}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 successes out of 4 trials, calculated as:
  \[
  \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
  \]
- \( p^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
- \( (1-p)^{4-2} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
P(2 \text{ evens}) = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = \frac{6}{16} = \frac{3}{8}
\]

Thus, the probability that exactly two of the dice show an even number is \( \frac{3}{8} \), which corresponds to option B.
