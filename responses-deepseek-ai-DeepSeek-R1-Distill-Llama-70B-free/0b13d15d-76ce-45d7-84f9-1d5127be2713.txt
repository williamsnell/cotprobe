Okay, so I have this question about the diffusion rates of inert gases under standard temperature and pressure. The gases are Ar, He, and Kr. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about Graham's law of diffusion. Let me think.

Graham's law says that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. So the formula is rate1/rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). M is the molar mass.

The question is asking for the relative rates of Ar, He, and Kr. So I need their molar masses. Let's see, helium is the lightest. Helium's molar mass is about 4 g/mol. Argon is next, I think around 40 g/mol. Krypton is heavier, maybe 84 g/mol?

So the rates should be in the order He > Ar > Kr because lighter gases diffuse faster. Now I need to calculate the exact ratios.

Let me assign each gas a variable. Let's say Rate_He = 1/sqrt(4) = 1/2. Rate_Ar = 1/sqrt(40), and Rate_Kr = 1/sqrt(84).

Wait, but to compare the rates relative to each other, I should probably express them in terms of a common factor. Maybe set He's rate as 1, then find the others relative to that.

Wait, no, another approach: the rates are inversely proportional to the sqrt of molar masses. So He's rate is sqrt(40/4) times Ar's rate. Or wait, maybe I should find the ratios all relative to each other.

Alternatively, calculate each rate relative to He. Let me think.

Let me compute the rates relative to each other. Let's take He as the baseline. Rate of He is proportional to 1/sqrt(4) = 0.5. Rate of Ar is 1/sqrt(40). Rate of Kr is 1/sqrt(84). But to get the ratios, I can express them relative to each other.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the rates as a ratio all to each other.

So the relative rates would be:

Rate_He : Rate_Ar : Rate_Kr = 1/sqrt(4) : 1/sqrt(40) : 1/sqrt(84)

Let me compute each term numerically.

1/sqrt(4) = 0.5

1/sqrt(40) ≈ 1/6.3246 ≈ 0.1582

1/sqrt(84) ≈ 1/9.165 ≈ 0.1091

So the ratios would be approximately 0.5 : 0.1582 : 0.1091. But wait, I think I should normalize these so that they are in proportion relative to each other. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the ratios relative to the slowest gas, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The question says "relative rates at which inert gases, Ar, He, and Kr diffuse". So we need to express the rates in terms relative to each other. But usually, we compare them by setting one as a reference. For simplicity, let's say the rate of He is 1, then the others are relative to that.

Wait, no, Graham's law is about the ratio. So if we have two gases, their rates are inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So for three gases, the rates can be expressed as inversely proportional to sqrt(M). So the relative rates will be in the order He > Ar > Kr.

But let's compute actual numbers. Let's compute the diffusion rates as relative to each other.

Let me compute each rate as follows:

Rate_He = 1 / sqrt(4) = 0.5

Rate_Ar = 1 / sqrt(40) ≈ 0.15811

Rate_Kr = 1 / sqrt(84) ≈ 0.10910

But let me write them as relative to each other. Let's take the fastest rate (He) as 1. So we can divide each by the He rate to get their relative rates.

Wait no, that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express them in terms of the ratio relative to the slowest gas. Hmm. Or perhaps the way I computed them is correct, but we need to present them in the order Ar : He : Kr.

Wait, the question is about the relative rates of Ar, He, and Kr. So the order is Ar, He, Kr.

So the rates for Ar, He, Kr would be:

Ar: 1/sqrt(40) ≈ 0.1582

He: 1/sqrt(4) = 0.5

Kr: 1/sqrt(84) ≈ 0.1091

So the relative rates are Ar : He : Kr = 0.1582 : 0.5 : 0.1091

But to make it easier, perhaps we can express them all relative to the rate of Argon, or another gas. Alternatively, to present the ratios in the same terms, maybe we can scale them so that the sum is 1, but I don't think that's necessary.

Wait, no, the question just asks to compare the relative rates, not to sum up. So the rates are Ar : He : Kr = approximately 0.158 : 0.5 : 0.109.

But looking at the options, the first option after the question is A to J. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option E: .1582 : .4998 : .1092 → which is very close to what I have. Let me see:

Option E is Ar, He, Kr rates as 0.1582 : 0.4998 : 0.1092. Which matches what I calculated. Because 1/sqrt(40)=0.1581, 1/sqrt(4)=0.5, 1/sqrt(84)=0.1091.

But wait, looking at the options, option E says .1582 : .4998 : .1092, which would be Ar:He:Kr. Which is the same as what I have.

Wait, but I thought the order in the question is Ar, He, Kr. So option E is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. The options are presented as the rates for Ar, He, Kr.

Looking at option E: .1582 : .4998 : .1092.

Yes, this matches the values I calculated.

So the correct answer is option E.

To compare the relative rates at which Ar, He, and Kr diffuse through a common orifice under standard temperature and pressure, we use Graham's law of diffusion. Graham's law states that the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. The molar masses of the gases are approximately:

- Helium (He): 4 g/mol  
- Argon (Ar): 40 g/mol  
- Krypton (Kr): 84 g/mol  

The relative rates of diffusion are calculated as:

\[
\text{Rate} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}
\]

Thus, the relative rates for Ar, He, and Kr are:

\[
\text{Rate}_{\text{Ar}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{40}} \approx 0.1582, \quad \text{Rate}_{\text{He}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4}} = 0.5, \quad \text{Rate}_{\text{Kr}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{84}} \approx 0.1091
\]

These values correspond to the relative rates of diffusion in the order Ar : He : Kr. Comparing these calculated values to the options provided, the closest match is:

**Option E: .1582 : .4998 : .1092**

This option accurately represents the relative rates of diffusion for Ar, He, and Kr based on Graham's law.
