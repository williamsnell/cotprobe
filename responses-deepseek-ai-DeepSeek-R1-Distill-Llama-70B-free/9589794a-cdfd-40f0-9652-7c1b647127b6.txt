Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about research methods or statistics, I think. Let me try to figure it out. The question is asking about the ability to make inferences from a sample to a population. Hmm, right, I remember that this has something to do with validity, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms.

The options are A to J. Let's list them out again: reliability, face validity, internal validity, external validity, statistical significance, criterion validity, content validity, convergent validity, inter-rater reliability, construct validity.

Wait, the question is about making inferences from a sample to a population. Oh right, in statistics, when we take a sample and then draw conclusions about the whole population, that's related to external validity. Or wait, is it? Because I think external validity refers to whether the results can be generalized to other settings or populations, not just about the sample representing the population.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. So, internal validity is about whether the study actually measures what it's supposed to measure, like causality. External validity is about generalizing the results beyond the study. So, if a study has high external validity, it means the findings are applicable to other people or situations beyond just the sample used.

But wait, the question is about making inferences about the population from the sample. That sounds like statistical inference, which relies on the concept of external validity because it's about how well the sample represents the population. So the ability to do that would be external validity.

Looking at the options, option D is external validity. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me think again. There's also a thing called statistical validity, but that's not one of the options. Or maybe it's under a different term. Oh, no, the options don't include that.

Another point: Reliability is about consistency, like if a test gives the same result each time. So that's not it. Face validity is whether a measure appears to measure what it's supposed to, at face value. Internal validity is about causality. Criterion validity is about how well the measure predicts outcomes. Content validity is about whether the measure covers all aspects of what it's supposed to measure. Construct validity is about whether the measure actually measures the theoretical concept.

So the key here is making inferences from sample to population, which is about generalization. That falls under external validity.

The ability to make inferences about the behavior of a population from the behavior of a sample is referred to as external validity. This concept is about how well the findings from a sample can be generalized to the broader population. Among the given options, external validity (option D) is the correct answer because it directly relates to the generalizability of the sample's behavior to the population.

Answer: D
