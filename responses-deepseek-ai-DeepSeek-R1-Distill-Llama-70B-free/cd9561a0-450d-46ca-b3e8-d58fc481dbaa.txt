Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find out how many ways there are to divide a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets. Hmm, okay, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dividing a set into subsets, the approach often involves combinations and maybe factorials. Since the subsets are ordered, the order in which we arrange them matters. But wait, what does it mean for the subsets to be ordered? Oh right, it means that the sequence in which we list the subsets matters. So if I have subsets A, B, C, then the order A-B-C is different from B-A-C, and so on.

Wait, but the problem says the subsets are non-empty. So each subset must have at least one element. That's important because it rules out cases where a subset is empty, which would complicate things.

Let me think about the possible approaches. One way to tackle this is to think about assigning each element of the set to one of the three subsets. Since each element has three choices, the total number of ways without any restrictions would be 3^6. Let me calculate that: 3*3*3*3*3*3 = 729. But wait, that includes cases where one or more subsets are empty. Since the problem requires all subsets to be non-empty, I need to subtract those cases.

Oh right, this is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. The formula for the number of onto functions from a set to another set applies here. The number of ways to assign n elements into k non-empty subsets is given by k! multiplied by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, S(n,k). Alternatively, another formula using inclusion-exclusion is the sum from i=0 to k of (-1)^i * C(k,i) * (k-i)^n.

Wait, let me get that right. The inclusion-exclusion formula for the number of onto functions (which ensures all subsets are non-empty) is:

Number of ways = sum_{i=0 to k} (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (k - i)^n }

Here, n is the number of elements, which is 6, and k is the number of subsets, which is 3.

So plugging in the numbers:

Number of ways = C(3,0)*(3-0)^6 - C(3,1)*(3-1)^6 + C(3,2)*(3-2)^6 - C(3,3)*(3-3)^6.

Calculating each term:

C(3,0) is 1, so 1 * 3^6 = 729.

C(3,1) is 3, so 3 * 2^6 = 3*64=192.

C(3,2) is 3, so 3 * 1^6=3*1=3.

C(3,3) is 1, so 1 * 0^6=0.

Putting it all together with the signs:

729 - 192 + 3 - 0 = 729 - 192 is 537, plus 3 makes 540.

Wait, but that gives 540. But wait, is that the final answer?

Wait a second, no. Because the problem says the subsets are ordered. So if I'm using the inclusion-exclusion approach, the 540 would be the number of ways to assign the elements into 3 labeled, ordered subsets. Because each element's choice is independent, and the subsets are distinguishable (since order matters), this should be correct.

Alternatively, the formula for ordered subsets (like ordered partitions) is indeed k! * S(n,k), where S is the Stirling number of the second kind. Let me check what S(6,3) is.

I remember that S(6,3) can be calculated. I think S(6,3) is 90. Then 3! is 6, so 90 *6 = 540. Yep, that matches. So that's consistent.

So the total number of ways is 540, which would be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach might be to think about permutations. If the subsets are ordered, then it's like arranging the 6 elements into 3 ordered groups, each non-empty. So that's the same as the number of onto functions from 6 elements to 3 subsets, which we've already calculated as 540.

So the answer should be D:540.

To determine the number of ways to divide a set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of ways to assign \( n \) elements into \( k \) non-empty subsets is:

\[
\text{Number of ways} = \sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i \cdot \binom{k}{i} \cdot (k-i)^n
\]

Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 3 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
\text{Number of ways} = \binom{3}{0} \cdot (3-0)^6 - \binom{3}{1} \cdot (3-1)^6 + \binom{3}{2} \cdot (3-2)^6 - \binom{3}{3} \cdot (3-3)^6
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \( \binom{3}{0} \cdot 3^6 = 1 \cdot 729 = 729 \)
2. \( \binom{3}{1} \cdot 2^6 = 3 \cdot 64 = 192 \)
3. \( \binom{3}{2} \cdot 1^6 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \)
4. \( \binom{3}{3} \cdot 0^6 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \)

Combining these with the appropriate signs:

\[
729 - 192 + 3 - 0 = 540
\]

Thus, the number of ways to divide the set of 6 elements into 3 non-empty ordered subsets is 540. This matches the option labeled **D**.
