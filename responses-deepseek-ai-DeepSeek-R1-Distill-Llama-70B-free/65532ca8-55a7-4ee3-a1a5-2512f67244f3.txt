Okay, so I've got this problem here about minimizing the cost of mimeographing copies. The cost function is given as C(x) = 0.005x + 4500/x. Hmm, I need to find the number of copies x that makes this cost the lowest possible. Alright, I'm a bit rusty on calculus, but let's try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that to find the minimum of a function, you usually take its derivative and set it equal to zero. So the plan is: find the first derivative of C(x), set it to zero, and solve for x. Then, I'll probably need to check if that point is a minimum, maybe using the second derivative or some other method.

So the function is C(x) = 0.005x + 4500/x. Let me write that down. Let's see, the derivative of C with respect to x will be the derivative of each term added together. 

The derivative of 0.005x is straightforward. The derivative of a linear term ax is just a, so that part is 0.005. 

Now the second term is 4500/x, which can also be written as 4500 * x^(-1). The derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1), so applying that here, the derivative of 4500*x^(-1) should be 4500*(-1)*x^(-2), which simplifies to -4500/x².

Putting it all together, the first derivative C’(x) is 0.005 - (4500)/(x²).

Now, to find the critical points, I set C’(x) equal to zero:

0.005 - (4500)/(x²) = 0

Let me solve for x. Let's move the second term to the other side:

0.005 = 4500 / x²

Then, multiply both sides by x² to get rid of the denominator:

0.005 * x² = 4500

Now, divide both sides by 0.005 to isolate x²:

x² = 4500 / 0.005

Wait, let me compute that. 4500 divided by 0.005. Hmm. Well, 0.005 is 5 thousandths, which is 5e-3. So 4500 divided by 5e-3 is the same as 4500 * (200), because 1/0.005 is 200. Let me check: 0.005 * 200 equals 1, so yes, 4500 * 200 = 900,000.

So x² = 900,000. Taking the square root of both sides gives x = sqrt(900,000). Let's compute that. What's sqrt(900,000)?

Well, sqrt(900) is 30, and sqrt(1000) is about 31.62, but wait, 900,000 is 9 * 10^5, so sqrt(9e5) is 3 * sqrt(1e5). Wait, sqrt(1e5) is sqrt(100,000) which is 316.2277... So 3 times that is about 948.68. Let me compute it more accurately. 316.2277 *3 is 948.6831. So x is approximately 948.68 copies.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, there's option H: 949 copies, which is very close to this number. So that's probably the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me go through each step again.

The derivative: dC/dx is 0.005 - 4500/x². Setting to zero gives 0.005 = 4500/x². 

So 4500/x² = 0.005 → x² = 4500 / 0.005. 

4500 divided by 0.005: 0.005 is 5e-3, so 4500 /5e-3 = (4500 /5) * (1e3) → 900 * 1000 = 900,000. So x²=9e5. Square root is sqrt(9e5)=sqrt(9)*sqrt(1e5)=3*sqrt(1e5). 

What's sqrt(1e5)? 1e5 is 10^5, so sqrt(10^5)=10^(5/2)=10^2 * 10^0.5=100 * sqrt(10). Since sqrt(10) is about 3.1623, 100 * 3.1623 is 316.23. Multiply by 3: 316.23 *3 = 948.69, approximately 948.7 copies. So 949 is the closest option, which is option H.

Wait a second, but I should also confirm whether this critical point is indeed a minimum. How can I do that? I can take the second derivative and check if it's positive at this point. If the second derivative is positive, the function is concave upwards, so it's a minimum.

The second derivative of C(x) would be the derivative of C’(x). Let me compute that. C’(x)=0.005 -4500 x^(-2). The derivative of 0.005 is zero, and the derivative of -4500 x^(-2) is (-4500)*(-2) x^(-3)=9000 x^(-3)=9000/(x^3). So C''(x) = 9000/(x^3).

At x=949, which is positive, so C''(x) is positive (since 9000 and x^3 are positive). Therefore, the function is concave upwards at this point, which means it's a minimum. So yes, x=949 is indeed the point where the cost is minimized.

Looking back at the options, option H is 949 copies. So the correct answer should be H.

To minimize the cost function \( C(x) = 0.005x + \frac{4500}{x} \), we first find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( C(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and setting it equal to zero:

\[
C'(x) = 0.005 - \frac{4500}{x^2}.
\]

Setting \( C'(x) = 0 \):

\[
0.005 - \frac{4500}{x^2} = 0.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
0.005 = \frac{4500}{x^2}.
\]

Multiplying through by \( x^2 \):

\[
0.005x^2 = 4500.
\]

Dividing by 0.005:

\[
x^2 = \frac{4500}{0.005} = 900,000.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{900,000} \approx 948.68.
\]

Since 948.68 is very close to 949, the number of copies that minimizes the cost is approximately 949.

To confirm this is a minimum, we compute the second derivative:

\[
C''(x) = \frac{9000}{x^3}.
\]

At \( x = 949 \), \( C''(x) > 0 \), indicating the function is concave upwards, confirming a minimum.

Thus, the number of copies that minimizes the cost is **949**, corresponding to option H.
