Okay, so I've got this question about attachment styles in infants, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario: A mother and her infant are alone in a room. Then a stranger enters, and the mother leaves. When the mother returns, the infant starts crying and keeps crying even after being picked up. But eventually, the infant calms down and starts playing happily again.

Hmm, I remember that attachment styles are categorized into different types based on how the infant reacts when the caregiver leaves and returns. The main ones are secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant (or ambivalent), and disorganized-disoriented.

So, in the scenario, the infant is distressed when the mother leavesâ€”that's a normal reaction. But what happens when she comes back is key. The infant cries and continues even when picked up. Wait, but then the infant settles down and plays happily. 

Wait, what's the difference between the attachment types here. Securely attached infants might get upset when the mother leaves, but when she returns, they're comforted by her presence, maybe cry but then calm down quickly and go back to playing. Sounds like this scenario: the infant is upset, but after being picked up, eventually calms down.

Anxious-avoidant infants don't show much distress when the mother leaves. They might even avoid her when she comes back. Anxious-resistant or ambivalent infants get very upset when the mother leaves and are hard to comfort when she returns. They might cling but still seem upset. Disorganized-disoriented is when the infant shows confused or contradictory behaviors, like approaching the mother but then freezing or acting scared.

In this case, the infant is upset, keeps crying when the mother returns but then is comforted and plays. So that's more like the secure attachment because after some time, the infant settles down. Wait, but the initial reaction when the mother returns is continued crying. Does that fit with secure?

Alternatively, anxious-resistant might have the infant being harder to comfort. But in this case, the infant does eventually settle down and play happily. So maybe it's secure because the infant uses the mother as a secure base. The crying upon the mother's return could indicate some anxiety, but the fact that the infant is comforted suggests secure attachment.

Wait, what about the anxious-avoidant? No, they usually don't seek comfort and might avoid the mother. So the infant here is seeking comfort, just takes a bit longer.

So the correct answer is J: Secure.

The infant in the scenario exhibits behaviors consistent with a secure attachment classification. When the mother leaves, the infant becomes distressed, which is a normal reaction. Upon her return, the infant initially continues to cry but is eventually comforted by the mother, calms down, and resumes playing happily. This response indicates that the infant uses the mother as a secure base, showing resilience and the ability to be comforted after a brief period of distress. 

Other attachment styles can be ruled out: anxious-avoidant infants typically avoid the mother upon her return, anxious-resistant infants are harder to comfort and remain distressed, and disorganized-disoriented infants exhibit contradictory or confused behaviors. The infant's ability to settle down and play happily aligns most closely with secure attachment.

Answer: J
