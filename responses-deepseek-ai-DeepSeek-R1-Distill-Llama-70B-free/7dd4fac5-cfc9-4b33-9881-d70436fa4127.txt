Okay, so I've got this problem here about gas expansion and work. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a gas is in a 2.0-liter container under 2.4 atmospheres of pressure. Then it's allowed to expand against a pressure of 0.80 atmosphere. I need to find the work involved. The options are all in L atm units, so I remember that work is calculated using pressure and volume changes.

Wait, right. In thermodynamics, when a gas expands against an external pressure, the work done by the gas is given by P_ext times the change in volume. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is work equals -P_ext multiplied by the change in volume. Or was it positive? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the first law of thermodynamics says that work done by the system is negative when the system loses energy. So if the gas is expanding, it's doing work on the surroundings, so the work should be negative. But wait, the formula might be W = -P_ext * ΔV. So that would make sense since if the system is expanding, ΔV is positive, so W would be negative, meaning work done by the system.

But wait another thing—what's the initial and final pressure here? The gas is expanding against a constant external pressure. Oh, so the external pressure is 0.80 atm. So the work done by the gas is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume, but with a negative sign.

Wait, but wait. The initial pressure is 2.4 atm, and the external is 0.8 atm. So the gas will expand until its internal pressure equals the external pressure, right? Or is it expanding against a constant external pressure? I think it's the latter. So the gas does work as it pushes against that external pressure.

So the formula for work when expanding against a constant external pressure is W = -P_ext * ΔV. But ΔV is the change in volume, which would be V_final - V_initial.

But wait, how do we find V_final? Because the initial state is P1, V1, and after expansion, it's P2, V2. But since the expansion is against a constant external pressure, which is 0.80 atm, I think the final pressure equals that external pressure. Or does it? Because when the gas expands, it's pushing against that pressure, so the final pressure of the gas is the external pressure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ideal gas law. But since the problem doesn't mention temperature or the number of moles, perhaps it's an isothermal process? Or maybe not, but I might not need that. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the expansion is such that the volume changes until the internal pressure equals the external pressure. So the gas goes from P_initial =2.4 atm to P_final =0.8 atm. But wait, no, when a gas expands against a constant external pressure, the process stops when the internal pressure equals that external pressure. So the final pressure of the gas is 0.8 atm.

So, initial state: P1=2.4 atm, V1=2.0 L.

Final state: P2=0.8 atm, V2=?

Using Boyle's Law, maybe? If the temperature is constant, then P1 V1 = P2 V2.

Wait, but if the expansion is against a constant external pressure, I'm not sure if it's isothermal. But since the problem gives just two pressures and a volume, perhaps assuming it's a reversible isothermal process isn't correct. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of work done when a gas expands against a constant external pressure.

Wait, the formula for work when expanding against a constant external pressure is W = -P_ext (V_final - V_initial). So I need to find V_final.

If the gas expands, then V_final is greater than V_initial. But how to find V_final?

Wait, another approach: Since the gas is expanding against the external pressure, the work done is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume, but the sign depends on whether it's expansion or compression.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the gas does work until its pressure drops to the external pressure. So the initial volume is 2.0 L at 2.4 atm. The final volume would be when the internal pressure equals 0.8 atm, assuming it's a reversible process where the expansion stops when the pressures equal.

So using Boyle's Law: P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1.

Plugging in the numbers: (2.4 atm / 0.8 atm) * 2.0 L = 3 * 2.0 L = 6.0 L.

So the change in volume is V2 - V1 = 6.0 L - 2.0 L = 4.0 L.

Then the work done by the gas is W = -P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, P_ext is 0.8 atm, and ΔV is 4.0 L. So W = -0.8 atm * 4.0 L = -3.2 L·atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is -3.2 L·atm. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but another thought—did I get the signs right? Because when the gas expands, the work done by the gas is negative from the system's perspective. So in terms of the work done on the gas, it's positive if compressed, negative if expanded. So the formula W = -P_ext * ΔV is correct. Because when ΔV is positive (expansion), W is negative, meaning work done by the system.

So according to this, the calculation is correct. So the answer should be E: -3.2 L atm.

To determine the work involved when a gas in a 2.0-liter container at 2.4 atmospheres expands against a constant external pressure of 0.80 atmosphere, we use the formula for work done during expansion against a constant external pressure:

\[
W = -P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V
\]

Here, \( P_{\text{ext}} = 0.80 \, \text{atm} \), and \( \Delta V = V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}} \). The initial volume is given as \( V_{\text{initial}} = 2.0 \, \text{L} \), and the initial pressure is \( P_{\text{initial}} = 2.4 \, \text{atm} \). Assuming the gas expands until its internal pressure equals the external pressure (\( P_{\text{final}} = 0.80 \, \text{atm} \)), we can use Boyle's Law (\( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \)) to calculate \( V_{\text{final}} \):

\[
V_{\text{final}} = \frac{P_{\text{initial}}}{P_{\text{final}}} \cdot V_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2.4 \, \text{atm}}{0.80 \, \text{atm}} \cdot 2.0 \, \text{L} = 6.0 \, \text{L}.
\]

The change in volume is:

\[
\Delta V = V_{\text{final}} - V_{\text{initial}} = 6.0 \, \text{L} - 2.0 \, \text{L} = 4.0 \, \text{L}.
\]

Substituting into the work formula:

\[
W = -P_{\text{ext}} \cdot \Delta V = -(0.80 \, \text{atm}) \cdot (4.0 \, \text{L}) = -3.2 \, \text{L·atm}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that the gas is doing work on the surroundings during expansion. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: -3.2 L atm**
