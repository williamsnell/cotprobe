Okay, so I've got this group theory question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question presents two statements and asks about their validity. The options are from A to J.

Statement 1: If a finite group has order n, then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n.

Statement 2: If a is an element of a finite group, then the order of a (denoted |a|) divides the order of the group |G|.

Alright, let's break this down.

Starting with Statement 1. I remember something called Lagrange's Theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group. But wait, does that mean the converse is true? Like, for every divisor d of |G|, there's a subgroup of order d? Oh right, that's Sylow's Theorems, I think. Or wait, maybe it's the converse of Lagrange's. Oh, right! The statement I'm thinking of is that every finite group has subgroups of every order dividing the group's order if and only if the group is abelian or something? Or no, wait, that's not right.

Wait, no. I think it's called the "Converser of Lagrange's Theorem," but I'm not sure if that's actually a theorem. Because I remember that in general, finite groups don't necessarily have subgroups for every divisor. For example, the alternating group A4 has order 12, right? What are the divisors of 12? 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Does A4 have subgroups of all these orders?

I recall that A4 doesn't have a subgroup of order 6. Let me think. A4 has elements like the 3-cycles and double transpositions. The 3-cycles would generate subgroups of order 3, and the double transpositions (like (12)(34)) would be order 2. Wait, but for order 6, you'd need a subgroup where the elements have order 6 or maybe a combination. Hmm, but I think A4 doesn't have a subgroup of order 6, which is a divisor of 12. So that would mean Statement 1 is not true in general, because A4 is a counterexample.

So Statement 1 is not necessarily true for every finite group. Therefore, the first statement is false. That would mean any options that say Statement 1 is true can be considered incorrect unless there's a condition.

Now, what about Statement 2: If a is an element of a finite group, then |a| divides |G|. I'm pretty sure that's a standard result. Yeah, Lagrange's Theorem says that the order of the element divides the order of the group. Because the order of a is the size of the cyclic subgroup generated by a, and by Lagrange's Theorem, this size divides |G|. So Statement 2 is definitely true.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. Now looking at the options:

Option H: False, True. That would fit.

Looking at the other options, like option J: Statement 1 is true only for cyclic groups, Statement 2 is true. Wait, but Statement 1 isn't true even for non-cyclic groups. Wait, no. For cyclic groups, Statement 1 is true because they have subgroups of every order dividing |G|. But the original Statement 1 says "for every finite group", which isn't the case because A4 is a non-cyclic group where Statement 1 fails. So Statement 1 isn't universally true; it's only true for cyclic groups. So if the question's Statement 1 is about all finite groups, then it's false. But if the statement was about cyclic groups, it would be true.

Wait, but the question says Statement 1 is about any finite group. Therefore, the statement is not true in general. So option J says Statement 1 is true only for cyclic groups, which is correct, but the way Statement 1 is phrased in the question, it's making a general claim about all finite groups. So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. So the correct option is H: False, True.

Wait, but what about option E? Statement 1 is true only for abelian groups, Statement 2 is true. But no, because even some abelian groups might have Statement 1 failing, but wait no, wait. Wait, actually, no, because in abelian groups, every finite abelian group is a product of cyclic groups of prime power order (the fundamental theorem). So in abelian groups, do they have subgroups for every divisor? I think yes. Because if the group is abelian, it's a product of cyclic groups, and you can construct subgroups by taking appropriate products. So for abelian groups, Statement 1 is true. But the question's Statement 1 says "any finite group", which includes non-abelian groups where Statement 1 can fail, like A4. So Statement 1 is true only if the group is abelian. But the question's Statement 1 is making a general claim, so it's false.

Wait, but then looking back, the options:

Option E: Statement 1 is true only for abelian groups, Statement 2 is true.

So in reality, Statement 1 is true for abelian groups, but false otherwise. So the question's Statement 1 is presented as a general statement, so it's false. So the correct assessment is that Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is true. So the correct option is H.

Wait, but wait, another thought. What about the classification of finite abelian groups? They have subgroups for every divisor. So Statement 1 is true for abelian groups, but false otherwise. So in the question, Statement 1 is a general statement about any finite group, so it's false. So the correct answer is H.

Statement 1 claims that if a finite group has order \( n \), then the group contains a subgroup of order \( d \) for every positive divisor \( d \) of \( n \). This is not true in general. For example, the alternating group \( A_4 \), which has order 12, does not have a subgroup of order 6, even though 6 divides 12. This shows that Statement 1 is false for non-abelian groups. However, it is true for abelian groups due to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, which guarantees subgroups for every divisor of the group's order.

Statement 2 asserts that if \( a \) is an element of a finite group, then the order of \( a \) (denoted \( |a| \)) divides the order of the group \( |G| \). This is a standard result from Lagrange's Theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup (including the cyclic subgroup generated by \( a \)) divides the order of the group. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.

Given the assessment, Statement 1 is false when applied to all finite groups, and Statement 2 is true. The correct option is:

**H: False, True.**
