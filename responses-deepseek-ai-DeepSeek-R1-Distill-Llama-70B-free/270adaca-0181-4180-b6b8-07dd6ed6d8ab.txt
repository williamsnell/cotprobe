Question:

A defendant was charged with vehicular battery after driving through a red light and crashing into a woman's small convertible. The woman suffered massive internal injuries and lapsed into a coma for several hours after she reached the hospital. The woman's best friend, who was a passenger in the car, miraculously received only a few minor bruises. After the collision, the passenger stayed with the woman trying to comfort her until the ambulance arrived. At trial, the passenger is called to testify. While on the witness stand, she gazes with sorrow at the woman, who is still wearing a cast on her leg. The passenger testifies that the first thing she remembered seeing after the accident was the woman's bloodied body trapped in the mangled wreckage. The state's attorney then asked the passenger if the woman said anything to her before being taken to the hospital. The passenger answered, "Yes, she told me: I know I'm dying. Why did he have to run that red light?"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the court should rule the passenger's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the woman's statement could be considered prejudicial against the defendant.
B: admissible, because it is irrelevant that this is not a homicide case.
C: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: inadmissible, because of the close relationship between the woman and the passenger.
E: admissible, because the woman's statement was made as part of her medical history.
F: inadmissible, because the woman's statement is speculative and not a fact.
G: admissible, because the woman believed her death was imminent when she made the declaration.
H: inadmissible, because the passenger's emotional state might affect her memory of the event.
I: admissible, because the passenger is a direct witness to the accident.
J: admissible, because the woman's statement is a spontaneous utterance made under stress.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is a trial where a defendant is charged with vehicular battery. The defendant ran a red light and hit a woman's car. The woman had severe injuries and was in a coma, but her passenger only had minor bruises. The passenger is testifying, and she mentions that the woman said, "I know I'm dying. Why did he have to run that red light?" The defense objected, and we need to decide if this testimony is admissible.

First, I remember that hearsay is a big issue in evidence law. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the statement is hearsay, it's inadmissible unless there's an exception.

So, the woman's statement is being offered to prove that the defendant ran a red light, which would make him liable. That's the truth of the matter, so it's hearsay. Now, I need to think about the exceptions.

One exception is the dying declaration. But wait, dying declarations usually apply in homicide cases or when the declarant is dead. Here, the woman survived because she's in court with a cast. So, that exception might not apply because she didn't die. But wait, she was in a coma, so maybe she thought she was dying at the time of the statement.

Alternatively, there's the exception for excited utterances, also known as spontaneous declarations. These are statements made under the stress of a startling event and relate to that event. The idea is that the stress makes the statement reliable because there's no time to fabricate.

In this case, right after the crash, the woman was in a lot of pain and distress, thinking she was dying. Her statement was made right after the accident when she was still under the stress of the event. So maybe it's an excited utterance.

Wait, but the statement includes "Why did he have to run that red light?" That's a bit of an accusation. But excited utterances can include statements that are expressions of the event as it's happening or immediately after, even if they include some accusations, as long as they're part of the spontaneous reaction.

So the passenger's testimony about the woman's statement would fall under the excited utterance exception, making it admissible. That would mean the court should overrule the objection.

Looking at the options:

Option J says it's admissible because it's a spontaneous utterance made under stress. That fits what I was thinking.

Option G talks about a dying declaration, but since the woman didn't die, that exception doesn't apply here. So G is probably incorrect.

Option C says it's inadmissible as hearsay without exception. But if there's an exception like excited utterance, then C is wrong.

Other options: A says it's inadmissible because it's prejudicial. But the best evidence rule isn't about prejudice; it's about hearsay. So A isn't the main issue here.

Option J seems correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the injured woman to her passenger shortly after a car accident. The statement, "I know I'm dying. Why did he have to run that red light?" is being offered into evidence, and the defense has objected. The key issue is whether this statement qualifies as hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the woman's statement is being used to prove that the defendant ran a red light, making it hearsay. However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under an exception. Two potential exceptions are relevant: the dying declaration and the excited utterance (spontaneous statement).

1. **Dying Declaration**: This exception applies when the declarant believes their death is imminent and makes a statement about the cause or circumstances of their impending death. However, this exception typically applies in homicide cases or when the declarant actually dies. In this case, the woman survived, so this exception does not apply.

2. **Excited Utterance (Spontaneous Statement)**: This exception applies to statements made under the stress of a startling event or condition, provided the statement relates to the event. The woman's statement was made immediately after the accident, while she was still under the stress of the collision and believed she was dying. This makes the statement admissible as an excited utterance.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The statement's potential prejudice does not determine its admissibility; the issue is whether it is hearsay and whether an exception applies.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The relevance of whether this is a homicide case is not the determining factor.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the statement is hearsay, it falls under the excited utterance exception, making it admissible.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The relationship between the woman and the passenger is irrelevant to the admissibility of the statement.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The statement is not part of the woman's medical history.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The statement is not speculative; it directly relates to the accident.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The dying declaration exception does not apply because the woman survived.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The passenger's emotional state does not affect the admissibility of the statement.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The passenger's status as a direct witness does not make the statement admissible; the issue is hearsay.
- **Option J**: Correct. The statement is admissible as a spontaneous utterance made under the stress of the accident.

The correct answer is **J**.

Answer: J
