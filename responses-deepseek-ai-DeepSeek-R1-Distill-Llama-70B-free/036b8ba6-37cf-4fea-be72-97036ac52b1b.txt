Okay, so I've got this question about normal heart rate for an adult at rest. Hmm, I remember that heart rate can vary based on factors like age, fitness level, and health. Let me think.

I've heard that the average resting heart rate is around 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm), but I'm not totally sure. Wait, no, that's for adults. Or was it a different range? Sometimes I get confused because athletes might have lower rates. Oh right, athletes can have resting heart rates as low as 40-50 bpm because their hearts are more efficient.

So the question is asking for a normal range. The options given are A through J. Let's look at the options again. Option A is 60-110, which seems a bit high on the upper end. B is 70-90, that's within the 60-100 range I was thinking. C is 50-80, which seems a bit low on the lower end unless someone is very fit. D is 60-80, which is narrower. E is 60-90, a bit narrower than the 60-100 I remember. F is 80-100, which is on the higher side. G is 40-60, which I think is too low for a normal adult unless they're an athlete. H is 70-110, which extends the higher end beyond 100. I is 50-70, again lower. J is 60-100, which matches what I initially thought.

Wait, but wait. I think the standard normal range is typically cited as 60 to 100 bpm. So the correct answer should be the option that includes 60-100. Let me check the options again. Option J is 60-100, which would be the correct one. But wait, some sources say that while 60-100 is normal, the average is around 70-75. So why is the option B 70-90? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up resting heart rate and target heart rate. No, the question is definitely about resting. So normal resting heart rate for adults is 60-100 bpm. So the correct option is J:60-100.

Wait, but wait another thing. I've heard that some medical guidelines have slightly different ranges. Let me think. Oh, maybe some say 60-100 is normal, but sometimes they might present a tighter range as average. For example, 70-100 is sometimes mentioned, but that's perhaps for a different context.

Wait, no, the widely accepted range is 60-100. So the correct answer should be option J, which is 60-100 bpm.

The normal resting heart rate for an adult typically ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). This range accounts for variations due to factors like fitness level and health. Athletes may have lower rates, but for the general adult population, 60-100 bpm is considered normal. Among the given options, the one that matches this range is:

J: 60-100 bpm.

Answer: J
