Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about imbalances in the sex ratio of sexual species that have two sexes. So, when the ratio isn't 50:50, the minority sex gets more care and resources from parents than the majority. The question is asking which type of selection this is an example of.

Hmm, I remember that selection has various types—natural selection, sexual selection, kin selection, etc. I need to think about each option.

The scenario says that the minority sex (like if there are more females than males or vice versa) receives more resources. So, parents are investing more in the offspring of the less common sex. This seems related to how parents allocate resources to maximize their reproductive success.

Wait, what about Trivers and Robert Trivers' work on parental investment? Oh right, Trivers and the idea of parental investment theory. He talked about how the sex that invests more in offspring (usually females) becomes a limiting resource for the other sex (males), leading to sexual selection.

But wait, the question is about the imbalance in sex ratio leading to more care for the minority. So, if there are more males, females are the minority and get more resources. This could influence mate choice or competition.

Alternatively, this might be about frequency-dependent selection. Frequency dependence is when the fitness of a trait depends on its frequency in the population. For example, if a certain trait becomes more common, it's less advantageous because predators target it more. So, in this case, if one sex is less common, it's more advantageous, so parents invest more in them.

Wait, but frequency-dependent selection usually refers to selection that depends on the frequency of a trait. So, if the minority sex has higher fitness because of their rarity, that's frequency-dependent. So, when the sex ratio is skewed, the minority gets more resources, which could be because their frequency affects their fitness. So parents are perhaps choosing to invest more in the rarer sex to maximize their own reproductive success.

Alternatively, sexual selection involves competition for mates and choosing mates based on certain traits. But this seems more about parental investment based on sex ratio.

Another angle: the idea of sex allocation. In some species, parents adjust the sex ratio of their offspring based on various factors. For example, in some birds, if they have more sons, they might invest more in them if sons are more costly but have higher potential reproductive success when resources are abundant.

Wait, but the question says that when the sex ratio is imbalanced, the minority gets more resources. So, it's a response to the existing ratio, not the initial allocation.

So, maybe this is an example of frequency-dependent selection because the value of each sex depends on their frequency. When a sex is rare, it's more valuable, so parents invest more. This could stabilize the sex ratio over time.

Alternatively, it's about natural selection because it's about differential survival or reproductive success based on the environment. But I'm not sure.

Looking at the options:

A: Artificial selection – No, that's humans selecting for traits.

B: Sexual selection – More about mate choice and competition for mates.

C: Frequency-dependent selection – Fitness depends on frequency in population.

D: Directional selection – Selection in one direction, leading to a shift in trait mean.

E: Kin selection – Helping relatives, about inclusive fitness.

F: Stabilizing selection – Favors average traits, reduces variance.

G: Intra-sexual selection – Competition within the same sex for mates.

H: Balancing selection – Maintains genetic diversity, like heterozygote advantage.

I: Disruptive selection – Favors extreme traits, leading to divergence.

J: Natural selection – General process, but the question is about a specific type.

So, the scenario is about the frequency of each sex influencing the care received. So, when a sex is less common, it's more advantageous (maybe because they have better mating opportunities), so parents invest more. That sounds like frequency-dependent selection because the benefit depends on how common each sex is.

So the answer would be C: frequency-dependent selection.

The question involves understanding the type of selection that occurs when imbalances in the sex ratio of a species lead to the minority sex receiving greater care and resources from parents. This scenario suggests that the fitness of each sex depends on its frequency in the population, as the rarer sex becomes more advantageous due to its scarcity. This is a hallmark of frequency-dependent selection, where the value or fitness of a trait (in this case, being a specific sex) is influenced by its frequency within the population. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Artificial selection** refers to human-induced selection and is irrelevant here.  
- **B: Sexual selection** involves mate choice or competition for mates, which does not directly explain the resource allocation based on sex ratio.  
- **C: Frequency-dependent selection** fits because the minority sex's advantage is tied to its rarity, aligning with the concept of fitness depending on frequency.  
- **D: Directional selection** involves selection in one direction, shifting the population mean, which does not apply here.  
- **E: Kin selection** involves helping relatives to enhance inclusive fitness, which is unrelated to this scenario.  
- **F: Stabilizing selection** favors average traits, reducing variance, which does not explain the observed phenomenon.  
- **G: Intra-sexual selection** refers to competition within the same sex for mates, which is not the focus here.  
- **H: Balancing selection** maintains genetic diversity, which is not relevant to this question.  
- **I: Disruptive selection** favors extreme traits, leading to divergence, which does not apply here.  
- **J: Natural selection** is a broader concept, but the question specifically asks for a subtype of selection.  

The correct answer is **C: Frequency-dependent selection**, as the scenario describes how the fitness of each sex depends on its frequency in the population, with the minority sex receiving greater resources due to its rarity.
