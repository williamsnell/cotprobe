Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Savigny's notion of Volksgeist. I'm a bit rusty on my legal philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Savigny was a key figure in the historical school of jurisprudence. He believed that law is not just something imposed by a ruler but rather something that grows organically from the spirit of the people, the Volksgeist. So, the idea is that law is deeply embedded in the culture, traditions, and collective consciousness of a society.

Looking at the options, I need to find the statement least likely to follow from this idea. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: "Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will." Hmm, Savigny's view opposes the idea that law is created by a sovereign's command. He was against the idea of law being imposed top-down, so this statement probably wouldn't follow from his Volksgeist notion. It sounds more like legal positivism, maybe someone like Austin.

Option B: "Law is an integral element of the social fabric." That fits well because Savigny saw law as part of the broader social and cultural context, not separate from it. So this would follow.

Option C: "Law is the direct outcome of a society's economic structure." Wait, that sounds more Marxist, like the base-superstructure model where economy determines law. Savigny's approach was more about culture and tradition, not economic determinism. So this might not follow from his ideas.

Option D: "Law is like language." Oh right, Savigny compared law to language because both are expressions of the Volksgeist and evolve organically over time. So this definitely follows.

Option E: "A society's law is a reflection of its culture." That's exactly what Volksgeist is about. Law reflects the collective spirit and culture, so this follows.

Option F: "Law is merely a tool for oppression by the ruling class." That sounds like a Marxist or critical legal studies perspective. Savigny's view was more about organic growth and cultural embedding, not about law being a tool of oppression. So this might not follow.

Now I need to determine which option is least likely. The question is which statement doesn't fit with Savigny's ideas.

So, options A and C and F are possibilities. Let me think again.

Savigny opposed the idea of law being created by a sovereign (A), so A is the opposite of his view. Similarly, C is about economic structure determining law, which isn't part of his theory. F is about law as a tool of oppression, which also doesn't fit.

Wait, the question is which is least likely to follow. So which of these is most opposed to Savigny.

Savigny's Volksgeist is about law being an organic part of the people's spirit, so any statement that suggests law is imposed (like A) or economically determined (C) or a tool for oppression (F) would be inconsistent.

But between A, C, F, which is least likely.

I think A is directly opposed because Savigny was against the idea of law being the sovereign's will. His historical school reacted against the positivist notion that law is made by the state or sovereign.

Option C is more from Marx, so that's a different theory. Option F is also from a different school.

So the least likely statements would be A, C, and F.

Wait, the question is which is least likely to follow. So which is most opposite.

Savigny would not say A, because he's against that.

He would not say C, because he's more about culture than economics.

He would also not say F, because his view isn't about oppression but about organic growth.

So among the options, which is the least likely.

The question is which is least likely to follow. So the correct answer is the statement that doesn't fit with Volksgeist.

Option A is about sovereign's will, which is the opposite.

Option C is about economic structure, which is another theory.

Option F is about oppression, again a different perspective.

I think the least likely would be A, because Savigny explicitly opposed the idea of law being created by a sovereign.

But wait, let me think again. The question is which is least likely to follow, so which statement is not a consequence of Volksgeist.

If Savigny's idea is that law is part of the social fabric (B, D, E), then A is the opposite. So A is the least likely.

Wait, but another thought: Option C says law is the direct outcome of economic structure. That's a Marxist view. Savigny's view is more about culture and gradual development, so C wouldn't follow from his ideas. Similarly, F is a critical theory perspective, which Savigny didn't support.

So which of these is least likely. The question is about which is least likely to follow.

So in the options, A, C, F are all unlikely. The question is which is the least likely.

Wait, perhaps the least likely is either A or F. Because A is about the sovereign, which is directly opposed to Volksgeist. F is about ruling class oppression, which isn't part of Savigny's theory but also doesn't directly contradict it.

Hmm. Alternatively, Savigny's approach might allow for some role of the ruling class, but it's not the main point.

Wait, the options are:

A: Law as sovereign's will.

B: Integral part of social fabric.

C: Outcome of economic structure.

D: Law like language.

E: Reflection of culture.

F: Tool for oppression.

Savigny's view aligns with B, D, E. So the least likely would be A, C, F.

Which is the least likely to follow. The question is asking for the statement that is least likely.

So I think option A is the least likely because it's the opposite of Savigny's notion.

Alternatively, C is also unlikely, but perhaps more so than A. Wait, no, Savigny's view is more about the collective spirit, so economic structure determining law is more of a base-superstructure model, which is a different theory. So C is also not following.

I'm a bit confused now. Let's think again.

Which of these statements would Savigny disagree with the most.

A: Sovereign's will. He would disagree, as he opposed positivism.

C: Economic structure. He didn't focus on economics, so this wouldn't follow.

F: Oppression tool. He didn't discuss this; his focus was on culture.

So the question is which statement is least likely to follow. So the correct answer is the one that doesn't fit at all.

I think the correct answer is A because Savigny's entire theory was against the idea that law is made by a sovereign. So A is the least likely.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is which is least likely to follow from Savigny's notion. So which statement would not be supported by his ideas.

So A says law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will. That's positivism, which Savigny opposed. So A would not follow from his ideas.

Similarly, C is about economic structure. That's not part of his theory. So C is also not supported.

Which one is less likely? Since the question is about which is least likely, perhaps A is more directly opposed.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C or F.

Wait, another angle: Savigny's view is that law is not imposed but grows organically. So any statement suggesting law is imposed (A) or economically determined (C) or a tool for oppression (F) would not follow.

But among these, the most opposite is A, because it's directly about the source of law.

So I think the correct answer is A.

Savigny's notion of Volksgeist emphasizes that law is an organic expression of a society's collective spirit, culture, and traditions, rather than something imposed by a sovereign or determined by external factors like economic structures. To determine which statement is least likely to follow from this idea, each option must be evaluated:

- **Option A**: "Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will." This directly contradicts Savigny's view, as he opposed the idea that law is created by a sovereign's command. This is a positivist perspective, which Savigny explicitly rejected.

- **Option B**: "Law is an integral element of the social fabric." This aligns with Savigny's belief that law is deeply embedded in the culture and traditions of a society.

- **Option C**: "Law is the direct outcome of a society's economic structure." This reflects a Marxist perspective, which is unrelated to Savigny's focus on culture and organic growth. It does not follow from his ideas.

- **Option D**: "Law is like language." Savigny often compared law to language, as both are organic expressions of the Volksgeist. This statement is consistent with his view.

- **Option E**: "A society's law is a reflection of its culture." This is a direct expression of Savigny's notion of Volksgeist, as law reflects the collective spirit and culture of a society.

- **Option F**: "Law is merely a tool for oppression by the ruling class." This is a critical legal studies perspective and does not align with Savigny's emphasis on organic growth and cultural embedding.

Among the options, **Option A** is the least likely to follow from Savigny's notion of Volksgeist, as it directly opposes his rejection of law being imposed by a sovereign. While Options C and F are also inconsistent with his ideas, Option A is the most directly opposed to his core beliefs.
