Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about contractionary monetary policy and its effects. Hmm, I remember that monetary policy involves the central bank adjusting the money supply. Contractionary means they're trying to reduce something, probably inflation, so they might be increasing interest rates or reducing the money supply.

Wait, contractionary monetary policy leads to reduced aggregate demand, right? Because if the money supply decreases, people and businesses have less to spend or invest. Higher interest rates would make loans more expensive, so less borrowing happens. That should decrease aggregate demand.

So if aggregate demand decreases, what happens to output and the price level? In the short run, I think the aggregate demand curve shifting left would cause both real GDP (output) to decrease and the price level to decrease as well. Because when AD is lower, businesses can't sell as much, so they lower production and prices.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The short run is where prices are sticky, so when AD decreases, the economy moves along the SRAS curve. If AD is lower, the price level does go down, but output also decreases because firms produce less. So yeah, both output and price level decrease.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Decreases, same, decreases. No, because output doesn't stay the same.

Option D: Decreases, decreases, increases. Wait, no, that would be if prices went up, which doesn't make sense.

Option I: All decreases. That seems right because AD down, so output and price both down.

Wait, but another thought: maybe in the short run, the price level doesn't adjust fully. So if AD decreases, output definitely goes down. What about prices? I'm pretty sure that in the short run, prices are somewhat flexible, so they do fall, but not as much as in the long run. So in the short run contractionary policy, AD decreases, output decreases, and price level decreases.

So looking at the options, which one says aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, and price level decreases. That's option I.

But wait, another point: I've heard that in the short run, the price level might not change much because of sticky prices. So maybe output decreases, and the price level doesn't change? But that doesn't sound right. I think when AD drops, businesses can't sell as much, so they lower prices. So yeah, price level decreases.

So the correct answer should be: Aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, price level decreases. That's option I.

In the short run, contractionary monetary policy reduces the money supply or increases interest rates, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand. With lower aggregate demand, businesses reduce production, causing output to decrease. Additionally, as aggregate demand falls, the price level also decreases because businesses cannot maintain higher prices with reduced demand. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, and the price level decreases.**
