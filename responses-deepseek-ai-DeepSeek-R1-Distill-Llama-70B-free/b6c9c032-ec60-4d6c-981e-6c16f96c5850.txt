Okay, so I've got this problem about the thickness of a quartz plate needed to produce a 180-degree rotation of a specific light wavelength. Hmm, I remember that this is something to do with optical activity or maybe wave plates. Oh right, quartz is a birefringent material, so it's used in things like wave plates which can rotate the plane of polarization.

Wait, the question says the plate is cut perpendicular to the optic axis. Oh yeah, that means it's a quarter-wave plate or something like that? Or wait, no, maybe it's a half-wave plate because we're talking about a rotation of 180 degrees. Oh wait, no, the rotation angle depends on the phase difference introduced by the plate.

I think the formula has something to do with the thickness being related to the wavelength and the specific rotation. Let me recall. Oh right, when a wave passes through a birefringent material, the phase shift depends on the difference in refractive indices for the two polarizations. 

The formula for the phase shift Δφ is (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d, where d is the thickness. But wait, I'm not sure if it's n_e - n_o or the other way around. Oh, right, for a wave plate, it's usually the difference between the extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices multiplied by the thickness.

Wait, but in this problem, I think they're talking about the optical rotation, which is the ability of certain materials to rotate the plane of polarization of light. For quartz, the rotation is given per unit length, I think. Oh yeah, the specific rotatory power. 

Wait, so for quartz, the specific rotation (or rotatory power) is given as a certain amount of degrees per millimeter, right? And the rotation is proportional to the thickness of the plate. So the formula would be θ = R * d, where R is the specific rotation and d is the thickness.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Does the specific rotation depend on the wavelength? Because quartz is a uniaxial crystal, and the rotation might vary with wavelength. Oh yeah, the problem gives a specific wavelength, so I need to account for that.

Wait, I thought the specific rotation for quartz is about 21.7 degrees per mm for the D line of sodium (which is around 589 nm), but here the wavelength is 435.8 nm. So I might need to adjust for the wavelength because the rotation varies with wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is θ = (2π/λ) * (d) * (n_l - n_r), where n_l and n_r are the refractive indices for left and right circularly polarized light. Wait, that might be the case. So the rotation angle θ would be proportional to the thickness and inversely proportional to the wavelength.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. For a given wavelength, the rotation per unit length (specific rotation) is a material constant. But when the wavelength changes, that rotation changes. Since blue light has a shorter wavelength, the rotation per mm would be higher than for longer wavelengths like red.

So if I know the specific rotation R at a certain wavelength, say R0 at λ0, then at a different wavelength λ, the specific rotation R would be R0 multiplied by (λ0/λ) squared or something like that? Or maybe it's inversely proportional to the wavelength.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the rotation is given by θ = (2π n d)/(λ) for some n. Or perhaps it's θ = (2π (n_e - n_o) d) / λ, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: For a half-wave plate, the thickness d is given by d = (m λ) / (2Δn), where m is an integer. But in this case, it's a rotation of 180 degrees, which is π radians. So maybe that's a half-wave condition.

Wait, but when a half-wave plate is placed in a certain orientation, it causes a phase shift of π, which can lead to a rotation of the polarization direction. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, maybe the rotation angle θ is given by θ = 2π (n_e - n_o) d / λ. So to get a 180-degree (π radians) rotation, we set θ = π. Then, solving for d gives d = (π λ) / (2π (n_e - n_o)) ) → d = λ/(2 (n_e - n_o)).

Wait, let me check the units. n_e and n_o are unitless, so the denominator is in terms of refractive index difference. The numerator is in meters, so the thickness d would be in meters. That makes sense.

But wait, what are the values of n_e and n_o for quartz? I think for quartz, n_o (ordinary refractive index) is about 1.544 and n_e (extraordinary) is about 1.553. So the difference (n_e - n_o) would be about 0.009. 

Wait, let me make sure. Let me think. At 435.8 nm, which is in the blue, the refractive indices are higher than at longer wavelengths. For example, I think n_o for quartz at 589 nm is about 1.544, and n_e is about 1.553. So the difference is about 0.009. But at shorter wavelengths, n_e and n_o would be higher, and the difference might stay roughly the same or change slightly. But perhaps for this problem, we can use the given values.

So if θ is π radians (180 degrees), then:

d = (θ λ) / (2π (n_e - n_o)) )

Wait, no, because θ = (2π (n_e - n_o) d) / λ. So rearranged, d = (θ λ) / (2π (n_e - n_o)) )

Wait θ is in radians. So θ = π, so substituting in:

d = (π * 435.8e-9 m) / (2π * 0.009) )

Wait, the 435.8e-9 is in meters, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m.

So the pi's cancel out:

d = (435.8e-9) / (2 * 0.009 )

Calculate the denominator: 2 * 0.009 = 0.018.

So d = (435.8e-9 m) / 0.018.

Let me compute that numerically.

435.8e-9 is 4.358e-7 meters.

So 4.358e-7 / 0.018 = ?

Let me compute 4.358e-7 divided by 0.018.

Well, 4.358e-7 / 1.8e-2 = (4.358 / 1.8) * 1e-5.

4.358 divided by 1.8: let's see. 1.8 * 2 = 3.6, so 4.358 -3.6 is 0.758. 0.758 / 1.8 is approximately 0.421.

So 2.421 * 1e-5 meters. 1e-5 meters is 1e-3 mm, so that's 2.421e-3 mm? Wait, wait, that can't be right because that would be 0.0024 mm, which is way too small. But the options are all in the mm range, like 4.9 mm, etc. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the rotation angle is given by a different factor.

Wait another approach: I remember that the optical rotation for a quartz plate is given by θ = R * d, where R is the specific rotation in degrees per mm. So if I can find R at 435.8 nm, then θ is 180 degrees, so d = θ / R.

But what's R at 435.8 nm? I know that for the sodium D line (589 nm), R is about 21.7 degrees/mm. But since the rotation is dispersive, R changes with wavelength. The variation is such that R is inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength. Or maybe it's inversely proportional to the wavelength? I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, I think the specific rotation R is inversely proportional to the wavelength. So R ∝ 1/λ. So if R0 is the rotation at λ0, then R at λ is R0 * (λ0/λ).

So for λ0 = 589 nm, R0 = 21.7 deg/mm.

At λ = 435.8 nm, R = 21.7 * (589 / 435.8) ≈ 21.7 * (1.353) ≈ let's calculate that.

21.7 * 1 = 21.7, 21.7 * 0.353 ≈ 7.66. So total R ≈ 29.36 degrees/mm.

So now, with θ = 180 degrees, d = θ / R = 180 / 29.36 ≈ 6.13 mm.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 6.13. The closest is option H: 6.25 mm. But wait, perhaps my approximation of R is off because I assumed R is inversely proportional to λ, but maybe it's a different relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the dependence is R ∝ 1/λ^2. Let me try that.

R = R0 * (λ0 / λ)^2.

So λ0 is 589, λ is 435.8.

So 589/435.8 ≈ 1.353. Squared is approx 1.832.

So R = 21.7 * 1.832 ≈ 39.72 degrees/mm.

Then d = 180 / 39.72 ≈ 4.533 mm.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.36 mm, option B is 4.9, option J is 3.5.

Hmm, 4.53 is not exactly in the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the relationship between R and wavelength.

Wait, perhaps the specific rotation R is proportional to the reciprocal of the wavelength. So R = R0 * λ0/λ.

Wait, let me think again. If R is proportional to 1/λ, that's what I did earlier, getting R ≈ 29.36, which gives d≈6.13 mm. But perhaps I should use a more accurate formula.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the rotation is θ = (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d. So θ in radians is (2π (n_e - n_o) d) / λ.

We want θ = π radians (180 degrees), so:

π = (2π (n_e - n_o) d ) / λ

Canceling π from both sides:

1 = (2 (n_e - n_o) d) / λ

Rearranged, d = λ/(2 (n_e - n_o)).

Now, n_e - n_o for quartz at 435.8 nm. Wait, I need to find the birefringence Δn = n_e - n_o at that wavelength.

I know that for quartz, the birefringence at 589 nm is about 0.009 (n_e=1.553, n_o=1.544, difference 0.009). But at 435.8 nm (blue), Δn would be higher because the refractive indices are higher and the birefringence increases with decreasing wavelength.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure of the exact Δn at 435.8 nm. Maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the birefringence at the given wavelength. But without exact data, maybe I should proceed.

Assuming Δn is 0.009, same as at 589 nm, which might not be accurate, but perhaps it's what's expected.

So d = 435.8e-9 m / (2 * 0.009) 

Wait, 435.8e-9 is 4.358e-7 meters.

So denominator is 0.018.

So d = (4.358e-7 m) / 0.018 = (4.358 / 18) * 1e-5 m.

Wait, 4.358 divided by 18 is approximately 0.2421. So 0.2421e-5 m is 0.2421e-3 mm, which is 0.2421 micrometers. That's way too small, but that can't be right because the options are in the mm range.

Wait, I must have messed up the calculation.

Wait, 4.358e-7 m divided by 0.018. Let me compute this step by step.

4.358e-7 / 0.018 = (4.358 / 18) * 1e-5.

Wait, 4.358 divided by 18 is approximately 0.2421. So 0.2421 * 1e-5 meters is 2.421e-6 meters, which is 2.421 micrometers, or 0.002421 mm. That's way too small, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps my initial formula is wrong. Let me try another approach.

Wait, I think I might have confused the formula for rotation. Another formula I remember is θ (in degrees) = (180 * λ) / (π * d * Δn) ). Wait, no, maybe not.

Alternatively, the rotation in radians is θ = (2π/λ) * (n_e - n_o) * d. So for a full 180 degrees (π radians), we have:

π = (2π (n_e - n_o) d) / λ

Cancel π:

1 = (2 (n_e - n_o) d) / λ

Then d = λ / (2 (n_e - n_o)).

Again, same formula as before. So plugging in the numbers, but perhaps I'm using the wrong Δn.

Wait, perhaps at 435.8 nm, n_e - n_o is larger. Let me look up or estimate the birefringence for quartz at 435.8 nm.

I know that for quartz, the ordinary refractive index at 589 nm is about 1.544, and n_e is about 1.553, so Δn = 0.009. At shorter wavelengths, n increases, and Δn might increase as well. For example, at 400 nm, n_o might be around 1.57, and n_e around 1.58, making Δn about 0.01.

But without exact values, it's hard to say. Let's assume that at 435.8 nm, Δn is approximately 0.010.

So then, d = 435.8e-9 / (2 * 0.010) = 435.8e-9 / 0.02.

435.8e-9 is 4.358e-7.

4.358e-7 / 0.02 = (4.358 / 20) * 1e-5 = 0.2179 * 1e-5 m = 2.179e-6 m, which is 0.002179 mm. Still way too small.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. I must be missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotation is given in terms of the specific rotation R, and R is given as 21.7 deg/mm at 589 nm. So using that, and adjusting for wavelength, we can find R.

If R is proportional to 1/λ, then R = 21.7 * (589 / 435.8) ≈ 21.7 * 1.353 ≈ 29.36 deg/mm.

Then, to get 180 degrees rotation, d = 180 / 29.36 ≈ 6.13 mm. Looking at the options, H is 6.25 mm, which is close.

But wait, maybe the dependence isn't exactly 1/λ but something else. Let me think about the formula for specific rotation.

The specific rotation R is given by R = (2π/λ) (n_l - n_r), where n_l and n_r are the refractive indices for left and right circularly polarized light. And for quartz, the difference is small, but R is typically given as a material property.

Wait, but R is often given as R = (α), where α is the rotatory power in degrees per mm, which is (180/π) * (n_l - n_r) * 1e3, because 1 m is 1e3 mm. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the formula for R in degrees per millimeter is R = (180 * π) / (λ) * (n_l - n_r) * 1e3, but I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, using the formula R = (2π (n_l - n_r) ) / λ in radians per meter. Then to get degrees per millimeter, we can convert units.

Let me compute R:

(n_l - n_r) for quartz is about 0.009 (as n_e - n_o). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around, but the magnitude remains the same.

So R in radians per meter is (2π * 0.009) / (435.8e-9 m) ).

Wait, 435.8e-9 m is 435.8 nanometers.

So R = (2π * 0.009) / 435.8e-9.

Wait, 2π * 0.009 = 0.05652 radians per meter.

So R = 0.05652 / 435.8e-9 = 0.05652 / 4.358e-7 ≈ 129,654 radians per meter.

But to convert this to degrees per millimeter, we can do:

1 radian = 180/π degrees ≈ 57.2958 degrees.

1 meter = 1e3 mm.

So R in degrees per mm is (129,654 rad/m) * (57.2958 deg/rad) * (1 m / 1e3 mm) )

So 129,654 * 57.2958 ≈ let's see, 129654 * 57 is about 7,389,  but wait, 129654 * 50 = 6,482,700, 129654 * 7.2958≈ approx 129654 *7= 907,578, and 129654 *0.2958≈38,400. So total approx 6,482,700 + 907,578 +
