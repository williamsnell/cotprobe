Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about the ionization of water and how temperature affects pH and the neutrality of water. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

The question gives me the K_disso for water at two different temperatures. At 25°C, it's 1.0e-14, and at 60°C, it's 9.62e-14. So, the K value increases when the temperature goes up. I remember that K_w is the ion product of water, which is [H3O+][OH-]. At 25°C, pure water has a pH of 7 because the concentrations of H3O+ and OH- are equal, each being 1e-7 M.

Wait, but when temperature increases, K_w increases. That means more H3O+ and OH- ions are produced because the ionization increases. So, for pure water, both [H3O+] and [OH-] would go up. But wait, if both increase equally, then the pH would change because pH is the negative log of [H3O+]. Let me see, at higher temperature, K_w is higher. Let's do a rough calculation.

At 25°C, Kw = 1e-14. So each ion is 1e-7, pH 7. At 60°C, Kw is about 9.6e-14. So the product is higher. Let's calculate the new concentrations. Let’s assume that [H3O+] = [OH-] = x. Then x^2 = 9.6e-14 → x = sqrt(9.6e-14) ≈ 9.8e-7. So pH would be -log(9.8e-7) ≈ around 6. So the pH would drop from 7 to about 6, making it more acidic.

Wait, but wait. So if the pH is lower, that means the water is more acidic than neutral. So then, does the neutrality change? Neutrality in water refers to the pH being 7. If pH is now around 6, then the water is no longer neutral—it's acidic. So the neutrality changes.

But wait, I thought that the neutrality of water is determined by whether [H+] equals [OH-]. Because in pure water, H+ and OH- are equal. So when K_w increases, but as long as [H+] equals [OH-], the solution is neutral. Let me think again.

Wait no, wait a minute. At higher temperature, K_w increases, but in pure water, [H+] equals [OH-], right? Because water autoionizes to produce equal amounts. So if Kw is higher, but [H+] = [OH-], then each would be sqrt(Kw). So in this case, [H+] would increase. So the pH would decrease because pH is -log[H+]. So from 7 to about 6.08 (since sqrt(9.6e-14) is about 9.8e-7, so pH is ~6.01).

So, the pH changes. But what about the neutrality? Neutrality is when pH is 7. If pH is now 6, then the water is no longer neutral; it's acidic. So the neutrality has changed.

Wait, but wait another thought. The question is asking whether the pH or the neutrality of water changes. So, the pH does change. And since the pH is not 7 anymore, the water is not neutral anymore. So both pH and neutrality change.

Wait, but wait another angle. Wait, in pure water, [H+] always equals [OH-], right? Because water autoionizes to make equal amounts. So regardless of temperature, in pure water, [H+] = [OH-], so the solution is neutral? But that can't be right because if K_w is higher, but H+ and OH- are equal, then pH would be less than 7 if K_w is higher than 1e-14. Because pH is 0.5 * log(Kw). Wait, no, pH is -log[H+]. If Kw is 1e-14, [H+] is 1e-7, pH 7. If Kw is higher, [H+] is higher, say 1e-6, pH would be 6, which is more acidic. So the solution would still be neutral in terms of [H+] = [OH-], but the pH is lower than 7, which is acidic. Wait, no, wait, no. If [H+] = [OH-], then the solution is neutral by definition. So the pH would change, but the solution is still neutral. Because neutrality is about the equality of H+ and OH- concentrations.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The pH of pure water at 25°C is 7 because [H+]=[OH-]=1e-7. At higher temperatures, K_w increases. So in pure water, [H+] and [OH-] would both increase, but remain equal. So [H+] = sqrt(Kw). So for Kw=9.6e-14, [H+] is about 9.8e-7, so pH is about 6. So the pH decreases, but the solution is still neutral because [H+] equals [OH-]. Wait, but pH 6 is acidic, which would mean the solution is not neutral. Oh, wait, no. Neutrality is when [H+] = [OH-], which occurs when pH = pOH, and that happens in pure water regardless of temperature. So the pH may change, but the solution remains neutral because [H+] equals [OH-].

Wait, but when Kw increases with temperature, in pure water [H+] increases, so pH decreases. So the water becomes more acidic in terms of pH, but it's still neutral because [H+] = [OH-]. So the pH changes, but the water remains neutral.

So the question is, does the pH of water or its neutrality change when temperature increases.

So the pH changes (it goes down), but the water is still neutral because [H+] = [OH-]. So the pH changes, but the neutrality doesn't change.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Because if pH is 6, the solution is acidic, so it's not neutral. So perhaps when the pH isn't 7, the solution isn't neutral anymore. So maybe my initial thought was wrong.

Wait, what's the correct definition of neutrality? I think a neutral solution is one where [H+] = [OH-], which corresponds to pH=7 at 25°C. But at higher temperatures, pH of pure water decreases, which would mean that [H+] > [OH-], making the solution acidic. But wait, no, because in pure water, [H+] = [OH-] no matter the temperature. So the solution remains neutral, but the pH changes because the concentration of H+ increases.

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify.

At 25°C, pure water has pH 7 because [H+]=1e-7.

At higher temp, K_w increases. So [H+] increases, but in pure water, [H+] must equal [OH-]. So, for example, if K_w is 1e-14, [H+] is 1e-7, pH 7. If K_w is 9.6e-14, then [H+] is sqrt(9.6e-14) ≈ 9.8e-7, so pH is about 6. So pH decreases, but [H+] = [OH-], so it's still a neutral solution. Wait, but that can't be because if [H+] is higher than 1e-7, say 1e-6, then the solution would be acidic, right?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in pure water, [H+] equals [OH-] regardless of the temperature. So, when K_w increases, both [H+] and [OH-] increase by the same amount. So, for example, at 60°C, [H+] = [OH-] = sqrt(9.6e-14) ≈ 9.8e-7. So the pH is about 6.01, but the solution is still neutral because [H+] equals [OH-].

Wait, but wait, pH 6 is acidic, which would mean the solution is not neutral. So now I'm really confused.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concept of neutral pH (which is 7 at 25°C) with the actual [H+] and [OH-] concentrations. The neutral point is where [H+] = [OH-]. So, the pH of a neutral solution is equal to the pKw/2. At 25°C, pKw is 14, so pH is 7. At 60°C, pKw is lower (since Kw is 9.6e-14, so pKw≈13.02). So, the pH of neutral water at 60°C would be 13.02/2 ≈6.51.

Wait, that's a different approach. So, the pH of neutral water (where [H+] = [OH-]) is dependent on temperature. So as temperature increases, the pH of neutral water decreases. So, at higher temperatures, pure water has a lower pH but is still neutral because [H+] = [OH-]. So, the pH changes, but the solution remains neutral.

Wait, but that would mean that the pH of water changes, but the water remains neutral. So in the context of the question, when temperature increases, the pH of water changes (decreases), but its neutrality (i.e., [H+] = [OH-]) remains the same. So the pH changes, but the neutrality doesn't change.

So, looking at the options:

The question is whether the pH of water or its neutrality changes when temperature increases.

Option C: pH decreases slightly, while neutrality remains the same. That fits because pH goes from 7 to ~6, and [H+] still equals [OH-].

Wait, but the question is, does the pH change? Yes. Does the neutrality change? No, because [H+] = [OH-].

Wait, but does the pH of water change? Yes. Because the pH is lower. So the pH changes, and the neutrality remains the same.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: pH decreases slightly, neutrality same. So option C is correct.

But wait, let me read the options again.

Options:

A: Neutrality changes, water more basic, pH same. No.

B: Only pH changes, value increases. No, pH decreases.

C: pH decreases slightly, neutrality same. Yes.

D: Neither changes. No.

E: pH doesn't change, neutrality does. No.

F: Only neutrality changes, becomes more acidic. No, pH changes.

G: pH changes, neutrality same. Yes, same as C.

Wait, option G says "pH changes, neutrality doesn't". Option C says pH decreases, neutrality same.

Wait, the question is whether the pH changes or the neutrality changes.

So in the scenario, pH does change (it goes down), but the water remains neutral (because [H+] = [OH-]).

So which option says that? Let's see the options.

Option C: pH decreases, neutrality same.

Option G: pH changes, neutrality same.

Wait, both C and G seem correct. But let me check the exact wording.

The question is: Does the pH of water or its neutrality change when the temperature increases?

So, the pH of water does change (from 7 to ~6), and its neutrality (i.e., whether it's neutral or not) does not change.

So the correct answer is that the pH changes, but the water remains neutral. So the option that says pH changes but neutrality does not is option G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't.

Wait, option C says pH decreases and neutrality same. Option G is more general, just stating pH changes and neutrality doesn't.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: pH decreases slightly, while neutrality remains the same.

Option G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't.

So both are correct, but which is more accurate?

Wait, the pH does decrease, so option C is correct in that aspect. Option G is correct but less specific.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The change in K_w implies that pH changes, but the water remains neutral because [H+] = [OH-].

So, the correct answer is that the pH changes, but the water remains neutral.

Looking back at the options, option G says "pH changes, neutrality doesn't." So that's correct.

Alternatively, option C is also correct because it says pH decreases (which is a change) and neutrality remains same.

Wait, but the question is whether the pH or the neutrality changes. So, the pH does change, so the correct answer is that the pH changes but the water remains neutral.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer should be option C or G.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: pH decreases slightly, while neutrality remains the same.

Option G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't.

So both are correct, but which one is more appropriate.

The actual pH does decrease, so option C is more precise. But the question is more about whether pH changes (yes) and whether neutrality changes (no).

So the correct answer is that the pH changes and the water remains neutral. So option G would be correct if it's phrased as pH changes (without specifying direction), but the actual pH does decrease.

Wait, but the options are:

C: pH decreases slightly, while neutrality remains the same.

G: pH changes, neutrality doesn't.

So both are correct, but the best choice is C because it correctly describes the pH change.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought that the pH changes, but the water remains neutral. So the correct answer should be that the pH changes, but the water remains neutral.

Looking at the options, option C and G both fit. But let me think again.

The correct answer is that the pH of water changes (it becomes lower) and the water remains neutral because [H+] = [OH-]. So, the correct option is C: pH decreases slightly, while neutrality remains the same.

Wait, but another approach: the question is whether the pH changes or the neutrality changes.

So pH does change (so option D is wrong because it says neither changes). Neutrality doesn't change because [H+] and [OH-] remain equal.

So the correct answer is option C or G.

Wait, perhaps I should check which option is correct.

Wait, the initial K_w at 25°C is 1e-14, pH 7. At 60°C, K_w=9.6e-14, so [H+]=sqrt(9.6e-14)=approx 9.8e-7, so pH ~6.01. So the pH decreases, and the solution remains neutral.

So the pH changes (decreases), and the solution remains neutral. So the correct answer is option C: pH decreases slightly, while neutrality remains the same.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is option C.
</think>

The ionization constant of water, \( K_w \), increases with temperature, meaning that at higher temperatures, more \( \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) ions are produced. At 25°C, \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \), resulting in a pH of 7, where \( [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = [\text{OH}^-] = 1.0 \times 10^{-7} \). At 60°C, \( K_w = 9.62 \times 10^{-14} \), so \( [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{9.62 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 9.8 \times 10^{-7} \), and the pH decreases to approximately 6.01.

Although the pH decreases, the water remains neutral because \( [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = [\text{OH}^-] \), which is the defining characteristic of a neutral solution. Therefore, the pH changes (it decreases), but the water's neutrality does not change.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Neutrality does not change, and the water does not become more basic.
- **B**: Incorrect. The pH decreases, not increases.
- **C**: Correct. The pH decreases slightly, and neutrality remains the same.
- **D**: Incorrect. The pH changes, so neither pH nor neutrality remain constant.
- **E**: Incorrect. The pH changes, and neutrality does not change.
- **F**: Incorrect. Neutrality does not change, and the water does not become more acidic.
- **G**: Correct in stating that the pH changes and neutrality does not, but less specific than **C**.
- **H**: Incorrect. Both pH and neutrality do not change; the water remains neutral.
- **I**: Incorrect. Neutrality does not change.
- **J**: Incorrect. The pH changes, so it cannot remain constant.

The most precise and accurate answer is **C**, as it correctly describes both the decrease in pH and the unchanged neutrality of the water.
