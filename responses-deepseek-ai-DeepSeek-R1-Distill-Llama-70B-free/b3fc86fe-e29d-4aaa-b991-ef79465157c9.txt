Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Doppler effect, I think. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about an airplane flying at Mach 0.5 with a sound source emitting a 1000 Hz signal. A listener is in the path, and we need to find out what frequency they hear after the airplane has passed. 

Hmm, right, the Doppler effect is when the observed frequency changes because the source is moving relative to the observer. I remember that when the source is moving towards the observer, the frequency increases, and when it's moving away, the frequency decreases. But wait, there's a catch here because the problem mentions the airplane is flying at Mach 0.5. Oh right, Mach 0.5 means it's moving at half the speed of sound. So, I need to account for that in the Doppler formula.

Wait, what's the Doppler effect formula again? I think it's f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs), where f' is the observed frequency, f is the source frequency, v is the speed of sound, vo is the observer's speed, and vs is the source's speed. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I might have that backwards. Oh yeah, when the source is moving towards the observer, vs is subtracted from v in the denominator. So if the source is moving away, vs would be added? No, wait, the formula depends on the direction. Let me think again.

Okay, I think the standard Doppler shift formula when the source is moving and the observer is stationary is f' = (v) / (v - vs) * f. But wait, if the source is moving towards the observer, vs is in the same direction as the sound, so the denominator becomes v - vs because the source is moving towards, making the wavelength shorter. Wait, no, if the source is moving towards, the waves get compressed, so the denominator is v - vs. Right, because when the source moves towards, each wavefront is emitted closer, so the observed frequency increases.

But wait, in this problem, the source is moving away from the observer after passing. Because the question says the listener is in the path and after the airplane has passed. So the airplane is moving away now. So the source is moving away, so we should use the moving away version of the formula.

So the formula for when the source is moving away is f' = f * (v) / (v + vs). Because when moving away, the denominator becomes v + vs. Oh wait, no. Wait, the general Doppler shift formula when the source is moving is f' = (v + vo)/(v - vs) * f. But in our case, the observer is stationary, so vo is zero. So it's f' = (v) / (v - vs_sign) * f. Wait, no, the signs depend on the direction. Let me get this straight.

I think the correct formula when the source is moving away is f' = f * (v) / (v + vs). Because when the source moves away, the observed frequency decreases. So in this case, the source is moving at Mach 0.5, which is half the speed of sound. Let me make sure about the units. The speed of sound, let's say it's v = 343 m/s at sea level, but since Mach 0.5 is half that, vs = 0.5 * 343 ≈ 171.5 m/s.

Wait, but the actual value of v might not be necessary here because it will cancel out in the ratio. Because Mach 0.5 is vs = 0.5v. So substituting that into the formula would make it easier.

So f' = f * (v) / (v + vs) → since vs = 0.5 v,

f' = 1000 Hz * v / (v + 0.5v) = 1000 Hz * v/(1.5v) ) → the v's cancel, so f' = 1000 / 1.5 = 666.666... Hz. Hmm, that's approximately 667 Hz. Looking at the options, option E is 667 Hz, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Was the source moving towards or away? Because the scenario is that the listener is in the path after the airplane has passed. So the airplane is moving away from the listener. Because when the plane was approaching, it hadn't passed yet. After passing, it's moving away. So yes, the source is moving away, so the formula applies with vs in the denominator as addition. So yes, 667 Hz, which is option E.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be E.

To solve the problem, we use the Doppler effect formula for a moving source and a stationary observer:

\[
f' = f \cdot \frac{v}{v + v_s}
\]

Here:
- \( f' \) is the observed frequency,
- \( f \) is the source frequency (\( 1000 \, \text{Hz} \)),
- \( v \) is the speed of sound,
- \( v_s \) is the speed of the source.

The airplane is flying at Mach 0.5, meaning \( v_s = 0.5v \). Substituting \( v_s = 0.5v \) into the formula:

\[
f' = 1000 \cdot \frac{v}{v + 0.5v} = 1000 \cdot \frac{v}{1.5v} = 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{1.5} = 1000 \cdot 0.666\ldots \approx 667 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Thus, the observed frequency is approximately \( 667 \, \text{Hz} \). Since the airplane has passed the listener, it is moving away, and the frequency decreases, confirming the use of the correct formula.

The correct answer is:

**E: 667-Hz sound**
