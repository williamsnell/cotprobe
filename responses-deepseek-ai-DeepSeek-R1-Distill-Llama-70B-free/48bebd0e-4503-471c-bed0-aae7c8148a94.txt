Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about some volunteers selling T-shirts at a charity concert. They made a total of $5,144, and each T-shirt was sold for $8. I need to find out how many T-shirts they sold. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Alright, so first, I think I should understand what's being asked. They want the total number of T-shirts sold. I know that when you have the total amount of money made and the price per item, the number of items sold is total divided by price per item. So the formula should be Number of T-shirts = Total money / Price per T-shirt.

Let me write that down to visualize it better. So, Number = 5144 / 8. Hmm, I need to do this division. Wait, 5144 divided by 8. I'm a bit rusty on my division, but let's try to break it down.

Maybe I'll start by seeing how many times 8 goes into 51. Because 8 times 6 is 48, which is close to 51. So that's 6, and the remainder is 3. Then bring down the 4, making it 34. 8 goes into 34 four times (8*4=32), leaving a remainder of 2. Bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 24. 8 goes into 24 exactly 3 times. So putting it together, that's 6 (from 51), then 4 (from 34), then 3 (from 24). So 643.

Wait, but let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 8 times 643 equals 5,144? Let's see. 8*600 is 4,800. 8*40 is 320. 8*3 is 24. Adding those together: 4,800 + 320 is 5,120, plus 24 makes 5,144. Yep, that checks out.

So the number of T-shirts sold is 643. Now I look at the options. Let me see the options again: A is 650, B is 700, C is 680, D is 655, E is 620, F is 643, G is 675, H is 632, I is 660, J is 668. So F is 643, which matches my calculation.

I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try another method. Sometimes, when I'm doing division, I might use the method of breaking down the numbers. Let's see, 5,144 divided by 8.

Alternatively, I can think of how much 8 times 600 is, which is 4,800. Subtracting that from 5,144 gives 344. Now, 8 times 40 is 320, so that's 40 more, bringing us to 8*640=5,120. Subtracting that from 5,144 leaves 24. 8*3 is 24. So that's 3 more, totaling 643. Yep, same result.

Another way could be using multiplication tables. I know that 8 times 600 is 4,800, as before. Then 5,144 minus 4,800 is 344. Now, 8 times 40 is 320, so adding 40 to 600 makes 640, and 344 minus 320 is 24. 8 times 3 is 24, so adding 3 makes 643. Yep, same as before.

I think I'm confident that 643 is the right answer, which is option F.

The problem requires calculating the number of T-shirts sold by dividing the total money raised ($5,144) by the price per T-shirt ($8). Using division, we find that 5,144 รท 8 equals 643. This matches option F, which is 643.
