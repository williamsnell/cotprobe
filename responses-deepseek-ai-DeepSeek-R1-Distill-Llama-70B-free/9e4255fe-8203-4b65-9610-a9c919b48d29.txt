Question:

A laboratory manufactures nitroglycerin (a heavy, oily, explosive, poisonous liquid used chiefly in making dynamite) at its main plant. An artist who specialized in making delicate glass sculptures had a studio two blocks away from the laboratory's plant. Late one evening, there was an explosion at the laboratory's plant. The force of the explosion caused the artist's studio to be shaken, which resulted in the destruction of valuable artwork in the studio. The artist now asserts a tort action against the laboratory to recover damages. Which of the following, if established, would furnish the laboratory with its best possible defense?

Options:

A: The laboratory had previously survived similar incidents without any damage to surrounding properties.
B: The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.
C: The artist did not have appropriate safety measures in place to protect their artwork.
D: The laboratory had all necessary permits and licenses to manufacture nitroglycerin.
E: The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.
F: The artist had previously accepted compensation for potential risks due to their proximity to the laboratory.
G: The artist had been warned about potential risks due to their proximity to the laboratory.
H: The laboratory was not aware of the artist's studio being in close proximity to their plant.
I: The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.

Okay, so I've got this tort question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about a laboratory that manufactures nitroglycerin, which is a heavy, oily, explosive, and poisonous liquid. They had an explosion, and it caused damage to an artist's studio two blocks away. The artist is suing the lab for damages.

The question is asking which defense would be the laboratory's best if established. The options are A through I. I need to think about the possible defenses in tort law, especially negligence and strict liability.

First, I remember that in tort cases, especially when dealing with abnormally dangerous activities, the concept of strict liability often comes into play. The Restatement (Second) of Torts ยง520 outlines factors that determine if an activity is abnormally dangerous, such as the risk of serious harm, likelihood of injury, inability to eliminate the risk with care, and whether the activity is a common one in that area.

Nitroglycerin is definitely an abnormally dangerous substance. So, if the lab was manufacturing it, they might be strictly liable for any resulting damages, even if they weren't negligent. But wait, maybe there's another angle.

Looking at the options, option B says the lab used extraordinary care and wasn't negligent. But if strict liability applies, negligence doesn't matter. However, if the activity isn't considered abnormally dangerous, then negligence would be the standard. So maybe the lab is arguing that they weren't negligent, which would be a defense if the case is based on negligence.

Option E says the harm wouldn't have happened but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work. That sounds like the "thin skull" plaintiff doctrine, which usually doesn't cap liability because defendants take the plaintiff as they find them. So the plaintiff's susceptibility doesn't limit liability, so E might not be a good defense.

Option A says the lab had survived similar incidents without damage. That's about past experience, but that doesn't necessarily negate liability. It just shows maybe they were lucky before.

Option C: Artist's lack of safety measures. That's about contributory negligence or assumption of risk. If the artist didn't take precautions, maybe that reduces their recovery, but in strict liability cases, contributory negligence isn't a defense. So it might not help the lab much.

Option D: They had all permits. Having permits doesn't necessarily mean they're not liable. It just means they were legally allowed to operate, but if an abnormally dangerous activity occurs, permits don't shield them.

Options F and G: F says the artist accepted compensation for risks. That sounds like a contract where the artist might have waived liability, but I'm not sure. G says the artist was warned. If the artist was warned, maybe that's assumption of risk, but again, in strict liability, that's not a defense.

Option H: Lab didn't know about the studio. If they should have known, then maybe it's about foreseeability. But if the activity is abnormally dangerous, the duty is high regardless of knowledge of surrounding areas.

Option I: Contract with federal government. I don't think that would shield them from liability to third parties. Sovereign immunity might apply to the government, but the lab is a separate entity.

Wait, but going back, the question is about the best possible defense. If the lab can show that they weren't negligent, does that matter? If the activity is abnormally dangerous, strict liability applies regardless of negligence. So even if they were careful, if the activity is ultra-hazardous, they could still be liable.

But maybe the lab can argue that the activity isn't abnormally dangerous, making negligence the standard. If they can show that they weren't negligent (option B), then they aren't liable.

Alternatively, if the activity is abnormally dangerous, strict liability applies, so negligence isn't a defense. So in that case, the lab can't use B as a defense. So maybe the best defense is something else.

Wait, perhaps the best defense would be causation. But the question says the explosion caused the destruction. So that's established.

Alternatively, another approach is the type of tort. If the lab is strictly liable, then their best defense would be something that negates strict liability. For strict liability, the plaintiff must show that the activity was abnormally dangerous, and that it was the cause. So if the lab can show that their activity isn't abnormally dangerous, then they can avoid strict liability and the case would be based on negligence.

But the question is, which option would provide the best defense. Let's think about each option again.

Option B: If the lab used extraordinary care and wasn't negligent, then if the case is based on negligence, they have a good defense. But if it's strict liability, their care doesn't matter.

So the lab's best defense would be to argue that their activity isn't abnormally dangerous, making negligence the standard. But the question is about which option, if established, would help.

Alternatively, another possible defense is assumption of risk. If the artist knew of the risks and chose to be there anyway, but in strict liability, assumption of risk is not a defense. So that might not help.

Wait, another thought: The doctrine of "coming to a nuisance." If the artist moved into the area knowing about the lab, but I don't think that's a solid defense. It's more for nuisance cases and not applicable in all situations.

Alternatively, if the lab can show that the artist's damage was due to the artist's own negligence, like not securing the artwork, but again, that's contributory negligence, which in strict liability isn't a defense.

So going back, the key is whether the lab's activity is considered abnormally dangerous. If it is, they're strictly liable. So their best defense would be to show that their activity isn't abnormally dangerous, but none of the options directly say that.

Looking at the options again, option B is about them not being negligent. So if the court decides that the activity isn't abnormally dangerous, then they can use B as a defense. But if it's abnormally dangerous, B doesn't help.

But the question is about the best possible defense. So perhaps the lab's best bet is to show that they weren't negligent, which would work if the activity isn't considered abnormally dangerous.

Alternatively, another angle: if the explosion was an act of God or an unavoidable accident, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another thought: assumption of risk. If the artist knew about the risks, but that's covered in option G. But in strict liability, that's not a defense.

So, if the lab can get the case to be about negligence, then option B would be their best defense. So the question is, which option would let them avoid strict liability.

Alternatively, if the activity is not abnormally dangerous, then strict liability doesn't apply, and they can defend against negligence.

But the question states that the lab manufactures nitroglycerin, which is a classic example of an abnormally dangerous activity. So the court would likely find strict liability applies.

If that's the case, then the lab's only defense would be to show that the activity wasn't the cause, but the question says the explosion caused the damage.

Alternatively, perhaps the artist's loss isn't the type that's recoverable, but that's not an option.

Wait, another point: the best defense would be that the activity wasn't abnormally dangerous, which would shift to negligence. But none of the options directly state that. So the lab might argue that they used extraordinary care (option B), which would be a defense if the case is based on negligence, but not if it's strict liability.

But given that nitroglycerin is abnormally dangerous, strict liability applies. So if the lab can't avoid strict liability, then their best defense would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Let me think again. Option E says the harm wouldn't have happened but for the abnormal fragility. So, the artwork was unusually fragile. Normally, the defendant must take the plaintiff as they find them, but in cases of abnormally sensitive plaintiffs, sometimes damages are limited.

Wait, the thin skull doctrine is that you take the plaintiff as you find them, so the defendant is liable for the full extent of the injuries, even if they're unusually severe because of the plaintiff's pre-existing condition. So, the fact that the artwork was abnormally fragile wouldn't limit liability. So option E is not a good defense.

Hmm, so maybe the best defense is option B. But wait, strict liability doesn't require negligence, so option B wouldn't help.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the lab can argue that the artist's use of the studio was an abnormal use, making strict liability inapplicable. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I thought that's not a valid defense. Or maybe it's B, but that's only good if strict liability isn't applied.

Wait, maybe the lab can argue that the activity wasn't abnormally dangerous. But none of the options say that. So the next best is to show that they weren't negligent, which would help if the activity isn't abnormally dangerous.

But since nitroglycerin is a classic example, the court would likely apply strict liability. So the lab's best defense would be something else.

Alternatively, the defense could be that the artist's damages are too remote, but that's not an option here.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because if the artwork was abnormally fragile, maybe the harm was unforeseeable, breaking the chain of causation. But I'm not sure. Let's think about causation.

In tort, both actual and proximate cause are required. Proximate cause is about foreseeability. If the defendant couldn't have reasonably foreseen that their action would cause that type of harm, then proximate cause is lacking.

But in this case, an explosion causing damage to nearby buildings seems foreseeable. The artwork being fragile might affect the extent of damages, but not whether it was foreseeable that some damage would occur.

So, perhaps option E isn't a strong defense because the type of harm (damage to property) is foreseeable, even if the extent (due to fragility) is not.

Wait, but the question is about the best possible defense. So if the lab can show that the artist's loss was due to the artwork's abnormal fragility, maybe that breaks causation. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach: the laboratory might argue that the artist's studio was too close, but that's not an option.

Wait, let me think of the possible defenses again. In strict liability, the main defenses are:

1. Assumption of risk (but as I said, not applicable)
2. Contributory negligence (also not a defense in strict liability)
3. That the risk wasn't abnormally dangerous (so not strict liability)
4. Act of God or unavoidable accident.

But none of the options directly address these.

So, if the lab can prove that their activity isn't abnormally dangerous, then they can use negligence as a defense. But without that option, the next best is to show that they were not negligent, which would be a good defense if the activity isn't abnormally dangerous.

So, in that case, option B would be the best defense.

Alternatively, if the activity is abnormally dangerous, then strict liability applies, and B doesn't matter. But the question is about the best possible defense if established.

So, the best possible defense would be showing that the activity isn't abnormally dangerous, but that's not an option. So the next best is to show that they were not negligent, which would work if the activity isn't considered abnormally dangerous.

But given that nitroglycerin is a classic example of an abnormally dangerous activity, the court would likely apply strict liability, making option B irrelevant. So, what other options are there?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Because if the lab can show that they were not negligent, then in a negligence case, they aren't liable. But in a strict liability case, it doesn't matter. So if the activity is not considered abnormally dangerous, then B is a good defense.

But without knowing whether the court considers it abnormally dangerous, the question is which option, if established, would be the best defense. So if the lab can establish that they weren't negligent, that would be a good defense if the activity isn't abnormally dangerous.

But since nitroglycerin is definitely abnormally dangerous, perhaps the lab can't avoid strict liability, making B not a good defense.

Wait, but the question is about the best possible defense. So if the lab can get the court to not apply strict liability, then B would be their defense. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, another thought: the laboratory could argue that the explosion was an accident that couldn't have been foreseen, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, because the artist's work was abnormally fragile, making the harm not foreseeable in terms of extent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E because it's the only option that addresses proximate cause. So, the lab could argue that the artist's damages are too remote because the artwork was unusually fragile.

But I'm a bit shaky on this. I think I'm going back and forth between B and E.

Wait, in the case of Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co., the court held that while the cement plant created a nuisance, damages were limited because the cost of shutting down was too high. But that's more about injunctions, not about liability.

In this case, the lab is manufacturing nitroglycerin, which is ultra-hazardous. So strict liability applies. Therefore, the lab's best defense would be to show that the activity wasn't the cause, but the question says it was.

Alternatively, the lab could argue that the artist's loss was due to their own negligence, but that's not a defense in strict liability.

So, unless there's a way to avoid strict liability, the lab would be liable. But if the lab can avoid strict liability by showing that the activity isn't abnormally dangerous, then they can use B.

But given that nitroglycerin is abnormally dangerous, I think the lab can't avoid strict liability. So their best defense would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because if the harm wouldn't have happened but for the abnormal fragility, then the lab's liability is limited. But in strict liability, the plaintiff's sensitivity doesn't matter. So the lab would still be liable for all damages, regardless of the fragility.

So E doesn't help.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B, but only if the activity isn't considered abnormally dangerous. But since nitroglycerin is, that's not the case. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the answer is E because it's about proximate cause. If the plaintiff's loss was due to an unforeseeable sensitivity, then the defendant isn't liable for that specific loss. But in this case, the explosion causing property damage is foreseeable. The fact that the artwork was fragile might make the extent of the loss higher, but the type of loss (property damage) is still foreseeable.

So the lab can't use E as a defense.

Therefore, perhaps the best answer is B: they used extraordinary care and weren't negligent. But in strict liability, that doesn't matter. So maybe the lab's best defense is to argue that they weren't negligent, hoping that the activity isn't classified as abnormally dangerous.

But I'm not confident. Maybe I should look up similar questions.

Wait, I recall that in cases involving abnormally dangerous activities, a plaintiff can sue under strict liability. So the lab would be liable regardless of negligence. Therefore, the lab's best defense would be to show that the activity isn't abnormally dangerous, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if they can show that the artist's damage wasn't a direct result, but the question says it was.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B because even if strict liability applies, some jurisdictions might allow a defense of due care. Wait, no, strict liability doesn't require negligence; it's liability without fault.

So, I'm starting to think that the correct answer might be E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B, but I'm conflicted.

Another approach: the options. Let's look at each:

A: Previous incidents without damage. Irrelevant.

B: Not negligent. If strict liability applies, not helpful. But if activity isn't abnormally dangerous, then it's a good defense.

C: Artist's lack of safety. Contributory negligence, not a defense in strict liability.

D: Permits. Not a defense.

E: Abnormal fragility. Thin skull, not a defense.

F: Artist accepted compensation. Maybe a contract defense, but not sure.

G: Artist was warned. Assumption of risk, not a defense in strict liability.

H: Lab didn't know about studio. Not relevant to strict liability.

I: Contract with government. Doesn't affect liability to third parties.

So, the remaining options are B and E. If the lab can show B, and the court decides the activity isn't abnormally dangerous, then B is a good defense. But if the activity is abnormally dangerous, then B doesn't help.

But given that nitroglycerin is a classic example, the court would apply strict liability, making B not helpful. So the lab's best defense would be something else.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, but I thought that's not a defense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause. If the artist's work was so fragile that it would have broken even with a minor shock, maybe the explosion was a superseding cause. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the lab might argue that the artist's studio was in an area where such activities are common, making the risk foreseeable, but that's not an option.

I think I'm going in circles. Given the options, the best possible defense is B: the lab used extraordinary care and wasn't negligent. Because if the activity isn't abnormally dangerous, then they can avoid liability, and B would be their defense. But if it is, then they're liable regardless.

But since the question is about the best possible defense if established, B is the best option because it could negate negligence, which is a necessary element if the activity isn't abnormally dangerous.

So I think the answer is B.

The question revolves around a tort action where an artist is suing a laboratory for damages caused by an explosion at the lab, which destroyed valuable artwork in the artist's studio. The laboratory manufactures nitroglycerin, a substance classified as abnormally dangerous. The issue is determining the laboratory's best possible defense if established.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: The laboratory had previously survived similar incidents without damage to surrounding properties.  
   - This is irrelevant because past incidents do not negate liability for the current explosion.

2. **Option B**: The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence causally connected with the explosion.  
   - Strict liability applies to abnormally dangerous activities, regardless of negligence. However, if the activity is not classified as abnormally dangerous, negligence becomes the standard, and this option would serve as a
