Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mode of this list of numbers: 22, 25, 14, 11, 23, 27, 46. Hmm, mode is the number that appears most frequently, right? Let me think about each number and how many times they occur.

Looking at the list, I'll go through each number one by one. Starting with 22, I see it's there once. Then 25, also once. 14 appears once too. 11 is once as well. Next is 23, which is only there once. 27 appears once. And finally, 46 is once. Wait, so each number in the list only occurs once?

So if every number appears the same number of times, which is once, then there's no mode because the mode is the most frequent number. But when all are equally frequent, there's no mode. That means the answer should be 'No mode'.

Looking at the options, option B is 'No mode', so that should be the correct choice.

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a dataset. In the list 22, 25, 14, 11, 23, 27, 46, each number occurs exactly once. Since there is no number that appears more than others, there is no mode.

Answer: B
