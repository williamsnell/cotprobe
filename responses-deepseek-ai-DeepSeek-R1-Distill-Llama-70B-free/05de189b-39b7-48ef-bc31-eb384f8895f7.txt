Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, Mr. Charles has two things he wants to insure: a brick building and some stock. The building is worth $35,000, and the stock is $9,500. He wants to insure each at 4/5 of their value. Hmm, so first I need to find out what 4/5 of each value is.

Let me start with the building. 4/5 of $35,000. So I can calculate that by multiplying 35000 by 0.8. Let me do that: 35,000 * 0.8 equals... well, 35,000 times 0.8 is 28,000. So the insured value for the building is $28,000.

Now for the stock. It's worth $9,500. 4/5 of that would be 9,500 * 0.8. Let me compute that. 9,500 times 0.8 is 7,600. So the insured value for the stock is $7,600.

Next, I need to find the insurance cost for each. The insurance rates are different for each. The building's rate is $0.23 per $100, and the stock's rate is $0.21 per $100. 

Starting with the building. The insured amount is $28,000. So for every $100, the cost is $0.23. To find the total cost, I can take 28,000 divided by 100 to get the number of hundreds, then multiply by 0.23.

28,000 / 100 is 280. 280 times 0.23... Let me calculate that. 280 * 0.2 is 56, and 280 * 0.03 is 8.4. Adding those together gives 56 + 8.4 = 64.4. So the insurance cost for the building is $64.40.

Now for the stock. The insured value is $7,600. Using the same method: 7,600 / 100 is 76. Then multiply by the rate, which is 0.21. So 76 * 0.21 equals... Let me see, 70 * 0.21 is 14.7, and 6 * 0.21 is 1.26. Adding them gives 14.7 + 1.26 = 15.96. So the insurance cost for the stock is $15.96.

Now I need to add both costs together to get the total coverage cost. So $64.40 plus $15.96. Let me add them. 64 + 15 is 79, and 0.40 + 0.96 is 1.36. So 79 + 1.36 is 80.36. So about $80.36 per year.

Looking at the options, option F is $80 per year. So that's the closest one. So the answer should be F.

The cost of Mr. Charles's insurance coverage is calculated by determining 4/5 of the value of each item and then applying the respective insurance rates. 

1. **Building Insurance:**
   - Value: $35,000
   - Insured Value: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 35,000 = 28,000 \)
   - Rate: $0.23 per $100
   - Cost: \( \frac{28,000}{100} \times 0.23 = 64.40 \)

2. **Stock Insurance:**
   - Value: $9,500
   - Insured Value: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 9,500 = 7,600 \)
   - Rate: $0.21 per $100
   - Cost: \( \frac{7,600}{100} \times 0.21 = 15.96 \)

3. **Total Cost:**
   - \( 64.40 + 15.96 = 80.36 \)

The closest option to $80.36 is **$80 per year**.
