Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mrs. Reeves and a note she accepted. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my finance calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says she accepted a note for $815.50 at 6% with a four-month term on December 10. Then, on January 10, she had it discounted at 6 and a half percent. Oh, and there's a 1/8 percent charge for collection when due. I need to figure out how much she received.

Wait, so the note has a face value of $815.50, right? The term is four months, which I think is the time until it's due. So from December 10 to April 10, that's four months. But she's discounting it on January 10, which is one month later. So the time she held it was one month, and the remaining time would be three months until it's due.

Discounting a note means she's getting the present value now instead of waiting until it's due. The discount rate here is 6.5%, which I think is the rate applied to calculate the discount. But wait, I remember that the formula for the discount is based on the face value, the rate, and the time remaining until maturity.

Wait, the formula for the present value when discounting a note is: PV = FV / (1 + (r * t)). But wait, is that correct? Or is it using simple interest? Because sometimes in these cases, especially with short terms like months, simple interest is used.

Oh right, for discounting, the calculation is usually based on simple interest. So the discount is FV * r * t, and the proceeds are FV minus the discount. Also, there's that collection fee when it's due, which is 1/8 percent of the face value. So I think I need to factor that in as well.

Wait, but when she discounts the note, does the collection fee apply now or when it's due? The problem says a (1/8)% charge for collection when due was also made. So I think that fee is deducted when the note is discounted. So she gets the present value minus the collection fee.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. Let's list the given data:

Face value (FV) = $815.50

Original interest rate: 6% per annum, but that's probably not directly needed here because she's discounting it at a different rate.

Discounting rate: 6.5% per annum.

Time from January 10 to April 10 is three months. Because the term was four months from December 10, so January 10 is one month in.

So the remaining time is 3 months. Since it's in years, 3/12 = 0.25 years.

The discount is calculated on the face value using the discount rate and the time remaining.

So discount = FV * (discount rate) * time.

That would be 815.50 * 0.065 * (3/12). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 3/12 is 0.25, so 0.065 * 0.25 = 0.01625.

Then 815.50 * 0.01625. Let me compute that.

815.50 * 0.01625 = ? Let's see, 800 * 0.01625 is 13, and 15.50 * 0.01625 is about 0.251875. So total around 13.251875. So approximately $13.25.

So the discount is about $13.25. So the present value without the collection fee would be FV - discount = 815.50 - 13.25 = $802.25.

Wait, no, wait. I think I got that wrong. Because when you discount a note, the present value is FV minus the discount. So yes, that's correct.

But then there's the collection fee, which is (1/8)% of the face value. So (1/8)% is 0.125%. So 815.50 * 0.00125.

Let me compute that. 815.50 * 0.00125. Well, 800 * 0.00125 is 1, and 15.50 * 0.00125 is about 0.019375. So total is approximately $1.019375, which is about $1.02.

Wait, but is the collection fee applied before or after discounting? The problem says it was also made when she had it discounted. So I think it's a fee she pays when she discounts the note. So she receives the present value minus the collection fee.

So putting it all together:

Proceeds = (FV - discount) - collection fee.

So $815.50 - $13.25 = $802.25, then subtract $1.02, so $801.23. But wait, looking at the options, that's not matching any. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let's recalculate the discount.

FV = $815.50

Discount rate: 6.5% per annum, for 3 months.

Time in years: 3/12 = 0.25.

So discount = 815.50 * 0.065 * 0.25.

Compute 0.065 * 0.25 first: 0.01625.

815.50 * 0.01625: Let's compute this more accurately.

815.50 * 0.01625.

I can think of 0.01625 as 1625/100000, but perhaps breaking it down:

0.01625 = 1/64. So 815.50 / 64.

Wait, 64 times 12 is 768, 64 * 12.7 is 64*12=768, 64*0.7=44.8 → 812.8. Hmm, close to 815.50.

Alternatively, perhaps compute 815.50 * 0.01625.

Let me compute 815.50 × 0.01625.

First, 800 × 0.01625 = 13.

15.50 × 0.01625: Let's compute 15 × 0.01625 = 0.24375, and 0.50 × 0.01625 = 0.008125. So total 0.251875.

So total discount is 13 + 0.251875 = $13.251875, which is approximately $13.2519.

So the present value is 815.50 - 13.2519 = $802.2481.

Then subtract the collection fee, which is 1/8% of 815.50.

1/8% is 0.125%, so 815.50 * 0.00125 = ?

Let me compute 815.50 × 0.00125.

Well, 800 × 0.00125 = 1.00.

15.50 × 0.00125: 15 × 0.00125 = 0.01875, 0.50 × 0.00125 = 0.000625. So total 0.019375.

So total collection fee is 1.00 + 0.019375 = $1.019375, approximately $1.02.

So subtracting that from the present value: 802.2481 - 1.019375 = approximately $801.2287, so about $801.23.

But looking at the options, the closest I see is option I: $800.00, but that's not matching. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied to the face value before discounting? Or perhaps I should compute the present value first, then subtract the fee.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the collection fee is a flat fee regardless of when it's discounted. Or perhaps the fee is subtracted from the proceeds after discounting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Proceeds = (FV * (1 - r_discount * t)) - (FV * collection_fee_rate)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently.

Another way is to compute the present value as FV/(1 + r*t), but wait, that would be for compound interest, but in this case, it's simple discounting, so it's FV - (FV * r * t). So yes, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee isn't subtracted from the present value, but from the face value? No, the collection fee is a charge for the service, so it's probably subtracted from the proceeds she receives.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is as follows:

Total amount received = (FV - discount) - collection fee.

Which is what I did earlier, giving around $801.23, but that's not an option. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "On January 10 she had it discounted at 6(1/2)%. A (1/8)% charge for collection when due was also made."

Wait, perhaps the discounting at 6.5% is for the remaining period, but the collection fee is a separate fee, maybe not based on the face value.

Wait, no, the collection fee is a percentage of the face value, so it's (1/8)% of $815.50, which is what I calculated as approximately $1.02.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is 1/8% of the discounted amount, but that seems less likely. The problem states it's a charge when due, so perhaps it's applied when the note is due, but since she's discounting it now, maybe she pays that fee upfront.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The bank or whoever is discounting the note charges her the discount (so she gets FV - discount), and also deducts the collection fee. So perhaps the collection fee is subtracted from the present value.

So the total she receives is (FV - discount) - collection fee.

Which is what I did, giving $801.23. But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Options are A: $832.50, B: $820, C: $831.81, D: $815.50, E: $817.25, F: $810, G: $799.25, H: $805.75, I: $800, J: $790.50.

Hmm, none match $801.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the discounting is done on the maturity value, but maybe I should think of it as the present value.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

Proceeds = FV * (1 - (r * t)) - (collection fee).

Wait, that's the same as what I did. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Compute discount: 815.50 * 0.065 * (3/12) = ?

3/12 is 0.25. So 0.065 * 0.25 = 0.01625.

815.50 * 0.01625 = ?

Let me compute it exactly:

815.50 × 0.01625.

Let me break 0.01625 into 0.01 + 0.00625.

815.50 × 0.01 = 8.155.

815.50 × 0.00625 =?

Compute 815.50 × 0.006 = 4.893.

815.50 × 0.00025 = 0.203875.

So 4.893 + 0.203875 = 5.096875.

So total discount is 8.155 + 5.096875 = 13.251875.

So discount is $13.251875.

Proceeds after discount: 815.50 - 13.251875 = 802.248125.

Then subtract collection fee:

Collection fee is (1/8)% of 815.50, which is 815.50 × 0.00125.

Let me compute that accurately.

815.50 × 0.00125.

Well, 800 × 0.00125 = 1.00.

15.50 × 0.00125: 15 × 0.00125 = 0.01875, 0.50 × 0.00125 = 0.000625. So total 0.019375.

So collection fee is 1.00 + 0.019375 = 1.019375.

So total proceeds: 802.248125 - 1.019375 = 801.22875.

Hmm, so approximately $801.23. But none of the options are exactly that. The closest is option I: $800.00, but that's $1.23 off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the discount is calculated. Maybe the discount rate is applied to the face value for the remaining period, but perhaps using 360 days for the calculation.

Wait, wait, in some financial calculations, especially in banking, the year is considered 360 days. So for 3 months, it's 90 days, which is 90/360 = 0.25, same as 3/12. So same calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated using the original 6% rate, but no, she's discounting at 6.5%. So I think that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied to the discounted amount instead of the face value. Let me try that.

So collection fee would be (1/8)% of (FV - discount), which is 802.2481.

So 802.2481 × 0.00125 = ?

Compute 800 × 0.00125 = 1.00.

2.2481 × 0.00125 ≈ 0.002810125.

So total collection fee ≈ 1.00 + 0.00281 ≈ 1.00281.

Then proceeds would be 802.2481 - 1.00281 ≈ 801.2453. Still around $801.25, which isn't matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me read the question again.

"Mrs. Reeves accepted a note for $815.50 at 6% with a four month term on December 10. On January 10 she had it discounted at 6(1/2)%. A (1/8)% charge for collection when due was also made. How much did she receive?"

Wait, the note was accepted at 6%, but when she discounted it, the rate used was 6.5%. So perhaps I should consider the interest that would have accrued from December 10 to January 10, but I'm not sure.

Wait, from December 10 to January 10 is one month. If the note was at 6% per annum, then the interest for one month would be 6% / 12 = 0.5% per month.

So the interest for one month is 815.50 * 0.005 = $4.0775.

Wait, but does that affect the discounting? Because she's holding the note for a month, perhaps she's earned some interest, which she can add to the amount she's discounting.

Wait, but when you discount a note, the face value is the amount due at maturity. So the present value is based on the remaining time. So if she held the note for one month, that's part of the four months.

Wait, but in the initial calculation, I used the remaining three months, which is correct because the total term is four months from December 10. So when she discounts it on January 10, three months remain.

So perhaps I don't need to consider any interest she earned during the one month she held the note, because discounting is based on the time until maturity.

Wait, but perhaps I should think of the note as having a maturity value that includes the interest. Wait no, the face value is $815.50, which is the amount due at maturity, so no interest is added to it. The 6% was the rate at which she accepted the note, but when she discounts it, it's at 6.5%.

So maybe the initial approach was correct. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the discount. Let me try another approach.

Compute the discount first:

Discount = FV × r × t.

FV = $815.50.

r = 6.5% per annum = 0.065.

t = 3 months = 3/12 = 0.25 years.

So discount = 815.50 × 0.065 × 0.25.

Compute 0.065 × 0.25 = 0.01625.

815.50 × 0.01625 = ?

Let me compute 815 × 0.01625.

815 × 0.01625:

Compute 800 × 0.01625 = 13.

15 × 0.01625 = 0.24375.

So 13 + 0.24375 = 13.24375.

Then 0.50 × 0.01625 = 0.008125.

So total discount is 13.24375 + 0.008125 = 13.251875.

So discount is $13.251875.

Proceeds from discounting: 815.50 - 13.251875 = 802.248125.

Then subtract collection fee: 1.019375 (from earlier calculation).

So 802.248125 - 1.019375 = 801.22875 ≈ $801.23.

But the options don't have this amount. So perhaps I made a mistake in including the collection fee. Wait, maybe the collection fee is a flat fee, not a percentage. But the problem says (1/8)%, so it's a percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is applied when the note is due, but since she's discounting it now, the fee is subtracted now.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the present value differently. Maybe the collection fee is part of the discount.

Wait, another approach: the total amount she receives is the present value of the note minus the collection fee.

So first compute the present value: FV / (1 + r * t). But wait, that's the formula for compound interest, but in discounting, it's usually simple interest, so present value is FV - (FV * r * t).

Wait, maybe the correct formula for the proceeds is FV × (1 - r * t) - (FV × fee_rate).

Which is what I did.

Wait, maybe the time is computed differently. Maybe it's 3 months, but in some cases, it's considered as 90 days, so 90/360 = 0.25, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the time is from January 10 to April 10, which is exactly 3 months, so 0.25 years.

Wait,
