Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organizational behavior, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about affective commitment and which option it's least predictive of. Affective commitment, if I remember correctly, is one of the three components of organizational commitment, along with continuance and normative commitment. Affective commitment refers to how emotionally attached an employee is to the organization. It's about how much they identify with the company's goals and values and how much they want to stay because they feel connected.

Now, the question is asking which of the given options is least likely to be predicted by affective commitment. So I need to go through each option and think about whether affective commitment would influence it or not.

Let me list out the options again:

A: productivity
B: individual creativity
C: job satisfaction
D: company loyalty
E: work-life balance
F: job motivation
G: workplace morale
H: turnover
I: leadership style
J: team cohesion

I think affective commitment is closely related to things like job satisfaction (C), company loyalty (D), and job motivation (F). Because if someone is emotionally committed, they're probably more satisfied, more loyal, and more motivated. Similarly, higher affective commitment would likely reduce turnover (H) since they want to stay. It might also influence workplace morale (G), as positive emotions can boost the overall mood in the workplace. Team cohesion (J) could be affected too, because if people are committed, they might work better together.

Productivity (A) might be related because motivated and committed employees tend to be more productive. Individual creativity (B) could be influenced if someone is emotionally invested, they might be more likely to think outside the box. 

Now, work-life balance (E) is about balancing job and personal life. I don't think affective commitment directly affects work-life balance. Whether someone is emotionally committed doesn't necessarily mean they have better or worse work-life balance. It's more about how they manage their time and the company's policies. So E might be the one that's least predictable by affective commitment.

Leadership style (I) is more about how a leader behaves, not directly about an individual's commitment. But wait, does affective commitment relate to how someone perceives their leadership? Maybe not directly. But I'm not too sure. The question is about the least predictive, so perhaps E is a better fit.

So, to recap: affective commitment is about emotional attachment and identification with the organization. It's likely to affect things like loyalty, satisfaction, motivation, turnover, morale, productivity, creativity, and teamwork. But work-life balance is more about how one manages their time between work and personal life, which may not be directly influenced by how committed they feel to the organization. Therefore, the answer should be E.

The correct answer is E: work-life balance. Affective commitment relates to emotional attachment and identification with an organization, influencing factors like job satisfaction, loyalty, motivation, and morale. However, work-life balance is more about time management and personal or organizational policies, not directly tied to emotional commitment.

Answer: E
