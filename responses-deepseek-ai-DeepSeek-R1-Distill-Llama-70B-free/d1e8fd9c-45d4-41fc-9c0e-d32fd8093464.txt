Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Becker's views on cannabis use. Hmm, I remember that Howard Becker was a sociologist who wrote about deviance and drug use. His work was probably in the 60s or 70s. I think he did a study called "Becoming a Marihuana User" or something like that.

Wait, in that study, he talked about how using marijuana wasn't just something people do because they're deviant, but rather it's a learned behavior. So, he probably discussed how people learn to use it through social interactions and processes. Like, they start by trying it, then learning how to get high, and maybe becoming part of a group that uses it regularly.

Looking at the options, option G says it's "learned gradually through the social processes of a deviant career." That sounds right because Becker's idea was about a process where individuals gradually learn the behavior, not just pick it up instantly. So it's about the social learning aspect.

Option C mentions a gateway drug. I think that's more from other theories, not Becker. He focused more on the socialization into drug use rather than it leading to harder drugs.

Option A is about it being dangerous, but I don't think Becker was making a value judgment like that. He was more neutral, observing the process.

Option G seems to fit best because it's about the social learning process and the deviant career, which aligns with Becker's approach.

The correct answer is G. Becker's work emphasized that cannabis use is learned through social interactions and processes, fitting the description of a deviant career.
