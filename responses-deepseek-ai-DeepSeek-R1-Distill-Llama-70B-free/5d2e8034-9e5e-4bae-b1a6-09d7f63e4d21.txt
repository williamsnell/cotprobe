Okay, so I need to find the proceeds from BennetBros. discounting a draft. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the draft is for $3000, dated March 15, and it's due in 2 months after sight. It was discounted on April 15 at a 6% rate. I need to calculate the proceeds, which is the amount BennetBros. gets after discounting.

Wait, I remember that when a bill is discounted, the proceeds are the present value of the draft minus the discount. The discount is calculated based on the interest rate and the time until maturity.

So, the key here is to find out the time period between the date of discounting and the due date. Because the discount is calculated on the time the money is tied up.

The draft is dated March 15, but it's due two months after sight. Oh wait, after sight means that the bill is payable a certain number of days after the sight is given. So, the due date would be when the sight period ends. But when was the sight given? I think the sight is given on March 30 because that's when they accepted it. Wait, no, the problem says they accepted the draft on March 30. So the due date is two months after March 30.

So, March 30 plus two months. March has 31 days, so adding one month would bring us to April 30. Then adding another month, that's May 30. So the due date is May 30th.

But wait, the discounting happened on April 15. So the time from April 15 to May 30 is the period we're considering for the discount.

Let me calculate the number of days between April 15 and May 30. April has 30 days, so from April 15 to April 30 is 15 days. Then May has 31 days, but we're going up to May 30, which is another 30 days. Wait, no, because we're starting from April 15. So April 15 to April 30 is 15 days (since the 15th is included), and then all of May up to the 30th is 30 days. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. April 15 to April 30 is 15 days (including the 15th? Or not?), wait, when you count days between dates, you typically exclude the start date and include the end. But in finance, I think they might count the days differently. Hmm. Wait, perhaps it's easier to just calculate the total days between April 15 and May 30.

Alternatively, perhaps using months as fractions. But since the exact days matter, I think it's better to count the exact days.

So, April 15 to April 30: April has 30 days. So from April 15 (inclusive) to April 30 (inclusive), that's 30 - 15 + 1 = 16 days. Then from May 1 to May 30 is 30 days. So total days would be 16 + 30 = 46 days.

Wait, but wait, the due date is May 30. So if the discount is on April 15, the time until the draft is due is 46 days?

Wait, another approach: the due date is two months after March 30, which is May 30. So from April 15 to May 30 is how many days?

Let me calculate. April has 30 days, so April 15 to April 30 is 15 days (since it's exclusive of the 15th?), no, wait. Maybe a better way is to count each day. From April 15 to April 30 is 15 days (including the 15th). Then May 1 to May 30 is 30 days. So total is 45 days. Or is it 46? Wait, April 15 to April 30: if you include both days, it's 16 days (from 15th to 30th inclusive). Because 30 minus 15 is 15, plus 1 is 16 days. Then May is 30 days, making 46 days total. So 46 days.

But wait, let me double-check. If you have a period starting on day 1 and ending on day 1 the next month, how does that count? Like, from May 1 to May 2 is 2 days. So from April 15 to April 30: 30-15=15, plus 1=16 days. Then May 1 to May 30 is 30 days. So 16+30=46 days.

Now, to find the discount, I need to calculate the interest on $3000 for 46 days at 6% annual rate.

But wait, how do you calculate interest for a certain number of days? The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where t is time in years.

So, first, convert 46 days into years. There are 365 days in a year. So 46/365 = approximately 0.12568... (since 365*0.125=45.625, which is about 45.625 days, close to 46). Wait, 46/365 is approximately 0.12568 years.

Then, the interest would be 3000 * 0.06 * (46/365).

Let me compute that.

First, 0.06 * 3000 = $180 per year. Then, per day, 180 / 365 ≈ 0.49315. So for 46 days, 46 * 0.49315 ≈ 22.665.

So the discount is approximately $22.67.

Therefore, the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount, which is 3000 - 22.67 = 2977.33.

Looking at the options, E is $2977.50. Hmm, that's very close. Maybe I need to compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Compute 46 days in years: 46 / 365 = 0.12568... (exact value is 0.125678...).

Then, 3000 * 0.06 = 180. 180 * 0.125678 ≈ 22.622. So the discount is approximately $22.622, so proceeds are 3000 - 22.622 = 2977.378, which is approximately $2977.38.

The option E is $2977.50, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation comes to that.

Wait, but perhaps the days were calculated differently. Maybe using 30 days per month, which is an approximation sometimes used in business.

Wait, the problem states that the draft is due in 2 months after sight. The sight was on March 30. So two months would be May 30. But when calculating the time, perhaps they're using months as 30 days each. So from April 15 to May 15 is one month (30 days), and then another 15 days from May 15 to May 30. So 30 + 15 = 45 days. Or perhaps they consider the period as 2 months, but we only have part of the period.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. If the due date is May 30, and the discount date is April 15, the time period is 46 days as I calculated earlier. But maybe the problem expects us to use the 30-day months method.

So, from April 15 to May 15 is 30 days, and May 15 to May 30 is another 15 days. So total 45 days.

So 45 days is 45/365 = 0.12329 years.

Then, 3000 * 0.06 = 180. 180 * 0.12329 ≈ 22.1918. So discount is approx $22.19, proceeds 3000 - 22.19 = 2977.81.

Hmm, but that's not matching exactly any option. The closest is still E at 2977.50.

Alternatively, perhaps the time period is considered as 45 days.

Wait, another approach: using the exact days.

From April 15 to May 30 is exactly 45 days?

Wait, April 15 (day 0), April 16 is +1, up to April 30 is 15 days. Then May 1 to May 30 is 30 days, so 15 + 30 = 45 days.

Wait, so maybe I was wrong before. If April 15 is the discount date, then the time until May 30 is 45 days, not 46. Because April 15 to April 30 is 15 days (since you start counting from the next day), plus 30 in May, making 45 days. So I might have made a mistake earlier.

In that case, t = 45/365.

So, 45/365 = 0.12329 years.

Then, 3000 * 0.06 * (45/365) = 3000 * 0.06 * 0.12329.

Compute 0.06 * 0.12329 = 0.007397.

Then, 3000 * 0.007397 = 22.191.

Proceeds: 3000 - 22.191 = $2977.809, which is approximately $2977.81. The closest option is E: $2977.50.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it using exact days without the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the 360-day year for calculation, which is common in some financial calculations. Let me try that.

If using 360 days in a year, then 46 days is 46/360 = 0.12778 years.

3000 * 0.06 * 0.12778 = 3000 * 0.007667 = 23.00.

Proceeds: 3000 - 23 = 2977. So that would give $2977.00, which is not exactly an option, but option E is $2977.50.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the days. Let me recount.

April 15 to April 30: 15 days or 16? Because from April 15 (inclusive) to April 30 (inclusive) is 16 days (since 30-15=15, plus 1 is 16). Then May has 30 days, so 16 + 30 = 46 days. So t=46 days.

Using 365-day year:

t = 46/365 ≈ 0.12568.

Interest: 3000 * 0.06 * 0.12568 ≈ 22.6228.

Proceeds: 3000 - 22.6228 ≈ 2977.38.

Looking at the options, E is 2977.50, which is very close. Maybe the calculation is done with more precise decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the discounting is done using the exact formula without approximating the days. Let me compute 46/365 exactly as a fraction.

46/365 = 0.12567857...

So, 0.06 * 0.12567857 = 0.007540714.

3000 * 0.007540714 = 22.62214.

So, 3000 -22.62214= 2977.37786, which rounds to approximately 2977.38.

The option E is 2977.50. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the days. Let me check again.

Wait, the discount date is April 15, and the due date is May 30. So the number of days between them is April 15 to May 30.

Using a calendar, let's count:

April 15 to April 30: 16 days (including both the 15th and 30th).

May 1 to May 30: 30 days.

So 16 + 30 = 46 days.

Wait, but another way: If today is April 15, then tomorrow is April 16 (day 1), and so on until April 30 is day 15. Then May 1 is day 16, and May 30 is day 45. Because from April 15 to April 30 is 15 days (including the 30th), and from May 1 to 30 is 30 days, making 45 days total.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting counts. Maybe I should think of it as the number of days from April 15 (inclusive) to May 30 (inclusive) is 46 days. So when you include both start and end dates, it's 46 days.

But when calculating interest, the formula typically uses the number of days between the two dates, excluding the start date. Hmm, not sure. Maybe in business, the start date is day 0, so the period is counted as days after that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a different approach. Maybe the sight was accepted on March 30, which is when the two-month period starts. So the due date is May 30.

The time from April 15 (discount date) to May 30 is 45 days. Because March 30 to April 15 is 15 days (so the first 15 days have passed), and then from April 15 to May 30 is 45 days (because two months total minus the 15 days already passed? No, that might not be right.

Wait, perhaps the period after discounting is from April 15 to May 30, which is 45 days. So t = 45/365.

Compute that:

45/365 ≈ 0.12329.

Then 0.06 * 0.12329 ≈ 0.007397.

3000 * 0.007397 ≈ 22.19.

So proceeds: 3000 - 22.19 = 2977.81.

Hmm, but this doesn't exactly match any option either.

Wait, the options are E: 2977.50, which is very close to 2977.38 or 2977.81. Maybe the calculation uses 360 days.

Let me try that. 46 days with 360-year:

46/360 = 0.12778.

0.06 * 0.12778 ≈ 0.007667.

3000 * 0.007667 ≈ 23.00.

Proceeds: 3000 - 23 = 2977.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, the options don't have exactly 2977, but option E is 2977.50, which is 22.5 less than 3000. 3000 - 22.5 = 2977.50.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, 6% of 3000 is 180 per annum. So per day, it's 180 / 365 = approximately 0.4931.

If the period is 45 days, then interest is 45 * 0.4931 ≈ 22.20.

So proceeds: 3000 - 22.20 = 2977.80.

Alternatively, if the period is 46 days, 46 * 0.4931 ≈ 22.67. 3000 - 22.67 = 2977.33.

Wait, but option E is 2977.50. So perhaps the calculation is done with a different number of days.

Wait, another approach: the due date is two months after March 30, which is May 30. The discounting is on April 15. So the time from discounting to due date is 1 month and 15 days.

But in terms of exact days, that's 45 days as April has 30 days, so from April 15 to May 15 is 30 days, then 15 more days to May 30, making 45 days.

So t = 45/365 = 0.12329 years.

So interest = 3000 * 0.06 * (45/365).

Compute that:

3000 * 0.06 = 180.

180 * (45/365) = (180 * 45) / 365.

180*45 = 8100.

8100 / 365 = approximately 22.1918.

So discount is $22.19, proceeds $2977.81.

But option E is $2977.50, which is 22.5 off. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's calculated using 30 days per month. So two months after March 30 is May 30, but the time from April 15 to May 30 is considered as 1.5 months or 3/2 months.

Wait, 1.5 months is 0.04167 years (since 1.5 /12 = 0.125), but wait, no. 1.5 months is 1.5/12 = 0.125 years.

Wait, no. 1.5 months is 3/2 months, divided by 12 is 3/(2*12) = 1/8 = 0.125 years.

So, interest would be 3000 * 0.06 * 0.125 = 3000 * 0.0075 = 22.5.

Proceeds: 3000 -22.5= 2977.50, which is option E.

Ah, that makes sense! So the time is considered as 1.5 months, which is 0.125 years. So the discount is 22.5, leading to proceeds of 2977.50, which is option E.

So I think the correct answer is E.

To determine the proceeds from BennetBros. discounting the draft, we need to calculate the discount and subtract it from the face value of the draft. The draft is for $3000, dated March 15, and due in 2 months after sight. It was discounted on April 15 at a 6% annual interest rate.

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the Due Date**:  
   The draft is due two months after March 30 (the date of sight). Adding two months to March 30 brings us to May 30. Thus, the due date is **May 30**.

2. **Calculate the Time Period**:  
   The discounting date is April 15, and the due date is May 30. The time period between these dates is calculated as follows:  
   - From April 15 to April 30: 15 days.  
   - From May 1 to May 30: 30 days.  
   - Total: **45 days**.

3. **Convert Time to Years**:  
   To calculate the discount, the time period must be expressed in years. Using the 365-day year convention:  
   \[
   t = \frac{45}{365} \approx 0.12329 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the Discount**:  
   The discount is calculated using the simple interest formula:  
   \[
