Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem about airflow through a converging nozzle. Hmm, I remember that when a gas flows through a nozzle, especially under isentropic conditions, certain equations apply. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that air is behaving as an ideal gas. It enters the nozzle at 25 Bar and 50°C. The nozzle is converging, which I think means the cross-sectional area decreases from inlet to exit, so the exit area is given as 6e-4 m². The initial velocity is negligible, so I can probably ignore that term in the energy equation.

The task is to find the mass flow rate and the exit velocity for two cases: a) exit pressure 15 Bar and b) 12 Bar. The properties provided are Cp = 32 kJ/kg·mol·K, Cv = 20.84 kJ/kg·mol·K, and molar mass M = 29 kg/kg·mol. Wait, that seems a bit off. Oh wait, I think the molar mass is 29 kg per kg·mol, so M = 29 kg/kmol.

Since it's isentropic flow, entropy remains constant. I remember that for isentropic flow, the stagnation temperature and pressure are related to the static properties. Also, the critical pressure ratio comes into play when the flow becomes choked, but I don't know if that's the case here.

I think the first step is to determine whether the flow is subsonic or if it's choked. The critical pressure ratio (P*) is when the flow reaches Mach 1 at the exit. The critical pressure ratio for air is given by (P/P0) = (2/(γ+1))^(γ/(γ-1)), where γ is the heat capacity ratio, Cp/Cv.

Let me calculate γ first. Cp is 32, Cv is 20.84. So γ = 32 / 20.84 ≈ 1.536. Hmm, wait, that's not right. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because the given Cp and Cv are per kg·mol, but for air, the specific heats are usually given per unit mass. But wait, wait: I think that in this problem, the given Cp is 32 kJ/kg·mol·K. So I need to compute specific heats per unit mass. Wait, wait, no: the specific heat ratio γ is Cp/Cv when both are on the same basis, like per mole or per kg. So since both are given per kg·mol, that's fine.

So γ = Cp / Cv = 32 / 20.84 ≈ 1.536. Let me double-check: 20.84 * 1.5 = 31.26, which is close to 32, so yes, about 1.536.

The critical pressure ratio is (2/(γ+1))^(γ/(γ-1)). Let's plug in γ = 1.536.

First, compute (2/(1.536 + 1)) = 2/(2.536) ≈ 0.7897.

Then, the exponent is γ/(γ-1) = 1.536/(0.536) ≈ 2.866.

So (0.7897)^(2.866) ≈ Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.7897 squared is about 0.623. 0.7897 cubed is about 0.491. Wait, but 2.866 is approximately 2 and 13/16, so maybe around 0.491 * 0.7897^0.866. Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, I can use the formula for air, which usually has γ=1.4, but here it's given as higher. Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating γ. Because for air, γ is typically around 1.4, but in this problem, Cp is given as 32 and Cv as 20.84. Let me compute that again.

Yes, 32 divided by 20.84 is approximately 1.536. So I'm correct in that. So the critical pressure ratio is (2/(γ+1))^(γ/(γ-1)).

Ok, so with γ=1.536, let me compute it accurately.

Compute numerator: 2 = 2.

Denominator: γ+1 = 2.536.

So 2/2.536 ≈ 0.7897.

Exponent: 1.536/(1.536-1) = 1.536/0.536 ≈ 2.866.

Now, 0.7897^2.866. Let's compute this.

We can take natural logs: ln(0.7897) ≈ -0.2338.

Multiply by 2.866: -0.2338 * 2.866 ≈ -0.6705.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.6705) ≈ 0.512.

So the critical pressure ratio (P/P0) is approx 0.512. So for a given inlet pressure P0, the exit pressure P must be greater than P0 * 0.512 for the flow to be subsonic. If P is lower than that, the exit would be at the critical pressure, and the flow becomes choked.

Wait, no, wait. The critical pressure P* is when the exit pressure equals P*, which is P0 * (2/(γ+1))^(γ/(γ-1)). So if the actual exit pressure is higher than P*, the flow is subsonic; if it's lower, the flow is choked, meaning the exit pressure will be P*.

So for part a, the exit pressure is 15 Bar. The inlet pressure is 25 Bar. So P_exit = 15 Bar. Let me compute the critical pressure.

P* = P0 * (2/(γ+1))^(γ/(γ-1)) ≈ 25 Bar * 0.512 ≈ 12.8 Bar.

Wait, so if P_exit is 15 Bar which is higher than 12.8 Bar, the flow is subsonic, and the exit velocity is less than the speed of sound. But if P_exit is 12 Bar, which is lower than 12.8 Bar, then the flow would be choked, and the exit pressure would actually be 12.8 Bar, right? Or wait, no. Wait, when the nozzle is converging, if the exit pressure is less than the critical pressure, the flow becomes sonic (Mach 1) at the exit. And you can't have pressures lower than that; the exit pressure would adjust to P*.

Wait, no, that's only if the nozzle is a converging-diverging nozzle. Wait, no, for a converging nozzle, the maximum exit Mach number is 1. So for a converging nozzle, if the pressure ratio P_exit/P0 is less than the critical pressure ratio (0.512 in this case), then the exit would be at Mach 1, and the exit pressure would be P* = P0 * 0.512. So in the case where the exit is set to 12 Bar, which is less than 12.8 Bar, the actual exit pressure can't go below 12.8 Bar. So the exit would be at 12.8 Bar, and the flow would be choked.

Wait, wait, let me make this clear. The problem says the exit pressure is 15 Bar and 12 Bar. So for part a), P_exit = 15 Bar. Since 15 > 12.8, the flow is subsonic, so the exit pressure is indeed 15 Bar, and the velocity is subsonic.

For part b), P_exit =12 Bar, which is less than 12.8 Bar, so the flow is choked, and the exit pressure would be at P* =12.8 Bar, and the exit Mach number is 1.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that the exit pressure is fixed. It just says to calculate for those exit pressures. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the exit pressure is as given, but for part b), if P_exit is less than P*, then the actual exit pressure is P*, and the mass flow is limited. So perhaps in part b), the exit pressure is actually 12.8 Bar, but I need to check.

Alternatively, perhaps the given exit pressures are possible, so I should proceed without considering choking.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, using the isentropic relations regardless of the pressure ratio.

Wait, let me think: for an isentropic flow through a nozzle, the mass flow rate can be calculated using the equation:

m_dot = A2 * P2 * v2 / (R * T2)

But alternatively, another approach uses the stagnation temperatures and pressures.

Alternatively, using the formula for mass flow rate:

m_dot = (A2 * P0) / (sqrt(R * T0)) ) * sqrt( (2/(R-1)) * (1 - (P2/P0)^((R-1)/R)) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to use the isentropic relations between temperatures and pressures.

The energy equation for a nozzle is:

h0 = h2 + (v2)^2 / 2

Where h0 is the stagnation enthalpy at the inlet, and h2 is the static enthalpy at the exit. Since the process is isentropic, h0 is also the stagnation enthalpy at the exit.

For ideal gases, h depends only on temperature. So T0 (stagnation temperature at inlet) equals T02 (stagnation at exit). So:

Cp * (T0 - T2) = (v2)^2 / 2

So v2 = sqrt(2 * Cp * (T0 - T2))

But to find T2, we can use the isentropic relation between T and P:

(T2 / T0) = (P2 / P0) ^ ((γ-1)/γ )

Wait, wait, let me make sure. The relation is T / T0 = (P / P0) ^ ((γ-1)/γ )

Yes, because for isentropic processes, T P^((1-γ)/γ) = constant. So T = T0 (P / P0) ^ ((γ-1)/γ )

So T2 = T0 * (P2 / P0) ^ ((γ-1)/γ )

Then, substituting back into the velocity equation:

v2 = sqrt( 2 Cp (T0 - T2) )

= sqrt( 2 Cp T0 [ 1 - (P2/P0)^( (γ-1)/γ ) ] )

Now, the mass flow rate m_dot is A2 * rho2 * v2, where rho2 is the density at the exit.

Density rho2 can be calculated using the ideal gas law: rho2 = P2 M / (R T2)

Wait, M is molar mass (29 kg/kmol), R is the universal gas constant, 8.314 kJ/kmol·K.

Wait, but wait, in SI units, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, which is 8.314 kJ/kmol·K.

So putting it all together:

m_dot = A2 * (P2 M / (R T2)) ) * v2

Substituting T2 from earlier:

m_dot = A2 * (P2 M / (R * T0 (P2/P0)^( (γ-1)/γ ) )) ) * sqrt( 2 Cp T0 [ 1 - (P2/P0)^( (γ-1)/γ ) ] )

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify it.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let me compute T0. The inlet temperature is 50°C, which is 323.15 K.

T0 = 323.15 K.

Now, for part a), P2 = 15 Bar, P0 = 25 Bar.

Compute (P2/P0) = 15/25 = 0.6.

Compute (γ-1)/γ = (1.536 -1)/1.536 = 0.536/1.536 ≈ 0.349.

So (P2/P0)^(0.349) = 0.6^0.349.

Let me compute that. Let me think, 0.6^0.5 is sqrt(0.6) ≈ 0.7746. So 0.6^0.349 is a bit higher than that, maybe around 0.78.

Compute ln(0.6) ≈ -0.5108.

Multiply by 0.349: -0.5108 * 0.349 ≈ -0.1783.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.1783) ≈ 0.836.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake. Wait, the exponent is (γ-1)/γ = 0.349, and (P2/P0) is 0.6. So (0.6)^0.349.

Alternatively, using logarithm:

ln(0.6^0.349) = 0.349 * ln(0.6) ≈ 0.349 * (-0.5108) ≈ -0.1783.

e^(-0.1783) ≈ 0.836.

So (P2/P0)^( (γ-1)/γ ) ≈ 0.836.

So T2 = T0 * 0.836 ≈ 323.15 * 0.836 ≈ 270.3 K.

Now, compute [1 - (P2/P0)^((γ-1)/γ ) ] = 1 - 0.836 = 0.164.

Now, compute v2 = sqrt( 2 * Cp * T0 * 0.164 )

Cp is given as 32 kJ/kg·mol·K. Wait, but wait, in the energy equation, Cp should be in J/kg·K, right? Because velocity is in m/s, which uses SI units.

Wait, 32 kJ/kg·mol·K is 32,000 J/kg·mol·K. But wait, I have to be careful with units.

Wait, no, perhaps I should convert everything into per kg basis. Because in the problem, M is given as 29 kg/kg·mol, which is 29 kg per kmol. So perhaps I should compute specific heat per unit mass.

Wait, right, because the given Cp is per kg·mol, but for the velocity equation, we need specific heat per unit mass.

So, Cp specific (per kg) = (32 kJ/kg·mol·K) * (1 kg·mol / 29 kg) ) = 32 / 29 ≈ 1.1034 kJ/kg·K = 1103.4 J/kg·K.

Similarly, but wait, in the energy equation, h = Cp * T, so if we're using per kg basis, then Cp is 1103.4 J/kg·K.

So, v2 = sqrt( 2 * Cp * (T0 - T2) )

Wait, T0 is 323.15 K, T2 is 270.3 K, so T0 - T2 = 52.85 K.

So 2 * Cp * (T0 - T2) = 2 * 1103.4 J/kg·K * 52.85 K = 2 * 1103.4 * 52.85 ≈ 2 * 1103.4 * 50 ≈ 2 * 55170 ≈ 110,340 J/kg.

Wait, but 52.85 is closer to 53, so 2 * 1103.4 *53 ≈ 2 * 1103.4 *50 + 2 *1103.4 *3 = 2*55170 + 2*3309.9 = 110340 + 6619.8 ≈ 116,959.8 J/kg.

So v2 = sqrt(116959.8) ≈ sqrt(1.1696e5) ≈ 341.7 m/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 2 * 1103.4 = 2206.8 J/kg/K * K = J/kg.

Wait, wait, T0 - T2 is 323.15 - 270.3 = 52.85 K.

So 2206.8 * 52.85 ≈ Let's compute that.

2206.8 * 50 = 110,340.

2206.8 * 2.85 ≈ 2206.8 *2 = 4413.6; 2206.8 *0.85 ≈ 1875.58. So total 4413.6 +1875.58≈ 6289.18.

So total is 110340 + 6289.18 ≈ 116,629.18 J/kg.

So v2 = sqrt(116629.18) ≈ 341.6 m/s.

Wait, but earlier when I used the 0.164 factor, I think I did it wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: since [1 - (P2/P0)^((γ-1)/γ ) ] is 0.164, and 2*Cp*T0*(0.164) is 2*32,000 J/kg·mol·K * (323.15 K) * 0.164, but wait, no, I think I'm getting confused again between per kg and per kg·mol.

Let me try again: I think I might have made a mistake in calculating Cp per kg. Let me clarify:

Given:

Cp = 32 kJ/kg·mol·K = 32,000 J/kg·mol·K

Molar mass M = 29 kg/kg·mol.

So specific heat per kg is Cp_specific = Cp / M = 32,000 J/kg·mol·K / 29 kg/kg·mol = 32,000 /29 ≈ 1103.448 J/kg·K.

So yes, that's correct.

So T0 = 323.15 K.

T2 = T0 * (P2/P0)^( (γ-1)/γ ) = 323.15 * 0.836 ≈ 270.3 K.

So (T0 - T2) = 52.85 K.

So the velocity v2 is sqrt(2 * Cp_specific * (T0 - T2)).

So 2 * 1103.448 * 52.85 ≈ 2 * 1103.448 ≈ 2206.896; 2206.896 *52.85 ≈ Let me compute 2206.896 * 50 = 110,344.8; 2206.896 *2.85 = approx 2206.896*2=4413.792, 2206.896*0.85≈ 1875.57; so 4413.792 +
