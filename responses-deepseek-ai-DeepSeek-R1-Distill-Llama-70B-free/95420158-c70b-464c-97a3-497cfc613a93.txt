Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about English law and the incorporation of custom. Hmm, I remember from my studies that common law has some principles about how customs become part of the law. Let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking about the fundamental prerequisite for custom to be incorporated under English law. The options are A through J.

I think the key here is understanding how customs are treated in the English legal system. From what I recall, the English legal system, which is a common law system, recognizes custom as a source of law, but it has certain conditions. One of the main points is that for a custom to be considered part of the law, it must be recognized by the courts.

Wait, but when does the court recognize a custom? I remember something about it needing to meet certain criteria. I think one of the main criteria is that the custom must have existed for a long time, like "since time immemorial," which I think is usually taken to mean, what, a few centuries? But I'm not sure if that's the prerequisite for incorporation or just one of the factors.

Another point I remember is that custom doesn't override statute. So if there's existing legislation (statute), custom can't go against it. So maybe the custom has to be consistent with the existing laws. So if a custom conflicts with legislation, it's not incorporated.

Wait, let me think about each option:

Option A: Custom is superior to English law. I don't think that's right. Statutes are higher than common law, which includes custom. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Custom isn't incorporated at all. No, that's not true. Custom is part of common law, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Approved by the Queen. I don't recall that being a condition. The Queen's role is more in legislation through royal assent, but I don't think customs require her approval. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: Not in conflict with existing legislation. That sounds familiar. Because if a custom goes against an Act of Parliament, the statute would take precedence. So for custom to be incorporated, it must not conflict with existing laws. So D might be correct.

Option E: Practiced for at least a century. I think time is a factor, but I'm not sure if a century is the exact requirement. Wait, I think the traditional test was "since time immemorial," which is before 1189, but that's more for ancient customs. Modern customs might have a different timeframe, but I don't think the exact period like a century is a strict rule. So E might not be the fundamental prerequisite.

Option F: Ratified by a national referendum. No, that doesn't make sense. Referendums aren't part of the process for incorporating customs into law. So F is wrong.

Option G: Universally practiced throughout England. That's too broad. Customs can be local, like in a particular area. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Recognised by Parliament first. I thought that customs are recognized by the courts, not necessarily by Parliament. Parliament makes statutes, but customs are part of common law, which the courts develop. So H seems off.

Option I: Not in conflict with common law. Wait, but isn't custom part of common law? So if a custom is in conflict with existing common law principles, would it not be incorporated? Or does it mean that custom has to fit within the existing common law framework?

Hmm, the traditional view is that custom must be consistent with the common law. But I'm a bit confused here between options D and I. Option D says it must not conflict with existing legislation (statutes), and I says it must not conflict with common law.

Wait, let me clarify: Common law includes both judicial decisions and customs. So when a custom is recognized, it's part of the common law. So if a new custom is proposed, it must not conflict with existing common law or legislation. But the question is about the fundamental prerequisite for incorporation. So which is more critical?

I think that for a custom to be valid, it must not be contrary to statute. Because statute is a higher source of law than custom. So if a custom is in conflict with an existing statute, the statute prevails, and the custom isn't incorporated. So option D would be correct.

Wait, but option I says it must not conflict with the common law. But common law is judge-made. So if a custom is recognized, it becomes part of the common law. So maybe the prerequisite is that it's consistent with the common law? Or is it more about not conflicting with statutes?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The hierarchy of laws is: EU law (though maybe not anymore), then statutes (Acts of Parliament), then common law (including custom). So if a custom is in conflict with a statute, the statute takes precedence, and the custom isn't applied. So for a custom to be incorporated, it must not conflict with existing statutes. So option D is correct.

Alternatively, if a custom is in conflict with the common law, perhaps the common law would take precedence, but I'm not sure. Because the common law is built upon customs and judicial decisions. So maybe the court would weigh which one is more established.

But from what I remember, the key requirement is that custom must not be contrary to statute. Because statutes are made by Parliament and are considered a higher authority. So in that case, option D is the correct answer.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer is D: Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation.

The question asks about the fundamental prerequisite for the incorporation of custom under English law. To determine the correct answer, it is important to understand the relationship between custom and other sources of law in the English legal system. Custom is a component of common law, but for it to be recognized and incorporated, it must meet certain criteria.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests that custom is superior to English law, which is incorrect because statutes (legislation) take precedence over custom.
- **Option B** claims that custom is not incorporated under English law, but this is false as custom is indeed part of common law.
- **Option C** states that custom must be approved by the Queen, which is unrelated to the incorporation of custom.
- **Option D** indicates that custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation. This aligns with the principle that statutes, being a higher source of law, take precedence over custom. For custom to be valid, it must not contradict existing legislation.
- **Option E** mentions that custom must have been practiced for at least a century. While time is a factor in recognizing custom, the exact requirement of a century is not a strict rule.
- **Option F** suggests ratification by a national referendum, which is not relevant to the incorporation of custom.
- **Option G** claims that custom must be universally practiced throughout England, but customs can be local rather than universal.
- **Option H** states that custom must be recognized by Parliament first, but customs are typically recognized by the courts, not Parliament.
- **Option I** suggests that custom must not conflict with common law. While custom is part of common law, the more critical prerequisite is that it does not conflict with legislation, as statutes are a higher source of law.
- **Option J** claims that custom is incorporated through implementing legislation, which is incorrect because customs are part of common law and do not require legislation to be recognized.

The fundamental prerequisite for the incorporation of custom is that it must not conflict with existing legislation, as statutes take precedence over custom. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: Custom is incorporated if it is not in conflict with existing legislation.**

Answer: D
