Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about hypothesis testing, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking which statement is true about hypothesis testing. The options are from A to I. I remember that hypothesis testing involves a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha). The steps usually include setting up the hypotheses, choosing a significance level, calculating a test statistic, determining the p-value, and making a decision based on that.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.
Hmm, I think the alternative hypothesis determines whether it's one-sided or two-sided. Usually, you should decide this before looking at the data because the alternative hypothesis is part of your research question. If you decide after data collection, it might be data dredging or fishing for significance, which isn't good practice. So I think A is incorrect.

Option B: The power of a test concerns its ability to reject a null hypothesis.
Wait, power is about the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. So it's about detecting when the alternative is true. So B says it's about rejecting H0, which is correct in a way, but I think more precisely, it's about the ability to detect the alternative. So maybe B isn't the best choice, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.
Yes, that sounds right. Power is the probability that the test correctly rejects H0 when H1 is true. So it's about detecting H1. So C seems correct.

Option D: If a hypothesis test is conducted at the 10% level, there is a 10% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.
Wait, no. The significance level (like 10%) is the probability of rejecting H0 when it's actually true (Type I error). It doesn't mean that 10% of the time you'll reject H0 in general. It depends on whether H0 is true or not. If H0 is false, the probability of rejection would be higher, depending on the power. So D is incorrect.

Option E: If there is sufficient evidence to reject H0 at the 5% level, then there's enough evidence to reject it at the 10% level.
Ah, because the 5% level is stricter. If your p-value is less than 5%, it's definitely less than 10%. So yes, if you reject at 5%, you'd also reject at 10%. So E is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which is a true statement. So both C and E could be correct. But I need to check all options.

Option F: If a test is conducted at 1%, there's a 99% chance of not rejecting H0.
No, the significance level is the chance of Type I error (rejecting H0 when it's true). It doesn't mean that 99% of the time you won't reject. If H0 is false, you might have a higher chance of rejection. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The power concerns the ability to detect H0.
No, power is about detecting H1 when it's true. G is incorrect.

Option H: If you can reject H0 at 10%, you can reject it at 5%.
No, the opposite of E. 10% is less strict than 5%, so if you reject at 10%, you might not at 5% because the p-value might be between 5% and 10%. So H is incorrect.

Option I: If a test is at 1%, there's a 1% chance of rejecting H0.
Similar to D and F. The significance level is the probability of Type I error, assuming H0 is true. But the overall probability of rejection also depends on H1 being true. So I is incorrect.

So, back to the options. So C and E are both correct statements.

Wait, the question is which is a true statement. So perhaps both C and E are correct. But looking at the options, each option is a separate choice. Let me reevaluate.

Looking again at option E: If sufficient to reject at 5%, then sufficient at 10%. That's correct because 5% is more stringent. So the p-value must be <=0.05, which is also <=0.10. So E is correct.

Option C: Power is about detecting H1. Yes, that's correct. So both C and E are correct statements.

Wait, but the question asks which is a true statement. So which of the options is correct. Both C and E are correct, but I have to pick the answer from the options given.

Wait, looking at the options again, only one can be correct because it's a multiple-choice question. Let me check if I made a mistake.

Wait, the options don't say which are correct, but the question is to select the correct one.

So, looking back, perhaps both C and E are correct. But let me think again.

Wait, the question asks which is a true statement. So if multiple are correct, but in the options, only one is presented as correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's think about each option again.

Option C: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. Yes, that's correct.

Option E: If you can reject at 5%, you can reject at 10%. Also correct.

So both C and E are correct statements. But the options are A-J, and each is a separate option. So perhaps the correct answer includes both C and E.

But the way the question is phrased, it's a single choice. Wait, but in the options given, each option is a separate statement. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the question is to choose which is true.

Wait, but the way the question is structured, each option is a possible true statement. So perhaps both C and E are correct, but the options provided may have only one.

Wait, the options are A to I. Let me see.

Wait, the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps both C and E are correct, but the question allows only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Let me focus on each statement.

Option C is definitely correct. Power is about the probability of rejecting H0 when H1 is true, so it's about detecting H1.

Option E is also correct because lower significance levels are more stringent. So if you reject at 5%, you must reject at 10%.

So the question is which is a true statement. Both C and E are correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as A through I, each being a separate statement. So the correct answer must be one of them. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and E, but each is an option. So maybe the question expects only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

A: One- or two-sided decided after data. Incorrect.

B: Power about rejecting H0. Partially correct but less precise than C.

C: Power about detecting H1. Correct.

D: 10% level, 10% chance reject H0. Incorrect.

E: Reject at 5%, so reject at 10%. Correct.

F: 1% level, 99% not reject. Incorrect.

G: Power about H0. Incorrect.

H: Reject at 10%, so at 5%. Incorrect.

I: 1% level, 1% chance reject. Incorrect.

So both C and E are correct statements. But the question is looking for one correct answer. So perhaps the correct answers are both C and E, but the options only include them as separate options.

Wait, but the answer options are A to I, each being a single statement, so perhaps the correct answer is both C and E. But the way the question is phrased, we have to choose which is a true statement. So both C and E are true.

But looking at the options, both are presented as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer includes both C and E, but the question allows only one selection. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the question allows for multiple correct statements, but the options are structured such that only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken about E.

Let me think again about E. If you have enough evidence to reject at 5%, that means the p-value is less than 0.05. Since 0.05 is less than 0.10, the p-value is also less than 0.10, so you would reject at the 10% level as well. So E is correct.

So both C and E are correct statements. But in the given options, both are separate options. So perhaps the answer expects to choose both, but since it's a single-answer question, perhaps only one is intended as correct.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each statement again.

Option C: The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis. Yes, correct.

Option E: If sufficient evidence to reject H0 at 5%, then also at 10%. Yes, correct.

So both are correct. But the question asks which is a true statement, implying that only one is correct. That can't be right. Perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that only E is correct. Wait, but C is definitely correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's a more direct statement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me see the options again.

Wait, the options are as follows:

A: No.

B: Partial.

C: Yes.

D: No.

E: Yes.

F: No.

G: No.

H: No.

I: No.

So both C and E are correct. But the question is which is a true statement, so perhaps both are correct. But the options are presented as single choices.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps E is correct because if you reject at 5%, you must reject at 10%. So E is correct.

C is also correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both C and E, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps only E is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is E. Because the question is about which statement is true, and E is unambiguously correct, while C is a bit more about the definition of power.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects both C and E to be correct, but that's not possible in this format.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact definitions.

Power is the probability that the test correctly rejects H0 when H1 is true. So power is about detecting H1. So C is correct.

E is also correct.

So both C and E are correct statements.

But the options are separate. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but the question is multiple-choice with only one option correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because it's a more specific statement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both C and E, but looking at the possible answers, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but looking again, the options given are A to I, each as separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and E, but each is an option, so the intended correct answer is both C and E.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's a single correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps option E is the correct answer because it's a more directly true statement without any ambiguity. While C is correct, perhaps B is incorrect.

Wait, option B says the power is about the ability to reject H0. That's partially correct because power is about rejecting H0 when it's false. So B is also correct in a way, but perhaps less precise than C.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on the options again.

I think the correct answer is both C and E. But the question expects a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is E. Because E is a clear true statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is both C and E, but the options are structured so that only one is correct. So perhaps in the given options, both C and E are correct, but the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have E as the correct answer, and C is a distractor.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to make a decision.

I think both C and E are correct. But since I have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is E. Alternatively, perhaps C is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because it's a statement about the relationship between significance levels, which is a more concrete fact, while C is about the definition of power, which is also correct.

But the question is which is a true statement, and both are true. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but in the options, perhaps only E is presented as correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is E. Or maybe I should consider that option E is correct because it's a more specific scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is both C and E, but since the options are separate, perhaps the test expects both to be correct, but in reality, only E is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me see.

Another approach: look for the statements that are definitely correct.

Option C: Power is about detecting H1. Correct.

Option E: Reject at 5% implies reject at 10%. Correct.

So both are correct. But the options are A to I.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is E because it's a more specific and perhaps more commonly tested fact.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is both C and E, but in the given options, both are separate.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the options again. The question is about which is a true statement, so both C and E are true. But since only one can be selected, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E because it's a more direct statement about hypothesis testing procedure, while C is about power, which is a related but separate concept.

Wait, but the question is about hypothesis testing in general, so both could apply.

I think the correct answer is both C and E are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question asks which is a true statement. So any that are true are correct. So if both C and E are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps both are correct, but the question expects us to select all that apply. But since it's a single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C and E, but since they are separate options, perhaps the correct answer is both.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's a single correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both are correct.

Wait, perhaps E is correct and C is also correct, but the question requires selecting all correct options, which isn't the case here. So perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because it's a more direct statement about the testing procedure.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me summarize.

The correct statements are C and E. Since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure. However, in reality, both are correct.

But perhaps the intended answer is E because it's a more specific statement about the relationship between significance levels. So I'll go with E.

To determine which statement is true about hypothesis testing, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The decision to use a one- or two-sided test should be based on the research question and alternative hypothesis, not decided after data collection, as this could lead to data dredging.

- **Option B**: Partially correct but less precise. Power concerns the ability to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true, but it is more accurately described as the ability to detect the alternative hypothesis.

- **Option C**: Correct. The power of a test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true, making it about detecting the alternative hypothesis.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. The significance level (e.g., 10%) represents the probability of Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). It does not mean there is a 10% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis overall, as this depends on whether the null hypothesis is true or false.

- **Option E**: Correct. If there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level (p-value ≤ 0.05), then there is also sufficient evidence to reject it at the 10% level (p-value ≤ 0.10), as 0.05 is more stringent than 0.10.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. A 1% significance level means there is a 1% chance of Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). It does not mean there is a 99% chance of not rejecting the null hypothesis overall, as this depends on the power of the test.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. Power concerns the ability to detect the alternative hypothesis, not the null hypothesis.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. If a hypothesis is rejected at the 10% level, it does not necessarily mean it will be rejected at the 5% level, as the p-value could be between 0.05 and 0.10.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. A 1% significance level does not mean there is a 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis overall, as this depends on whether the null hypothesis is true or false.

Both **Option C** and **Option E** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for a single true statement, **Option E** is the more specific and direct statement about hypothesis testing procedure.
