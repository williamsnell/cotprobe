Okay, so I've got this physics question here about comparing electrostatic and gravitational forces between an electron and a proton. Hmm, I remember that both forces act between these particles since they have charge and mass. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll have to think this through.

First, I recall that the electrostatic force is given by Coulomb's Law, which is F_e = k*(q1*q2)/r². And the gravitational force is F_g = G*(m1*m2)/r². Both are inverse square laws, so they depend similarly on distance. That might rule out some options that talk about distance dependence.

Looking at the options, option A says electrostatic forces act only at certain distances, while gravitational at all. Wait, no, both act at all distances. So A is wrong.

Option B: Gravitational force inversely proportional to charge? No, gravitational force depends on mass, not charge. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Gravitational greater than electrostatic. That doesn't sound right. I think the electric force is way stronger. Like, I remember hearing that electric forces are about 10^36 times stronger than gravity. So C is wrong.

Option D: Gravitational ignored because balanced by electrostatic. Well, gravitational forces are much weaker, so they can usually be ignored in systems where electric forces dominate. But the option says they are 'always' balanced, which I'm not sure about. Also, sometimes in neutral systems, maybe, but not always. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Electrostatic is enormously greater than gravitational. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The electric force is way stronger, so E sounds right.

Option F: Both negligible in atomic systems. No, in atoms, the electric force is what holds electrons in orbit, so F is wrong.

Option G: Gravitational increases and becomes stronger at short distances. Wait, no, because both forces increase as r decreases. But since electric is so much stronger overall, the gravitational would still be weaker. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Forces are equal. No, electric is way stronger, so H is wrong.

Option I: Electrostatic varies with mass? No, Coulomb's law doesn't involve mass, only charge. I is wrong.

Option J: Electric only slightly greater? No, it's way more, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. The electrostatic force is enormously greater than the gravitational.

The electrostatic force between an electron and a proton is governed by Coulomb's Law, \( F_e = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \), while the gravitational force is given by Newton's Law of Gravitation, \( F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \). Both forces follow an inverse square law, meaning they act at all distances and increase as the particles get closer. However, the electrostatic force is vastly stronger than the gravitational force by approximately \( 10^{36} \) times. This is because the electric force depends on charge, and the charges of the electron and proton are significant, whereas the gravitational force depends on mass, and the masses of these particles are extremely small.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Both forces act at all distances.
- **B**: Incorrect. Gravitational force depends on mass, not charge.
- **C**: Incorrect. The gravitational force is much weaker than the electrostatic force.
- **D**: Incorrect. Gravitational forces are not always balanced by electrostatic forces; they are simply negligible in comparison.
- **E**: Correct. The electrostatic force is enormously greater than the gravitational force.
- **F**: Incorrect. Electrostatic forces are significant in atomic systems.
- **G**: Incorrect. While both forces increase at shorter distances, the electrostatic force remains vastly stronger.
- **H**: Incorrect. The forces are not equal; the electrostatic force dominates.
- **I**: Incorrect. The electrostatic force does not vary with mass.
- **J**: Incorrect. The electrostatic force is not just slightly greater; it is enormously greater.

The correct answer is **E**.
