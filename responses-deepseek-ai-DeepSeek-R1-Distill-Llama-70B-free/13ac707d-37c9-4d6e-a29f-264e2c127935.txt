Question:

Describe the function of the sea star's stomach as the animal feeds upon a clam.

Options:

A: The sea star's stomach remains inside its body and absorbs nutrients directly from the water as the clam is digested externally.
B: The sea star's stomach is used to capture prey by extending out and enveloping the entire clam.
C: The sea star's stomach acts as a pump to forcefully open the clam's shell before ingestion.
D: The sea star's stomach is used to filter out unwanted particles from the food.
E: The sea star's stomach is used to grind the clam's shell into digestible pieces.
F: The sea star's stomach produces light to distract the clam while other sea stars feed on it.
G: The sea star's stomach secretes a strong acid to dissolve the clam's shell completely before ingestion.
H: The sea star's stomach releases electrical charges to stun the clam before feeding.
I: The sea star's stomach is used to store food for later consumption.
J: The sea star's stomach is everted, enters the clam's shell, releases digestive enzymes to degrade the clam's body, and then retracts after eating.

Okay, so I've got this question about sea stars and their stomach function when feeding on a clam. I'm a bit rusty on my marine biology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that sea stars, also known as starfish, have a unique way of eating. They don't have teeth like humans do, so they must have some other method to consume their prey. I think they eat clams and other shellfish, which have hard shells that are difficult to open.

Wait, I recall something about their stomach being involved in the digestion process outside their body. Oh right! Some animals have an external digestion method. Sea stars, if I'm not mistaken, can actually expel their stomachs. So they push their stomach out of their body to digest the prey externally. 

So when a sea star feeds on a clam, it can't just open the shell easily because clams shut tight. The sea star's solution is to extend its stomach into the clam's shell. Once inside, the stomach releases digestive enzymes to break down the clam's soft tissues. After digestion, the stomach retracts back into the sea star's body, bringing the nutrients with it. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that describes this process. Let's go through each option:

A: Stomach remains inside and absorbs nutrients from water during external digestion. Hmm, no, because I remember the stomach goes out.

B: Stomach extends to capture prey by enveloping the clam. That sounds partly right because the stomach does extend, but does it capture prey or digest it? I think it's more about digestion than capturing.

C: Stomach acts as a pump to open the shell. No, I don't think so. Maybe some other mechanism helps open the shell, but the main function of the stomach is to digest.

D: Filters unwanted particles. Doesn't seem right. The stomach's main role isn't filtering.

E: Grinds the shell. No, the shell is hard, and I think the stomach doesn't grind it. Instead, it digests the soft parts inside.

F: Produces light to distract. That sounds more like something a squid or anglerfish would do, not a sea star.

G: Secretes acid to dissolve the shell. I don't think the stomach dissolves the shell. They probably don't need to dissolve the entire shell, just access the meat inside.

H: Releases electric charges. No, that doesn't fit with what I know about sea stars.

I: Stomach stores food. Well, the stomach does hold the food temporarily while digesting, but storing for later? I'm not sure if that's the primary function described here.

J: Stomach is everted into the shell, releases enzymes, then retracts. Yes, this sounds exactly like what I was thinking. The stomach goes into the shell, digests the clam, and then comes back with the food.

So the correct answer should be option J.

The sea star's stomach plays a crucial role in feeding by extending (everting) into the clam's shell. Once inside, it releases digestive enzymes to break down the clam's soft tissues. After digestion, the stomach retracts back into the sea star's body, bringing the nutrients along. This process allows the sea star to efficiently feed on prey with hard shells without needing to grind or dissolve the shell itself.

Answer: J
