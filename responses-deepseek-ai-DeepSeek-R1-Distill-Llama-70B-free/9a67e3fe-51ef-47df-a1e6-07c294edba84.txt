Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the density function of a sphere when the field vector is independent of the radial distance within it. Oh right, I think this is related to gravitational fields or maybe electric fields, but in this context, it's probably gravitational since it mentions density and G, the gravitational constant.

Wait, the field vector being independent of radial distance... So if the field is uniform inside the sphere, that must mean it's a uniform field. But wait, in a solid sphere, the gravitational field inside actually increases linearly with r, right? Oh wait, no, wait, no. Wait, no, the gravitational field inside a solid sphere of uniform density actually varies with r. Oh, but wait, in this question, the field is independent of r. So that's different. So the field vector doesn't change with r inside the sphere.

So, the gravitational field inside a sphere is usually given by Gauss's law for gravity. For a spherical shell, the field inside is zero, but for a solid sphere of constant density, the field increases linearly from zero at the center to some maximum at the surface. But in this problem, the field is the same everywhere inside. So that's unusual.

Hmm, so let's think about Gauss's law. In Gauss's law for gravity, the flux through a closed surface is proportional to the mass enclosed. So, the gravitational field E (or g) inside a sphere would be determined by the mass enclosed within radius r.

Wait, wait, the usual approach is: for a sphere of radius r, mass M, then inside at a radius r, the enclosed mass is (M/M_total) multiplied by the total mass. Wait, no, wait, the total mass is M. So for a sphere of uniform density, the mass enclosed at radius r is ( (r^3)/(R^3) ) * M, where R is the total radius.

Wait, but in our case, the field inside is uniform, so g(r) is a constant, let's say g0. So the field doesn't depend on r inside. So what's the mass enclosed in a Gaussian surface of radius r?

Gauss's law says that the flux through the Gaussian surface is 4π r² g(r) * 4π? Wait, no, wait. The gravitational flux is the integral of g · dA over the surface. Since the field is uniform and radial, it's g(r) * 4π r². And according to Gauss's law, this equals -4π G M_enclosed, where M_enclosed is the mass inside radius r.

Wait, but I might have the sign wrong. Let me think: in the gravitational case, the flux is negative because the field lines are directed inward. So, the flux is -4π G M_enclosed.

So, setting up the equation: g(r) * 4π r² = -4π G M_enclosed. But wait, since the field is uniform and pointing inward, perhaps we can take the magnitude, so 4π r² g = 4π G M_enclosed. So, M_enclosed = (g r²) / G.

Wait, but M_enclosed is the mass inside radius r. So M(r) = (g r²) / G.

But the density rho(r) is the mass per unit volume. So, the mass M(r) is the integral of rho(r') * 4π r'^2 dr' from 0 to r.

So, M(r) = ∫ (0 to r) rho(r') * 4π r'^2 dr'

But we have M(r) = (g r²) / G.

Let me differentiate both sides with respect to r to find rho(r).

dM/dr = 4π r² rho(r) = (g (2r)) / G.

So, 4π r² rho(r) = (2 g r) / G.

Divide both sides by 4π r²:

rho(r) = (2 g r) / (4 π G r²) ) = (2 g) / (4 π G r) ) = (g) / (2 π G r).

Wait, so rho(r) is proportional to 1/r. But looking at the options, I don't see that exactly. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: C/(4π G) r

B: (1/(4π)) (C)/(G r)

C: (3/(4π)) C/(G r^3)

D: (1/(4π)) C/(G r^2)

E: (1/(2 π)) C/(G r)

F: (1/(3 π)) C/(G r^3)

G: (1/(2 π)) C/(G r^2)

H: C (const)

I: (2/π) C/(G r)

J: (3/(2 π)) C/(G r)

Wait, from my calculation, rho(r) = (g) / (2 π G r). So, that would be (1/(2 π G)) (g / r). But how is g related to C? Because the problem says the field is independent of r, meaning g(r) = C, a constant. So substituting, rho(r) = C/(2 π G r). So that matches option E or I? Wait, option E is (1/(2 π)) (C/(G r)), which is the same as C/(2 π G r). So option E would be rho = C/(2 π G r).

Wait, but let me double-check my differentiation step. M(r) is (g r²)/G.

So dM/dr = (2 g r) / G.

But dM/dr is also 4 π r² rho(r).

So 4 π r² rho(r) = (2 g r)/G.

So solving for rho(r):

rho(r) = (2 g r) / (4 π G r²) ) → 2/(4 π G r) * g → (g) / (2 π G r).

Yes, that's correct. So rho(r) is proportional to 1/r. So looking at the options, that matches option E: (1/(2 π)) (C/(G r)).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the field vector is independent of r. So g(r) = C, a constant. So in our expression, C is g. So rho(r) = C/(2 π G r). So the answer should be option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: For a sphere where the field inside is constant, what's the density? In a uniform sphere, the field increases linearly with r. But here, the field is constant, so the density must vary with r in a way that makes the enclosed mass proportional to r².

Because M_enclosed is (g r²)/G, as I had earlier. So M(r) = k r², where k is g/G. But the density is dM/dr divided by 4π r². So dM/dr is 2k r. So rho(r) = (2k r) / (4 π r²) ) → (2k) / (4 π r) → k/(2 π r).

Substituting back k = g/G, we get rho(r) = (g)/(2 π G r) = C/(2 π G r), assuming C is the constant field. So that's the same as before.

Looking back at the options, option E is (1/(2 π)) (C/(G r)), which is exactly that expression. So option E should be correct.

To determine the density function $\rho(r)$ of a sphere where the field vector is independent of the radial distance $r$ within the sphere, we use Gauss's law for gravity. The gravitational field $g(r)$ inside the sphere is constant, denoted as $C$. According to Gauss's law, the flux through a Gaussian surface of radius $r$ is given by:

\[
g(r) \cdot 4\pi r^2 = 4\pi G M_{\text{enclosed}},
\]

where $M_{\text{enclosed}}$ is the mass enclosed within radius $r$. Since $g(r) = C$ is constant, this simplifies to:

\[
M_{\text{enclosed}} = \frac{C r^2}{G}.
\]

The mass enclosed is also related to the density $\rho(r)$ by:

\[
M_{\text{enclosed}} = \int_0^r \rho(r') \cdot 4\pi r'^2 \, dr'.
\]

Equating the two expressions for $M_{\text{enclosed}}$, we have:

\[
\int_0^r \rho(r') \cdot 4\pi r'^2 \, dr' = \frac{C r^2}{G}.
\]

Differentiating both sides with respect to $r$ gives:

\[
4\pi r^2 \rho(r) = \frac{2C r}{G}.
\]

Solving for $\rho(r)$:

\[
\rho(r) = \frac{2C r}{4\pi G r^2} = \frac{C}{2\pi G r}.
\]

This shows that the density $\rho(r)$ is proportional to $1/r$. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct match is:

\[
\rho(r) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{C}{G r}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E**.
