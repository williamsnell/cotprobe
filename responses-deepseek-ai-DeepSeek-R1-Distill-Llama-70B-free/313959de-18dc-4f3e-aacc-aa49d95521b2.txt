Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about variance in guinea pig coat color. Hmm, I remember that heritability and variance components are involved. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that in a randomly mating strain, the total variance is 0.573. And in an inbred strain, it's 0.340. Oh right, I think the inbred strain variance is due to additive genetic effects only because inbreeding should eliminate dominance and epistatic effects. Because when you inbreed, you're making the population more homozygous, so any dominant or recessive effects would show up, but in an inbred strain, those would be fixed, so the variance from dominance would be minimized, maybe zero? Wait, no, maybe not exactly zero, but perhaps inbred strains have lower non-additive variance.

Wait, the heritability given is 38% of the total variance in the randomly mating population. So the total variance is 0.573, and heritability (which is the proportion of variance due to additive genetic effects) is 0.38 times that. So the additive variance (Va) would be 0.38 * 0.573. Let me calculate that: 0.38 * 0.573. 0.3 * 0.573 is about 0.1719, and 0.08 * 0.573 is 0.04584. So adding them, 0.1719 + 0.04584 is about 0.2177. So approximately 0.218. 

So part (a) is the additive variance, which is about 0.218. Then, part (b) is the variance due to epistasis and dominance. Hmm, total variance is 0.573. In the inbred strain, the variance is 0.340. Wait, I think in an inbred population, the additive variance is what remains because non-additive (dominance and epistasis) variances are minimized. So the inbred variance (0.340) should be approximately equal to the additive variance in the random population. Wait, that makes sense because inbreeding reduces non-additive effects. So if in the inbred strain, the variance is 0.340, that's the additive variance. But wait, earlier I calculated the additive variance as 0.218. That doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I got the concepts mixed up. Let me think again. The total variance in the random population is V_total = V_additive + V_dominance + V_epistasis (maybe). Or perhaps V_total = V_additive (Va) + V_non-additive (Vd + others). And in an inbred population, the non-additive variances (like Vd) are zero, so the variance there is just Va. So if that's the case, the inbred variance is Va = 0.340.

But wait the heritability is given as 38%, which is the proportion of Va over V_total. So heritability h^2 = Va / V_total = 0.38. So Va = 0.38 * 0.573 = 0.21774, which is approximately 0.218. So that's part (a). Then, the inbred variance is 0.340, which is Va. But wait, if Va is 0.218, how can the inbred variance be 0.340? That doesn't add up. Because if Va is 0.218 in the random population, then the inbred should have the same Va, assuming that inbreeding doesn't change allele frequencies (but I think inbreeding affects dominance variance more).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between Va in inbred vs random. Oh, wait, no. If the inbred strain's variance is entirely additive, then Va (in random) should be that, but wait, the heritability is Va / V_total. So if in the inbred strain, the variance is 0.340, which equals Va, then in the random population, Va would be 0.340. But that contradicts the heritability calculation. Because the heritability is given as 0.38, so 0.38 * 0.573 is around 0.218, but if Va is 0.340, then heritability would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593, which is about 59.3%. But the problem states that heritability is 38%. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the inbred variance is not just Va. Wait, maybe the inbred variance is mainly additive, but perhaps some non-additive effects still exist. Or perhaps I'm mixing up things. Let me think again.

In a randomly mating population, the total variance V_total = Va + Vd + Ve (epistasis). In an inbred population, V_inbred = Va + (some fraction of Vd and Ve). Or perhaps V_inbred is just Va, because inbreeding leads to homozygosity, which would make the dominance variance zero. Because dominance variance depends on heterozygosity, which is reduced by inbreeding. So Vd in inbred would be zero, but Va remains. So V_inbred is Va. Therefore, if the inbred variance is 0.340, then Va in the random population is 0.340. But then heritability would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593 or 59.3%, which doesn't match the given 38%. So there's a conflict.

Wait, the heritability is given as 38%, so Va = 0.38 * 0.573 = 0.21774. So part (a) is 0.218. Now, the inbred variance is 0.340, which is equal to Va. But according to that, heritability would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the inbred variance isn't just Va.

Alternative approach: In an inbred population, the non-additive (dominance and epistatic) variances may be zero. So V_inbred = Va. Therefore, Va = 0.340. But then heritability in the random population is Va / V_total = 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593, but the problem says the heritability is 0.38. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the inbred strain's variance is not only Va. Maybe it's Va plus something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the concept. Let me try to outline the formulas.

In the random mating population:
V_total = Va + Vd + Ve

In the inbred population:
V_inbred = Va (if Vd and Ve are zero)

But heritability h^2 = Va / V_total.

Given that, in the inbred, V_inbred = Va. So Va = 0.340.

But then, using heritability h^2 = 0.38, which is Va / V_total = 0.38.

So 0.340 / V_total = 0.38 → V_total = 0.340 / 0.38 ≈ 0.8947. But the problem states that V_total is 0.573, not 0.8947. So this approach is conflicting.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Oh wait, heritability is calculated as the proportion of the total variance in the population. So perhaps the heritability is Va / (Va + Vd + Ve) = 0.38. So Va is part of the total variance.

But then, the inbred variance is Va (assuming Vd and Ve are zero), so if the inbred variance is 0.340, then Va is 0.340. So heritability h^2 would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593. But the problem states it's 0.38. So this can't be correct. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the inbred variance isn't Va. Maybe the inbred variance includes other sources, but I can't think what. Alternatively, perhaps the inbred variance is only the additive variance, but heritability is calculated differently. Maybe the heritability is based on the inbred strain's data?

Wait, the problem says: "the heritability (gene effect) was determined to be 38 percent of the total variance" from the random population. So yes, in the random population, Va is 0.38 * 0.573 = 0.21774.

Then, the inbred strain's variance is 0.340, which I think is the additive variance. So that would mean that in the random population, Va is 0.340? But that contradicts the heritability calculation. Unless the heritability is calculated using the inbred data somehow. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the inbred variance isn't Va. Maybe the inbred variance is the environmental variance. Or perhaps it's the broad-sense heritability that includes all genetic variance, but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the inbred variance is V = Ve (environmental) + Va? No, because in inbreeding, Va may not change, but non-additive variances like Vd decrease. So perhaps the total variance in inbred is less than that in the random population.

Wait, let me try another approach. The problem is asking for:

a) Variance due to gene effect (Va) is 38% of 0.573 → 0.21774 ≈ 0.218.

b) Variance due to epistasis and dominance: this would be Vd + Ve.

So total variance is Va + Vd + Ve = 0.573.

We have Va = 0.218, so Vd + Ve = 0.573 - 0.218 = 0.355.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 0.355 as part (b). Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: a=0.217, b=0.356 → this seems to fit, because 0.217 + 0.356 = 0.573.

But wait, what about the inbred strain's variance of 0.340? How does that factor in? Because the inbred variance is supposed to be Va. But according to this, Va is 0.217, so the inbred variance should be 0.217, but it's given as 0.340. That doesn't make sense.

Hmm, this is confusing. So maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the inbred strain's variance is V = Va + some other component. But if inbreeding reduces non-additive variances, then perhaps V_inbred = Va (since Vd and Ve are zero). So if V_inbred is 0.340, then Va would be 0.340, which would make the heritability h² = 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593. But the problem says h² is 0.38. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the variance in the inbred strain is due to non-additive effects. But that would be the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I'm getting Va and Vd mixed up. Let me think: in the random population, the total variance is Va + Vd + Ve. Heritability is Va / (Va + Vd + Ve) = 0.38.

In the inbred population, the variance is only Va (since Vd and Ve are zero), so V_inbred = Va.

So if V_inbred is 0.340, then Va is 0.340. Then the heritability would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593, which doesn't match. So this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the inbred variance isn't Va. Maybe the inbred variance includes environmental variance as well. But that can't be, because both strains would have the same environmental variance, I think.

Wait, maybe the inbred variance is V = Va + environmental variance (Ve). But that's probably not the case, as Ve is usually considered as part of the total variance. Or perhaps Ve is non-genetic and same in both strains.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the concept that in inbred strains, the variance due to dominance is zero, so the variance is just additive and environmental. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the inbred strain, the additive variance is equal to the inbred variance, and the heritability is calculated as Va/(Va + Vd + Ve). So if the inbred variance is 0.340, that's Va. Then heritability is 0.340 / 0.573 = 0.593, but the problem says it's 0.38. So something's wrong.

Wait, maybe the heritability is calculated differently. Oh, perhaps the heritability is only considering the genetic variance, not the environmental. Or maybe it's narrow-sense heritability, which is Va/(Va + Vd + Ve). And the inbred variance is Va + some other things. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the inbred variance is not Va, but I'm not sure. Maybe the inbred variance is the same as the environmental variance? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the heritability is calculated as the ratio of the inbred variance to the random variance. So h² = V_inbred / V_random. So 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593, which doesn't match the given 0.38. So that can't be it.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem gives:

- Total variance in random: 0.573

- Variance in inbred: 0.340

- Heritability (gene effect) is 38% of total variance.

So heritability is 0.38 * 0.573 = 0.21774, which is part (a): 0.218.

So (a) is 0.218.

Then part (b) is the variance due to epistasis and dominance. So that would be total variance minus Va minus environmental variance. Wait, but I don't know the environmental variance. Alternatively, part (b) is just Vd + Ve, which would be total V - Va = 0.573 - 0.218 = 0.355, which is approximately 0.356. So (a) 0.218, (b) 0.356. Looking at the options, option A is (0.217, 0.356). So that matches.

But wait, how does the inbred variance of 0.340 fit into this? Because earlier I thought that the inbred variance would be Va, but according to this, Va is 0.218, and the inbred variance is 0.340, which is larger than Va. That doesn't make sense because Va should account for part of the variance.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the inbred variance. Maybe the inbred variance is Va plus something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the inbred variance is the same as the environmental variance, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the inbred variance includes only additive variance. So if the random population has Va = 0.218, then the inbred should have the same Va, but their variance is 0.340. That suggests that perhaps Va is 0.340, but then the heritability would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593, but the problem says 0.38. So I'm back to the same problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the inbred variance is not Va, but maybe Vd? No, that doesn't make sense because inbreeding should reduce Vd.

Wait, maybe the inbred variance is the environmental variance. Because in inbred strains, the genetic variance would be lower. But then the environmental variance would be higher? Hmm, I'm not sure.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed with what the problem gives. The heritability is 38%, so part (a) is 0.38 * 0.573 = 0.21774 ≈ 0.218. So (a) is 0.218. Then part (b) is the rest of the variance, which would be 0.573 - 0.218 = 0.355. So (b) is 0.355, which is approximately 0.356. So the correct option would be A: 0.217, 0.356.

But then, what about the inbred variance of 0.340? How does that fit in? Because according to this, the additive variance is 0.218, which is less than the inbred variance. That doesn't align with the expectation that inbred variance equals Va. So perhaps the inbred variance being 0.340 is Va. But then heritability would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593, which contradicts the given 0.38. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the heritability is calculated differently. Maybe heritability is the ratio of the inbred variance to the random variance. So 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593, that's about 59.3%, but the problem states it's 38%. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the inbred variance is the dominance variance. No, that doesn't make sense because inbreeding reduces dominance variance.

Alternatively, perhaps the inbred variance is the same as the additive variance. So Va is 0.340. Then heritability would be 0.340 / 0.573 ≈ 0.593. But the problem says heritability is 0.38. So this can't be correct.

I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should proceed with the initial calculation and assume that the inbred data isn't needed for this particular question. So part (a) is 0.218, part (b) is 0.355, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given data and calculate the variance components based on the principles of heritability and genetic variance.

### Given Data:
1. **Total variance in the randomly mating population**: \( V_{\text{total}} = 0.573 \).
2. **Variance in the inbred strain**: \( V_{\text{inbred}} = 0.340 \).
3. **Heritability (proportion of total variance due to additive genetic effects)**: \( h^2 = 0.38 \).

### Key Concepts:
- **Heritability (\( h^2 \))**: Represents the proportion
