Okay, so I've got this question about simple foragers and complex foragers. Hmm, I remember from my classes that foraging societies are a type of subsistence strategy, but the differences between simple and complex ones are a bit fuzzy to me. Let me think.

Wait, simple foragers are usually the basic type, right? They probably have less complex social structures and maybe more mobility. They likely gather a variety of food sources, like plants, fruits, nuts, and maybe hunt small game. Their tools might be more basic, not too specialized.

Complex foragers, on the other hand, probably have more advanced strategies. Maybe they focus on certain high-yield resources, which allows them to settle in one area longer, leading to more complex social structures. I think they might have more specialized tools, maybe even some form of storage for food. Oh, and perhaps they rely on more abundant resources, like fish or certain types of plants that are more productive.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Simple foragers employ domestication of animals. Wait, domestication is more like agriculture, right? So simple foragers wouldn't do that. They're gatherers, not herders.

Option B: Complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources. That sounds right. If they're more complex, maybe they target resources that provide more food with less effort, allowing for population growth or more settled life.

Option C: Complex foragers employ irrigation. Irrigation is more of an agricultural technology, like in farming societies, not foragers. So probably not this one.

Option D: Simple foragers use advanced hunting techniques. I thought simple foragers have basic tools. Advanced techniques might be more for complex foragers, but I'm not sure. Maybe not.

Option E: Complex foragers rely primarily on marine resources. Marine resources are a specific case, like in coastal areas. Not sure if this is a defining difference. Maybe some do, but not all.

Option F: Complex foragers have less developed tools. No, that doesn't make sense. More complex societies usually have more developed tools. So this is probably wrong.

Option G: Simple foragers have more developed agricultural systems. No, because foragers don't do agriculture. That's more like horticulturalists or farmers.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be B: Complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources. That makes sense because they can exploit abundant resources efficiently, which supports more complex social structures.

The question asks about the differences between simple foragers and complex foragers. Simple foragers are typically characterized by their basic tools, mobility, and reliance on a variety of food sources like plants, fruits, and small game. In contrast, complex foragers often exhibit more advanced strategies, such as focusing on high-yield resources, which allows for greater sedentism and more complex social structures.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Domestication of animals is associated with pastoralism, not foraging societies.
- **B**: Correct. Complex foragers often target a few highly productive resources, enabling them to support larger populations and more complex societies.
- **C**: Incorrect. Irrigation is an agricultural technology, not typical of foraging societies.
- **D**: Incorrect. While simple foragers hunt, the term "advanced hunting techniques" aligns more with complex foragers.
- **E**: Incorrect. While some complex foragers may rely on marine resources, this is not a universal defining feature.
- **F**: Incorrect. Complex foragers generally have more developed tools, not less.
- **G**: Incorrect. Simple foragers do not practice agriculture.

Thus, the defining difference is that complex foragers focus on a few highly productive resources.
