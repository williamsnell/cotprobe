Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about religious organizations. The question is asking which characteristic is common among the Church of Norway, Islam, the Church of England, and the Church of Greece. The options are from A to J. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll list out each organization to get a clear picture. The Church of Norway is a Protestant church, I think, part of the Lutheran tradition. Islam is a major world religion, with followers called Muslims. The Church of England is Anglican, which is also Protestant but has some similarities with Catholicism. The Church of Greece is the Greek Orthodox Church, part of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.

Now, I need to find a common characteristic among all four. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: They are primarily based in Europe. Well, the Church of Norway is in Norway, Church of England in England, Church of Greece in Greece, but Islam is a global religion with a significant presence in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. So not all are primarily based in Europe. So A is out.

Option B: They are monotheistic. Monotheism is the belief in one god. The Church of Norway, England, and Greece are all Christian denominations which are monotheistic. Islam is also monotheistic, believing in one God (Allah). So B seems like a possible answer.

Option C: They all practice infant baptism. Let's think. The Church of Norway (Lutheran) does infant baptism. The Church of England (Anglican) also practices infant baptism. The Greek Orthodox Church definitely does infant baptism, including through immersion. But what about Islam? I'm not sure. I think in Islam, there's no exact equivalent of baptism. Instead, they have a naming ceremony and sometimes a ritual called Tahnik, but it's not the same as baptism. So C might not be correct because Islam doesn't practice infant baptism in the same way.

Option D: They all have a hierarchical church structure. Let's see. The Church of Norway has bishops, so it's hierarchical. Church of England has bishops too. The Greek Orthodox has a strong hierarchy with patriarchs and bishops. What about Islam? Islam doesn't have a centralized hierarchical structure like churches do. It has leaders like imams and caliphs historically, but it's more decentralized. So D might not apply to all four.

Option E: They are cultures as well as churches. Hmm, that's a bit vague. Churches are part of the culture in their countries, but does that apply to all four? The Church of Norway is deeply rooted in Norwegian culture, same with the Church of England and Greek Orthodox. But Islam is a religion with a vast cultural influence across many countries, but it's not a church in the same sense. Maybe E isn't the best fit.

Option F: They believe in reincarnation. Definitely not. Christianity and Islam both do not believe in reincarnation. So F is wrong.

Option G: They all observe the Sabbath on Saturday. No, that's not right. The Sabbath for Jews is Saturday, but Christians typically observe Sunday as the day of rest. So the churches mentioned here (Norway, England, Greece) keep Sunday. Islam's holy day is Friday, but they don't call it the Sabbath. So G is incorrect.

Option H: They prohibit the use of religious icons. No, actually, the Greek Orthodox Church uses icons extensively. The Church of England may not use as many as Catholics, but they might have some. The Church of Norway, being Lutheran, might be more minimalist. But Islam prohibits Icons (as in images of God or prophets), but the question is about the churches. So this doesn't apply across all four. So H is out.

Option I: They practice separation of church and state. Let's see. The Church of Norway is the state church, so they don't separate. Church of England is also the established church, so no separation. Greek Orthodox is the state church in Greece. Islam, in some countries, is the state religion, but others have separation. So I isn't common to all four.

Option J: They exclude women as clergy. Not all. The Church of England now allows women priests and bishops. The Church of Norway has women clergy. Greek Orthodox does not ordain women, I think. Islam varies, but generally, women are not imams in most traditions. So J doesn't apply to all because some of these churches do include women as clergy.

So going back, the options that could be common are B and D. Wait, let me think again. For D, I thought Islam doesn't have a hierarchical structure like the churches. But in reality, some Islamic countries have a more structured hierarchy, but it's not universal across all of Islam. So D might not apply.

So the only option that seems to fit all four is B: They are monotheistic. All four are monotheistic religions. So the answer should be B.

The question asks which characteristic is common among the Church of Norway, Islam, the Church of England, and the Church of Greece. Here's the analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Not all are primarily based in Europe (e.g., Islam is global).  
- **Option B**: All four are monotheistic (believing in one God).  
- **Option C**: Islam does not practice infant baptism like the Christian churches.  
- **Option D**: Islam lacks a centralized hierarchical structure like the Christian churches.  
- **Option E**: While churches are part of cultures, this is too vague and not a defining characteristic.  
- **Option F**: None of these religions believe in reincarnation.  
- **Option G**: These religions observe different holy days (e.g., Sunday for Christians, Friday for Islam).  
- **Option H**: Islam prohibits religious icons, but the Christian churches do not.  
- **Option I**: Some of these religions are state churches, so they do not practice separation of church and state.  
- **Option J**: Some Christian churches include women as clergy, so this is not universal.  

The only characteristic common to all four is that they are monotheistic. 

Answer: B
