Okay, so I've got this question about fiscal policies and inflationary gaps. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's start by recalling what an inflationary gap is. From what I remember, an inflationary gap occurs when the overall level of economic activity is above the potential GDP, leading to inflation. So, when there's too much demand chasing limited goods and services, prices go up.

Fiscal policy has two main tools: government spending and taxation. The government can either expand or contract the economy using these. When the economy is overheating, like in an inflationary gap, the goal is to reduce demand. So, the fiscal policy should aim to contract the economy, right?

Let me think about how each tool affects the economy. If the government increases taxes, people have less disposable income, so they spend less. That would decrease demand. Similarly, if the government decreases its own spending, that directly reduces demand because the government is buying fewer goods and services.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one where either taxes increase, spending decreases, or both. Let's go through the options:

A: Decreases both taxes and spending. Wait, cutting taxes would increase demand, which is the opposite of what we want. So this would probably make the inflation worse. So A is probably not correct.

B: Keeps both unchanged. That wouldn't do anything to address the inflation, so B isn't right.

C: Increases spending and keeps taxes same. Increasing spending would add more demand, which is bad when there's already an inflationary gap. So C is not good.

D: Increases spending with increased taxes. Hmm, so spending up and taxes up. I'm not sure. If both increase by the same amount, maybe it's a balanced approach, but I think the effect depends on which has a bigger impact. But generally, raising taxes would reduce demand, but increasing spending would add to it. So maybe it's a wash, but perhaps the net effect isn't contractionary enough. Not sure if this is the best option.

E: Decreases taxes and increases spending. Both of these would stimulate the economy more, which is bad in an inflationary situation. So E is definitely not the answer.

F: Increases taxes and decreases spending. Oh, this seems right. Both actions would reduce aggregate demand. Higher taxes mean people have less to spend, and lower government spending directly reduces demand. That should help cool down the economy when it's overheating.

G: Increases both taxes and spending. Similar to D. So taxes up and spending up. The effect might not be as contractionary as needed because the spending increase could offset the tax increase. So maybe not the best choice compared to F.

H: Decreases taxes, spending unchanged. Lower taxes would increase demand, which is bad. So H is not helpful.

I: Decreases spending, taxes unchanged. That would reduce demand since government buys less. But leaving taxes alone means people's disposable income isn't affected. So this could help, but maybe not as much as F, where both taxes go up and spending goes down.

J: Keeps spending same, decreases taxes. Again, lower taxes would boost demand, which is the opposite of what's needed.

So the options that involve increasing taxes and/or decreasing spending are F and I. Since the question asks for the most effective, I think combining both approaches (taxes up and spending down) would have a more significant impact than just one of them. So F seems like the correct choice.

When an economy experiences an inflationary gap, the goal of fiscal policy is to reduce aggregate demand and cool down the economy. This can be achieved by increasing taxes (which reduces disposable income and consumer spending) and decreasing government spending (which directly reduces demand). 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Decreasing both taxes and spending would likely worsen the inflationary gap, as lower taxes increase demand.  
- **B**: Keeping taxes and spending unchanged would not address the inflationary gap.  
- **C**: Increasing spending while keeping taxes unchanged would add to demand, exacerbating inflation.  
- **D**: Increasing both spending and taxes might offset each other, but it is less effective than directly reducing demand.  
- **E**: Decreasing taxes and increasing spending would stimulate the economy further, worsening inflation.  
- **F**: Increasing taxes and decreasing spending is the most effective approach, as both actions reduce demand and help combat inflation.  
- **G**: Increasing both taxes and spending is less effective than F, as the spending increase could offset the tax increase.  
- **H**: Decreasing taxes while keeping spending unchanged would increase demand, worsening inflation.  
- **I**: Decreasing spending while keeping taxes unchanged would reduce demand, but not as effectively as F.  
- **J**: Keeping spending unchanged and decreasing taxes would increase demand, worsening inflation.  

The most effective policy is **F**, as it combines higher taxes and lower spending to significantly reduce aggregate demand and address the inflationary gap.

Answer: F
