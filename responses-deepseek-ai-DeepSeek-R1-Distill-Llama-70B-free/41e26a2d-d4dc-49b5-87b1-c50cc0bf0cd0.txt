Okay, so I've got this problem here about writing a number in expanded form. The number given is eighteen thousand ninety-six, and I need to figure out which option correctly represents it in expanded form. Hmm, expanded form is when you break down the number into each digit multiplied by its place value, right? Like, each part is added together.

First, I think I should break down the number 18,096 step by step. Let's see, starting from the largest place value to the smallest. So, the first digit is 1, which is in the ten thousands place? Wait, no wait, wait. Wait, in the number 18,096, how is it structured?

Wait, 18,096 is eighteen thousand and ninety-six. So that's 18,000 plus 96. But I think I need to break it down more precisely. Let me think about each digit and its place.

So, the number is 18,096. Let me write it out: 1 8 0 9 6. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Let me count the digits properly. In 18,096, the digits are 1, 8, 0, 9, 6. But wait, no, that's five digits. Wait, no, 18,096 is written as 1 8 0 9 6? Or is it 1 8,0 9 6? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 1 ten thousand, 8 thousands, 0 hundreds, 9 tens, and 6 ones. Oh wait, that makes sense.

So expanded form would be: 10,000 (for the 1 in ten thousands place) plus 8,000 (for the 8 in thousands place) plus 0 hundreds (but since it's zero, we can skip that) plus 90 (for the 9 in tens place) plus 6 (for the 6 in ones place). So putting it all together, it's 10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6.

Wait, let me double-check that. So 10,000 is 1*10,000, 8,000 is 8*1,000, 0 is 0*100, 9 is 9*10, and 6 is 6*1. So yeah, adding those up gives 18,096.

Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this. Let's go through them:

Option A: 10,000 + 8,000 + 900 + 60. Hmm, that adds up to 10k +8k=18k, plus 900 is 18,900, plus 60 is 18,960. That's not 18,096, so A is wrong.

Option B: 10,000 + 8,000 + 900 +6. 10k+8k=18k, +900 is 18,900, +6 is 18,906. Not matching, so B is incorrect.

Option C: 10,000 +7,000 +100 +96. 10k+7k=17k, +100=17,100 +96=17,196. Not 18,096, so C is wrong.

Option D: 18 +1,000 +900 +60. Let's calculate: 18+1k=1,018, +900=1,918, +60=1,978. That's way too low, so D is out.

Option E:18,000 +90 +6. 18k +90 is 18,090 +6=18,096. Oh wait, that's exactly the number. So E seems correct. But wait, I thought the expanded form included all the digits, including the zero. But wait, in expanded form, do we include the zero place values?

Wait, in expanded form, each digit is written as its value times the place value. So for the hundreds place, it's 0, so 0*100, which is zero. So technically, including it would add a zero, but in practice, we don't write terms with zero. So the expanded form would be 10,000 + 8,000 + 0 + 90 +6, but since 0 doesn't affect the sum, it's omitted. So the correct expanded form would be 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6. Oh wait, but looking at the options, option E is 18,000 +90 +6. Which is 18,096. So that's correct as well.

Wait, but waitâ€”I thought 18,000 is 10,000 +8,000, right? So 18,000 is just a shortcut for 10k+8k. So option E is combining those two into 18,000, which is acceptable because it's a single term. So both forms are correct, but the more detailed expanded form would break it down into 10k and 8k separately.

Wait, but the question is about expanded form. Let me think again. Expanded form typically breaks each digit into its place value, so 1*10,000 +8*1,000 +0*100 +9*10 +6*1. So that would be 10,000 +8,000 +0 +90 +6. But when written without the zero, it's 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6.

Looking back at the options, which one matches that? Option F is 10,000 +8,000 +90 +6. That's exactly what I have. So F would be correct. But wait, earlier I thought E was correct because it's 18,000 +90 +6, which is the same number, but is that considered expanded form?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. What's the correct way to write it in expanded form? Let me think. Expanded form is when each digit is expressed by its place value, so 18,000 is written as 10,000 +8,000, right? So option F is the correct expanded form because it breaks down each digit beyond the thousands. Option E groups the ten thousands and thousands into a single term (18,000), which is a larger chunk. So the more precise expanded form is option F.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The number is 18,096.

Breaking it down:

- The first digit is 1 in the ten thousands place: 1 *10,000 =10,000
- The second digit is 8 in the thousands place:8*1,000=8,000
- The third digit is 0 in the hundreds place:0*100=0 (we can ignore this)
- The fourth digit is9 in the tens place:9*10=90
- The fifth digit is6 in the ones place:6*1=6

So adding all the non-zero parts:10,000 +8,000 +90 +6. Which matches option F.

Option E is 18,000 +90 +6. But 18,000 itself is 10,000 +8,000, so option E is a less detailed expanded form. So the correct expanded form is option F.

So looking back at the options, the correct answer is F.

To determine the expanded form of the number 18,096, we break it down by each digit's place value:

- The first digit (1) is in the ten thousands place: \(1 \times 10,000 = 10,000\).
- The second digit (8) is in the thousands place: \(8 \times 1,000 = 8,000\).
- The third digit (0) is in the hundreds place: \(0 \times 100 = 0\) (this term is omitted in expanded form).
- The fourth digit (9) is in the tens place: \(9 \times 10 = 90\).
- The fifth digit (6) is in the ones place: \(6 \times 1 = 6\).

Adding these together, the expanded form is:

\[
10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6
\]

Now, we compare this to the given options:

- **Option A**: \(10,000 + 8,000 + 900 + 60\) equals 18,960, which is incorrect.
- **Option B**: \(10,000 + 8,000 + 900 + 6\) equals 18,906, which is incorrect.
- **Option C**: \(10,000 + 7,000 + 100 + 96\) equals 17,196, which is incorrect.
- **Option D**: \(18 + 1,000 + 900 + 60\) equals 1,978, which is incorrect.
- **Option E**: \(18,000 + 90 + 6\) equals 18,096, but this groups \(10,000 + 8,000\) into a single term (\(18,000\)), making it less detailed.
- **Option F**: \(10,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6\) matches the expanded form derived above.
- **Option G**: \(18 + 1,000 + 90 + 6\) equals 1,114, which is incorrect.
- **Option H**: \(1,000 + 8,000 + 90 + 6\) equals 9,096, which is incorrect.
- **Option I**: \(10,000 + 8,000 + 100 + 6\) equals 18,106, which is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option F**, as it accurately represents the expanded form of 18,096.
