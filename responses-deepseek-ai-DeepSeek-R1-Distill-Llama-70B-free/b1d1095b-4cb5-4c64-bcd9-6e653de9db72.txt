Okay, so I've got this question about a steam engine's efficiency. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the engine is operated reversibly between two heat reservoirs. One is the primary, and the other is secondary at 35°C. I need to find the efficiency. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Wait, wait. I remember that the efficiency of a heat engine depends on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs. Oh right, the formula for maximum efficiency is the Carnot efficiency. The formula is (1 - T_cold / T_hot), where the temperatures are in Kelvin.

But wait, the question doesn't give the temperature of the primary reservoir. Oh, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the primary reservoir is probably the hot one, but the question doesn't state its temperature. Hmm, that's confusing. Without knowing the hot reservoir's temperature, I can't compute this.

Wait, wait, maybe the primary reservoir is at a different temperature, perhaps it's the one at 100°C or something else? Oh wait, the question doesn't say. Wait, the only temperature given is 35°C for the secondary reservoir. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because I need both temperatures.

Wait another thought—maybe the primary reservoir is at 100°C, which is the standard boiling point of water. But I'm not sure if that's a correct assumption. Or perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again.

The question says it's operated between two reservoirs: a primary and a secondary. The secondary is at 35°C. So the primary must be hotter than that. I need to know its temperature to calculate efficiency. But the question doesn't provide it. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the primary reservoir is at the ambient temperature, like 25°C? Or maybe the question assumes the hot reservoir is at 100°C, considering it's a steam engine. Steam engines typically use boiling water, so 100°C makes sense. Let's go with that assumption.

So primary (hot) reservoir T_hot = 100°C, which is 373 K (since 100 + 273 = 373). The secondary (cold) reservoir is 35°C, which is 308 K (35 + 273 = 308).

Using the Carnot efficiency formula: efficiency = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot)
So that's 1 - (308 / 373) = let's calculate that.

308 divided by 373. Let me do the division. 308 ÷ 373. Hmm, 373 goes into 308 zero times. So 0. Let's see:

373 × 0.8 is 298.4 (because 373 * 0.8 = 298.4). 308 - 298.4 is 9.6. So 0.8 + (9.6/373). 9.6/373 is approximately 0.02575. So total is about 0.82575.

Wait, no, wait. Because 1 - (308/373) = (373 - 308)/373 = 65 / 373. Let me compute that.

65 ÷ 373. Let's see, 373 × 0.17 is 63.41, because 0.1 is 37.3, 0.07 is 26.11, so 37.3 + 26.11 = 63.41. 65 - 63.41 is 1.59. So 0.17 + (1.59/373). 1.59/373 is roughly 0.00426. So total is approximately 0.17426, or 17.4%.

Looking at the options, option B is 17.4%. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but what if the primary reservoir isn't at 100°C? Oh, but the question doesn't give its temperature. Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Did I miss any given data?

Wait, the question says it's a steam engine. So the hot reservoir is likely where the steam is produced, like a boiler. So that would be at 100°C, that's a common assumption. So I think my calculation is correct. So the efficiency is about 17.4%, which is option B.

To determine the efficiency of the steam engine, we use the Carnot efficiency formula:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = 1 - \frac{T_{\text{cold}}}{T_{\text{hot}}}
\]

where \( T_{\text{cold}} \) and \( T_{\text{hot}} \) are the absolute temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively, in Kelvin.

The problem specifies that the secondary (cold) reservoir is at \( 35^\circ \text{C} \), which converts to:

\[
T_{\text{cold}} = 35 + 273 = 308 \, \text{K}
\]

The primary (hot) reservoir temperature is not explicitly given. However, since the engine is a steam engine, it is reasonable to assume the hot reservoir is at the boiling point of water, \( 100^\circ \text{C} \), which converts to:

\[
T_{\text{hot}} = 100 + 273 = 373 \, \text{K}
\]

Substituting these values into the Carnot efficiency formula:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = 1 - \frac{T_{\text{cold}}}{T_{\text{hot}}} = 1 - \frac{308}{373}
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{308}{373} \):

\[
\frac{308}{373} \approx 0.82575
\]

Then:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = 1 - 0.82575 = 0.17425 \, \text{or approximately} \, 17.4\%
\]

Thus, the efficiency of the engine is approximately **17.4%**, which corresponds to option **B**.
