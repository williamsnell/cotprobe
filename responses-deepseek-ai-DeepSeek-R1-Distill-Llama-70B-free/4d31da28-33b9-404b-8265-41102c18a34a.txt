Okay, so I've got this economics question here about aggregate demand curves. Hmm, I remember that aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an economy. The question is asking which option could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. Shifting left means a decrease in aggregate demand, right?

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: An increase in government spending. Wait, government spending is part of fiscal policy. If the government spends more, that's expansionary, which should increase aggregate demand. So that would shift the curve to the right, not left. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: A decrease in interest rates. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, so people might spend more. That would increase AD, shifting the curve right. So B isn't the answer either.

Option C: Contractionary demand management policies. Oh, contractionary policies are meant to reduce demand. Like if the government raises taxes or cuts spending, that would decrease AD. So this could shift the curve left. So C is a possible correct answer.

Option D: An increase in consumer confidence. When people are more confident, they spend more. Higher spending means higher AD, so the curve shifts right. So D isn't the cause for a left shift.

Option E: An increase in the money supply. More money in circulation usually leads to more spending. That would increase AD, so E is out.

Option F: Expansionary demand management policies. These are meant to increase AD, so they shift the curve right. So F isn't the answer.

Option G: A decrease in taxes. Lower taxes mean people have more disposable income, so they spend more, increasing AD. So G isn't the right choice.

Option H: A decrease in the unemployment rate. If unemployment is down, more people are working and have income to spend. That would increase AD, shifting the curve right. So H isn't it.

Option I: Expansionary fiscal policies. These involve increasing government spending or cutting taxes to boost AD. So this would shift the curve right, not left. So I isn't the answer.

Option J: An increase in exports. Exports are part of net exports. If exports increase, that would boost AD, shifting the curve to the right. So J isn't the correct choice.

Wait, so the only option that fits a left shift is option C: contractionary demand management policies. Because those policies are meant to reduce overall demand, shifting the curve left.

The aggregate demand curve shifts to the left when there is a decrease in aggregate demand. To determine which option causes this, let's analyze each choice:

- **A**: An increase in government spending would increase aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **B**: A decrease in interest rates would make borrowing cheaper, increasing spending and shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **C**: Contractionary demand management policies aim to reduce demand, such as raising taxes or cutting spending, which would shift the curve to the left. Correct.  
- **D**: An increase in consumer confidence would lead to higher spending, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **E**: An increase in the money supply would likely increase spending, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **F**: Expansionary demand management policies are designed to increase demand, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **G**: A decrease in taxes would increase disposable income and spending, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **H**: A decrease in the unemployment rate would increase income and spending, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **I**: Expansionary fiscal policies, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, would increase demand, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  
- **J**: An increase in exports would boost aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the right. Not correct.  

The only option that causes the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left is **C: Contractionary demand management policies**.  

Answer: C
