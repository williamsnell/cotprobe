Okay, so I have this finance problem here about calculating the fair value of a stock using the dividend discount model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that CheckMate forecasts its dividend will grow at 20% per year for the next four years, and then it'll settle down to a constant 8% forever. The current dividend (in 2016) is $12, and the expected rate of return is 15%. I need to find the fair value of the stock now.

Wait, the fair value is the present value of all future dividends, right? So I'll probably have to calculate the dividends for the next four years and then find the terminal value from year four onwards.

Let me break it down. The current dividend is D0 = $12. It grows at 20% for four years, so each year's dividend will be D0*(1+g)^n, where g is 20% or 0.2, and n is the year.

So for each year:
- Year 1 (2017): D1 = 12 * 1.2 = $14.4
- Year 2 (2018): D2 = 14.4 * 1.2 = $17.28
- Year 3 (2019): D3 = 17.28 * 1.2 = $20.736
- Year 4 (2020): D4 = 20.736 * 1.2 = $24.8832

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, since the current year is 2016, the next dividend is D1 in 2017. So yes, that's correct.

Then, from year 4 onwards (starting in 2021), the dividend will grow at a constant 8% forever. So the dividend in 2021 (D5) would be D4 * (1 + 0.08) = 24.8832 * 1.08. Let me calculate that: 24.8832 * 1.08. Hmm, 24.8832 * 1 is 24.8832, plus 24.8832 * 0.08 which is about 1.9906. So D5 is approximately 26.8738.

Now, to find the stock price today, I need to discount all these dividends plus the terminal value. The terminal value at the end of year 4 is the value of all dividends from year 5 to infinity. I can use the Gordon Growth Model (constant dividend growth model) for that.

The formula for the terminal value (P4) is D5 / (r - g), where r is the required rate of return (15% or 0.15) and g is the constant growth rate (8% or 0.08). So P4 = D5 / (0.15 - 0.08) = D5 / 0.07.

Let me compute that. D5 is approximately 26.8738. So P4 = 26.8738 / 0.07. Let me calculate that: 26.8738 divided by 0.07. 26.8738 / 0.07 = approx 383.976. Let me double-check that division. 0.07 times 380 is 26.6, so 0.07*384 = 26.88, so yes, it's about 384.

So now, the value of the stock today is the present value of D1, D2, D3, D4, and P4, all discounted at 15%.

I'll list them out:

- D1 = $14.4, discounted for 1 year: 14.4 / (1.15)^1
- D2 = $17.28, discounted for 2 years: 17.28 / (1.15)^2
- D3 = $20.736, discounted for 3 years: 20.736 / (1.15)^3
- D4 = $24.8832, discounted for 4 years: 24.8832 / (1.15)^4
- P4 = $384, discounted for 4 years: 384 / (1.15)^4

I'll calculate each term step by step.

First, let's compute the denominators:

(1.15)^1 = 1.15
(1.15)^2 = 1.3225
(1.15)^3 = 1.520875
(1.15)^4 = 1.74900625

Now, each present value:

PV of D1: 14.4 / 1.15 = approx 12.5217

PV of D2: 17.28 / 1.3225 ≈ Let's see, 17.28 ÷ 1.3225. Let me compute that.

1.3225 * 13 = 17.1925, which is close to 17.28. So 13.0 + (17.28 -17.1925)/1.3225. The difference is about 0.0875. 0.0875 /1.3225 ≈ 0.066. So total approx 13.066.

Alternatively, using calculator steps: 17.28 divided by 1.3225.

Well, 1.3225 * 13 = 17.1925, which is less than 17.28. So 13.0 + (0.0875)/1.3225.

0.0875 /1.3225 ≈ 0.066. So approx 13.066.

PV of D3: 20.736 / 1.520875 ≈ Let's compute.

1.520875 * 13.6 = ?

Wait, 1.520875 * 13 = 19.771, which is less than 20.736. Let's try 13.6.

1.520875 * 13.6 = 1.520875 * 13 + 1.520875 * 0.6 = 19.771 + 0.912525 = 20.683525. Close to 20.736. The difference is about 20.736 -20.683525 = 0.052475.

So, 13.6 + (0.052475 / 1.520875) ≈ 13.6 + ~0.0345 ≈ 13.6345.

So approx 13.6345.

PV of D4: 24.8832 / 1.74900625 ≈ Let's compute.

1.74900625 * 14.2 = ?

Wait, let me compute 24.8832 / 1.74900625.

Divide 24.8832 by 1.74900625.

Let me see, 1.749 * 14 = 24.486. So 14 gives us 24.486, which is less than 24.8832. The difference is about 0.3972.

So 0.3972 /1.749 ≈ 0.227. So total PV is approx 14.227.

Wait, that's an approximate way. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

But I think I'll proceed, perhaps a better way is to compute each precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write them as:

D1: 14.4 / 1.15 = let's compute exactly. 14.4 ÷1.15. 1.15 *12=13.8, 14.4-13.8=0.6. 0.6/1.15= approx 0.5217. So 12.5217.

D2: 17.28 / (1.15)^2 = 17.28 / 1.3225. Let's compute this accurately.

1.3225 * 13 = 17.1925. So 13.0 gives 17.1925. The difference is 17.28-17.1925=0.0875.

So 0.0875 /1.3225 = approx 0.066. So total PV is 13.066.

Similarly, D3: 20.736 / (1.15)^3 = 20.736 /1.520875.

1.520875 *13=19.771, which is 0.965 less than 20.736.

Wait, 1.520875 *13.6 = 13 *1.520875 =19.771, plus 0.6*1.520875=0.912525. So 19.771 +0.912525=20.683525.

So 13.6 gives us 20.683525. The difference is 20.736-20.683525=0.052475.

So 0.052475 /1.520875 ≈ 0.0345. So PV is 13.6 + 0.0345≈13.6345.

D4: 24.8832 / (1.15)^4 =24.8832 /1.74900625.

Let me compute 1.74900625 *14=24.486. So 24.486. The difference is 24.8832-24.486=0.3972.

So 0.3972 /1.74900625≈0.3972 /1.749 ≈0.227. So total PV is 14.227.

Now, the terminal value P4 is 384 /1.74900625.

Let me compute that. 1.74900625 * 219 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps compute 384 ÷1.74900625.

Another approach: 1.74900625 is approximately 1.749.

Compute 384 ÷1.749.

Well, 1.749 * 219 = ?

Wait, let me compute 1.749 * 219:

1.749 * 200 = 349.8

1.749 *19 = 33.231

Total 349.8 +33.231=383.031. So 1.749 *219=383.031. But we have 384 as numerator, so 219 gives us 383.031. The difference is 0.969.

So 0.969 /1.749 ≈0.554. So 219 +0.554≈219.554.

So P4's PV is approximately 219.554.

Now, summing up all these present values:

PV = D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 + P4

Which is approximately:

12.5217 +13.066 +13.6345 +14.227 +219.554

Let me add them step by step.

12.5217 +13.066 =25.5877

25.5877 +13.6345 =39.2222

39.2222 +14.227=53.4492

53.4492 +219.554=272.0032 approximately.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes approximations can lead to errors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each term more precisely.

Let me recompute each PV with more precision.

D1: 14.4 /1.15 = ?

14.4 ÷1.15. Let's compute: 1.15 × 12.52 = 14.4.

Yes, because 1.15 ×12 =13.8, 1.15 ×0.52=0.598. Sum is 13.8+0.598=14.398, which is very close to 14.4. So D1 PV is 12.5217.

D2: 17.28 /1.3225.

Let me compute 17.28 ÷1.3225.

1.3225 ×13.066 ≈17.28. Let me do it step by step.

13 ×1.3225=17.1925. 0.066 ×1.3225=0.087215.

So 17.1925 +0.087215=17.2797, which is almost 17.28. So D2 PV is 13.066.

D3: 20.736 ÷1.520875.

We can compute that as 20.736 ÷1.520875.

Let me compute 1.520875 ×13.6345=?

Wait, perhaps let me compute 20.736 ÷1.520875.

Compute 1.520875 ×13.63 = ?

1.520875 ×13=19.771.

1.520875 ×0.63=0.9569 (because 1.520875 ×0.6=0.912525; 1.520875 ×0.03=0.045626; sum is 0.912525+0.045626=0.958151).

So 19.771 +0.958151=20.72915. Which is very close to 20.736. So the PV is approximately 13.63.

Wait, but 1.520875 ×13.63=20.72915, which is a bit less than 20.736. The difference is 20.736 -20.72915=0.00685.

So 0.00685 /1.520875≈0.0045.

So the PV is 13.63 +0.0045≈13.6345.

D4:24.8832 ÷1.74900625.

Compute 1.74900625 ×14.227=?

1.74900625 ×14=24.486.

1.74900625 ×0.227= approx 0.3972.

24.486 +0.3972=24.8832. So yes, 14.227.

P4: 384 ÷1.74900625.

Wait, 1.74900625 ×219.554=384.

Yes, because 1.74900625 ×219=383.031, and as I calculated earlier, 219.554 gives us 384.

So P4 PV is approximately 219.554.

Now, adding them all:

12.5217 (D1) +13.066 (D2) =25.5877

+13.6345 (D3) → 25.5877 +13.6345=39.2222

+14.227 (D4) →39.2222 +14.227=53.4492

+219.554 (P4) →53.4492 +219.554=272.0032.

So the total present value is approximately $272.00.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

A: 280.0

B:305.0

C:290.0

D:250.0

E:320.0

F:273.0

G:260.0

H:315.0

I:300.0

J:265.0

So the closest one is F:273.0, which is a bit higher than my calculation of 272.003. Hmm, but perhaps I made some rounding errors. Let me double-check the calculations with more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each term with more precision.

Let me recalculate each term more accurately.

Calculating each PV precisely:

D1: 14.4 / 1.15 = 12.52173913

D2:17.28 / (1.15)^2 =17.28 /1.3225 =13.0661157

D3:20.736 / (1.15)^3 =20.736 /1.520875 =13.6349206

D4:24.8832 / (1.15)^4 =24.8832 /1.74900625 ≈14.2273401

P4:384 /1.74900625 =219.553387

Now, sum them all:

12.52173913 +13.0661157 =25.5878548

+13.6349206 =39.2227754

+14.2273401=53.4501155

+219.553387=272.0035025.

So the total is approximately $272.00.

Looking at the options, F is 273.0, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating D5. Let me recheck D5.

Wait, D4 is 24.8832, which is after 4 years. Then D5 is D4 *1.08 =24.8832 *1.08.

Let me compute that accurately.

24.8832 *1.08:

24.8832 * 1 =24.8832

24.8832 *0.08=1.990656

So D5 =24.8832 +1.990656 =26.873856.

So P4 = D5 / (r - g) =26.873856 / (0.15 -0.08) =26.873856 / 0.07.

Compute that: 26.873856 /0.07 = 383.91240857.

Wait a minute! Earlier, I approximated P4 as 384, but let me compute it accurately. So 26.873856 / 0.07 = 383.91240857.

Then, the PV of P4 is 383.91240857 / (1.15)^4.

(1.15)^4 is 1.74900625.

So 383.91240857 /1.74900625 ≈ let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.74900625 × 219.5 = ?

1.74900625 ×200=349.80125

1.74900625 ×19.5= let's compute 1.74900625 ×20=34.980125, minus 1.74900625 ×0.5=0.874503125.

So 34.980125 -0.874503125=34.105621875.

So 1.74900625 ×219.5=349.80125 +34.105621875=383.906871875.

Which is very close to 383.91240857. The difference is 383.91240857 -383.906871875=0.0055366875.

So 0.0055366875 /1.74900625 ≈0.003168.

So P4 PV is approximately 219.5 +0.003168=219.503168.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the formula is P4 = D5/(r-g) =383.9124. Then P4's PV is 383.9124 /1.74900625≈219.503.

So earlier, I had approximated P4's PV as 219.554, but it's actually closer to 219.503.

Now, let's recalculate the total with this more accurate P4 PV.

So recapping all PVs:

D1:12.52173913

D2:13.0661157

D3:13
