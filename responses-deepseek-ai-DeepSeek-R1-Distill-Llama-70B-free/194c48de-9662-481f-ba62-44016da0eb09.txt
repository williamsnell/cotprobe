Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the breakeven point for a company and determine how many units they should produce to make a profit. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the breakeven point is where the revenue equals the cost. So, the company isn't making a profit or a loss at this point; they're just breaking even. The revenue function is given as R = 90 times the square root of (2X), and the cost function is C = 3X + 1200. So I need to set R equal to C and solve for X.

Let me write that equation out: 90√(2X) = 3X + 1200.

Hmm, solving this equation might be a bit tricky because of the square root. I think I should try to get rid of the square root first. Maybe I can square both sides of the equation to eliminate it. But wait, before I do that, maybe I should simplify the equation a bit.

Let me rearrange the equation: 90√(2X) - 3X = 1200. Hmm, but that might not help much. Alternatively, I'll go ahead and square both sides. Let's see:

[90√(2X)]^2 = (3X + 1200)^2.

Calculating the left side: 90 squared is 8100, and √(2X) squared is just 2X. So left side becomes 8100 * 2X = 16200X.

Right side: (3X + 1200)^2 expands to (3X)^2 + 2*(3X)*(1200) + (1200)^2. That's 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000.

Now the equation is 16200X = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000.

Let me bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 16200X from both sides:

0 = 9X² + 7200X + 1,440,000 - 16200X.

Combine like terms: 7200X -16200X is -9000X. So the equation becomes:

9X² -9000X + 1,440,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in standard form. I can probably simplify this by dividing all terms by 9 to make it easier.

Divide each term by 9:

X² - 1000X + 160,000 = 0.

Wait, let me check that division again. 9000X divided by 9 is 1000X, right? And 1,440,000 divided by 9 is 160,000. Yeah, that's correct.

Now I have X² - 1000X + 160,000 = 0.

I need to solve for X. Let's see if I can factor this, but the numbers are big. Alternatively, I can use the quadratic formula.

Quadratic formula is X = [1000 ± sqrt( (1000)^2 - 4*1*160000 ) ] / (2*1).

Calculating the discriminant: (1000)^2 = 1,000,000. 4*1*160000 = 640,000.

So discriminant D = 1,000,000 - 640,000 = 360,000.

Square root of 360,000 is sqrt(360000) = 600. Because 600^2 is 360,000.

So X = [1000 ± 600 ] / 2.

That gives two solutions:

1. (1000 + 600)/2 = 1600/2 = 800
2. (1000 -600)/2 = 400/2 = 200

So the solutions are X = 200 and X = 800.

Wait a second, but I squared both sides earlier, which can sometimes introduce extraneous solutions. So I should plug these back into the original equation to verify.

Let's test X=200:

R = 90√(2*200) = 90√400 = 90*20 = 1800.

C = 3*200 +1200 = 600 +1200 = 1800. So R=C, which is correct.

Now X=800:

R=90√(2*800)=90√1600=90*40=3600.

C=3*800 +1200=2400 +1200=3600. Again R=C. So both are valid solutions.

So the breakeven points are at X=200 and X=800.

Wait, but how does that make sense? Breakeven points are where R=C, so the company isn't making profit here. So to make a profit, the revenue should be greater than the cost. So when is R > C?

So the profit condition is R > C.

Which implies 90√(2X) > 3X + 1200.

We found that at X=200 and X=800, R=C. So the regions where R > C must be between these two points or outside.

Wait, but let me think about the behavior of R and C. Let's consider X values.

When X is 0: R=0, C=1200. So C>R. So loss.

At X=200: R=C.

What about when X is less than 200? Let's pick X=100.

R=90*sqrt(200)=90*~14.14≈1272.6.

C=3*100+1200=300+1200=1500.

So R=~1272.6 < C=1500. So still loss.

At X=300: R=90*sqrt(600)=90*24.494≈2204.46.

C=3*300 +1200=900+1200=2100.

So R≈2204 > C=2100. So profit here.

Wait, so between X=200 and X=800, R is greater than C. Because at X=200, R=C, and at X=300, R>C; then at X=800, R=C again. So beyond X=800, what happens?

Let's take X=900: R=90*sqrt(1800)=90*42.426≈3818.34.

C=3*900 +1200=2700+1200=3900.

So R≈3818.34 < C=3900. So loss again.

So the company makes a profit when X is between 200 and 800, because that's where R > C.

So the breakeven points are at X=200 and X=800. But the question is about the breakeven point (singular) and how many units to produce to make a profit.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as "find the breakeven point" but then asks how many units to produce in terms of an inequality to make a profit.

So the breakeven points are at 200 and 800 units. But the profit happens when R > C, which is when X is between 200 and 800.

So the inequality would be 200 < X < 800. But looking at the options, let me check.

Looking at the options:

Option G is 200 < X <800.

Wait, but let me check all the options again.

Options:

A: 250 < X <850

B: 100 < X <700

C:350 < X <900

D:0 < X <600

E:300 < X <900

F:150 < X <750

G:200 < X <800

H:X <200

I:X>800

J:400 < X <1000

So the correct inequality is 200 < X <800, which is option G.

So the answer should be G.
</think>

To determine the breakeven point and the range of units to produce for a profit, we start by setting the revenue function equal to the cost function:  

\[
R = C \implies 90\sqrt{2X} = 3X + 1200
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:  

\[
90\sqrt{2X} - 3X = 1200 \quad \Rightarrow \quad [90\sqrt{2X}]^2 = (3X + 1200)^2
\]

Simplifying both sides:  

\[
8100 \cdot 2X = 9X^2 + 7200X + 1,440,000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 16,200X = 9X^2 + 7200X + 1,440,000
\]

Rearranging into standard quadratic form:  

\[
9X^2 - 9000X + 1,440,000 = 0
\]

Dividing through by 9:  

\[
X^2 - 1000X + 160,000 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \(X = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -1000\), and \(c = 160,000\):  

\[
X = \frac{1000 \pm \sqrt{1,000,000 - 640,000}}{2} = \frac{1000 \pm \sqrt{360,000}}{2} = \frac{1000 \pm 600}{2}
\]

This gives two solutions:  

\[
X = \frac{1000 + 600}{2} = 800 \quad \text{and} \quad X = \frac{1000 - 600}{2} = 200
\]

Thus, the breakeven points are \(X = 200\) and \(X = 800\).  

To determine the range where the company makes a profit, we analyze when \(R > C\). Testing values between and outside the breakeven points:  

- For \(X < 200\), \(R < C\) (loss).  
- For \(200 < X < 800\), \(R > C\) (profit).  
- For \(X > 800\), \(R < C\) (loss).  

Therefore, the company makes a profit when \(200 < X < 800\).  

From the given options, the correct answer is:  

**G: 200 < X < 800**
