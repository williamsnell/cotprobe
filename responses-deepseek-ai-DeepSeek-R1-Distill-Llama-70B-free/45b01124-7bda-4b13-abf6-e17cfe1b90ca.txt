Question:

 Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.

Options:

A: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C)

E: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃~C)
F: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ≡ C)
G: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ⊃ S)
H: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~C ⊃ S)
I: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (~S ≡ ~C)
J: (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ ~S)

Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about symbolizing a sentence into a propositional logic (PL) formula. The options are A through J, each with different logical expressions.

The sentence given is: "Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

Hmm, breaking that down. Let's identify each part. I think the first part is about a necessary condition, and the second part is another conditional statement.

First, "England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture." In logic terms, if France subsidizes agriculture (let's call that F), then England must be importing beef (E). Because a necessary condition means that F can only happen if E is true. So that translates to F → E. Or is it E as a necessary condition for F? Wait, necessary condition is the result happening only if the condition is met. So the structure is if F happens, then E must have happened. So yes, F → E.

Then the second part: "China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds." So this sounds like another conditional. The structure is "if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S), then China promotes human rights (C)." So that would be ~S → C.

Now, the entire sentence is an OR between these two statements. So it's (F → E) ∨ (~S → C). Let me check the options for this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (F ⊃ E) ∨ (~S ⊃ C). That matches exactly what I thought. Because F→E is F⊃E and ~S→C is ~S⊃C. So A is (F→E)∨(~S→C).

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The original sentence says "either... or...". So the two parts are connected by a disjunction. So the two parts are independent clauses. So yes, it's (F→E) OR (~S→C).

Let me quickly scan the other options to make sure none fit better. Option E is (E→F)∨(S→~C). Hmm, that's different because the first part is E→F, which would mean that if England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture. But the original says that England's importing is a necessary condition, which is the reverse.

Option A seems correct because it correctly represents both necessary condition and the conditional in the second part. So I think the answer is A.

The sentence to symbolize is: "Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds."

Breaking it down:
1. "England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture" translates to \( F \rightarrow E \), where \( F \) is "France subsidizes agriculture" and \( E \) is "England imports beef."
2. "China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds" translates to \( \neg S \rightarrow C \), where \( S \) is "South Africa supplies diamonds" and \( C \) is "China promotes human rights."

The sentence connects these two statements with "or," forming a disjunction: \( (F \rightarrow E) \lor (\neg S \rightarrow C) \).

Among the options, **Option A** matches this structure exactly: \( (F \supset E) \lor (\neg S \supset C) \).

Answer: A
