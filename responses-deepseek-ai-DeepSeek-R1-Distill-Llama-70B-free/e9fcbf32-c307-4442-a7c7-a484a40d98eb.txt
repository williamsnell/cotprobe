Okay, so I've got this problem here about a compressible gas flowing over a flat plate. Hmm, the question is asking for the surface temperature of the plate. Let me think about what I remember from my fluid mechanics and heat transfer classes.

Alright, the gas has properties similar to air. The flow is at 700°F and 30 psia. The plate is 1 inch long and perfectly insulated. The gas is moving at 500 ft/sec. Oh, and the speed is high enough that viscous dissipation can't be neglected. So I can't ignore that effect.

Wait, viscous dissipation... I remember that in boundary layer problems, especially when the flow is high-speed, the work done by viscosity (viscous dissipation) can generate heat, which affects the temperature. Oh right, this relates to the Eckert number maybe?

Since the plate is perfectly insulated, the heat transfer through the plate is zero. So the surface temperature should be higher than the recovery temperature? Or wait, what's the recovery temperature concept.

Recovery temperature is the temperature that the surface would reach due to the conversion of kinetic energy into heat because of viscous dissipation, right? So the formula for the recovery temperature (Tr) is Tr = T_infinity + ( (r)^0.5 * (u_infinity)^2 ) / (2 * c_p) )

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Eckert number Ec is defined as Ec = (u^2)/(c_p * T), right? Or is it Ec = (u^2)/(c_p * (T_wall - T_infinity)))? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, no. The recovery factor "r" is related to the Prandtl number. The recovery temperature is Tr = T_infinity + r * (u_infinity)^2/(2 c_p). So that's the formula I should use here.

But wait, the plate is perfectly insulated, so the heat flux is zero. Therefore, the surface temperature will be exactly the recovery temperature. Oh yes, because when there's no heat transfer, all the dissipated energy goes into heating the surface.

So I need to calculate the recovery temperature. So first, I need to find the recovery factor r, which depends on the Prandtl number (Pr) of air at the given conditions. But wait, the problem says the properties are similar to air, so I can approximate using air's properties.

Air typically has a Prandtl number around 0.7 to 0.71. Let's take Pr = 0.7 for calculations.

The recovery factor r is given by r = sqrt(Pr) for laminar flow, or r = Pr^(1/3) for turbulent flow. Wait, wait, what's the flow regime here? The plate is 1 inch long, which is pretty short, but the velocity is 500 ft/s. Hmm, I need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine if it's laminar or turbulent.

Reynolds number Re = (u * L) / ν. But wait, we need the kinematic viscosity ν of the gas at the given conditions. The problem says the gas is at 700°F and 30 psia. Let me convert these to more standard units to find ν.

Wait, air at standard conditions (like 60°F and 14.7 psia) has a kinematic viscosity around 0.0000172 ft²/s. But here, the temperature is higher and pressure is lower, so the viscosity will be higher. Because viscosity increases with temperature, and since pressure is lower, the density is lower, but kinematic viscosity ν is viscosity μ divided by density ρ. So at higher T and lower P, ν increases.

But wait, maybe I can approximate using the Sutherland's formula for viscosity. Sutherland's formula is μ = (1.46e-6 * T^(3/2)) / (T + 111) ). But this is for μ in slug/(ft·s). Wait, but I need to compute ν, which is μ/(ρ). Alternatively, because the gas is similar to air, perhaps I can find ν using the ratio of temperature and pressure.

The kinematic viscosity of gases increases with temperature and decreases with pressure. So, ν ∝ T^(1.5) / P for the same gas. Let me think about standard conditions for air: T0 = 60°F = 520°R, P0 = 14.7 psia.

At our case, T is 700°F = 1160°R, P is 30 psia.

So the ratio (T/T0)^(1.5) * (P0/P). Let me compute that.

(T/T0) = 1160 / 520 ≈ 2.2308. So (T/T0)^1.5 ≈ (2.23)^1.5. Let's compute that.

2^1.5 is about 2.828, 2.23 is a bit higher. Let me compute 2.23^1.5.

2.23^1 = 2.23

2.23^0.5 ≈ sqrt(2.23) ≈ 1.493

So 2.23^1.5 ≈ 2.23 * 1.493 ≈ 3.33.

Then, (P0/P) = 14.7 / 30 ≈ 0.49.

So ν ≈ ν0 * (3.33) * (0.49). What is ν0 at 60°F? ν0 ≈ 0.0000172 ft²/s.

So ν ≈ 0.0000172 * 3.33 * 0.49.

Let me compute 3.33 * 0.49 = approx 1.6317.

So 0.0000172 * 1.6317 ≈ 0.00002807 ft²/s.

So ν ≈ 2.807e-5 ft²/s.

Now, the plate length L is 1 inch. Oh wait, L needs to be in feet. So L = 1 inch = 1/12 ft ≈ 0.08333 ft.

Velocity u is 500 ft/s.

So Re = (u * L) / ν = (500 * 0.08333) / (2.807e-5).

Compute numerator: 500 * 0.08333 ≈ 41.665.

Denominator: 2.807e-5 ≈ 0.00002807.

So Re ≈ 41.665 / 0.00002807 ≈ let's see, 41.665 / 0.00002807.

Well, 41.665 / 0.00002807 ≈ approximately 1,484,000. Hmm, about 1.484e6.

That's a pretty high Reynolds number. Hmm, the critical Reynolds number for transition from laminar to turbulent is around 5e5 for a flat plate, assuming smooth surface. So at Re ~1.5e6, the flow is definitely turbulent.

So the recovery factor r is r = Pr^(1/3). Since Pr ≈ 0.7, Pr^(1/3) is about 0.7^(0.333). Let me compute that.

0.7^0.333 ≈ e^( (ln 0.7)/3 ). ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667. So ( -0.35667 )/3 ≈ -0.11889. e^-0.11889 ≈ 0.888.

So r ≈ 0.888.

Now, the recovery temperature Tr is given by:

Tr = T_infinity + ( r * u_infinity^2 ) / (2 * c_p )

Wait, but wait, what's c_p for air? I think at high temperatures, c_p for air is about 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F) or in SI units. Wait, but let me confirm the units.

Wait, the problem uses Fahrenheit and feet, so I think using imperial units is better here.

So, for air, specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, is approximately 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). But wait, that's per degree Fahrenheit.

Wait, but I think in the formula, the units need to be consistent. So let me check the units.

The velocity is in ft/s, so u^2 is (ft²/s²).

c_p is in BTU/(lb·°F).

But what about the other terms? Let me make sure about the conversion factors.

Wait, perhaps I should use consistent units. Let me think in terms of the Rankine scale because the formula involves temperatures.

Wait, the recovery temperature formula is:

Tr = T_infinity + (r * u_infinity^2) / (2 * c_p)

But I need to make sure that all units are compatible. So T is in °F, u is in ft/s, c_p is in BTU/(lb·°F). Hmm, but 1 BTU is equal to 778 ft·lb_f.

Wait, let me write the units for each term.

u^2: (ft/s)^2.

c_p: BTU/(lb·°F) = (ft·lb_f)/(lb·°F) ) because 1 BTU ≈ 778 ft·lb_f.

So u^2/(c_p) would be (ft²/s²) / (ft·lb_f/(lb·°F)) ) → (ft²/s²) * (lb·°F)/(ft·lb_f)) → (lb·°F·s²)/(ft·lb_f).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on unit conversion here. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the formula into consistent units.

Wait, another approach. Let me find the formula with proper units.

The term u^2/(2 c_p) would have units of (velocity)^2 / (specific heat).

In SI units, it's (m²/s²) / (J/(kg·K)) ) → (m²/s²) * (kg·K/J) → since J = kg·m²/s², so this becomes K. So the term is indeed a temperature.

In imperial units, I need to make sure the units work out.

Alternatively, perhaps using the conversion factor, 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf.

Wait, another approach: 1 BTU = 778 ft·lb_f. So 1 lb_f = 1 lbf. So let's see.

Let me think about the units of (u^2)/(c_p):

u is ft/s, so u^2 is ft²/s².

c_p is in BTU/(lb·°F) = (ft·lb_f)/(lb·°F).

So (u^2)/(c_p) → (ft²/s²) / ( (ft·lb_f)/(lb·°F) )) → (ft² * lb·°F) ) / (s² * ft·lb_f )) → (lb·°F) / (s² * lb_f ).

Hmm, not quite getting temperature units. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I should include the molecular weight or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the specific gas constant R for air.

Wait, another thought: The formula for recovery temperature is sometimes written as:

Tr = T_infinity + (r * u_infinity^2) / (2 * c_p)

But when using imperial units, perhaps the formula includes a conversion factor. Let me check my notes.

Wait, I think in imperial units, the formula is:

Tr = T_infinity + (r * u_infinity^2) / (2 * c_p * 25037 )

Wait, why 25037? Because 1 BTU = 778 ft·lb_f, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula includes J/(kg·K) in SI, but in imperial, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following approach:

The conversion of velocity squared to temperature involves the relation between kinetic energy and enthalpy.

The kinetic energy per unit mass is (u^2)/2. To relate this to temperature, we can write:

( u^2 ) / 2 = c_p (Tr - T_infinity )

So solving for Tr:

Tr = T_infinity + (u^2) / (2 c_p )

But wait, this is without considering the recovery factor. Oh right, because for an insulated wall, the heat flux is zero, so the recovery factor comes into play.

So the correct formula is Tr = T_infinity + r * (u^2) / (2 c_p )

But now the units must be consistent. Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:
T_infinity = 700°F
u_infinity = 500 ft/s
r ≈ 0.888
c_p for air is approximately 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F)

Wait, but I think I might be missing a conversion factor. Because when using imperial units, sometimes the specific heat needs to be in consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert all units to SI for easier calculation.

Wait, let's try that.

Convert T_infinity to Kelvin: 700°F = (700 - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15 = 668 * 5/9 ≈ 370.56 °C. 370.56 + 273.15 = 643.71 K.

u_infinity = 500 ft/s. Let's convert that to m/s.

1 ft = 0.3048 m, so 500 ft/s = 500 * 0.3048 ≈ 152.4 m/s.

Pr = 0.7, so r = Pr^(1/3) ≈ 0.7^(0.333) ≈ 0.887 as before.

c_p for air in SI units is about 1005 J/(kg·K).

So now, the formula in SI units is:

Tr = T_infinity + (r * u_infinity^2) / (2 * c_p )

Plugging in:

Tr = 643.71 K + (0.887 * (152.4 m/s)^2 ) / (2 * 1005 J/(kg·K) )

Compute numerator:

152.4^2 = 23237.76 m²/s².

Multiply by 0.887: 23237.76 * 0.887 ≈ let's compute that.

23237.76 * 0.8 = 18590.2,

23237.76 * 0.08 = 1859.02,

23237.76 * 0.007 = ~162.66.

So sum: 18590.2 + 1859.02 = 20449.22 + 162.66 ≈ 20611.88.

Divide by denominator: 2 * 1005 = 2010.

So 20611.88 / 2010 ≈ let's compute that.

2010 goes into 20611 about 10 times (2010*10=20100), remainder 511.

511 / 2010 ≈ 0.254.

So about 10.254 K.

So Tr ≈ 643.71 K + 10.254 K ≈ 653.964 K.

Convert back to °F: K = (°F - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15.

Wait, wait, to convert K to °F: °F = (K - 273.15) * 9/5 + 32.

So Tr in °F is:

653.964 K - 273.15 = 380.814 °C.

380.814 * 9/5 = 686.4664 °F.

686.4664 + 32 = 718.4664°F.

Wait, but that's approximately 718.47°F.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 716.25°F, but let me double-check my calculations because that's a bit off.

Wait, let me recalculate the u^2 term in SI units.

u = 500 ft/s = 152.4 m/s.

u^2 = (152.4)^2 = 23237.76 m²/s².

r = 0.887.

So r * u² = 0.887 * 23237.76 = Let me compute that more accurately.

0.8 * 23237.76 = 18590.208

0.08 * 23237.76 = 1859.021

0.007 * 23237.76 = 162.66432

Adding them up: 18590.208 + 1859.021 = 20449.229 + 162.66432 = 20611.893.

Divide by (2 * 1005) = 2010.

20611.893 / 2010 = Let's compute 2010 * 10 = 20100. Subtract that from 20611.893: 511.893 left.

511.893 / 2010 ≈ 0.2546.

So total is 10.2546 K.

So Tr = 643.71 + 10.2546 = 653.9646 K.

Convert 653.9646 K to °F:

653.9646 - 273.15 = 380.8146 °C.

380.8146 * 9/5 = (380.8146 * 1.8) = let's compute 380 * 1.8 = 684, 0.8146 * 1.8 ≈ 1.466 → total ≈ 685.466 °F.

Adding 32 gives 717.466°F. So approximately 717.47°F.

Looking at the options, option I is 716.25°F, option D is 772°F, which is higher. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the Reynolds number calculation because if the flow is turbulent, then r is Pr^(1/3). If it's laminar, it's Pr^(1/2). But earlier, I determined Re is about 1.5e6, which is turbulent, so r = Pr^(1/3) is correct.

Wait, another thing: Specific heat. Wait, did I use the right c_p for air in SI units? Yes, 1005 J/(kg·K) is correct for air.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that the specific heat might vary with temperature. At higher temperatures, c_p increases. Since the gas is at 700°F, which is higher than standard conditions, perhaps c_p is a bit higher than 1005 J/(kg·K). Hmm, that's possible. But for the sake of this problem, maybe the approximation is acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use imperial units throughout. Let me try that approach.

Let me compute using imperial units.

Tr = T_infinity + (r * u_infinity^2) / (2 * c_p )

But with proper unit conversion factors.

Wait, in imperial units, the formula might require a conversion factor because the units don't directly cancel. Alternatively, I can use the specific heat in BTU/(lb·°F) and include the conversion from ft²/s
