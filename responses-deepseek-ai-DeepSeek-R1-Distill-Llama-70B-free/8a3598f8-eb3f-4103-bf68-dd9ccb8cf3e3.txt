Okay, so I've got this question about the TV show 'Cheers', and I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which character Woody replaced on the show. The options are A through J, with various character names.

First, I remember that 'Cheers' was a popular sitcom that ran for a long time. The main setting is a bar in Boston, and the characters are the staff and regulars there. The main characters I recall include Sam Malone, the bartender; Woody Boyd, who was a younger bartender; and then there's Coach, who was another bartender.

Wait, so I think Coach was one of the original characters. He was played by Nicholas Colasanto. I believe he was a bit older and had some health issues, maybe? Oh right, the actor passed away, so Coach's character was written out of the show. That's when Woody came in as a replacement, I think.

So Woody was the new bartender after Coach. So the question is, who did Woody replace? It must be Coach. Looking at the options, H is Coach. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me make sure. I remember that after Coach died, Woody came on as the new bartender. He was from the Midwest, if I recall correctly, and had a more naive and friendly personality compared to Coach's gruff but lovable nature. So yeah, Woody definitely replaced Coach.

Looking at the options again, H is Coach. So the correct answer is H.
