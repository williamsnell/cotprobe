Okay, so I've got this question about concave mirrors and how the image changes when the object moves. Hmm, I remember that concave mirrors can produce both real and virtual images depending on where the object is placed. Let me think about this step by step.

The question says the object is moved from far away to near the focal point. Right, I remember that when the object is beyond the focal point, the image is real, inverted, and smaller. Wait, no, actually, when the object is beyond the focal point, the image is real, inverted, and smaller, located between the focal point and the mirror. But as the object approaches the focal point, what happens?

Wait, no. Let me correct that. When an object is placed beyond the focal point (so far away), the image is real, inverted, and smaller, located between the focal point and the mirror. As the object moves closer to the focal point, the image moves away from the mirror. Oh wait, no. Wait, think about the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. When u is very large (object far away), 1/v is almost 1/f, so v is a bit larger than f. As u decreases (object moves closer), 1/u increases, so 1/v must decrease. So v decreases, meaning the image moves closer to the mirror? Wait, no, because if u approaches f from the right (since u is the object distance, and for mirrors, u is positive when the object is in front, so when u is much larger than f, the image is between f and the mirror). So as u decreases, 1/u increases. Let's say f is positive. So 1/v = (1/f) - 1/u. Wait, no, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. So rearranged, 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. So as u decreases (object moves closer), 1/u increases, so 1/v decreases, meaning v increases? Wait, no, 1/v would be 1/f minus a larger number. Wait, suppose u is much larger than f, so 1/u is negligible. Then 1/v ≈ 1/f → v ≈ f. So the image is at f. If u approaches f, then 1/u is 1/f. So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u → 1/v = 1/f - 1/f = 0 → v approaches infinity. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I got the signs wrong. Oh wait, in the mirror formula, u is positive when the object is in front of the mirror. So if the object is at u = infinity, 1/u is zero, so 1/v = 1/f → v = f. So when the object is far away, the image is at the focal point. As the object moves closer, u decreases. Let's take u = 2f. Then 1/u = 0.5/f. So 1/v = 1/f - 0.5/f = 0.5/f → v = 2f. So the image is at 2f, which is farther from the mirror than f. So as u decreases from infinity to f, v increases from f to infinity. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, no, when u is between f and infinity, the image is real and located beyond the focal point (v > f). Wait, no, wait, the mirror equation is 1/f = 1/u +1/v. Suppose f is positive (concave mirror). When u is greater than f, the image is real beyond the focal point? Or wait, no. For a concave mirror, when the object is beyond the focal point (u> f), the image is between the focal point and the mirror, right? Because when u approaches infinity, the image is at f. Wait, no, no, that can't be right. Let me think with an example.

Take f = 10 cm. If u = 20 cm (object beyond f), then 1/f = 0.1, 1/u = 0.05. So 1/v = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 → v = 20 cm. So image is at 20 cm from mirror. Wait, but f is 10 cm, so the image is at 20 cm, which is beyond f. So when u is 20 cm (which is beyond f=10 cm), the image is at v=20 cm, which is beyond f. That seems correct because as the object approaches the mirror, the image moves further away.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. So when u is very large, v approaches f from above? No, wait, when u approaches infinity, 1/u approaches 0, so 1/v approaches 1/f → v approaches f. So the image is at f. So when u is at 2f, v is at 2f? Let me plug in u=2f. 1/u =1/(2f). So 1/v = 1/f - 1/(2f) )= (2-1)/(2f) → 1/(2f) → v=2f. So yes, when u=2f, v=2f. So the image is at 2f, which is beyond the focal point, so the image is real and inverted.

So when the object is moved from far away (u approaching infinity) to near the focal point (u approaching f from above), what happens to the image? Let's see: when u is at infinity, v is at f. When u is at 2f, v is at 2f. So as u decreases from infinity to f, v increases from f to infinity. Wait, no, because when u approaches f from above (like u=1.1f), let's compute v.

u =1.1f → 1/u ≈0.909/f. So 1/v =1/f - 0.909/f → 0.091/f → v≈10.989f. So as u approaches f, v approaches infinity. So the image moves away from the mirror as the object approaches the focal point.

Wait, but that can't be right because when u approaches f, the image moves further away, which would be the case when u is beyond f. So as the object moves closer to f from beyond, the image moves away from the mirror, getting larger. Because the image height depends on the magnification. Magnification m = -v/u. For u> f, v is positive and greater than f, so m is negative (inverted image), and m's magnitude is v/u. Since v increases as u decreases (as u approaches f), the ratio v/u increases. For example, u=2f, v=2f → m =-1. So image same height as object. When u approaches f, v approaches infinity, so m approaches -v/u → v/u is (something big)/f → so m approaches negative infinity? Wait, no. Wait, m is -v/u. So as u approaches f, v approaches infinity, so m approaches negative infinity. So the image becomes larger and inverted.

Wait, but wait, the concave mirror can't form an image beyond a certain point. Oh wait, when the object is at u = f, the image is at infinity. So as the object approaches the focal point from beyond, the image moves toward infinity, getting larger. So the image gets taller (height increases) and moves away from the mirror.

But wait, the question is about moving the object from far away to near the focal point. So as the object approaches the focal point (u approaches f from above), the image moves away from the mirror (v increases) and becomes larger (taller). So the image becomes taller and moves away.

Wait, but let's think about the image height. The magnification m is given by m = -v/u. As u decreases, with v increasing, m's magnitude (absolute value) increases. So the image becomes larger in height.

So when the object moves from far away (u=∞) to near f (u approaches f from above), the image moves from v=f to v=∞. So the image moves away from the mirror and becomes taller.

Looking at the options, the correct one should say the image moves away and gets taller.

Looking at the options:

Option B: image moves away and gets taller. Option B says "moves away from the mirror and gets taller".

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.

So that's correct.

But wait, let me think again. When the object is beyond f, moving closer, the image moves away. But wait, when the object is at u=2f, the image is at v=2f. So as u decreases from infinity to f, v increases from f to infinity. So the image moves away from the mirror. And the height increases because the magnification's absolute value is v/u. So when u is large, v is ≈f, so m is ≈ -f/u → small, so image is small. When u=2f, m is -1, so same size as object. As u approaches f, m approaches - (v/u). Since v is approaching infinity, m approaches negative infinity, so image becomes very large.

So yes, the image becomes taller and moves away. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but what about when the object is within the focal point (u < f)? But the question says the object is moved from far away to near the focal point, so u is just approaching f, not going beyond. So the image is real, moving away, getting taller.

So the answer should be option B: image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.

When an object is moved from far away to near the focal point of a concave mirror, the behavior of the image can be analyzed using the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

Here, \( f \) is the focal length, \( u \) is the object distance, and \( v \) is the image distance. Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u}
\]

As the object moves from far away (\( u \to \infty \)) to near the focal point (\( u \to f \)), the following happens:

1. **Image Distance (\( v \))**: When \( u \) is very large, \( \frac{1}{u} \) is negligible, so \( \frac{1}{v} \approx \frac{1}{f} \), and \( v \approx f \). As \( u \) decreases, \( \frac{1}{u} \) increases, causing \( \frac{1}{v} \) to decrease, which means \( v \) increases. Thus, the image moves away from the mirror.

2. **Image Height**: The magnification \( m \) is given by:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}
\]

As \( u \) decreases, \( v \) increases, so the magnitude of \( m \) increases. This means the image becomes taller. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.

3. **Image Type**: For \( u > f \), the image is real, inverted, and located beyond the focal point. As \( u \) approaches \( f \), the image moves farther away and becomes significantly larger.

From this analysis, the correct description is that **the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller**.

**Option B** matches this description.
