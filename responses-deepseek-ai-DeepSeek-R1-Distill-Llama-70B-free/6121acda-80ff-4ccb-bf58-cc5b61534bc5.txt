Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the force between two positive charges. Hmm, I remember that Coulomb's law is involved here. Let me think. Coulomb's law states that the force between two charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Oh right, the formula is F = k * (q1 * q2) / r².

Wait, the charges are given in microcoulombs. Oh, right, 1 microcoulomb is 1e-6 coulombs. So the first charge is 100 μC, which is 100e-6 C, and the second is 200 μC, so 200e-6 C.

The distance is 3 centimeters. Oh wait, centimeters aren't in meters. So I need to convert that to meters. 3 cm is 0.03 meters.

Now, the constant k is Coulomb's constant. I think it's 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Sometimes approximated as 9e9, but I'll use the more precise value for calculation.

Plugging the values into the formula:

F = (8.988e9) * (100e-6) * (200e-6) / (0.03)^2.

Let me compute the numerator first. 100e-6 is 1e-4, and 200e-6 is 2e-4. So (1e-4) * (2e-4) is 2e-8.

Multiplying by k: 8.988e9 * 2e-8 = ?

Let me calculate that. 8.988 * 2 is approximately 17.976. Then the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-8 is 1e1, so 10. So 17.976 * 10 = 179.76.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck that. 8.988e9 is 8,988,000,000. 2e-8 is 0.00000002. Multiplying these gives 8,988,000,000 * 0.00000002. Let's see: 8,988,000,000 multiplied by 2e-8 is (8,988e9) * (2e-8) = 8,988 * 2 * 1e1 (because 1e9 * 1e-8 is 1e1, which is 10). So 8,988 * 2 is 17,976, times 10 gives 179,760. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. 8,988 * 2 is 17,976, but then multiplied by 10^1 (because 1e9 * 1e-8 = 1e1). So 17,976 * 10 = 179,760. So the numerator part is 179,760.

Now the denominator is (0.03)^2. 0.03 meters squared is 0.0009 m².

So F = 179760 / 0.0009.

Hmm, let me compute that. 179760 divided by 0.0009. Let me write it as 179760 / 9e-4. Which is the same as 179760 * (1e4/9) )= 179760 * (10000/9).

Alternatively, 179760 / 0.0009 = 179760 * (1 / 0.0009). 1 / 0.0009 is approximately 1111.111.

So 179760 * 1111.111. Let me compute that approximately.

Wait, 179,760 * 1,111.111 is a big number. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Wait, another approach: 0.0009 is 9e-4, so 1/9e-4 is 1/(9*1e-4)) = (1/9) * 1e4 = approximately 0.1111 * 10,000 = 1111.111...

So 179,760 * 1111.111.

Hmm, let me compute 179,760 * 1000 = 179,760,000.

179,760 * 100 = 17,976,000.

179,760 * 10 = 1,797,600.

179,760 * 1 = 179,760.

Wait, but 1111.111 is 1000 + 100 + 10 + 1.111. Maybe it's easier to compute 179760 * 1111.111 as:

179760 * 1111.111 = 179760 * (1000 + 100 + 10 + 1 + 0.111)

But perhaps a better approach is to compute 179760 * 1111.111.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents.

Wait, 179760 divided by 0.0009:

0.0009 is 9e-4, so dividing by 9e-4 is same as multiplying by 1e4/9.

So 179760 * (1e4/9) = (179760 /9) * 1e4.

179760 divided by 9: Let's compute that.

9*19973 = 179,757. Hmm, 19973 *9: 19973*9= 179,757. So 179760 -179757=3. So 19973 with a remainder of 3. So 19973 + 3/9 = 19973.333...

So 179760 /9 = approx 19973.333...

Multiply by 1e4: 19973.333 * 1e4 = 199733330.

Wait, but wait, that's 1e4, so 19973.333 * 1e4 is 199733330 N? That seems way too high. Because looking at the options, the highest is 1e6, which is 10^6, which is 1,000,000. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the initial F expression: F = (8.988e9) * (100e-6) * (200e-6) / (0.03)^2.

Let me compute each step more accurately.

Compute q1*q2: 100e-6 * 200e-6 = (1e-4) * (2e-4) = 2e-8 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 2e-8 = (8.988 * 2) * 1e1 = 17.976 * 10 = 179.76.

Wait, wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 1e9. 2e-8 is 2 x 1e-8.

So 8.988e9 * 2e-8 = (8.988 * 2) * (1e9 * 1e-8) )= 17.976 * 1e1 = 179.76.

So numerator is 179.76.

Denominator is (0.03)^2 = 0.0009 m².

So F = 179.76 / 0.0009.

Hmm, 179.76 divided by 0.0009.

Let me compute this division.

0.0009 goes into 179.76 how many times?

Let's think in terms of exponents. 0.0009 is 9e-4.

So 179.76 / 9e-4 = (179.76 /9) * 1e4.

Compute 179.76 /9: 9*19=171, 20*9=180. 179.76 is close to 180. So 19.976... Let's compute exactly.

9 * 19 = 171. Subtract 171 from 179.76: 8.76 left.

Bring down a zero: 87.6 divided by 9 is 9.7333... So 19.973333...

So approximately 19.9733.

Multiply by 1e4: 19.9733 * 1e4 = 199,733 N.

Wait, that's 1.99733e5 N, which is approximately 2e5 N, but let me look at the options.

The options are:

A:5e5

B:1e5

C:7e5

D:3e5

E:6e5

F:4e5

G:8e5

H:9e5

I:1e6

J:2e5

Wait, my calculation gives approximately 199,733 N, which is roughly 2e5 N. So option J is 2e5 N, which is 200,000 N. That's very close.

But wait, let me check the calculation again because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another way: 0.03 m is 3 cm.

F = k * q1*q2 / r².

Compute each part:

q1 = 100e-6 C = 1e-4 C.

q2=200e-6 C=2e-4 C.

q1*q2= (1e-4)(2e-4)=2e-8 C².

k=8.988e9 N m²/C².

r=0.03 m. r²=0.0009 m².

So F = (8.988e9) * (2e-8) / 0.0009.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 2e-8 = (8.988 * 2) * 1e1 = 17.976 *10 = 179.76.

Then 179.76 / 0.0009.

Hmm, 0.0009 is 9e-4. So 179.76 / 9e-4 = (179.76 /9) * 1e4.

179.76 /9: 9*19=171; 179.76-171=8.76; 8.76/9=0.9733... So 19.9733.

Multiply by 1e4: 19.9733e4 = 199,733 N.

So approximately 200,000 N, which is 2e5 N.

Looking back at the options, option J is 2e5 N. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me check if I missed any conversion. Oh wait, the charges are in microcoulombs, so 100 μC is 100e-6 C. Yes, I did that right.

Another thing: since both charges are positive, the force is repulsive, but the question only asks for the magnitude, so the sign doesn't matter here.

Yes, I think the correct answer is J: 2e5 N.
</think>

To calculate the force between two positive charges using Coulomb's law, we use the formula:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}
\]

### Given:
- \( q_1 = 100 \, \mu C = 100 \times 10^{-6} \, C = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, C \)
- \( q_2 = 200 \, \mu C = 200 \times 10^{-6} \, C = 2 \times 10^{-4} \, C \)
- \( r = 3 \, \text{cm} = 0.03 \, \text{m} \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \)

### Step 1: Compute \( q_1 \cdot q_2 \)
\[
q_1 \cdot q_2 = (1 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-4}) = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C}^2
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = (0.03)^2 = 0.0009 \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( F \)
\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2} = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot \frac{2 \times 10^{-8}}{0.0009}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8}) = (8.988 \cdot 2) \cdot 10^{9-8} = 17.976 \cdot 10^1 = 179.76
\]

Now divide by \( r^2 \):
\[
F = \frac{179.76}{0.0009} = 199,733 \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated force is approximately \( 2 \times 10^5 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to **option J**.
