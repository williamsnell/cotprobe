Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat dissipation from a wire. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the wire is stretched along the axis of a cylinder, and I need to find out the rates at which heat is dissipated by conduction through the gas and by radiation. Oh right, the wire is perfectly black, so radiation should be calculated using Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Wire diameter: 0.5 mm. So radius r_w = 0.25 mm = 0.025 cm.
- Cylinder diameter: 5 cm, so radius r_c = 2.5 cm.
- Length of cylinder (and wire) L = 25 cm.
- Wire temperature T_w = 750 K.
- Cylinder temperature T_c = 250 K.
- Thermal conductivity of gas, k = 6e-5 cal/(cm·°C·s).

Wait, the units are a bit tricky. Thermal conductivity is in cal·cm^-1·°C^-1·s^-1. Right.

I remember that the heat loss by conduction (Q_cond) can be calculated using Fourier's law for cylindrical coordinates. The formula is:

Q_cond = (2π * L * k * (T_w - T_c)) / ln(r_c / r_w)

And for radiation, since the wire is a perfect black body, the Stefan-Boltzmann law applies:

Q_rad = ε * σ * A * (T_w^4 - T_c^4)

But wait, ε is 1 for a perfect black body. The surface area A is the surface area of the wire, which is a cylinder. So A = 2π r_w L.

Wait, no, wait. The wire is inside the cylinder, so the radiation would be from the wire's surface to the cylinder's inner walls. So the area of the wire is indeed 2π r_w L, right.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, conduction:

Compute the denominator ln(r_c / r_w). r_c is 2.5 cm, r_w is 0.025 cm. So r_c / r_w is 2.5 / 0.025 = 100. ln(100) is approximately 4.605.

Then Q_cond = (2π * 25 cm * 6e-5 cal/(cm·K·s) * (750 K - 250 K)) / 4.605

Let's compute the numerator:

2π *25 = 50π ≈ 157.08.

6e-5 * (500 K) = 6e-5 * 500 = 0.03.

So numerator is 157.08 * 0.03 = approx 4.7124.

Divide by 4.605: 4.7124 / 4.605 ≈ 1.023 cal/s.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 2π * L is correct. L is 25 cm. So 2π *25 = 50π.

Multiply that by k (6e-5), and (Tw - Tc) = 500 K.

So 50π * 6e-5 = 50 * 6e-5 * π = 3e-3 * π ≈ 0.00942477.

Multiply by 500: 0.00942477 *500 = 4.71238.

Then divide by ln(100)=4.60517 gives approximately 1.023 cal/s.

Hmm, looking at the options, option H has 0.95 cal/s by conduction. Maybe I miscalculated?

Wait, let me recheck the values more accurately.

Wait, r_c is 2.5 cm, r_w is 0.025 cm.

ln(r_c/r_w) = ln(100) = 4.60517.

Compute 2π L k (Tw - Tc) / ln(r_c/r_w)

2π *25 = 50π ≈ 157.0796327.

k = 6e-5 = 0.00006.

Tw - Tc = 500.

So numerator: 157.0796327 * 0.00006 * 500.

Compute 0.00006 * 500 = 0.03.

157.0796327 * 0.03 = approximately 4.712387.

Divide by 4.60517: 4.712387 /4.60517 ≈ 1.023.

Hmm, so about 1.02 cal/s for conduction. Let me look at the options.

Looking through options, option I is 1.02 conduction, 1.67 radiation. Option H is 0.95 conduction, 1.50 radiation. So my conduction value is 1.02, which is option I. But let's calculate the radiation part.

Radiation: Q_rad = σ * A * (T_w^4 - T_c^4)

Wait, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, in what units?

The problem says the thermal conductivity is in cal/(cm·K·s), so I think we need to use σ in cal units. Let me recall, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is usually 5.67e-12 W/(m²·K^4), but I need to convert it to cal/(cm²·s·K^4).

Wait, 1 Watt = 1 Joule/s, and 1 cal = 4.184 J approximately. So 1 W = 1/4.184 cal/s ≈ 0.239 cal/s.

So 1 W/(m²·K^4) = 0.239 cal/(s·m²·K^4).

But m² is (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm², so 1 W/(m²·K^4) = 0.239 cal/(s * 1e4 cm² * K^4) )= 2.39e-6 cal/(cm²·s·K^4).

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me find the value of σ in cal units.

Alternatively, I might remember that σ ≈ 0.817 × 10^-12 cal/(cm²·s·K^4). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is written using different units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate using SI units and then convert to cal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just recall that in cgs units (which uses cm, grams, etc.), the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is approximately 5.17 × 10^-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4).

Wait, but 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s². 1 cal is about 4.184 ×10^7 ergs. So 5.17e-5 erg/(cm² s K^4) = 5.17e-5 /4.184e7 cal/(cm² s K^4) ) ≈ 1.235e-12 cal/(cm² s K^4).

Wait, that sounds too small. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula in another way. Wait, maybe it's better to compute in SI units and then convert.

So, let's proceed step by step.

Wire radius r_w = 0.5 mm = 0.05 cm = 0.005 m.

Wait no, wait the cylinder is 5 cm diameter, so radius is 2.5 cm. The wire is 0.5 mm diameter, so radius 0.25 mm = 0.025 cm.

The length L is 25 cm = 0.25 m.

Surface area of the wire, A = 2π r_w L.

So r_w = 0.025 cm = 0.0025 m.

So A = 2 * π * 0.0025 m * 0.25 m = 2 * π * 0.000625 m² ≈ 0.003927 m².

But wait, for radiation, the formula is Q = ε σ A (T_w^4 - T_c^4). Since the wire is perfectly black, ε=1.

σ in SI is 5.67e-8 W/(m²·K^4).

So compute Q_rad = 5.67e-8 * 0.003927 * (750^4 - 250^4).

Compute 750^4: let's compute 750^2 = 562500, then 562500^2 = approx 3.164e11.

250^2=62500, 62500^2=3.90625e9.

So 750^4 -250^4 = 3.164e11 - 3.906e9 = approx 3.134e11.

So Q_rad =5.67e-8 *0.003927 *3.134e11.

Compute each part:

5.67e-8 * 0.003927 = approx 2.227e-10.

Multiply by 3.134e11: 2.227e-10 *3.134e11 = approx 6.98e1, which is about 69.8 Watts.

But wait, the question asks for the rate in cal/s. Since 1 Watt is 1 Joule/s, and 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 W = 1/4.184 cal/s ≈ 0.239 cal/s.

So 69.8 W = 69.8 * 0.239 cal/s ≈ 16.67 cal/s. That can't be right because the options are all below 3 cal/s.

Wait, this can't be right. I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the surface area. Let me recalculate A.

r_w is 0.5 mm diameter, so radius 0.25 mm = 0.025 cm = 0.0025 m.

Length L is 25 cm = 0.25 m.

So surface area A = 2π r L = 2 * π * 0.0025 m * 0.25 m.

2 * 0.0025 = 0.005; 0.005 * 0.25 = 0.00125. Multiply by π: A ≈ 0.003927 m². That seems correct.

Wait, but in the formula for radiation, the area is the surface area of the wire, which is correct.

But perhaps I forgot that the wire is inside the cylinder, so the radiation is to the surrounding cylinder walls. Oh, but for a black body, the emissivity is 1, so the net power is based on the temperature difference.

Wait no, the formula should be correct as it is. But the problem is that the result I'm getting is way higher than the options suggest. So maybe I made a mistake in the thermal conductivity part, but the conduction part is about 1 cal/s, which matches option I.

Wait, but let me check the radiation calculation again. Maybe I used the wrong units for σ.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with all quantities in cgs units. Let's try that.

In cgs units, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is σ = 5.17 × 10^-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4).

But 1 erg = 1 g·cm²/s², and 1 cal is 4.184 × 10^7 erg.

So 5.17e-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4) = 5.17e-5 /4.184e7 cal/(cm²·s·K^4) ≈ 1.235e-12 cal/(cm²·s·K^4).

Wait, that seems too small. Let me proceed.

Compute the radiation in cgs units.

A is in cm².

r_w = 0.025 cm, L=25 cm.

A = 2π * 0.025 cm * 25 cm = 2π * 0.625 cm² ≈ 3.927 cm².

T_w =750 K, T_c=250 K.

Compute Q_rad = σ * A * (T_w^4 - T_c^4)

But wait, in cgs, σ is 5.17e-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4).

So:

Q_rad =5.17e-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4) * 3.927 cm² * (750^4 -250^4 K^4)

Compute 750^4: (7.5e2)^4 = 7.5^4 * 1e8. 7.5^4 = (7.5^2)^2=56.25^2=3164.0625. So 3164.0625e8 = 3.1640625e11 K^4.

Similarly, 250^4= (2.5e2)^4=2.5^4 *1e8=39.0625e8=3.90625e9.

So (750^4 -250^4) =3.1640625e11 -3.90625e9 = approx 3.134e11 K^4.

So Q_rad =5.17e-5 *3.927 *3.134e11.

Compute each step:

5.17e-5 *3.927 = approx 0.0000517 *3.927 ≈ 0.0002033.

Multiply by 3.134e11: 0.0002033 *3.134e11 = approx 6.38e7 erg/s.

Convert erg/s to cal/s: 1 cal =4.184e7 erg, so 6.38e7 erg/s =6.38e7 /4.184e7 ≈ 1.524 cal/s.

Ah, that's better. So Q_rad ≈1.52 cal/s.

Wait, but earlier I thought the conduction was around 1.02 cal/s. So conduction is 1.02, radiation 1.52.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.02 conduction, 1.67 radiation. Hmm, not matching. Option H is 0.95 conduction, 1.5 radiation. Closer.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me recheck the conduction part.

Conduction formula:

Q_cond = (2π L k (Tw - Tc)) / ln(r_c /r_w)

Given:

L=25 cm, k=6e-5 cal/(cm·K·s)

Tw-Tc=500 K.

ln(r_c/r_w)=ln(2.5/0.025)=ln(100)=4.605.

So 2π *25 =50π≈157.08.

So 157.08 *6e-5 = 0.0094248.

Multiply by 500 K: 0.0094248 *500=4.7124.

Divide by 4.605:4.7124/4.605≈1.023 cal/s.

So conduction is around 1.023 cal/s, which is approximately 1.02.

Radiation came out to be ~1.52 cal/s.

Looking at the options:

Option I: 1.02 conduction, 1.67 radiation.

Option H: 0.95, 1.50.

Hmm, my radiation is about 1.52, which is close to option H's 1.50, and option I's 1.67 is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the radiation part.

Wait, let me recalculate the radiation in cgs units:

A =2π r_w L =2 * π *0.025 cm *25 cm = 2 * π * 0.625 cm² = approx 3.927 cm².

σ =5.17e-5 erg/(cm²·s·K^4).

Compute 750^4 -250^4:

750^4 = (7.5e2)^4 = (7.5)^4 * 10^8.

7.5^2 is 56.25; 56.25^2 is 3164.0625. So 3164.0625e8 =3.1640625e11.

250^4= (2.5)^4 *10^8 =39.0625e8=3.90625e9.

So 3.1640625e11 -3.90625e9=3.134e11.

Now, Q_rad =5.17e-5 *3.927 *3.134e11.

Compute 5.17e-5 *3.927 first.

5e-5 *3.927 =0.00019635.

0.17e-5 *3.927=0.000000668. So total approx 0.00019635 +0.000000668≈0.000197.

Multiply by 3.134e11: 0.000197 *3.134e11 = approx 6.17e8 erg/s.

Convert to cal/s:6.17e8 /4.184e7 =approx 14.75.

Wait, wait, no, wait. 6.17e8 erg/s divided by 4.184e7 erg/cal gives 14.75 cal/s.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 1.5. Where did I go wrong?

Oh wait, no, I think I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 5.17e-5 *3.927 is 0.0000517 *3.927=0.0002033.

Then, 0.0002033 *3.134e11 = 0.0002033 *3.134e11 = multiply 2.033e-4 *3.134e11 = approx 6.38e7 erg/s.

Wait, 6.38e7 erg/s is 6.38e7 /4.184e7 = approx 1.524 cal/s.

Ah, okay, that's consistent with the previous result.

So radiation is about 1.52 cal/s.

Now, looking at the options:

Option H says conduction 0.95, radiation 1.50. Close.

Option I: conduction 1.02, radiation 1.67.

Hmm, the conduction is around 1.02, so the closest option would be I, but the radiation is 1.52. None of the options have exactly 1.02 and 1.52.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the units for the radiation again. Another approach: perhaps the formula should use the temperature difference as (T_w^4 - T_surrounding^4), which I did correctly.

Wait, another thing: for an infinite cylinder,
