Question:

There has been a great deal of news media coverage regarding the problem of underage drinking. Many high school and college students have been purchasing fraudulent driver's licenses with phony birthdates showing "proof' of being 21 years of age or older. As a consequence, many teenagers are able to purchase alcoholic beverages at liquor stores, restaurants, and bars. The situation is becoming especially alarming on many college campuses. A magazine article reported that the majority of freshmen between the ages of 18 and 19 at many colleges had illegally purchased evidence of phony "proof. "With underage drinking reaching epidemic proportions, Congress enacted a statute establishing a federal commission to monitor and curtail alcoholic beverage sales to underage drinkers. To implement the program on a national scale, the bill required each state to pass legislation establishing a local "watchdog" agency to facilitate compliance with congressional intent. A state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the federal statute. The law is likely to be held

Options:

A: valid, because the Twenty First Amendment grants the federal government the power to control the sale and consumption of alcohol.
B: valid, because the federal government has the power to regulate all activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
C: valid, because the establishment of a state watchdog agency under the auspices of a federal regulatory scheme is consistent with the provisions of the Twenty First Amendment.
D: valid, because the sale of alcoholic beverages has a substantial impact on interstate commerce.
E: invalid, because it violates the Tenth Amendment's reservation of powers to the states.
F: invalid, because it violates the fundamental principles of state sovereignty embodied by the Eleventh Amendment.
G: invalid, because the federal government cannot force states to implement federal regulations.
H: invalid, because it infringes on the state's right to regulate activities within their own borders.
I: invalid, because the federal government may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.
J: valid, because the federal government has the authority to regulate issues of national concern.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with the Tenth Amendment and federalism. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a federal statute aimed at curbing underage drinking. Congress created a commission and required each state to set up a local watchdog agency. A state is challenging this law's constitutionality. I need to figure out if the law is valid or invalid.

First, I remember that the Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. So, if Congress is trying to compel states to pass legislation, that might be a Tenth Amendment issue.

In the past, there was a significant Supreme Court case about this. I think it was New York v. United States (1992). The court struck down a federal law that required states to either dispose of radioactive waste themselves or allow it to be disposed of according to federal standards. The court said that the federal government couldn't command states to enact or enforce federal regulations. That's the anti-commandeering doctrine.

So applying that here, the federal statute requires each state to pass legislation creating a watchdog agency. That sounds like the federal government is trying to command the states to take action. That would likely be unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment because it's forcing states to implement federal programs.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: Talks about the 21st Amendment. But the 21st Amendment repealed Prohibition and gives states control over alcohol. However, the issue here isn't about alcohol regulation per se, but about federal commandeering. So A might not be the right reason for validity.

Option B: Says it's valid under interstate commerce. Well, the commerce clause does give Congress broad powers, but the problem is compelling states to act. Even if the activity affects interstate commerce, the means of forcing state legislation might not be permissible. The commerce clause can't override the Tenth Amendment in this case.

Option C: Relates to the 21st Amendment again. Similar reasoning as A, so probably not.

Option D: Also about interstate commerce impact. While alcohol sales do affect commerce, the issue is the method, not the power. So D might not be the right reason.

Option E: Says it's invalid because of the Tenth Amendment. That aligns with the anti-commandeering principle. So E could be the correct choice.

Option F: Mentions the Eleventh Amendment, which is about state immunity from lawsuits in federal court. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option G: States that the feds can't force states to implement regulations. That's exactly the issue. So G is a contender.

Option H: Talks about state's right to regulate within borders. While related, the specific issue is about compelling state legislation, which is more about commandeering.

Option I: Says the feds can't compel state legislatures. This is another way of stating the anti-commandeering doctrine, so I is also a possible correct answer.

Option J: National concern under commerce. But again, the method is the problem, not the authority.

Wait, so between E, G, and I.

E says it's invalid under the Tenth Amendment's reservation. G says feds can't force states to implement. I says can't compel state legislatures. Which option is correct?

In the New York case, Justice O'Connor's majority opinion said that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring the states to enact or administer a federal regulatory program. So the reason is the Tenth Amendment reservation, which makes E correct. But I is also phrased correctly.

Wait, the question is about whether the law is valid or invalid. The options E and I both state it's invalid. Let me read them again.

E: Invalid, because violates Tenth Amendment reservation.

I: Invalid, because feds can't compel state legislatures to enact a federal program.

So both E and I seem correct. Wait, but in the New York case, the holding was based on the Tenth Amendment. So E is more about the constitutional reason, while I is more about the action (compelling legislatures).

Looking back, the question asks why the law is likely invalid. The correct legal reason is the Tenth Amendment, so E would be correct. Alternatively, some might think I is correct because it's about compelling the states, which is the same as the Tenth Amendment issue.

Wait, but let me think about the options. Option I says "may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program." That's exactly what the case law says. So I might be the correct answer.

Wait, but the Tenth Amendment is the basis for that. So both E and I are pointing to the same underlying issue, but phrased differently.

Looking back at the options, E is about the reservation of powers, I is about compelling legislatures. The NY case was about the compelled legislation, so the reason is the Tenth Amendment. So E would be the correct choice.

Wait, no. Let me make sure. The question is about whether the law is valid. The options are E and I.

In the New York case, the Court held that the Tenth Amendment prohibits federal actions that command the states to enact or enforce federal laws. So the correct reasoning is the Tenth Amendment, making E the correct answer.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's about the commerce clause's limits, but the issue here is commandeering, not whether the commerce clause applies.

Wait, but another angle: Does the 21st Amendment give the federal government more power? Because the 21st Amendment gives states control over alcohol, but the question is about underage drinking. Wait, the 21st Amendment doesn't give the feds the power to regulate in this way; it actually removes federal prohibition and allows states to regulate. So A and C are not correct.

So, going back, the correct reason is the Tenth Amendment. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option I also seems correct. Let me think again. The law requires each state to pass legislation. That's compelling the state legislatures, which is exactly what the Tenth Amendment prohibits via the anti-commandeering doctrine. So the reason is the Tenth Amendment, making E correct.

Alternatively, option I is phrased as "federal government cannot compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program," which is a direct application of the Tenth Amendment. So I think both E and I are pointing to the same reasoning, but the options are separate.

Wait, but E is more general, stating it's invalid because of Tenth Amendment reservation. I is more specific, about compelling state legislatures.

In the provided options, both E and I could be correct, but looking at the possible answers, perhaps the intended correct answer is E or I.

Wait, but in the question, the correct answer is likely E or I. Let me check the options again.

Ah, the correct answer is E: invalid because violates the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states.

But wait, another thought: The commerce clause usually allows Congress to regulate economic activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Selling alcohol is such an activity, so Congress can regulate it under the commerce clause. But if the method is commandeering, then even if the activity is within commerce, the method is invalid.

So the law is invalid because of the method (commandeering), not because Congress lacks the power under commerce. So the reason is the Tenth Amendment, making E correct.

So the answer should be E.

But wait, option I says "may not compel state legislatures to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program." That's exactly what the law is doing. So I is also correct, but perhaps more specific.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive, so I need to pick the best one.

In the New York case, the Court said that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from requiring the state to enact laws. So the correct reasoning is the Tenth Amendment, making E correct.

Alternatively, some might say I is correct because it's about compelling state legislatures, which is a specific application of the Tenth Amendment.

Hmm, but the options are about the reason. So in the question, the state is suing, challenging the constitutionality. The likely holding is that the law is invalid under the Tenth Amendment because it's commandeering the states.

So I think the correct answer is E. But I'm a bit torn because I also seems correct. But the wording of E is broader, about the reservation of powers, while I is about the specific action.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I because it directly addresses the issue of compelling state legislatures, which is the essence of the anti-commandeering doctrine.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is E: invalid under the Tenth Amendment.

Wait no, wait. The case is about commandeering, which is a Tenth Amendment issue. So E is correct.

Alternatively, looking at the options again, J says it's valid because of national concern. No, that's not the case here.

I think the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a federal statute requiring states to establish local watchdog agencies to curb underage drinking. This raises concerns under the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. The Supreme Court has established the anti-commandeering doctrine, most notably in *New York v. United States (1992)*, which prohibits the federal government from compelling states to enact or enforce federal regulations. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The Twenty-First Amendment grants states control over alcohol regulation but does not permit the federal government to commandeer state legislatures.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the commerce clause allows Congress to regulate activities affecting interstate commerce, it does not permit the federal government to compel state legislatures to act.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The Twenty-First Amendment does not support federal commandeering of state agencies.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The impact on interstate commerce is irrelevant when the method of federal action violates the Tenth Amendment.  
- **Option E**: Correct. The statute violates the Tenth Amendment by requiring states to enact specific legislation, which is prohibited under the anti-commandeering doctrine.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The Eleventh Amendment pertains to state immunity from federal lawsuits, not federal commandeering.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While it states the federal government cannot force states to implement regulations, it does not cite the constitutional basis (Tenth Amendment).  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The issue is not general state regulatory authority but the specific commandeering of state legislatures.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While it accurately describes the anti-commandeering principle, it does not explicitly invoke the Tenth Amendment as the constitutional basis.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. National concern does not justify violating the Tenth Amendment.  

The correct answer is **E**, as it directly addresses the Tenth Amendment violation, which is the constitutional basis for the invalidity of the federal statute.

**Answer: E**
