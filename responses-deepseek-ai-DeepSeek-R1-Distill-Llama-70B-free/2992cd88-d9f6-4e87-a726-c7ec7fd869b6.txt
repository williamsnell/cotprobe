Okay, so Marshall has this English paper he needs to finish typing before class starts. He's got 550 words left and only 25 minutes until class begins. The question is asking how fast he needs to type to finish on time. Hmm, I guess I need to find out his required typing speed in words per minute.

Alright, let's break this down. He has 550 words left and 25 minutes. So, the basic idea is to divide the total number of words by the time he has to find out how many words he needs to type each minute.

So, typing speed required would be 550 words divided by 25 minutes. Let me do that calculation. 550 divided by 25. Hmm, 25 times 20 is 500, which leaves 50 remaining. 25 goes into 50 twice, so that's 20 + 2 = 22. So, 25 times 22 is 550. So, that means he needs to type at least 22 words per minute.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. So, 25 minutes multiplied by 22 words per minute should equal 550 words. Let me check: 25 * 22. 20*22 is 440, and 5*22 is 110. Adding them together, 440 + 110 = 550. Yep, that checks out.

So the calculation is correct. Therefore, Marshall needs to type at a speed of 22 words per minute. Looking at the options, option C is 22 words per minute, so that should be the correct answer.

I don't think I need to consider any other factors here because the question is straightforward. It's just a division problem. No need for any complicated formulas or anything like that. So I'm pretty confident that 22 is the right answer.

To determine how fast Marshall must type, divide the number of words left (550) by the time available (25 minutes):

\[
\text{Typing speed} = \frac{550 \text{ words}}{25 \text{ minutes}} = 22 \text{ words per minute}.
\]

Thus, Marshall needs to type at least **22 words per minute**. The correct answer is:

C: 22 words per minute

Answer: C
