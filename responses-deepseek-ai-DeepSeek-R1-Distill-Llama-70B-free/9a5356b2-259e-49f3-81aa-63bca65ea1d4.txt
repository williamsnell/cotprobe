Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question, and I need to figure out which term correctly fills in the blank. The question is about an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities. It mentions that this has become a hot topic recently because of work intensification and technological changes.

Let me break it down. The key points are the balance between work and non-work activities. So I'm thinking about terms related to balancing work and personal life. 

The options are A through J. Let me go through each one:

A: Work-leisure ratio. Leisure is free time, so that's a possible fit. But I'm not sure if this is the commonly used term.

B: Employee engagement. That's more about how involved and committed employees are in their work, not about balancing work and personal time.

C: Work-health balance. Hmm, that's a thing, but it's more about health in relation to work, like managing stress to stay healthy.

D: Work-stress balance. Again, this seems more about handling stress rather than balancing work with personal life.

E: Workload management. That's about handling the amount of work, not the balance between work and non-work activities.

F: Work-life balance. Oh, I think this is the one. It's a very common term referring to the balance between work and personal life. It's definitely a hot topic, especially with more people working remotely and dealing with technology blurring work and home life.

G: Presenteeism. That's when people stay at work longer than needed, often because of pressure. It's related but not exactly about the balance between work and non-work.

H: Job satisfaction. This is about how happy someone is with their job, not directly about balancing work and personal time.

I: Work-play balance. Play is more about leisure activities, but I don't think this is the commonly used term compared to work-life balance.

J: Absenteeism. This is about not showing up to work, which is the opposite of presenteeism. Not related to the balance aspect.

So putting it all together, the term that fits best is work-life balance, which is option F.

The correct answer is F: Work-life balance. This term refers to the balance between work-related and non-work-related activities, which has become a significant issue due to work intensification and technological changes.

Answer: F
