Question:

A pedestrian was injured when hit by a chair that was thrown from an upper-story hotel window. The pedestrian sued the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown. At trial, the pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. The defendants have filed a motion for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because the pedestrian has failed to offer evidence that the defendants jointly engaged in tortious conduct.
B: Yes, because the pedestrian has not provided evidence of negligence from a specific defendant.
C: Yes, because the defendants have not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
D: No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.
E: Yes, because the evidence provided is circumstantial and not directly linked to any defendant.
F: No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.
G: No, because the pedestrian was not at fault for the incident.
H: No, because the defendants should prove their innocence.
I: No, because the pedestrian has suffered physical harm and someone must be held accountable.
J: Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

A pedestrian was injured when a chair was thrown from an upper-story hotel window. The pedestrian sued the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown. But at trial, the pedestrian couldn't offer any evidence about the exact room the chair came from. Now, the defendants are asking for a directed verdict. The question is whether the court should grant that motion.

Hmm, a directed verdict is when the court decides that one party has won because there's no legally sufficient evidence to support the other party's case. So the defendants are saying that the pedestrian didn't provide enough evidence, so the court should rule in their favor.

Looking at the options, I need to understand the legal principles here. The pedestrian is suing multiple defendants, possibly under a theory of joint liability or something similar. But the pedestrian can't specify which exact defendant did the throwing. So the question is about whether that's enough to hold any of them liable.

I remember that in tort law, a plaintiff must prove that a specific defendant was the cause of their harm. This is about causation and the burden of proof. If the plaintiff can't identify which defendant actually caused the harm, does that mean the case fails?

Let me think about the options. Option B says yes, because the pedestrian hasn't provided evidence of negligence from a specific defendant. That sounds relevant because if the pedestrian can't link it to a specific defendant, they can't prove negligence by that person.

Option J says yes because the plaintiff must prove a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause. That aligns with the idea that the burden is on the plaintiff to show causation. Without that, the case can't proceed against any defendant.

Option D says no, because it's unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which defendant caused the harm. But wait, the law generally requires the plaintiff to meet their burden of proof. If they can't, the case should fail. So the court may grant the motion because the pedestrian didn't meet their burden.

Another thought: is there a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to sue multiple potential tortfeasors without knowing the exact one? Like alternative liability or joint and several liability? I think alternative liability applies when the harm could have been caused by one of two or more acts, and each defendant is potentially liable. But in some cases, if the plaintiff can't prove which one, the court might still hold them liable if they can show that each defendant's actions could have caused the harm and that it's more likely than not that one of them did. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, in the case of Summers v. Tice, which is a classic case, two defendants shot at the plaintiff, and it was impossible to tell which one's bullet caused the injury. The court applied a rule of joint liability, saying that the burden shifts to the defendants to prove that they were not the cause. But that's when both defendants acted negligently in a way that made it impossible for the plaintiff to know. In this question, the pedestrian sued all possible rooms, but maybe the issue is that he can't show any specific defendant's negligence.

Wait, but in this scenario, the pedestrian hasn't offered any evidence against any specific defendant. So even if we consider alternative liability, there's no evidence that any particular defendant acted negligently. So without evidence that a specific defendant was negligent, the directed verdict would be appropriate.

So looking at the options, option B says that the pedestrian hasn't provided evidence of negligence from a specific defendant. That makes sense, because to win, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant was negligent, and that their negligence caused the harm.

Option J is more about the factual cause, which ties into causation. So even if a defendant was negligent, if the pedestrian can't show that their actions caused the harm, then the case fails. But in this case, the issue is that the pedestrian can't even identify which defendant's negligence caused the harm because they don't know which room it was thrown from.

Wait, but the question is whether the court should grant a directed verdict. A directed verdict would mean that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff hasn't presented enough evidence to support their claim. So if the pedestrian can't show that any specific defendant was negligent, then the motion should be granted.

So looking at the options again:

Option B: Yes, because the pedestrian hasn't provided evidence of negligence from a specific defendant. That seems correct because without showing that a specific defendant was negligent, the claim against that defendant fails.

Option J is also a correct statement of the law, but the question is about whether the court should grant the motion. The issue is whether the pedestrian has failed to prove a prima facie case, which requires showing that the defendant was negligent and that their negligence caused the harm.

So if the pedestrian can't even identify which defendant's conduct caused the harm, then they can't establish causation. Therefore, the court should grant the motion.

Wait, but in the Summers v. Tice case, the court allowed the case to proceed despite the inability to prove which defendant caused the harm because both were negligent. But in this case, the pedestrian hasn't shown that any of the defendants were negligent. So the situation is different. Because without evidence of negligence by any specific defendant, the case fails.

So the correct answer would be either B or J. Option B focuses on the lack of evidence of negligence by a specific defendant. Option J is about the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the cause.

Wait, the question is about a directed verdict, which is granted when, after the plaintiff presents their case, there's no legally sufficient evidence. So the defendants are arguing that even if you accept all the pedestrian's evidence as true, they haven't made a case.

The pedestrian's case is that one of the defendants threw the chair negligently. But without any evidence pointing to any specific defendant, the pedestrian hasn't met their burden.

So the correct answer would be B or J. Let me think again.

In this scenario, the pedestrian didn't offer any evidence as to which room the chair came from. So he can't prove that any specific defendant was negligent. Therefore, the court should grant the motion because the pedestrian failed to meet the burden of proving that a specific defendant's negligence caused the harm.

So the correct answer would be either B or J. Both seem correct, but let's read them carefully.

Option B: Yes, because the pedestrian has not provided evidence of negligence from a specific defendant.

Option J: Yes, because the plaintiff must prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause.

The question is more about the inability to identify the specific defendant, which goes to causation. So the pedestrian hasn't shown that any particular defendant's action caused the harm. So J is about the factual cause, which the pedestrian failed to prove.

Wait, but in this case, the issue is that the pedestrian can't prove which defendant did it. So he can't show that any specific defendant's actions were the cause. Therefore, he fails to prove causation.

So in that case, the correct answer would be J because it's about the burden to prove factual cause.

Alternatively, B is about negligence, but if the pedestrian can't even identify the defendant, both negligence and causation are issues. But the main point is that without evidence against a specific defendant, the case can't proceed.

I think the correct answer is B, but wait, the question is about whether the court should grant a directed verdict. The pedestrian has the burden to prove both negligence and causation.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B because without evidence of negligence by a specific defendant, the plaintiff's case fails. Alternatively, J is correct because the plaintiff must prove that a particular defendant's actions caused the harm.

Wait, the problem is that the pedestrian hasn't provided any evidence that any of the defendants were negligent. So perhaps B is the better answer because the pedestrian hasn't shown that any specific defendant acted negligently.

But wait, in the scenario, the pedestrian sued the occupants of all possible rooms. Maybe the theory is that each of them could have thrown the chair, but without evidence, each defendant is entitled to a directed verdict because the pedestrian can't prove that any one of them did it.

So in the absence of evidence against any specific defendant, the pedestrian's claim fails. Therefore, the court should grant the motion.

So looking back, the options are:

A: Yes, because no evidence of joint tortious conduct.

B: Yes, because no evidence of negligence from a specific defendant.

C: Yes, because not proven beyond reasonable doubt (but this is a civil case, so the standard is preponderance, not beyond a reasonable doubt).

D: No, because it's unreasonable to expect proof.

E: Yes, circumstantial evidence not linked.

F: No, because alternative liability.

G: No, pedestrian not at fault.

H: No, defendants should prove innocence (shifting burden).

I: No, someone must be held accountable.

J: Yes, because burden to prove a particular defendant's conduct.

So the correct reasoning would be that the plaintiff failed to prove that any specific defendant was negligent, which is option B, or failed to prove causation, which is J.

Wait, but in the case of Summers v. Tice, the court allowed the case to proceed because both defendants were negligent, and it was their burden to disprove causation. But in that case, the plaintiff presented evidence that both defendants acted negligently, just couldn't tell which one caused the harm. Here, the pedestrian hasn't shown that any of the defendants acted negligently. So it's different.

Therefore, in this scenario, without any evidence of negligence by any specific defendant, the pedestrian loses. So the correct answer would be B or J.

Wait, the question is about a directed verdict, which is based on whether the plaintiff has presented enough evidence to submit the case to the jury. If the pedestrian can't even show that any defendant was negligent, then there's no case.

But perhaps the issue is that the pedestrian can't prove which specific defendant caused the harm, but maybe there's a theory that all possible defendants are liable. But that would require some evidence that one of them must have done it, but without more, the pedestrian can't proceed.

I think the correct answer is B: Yes, because the pedestrian hasn't provided evidence of negligence from a specific defendant.

Wait, but what if the pedestrian can't identify which defendant, but can show that one of them must have been negligent? Like, all possible rooms, so the chair must have come from one of them. But without more, that's not enough. Because the pedestrian needs to show that a particular defendant was negligent. So the court would grant the motion because the pedestrian hasn't met their burden.

So the answer is B.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the court should grant a directed verdict in favor of the defendants after the pedestrian failed to provide evidence identifying the specific room from which the chair was thrown. A directed verdict is appropriate when the plaintiff fails to present legally sufficient evidence to support their claim.

The pedestrian sued the occupants of all possible rooms from which the chair might have been thrown but did not offer any evidence of negligence by a specific defendant. In tort law, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving both negligence and causation, specifically linking the harm to a particular defendant's conduct. Without evidence identifying the negligent defendant, the pedestrian cannot meet this burden.

Option B correctly states that the pedestrian has not provided evidence of negligence from a specific defendant, which is a fatal flaw in their case. While Option J also addresses the burden of proving factual causation, the more direct issue here is the lack of evidence of negligence by any specific defendant. Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a directed verdict.

**Answer: B**
