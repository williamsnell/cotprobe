Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the molecular weight of serum globulin using the diffusion coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about the Stokes-Einstein equation. Let me think.

So, the problem gives me the diffusion coefficient, D, which is 4.0 × 10^-11 m²/s. The temperature is 20°C, and the viscosity of water, η, is 0.001005 Pascal seconds. Oh wait, and the partial specific volume, v_bar, is 0.75 cm³/g. Right, I need to find the molecular weight, M.

Wait, the Stokes-Einstein equation relates the diffusion coefficient to the size of the molecule. The equation is D = (k_B * T) / (6πηa), where a is the radius of the spherical molecule. But how does that help me find the molecular weight?

Ah, right, I think there's another equation that connects the radius to the molecular weight. Oh yeah, the relation between the radius, partial specific volume, and molecular weight. The formula is a = ( (3 * M * v_bar) / (4π * N_A) )^(1/3). So combining these two should give me M.

Let me write down the equations step by step. First, from Stokes-Einstein:

D = (k_B * T) / (6πηa) → solving for a: a = (k_B * T) / (6πη D).

Wait, no, that would be a = (k_B T)/(6πη D). Because rearranging D = (k_B T)/(6πη a) → multiply both sides by 6πη a: D * 6πη a = k_B T → a = (k_B T)/(6πη D).

But then, once I have a, I can plug it into the other equation to find M.

So the second equation is a^3 = (3 M v_bar) / (4 π N_A). So solving for M gives M = (4 π a^3 N_A) / (3 v_bar).

Wait, let me make sure. The partial specific volume, v_bar, is the volume per gram, so M * v_bar is volume per mole. So, volume per mole is M v_bar, and the volume of one molecule is (M v_bar)/N_A. Then, since the molecule is a sphere, its volume is (4/3) π a³. So setting them equal: (4/3) π a³ = (M v_bar)/(N_A). Therefore, M = (4/3) π a³ N_A / v_bar.

Yes, that makes sense. So putting it all together, I can substitute a from the first equation into the second.

So substituting a into M's equation:

M = (4 π ( (k_B T) / (6πη D) )^3 ) * N_A / (3 v_bar).

Simplify this expression. Let me compute each part.

First, I need to know the Boltzmann constant, k_B. I remember it's 1.380649 × 10^-23 J/(K·mol), but wait, no, wait, Boltzmann constant is per molecule, so 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, wait, in the equation, I think the units might require using R, the gas constant, which is k_B multiplied by Avogadro's number. Because sometimes in these equations, you have to be careful whether you're using per molecule or per mole constants.

Wait, wait, let me think. The Stokes-Einstein equation is D = (k_B T) / (6πη a), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant. Alternatively, it's written as D = (R T) / (6πη N_A a), because R is k_B N_A. Hmm, right, because R = k_B * N_A. So depending on the form, it's either using k_B or R. Let me double-check the units to see which one I should use.

In the equation, D has units of m²/s. Let's see: k_B is J/(K·mol) ?? No, wait, no, k_B is J/(K·particle). So k_B * T would be energy per particle. Hmm, the denominator is 6πη a, which has units of Pa·s * meters → (Pa is N/m², so Pa·s is N·s/m². So denominator is (N·s/m²) * m = N·s/m. So the whole denominator has units of N·s/m. The numerator, k_B*T has units J/(particle·K) * K → J/particle → (N·m)/particle.

Wait, D is m²/s. So (k_B T)/(6πη a) must have units m²/s.

So numerator: (N m / particle) * T? No, wait, T is in Kelvin, which is unitless in terms of dimensional analysis. So numerator is (N m) per particle. Denominator is (N s/m²) * (m) → (N s) / m. So overall:

[(N m / particle)] / [ (N s/m) ] → (m²) / (s * particle). To get D in m²/s, the per particle must be per molecule.

Wait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Let me just proceed with the equation as D = (k_B T) / (6πη a), using k_B.

But let me check the units again. So k_B is J/(K·mol), wait no, no, wait, no, k_B is J/(K·particle). So if T is in Kelvin, then k_B*T is J/particle, which is (N·m)/particle. The denominator is η (Pa·s) * a (m). Pa is N/m², so η has units N·s/m². Multiply by a in meters: (N·s/m²) * m = N·s/m. So denominator has N·s/m.

So (N·m/particle) / (N·s/m) ) → (m²)/(s * particle). But D has units m²/s, so to get rid of the per particle, I think I must have made a mistake. Oh wait, because in the equation, it's actually k_B T per molecule, but when you multiply by Avogadro's number, it becomes R T per mole. So perhaps the correct equation to use when working in terms of molecular weight (moles) is to use R instead of k_B.

So maybe the correct equation is D = (R T) / (6πη N_A a), because R is k_B multiplied by N_A. Let me see: R = k_B * N_A. So substituting R:

D = (R T) / (6πη N_A a). So solving for a: a = (R T) / (6πη N_A D).

Yes, that makes more sense, because then the denominator becomes per mole. So that's probably the correct way to go.

So with that, the formula for a becomes a = (R T) / (6πη N_A D).

Then, plug this into the equation for M:

M = (4/3) π a³ N_A / v_bar.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine that. Earlier, I said the relation was (4/3) π a³ = (M v_bar) / N_A → M = (4 π a³ N_A) / (3 v_bar).

Yes, that's correct. So substituting a from the D equation gives:

M = (4 π ( (R T) / (6πη N_A D) )³ ) * N_A / (3 v_bar).

Simplify this expression.

Let me write it step by step.

M = [4 π (R T)^3 / (6πη N_A D)^3 ) ] * [ N_A / (3 v_bar) ) ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The numerator is 4 π R^3 T^3.

The denominator is (6πη)^3 (N_A)^3 D^3 * 3 v_bar.

Wait, let me write it as:

M = [4 π R³ T³ ] / [ (6πη D)^3 * 3 v_bar N_A² ) ].

Wait, because:

Denominator: (6πη N_A D)^3 becomes (6πη)^3 (N_A)^3 (D)^3.

And then multiplied by 3 v_bar, so denominator is 3 v_bar (6πη)^3 N_A^3 D^3.

Wait, no. Let me re-express M:

M = (4 π R^3 T^3) / (6^3 η^3 (N_A D)^3 3 v_bar) ) * (N_A) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write all factors step by step.

Wait, sorry, perhaps it's better to just plug the numbers after simplifying the expression.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula that combines all these terms. Let me recall if there's a formula that directly relates D, T, η, v_bar, and M.

Yes, I think there is. The formula for molecular weight using diffusion is:

M = (D * 6πη N_A ) / (k_B T) )^(something?) Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with substitution.

Wait, the expression I have is:

M = (4 π R^3 T^3) / [ (6 π η D)^3 * 3 v_bar N_A^2 ) ]

Wait, no, let me re-calculate:

M = (4 π a³ N_A) / (3 v_bar).

And a = (R T) / (6 π η N_A D).

So:

a^3 = [ R T / (6 π η N_A D) ]^3.

So plugging into M:

M = (4 π / (3 v_bar)) * [ R T / (6 π η N_A D) ]^3 * N_A.

So let's multiply that out:

M = (4 π) / (3 v_bar) * ( R^3 T^3 ) / (6 π η N_A D)^3 ) * N_A.

Simplify each term.

First, 4 π divided by 3 v_bar.

Then, R^3 T^3 divided by (6 π η N_A D)^3.

Multiply by N_A.

So let's write it as:

M = [4 π R^3 T^3 N_A ] / [ 3 v_bar (6 π η N_A D)^3 ) ].

Now, let's expand the denominator in the denominator:

(6 π η N_A D)^3 = 6^3 π^3 η^3 N_A^3 D^3.

So substituting back:

M = [4 π R^3 T^3 N_A ] / [3 v_bar * 6^3 π^3 η^3 N_A^3 D^3 ].

Now, let's simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4 π R^3 T^3 N_A.

Denominator: 3 v_bar * 216 π^3 η^3 N_A^3 D^3. Because 6^3 is 216.

So:

M = (4 π R³ T³ N_A) / (3 * 216 π³ η³ N_A³ v_bar D³ )

Simplify terms:

4 / (3 * 216) = 4 / 648 = 1 / 162.

π / π³ = 1/π².

R³ remains.

T³ remains.

N_A / N_A³ = 1/N_A².

So:

M = ( R³ T³ ) * (4) / (3 * 216) ) * (1) / (π² η³ D³ v_bar N_A² )

Wait, let me compute the constants:

4/(3*216) = 4/(648) = 1/162 ≈ 0.0061728.

So, putting all together:

M = ( R³ T³ ) * (1/162) ) / ( π² η³ D³ v_bar N_A² ) * (1/ ...? Hmm, perhaps it's better to plug in the numbers step by step.

Alternatively, maybe using a more straightforward substitution.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed numerically, plugging in the values.

Let me list all the constants and given values:

Given:

D = 4.0 × 10^-11 m²/s.

η (water) = 0.001005 Pa·s = 0.001005 N·s/m².

v_bar = 0.75 cm³/g. Since 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, and 1 g = 0.001 kg, so 0.75 cm³/g = 0.75e-6 m³/kg.

Wait, wait, wait, let me compute v_bar in correct SI units.

v_bar is given as 0.75 cm³/g. 1 cm³ is (1e-2 m)^3 = 1e-6 m³. 1 g is 1e-3 kg. So:

v_bar = 0.75 cm³/g = 0.75 * 1e-6 m³ / (1e-3 kg) ) = 0.75 * 1e-3 m³/kg = 7.5e-4 m³/kg.

Wait, no, wait: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, and 1 g = 0.001 kg. So 0.75 cm³/g = 0.75 * (1e-6 m³) / (0.001 kg) ) = 0.75 * (1e-6 / 1e-3) m³/kg = 0.75 * 1e-3 m³/kg = 7.5e-4 m³/kg.

Yes, that's correct. So v_bar = 7.5e-4 m³/kg.

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T is 20°C, which is 293.15 K.

N_A is Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 mol^-1.

k_B is Boltzmann's constant, but since we're using R, which is k_B * N_A, we don't need k_B here.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the correct equation uses R, so let's proceed with R.

So now, let's compute each part step by step.

First, let me compute 'a' using the Stokes-Einstein equation:

a = (R T) / (6 π η N_A D).

Wait, let me plug the numbers in:

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K)

T = 293.15 K

η = 0.001005 N·s/m²

N_A = 6.022e23 /mol

D = 4.0e-11 m²/s.

So:

Numerator: R*T = 8.314 * 293.15 ≈ let's compute that.

8 * 293 is 2344, 0.314*293≈92, so total ≈ 2436 J/mol.

Wait, precise calculation: 8.314 * 293.15.

Let me compute 8 * 293.15 = 2345.2, 0.314 * 293.15 ≈ 0.3 * 293=87.9, 0.014*293≈4.102 → total ≈ 87.9+4.102=91. So 8.314 * 293.15≈ 2345.2 +91= 2436.2 J/mol.

Denominator: 6 * π * η * N_A * D.

Compute denominator step by step.

6 * π ≈ 18.8496.

η is 0.001005 N·s/m².

N_A is 6.022e23 /mol.

D is 4.0e-11 m²/s.

Multiply them all together:

18.8496 * 0.001005 = approx 0.0189.

Then multiply by N_A: 0.0189 * 6.022e23 ≈ 0.0189 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.14e22? Wait, 0.0189 is 1.89e-2. 1.89e-2 * 6.022e23 = (1.89 *6.022) e21 → approx 11.38e21 = 1.138e22.

Then multiply by D: 1.138e22 * 4.0e-11 = 4.552e11.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, wait: denominator is 6πηN_A D.

Compute each multiplication step.

Compute 6 * π = 18.8495592.

Then multiply by η: 18.8495592 * 0.001005 = let's compute 18.8495592 * 0.001 = 0.0188495592. Then 18.8495592 * 0.000005 = 0.0000942478. So total is approx 0.0188495592 + 0.0000942478 ≈ 0.018943807.

Next, multiply by N_A: 0.018943807 * 6.022e23 → 0.018943807 *6.022 = approx 0.1142, then times 1e23 → 1.142e22.

Then multiply by D: 1.142e22 * 4.0e-11 = (1.142 *4) * 1e11 → 4.568 *1e11 → 4.568e11.

So denominator is 4.568e11.

Numerator is 2436.2 J/mol.

So a = 2436.2 / 4.568e11 → let's compute that.

Approximately, 2436 /4.568e11 → 2436 /4.568 ≈ 533, so 533e-11 → 5.33e-9 meters. Because 1e-11 is 1e-9 * 1e-2. Wait, wait 2436 /4.568e11 = (2436 /4.568) * 1e-11 → 533 → 533e-11 = 5.33e-9 meters.

So a ≈5.33e-9 m. That's the radius.

Now, with a known, compute M.

M = (4 π a³ N_A) / (3 v_bar )

So compute a³ first.

a =5.33e-9 m → a³ = (5.33)^3 * (1e-9)^3 → 151.6 (since 5^3=125, 5.33^3≈151.6) → 151.6e-27 = 1.516e-25 m³
