Question:

When the atria contract, only 30% of the ventricular space becomes filled. How does the additional 70% become filled? Describe the process of the cardiac cycle in general.

Options:

A: Ventricular filling is achieved through nervous stimulation.
B: 70% of the ventricular filling occurs during diastole due to passive flow as the atrial pressure is greater than the ventricular pressure.
C: The additional 70% is filled by the gravitational force when the body is in a specific position.
D: The remaining ventricular space is filled by pulmonary backflow during inhalation.
E: Ventricular filling is supplemented by the contraction of auxiliary heart chambers.
F: Ventricular filling is completed by muscular constriction of the ventricles.
G: Ventricular filling for the remaining 70% is regulated by hormonal changes during the cardiac cycle.
H: Ventricular filling occurs during systole due to active flow.
I: The remaining 70% of ventricular filling is due to contraction of the atria.
J: The last 70% of ventricular filling is aided by the opening and closing of the semilunar valves.

Okay, so I've got this question about the cardiac cycle and ventricular filling. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy and physiology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that when the atria contract, only 30% of the ventricular space is filled. That means there's another 70% that gets filled some other way. I remember that the heart has a two-phase filling process during diastole.

Wait, diastole is when the heart muscle relaxes, right? So during diastole, the ventricles relax and the atria fill with blood. Then, the atria contract, pushing blood into the ventricles. But that only accounts for 30%, so the majority must happen before the atria contract.

Oh right, I think it's called passive filling. So when the ventricles are relaxed (diastole), blood flows from the atria into the ventricles because the atrial pressure is higher. This is the rapid filling phase. Then comes atrial contraction, which adds a bit more. But the majority, like 70%, is from the initial passive flow.

Looking at the options:

Option B says 70% during diastole because atrial pressure is greater. That sounds right because during diastole, the ventricles are relaxed, so their pressure is lower than the atria. Blood flows in passively.

Option I says the remaining is due to atrial contraction, but that's only 30% as per the question. So I can't be right.

Option F talks about ventricular constriction. No, that's systole when they contract and push blood out, not fill.

Option H says filling during systole due to active flow. That doesn't make sense because systole is when the ventricles contract and push blood into the arteries, so they don't fill during systole.

Option J mentions semilunar valves. Those are at the exits of the ventricles, so they open during systole to let blood out. Not relevant for filling.

Options C and D seem unrelated. C is about gravity, which I don't think plays a primary role here. D talks about pulmonary backflow, which doesn't fit the normal filling process.

So the correct answer should be B. Let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Yes, during diastole, the ventricles relax, and blood flows in passively from the atria. The initial 70% is passive, then 30% from atrial kick. So option B is correct.

The cardiac cycle involves two main phases: systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation). During diastole, the ventricles relax, and blood flows into them from the atria. This passive flow occurs because the atrial pressure is greater than the ventricular pressure when the ventricles are relaxed. This passive filling accounts for approximately 70% of ventricular filling. The remaining 30% is filled during atrial contraction, often referred to as the "atrial kick." 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is:

**B: 70% of the ventricular filling occurs during diastole due to passive flow as the atrial pressure is greater than the ventricular pressure.**

This explanation aligns with the physiological process of ventricular filling during the cardiac cycle.

Answer: B
