Question:

An owner of a large, three-story office building planned to renovate the building and requested several contractors to submit bids to perform the work. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, "I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. "Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs. The contractor then performed the renovation work, but the owner has not yet paid him anything. In an action by the contractor against the owner for the services rendered, the contractor will probably be able to recover

Options:

A: $75,000 only, due to the owner's lack of involvement in the subcontractor's bid.
B: $85,000, to cover the additional cost and the inconvenience caused by the first electrician's withdrawal.
C: only in quantum meruit, because the contractor performed the renovation work despite the disagreement over costs.
D: $75,000 only, because the contractor failed to secure the electrician's commitment.
E: $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.
F: $80,000, because the owner should bear the cost of unexpected expenses.
G: $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.
H: $80,000, because the owner was informed about the increased cost before work began.
I: only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrifle of commercial frustration.
J: only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the scenario is. 

So, there's an owner of a large office building who wants to renovate it. The owner asks several contractors to submit bids. One of these contractors, let's call him Contractor A, then seeks bids from subcontractors to figure out the total cost. An electrician gives Contractor A a bid for the electrical work, which Contractor A uses to calculate his own bid to the owner. Contractor A then tells the electrician he's using the bid. 

Two weeks later, Contractor A sends his bid to the owner for $75,000. The next day, the electrician backs out, saying he can't do the work. Then, two days after that, the owner accepts Contractor A's bid with a signed letter. Contractor A then hires another electrician, but this one charges $5,000 more than the original bid. So now the total cost for the renovation goes up to $80,000. 

Contractor A tells the owner about this, but the owner says she'll only pay the original $75,000 and won't cover the extra $5,000. Contractor A does the work anyway, but the owner hasn't paid anything yet. Now, Contractor A is suing the owner for the services rendered. The question is, how much can he recover?

Hmm, let's break this down. I think it's a contract law question, specifically about whether the owner is bound to pay the higher amount or just the original bid.

So, first, when Contractor A submitted his bid to the owner, and the owner accepted it, that forms a contract for $75,000. The issue is whether the owner is responsible for the extra $5,000 because the subcontractor (electrician) backed out.

Wait, but the electrician was a subcontractor, not someone the owner directly dealt with. So, the owner's contract is with Contractor A, who is responsible for completing the work as per the bid. The subcontractor's failure might be considered a problem for Contractor A, not the owner.

I remember something about the doctrine of privity of contract, where only the parties to the contract can enforce it. So the owner doesn't have a contract with the electrician; only Contractor A does. So if the electrician breaches their contract with Contractor A, the owner isn't liable for that.

Another point is that when Contractor A used the electrician's bid to make his own bid, he didn't secure a formal subcontract yet. The electrician's bid was just an estimate. So when the electrician withdrew, Contractor A had to find another subcontractor, which cost more. But in the eyes of the law, the main contract is between Contractor A and the owner for $75,000.

So, the owner's acceptance of the $75,000 bid creates a binding contract. Unless there's a provision in the contract allowing for cost increases due to subcontractor issues, the owner isn't obligated to pay more. But in this case, there's no mention of such a clause.

Wait, but what about the concept of reliance? Contractor A relied on the electrician's bid when making his own offer. Does that create any obligation on the owner? I don't think so because the owner wasn't part of that subcontractor arrangement. The contractor is responsible for managing his own subcontractors.

Looking at the options, option E says the contractor can recover $75,000 only because that was the contract price. Option D says the same but because the contractor failed to secure the electrician's commitment. Option A says the same but due to the owner's lack of involvement.

I think the key here is that the contractor is bound by the contract to perform for $75,000. The owner isn't responsible for the subcontractor's failure. So the contractor can't charge more unless the contract allows it, which it doesn't here.

So the correct answer would likely be E, because the contract was for $75,000, and that's what the owner is obligated to pay. The extra cost is the contractor's problem because he didn't secure the subcontractor properly.

Wait, but what about quantum meruit? That's when you recover the value of services rendered if there's no enforceable contract. But here, there is a contract, so quantum meruit wouldn't apply. The contractor has to perform as per the contract, and the owner must pay the agreed price. So the contractor can't get more than $75,000.

Another thought: the electrician's withdrawal might be a breach of contract between them and Contractor A, but that doesn't affect the main contract with the owner. So the owner still owes $75k, and Contractor A can sue the electrician for the extra $5k if possible, but not the owner.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is E: $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.

The scenario revolves around a contract between the owner and Contractor A for renovation work at an agreed price of $75,000. Contractor A based his bid in part on a subcontractor's (electrician's) estimate, but the electrician withdrew before the owner accepted the bid. Contractor A then hired another subcontractor at an additional cost of $5,000, but the owner refused to pay the increased amount, insisting on the original contract price of $75,000. The legal issue is whether the owner is obligated to pay the higher amount due to the subcontractor's withdrawal.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Contract Formation**: The owner and Contractor A entered into a binding contract for $75,000 when the owner accepted Contractor A's bid. This contract obligates Contractor A to perform the work for the agreed price, and the owner is obligated to pay that amount.

2. **Subcontractor's Withdrawal**: The electrician's withdrawal is a breach of contract between the electrician and Contractor A. However, the owner is not a party to this subcontract and has no liability for the subcontractor's failure. The owner's obligation is limited to the terms of the main contract with Contractor A.

3. **No Obligation for Additional Costs**: The owner is not responsible for the extra $5,000 incurred by Contractor A due to the subcontractor's withdrawal. The contract does not include provisions allowing for cost increases in such circumstances, and the owner is entitled to hold Contractor A to the original contract price.

4. **Quantum Meruit**: This doctrine is not applicable here because there is an enforceable contract between the parties. Quantum meruit applies when there is no valid contract, which is not the case in this scenario.

5. **Contractor's Responsibility**: Contractor A is bound by the terms of the contract and must perform the work for $75,000. Any additional costs incurred due to the subcontractor's withdrawal are Contractor A's responsibility, not the owner's.

Based on this analysis, the contractor is entitled to recover $75,000, as that is the agreed contract price. The owner is not obligated to pay the additional $5,000, and the contractor cannot claim more than the contract price.
