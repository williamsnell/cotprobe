Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about maximizing profit for a manufacturer. Let me start by understanding the question step by step.

The manufacturer currently sells 2000 units each month at $2 per unit. For every 1-cent increase in price, sales drop by 10 units. Fixed costs are $500, and variable costs (material and labor) are 40 cents per unit. I need to find the price that maximizes profit.

Hmm, I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. So Profit = Revenue - (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs). But I need to express this in terms of the number of units sold, which depends on the price.

Let me break it down. The price increase affects both the selling price and the number of units sold. For each 1-cent increase, the price goes up by $0.01, but units sold go down by 10. So I need to model both the price and quantity as variables.

Let me denote x as the number of 1-cent increases. So, the new price per unit would be 2 + 0.01x dollars. The number of units sold would be 2000 - 10x.

Wait, but x can't be negative because that would imply a price decrease, but the question doesn't mention considering price decreases, so I think x should be a non-negative integer.

Now, total revenue (TR) is price times quantity. So TR = (2 + 0.01x) * (2000 - 10x). 

Total costs (TC) are fixed costs plus variable costs. Fixed costs are $500, and variable costs are 0.40 per unit. So TC = 500 + 0.40*(2000 - 10x).

Profit (π) is TR - TC. So I need to express π in terms of x and then find the x that maximizes it.

Let me compute TR first:
TR = (2 + 0.01x) * (2000 -10x)
Let me expand this:
= 2*(2000 -10x) + 0.01x*(2000 -10x)
= 4000 -20x + 20x -0.1x²
Wait, wait, that's interesting. Let me compute each part:
First part: 2*2000 = 4000, 2*(-10x) = -20x.
Second part: 0.01x * 2000 = 20x, 0.01x*(-10x) = -0.1x².
So adding together: 4000 -20x +20x -0.1x² → 4000 -0.1x².

Oh, wait, the -20x and +20x cancel each other out. So TR simplifies to 4000 - 0.1x². Interesting, so revenue is a function of x squared, which is a downward opening parabola, meaning it has a maximum point.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense intuitively. If increasing price by x cents increases revenue at first but then starts to drop because of lost sales. So the TR function being a downward parabola would mean maximum revenue at x=0, which is the current price. That can't be right because sometimes raising prices can increase revenue, but maybe in this case, it's not so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check:

TR = (2 + 0.01x) * (2000 -10x)
Let me compute it as (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd.

So a=2, b=0.01x, c=2000, d=-10x.

ac = 2*2000=4000
ad = 2*(-10x) = -20x
bc = 0.01x *2000 = 20x
bd = 0.01x*(-10x) = -0.1x²

So adding all together: 4000 -20x +20x -0.1x² = 4000 -0.1x². Yeah, that's correct. So TR =4000 -0.1x².

Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So according to this, the maximum TR is at x=0, which is $2000 per month at the current price. But that seems counterintuitive because sometimes raising prices can increase revenue, but perhaps in this scenario, due to the high elasticity, it's not the case.

But wait, maybe the mistake is in the way I set up the variables. Let me think again. When the price increases by x cents, each unit's price increases by 0.01x dollars, but the quantity sold decreases by 10x units. So the quantity is 2000 -10x. So the setup seems correct.

So according to the TR function, the revenue is maximized at the current price, with x=0. But that would mean the maximum profit is at x=0, but when I include costs, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, let's compute the total cost. TC = 500 + 0.4*(2000 -10x) → 500 + 0.4*2000 -0.4*10x → 500 + 800 -4x → 1300 -4x.

So profit π = TR - TC = (4000 -0.1x²) - (1300 -4x) → 4000 -0.1x² -1300 +4x → (4000-1300)=2700, so 2700 +4x -0.1x².

So π = -0.1x² +4x +2700.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and since the coefficient of x² is negative (-0.1), the parabola opens downward, so the maximum profit is at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola ax² + bx +c is at x = -b/(2a).

Here, a= -0.1, b=4. So x = -4/(2*(-0.1)) → x = -4 / (-0.2) → x=20.

So x=20. That means 20 one-cent increases. So the price per unit would be 2 + 0.01*20 = 2 + 0.20 = $2.20.

Wait, so at x=20, the price is $2.20. Let me check the options. Option F is $2.20.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the profit equation.

π = TR - TC = (4000 -0.1x²) - (1300 -4x) → 4000 -0.1x² -1300 +4x → 2700 +4x -0.1x². Correct.

Then, the vertex at x=20. So that's the point where profit is maximized.

Let me compute the profit at x=20 to confirm it's a maximum.

Alternatively, I can take the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and set it to zero.

dπ/dx = 4 -0.2x. Setting to zero: 4 -0.2x=0 → 0.2x=4 → x=20. Yep, same result.

So x=20, price is 2.20, which is option F.

But wait, let me check the units. x is the number of 1-cent increases. So 20 times 1 cent is 20 cents. So the price becomes 2 + 0.20 = $2.20.

But wait, let's make sure that at x=20, the quantity sold is still positive. 2000 -10*20 = 2000 -200=1800 units. That makes sense; they're still selling a positive number of units.

Also, let me compute the profit at x=20 and maybe a few nearby points to ensure it's the maximum.

At x=20:

TR = 4000 -0.1*(20)^2 =4000 -0.1*400=4000-40=3960.

TC=1300 -4*20=1300-80=1220.

Profit=3960 -1220=2740.

At x=19:

TR=4000 -0.1*(361)=4000-36.1=3963.9.

TC=1300 -4*19=1300-76=1224.

Profit=3963.9-1224= approx 2739.9, which is slightly less than 2740.

At x=21:

TR=4000 -0.1*(441)=4000-44.1=3955.9.

TC=1300 -4*21=1300-84=1216.

Profit=3955.9 -1216= approx 2739.9, again slightly less.

So yes, x=20 gives the maximum profit. So the optimal price is $2.20, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the price that maximizes profit, we start by defining the variables and relationships:

1. **Price and Quantity Sold**:  
   Let \( x \) represent the number of 1-cent increases in price. The new price per unit becomes \( 2 + 0.01x \) dollars, and the number of units sold decreases to \( 2000 - 10x \).

2. **Total Revenue (TR)**:  
   Total revenue is the product of price and quantity sold:  
   \[
   TR = (2 + 0.01x)(2000 - 10x)
   \]  
   Expanding this:  
   \[
   TR = 4000 - 20x + 20x - 0.1x^2 = 4000 - 0.1x^2
   \]  

3. **Total Cost (TC)**:  
   Total cost includes fixed costs and variable costs:  
   \[
   TC = 500 + 0.4(2000 - 10x) = 500 + 800 - 4x = 1300 - 4x
   \]  

4. **Profit (\( \pi \))**:  
   Profit is total revenue minus total cost:  
   \[
   \pi = TR - TC = (4000 - 0.1x^2) - (1300 - 4x) = 2700 + 4x - 0.1x^2
   \]  

5. **Maximizing Profit**:  
   The profit function \( \pi = -0.1x^2 + 4x + 2700 \) is a quadratic equation, and since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the maximum profit occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -0.1 \) and \( b = 4 \), so:  
   \[
   x = -\frac{4}{2(-0.1)} = 20
   \]  

   Thus, \( x = 20 \), meaning there are 20 one-cent increases in price. The new price per unit is:  
   \[
   2 + 0.01(20) = 2.20
   \]  

6. **Verification**:  
   At \( x = 20 \):  
   - Quantity sold = \( 2000 - 10(20) = 1800 \) units.  
   - Total revenue = \( 4000 - 0.1(20)^2 = 3960 \).  
   - Total cost = \( 1300 - 4(20) = 1220 \).  
   - Profit = \( 3960 - 1220 = 2740 \).  

   Checking nearby values of \( x \) (e.g., \( x = 19 \) and \( x = 21 \)) confirms that \( x = 20 \) yields the maximum profit.

Therefore, the price that maximizes profit is **$2.20**, corresponding to **Option F**.
