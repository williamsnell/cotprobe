Okay, so I have this question about the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and what a score of 50 means. Hmm, I remember that the BDI-II is a test used to measure the severity of depression. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact cutoff points for each category.

Wait, I think the scoring goes like this: the BDI-II has a range from 0 to 63. The higher the score, the more severe the depression. Let me try to recall the categories.

I think the categories are something like:
- 0-13: Minimal or no depression.
- 14-19: Mild depression.
- 20-28: Moderate depression.
- 29-63: Severe depression.

So if someone scored 50, that's way above 29. So that would fall into the severe category. Let me double-check the options given.

Looking at the options: A is moderate, J is severe. So 50 would be J: severe depression.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes the BDI-II might have slightly different cutoffs. Oh right, some sources say 0-13 is minimal, 14-24 is mild, 25-37 is moderate, and 38-63 is severe. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 50 would then be severe. Or was the cutoff for moderate higher? Maybe I'm mixing it up.

No, I think the correct cutoffs are 0-13: minimal, 14-19: mild, 20-28: moderate, and 29+: severe. So 50 is definitely in the severe range.

So the correct answer should be J: severe depression.

The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) measures the severity of depression, with scores ranging from 0 to 63. The cutoff points for the categories are as follows:

- 0-13: Minimal or no depression.
- 14-19: Mild depression.

A score of 50 falls into the "severe depression" category.
