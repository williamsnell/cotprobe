Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because equilibrium problems can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: A 2-liter flask at 700 K contains 0.1 mole of CO and a catalyst for the reaction CO(g) + 2H2(g) → CH3OH(g). They add hydrogen until the equilibrium total pressure is 7 atm, and at that point, 0.06 moles of methanol are formed.

Part (a) asks to calculate Kp in atm⁻². Part (b) is about finding the final pressure if the same amounts of CO and H2 are used but without a catalyst, so no reaction occurs.

Let me tackle part (a) first.

I remember that for these kinds of problems, setting up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) is the way to go. So let's think about that.

The reaction is CO + 2 H2 ↔ CH3OH. The initial moles are 0.1 mole of CO and some H2 which they add. But wait, the initial H2 isn't given directly. Hmm, but the problem says hydrogen is introduced until the equilibrium total pressure is 7 atm. So maybe I need to find out how much H2 was added initially.

Wait, but at equilibrium, some of the reactants are consumed to form methanol. Let me denote the changes.

Let me think: Let's let the change be 'x'. So, at equilibrium, CO would have decreased by x, H2 decreased by 2x (because the stoichiometry is 2 moles of H2 per CO), and CH3OH increased by x. But wait, they told us that 0.06 moles of CH3OH were formed. So x is 0.06 moles.

Wait, that can't be right because x would be the amount reacted. If 0.06 moles of CH3OH are formed, then x is 0.06, right? So:

Moles at equilibrium:
CO: 0.1 - 0.06 = 0.04 moles
H2: initial H2 - 2*0.06 = initial H2 - 0.12
CH3OH: 0.06 moles

But wait, I don't know the initial H2. Hmm. I need to find the initial moles of H2. Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of pressure.

Wait, the flask is 2 liters, but since pressure is involved, perhaps I should use partial pressures. The ideal gas law can relate moles and pressure. Since PV = nRT, but since R and T are constants (T is given as 700 K), I can relate moles to pressure.

Alternatively, the total pressure at equilibrium is 7 atm. The total moles at equilibrium would be the sum of moles of all gases. Let me compute that.

Moles at equilibrium:
CO: 0.04
H2: initial H2 - 0.12
CH3OH: 0.06

So total moles = 0.04 + (initial H2 -0.12) + 0.06 = initial H2 - 0.02.

But the flask is 2 liters, so using PV = nRT, but perhaps it's easier to find the total moles from pressure. Wait, the total pressure is 7 atm, and the volume is 2 L, temperature 700 K. So n_total = PV/(RT). Let me compute that.

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. So:

n_total = (7 atm * 2 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 700 K)

Calculating denominator: 0.0821 * 700 ≈ 57.47 atm·L/mol

So n_total = (14) / 57.47 ≈ 0.2435 moles.

But from earlier, n_total is initial H2 - 0.02. So:

initial H2 - 0.02 = 0.2435 → initial H2 = 0.2635 moles.

Wait, that might help. So initial H2 is 0.2635 moles. But wait, I thought I added H2 until the total pressure was 7 atm. So the initial moles before reaction would be initial CO (0.1) + initial H2 (0.2635) = 0.3635 moles. But after reaction, some of them are consumed.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the ICE table correctly.

Wait, the initial setup is: CO is 0.1 moles, H2 is some amount which I just found as 0.2635. So initial:

CO: 0.1
H2: 0.2635
CH3OH: 0

Change: CO decreases by 0.06, H2 decreases by 0.12, CH3OH increases by 0.06.

So equilibrium:

CO: 0.1 - 0.06 = 0.04
H2: 0.2635 - 0.12 = 0.1435
CH3OH: 0.06

Now, the partial pressures can be calculated using PV = nRT → P = nRT/V

Wait, since all are in the same volume and temperature, perhaps I can compute each partial pressure as (n_i) * (RT/V). Alternatively, since Kp is based on partial pressures, I can compute each partial pressure.

But wait, alternatively, since the total pressure is given as 7 atm, perhaps I can compute the mole fractions and then the partial pressures.

Mole fractions: each partial pressure is (n_i / n_total) * P_total.

n_total is 0.04 + 0.1435 + 0.06 = 0.2435 moles. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So:

P_CO = (0.04 / 0.2435) * 7 atm
P_H2 = (0.1435 / 0.2435) *7
P_CH3OH = (0.06 / 0.2435)*7

Let me compute these:

0.04 / 0.2435 ≈ 0.1643 → P_CO ≈ 0.1643 *7 ≈ 1.15 atm.

0.1435 / 0.2435 ≈ 0.589 → P_H2 ≈ 4.12 atm.

0.06 / 0.2435 ≈ 0.2465 → P_CH3OH ≈ 1.7255 atm.

Now, the reaction is CO + 2 H2 ↔ CH3OH. So the Kp expression is (P_CH3OH) / (P_CO * P_H2^2).

So plugging in the numbers:

Kp = (1.7255) / (1.15 * (4.12)^2 )

Compute denominator:

1.15 * (4.12)^2 → 4.12 squared is about 16.97. 1.15 * 16.97 ≈ 19.5055.

So Kp ≈ 1.7255 / 19.5055 ≈ 0.0885 atm^-2.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the first part. Option A is 0.088 atm^-2, and option I is 0.085, option J is 0.090. So 0.0885 is closest to 0.088. So part (a) would be 0.088 atm^-2.

Now part (b): What's the final pressure if same amounts of CO and H2 are used without catalyst, so no reaction occurs.

So CO is 0.1 mole, H2 is 0.2635 mole. Since no reaction, the total moles are 0.1 + 0.2635 = 0.3635 moles.

The volume is 2 liters, temperature 700 K. So using PV = nRT.

P = (n R T) / V.

n is 0.3635 moles. R is 0.0821, T 700.

So P = (0.3635 * 0.0821 * 700) / 2.

Calculating numerator: 0.3635 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.02983; 0.02983 * 700 ≈ 20.881.

Divide by 2: 10.4405 atm.

Looking at the options, option A's part (b) is 10.45, which is very close. Other options: option I's (b) is 10.40, option J is 10.45 as well. Wait, option A and J both have 10.45 in part (b). Wait, let me double-check my calculation.

n = 0.3635. R=0.0821, T=700, V=2.

nRT = 0.3635 * 0.0821 * 700.

0.3635 * 0.0821 = 0.3635 *0.08 is 0.02908, plus 0.3635 *0.0021= ~0.000763. So total ≈ 0.02984.

Multiply by 700: 0.02984 *700 = 20.888.

Divide by V=2: 20.888/2 = 10.444 atm, approx 10.44 atm. So which option has that? Let's look:

Option A: 0.088, 10.45.

Option I: 0.085, 10.40.

Option J: 0.090,10.45.

Hmm, my calculation is 10.44, which is closer to 10.44, so perhaps 10.44 would round to 10.44, but the closest option is 10.45 in A and J.

Wait, but option I has part (b) as 10.40. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial H2 calculation.

Wait, in part (a), I calculated the initial H2 as 0.2635 moles. Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I had:

At equilibrium, n_total is 0.2435. This equals initial H2 - 0.02. So initial H2 is 0.2435 + 0.02 = 0.2635. That seems correct.

Wait, but in part (b), the initial moles are CO=0.1, H2=0.2635, no reaction. So total moles are 0.3635. Then P = (0.3635 *0.0821 * 700)/2.

Wait, let me recalculate that:

0.0821 *700 = 57.47.

0.3635 *57.47 = let's compute that.

0.3 *57.47 = 17.241

0.0635 *57.47 ≈ 0.06 *57.47 =3.4482, 0.0035 *57.47≈0.201. So total ≈3.649.

So 17.241 +3.649= 20.89. Then 20.89/2=10.445 atm. So ~10.445, which is 10.45 when rounded to two decimal places.

So part (b) is 10.45 atm.

So looking at the options, part (a) is 0.088 atm⁻², part (b) is 10.45 atm. So option A is Kp=0.088, P=10.45. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me double-check the Kp calculation because sometimes I might have miscalculated.

Kp = (P_CH3OH) / (P_CO * P_H2² )

I had P_CH3OH ≈1.7255, P_CO≈1.15, P_H2≈4.12.

So 1.15 * (4.12)^2 = 1.15 * 16.9744 ≈ 19.522.

1.7255 /19.522 ≈ 0.0884. So 0.088 atm⁻². Yes.

So part (a) is 0.088, part (b) is 10.45. So option A.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the equilibrium conditions for the reaction:

**CO(g) + 2H₂(g) ⇌ CH₃OH(g)**

### Part (a): Calculate \( K_p \) in atm⁻²

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Initial moles of CO = 0.1 moles.  
   - Hydrogen is added, and the equilibrium total pressure is 7 atm.  
   - At equilibrium, 0.06 moles of CH₃OH are formed.  

2. **Changes in Moles**:  
   Using the stoichiometry of the reaction:  
   - CO decreases by 0.06 moles: \( 0.1 - 0.06 = 0.04 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - H₂ decreases by \( 2 \times 0.06 = 0.12 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - CH₃OH increases by 0.06 moles: \( 0.06 \, \text{moles} \).  

3. **Mole Fractions and Partial Pressures**:  
   The total moles at equilibrium are:  
   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = 0.04 + (n_{\text{H₂,initial}} - 0.12) + 0.06 = n_{\text{H₂,initial}} - 0.02
   \]  
   Using the ideal gas law, the total moles at equilibrium are calculated as:  
   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = \frac{P_{\text{total}} V}{RT} = \frac{7 \cdot 2}{0.0821 \cdot 700} \approx 0.2435 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  
   Solving for \( n_{\text{H₂,initial}} \):  
   \[
   n_{\text{H₂,initial}} - 0.02 = 0.2435 \implies n_{\text{H₂,initial}} = 0.2635 \, \text{moles}.
   \]  

   At equilibrium:  
   - \( n_{\text{CO}} = 0.04 \), \( n_{\text{H₂}} = 0.2635 - 0.12 = 0.1435 \), \( n_{\text{CH₃OH}} = 0.06 \).  

   The partial pressures are calculated using mole fractions:  
   \[
   P_{\text{CO}} = \frac{n_{\text{CO}}}{n_{\text{total}}} \cdot P_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.04}{0.2435} \cdot 7 \approx 1.15 \, \text{atm},
   \]  
   \[
   P_{\text{H₂}} = \frac{n_{\text{H₂}}}{n_{\text{total}}} \cdot P_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.1435}{0.2435} \cdot 7 \approx 4.12 \, \text{atm},
   \]  
   \[
   P_{\text{CH₃OH}} = \frac{n_{\text{CH₃OH}}}{n_{\text{total}}} \cdot P_{\text{total}} = \frac{0.06}{0.2435} \cdot 7 \approx 1.73 \, \text{atm}.
   \]  

4. **Equilibrium Constant Expression**:  
   \[
   K_p = \frac{P_{\text{CH₃OH}}}{P_{\text{CO}} \cdot P_{\text{H₂}}^2} = \frac{1.73}{1.15 \cdot (4.12)^2}.
   \]  
   Calculating the denominator:  
   \[
   1.15 \cdot (4.12)^2 = 1.15 \cdot 16.97 \approx 19.52.
   \]  
   Thus:  
   \[
   K_p = \frac{1.73}{19.52} \approx 0.088 \, \text{atm}^{-2}.
   \]  

### Part (b): Final Pressure Without Reaction

If no reaction occurs, the total moles of gas remain the sum of the initial moles of CO and H₂:  
\[
n_{\text{total}} = 0.1 + 0.2635 = 0.3635 \, \text{moles}.
\]  
Using the ideal gas law:  
\[
P = \frac{n_{\text{total}} RT}{V} = \frac{0.3635 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 700}{2}.
\]  
Calculating:  
\[
P = \frac{0.3635 \cdot 57.47}{2} = \frac{20.89}{2} \approx 10.45 \, \text{atm}.
\]  

### Final Answer

- Part (a): \( K_p = 0.088 \, \text{atm}^{-2} \)  
- Part (b): Final pressure = \( 10.45 \, \text{atm} \)  

The correct option is **A**.
