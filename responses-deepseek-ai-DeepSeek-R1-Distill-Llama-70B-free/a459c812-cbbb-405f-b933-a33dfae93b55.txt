Question:

A landlord owned a three-story home in fee simple and leased it to his friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises. In an action by the new owner against the student to recover the additional $100 for rent due, he will most probably

Options:

A: recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.
B: not recover, because the professor remains liable.
C: recover, because the new owner inherited all rights and responsibilities from the original landlord.
D: recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.
E: not recover, because the student is not directly responsible to the new owner.
F: not recover, because the student was not in privity of contract with the new owner.
G: not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.
H: not recover, because the professor is the one who subleased to the student.
I: recover, because the student is in direct violation of his sublease agreement.
J: recover, because the student defaulted on his rental payment.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about landlord-tenant law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the setup is that a landlord owns a three-story home and leased it to his friend for 10 years. The lease says the friend has to pay $300 a month and the taxes. Also, the lease prohibits assigning or subleasing without permission. The friend lives there for two years, then assigns the lease to a professor without permission, even though he owes three months' rent. The assignment says the professor will pay the $300 rent but doesn't mention taxes. The landlord didn't object to this assignment.

Then, six months later, the landlord sells the property to a new owner. The professor lives there for a year and then subleases the third floor to a student for two years, getting $100 a month. The student pays for six months, then stops. The professor sends the new owner $200 and tells him to get the remaining $100 from the student, but the student won't leave. Now, the new owner sues the student for the extra $100.

The question is whether the new owner can recover that $100. The options are A through J.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the original lease between the landlord and the friend. The lease prohibits assignment or subletting, but the friend assigned it to the professor anyway. Generally, if a lease prohibits assignment, the tenant can't assign without the landlord's consent. But here, the landlord didn't object. Wait, but does the landlord's silence count as consent? Or does the assignment still violate the lease?

I think that if the lease prohibits assignment, any assignment without consent is a breach. But if the landlord doesn't object, maybe it's treated as consent. Or perhaps, the landlord's inaction could be seen as acquiescence, making the assignment valid despite the lease terms.

Wait, but the assignment was done by the tenant (the friend) to the professor. The landlord didn't consent explicitly but also didn't object. So is the assignment valid? Or is it that the friend breached the lease by assigning without consent, but the landlord's inaction might have some implications.

But the lease's terms are between the landlord and the friend. The friend assigns to the professor. So the professor becomes the new tenant, but does that make the professor a tenant of the original landlord, or is it considered a new tenancy? Wait, when a tenant assigns, the assignee (professor) takes over the tenant's interest. So the lease's terms still apply, including the $300 rent and the taxes.

But in the assignment, the professor only agreed to pay the $300, not the taxes. So that could be an issue. But the landlord didn't object, so maybe the landlord is deemed to have accepted the assignment, making the professor the new tenant, but only on the terms of the assignment. Or does the original lease's terms still bind the professor?

Wait, under property law, when a lease is assigned, the assignee takes subject to all the terms of the original lease. So the professor would be responsible for both the rent and the taxes, unless the landlord agrees otherwise. But in this case, the assignment only mentions the rent, not the taxes. So perhaps the landlord's acceptance of the assignment without objection could be seen as modifying the lease terms, waiving the tax obligation. Or maybe the friend is still on the hook for the taxes.

But I'm not sure. Let's move on.

Then, the landlord conveys the property to a new owner. So the new owner steps into the landlord's shoes. They would have all the same rights and obligations as the original landlord under the lease. So if the lease was assigned to the professor, the new owner would collect rent from the professor.

Then, the professor subleases part of the property (third floor) to a student. The sublease is for two years at $100 a month. So the professor is now a sublessor, and the student is a sublessee.

The student pays for six months, then defaults. The professor sends the new owner $200 and tells him to get the remaining $100 from the student. But the student refuses to leave.

The new owner sues the student for the additional $100. The question is whether he can recover.

So the issue is: is the student liable to the new owner?

I think the key here is the concept of privity. Privity of estate refers to the legal relationship between parties in a lease. So, the original lease is between the landlord and the tenant (friend). When the friend assigns to the professor, the professor becomes the tenant, so there's privity between the landlord and the professor. Then, when the professor subleases to the student, the student becomes a subtenant, but the original lease is between the landlord (now new owner) and the professor. The student's lease is with the professor, not directly with the new owner.

So in this case, the new owner's direct tenant is the professor, not the student. The student is a subtenant, so the new owner isn't in privity with the student. Therefore, the new owner can't directly sue the student for rent unless there's an agreement that brings them into privity.

Wait, but sometimes when a sublessee is in possession, the landlord can treat them as a tenant if they've accepted rent or otherwise recognized the sublease. But in this case, the new owner didn't agree to the sublease. The original lease prohibited assignments and subleases without consent. The friend assigned without consent, but the landlord didn't object, so the assignment to the professor might be valid, but the sublease to the student would require the landlord's consent, which wasn't given.

Wait, the original lease prohibits assignment or subletting. So the professor, as the assignee, can't sublease without the landlord's consent. But if the professor did sublease without consent, that's a breach. But does that affect the new owner's ability to collect from the student?

Alternatively, the new owner can't go after the student because there's no privity between them. The student's obligation is to the professor, not the new owner. So the professor would be the one to sue the student for unpaid rent, and the new owner would have to go after the professor for the $300 minus whatever the professor paid.

Wait, but the professor paid $200 to the new owner. The new owner is seeking the remaining $100 from the student. But the student's obligation is to the professor, not the new owner. So the new owner can't recover directly from the student because there's no privity of contract or estate between them.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says the new owner won't recover because the professor remains liable. That makes sense because the professor is the tenant, and the new owner can't go after the subtenant unless there's a direct agreement or the new owner has taken some action to establish privity.

Option F says the new owner can't recover because the student isn't in privity of contract. That also seems right.

Wait, but sometimes, under the doctrine of privity of estate, the landlord can hold the subtenant liable if they've accepted rent directly or if the subtenant has attorned to the landlord. Did the professor send $200 to the new owner and tell the new owner to collect $100 from the student? Does that mean the new owner accepted partial payment, which could imply recognition of the sublease?

But the student didn't pay the new owner directly; the professor sent $200. The student isn't paying the new owner, so maybe the new owner hasn't established privity with the student.

So the new owner's options are against the professor for the full $300. The professor, in turn, can go after the student for the $100, but the new owner can't directly claim from the student.

So in the action against the student, the new owner can't recover because the student isn't liable to him. Therefore, the correct answer would be either B or F.

Looking back, option B says the new owner won't recover because the professor remains liable. Option F says it's because there's no privity of contract.

I think both B and F are pointing towards the same idea, but the precise reason is about privity. The new owner and the student aren't in privity, so the new owner can't sue the student directly. So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but wait another point. When the new owner received $200 from the professor, that's for the $300 rent. The professor is still $100 short. The professor then tells the new owner to collect the remaining $100 from the student. But the student didn't pay that. So the professor is in breach for not paying the full $300, but the student's obligation is to the professor, not the new owner.

So the new owner can't go after the student because they're not in privity. The new owner's remedy is against the professor for the $100 still owed. Therefore, the new owner can't recover from the student.

Looking at the options again:

A: recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.

But he didn't object, but that doesn't establish privity with the student.

B: not recover, because the professor remains liable.

This is about the professor's liability, which is correct.

F: not recover, because the student is not in privity of contract with the new owner.

Also correct, but I think the reason is that there's no privity between the new owner and the student.

So which is the better option? The question is about why the new owner can't recover. The reason is that the student isn't liable to the new owner because there's no privity. So the answer is F.

Wait, but let me think again. Another angle: when a tenant subleases, the sublessee may be liable to the original landlord if the landlord has accepted the sublessee as a tenant. But in this case, the new owner didn't agree to the sublease. So the student isn't directly liable to the new owner.

So yes, the correct answer is F. The new owner can't recover because the student isn't in privity of contract with him.

The question revolves around landlord-tenant law, specifically focusing on the concepts of lease assignments, subleases, and privity of contract. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Original Lease**: The landlord leased the property to the friend for 10 years, with terms requiring the friend to pay $300 monthly rent and taxes. The lease prohibited assignment or subleasing without consent.

2. **Assignment to Professor**: The friend assigned the lease to the professor without the landlord's explicit consent, violating the lease terms. However, the landlord did not object, which could be interpreted as acquiescence, potentially validating the assignment. The professor agreed to pay the $300 rent but not the taxes.

3. **New Owner**: The landlord sold the property to a new owner, who stepped into the landlord's shoes, inheriting the rights and obligations under the lease.

4. **Sublease to Student**: The professor subleased the third floor to the student for $100 monthly. The original lease prohibited subleasing without consent, and the new owner did not consent to this sublease.

5. **Default and Payment**: The student paid for six months but then defaulted. The professor sent the new owner $200 and directed the new owner to collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate.

6. **Legal Issue**: The new owner sued the student for the additional $100. The key issue is whether the new owner can recover directly from the student.

**Analysis of Options**:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The new owner’s failure to object to the sublease does not establish privity of contract or estate with the student, so the new owner cannot recover from the student.

- **Option B**: Partially correct. The professor remains liable for the full $300 rent, but this does not address the specific reason why the new owner cannot recover from the student.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the new owner inherited the landlord’s rights, this does not create privity of contract or estate with the student.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no privity of estate between the new owner and the student.

- **Option E**: Incorrect. The student is not directly responsible to the new owner because there is no privity of contract.

- **Option F**: Correct. The student is not in privity of contract with the new owner, so the new owner cannot recover directly from the student.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the professor is liable, this does not explain why the new owner cannot recover from the student.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. The sublease does not create liability for the student to the new owner.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The student’s violation of the sublease agreement does not create liability to the new owner.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. The student’s default does not create liability to the new owner.

**Conclusion**: The new owner cannot recover the additional $100 from the student because there is no privity of contract between them. The student’s obligation is solely to the professor under the sublease agreement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: not recover, because the student is not in privity of contract with the new owner.**
