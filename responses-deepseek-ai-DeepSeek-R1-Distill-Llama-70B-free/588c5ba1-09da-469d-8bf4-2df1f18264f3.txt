Question:

A defendant is on trial for possession of heroin. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, a police officer testifies that he watched another officer seize a bag of white powder from the defendant and seal it in an envelope, which both officers initialed and dated and then placed in the police property room. The prosecutor then calls a chemist to testify that she obtained, intact from the property room, the dated, sealed envelope with the initials of both police officers, whose handwriting she recognized police officers, whose handwriting she recognized from previous experience, and that testing disclosed that the powder therein was heroin. The defendant argues that the prosecutor has not sufficiently authenticated the powder tested by the chemist as the powder that was seized from the defendant. Is the chemist's testimony admissible?

Options:

A: No, unless the envelope and powder are produced in court or their absence is explained.
B: Yes, because the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting is sufficient authentication.
C: No, because the chemist did not personally witness the seizure of the powder.
D: No, because the chemist did not directly receive the envelope from the police officers.
E: Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.
F: Yes, because an object in official custody is self-authenticating.
G: Yes, because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed by the officers.
H: No, because the chemist lacks firsthand knowledge that the powder came from the defendant.
I: No, because there is no proof that the powder in the envelope is the same powder that was seized.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about the admissibility of a chemist's testimony. Let me go through it step by step.

The scenario is a defendant on trial for possession of heroin. During the prosecution's case, a police officer testified that he watched another officer seize a bag of white powder from the defendant. They sealed it in an envelope, both initialed and dated it, and placed it in the police property room. Then, the prosecutor called a chemist who said she obtained the envelope intact from the property room. The envelope was sealed, had the officers' initials and date, and she recognized their handwriting from previous cases. She tested the powder, which was heroin.

The defendant argues that the prosecutor hasn't sufficiently authenticated the powder as the same one seized. The question is whether the chemist's testimony is admissible.

I remember that authentication is about proving that the evidence is what it's claimed to be. For physical evidence, the prosecution needs to show a chain of custody or a reasonable assurance that the item hasn't been tampered with or altered.

In this case, the envelope was sealed, initialed, and dated by the officers. The chemist recognized their handwriting, so she can attest that the envelope she tested was the same one they handled. The fact that it was kept in the police property room and she received it intact suggests that the chain of custody is intact.

Wait, but what about the rules of evidence? Under FRE 901, the requirement is that the proponent must prove that the evidence is authentic. Here, the envelope was sealed with initials and dates, and the chemist recognized the officers' handwriting, which should be sufficient. There's no indication that the envelope was tampered with or mishandled. The fact that it was in official custody supports that it's self-authenticating, but I'm not sure about that point.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no unless the envelope and powder are produced or absence explained. But here, the envelope was produced, right? The chemist had it, tested it, so the physical evidence is there. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B says yes because the chemist recognized the handwriting. That seems relevant because it ensures the envelope is the same one the officers handled. So B could be a possibility.

Option E says yes because the powder is sufficiently identified as coming from the defendant. I think that's the case because the chain of custody is established through the officers' initials and the chemist's recognition.

Option F mentions that an object in official custody is self-authenticating. I'm not sure about that. I think some items, like public records, are self-authenticating, but physical evidence usually requires some showing, like the chain here.

Option G says yes because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed. That aligns with the facts and the authentication process, so G is a contender.

Option I says no, no proof the powder is the same. But the chain of custody via the envelope and initials should provide that proof.

Wait, what about the best evidence rule? The defendant is arguing authentication, not best evidence. The best evidence rule would require the original if the content is in question, but here it's about authentication, so maybe that's a separate issue.

Putting it together, the chemist's testimony is admissible because the envelope's integrity and the chain of custody are established through the officers' initials, the seal, and the chemist's recognition. So options B, E, F, G, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: under FRE 901(b)(2), a document can be authenticated by a non-expert on the basis of familiar handwriting. The chemist recognized the officers' handwriting, which supports the envelope's authenticity. Then, the contents (the powder) are linked through the sealed envelope. So the chemist can testify about the contents because the envelope was properly identified.

So the answer would be that the chemist's testimony is admissible. Looking at the options, B says yes because the chemist recognized the handwriting. G says yes because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed.

But wait, is the chemist's recognition sufficient? Or does the fact that the envelope was sealed and initialed also play a role? I think both factors contribute. So perhaps option G is better because it's about the envelope being properly sealed and initialed, which is a key factor in authentication.

Alternatively, option E says the powder is sufficiently identified. But why? Because the envelope's integrity is maintained, so the contents are linked. So E might also be a possibility.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between B and G. Let me think again. The chemist's testimony is about the envelope being the same because of the handwriting. The envelope's condition (sealed and initialed) supports that the contents haven't been tampered with. So both factors are present.

So the correct answer should be either B or G. But looking back, the question is whether the chemist's testimony is admissible. The chemist's testimony includes her recognition of the handwriting, which authenticates the envelope, and thus the contents. So B might be the right answer because it directly addresses the authentication method.

Alternatively, another approach: the chemist's testimony is based on sufficient authentication because the envelope was properly handled (sealed, initialed, etc.), so G might be correct.

Wait, but the key is that the chemist can testify that the envelope she tested is the same as the one the officers seized because she recognized their handwriting. So without producing the officers, the chemist's testimony authenticates the envelope, making the contents admissible. So B would be correct.

But I'm a bit unsure. Another way to think: under the rules, you can authenticate through the chain of custody. Here, the chain is police officers -> property room -> chemist. Each step is accounted for. The envelope's seals and initials ensure it wasn't tampered with. The chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting further confirms that the envelope she tested is the same one the officers handled. So the authentication is sufficient, making the chemist's testimony admissible.

Looking again at the options:

Option B: Yes, because the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting is sufficient authentication.

Option G: Yes, because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed.

Which one is more accurate? I think both factors contribute, but the key authentication comes from the chemist's recognition. Alternatively, proper sealing and initialing is enough for authentication, even without the chemist knowing their handwriting, but in this case, she does know, making it stronger.

Wait, but maybe the correct answer is E: Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.

Hmm, but E is more about the chain of custody linking back to the defendant, which is established through the officers' seizure. The authentication of the envelope ensures that the tested powder is the same as seized.

I think the best answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B because the authentication is done through the handwriting.

Wait, another point: the chemist's testimony is that she received the envelope intact, which was sealed and had the officers' initials. She recognized their handwriting. So the envelope's authenticity is established, and so the contents (the powder) are linked. So the chemist's testimony is admissible because the envelope was properly authenticated, which in turn authenticates the powder.

So looking at the options, E says yes because the powder is sufficiently identified as coming from the defendant. That seems correct because the chain of custody is established through the envelope.

But then, option G says yes because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed. That also seems correct.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is E. Because the question is whether the chemist's testimony is admissible, and the issue is whether the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant. The chemist's testimony, along with the officer's, establishes that chain. So E would be correct.

Alternatively, some sources say that when an object is in official custody and is produced from a secure place, it's sufficiently authenticated. So maybe F is correct, which says yes because an object in official custody is self-authenticating. But I'm not sure if that's a recognized exception. I think FRE 901 allows for various methods, including official custody as a factor, but it's not self-authenticating per se.

Wait, I think the correct answer is E. The chemist's testimony is admissible because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant through the chain of custody established by the officers' seizure, the sealed envelope, and the chemist's recognition of the officers' initials. So E is correct.

But wait, the options: E is "Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant." That seems to align with the reasoning that the chain of custody is established, so the powder is authenticated.

Alternatively, some might argue that the best evidence rule requires the original, but that's not the issue here. The issue is authentication, which is satisfied.

So, I think the correct answer is E. But I'm a bit torn because other options seem plausible too.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a chemist's testimony regarding the authentication of heroin seized from a defendant. The key issue is whether the prosecution sufficiently authenticated the powder tested by the chemist as the same powder seized from the defendant. 

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: This suggests that the chemist's testimony is inadmissible unless the envelope and powder are produced in court or their absence is explained. However, the facts indicate that the envelope was produced and tested by the chemist, so this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: This argues that the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting is sufficient authentication. While the chemist's recognition of the handwriting supports the authenticity of the envelope, the admissibility of the testimony also depends on the chain of custody and the integrity of the sealed envelope. Thus, this option is incomplete.

3. **Option C**: This claims that the chemist's testimony is inadmissible because she did not personally witness the seizure. However, the chemist's role is to test the evidence, not to witness the seizure, so this option is irrelevant.

4. **Option D**: This argues that the chemist did not directly receive the envelope from the police officers. However, the envelope was stored in the police property room, and the chemist retrieved it intact, maintaining the chain of custody. This option is incorrect.

5. **Option E**: This states that the chemist's testimony is admissible because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant. The chain of custody, established through the officers' seizure, the sealed and initialed envelope, and the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting, links the powder to the defendant. This option aligns with the facts and is a strong candidate.

6. **Option F**: This suggests that the object is self-authenticating because it is in official custody. While official custody supports the chain of custody, physical evidence like this typically requires additional authentication, such as the sealed envelope and recognized handwriting. This option is incorrect.

7. **Option G**: This argues that the envelope was properly sealed and initialed by the officers, which supports authentication. While this is true, the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting further strengthens the authentication. This option is partially correct but does not fully address the issue.

8. **Option H**: This claims that the chemist lacks firsthand knowledge that the powder came from the defendant. However, the chemist's testimony is based on the authenticated envelope and its contents, which are sufficient for admissibility. This option is incorrect.

9. **Option I**: This argues that there is no proof that the powder in the envelope is the same as the seized powder. However, the sealed and initialed envelope, combined with the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting, provides sufficient proof. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The chemist's testimony is admissible because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant through the established chain of custody. The sealed and initialed envelope, combined with the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting, ensures the authenticity of the evidence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.**
