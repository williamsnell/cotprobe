Okay, so I have this problem where James Higley deposits $2,000 for 2 years in an account that pays 4% per year, compounded quarterly. I need to find out how much money will accumulate, assuming he doesn't withdraw any interest. Hmm, I remember that compound interest formulas are involved here.

Wait, compound interest... right, the formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Where A is the amount after time t, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. 

So let's break down the given information. The principal P is $2,000. The rate r is 4%, which as a decimal is 0.04. It's compounded quarterly, so n is 4. The time t is 2 years.

Plugging these into the formula: A = 2000*(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*2). Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 0.04 divided by 4 is 0.01. Then, 4 times 2 is 8. So the exponent part is (1.01)^8.

Now, I need to compute (1.01)^8. I'm not exactly sure the exact value, but I can approximate it. Let me think, 1.01^2 is 1.0201. Then, 1.0201 squared is about 1.04060401 for the 4th power. Then, the 8th power would be (1.04060401)^2, which is approximately 1.082856. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula step by step. Let me compute (1.01)^8:

1st power: 1.01
2nd: 1.0201
3rd: 1.030301
4th: 1.04060401
5th: 1.05101005
6th: 1.06152015
7th: 1.07213535
8th: 1.08285670

Wait, wait, wait. No, that's incorrect. Because each step is multiplying by 1.01. Let me recalculate:

1.01^1 = 1.01
1.01^2 = 1.01 * 1.01 = 1.0201
1.01^3 = 1.0201 * 1.01 = 1.030301
1.01^4 = 1.030301 * 1.01 ≈ 1.04060401
1.01^5 = 1.04060401 * 1.01 ≈ 1.05101005
1.01^6 = 1.05101005 * 1.01 ≈ 1.06152015
1.01^7 = 1.06152015 * 1.01 ≈ 1.07213535
1.01^8 = 1.07213535 * 1.01 ≈ 1.08285670 approximately.

Wait, but actually, I think I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Because when n is 4 and t is 2, the exponent is 8, but let me double-check: 4 times 2 is indeed 8, so 8 periods.

So A = 2000 * 1.082856 ≈ 2000 * 1.082856. Let me compute that.

2000 * 1.08 is 2160. 2000 * 0.002856 is 5.712. So total is 2160 + 5.712 = 2165.712. So approximately $2,165.71.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is $2,165.71. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 1.01^8 more accurately. Alternatively, I can use logarithms or known exponentials, but perhaps I should just calculate it step by step.

Wait, another way: (1.01)^8 = e^(8 * ln(1.01)).

Calculating ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995033. So 8 * 0.00995033 ≈ 0.0796026.

e^0.0796026 ≈ 1.082857. So that's consistent with what I had earlier.

So A = 2000 * 1.082857 ≈ 2000 * 1.082857. Let's compute exactly.

2000 * 1 = 2000
2000 * 0.08 = 160
2000 * 0.002857 = 5.714
Adding them up: 2000 + 160 = 2160, plus 5.714 gives 2165.714. So approximately $2,165.71. Which matches option I.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I is 2,165.71. So that must be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with exact calculation.

Another approach: compute each compounding period.

Principal: $2000.

Each quarter, the amount increases by 1% (since 4% annually, so 1% per quarter).

There are 8 compounding periods (2 years * 4).

Compute the amount after each quarter:

Initial: 2000

After 1st quarter: 2000 * 1.01 = 2020
After 2nd: 2020 * 1.01 = 2040.20
After 3rd: 2040.20 *1.01= 2061.002
After 4th: 2061.002 *1.01 ≈ 2082.30 (approx)
After 5th: 2082.30 *1.01 ≈ 2104.133
After 6th: 2104.133 *1.01 ≈ 2127.0
Wait, let me compute each step more accurately.

1. After 1st quarter: 2000 * 1.01 = 2020.00
2. 2nd: 2020 * 1.01 = 2020 + 20.20 = 2040.20
3. 3rd: 2040.20 * 1.01 = 2040.20 + 20.402 = 2060.602
4. 4th: 2060.602 * 1.01 = 
Let me compute 2060.602 * 0.01 = 20.60602, so 2060.602 +20.60602=2081.20802
5. 5th: 2081.20802 * 1.01 = 2081.20802 + 20.8120802 ≈ 2102.0201
Wait, 2081.20802 *1.01:

Calculate 2081.20802 * 1.01 = 2081.20802 + 20.8120802 = 2102.020102

6. 6th: 2102.020102 * 1.01 = 2102.020102 +21.02020102=2123.04030 approximately.

7. 7th: 2123.0403 *1.01= 2123.0403 +21.230403=2144.270703

8. 8th: 2144.270703 *1.01= 2144.270703 +21.44270703=2165.71341

So after 8 quarters, the amount is approximately $2,165.71, which matches option I.

So the correct answer should be option I.

To determine how much James Higley's $2,000 deposit will accumulate in 2 years with an annual interest rate of 4%, compounded quarterly, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \(P = 2000\) (principal amount),
- \(r = 0.04\) (annual interest rate),
- \(n = 4\) (compounded quarterly),
- \(t = 2\) (time in years).

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 2000 \left(1 + \frac{0.04}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 2}
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{0.04}{4} = 0.01\), and \(4 \cdot 2 = 8\). The formula becomes:

\[
A = 2000 \left(1.01\right)^8
\]

Next, compute \((1.01)^8\). Using iterative multiplication:

\[
(1.01)^2 = 1.0201, \quad (1.01)^4 = (1.0201)^2 \approx 1.04060401, \quad (1.01)^8 = (1.04060401)^2 \approx 1.082856.
\]

Thus:

\[
A = 2000 \cdot 1.082856 \approx 2165.71.
\]

This matches option **I**, which is $2,165.71.
