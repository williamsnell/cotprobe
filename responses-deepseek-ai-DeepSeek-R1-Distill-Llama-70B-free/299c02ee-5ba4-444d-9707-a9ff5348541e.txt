Question:

A state built a racetrack that was specially designed and constructed for thoroughbred horseracing. State bonds were issued to finance the construction of the racetrack. The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the racetrack was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. After the racetrack was built and in operation for two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for the discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law is probably

Options:

A: unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.
B: constitutional, because it supports social welfare by providing discounts to senior citizens.
C: unconstitutional, because it discriminates on the basis of age.
D: constitutional, because the state has the power to change admission prices.
E: unconstitutional, because it violates the rights of the bondholders.
F: unconstitutional, because it goes against the state's responsibility to repay bonds.
G: constitutional, because the state has the right to regulate commerce within its borders.
H: unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.
I: unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.
J: constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read through it again carefully. The question is about a state that built a racetrack using bond money. The bond agreement had specific terms: for the first five years, $2 from each admission would go to repay the bonds. If after five years they hadn't repaid enough, then $1 from each admission in the next five years would be used. 

Now, after two years of operation, the state legislature passes a law letting senior citizens (over 65) in for a discounted 50-cent admission. The question is whether this law is constitutional. The options are from A to J, each providing a different constitutional argument.

Hmm, so the main issue here is whether the state can change the admission fees after the bonds were issued, and whether this affects the bondholders' rights.

I remember that when states issue bonds, they create a contractual obligation. The contract clause in the Constitution (Article I, Section 10) says states can't pass laws impairing the obligation of contracts. So if the state's action here impairs the bondholders' contract, it might be unconstitutional.

In this case, the state built the racetrack with bonds, and the bond agreement tied repayment to a portion of the admission fees. By reducing the admission fee for seniors, the state is taking in less money, which might affect the amount available to repay the bonds. So if the total revenue from admissions goes down because seniors are paying less, there's less money to repay the bondholders. 

The key here is whether the state's action impairs the contract with the bondholders. The contract was that a certain amount from each admission would go to repay the bonds. If the state changes the admission structure in a way that reduces the revenue, they might be impairing the contract.

I think about the case of United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey (1977). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a state could not impair a contractual obligation unless it had a legitimate public purpose and the impairment was reasonable and necessary. So even if the state's law serves a public purpose, like helping seniors, it might still be an unconstitutional impairment if it's not justified.

In our scenario, the state is changing the admission fees, which directly affects the revenue stream promised to bondholders. This could be considered an impairment. The question is whether the state's action is justified. The law here benefits seniors, which is a social welfare purpose, but does that outweigh the contractual obligations to bondholders?

Another angle is whether the state has the authority to regulate the racetrack's operations. Since the state built the racetrack, maybe they have the right to set admission prices. But the bond agreement was a contract, and changing the terms without consent would be problematic.

So looking at the options:

Option I says it's unconstitutional because it impairs the bondholders' contract. That aligns with the Contract Clause analysis.

Option E says unconstitutional because it violates bondholders' rights. That's similar to I, but I think I is more specific about the contract impairment.

Option F says unconstitutional because it goes against the state's responsibility to repay bonds. That's more about state responsibility, but the legal issue is the impairment of contract.

Option B and D talk about the state's power to change prices or support social welfare. But the problem is the contract was already in place, so the state's power might be limited by the Contract Clause.

So the correct answer is probably I: unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.

The question revolves around whether a state law reducing admission fees for senior citizens at a racetrack violates the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The racetrack was financed through state bonds with a contractual agreement that a portion of admission fees would repay the bondholders. The state's subsequent law lowering admission prices for seniors could reduce revenue, potentially impairing the bondholders' ability to be repaid as contracted.

The Contract Clause (Article I, Section 10) prohibits states from passing laws that impair contractual obligations unless there is a legitimate public purpose and the impairment is reasonable and necessary. While the law benefits seniors, a social welfare purpose, it may still be unconstitutional if it significantly reduces the revenue promised to bondholders without sufficient justification.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** correctly identifies the issue as an unconstitutional impairment of the bondholders' contract under the Contract Clause.
- Other options, such as E and F, address related concerns but are less precise than I in identifying the specific constitutional violation.

Thus, the law is unconstitutional because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.
