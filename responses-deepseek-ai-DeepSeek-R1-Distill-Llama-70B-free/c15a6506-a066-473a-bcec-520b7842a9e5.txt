Okay, so I've got this question about the P/E ratio, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what I remember about P/E ratios. I think P/E stands for Price to Earnings ratio. It's a measure that investors use to evaluate a company's valuation.

The question says Company A is trading at $150 per share, and the earnings per share (EPS) are $10. We need to find the P/E ratio. From what I remember, the P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the price per share by the earnings per share. So the formula should be P/E = Price per Share / EPS.

Let me write that down. Price per Share is $150, and EPS is $10. So plugging in those numbers, it would be 150 divided by 10. Hmm, doing that math... 150 divided by 10 is 15. So the P/E ratio should be 15.0.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. I've heard people sometimes confuse it with other ratios. P/E is definitely price divided by earnings, right? Like, it's how much you're paying for each dollar of earnings. So yes, 150 divided by 10 makes sense. That gives a P/E of 15, which would mean the company is trading at 15 times its earnings.

Looking at the options, option A is 15.0. So that should be the correct answer. Let me glance over the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option C is 5.0, which would be if I did 10 divided by 2, but that's not the case here. Option J is 10.0, which would be if price was 100 and EPS 10, but that's not the numbers given. So yeah, I think option A is correct.

The P/E ratio is calculated as the price per share divided by the earnings per share. Given that the stock price is $150 and EPS is $10, the P/E ratio is 150 / 10 = 15.0.
