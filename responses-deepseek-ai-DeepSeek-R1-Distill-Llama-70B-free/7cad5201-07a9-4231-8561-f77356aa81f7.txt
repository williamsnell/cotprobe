Question:

Three partners - Alton, Birch, and Castor - invested $4,000, $5,000, and $11,000, respectively, in a retail hardware store. The net profit for a recent year was $15,000. If profits are to be shared in proportion to each man's investment, what amount of money should Birch receive?

Options:

A: $3,000
B: $6,000
C: $5,250
D: $3,500
E: $3,750
F: $4,500
G: $4,250
H: $5,000
I: $4,000
J: $2,500

Okay, so I have this problem about three partners who invested different amounts into a hardware store, and I need to figure out how much Birch should get from the profits. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the partners are Alton, Birch, and Castor. Their investments are $4,000, $5,000, and $11,000 respectively. The total profit for the year is $15,000, and they want to split this based on their investment proportions.

Wait, so the profits are shared in proportion to each person's investment. That probably means each person gets a percentage of the profit equal to their investment divided by the total investment.

Let me get the total investment first. So adding up all three: 4,000 plus 5,000 is 9,000, and then plus 11,000 makes 20,000. So total investment is $20,000.

Now, Birch's investment is $5,000. So his share would be (5,000 / 20,000) of the $15,000 profit. Let me calculate that.

5,000 divided by 20,000 is the same as 5/20, which simplifies to 1/4. So 1/4 of 15,000 is... let's do the math. 15,000 divided by 4 is 3,750. So Birch should get $3,750.

Wait, let me double-check that. Total investment is 4k +5k +11k =20k. Birch has 5k, so 5/20 is 1/4. 1/4 of 15k is 3,750. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options, E is $3,750. So the answer should be E.

To determine Birch's share of the profits, we first calculate the total investment by adding the individual investments:

\[
\text{Total Investment} = \$4,000 + \$5,000 + \$11,000 = \$20,000
\]

Birch's investment is \$5,000, so his proportion of the total investment is:

\[
\text{Birch's Proportion} = \frac{\$5,000}{\$20,000} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

The total profit is \$15,000. Birch's share of the profit is therefore:

\[
\text{Birch's Share} = \frac{1}{4} \times \$15,000 = \$3,750
\]

Thus, Birch should receive \$3,750. The correct answer is:

**E: \$3,750**

Answer: E
