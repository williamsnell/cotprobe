Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Cicero's views on immorality and expediency. I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, and he had some ideas about natural law and morality. 

The question is asking me to fill in the blanks: According to Cicero, immorality is __________, and expediency is __________. The options are from A to J, and each option pairs two phrases. 

I think I need to recall what Cicero believed about nature and how immorality and expediency fit into that. From what I remember, Cicero was a Stoic, or at least influenced by Stoic thought, which emphasizes living in accordance with nature. So, he probably believed that moral behavior aligns with nature.

Wait, but the question is about immorality, not morality. So if morality is in accord with nature, then immorality must be the opposite. That would mean immorality is repugnant to nature, right? Because if something is moral, it's in line with nature, so immorality would go against it.

Now, what about expediency? Expediency usually refers to what's practical or advantageous, but not necessarily what's morally right. So in terms of Cicero's philosophy, which values moral behavior aligned with nature, expediency without moral consideration might be seen as contrary to nature. But wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe he thought that true expediency, in the long run, aligns with nature because it's sustainable. Or perhaps he saw expediency as being in conflict with natural law if it's just about short-term gains without considering moral implications.

Wait, another angle: I remember that Cicero discussed the idea that "the good" is what is in accordance with nature. So actions that are good are in line with nature, and bad actions are against it. So immorality would be repugnant to nature. For expediency, if it's about being practical but not necessarily moral, then maybe it's indifferent to nature. Or perhaps he saw expediency as being in conflict if it's pursued without regard to moral principles.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the specific terms. The options use phrases like "repugnant to Nature," "in accord with Nature," and "indifferent to Nature." So for immorality, it's repugnant. What about expediency? If expediency is about doing what's advantageous, maybe he saw it as being in accord with nature if it's aligned with the common good. Or perhaps he thought that expediency is just practical and doesn't necessarily oppose nature, making it indifferent.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because if expediency is about self-interest without considering others, it might go against the natural law which emphasizes the common good. So perhaps expediency is also repugnant to nature. But that would mean both blanks are "repugnant," which is option G. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, let me think again. I think in Cicero's De Officiis (On Duties), he discusses how moral actions are those that are in harmony with nature. He also talks about the conflict between the honestum (moral) and the utile (useful or expedient). He argues that sometimes people think that what is expedient might conflict with what is morally right, but in reality, the truly expedient in the long run is what is morally good. Or perhaps he says that the expedient cannot be separated from the moral. Hmm, maybe that's the case.

Wait, no, in Book 1, Cicero says that the moral is the only thing that's truly useful because it leads to the greatest good for the greatest number. So if something is expedient, it's actually in line with nature because it's serving the common good. So that would mean that expediency is in accord with nature.

Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Because sometimes, the expedient action might seem beneficial in the short term but not align with moral principles. But according to Cicero, he might argue that true expediency is only that which aligns with nature and morality. So perhaps he believes that expediency is in accord with nature because it serves the greater good.

So, putting it together: immorality is repugnant to nature, and expediency is in accord with nature. So looking at the options, which one matches that?

Looking at the options:

Option D: repugnant to Nature; in accord with Nature.

Yes, that fits. So the answer would be D.

Wait, let me double-check. Another approach: the question is about immorality and expediency. So according to Cicero, immorality is against nature (repugnant), and expediency is in line with nature (in accord). So yes, option D is correct.

According to Cicero, immorality is repugnant to Nature, and expediency is in accord with Nature. This aligns with his belief that moral actions are in harmony with nature, while immorality contradicts it. Additionally, he argued that true expediency, when aligned with the common good, is consistent with natural law.

Answer: D
