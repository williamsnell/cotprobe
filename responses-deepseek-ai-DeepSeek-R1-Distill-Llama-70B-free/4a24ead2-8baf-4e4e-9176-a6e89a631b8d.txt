Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Ms. Perez driving miles over several days. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says she drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days. And each day she drove the same number of miles. So I need to find out how many miles she drove each day.

Alright, so total miles is 40, and the time period is 5 days. Since she drove the same amount each day, I think I can use division here. Dividing the total miles by the number of days should give me the daily mileage. So that would be 40 miles divided by 5 days.

Let me do the calculation. 40 divided by 5 is... let me think. 5 times 8 is 40, right? So 40 divided by 5 equals 8. So each day she drove 8 miles. 

Wait, let me double-check that. If she drove 8 miles each day for 5 days, then 8 times 5 should be 40. Yep, that adds up. 8 plus 8 is 16, plus another 8 is 24, another 8 is 32, and one more 8 makes 40. Perfect, that makes sense. 

So looking at the options, I need to find which one is 8. Let's see the options again. Option I is 8. So the answer should be I.

The total miles driven is 40, and the number of days is 5. To find the miles driven each day, divide 40 by 5, which equals 8. Therefore, Ms. Perez drove 8 miles each day.
