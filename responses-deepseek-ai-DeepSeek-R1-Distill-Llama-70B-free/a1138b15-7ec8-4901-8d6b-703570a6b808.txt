Okay, so I've got this insurance question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

So, a building was damaged by fire, and the loss is $78,000. There are four insurance companies involved, each with different policy face values. The question is asking how much each company would pay on this loss.

The policies are:
- Company A: $15,000
- Company B: $10,000
- Company C: $12,500
- Company D: $37,500

I remember that in insurance, especially property insurance, when there are multiple policies, they usually share the loss based on their contribution to the total insurance. I think it's called the "pro rata" approach. But wait, maybe that's only when the total insurance is more than the risk. Oh wait, no, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the building's damage is $78,000. So the total insurance coverage is the sum of all policies. Let me calculate that first.

So, adding up all the policies: 15,000 + 10,000 + 12,500 + 37,500.

15k +10k is 25k, plus 12.5k is 37.5k, plus 37.5k is 75k. Oh, wait, the total insurance is $75,000. But the loss is $78,000, which is more than the total insurance. So the insurance can't cover the whole loss; they have to split it proportionally.

Wait, but wait a second. If the total insurance is less than the loss, does each company pay their full policy amount, leaving some loss uninsured? Or do they pay a proportion based on their policy relative to the total?

Hmm. I think in the case of contribution, if the loss is greater than the total insurance, each company pays their proportionate share, and the insured absorbs the remaining loss. Because if the total insurance is 75k and the loss is 78k, the insurance will cover 75k, and the owner pays the remaining 3k.

Wait, but that depends on the type of policies. Are these contributing policies or not? I think the default is that they do contribute, so they'd split the 75k proportionally.

Wait, maybe I should think about it as each company's share of the total insurance. So each company's payment would be (their policy amount / total insurance) multiplied by the loss. But wait, no, because the loss exceeds the total insurance.

Wait, no, let me get this straight. The total insurance is 75k, and the loss is 78k. So the insurance covers up to 75k, and the owner bears the rest (3k). But how is that 75k divided among the insurers?

Each company's share is their policy divided by the total, times the 75k? Wait, no, that would just be their policy. Because if each company's policy is a part of the total, then their share is their policy's proportion of the total insurance. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the loss is 78k, but the total insurance is 75k, so the insurance will only cover up to 75k, and the excess is uninsured.

So the way to calculate each company's payment would be: (policy amount / total insurance) * loss, but since the total insurance is 75k, I think each company's contribution is (policy / total insurance) * 75k. Because the insurance as a whole can't cover the full 78k.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The total insurance is 75k, so the total paid by all companies is 75k. So each company contributes a proportion of the loss based on their policy's share of the total insurance.

So for each company, payment = (policy amount / total insurance) * total loss.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because if the loss is more than the total insurance, the companies would pay more than their policy. Oh no, wait, no. Let's see.

No, wait, the total insurance is 75k, so the total amount they can pay is 75k. So each company's payment is (their policy / 75k) multiplied by the total loss of 78k? Or is it their policy's share of the 75k?

Wait, I think I'm confusing the concepts. Let me try to outline it properly.

In insurance, when multiple policies cover the same risk, each policy contributes pro rata to the loss. But if the total insurance is enough to cover the loss, each company pays their proportionate share up to the loss. If the total insurance is less than the loss, then each company would pay their proportionate share of the loss, but since their total is less, they can only pay up to their policy's share.

Wait, perhaps another approach: If the total insurance is 75k, and the loss is 78k, then the insurance covers 75k. So the insured has a 3k uncovered loss.

Each company's payment would be (their policy / total insurance) * loss, but since the loss is more than the total insurance, perhaps each company's payment is (their policy / total insurance) * total insurance. Which would just be their policy amount. But that can't be right because then the total would be 75k, which is correct, but each company would pay their full policy.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the loss is 78k. So the insurance is 75k, so the total paid would be 75k. So each company's share is (their policy /75k) *75k, which is their policy amount. So each company pays their full policy amount.

Wait, but then the total would be 75k, which matches the total insurance. But the loss is 78k, so the insured would have to cover the remaining 3k. But that can't be, because the insurance is supposed to cover up to their policies. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate that each company's liability is to pay their proportionate share of the loss, but not exceeding their policy limit.

Wait, let me think of it this way: Each company's maximum payment is their policy amount, but they can't pay more than their proportionate share of the loss.

Wait, no, that's not right. In a pro rata arrangement, each company pays a proportion of the loss based on their policy relative to the total insurance. But if the total insurance is less than the loss, each company would pay their share up to their policy limit.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that each company pays their policy amount times (loss / total insurance). But if the loss is more than the total insurance, then this would cause each company to pay more than their policy. Which can't be.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct formula is that each company contributes (policy / total insurance) * loss, but not exceeding their policy amount. But if loss is greater than total insurance, then each company's share is (policy / total insurance) * loss, but that would be more than their policy. So that can't be.

Wait, no, perhaps if the loss is greater than the total insurance, then each company contributes (policy / total insurance) * total insurance, which is just their policy. So each company pays their full policy amount, and the insured absorbs the rest.

But wait, that can't be right because the total insurance is 75k, and the loss is 78k. So the insurance companies together pay 75k, and the insured pays 3k. So each company would pay their full policy amount. Because the sum of policies is 75k.

So in that case, Company A would pay 15k, B 10k, C 12.5k, D 37.5k, totaling 75k.

Looking at the options, option E is exactly that: A pays 15k, B 10k, C 12.5k, D 37.5k.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because I thought the companies would pay a proportionate share based on their policies. But if the total insurance is exactly the sum of all policies, and the loss is higher, then each company would pay up to their policy. Because the sum of policies is 75k, and the loss is 78k, so the insurance covers 75k, each company paying their policy in full.

So the correct answer would be option E.

To determine how much each insurance company would pay on the $78,000 loss, we first calculate the total insurance coverage provided by all policies:

\[
\text{Total Insurance Coverage} = \$15,000 + \$10,000 + \$12,500 + \$37,500 = \$75,000
\]

The loss of $78,000 exceeds the total insurance coverage of $75,000. In such cases, the insurance companies are only required to pay up to their policy limits, as the total insurance coverage is insufficient to cover the full loss. Each company's payment is therefore equal to their policy's face value, and the insured absorbs the remaining $3,000.

Based on this, the payments from each company are as follows:

- **Company A**: $15,000  
- **Company B**: $10,000  
- **Company C**: $12,500  
- **Company D**: $37,500  

This matches the details provided in **Option E**.
