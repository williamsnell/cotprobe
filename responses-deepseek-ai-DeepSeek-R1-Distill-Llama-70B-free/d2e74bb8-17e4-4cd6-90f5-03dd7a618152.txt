Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Laplace transform problem. The question is to evaluate f(t) given the Laplace function F(s). The options are A to D, each with different expressions involving exponential and sinusoidal functions. 

First, I remember that the Laplace transform is used to convert differential equations into algebraic ones, and the inverse Laplace transform does the reverse. So here, I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) to get f(t).

The given F(s) is (3s² +17s +47) divided by (s + 2)(s² +4s +29). I think the first step is to break this down into partial fractions. Partial fraction decomposition is a method where we express a complicated rational function as a sum of simpler fractions. 

So, F(s) = [3s² +17s +47]/[(s+2)(s² +4s +29)]. The denominator factors are already given: a linear term (s+2) and a quadratic term (s² +4s +29). 

The standard approach for partial fractions of such a function would be to express F(s) as A/(s+2) + (Bs + C)/(s² +4s +29). Then, I need to solve for the constants A, B, and C.

Let me set up the equation: 

3s² +17s +47 = A(s² +4s +29) + (Bs + C)(s +2).

Now, I'll expand the right-hand side. 

A(s² +4s +29) = A s² + 4A s + 29A.

(Bs + C)(s +2) = Bs² + 2Bs + Cs + 2C.

Combine like terms:

Right-hand side = (A + B) s² + (4A + 2B + C) s + (29A + 2C).

This must equal the left-hand side: 3s² +17s +47. 

So, setting coefficients equal:

1. Coefficient of s²: A + B = 3. --> Equation 1: A + B = 3.
2. Coefficient of s: 4A + 2B + C =17. --> Equation 2: 4A +2B + C =17.
3. Constant term: 29A + 2C =47. --> Equation 3: 29A + 2C =47.

Now, I need to solve these three equations for A, B, C.

From Equation 1: B = 3 - A.

Substitute B into Equation 2: 4A +2*(3 - A) + C =17.

Simplify that: 4A +6 -2A + C =17 → 2A + C = 11. --> Equation 2a: 2A + C =11.

From Equation 3: 29A +2C =47.

Now, I have two equations (2a and 3) with variables A and C.

Let me express C from Equation 2a: C = 11 - 2A.

Substitute into Equation 3:

29A + 2*(11 - 2A) =47 → 29A +22 -4A =47 → 25A =25 → A=1.

So, A is 1. Then from Equation 1, B=3-1=2.

C=11-2*1=9.

So, the partial fractions are:

F(s) = 1/(s+2) + (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29).

Now, I need to take the inverse Laplace transform of each term.

The inverse Laplace of 1/(s+2) is e^(-2t) u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function.

For the second term, (2s +9)/(s² +4s +29). I think I should complete the square in the denominator to make it easier to apply standard forms.

The denominator s² +4s +29 can be written as (s +2)^2 + (sqrt(29 -4)) )^2. Wait, because (s+2)^2 is s² +4s +4, so 29-4=25. So it's (s+2)^2 +5^2.

So, denominator becomes (s+2)^2 + (5)^2.

So the term is (2s +9) / [ (s+2)^2 +5^2 ].

I can split this into two parts to match the Laplace transforms of exponential multiplied by sine and cosine functions.

Let me write 2s +9 as 2(s + 2) + (9 -4) because 2(s+2) = 2s+4; so 2s+9 = 2(s+2) +5.

So, (2s +9) = 2(s+2) +5.

Therefore, the second term becomes [2(s+2) +5] / [ (s+2)^2 +5^2 ].

This can be split into two fractions: 2(s+2)/[(s+2)^2 +5²] + 5/[(s+2)^2 +5²].

The inverse Laplace of each part:

The first part: 2(s+2)/[(s+2)^2 +5²] → 2 e^(-2t) cos(5t) * 2? Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the Laplace transform pair is: e^{at} cos(ωt) ↔ (s - a)/[(s -a)^2 + ω²]. But here, the denominator is (s+2), so a = -2. So, for the first term, 2(s+2)/(denominator) → 2 * [ (s +2) ] / [ (s+2)^2 +5² ].

The inverse Laplace of (s + a)/[(s+a)^2 + ω²] is e^{-at} cos(ωt). But wait, actually, the standard form is (s + a) → e^{-at} cos(ωt). But in our case, the numerator is (s +2), so a=2, and ω=5.

So, 2 * [ (s+2)/((s+2)^2 +5^2) ] → 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t).

The second part is 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ), which is 5/(5) * 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ). Wait, the Laplace transform of e^{-at} sin(ωt) is ω / [ (s+a)^2 + ω^2 ].

So, 5/(denominator) → (5/5) * 5/(denominator) = 1 * [5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The standard is:

L{ e^{-at} sin(ωt) } = ω / [ (s +a)^2 + ω² ].

So, in this case, 5 / [ (s+2)^2 +5² ] → (5) / [ (s+2)^2 +5^2 ] → that's 5 times [1/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) ].

So the inverse Laplace would be 5 * e^{-2t} sin(5t) * (1/5)? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, L{ e^{-at} sin(ωt) } = ω / [ (s+a)^2 + ω² ].

So the inverse would be: [ω] / [ (s+a)^2 + ω² ] → e^{-at} sin(ωt).

So, if the numerator is ω, then the inverse is sin(ωt) e^{-at}.

In our case, the numerator is 5, which is the same as ω (since ω=5). So 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) → e^{-2t} sin(5t).

Wait, but wait another moment. Let's see:

Wait, the denominator is (s+2)^2 +5^2. So a=2, ω=5.

So, 5/(denominator) → 5 * [1/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) ] → which corresponds to (5) * [ (1/5) * 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) ) ].

No, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of:

The expression is 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) = (5/5) * 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) → Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me approach it differently.

The term is 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ). Let me factor out the 5^2 denominator.

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that 5/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) = (5) / [ (s+2)^2 +5^2 ].

Which is the same as 5 * [1/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) ].

The inverse Laplace of 1/( (s+a)^2 + ω^2 ) is (1/ω) e^{-at} sin(ωt).

So, here, a=2, ω=5. So 1/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) → (1/5)e^{-2t} sin(5t).

Therefore, 5 * [1/( (s+2)^2 +5^2 ) ] → 5 * (1/5) e^{-2t} sin(5t) → e^{-2t} sin(5t).

So putting it all together, the second term in F(s) is:

2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) + e^{-2t} sin(5t).

Wait, no. Wait, the second term in the partial fractions is (2s+9)/(denominator) which we split into 2(s+2)/(denominator) +5/(denominator). 

The inverse of 2(s+2)/(denominator) is 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t), and the inverse of 5/(denominator) is e^{-2t} sin(5t). So the entire second term becomes 2 e^{-2t} cos(5t) + e^{-2t} sin(5t).

So combining both terms from F(s): the first term is e^{-2t}, and the second is [2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)] multiplied by e^{-2t}.

So f(t) = e^{-2t} + e^{-2t} [2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)].

I can factor out e^{-2t}:

f(t) = e^{-2t} [1 + 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)].

Hmm, but looking at the answer options, they have terms like 2.24 e^{-2t} cos(...) etc. So maybe I need to combine the sine and cosine terms into a single sinusoidal function with phase shift.

Let me think about that. The expression 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t) can be written in the form R cos(5t - θ), where R is the amplitude and θ is the phase shift.

To find R and θ:

R = sqrt( (2)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(4+1) = sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, which is about 2.24 as in the options.

θ is given by tan θ = (amplitude of sine term) / (amplitude of cosine term) = 1/2. So θ = arctan(1/2).

Calculating θ: arctan(1/2) is approximately 26.565 degrees, which is about 26.6 degrees as in the options.

So, 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t) = R cos(5t - θ) = 2.24 cos(5t - 26.6°).

So putting it all together, f(t) is:

e^{-2t} [1 + 2.24 cos(5t -26.6°)].

Wait, let me check: The 1 comes from the first term, which is e^{-2t}, and the second part is [2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)] e^{-2t}.

So, f(t) = e^{-2t} + e^{-2t} [2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)] = e^{-2t} [1 + 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)].

Wait, no. Because the first term from the partial fraction was 1/(s+2) giving e^{-2t}, and the second partial fraction term's inverse is [2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)] e^{-2t}.

So when I combine, f(t) = e^{-2t} + e^{-2t} [2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)].

Wait, that's e^{-2t} multiplied by (1 + 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t)), right? But when I combined 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t) into 2.24 cos(5t -26.6°), that's just the second part. So the entire f(t) would be:

e^{-2t} [1 + 2.24 cos(5t -26.6°) ].

Looking at the options:

Option B: e^-2t + 2.24 e^-2t cos(5t -26.6°)
Option A: e^-2t + 2.24 e^-2t sin(...)
Option C: e^-2t - 2.24 e^-2t cos(...)
Option D: e^-2t + 2.24 e^-2t cos(5t +26.6°)

Wait, but in my expression, I have 1 + 2.24 cos(...). So f(t) = e^{-2t} [1 + 2.24 cos(5t -26.6°)].

Which can be written as e^{-2t} + 2.24 e^{-2t} cos(5t -26.6°). 

Looking at the options, that's exactly option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the phase angle θ. Since the expression is 2 cos(5t) + sin(5t), which can be written as R cos(5t - θ), where θ is the phase shift.

The identity is: A cos x + B sin x = R cos(x - θ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and θ = arctan(B/A).

In this case, A=2, B=1. So θ = arctan(1/2) ≈ 26.56 degrees. So when you write it as R cos(5t - θ), that's correct.

So the function is e^{-2t} [1 + 2.24 cos(5t -26.6°)]. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B: e^-2t + 2.24 e^-2t cos(5t -26.6°) u(t).

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the answer is B.

To evaluate \( f(t) \) given \( F(s) = \frac{3s^2 + 17s + 47}{(s + 2)(s^2 + 4s + 29)} \), we perform partial fraction decomposition. The denominator factors are \( (s + 2) \) and \( (s^2 + 4s + 29) \). We express \( F(s) \) as:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s + 2} + \frac{Bs + C}{s^2 + 4s + 29}.
\]

Expanding and equating coefficients, we solve for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). The solution is:

\[
A = 1, \quad B = 2, \quad C = 9.
\]

Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is:

\[
F(s) = \frac{1}{s + 2} + \frac{2s + 9}{s^2 + 4s + 29}.
\]

Next, we take the inverse Laplace transform of each term. For \( \frac{1}{s + 2} \), the inverse Laplace transform is \( e^{-2t} u(t) \). For \( \frac{2s + 9}{s^2 + 4s + 29} \), we complete the square in the denominator:

\[
s^2 + 4s + 29 = (s + 2)^2 + 5^2.
\]

We rewrite \( \frac{2s + 9}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2} \) as:

\[
\frac{2(s + 2) + 5}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2}.
\]

This splits into two terms:

\[
\frac{2(s + 2)}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2} + \frac{5}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2}.
\]

The inverse Laplace transforms are:

1. \( \frac{2(s + 2)}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2} \to 2e^{-2t}\cos(5t) \),
2. \( \frac{5}{(s + 2)^2 + 5^2} \to e^{-2t}\sin(5t) \).

Combining these, the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{2s + 9}{s^2 + 4s + 29} \) is:

\[
2e^{-2t}\cos(5t) + e^{-2t}\sin(5t).
\]

Adding the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s + 2} \), the overall \( f(t) \) is:

\[
f(t) = e^{-2t} + 2e^{-2t}\cos(5t) + e^{-2t}\sin(5t).
\]

Factoring out \( e^{-2t} \), we get:

\[
f(t) = e^{-2t} \left[ 1 + 2\cos(5t) + \sin(5t) \right].
\]
