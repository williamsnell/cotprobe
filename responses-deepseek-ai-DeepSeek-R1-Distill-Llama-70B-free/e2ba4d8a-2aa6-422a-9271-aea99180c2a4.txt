Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating a Riemann Sum for a double integral. Hmm, I remember that Riemann Sums are used to approximate integrals by dividing the area into smaller rectangles and sampling points within them. Let me think through this step by step.

The region R is given as [1, 2.5] × [1, 2]. So in x-direction, it's from 1 to 2.5, and y from 1 to 2. The integral is ∫∫_R xy dA, which means we're integrating the function f(x,y) = xy over this rectangle.

The question asks for S_{3,2}, which I believe refers to a Riemann Sum with m=3 subdivisions in the x-direction and n=2 in the y-direction. Or wait, sometimes it's the other way around. Oh right, usually S_{m,n} would mean m in x and n in y. So m=3 and n=2.

Wait, the problem says to use the lower-left vertex of each rectangle as the sample point. That's important because the choice of sample point affects the sum. Lower-left means we're taking the minimum x and y in each subrectangle.

First, I need to figure out the width and height of each subrectangle. The x-interval is from 1 to 2.5, which is a length of 1.5. Dividing this into 3 equal parts gives each subrectangle a width of Δx = 1.5 / 3 = 0.5. Similarly, the y-interval is from 1 to 2, so length is 1. Dividing into 2 parts gives Δy = 1 / 2 = 0.5.

So each subrectangle is 0.5 by 0.5.

Now, I'll need to create a grid of 3×2 rectangles. The x-values for the subrectangles will start at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The x starts at 1, each segment is 0.5. So the x points are 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5. Wait, for m=3, the divisions would be at x=1, 1.5, 2, 2.5. So the first subrectangle is [1,1.5] in x, the second [1.5,2], third [2,2.5]. Similarly for y: divisions at 1, 1.5, 2. So subrectangles in y are [1,1.5] and [1.5, 2].

Each subrectangle's lower-left corner would be the points (x_i, y_j), where x_i is 1, 1.5, 2 for the first three in x, and y_j is 1, 1.5 for the two in y.

So the sample points are all combinations of x_i and y_j where i=1 to 3 and j=1 to 2. So sample points are (1,1), (1,1.5), (1.5,1), (1.5,1.5), (2,1), (2,1.5).

Wait, no, wait. For m=3 and n=2, the number of subrectangles is 3×2=6. Each will have a lower-left point at (x_i, y_j), where x_i is 1, 1.5, 2, and y_j is 1, 1.5.

So the six points are:

(1,1), (1,1.5) — no, wait, no. Wait, for each x_i, we pair with each y_j. So for x_i=1, y_j=1 and 1.5 → two points.

Same for x=1.5, pair with y=1 and 1.5 → two more points.

Same for x=2, pair with y=1 and 1.5 → two points.

Wait, but m=3 and n=2, so 3×2=6 subrectangles. Each subrectangle's lower-left corner is (x_i, y_j), where x_i is the left end of the x-subinterval, and y_j is the lower end of the y-subinterval.

So the function f(x,y)=xy will be evaluated at each of these six points.

Then, each term in the Riemann sum is f(x_i, y_j) * Δx * Δy.

Wait, no, the double Riemann sum formula is sum_{i,j} f(x_i^*, y_j^*) Δx Δy, where (x_i^*, y_j^*) is the sample point in the subrectangle.

So for each subrectangle, compute f at the sample point, multiply by the area of the subrectangle (Δx*Δy), and sum all.

So let's compute each of the six terms.

First, compute Δx and Δy. As before, Δx=0.5, Δy=0.5. So each term is f(x_i, y_j) * 0.5 * 0.5 = f(x_i, y_j) * 0.25.

Now, let's list all six (x_i, y_j) points and compute f:

1. (1, 1): f=1*1=1 → term = 1 * 0.25 = 0.25
2. (1, 1.5): f=1 * 1.5 = 1.5 → term = 1.5 * 0.25 = 0.375
3. (1.5, 1): f=1.5*1 =1.5 → term= 1.5 *0.25=0.375
4. (1.5, 1.5): f=1.5*1.5=2.25 → term=2.25 *0.25=0.5625
5. (2, 1): f=2*1=2 → term=2 *0.25=0.5
6. (2, 1.5): f=2*1.5=3 → term=3 *0.25=0.75

Now sum all these terms:

0.25 + 0.375 = 0.625
+ 0.375 → 1.0
+ 0.5625 → 1.5625
+ 0.5 → 2.0625
+ 0.75 → 2.8125

Wait, that sums up to 2.8125. Let me check the addition again step by step.

Term 1: 0.25 → total 0.25

Term 2: +0.375 → 0.625

Term 3: +0.375 → 1.0

Term4: +0.5625 → 1.5625

Term5: +0.5 → 2.0625

Term6: +0.75 → 2.8125.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the options given are: A is 4, which is higher. B is 3.75, C is 2.567, D:3.124, E:3.456, F:2.812, G:3.225, H:2.975, I:2.65, J:3.333.

So 2.8125 is option F, which is 2.812.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I compute all terms correctly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of subrectangles or in the points. Let me make a table.

List of sample points and their f(x,y):

For x: 1, 1.5, 2.

For y:1, 1.5.

So the six points:

(1,1): f=1 → term 0.25

(1,1.5): 1.5 → 0.375

(1.5,1):1.5 →0.375

(1.5,1.5):2.25 →0.5625

(2,1):2 →0.5

(2,1.5):3 →0.75

Adding all terms:

Let me add them in order: 0.25 + 0.375 = 0.625.

Next, +0.375 → 1.0.

Next, +0.5625 →1.5625.

Next, +0.5 →2.0625.

Next, +0.75 →2.8125.

Yes, so the sum is 2.8125, which matches option F:2.812.

Wait, but wait, the question says S_{3,2}. Does that mean 3 subdivisions in x and 2 in y, which is what I did. So yes, the calculation is correct.

To calculate the Riemann Sum \( S_{3,2} \) for the double integral \(\int\int_R xy \, dA\) over the rectangle \( R = [1, 2.5] \times [1, 2] \), we divide \( R \) into \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) subrectangles. Each subrectangle has dimensions \( \Delta x = 0.5 \) and \( \Delta y = 0.5 \), where \( \Delta x = \frac{2.5 - 1}{3} \) and \( \Delta y = \frac{2 - 1}{2} \). The sample points are the lower-left vertices of the subrectangles.

The function \( f(x, y) = xy \) is evaluated at the sample points, and each term in the Riemann Sum is \( f(x_i, y_j) \cdot \Delta x \cdot \Delta y \). The six sample points and their corresponding terms are:

1. \( (1, 1): f = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \), term = \( 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.25 \)
2. \( (1, 1.5): f = 1 \cdot 1.5 = 1.5 \), term = \( 1.5 \cdot 0.25 = 0.375 \)
3. \( (1.5, 1): f = 1.5 \cdot 1 = 1.5 \), term = \( 1.5 \cdot 0.25 = 0.375 \)
4. \( (1.5, 1.5): f = 1.5 \cdot 1.5 = 2.25 \), term = \( 2.25 \cdot 0.25 = 0.5625 \)
5. \( (2, 1): f = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \), term = \( 2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.5 \)
6. \( (2, 1.5): f = 2 \cdot 1.5 = 3 \), term = \( 3 \cdot 0.25 = 0.75 \)

Summing these terms:

\[
0.25 + 0.375 + 0.375 + 0.5625 + 0.5 + 0.75 = 2.8125
\]

Thus, the Riemann Sum \( S_{3,2} \) is approximately \( 2.812 \). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**F: 2.812**
