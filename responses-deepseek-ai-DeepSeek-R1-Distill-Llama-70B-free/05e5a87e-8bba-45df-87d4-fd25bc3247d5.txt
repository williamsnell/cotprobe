Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"But you, my dear Pangloss," said Candide, "how can it be that I behold you again?"
"It is true," said Pangloss, "that you saw me hanged&….A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me. He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&…[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&….
One day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&….She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&….We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us."
"Well, my dear Pangloss," said Candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"
"I am still of my first opinion," answered Pangloss, "for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Voltaire's Candide and the philosophers whose critiques are similar to those Voltaire is making. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that Candide is a satire that criticizes the optimism of philosophers, particularly the idea that "all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds." That line is actually from Leibniz, right? Voltaire is poking fun at Leibniz's optimism, which Pangloss represents in the story. So the question is asking which other philosopher shares these critiques.

Looking at the options, I see names like David Hume, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, and others. I need to figure out who among these was critical of the kind of optimism that Voltaire is attacking.

I think Voltaire's critique is against the idea that the world is inherently good and that everything happens for a reason, which is a form of philosophical optimism. So, who else criticized this kind of optimism?

I remember that David Hume was a skeptic. He questioned the notion of a perfectly ordered universe and the idea of natural religion. Hume's empiricism and skepticism might align with Voltaire's critique of overly optimistic views.

Then there's Rousseau, who had his own ideas about society and nature. I think he believed that humans are inherently good but are corrupted by society. But I'm not sure if he directly criticized Leibniz's optimism in the same way Voltaire did.

Kant, on the other hand, came after Voltaire and was more into moral philosophy and critical philosophy. His ideas about the categorical imperative don't seem directly related to this critique of optimism.

What about Nietzsche? He was much later and criticized traditional morality and Christianity, but I'm not sure if that's directly related here.

Wait, I think the key is that Voltaire is attacking the idea that everything is for the best, which is linked to the philosophy of optimism. So who else was critical of that? I remember that the Enlightenment had various thinkers, some more optimistic than others.

Another thought: the critique of optimism in Candide is also a critique of the idea that the world is perfect as it is, which can be seen as a criticism of certain religious or philosophical views. David Hume was critical of religion and the argument from design, which is the idea that the world's order implies a designer. So Hume's skepticism about the benevolence of the universe might align with Voltaire's position.

Alternatively, I'm trying to remember if there's another philosopher who was specifically against Leibniz's optimism. Wait, wasn't there a response from another philosopher to Leibniz's Theodicy? I think it was Bayle who wrote about the problem of evil, but Bayle isn't one of the options here.

So, looking back at the options, the closest would be David Hume. He was a contemporary of Voltaire's, I think, and both were part of the Enlightenment, though Hume was Scottish. Hume's skepticism about metaphysical claims and his empiricism would align with Voltaire's satire against overly optimistic philosophical views.

Wait, another angle: the other options like Rousseau and Kant. Rousseau was more about social contract and human nature, not directly about optimism. Kant was more about ethics and reason. So I think Hume is the best fit here.

The question asks which philosopher's critiques are most closely aligned with Voltaire's critiques in *Candide*. Voltaire's satire targets philosophical optimism, particularly the idea that "all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds," which is associated with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The character of Pangloss embodies this optimism, and Voltaire critiques it through Pangloss's relentless adherence to it despite suffering and injustice.

Among the options, David Hume stands out as the philosopher whose critiques align most closely with Voltaire's. Hume was a skeptic who questioned the idea of a perfectly ordered universe and the optimism underlying it. He criticized the argument from design, which posits that the world's order implies a benevolent creator, and his empiricism and skepticism about metaphysical claims resonate with Voltaire's satire of overly optimistic philosophical views.

Other philosophers, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, focused more on human nature and society, while Immanuel Kant's work centered on moral philosophy and reason. Friedrich Nietzsche, though critical of traditional morality, emerged much later and is less directly relevant to Voltaire's specific critique of optimism. Therefore, David Hume's skepticism and critique of optimism make him the best match.
