Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option is a long-run adjustment for the owners of a small café. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about short-run and long-run adjustments in economics.

From what I remember, short-run adjustments are decisions or actions that businesses can make quickly, usually within a short period of time, like a few days or weeks. These often involve things like changing prices, increasing hours, or hiring temporary workers. On the other hand, long-run adjustments take more time, often months or years, and involve more significant changes, like expanding the business, investing in new equipment, or entering new markets.

So the question is asking for a long-run adjustment. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: Outsourcing bread delivery. That seems like a decision that can be made relatively quickly. You find a supplier, maybe negotiate a contract, and switch. So that's probably a short-run adjustment.

Option B: Hiring part-time workers. That's something that can happen pretty fast too. You put up ads, interview, hire—this is definitely short-term.

Option C: Switching bread types. Changing suppliers or menu items is something that can be done in a short time frame, so short-run again.

Option D: Introducing a new daily special. That's a quick change to the menu, so again, short-run.

Option E: Working overtime on a busy weekend. That's a very immediate response, so definitely short-run.

Option F: Expanding to include catering. Catering is a new service, which might require some setup—like new staff, maybe new equipment, or a marketing push. That sounds like a longer-term commitment.

Option G: Buying the next-door office to double seating. That's a significant investment. Buying property and renovating takes time, so that's a long-run decision.

Option H: Negotiating a new contract with a supplier. Contracts can take some time, but they can be done in the short to medium term. Maybe this is more short-run, unless it's a major overhaul of their supply chain.

Option I: Closing early on a slow day. That's a quick decision, so short-run.

Option J: Investing in a franchise and opening a second location. That's a big move. It involves a lot of planning, financing, finding a location, hiring new staff, etc. Definitely a long-term adjustment.

Now, the question is which of these is an example of a long-run adjustment. So looking at the options, F, G, and J all seem like long-run.

But the question is multiple choice, so only one correct answer. The options are from A to J, so I need to pick which one is correct.

Looking back at the options, the question is about a small café's adjustment. Let's think about each.

Option F: Adding catering. That could be a medium-term change. It requires some planning, maybe hiring more staff, creating a new menu, marketing. So it's longer than a week or two, but maybe a few months.

Option G: Expanding by buying the next-door office. That's a significant investment in fixed assets. It would take time to purchase the property and possibly renovate it. That's a long-term decision.

Option J: Opening a second location via franchise. That's a major expansion, probably the longest-term of all options. It's a big investment and takes a lot of time.

So the question is which one is a long-run adjustment. All of F, G, J are long-run, but the question is asking for an example, so any of them could be correct, but the options are given as unique.

Wait, the options are multiple choice, so only one is correct. So perhaps I need to determine which is the best fit.

The question is about the café making a long-run adjustment. So perhaps the best example is expanding the business, which options G and J are about.

Wait, but G is about expanding the seating area, which is a capacity expansion. J is about opening a second location, which is a bigger expansion.

In economics, the long run is when all inputs can be adjusted, including capital. So both G and J involve capital investments. So both are long-run.

But looking back, sometimes in microeconomics, the distinction is that the short run is where some inputs are fixed (like capital), and the long run is where all are variable. So decisions about capital investments are long-run.

So both G and J would be long-run. But the options are separate, so the question expects one correct answer.

Looking at the options given, perhaps the best example is J: investing in a franchise and opening a second location. That's a significant long-term commitment.

Alternatively, option G is also a long-term decision because it involves purchasing property and expanding the current location.

Wait, the question is about the café's adjustment. So perhaps expanding the seating is a long-run decision, as it's a capital investment. Similarly, opening a second location is a long-run decision.

But I'm a bit confused because in the options, only one can be correct. How do I choose between G and J?

Let me think about what each option entails. Option G is about expanding the current café's seating, which would increase capacity. So that's a long-term investment because it's a fixed cost. J is about opening a second location, which is even more long-term as it's a separate business unit.

So perhaps both are correct, but in the options, only one can be the answer.

Wait, looking back at the question, it's a multiple-choice question with options A-J, and we have to pick one. So perhaps the intended correct answer is G or J.

But wait, let me think again. In economics, the long-run involves all inputs being variable. So any decision that changes the firm's fixed inputs is a long-run decision.

So purchasing a building next door (G) is definitely a fixed input. So that's a long-run decision.

Similarly, opening a second location (J) is also a long-run decision.

But the question is which option is an example of a long-run adjustment. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but in the options, only one is to be chosen.

Wait, looking at the options, I need to see which one is more clearly a long-run adjustment.

Option F: Expanding operations to include catering. That's a product line expansion. It may not involve as much fixed capital as buying a building or opening a new location. So perhaps F is more of a medium-term decision.

So between G and J, which is more clearly long-run.

I think both are, but in the context of a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is J because opening a second location is a significant expansion beyond the current premises.

Alternatively, the expansion of the current premises (G) is also a long-run decision.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most obvious long-run example. Usually, adding a new location is a bigger deal than expanding seating, so J might be the intended answer.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the options again.

The question is, which is an example of a long-run adjustment. So any of G, F, or J could be, but perhaps the best fit is J because it's about expanding beyond the current business into a new location, which is a clear long-term strategic decision.

Alternatively, option F is about adding a new service, which might require some investment but perhaps not as much as a new location.

So considering that, I think the correct answer is J: The owners invest in a franchise opportunity and open a second location.

To determine which option represents a long-run adjustment for the owners of a small café, it is important to distinguish between short-run and long-run decisions. Short-run decisions are made quickly (e.g., within days or weeks) and involve minor adjustments, such as hiring temporary workers or changing menu items. Long-run decisions, on the other hand, take months or years to implement and involve significant investments, such as expanding capacity or entering new markets.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, H, I**: These involve quick changes or short-term adjustments, such as outsourcing, hiring part-time workers, switching suppliers, or working overtime. These are all short-run decisions.
- **F**: Expanding operations to include catering may require some planning and investment, but it is less capital-intensive compared to other options like buying property or opening a new location. This could be considered a medium-term decision.
- **G**: Buying the office next door to double seating capacity is a significant investment in fixed assets, requiring time to purchase and renovate the property. This is a clear long-run decision.
- **J**: Investing in a franchise and opening a second location is an even more significant long-term commitment, involving extensive planning, financing, and hiring. This is also a long-run decision.

While both **G** and **J** are long-run adjustments, opening a second location (**J**) represents a more substantial and strategic expansion, making it the most clear-cut example of a long-run adjustment.
