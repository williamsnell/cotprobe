Okay, so I have this question about regression analysis and hypothesis testing. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that a regression is estimated using 27 quarterly observations. The model is y_t = β₁ + β₂x₂ + β₃x_{3t} + u_t. We need to find the appropriate critical value for a two-sided 5% test of the null hypothesis H₀: β₃ = 1.

Hmm, I remember that in hypothesis testing for regression coefficients, we often use t-tests. The critical value depends on the significance level and the degrees of freedom.

First, I should figure out the degrees of freedom. The model has three parameters: β₁, β₂, and β₃. So the number of parameters estimated is 3. The sample size is 27 observations. 

I think the formula for degrees of freedom (df) in this case is n - k, where n is the sample size and k is the number of parameters. So 27 - 3 = 24 degrees of freedom.

Wait, no, wait. Because in regression, the degrees of freedom for the t-test of a coefficient is typically n - k - 1, but I think that's for the standard error estimation. Or maybe the degrees of freedom is based on the residuals, which would be n - k. So here, 27 - 3 = 24 df.

So the test is two-tailed and at a 5% significance level. That means the alpha is 0.05, split into two tails, each with alpha/2 = 0.025.

I need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test with 24 degrees of freedom. The critical value would be the t-value where the probability of being more extreme is 2.5% on each side.

Looking at the options provided, I think I need to recall the t-table values. I remember that for around 20-30 degrees of freedom, the critical values are a bit lower than 2. Let me try to remember the exact numbers.

At 24 degrees of freedom, a two-tailed 5% test would have a critical t-value of approximately 2.06 or 2.07. Wait, I think the exact value might be 2.06. Let me see, the t-table for 24 df and 0.025 in each tail.

Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another value. Let's think: for 20 df, the 0.025 two-tail is about 2.09, and for 30 df it's about 2.04. So 24 is between 20 and 30, so the value should be around 2.06 or so.

Looking at the options, option E is 2.06. So that would be the correct critical value.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, in software like Excel or statistical packages, the t-critical function might give the exact value based on df. So for df=24, the exact critical value for a two-tailed 5% test is approximately 2.0639, which would round to 2.06. So yes, option E is 2.06.

I should make sure that I'm not confusing this with the z-test, which uses 1.96 for a 5% two-tailed test. But since the question is about a t-test, we use the t-distribution with 24 df, so 2.06 is correct.
</think>

To determine the appropriate critical value for a two-sided 5% test of \( H_0: \beta_3 = 1 \), we use a t-test. The regression model has 3 parameters (\( \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3 \)), and the sample size is 27 quarterly observations. The degrees of freedom for the t-test are calculated as:

\[
\text{Degrees of Freedom (df)} = n - k = 27 - 3 = 24
\]

For a two-sided test at a 5% significance level, the critical t-value corresponds to the value where the probability in each tail is \( \alpha/2 = 0.025 \). Using the t-table or a statistical calculator, the critical t-value for 24 degrees of freedom and a two-tailed 5% test is approximately **2.06**. This matches option E.

It is important to note that the t-test is used here because the regression involves a small sample size, and the t-distribution is appropriate for hypothesis testing in such cases. If this were a large sample, the critical value would approach the z-test value of 1.96, but for 24 degrees of freedom, the t-test critical value is 2.06.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: 2.06
