Question:

Can a stream cipher have perfect secrecy?

Options:

A: Yes, if the PRG is really “secure”
B: No, because perfect secrecy is not possible in any cipher
C: Yes, if the stream cipher is implemented correctly
D: No, since the key is shorter than the message
E: Yes, every cipher has perfect secrecy
F: Yes, if the key is longer than the message
G: No, only block ciphers can have perfect secrecy
H: Yes, if the key is used only once
I: No, since the key is reused for the stream cipher
J: No, there are no ciphers with perfect secrecy

Okay, so I have this question about stream ciphers and perfect secrecy. Hmm, I remember that perfect secrecy is a really strong security notion. It means that the ciphertext gives no information about the plaintext, right? I think Claude Shannon was involved with that concept.

Wait, the question is whether a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy. From what I recall, the one-time pad is a stream cipher that's known for having perfect secrecy. But wait, isn't the one-time pad a specific case where the key is as long as the message and never reused? So maybe that's the key here.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says yes if the PRG is secure. PRG is a pseudo-random generator. Wait, but if it's pseudo-random, does that mean it's not truly random? I think perfect secrecy requires the key to be truly random and used only once. So maybe A isn't correct because a PRG might not be enough unless it's perfectly random, which they usually aren't.

Option B says no, because perfect secrecy isn't possible. But I know the one-time pad does have perfect secrecy, so B is wrong.

Option C: Yes, if implemented correctly. Well, correct implementation would probably mean using a one-time pad, which is a stream cipher. So maybe C is correct, but I'm not sure if all correct stream ciphers have it or just specific ones like the one-time pad.

Option D: No, key is shorter than message. Wait, the one-time pad has the key the same length as the message, so if a cipher uses a shorter key, maybe it can't have perfect secrecy. But the option says "no, because...", so if the key is shorter, then it's not possible. But wait, the question is whether a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy, not all stream ciphers. So if any stream cipher can, like the one-time pad, then the answer would be yes. So D's reasoning might not apply.

Option E: Every cipher has perfect secrecy. No, that's definitely not true. Most ciphers don't.

Option F: Yes, if key is longer than message. Well, the one-time pad's key is same length as the message. So F's condition is not necessary; same length suffices.

Option G: No, only block ciphers can have it. That's incorrect because one-time pad is a stream cipher.

Option H: Yes, if the key is used only once. Oh, that sounds familiar. One-time pad requires the key to be used once and be as long as the message. So H seems correct.

Option I: No, since key is reused. Well, if the key is reused, then it's not perfectly secure, but the question is about whether a stream cipher can have it. So if the key isn't reused, like in one-time pad, then it's possible. So I is incorrect as a general statement.

Option J: No ciphers have it. Incorrect because one-time pad does.

So, putting it together, the correct answer would be either C or H. The question is whether a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy. The one-time pad is a stream cipher and does have perfect secrecy. So the answer should be yes, provided certain conditions, like using the key only once and being as long as the message.

Wait, looking at the options, H says "if the key is used only once." That aligns with the one-time pad's requirement. So H is correct. Alternatively, C says "implemented correctly," which is vague. So which is the right option?

The one-time pad is a stream cipher, so the answer would be yes. So the correct options are either H or C. Let me think: the question is about possibility, so the correct answer is yes, provided certain conditions. So option H is correct because it states that if the key is used once, it's possible. Option C says if implemented correctly, which is a bit vague. But in cryptography, the one-time pad is the example of a stream cipher with perfect secrecy when the key is used once and is as long as the message.

So looking back, the question is whether a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy. The answer is yes, provided the key is used only once (and other conditions like key length). So the correct answer is H.

To determine whether a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy, it is important to recall that perfect secrecy requires the ciphertext to provide no information about the plaintext. The one-time pad, a specific type of stream cipher, is known to achieve perfect secrecy under certain conditions: the key must be truly random, as long as the message, and used only once.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. A pseudo-random generator (PRG) is not sufficient for perfect secrecy unless it produces truly random output, which PRGs typically do not.
- **B**: Incorrect. Perfect secrecy is possible, as demonstrated by the one-time pad.
- **C**: Vague but potentially correct. A stream cipher like the one-time pad has perfect secrecy when implemented correctly, but this option lacks specificity.
- **D**: Incorrect. The one-time pad, a stream cipher, uses a key the same length as the message, so this reasoning does not apply.
- **E**: Incorrect. Not all ciphers have perfect secrecy.
- **F**: Incorrect. The key does not need to be longer than the message; it just needs to be as long and used once.
- **G**: Incorrect. The one-time pad, a stream cipher, achieves perfect secrecy, so block ciphers are not the only ones capable of it.
- **H**: Correct. Perfect secrecy is possible for a stream cipher if the key is used only once, as in the one-time pad.
- **I**: Incorrect. The statement is too general; the key reuse is a problem, but the question asks about the possibility of perfect secrecy, which exists when the key is not reused.
- **J**: Incorrect. The one-time pad is an example of a cipher with perfect secrecy.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately reflects the condition under which a stream cipher can achieve perfect secrecy.
