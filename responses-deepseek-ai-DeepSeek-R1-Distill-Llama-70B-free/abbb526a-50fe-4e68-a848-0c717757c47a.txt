Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and logistic regression. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on SVMs, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two statements. Let me look at them one by one.

Statement 1 says that SVMs, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example. Wait, I remember that logistic regression does give probabilities because it outputs a probability between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as the probability that the instance belongs to the positive class. But what about SVMs? I think traditional SVMs don't output probabilities directly. They give a decision boundary, right? But wait, I think there's something called Platt scaling which can be used to get probabilities from SVMs. So by default, do SVMs provide a probability distribution? I'm not sure. I think without Platt scaling, they just give the class label based on whether the decision function is positive or negative. So maybe Statement 1 is false because SVMs don't inherently give probabilities like logistic regression does.

Moving on to Statement 2: We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels. Hmm, the kernel determines how the data is transformed into a higher-dimensional space. A linear kernel is the simplest, just the dot product. Polynomial kernels add more complexity. When you change the kernel, the data's representation changes. Support vectors are the points that lie closest to the decision boundary. So if the decision boundary changes because the kernel changes, the support vectors would likely change too. For example, a higher-order polynomial kernel might find more complex boundaries, so different points become support vectors. So Statement 2 is probably false because the support vectors would change when switching kernels.

Wait, but what if the data is already linearly separable? Then a higher-order kernel might not change the support vectors because the decision boundary remains the same. But the statement says "in general," which implies most cases. So in most cases, changing the kernel from linear to a higher polynomial would change the support vectors. So Statement 2 is false.

So now, evaluating the statements: Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false. So looking at the options, which option has both statements as false?

Looking at the options, option D is False, False. Option F is False, True, which doesn't fit. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, let me double-check. I should make sure about Statement 1. Do SVMs give a probability distribution? Oh right, by default, SVM outputs are based on the decision function's margin. But if you use methods like Platt scaling, you can get probabilities. However, the question doesn't specify that. So the statement is saying SVMs, like logistic regression, give probabilities. Since logistic regression inherently gives probabilities and SVMs don't unless modified, the statement is false. So Statement 1 is false.

So yes, both statements are false, so the answer is D.

The question evaluates two statements about Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and logistic regression. 

- **Statement 1**: SVMs, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels. Logistic regression inherently provides probabilities, but traditional SVMs do not; they focus on the decision boundary. Probabilities can be obtained from SVMs using methods like Platt scaling, but this is not their default behavior. Thus, Statement 1 is **False**.

- **Statement 2**: Support vectors remain the same when moving from a linear kernel to a higher-order polynomial kernel. The kernel transforms the data into higher dimensions, altering the decision boundary. This change typically results in different support vectors. While exceptions exist (e.g., linearly separable data), the statement is false "in general." Thus, Statement 2 is **False**.

Both statements are false, so the correct answer is:

D: False, False

Answer: D
