Okay, so I need to figure out whether Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true or false. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with Statement 1: "The F1 score can be especially useful for datasets with class high imbalance." Hmm, I remember that F1 score is a measure that combines precision and recall. It's the harmonic mean of the two. I think in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, like when one class has a lot more instances than the other, accuracy isn't a good metric because the model might just predict the majority class and still have high accuracy. So in such cases, F1 is better because it considers both precision and recall. Wait, but wait, isn't F1 calculated for each class? Oh right, so if the classes are imbalanced, the F1 score gives a better sense of the model's performance because it's not as affected by the imbalance as accuracy is. So Statement 1 sounds true.

Now, Statement 2: "The area under the ROC curve is one of the main metrics used to assess anomaly detectors." I know that ROC-AUC is a popular metric for classification models, especially binary classification. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at different thresholds. For anomaly detection, which is often a case of imbalanced classes (since anomalies are rare), using ROC-AUC makes sense because it evaluates how well the model distinguishes between the two classes. I've heard that AUC-ROC is commonly used in such scenarios, so Statement 2 should be true as well.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Are there other metrics for anomaly detection? Like precision-recall curves? Oh right, sometimes when dealing with high class imbalance, the ROC-AUC might not be the best because it can be misleading. But it's still widely used. So I think Statement 2 is correct.

So both statements are true. Looking at the options, option G says both are true. So the answer should be G.

The F1 score is indeed useful for imbalanced datasets as it combines precision and recall, providing a more accurate measure than accuracy alone in such scenarios. The area under the ROC curve is a key metric for assessing anomaly detectors, especially in imbalanced cases, making both statements true.

G: True, True

Answer: G
