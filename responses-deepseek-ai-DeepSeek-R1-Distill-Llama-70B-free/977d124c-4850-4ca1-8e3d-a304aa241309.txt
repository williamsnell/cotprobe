Question:

Mr. Patrick is preparing a five-question true-false quiz for his class. He flips a coin before writing the first question. If it is heads, he writes a true statement and if it is tails, he writes a false statement. He continues this until all five statements are written. What is the probability that the correct sequence of answers is TFTFT ? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Options:

A: \frac{1}{256}
B: \frac{1}{32}
C: \frac{1}{16}
D: \frac{1}{1024}
E: \frac{1}{8}
F: \frac{1}{4}
G: \frac{1}{6}
H: \frac{1}{2}
I: \frac{1}{128}
J: \frac{1}{64}

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Mr. Patrick is making a five-question true-false quiz. He flips a coin before writing each question. If it's heads, he writes a true statement; if tails, false. I need to find the probability that the correct answer sequence is TFTFT. And express it as a common fraction.

Hmm, so each question's correctness is determined by a coin flip. That means for each question, there's a 50% chance it's true and 50% false. But wait, noâ€”actually, since he's flipping before each question, each has an independent 50% chance. So the process is like a series of independent Bernoulli trials with p=0.5 each.

The question is about the probability of a specific sequence: T, F, T, F, T. So for each position in the sequence, I need to check if it matches the desired outcome.

Let me break it down. The first question needs to be True (T), which happens with probability 1/2. The second needs to be False (F), also 1/2. Third is T again (1/2), fourth F (1/2), and fifth T (1/2). 

Since each flip is independent, the probability of all these happening in sequence is the product of each individual probability. So that's (1/2) multiplied five times.

Wait, but the sequence has 5 elements, right? Let me count: T F T F T. Yes, five questions. So that's 1/2 for each, so (1/2)^5.

What's (1/2)^5? Let me calculate that. 2^5 is 32, so 1/32. So the probability is 1/32.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other factor I should consider? Hmm, like maybe the number of possible sequences or something else? No, because each outcome is equally likely, each specific sequence has the same probability, which is (1/2)^n where n is the number of questions.

So yeah, for five questions, it's (1/2)^5 = 1/32. Looking at the options, option B is 1/32. So the answer should be B.

The probability of obtaining the specific sequence TFTFT when each question is determined by an independent coin flip (50% chance for True or False) is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual outcome. Since each flip is independent, the probability for each True (T) or False (F) is \( \frac{1}{2} \). For the sequence TFTFT, which has five elements, the probability is:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^5 = \frac{1}{32}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: \( \frac{1}{32} \)**

Answer: B
