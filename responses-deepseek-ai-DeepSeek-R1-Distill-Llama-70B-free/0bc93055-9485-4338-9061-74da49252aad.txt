Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about residuals in a regression line. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking which statement about residuals is true. The options are A through J. I remember that residuals are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression model. So they tell us how well the model fits each data point.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The sum of the residuals is always one. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I recall that in regression, the sum of the residuals is actually zero. Because the regression line is calculated such that the mean of the residuals is zero. So the sum would be zero, not one. So A is incorrect.

Option B: If the correlation is 0, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. Wait, if the correlation is zero, that means the variables are unrelated. So the regression line would be a horizontal line, probably at the mean of Y. The residuals would just be random around that line. So the residual plot would show a random scatter, not a distinct pattern. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: The larger the residuals, the better the linear model. No, that doesn't make sense. Larger residuals mean the model's predictions are further off from the actual data points. So a good model should have smaller residuals. So C is wrong.

Option D: The residuals are always negative. No way. Residuals can be positive or negative, depending on whether the observed value is above or below the regression line. So D is incorrect.

Option E: If the correlation is 1, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. If correlation is 1, that's a perfect positive linear relationship. The regression line would pass through all points. So the residuals would all be zero, right? So the residual plot would show all points lying on the line, but that's not a 'distinct pattern' as in some trend; it's more like no variation. Wait, but I'm not sure. If the correlation is 1, every residual is zero, so the residual plot would have all points on the residual=0 line, meaning no spread. So the pattern would be a straight line. But wait, what's the residual plot? It's residual versus fitted values. If all residuals are zero, it's a horizontal line. So maybe E is correct? But wait, the option says "distinct pattern". If there's a perfect correlation, residuals are zero, so the plot would show a flat line. Alternatively, maybe if the correlation is not perfect, there might be a pattern, but in the case of perfect correlation, no. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I'll have to think about this more.

Option F: The residual plot will always be a straight line. No, that's not true. The residual plot should show a random scatter around zero if the model is good. If the residual plot is a straight line, that would imply a trend, which suggests the model isn't capturing the relationship properly. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Influential scores have large residuals. Influential observations are those that have a big effect on the regression line. They could have large residuals, but not necessarily always. Also, sometimes they are just outliers in the X variable. So I'm not sure if this is always true. Wait, isn't an influential point one that, when removed, changes the regression coefficients a lot? It might be a point with high leverage, which is about the X value being far from others. So not necessarily large residuals. So G might not be correct.

Option H: The mean of the residuals is always zero. Yes, I remember this. The regression line is calculated such that the sum of residuals is zero. So the mean would be zero for sure. So H is correct. But I should check all options.

Option I: If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals. Wait, that doesn't have to be true. The model being good means the residuals are randomly scattered around zero. So they might not balance out exactly. For example, maybe more positives than negatives, but their sum is zero. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The residuals can never be zero. No, that's wrong. If a data point lies exactly on the regression line, its residual is zero. So J is incorrect.

So the correct options so far: H seems correct. But let me go back to option E. If the correlation is 1, then the residual plot would have all points on the line. So the residual plot would show a distinct pattern, which is a straight line. So E would be correct? Wait, the statement says "If the correlation is 1, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot." So the residual plot would show all residuals being zero, so yes, it's a distinct pattern (a flat line). So E would be correct. But wait, earlier I thought the sum of the residuals is zero, and when the model is perfect, all residuals are zero, making the sum zero.

Wait, but the question is which statement is true. So H says the mean of residuals is zero, which is always true. So both E and H could be correct? Let me re-examine.

When the correlation is 1, the residual plot would have zero residuals, so the plot would be a straight line (all points on y=0). So E's statement is correct. But H is also correct because the mean of residuals is always zero.

Wait, but the question is about which of the following is true, and each option is a separate statement. So perhaps both E and H are true. But looking back, the options are A through J, and only one option can be correct. So I need to check which of these is correct.

Wait, another thought: When the correlation is 1, every predicted value equals the actual value, so residuals are zero. Therefore, the residual plot has all points at residual=0. So it's a straight horizontal line. So E's statement is correct in that case. So E is correct. But H is also correct because the mean of residuals is zero. So now I'm a bit confused because that would mean both E and H are correct, but that can't be the case because it's a single-answer question.

Wait, the question says "which of the following statements is true." So perhaps more than one statement is true, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the sum of the residuals is zero, so the mean would be zero. That's definitely correct, making H correct. So H is correct. What about E? When the correlation is 1, the residual plot is a straight line (all points at zero). So E's statement is correct. So both H and E are correct?

Wait, but the residual plot when correlation is 1 would have all residuals as zero, so the plot is a straight line. So E's statement is correct. But earlier I thought H is correct. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should review the statements again.

Option H: The mean of the residuals is always zero. Yes, that's a property of the least squares regression. The sum of residuals is zero, so their mean is zero. So H is correct.

Option E: If the correlation is 1, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot. Well, when correlation is 1, the residual plot is a horizontal line at zero. So it's a distinct pattern, which is a straight line. So E is also correct.

Wait, that's a problem because the question expects only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me think again. The correct answer must be H because it's a fundamental property. But let's check each option again.

Option B: If the correlation is 0, the residual plot shows a random scatter, not a distinct pattern. So B is incorrect.

Option E: Correlation 1 leads to residuals all zero, so the plot is a straight line (distinct pattern). So E is correct.

So now I'm torn between E and H.

Wait, the question is about choosing the correct statement. So if both E and H are correct, but looking at the options, which one is among the choices.

Wait, looking back at the options:

The options are:

A: sum residuals is 1 → incorrect.

B: correlation 0 → distinct pattern → incorrect, it's random.

C: larger residuals → better model → wrong.

D: residuals always negative → wrong.

E: correlation 1 → distinct pattern → correct.

F: residual plot always straight → wrong, unless perfect model.

G: influential → large residuals → not necessarily, as leverage is different.

H: mean residuals zero → correct.

I: good model → same number positive and negative residuals → not necessarily.

J: residuals never zero → wrong.

So both E and H are correct statements. But the options don't include both. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering E.

Wait, when the correlation is 1, the residual plot is a straight line (all on the same line, y=0). So E's statement is correct. But H is also correct.

But the question provides only one correct answer, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about what the mean of residuals is. It is always zero for any regression model because the regression line is calculated to minimize the sum of squared residuals, and one of the properties is that the sum of residuals is zero. So H is definitely correct.

Now, for E: if the correlation is 1, then yes, the residual plot would show a distinct pattern (a straight line). But E is also correct. But the options may not have both E and H as correct. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the residual plot for a perfect correlation (r=1) would have all residuals at zero, which would make a straight line, which is a distinct pattern. So E is correct.

So if both E and H are correct, but the options only have one correct, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the residual plot.

Wait, another approach: for any regression line, the sum of the residuals is zero. So H is correct.

But for E, when correlation is 1, the residual plot is a straight line, so E is correct.

But the given options may not have both, meaning perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about each option again.

The correct answer must be that the mean of residuals is zero, which is H.

But E is also correct, but perhaps E is not among the options. Wait, looking back, E is an option.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for other correct statements.

Wait, let me think about another option: G: Influential scores have large residuals. Influential points can have large residuals, but sometimes they don't. For example, a point with high leverage (extreme X) might have a small residual but still be influential because removing it changes the regression line. So G is not necessarily true.

So the only statements that are definitely true are H and E, but the question expects one answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the residual plot when r=1 would have all points at zero, which is a distinct pattern, so E is correct.

But H is also correct. So which one is among the options as the correct answer?

The options are from A to J, and the question is a single choice. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but why is E incorrect? Because when r=1, the residual plot is a straight line, which is a distinct pattern. So E is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to proceed. Since both E and H are correct, but the options are given as separate, perhaps the intended answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps E is incorrect because when r=1, the residual plot doesn't show a distinct pattern. Wait, no, when r=1, all residuals are zero, so the plot is a straight line, so E is correct.

But then, why is E and H both correct? But the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering H. Let me think again.

Sum of residuals is zero → mean is zero → H is correct.

So I think the intended answer is H. So perhaps the correct answer is H.

For the regression line, residuals represent the differences between observed values and the values predicted by the regression model. Let us analyze each option to determine which statement is true:

- **Option A**: "The sum of the residuals is always one." This is incorrect because the sum of the residuals in a regression model is always zero, not one.

- **Option B**: "If the correlation is 0, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot." This is incorrect. When the correlation is 0, the variables are unrelated, and the residual plot will show a random scatter, not a distinct pattern.

- **Option C**: "The larger the residuals, the better the linear model." This is incorrect. Larger residuals indicate a poorer fit of the model to the data.

- **Option D**: "The residuals are always negative." This is incorrect. Residuals can be positive or negative, depending on whether the observed value is above or below the regression line.

- **Option E**: "If the correlation is 1, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot." This is correct. When the correlation is 1, the relationship is perfect, and all residuals are zero. The residual plot will show a distinct pattern: a straight horizontal line at zero.

- **Option F**: "The residual plot will always be a straight line." This is incorrect. A residual plot will only be a straight line if the model is perfect (e.g., when the correlation is 1). Otherwise, it should show a random scatter.

- **Option G**: "Influential scores have large residuals." This is not necessarily true. Influential observations may have large residuals, but they can also have high leverage (extreme X values) without large residuals.

- **Option H**: "The mean of the residuals is always zero." This is correct. The regression line is calculated such that the sum of the residuals is zero, making the mean of the residuals zero.

- **Option I**: "If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals." This is incorrect. A good model will have residuals randomly scattered around zero, but the number of positive and negative residuals does not have to be equal.

- **Option J**: "The residuals can never be zero." This is incorrect. If a data point lies exactly on the regression line, its residual will be zero.

Both **Option E** and **Option H** are correct. However, since the question expects only one correct answer, **Option H** is the more fundamental and universally true statement about residuals in regression analysis.

Answer: H
