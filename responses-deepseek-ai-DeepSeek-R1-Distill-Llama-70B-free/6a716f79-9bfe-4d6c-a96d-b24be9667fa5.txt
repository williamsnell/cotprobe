Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking me to find the number that makes the statement true: 26.1 mm equals _ dm. And then there are a bunch of options labeled A through J. 

Alright, I remember that converting between millimeters and decimeters involves understanding the metric system prefixes. Let me think. Millimeters are smaller units, right? Decimeters are bigger. So I'm converting from a smaller unit to a larger one, which means the number should get smaller, not bigger. That probably means I'll have to divide by something.

Wait, the metric prefixes... milli- is 10^-3, and deci- is 10^-1. So to convert from millimeters to decimeters, I need to go from 10^-3 to 10^-1. How do I do that? Oh right, I subtract the exponents because I'm going from smaller to larger units. So 10^-3 divided by 10^-1 equals 10^(-3 - (-1)) = 10^-2. So I have to divide by 100, or move the decimal point two places to the left.

Let me apply that to 26.1 mm. If I move the decimal two places left, that would make it 0.261 dm. So the answer should be 0.261, right?

Looking at the options, option D is 0.261. So I think D is the correct answer. Let me double-check. 1 dm is 100 mm. So 26.1 mm is 26.1/100 dm, which is 0.261. Yep, that makes sense. None of the other options seem right. For example, option I is 2.61, which would mean I only moved the decimal one place, which would be converting to centimeters, maybe. So yeah, D is the one.

The correct answer is D: 0.261. To convert millimeters to decimeters, divide by 100 (since 1 dm = 100 mm). Thus, 26.1 mm รท 100 = 0.261 dm.

Answer: D
