Question:

Late one evening a man was driving home from his job as a security guard at a jewefry store. As the man approached a railroad crossing he noticed that the barriers to the crossing were open. The man cautiously looked both ways for any train. Assuming that no train was coming, he proceeded across the railroad tracks. Suddenly, an oncoming train struck the man's car, completely demolishing it. The man was dead on arrival at the local hospital. Unknown to the man, the railroad crossing guard, in a drunken stupor, had fallen asleep at the barrier controls. He failed to see or hear the signals from the oncoming train that struck and killed the man. The railroad company was well aware of the crossing guard's alcoholism, but continued to employ him. However, two weeks after the accident occurred, the railroad company fired the crossing guard. The executor of the man's estate institutes a wrongful death action against the railroad company. During the trial, the attorney for the man's estate offered into proof the fact that the defendant railroad company dismissed the crossing guard shortly after the accident. Upon objection by the railroad company's attorney, the court should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, as the employee's dismissal was an admission that the railroad company was aware of the crossing guard's chronic alcoholism.
B: sustain the objection, as the dismissal is irrelevant to the case at hand.
C: sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible.
D: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is direct evidence of negligence.
E: overrule the objection, as an adoptive admission by conduct.
F: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is evidence of the railroad company's knowledge of the guard's incompetence.
G: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could unduly influence the jury.
H: sustain the objection, because the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
I: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is circumstantial evidence of negligence.
J: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could be seen as an admission of guilt.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with wrongful death and admissibility of evidence. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The situation is that a man was killed when a train hit his car at a railroad crossing. The barriers were open, and the crossing guard, who was drunk, fell asleep and didn't signal properly. The railroad company knew about his alcoholism but kept him employed. Two weeks after the accident, they fired him. Now, the executor of the man's estate is suing the railroad company for wrongful death.

During the trial, the estate's attorney wants to introduce the fact that the railroad company fired the crossing guard after the accident. The railroad's attorney objects, and the court has to decide whether to overrule or sustain that objection.

The options are A through J, each presenting a different reason for the court's ruling.

I remember that evidence law has certain rules about what can be admitted. One key concept is that subsequent remedial measures are generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. I think this is under Federal Rule of Evidence 407. The idea is that if you fix something after an accident, that shouldn't be used against you as an admission of guilt because it might discourage people from making repairs.

So in this case, the railroad fired the guard two weeks after the accident. That's a subsequent action. The question is whether this action can be used as evidence against the railroad.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the court should sustain the objection because evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible. That sounds like it's citing Rule 407, which would make sense here. But wait, firing an employee isn't exactly a "remedial repair" in the traditional sense, like fixing a broken gate or repainting a warning sign. However, Rule 407 also covers other subsequent measures taken to address a problem, not just physical repairs. So firing the incompetent employee could be seen as a remedial measure.

But another angle is whether the dismissal is being offered for a purpose other than showing negligence. For example, if the railroad knew about the guard's alcoholism before the accident, that's relevant. But the dismissal after the fact might be trying to show that they recognized he was a problem, which could imply prior knowledge.

Wait, but under Rule 407, even if the subsequent action is being offered for a different purpose, like to show ownership or control, it's still inadmissible if it's a subsequent remedial measure. So if the railroad fired the guard as a remedial measure, then evidence of the firing is inadmissible to prove negligence.

Looking at the options again, option C is about remedial repairs, which might be too narrow. Option F says the dismissal is evidence of the railroad's knowledge of the guard's incompetence. If the firing is being used to show that the railroad knew he was incompetent before the accident, then maybe it's admissible for that purpose. But wait, the railroad's knowledge is already established because the question says the company was aware of the guard's alcoholism. So maybe the dismissal isn't needed for that purpose.

Alternatively, if the dismissal is a subsequent remedial measure, then under Rule 407, it's inadmissible. So the court should sustain the objection based on that rule.

Looking at the options, option C is about subsequent remedial repairs, which seems to fit. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but another thought: Sometimes, subsequent actions can be admissible if they're not remedial but rather indicative of another factor. But I think the general rule is that subsequent remedial measures are inadmissible. So the court should sustain the objection on that basis.

So the answer should be C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a wrongful death case, specifically whether the railroad company's dismissal of the crossing guard after the accident can be introduced as evidence. The key legal principle here is Federal Rule of Evidence 407, which generally bars the admission of subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence or culpable conduct. 

In this scenario, the railroad company fired the crossing guard two weeks after the accident. This action could be construed as a subsequent remedial measure taken to address the problem of the guard's alcoholism. While the dismissal might imply the company recognized the guard's incompetence, Rule 407 prohibits using such measures to prove negligence. The railroad's prior knowledge of the guard's alcoholism is already established, so the dismissal does not serve an additional purpose that would warrant its admissibility.

Given this analysis, the court should sustain the objection because the dismissal falls under the category of subsequent remedial measures, which are inadmissible under Rule 407.
