Okay, so I have this physics problem here about waves in a pool of water. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that the frequency of an oscillating source is 3 Hz. I remember that frequency is how many times something happens per second, right? So here, the source is making waves 3 times each second.

And the wavelength observed is 0.5 meters. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of the wave. So each wave is half a meter long from start to finish.

Wait, the question is asking for the speed of the wave. Oh right, I remember there's a formula that connects wave speed, frequency, and wavelength. I think it's v = f * Î». Yeah, that's right. So the speed equals frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

So plugging in the numbers: frequency is 3 Hz and wavelength is 0.5 m. So 3 times 0.5 is 1.5. So the speed should be 1.5 m/s.

Let me look at the options. Option D is 1.5 m/sec, so that should be the correct answer. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check if I used the right formula. Sometimes I mix up the variables. Oh yeah, velocity of a wave is definitely frequency times wavelength. So yes, 3 * 0.5 is 1.5, so D is the choice.

The wave speed is calculated using the formula \( v = f \cdot \lambda \), where \( f = 3 \, \text{Hz} \) and \( \lambda = 0.5 \, \text{m} \). Substituting the values, \( v = 3 \cdot 0.5 = 1.5 \, \text{m/sec} \). Among the options, the correct answer is:

D: 1.5 m/sec.

Answer: D
