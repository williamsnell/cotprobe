Okay, so I have this question about Evan and Freeman's principles from 1993. The question is about determining who constitutes a certain term using two principles. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Freeman and Evan are known for their work in stakeholder theory. I think their 1993 paper might be about how businesses should consider various stakeholders, not just shareholders. So the question is probably related to that.

The question asks about two principles: the first blank and the second blank. The options given include terms like corporate liability, rights, responsibility, effect, deniability, etc. I'm trying to remember what Freeman and Evan's specific principles were.

I recall that Freeman talked about the principle of corporate rights and the principle of corporate effects. The idea was that if an action affects a group, they should have some rights or say in the matter. So, the two principles are likely "corporate rights" and "corporate effect."

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. The principle of corporate effect suggests that if a group is affected by the corporation's actions, they're a stakeholder. The principle of corporate rights says that if the corporation affects them, they should have some rights. So combining these two, you can determine who is a stakeholder.

So the question structure is: Principle of [X] and Principle of [Y] determine who is a [Z]. According to this, Z should be a stakeholder.

Looking back at the options, let's see which ones fit.

Option A: ... Stakeholder. The first two are corporate liability and effect. Not sure.

Option B: Corporate rights, effect, stakeholder. That fits because the two principles are rights and effect, leading to stakeholder.

Option C: Rights and effect, but ends with shareholder. No, because the theory is about stakeholders beyond just shareholders.

Option G: Rights, responsibility, stakeholder. Hmm, I don't think responsibility is one of the principles in question here.

Option J: Deniability, effect, stakeholder. Deniability doesn't sound right.

So option B and option G are possibilities, but I'm leaning towards B because it's rights and effect.

Wait, another thought: I think Freeman and Evan's work introduced the principles of corporate rights and corporate effect. So the correct blanks would be those two, leading to determining a stakeholder.

So the correct answer should be B: Corporate rights, Corporate effect, Stakeholder.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B says the first two are Corporate rights and Corporate effect, and the third is Stakeholder. So that fits.

Yes, I'm confident now. The answer is B.

The question asks about Evan and Freeman's (1993) principles used to determine who constitutes a specific term. Freeman and Evan's work is associated with stakeholder theory, which emphasizes considering various groups affected by a corporation's actions. The two relevant principles are the "Principle of Corporate Rights" and the "Principle of Corporate Effect." The former suggests that groups affected by corporate actions should have rights, while the latter implies that any group impacted by a corporation is a stakeholder. Combining these principles helps identify stakeholders.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Refers to "corporate liability" and "corporate effect," which do not align with the principles in question.
- **Option B**: Lists "corporate rights," "corporate effect," and "stakeholder," which matches the principles and their purpose.
- **Option C**: Ends with "shareholder," which is inconsistent with the broader focus on stakeholders.
- **Option G**: Includes "corporate responsibility," which is not one of the specific principles mentioned.
- **Option J**: Mentions "corporate deniability," which is unrelated to the context.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the principles of corporate rights and corporate effect determining who constitutes a stakeholder.

B
