Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again. 

The question is about hypothesis testing. The setup is that we're doing 10 independent tests. Each test is a one-tailed test where the null hypothesis H0 is that the mean mu is 25, and the alternative hypothesis Ha is that mu is less than 25. Each test is done at an alpha significance level of 0.05. The question is asking for the probability of committing a Type I error, which means incorrectly rejecting a true H0, in at least one of those 10 tests.

Hmm, okay. I remember that a Type I error is when you reject the null hypothesis, but it's actually true. The probability of that is the alpha level, which is 0.05 here. But since we're doing multiple tests, this might be a case where the probabilities compound.

Wait, so each test has a 5% chance of a Type I error. But doing 10 tests, what's the chance that at least one of them will have a Type I error? Oh, right, because each test is independent, I think we can model this as the probability of at least one success in multiple Bernoulli trials.

I think the formula for the probability of at least one Type I error in multiple tests is 1 minus the probability of not making a Type I error in any of the tests. Because the probability of not rejecting H0 when it's true is 1 - alpha for each test. Since the tests are independent, we can multiply these probabilities for each test.

So for one test, the probability of not committing a Type I error is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. For 10 tests, it's (0.95)^10. Then the probability of at least one Type I error is 1 - (0.95)^10.

Let me calculate that. 0.95^10. Let me see, 0.95^2 is 0.9025. Then 0.95^4 would be (0.9025)^2 ≈ 0.8145. 0.95^8 is (0.8145)^2 ≈ 0.6634. Hmm, but wait, 0.95^10 isn't 0.95^8 * 0.95^2. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 0.95^10. Let me use logarithms or natural exponents, but maybe I can approximate. Alternatively, I might remember that (0.95)^10 is approximately 0.5987. So 1 - 0.5987 is about 0.4013, so roughly 0.40. 

Looking at the options, option J is 0.40. So that must be the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. Each test is independent, so the probability of no Type I error in 10 tests is indeed (1 - α)^10. So 1 - (0.95)^10 is the probability we're looking for. And (0.95)^10 is about 0.5987, so 1 - 0.5987 ≈ 0.4013, which is approximately 0.40. So the answer is J, 0.40.

The question involves calculating the probability of committing a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis) in at least one of 10 independent tests. Each test is conducted at an α = 0.05 significance level, and the null hypothesis H0: μ = 25 is tested against the alternative hypothesis Ha: μ < 25.

A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. For a single test, the probability of a Type I error is α = 0.05. However, since there are 10 independent tests, the probability of committing at least one Type I error across all tests is calculated as:

\[
P(\text{at least one Type I error}) = 1 - P(\text{no Type I errors in all 10 tests}).
\]

The probability of not committing a Type I error in a single test is \( 1 - \alpha = 0.95 \). For 10 independent tests, the probability of no Type I errors is:

\[
P(\text{no Type I errors in 10 tests}) = (1 - \alpha)^{10} = (0.95)^{10}.
\]

Using approximations, \( (0.95)^{10} \approx 0.5987 \). Therefore, the probability of committing at least one Type I error is:

\[
P(\text{at least one Type I error}) = 1 - 0.5987 \approx 0.4013.
\]

This value is approximately 0.40. Among the given options, the closest match is **J: 0.40**.
