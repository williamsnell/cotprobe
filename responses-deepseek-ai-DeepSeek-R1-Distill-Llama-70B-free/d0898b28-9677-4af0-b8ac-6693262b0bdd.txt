Question:

Two pumping systems are being considered for use on a project. The gasoline pump will cost $3,500, has a 6 year life year, and a $500 salvage value. Annual operating and repair costs would be $2,000 the first year, and would rise $300 each succeeding year. The electric pumping system costs $12,000, has a life of 6 years and a salvage value of $1,000. Annual operating and maintenance costs would be $1,000 the first year, and would rise $150 each year. If the current interest rate is 10%, compare the equivalent annual costs of the two pumping systems. Assume all maintenance and repair costs are paid at the end of each year.

Options:

A: The electric pump has higher initial cost but lower overall cost due to lower maintenance
B: Both pumps have the same costs
C: Both pumps have variable costs that depend on the price of fuel and electricity
D: The gasoline pump is more economical by $200 annually
E: The costs vary each year, making one more economical than the other in different years
F: The gasoline pump is more economical
G: The gasoline pump has a better salvage value, making it more economical
H: The costs cannot be compared
I: The electric pump is more economical
J: The electric pump is more economical by $500 annually

Okay, so I've got this question about two pumping systems, and I need to figure out which one is more economical based on their equivalent annual costs. Hmm, I remember that equivalent annual cost involves calculating the present value of all the costs and then spreading them out over the years. Both pumps have initial costs, annual operating costs that increase each year, and salvage values. Plus, the interest rate is 10%, so I'll need to use that in my calculations.

Let me start by listing out the details for each pump.

Gasoline Pump:
- Initial cost: $3,500
- Life: 6 years
- Salvage value: $500
- Annual operating costs: Start at $2,000 and increase by $300 each year. So the costs each year would be:
  Year 1: $2,000
  Year 2: $2,300
  Year 3: $2,600
  Year 4: $2,900
  Year 5: $3,200
  Year 6: $3,500

Electric Pump:
- Initial cost: $12,000
- Life: 6 years
- Salvage value: $1,000
- Annual operating costs: Start at $1,000 and increase by $150 each year. So:
  Year 1: $1,000
  Year 2: $1,150
  Year 3: $1,300
  Year 4: $1,450
  Year 5: $1,600
  Year 6: $1,750

Wait, so the annual costs for each are an arithmetic series increasing each year. Since the costs are paid at the end of each year, I can model them as an annuity.

The formula for the equivalent annual cost (EAC) is the present worth (PW) of all cash flows divided by the capital recovery factor (CRF). The CRF is (i*(1+i)^n)/((1+i)^n -1), where i is the interest rate and n the life.

First, I'll calculate the PW for each pump, including the initial cost, annual costs, and salvage value.

For the Gasoline Pump:

Initial cost (PW) = -3,500 (a negative because it's a cost)
Annual operating costs: Each year's cost is an increasing amount. I can model this as a gradient increasing annuity. The formula for the present worth of a gradient (G) is G*(P/G, i, n). Alternatively, since it's a uniform increase each year, the present worth can be calculated as the sum of each year's cost divided by (1+i)^t.

Alternatively, I can compute the present value of each annual cost and sum them up. Let's try that.

Year 1: 2000 / (1.10)^1
Year 2: 2300 / (1.10)^2
Year 3: 2600 / (1.10)^3
Year 4: 2900 / (1.10)^4
Year 5: 3200 / (1.10)^5
Year 6: 3500 / (1.10)^6

Similarly for the Electric Pump.

But maybe it's easier to use the formula for the present worth of an arithmetic gradient. The formula is:

PW = (A/P, i, n) * (C1 + (G*(1+i))/(i)) )

Wait, no, the formula for the present worth of a gradient is:

PW = G * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i^2 - n/(i*(1+i)^n) ) ]

Alternatively, sometimes it's represented as PW = G * (P/G, i, n), where P/G is the present worth gradient factor.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I could just calculate each year's cost, discount them back to present, and sum them, then add the initial cost and subtract the salvage value (which is a cash inflow, so positive).

Let me create a table for each pump.

Starting with Gasoline Pump:

Year 0: -3500
Years 1-6: Operating costs as given, and in year 6, add the salvage value of +500.

So for each year t from 1 to 6:

At t=1: 2000
t=2:2300
t=3:2600
t=4:2900
t=5:3200
t=6:3500 - but subtract the salvage value? Wait, no. Salvage is received at the end of year 6, so it's a cash inflow. So the net cash flow in year 6 is (3500 operating cost) - 500 (salvage) = 3000.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The initial cost is at t=0, and each year's operating cost is an outflow at the end of the year. Salvage value is a cash inflow at the end of year 6. So for each year, t=1 to 6, the net cash flow is:

t=1: -2000
t=2: -2300
...
t=6: -(3500 - 500) = -3000?

Wait, no, that's not correct. The operating cost each year is a cash outflow, and the salvage is a separate cash inflow. So in year 6, you have the operating cost of 3500 outflow and 500 inflow. So net cash flow for year 6 is -3500 +500 = -3000.

Wait, no, because the operating cost is 3500, so cash out is 3500, and salvage is 500 received, so net is -3000.

So for each year, cash flows are:

Year 0: -3500
Year 1: -2000
Year 2: -2300
...
Year 6: -3000

Wait, no, the initial cost is at t=0, and each year from 1 to 6 has the operating cost. Then, in year 6, you get the salvage, which is +500. So the cash flow in year 6 is -3500 +500 = -3000.

So for each pump, I need to calculate the present worth of all cash flows.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the present value of each year's cash flow and sum them.

So let's compute the present value for Gasoline:

i=10% or 0.10.

PW_gasoline = -3500 + [ -2000/(1.10) -2300/(1.10)^2 -2600/(1.10)^3 -2900/(1.10)^4 -3200/(1.10)^5 -3000/(1.10)^6 ]

Wait, no. Because the operating costs are each year, and the salvage is a separate cash inflow in year 6. So it's:

PW_gasoline = -3500 + (-2000)/(1.10) + (-2300)/(1.10)^2 + (-2600)/(1.10)^3 + (-2900)/(1.10)^4 + (-3200)/(1.10)^5 + ( -3500 + 500 )/(1.10)^6 

Wait, because in year 6, you have both the operating cost and the salvage. So the net is -3500 +500 = -3000. So:

PW = -3500 + (sum from t=1 to 6 of (-cost_t)/(1.10)^t ) + (500)/(1.10)^6 

Alternatively, to compute each term:

Let me compute each term step by step.

Gasoline Pump:

Year 0: -3500

Year 1: -2000 → PV: -2000 / 1.10 = approx -1818.18

Year 2: -2300 → PV: -2300 / (1.10)^2 ≈ -2300 / 1.21 ≈ -1900.83

Year3: -2600 → PV: -2600 / 1.331 ≈ -1954.02

Year4: -2900 → PV: -2900 / (1.4641) ≈ -1978.99

Year5: -3200 → PV: -3200 / 1.61051 ≈ -1986.08

Year6: -3500 +500 = -3000 → PV: -3000 / (1.771561) ≈ -1694.74

Now sum all these:

PW = (-3500) + (-1818.18) + (-1900.83) + (-1954.02) + (-1978.99) + (-1986.08) + (-1694.74)

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign. The initial cost is a cash outflow, so it's negative. The annual operating costs are also cash outflows (so negative). The salvage is a cash inflow, so positive. So in year 6, the net cash flow is (-3500 + 500) = -3000, which is negative, so I think that's correct.

So let's compute each term:

-3500

-2000/1.10 = -1818.18

-2300/1.21 = -1900.83

-2600/(1.331) ≈ -1954.02

-2900/(1.4641) ≈ -1978.99

-3200/(1.61051) ≈ -1986.08

-3000/(1.771561) ≈ -1694.74

Now sum all these:

Start with -3500.

Add (-1818.18) → -5318.18

Add (-1900.83) → -7218.01

Add (-1954.02) → -9172.03

Add (-1978.99) → -11151.02

Add (-1986.08) → -13137.1

Add (-1694.74) → -14831.84

So PW for Gasoline is approximately -$14,831.84.

Now for the Electric Pump:

Initial cost: -12,000

Salvage: +1000 at end of year 6.

Annual operating costs:

Year1: -1000

Year2: -1150

Year3: -1300

Year4: -1450

Year5: -1600

Year6: -1750 + 1000 = -750

Wait, similar to Gasoline, the operating cost is 1750, but you get 1000 back in salvage, so net cash flow in year6 is -750.

So the present worth would be:

PW_electric = -12,000 + [ (-1000)/(1.10) + (-1150)/(1.10)^2 + (-1300)/(1.10)^3 + (-1450)/(1.10)^4 + (-1600)/(1.10)^5 + (-750)/(1.10)^6 ]

Let me compute each term:

Year0: -12,000

Year1: -1000/1.10 ≈ -909.09

Year2: -1150/1.21 ≈ -951.24

Year3: -1300/1.331 ≈ -976.53

Year4: -1450/1.4641 ≈ -990.29

Year5: -1600/1.61051 ≈ -994.08

Year6: -750 / 1.771561 ≈ -423.33

Now sum all these:

Start with -12,000.

Add (-909.09) → -12,909.09

Add (-951.24) → -13,860.33

Add (-976.53) → -14,836.86

Add (-990.29) → -15,827.15

Add (-994.08) → -16,821.23

Add (-423.33) → -17,244.56

So PW_electric ≈ -$17,244.56.

Wait, but wait, the gasoline pump's PW was around -$14,831.84, and electric is -$17,244.56. That would imply the gasoline pump has a lower present worth cost, meaning it's cheaper. So the equivalent annual cost would be lower for gasoline, making it more economical.

Wait, but I thought the electric might be better because of lower initial costs in operating, but maybe the higher initial cost of the electric pump makes it worse.

Wait, but let me think again. The present worth represents the total cost in present value terms. Lower (more negative) present worth means higher total cost. So Gasoline has a PW of -14,831.84, while Electric is -17,244.56. Wait, no, wait! No, because the initial cost is a larger negative. So Electric has a more negative PW, meaning higher total cost. So Gasoline is cheaper.

Wait, but perhaps I got the signs wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, the present worth is calculated as the sum of the present values of all cash flows. Initial costs are negative (cash out), annual costs are negative, and salvage is positive.

So when I sum them, the more negative the present worth, the higher the total cost.

Gasoline PW: -14,831.84

Electric PW: -17,244.56

So Electric's PW is more negative, meaning higher total cost. So Gasoline is cheaper overall.

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for equivalent annual costs. So I need to convert these present worth values into annual payments.

The formula for EAC is PW * (A/P, i, n), where (A/P, i, n) is the capital recovery factor.

(A/P, i, n) = (i*(1+i)^n)/((1+i)^n -1 )

i=0.10, n=6.

Compute (1.10)^6 = approx 1.771561

So (A/P) = 0.10 * 1.771561 / (1.771561 -1 ) = 0.1771561 / 0.771561 ≈ 0.22964, or about 22.964%.

So EAC = PW * 0.22964

Compute EAC for Gasoline:

EAC_gas = (-14,831.84) * 0.22964 ≈ ?

Let me compute 14,831.84 * 0.22964. Let's approximate:

14,831.84 * 0.2 = 2,966.37

14,831.84 * 0.02964 ≈ Let's see, 14,831.84 * 0.03 ≈ 444.95, but 0.02964 is 0.03 minus 0.00036. So approx 444.95 - (14,831.84 * 0.00036) = 444.95 - approx 5.34 = 439.61.

Total EAC_gas ≈ 2,966.37 + 439.61 ≈ 3,405.98. Since the PW was negative, EAC is negative, meaning about -$3,406 per year.

Similarly for Electric:

PW_electric = -17,244.56

EAC_elec = (-17,244.56) * 0.22964 ≈ ?

17,244.56 * 0.22964 ≈

17,244.56 * 0.2 = 3,448.91

17,244.56 * 0.02964 ≈ Approximately 17,244.56 * 0.03 = 517.37, minus 17,244.56 * 0.00036 = approx 6.208. So 517.37 -6.208 ≈ 511.16.

Total ≈ 3,448.91 +511.16= 3,960.07. So EAC is about -$3,960 per year.

So comparing EAC_gas (-$3,406) vs EAC_elec (-$3,960). The more negative EAC means higher annual cost. Wait no, because EAC is the equivalent annual cost, so lower (more negative) is better? Wait, no. Wait, the EAC is the annualized cost. So if Gasoline's EAC is lower in magnitude than Electric's, then Gasoline is cheaper.

Wait, no, the EAC is negative, representing a cost. So Gasoline's EAC is about -3,406, Electric's about -3,960. So which is better? Because -3,406 is higher than -3,960. Wait, no, because when considering costs, lower (more negative) is worse. So Gasoline's EAC is higher (less negative), meaning it's cheaper. So Gasoline is better.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, no, because the EAC represents the annual cost. So if Gasoline's EAC is -3,406, that's an annual cost of $3,406. Electric's EAC is -3,960, meaning $3,960 annual cost. So Gasoline is cheaper by $3,960 - $3,406 = $554 per year. But wait, my rough calculations may be off. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, let's recalculate the EAC more precisely.

For Gasoline:

PW_gas = -14,831.84

EAC = PW_gas * (A/P, 10%,6) = (-14,831.84) * 0.22964 ≈

Let me compute 14,831.84 * 0.22964:

Break it down:

0.2 *14,831.84 = 2,966.368

0.02 *14,831.84 = 296.6368

0.00964 *14,831.84 ≈ Let's compute 14,831.84 * 0.009 = 133.486, and 14,831.84 *0.00064≈9.49. So total ≈133.486 +9.49≈142.976.

Adding these: 2,966.368 +296.6368 = 3,262.0048 +142.976 ≈3,405.

So EAC_gas ≈ -$3,405 per year.

For Electric:

PW_elec = -17,244.56

EAC_elec = (-17,244.56) * 0.22964 ≈

Compute 17,244.56 *0.22964:

0.2 *17,244.56 = 3,448.912

0.02 *17,244.56 = 344.8912

0.00964 *17,244.56 ≈ 17,244.56 *0.009=155.201, and 17,244.56 *0.00064≈11.037.

So 155.201 +11.037≈166.238.

Adding: 3,448.912 + 344.8912 = 3,793.8032 +166.238≈3,960.041.

So EAC_elec ≈ -$3,960 per year.

So
