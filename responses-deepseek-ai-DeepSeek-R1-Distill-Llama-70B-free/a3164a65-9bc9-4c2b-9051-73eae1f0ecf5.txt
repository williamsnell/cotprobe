Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the mass of air in a closed chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question gives me.

The chamber's dimensions are 35 ft by 20 ft by 10 ft. So first, I think I need to find the volume. Volume is length times width times height, right? So 35 * 20 * 10. Let me calculate that. 35 times 20 is 700, and then times 10 is 7000 cubic feet. Okay, so volume V is 7000 ft³.

Next, the pressure is given as 17 lb per square inch. Oh wait, but I remember that in gas law equations, we need the pressure in absolute units, like pounds per square foot or something. Wait, no, maybe pounds per square inch absolute? Because standard atmospheric pressure is around 14.7 psi, so if the pressure is 17 psi, is that gauge or absolute? The question says it's closed, so I guess it's absolute. Or wait, maybe it's just given as absolute. Hmm, maybe I should proceed assuming it's absolute pressure. So P = 17 psi.

But wait, the ideal gas law uses pressure in specific units. Oh right, the ideal gas law in English units is often written as PV = nRT, where P is in psia, V in cubic feet, n in moles, R is the gas constant, and T in degrees Rankine.

So I need to make sure all the units are compatible. Let's see: R for air is usually 1716 ft·lb/(lbmol·R) when using lb units, but wait, I might be mixing up some numbers. Alternatively, sometimes R is given as 53.35 ft·lb/(mol·R), but I think that's when n is in moles. Wait, no, wait: the exact value of R depends on the units. Let me think again.

Wait, for air, the specific gas constant R is approximately 1716 ft·lb/(lbmol·R) when using lb-mass units. Or wait, maybe it's 53.3 ft·lb/(lbmol·R)? I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the ideal gas law in terms of density.

Wait, another approach: the ideal gas law can be written as PV = mRT, where m is mass, but then R is specific to the gas. Wait, for air, the molar mass is about 28.97 lb per lbmol. Oh wait, maybe I should think in terms of molar mass.

Let me try to lay it out:

Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT

Where:
P is pressure (lb/in² absolute)
V is volume (ft³)
n is number of moles (lbmol)
R is the gas constant (ft·lb/(lbmol·R))
T is temperature (Rankine)

So I need to convert all units properly.

First, let me convert the pressure from psi to psia. The question says the pressure is 17 lb/in². So if I assume that's absolute pressure, then P = 17 psia. If it were gauge, I'd have to add atmospheric pressure, but the question doesn't specify, so I'll proceed with 17 psia.

Wait, but wait: standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, so if the chamber's pressure is 17 psi, that's just a bit higher than atmospheric. So maybe it's absolute. I'll proceed with P =17 psia.

Next, the temperature is given as 75°F. I need to convert that to Rankine. The formula is Rankine = Fahrenheit + 459.67. So 75 + 459.67 is 534.67 R. Let's say approximately 534.67 R.

Now, the volume is 7000 ft³.

R, the gas constant for air, I think when using lb units, is 1716 ft·lb/(lbmol·R). Wait, no, wait: Alternatively, I've heard that for air, R is approximately 1716 ft·lb/(lbmol·R) when working with lb units. Or maybe it's 53.35 ft·lb/(lbmol·R). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should look it up. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, so I have to rely on memory. I think the correct value is 1716 ft·lb/(lbmol·R). Or wait, no, that can't be right because 1716 is a big number. Wait, perhaps 53.35? Let me think: 1 BTU is 778 ft·lb. The gas constant R is equal to 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·R), but that's in different units. Alternatively, R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up R in different unit systems. Let me get this straight. The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R). So when using psi, ft³, lbmol, and R, R is 10.7316.

But in our case, P is in psi, V in ft³, so that's compatible. So R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

So plug into PV = nRT.

We can solve for n (moles): n = PV/(RT).

So P is 17 psi, V is 7000 ft³, R is 10.7316, T is 534.67 R.

So n = (17 * 7000) / (10.7316 * 534.67).

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 17 *7000 = 119,000.

Denominator: 10.7316 * 534.67. Let's compute that. 10 * 534.67 is 5346.7. 0.7316 *534.67 is approximately 0.7 *534.67 = 374.27, 0.0316 *534.67≈16.89. So total ≈ 374.27 +16.89 =391.16. So denominator is approximately 5346.7 + 391.16 = 5737.86.

So n ≈ 119000 / 5737.86 ≈ approx 20.75 lbmol.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute 10.7316 *534.67.

Let me do 10.7316 *534.67:

10 *534.67 = 5346.7

0.7316 *534.67: Let's calculate.

534.67 *0.7 = 374.269

534.67 *0.0316 ≈ let's compute 534.67 *0.03 = 16.04, 534.67*0.0016≈0.856. So total≈16.04 +0.856=16.896.

So 374.269 +16.896 =391.165.

So total denominator is 5346.7 +391.165=5737.865.

So n=119000 /5737.865 ≈ let me compute 5737.865 *20 is 114756. So 20 is 114756. 119000 -114756=4244. So 4244 /5737.865 ≈ approx 0.74.

So n≈20.74 lbmol.

Now, molar mass of air is approximately 28.97 lb per lbmol. So mass m = n * M.

m =20.74 lbmol *28.97 lb/lbmol ≈ let's compute that.

20 *28.97=579.4.

0.74 *28.97≈21.42.

So total m≈579.4 +21.42=600.82 lbm.

Looking at the options, option C is 601 lbm. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes. Did I use the correct R? Because sometimes R is given as 1716 for different units. Wait, no, when using psi, ft³, and lbmol, R is 10.7316. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but another way to approach this is using the density formula. The ideal gas law can be written as density (rho) = (P M) / (R T). Let me try that approach to verify.

Where P is pressure in psi, M is molar mass (lb/lbmol), R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), T in Rankine.

So rho = (P * M) / (R T).

So P=17 psi, M=28.97 lb/lbmol, R=10.7316, T=534.67 R.

So rho = (17 *28.97) / (10.7316 *534.67).

Calculate numerator: 17 *28.97 = approx 491.49.

Denominator: same as before, 10.7316 *534.67≈5737.86.

So rho≈491.49 /5737.86 ≈ approx 0.0856 lbm/ft³.

Then, mass m is rho * V = 0.0856 lbm/ft³ *7000 ft³ ≈ 0.0856 *7000= 599.2 lbm, which is approximately 600 lbm.

Yes, that rounds to 601, which matches option C.

To find the mass of air in the closed chamber, we use the ideal gas law in the form:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

where:
- \(P\) is the pressure in absolute units (lb/in\(^2\)),
- \(V\) is the volume in cubic feet (ft\(^3\)),
- \(n\) is the number of moles (lbmol),
- \(R\) is the universal gas constant (\(10.7316 \, \text{psi·ft}^3/(\text{lbmol·R})\)),
- \(T\) is the temperature in Rankine (R).

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the chamber
The chamber dimensions are \(35 \, \text{ft} \times 20 \, \text{ft} \times 10 \, \text{ft}\), so:

\[
V = 35 \times 20 \times 10 = 7000 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

### Step 2: Convert pressure to absolute units
The pressure is given as \(17 \, \text{lb/in}^2\). Since the problem does not specify gauge pressure, we assume it is absolute pressure:

\[
P = 17 \, \text{psia}
\]

### Step 3: Convert temperature to Rankine
The temperature is given as \(75^\circ \text{F}\). To convert to Rankine:

\[
T = 75 + 459.67 = 534.67 \, \text{R}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for the number of moles (\(n\))
Using the ideal gas law:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
n = \frac{17 \times 7000}{10.7316 \times 534.67}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
17 \times 7000 = 119,000
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
10.7316 \times 534.67 \approx 5737.86
\]

Now, divide:
\[
n = \frac{119,000}{5737.86} \approx 20.74 \, \text{lbmol}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mass of air
The molar mass of air is approximately \(28.97 \, \text{lb/lbmol}\). The mass of air is:

\[
m = n \times M = 20.74 \times 28.97 \approx 600.82 \, \text{lbm}
\]

### Step 6: Verify using the density approach
The density of air can be calculated as:

\[
\rho = \frac{P \cdot M}{R \cdot T}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\rho = \frac{17 \times 28.97}{10.7316 \times 534.67}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
17 \times 28.97 \approx 491.49
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
10.7316 \times 534.67 \approx 5737.86
\]

Now, divide:
\[
\rho = \frac{491.49}{5737.86} \approx 0.0856 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3
\]

The mass of air is then:

\[
m = \rho \cdot V = 0.0856 \times 7000 \approx 599.2 \, \text{lbm}
\]

This rounds to \(601 \, \text{lbm}\), confirming the result.

### Final Answer:
The mass of air in the chamber is approximately **601 lbm**, which corresponds to option **C**.
