Okay, so I need to find the density of the potassium nucleus in tons per cubic centimeter. Hmm, density is mass over volume. Got it. Let me break it down.

The problem says the radius of the nucleus is 4e-13 cm. So first, I'll calculate the volume using the formula for a sphere, which is (4/3)πr³. Let me plug in the numbers. So r is 4e-13 cm. Cubing that would be (4)^3 = 64, times (1e-13)^3, which is 1e-39. So 64e-39. Multiply by 4/3 π, which is approximately 4.1888. So 4.1888 * 64e-39 = let's see, 4.1888 * 64 is about 268. So the volume is roughly 268e-39 cm³. Wait, no, 4/3 π is about 4.188, right. So yeah, 64e-39 *4.188 gives me 268e-39 cm³, which is 2.68e-37 cm³. Got that.

Next, mass. It says 6.02e23 nuclei weigh about 39 grams. Oh wait, 6.02e23 is Avogadro's number, so that's a mole. So the molar mass of potassium must be about 39 grams per mole, which makes sense because potassium's atomic weight is around 39 g/mol.

Wait, but I need the mass of a single nucleus. So 39 grams is for 6.02e23 nuclei. So per nucleus, the mass is 39g / 6.02e23. Let me compute that. 39 divided by 6.02 is approximately 6.48, so 6.48e-23 grams per nucleus. But wait, converting that to tons because the answer needs to be in tons/cm³.

Wait, 1 gram is 1e-3 kg, and 1 ton is 1e3 kg, so 1 gram is 1e-6 tons. So 6.48e-23 grams is 6.48e-29 tons. Oh wait, wait: 1 ton is 1e6 grams? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 kg is 1000 grams, and 1 ton is 1000 kg. So 1 ton is 1e6 grams. So 1 gram is 1e-6 tons. So 6.48e-23 grams = 6.48e-23 * 1e-6 tons = 6.48e-29 tons.

Wait no, wait: 1 ton = 1e3 kg = 1e6 grams. So 1 gram = 1e-6 tons. So yes, 6.48e-23 grams is 6.48e-29 tons.

So the mass per nucleus is 6.48e-29 tons.

Now, density is mass/volume. So mass is 6.48e-29 tons, and volume is 2.68e-37 cm³.

So density = 6.48e-29 / 2.68e-37 = let me calculate that. 6.48 / 2.68 is about 2.418. Then the exponents: 1e-29 / 1e-37 is 1e8. So 2.418e8 tons/cm³.

Wait, that would be around 2.4e8 tons/cm³. Let me look at the options.

Looking at options, option F is 2.7e8, which is close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have messed up some steps.

Wait, let me go through the steps again.

Volume calculation:

r = 4e-13 cm.

Volume = (4/3)πr³ = 4.1888*(4e-13)^3.

(4e-13)^3 = 64e-39 cm³.

Then 4.1888 * 64e-39 = 268.48e-39 = 2.6848e-37 cm³.

Mass: 39g per mole, 6.02e23 nuclei per mole.

Mass per nucleus: 39g /6.02e23 = approx 6.48e-23 grams.

Convert grams to tons: 6.48e-23 g * (1 ton / 1e6 g) = 6.48e-29 tons.

Density = mass/volume = (6.48e-29) / (2.6848e-37) = (6.48 / 2.6848) * 1e8.

6.48 / 2.6848 is approximately 2.415. So 2.415e8 tons/cm³.

Looking at the options, F is 2.7e8. Hmm, that's a bit higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake?

Let me check the calculations again more precisely.

Volume:

r = 4e-13 cm.

r³ = (4e-13)^3 = 64e-39 cm³.

Multiply by 4/3 π: so 4/3 is 1.3333, times π is about 4.1888. So 4.1888 * 64e-39 = 64 *4.1888 = let's compute 64 *4=256, 64 *0.1888≈12.07, so total≈268.07. So 268.07e-39 cm³ = 2.6807e-37 cm³.

Mass per nucleus: 39g / 6.02e23 = let me compute 39/6.02=6.48 approx.

So 6.48e-23 grams. To tons: 1 ton = 1e6 grams. So 6.48e-23 grams = 6.48e-23 /1e6 = 6.48e-29 tons.

So density is 6.48e-29 tons / 2.6807e-37 cm³.

Which is (6.48 / 2.6807) * 1e8.

Compute 6.48 / 2.6807: 2.6807 *2=5.3614, 6.48-5.3614=1.1186. So 2 + (1.1186/2.6807) ≈ 2 + 0.4175= 2.4175.

So 2.4175e8 tons/cm³.

The options are:

D:5.6e14

E:7.5e6

F:2.7e8

Hmm, 2.4e8 is close to 2.7e8. Maybe my approximations in numbers caused the discrepancy. Let's see if using more precise numbers gets us closer.

Let me use more precise calculations.

Compute 39/6.02: 39 ÷6.02.

6.02 * 6 = 36.12, 36.12+6.02=42.14. 39 is 36.12 + 2.88.

So 6 + (2.88/6.02).

2.88 /6.02 = approx 0.478. So 6.478, which is about 6.48.

So the initial calculation is correct.

But maybe I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, (4e-13)^3 = 64e-39, correct.

Multiply by 4/3 π: 4/3 is 1.333333, π is 3.14159.

1.333333 *3.14159 = approximately 4.18879.

So 4e-13^3 *4.18879 = 64e-39 *4.18879 = 268.07e-39 = 2.6807e-37 cm³.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should be precise with the numbers. Let me compute 4/3 pi r^3 more accurately.

r=4e-13 cm.

r^3=64e-39.

4/3 * π = 4.188790204786... So 4.1887902 * 64e-39 = ?

4.1887902 *64= let's compute that.

4*64=256, 0.1887902 *64= 12.083. So total is 256 +12.083= 268.083. So 268.083e-39 cm³ = 2.68083e-37 cm³.

So volume is 2.68083e-37 cm³.

Mass per nucleus is 39g /6.02e23 = 6.48e-23 grams = 6.48e-29 tons.

So density = 6.48e-29 / 2.68083e-37 = let's compute that.

6.48 / 2.68083 = let's compute accurately.

2.68083 * 2 = 5.36166. 6.48 -5.36166=1.11834.

Now, 1.11834 /2.68083 ≈ 0.4173. So total is 2.4173.

So 2.4173e8 tons/cm³.

Now looking at the options, option F is 2.7e8. Hmm, the calculation gives 2.417e8, which is approximately 2.4e8. So why isn't 2.4e8 an option? Let me look again.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is 2.7e8. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the mass.

Wait, wait another thing: the mass of 39 grams is for 6.02e23 nuclei. So 39 grams is 39 g, which is 0.039 kg, but wait, no, wait, 39 grams is 0.039 kg, but 1 ton is 1000 kg, so 0.039 kg is 3.9e-5 tons. Wait, no, wait: 1 ton is 1000 kg, which is 1e6 grams. So 39 grams is 39e-6 tons.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I messed up the mass conversion.

Let me re-calculate the mass per nucleus in tons.

39 grams = 39e-3 kg = 39e-6 tons (since 1 ton is 1e3 kg, so 1 kg is 1e-3 tons).

Wait, no, 1 ton is 1e3 kg, so 1 kg is 1e-3 tons. So 39 grams is 0.039 kg, which is 0.039e-3 tons, which is 3.9e-5 tons.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 1 kg is 1e3 grams, so 39 grams is 0.039 kg. Then 0.039 kg times (1 ton / 1e3 kg) = 0.039 / 1e3 tons = 3.9e-5 tons. So 39 grams is 3.9e-5 tons. Wait, that's way different than what I did before. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, earlier I thought 1 ton is 1e6 grams, so 1 gram is 1e-6 tons. So 39 grams is 39e-6 tons, which is 3.9e-5 tons. Oh wait, that's correct. So 39 grams = 3.9e-5 tons. Then for 6.02e23 nuclei, mass per nucleus is 3.9e-5 /6.02e23 tons.

So 3.9e-5 /6.02e23 = (3.9/6.02) * 1e-28 = approx 0.648 *1e-28 = 6.48e-29 tons per nucleus. Which matches what I had earlier. So that's correct.

So the calculation seems right, giving 2.4e8 tons/cm³, but option F is 2.7e8. Hmm, maybe I should check the exact value without approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using exact numbers without rounding.

Let me compute 39/(6.02e23) in grams, then convert to tons.

39 grams = 3.9e-5 tons. So per nucleus, mass is 3.9e-5 /6.02e23 = (3.9 /6.02) x 1e-28.

3.9 ÷6.02 is approximately 0.648, so 0.648e-28 = 6.48e-29 tons.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the volume calculation. Let me re-calculate the volume.

r=4e-13 cm.

r cubed is (4e-13)^3 = 64e-39 cm³.

Volume is (4/3) π r^3 = 4.18879 *64e-39 = 4.18879 *64 = ?

4 * 64 = 256.

0.18879 *64 = let's compute: 0.1 *64=6.4, 0.08 *64=5.12, 0.00879 *64≈0.562. So total is 6.4 +5.12=11.52 +0.562=12.082. So total volume is 256 +12.082 =268.082, so 268.082e-39 cm³ =2.68082e-37 cm³.

So volume is 2.68082e-37 cm³.

Density = 6.48e-29 / 2.68082e-37 = (6.48 /2.68082) * 1e8.

6.48 ÷2.68082: Let me compute this more accurately.

2.68082 ×2 =5.36164

Subtract that from 6.48: 6.48 -5.36164=1.11836.

Now, 1.11836 /2.68082 ≈ 0.4173.

So total is 2.4173. So 2.4173e8 tons/cm³.

The closest option is F:2.7e8. Hmm. But my calculation is 2.417e8, which is about 2.4e8. None of the options exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:8.2e-2

B:9.3e-8

C:1.6e-13

D:5.6e14

E:7.5e6

F:2.7e8

G:6.02e23

H:4.3e-5

I:1.0e12

J:3.9e2.

So F is 2.7e8, which is close to 2.4e8. Perhaps I made a slight error in calculations, or perhaps the question expects an approximate value. Let me see if I can get a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute (6.48e-29) / (2.68082e-37) using exponents.

6.48e-29 divided by 2.68082e-37 is equal to (6.48 /2.68082) * 1e8.

Compute 6.48 / 2.68082.

Let me do this division more accurately.

2.68082 × 2 =5.36164.

6.48 -5.36164 =1.11836.

So 2.68082 goes into 1.11836 how many times?

2.68082 * 0.4 =1.072328.

Subtracting from 1.11836: 1.11836 -1.072328=0.046032.

Bring down a zero: 0.46032.

2.68082 * 0.017 = approx 0.045629. So 0.017 would give 0.045629.

Subtract: 0.46032 -0.045629=0.414691.

So so far, we have 2.417.

So 6.48 /2.68082≈2.417.

So 2.417e8.

So 2.417e8 is about 2.4e8.

But the option F is 2.7e8, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Maybe the approximation for pi or the radius is causing this.

Wait, perhaps when I calculated the volume, I should have used more precise numbers.

Wait, let me recompute the volume using more precise numbers.

r=4e-13 cm.

r^3 = (4)^3 * (1e-13)^3 = 64 * 1e-39 = 64e-39 cm³.

Volume = (4/3) * π * 64e-39.

4/3 is 1.333333333.

pi is 3.1415926536.

So 1.333333333 *3.1415926536 = 4.1887902047.

So 4.1887902047 *64e-39 = ?

4.1887902047 *64.

Let me compute that:

4 *64=256.

0.1887902047 *64= 12.082539795.

So total is 256 +12.082539795=268.082539795.

So volume is 268.082539795e-39 cm³ = 2.68082539795e-37 cm³.

So that's precise.

Now, mass is 39g for 6.02e23 nuclei. So 39g = 39e-3 kg = 39e-6 tons.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the mass conversion.

1 ton = 1000 kg.

1 kg = 1000 grams.

So 1 ton = 1e6 grams.

So 39 grams is 39 /1e6 tons = 3.9e-5 tons.

So 39 grams =3.9e-5 tons.

Number of nuclei is 6.02e23.

Mass per nucleus is 3.9e-5 /6.02e23 = (3.9 /6.02) *1e-28.

3.9 /6.02 is approximately 0.648.

So 0.648e-28 =6.48e-29 tons.

So mass per nucleus is 6.48e-29 tons.

So density is 6.48e-29 tons / 2.6808254e-37 cm³.

6.48e-29 /2.6808254e-37 = (6.48 /2.6808254) *
