Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about garden peas. Hmm. The question is about the proportion of constricted-podded progeny when you mate full-podded plants together. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the genes involved are F for full pods and f for constricted. The frequencies are given as p = 0.7 (F) and q = 0.3 (f). So p + q = 1, which makes sense because those are the only two alleles.

Since the population is in genetic equilibrium, that means the Hardy-Weinberg principle applies. Right, so the genotype frequencies can be found using p², 2pq, and q². But wait, the question is about the progeny of full-podded × full-podded matings.

First, I need to figure out the genotype of the full-podded parents. Full pods could be either FF or Ff. So, the frequency of FF in the population is p², which is 0.7 squared. Let me calculate that: 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49. So 49% of the population are FF.

Then, the Ff genotype frequency is 2pq. So 2 * 0.7 * 0.3 is 0.42. Wait, that adds up because 0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09 (which would be q², 0.3 squared for ff) equals 1.

So, when we're looking at the full-podded plants, which include both FF and Ff genotypes, their proportion is p² + 2pq. Wait, but actually, in the question, it's about the mating of full-podded plants. So, each parent is either FF or Ff.

But in a population in equilibrium, the distribution of genotypes among the full-podded individuals would be different. Wait, no, because when you're selecting for full-podded plants, you're taking all FF and Ff individuals. So the frequency of FF among full-podded plants is (p²) / (p² + 2pq). Similarly for Ff.

Let me compute that. So, the proportion of FF in the full-podded group is 0.49/(0.49 + 0.42) = 0.49 / 0.91. Let me calculate that: 0.49 divided by 0.91 is approximately 0.538. So about 53.8% of the full-podded plants are FF, and the rest are Ff, which would be 1 - 0.538 ≈ 0.462, or 46.2%.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to consider that when you cross two full-podded plants, each parent can produce either F or f gametes. So the possible gametes from each parent are F and f, but the proportion depends on their genotype.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the average probability that a full-podded parent will pass on an f allele. Because if both parents are full-podded, their possible genotypes are either FF or Ff. 

So let's think about each plant's possible genotype. If a plant is FF (homozygous), it can only contribute F gametes. If it's Ff (heterozygous), it can contribute F or f, each with 50% chance.

So the frequency of FF plants among full-podded is p² / (p² + 2pq) = 0.49 / 0.91 ≈ 0.538 as before. And Ff is 0.42 / 0.91 ≈ 0.462.

Now, the probability that a parent will contribute an f allele is only possible if the parent is Ff. So the chance that a parent is Ff is 0.462, and each Ff parent has a 50% chance of passing f. So the overall frequency of f gametes from the parents is 0.462 * 0.5 = 0.231.

So each parent contributes an f allele with probability 0.231. Since the two parents are independent, the chance that both contribute f is (0.231)^2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because each parent contributes an f with probability 0.231, the chance that both are f is (0.231)^2? Or wait, no, because when you're looking for the child to be ff (constricted), you need both parents to contribute f.

Wait, no, no. Let me clarify. The probability that each parent gives an f gamete is 0.231, as calculated. So the probability that both parents give f is 0.231 * 0.231. Let me compute that: 0.231 * 0.231 = approximately 0.053. So about 5.3% chance.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake. The initial calculation is correct, but perhaps there's an alternative approach. Let's model it using the possible crosses.

Wait, another approach: when you cross two full-podded plants, which are either FF or Ff, the possible matings can be:

1. FF × FF: All offspring are FF → no constricted.

2. FF × Ff: Each parent contributes F and F/f. Wait, no. Let me think in terms of gametes. FF can only give F, Ff gives F or f. So the possible offspring from FF × Ff would be FF (from F + F) or Ff (from F + f). So no ff offspring.

3. Ff × Ff: The possible offspring are FF, Ff, Ff, ff. So 25% ff.

4. Ff × FF: Similar to case 2, so no ff.

But wait, the parents are randomly mating, but I think we're considering a population where all full-podded are being mated together. So the actual distribution of their matings is based on the genotype frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the expected frequency of ff in the offspring.

So, the proportion of the parents that are FF is 0.538, and Ff is 0.462.

So, when two parents mate, the possible combinations are:

- FF × FF: Probability is (0.538)^2. The offspring are all FF. So no ff here.

- FF × Ff: Probability is 2 * 0.538 * 0.462. Because each parent can be FF or Ff, so it's twice the product. The offspring will be FF and Ff, no ff.

- Ff × Ff: Probability is (0.462)^2. The offspring from Ff × Ff are 25% ff.

So the overall probability of ff is (probability of Ff × Ff) multiplied by 0.25.

So that's (0.462)^2 * 0.25. Let me compute that.

0.462 squared is approximately 0.213. Multiply by 0.25 gives 0.0533. So about 5.33%.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.0532, which is close. Option C is 0.09, which is higher. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but I think I might have taken a wrong approach earlier. Let me see if there's a simpler way.

Alternative approach: The parents are both full-podded, so their genotypes can be FF or Ff. The proportion of each is as calculated: ~53.8% FF and ~46.2% Ff.

Each parent can pass on an F or f allele. The chance that a parent is Ff is 0.462, and each Ff has a 50% chance to pass f.

So the chance that a single parent contributes f is 0.462 * 0.5 = 0.231.

Since both parents are contributing, the chance that both pass f is (0.231)^2 = 0.0533, which is about 5.33% as before.

So the proportion of constricted-podded (ff) progeny is 0.0533, which matches option G: 0.0532.

So the answer should be G.

To determine the proportion of constricted-podded progeny resulting from matings of full-podded × full-podded garden peas, we start by noting the allele frequencies: \( p = 0.7 \) (frequency of \( F \)) and \( q = 0.3 \) (frequency of \( f \)). The population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, so genotype frequencies are given by \( p^2 \), \( 2pq \), and \( q^2 \).

1. **Genotype Frequencies in the Population**:  
   - \( FF \) (homozygous full-podded): \( p^2 = 0.7^2 = 0.49 \)  
   - \( Ff \) (heterozygous full-podded): \( 2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42 \)  
   - \( ff \) (constricted-podded): \( q^2 = 0.3^2 = 0.09 \)  

   Since only full-podded plants (\( FF \) and \( Ff \)) are being mated, their combined frequency is \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.49 + 0.42 = 0.91 \).  

2. **Proportions of \( FF \) and \( Ff \) Among Full-Podded Plants**:  
   - Proportion of \( FF \): \( \frac{p^2}{p^2 + 2pq} = \frac{0.49}{0.91} \approx 0.538 \)  
   - Proportion of \( Ff \): \( \frac{2pq}{p^2 + 2pq} = \frac{0.42}{0.91} \approx 0.462 \)  

3. **Probability of Passing the \( f \) Allele**:  
   - \( FF \) plants can only pass the \( F \) allele.  
   - \( Ff \) plants have a 50% chance of passing the \( f \) allele.  
   Thus, the probability that a full-podded plant passes the \( f \) allele is:  
   \[
   (0.462)(0.5) = 0.231
   \]  

4. **Probability of \( ff \) Offspring**:  
   For a progeny to be \( ff \) (constricted-podded), both parents must pass the \( f \) allele. Since the parents are independent, the probability is:  
   \[
   (0.231)^2 = 0.0533
   \]  

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The proportion of constricted-podded progeny is approximately \( 0.0533 \), which corresponds to option \( G \) (\( 0.0532 \)).
