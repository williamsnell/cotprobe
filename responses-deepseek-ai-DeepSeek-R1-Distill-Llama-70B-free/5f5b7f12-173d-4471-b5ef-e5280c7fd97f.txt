Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about rings and fields. Hmm, let me think about what each statement is saying.

Statement 1 says, "Every field is also a ring." I remember from my algebra class that rings and fields are both algebraic structures. A ring has two operations: addition and multiplication. Rings must satisfy certain axioms like associativity, distributivity, etc., but they don't require every element to have a multiplicative inverse. Fields, on the other hand, are rings where every non-zero element does have a multiplicative inverse, and they also must have commutative multiplication with an identity element.

Wait, so a field meets all the requirements of a ring and then some. So yes, every field is a ring because it satisfies all the ring axioms. So statement 1 must be true.

Now, statement 2 says, "Every ring has a multiplicative identity." Hmm, I think there's a nuance here. I remember that some rings don't necessarily have a multiplicative identity, which is often denoted as 1. Oh wait, no, wait—rings by definition usually have a multiplicative identity. Or is that only for rings with unity?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. In some definitions, a ring must have a multiplicative identity. In other definitions, a ring without a multiplicative identity is called a "rng" (a ring without an identity). So it depends on how the term is defined in the context of the question.

Wait, but in standard terminology, I think a ring typically includes having a multiplicative identity. Oh wait, no. Wait, no—actually, in many algebra courses, rings do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. A ring is a set with two operations satisfying certain properties. Some sources define rings to include a multiplicative identity, others do not. So if a ring has a multiplicative identity, it's sometimes called a ring with unity or a unital ring.

So if the question is using the definition where rings must have a multiplicative identity, then statement 2 is true. But if rings don't necessarily have one, then statement 2 is false.

Wait, but in the context of this question, what's the assumed definition? Because statement 1 is about fields being rings. Fields definitely have a multiplicative identity because they're rings where every element has an inverse, so obviously they have 1.

So if the definition of a ring doesn't require a multiplicative identity, then statement 2 would be false. For example, the set of even integers is a ring under addition and multiplication, but it doesn't have a multiplicative identity because 1 isn't in the set.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question's definition of a ring includes a multiplicative identity. If the question uses a definition where rings have 1, then statement 2 would be true. But if it's using a definition where rings don't necessarily have 1, then statement 2 would be false.

Wait, but the question is about whether every ring has a multiplicative identity. So if the definition of a ring requires it, then yes. If not, then no.

I think in this context, the standard definition used is that a ring doesn't necessarily have a multiplicative identity. So statement 2 would be false. Because there are rings without 1.

But wait, let me think again. I'm a bit shaky here. So in some textbooks, rings have 1, and in others, they don't. So the answer might vary based on that.

Wait, but in the context of the first statement, since a field has 1, then statement 1 is true. So back to statement 2. If every ring has a multiplicative identity, then statement 2 is true. But if rings can lack it, then statement 2 is false.

Wait, perhaps the answer hinges on that. So, if statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is false, then the correct option would be A: True, False.

Alternatively, if statement 2 is true, then both would be true, which would be option B.

Wait, but I think in the standard definition taught in many places, rings do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity. So statement 2 is false. Therefore, statement 1 is true, statement 2 is false. So the correct option would be A: True, False.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way: a field is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has an inverse. So if a ring is defined without requiring 1, then a field is a ring with additional properties. So statement 1 holds.

But if the ring is defined to require 1, then statement 2 is true.

I think the confusion here is because of varying definitions. But perhaps in the context of this question, the definition of a ring does not require a multiplicative identity. Therefore, statement 2 is false.

So the answer would be A: True, False.

Statement 1: "Every field is also a ring." This is true because a field satisfies all the axioms of a ring and adds additional properties such as the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. Therefore, every field is indeed a ring.

Statement 2: "Every ring has a multiplicative identity." This depends on the definition of a ring. In some definitions, a ring is required to have a multiplicative identity (often referred to as a "ring with unity"), while in other definitions, a ring does not necessarily have one (sometimes called a "rng"). Since the question does not specify, we must rely on the standard definition where rings do not necessarily have a multiplicative identity. For example, the set of even integers forms a ring under addition and multiplication but lacks a multiplicative identity. Thus, statement 2 is false.

Given that statement 1 is true and statement 2 is false, the correct answer is:

A: True, False

Answer: A
