Question:

A supplier of ink for printers sent the following letter to all of its customers:"Closeout special! We have decided to no longer stock green ink cartridges. We have on hand a limited supply of green ink cartridges for all printers; when they're gone, they're gone! Please submit your orders as soon as possible to make sure your order can be filled. "One of the regular customers of the supplier sent the following reply by fax:"Sorry to hear that you will no longer carry green ink cartridges, since that is one of our favorite colors. Please ship 100 green ink cartridges to our office as soon as possible. "The supplier faxed an acknowledgement of the order to the customer with a promise that the cartridges would be shipped out in one week. The next day, the supplier received the following e-mail from the customer:"Please cancel our order. We just discovered that we already have plenty of green ink cartridges in inventory. " The supplier proceeded to sell its entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price to other customers. In an action for breach of contract by the supplier against the customer, what is the maximum amount of damages that the supplier should be entitled to recover?

Options:

A: Consequential damages, since the green ink cartridges were unique because they were the last of their kind to be offered for sale by the supplier.
B: The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the potential sale to other customers.
C: $10,000, which is double the asking price of the cartridges, as a penalty for the customer's late cancellation.
D: Only incidental damages, if any, that the supplier has incurred in preparing the green ink cartridges for shipment to the customer before receiving the customer's e-mail.
E: The cost of the ink cartridges plus the cost of shipping, as the supplier had already promised to ship them out.
F: $5,000, which was the asking price for the 100 green ink cartridges ordered.
G: The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the sale to other customers, since the supplier had to sell the cartridges at a lower price.
H: The full cost of the cartridges plus any additional costs incurred in the sale to other customers.
I: Nothing.
J: Any additional costs incurred by the supplier in obtaining replacement cartridges to fulfill the customer's order.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario involves a supplier of printer ink and one of their regular customers. The supplier sent out a letter saying they're discontinuing green ink cartridges and have a limited stock left. They urged customers to order quickly. The customer replied, ordering 100 cartridges, and the supplier acknowledged the order, promising to ship in a week. But the next day, the customer emailed to cancel the order because they found they already had enough stock. The supplier then sold all their green cartridges to other customers. Now, the supplier is suing the customer for breach of contract, and we're supposed to determine the maximum damages the supplier can recover.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to figure out if a contract was formed between the supplier and the customer. The supplier sent out what's called a closeout special, which sounds like an offer. The customer sent a fax reply ordering 100 cartridges—that should be an acceptance. So yes, a contract was formed when the customer accepted the offer.

Now, the customer tried to cancel the order the next day. But under contract law, once a contract is formed, both parties are bound unless they agree to terminate it or if there's a legal basis for termination. So the question is whether the customer's cancellation was valid. If not, then the customer breached the contract by cancelling.

Wait, but wait—there's something about the time of cancellation. The supplier had already acknowledged the order, which usually means they accepted it. So the contract was formed upon the supplier's acknowledgment. Then the customer tried to revoke their order the next day. But under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies here because it's a sale of goods, the general rule is that once a contract is formed, the buyer can't revoke acceptance unless the seller agrees or certain conditions are met, like if the seller hasn't started performance yet.

In this case, the supplier had already promised to ship in a week, but the customer canceled the next day. The supplier might not have started shipping yet, but they might have started preparing the order. The UCC allows for revocation under certain circumstances, but I think it's more about whether the seller has substantially started performance. But wait, the UCC also has rules about when an order becomes irrevocable. Under UCC §2-206, an order is irrevocable if it's for goods not to be received within 10 days and the supplier has made either a substantial beginning of their performance or commitments for their performance. So in this case, the supplier promised to ship in one week, which is 7 days. So the 10-day rule wouldn't apply here because 7 is less than 10. Does that mean the customer could revoke without liability?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Under UCC §2-206(1)(b), an order is irrevocable if the goods are to be received within 10 days. If the order is for goods to be received beyond 10 days, the order is revocable unless the seller has started performance. Here, the supplier said shipment would be in one week, so the goods would be received within 10 days. Wait, no—shipment in one week means the goods would be sent in 7 days. So the delivery time is under 10 days. So under UCC 2-206(1)(b), the order is irrevocable if the goods are to be received within 10 days. So the customer's attempt to revoke the next day might be ineffective because the order is irrevocable under this rule. So the customer's cancellation would be a breach.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: UCC 2-206(1) says that an order is irrevocable in two cases: (a) if the supplier has made a substantial beginning of performance, or (b) if the goods are not to be received within 10 days and the supplier has made commitments for their performance. So in this case, the goods are to be received in a week, which is less than 10 days. Therefore, under (1)(b), the order is irrevocable because it's within 10 days, and I think the supplier has made a commitment by acknowledging the order. So the customer's cancellation would be a breach.

So the supplier can sue for damages. Now, the question is about the measure of damages. Under UCC 2-708, when a buyer breaches, the seller can recover damages under 2-708(1) or 2-708(2). The difference is that 2-708(1) allows for the contract price minus the market price, but that's more when the seller hasn't resold the goods. Alternatively, 2-708(2) is for lost volume sellers, which allows recovery of lost profit if the seller could have sold both the contract goods and the resale goods.

Wait, the supplier here sold all the stock to other customers, so they didn't lose any sales. They resold all the cartridges. So they're a lost volume seller? Let me think. A lost volume seller is someone who would have made an additional sale even if the original buyer had not breached. Here, the supplier had a limited stock, and they sold all of them. So when the customer canceled, the supplier sold those 100 cartridges to someone else. But wait, the supplier sold the entire stock, which included the 100 cartridges. So the question is whether the supplier could have sold those 100 to both the customer and another buyer, but that's impossible because the stock is limited.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The supplier had a limited stock. They received an order for 100, then the customer canceled, and then the supplier sold all the stock to other customers. So if the customer had not canceled, the supplier would have sold 100 to them and possibly the rest to others. But since the customer canceled, the supplier sold those 100 to others. So the supplier didn't lose any profit because they were able to sell all the cartridges. Therefore, the supplier is not a lost volume seller because they didn't lose a sale; they just sold the same cartridges to someone else.

Wait, but wait, under UCC 2-708(2), a seller can recover lost profits if they can demonstrate that they could have supplied both the breaching buyer and the resale buyer. But in this case, the supplier only had a limited stock. So if the customer had not canceled, the supplier would have sold 100 to the customer and the rest to others. But since the customer canceled, the supplier sold those 100 to others, meaning they didn't lose any profit—they just shifted the sale. So the supplier's profit remains the same; they didn't lose any volume. Therefore, 2-708(2) wouldn't apply because there's no lost volume.

So then, the damages would be under 2-708(1), which is the difference between the contract price and the market price. But wait, the supplier resold the goods at the same price, so the market price is the same as the contract price. Therefore, the supplier's damages would be zero because they didn't suffer any loss.

Wait, but let me think again. The customer's cancellation allowed the supplier to sell those 100 cartridges to someone else at the same price. So the supplier didn't lose any profit. Therefore, the supplier's damages are zero. They can't recover anything because they weren't harmed.

Looking at the options:

Option I says "Nothing." That would be the case if the supplier couldn't recover any damages because they didn't suffer a loss.

Option F says $5,000, the asking price. But that doesn't make sense because the supplier didn't lose money; they sold the cartridges elsewhere.

Option A talks about consequential damages because the cartridges were unique. But they weren't unique; the supplier had a stock and sold them all, so no uniqueness.

Option B says the cost plus loss in profit. But no loss in profit because they sold them.

Option D talks about incidental damages, but I don't think the supplier incurred any costs in preparing the shipment because they just had to ship to others instead.

Option I seems correct because the supplier didn't suffer any loss. They sold the cartridges to other customers at the same price, so they didn't lose any profit.

The scenario involves a supplier of printer ink and a customer who entered into a contract for 100 green ink cartridges. The customer attempted to cancel the order the next day, but under UCC §2-206(1)(b), the order was irrevocable because the goods were to be received within 10 days and the supplier had acknowledged the order. Therefore, the customer's cancellation constituted a breach of contract.

Under UCC §2-708, the supplier could potentially recover damages for the breach. However, the supplier sold the entire stock of green ink cartridges to other customers at the same price, meaning they did not suffer any loss in profit or harm. The supplier was not a lost volume seller because they did not lose an additional sale; they simply shifted the sale to another customer. As a result, the supplier's damages are zero.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The cartridges were not unique, as the supplier had a stock and sold them all.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The supplier did not incur any loss in profit.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no basis for a penalty.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The supplier did not incur incidental damages.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The supplier did not suffer any loss related to the cost of cartridges or shipping.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The supplier did not lose the asking price since they resold the cartridges.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. There was no lower price in the resale.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The supplier did not incur additional costs.
- **Option I**: Correct. The supplier did not suffer any damages.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The supplier did not need replacement cartridges.

The correct answer is **I: Nothing**, as the supplier did not suffer any loss or harm due to the customer's breach.
