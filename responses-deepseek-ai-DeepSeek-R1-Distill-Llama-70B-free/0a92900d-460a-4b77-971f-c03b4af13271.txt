Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about objectives. The question is asking which option should an objective NOT be. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when setting objectives, especially in things like project management or goal setting, there's a common acronym used, maybe SMART? I think it stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Oh wait, sometimes it's SMART with each letter standing for a criterion.

Let me list out what each of those letters mean. Specific means the objective is clear and well-defined. Measurable means you can track progress and know when it's achieved. Achievable is about being realistic and attainable. Relevant ensures the goal is meaningful and aligns with broader objectives. Time-bound means there's a specific deadline or timeframe.

Looking at the options given:

A: Achievable – that's part of SMART, so it's a good thing.
B: Specific – also part of SMART, so that's okay.
C: Broad – wait, isn't that the opposite of specific? If an objective is broad, it's too general and not focused. That might not be good because it's not specific.
D: Measurable – yes, that's part of SMART.
E: Relevant – part of SMART, so good.
F: Realistic – hmm, sometimes this is part of the achievable or maybe another acronym. But I think it's similar to achievable, so it's a good trait.
G: Detailed – maybe it's good to have details, but sometimes too much detail can make the objective too rigid or complicated. But I'm not sure if this is a bad thing per se. Wait, no, an objective should be clear but maybe not overly detailed. Or perhaps it's about not being too vague, so detailed might be positive. Or maybe it's not part of the essential criteria, so it could be a trick option.
H: Time-bound – that's the T in SMART, so definitely a good thing.
I: Ambiguous – this means unclear or open to multiple interpretations. That's bad because the objective should be specific and clear. So an objective should NOT be ambiguous.

Wait, the question is which should an objective NOT be. So looking at the options, the ones that are not part of the positive traits are C: Broad and I: Ambiguous.

Wait, Broad is the opposite of specific. So an objective should be specific, not broad. So an objective should not be broad, right? Because being broad makes it too general and not focused. So option C is something an objective should not be.

But wait, let me think again. The question is which should an objective NOT be. So which of these is a bad characteristic. So looking at all the options, the ones that are negative traits are C: Broad and I: Ambiguous.

In the SMART criteria, the opposite of specific is broad. So an objective should not be broad because it should be specific. Similarly, ambiguous is bad because it's unclear. So both C and I are negative, but the options only allow one correct answer.

Wait, the options are A to I, each as possible answers. The question is which should an objective NOT be. So which of these is a bad characteristic.

In the SMART criteria, the desired traits are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. So the opposites would be bad. So Broad (opposite of specific) is bad, and Ambiguous (opposite of specific, or maybe clear) is also bad.

Looking at the options, the question is which one should an objective NOT be. So which of these is a bad trait.

So the options given are:

C: Broad
I: Ambiguous

So the question is which one is a bad characteristic, so an objective should not be broad or ambiguous.

Looking back at the options, the question is which should an objective NOT be. So which of these is something that's not desirable.

So I think both C and I are bad, but the options only have one correct answer. Let's check the question again.

The options are A to I, each being a single word. The question is which should an objective NOT be.

I think the answer is either C or I. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, is Broad a bad thing? Or can an objective be broad as long as it's still clear? Hmm, no, in the SMART criteria, it's supposed to be specific, so being too broad would make it not specific. So an objective should not be broad.

Similarly, being ambiguous is definitely bad because it's unclear.

So both C and I are bad, but the options only allow one correct answer. Wait, the options are:

A: Achievable
B: Specific
C: Broad
D: Measurable
E: Relevant
F: Realistic
G: Detailed
H: Time-bound
I: Ambiguous

The question is which one should an objective NOT be. So the correct answer would be either C or I.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I: Ambiguous because being ambiguous is worse. Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for which of these is NOT a characteristic that objectives should have. So in the options, the correct answer is the one that's not a desired trait.

Looking at the options, the desired traits are A, B, D, E, F, G, H. So the undesired are C and I.

But the question is which should an objective NOT be, so the answer would be either C or I.

Wait, maybe the answer is I: Ambiguous, because an objective should be clear and unambiguous. So I is definitely a bad trait.

But I'm a bit confused because the question is asking which should an objective NOT be, so which is a bad characteristic. So both C and I are bad, but the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the answer is C: Broad, because being too broad makes the objective not specific. Alternatively, maybe the answer is I: Ambiguous because it's unclear.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. I think the correct answer is I: Ambiguous, because ambiguity is the opposite of being clear and specific, which is crucial for objectives. So an objective should not be ambiguous.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is C: Broad, since objectives should be specific, not broad.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the question. It's a multiple-choice question with options A to I. The correct answer is the one that is not a desired trait.

In the SMART criteria, the desired traits are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. So any trait that is the opposite of these would be bad.

Broad is the opposite of specific, so that's bad. Ambiguous is also bad, perhaps more so because it's unclear. But the options include both C and I. So which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is phrased as "which should an objective NOT be?" So it's looking for the negative trait. So both C and I are negative. But in the options provided, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I: Ambiguous. Because an objective must be clear and specific, so being ambiguous is bad. But in the options, both C and I are bad.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is C: Broad. Because an objective should be specific, not broad. So the answer is C.

Alternatively, another approach: the question is about which should an objective NOT be. So looking at the options, the ones that are good are A, B, D, E, F, G, H. The bad ones are C and I.

But the options are multiple-choice, so only one option is correct. The question is which one is the answer.

Wait, perhaps I should look up what the typical characteristics of objectives are. Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound. So an objective should not be broad because it's too vague. It should also not be ambiguous because it's unclear.

So in the options, both C and I are incorrect. But the question only allows one answer, so perhaps the intended answer is I: Ambiguous, because being ambiguous is a worse trait than being broad.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Broad, because being too broad doesn't meet the specific criteria.

I'm a bit torn. But I think the answer is I: Ambiguous, because ambiguity is more about clarity, which is crucial. So I would choose I.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think again. Another approach: the question is which should an objective NOT be. So the answer is the opposite of what's desired. So for example, if an objective should be specific, then it should not be broad. If it should be clear, it should not be ambiguous.

So both C and I are opposites of desired traits. But the options only have one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is I: Ambiguous, because it's more directly related to being unclear, which is a fundamental issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C: Broad, because it's the opposite of specific. So the answer would be C.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of examples. A broad objective might be "Improve sales," which is too vague. A specific one would be "Increase sales by 10% in the next quarter." So being broad is bad, so an objective should not be broad. So C is a bad trait.

Similarly, an ambiguous objective would be something like "Enhance customer satisfaction," which could mean different things to different people. So that's bad too.

But the question is which should an objective NOT be. So the correct answer is either C or I. 

Since the options are A to I, and the question asks for which should an objective NOT be, I think the intended answer is I: Ambiguous, because ambiguity is a clearer negative trait. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, in the SMART criteria, the S stands for Specific, which is the opposite of broad. So an objective should not be broad. Therefore, the answer is C.

Alternatively, I think that in the context of the question, the answer is I: Ambiguous, because being ambiguous is worse than being broad. But I'm not certain.

I think I'll go with I: Ambiguous as the answer, but I'm not entirely confident. Wait, perhaps the answer is C: Broad, because being specific is a key trait, and broad is the opposite. So the answer is C.

The question asks which characteristic an objective should NOT have. Objectives, particularly in frameworks like SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound), should be clear, focused, and well-defined. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Achievable** – This is a positive trait as it ensures the objective is realistic and attainable.
- **B: Specific** – A key characteristic of good objectives, ensuring clarity and focus.
- **C: Broad** – This is a negative trait because broad objectives are too general and lack focus, violating the specificity required in SMART criteria.
- **D: Measurable** – A positive trait, allowing progress tracking and clear success criteria.
- **E: Relevant** – Ensures the objective aligns with broader goals, making it meaningful.
- **F: Realistic** – Similar to achievable, it ensures the objective is practical and within reach.
- **G: Detailed** – While some detail is helpful, excessive detail can be counterproductive, but it is not inherently a negative trait.
- **H: Time-bound** – A positive trait, providing a clear deadline or timeframe.
- **I: Ambiguous** – A negative trait because ambiguity makes the objective unclear and open to multiple interpretations, which is undesirable.

Between **C: Broad** and **I: Ambiguous**, both are negative traits. However, **Broad** is the direct opposite of **Specific**, a core SMART criterion, making it the most fitting answer to the question.
