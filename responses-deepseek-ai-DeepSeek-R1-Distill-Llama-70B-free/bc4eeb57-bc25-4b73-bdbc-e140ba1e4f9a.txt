Okay, so I've got this history question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the earliest kingdoms in South America and when they reached their height. The options are A through J, but each option has a different civilization and date. 

Hmm, I remember that the Incas are a big name in South America, but were they the earliest? Wait, I think the Incas came later, like around the 15th century or something. So maybe they're not the earliest. Then there's the Olmec civilization—I've heard they were one of the earliest in Mesoamerica, which is more in Central America, but I'm not sure if that's South America. Oh wait, the question is about South America. So maybe the Olmec isn't the right answer here.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C is Olmec with AD 100. That's early, but again, I'm not sure if they were in South America. I think Olmec was in what's now Mexico, which is North America, so probably not the answer for South America.

Chavin is another option. I recall that Chavin was a culture in the Andean region of South America. I think their time was around 900 to 200 BCE, but wait, that's before the Common Era. So if the option says AD 600, that's much later. So maybe F is Chavin at AD 600, but that doesn't seem right because I thought they were earlier.

The Moche civilization, option B, says AD 400. Moche was in Peru, I believe, and flourished from about 100 to 700 AD. So their height would be around AD 400, which fits option B. That sounds plausible.

Then there's the Wari, option G, with AD 100. Wait, Wari was a later civilization, more like around 600 to 1000 AD, I think. So AD 100 would be too early for them.

Looking at the other options: the Maya (option D) were in Mesoamerica, so more in Central America, not South. Toltecs (option I) were also in Mesoamerica, around Mexico. Aztecs (option H) came even later, around 14th century.

Zapotec (option E) is another Mesoamerican culture, I think, so probably not the answer here.

So putting it together, the earliest kingdoms in South America—Chavin might have been one of the first, but the time frame in the options doesn't match. Moche, on the other hand, was in South America (Peru) and their peak was around AD 400, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thought. I'm a bit confused about the earliest. Was there another civilization before Moche? Like maybe the Norte Chico civilization? Oh, but I don't think any of the options include that. Norte Chico is considered one of the earliest in South America, around 3200–1800 BCE, but none of the options go that far back. So among the given options, Moche seems to fit.

So the answer should be Moche at AD 400, which is option B.

The earliest kingdoms in South America include the Moche civilization, which flourished in Peru. Among the options provided, the Moche civilization, reaching its height around AD 400, fits as the correct answer.

Answer: B
