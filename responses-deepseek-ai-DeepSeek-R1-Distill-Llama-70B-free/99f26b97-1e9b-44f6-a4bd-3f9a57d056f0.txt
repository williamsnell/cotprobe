Okay, so I have this question asking which city is known as the 'rubber capital of the world.' Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that the rubber industry is tied to tires and automotive stuff. I think about big companies like Goodyear and Firestone. Where are they based? I'm pretty sure Goodyear is from Akron, Ohio. Firestone might be there too, or maybe another Ohio city.

Wait, the options include Akron Ohio as option B. Also, Toledo Ohio is option A. I'm a bit confused because Toledo is known for something else, maybe glass or something. Oh right, Toledo is famous for its glass industry, like Owens-Illinois or Owens Corning. So probably not Toledo.

Then there's Detroit, which is known as the Motor City because of the automotive industry. But rubber capital? Maybe, but I think it's more about cars than just the parts like tires. Detroit is option C.

Akron, on the other hand, was a big hub for tire manufacturing. I think I've heard that Akron was the rubber capital. So that would make B the correct answer.

Let me double-check. Other options: Columbus is the capital of Ohio, but not related to rubber. Cleveland might have some industry, but I don't recall it being the rubber capital. Grand Rapids is in Michigan and I'm not sure about its industries. Pittsburgh is known for steel. Dayton has some history with inventions, maybe, but not rubber specifically. Rockford Illinois and Omaha Nebraska don't ring a bell for rubber.

So I'm pretty confident it's Akron, Ohio. So the answer should be B.
