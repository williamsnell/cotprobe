Okay, so I've got this problem about specific rotation, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what I remember from my notes.

The question says that there's a solution with 6.15 grams of cholesterol per 100 ml. Then, when some of this solution is put into a 5 cm polarimeter tube, the observed rotation is -1.2 degrees. I need to find the specific rotation of cholesterol.

Wait, specific rotation, right. I think specific rotation is a property of a compound, measured under certain conditions. The formula, I recall, is [α] = (observed rotation) / (concentration × path length). Oh wait, wait, but the concentration here is in grams per ml, but I think the formula uses it in grams per 100 ml, which is like a percentage or something. Or wait, no—maybe it's grams per deciliter? Hmm.

Wait, let me get this straight. The specific rotation formula is [α] = (α) / (c × l), where α is the observed rotation, c is the concentration in grams per 100 ml, and l is the path length in decimeters. Oh wait, because 1 dm is 10 cm. So if the tube is 5 cm, that's 0.5 dm.

So in this problem, the concentration is 6.15 grams per 100 ml, which is exactly what we need for c. The path length l is 5 cm, which is 0.5 dm. The observed rotation is -1.2 degrees.

Putting it into the formula: [α] = (-1.2) / (6.15 * 0.5). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 6.15 multiplied by 0.5 is 3.075. Then divide -1.2 by 3.075. Let me compute that. So 1.2 divided by 3.075. Let me see, 3.075 times 0.4 is 1.23, which is a bit more than 1.2. So maybe approximately 0.39... but wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 3.075 divided into 1.2. Hmm. 3.075 × 0.39 = let's see. 3.075 * 0.3 is 0.9225, 3.075 * 0.09 is 0.27675. So 0.9225 + 0.27675 is 1.19925. Oh, that's really close to 1.2. So 0.39 would give approximately 1.19925, which is almost 1.2. So the division is approximately 0.39, but since the observed rotation is negative, it's -0.39. Wait, but the options don't have a -0.39. Let me check the options again.

Options are A: -1.2, B: -0.5, C: -6.15, D: -39.02. Hmm, none of these are -0.39. So maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, specific rotation is observed rotation divided by (concentration in g/100ml × path length in dm). So the denominator is c * l. So in this case, c is 6.15 g/100ml, l is 0.5 dm.

So [α] = (-1.2) / (6.15 * 0.5) = (-1.2) / 3.075. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 1.2 divided by 3 is 0.4. But 3.075 is a bit more than 3. So 1.2 /3.075 is a bit less than 0.4. Let me compute it properly.

Let me write it as 120 / 30.75 (since I multiplied numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals). 120 ÷30.75 = let's see. 30.75 × 3 is 92.25, 30.75 × 3.9 is 30.75 *3=92.25, 30.75 *0.9=27.675; 92.25 +27.675= 119.925. Oh, that's really close to 120. So 3.9 times 30.75 is 119.925, which is just 0.075 less than 120. So 3.9 + (0.075/30.75) → 0.075/30.75 is approximately 0.0024378. So approximately 3.9024. So 120/30.75 ≈3.9024, but wait wait, no. Wait, no, the initial calculation is 1.2 divided by 3.075. Which is (1.2 *100)/(3.075 *100) )=120 /307.5. Wait, 307.5 × 0.39 is 119.925, which is very close to 120. So 120/307.5=0.39016 approximately.

So [α] ≈ -0.390 degrees. But none of the options are near -0.39. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me recheck.

Concentration: 6.15 g per 100 ml. So that's correct for c. Path length is 5 cm, which is 0.5 dm. So l is correct.

Wait, another thought: maybe the specific rotation is expressed in a different unit, like [α]^20_D or something, but the question doesn't mention temperature, so I think that's okay.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is -39.02, which is a much larger number. Did I maybe miss a decimal point in the calculation?

Wait, 1.2 divided by (6.15 *0.5) = 1.2 /3.075 = 0.39016. So approximately -0.39. But that's not an option. So perhaps I flipped something. Wait, maybe the formula uses concentration in grams per liter? No, I thought it's grams per 100ml.

Wait wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The formula for specific rotation is [α] = α / (c × l), where c is in grams per 100 ml, and l is in dm.

So in this case, c =6.15 g/100 ml, l=5 cm=0.5 dm. So denominator is 6.15 *0.5=3.075. So [α]= (-1.2)/3.075= -0.39016.

Hmm. But none of the options are -0.39. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the concentration is given as 6.15 g per 100 ml, which is 61.5 g per liter. But no, the formula uses g per 100 ml, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Maybe it's (α × 100) / (c × l). No, that can't be right because the units wouldn't make sense. Let me double-check the formula from my notes.

Wait, according to my notes, specific rotation is [α] = (observed rotation in degrees) / (concentration in g/100ml × path length in dm). So my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for something else. Maybe the calculation is correct, but I'm looking at the wrong option. Let me re-calculate the numbers.

Compute 1.2 divided by 3.075:

3.075 × 0.39 =1.19925, as I did before. So 1.2 /3.075=0.39016. So approximately 0.390. So [α] is -0.390 degrees. So about -0.39, which isn't an option.

Looking at the options, option B is -0.5, which is bigger in magnitude. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1.2 /3.075 again.

3.075 × 0.4 =1.23, which is higher than 1.2. So 0.4 would be 1.23, but we have 1.2. So the value is a bit less than 0.4. Let's compute 1.2 /3.075.

Let me compute this division accurately.

3.075 | 1.200

3.075 goes into 12.00 zero times. So 0.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 120 ÷3075.

Wait, 3075 × 0.039 is 119.925, as before. So 120/3075=0.039016 approximately.

Wait, wait, no. Wait 3075 × 0.039 is 119.925. So 3075 × 0.039016 = 120.

Wait, so 120/3075 is 0.039016... which is approximately 0.0390.

Wait, but wait. No, that's not right. Because 3075 is 3075/100 =30.75. So 120/30.75 is 3.902.

Wait, wait a minute, I'm getting confused. Oh wait no, I have 1.2 divided by 3.075.

Wait, 1.2 /3.075 = (120/100) / (3075/1000) )= (120 *1000 ) / (100 *3075 )=120000 / 307500. Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 150: 120000 ÷150=800, 307500 ÷150=2050. So 800/2050 = 16/41 ≈0.3902.

Wait, so [α]= -0.390. So approximately -0.39. But the options don't have that. So what's going on?

Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, the specific rotation formula—does it use grams per solution's volume, like in 100ml? Or is it something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses concentration in grams per liter? Let me think. No, I think it's grams per 100 ml. Because in my notes, the c is in g/100ml. So 6.15 g per 100 ml is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted grams to another unit. Wait, but specific rotation is per gram, so units shouldn't matter beyond that.

Wait, another thought: maybe I'm using the wrong value for path length. The tube is 5 cm, which is 0.5 dm, correct. So that's right.

Wait, perhaps the observed rotation is given as -1.2 degrees, but I'm supposed to take the absolute value. No, no, specific rotation can be negative or positive depending on the substance. So the negative is correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere. Let me see the options again.

Options are A: -1.2, B: -0.5, C: -6.15, D: -39.02.

Wait, option D is -39.02. Let me see, 39 is roughly 100 times 0.39. So perhaps I missed a decimal point. Let me think. Where could that be?

Wait, if I computed [α] as -1.2 / (6.15 × 0.5) = -1.2 /3.075 = -0.390. But maybe the correct answer is -39.0, which would be if I didn't convert cm to dm. Because 5 cm is 0.5 dm. If I mistakenly used 5 dm, then denominator would be 6.15 *5 =30.75. Then -1.2/30.75 is approximately -0.039, but that's not matching any option either.

Wait, alternatively, if I forgot to convert cm to dm and used 5 cm as 5 dm, which would be wrong, but let's see what happens. Then denominator is 6.15 *5=30.75. So [α]= -1.2 /30.75≈-0.039. Still not matching any options.

Wait, another possibility. Perhaps the concentration is 6.15 g per liter, which is 0.615 g per 100 ml. Wait, but the question says 6.15g per 100 ml, so that's correct. So that's not it.

Wait, another thought: specific rotation is sometimes expressed in degrees per (g/dm·cm). No, the units are usually degrees per (g/100ml × dm). So maybe I should have the units correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute 1.2 /3.075 again.

3.075 × 0.39 =1.19925, which is just under 1.2. So 0.39 gives 1.19925. The difference is 0.00075. So 0.39 plus 0.00075/3.075 = approx 0.39 + 0.000244 = 0.390244. So [α] is -0.390244.

So approximately -0.39. None of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe it's (α × 100)/(c × l). Let me try that.

So (α ×100) = (-1.2)*100= -120. Divided by (6.15*0.5)=3.075. So -120/3.075 = -39.02.

Oh wait, that's option D. So would that be the case? Because that would give us -39.02.

But why would I multiply α by 100? Because I thought the formula is [α]=α/(c×l). But perhaps the formula is [α] = (α ×100)/(c × l). That would make sense if the concentration is in grams per liter. Because 1 liter is 1000 ml, so 6.15 g per 100 ml is 61.5 g per liter. So if c is in g/L, then the formula would require (c in g/L) × (l in dm). So perhaps the correct formula is [α]=(α × 100)/(c * l), where c is in g/L.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me look up the specific rotation formula properly. Oh right, specific rotation is defined as:

[α] = (α) / (c × l)

where:
α = observed rotation (degrees)
c = concentration in grams per 100 ml
l = path length in decimeters (dm)

So in this case, c is 6.15 g/100ml, l is 0.5 dm.

So [α] = (-1.2) / (6.15 * 0.5) = (-1.2)/3.075 ≈-0.390.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is using a different concentration unit, like grams per liter. Let me try that.

If c is 61.5 g/L (since 6.15 g/100ml is 61.5 g/L), and l is 0.5 dm, then the formula becomes [α] = α / (c × l) = (-1.2) / (61.5 * 0.5) = (-1.2)/(30.75) ≈-0.039016.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the options to see which one fits.

Option D is -39.02.

If [α] is -39.02, then using the formula [α] = α/(c × l), then α = [α] ×c × l.

So α = (-39.02) ×6.15 ×0.5.

Let me compute that: 6.15 ×0.5=3.075. 3.075 × (-39.02) = approximately -120 degrees.

But the observed rotation is only -1.2 degrees. So that can't be right. So option D would imply that α is -120 degrees, which is not the case. So that can't be.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I have to multiply by 100 somewhere else. Let me think. Maybe the concentration is in g/dm³? No, that's the same as g/L.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula uses c in grams per liter, but I forgot to convert 6.15 g/100ml to 61.5 g/L.

So [α] = (-1.2) / (61.5 g/L * 0.5 dm). But that gives [α]= (-1.2)/(30.75)≈-0.039, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses c in g per mL, but that would be a very high concentration unit.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute [α] as I did, getting approximately -0.39, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I can't see how unless the formula is different.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the solution was made with 6.15g per 100ml, but when placed in a 5cm tube, perhaps the actual volume used affects the concentration? No, the concentration remains the same regardless of the volume. So that shouldn't matter.

Wait, perhaps the question gave the concentration as 6.15g per 100ml, but when I put it into the polarimeter tube, maybe it's diluted. No, the question doesn't mention dilution. It says a portion was placed into the polarimeter tube, but the concentration remains the same.

Hmm. I'm stuck. According to my calculation, the specific rotation is approximately -0.39, but that's not an option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: -1.2°
B: -0.5°
C: -6.15°
D: -39.02°

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 1.2 divided by 3.075 again.

3.075 × 0.39 = 1.19925 → which is 1.2 - 0.00075. So 0.39 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use 1.2 degrees without considering the negative. So 1.2 /3.075 = 0.39. But that's a positive value, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct specific rotation is around -0.39, but it's not among the options. But that can't be,
