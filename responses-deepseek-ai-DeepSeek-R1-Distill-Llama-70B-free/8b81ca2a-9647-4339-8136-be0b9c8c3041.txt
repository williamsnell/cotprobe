Question:

A general contractor about to bid on a construction job for an office building invited a carpenter and several others to bid on the carpentry work. The carpenter agreed to bid if the general contractor would agree to give the carpenter the job provided that his bid was lowest and the general contractor was awarded the main contract. The general contractor so agreed. The carpenter, incurring time and expense in preparing his bid, submitted the lowest carpentry bid. The general contractor used the carpenter's bid in calculating its own bid, which was successful. Which of the following best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter?

Options:

A: The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.
B: The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.
C: The carpenter has the necessary skills and experience for the job, hence the general contractor should award the subcontract to him.
D: The carpenter has incurred time and expense in preparing his bid, which obligates the general contractor to award the subcontract.
E: The carpenter's bid was the lowest among all the bids, hence the general contractor is obligated to award the subcontract.
F: The general contractor and the carpenter had a verbal agreement, which obligates the general contractor to award the subcontract.
G: The general contractor's main bid was successful due to the carpenter's low bid, hence the carpenter should be awarded the subcontract.
H: The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.
I: The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.
J: The carpenter has a legal claim to the subcontract because he was invited to bid by the general contractor.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a general contractor who's bidding on a construction job for an office building. The general contractor invites a carpenter and others to bid on the carpentry work. The carpenter agrees to bid only if the general contractor promises to give him the job if two conditions are met: first, if the carpenter's bid is the lowest, and second, if the general contractor gets the main contract. The general contractor agreed to this. 

The carpenter then spent time and money preparing his bid and submitted the lowest one. The general contractor used this bid in calculating their own bid, which was successful. Now, the question is about which option best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to award him the subcontract.

I remember from my studies that this kind of situation often involves the concept of promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel applies when someone makes a promise that another person relies on to their detriment, and it would be unfair if the promise wasn't enforced. 

Looking at the options, option B says that the carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid. That sounds exactly like promissory estoppel. The carpenter relied on the promise (that he'd get the job if his bid was the lowest and the contractor got the main contract) and incurred expenses in preparing the bid. So, the contractor should be estopped from going back on that promise.

Option F mentions a verbal agreement. I think that would be a contract, but I'm not sure if their agreement was sufficiently definite or if there was consideration. The carpenter prepared the bid, which might count as consideration, but I'm leaning towards promissory estoppel being the stronger argument here because the question emphasizes the reliance and detriment.

Option I says the carpenter gave consideration for the promise. Consideration is necessary for a contract, but if the general contractor's promise was in exchange for the bid, maybe that's consideration. But I'm not entirely sure if preparing a bid constitutes valid consideration. It might, but the more straightforward argument is promissory estoppel because the carpenter relied on the promise to his detriment.

Option H talks about an implied duty of good faith. That's a valid point because in contract law, there's an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. But does that apply here? The general contractor did use the carpenter's bid, which might create an expectation, but I think promissory estoppel is a more direct answer.

Option E says the carpenter had the lowest bid, so the contractor is obligated. Without a prior agreement, just having the lowest bid doesn't automatically create a contract. It's the agreement between them that matters, so E alone isn't sufficient.

Option G argues that because the contractor's bid was successful due to the carpenter's low bid, the subcontract should be awarded. But again, without the prior promise, that's more of a moral obligation than a legal one.

Option A suggests the carpenter is an intended beneficiary. That could be a possibility under third-party beneficiary contract law, but the question is about the agreement between the contractor and the carpenter, not a third party.

Option D focuses on the time and expense, but standing alone, that's not enough to create an obligation without the element of reliance on a promise.

Option J says being invited to bid creates a claim, but an invitation to bid is usually just a solicitation, not an offer, so that doesn't create an obligation on its own.

So, putting it all together, the best support for the carpenter's position is option B, because it's about detrimental reliance, which is the core of promissory estoppel. The carpenter relied on the contractor's promise to his detriment by preparing the bid, so the contractor is obligated to award the subcontract.

The scenario involves a general contractor who invited a carpenter to bid on carpentry work under the condition that if the carpenter's bid was the lowest and the general contractor won the main contract, the carpenter would be awarded the subcontract. The carpenter relied on this promise, incurred expenses preparing the bid, and submitted the lowest bid, which the general contractor used to secure the main contract. The question asks which option best supports the carpenter's claim that the general contractor is obligated to award the subcontract.

The correct answer hinges on the legal principle of promissory estoppel, which applies when a promise is relied upon to the detriment of the promisee, and enforcing the promise is necessary to avoid injustice. Here, the carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise by preparing the bid at his own expense. This reliance makes option B the strongest argument, as it directly addresses the elements of promissory estoppel.

Other options, such as verbal agreement (F) or consideration (I), may have merit but are less direct than the reliance argument in B. Options like the lowest bid (E) or good faith (H) are relevant but do not establish a legal obligation without the foundational promise and reliance. Therefore, the best support for the carpenter's position is option B.
