Okay, so I've got this problem about license plates, and I'm supposed to figure out how many different ones are possible. The format is two letters followed by a four-digit integer. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, let's break it down. License plates usually have a certain structure, and this one is no different. First, there are two letters, and then four digits. I remember that when calculating possibilities like this, it's a matter of combinations, specifically permutations with repetition allowed.

So starting with the letters. The English alphabet has 26 letters, right? And since repetition is allowed, each of the two positions can be any letter. So for the first letter, there are 26 options, and for the second letter, also 26. So the number of possible combinations for the letters part is 26 multiplied by 26. Let me calculate that: 26 * 26 equals 676. Yeah, that makes sense because 25*25 is 625, and 26 squared is 676.

Now moving on to the four-digit number. Each digit can be from 0 to 9, and leading zeros are allowed, so that's four digits each with 10 possibilities. Since repetition is allowed here too, each digit is independent. So for each of the four positions, there are 10 choices. So that would be 10^4, which is 10,000. Wait, 10 multiplied four times: 10 *10 is 100, times another 10 is 1000, times another 10 is 10,000. Yep, that's correct.

Now to find the total number of possible license plates, I need to multiply the number of possibilities for the letters by the number for the digits. So that's 676 * 10,000. Let me do that multiplication. 676 times 10,000 is just adding four zeros to 676, which gives 6,760,000. 

Looking at the options, option A is 67,600,000. Hmm, that's way bigger. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, 676 *10,000 is 6,760,000. So that's 6,760,000. Let me check the options again. Option A is 67,600,000 which is an extra zero. Oh wait, no, 676 is 26^2, and 10^4 is 10,000. So 676 *10,000 is 6,760,000. Looking through the options, option E is 6,760,000. Wait, let me check the options again:

Options are A to J. Option A is 67600000, which is 67,600,000. Option E is 6,760,000. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because 26 letters, two letters, so 26^2=676. Then four digits, each 10 options, so 10^4=10000. So 676 *10000=6,760,000.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 676 followed by six zeros, which is 67,600,000. That's ten times larger than what I calculated. Hmm. Did I make an error in the calculation?

Wait, no, 676*10,000 is 6,760,000. So 6,760,000 is the correct number. Let me look at the options again. Which one is that? Looking at the options:

Option A: 67600000 → 67,600,000 → which is 6.76e7.

Option E: 6760000 → 6,760,000 → which is 6.76e6.

So the correct answer should be E.

Wait, but I thought 26^2 is 676, and 10^4 is 10,000, so 676 *10,000 is 6,760,000, which is E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did the question say two letters followed by a four-digit integer? Yes. So yes, 26^2 *10^4 = 676*10,000 = 6,760,000. So the answer is E.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 67600000 which is 67,600,000. Oh wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me re-read it. Oh, it says two letters followed by a four-digit integer. So letters are first, then digits. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as (26 * 26) * (10 *10 *10 *10). Which is 676 *10,000 =6,760,000. So yes, E is the correct option.

To determine the number of possible license plates, we analyze the structure: two letters followed by a four-digit integer. 

1. **Letters**: There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and since repetition is allowed, each of the two positions has 26 possibilities. Thus, the number of combinations for the letters is:  
   \[
   26 \times 26 = 676
   \]

2. **Digits**: Each of the four digits can range from 0 to 9, with repetition allowed. Therefore, the number of combinations for the digits is:  
   \[
   10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^4 = 10,000
   \]

3. **Total combinations**: To find the total number of possible license plates, we multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations:  
   \[
   676 \times 10,000 = 6,760,000
   \]

Now, comparing this result to the given options:  
- Option A: 67,600,000 (too large)  
- Option E: 6,760,000 (matches the calculated result)  

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.  

**Answer: E**
