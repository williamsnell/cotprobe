Question:

A man claims to have inherited property from a wealthy businessman. The man's birth certificate shows that he was born out of wedlock. The record of a proceeding for a support order shows that the businessman was adjudged to be father of the man. However, the man can establish his status as heir of the businessman only if he was legitimated by the marriage of his mother and the businessman subsequent to his birth. Thus, the man must prove that this marriage occurred. The man's attorney has not been able to discover any marriage license or certificate. However, the attorney does have a photograph that shows a couple dressed in wedding clothes. The scene is the front of a church. Bystanders are seen to be throwing rice at the couple and they seem to be responding by smiling and bowing down. The attorney was given the photograph by the man. He found it in his mother's effects following her death. The man believes that the bride in the picture is his mother. He cannot identify the groom. The attorney was informed by a former acquaintance of the businessman who has seen the snapshot that he thinks the groom is the businessman. If the attorney seeks to introduce the photograph as proof that the mother and the businessman were married, the trial judge should rule the photograph

Options:

A: inadmissible as not the best evidence.
B: admissible, only if a witness verifies that it is a correct and accurate representation of the relevant facts.
C: inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay not within any recognized exception.
D: admissible, only if a former acquaintance of the businessman can identify the groom in the photograph.
E: inadmissible, as it does not provide conclusive evidence of a marriage.
F: admissible, only if the man can provide additional evidence supporting his claim that the woman in the picture is his mother.
G: admissible, only if the photographer is available to testify concerning the circumstances under which the photograph was taken.
H: admissible, only if the church where the photograph was taken confirms it was the venue for the mother and the businessman's wedding.
I: inadmissible, as the photograph could be misinterpreted or manipulated.
J: admissible, only if the man can positively identify the groom as the businessman.

Okay, so I have this evidence law question here about admissibility of a photograph to prove a marriage. Let's try to break it down.

The situation is that a man is trying to prove he's the heir of a businessman. His birth certificate shows he was born out of wedlock, but there's a support order where the businessman was adjudged as his father. To inherit, he needs to show he was legitimated by the marriage of his mother and the businessman after his birth. So the key is proving that marriage happened.

The attorney doesn't have a marriage license or certificate, which would be the best evidence, I think. But they have a photograph. The photo shows a couple in wedding clothes in front of a church, with bystanders throwing rice. The man found it in his mother's things after she died and thinks the bride is his mother. He can't identify the groom. But a former acquaintance of the businessman, who has seen the photo, thinks the groom is the businessman.

The question is whether the trial judge should admit this photo as proof of the marriage.

Looking at the options, the main issue is whether the photo is admissible and under what conditions.

I remember that the best evidence rule (FRE 1002) says that to prove the content of a writing, you need the original. But here, the photo isn't a writing; it's a photograph of an event. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply. Wait, but the photo is being offered to prove that a marriage occurred, not the content of a document. So perhaps it's not about best evidence.

Then, what about hearsay? The photo itself isn't hearsay because it's a non-verbal act. But the issue is how it's being used. The photo is being offered to show that the couple was married, based on the scene and the witness's statement.

So the attorney is trying to introduce the photo as substantive evidence of the marriage. To do that, the photo needs to be authenticated. Authentication is under FRE 901 and 902. For a photograph, a witness with knowledge can testify that it's a true representation. Here, the man can say it's his mother, but he can't identify the groom. The former acquaintance can say he thinks the groom is the businessman.

But does the photo alone, without more, suffice? Or does it require someone to testify that it's a wedding scene, etc.

Wait, the photo shows a couple in wedding attire, at a church, with rice being thrown. That's circumstantial evidence of a wedding. But to connect it to the specific individuals, we need more.

So maybe the photo is admissible only if someone can verify that the groom is the businessman. Because without that, the photo just shows some wedding, but not necessarily the businessman and the man's mother.

Alternatively, the man can identify his mother, but not the groom. The acquaintance thinks it's the businessman. So perhaps the photo plus the acquaintance's testimony would be enough to authenticate it as a photo of the businessman and the mother getting married.

So looking at the options, option B says it's admissible only if a witness verifies it's a correct and accurate representation. That seems right, because authentication is needed. The man can verify his mother, and the acquaintance can verify the businessman as the groom.

Alternatively, option D says it's admissible only if the acquaintance can identify the groom. But the man can identify his mother, so both would need to be identified. Wait, but the man can't identify the groom, only the acquaintance can.

So maybe the photo is admissible if a witness can verify the relevant parts. So option B requires a witness to verify correctness, which would include identifying the individuals.

Alternatively, option D is more specific, requiring the acquaintance to identify the groom.

But I think the key point is that the photo needs to be authenticated, which requires a witness to testify that it's a true representation. So without someone saying that's the businessman and the mother, the photo alone isn't enough.

Wait, but the man can identify his mother. So he can testify that the woman is his mother. Then, the acquaintance can testify that the man is the businessman. So between them, both individuals in the photo are identified. So the photo becomes evidence that the two were married, given the setting.

So the photo would be admissible if a witness (the man) can verify his mother, and another witness (the acquaintance) can verify the groom. But the question is about the conditions for admissibility. The options don't specify both, though.

Looking at the options, option B says it's admissible only if a witness verifies it's a correct and accurate representation. That would cover both the scene and the identities. So the man can verify his mother, and the acquaintance can verify the groom. So option B seems to fit.

Alternatively, option D says it's admissible only if the acquaintance can identify the groom. But the man's identification of his mother is also necessary. So maybe the better answer is B.

Wait, another angle: the photo is being offered as substantive evidence of the marriage. So it's real evidence. For real evidence, the requirements are that it's relevant, and properly identified. So authentication is needed, which would require someone to say this is a true representation.

So the attorney would need a witness to authenticate the photo as a wedding between the mother and the businessman. The man can testify about his mother, and the acquaintance can testify about the businessman. So the photo plus their testimony would make it admissible.

Looking at the options, option B says admissible only if a witness verifies correctness. So that's correct because without that, the photo can't be admitted. So the judge should rule it's admissible only if such a witness testifies.

Alternatively, option D requires the acquaintance to identify the groom. But the man's testimony about his mother is also needed. So perhaps option B is broader and correct.

Wait, but what if the photo is self-authenticating? Like, under FRE 902, there are certain ways photos can be self-authenticated, such as by a witness's testimony. So maybe the photo itself, with the scene, plus the man's testimony that it's his mother, is enough. But the groom's identity is another matter.

Alternatively, the photo's content could be sufficient without a witness if it's clear, but in this case, the groom isn't identified by the man. So an additional witness is needed to identify the groom as the businessman.

So the photo can be admitted if a witness can verify the facts, meaning both the event and the identities. So option B is the correct choice.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a photograph as evidence to prove that the man's mother and the businessman were married, thereby legitimating the man's claim to inheritance. The key issues are authentication and the sufficiency of the evidence.

The photograph depicts a couple in wedding attire in front of a church, with bystanders throwing riceâ€”a common wedding custom. While the man can identify the bride as his mother, he cannot identify the groom. However, a former acquaintance of the businessman, who has seen the photograph, believes the groom is the businessman. The attorney seeks to admit this photograph as proof of the marriage.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, authentication is required for real evidence like photographs. Authentication can be achieved through the testimony of a witness who can verify the photograph as a true representation of the relevant facts (FRE 901). In this case, the man can testify that the woman in the photograph is his mother, and the former acquaintance can testify that the groom appears to be the businessman. This dual testimony would authenticate the photograph, making it admissible as evidence of the marriage.

Option B correctly states that the photograph is admissible "only if a witness verifies that it is a correct and accurate representation of the relevant facts." This aligns with the requirement for authentication under FRE 901. While other options, such as Option D, focus on specific aspects of authentication (e.g., identifying the groom), Option B is broader and encompasses the overall need for verification of the photograph's relevance and accuracy.

Thus, the trial judge should rule the photograph admissible only if a witness verifies its correctness and accuracy.
