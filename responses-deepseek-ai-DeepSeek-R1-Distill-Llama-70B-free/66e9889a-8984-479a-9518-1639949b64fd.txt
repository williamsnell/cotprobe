Okay, so I have this problem here about a swimmer experiencing half the surface light intensity as they dive deeper. Hmm, I remember that light intensity in water decreases with depth due to absorption. I think this is related to something called Beer-Lambert Law or something like that.

So the question gives me the molar absorption coefficient of seawater. Let me jot that down. The mean molar absorption coefficient is 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the units here. Oh right, the units are usually in dm³ per mole per cm. So for the Beer-Lambert Law, the formula is A = εlc, where A is absorbance, ε is the molar absorption coefficient, l is the path length, and c is the concentration.

But wait, in this problem, I think they're asking about the transmission of light, not absorbance. Oh right, the Beer-Lambert Law can also relate to the transmittance, which is the fraction of light that passes through. The formula for transmittance (T) is T = I/I₀ = 10^(-A), where I is the transmitted intensity and I₀ is the initial intensity.

So the problem says that the diver experiences half the surface intensity. That means T = 0.5. So 0.5 = 10^(-A). Taking the log of both sides, log(0.5) = -A. So A = - log(0.5). Log(0.5) is log(1/2), which is about -0.3010. So A is 0.3010.

Wait, but A is also equal to ε * l * c. So I can set up the equation as 0.3010 = (6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹) * l * c. Hmm, but wait, what's the concentration here? Oh wait, wait a second. In seawater, the concentration of the absorbing species (probably water itself or other substances) is fixed, right? So in this case, I think the problem is considering the absorption by seawater as a whole, so the concentration would be the concentration of seawater, which is effectively a constant. But wait, the molar absorption coefficient is given per mole, so I need to know the concentration of the solution, which in this case is the concentration of the absorbing substance in seawater.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. Maybe the formula simplifies because the concentration is considered as 1 mol/dm³, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is using a simplified version where the absorption coefficient already accounts for the concentration. Because in many cases, especially when dealing with solutions like seawater, the absorption coefficient is given as a bulk property rather than per molar concentration. So perhaps the given ε already includes the concentration, making the equation A = ε * l, where ε is in dm⁻¹ (since if l is in dm and ε is in dm⁻¹, then A would be unitless, which makes sense).

Wait, but the units given are dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹. Hmm, that complicates things because that's per mole. So I think I need to know the concentration of the absorbing substance in seawater to proceed. But the problem doesn't provide that. Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps in this context, the concentration is 1 mol/dm³, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is using the absorption coefficient as the linear absorption coefficient, which is in units of per length (like cm⁻¹ or m⁻¹). So perhaps I should convert the given ε into the correct units. Let me try that.

The given ε is 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹. Let me convert dm³ to liters, because 1 dm³ is 1 liter. So 6.2e-3 L mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹. Wait, and I want to find the absorption coefficient per unit path length, so maybe I should multiply by the concentration of the solution. But without the concentration, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration is 1 mol/dm³, which would make the units work out.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simplified approach where the product ε*c is given as a single parameter, say, the absorption coefficient in cm⁻¹. Let me think about the units.

If ε is in dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹, and c is in mol/dm³, then ε*c would have units of (dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹) * (mol/dm³) )= cm⁻¹. So that makes sense because the absorption coefficient (let's call it α) would then be in cm⁻¹.

So, if I can calculate α = ε * c, then I can use Beer's Law as I = I₀ * exp(-α l), but wait, no, because when using base 10, the formula is I/I₀ = 10^(-ε c l / 2.303). Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the correct formula is A = ε c l, and then I/I₀ = 10^(-A).

So, in this problem, I need to find the depth l where I/I₀ = 0.5.

So, 0.5 = 10^(-ε c l)

Taking log base 10 on both sides:

log(0.5) = - ε c l

So, ε c l = - log(0.5) = 0.3010

But I don't know c, the concentration. Hmm, but maybe in this problem, we're supposed to assume that c is 1 mol/dm³. Let me check if that makes sense. If c is 1, then ε would be 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹ * 1 mol/dm³ = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Wait, that would make α (absorption coefficient) = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Then, solving for l:

l = 0.3010 / (6.2e-3 cm⁻¹)

Let me compute that.

0.3010 divided by 0.0062 is approximately 48.548 cm. Because 0.0062 * 48 = 0.2976, which is close to 0.3010.

So, 48.548 cm is 0.48548 meters. Wait, but that's about 0.48 meters, which is less than a meter. Looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.77 m, option H: 0.67 m, or F: 0.5 m.

Wait, but I'm getting 0.485 m, which is about 0.49 m, which is close to option F (0.5 m) or E (0.77 m). Hmm, but my calculation gave about 0.485 m, which is 48.5 cm.

But wait, maybe I made a unit mistake. Let me recheck the units.

Given ε is 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹. If we assume c is 1 mol/dm³, then ε*c would be 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹ * 1 mol/dm³ = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹. So that's correct.

Then, l = 0.3010 / (6.2e-3 cm⁻¹) = 0.3010 / 0.0062 cm⁻¹.

Calculating that: 0.3010 / 0.0062 ≈ 48.548 cm, so 0.48548 m, approximately 0.49 m.

But the options don't have 0.49 m. Let me check the options again.

Options:

E: 0.77 m

H: 0.67 m

F: 0.5 m

I: 0.87 m

Wait, my calculation gives 0.485 m, which is approximately 0.49 m. The closest option is F: 0.5 m, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the absorption coefficient is given in terms of molar concentration, but maybe the concentration isn't 1 mol/dm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Another approach: the light intensity decreases exponentially with depth according to I = I₀ exp(-k d), where k is the attenuation coefficient and d is depth. But sometimes, the formula is written in terms of base 10: I = I₀ * 10^(-ε c d / 2.303).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify.

The Beer-Lambert Law is A = ε c l, and A is the absorbance.

Transmittance T = I/I₀ = 10^(-A).

So, given that T = 0.5,

0.5 = 10^(- ε c l)

Take log:

log(0.5) = - ε c l

=> ε c l = - log(0.5) ≈ 0.3010

So, l = 0.3010 / (ε c)

But I don't know c, the concentration of the absorbing substance in seawater. If I can't find c, I can't compute l. So perhaps the problem assumes that ε is given per unit concentration, and the concentration is 1, making the calculation straightforward.

Wait, but maybe in the problem, the given ε is actually the decadic absorption coefficient, which is (ε c). So perhaps the problem is using a simplified approach where ε is given as 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹, but in reality, for seawater, the product ε*c is a known value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given ε as the absorption coefficient per unit path length, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and should consider that the given ε is in terms of per meter, not per cm.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's think about units.

The given ε is 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹.

Let me convert that to m⁻¹.

Since 1 dm = 0.1 m, 1 dm³ = (0.1 m)^3 = 1e-3 m³.

1 cm = 0.01 m.

So, 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹ = 6.2e-3 * (1e-3 m³) / (mol * 0.01 m) )

Wait, that would be 6.2e-3 * (1e-3 / 0.01) m³ mol⁻¹ m⁻¹.

Calculating 1e-3 / 0.01 = 0.1.

So, 6.2e-3 * 0.1 = 6.2e-4 m² mol⁻¹.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about ε in terms of per meter and per mol.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula in terms of natural logarithm because sometimes the attenuation uses e instead of 10. So, the formula would be I = I₀ e^(-α l), where α is the absorption coefficient in m⁻¹.

In that case, for I/I₀ = 0.5,

0.5 = e^(-α l)

Take natural log:

ln(0.5) = - α l

So, α l = ln(2) ≈ 0.693

If I can find α, then l = 0.693 / α.

But I don't know α yet. So, perhaps α is given by ε c, but again, I don't have c.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using base 10 logs, so let me go back to that approach.

Another thought: perhaps in this problem, the product ε c is given as a single value. Wait, but the problem states that ε is the mean molar absorption coefficient. So it's per mole. So without knowing the concentration, I can't proceed. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration is 1 mol/dm³, so that ε c would be 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹ * 1 mol/dm³ = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Then, using that, the absorbance A = ε c l = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹ * l (in cm).

So, A = 6.2e-3 * l_cm.

Wait, but wait, the depth l is in meters. So I should convert it to cm.

Wait, let me structure this properly.

Given:

ε = 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹

Assume concentration c = 1 mol/dm³

Then, ε*c = 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹ * 1 mol/dm³ = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹

So, the absorption coefficient is 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Now, Beer-Lambert Law:

A = ε*c * l

We know that T = I/I₀ = 0.5 = 10^(-A)

So, A = log(2) ≈ 0.3010

So,

0.3010 = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹ * l (cm)

Solving for l:

l (cm) = 0.3010 / (6.2e-3) ≈ 48.548 cm

Which is 0.48548 meters, approximately 0.49 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is F: 0.5 m, but another option is H: 0.67 m, which is about 67 cm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with units somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the calculation, I assumed that l is in cm, because ε*c is in cm⁻¹. So l must be in cm to have the unitless A.

So, l = 0.3010 / (6.2e-3 cm⁻¹) = 0.3010 / 0.0062 cm ≈ 48.548 cm, which is 0.48548 m.

So that's about 0.49 m. The options don't have exactly that, but F is 0.5 m, which is the closest. So the answer should be F: 0.5 m.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. There's option E: 0.77 m, H: 0.67 m, and others.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 0.3010 / 0.0062 again.

0.3010 divided by 0.0062.

Well, 0.0062 times 48 is 0.2976, which is very close to 0.3010. So 48 cm is 0.48 m. So 0.48 m is approximately 0.5 m, which would be option F.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps I'm supposed to use the natural logarithm instead of base 10. Let's try that.

If we use the formula I/I₀ = e^(-α l), where α is in m⁻¹.

Then, ln(0.5) = - α l

So, α l = ln(2) ≈ 0.6931

If α is the same as ε*c, which I computed as 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹, which is 0.062 m⁻¹ (since 1 cm⁻¹ is 0.01 m⁻¹? Wait, no, 1 cm⁻¹ is 100 m⁻¹. Because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 cm⁻¹ = 100 m⁻¹.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm⁻¹ is 1 / 0.01 m = 100 m⁻¹.

So, 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹ is 6.2e-3 * 100 m⁻¹ = 0.62 m⁻¹.

So, α = 0.62 m⁻¹.

Then, l = 0.6931 / 0.62 ≈ 1.118 meters.

Wait, that's about 1.12 m. Looking at the options, option D is 1.2 m, option C is 2.0 m, and option B is 1.5 m.

Hmm, none of the options is exactly 1.12 m, but option D is 1.2 m, which is close. However, this approach uses natural logarithm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach here because the Beer-Lambert Law is usually expressed with base 10 logarithms.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The correct form of the Beer-Lambert Law is:

A = ε c l

And,

T = I/I₀ = 10^(-A)

So, using base 10 is correct in this context.

Thus, the first approach where I found l ≈ 0.485 m (0.49 m) is the correct way, leading to option F (0.5 m).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion when calculating α as 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹. Let me double-check.

Wait, given ε = 6.2e-3 dm³ mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹, and c = 1 mol/dm³,

Then, ε*c = 6.2e-3 dm³/mol cm⁻¹ * 1 mol/dm³ = 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹.

Yes, that's correct. So, 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹ is 0.0062 cm⁻¹.

Wait, no: 6.2e-3 cm⁻¹ is 0.0062 cm⁻¹. So, when calculating l, in cm, l = 0.3010 / 0.0062 cm⁻¹ = 48.548 cm.

So, 48.548 cm is 0.48548 meters, which is approximately 0.49 m. So, the closest option is
