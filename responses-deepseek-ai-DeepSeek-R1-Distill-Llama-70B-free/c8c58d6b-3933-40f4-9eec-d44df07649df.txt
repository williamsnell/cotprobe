Okay, so I've got this graph problem here. Hmm, I need to find the minimum vertex cover of the given undirected graph G. The edges are E = {<0,1>, <4,1>, <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>, <1,3>}. Wait, so each pair represents an edge connecting two nodes.

I remember that a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. And the goal is to find the smallest possible such set. Right.

So first, maybe I should try to visualize the graph. Let me list out all the edges and see which nodes are connected.

Edges:
- 0 connected to 1
- 4 connected to 1
- 2 connected to 0
- 2 connected to 1
- 2 connected to 3
- 1 connected to 3

Wait, so nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are present. Let's think about each node's connections.

Node 0: connected to 1 and 2.
Node 1: connected to 0, 4, 2, 3.
Node 2: connected to 0, 1, 3.
Node 3: connected to 1, 2.
Node 4: connected only to 1.

So node 4 is only connected to 1. Hmm. So if I include 1 in the vertex cover, that would cover the edge to 4. Alternatively, including 4 would cover that edge, but maybe including 1 is better as it covers more edges.

Looking at the edges again, let's list all edges and see which nodes are involved:

Edges are:
<0,1>, so either 0 or 1 must be in the cover.
<4,1>, so 4 or 1.
<2,0>, so 2 or 0.
<2,1>, 2 or 1.
<2,3>, 2 or 3.
<1,3>, 1 or 3.

So, the vertex cover must include at least one node from each edge.

I think starting with nodes that are connected to the most edges could be a good strategy, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to pair the edges and find a minimal set.

Wait, another approach: since the graph is undirected and considering the edges, perhaps I can model this as a bipartite graph and use Konig's theorem. Konig's theorem says that in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching equals the size of the minimum vertex cover. But wait, I'm not sure if this graph is bipartite.

Let me check if the graph is bipartite. A bipartite graph has no odd-length cycles. Hmm, need to see if any cycles exist.

Looking at the edges:

0-1, 1-2, 2-0: that forms a triangle (0-1-2-0). Wait, a triangle is a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So this graph isn't bipartite. So Konig's theorem doesn't apply here. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.

So I should probably try to find the minimum vertex cover manually.

Let me try to see which nodes are critical. Node 1 is connected to 0, 4, 2, 3. So including node 1 would cover four edges: <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>. That leaves the edges <2,0> and <2,3> to be covered.

Wait, edge <2,0> is between 2 and 0. If I include node 2, that would cover <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>, which are edges 2-0, 2-1, 2-3. But I've already included 1, so 2-1 is already covered.

Wait, let me think again. If I include 1, which edges are left uncovered?

After including 1, the edges covered are: all edges incident to 1. So the edges left are <2,0> and <2,3>.

So to cover edge <2,0>, I can include 2 or 0. To cover <2,3>, include 2 or 3.

If I include 2, then both edges are covered. So the set {1,2} would cover all edges.

Wait, let's see:

Edges covered by 1:
<0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>.

Edges covered by 2:
<2,0>, <2,3>, plus the ones already covered by 1.

So yes, {1,2} would cover all edges.

Wait, but wait the original edge list is:

<0,1> → covered by 1
<4,1> → covered by 1
<2,0> → covered by 2
<2,1> → covered by 1
<2,3> → covered by 2
<1,3> → covered by 1.

So yes, that's all covered. So {1,2} is a vertex cover with size 2. But wait, are there any other edges? Let me double-check.

Wait, the edges are as given. So does this mean that the minimum vertex cover is two nodes? But looking at the answer options, none of the options have size 2 except option H: [1,2], which is size 2.

Wait, but let me make sure that this is indeed the minimal. Because perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: maybe the minimal vertex cover is larger. Let me try another selection.

What if I choose nodes 0 and 1?

Node 0 covers edges <0,1> and <2,0>.

Node 1 covers edges <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>.

So together, they cover all edges except <2,3>. So we'd need to include node 2 or 3 as well. So that's size 3. So [0,1,2], which is option F. But that's larger than the {1,2} case.

Alternatively, what if I pick nodes 1 and 3? Let's see:

1 covers <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3>.

3 covers <2,3>, <1,3>.

So the edges left would be <2,0> and <0,1> (but 0 is connected to 1 and 2). So edge <2,0> is between 2 and 0. So if neither 2 nor 0 is in the cover, that edge isn't covered. So the set {1,3} would miss covering <2,0>. So to cover that, I need either 2 or 0. So the cover would be {1,3,2} or {1,3,0}, which are size 3. Not better.

Another option: include node 2 and 3. Let's see:

2 covers <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>.

3 covers <1,3>, <2,3>.

So the edges left would be <4,1> and <0,1>. So we need to include either 1 or 4 and 0 or 1. So adding 1 would cover both. So the set {2,3,1} is size 3. Again, same as before.

Wait, but earlier I thought {1,2} covers all edges. Let me double-check:

Edges:

<0,1> → 1 is in the cover → covered.

<4,1> → 1 is in → covered.

<2,0> → 2 is in → covered.

<2,1> → both 1 and 2 → covered.

<2,3> → 2 is in → covered.

<1,3> → 1 is in → covered.

So yes, all edges are covered by {1,2}.

So that's a vertex cover of size 2. But looking at the options, option H is [1,2], which is size 2. So that's the minimal.

Wait, but let me check option I: [2,3], which is size 2. Let's see if that's a vertex cover.

Edges covered by 2: <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>.

Edges covered by 3: <1,3>, <2,3>.

So the edges left uncovered would be <0,1> and <4,1>. So to cover those, we need either 0,1, or 4. So {2,3} isn't sufficient because <0,1> and <4,1> are not covered. So option I is not a valid vertex cover.

So the minimal is indeed 2 nodes: 1 and 2. So the answer is H: [1,2].

Wait, but let me look at the options again. The options are:

A: [0, 1]
B: [1,3,4]
C: [1,2,3]
D: [2,3,4]
E: [0,2,4]
F: [0,1,2]
G: [0,4]
H: [1,2]
I: [2,3]
J: [0,2,3]

So H is [1,2], which is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes the minimal vertex cover might require more nodes, but in this case, two seem to suffice.

Another way to think: find maximum matching. Wait, but since the graph isn't bipartite, Konig's theorem doesn't apply. But for bipartitioned graphs, maximum matching size equals minimal vertex cover size.

Alternatively, maybe the graph can be broken down into parts.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just accept that {1,2} is a valid vertex cover and is the minimal.

To determine the minimum vertex cover of the given undirected graph \( G \) with edges \( E = \{<0,1>, <4,1>, <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>, <1,3>\} \), we need a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest such set.

### Analysis of the Graph
1. **Edges and Their Connections**:
   - \( <0,1> \): Connects nodes 0 and 1.
   - \( <4,1> \): Connects nodes 4 and 1.
   - \( <2,0> \): Connects nodes 2 and 0.
   - \( <2,1> \): Connects nodes 2 and 1.
   - \( <2,3> \): Connects nodes 2 and 3.
   - \( <1,3> \): Connects nodes 1 and 3.

2. **Critical Nodes**:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 2, and 3, making it a central hub.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
   - Node 4 is only connected to node 1.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.

3. **Vertex Cover Strategy**:
   - Including node 1 in the vertex cover covers edges \( <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,1>, <1,3> \).
   - Including node 2 covers edges \( <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3> \).
   - Together, nodes 1 and 2 cover all edges in the graph:
     - \( <0,1> \): Covered by 1.
     - \( <4,1> \): Covered by 1.
     - \( <2,0> \): Covered by 2.
     - \( <2,1> \): Covered by both 1 and 2.
     - \( <2,3> \): Covered by 2.
     - \( <1,3> \): Covered by 1.

Thus, the set \( \{1, 2\} \) forms a valid vertex cover, and no smaller set can cover all edges.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A: [0, 1]**: Covers \( <0,1>, <4,1>, <2,0>, <2,1> \), but leaves \( <2,3> \) uncovered. Not valid.
- **Option B: [1, 3, 4]**: Covers all edges, but is larger than necessary. Size 3.
- **Option C: [1, 2, 3]**: Covers all edges, but is larger than necessary. Size 3.
- **Option D: [2, 3, 4]**: Covers all edges, but is larger than necessary. Size 3.
- **Option E: [0, 2, 4]**: Covers all edges, but is larger than necessary. Size 3.
- **Option F: [0, 1, 2]**: Covers all edges, but is larger than necessary. Size 3.
- **Option G: [0, 4]**: Does not cover \( <2,0>, <2,1>, <2,3>, <1,3> \). Not valid.
- **Option H: [1, 2]**: Covers all edges. Size 2.
- **Option I: [2, 3]**: Does not cover \( <0,1>, <4,1> \). Not valid.
- **Option J: [0, 2, 3]**: Covers all edges, but is larger than necessary. Size 3.

### Conclusion
The minimum vertex cover is \( \{1, 2\} \), which corresponds to **Option H**.

Answer: H
