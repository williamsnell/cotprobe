Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this projector problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a projector using 1x1 inch lantern slides. The projector has a lamp with a circular filament that's 0.25 inches in diameter. There's a condensing lens with a focal length of 1 inch, and it forms an image of the filament that just fills a projection lens which is 1.25 inches in diameter.

The question has three parts: (a) finding the focal length of the projection lens, (b) determining the size of the image on a screen 25.5 feet away, and (c) the effect of covering half the projection lens with an opaque card.

Alright, starting with part (a). I remember that in optics, the condensing lens is used to focus light onto the projection lens. So the condensing lens creates an image of the filament, and that image is at the focal point of the projection lens, I think.

Wait, no, maybe it's a bit different. Let me think. The condensing lens forms an image of the filament. Since the filament is 0.25 inches in diameter, the image formed by the condensing lens must be the size of the projection lens's entrance pupil. The projection lens is 1.25 inches in diameter, so that's the size of the image formed by the condensing lens.

So, the condensing lens has a focal length of 1 inch. We can model this with the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.

But wait, the object here is the filament, which is placed at the focal point of the condensing lens? Because usually, in projectors, the object (like the filament) is placed at the focal point of the condensing lens so that the light is collimated. Hmm, wait, no. The condensing lens is used to collect light and focus it. So maybe the filament is placed just beyond the focal point, so the lens forms a real image.

Alternatively, perhaps the image of the filament is formed at a certain position by the condensing lens. The projection lens then takes that image and projects it onto the screen.

Wait, the problem states that the image of the filament just fills the projection lens. So the image formed by the condensing lens must be exactly fitting into the projection lens's aperture. So the diameter of the image is 1.25 inches.

The object for the condensing lens is the filament, which is 0.25 inches in diameter. So we can think about magnification. The magnification m is the ratio of the image height to the object height. So m = hi/ho = (-di)/(do), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the condensing lens forms an image of the filament. The size of that image is 1.25 inches. The object (filament) is 0.25 inches. So the magnification here would be hi/ho = 1.25 / 0.25 = 5. So m is 5. 

But wait, magnification is also equal to di/do, but with a negative sign if the image is inverted. But since the filament is small and inside the projector, I think the image is real and inverted, so m would be negative. But the magnification's magnitude is 5.

So, |m| = |di/do| =5.

We're using the condensing lens, which has f=1 inch. So from the thin lens formula, 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

And m = -di/do → di = -m do.

But since m is positive 5 in magnitude, then di = -5 do. Hmm, but since the image is real, di should be positive, and do should be positive as well. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of absolute values for magnification here.

Wait, perhaps the image is formed on the other side, so di is positive. Let me clarify.

Using the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

We also know that m = -di/do → di = -m do.

Substituting into the equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/(-m do) → 1/f = (1 - 1/m)/do.

Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, since m = hi/ho = di/do, but considering signs: m = -di/do. So di = -m do.

Substituting into 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/f = 1/do + 1/(-m do) → 1/f = (1 - 1/m)/do.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The magnification is hi/ho = 5, but since the image is inverted, m would be -5.

So m = -di/do → di = -m do = 5 do.

Wait, that would make di positive if do is positive, which seems right because the image is formed on the opposite side.

So substituting into the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/1 = 1/do + 1/(5 do) → 1 = (1 + 1/5)/do → 1 = (6/5)/do → do = 6/5 inches = 1.2 inches.

Wait, but the object is the filament, placed at do = 1.2 inches from the condensing lens. Then the image is formed at di = 5 do = 6 inches from the lens.

Wait, but the projection lens is placed at this image location, so the projection lens is located 6 inches from the condensing lens.

Wait, but the projection lens has a diameter of 1.25 inches. So the image from the condensing lens is 1.25 inches in diameter, which matches the projection lens's aperture.

So, for the projection lens, the object is the slide, which is 1x1 inch. The image is formed on the screen, which is 25.5 feet away.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The condensing lens forms an image of the filament at the projection lens's position. Then the projection lens uses that image as its object, but wait, no. The projection lens is used to project the image of the slide onto the screen. So perhaps the slide is placed at the focal point of the projection lens, so that the projection lens forms a real image at infinity, but then when the screen is at a finite distance, the slide must be slightly beyond the focal point.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the setup.

In a typical projector setup, the condensing lens focuses the light from the lamp onto the slide, creating a beam of light that's as parallel as possible. The projection lens then takes that parallel beam and focuses it onto the screen, creating an image of the slide.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the condensing lens is used to collect light from the lamp and focus it onto the slide. The projection lens then takes the light from the slide and projects it onto the screen.

Wait, perhaps the slide is placed at the focal point of the condensing lens. But the filament is the light source, so the condensing lens focuses the filament's image at the slide's position. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the condensing lens forms an image of the filament just filling the aperture of the projection lens. So the image of the filament is 1.25 inches, which is the size of the projection lens. So the projection lens is located at di from the condensing lens, which we calculated earlier as 6 inches.

Now, for the projection lens, the object is the slide, which is placed at a certain position. The image is on the screen, which is 25.5 feet away.

Wait, but we're being asked to find the focal length of the projection lens, part (a). So perhaps the projection lens forms an image of the slide on the screen. But the slide is placed where? In projectors, the slide is placed just beyond the focal point of the projection lens, so that the image is real and inverted on the screen.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me try to approach part (a) step by step.

We have the condensing lens: focal length f1 = 1 inch. It forms an image of the filament (diameter 0.25") that just fills the projection lens (diameter 1.25"). So the image formed by the condensing lens is 1.25" in diameter.

So the magnification m1 is hi/ho = 1.25 / 0.25 = 5. So m1 = 5.

From the lens formula: m1 = -di/do → 5 = -di/do. Since the image is real, di is positive, do is positive, so the negative implies that the image is inverted.

So di = -5 do.

From the thin lens equation: 1/f1 = 1/do + 1/di.

Substituting f1=1, di=5 do:

1/1 = 1/do + 1/(5 do) → 1 = (5 + 1)/(5 do) → 1 = 6/(5 do) → do=6/5 inches = 1.2 inches.

Then di=5 do=5*(1.2)=6 inches.

So the image of the filament is 6 inches from the condensing lens.

Now, this image serves as the object for the projection lens. Wait, no, because the projection lens is focusing the light from the slide. Alternatively, perhaps the projection lens is placed such that the image formed by the condensing lens is at its focal point.

Wait no, maybe the projection lens is part of the system that projects the slide's image. So the projection lens has the slide at its object plane, and the image is on the screen. But the condensing lens's image is at the projection lens's aperture.

Wait, maybe the projection lens is a simple lens, and the image of the filament is at its focal point. So the distance from the condensing lens to the projection lens is equal to the focal length of the projection lens.

Wait, because if the image is formed at the focal point of the projection lens, then the projection lens would take that image and project it to infinity, creating parallel rays. But that might not directly help here.

Alternatively, perhaps the projection lens is placed such that its focal point coincides with the image formed by the condensing lens. So the distance between the two lenses is equal to the focal length of the projection lens.

Wait, let me think again. The image from the condensing lens is at 6 inches from the condensing lens, so if the projection lens is placed 6 inches away, then that image is at the projection lens's position. Wait, no, because the projection lens's focal length determines where the image is formed.

Wait, perhaps the image formed by the condensing lens is at the focal point of the projection lens, meaning that the projection lens would then form an image at infinity, but that's not helpful for projecting on a screen. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the projection lens is used in a way that the slide is placed at its focal point, so that the light is collimated, but then the image on the screen would be at infinity, which doesn't make sense either.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the projection lens forms an image of the slide, and the size of that image depends on the focal length of the projection lens and the distance to the screen.

But for part (a), we're only asked about the focal length of the projection lens. So maybe the image of the filament (1.25") is the aperture of the projection lens, and the projection lens's focal length can be determined based on the size of the image and the slide.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the projection lens's aperture. The projection lens has a diameter of 1.25 inches, so its radius is 0.625 inches. The image of the filament is 1.25 inches in diameter, which fills the aperture of the projection lens. So the projection lens is placed such that the image of the filament is at its focal point, making the light rays parallel after passing through it.

Wait, that makes sense. If the image of the filament is at the focal point of the projection lens, then the projection lens would emit parallel rays, which would then be focused by the projection on the screen when the slide is in place.

Wait, but the slide is placed where? Maybe the slide is placed just in front of the projection lens, so that when the parallel rays hit the slide, they spread out, and the projection lens forms an image of the slide on the screen.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. For the projection lens, when used to project an image, the object (the slide) is placed slightly beyond the focal point, so that a real image is formed on the screen.

So the focal length f2 of the projection lens is such that when the object (slide) is at a distance u from the lens, the image is formed at a distance v on the screen. Using the thin lens formula: 1/f2 = 1/v + 1/u.

But I don't know u or v yet. Wait, but perhaps the size of the image on the screen relates to the focal length. The slide is 1x1 inch, and the image on the screen would be magnified based on the ratio of v to u.

But wait, part (b) asks about the image size when the screen is 25.5 feet away. So maybe I can find f2 using the information from the condensing lens.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the projection lens's aperture. The image from the condensing lens is 1.25 inches in diameter, which fills the projection lens's aperture. So the projection lens's aperture is 1.25 inches, which would imply a certain f-number, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps the image formed by the condensing lens is at the focal point of the projection lens. So the distance between the two lenses (condensing and projection) is equal to f1 + f2, where f1 is 1 inch, and f2 is the focal length we're trying to find. Because the image from the condensing lens is at di=6 inches from the condensing lens, so the projection lens is placed 6 inches from the condensing lens. So then, the distance between the two lenses would be 6 inches.

Wait, wait. The image from the condensing lens is at 6 inches from it. If that image coincides with the focal point of the projection lens, then the projection lens's focal length would be 6 inches minus the distance between the two lenses. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the projection lens is placed so that its focal point is at the image position of the condensing lens, then the distance between the two lenses would be f2, because the image is at the focal point of the projection lens. So the projection lens's focal length f2 would be 6 inches minus the distance between the two lenses, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should consider the magnification of the projection lens. The projection lens has an aperture of 1.25 inches, and the image of the filament is 1.25 inches, so perhaps the magnification is 1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the projection lens's focal length can be determined by considering that the image of the filament is at the focal point of the projection lens. So the distance from the condensing lens to the projection lens would be f1 + f2, because the object (filament) is at f1, and the image is at f2 from the projection lens.

Wait, that might make sense. So the distance between the two lenses is f1 + f2. From the condensing lens, the image is formed at 6 inches. So the projection lens is located 6 inches from the condensing lens. So f1 + f2 = 6 inches. Since f1 is 1 inch, f2 would be 5 inches.

Wait, that seems plausible. So f2 = 5 inches. Let me check if that makes sense.

So if the projection lens is 5 inches focal length, then the distance between the two lenses is 1 + 5 = 6 inches, which matches the image distance from the condensing lens. That sounds right.

So part (a)'s answer would be f = 5 inches. Wait, looking at the options, let's check. The options are in inches, I think, because the focal lengths are in the range of 4.5 to 8 inches.

Looking at the options, option J is f=5", but let's check the other options. Option A:6, B:7, etc.

Wait, but I thought f2 was 5 inches. Let me make sure.

Wait, the image from the condensing lens is at 6 inches from the condensing lens. The projection lens is placed such that this image is at its focal point, so the distance from the projection lens to this image is f2. So the distance between the condensing lens and the projection lens is 6 inches, which equals f1 + f2. So 6 = 1 + f2 → f2=5 inches. Yes, that makes sense.

So the projection lens's focal length is 5 inches.

Wait, but let's see the options. Option J says f=5", image 60x60, etc. Option A is 6", H is 7", etc.

So for part (a), answer is 5 inches, but looking at the options, option J has f=5".

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, the image from the condensing lens is at 6 inches from the condensing lens. The projection lens is placed such that this image is at its focal point. So the distance between the two lenses is 6 inches, which would be f1 + f2. So 6 = 1 + f2 → f2=5". So yes, that's correct.

So part (a) is 5". Now part (b), image size on the screen 25.5 feet away.

Wait, 25.5 feet is 25.5 *12 = 306 inches.

So the projection lens forms an image of the slide on the screen located 306 inches away.

The object (slide) is 1x1 inch. Using the thin lens formula: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

We have f=5", di=306". We can solve for do.

1/5 = 1/do + 1/306 → 1/do = 1/5 - 1/306 → let's compute that.

1/5 is 0.2, 1/306 ≈ 0.003268. So 0.2 - 0.003268 ≈ 0.196732 → do ≈
