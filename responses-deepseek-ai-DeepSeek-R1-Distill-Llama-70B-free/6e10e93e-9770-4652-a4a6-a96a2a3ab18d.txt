Okay, so I have this problem to solve about calculating the molar weight of a non-electrolyte solution. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states: We have 35.0 grams of a non-electrolyte dissolved in 100 mL of water. The boiling point of the solution is 102.16°C. I need to find the approximate molar weight of the solute. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with boiling point elevation, the formula is ΔT = i * K_b * m. Oh right, where ΔT is the change in boiling point, i is the van't Hoff factor, K_b is the boiling point elevation constant, and m is the molality.

Since the solute is a non-electrolyte, that means it doesn't dissociate in solution. So the van't Hoff factor i should be 1. That makes sense because non-electrolytes don't split into ions.

First, I need to find ΔT. The boiling point of pure water is 100°C, and the solution boils at 102.16°C. So the change is 102.16 - 100 = 2.16°C. Got that.

Next, I need the K_b for water. I think the K_b for water is around 0.512 °C·kg/mol. I remember that because it's a common value. So K_b is 0.512.

Now, plugging into the formula: ΔT = i * K_b * m. We can rearrange this to solve for m (molality). So m = ΔT / (i * K_b).

Plugging in the numbers: m = 2.16 / (1 * 0.512) = 2.16 / 0.512. Let me calculate that. 2.16 divided by 0.512. Hmm, 0.512 times 4 is 2.048. 2.16 minus 2.048 is 0.112. So that's 4 plus (0.112 / 0.512). 0.112 / 0.512 is about 0.21875. So total is approximately 4.21875 mol/kg. Let's say m ≈ 4.22 m.

Wait, but wait. The solution is 100 mL of water. Oh, right, because molality is moles per kilogram of solvent. So the mass of the solvent is needed in kg. 100 mL of water is approximately 100 grams, right? Because the density of water is about 1 g/mL. So 100 g is 0.1 kg. Wait, no, 100 mL is about 100 grams, which is 0.1 kg. So the amount of solvent is 0.1 kg.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Because molality is moles per kg of solvent. So, m = moles / kg. But I have m as 4.22 mol/kg, which is moles per kg. But the solvent here is 0.1 kg, so the moles would be m * kg = 4.22 * 0.1 = 0.422 moles? Because moles = m * kg of solvent. Right, because m is molality, which is moles per kg.

Wait, but the mass of the solute is 35.0 grams. So the molar mass M is mass/moles. So M = 35.0 g / 0.422 mol ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 35 divided by 0.422. Let's see. 35 / 0.4 is 87.5. But 0.422 is a bit more than 0.4, so the result will be a bit less than 87.5. Let's compute 0.422 * 82 = approx 34.6. Hmm, 0.422 * 82 = 34.6. So 35 is a bit more. Let's see, 82 + (35-34.6)/0.422 = 82 + 0.4/0.422 ≈ 82.95. So around 83 g/mol. Wait, but wait, let me do it more accurately.

Alternatively, 35 / 0.422 = ?

35 ÷ 0.422. Let me compute this. Let's see, 0.422 times 80 is 33.76. Subtract that from 35: 35 -33.76=1.24. Then 1.24 / 0.422 ≈ 2.936. So total is 80 + 2.936 = 82.936, approximately 83 g/mol. So the molar mass is about 83 g/mol.

Looking at the options: Option I is 84 g/mol. That's very close. So the answer should be I.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

First, ΔT = 2.16°C. Correct.

Then, m = ΔT/(i*K_b) = 2.16/(1*0.512) = 4.21875 m. That's correct.

Molality m is 4.21875 mol/kg. Since the solvent mass is 100g=0.1 kg, the moles of solute are 4.21875 * 0.1 = 0.421875 mol. Correct.

Mass of solute is 35.0 g, so M = 35 / 0.421875 ≈ 82.94 g/mol. So around 83, which matches option I:84. Close enough.

Wait, but wait another thing. I thought the problem was about a solution in 100 mL of water. So does that mean the total solution volume is 100 mL, or is the solvent 100 mL? Oh, the problem says 35.0 grams of the non-electrolyte in solution with 100 mL water. So the solvent is 100 mL, which is 100 grams ≈ 0.1 kg. So yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems right. So the answer is I:84 g/mol.

To calculate the approximate molar weight of the non-electrolyte, we use the boiling point elevation formula:

\[
\Delta T = i \cdot K_b \cdot m
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in boiling point,
- \(i\) is the van't Hoff factor (1 for non-electrolytes),
- \(K_b\) is the boiling point elevation constant for water (\(0.512 \, \text{°C·kg/mol}\)),
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution.

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta T\)
The boiling point of pure water is \(100 \, \text{°C}\), and the solution boils at \(102.16 \, \text{°C}\). Thus:

\[
\Delta T = 102.16 - 100 = 2.16 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for molality (\(m\))
Rearranging the formula:

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T}{i \cdot K_b}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
m = \frac{2.16}{1 \cdot 0.512} = 4.21875 \, \text{mol/kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate moles of solute
The mass of the solvent (water) is \(100 \, \text{mL} = 100 \, \text{g} = 0.1 \, \text{kg}\). Molality is defined as moles per kilogram of solvent, so:

\[
\text{Moles of solute} = m \cdot \text{kg of solvent} = 4.21875 \cdot 0.1 = 0.421875 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate molar weight
The mass of the solute is \(35.0 \, \text{g}\). Molar weight (\(M\)) is given by:

\[
M = \frac{\text{Mass of solute}}{\text{Moles of solute}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
M = \frac{35.0}{0.421875} \approx 82.94 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated molar weight (\(82.94 \, \text{g/mol}\)) is closest to option **I: 84 g/mol**.
