Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 14 plus negative 71. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, adding a positive and a negative number... I remember that when you add a positive and a negative, it's like subtracting the smaller number from the larger one and taking the sign of the larger number. So, which one is larger here, 14 or 71?

Well, 71 is definitely bigger than 14. Since 71 is negative in this case, the result should be negative. So, I subtract 14 from 71. Let me do that calculation: 71 minus 14 is... wait, 70 minus 10 is 60, and 1 minus 4 is -3, so wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, no, I should subtract 14 from 71. So 71 minus 14 is 57. Because 14 plus 57 equals 71. So the result should be -57.

Let me double-check that. If I have 14 and I add -71, that's the same as 14 - 71. Yeah, because adding a negative is subtracting. So 14 minus 71 is... let's see, 71 minus 14 is 57, so since 71 is bigger, it's negative 57. So the answer should be -57.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A to J. Option F is -57, so that's probably the correct one. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Another way to think about it: starting at 14 on the number line and moving 71 steps to the left (because it's negative), so 14 -71. 14 minus 70 is -56, and then minus 1 more is -57. Yep, that checks out.

So the correct answer should be F: -57.

The expression to solve is \(14 + (-71)\), which simplifies to \(14 - 71\). Since \(71\) is larger than \(14\), the result will be negative. Subtracting \(14\) from \(71\) gives \(57\), so the final result is \(-57\). Among the options, the correct one is:

F: −57

Answer: F
