Okay, so I've got this question about warranties in sales, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is that a buyer purchases an item from a merchant, and the item turns out to be unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The question is asking which warranty the buyer can invoke, assuming there are no other warranties. The options are from A to J, each listing a different type of warranty.

First, I remember that in contract law, especially regarding sales, there are different types of warranties that can come into play. Warranties can be express or implied. Express warranties are explicitly stated by the seller, like in a written guarantee. Implied warranties, on the other hand, are automatically part of the sale under the law, regardless of what the seller says.

The question mentions that there are no other warranties, so I think that rules out any express warranties because those would be additional and explicitly stated. So we're probably looking at an implied warranty here.

Now, the key terms in the question are "unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes." That makes me think about the implied warranty of merchantability. I recall that the warranty of merchantability is an implied promise that the goods are fit for their ordinary purpose. So if the item isn't suitable for what it's normally used for, this warranty might apply.

Wait, but there's another option called the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. I remember that this applies when the buyer has a specific use in mind, different from the ordinary use, and the seller knows about this. For example, if I buy a car specifically to drive in extreme off-road conditions and the seller assures me it's suitable for that, then the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose would apply.

In this question, the problem is that the item is unfit for its ordinary purposes. So that points more towards the warranty of merchantability. The other option, fitness for a particular purpose, isn't triggered here because the issue is with the ordinary use, not a special use.

Looking at the options, option C is "Warranty of merchantability" and option F is "Warranty of fitness for a particular purpose." So the correct answer here should be C.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option B is "Implied warranty," which is a broader category. The warranty of merchantability is a type of implied warranty, so B could be a correct category, but the question is asking which specific warranty applies. So the more specific answer would be C.

Option D is "Warranty of suitability," which I'm not as familiar with. I think suitability might relate to fitness for a particular purpose, but I'm not certain. Either way, the key here is the ordinary purpose, which points to merchantability.

So putting it all together, the buyer would invoke the warranty of merchantability because the item isn't fit for its ordinary use. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.

The question involves a buyer purchasing an item that is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The task is to identify the appropriate warranty the buyer can invoke, assuming no other warranties are present.

In sales law, warranties can be categorized into express and implied. Express warranties are explicitly stated by the seller, while implied warranties are automatically part of the sale under the law. Since the question specifies "no other warranties," it rules out express warranties, focusing instead on implied warranties.

The item's unfitness for its ordinary purposes points to the **implied warranty of merchantability**, which ensures goods are fit for their ordinary use. This is distinct from the **warranty of fitness for a particular purpose**, which applies only when the buyer has a specific, non-ordinary use in mind and the seller is aware of it. Here, the issue lies with the ordinary purpose, making the warranty of merchantability the correct choice.

Other options like "implied warranty" (B) are broader categories, but the question asks for the specific warranty. "Warranty of suitability" (D) is less relevant, as it aligns more with fitness for a particular purpose.

Thus, the buyer can invoke the **warranty of merchantability**.

Answer: C
