Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the scenario is about a defendant who drove two men to a house. The two men burglarized the home while the defendant waited in the car. They stole jewelry, pawned it, and later gave the defendant some money. Now, the question is about the defendant's legal liability—what crimes is he guilty of?

First, I think I need to understand the elements of the crimes involved. The two main issues here seem to be aiding and abetting a burglary and receiving stolen property.

Let's start with aiding and abetting a burglary. Aiding and abetting means that the defendant assisted in the commission of a crime. For burglary, the elements are typically unlawful entry into a structure with the intent to commit a felony inside. So, the two men entered the house with the intent to steal, which makes them guilty of burglary.

Now, did the defendant aid or abet this burglary? The defendant drove them to the house. But the problem states that the two men didn't tell the defendant what they intended to do. So, the defendant wasn't aware of their plan. But wait, is knowledge required for aiding and abetting? I remember that for aiding and abetting, the defendant must have knowledge of the felony and intent to aid in its commission. 

So, if the defendant didn't know about the burglary plan, he couldn't have intended to help them commit it. Therefore, he might not be guilty of aiding and abetting the burglary. Because without knowledge, the necessary intent isn't there.

Wait, but sometimes there's the concept of willful blindness. If the defendant should have known what was happening, even if he didn't know for sure. But in this case, the men didn't tell him anything. He drove them, waited, and then they came back with stolen goods, but he didn't know until later. So maybe he didn't have knowledge at the time of the burglary. So perhaps he's not guilty of aiding and abetting.

Next, let's look at receiving stolen property. The elements are that the defendant received property that was stolen, knowing that it was stolen, with the intent to deprive the owner. 

In this case, the two men pawned the jewelry and later gave the defendant $500. The defendant kept the money and didn't report it. But when did he find out about the theft? The next day, they pawned it, but the defendant was told about the burglary two weeks later. So when he received the $500, he didn't know it was from stolen property yet. Or wait, no—when they gave him the money, they told him about the burglary for the first time. So at the time he received the money, he learned it was stolen. 

Wait, but the timing is important. The defendant received the money after the theft, and at the time of receiving, he learned about the burglary. So when he accepted the $500, he knew it was from stolen goods. So does that make him guilty of receiving stolen property?

Yes, because at the time he received the money, he knew it was stolen. So he knowingly received the stolen property. That would make him guilty of receiving stolen property.

So putting it together: the defendant didn't aid and abet the burglary because he didn't know about it at the time. But he did receive stolen property because he accepted money knowing it was from the burglary.

Looking at the options, let me go through them.

Option A: guilty of aiding and abetting burglary but not receiving stolen property. No, because I think he's not guilty of aiding.

Option B: Not guilty of receiving, guilty of aiding. No, opposite of what I thought.

Option C: guilty of receiving, not guilty of aiding. That fits what I concluded.

Option D: guilty of both plus burglary. No, he didn't commit burglary himself.

Option E: guilty of both. No, because I don't think he aided.

Option F: guilty of burglary and receiving. No, he didn't commit burglary.

Option G: guilty of burglary, no. Same as above.

Option H: not guilty of either. No, because he is guilty of receiving.

Option I: not guilty of burglary but guilty of aiding. No, because aiding requires knowledge.

So the correct answer should be option C: guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of aiding and abetting burglary.

The defendant's liability revolves around two crimes: aiding and abetting burglary and receiving stolen property. For aiding and abetting, the defendant must have knowingly assisted in the commission of the crime. However, the facts indicate that the defendant was unaware of the two men's plan to burglarize the home at the time he drove them there. Without knowledge of the intended felony, the defendant cannot be guilty of aiding and abetting burglary.

Regarding receiving stolen property, the defendant accepted $500 from the two men after they informed him about the burglary. At the time of receiving the money, the defendant knew it was derived from stolen goods, satisfying the elements of knowingly receiving stolen property. Therefore, the defendant is guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of aiding and abetting burglary.

The correct answer is:

C: guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of aiding and abetting a burglary.

Answer: C
