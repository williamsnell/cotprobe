Question:

Restate the utility-maximizing rule in algebraic terms.

Options:

A: MU_A / Price_B = MU_B / Price_A = MU_C / Price_D = MU_D / Price_C
B: MU_A = MU_B = MU_C = MU_D
C: MU_A + MU_B = Price_A + Price_B
D: MU_A - MU_B = Price_A - Price_B
E: MU_A * MU_B * MU_C * MU_D = Price_A * Price_B * Price_C * Price_D
F: MU_A ^2 / Price_A = MU_B ^2 / Price_B
G: MU_A * Price_A = MU_B * Price_B = MU_C * Price_C = MU_D * Price_D
H: MU_A / MU_B = Price_A / Price_B
I: MU_A / Price_A ^2 = MU_B / Price_B ^2 = MU_C / Price_C ^2 = MU_D / Price_D ^2
J: (MU_A /Price_A) = (MU_B /Price_B) = (MU_C /Price_C) = (MU_D /Price_D)

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about the utility-maximizing rule. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that this has to do with how consumers allocate their budget to maximize their satisfaction or utility. Let me try to recall the details.

The question is asking to restate the utility-maximizing rule in algebraic terms. The options are from A to J, each presenting a different equation. I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I think the utility-maximizing rule is about how a consumer should allocate their income across different goods to get the highest possible utility. The key idea is that at the optimal point, the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good should be equal. That way, the last dollar spent on each good gives the same amount of additional utility. If one good gave more marginal utility per dollar than another, the consumer would reallocate their spending to buy more of the first and less of the second until the marginal utilities equalize.

So, in algebraic terms, for any two goods, say A and B, the marginal utility of A divided by its price should equal the marginal utility of B divided by its price. So the equation would be MU_A / Price_A = MU_B / Price_B. And this would extend to all other goods as well, like C and D, so that all these ratios are equal.

Looking at the options:

Option H is MU_A / MU_B = Price_A / Price_B. Wait, that's the ratio of marginal utilities equals the ratio of prices, which is another way of saying the same thing as what I was thinking. Because if you cross-multiply, MU_A * Price_B = MU_B * Price_A, which leads to MU_A/Price_A = MU_B/Price_B. So H and J might be related.

Wait, let me look again. Option J is (MU_A / Price_A) = (MU_B / Price_B) = ... and so on for C and D. That exactly matches what I was thinking. So J looks correct.

Option H says MU_A/MU_B = Price_A/Price_B, which is the same as (MU_A/Price_A) = (MU_B/Price_B), so H is also a correct expression but only for two goods, while J extends it to all goods. But the question is about the general rule, which would include all goods, so J is more comprehensive.

Wait, but the question says "Restate the utility-maximizing rule in algebraic terms." The rule applies to all goods, so the correct equation should show that for each good, the ratio of marginal utility to price is equal across all of them. So J is the one where each (MU/Price) is equal for all goods.

Let me check the other options to make sure. Option A has MU_A/Price_B, which doesn't make sense because the price should correspond to the same good. So A is incorrect. Option B says all MUs are equal, which isn't necessarily true; it's the MU per dollar that matters, not the absolute MU. Option C is about the sum of MUs equalling sum of prices, which doesn't fit. D is about differences; no, that's not it. E is a product, which isn't right either. F has squared terms, which might come into play in some other concept, but not here. G is MU times price, which would be like total utility times price, but that's not the rule. I has MU over price squared, which I don't think is correct.

So J is the correct answer because it correctly states that the ratio of marginal utility to price is equal across all goods consumed.

The utility-maximizing rule states that a consumer should allocate their budget such that the marginal utility per dollar spent on each good is equal. This ensures that the last dollar spent on any good provides the same additional utility. Algebraically, this is expressed as the ratio of marginal utility to price for each good being equal. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as it incorrectly pairs marginal utilities with prices of different goods.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it suggests all marginal utilities are equal, which ignores the role of prices.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it equates the sum of marginal utilities to the sum of prices, which is unrelated to the rule.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it focuses on differences rather than ratios.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as it involves the product of marginal utilities and prices, which is not relevant.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it introduces squared terms unnecessarily.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as it equates the product of marginal utility and price, which is not the rule.  
- **Option H**: While correct for two goods, it does not extend to all goods.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as it introduces squared prices, which is not part of the rule.  
- **Option J**: Correct, as it states that the ratio of marginal utility to price is equal for all goods, aligning with the utility-maximizing rule.

Thus, the correct answer is:

J: (MU_A / Price_A) = (MU_B / Price_B) = (MU_C / Price_C) = (MU_D / Price_D)

Answer: J
