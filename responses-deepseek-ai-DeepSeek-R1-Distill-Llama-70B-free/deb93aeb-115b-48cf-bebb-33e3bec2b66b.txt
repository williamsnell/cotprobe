Okay, so I've got this question here about probability, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says, if there's a 70% chance it will rain on a given day, what's the percent chance it won't rain that same day? The options are from A to J.

Hmm, right. Probability questions can sometimes be tricky, but I think this one is pretty straightforward. I remember that probabilities are about how likely an event is to happen, and they add up to 100% for all possible outcomes. So if it's raining or not raining, those are the two possibilities, right? Unless there's something else, but in this case, I think those are the only two.

So the chance of rain is 70%. That means 70% of the time, when we consider all possible days, it rains. But the question is asking for the probability that it does not rain. So I think I need to subtract the probability of rain from 100% to get the probability of no rain.

Let me write this down. If P(Rain) is 70%, then P(Not Rain) would be 100% minus 70%, which is 30%. Wait, does that make sense? Yeah, because if it's 70% chance to rain, the remaining 30% is the chance it doesn't. So 70% + 30% equals 100%, which covers all possibilities.

Looking at the options, I need to find 30%. Let me check the options again. Option J is 30%. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes probabilities can be confusing. For example, if it's a 70% chance of rain, does that mean a 30% chance of no rain? Yes, because those are mutually exclusive events. It can't both rain and not rain on the same day. So the probabilities should add up to 100%.

Another way to think about it is, if you have a 70% chance of one event, the complementary event (the opposite) would have a probability of 1 minus 0.7, which is 0.3, or 30%.

So yes, I'm confident now. The correct answer is J: 30%.

The probability of rain is 70%, so the probability of no rain is 100% - 70% = 30%.

Answer: J
