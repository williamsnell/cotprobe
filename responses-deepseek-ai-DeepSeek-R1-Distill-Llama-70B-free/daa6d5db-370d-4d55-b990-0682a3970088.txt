Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about magnetism and solenoids. I remember from my studies that when something is uniformly magnetized, it's like having a magnet with north and south poles. The rod in question is 20 cm long, which I should convert to meters, so that's 0.2 meters.

The cross-sectional area is 10 cm². Wait, since 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², that makes the area 10e-4 m², right? So 1e-3 m²? Wait, no, wait: 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1 cm² is (0.01)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10 * 1e-4 = 1e-3 m². Got it.

The pole strength is given as 100 amp-meters. Oh wait, pole strength is usually denoted by m, and the unit is ampere-meter (A·m). So for a bar magnet, the pole strength multiplied by 2 gives the magnetic moment. Or wait, no, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = m * l, where l is the length of the magnet. Wait, no, actually, the magnetic moment is defined as μ = m * (2l), where m is the pole strength and l is the distance from the center to the pole. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, no. I think for a bar magnet, the magnetic moment μ is equal to m * (2L), where L is the length of the magnet. Because the magnet has two poles, each of strength m, separated by a distance 2L (if L is the length from the center to one end). But wait, in this problem, the rod is 20 cm long, so L is 0.1 meters, making the total length 2L. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = m * l, where l is the length of the rod.

Wait, the problem states that the pole strength is 100 amp-meters. So m = 100 A·m. So the magnetic moment μ would be m multiplied by the length of the rod? Or wait, the magnetic dipole moment μ is m times the distance between the poles. For a bar magnet of length l, the separation between the poles is approximately l. So μ = m * l.

Wait, no, I think the formula is μ = m * (2l), where l is the half-length. Because the poles are at each end, so the separation is 2l. Oh wait, the length of the rod is given as 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. So that's the full length, so the separation between poles is 0.2 m. So μ = m * separation = 100 A·m * 0.2 m? Wait, that can't be right because units would be A·m². Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, the magnetic moment's unit is A·m². Because μ = I * A * N, but wait, in the case of a bar magnet, the magnetic moment is given by μ = m * (2l), where m is the pole strength and 2l is the separation between poles. So, for a rod of length L, the separation is L, so μ = m * L.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should double-check. So, in magnetostatics, the magnetic dipole moment for a bar magnet is given by μ = m * d, where d is the distance between the poles. But for a rod of length L, the separation between the poles is approximately L, so μ = m * L. So in this case, m is 100 A·m, and L is 0.2 m.

Wait, no, wait a second. The pole strength is given as 100 amp-meters. Wait, that seems a bit off because the unit for pole strength (m) is ampere (A). Wait, wait, no. Wait, pole strength is measured in ampere-meter (A·m). Because the formula for the magnetic field at a point along the axis is B = (μ0 / 4π) * (μ / r³) * [something]. Wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the magnetic dipole moment μ is equal to the pole strength multiplied by the distance between the poles. So if the rod is length L, then the separation between the poles is L, so μ = m * L.

So given m = 100 A·m? Wait, that doesn't make sense because m (pole strength) is in A, and L is in meters. So μ would be A·m. But wait, the problem says the pole strength is 100 amp-meters. That seems confusing because that would make μ = (100 A·m) * 0.2 m = 20 A·m², which is a unit of magnetic moment. Hmm, but I think I may have made a mistake here because the units don't add up correctly.

Wait, perhaps the pole strength is in A, not A·m. Let me clarify: The correct unit for pole strength (m) is ampere (A), and the separation between the poles is in meters (m). So μ = m * d, which would have units of A·m². So in the problem, if the pole strength is 100 A·m, that's not possible because that would be A·m, but the unit for μ is A·m². So perhaps the problem actually states that the magnetic moment is 100 A·m². But the question says pole strength is 100 amp-meters. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Wait, let me read the problem again: "a pole strength of 100 amp-meters." Wait, that's not right. No, the correct term is that the magnetic dipole moment is in A·m². Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using "pole strength" to refer to the magnetic dipole moment. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think differently. The problem is in two parts: first, to find the equivalent sheet current density K' for a uniformly magnetized rod, and second, to find the current I required for a 1,000-turn solenoid of the same size to be magnetically equivalent.

Wait, so for a uniformly magnetized rod, the magnetization produces effective currents. There's the concept of bound currents in magnetism. The current density is given by K = M × n, where n is the unit normal vector. Wait, no, I think K is the surface current density, which is equal to the magnetization M crossed with the normal vector n. But since the magnetization is uniform, the surface current would be around the rod.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the magnetic dipole moment. The equivalent current for a magnetized object is such that the magnetic dipole moment equals that of the solenoid.

So, for a solenoid with N turns and current I, the magnetic moment is μ_solenoid = N I A, where A is the cross-sectional area.

In this problem, the rod has a magnetic moment μ_rod, which we need to equate to μ_solenoid.

So first, find μ_rod. Wait, but the problem gives the pole strength as 100 amp-meters. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the terminology. Alternatively, perhaps the pole strength m is given by m = μ / (2L), where L is the length. So if the rod is 0.2 meters long, then m = μ / 0.2. But if the pole strength m is given as 100 A·m, then μ = m * 0.2 = 20 A·m². Wait, but that can't be right because the units would be A·m², which is correct for μ.

Wait, no, if the pole strength is m = 100 A, then μ = m * L = 100 A * 0.2 m = 20 A·m². But the problem states that the pole strength is 100 amp-meters, so m = 100 A·m. That would make μ = m * L = 100 A·m * 0.2 m = 20 A·m², which is correct.

Wait, no, that would make μ = 20 A·m². So that's the magnetic moment.

Alternatively, perhaps the pole strength is given as m = 100 A, and L is 0.2 m, so μ = 100 * 0.2 = 20 A·m².

Wait, but the problem says the pole strength is 100 amp-meters, which would make m = 100 A·m, but that's not the correct unit. Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the term "pole strength" incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe it's the magnetic dipole moment that's 100 A·m², but the problem states it's the pole strength.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the product m * L as 100 A·m, making μ = 100 A·m².

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the given data as is. Let's assume that the magnetic dipole moment μ is 100 A·m². Wait, no, because the problem says the pole strength is 100 A·m. So perhaps the magnetic dipole moment μ is m * L, where m is the pole strength.

Wait, so if m is 100 A·m, and L is 0.2 m, then μ would be 100 * 0.2 = 20 A·m². Hmm, but then for the solenoid, μ_solenoid = N I A. So in this case, N is 1000 turns, A is 10 cm² = 1e-3 m². So μ_solenoid = 1000 * I * 1e-3 = I * 1 A·m².

Wait, but in the problem, the rod's μ is 20 A·m², so equating that to the solenoid's μ gives I = 20 A.

Wait, but let me go back. Let's see:

The problem has two parts: find K' (the equivalent sheet current density) and I (the current for the solenoid).

First, find K'. So for a uniformly magnetized rod, the equivalent current is given by a surface current. Wait, but K' is the sheet current density. The formula for sheet current density is K = M × n, where M is the magnetization and n is the unit normal vector. Since it's a rod, the magnetization is uniform and along the axis. So the surface current would circulate around the rod.

Wait, but the sheet current density K is the current per unit length. So for a rod of length L, the total current around the circumference is K * (2πr), but in terms of the cross-sectional area, perhaps it's better to think in terms of K being related to M.

Wait, I think the formula for the sheet current density K is K = M. But wait, no. The volume current density J is given by J = ∇ × M. For a uniformly magnetized rod, ∇ × M is zero in the bulk, but there are surface currents. The surface current density K is equal to M × n, where n is the outward normal.

Wait, yes, K = M × n. So for a rod, the magnetization M is in the axial direction, say along the z-axis. At the end surfaces, the normal vector is along M, so K would be zero there. But around the curved surface, the normal is radial. So M is along z, and the normal is in the radial direction, so their cross product would be in the tangential direction.

Wait, but since the cross-section is circular, the sheet current would flow in a circular path around the rod. The magnitude of K is equal to M. So K = M. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the total current I is equal to the integral of J over the area, but since J is ∇ × M, which is zero inside, the current comes from the surface.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about Ampère's circuital law. The magnetic moment of the rod is μ = M * V, where V is the volume. So V is A * L, where A is the cross-sectional area, L is the length.

Wait, yes, the magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = M * V. So M is the magnetization (A/m), because it's the magnetic moment per unit volume.

Wait, no, wait, the magnetization M is in units of A/m. So μ = M * V, and V is in m³, so μ is in A·m², which is correct.

But wait, the problem gives the pole strength, not M. Hmm, perhaps I can relate the pole strength to M. The pole strength m is related to the magnetization M. For a long rod, the surface density of poles is σ = M · n, where n is the normal. So at the end, the pole strength is σ * A, where A is the area. So m = σ * A = M * A. So M = m / A.

Wait, no, let me think again. The surface pole density σ is equal to the magnetization M. So σ = M. So at each end face of the rod, the total pole strength is m = σ * A = M * A. So M = m / A.

So if the pole strength is m = 100 A·m, then M = (100 A·m) / (1e-3 m²) ) = 100 / 1e-3 = 1e5 A/m. So M is 1e5 A/m.

Wait, but wait, the area is 10 cm² = 1e-3 m². So M = m / A = 100 / 1e-3 = 1e5 A/m.

So K' is the sheet current density. As I thought earlier, K' = M. So K' would be 1e5 A/m.

Wait, but wait, K' is the sheet current density, which is the current per unit length. So K' is measured in A/m.

Wait, but I thought K' is equal to M, which is also in A/m. So that would make K' = 1e5 A/m.

Looking at the options, let's see which one has K' as 1e5 A/m.

Looking at option B: 1e5 A/m, 20 A.

Option H: 1e5 A/m, 25 A.

Option I: 5e5 A/m, 15 A.

So possible options are B and H.

Now, the second part is to find the current I for a 1000-turn solenoid of the same size to be magnetically equivalent.

The magnetic moment of the solenoid is μ_solenoid = N I A, where N is the number of turns, I is the current, and A is the cross-sectional area.

The magnetic moment of the rod is μ_rod = M V = M A L. Since M = 1e5 A/m, A is 1e-3 m², and L is 0.2 m. So μ_rod = 1e5 * 1e-3 * 0.2 = 20 A·m².

Alternatively, since μ_rod = m * L, where m is the pole strength. Wait, earlier I thought m was 100 A·m, but then μ would be 100 * 0.2 = 20 A·m². So same result.

So setting μ_solenoid = μ_rod:

N I A = 20

Given N = 1000, A = 1e-3 m².

So I = 20 / (1000 * 1e-3) ) = 20 / 1 = 20 A.

So I is 20 A.

Looking back at the options, option B has K'=1e5 A/m and I=20 A. So that's option B.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of M. Let me go back.

Pole strength m is related to M. The formula is m = M * A. So M = m / A.

Given m = 100 A·m (but wait, this seems incorrect because the unit of m should be A, not A·m). Oh wait, perhaps the problem actually gives the magnetic dipole moment as 100 A·m², but it's stated as pole strength. That's where I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the pole strength is m = 100 A, and the length is 0.2 m, making μ = m * L = 100 * 0.2 = 20 A·m².

In that case, M = μ / V. V = A L = 1e-3 * 0.2 = 2e-4 m³.

So M = 20 / (2e-4) = 1e5 A/m.

So K' = M = 1e5 A/m.

μ_solenoid = N I A = 1000 * I * 1e-3 = I * 1 A·m².

Set equal to μ_rod (20 A·m²):

I * 1 = 20 ⇒ I=20 A.

So yes, the same as before. So option B is correct: K'=1e5 A/m, I=20 A.

Looking at the options, option B is 1e5 amp/meter, 20 amp.

To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the equivalent sheet current density \( K' \) for the uniformly magnetized rod and then determine the current \( I \) required for a 1,000-turn solenoid to be magnetically equivalent.

### Part 1: Equivalent Sheet Current Density \( K' \)

The rod has a pole strength \( m = 100 \, \text{A·m} \), a cross-sectional area \( A = 10 \, \text{cm}^2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2 \), and a length \( L = 20 \, \text{cm} = 0.2 \, \text{m} \). The magnetization \( M \) is related to the pole strength by:

\[
M = \frac{m}{A}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{100}{10^{-3}} = 10^5 \, \text{A/m}
\]

The equivalent sheet current density \( K' \) is
