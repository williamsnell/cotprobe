Okay, so I'm faced with this question about what happens to neurotransmitters after they've done their job. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my biology class that neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals across synapses. But wait, what happens after they deliver the message?

I think once a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic neuron, it can't just stay there forever. Otherwise, the signal would keep going, right? So the process must have a way to stop the signal. I remember something about the neurotransmitters being either taken back into the presynaptic neuron or broken down by enzymes.

Oh right, it's called reuptake. The presynaptic neuron sort of sucks them back in. Or sometimes enzymes in the synaptic cleft break them down. So this process deactivates them, stopping the signal. So the neurotransmitters are either taken back or destroyed.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A says they diffuse away and are exhaled. That doesn't sound right because the body doesn't typically exhale neurotransmitters. They're usually reused or broken down locally.

Option B says they're converted into cellular energy. I don't think so. Neurotransmitters are signaling molecules, not energy sources. Energy comes from breaking down glucose and other molecules, not neurotransmitters.

Option C: They replicate to enhance the signal. No, that would make the signal stronger and longer, which isn't how it works. The signal needs to be controlled and stop after a certain time.

Option D: They are destroyed. Well, some are destroyed by enzymes, but others are taken back. So this might be partially correct, but not the whole picture.

Option E: Released into bloodstream. I don't think so. The bloodstream isn't where neurotransmitters go after transmission. They stay in the synaptic cleft.

Option F: Used to build new synapses. I don't recall neurotransmitters being used for structural purposes like building synapses. They're more about signaling.

Option G: Remain active indefinitely. That would cause continuous signals, which isn't how neurons function. They need to turn signals on and off.

Option H: Stored in the cell nucleus. No, neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles in the presynaptic neuron, not the nucleus.

Option I: Deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action. This sounds familiar. Re-uptake is when the neuron takes them back, and enzymes break them down. So this would effectively deactivate them, stopping the signal.

Option J: Bond permanently to receptors. No, because if they did, the signal couldn't be stopped, leading to continuous activation, which isn't normal.

So the correct answer should be I. It combines both methods of deactivation: re-uptake and enzyme action.

The correct answer is **I: Neurotransmitters are deactivated through re-uptake or enzyme action**. Neurotransmitters are signaling molecules that transmit nerve impulses across synapses. After delivering their signal by binding to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, they must be deactivated to terminate the signal. This is achieved through two primary mechanisms: re-uptake, where the presynaptic neuron retrieves the neurotransmitters, or enzymatic degradation, where enzymes in the synaptic cleft break them down. These processes ensure that the signal is regulated and does not persist indefinitely.
