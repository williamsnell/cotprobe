Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about why some governmental regimes are reluctant to fully join the liberalist camp. The question is asking which of the options is NOT a valid reason for their reluctance. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to understand what the question is about. It's about liberalism in the context of international relations or political regimes. So, I'm thinking, what are the reasons states might not want to join the liberalist group?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The dominance of Western ideologies can be regarded as contemporary imperialism. Hmm, I remember that a lot of non-Western countries are wary of Western influence because they see it as a new form of imperialism. So this seems like a valid reason. States don't want to be dominated or lose their sovereignty to Western powers pushing their ideologies.

Option B: Liberalism advocates the enforcement of certain values that are not shared by all political regimes. Yeah, that makes sense. Liberalism promotes things like democracy, human rights, free markets, etc. But not all regimes agree with these values. For example, authoritarian regimes might see these as threats to their control. So they wouldn't want to join because they don't share those values.

Option C: The fear that cooperation may be recurring. Wait, "recurring"? That's a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo? Perhaps it means "reducing"? Like cooperation might lead to a loss of independence or autonomy. Or maybe "recurring" as in cooperation being ongoing, which could imply ongoing obligations they don't want. Alternatively, maybe "recurring" was meant to say "reducing" their sovereignty? I'm not sure. But the wording is unclear, so I need to think about what this could mean. If it's about fear that cooperation might lead to something bad recurring, like past negative experiences, that could make sense. But I'm not certain what this option is really saying.

Option D: Adherence to liberalism does not guarantee the favoured treatment of state regimes over its citizens; other states may threaten regime security in their efforts to secure societal security. Okay, so if a regime adopts liberalism, it might not protect the regime's interests because other states might prioritize their own societal security over the regime's stability. So the regime might fear that being liberal won't save them from external threats, and other states might interfere, threatening their security. That seems like a plausible reason for reluctance.

Now, the question is asking which option is NOT a valid reason. So I need to find the one that doesn't make sense as a reason for reluctance.

Looking back, Option C is a bit unclear. If it's about fear of cooperation being recurring, maybe the idea is that they don't want to get into a situation where they're forced into repeated or ongoing cooperation that they can't control. But I'm not sure if that's a common reason. Alternatively, if "recurring" is a typo for "reducing", then it would make sense as a reason. But without knowing, I have to go with what's written.

Alternatively, maybe "recurring cooperation" isn't a valid concern. Perhaps the fear is more about losing autonomy, but if they don't cooperate, they can't be forced into something they don't want. So I'm not sure how this would be a reason for reluctance. Maybe this option doesn't present a valid reason because cooperation is generally seen as beneficial, or maybe it's a non-issue compared to the other options.

Wait, another angle: the other options all touch on significant issues like imperialism, conflicting values, and security threats. Option C seems a bit vague. If "recurring" is about the cooperation happening again and again, maybe it's not a strong reason. Or perhaps the fear is that once they start cooperating, they'll be drawn into more and more, which might not be a primary concern compared to sovereignty or values.

So, putting it all together, I think Option C is the one that's not a valid reason. The other options present clear, logical reasons why a regime might be reluctant to join the liberalist camp. But Option C's wording is unclear or doesn't present a strong reason.

The question asks which option is NOT a valid reason for governmental regimes' reluctance to fully join the liberalist camp. 

- **Option A** is valid because many non-Western regimes view Western ideological dominance as a form of contemporary imperialism, threatening their sovereignty.
- **Option B** is valid as liberalism promotes values like democracy and human rights, which may conflict with authoritarian regimes' interests.
- **Option D** is valid because adopting liberalism might not protect a regime from external threats, as other states may prioritize societal security over regime stability.

**Option C**, however, is unclear and does not present a strong reason. The term "recurring" is ambiguous, and the fear of cooperation being ongoing or repeated does not align with the significant concerns like sovereignty or values that the other options address. Therefore, it is the least valid reason.
