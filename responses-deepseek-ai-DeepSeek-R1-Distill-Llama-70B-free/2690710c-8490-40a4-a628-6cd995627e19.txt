Okay, I need to find Wiley's Gum Co.'s gross profit and net income for the last week. Let me start by recalling the formulas I remember for these calculations.

First, I think gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the total revenue. But wait, I should also consider sales returns and allowances because those reduce the total revenue. So the correct formula for gross profit should be:

Gross Profit = (Sales Revenue - Sales Returns and Allowances) - COGS

Wait, no, I think it's actually:

Gross Profit = Net Sales - COGS

And Net Sales is Sales Revenue minus Sales Returns and Allowances. So yeah, that makes sense.

So the given data: Sales revenue is $16,150, and sales returns and allowances are $150. So Net Sales would be 16,150 minus 150. Let me calculate that:

16,150 - 150 = 16,000.

Then, COGS is $9,600. So Gross Profit = 16,000 - 9,600 = $6,400.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is $6,400, but I'm not sure if that's the answer because the question asks for both gross profit and net income. Wait, the question says to find both but the options are single values. Hmm, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check: Oh, wait, the question says to find their gross profit and net income for the week. But the options are single values. Maybe I'm to pick the net income, as the options don't have pairs.

Wait, perhaps the question is just looking for one of them, but the options are presented as possible values. Alternatively, maybe I need to calculate both, but the question is phrased as "find their gross profit and net income", but the options are single numbers. So perhaps I need to compute both and see which option matches one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to calculate both. Let's go step by step.

So, first, gross profit is $6,400 as I calculated. Next, to find net income, I need to subtract all the operating expenses from the gross profit.

The expenses given are:

Rent: $800

Salaries: $3,200

Utilities: $160

Miscellaneous: $575

So total operating expenses would be the sum of these.

Let me add them up:

800 + 3,200 = 4,000

4,000 + 160 = 4,160

4,160 + 575 = 4,735

So total expenses are $4,735.

Then, net income would be Gross Profit minus total expenses: 6,400 - 4,735 = ?

6,400 minus 4,735. Let's compute:

6,400 - 4,735.

Subtracting step by step:

6,400 - 4,000 = 2,400

2,400 - 735 = 1,665.

So net income is $1,665.

Wait, but let me double-check the subtraction to avoid mistakes. 4,735 from 6,400.

6,400
-4,735
=?

Starting from the right:

0 -5: Can't do that, borrow. 10-5=5.

Next digit: 0 (after borrow) becomes 9, so 9-3=6.

Next: 3 (since the 6 became 5 after borrowing) minus 7? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, 6,400 is 6 thousands, 4 hundreds, 0 tens, 0 ones.

Subtracting 4 thousands, 7 hundreds, 3 tens, 5 ones.

So 6,400 is 6.4 thousand, 4,735 is 4.735 thousand.

So 6.4 - 4.735 = 1.665, which is $1,665.

So the net income is $1,665, which corresponds to option E.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $5,765

B: $5,315

C: $16,150

D: $6,850

E: $1,665

F: $6,400

G: $7,135

H: $4,915

I: $4,735

J: $6,265

So the gross profit is $6,400 (option F) and net income is $1,665 (option E). But the question asks to find both, but the options are single answers. Hmm, perhaps the question is only asking for one of them, but the way it's phrased is to compute both. Wait, the question says "find their gross profit and net income for the week." So maybe the options include both, but perhaps the user only expects one answer. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute both and the correct choice is for the net income.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, Sales revenue is 16,150, returns 150. So net sales 16,000.

COGS 9,600. So gross profit is 16,000 -9,600=6,400 (option F).

Then, total expenses: 800+3200=4000, +160=4160, +575=4735.

So 6,400 -4,735=1,665 (option E).

Wait, but the question says "find their gross profit and net income for the week." But the options don't include pairs, so perhaps the intended answer is the net income, which is E, $1,665.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look again at the problem to see if I misread any numbers.

Wait, the sales returns and allowances are $150, correct. COGS is $9,600. Yes.

Expenses: Rent 800, Salaries 3,200, Utilities 160, Miscellaneous 575. Correct.

So the calculations seem right. So the net income is $1,665, which is option E. But the options don't list F as an option for gross profit. Wait, the options are A to J, each a single value. So perhaps the question is asking for the net income, which is E.

Wait, but in the initial part, the user says "find their gross profit and net income for the week." So perhaps the question is to report both, but the options only provide one value. Alternatively, maybe the question is a typo, and only asks for one, but the options have both.

Wait, perhaps I should look again. Let me see the options:

Option F is $6,400, which is the gross profit. Option E is $1,665, the net income. So if the question is asking for both, but the options are single, perhaps the correct answer is either F or E, depending on which part they're asking. But the question says to find both, but the options are single. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually only asking for the net income, and the initial part is just providing the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and I need to see which option matches. Since the question asks for both, but the options are single, perhaps the intended answer is the net income.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.

"Wiley's Gum Co. wishes to find their net income (or loss) for the last week. [...] Find their gross profit and net income for the week."

So the question is to compute both, but the options are single values. So perhaps the options list possible values for either, but the correct answer would be the net income. Alternatively, perhaps the options include both, but I have to select the correct one.

Wait, the options are A-J, each a single number. So perhaps the question is to select the net income, which is option E, $1,665.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the expenses. Let me check that again.

Expenses:

Rent $800

Salaries $3,200

Utilities $160

Miscellaneous $575

Adding these:

800 + 3200 = 4000

4000 + 160 = 4160

4160 + 575 = 4735.

Yes, that's correct. So total expenses $4,735.

Gross profit is 6,400.

Net income: 6,400 - 4,735 = 1,665.

So the correct net income is $1,665, which is option E.

So the answer should be E.

To determine Wiley's Gum Co.'s financial performance for the week, we calculate both **gross profit** and **net income** using the provided data.

### Step 1: Calculate Gross Profit
The formula for gross profit is:

\[
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Net Sales} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}
\]

Where:

\[
\text{Net Sales} = \text{Sales Revenue} - \text{Sales Returns and Allowances}
\]

Given:
- Sales Revenue = $16,150
- Sales Returns and Allowances = $150
- COGS = $9,600

First, calculate Net Sales:

\[
\text{Net Sales} = 16,150 - 150 = 16,000
\]

Now, calculate Gross Profit:

\[
\text{Gross Profit} = 16,000 - 9,600 = 6,400
\]

Thus, the gross profit is **$6,400**.

### Step 2: Calculate Net Income
The formula for net income is:

\[
\text{Net Income} = \text{Gross Profit} - \text{Total Operating Expenses}
\]

Given Operating Expenses:
- Rent = $800
- Salaries = $3,200
- Utilities = $160
- Miscellaneous = $575

First, calculate Total Operating Expenses:

\[
\text{Total Operating Expenses} = 800 + 3,200 + 160 + 575 = 4,735
\]

Now, calculate Net Income:

\[
\text{Net Income} = 6,400 - 4,735 = 1,665
\]

Thus, the net income is **$1,665**.

### Final Answer
The question asks for both gross profit and net income, but the options provided are single values. Since the net income is the more comprehensive measure of profitability and aligns with the options, the correct answer is:

**E: $1,665**

Answer: E
