Question:

An owner operated a successful retail business. He decided he wanted to retire and listed his business for sale. A buyer saw the listing and visited the retail business. The buyer told the owner that she was very interested in buying the business, but that she needed to get a loan from the bank to finance the purchase. The parties drafted a contract, signed by both parties, which stated that the buyer agreed to purchase the retail business from the owner for $250,000. The written agreement contained a provision wherein the sale would not take effect "unless the buyer is successful in her bid to obtain a loan from a bank to finance the purchase of the business. " Subsequently, the buyer made no effort to attempt to obtain a loan from a bank so that the sale could be finalized. After several months, the owner filed suit against the buyer for breach of contract. Which of the following will be the owner's strongest argument in support of his action against the buyer for breach of contract?

Options:

A: The buyer's lack of effort in obtaining a loan is a breach of good faith and fair dealing.
B: The buyer was under a duty to inform the owner of her decision not to seek a loan.
C: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, the condition should be excused because its non-occurrence would cause a forfeiture to the owner.
D: The owner suffered financial loss due to the buyer's inaction in seeking a loan.
E: The buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan from a bank.
F: The obtaining of a loan from a bank was not worded as a "condition" to the buyer's duty to buy the business.
G: Although obtaining a loan from a bank was a condition to the buyer's duty to buy the business, it should be stricken from the contract because it is an unconscionable term.
H: The buyer did not explicitly state in the contract that she would not seek a loan.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the scenario is that a business owner wants to retire and sells his business. A buyer comes, they both sign a contract for $250,000. But the contract has a provision that the sale won't take effect unless the buyer successfully gets a bank loan. Now, the buyer didn't even try to get the loan, and the owner is suing for breach of contract.

The question is about the owner's strongest argument. The options are A through H.

Hmm, I remember that contracts can have conditions. Conditions are events that must occur for an obligation to arise. So, in this case, the condition is the buyer getting a loan. If the condition isn't met, the contract doesn't go forward.

Wait, but what if the buyer doesn't make any effort to get the loan? Does that count as a breach? Or is it just that the condition wasn't fulfilled, so no breach?

I think there's a concept called "implied duty of good faith." Even if the contract doesn't explicitly say the buyer has to try to get the loan, they can't just sit back and do nothing if getting the loan is a condition. They have to make a reasonable effort.

Looking at the options, option E says the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain the loan. That makes sense because the contract had the condition, so the buyer can't just ignore it. They have to at least try.

Option A talks about good faith and fair dealing. I know that's a general principle, but E is more specific about the effort to obtain the loan. So E might be a stronger argument.

Option C says the condition should be excused because it causes a forfeiture. But forfeiture is more when someone loses something they gave up, like a deposit. Not sure if that applies here.

Option F says the provision wasn't worded as a condition. But the contract says the sale won't take effect unless the buyer gets the loan. That sounds like a condition to me, so F might not be correct.

So I think the owner's strongest argument is that the buyer didn't make a reasonable effort, which is an implied promise. So the answer should be E.

The strongest argument for the owner is that the buyer breached an implied promise to make a reasonable effort to obtain the loan, as the contract's condition implies such an obligation.
