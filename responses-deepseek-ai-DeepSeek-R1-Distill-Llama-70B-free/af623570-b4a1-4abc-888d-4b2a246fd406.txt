Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic induction. Hmm, let me read through it again. Alright, the question is about a square coil rotating in a magnetic field, and there are three parts to the problem. Let's break it down.

First, the given data: the coil has an area of 50 cm². Oh wait, I should convert that to m² because standard units are usually in meters. So 50 cm² is 50 * (10^-2 m)^2, which is 50 * 1e-4 = 5e-3 m². Got that.

It has 20 loops, so N is 20. The coil is rotated about a transverse axis at 2 turns per second. Wait, turns per second is the same as rotations per second, which relates to frequency. So frequency f is 2 Hz, I think. Because 2 turns per second means 2 cycles per second, so f=2 Hz.

The magnetic field is uniform with a flux density of 500 gauss. Oh, I remember that 1 tesla is 10^4 gauss. So 500 gauss is 500 / 10^4 = 0.05 tesla. So B is 0.05 T.

The coil's resistance R is 20 ohms.

The questions are (a) average emf induced in one quarter cycle, (b) average current in a complete cycle, (c) charge passed in that interval.

I think I'll tackle each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): average emf during one quarter cycle.

Wait, Faraday's Law is about induced emf. The formula is emf = -N * dΦ/dt, but here since it's rotating, the flux changes sinusoidally. For a rotating coil, the induced emf is E = N * B * A * ω * sin(ωt), but the average over a quarter cycle would be different.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of peak emf and then find the average.

Alternatively, since it's a rotating coil, the maximum emf (peak) is given by E0 = N * B * A * ω, where ω is the angular velocity.

Wait, let's compute ω first. Frequency f is 2 Hz. So ω = 2πf = 2π * 2 = 4π rad/s.

So E0 = N * B * A * ω. Plugging in the numbers: N=20, B=0.05 T, A=5e-3 m², ω=4π rad/s.

Let me calculate that: 20 * 0.05 = 1, 1 * 5e-3 = 0.005, 0.005 * 4π ≈ 0.0628 V. So E0 is approximately 0.0628 volts.

But wait, part (a) is about the average emf over a quarter cycle. Hmm, in one full cycle, the emf goes through a sine wave, varying between 0, peak, 0, -peak, 0. So a quarter cycle would be from 0 to π/2 radians (like from 0° to 90°), so the emf goes from 0 to E0.

The average value of a sinusoid over a quarter cycle (like from 0 to T/4, where T is period) can be found by integrating the function over that interval and dividing by the interval.

The function is E(t) = E0 sin(ωt). The average over 0 to T/4 (which is a quarter cycle, since the period T = 1/f = 0.5 s, so T/4 = 0.125 s).

Wait, but integrating from 0 to T/4, which is 0.125 s, but integrating from 0 to π/2 in terms of angle.

So the average would be (1/(π/2)) ∫ E0 sinθ dθ from 0 to π/2.

The integral of sinθ is -cosθ. Evaluated from 0 to π/2: (-cos(π/2)) - (-cos(0)) = 0 - (-1) = 1.

So average E_avg = (E0) * (1/(π/2)) * (1) )= (2E0)/π.

Wait, but wait: the average over a quarter cycle. Alternatively, for a sine wave, the average over a quarter cycle (where it goes from 0 to peak) is 2E0/π. Because the average of a sine from 0 to π/2 is (2/π) E0.

So the average emf for a quarter cycle would be (2/π)*E0.

Plugging in E0 ≈0.0628 V: (2/3.1416)*0.0628 ≈ (0.6366) * 0.0628 ≈ 0.04 V. So approximately 0.04 volts.

Wait, but let me recalculate E0 more accurately. Let me compute N*B*A*ω.

N=20, B=0.05, A=5e-3, ω=4π.

So 20 * 0.05 = 1. 1 * 5e-3 = 0.005. 0.005 *4π ≈ 0.06283185 V. So E0 ≈ 0.06283 V.

Then average is (2/π)*0.06283 ≈ 0.04 V.

So part (a) would be 0.04 volts.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says 0.04 V, 0.002 A, 0.00025 C. Option G is 0.04 V, 0.002 A, 0.00020 C. Option B is 0.05 V. Hmm, so part (a) seems to be 0.04.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes the average is computed differently. Alternatively, the maximum emf E_max would be NABω, which is the same as E0. So E_max is about 0.0628 V.

But the average over one quarter cycle (like from 0 to π/2) is 2E_max/π. So yes, that's what I did earlier.

So (a) is 0.04 V.

Moving to part (b): average current in a complete cycle.

Well, the emf in a complete cycle varies sinusoidally. The average emf over a full cycle is zero because it's symmetric. But wait, that can't be right, because when calculating current, we have to think about the rms values perhaps.

Wait, no. Because the question is about the average current over a complete cycle. But the induced emf alternates, so the current alternates as well. The average current over a full cycle would be zero, because for every positive half-cycle, there's a corresponding negative half-cycle.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options don't have zero for current. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, maybe they're considering the average absolute value of the current, but that's not standard. Or perhaps it's the rms current, but the options don't specify.

Wait, the question says: (b) What is the average current in a complete cycle?

Hmm. So average current would be zero, but perhaps that's not the intended answer. Or perhaps the question is about the average of the absolute value, but that would be different.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since the current alternates, the average over a full cycle is zero. But perhaps the question is referring to the average of the induced emf, and then using Ohm's law to find current.

Wait, no, for part (b), it's about the current. So perhaps I should compute the rms emf, then compute Irms = rms emf / R.

Wait, but the question says "average current", which usually refers to the mean over time. For a sinusoidal current, the average over a full cycle is zero. But that's probably not the intended answer here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the average of the absolute value of the current over the cycle, which would be the average of |I(t)| over a full cycle. That's different.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's think differently.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the average in terms of the peak values. So when the coil rotates, the current alternates, and the average current over a full cycle is zero. But that's not helpful. So perhaps the intended approach is to compute the rms current.

So for a sinusoidal current, the rms value is Irms = I_peak / sqrt(2).

But the question is about average current, which for a full cycle, the average of I(t) is zero. But perhaps the question is not considering direction, so perhaps it's referring to the average absolute value.

Wait, the problem says "average current in a complete cycle". Oh, the term "average" here is ambiguous, but in physics, average usually refers to the mean, which would be zero. But that can't be, because none of the options have zero current.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe part (b) is about the average of the absolute value of the current over a cycle.

Wait, but the options for part (b) are in the milliampere range. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the maximum current and then compute the average.

Wait, let's see. The maximum emf is E0 = ~0.0628 V. Then maximum current I_max = E0 / R = 0.0628 / 20 = 0.00314 A, approximately 3.14 mA.

The average current over a full cycle being zero, but maybe the problem is considering the average of the absolute value, which would be (2 I_max)/π ≈ (2 * 0.00314) / 3.1416 ≈ 0.002 A, which is 2 mA.

Looking back at the options, option C and G have 0.002 A for part (b). So part (b)'s answer is 0.002 A.

Now, part (c): How much charge is passed through the coil in this interval?

Wait, the interval is a quarter cycle? Or a complete cycle? The question says (c) "in this interval", which I think refers to the same interval as part (a) and (b), but part (b) is about a complete cycle. Wait, let me recheck the question. 

The original question says:

(a) What is the average electromotive force induced in the coil during one quarter cycle of a revolution?

(b) What is the average current in a complete cycle?

(c) How much charge is passed through the coil in this interval?

So part (c)'s interval is the same as part (b), which is a complete cycle. So the time interval is the period T = 1/f = 0.5 seconds.

Wait, but the charge passed would be the integral of current over time. Since the current is sinusoidal, the integral over a full cycle is zero. But that can't be right, because charge can't be zero. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Wait, the current alternates direction, so the net charge flow (positive charge moving one way, then the same amount the other way) would be zero over a full cycle. But that would imply that no net charge is transferred, but the question is about "charge passed through the coil", which might refer to the total charge movement, regardless of direction.

Wait, but that's not how charge is measured. Charge is a scalar quantity, so total charge passed would be the sum of the absolute values. Or, perhaps, the question is referring to the charge moved in each half cycle, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the average current and then computing charge as I_avg * time.

But earlier, I thought the average current over a cycle is zero. But if the absolute average is considered, then I_avg_abs = (2 I_max)/π. So I_avg_abs = (2 * 0.00314)/3.1416 ≈ 0.002 A.

Then, the charge Q = I_avg_abs * T. T is 0.5 s.

So Q ≈ 0.002 A * 0.5 s = 0.001 C, or 1 milliCoulomb. But looking at the options, none of them have 0.001 C for part (c). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps the charge is calculated using the average current over a quarter cycle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the approach is different.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total charge moved during a quarter cycle. But the question for part (c) refers to the same interval as part (b), which is a complete cycle.

Wait, no, the question says part (c) is about "this interval". Let's recheck the question:

"(a) What is the average electromotive force induced in the coil during one quarter cycle of a revolution? (b) What is the average current in a complete cycle? (c) How much charge is passed through the coil in this interval?"

Ah, so (c) is in the same interval as (b), which is a complete cycle. So the time is T = 1/f = 0.5 s.

But current is varying sinusoidally, so the charge passed would be the integral of I(t) over T. Since I(t) is sinusoidal and symmetric, the integral over a full cycle is zero. That's confusing because it would imply zero charge, but that doesn't make sense physically.

Wait, but maybe the question is considering the total charge transported in one direction during the cycle, but that would be twice the charge in a half cycle.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the charge that flows during the time the current is in one direction, but that's just a half cycle.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently. Maybe the charge is calculated from the average current times the time period.

Wait, but average current over a full cycle is zero. So that would give zero charge, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the maximum current and calculating the charge as the maximum current times the time for a quarter cycle. But that doesn't fit either.

Wait, another approach. The charge passed through the coil would be the integral of the current over time. I(t) = I_max sin(ωt). So over a full cycle, the integral is zero. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the charge in a quarter cycle. But part (c) refers to a complete cycle. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the charge is calculated using the average current from part (b) multiplied by the time period. But part (b)'s current is 0.002 A.

Wait, part (b) is 0.002 A, and the time is T=0.5 s. So Q = I_avg * T = 0.002 A * 0.5 s = 0.001 C.

But looking at the options, option C has 0.00025 C, G has 0.00020 C, etc. Hmm, none match 0.001 C.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong current. Let me try again.

Wait, the average current in a complete cycle is zero, but perhaps the question is referring to the average absolute current, which is (2 I_max)/π. So I_avg_abs = 0.002 A. Then, over a full cycle (T=0.5 s), the charge is 0.002 * 0.5 = 0.001 C, but none of the options have this. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the charge is calculated for a quarter cycle. If the average current in a quarter cycle is I_avg_quarter = (2 I_max)/π. Then time is T/4 = 0.125 s. So Q = I_avg_quarter * T/4.

So for part (a), I_avg_quarter = 0.04 V / 20 Ω = 0.002 A. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up.

Wait, no, part (a) is the average emf, and the current would be V/R. So for part (a), average emf is 0.04 V, so average current is 0.04 / 20 = 0.002 A. Then, over a quarter cycle, which is 0.125 s, the charge would be I * t = 0.002 * 0.125 = 0.00025 C. So 0.00025 C.

Wait, but part (c) is about the same interval as part (b), which is a complete cycle. So perhaps I'm getting confused between the intervals.

Alternatively, perhaps part (c) is about a quarter cycle as well. Let me read the question again.

Wait the question says:

(a) average emf during one quarter cycle.

(b) average current in a complete cycle.

(c) charge passed in this interval. The "this" likely refers to the same interval as part (b), which is a complete cycle.

Wait, but I'm stuck on part (c). Let's think differently.

The charge Q is the integral of I(t) dt over the interval.

For a complete cycle, I(t) is sinusoidal, so the integral is zero.

But that can't be, so perhaps the question is considering the total charge transported in one direction, which would be twice the charge in a half cycle.

In a half cycle, the charge is Q = integral from 0 to T/2 of I_max sin(ωt) dt.

Integral of sin(ωt) is -(1/ω) cos(ωt). Evaluated from 0 to T/2 (which is π/ω).

So Q = I_max * [ -(1/ω) cos(ωt) ] from 0 to π/ω.

At π/ω: cos(π) = -1.

At 0: cos(0) = 1.

So Q = I_max * [ -(1/ω)(-1 - 1) ] = I_max * (2/ω).

But ω = 2π f = 4π rad/s.

So Q = I_max * (2)/(4π) )= I_max/(2π).

I_max is 0.00314 A.

So Q = 0.00314 / (6.2832) ≈ 0.0005 C.

Wait, but that's for a half cycle. So in a full cycle, the charge in each direction is 0.0005 C, so total charge would be 0.001 C, but that's not matching any options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total charge as twice the charge in a half cycle, but that gives 0.001 C, which again isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps part (c) refers to the charge moved in a quarter cycle.

In part (a),
