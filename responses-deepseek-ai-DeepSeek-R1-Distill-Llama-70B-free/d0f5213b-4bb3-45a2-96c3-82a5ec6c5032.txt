Question:

A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the office by his mother because of a 2-day history of white lesions in the mouth. The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Fluconazole
B: Valacyclovir
C: Ketoconazole
D: Acyclovir
E: Miconazole
F: Amphotericin B
G: Terbinafine
H: Clotrimazole
I: Nystatin
J: Voriconazole

Okay, so I've got this question about a 3-week-old infant with white lesions in his mouth. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the baby is 3 weeks old and was born at term, so he's a newborn, right? The mother noticed these white patches for two days. They’re on the tongue and buccal mucosa. When the doctor tried to scrape them off with a tongue blade, they didn't come off. Hmm, that makes me think about possible infections or conditions that cause such symptoms.

I remember that in infants, oral thrush is pretty common. Thrush is a yeast infection caused by Candida, usually Candida albicans. It presents as white patches that can't be easily wiped away. So that seems to fit here. 

Now, I need to think about the treatment options. The question is asking for the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Let's look at the options given.

Option A: Fluconazole. That's an antifungal, but it's usually given orally or IV. It's used for systemic or more severe cases, maybe not the first choice for oral thrush in infants.

Option B: Valacyclovir. That's an antiviral, used for herpes simplex virus, not yeast, so probably not the right choice here.

Option C: Ketoconazole. Another antifungal, but I think it's not commonly used in infants due to potential side effects, especially liver issues. Plus, it's usually not the first line for oral thrush.

Option D: Acyclovir. Also an antiviral, so same as B, probably not needed here.

Option E: Miconazole. That’s an antifungal, but I think it's available in forms like creams or gels. It's used for oral thrush but maybe more commonly in adults. I'm not sure if it's used in infants.

Option F: Amphotericin B. That's a strong antifungal, typically for serious infections, probably not needed here since the baby seems otherwise healthy.

Option G: Terbinafine. That's used for fungal infections like ringworm, but more for skin infections, not oral, and not typically first-line for thrush.

Option H: Clotrimazole. Another antifungal, comes in lozenges or troches for oral use. It's used for thrush, but again, I'm not sure about its use in infants.

Option I: Nystatin. Oh right, nystatin is a common treatment for oral thrush in infants. It’s available as an oral suspension that you swish around the mouth and then swallow. It's safe for newborns and is often the first-line treatment.

Option J: Voriconazole. That's a broad-spectrum antifungal but usually reserved for more resistant or severe cases, not typically first-line for oral thrush.

So putting it all together, the baby has oral thrush, and the best treatment among the options is Nystatin. So the answer should be option I.

The infant presents with white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not scrape off, which is characteristic of oral thrush caused by Candida albicans. Among the treatment options, nystatin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy as it is specifically indicated for oral thrush in infants and is available as a safe and effective oral suspension.

Answer: I
