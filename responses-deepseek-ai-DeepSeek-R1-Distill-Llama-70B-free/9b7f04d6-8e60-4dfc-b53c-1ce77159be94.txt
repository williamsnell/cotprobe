Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about the Harbor Lights Boat Company loaning an employee $3,000. I need to figure out the number of days for the interest, the amount of interest, and the total amount the company received. Let's take it step by step.

First, part a asks for the number of days the interest will be charged. The loan was made on September 16 and repaid on October 31. I remember that when calculating days between dates, I should count each month's days and be careful with inclusive counting. Also, September has 30 days, right?

So from September 16 to September 30: That's (30 - 16) = 14 days. Wait, no, because if you include the 16th as day 0, then from the 16th to the 30th is 15 days because you add 1. Let me think: if I start counting on the 16th as day 1, then 16-30 is 15 days. Because 30-16=14, then add 1 to include both start and end, so 15 days in September.

Then, from October 1 to October 31 is 31 days. So total days would be 15 + 31 = 46 days. Hmm, looking at the options, option D says 46 days, so that's part a done.

Next, part b is calculating the interest. The interest rate is 9 and a half percent, which is 9.5%. The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where P is principal, R is rate, T is time in years. But wait, the time here is in days. So I need to convert days into years.

Wait, the options have amounts like $45.63, $33.12, etc. Let me think about how to compute this. The rate is 9.5% per annum. So per day, the rate would be 9.5% divided by 365 days. So R = 0.095 / 365.

So I = 3000 * (0.095 / 365) * 46.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate 0.095 divided by 365. Let me see:

0.095 / 365 = approximately 0.000260274.

Then multiply by 46 days: 0.000260274 * 46 ≈ 0.0119816.

Then multiply by 3000: 3000 * 0.0119816 ≈ 35.9448. Wait, that's around $35.94. But looking at the options, option F has $35.63, option I is $40.63, and option D is $34.59.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Another approach: 9.5% annually is 0.095. For 46 days, the fraction of the year is 46/365. So:

I = 3000 * 0.095 * (46/365)

Compute 0.095 * 46 = 4.37.

Then 4.37 / 365 = approximately 0.0119818.

Multiply by 3000: 3000 * 0.0119818 ≈ 35.945. So about $35.95. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option F: $35.63, option D: $34.59. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days. Wait, I thought it was 46 days. Let me recheck the days.

September 16 to September 30: Let's recount. September has 30 days. So from the 16th to the 30th inclusive is:

30 - 16 = 14 days, but including both the 16th and 30th, that's 15 days. Then October 1 to 31 is 31 days. 15 + 31 = 46 days total. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated differently, like using 360 days a year instead of 365? Some financial calculations use 360 for simplicity. Let me try that.

So, 46/360 = 0.127777...

3000 * 0.095 = 285. Then 285 * (46/360) = 285 * 0.127777... Let's compute that:

285 * 0.127777 is approximately 285 * 0.1278 = 285 * 0.1 is 28.5, 285 * 0.0278 is approx 7.911. So total around 36.411, so about $36.41. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Alternative approach: 9.5% per year is 0.095. So per day, it's 0.095/365. Multiply by 46 days: 46 * 0.095 = 4.37, divided by 365: 4.37 / 365 = 0.0119818. So 3000 * 0.0119818 = 35.9454, which is approximately $35.95, but none of the options have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option F: $35.63, which is close but not exact.

Option D: $34.59.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the days? Let me recount the days again. Wait, September 16 to October 31.

Wait, September 16 to September 30 is 15 days (including the 16th and 30th). Then October has 31 days, but wait, the loan was repaid on October 31, so from October 1 to October 31 is 31 days. So total 15 + 31 = 46 days. That's correct.

Wait another thought: Maybe the interest is calculated based on the exact number of days between the two dates, not assuming the full days. But I think that for such calculations, each day is considered a full day.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is computed using a 360-day year. Let me try that.

So, 46 days in a 360-day year. So 46/360 = 0.127777...

Then, 3000 * 0.095 * 0.127777 = ?

0.095 * 0.127777 = 0.0121445.

3000 * 0.0121445 = 36.4335, about $36.43. Still not matching any options exactly.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the options. The options for part b are:

A: $45.63
B: $33.12
C: $47.50
D: $34.59
E: $26.56
F: $35.63
G: $28.75
H: $42.19
I: $40.63
J: $25.63

Hmm, option F is $35.63, which is close to my initial calculation of $35.95. But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated as (P × R × T)/100.

Wait, let me compute 3000 × 9.5% × (46/365).

So 9.5% is 9.5/100 = 0.095.

So 3000 × 0.095 × (46/365) = ?

Compute step by step.

3000 * 0.095 = 285.

Then 285 * (46/365) = ?

46 divided by 365 is approximately 0.12597.

So 285 * 0.12597 ≈ 35.904. So approximately $35.90.

Looking at the options, F is $35.63, which is close. But none match exactly. Wait, perhaps there's a different way to calculate the days.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the days more accurately, considering that September 16 to October 31 is 45 days, not 46? Let me recount.

Wait, September has 30 days. So from September 16 (inclusive) to September 30 is 30-16+1=15 days. Then from October 1 to October 31 is 31 days. So 15+31=46 days.

Wait, unless the end date is not inclusive. Oh wait, the repayment is on October 31, so perhaps that day is not counted. So the period is from September 16 to October 30, which would be 45 days?

Let me see: From September 16 to September 30: 15 days. Then October 1 to October 30: 30 days. So 15+30=45 days. That would make the days 45.

If that's the case, then the interest is calculated on 45 days. Let me recalculate.

I = 3000 * 0.095 * (45/365)

Compute 45/365 ≈ 0.12328767.

Then 0.095 * 0.12328767 ≈ 0.011725.

3000 * 0.011725 = 35.175, which is approximately $35.18. But that's still not matching any options.

Alternatively, if using 360 days:

45/360 = 0.125.

3000 * 0.095 = 285.

285 * 0.125 = 35.625, which is $35.63, which matches option F's $35.63. So if the days are 45, then the interest is $35.63.

But earlier, I thought the days were 46. So why the discrepancy? Let me check the dates again.

If the loan was made on September 16 and repaid on October 31, the period is from the 16th to the 31st, inclusive?

Wait, when you take a loan on day 0, you start accruing interest from day 0. So the time period is the number of days from September 16 to October 31, including both days? Or is it exclusive of the end date?

In financial calculations, typically, the end date is not counted. So if you repay on October 31, that day's interest is not charged. So the period is from September 16 to October 30, which is 45 days.

Wait, let me compute that.

September 16 to September 30: 15 days (16th to 30th inclusive).

Then October 1 to October 30: 30 days.

So 15 + 30 = 45 days.

So that's 45 days. So part a would be 45 days, which is present in options F, H, I.

So part a is 45 days, not 46. So that changes things.

So part a: 45 days.

Part b: I = 3000 * 0.095 * (45/365).

Compute 3000 * 0.095 = 285.

45/365 is approximately 0.12328767.

285 * 0.12328767 ≈ let's compute this.

0.12328767 * 285:

0.1 * 285 = 28.5

0.02 *285=5.7 → 28.5+5.7=34.2

0.00328767 *285 ≈ 0.938. So total approx 34.2 + 0.938 = 35.138. So around $35.14.

But wait, perhaps more accurately:

45/365 = 0.12328767.

Multiply 285 by 0.12328767:

285 * 0.12328767 = (let me compute 285 * 12328767e-8).

But perhaps an exact calculation:

(45/365) = 9/73.

So 285 * 9/73 = (285 *9) /73.

285 *9=2565.

2565 /73 = let's compute that.

73 *35=2555 (since 73*30=2190, 73*5=365 → 2190+365=2555). So 2565-2555=10. So 35 + 10/73 = 35.136986...

So 35.136986, which is approximately $35.14.

But the option F says $35.63, which is higher. So perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps using 360 days instead of 365. So 45/360=0.125.

So I = 3000 * 0.095 * 0.125.

0.095 * 0.125 = 0.011875.

3000 * 0.011875 = 35.625, which is $35.63.

Ah, so that's matching option F. So if the company uses a 360-day year for calculation, that would make the interest $35.63.

So part a is 45 days, part b is $35.63. So part c, the total amount would be 3000 + 35.63 = $3035.63. Looking at the options, option F is 45 days, $35.63, total $3035.63.

Wait, but earlier I thought the days might be 46. Let me make sure.

If the loan was made on September 16 and repaid on October 31, that's a total of 46 days if you count both days. But in loan calculations, sometimes the day of repayment isn't counted. So if you take out a loan on day 0, you pay interest up to but not including the day you repay. So the period is from the 16th to the 30th of September (15 days) plus October 1 to 31 (31 days), but wait, no, that would be 46 days. Alternatively, if the 31st is the day you repay, you don't count that day. So from the 16th to the 30th September (15 days) plus October 1-30 (30 days) = 45 days.

So the correct number of days is 45, so part a is 45 days, which is in option F. Then the interest is $35.63, making the total $3035.63.

Looking back at the options:

Option F: 45 days, $35.63, $3,035.63.

Yes, that matches.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of days the interest is charged, calculate the interest amount, and find the total amount repaid by the employee.

### Part (a): Number of Days
The loan was made on September 16 and repaid on October 31. To calculate the number of days:

1. **September 16 to September 30**: September has 30 days, so the number of days from September 16 to September 30 is:
   \[
   30 - 16 + 1 = 15 \, \text{days}.
   \]

2. **October 1 to October 31**: October has 31 days, so the number of days from October 1 to October 31 is:
   \[
   31 \, \text{days}.
   \]

3. **Total Days**: Adding these together gives:
   \[
   15 + 31 = 46 \, \text{days}.
   \]

However, in financial calculations, the repayment date (October 31) is typically not included in the interest calculation. Therefore, the correct number of days is:
\[
15 + 30 = 45 \, \text{days}.
\]

### Part (b): Interest Calculation
The interest rate is \(9.5\%\), and the principal amount is $3,000. Using the simple interest formula:
\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T,
\]
where \(P = 3000\), \(R = 0.095\), and \(T = \frac{45}{365}\) (since the calculation uses a 365-day year).

1. Convert the time period to a fraction of the year:
   \[
   T = \frac{45}{365} \approx 0.12328767.
   \]

2. Calculate the interest:
   \[
   I = 3000 \cdot 0.095 \cdot 0.12328767 \approx 35.14.
   \]

If a 360-day year is used instead (common in financial calculations), then:
\[
T = \frac{45}{360} = 0.125,
\]
and the interest becomes:
\[
I = 3000 \cdot 0.095 \cdot 0.125 = 35.625 \, \text{or} \, 35.63.
\]

Thus, the interest amount is approximately **$35.63**.

### Part (c): Total Amount Repaid
The total amount repaid is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = 3000 + 35.63 = 3035.63.
\]

### Final Answer
The correct option is:
- **45 days** for the interest period,
- **$35.63** for the interest amount,
- **$3,035.63** as the total amount repaid.

This matches **Option F**.

**Answer: F**
