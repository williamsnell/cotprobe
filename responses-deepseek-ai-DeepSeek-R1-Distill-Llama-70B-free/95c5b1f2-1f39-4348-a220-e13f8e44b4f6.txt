Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about the diffusion coefficient of a t-RNA molecule in the cell interior. The given D is 1.0 × 10^-11 m²/s. The question is asking how long it takes for these molecules to reach the cell walls, given that the distance is 1.0 micrometer, which is the radius of the cell.

Hmm, I remember that diffusion time can be calculated using some formula. I think it's related to the diffusion coefficient and the distance. Oh right, the formula for the time it takes for a substance to diffuse over a certain distance is probably the one I need here.

Wait, the formula I remember is something like time t equals distance squared divided by the diffusion coefficient multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, no, the exact formula is t = x²/(2D), or maybe x²/(6D), depending on the model. Wait, I'm a bit confused. 

I think for one-dimensional diffusion, the average time for a molecule to travel a distance x is proportional to x squared divided by the diffusion coefficient. But I'm not exactly sure about the constant factor. Let me think. Oh right, Einstein's relation for diffusion comes into play here. The equation for the mean square displacement is <x²> = 2 D t. So solving for time t would give t = <x²>/(2D). But wait, if the displacement is x, then t = x²/(2D). So that's the formula I should use.

So the distance x here is 1.0 micrometer. Wait, but I need to convert that into meters because the units are in meters squared per second. Oh right, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So x squared would be (1e-6 m)^2 = 1e-12 m².

So plugging into the formula, t = (1e-12) / (2 * 1e-11). Let me compute that. The denominator is 2e-11. So 1e-12 divided by 2e-11 is (1/2) * (1e-12 / 1e-11). 1e-12 over 1e-11 is 0.1, so 0.1 divided by 2 is 0.05 seconds. Wait, 0.05 seconds is 5e-2 seconds. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5.5e-2 s, which is 0.055. Hmm, but my calculation gave 0.05, which is 5e-2. So is there something wrong here? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, wait. Another thought: maybe the model assumes the time is for the root mean squared displacement, but in reality, when considering the time to reach a certain point, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses x squared over (6D) or something else.

Wait, I should double-check the correct formula. Oh, I think the formula I used is correct for the mean square displacement in one dimension, but perhaps the problem is assuming movement in three dimensions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the radius as the distance, and since the cell is spherical, maybe the model is a bit different. But wait, the question says the distance is 1.0 micrometer, which is the radius, so I think treating it as a one-dimensional problem is acceptable for this approximation.

Wait, let me recalculate. Let me recheck my steps.

x is 1.0 micrometer, which is 1e-6 meters. So x squared is (1e-6)^2 = 1e-12 m².

D is 1e-11 m²/s.

So t = x²/(2D) = (1e-12) / (2e-11) = (1e-12)/(2e-11) = 1/(2e1) )? Wait, no, wait: 1e-12 divided by 2e-11 is equal to (1e-12) / (2e-11) = (1/2) * (1e-12 / 1e-11) )= 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 seconds, which is 5e-2 s.

Looking back at the options, I don't see an option that's exactly 5e-2. Wait, let me check again.

Option C is 5.5e-2, which is 0.055 s.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses a different factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the radius as the distance, and since the cell is a sphere, the average time might be different. Or maybe the formula uses a factor of 6, like in three dimensions.

Wait, the mean square displacement in three dimensions is <r²> = 6 D t. So if the displacement is r, then r squared equals 6 D t. So solving for t would give t = r²/(6 D).

Wait, that's a different factor. So let me try that approach.

So if I use this formula, t = (1e-6)^2 / (6 * 1e-11) = (1e-12) / (6e-11) = (1e-12) / (6e-11) = (1/6) * (1e-12 / 1e-11) ) = (1/6) * 0.1 = 0.1/6 ≈ 0.016666... seconds, which is about 1.666e-2 s.

Wait, that's approximately 0.0167 s, which is 1.67e-2 s. Looking back at the options, option D is 1.7e-2 s, which is 0.017 s. So that's option D.

But wait, why the discrepancy between the two approaches? Because the first approach assumes one-dimensional motion (t = x²/(2D)), and the second assumes three-dimensional (t = x²/(6D)).

So which one should I use here? Hmm.

The problem states that the molecules are produced in the cell nucleus and have to reach the cell walls, which are at a distance equal to the cell radius. So perhaps we can model this as movement from the center to the periphery, which is a one-dimensional problem. Alternatively, since molecules can move in all directions, perhaps it's a three-dimensional problem, but only considering the radial component.

But I'm a bit confused about which model to apply. Let me think about how the mean square displacement works.

In one dimension, <x²> = 2 D t.

In three dimensions, <r²> = 6 D t.

But in our case, the displacement is along a straight line from the nucleus to the cell wall, so perhaps it's a 1D problem, and I should use the 2D factor. But wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the time taken for a molecule to diffuse a certain distance is given by the formula t = x²/(2D). That's the formula I remember from the one-dimensional case.

But if the molecules are moving in three dimensions, the average distance they travel in any particular direction (like from nucleus to cell wall) would be less, so maybe the formula uses a different factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula t = (x^2) / (6D). I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me check a source or my notes. Oh wait, in my notes, the formula for the time to diffuse a distance x is approximately t ≈ x²/(2D). But for a sphere of radius r, the characteristic diffusion time is r²/(6D). Wait, that's a different scenario.

So perhaps the correct formula to use here is t = x²/(2D), which would give 5e-2 s, but that's not an option. Alternatively, if it's 6D, then it gives 1.67e-2 s, which is option D.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results based on which formula I use. I need to figure out which is the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the root mean square (rms) displacement. The rms displacement in one dimension is sqrt(2Dt). So if the molecule needs to go a distance x, then the time taken would be when the rms displacement equals x. So sqrt(2Dt) = x → t = x²/(2D).

So in this case, x is 1e-6 m. So t = (1e-6)^2 / (2 * 1e-11) = 1e-12 / 2e-11 = 0.05 seconds, which is 5e-2 s.

But looking at the options, option C is 5.5e-2 s, which is close but not exactly 5e-2. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recalculate that. 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. Divided by (2 * 1e-11) is 2e-11. So 1e-12 / 2e-11 = (1e-12)/(2e-11) = (1 / 2) * (1e-12 / 1e-11) ) → 1e-12 is 0.1e-11, so 0.1e-11 / 2e-11 = 0.05 s.

So that's 0.05 s, which is 5e-2 s. But the options don't have this exact value. The closest is option C, which is 5.5e-2 s. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the distance is given as 1.0 micrometer, but I should consider that the nucleus is at the center of the cell, and the cell wall is at radius r, so the distance to travel is r. So the calculation I did should be correct.

Wait, but maybe I should account for something else, like the actual path the molecules take, which isn't straight line. Oh, but that's already accounted for in the diffusion coefficient, I think.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the mean time for the molecule to reach the wall, which might involve a different formula, perhaps involving the inverse of the diffusion coefficient and the square of the distance, but with a different factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula used is t = x²/(4D), but I can't recall. Let me see: in one dimension, the solution to the diffusion equation gives the probability distribution, and the mean square displacement is 2Dt. So to reach a distance x, I think the time would be when the rms displacement equals x, so t = x²/(2D).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different model, such as the approximate time to traverse a certain distance, which might involve a factor of 6 in the denominator, as I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider the formula for diffusion time in terms of the cell's radius.

I recall that the time for a molecule to diffuse from the center to the periphery of a spherical cell can be estimated using t = r²/(6D). So in that case, substituting r = 1e-6 m, D = 1e-11 m²/s, then t = (1e-6)^2/(6 * 1e-11) = 1e-12/(6e-11) ≈ 1.666e-2 s, which is approximately 0.0167 s, or 1.7e-2 s, which matches option D.

So maybe the correct formula to use here is t = r²/(6D), which gives option D as the answer.

But why the factor of 6 here? Oh, because in three dimensions, the mean square displacement is 6Dt, so if the displacement is r, then r² = 6Dt → t = r²/(6D).

Ah, so that's the correct approach. So the time is r squared divided by (6 times D).

So substituting the numbers: (1e-6)^2 = 1e-12 m². 6D is 6 * 1e-11 = 6e-11 m²/s.

So 1e-12 / 6e-11 = (1 / 6) * (1e-12 / 1e-11) ) → 1e-12 is 0.1e-11, so 0.1e-11 / 6e-11 = 0.1/6 ≈ 0.016666..., which is 1.666e-2 seconds.

Looking back at the options, D is 1.7e-2, which matches this calculation.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought the one-dimensional formula gave 5e-2 s, which is not an option. So maybe the correct approach is to model it as three-dimensional, giving option D.

I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be D.

To determine how long it takes for t-RNA molecules to diffuse from the cell nucleus to the cell wall, we use the diffusion equation. The problem specifies a diffusion coefficient \( D = 1.0 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m}^2 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \) and a distance \( x = 1.0 \, \mu\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m} \). 

For diffusion in three dimensions, the mean square displacement is given by:

\[
\langle r^2 \rangle = 6Dt
\]

Rearranging for \( t \), the time to diffuse a distance \( r \) is:

\[
t = \frac{r^2}{6D}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
t = \frac{(1.0 \times 10^{-6})^2}{6 \times 1.0 \times 10^{-11}}
\]

First, calculate \( r^2 \):

\[
r^2 = (1.0 \times 10^{-6})^2 = 1.0 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

Next, calculate \( 6D \):

\[
6D = 6 \times 1.0 \times 10^{-11} = 6.0 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m}^2 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}
\]

Now divide:

\[
t = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-12}}{6.0 \times 10^{-11}} = \frac{1.0}{6.0} \times 10^{-1} \approx 0.1667 \, \mathrm{s}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
t \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is:

**D: \( 1.7 \times 10^{-2} \, \mathrm{s} \)**

This calculation assumes three-dimensional diffusion, which is appropriate for molecules moving through the cell interior. The factor of 6 in the denominator accounts for the three-dimensional nature of the problem, as opposed to one-dimensional diffusion, which would use a factor of 2.
