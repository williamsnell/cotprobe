Okay, so I've got this question about genetics, and I need to figure out the right answer. The question is asking about the coding sequences of genes, and what they're called. The options are from A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that genes are made up of DNA, and they have coding and non-coding regions. The coding parts are the ones that actually code for proteins. Wait, but what are those called again? Oh right, I think it's exons. Or was it introns? No wait, introns are the non-coding parts that get spliced out. So exons are the parts that remain and are part of the mRNA after splicing. So the coding sequences would be exons.

Let me go through the options to make sure. Option A is extrons. Hmm, I don't think I've heard that term. Maybe it's a typo for exons or introns. B is nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, but that's too general. The question is about gene parts, not the basic units.

Option C is promoters. Promoters are regions where transcription starts, they help RNA polymerase bind. But they aren't coding sequences; they're regulatory. So not the answer.

D is anticodons. Anticodons are on tRNA molecules, pairing with mRNA codons during translation. Not part of the gene's structure itself. So D is out.

E is genomes. The genome is the entire set of DNA in an organism. Way too broad. The question is about specific parts of genes.

F is operons. Operons are clusters of genes under a single promoter, mainly in prokaryotes. But again, it's a larger structure, not the coding sequences within a single gene.

G is codons. Codons are sequences of three nucleotides on mRNA that code for amino acids. But the question is about the gene's coding sequences, which are on DNA. So the gene has codons in the sense that they're in the mRNA, but the DNA sequences are called exons. Hmm, perhaps I should think again. No, wait, the DNA has exons, which are transcribed into mRNA, which then have codons. So the coding sequences in the gene are exons.

H is alleles, which are different forms of the same gene. Not relevant here.

I is exons. Yes, that matches what I was thinking earlier. Exons are the coding parts of a gene.

J is introns, which are the non-coding parts. So the opposite of what we're looking for.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: exons.

The coding sequences of genes are the regions that are transcribed into mRNA and contribute to the protein product. These regions are called **exons**. Exons are the parts of a gene that remain after the non-coding introns have been spliced out during RNA processing. Among the given options, "exons" correctly identifies the coding sequences of genes.
