Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with remainders and reversions. Hmm, I remember that in property law, when a grantor creates a future interest, there are different types like remainders and reversions. The question is about a situation where a remainder in the grantor's heirs becomes invalid and turns into a reversion for the grantor. 

Wait, let me think. Remainders are future interests that are given to someone other than the grantor. So if the grantor conveys land to A for life, then to B, B has a remainder. But if B is the grantor's heir, maybe that's a problem. Oh right, there's this doctrine about worthier title. 

The Doctrine of Worthier Title says that if a grantor tries to create a future interest in their own heir, it's invalid because it's considered a better title for the property to revert back to the grantor. So the remainder would fail and instead become a reversion in the grantor. 

So looking at the options, option C is Doctrine of Worthier Title. That sounds right. I'm a bit fuzzy on the other options. Doctrine of Merger is when a present estate and a future interest are held by the same person, so they merge. Contingent remainder is a type of remainder that's subject to a condition. Vested remainder is when the remainder is certain to happen. 

Shelley's Case is about when a life estate is followed by a remainder in the grantor's heirs, which becomes a vested remainder. But that's when the grantor is creating a life estate followed by a remainder in their own heirs, which by Shelley's rule becomes a vested remainder. So that's different because in this question, the remainder is in the grantor's heirs and it's invalid, turning into a reversion. So Shelley's case is option H, which doesn't fit here.

Escheat is when property goes back to the state because there are no heirs, so that's not it. Lapse is when a future interest fails because the holder dies before the present estate ends, so the interest reverts. But that's more about the timing of the beneficiary's death, not about being the grantor's heir.

Rule Against Perpetuities is about interests that might vest too far in the future, but that's a different concept. So the correct answer should be C, Doctrine of Worthier Title.

The question involves a situation where a remainder in the grantor's heirs becomes invalid and reverts to the grantor. In property law, this scenario is addressed by the Doctrine of Worthier Title, which invalidates a future interest created in the grantor's own heir, as it is deemed more appropriate for the property to revert to the grantor rather than pass to the heir. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Related Doctrine of Merger** pertains to the combination of a present estate and a future interest, which is irrelevant here.  
- **B: Contingent Remainder** and **E: Vested Remainder** describe types of remainders, not the invalidation of a remainder in the grantor's heirs.  
- **C: Doctrine of Worthier Title** directly applies, as it invalidates a remainder in the grantor's heir, causing it to revert to the grantor.  
- **D: Doctrine of Escheat** involves property reverting to the state, not the grantor.  
- **F: Rule in Wild's Case** and **H: Rule in Shelley's Case** address different scenarios involving future interests but do not apply here.  
- **G: Doctrine of Lapse** concerns the failure of a future interest due to the beneficiary's death, not the grantor's heirs.  
- **I: Doctrine of Advowson** and **J: Rule Against Perpetuities** are unrelated to the question.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Doctrine of Worthier Title**.  

C
