Question:

A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Increase the dosage of corticosteroids
B: Begin amphotericin therapy
C: Increase the dosage of cyclosporine
D: Perform a second kidney transplant
E: Discontinue all medications and monitor the patient's condition
F: Begin ganciclovir therapy
G: Begin interferon therapy
H: Decrease the dosage of cyclosporine
I: Decrease the dosage of corticosteroids
J: Begin acyclovir therapy

Okay, so I have this question about a patient who had a kidney transplant and now is presenting with some symptoms. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The patient is a 42-year-old man who got a cadaveric renal transplant three months ago. At discharge, his creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, which is good because that means the kidney was working well. Now, he comes in with malaise, muscle and joint pain, and a fever of 38.4°C for three days. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm³, which is low—that's leukopenia. His creatinine is now 1.6 mg/dL, which is higher than before, so his kidney function is worsening. The cyclosporine levels are therapeutic, so it's not due to toxicity. The kidney biopsy shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Hmm.

So, I need to think about possible causes. The symptoms like fever, malaise, and the lab results point towards an infection. The inclusion bodies in the biopsy make me think of viral infections, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV), because CMV is known to cause inclusion bodies. Also, after a transplant, patients are immunosuppressed, so they're more prone to infections like CMV.

His medications are cyclosporine and corticosteroids, which are immunosuppressive. So, he's at risk for opportunistic infections. CMV is a common one in transplant patients. The fact that the cyclosporine levels are normal rules out nephrotoxicity causing the elevated creatinine. So the kidney issue is probably due to the infection.

Now, looking at the options. The question is, what's the next step in management.

Option A: Increase corticosteroids. Wait, steroids are immunosuppressive. If he's already immunosuppressed and possibly has an infection, increasing steroids might make it worse. Plus, CMV would need antiviral treatment, not more immunosuppression.

Option B: Begin amphotericin. That's for fungal infections. The inclusion bodies suggest viral, not fungal, so probably not this.

Option C: Increase cyclosporine. His levels are already therapeutic, and increasing could worsen nephrotoxicity. Plus, the kidney function is already declining, so this might not be the best move.

Option D: Second transplant. That seems too drastic. He just had the transplant, and the issue is likely reversible with treatment, so this isn't the next step.

Option E: Stop all meds. That would probably cause rejection, which is bad. Plus, without immunosuppression, the body might attack the kidney. So not a good idea.

Option F: Ganciclovir. Oh right, ganciclovir is used for CMV. So if the biopsy shows inclusion bodies, and the patient has symptoms of infection, F could be the right choice.

Option G: Interferon. Not the first-line for CMV. Usually, antivirals like ganciclovir or valganciclovir are used.

Option H: Decrease cyclosporine. That might help reduce immunosuppression, but the immediate treatment would be antiviral. Plus, adjusting immunosuppressants needs careful consideration to avoid rejection.

Option I: Decrease steroids. Similar to H, but again, the main issue is treating the infection.

Option J: Acyclovir. That's for herpes viruses, like HSV or VZV, but not as effective against CMV. CMV requires ganciclovir.

So putting it all together, the inclusion bodies are likely from CMV, so starting antiviral therapy with ganciclovir (option F) makes sense.

The patient is a 42-year-old man who underwent cadaveric renal transplantation three months ago and now presents with malaise, muscle and joint pain, fever (38.4°C), leukopenia (2700/mm³), and elevated serum creatinine (1.6 mg/dL). The kidney biopsy shows intracellular inclusion bodies, which are characteristic of viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV). The patient is immunosuppressed due to cyclosporine and corticosteroids, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections like CMV. The therapeutic cyclosporine levels rule out nephrotoxicity as the cause of the elevated creatinine, suggesting that the kidney dysfunction is secondary to the infection.

The inclusion bodies and clinical presentation strongly suggest CMV infection, which requires antiviral therapy. Among the options, ganciclovir is the appropriate treatment for CMV. Increasing or decreasing immunosuppression (options A, C, H, I) is not the immediate next step, as the primary issue is treating the infection. Other options, such as amphotericin (B), interferon (G), or acyclovir (J), are not first-line treatments for CMV. Discontinuing all medications (E) or performing a second transplant (D) is premature and unnecessary at this stage.

The most appropriate next step is to begin ganciclovir therapy to address the CMV infection.
