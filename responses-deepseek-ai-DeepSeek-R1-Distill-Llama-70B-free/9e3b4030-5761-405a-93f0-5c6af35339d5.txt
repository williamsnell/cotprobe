Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about aspartic acid and its concentrations at different pH levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the question says that the pKa of aspartic acid is 2.8. They're asking about a 1M aspartic acid solution at pH 2.8 and then when the pH is raised to 3.8. I need to find the concentrations of aspartic acid and aspartate ion in each case.

I remember that aspartic acid is a diprotic amino acid, so it has two carboxylic groups that can donate protons. But wait, in this problem, maybe we only need to consider the first dissociation because the pKa given is 2.8, which I think corresponds to the first acidic group. The second pKa is higher, like around 9 or something, so at pH 3.8, it's probably deprotonated for the first group but not the second.

So when the pH equals the pKa, the solution should be a buffer where the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal. Oh wait, that's the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). At pH=pKa, the log term is zero, so [A-] = [HA]. But wait, the solution is 1M aspartic acid to start with. So in that case, when pH is 2.8, the concentration of HA and A- should each be 0.5M each? Because the total is 1M, so each would be half.

Wait, no, wait a second. Aspartic acid is a diprotic acid, but the pKa given is for the first dissociation. So the first dissociation is HA ⇌ H+ + A-. So the initial solution is 1M of HA. At pH=pKa, the ratio of A- to HA is 1, so both are 0.5M each. So when the pH is 2.8, [HA] = [A-] = 0.5M. But wait, that would be the case if it's a monoprotic acid. But since aspartic acid has two acidic groups, maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating aspartic acid as a monoprotic acid for simplicity, considering only the first proton. So when the solution is at pH 2.8, the first proton is half dissociated. So [HA] = 0.5 M and [A-] = 0.5 M.

Wait, but the question is first about the aspartic acid concentration when the pH is 2.8. So [HA] is 0.5 M, and [A-] is 0.5 M. So when the pH is raised to 3.8, which is higher than pKa, the solution will have more A- than HA.

Let me think about that. So when pH is above pKa, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells us that [A-] > [HA]. The pH is 3.8, pKa is 2.8, so the difference is 1. So the equation becomes 1 = log([A-]/[HA]). So [A-]/[HA] = 10^1 = 10. So [A-] is 10 times [HA].

But the total concentration of aspartic acid species is still 1 M. So [HA] + [A-] = 1. Let me let [HA] = x, so [A-] = 10x. So x + 10x = 1 → 11x = 1 → x = 1/11 ≈ 0.0909 M. So [HA] is about 0.09 M and [A-] is 0.91 M. So when the pH is 3.8, the aspartate ion concentration is 0.91 M, and aspartic acid (HA) is 0.09 M.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It first asks, what is the aspartic acid concentration of a 1M solution at pH 2.8, then what's the aspartate ion concentration when pH is 3.8.

Wait, in the first case, the aspartic acid concentration is the same as [HA], which is 0.5 M. Because when pH=pKa, [HA] = [A-] = 0.5 M each.

So the first part: aspartic acid concentration is 0.5 M and aspartate is 0.5 M. But the question is phrased as two separate questions: the first is the aspartic acid concentration at pH 2.8, and the second is the aspartate ion concentration when pH is 3.8.

Wait, but in the first part, when pH equals pKa, both HA and A- are 0.5 M. So aspartic acid is the HA form, which is 0.5 M. Then, when pH is raised to 3.8, aspartate ion (A-) is 0.91 M.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. The first part is 0.5 M aspartic acid (HA) and the second part is 0.91 M aspartate (A-).

Wait, but looking at the options, the first value is when pH is 2.8, the aspartic acid concentration. So that's 0.5 M. The second value is when pH is 3.8, the aspartate concentration, which is 0.91 M.

Looking at the options, I'm trying to find an option where the first part is 0.5 M, and the second is around 0.9 M.

Option I says 0.5 and 0.9, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. No, wait, option B is 0.5 M and 1 M, which doesn't make sense because 0.5 +1 would be more than 1 M. Option I is 0.5 and 0.9, which adds up to 1.4, which is impossible. Wait, wait that can't be right. Because the total concentration can't exceed 1 M.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again. When the solution is 1M aspartic acid (HA) and the pH is 2.8, then [HA] = [A-] = 0.5 M each.

When pH is increased to 3.8, which is higher than pKa, so more A- is formed. Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) → 3.8 = 2.8 + log([A-]/[HA])

Subtract 2.8: 1 = log([A-]/[HA]) → [A-]/[HA] = 10^1 =10 → [A-]=10 [HA]

Total concentration: [HA] + [A-] = 1 → [HA] +10 [HA] =1 →11 [HA]=1 → [HA]=1/11≈0.0909 M, [A-]=0.909 M.

So the aspartate ion concentration is ≈0.909 M, which is approximately 0.9 M.

So the first part: aspartic acid concentration at pH 2.8 is 0.5 M. The second part: aspartate ion at pH 3.8 is 0.9 M.

Looking at the options, option I is "0.5 M, 0.9 M". That matches.

But let me check the options again.

Option I: 0.5 M, 0.9 M.

Yes, that's what I've got.

The problem involves determining the concentrations of aspartic acid (HA) and its conjugate base (aspartate ion, A⁻) at two different pH levels: 2.8 and 3.8. The pKa of aspartic acid is given as 2.8, which corresponds to the first dissociation of the acid. The total concentration of aspartic acid in solution is 1 M.

### Case 1: pH = 2.8
At pH = pKa, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation simplifies to:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right)
\]

When pH = pKa, the logarithmic term becomes zero, meaning \([A^-] = [HA]\). Since the total concentration of aspartic acid is 1 M, the concentrations of HA and A⁻ are each:

\[
[HA] = [A^-] = 0.5 \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, at pH = 2.8, the concentration of aspartic acid (HA) is **0.5 M**.

### Case 2: pH = 3.8
At pH = 3.8, which is higher than the pKa, the solution will favor the conjugate base (A⁻) over the acid (HA). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
3.8 = 2.8 + \log\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right)
\]

Subtracting 2.8 from both sides:

\[
\log\left(\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\right) = 1
\]

Taking the antilog:

\[
\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10
\]

Let \([HA] = x\). Then \([A^-] = 10x\). The total concentration of aspartic acid is:

\[
[HA] + [A^-] = 1 \implies x + 10x = 1 \implies 11x = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{11} \approx 0.0909 \, \text{M}
\]

Thus:

\[
[HA] \approx 0.0909 \, \text{M}, \quad [A^-] \approx 0.909 \, \text{M}
\]

At pH = 3.8, the concentration of aspartate ion (A⁻) is approximately **0.9 M**.

### Final Answer
The aspartic acid concentration at pH = 2.8 is **0.5 M**, and the aspartate ion concentration at pH = 3.8 is **0.9 M**. This matches **Option I**.
