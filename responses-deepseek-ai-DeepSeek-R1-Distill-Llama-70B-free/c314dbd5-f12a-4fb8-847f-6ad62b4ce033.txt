Okay, so I've got this physics question here about vectors. Hmm, let me think. The question is: If two non-zero vectors are added together, and the resultant vector is zero, what must be true of the two vectors?

Alright, I remember that vectors have both magnitude and direction. So when you add two vectors, the result depends on both their sizes and the directions they're pointing in.

Wait, the resultant is zero. That means they must be canceling each other out completely. Like, if I push an object with a force, and someone else pushes in the opposite direction with the same force, it doesn't move. So the vectors have to be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me look at the options. Option E says they have equal magnitude and are pointed in opposite directions. That sounds right. Oh wait, what about the others?

Option A says different magnitudes and opposite directions. If they're different, adding them would give a non-zero vector. Because one would be stronger than the other. So that's not right.

Option B says zero magnitude. No, because the vectors are non-zero. So that's wrong.

Option C claims it's impossible. But the question says it's possible because it's given, so C is incorrect.

Options D and G talk about 90 degrees or being perpendicular. If they are perpendicular, their sum wouldn't be zero unless both are zero vectors, which they're not. So that's not it.

Option F has same direction and equal magnitude. If they're same direction, adding them would double the magnitude, not zero. So F is wrong.

Option H says different magnitudes and same direction. Again, adding them would give a larger vector in that direction, so not zero.

Option I says they are parallel. Well, if they're in exactly opposite directions, they're still parallel but opposite. So I is kind of correct in that sense, but the key point is that their magnitudes are equal and directions opposite.

So the correct answer must be E. Because they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to cancel each other out.

When two non-zero vectors are added together and the resultant vector is zero, it means they must completely cancel each other out. This can only happen if the vectors have equal magnitudes and are pointed in exactly opposite directions. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Different magnitudes and opposite directions would not result in a zero vector, as one vector would dominate.  
- **B**: Zero magnitude contradicts the condition that the vectors are non-zero.  
- **C**: It is indeed possible for the sum of two non-zero vectors to be zero under specific conditions.  
- **D** and **G**: Perpendicular vectors would not sum to zero unless both vectors are zero, which they are not.  
- **E**: Equal magnitudes and opposite directions ensure complete cancellation, making this the correct choice.  
- **F**: Same direction and equal magnitudes would double the magnitude, not result in zero.  
- **H**: Different magnitudes in the same direction would also not result in zero.  
- **I**: While parallel vectors can cancel if they are opposite in direction, the key detail here is equal magnitudes, making **E** more precise.  

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.
