Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Unless otherwise stated, thermodynamic data are for 298.15 K. When a certain freon used in refrigeration was expanded adiabatically from an initial pressure of $32 \mathrm{~atm}$ and $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to a final pressure of $1.00 \mathrm{~atm}$, the temperature fell by $22 \mathrm{~K}$. Calculate the Joule-Thomson coefficient, $\mu$, at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, assuming it remains constant over this temperature range.

B: 1.50$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{atm}^{-1}$
C:  0.71$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{atm}^{-1}$
D: 1.05$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{atm}^{-1}$
E: 0.95$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{atm}^{-1}$
F: 0.55$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{atm}^{-1}$

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the Joule-Thomson coefficient. Hmm, I remember that the Joule-Thomson effect has to do with the temperature change when a gas expands adiabatically without any heat exchange. The coefficient, mu, relates the temperature change to the pressure change.

The problem says that a certain freon is expanded adiabatically. The initial conditions are 32 atm and 0°C. The final pressure is 1 atm, and the temperature drops by 22 K. I need to find the Joule-Thomson coefficient at 0°C, assuming it's constant over this temperature range.

Wait, the formula for the Joule-Thomson coefficient, mu, is the change in temperature divided by the change in pressure, right? So mu = (ΔT) / (ΔP). But wait, I should double-check the exact formula.

Yes, the definition is mu = (dT/dP)_H at constant enthalpy. So in an adiabatic expansion with no work (Joule-Thomson expansion), the temperature change is related to the pressure change by ΔT = mu * ΔP.

But wait, the pressure is dropping, so the change in pressure ΔP is final minus initial. So ΔP = P_final - P_initial. Let me plug in the numbers.

Initial pressure P_i is 32 atm, final P_f is 1 atm. So ΔP = 1 - 32 = -31 atm. The temperature change ΔT is a drop of 22 K, so it's -22 K (since T_final = T_initial -22 K).

Wait, the formula is ΔT = mu * ΔP. So substituting, -22 K = mu * (-31 atm). Let me write that out:

ΔT = mu * (P_f - P_i)
-22 K = mu * (1 - 32 atm)
-22 K = mu * (-31 atm)

So solving for mu: mu = (-22 K) / (-31 atm) = 22/31 K·atm⁻¹.

Hmm, calculating that. 22 divided by 31. Let's see, 31 times 0.7 is 21.7, which is close to 22. So 0.7 approximately. But let me do it more accurately.

22 / 31 = 0.709677... Approximately 0.71 K·atm⁻¹.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.71 K atm⁻¹. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the sign. Since pressure is decreasing, the change is negative. The temperature is also decreasing, so mu is positive if the temperature drops when pressure drops. Let me think: the formula is correct. The signs worked out because both ΔT and ΔP are negative, so their ratio is positive.

Yes, because the coefficient is positive, which makes sense if cooling happens upon expansion. So the calculation seems right.

To calculate the Joule-Thomson coefficient, $\mu$, we use the relationship:

\[
\mu = \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta P}
\]

Here, $\Delta T$ is the temperature change, and $\Delta P$ is the pressure change. The problem states that the temperature drops by $22 \, \mathrm{K}$ when the pressure decreases from $32 \, \mathrm{atm}$ to $1 \, \mathrm{atm}$. Thus:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial}} = -22 \, \mathrm{K}
\]
\[
\Delta P = P_{\text{final}} - P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \, \mathrm{atm} - 32 \, \mathrm{atm} = -31 \, \mathrm{atm}
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\mu = \frac{-22 \, \mathrm{K}}{-31 \, \mathrm{atm}} = \frac{22}{31} \, \mathrm{K \cdot atm^{-1}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\mu \approx 0.71 \, \mathrm{K \cdot atm^{-1}}
\]

This matches option C. The positive value of $\mu$ is consistent with the fact that the temperature decreases as the pressure decreases, indicating cooling upon expansion.
