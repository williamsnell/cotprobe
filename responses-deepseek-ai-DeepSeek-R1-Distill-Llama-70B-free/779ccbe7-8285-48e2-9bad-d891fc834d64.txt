Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about two copper blocks being placed in contact. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the details, but let's think it through.

Alright, the question says we have two copper blocks, each with a mass of 10.0 kg. One is at 100 degrees Celsius, and the other is at 0 degrees. They're placed in an isolated container, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. I need to find the total entropy change, ΔS_total.

Wait, entropy change when two objects exchange heat. Right, when they come into contact, heat will flow from the hotter block to the cooler one until they reach a common temperature. So I need to calculate the heat lost by the hotter block and the heat gained by the cooler one, then find the entropy change for each and sum them up.

But wait, since it's an isolated system, the heat lost by the hot block equals the heat gained by the cold block, right? So Q_hot = -Q_cold. Because energy is conserved.

The specific heat capacity of copper is given as 0.385 J/(K·g). Oh, and the mass is in kg, so I should convert that to grams. Wait, 10 kg is 10,000 grams each.

So the formula for heat transfer is Q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass, c specific heat, and ΔT the temperature change.

But wait, I need to find the final temperature first. Because both blocks will reach the same temperature when equilibrium is reached. Let's call that T_f.

So for the hot block (initial T is 100°C = 373 K), it will lose heat, so Q = m * c * (T_initial - T_f). The cold block (initial 0°C = 273 K) will gain heat, so Q = m * c * (T_f - T_initial).

Wait, but since the masses and specific heat capacities are the same for both, the heat lost by the hot block equals the heat gained by the cold block. So:

m * c * (373 - T_f) = m * c * (T_f - 273)

Oh, wait, the m and c are same on both sides, so they cancel out.

So 373 - T_f = T_f - 273

Adding T_f to both sides: 373 = 2 T_f - 273

Adding 273 to both sides: 646 = 2 T_f

So T_f = 646 / 2 = 323 K.

Wait, 323 K is 50°C. That makes sense because the average of 0 and 100 is 50.

Now, calculate the heat exchanged. Let's compute Q for each block.

For the hot block: Q_hot = m * c * (373 - 323) = 10,000 g * 0.385 J/(g·K) * 50 K.

Wait, 10,000 * 0.385 = 3850, multiplied by 50 is 192,500 J. So Q_hot = 192500 J.

Similarly, the cold block: Q_cold = 10,000 * 0.385 * (323 - 273) = same 192500 J. Makes sense.

But wait, the entropy change for each block is ΔS = Q / T, but since the heat transfer happens at varying temperatures, I can't just use the initial temperature. Oh wait, no, for a process where temperature changes, the entropy change is the integral of dQ/T, which for constant specific heat can be written as m c ln(T_final / T_initial). Because when the temperature changes, each infinitesimal heat transfer dQ is at a certain T.

Right, so for each block, the entropy change will be:

ΔS = m * c * ln(T_final / T_initial)

But wait, the hot block is cooling, so its T_final is less than T_initial, so ΔS_hot = m c ln(323/373). Because it's losing heat, the entropy change will be negative. The cold block is warming, so its ΔS_cold = m c ln(323/273), which is positive.

So total entropy change is ΔS_total = ΔS_hot + ΔS_cold.

Let me plug in the numbers.

m = 10,000 g for each, c = 0.385 J/(g·K).

ΔS_hot = 10000 * 0.385 * ln(323/373)
ΔS_cold = 10000 * 0.385 * ln(323/273)

Compute each term.

First, compute 323/373. Let me see: 323 divided by 373. Well, 373 is approximately 3.73e2, 323 is 3.23e2. Let's compute 323/373.

323 ÷ 373 ≈ 0.866.

Similarly, 323/273. 273 is about 0.273e3, so 323 is 0.323e3. So 323/273 ≈ 1.183.

Now calculate the natural logs.

ln(0.866) ≈ Let's think. ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5)= -0.693, ln(0.7)= approx -0.357. Hmm, 0.866 is higher than 0.8, maybe around ln(0.8)= -0.223. So 0.866 is e^-0.144? Because e^-0.144 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think: e^-0.15 is approx 0.8607. So ln(0.866) ≈ -0.146.

And ln(1.183). Hmm, because e^0.16 is about 1.1735, e^0.17 is about 1.185. So ln(1.183) is approximately 0.167.

So for the hot block:

ΔS_hot = 10000 * 0.385 * (-0.146) = Let's compute 10000 * 0.385 first. 10000 * 0.385 = 3850.

So 3850 * (-0.146) = approximately -561.1 J/K.

For the cold block:

ΔS_cold = 10000 * 0.385 * 0.167 = 3850 * 0.167 ≈ 643.45 J/K.

So the total entropy change is (-561.1) + 643.45 = 82.35 J/K.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 82.3. Let me look at the options:

Options are A:65.3, B:93.4, C:110.5, D:58.6, E:120.8, F:87.2, G:78.9, H:100.6, I:102.9, J:81.7.

Hmm, 82.35 is close to option J:81.7, but maybe my approximations for the ln values are off. Let me be more precise.

I should calculate ln(323/373) and ln(323/273) accurately.

Compute 323/373: 323 ÷ 373.

Let me compute 373 into 323:

373 × 0.866 = let's see: 373 * 0.8=298.4, 0.066*373≈24.6 → 298.4+24.6=323. So 323/373 is exactly 0.866.

So ln(0.866) is approximately.

I can calculate it more accurately. Using calculator-like approach.

We know that:

ln(0.8) = -0.22314,

ln(0.85) ≈ -0.1625,

ln(0.866):

Let me use the Taylor expansion around a point, say a=0.8.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator-like approach. Alternatively, I can use the relation that ln(x) = integral from 1 to x of (1/t) dt.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that ln(13/15) because 0.866 is 13/15 ≈ 0.866666...

So ln(13/15) = ln(13) - ln(15).

We know that ln(13)=2.5649, ln(15)=2.70805.

So 2.5649 - 2.70805 ≈ -0.1432.

So ln(0.866666) ≈ -0.1432.

Similarly, 323/273 = 1.183486...

Wait, 273 * 1.183 ≈ 323? Let me check 273 *1.183:

273 *1 =273, 273 *0.183 = approx 273 *0.18=49.14, 273*0.003=0.819 → total ≈273 +49.14 +0.819=322.96 ≈323. So yes, 1.183.

So ln(1.183486).

We can compute this accurately. Let's compute ln(1.183486).

We can remember that ln(1.2)=0.1823, ln(1.15)=0.1398, ln(1.18)=?

Let me compute using the Taylor series expansion around 1.18.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use the fact that 1.183486 is approximately e^0.166. Let me think: e^0.16 is about 1.1735, e^0.17 is about 1.1856. Oh wait, 1.183486 is between e^0.16 and e^0.17.

Compute e^0.166: Let me compute 0.166 *1 = 0.166.

We can use the expansion e^x ≈1 +x +x^2/2 +x^3/6 +x^4/24.

x=0.166.

x=0.166 → x^2=0.027556, x^3=0.00458, x^4=0.00076.

So e^0.166 ≈1 +0.166 +0.027556/2 +0.00458/6 +0.00076/24.

Compute each term:

1 =1

+0.166 → 1.166

+0.027556/2=0.013778 → 1.179778

+0.00458/6≈0.000763 → 1.180541

+0.00076/24≈0.0000317 →1.180573.

So e^0.166≈1.18057. But we have 1.183486, which is slightly higher.

So maybe x is 0.167.

Compute e^0.167.

x=0.167, x²=0.027889, x³=0.00466, x^4=0.000777.

e^0.167 ≈1 +0.167 +0.027889/2 +0.00466/6 +0.000777/24.

1 +0.167 =1.167.

+0.027889/2=0.0139445 →1.1809445.

+0.00466/6≈0.0007767 →1.1817212.

+0.000777/24≈0.0000324 →1.1817536.

So e^0.167≈1.18175, which is still less than 1.183486.

The target is 1.183486. Let's find the x where e^x =1.183486.

We have at x=0.166, e^x≈1.1805.

At x=0.167, e^x≈1.18175.

At x=0.168, let's compute e^0.168.

x=0.168 → x²=0.028224, x³=0.004743, x^4=0.000796.

So e^0.168 =1 +0.168 +0.028224/2 +0.004743/6 +0.000796/24.

1 +0.168=1.168.

+0.028224/2=0.014112 →1.182112.

+0.004743/6≈0.0007905 →1.182903.

+0.000796/24≈0.0000331 →1.182936.

So e^0.168 ≈1.182936, which is getting closer to 1.183486.

The difference is 1.183486 -1.182936=0.00055.

How much more x do we need? Let's approximate the derivative. The derivative of e^x is e^x. At x=0.168, e^x≈1.182936. So to get an increase of 0.00055, we need dx ≈0.00055 / 1.182936 ≈0.000465.

So x≈0.168 + 0.000465=0.168465.

So approximately, ln(1.183486)=0.168465, about 0.1685.

So rounding, it's approximately 0.1685.

So more accurately:

ln(323/373) = ln(0.8666667) ≈-0.14315.

ln(323/273)=ln(1.183486)=≈0.1685.

Now recalculate the entropy changes more accurately.

ΔS_hot = m * c * ln(Tf/Th_initial)

Wait, no: for the hot block, it's cooling from Th_initial to Tf, so the entropy change is m c ln(Tf/Th_initial).

Wait, no, wait, the formula for entropy when temperature changes is ΔS = m c ∫ (1/T) dT from T_initial to T_final.

Which is m c ln(T_final / T_initial) if T_final > T_initial, or ln(T_final/T_initial) could be negative.

So for the hot block, T_final is 323, T_initial is 373. So the ratio is 323/373 ≈0.866.

So ln(0.866)=approx -0.14315.

So ΔS_hot = 10000 g * 0.385 J/(g·K) * (-0.14315) → let's compute.

10000 * 0.385 = 3850 J/K.

3850 * (-0.14315) = let's calculate 3850 * 0.14315.

3850 * 0.1=385.

3850 *0.04=154.

3850 *0.003=11.55.

3850 *0.00015=0.5775.

Wait, wait, that's for 0.14315.

Wait, 0.14315 = 0.1 +0.04 +0.003 +0.00015.

So 385 *0.1 is 38.5 → wait no, 3850 * 0.1 is 385.

Wait, 3850 * 0.04 = 154.

3850 * 0.003 =11.55.

3850 * 0.00015=0.5775.

Adding all: 385 +154=539, +11.55=550.55, +0.5775≈551.1275.

So 3850 * (-0.14315)= -551.1275 J/K.

Similarly, for the cold block:

ΔS_cold =10000 *0.385 * ln(323/273) = 3850 * 0.1685.

Compute 3850 * 0.1685.

Let me break it down.

0.1 * 3850 =385.

0.06 *3850=231.

0.0085 *3850=32.725.

So 385 +231=616 +32.725=648.725.

So ΔS_cold=+648.725 J/K.

Now total ΔS_total= (-551.1275) +648.725 = 97.5975 J/K.

Hmm, that's about 97.6 J/K. Looking at the options, option B is +93.4, F is +87.2, I is +102.9.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, the mass is 10 kg each, which is 10,000 grams each. So each block is 10,000 grams.

But wait, wait, the problem says each block is 10 kg. So each has mass 10,000 grams. So when I calculate for each, it's 10,000 * 0.385.

But when calculating ΔS, for each block, the entropy change is as I did: 3850 * ln(...).

Wait, but when I sum the two, the total is about 97.6 J/K.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:93.4, H:100.6, I:102.9.

Hmm, perhaps my calculation of ln(323/273) is a little off.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the exact entropy using the heat transfer, but not using the ln approximation.

Wait, the entropy change for a process where heat is transferred at varying temperature is the integral of dQ/T.

But for each block, when heat is transferred reversibly, the entropy change is:

ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial).

Which I used correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact value without approximating the ln.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact entropy using Q_hot and Q_cold.

Wait, the heat lost by the hot block is Q = m c (T_initial - T_final).

Wait, Q = m c ΔT, but the entropy change is ΔS = Q / T_average? No, that's not correct because T is changing, so it's an integral.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the final temperature.

Let me recalculate the final temperature.

The heat lost by the hot block equals the heat gained by the cold block.

So:

m1 c (Tf - T1) = - m2 c (Tf - T2)

Wait, because Q1 = m1 c (Tf - T1), and Q2 = m2 c (Tf - T2). But since Q1 = -Q2 (heat lost by hot is heat gained by cold), so:

m1 c (Tf - T1) = - m2 c (Tf - T2)

But since m1 = m2 =10 kg, and c same,

(Tf - T1) = -(Tf - T2)

Tf - T1 = -Tf + T2

2 Tf = T1 + T2 → Tf = (T1 + T2)/2.

Ah, so if both masses are the same, the final temperature is the average of the initial temperatures.

So T1 =373 K, T2=273 K. So
