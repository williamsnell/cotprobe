Question:

Albert Attorney was a solo practitioner in Littletown who operated a general law practice. In 1990, Albert drafted a document for a client's estate plan that unfortunately violated the rule against perpetuities. Upon the testator's death in 2004, the mistake was discovered. Because of the error, the estate plan was not admitted to probate so the assets were distributed under the state intestacy statute. Gordon Greedy was named as a substantial taker under the estate plan, but did not take under the intestate statute since he was not a relative. The state statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. If Gordon sues Albert for professional malpractice in 2005, the best defense Albert can assert is

Options:

A: Albert did not intentionally make the mistake in the estate plan.
B: The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.
C: Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.
D: The error in the estate plan was due to a change in legislation.
E: The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand.
F: Albert Attorney was not practicing at the time of the testator's death.
G: Albert was not aware of the mistake until the testator's death.
H: The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.
I: Gordon Greedy was not a direct client of Albert Attorney.
J: Gordon Greedy was not a relative and therefore cannot sue for professional malpractice.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about legal malpractice. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm not super familiar with all the nuances, but I'll do my best.

The question is about Albert Attorney, who was a solo practitioner. In 1990, he drafted an estate plan for a client that violated the rule against perpetuities. The testator died in 2004, and the mistake was discovered then. Because of this error, the estate plan wasn't admitted to probate, so the assets were distributed under the state's intestacy statute. Gordon Greedy was supposed to get a substantial amount under the estate plan but didn't because he's not a relative, so he didn't take under intestacy. Now, Gordon is suing Albert for professional malpractice in 2005. The state's statute of limitations for malpractice is three years. The question is, what's Albert's best defense?

The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is the best defense.

First, I should recall what the statute of limitations for legal malpractice typically looks like. Generally, the statute begins to run when the client discovers the error or when the attorney-client relationship ends, whichever comes later. But I also remember that sometimes the limitations period starts when the mistake was made, but that's not usually the case. More often, it's when the client knew or should have known about the problem.

In this case, Albert made the error in 1990, but it wasn't discovered until the testator's death in 2004. So the mistake was discovered in 2004. The statute is three years, so the lawsuit would need to be filed by 2007. But Gordon sued in 2005, which is within the three-year window. So if the statute of limitations started in 2004, suing in 2005 would be timely. But waitâ€”maybe there's another angle here.

Wait, but the question says the statute of limitations is three years. When does the clock start ticking? If it's a traditional rule, some states start the clock when the services were rendered, which here was 1990. But others start when the error was discovered or when the client suffered harm. So if the harm was realized upon the testator's death in 2004, then the three-year period would start then, making Gordon's 2005 lawsuit timely. But if the state follows a different rule, maybe the statute started when Albert did the work, which would make the limitations period expire in 1993. But that seems too harsh because the client wouldn't know about the mistake until later.

I think the majority rule is that the statute of limitations for legal malpractice begins when the client discovers or should have discovered the error. So in this case, the testator died in 2004, and the error was discovered then. So the three-year period would run from 2004, making Gordon's 2005 lawsuit within the time limit. Therefore, the statute of limitations defense might not be applicable here. Wait, but let me check the options.

Option B says the statute of limitations has run. But if the three years started in 2004, then 2005 is within the period. So B would not be a valid defense.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the state in question has a different rule. For example, some states have a statute that starts when the services were performed, but that's less common. If that's the case, 1990 plus three years would be 1993, so by 2005, it's way beyond. But the problem states that the mistake was discovered upon the testator's death in 2004. So I think the discovery would trigger the start of the limitations period.

Wait, but I remember something about the "continuous representation" doctrine, which can toll the statute. But I don't think that applies here because Albert was a solo practitioner and probably didn't continue representing the client after 1990, especially since the client died in 2004. So that might not help.

So if the statute started in 2004, Gordon's lawsuit in 2005 is timely. So B wouldn't work as a defense. Therefore, Albert can't use the statute of limitations as a defense.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the trigger. Let me think again. The general rule is that the statute of limitations for legal malpractice begins when the client discovers the error or when the attorney-client relationship ends, whichever is later. So if the client died in 2004, and the error was discovered then, that's when the clock starts.

So if Gordon is suing in 2005, that's within three years, so the case isn't barred. So option B wouldn't be a good defense.

Looking at the other options. Option I says Gordon wasn't a direct client of Albert. That's an interesting point. Because Gordon was a beneficiary under the estate plan, not the client. The client was the testator, who is now deceased. So can a beneficiary sue the attorney for malpractice?

I think that generally, the attorney's duty is to the client, not to third parties. However, in some cases, beneficiaries can sue if they are intended third-party beneficiaries of the attorney's services. But that varies by jurisdiction.

In this case, Albert was drafting the estate plan for the testator, and Gordon was a beneficiary. So Gordon might not have standing to sue because he wasn't the client. The client was the testator, who is dead. So maybe the testator's estate could sue, but Gordon, as a beneficiary, might not have a claim unless he can establish that he was an intended third-party beneficiary.

So if Gordon wasn't the client, then he might not have a cause of action against Albert. So option I could be a good defense.

Alternatively, option J says Gordon wasn't a relative and can't sue for professional malpractice. But that's probably not correct because the ability to sue isn't based on being a relative, but rather on being a client or an intended beneficiary. So J doesn't seem right.

Option C says Gordon wasn't an eligible taker under the estate plan. But that's not correct because he was named as a substantial taker, so he was eligible under the plan, but not under intestacy.

Option F says Albert wasn't practicing at the time of the testator's death. But that doesn't matter because the malpractice occurred when he drafted the document in 1990. His current status doesn't affect liability.

Option G says Albert wasn't aware until the testator's death. But that doesn't matter for the statute of limitations if the client (or their estate) discovered it then.

Option D says the error was due to a change in legislation. There's no indication of that in the question, so that's not applicable.

Option E says the rule against perpetuities is too complicated. That's a substantive issue about whether Albert breached the standard of care, but it's not a defense to the lawsuit itself; it's about whether he was negligent.

Option A says Albert didn't intentionally make the mistake. That goes to whether he was negligent, but if he was negligent, that's enough for malpractice. So that wouldn't dismiss the case.

So putting it all together, the best defense would be that Gordon isn't the client, so he can't sue. So option I.

Wait, but let me think again. In some jurisdictions, a beneficiary can sue the attorney if they can show that they were intended to benefit from the attorney's services. So if Gordon was a named beneficiary, he might have standing. But if the jurisdiction requires privity of contract, then only the client can sue. So it depends on the state's law.

The question doesn't specify, but since it's a multiple-choice, I have to pick the best option. The options I and J are about Gordon's standing. Option I says he wasn't a client. If that's the case, then he can't sue. So that's a possible defense.

Alternatively, the fact that Gordon wasn't a relative (option J) might not be a defense because the issue is whether he's a client or intended beneficiary, not whether he's a relative.

So I think the best answer is I: Gordon Greedy was not a direct client of Albert Attorney. So Albert's defense is that Gordon lacks standing to sue because he wasn't the client.

The question revolves around Albert Attorney's professional malpractice in drafting an estate plan that violated the rule against perpetuities. Gordon Greedy, a beneficiary under the estate plan, sues Albert in 2005 after the error was discovered in 2004, following the testator's death. The statute of limitations for professional malpractice in the state is three years. The task is to determine Albert's best defense.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Albert did not intentionally make the mistake.  
   This goes to whether Albert was negligent, but negligence is sufficient for malpractice. This does not dismiss the lawsuit, so it is not a strong defense.

2. **Option B**: The statute of limitations has run.  
   The statute of limitations typically begins when the error is discovered or when the attorney-client relationship ends, whichever is later. Here, the error was discovered in 2004, and Gordon sued in 2005, which is within the three-year window. Therefore, this is not a valid defense.

3. **Option C**: Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.  
   Gordon was explicitly named as a substantial beneficiary under the estate plan, so this is factually incorrect and not a valid defense.

4. **Option D**: The error was due to a change in legislation.  
   There is no indication in the question that a change in legislation caused the error, so this is irrelevant.

5. **Option E**: The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in Littletown to understand.  
   This might speak to whether Albert breached the standard of care, but it does not provide a defense to the lawsuit itself.

6. **Option F**: Albert Attorney was not practicing at the time of the testator's death.  
   Albert's current status has no bearing on the malpractice that occurred in 1990, so this is irrelevant.

7. **Option G**: Albert was not aware of the mistake until the testator's death.  
   The statute of limitations is based on when the client (or their estate) discovered the error, not Albert's awareness. This does not affect the timeliness of the lawsuit.

8. **Option H**: The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.  
   This is irrelevant to the malpractice claim, as the issue is about the error in the estate plan, not payment.

9. **Option I**: Gordon Greedy was not a direct client of Albert Attorney.  
   Albert's duty was to the testator, his client, not to Gordon, a beneficiary. In many jurisdictions, only the client or their estate can sue for malpractice unless the beneficiary is an intended third-party beneficiary. This is a strong defense because Gordon was not the direct client.

10. **Option J**: Gordon Greedy was not a relative and therefore cannot sue for professional malpractice.  
    Whether Gordon is a relative is irrelevant. The issue is whether he has standing as a client or intended beneficiary, not his familial relationship to the testator.

### Conclusion:  
The best defense Albert can assert is that Gordon Greedy was not a direct client and therefore lacks standing to sue for professional malpractice. This makes **Option I** the correct answer.
