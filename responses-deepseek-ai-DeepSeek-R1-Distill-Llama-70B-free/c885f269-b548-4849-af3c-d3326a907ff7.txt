Okay, so I have this question about calculating the root mean square (rms) speed of O2 at room temperature. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that the rms speed is given by a formula involving the molar mass, temperature, and the gas constant. Oh right, the formula is v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass in kg/mol.

Wait, what's the molar mass of O2? Oxygen has an atomic weight of about 16 g/mol, so O2 would be 32 g/mol. Oh right, I need to convert that to kg/mol. So 32 g/mol is 0.032 kg/mol.

Room temperature is typically around 25 degrees Celsius, which is 298 K. Okay, so T is 298 K.

The gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Let me make sure I'm using the right units here. Everything seems to be in SI units, so that's correct.

Putting it all into the formula: v_rms = sqrt(3 * 8.314 * 298 / 0.032). Let me compute the numerator first. 3 times R is 3 * 8.314 = 24.942. Multiply that by T (298): 24.942 * 298. Let me calculate that. 24 * 300 would be 7200, but since it's 298, maybe around 24.942 * 300 is 7472.6 minus 24.942 * 2, which is 49.884. So 7472.6 - 49.884 is approximately 7422.716. So numerator is 7422.716.

Now divide by M (0.032 kg/mol): 7422.716 / 0.032. Let me compute that. 7422.716 divided by 0.032. Hmm, 7422.716 / 0.032 = let's see, 7422.716 * (1/0.032) = 7422.716 * 31.25. Wait, 1/0.032 is 31.25. So 7422.716 * 31.25. Let's break that down.

7000 * 31.25 is 218,750. 422.716 *31.25 is about 13,203.675. So total is approximately 218,750 + 13,203.675 = 231,953.675. So the value inside the square root is approximately 231,953.675.

Taking the square root of that. Let me think, sqrt(231953.675). What's the square of 480? 480^2 is 230,400. Oh wait, 480 squared is 230,400. 481^2 is 231,361. 482^2 is 232,324. So we're looking for sqrt(231,954). It's between 481 and 482. Let me calculate 481.5^2: 481^2 is 231,361, plus 0.5^2 plus 2*481*0.5. So 231,361 + 1 + 481 = 231,843. Hmm, but our value is 231,954. So 231,843 is 481.5^2. The difference is 111. So each 0.1 increase adds about 2*481.5*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 96.3 + 0.01 ≈ 96.31. So to get 111 more, maybe 0.12 or so. So approximately 481.62 m/s. Wait, but let me check.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me try a different approach. Let's take 481.5^2 = 481^2 + 2*481*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 231,361 + 481 + 0.25 = 231,842.25. Our target is 231,953.67, which is 111.42 higher. So how much more do I need to add? Let me consider that each 0.1 increase in x leads to an increase in x² of approximately 2*481.5 * 0.1 = 96.3. So 111.42 / 96.3 ≈ 1.157, so about 0.1157. So adding 0.1157 to 481.5 gives 481.6157. So approximately 481.6 m/s.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have messed up somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach would be better, but since I'm doing this mentally, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial value. Let's go step by step.

Compute 3RT: 3 * 8.314 = 24.942. 24.942 * 298 = ?

Compute 24.942 * 300 = 7472.6. But since it's 298, subtract 24.942 * 2 = 49.884. So 7472.6 -49.884 = 7422.716.

Divide by M (0.032): 7422.716 / 0.032 = let's compute 7422.716 /32 *1000. 7422.716 /32: 32 * 232 = 7424. So 7422.716 is slightly less than 32 * 232, which is 7424. So 232 minus (1.284/32). 1.284/32 ≈ 0.04. So approximately 231.96. Multiply by 1000, gives 231,960. So square root of 231,960 is around 481.6 m/s.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options: let's see the options given. Option A is 3.91e2, which is 391 m/s. Option D is 4.21e2=421. Option J is 461. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Oh wait, O2 is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol. Did I use kg/mol correctly? Yes, because R is in J/(mol·K), which uses kg.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the calculation again. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the rms speed for O2 at 25°C (298 K) is around 461 m/s. Wait, but that's not matching my earlier calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait wait, perhaps I should check the formula again. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the denominator. The formula is sqrt(3RT/M), where M is molar mass in kg/mol. So yes, I did that right.

Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately. Let's recompute 3*R*T = 3 * 8.314 * 298.

3 *8.314 is 24.942. 24.942 * 298 = ?

Let me compute 24.942 * 300 first, which is 7472.6. But since it's 298, which is 300 - 2, so subtract 24.942 *2 = 49.884. So 7472.6 -49.884 = 7422.716.

Then 7422.716 divided by M (0.032 kg/mol) is 7422.716 / 0.032.

Wait, 7422.716 / 0.032 = 7422716 / 32 = let me compute that.

Divide 7,422,716 by 32.

32 * 231,000 = 7,392,000. Subtract: 7,422,716 -7,392,000 = 30,716.

32 * 960 = 30,720. Oh wait, that's a bit more than 30,716. So 32 *959 = 30,688. 30,716-30,688=28. So 959 *32=30688, subtracted from 30716, leaves 28. So 231,000 +959 = 231,959. 28 left, so 28/32=0.875. So 231,959.875. So approximately 231959.875.

So sqrt(231959.875) is approx sqrt(231,960) as before. So that's 481.6 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are exactly 481.6. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 3.91 ×10² → 391 m/s

B:6.20 ×10² →620

C:4.00 ×10² →400

D:4.21 ×10² →421

E:2.80 ×10² →280

F:5.55 ×10² →555

G:6.00 ×10² →600

H:5.11 ×10² →511

I:3.50 ×10² →350

J:4.61 ×10² →461

Hmm, my calculation gives about 481.6, which isn't in the options. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me double-check. O2 is molecular oxygen, so each O atom is 16 g/mol, so O2 is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps room temperature is considered 273 K or 300 K. Oh, wait, no. Room temperature is typically around 25°C, which is 298 K. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the value of R is different. Oh wait, sometimes R is taken as 8.314 J/(mol·K), sometimes as 8.31. Let me try with R=8.314.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value more accurately. Let's redo the calculation step by step.

3RT = 3 * 8.314 * 298.

Compute 3 *8.314 = 24.942.

24.942 * 298: Let me compute 24.942 * 200 = 4,988.4; 24.942 *98 = ?

24.942 * 98: 24.942 *100 = 2,494.2; subtract 24.942 *2 = 49.884. So 2,494.2 -49.884 = 2,444.316.

So 24.942 *298 = 4,988.4 + 2,444.316 = 7,432.716 J/(mol).

Then we divide by M (0.032 kg/mol): 7,432.716 / 0.032 = let's compute.

7,432.716 /0.032 = 7,432.716 * (1/0.032) = 7,432.716 * 31.25.

Compute 7,432.716 * 31.25.

Let me break it down: 7,432.716 * 30 = 223,981.48; 7,432.716 *1.25 = 9,291.895.

Total is 223,981.48 +9,291.895 = 233,273.375.

So sqrt(233,273.375) is ?

Well, 483^2 is (480+3)^2=480^2 + 2*480*3 +3^2=230400 +2880 +9=233,289.

Wait, that's very close. 483^2=233,289. Our value is 233,273.375. So it's a little less than 483. So approximately 482.9 m/s.

But looking back at the options, the closest I have is option J: 4.61e2 = 461 m/s, and option F:555, option D:421, etc.

Wait, none of the options are 482.9. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. The rms speed is sqrt(3RT/M). Did I mix up M in g/mol instead of kg/mol? Oh wait, in the formula, M must be in kg/mol because R is in J/(mol·K), which uses kg.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me compute 3RT/M again.

3 * R =3 * 8.314 =24.942 J/(mol·K).

24.942 * T (298 K) = 24.942 *298 = let me compute accurately.

24 *298 = 7,152.

0.942 *298: 0.9 *298=268.2; 0.042 *298=12.516. So 268.2+12.516=280.716.

So total is 7,152 +280.716=7,432.716 J/mol.

Divide by M (0.032 kg/mol):7,432.716 /0.032 =233,272.375 J/(kg·mol) ?

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J/(kg·mol) would be (kg·m²/s²)/(kg·mol) = m²/(s²·mol). Then the square root would give m/s.

So sqrt(233,272.375) = approx 483 m/s.

But again, none of the options are near 480. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass.

Wait another thought: perhaps the molar mass was taken as 32 g/mol, but in kg/mol that's 0.032 kg/mol, which I used correctly.

Hmm, maybe I should try using M in g/mol but then adjust units. Wait, but the formula requires M in kg/mol when using R in J/(mol·K). So perhaps I should double-check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct and the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of 3RT/M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute M as 0.032 kg/mol.

Wait, let me compute 3RT/M: 3 *8.314 *298 = 7,432.716 J/mol.

7,432.716 J/mol divided by 0.032 kg/mol equals 7,432.716 / 0.032 = 232,272.375 (wait, did I miscalculate earlier?)

Wait, 7,432.716 divided by 0.032: Let me compute 7,432.716 /0.032.

0.032 times 200,000 is 6,400. So 7,432.716 -6,400=1,032.716.

Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Let me think, 0.032 * X =7,432.716.

So X =7,432.716 /0.032 = 7,432.716 * (1/0.032) =7,432.716 *31.25.

Compute 7,432.716 *31.25.

Calculate 7,432.716 *30 = 223,981.48.

7,432.716 *1.25 = 9,291.895.

Adding them together: 223,981.48 +9,291.895 =233,273.375.

So sqrt(233,273.375)= approximately 483 m/s.

Wait, but the options don't have 483. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass?

Wait, maybe O2 has a molar mass of 32 g/mol, but wait, maybe I should consider the exact molar mass. O has an atomic weight of about 16.00 g/mol, so O2 is 32.00 g/mol. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the square root. Let me think: 483^2 is 233,289, which is higher than 233,273.375. So sqrt(233,273.375) is 483 - (233,289-233,273.375)/(2*483).

The difference is 15.625. So 15.625/(2*483)=15.625/966≈0.0162. So sqrt is 483 -0.0162≈482.98 m/s, about 483 m/s.

But the options don't have 483. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the rms speed in different units, like cm/s instead of m/s? No, the options are in m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different value for R. Some sources use R=8.314 J/mol·K, others 8.31 or 8.315. Let me try with R=8.31.

So 3*R*T=3*8.31*298= 3*8.31=24.93; 24.93*298.

24*298=7,152; 0.93*298=277.14. So total 7,429.14.

Divide by M=0.032:7,429.14/0.032=232,222.625.

Sqrt(232,222.625)= approx 482 m/s.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given options are for different gases. For example, nitrogen is about 454 m/s, oxygen is a bit lower. Wait, O2 has a higher molar mass than N2, so its speed should be lower. N2 is about 454, O2 would be lower, perhaps around 420? Wait, but my calculation says 480, which is higher than N2's. That doesn't make sense. Wait, that indicates I made a mistake.

Wait wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Oh no, the formula is correct, but maybe I messed up the molar mass. Wait, O2 is 32 g/mol, which is 0.032 kg/mol. Let me check the molar masses of other gases.

Wait, maybe I should think about the speed of sound, but that's a different concept. Alternatively, perhaps I should compare to known rms speeds. For example, at 298 K, O2's rms speed is supposed to be around 461 m/s. Oh wait, one of the options is J:4.61e2=461 m/s. How does that fit with my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the square root. Let me compute sqrt(233,273) again. Let me think about 482^2: 482 *482.

480^2=230,400.

2*480*2=1,920.

2^2=4.

So 482^2=230,400 +1,920 +4= 232,324.

But our value is 233,273, which is higher than 482
