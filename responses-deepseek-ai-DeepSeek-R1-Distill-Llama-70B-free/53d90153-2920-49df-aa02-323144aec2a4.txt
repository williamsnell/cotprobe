Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating absolute pressure. Hmm, let's see. I remember that absolute pressure is the sum of gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I should think carefully.

The question says the gauge pressure is 1.5 MPa. Oh right, gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric, right? So to get absolute pressure, I add the barometric (atmospheric) pressure to it. The atmospheric pressure given is 104 kPa. Wait, but 1.5 MPa is a much bigger number. Oh, I should make sure the units match before adding.

1.5 MPa is the same as 1500 kPa because 1 MPa is 1000 kPa. So adding 1500 kPa and 104 kPa gives me 1604 kPa. Let me check the options. Oh, option C is 1.604 MPa. Wait, 1604 kPa is 1.604 MPa, right? Because 1000 kPa is 1 MPa. So that makes sense.

Wait, are there any other options close to this? Let me look. Option A is 1504 kPa, which is just 1.504 MPa. But wait, that would be if atmospheric was 104 kPa and gauge 1.4 MPa? No, in this case, the gauge is 1.5 MPa, so adding 104 to 1500 gives 1604. So option C is 1.604 MPa, which matches.

I think that's right. So the absolute pressure is simply the sum of the two. So the answer should be option C.

To calculate the absolute pressure, we add the gauge pressure to the barometric (atmospheric) pressure. The gauge pressure is given as 1.5 MPa (which is equivalent to 1500 kPa), and the atmospheric pressure is 104 kPa. Adding these together:

\[
\text{Absolute Pressure} = 1500 \, \text{kPa} + 104 \, \text{kPa} = 1604 \, \text{kPa} = 1.604 \, \text{MPa}.
\]

Among the options provided, the correct answer is **C: 1.604 MPa**.
