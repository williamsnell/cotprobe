Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is to construct a complete truth table for the given argument and determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the options provided.

The argument is presented as:
~A · ~B
(A ∨ C) ∨ B
/ C

Hmm, I think that's supposed to be a logical argument with premises and a conclusion. So the first line is the first premise, the second line the second premise, and the conclusion is C.

Wait, no, actually, looking again, the structure might be different. In symbolic logic, arguments are often written with premises separated by new lines and the conclusion after a slash. So the two premises are ~A ∧ ~B and (A ∨ C) ∨ B, and the conclusion is C. So the argument is:

Premise 1: ~A ∧ ~B
Premise 2: (A ∨ C) ∨ B
Conclusion: C

Wait, but in that case, when I construct the truth table, I need to see if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If that's the case in all possible scenarios, the argument is valid. Otherwise, it's invalid, and a counterexample would be a situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is false.

So first, I need to construct a truth table for all possible truth values of A, B, and C. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

Let me list them out:

1. A=T, B=T, C=T
2. A=T, B=T, C=F
3. A=T, B=F, C=T
4. A=T, B=F, C=F
5. A=F, B=T, C=T
6. A=F, B=T, C=F
7. A=F, B=F, C=T
8. A=F, B=F, C=F

Now, for each row, I'll compute the truth values of the premises and the conclusion.

Let's go step by step.

Row 1: A=T, B=T, C=T

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → F ∧ F → F
Premise2: (A∨C)∨B → (T∨T)∨T → T∨T → T
Conclusion: C=T → T

In this case, the premises are F and T, so the argument's premises are not both true, so this row doesn't affect validity.

Row 2: A=T, B=T, C=F

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → F ∧ F → F
Premise2: (T∨F)∨T → T∨T → T
Conclusion: F

Again, premise1 is F, so premises not both true. Doesn't matter.

Row3: A=T, B=F, C=T

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → F ∧ T → F
Premise2: (T∨T)∨F → T∨F → T
Conclusion: T

Premises: F and T. So the premises aren't both true. So no effect.

Row4: A=T, B=F, C=F

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → F ∧ T → F
Premise2: (T∨F)∨F → T∨F → T
Conclusion: F

Premises: F and T. So again, doesn't matter.

Row5: A=F, B=T, C=T

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → T ∧ F → F
Premise2: (F∨T)∨T → T∨T → T
Conclusion: T

Premises: F and T. So no issue.

Row6: A=F, B=T, C=F

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → T ∧ F → F
Premise2: (F∨F)∨T → F∨T → T
Conclusion: F

Premises: F and T. So premises not both true, so conclusion can be anything.

Row7: A=F, B=F, C=T

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → T ∧ T → T
Premise2: (F∨T)∨F → T∨F → T
Conclusion: T

Here, both premises are true (T and T), and the conclusion is T. So this supports the argument's validity.

Row8: A=F, B=F, C=F

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → T ∧ T → T
Premise2: (F∨F)∨F → F∨F → F
Conclusion: F

Here, premise1 is T, premise2 is F, so the premises aren't both true. So conclusion doesn't matter.

Wait, but wait a second. The premises are ~A ∧ ~B and (A∨C)∨B. So in row8, premise1 is T, premise2 is F. So both premises can't be true at the same time except in row7.

Wait, because in row7, both premises are T. So in that case, conclusion is T. So that's good.

Wait, but are there any rows where both premises are true and the conclusion is false? Because that would make the argument invalid.

Looking through the rows, the only row where both premises are true is row7, where conclusion is also true. So in all cases where premises are true, conclusion is true. So the argument is valid.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options suggest it might be invalid. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the premises in some rows. Let me go through each row again carefully.

Row1: A=T, B=T, C=T

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B → F ∧ F → F
Premise2: (A∨C)∨B → (T∨T)∨T → T∨T → T
So premises are F and T. So not both true.

Row2: A=T, B=T, C=F

Premise1: F
Premise2: (T∨F)∨T → T∨T → T
Conclusion: F
No, but premises are F and T, so not both true.

Row3: A=T, B=F, C=T

Premise1: ~A=F, ~B=T → F ∧ T → F
Premise2: (T∨T)∨F → T∨F → T
Conclusion: T
Premises F and T → not both true.

Row4: A=T, B=F, C=F

Premise1: F
Premise2: (T∨F)∨F → T∨F → T
Conclusion: F
But premises are F and T, so not both true.

Row5: A=F, B=T, C=T

Premise1: ~A=T, ~B=F → T ∧ F → F
Premise2: (F∨T)∨T → T∨T → T
Conclusion: T
Premises F and T → not both true.

Row6: A=F, B=T, C=F

Premise1: F
Premise2: (F∨F)∨T → F∨T → T
Conclusion: F
Premises F and T → not both true.

Row7: A=F, B=F, C=T

Premise1: T ∧ T → T
Premise2: (F∨T)∨F → T∨F → T
Conclusion: T
Both premises true, conclusion true. So argument holds here.

Row8: A=F, B=F, C=F

Premise1: T ∧ T → T
Premise2: (F∨F)∨F → F∨F → F
Conclusion: F
Here, premise1 is T, premise2 is F. So premises are not both true. So conclusion doesn't matter.

Wait, so in all the rows where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. So the argument is valid. But looking at the options, option H says 'Valid', which would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, did I make a mistake in the evaluation of the premises?

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the structure of the argument. Let me check: the argument is presented as:

~A · ~B

(A ∨ C) ∨ B

/

C

So that's two premises: ~A ∧ ~B and (A ∨ C) ∨ B, and the conclusion is C.

Wait, but wait: (A ∨ C) ∨ B is equivalent to A ∨ (C ∨ B) which is the same as A ∨ B ∨ C, right? So the second premise is A ∨ B ∨ C.

So the two premises are:

1. ~A ∧ ~B

2. A ∨ B ∨ C

And the conclusion is C.

So let's re-express premise 2 as A ∨ B ∨ C.

So in that case, let me reevaluate the truth table, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

But wait, no, I think I evaluated it correctly before. Let me check the second premise in each row:

In row8, A=F, B=F, C=F.

Premise2: A∨B∨C → F∨F∨F → F.

So premise2 is F in row8.

In row7, A=F, B=F, C=T.

Premise2: F∨F∨T → T.

So in row7, both premises are true, and conclusion is T.

In any other row, when premise1 is true, which only happens when A=F and B=F, which is row7 and row8.

In row7, conclusion is T.

In row8, premise1 is T, premise2 is F. So the premises are not both true together except in row7.

Thus, in all cases where both premises are true, the conclusion is true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but that would mean the answer is H: Valid.

But let me think again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me consider the situation when A=F, B=F, and C=F.

Wait, in that case, premise1 is T, premise2 is F. So the premises are not both true. So the conclusion can be F, but since the premises aren't both true, it's irrelevant.

Another way: The argument is valid if in every possible world where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.

So if there's no possible world where premises are true and conclusion is false, the argument is valid.

From the truth table, the only world where both premises are true is when A=F, B=F, C=T. In that case, conclusion is T. Therefore, no counterexample exists, so the argument is valid.

Wait, but some of the options suggest invalid with various counterexamples. So perhaps I made a mistake in the evaluation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider if (A∨C)∨B is equivalent to A∨B∨C, which it is, but perhaps I should think of other possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe I should check the logical equivalence again.

Wait, another approach is to see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.

Given ~A ∧ ~B, which is equivalent to ~A and ~B. So A is false, B is false.

Premise2 is (A∨C)∨B. Which, since B is false (from premise1), this simplifies to A∨C.

But from premise1, A is false, so A∨C is equivalent to C. Therefore, premise2, given premise1, reduces to C.

So premise2, given premise1, is C. So the conclusion is C.

So the argument is:

If ~A ∧ ~B, and (A∨C)∨B, then C.

But given ~A ∧ ~B, (A∨C)∨B is equivalent to C. So the premises are ~A ∧ ~B and C, and the conclusion is C. So of course the conclusion follows, because it's one of the premises.

Wait, but that can't be right because premise2 is (A∨C)∨B, which when B is false, becomes A∨C. But from premise1, A is false, so A∨C is C. So premise2, under premise1, is C. So the premises are ~A ∧ ~B and C, leading to conclusion C. So of course, it's valid because premise2 gives you C when B is false.

So that makes the argument valid, so the answer is H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options suggest that some people might think it's invalid. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial truth table.

Wait, let me try another approach: using logical equivalences.

Premise1: ~A ∧ ~B

Premise2: (A ∨ C) ∨ B

Conclusion: C

We can rewrite premise2 using associativity: A ∨ (C ∨ B) → A ∨ B ∨ C.

So premise2 is A ∨ B ∨ C.

So the premises are:

1. ~A ∧ ~B

2. A ∨ B ∨ C

We can see that from premise1, ~A and ~B are both true, so A is false and B is false.

So substituting A=F and B=F into premise2, we get F ∨ F ∨ C → C.

So premise2 becomes C. So the premises are ~A ∧ ~B (which gives A=F, B=F) and C.

So the conclusion is C, which is exactly what premise2 gives us when A=F and B=F.

Therefore, the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true. So the argument is valid.

So the correct answer would be H: Valid.

But wait, looking back at the initial options, option H says "Valid", which aligns with this conclusion.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed a row where both premises are true and conclusion is false. But according to the truth table, that doesn't happen. So I think the answer is H.
</think>

To determine the validity of the argument, we construct a truth table for the premises and conclusion:

**Premises:**
1. \( \neg A \land \neg B \)
2. \( (A \lor C) \lor B \) (equivalent to \( A \lor B \lor C \))

**Conclusion:**
\( C \)

### Truth Table Analysis:
We evaluate the truth values of the premises and conclusion for all possible combinations of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) (8 rows).

| Row | \( A \) | \( B \) | \( C \) | \( \neg A \land \neg B \) | \( (A \lor C) \lor B \) | Conclusion \( C \) |
|-----|---------|---------|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| 1   | T       | T       | T       | F                        | T                        | T                  |
| 2   | T       | T       | F       | F                        | T                        | F                  |
| 3   | T       | F       | T       | F                        | T                        | T                  |
| 4   | T       | F       | F       | F                        | T                        | F                  |
| 5   | F       | T       | T       | F                        | T                        | T                  |
| 6   | F       | T       | F       | F                        | T                        | F                  |
| 7   | F       | F       | T       | T                        | T                        | T                  |
| 8   | F       | F       | F       | T                        | F                        | F                  |

### Key Observations:
1. The argument is **valid** if, in every row where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
2. The only row where both premises are true is **Row 7** (\( A = F, B = F, C = T \)).
   - In this row, the conclusion \( C = T \), which aligns with the premises.
3. There is no row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument holds in all cases.

### Logical Equivalence Analysis:
- From \( \neg A \land \neg B \), we know \( A = F \) and \( B = F \).
- Substituting \( A = F \) and \( B = F \) into \( (A \lor C) \lor B \), we get \( F \lor C \lor F \), which simplifies to \( C \).
- Thus, the second premise reduces to \( C \) under the conditions of the first premise.
- Since the conclusion \( C \) matches the simplified second premise, the argument is valid.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **valid** because in all cases where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. There is no counterexample where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
