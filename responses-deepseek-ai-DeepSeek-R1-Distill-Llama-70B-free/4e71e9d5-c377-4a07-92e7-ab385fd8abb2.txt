Alright, let me try to figure out this question. The question is about identifying the obligations of workers towards their employer. The options are A through J, but I need to pick the correct one based on the description provided.

So, the question says, "______ are the obligations of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws." I remember that in employment law, there are two main parties: the employer and the employee. Each has their own set of rights, duties, and obligations.

The key here is to determine what the obligations of the worker (employee) are called. I think it's something like employee duties or employee obligations. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Employer obligations. Wait, that's what the employer must do, not the worker. So this is the opposite of what we're looking for.

Option B: Employment laws. No, that's the broader set of rules governing employment, not specifically the worker's obligations.

Option C: Employer benefits. That refers to what the employer provides, like health insurance or bonuses. Not the worker's duties.

Option D: Employer duties. Again, this is about the employer's responsibilities, not the employee's.

Option E: Employee rights. Rights are what the employee is entitled to, like fair pay or safe working conditions. But the question is about their obligations, so this is the opposite.

Option F: Employer rights. This is about what the employer can expect, like loyalty or timely work. Wait, actually, employer rights might relate to what the employer is entitled to from the employee, but the question is phrased as the obligations of the worker, so maybe this is close, but I'm not sure.

Option G: Employee duties. Yes, this sounds right. Duties are what the employee is supposed to do, like following company policies, meeting deadlines, etc. These are based on both individual contracts and employment laws.

Option H: Employee benefits. Again, this is about what the employee receives, not what they must do.

Option I: Employee contracts. That's the agreement document itself, not the obligations arising from it.

So, putting it all together, the correct term for the obligations workers have towards their employer would be "employee duties." So the answer should be G.

The obligations of workers towards their employer are referred to as **employee duties**. These duties are established through individual employment contracts and broader employment laws, outlining what employees are expected to do, such as following company policies and meeting performance standards.

Answer: G
