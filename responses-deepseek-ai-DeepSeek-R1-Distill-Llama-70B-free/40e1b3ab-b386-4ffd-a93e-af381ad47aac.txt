Okay, so I've got this math problem here: What's the greatest common factor of 42 and 84. Hmm, I remember that the greatest common factor, or GCF, is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So I need to find the biggest number that can evenly go into both 42 and 84.

Let me think, how do I approach this? I think the best way is to list the factors of each number and then find the largest one they have in common. Or maybe use the prime factorization method. I'm a bit rusty on that, but I'll try.

Starting with 42. Let me break it down into primes. 42 divided by 2 is 21. Then 21 is 3 times 7. So the prime factors of 42 are 2, 3, and 7. So 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.

Now for 84. Let's see, 84 divided by 2 is 42. Then we already know 42 is 2 × 3 × 7. So 84 would be 2 × 2 × 3 × 7, right? So the prime factors are 2² × 3 × 7.

To find the GCF, I think you take the lowest power of all common primes. So the common primes between 42 and 84 are 2, 3, and 7. For 2, the lowest power is 2¹. For 3, it's 3¹, and for 7, it's 7¹. Multiply those together: 2 × 3 × 7 equals 42. So the GCF should be 42.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check by listing the factors. For 42, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. For 84, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84. Now, looking at both lists, the common factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. The largest of these is 42. So that matches my earlier calculation.

But wait, looking at the options given, option G is 42. But wait, another way I remember is using the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try that. The algorithm says that GCF(a,b) is the same as GCF(b, a mod b). So, here, a is 84 and b is 42. 84 mod 42 is 0, because 42 divides 84 exactly. So when the remainder is 0, the GCF is the non-zero remainder, which is 42. So that confirms it again.

So all methods point to 42 being the GCF of 42 and 84. So the correct answer should be option G.

The greatest common factor (GCF) of 42 and 84 is determined by identifying the largest number that divides both without a remainder. Using prime factorization:

- **42** breaks down into primes as \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \).
- **84** breaks down into primes as \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 7 \).

The GCF is found by taking the lowest powers of all common prime factors: \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 = 42 \).

Additionally, listing the factors of 42 and 84 confirms that the largest common factor is 42. The Euclidean algorithm also supports this, as \( 84 \mod 42 = 0 \), making the GCF 42.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: 42**.
