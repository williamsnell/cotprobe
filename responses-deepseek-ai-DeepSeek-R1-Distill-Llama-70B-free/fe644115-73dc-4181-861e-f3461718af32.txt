Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Nagel's view on absolutism. I'm trying to remember what I know about this topic. Let me think. Nagel is a philosopher, right? I think he discussed absolutism in the context of moral philosophy, maybe in ethics.

Absolutism, as I recall, is the belief that certain actions are always wrong, regardless of the circumstances. So, for example, an absolutist might say that killing is always wrong, no matter what. But wait, the question is about what Nagel clarifies absolutism as.

The question asks what absolutism is the view that we should do. The options are about preventing or avoiding murder, encouraging it, etc. So I need to connect Nagel's position to these options.

I remember that Nagel discussed the difference between absolutism and other ethical theories like consequentialism. Absolutists hold that some actions are inherently wrong and should never be done, even if the consequences might be better otherwise. For instance, an absolutist might argue that lying is always wrong, even if it would save someone's life.

In the context of murder, an absolutist would say that murder is always wrong, so we should never commit murder. Wait, but the options are about preventing or avoiding murder, not committing it. Hmm, let me read the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: only sometimes prevent murder
B: never prevent murder
C: only sometimes avoid murder
D: always encourage murder
E: consider murder as a last resort
F: encourage murder under certain circumstances
G: only sometimes encourage murder
H: avoid murder except in self-defense situations
I: avoid murder at all costs

Wait, the question is about what Nagel says absolutism is. So, if absolutism is about never doing something, like never committing murder, then the answer should reflect that. But the options here are about preventing or avoiding murder, not committing it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether we should prevent murder or not. So, an absolutist might have a stance on whether it's always right to prevent murder, or whether sometimes it's permissible not to.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me clarify: Nagelâ€™s absolutism is likely about the moral rule against murder, not about preventing it. So an absolutist would say that murder is always wrong, so we should never murder, but what about preventing others from murdering? Or perhaps it's about the moral rule that we should never commit murder, implying that we should always avoid it.

Wait, but the options don't directly mention committing murder; they talk about preventing or avoiding it. So maybe the question is about whether we should always prevent murder or sometimes not. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the moral rule against murder, so the absolutist says we should always avoid murder, meaning never do it.

Looking at the options, option I says "avoid murder at all costs," which sounds like an absolutist position. Because if you avoid murder at all costs, you never commit it, no matter what.

Alternatively, option H says "avoid murder except in self-defense." That sounds more like a non-absolutist position because it allows exceptions.

So, putting that together, Nagel clarifies that absolutism holds that we should avoid murder at all costs. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The question is about what Nagel says absolutism is. So, from what I remember, Nagel's absolutism is about the moral prohibitions, like the wrongness of killing. In his "War and Massacre" paper, he argues against the consequentialist approach and for the absolutist view that there are some actions we must not do, even to prevent worse outcomes.

So, if the question is about what absolutism is, it would be that we must avoid murder at all costs, which is option I.

Nagel's absolutism is the view that certain actions, such as murder, are always wrong and should never be committed, regardless of the circumstances. This aligns with the idea that we should avoid murder at all costs, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
