Question:

A foreign visitor was on trial for kidnapping a small child. The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?

Options:

A: Yes, the statement does not directly implicate the accused in the crime.
B: No, the statement will serve to corroborate the prosecutor's theory of the case.
C: Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.
D: Yes, the statement should be excluded because it could bias the jury.
E: Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.
F: No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.
G: Yes, the statement is hearsay and therefore inadmissible.
H: No, the statement helps establish the relationship between the accused and the child.
I: No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.

Okay, let's try to figure out this evidence question. So, the scenario is a trial where a foreign visitor is accused of kidnapping a child. The prosecutor says the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the visitor knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness who will testify that the perpetrator told them, "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in." The defense objects, and we need to determine if the court will sustain that objection.

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence. The main issue here is whether the statement is admissible or not. Let's break it down.

The statement is being offered by the prosecutor, so it's the prosecution's evidence. The defense is objecting, so we need to see why they might object and whether that objection is valid.

Looking at the statement: the perpetrator is talking about visiting the child and the parents, and mentions the luxurious house. The prosecutor's theory is that the visitor knew the child and knew the parents had money, implying that the kidnapping was for ransom or some financial gain.

So, the statement seems to support the idea that the visitor knew the family and was interested in their wealth. That would be relevant to the case because it supports the motive. 

Now, what's the objection? The defense is objecting, so possible objections could be hearsay, relevance, or maybe prejudice outweighing probative value.

Let's consider hearsay first. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the witness is testifying about what the defendant said. If the statement is being offered to show that the defendant was planning to kidnap the child for money, then it's being offered for the truth—that he intended to do something. So, it's hearsay. But wait, there's an exception for statements by a party-opponent. Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement offered against a party is not hearsay if it's the party's own statement. So, if the defendant made this statement, it's admissible as a party admission. That would mean the statement is not hearsay and thus admissible.

Alternatively, if the statement were made by someone else, then it would be hearsay, but here it's the defendant's own statement, so it's admissible under the party admission rule.

Next, relevance. The statement is about looking forward to visiting and the house being luxurious. Does that relate to the kidnapping charge? It shows the defendant's knowledge of the family's wealth, which supports the motive for kidnapping—like for ransom. So it's relevant because it tends to make the case stronger that the kidnapping was for financial gain, which the prosecutor is arguing.

So, the statement is relevant and not hearsay, so the objection shouldn't be sustained on those grounds.

Looking at the options, option A says the statement doesn't directly implicate the accused. But wait, it's the accused's own statement, which does implicate him by showing his knowledge and possible intent.

Option B says it serves to corroborate the prosecutor's theory, which seems correct. So the statement supports the theory, making B a possible correct answer.

Option C says it's irrelevant, but we just thought it's relevant, so C is incorrect.

Option D says it's excluded because it could bias the jury. While any evidence against a defendant can be prejudicial, the statement's probative value here is high because it shows the defendant's knowledge and possible motive. So the prejudice doesn't outweigh the probative value, which makes E incorrect as well.

Option F says it can come in as impeachment and as a party admission. Wait, impeachment is if the defendant takes the stand and lies, but the statement can also be a party admission. So F might be correct. But the question is whether the objection is sustained. Since the statement is admissible as a party admission, the objection would be overruled, so F suggests it's admissible, meaning the court won't sustain the objection.

Option G says it's hearsay and inadmissible, but we determined it's a party admission, so G is incorrect.

Option H says it helps establish the relationship. Yes, the statement shows the defendant knew the family, which is part of the prosecutor's case. So H is a possible answer.

Option I talks about impeachment if the accused takes the stand. While that's a possible use, the primary purpose here is to prove motive and knowledge, so I is not the main reason it's admissible.

So, looking at the options, the statement is admissible because it's a party admission and relevant to the case. Therefore, the objection should not be sustained. So the court won't sustain the objection, meaning the answer is either B, F, H, or I.

Wait, the question is whether the court will sustain the objection. If the statement is admissible, the objection is overruled, so the answer would be 'No'—the court won't sustain it. So looking at the options, B, F, H, and I all start with 'No'.

Option B: serves to corroborate. That's correct.

Option F: comes in as impeachment and party admission. Well, the primary use here is as a party admission to establish a material fact, so F is also a valid reason.

So which is the best option? The question is about whether the objection is sustained. The defense's objection is likely on hearsay or relevance grounds. Since the statement is a party admission, it's not hearsay. So the objection would be overruled, making the correct answers those that say 'No'.

Looking back, the options are:

B: No, it corroborates the theory.

F: No, it's admissible as impeachment and party admission.

H: No, it establishes the relationship.

So which one is correct?

The statement is the defendant's own statement, so it's a party admission, which is non-hearsay. Therefore, the objection based on hearsay would fail. So the correct reason is B or F.

The statement is being offered to show the defendant's knowledge of the family's wealth and his relationship with the child, which supports the motive. So it's being offered as substantive evidence, not just for impeachment. Therefore, F mentions impeachment, which is a secondary use, but the primary is as a party admission.

So the best answer is B: the statement serves to corroborate the prosecutor's theory.

Wait, but F says it can come in as a party admission. So F is also correct. But the question is whether the objection is sustained. Since the statement is admissible, the objection isn't sustained. So the answer would be B or F.

Looking again at the options:

Option B says it serves to corroborate the prosecutor's theory. That makes sense because it supports the idea that the defendant knew the parents had money and knew the child, which are key points the prosecutor is making.

Option F says it can come in as impeachment and as a party admission. While that's true, the statement's admissibility isn't dependent on the defendant testifying; it's admissible regardless as a party admission. So F is correct, but the main reason is that it's a party admission, making it admissible.

But the question is about whether the court will sustain the objection. Since the statement is admissible, the objection is overruled, so the answer is 'No', which points to options B, F, H, I.

The best fit seems to be option B because it directly addresses the statement's purpose in corroborating the theory. Alternatively, F talks about using it as a party admission, which is a correct statement about its admissibility.

Wait, the options are about why the objection is sustained or not. So the statement's admissibility depends on whether it's hearsay and whether it's relevant.

Since it's a party admission, not hearsay, so G is incorrect. It's relevant, so C is incorrect. So the possible reasons for the objection being overruled are B, F, H, I.

Between these, the statement is being used to show the defendant's knowledge and intent, which is relevant and admissible as a party admission. So F says it's a party admission, making it admissible. Therefore, F is also a correct reason.

But the options are about the court sustaining the objection. If the objection was on hearsay grounds, the court would overrule it because it's a party admission.

So the correct answer would be B, F, etc., but I need to choose between them.

Wait, option F says it can come in as impeachment if the defendant takes the stand, and as a party admission. So the statement is admissible both ways, but the primary reason is as a party admission, so F is correct in stating that it's admissible for that purpose. Therefore, the objection would not be sustained.

So the answer is either B or F. But looking at the options, B is about corroborating the theory, which is a reason to admit it. F is about the method of admissibility (party admission and impeachment). So both are correct in their reasoning.

I think the better answer is B, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, F might be correct because it correctly identifies the hearsay exception.

Wait, the question is whether the court will sustain the objection. Since the statement is admissible, the objection is overruled, so the answer starts with 'No'. So the options are B, F, H, I.

Option F says, "No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money." So that's a correct statement of the law. The statement is admissible as a party admission, so the objection is overruled.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

But earlier I thought B was correct. Now I'm confused.

Wait, let me think again. The witness's testimony is about the defendant's statement. The defense objects, probably on hearsay grounds. The statement is the defendant's own, so it's a party admission. Therefore, it's admissible. So the objection is overruled, meaning the court doesn't sustain it.

So the correct answer is that the objection is not sustained. Looking at the options, F states that it's admissible as a party admission, which is correct. So the answer is F.

But wait, the other option B says it's to corroborate the theory. That's also correct because it does support the theory. So which is more accurate?

In the context of a trial, the statement is being used as substantive evidence to prove the defendant's knowledge and intent. Therefore, it's admissible as a party admission, making option F the correct reason for overruling the objection.

So the answer is F.

The question revolves around whether the court will sustain the defense's objection to the prosecutor's witness testimony about the defendant's statement: "I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in." The defense objects, and the analysis focuses on the admissibility of this statement under the rules of evidence.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Hearsay Consideration**:  
   The statement is the defendant's own statement, offered by the prosecution. Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2), a statement offered against a party is not hearsay if it is the party's own statement. Thus, this statement qualifies as a party admission and is admissible.

2. **Relevance**:  
   The statement is relevant because it supports the prosecutor's theory that the defendant knew the child and the child's parents had money, which is central to establishing motive for the kidnapping.

3. **Prejudice vs. Probative Value**:  
   While the statement may be prejudicial, its probative value in establishing the defendant's knowledge and potential motive outweighs any potential prejudice. Therefore, the statement is not excluded on these grounds.

4. **Impeachment and Party Admission**:  
   The statement can also be used for impeachment if the defendant takes the stand, but its primary purpose here is as a party admission to establish material facts (knowledge of the child and the family's wealth).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The statement directly implicates the defendant by showing his knowledge of the child and the family's wealth, which supports the prosecutor's theory.  
- **Option B**: Correct. The statement corroborates the prosecutor's theory by providing evidence of the defendant's knowledge and potential motive.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement is relevant as it pertains to the defendant's knowledge and intent, which are central to the case.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the statement may be prejudicial, its probative value outweighs any prejudice.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The prejudice does not outweigh the probative value of the statement.  
- **Option F**: Correct. The statement is admissible as a party admission and could also be used for impeachment if the defendant testifies.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The statement is not hearsay because it is the defendant's own statement, making it admissible under FRE 801(d)(2).  
- **Option H**: Correct. The statement helps establish the relationship between the defendant and the child, supporting the prosecutor's case.  
- **Option I**: Correct but secondary. While the statement could be used for impeachment, its primary purpose is as a party admission.

### Conclusion:
The statement is admissible as a party admission and is relevant to the case. The objection is overruled because the statement is not hearsay and has significant probative value. Among the options, **Option F** provides the most accurate reasoning for the admissibility of the statement.
