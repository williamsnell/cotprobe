Question:

A homeowner was planning to construct a new pooi in her back yard. She hired a well-known pool contractor to design and construct the pool. The contractor, in turn, hired a subcontractor to dig the hole and plaster the pooi area. After the subcontractor completed his job, the contractor then hired an electrician to install the heater and wiring for the pool. While the electrician was performing his work, the wiring became disjointed and had to be replaced at a substantial expense to the homeowner. If the homeowner sues the electrician in tort to recover the damages she suffered because of this occurrence, will the homeowner prevail?

Options:

A: No, if the electrician can prove that the wiring issue was due to an unforeseen problem.
B: Yes, if the electrician did not follow the contractor's instructions.
C: No, unless the electrical wiring that became disjointed was defective.
D: No, unless the homeowner knew that the contractor had hired the electrician to perform the electrical work.
E: No, if the electrician used his best professional judgment in performing the electrical work.
F: No, if the contractor was responsible for overseeing the electrician's work.
G: No, if the subcontractor had previously damaged the wiring without the electrician's knowledge.
H: Yes, if the electrician did not have the necessary qualifications to carry out the work.
I: Yes, if the wiring became disjointed because the electrician's plans departed from established standards in the electrical industry.

Okay, so I need to tackle this multiple-choice question about tort liability. Let me read through it again and try to understand the scenario.

The situation is that a homeowner is building a pool. She hired a well-known pool contractor, who then subcontracted the digging and plastering to another company. After that, the contractor hired an electrician to install the heater and wiring. While the electrician was working, the wiring became disjointed and had to be replaced, costing the homeowner a lot. Now, the homeowner is suing the electrician in tort.

The question is whether the homeowner will prevail. The options are A through I, each presenting different conditions.

First, I should recall the basics of tort law, specifically negligence. For a negligence claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and that the breach caused the plaintiff's injury.

In this case, the electrician is the defendant. As a professional, the electrician has a duty to perform the work according to the standard of care expected in their profession. If the electrician's work fell below that standard, causing the wiring issue, then the homeowner could potentially win.

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, if the electrician can prove the problem was unforeseen. But unforeseen problems don't necessarily excuse negligence. If the electrician took proper precautions, maybe, but if the problem was due to their own negligence, this wouldn't apply.

Option B: Yes, if the electrician didn't follow the contractor's instructions. If the electrician was supposed to follow specific instructions and didn't, that could be a breach of duty. But is that the standard? Or is the duty based on professional standards regardless of instructions?

Option C: No, unless the wiring was defective. If the wiring was defective, that would imply a product liability issue, but the question is about the electrician's work, not the materials. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Option D: No, unless the homeowner knew the contractor hired the electrician. I don't think the homeowner's knowledge affects the electrician's liability. The electrician's duty is to perform competently, regardless of who hired them.

Option E: No, if the electrician used best judgment. If he used his best professional judgment but something went wrong, that might not be negligence. But if that judgment was below the standard of care, then it could still be negligence.

Option F: No, if the contractor was responsible for overseeing. The electrician, as an independent contractor, is still responsible for their own work. The contractor's oversight might affect the contractor's liability, but not the electrician's direct duty.

Option G: No, if the subcontractor damaged wiring without the electrician knowing. This goes to whether the damage was caused by someone else. If the electrician didn't know and couldn't have reasonably known, then maybe they aren't liable. But if the damage was there and they should have noticed, then it's their responsibility.

Option H: Yes, if the electrician wasn't qualified. If he wasn't qualified, that could show a breach of duty. However, the question says he was hired by the contractor, implying he's qualified. But if he actually wasn't, then maybe that's the case.

Option I: Yes, if the wiring departed from industry standards. This seems to directly address the standard of care. If the electrician's work didn't meet established standards, that's a breach of duty, leading to liability.

So, the correct answer hinges on whether the electrician met the professional standard. Option I says yes if the work departed from industry standards, which aligns with the negligence elements. The other options either introduce factors that aren't directly relevant or set conditions that don't fully capture the negligence criteria.

I think the answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the homeowner can successfully sue the electrician in tort for the damages caused by the wiring issue. To establish negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and that the breach caused the injury. The electrician, as a professional, is expected to perform their work according to the standard of care in the industry.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Unforeseen problems do not excuse negligence if the electrician failed to meet professional standards.
- **Option B**: Failing to follow instructions could indicate a breach, but the duty is based on professional standards, not just following instructions.
- **Option C**: The wiring being defective pertains to product liability, not the electrician's workmanship.
- **Option D**: The homeowner's knowledge of the subcontractor is irrelevant to the electrician's duty of care.
- **Option E**: Using best judgment does not negate liability if that judgment fell below industry standards.
- **Option F**: The contractor's oversight does not absolve the electrician of their responsibility to meet professional standards.
- **Option G**: Preexisting damage unknown to the electrician could affect causation, but the electrician is still responsible for their work.
- **Option H**: Lack of qualifications could indicate negligence, but the question implies the electrician was hired based on competence.
- **Option I**: Departing from industry standards directly breaches the duty of care, making this the most relevant condition.

The correct answer is **I**, as it directly addresses the breach of duty by failing to meet industry standards.

Answer: I
