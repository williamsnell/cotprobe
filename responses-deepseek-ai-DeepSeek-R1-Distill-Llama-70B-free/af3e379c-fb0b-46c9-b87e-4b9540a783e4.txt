Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Carens's main conclusion. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that Carens is a political philosopher who writes about immigration and justice. I think he's known for arguing in favor of more open borders from a liberal egalitarian perspective. So, his work probably challenges the idea that states can justifiably close their borders.

The question is about Carens's main conclusion regarding liberal egalitarianism and its stance on issues like immigration. The options are A through J, each presenting a different conclusion.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Liberal egalitarian objections to anticosmopolitanism do not succeed. Wait, anticosmopolitanism refers to opposition to cosmopolitanism, which is about global justice and open borders. So if Carens supports cosmopolitanism, he might argue against anticosmopolitanism. But I'm not sure if this is his main conclusion.

Option B: Carens believes that liberal egalitarianism supports closed borders and strict immigration policies. That doesn't sound right. I think Carens argues the opposite, that liberal principles support open borders.

Option C: Carens argues that liberal egalitarianism is rooted in anti-immigration sentiments. No, that doesn't fit. He's more about challenging anti-immigration stances.

Option D: Egalitarianism is founded on envy and unjustified. That seems unrelated to the main point about immigration policies.

Option E: Carens concludes that liberal egalitarianism inherently supports anti-cosmopolitanism. Again, I don't think so. He probably supports cosmopolitanism.

Option F: Carens concludes that egalitarianism is justifiable irrespective of immigration policies. Maybe, but I think his point is more about how it does support certain policies.

Option G: Carens asserts that liberal egalitarianism doesn't have a clear stance on immigration. I doubt this because his work is quite specific about promoting open borders.

Option H: Liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees. This sounds familiar. I remember something about Carens arguing that open borders are more just.

Option I: Liberal egalitarianism entails only closed borders are acceptable. No, that's the opposite of what I think he argues.

Option J: Carens suggests that liberal egalitarianism always supports open borders. This is similar to H, but H says "almost always" while J says "always." I think Carens's argument is strong but perhaps allows for some exceptions, like national security, so "almost always" seems more accurate.

So, putting it together, Carens's main conclusion is that liberal egalitarianism supports more openness towards immigrants, so the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: Liberal egalitarianism should almost always press for more openness toward immigrants and refugees.

Answer: H
