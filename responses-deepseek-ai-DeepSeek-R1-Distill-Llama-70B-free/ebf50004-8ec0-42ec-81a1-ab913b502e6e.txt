Okay, so I have this problem about liquid nitrogen and pressure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about finding the pressure needed to maintain liquid nitrogen at 85 K instead of its normal boiling point of 77 K. Oh right, the normal boiling point is the temperature at which it boils at 1 atmosphere pressure. So if we want a higher temperature, the pressure must be higher than 1 atm, because higher pressures lower the boiling point... Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you increase pressure, the boiling point actually increases. Because at higher pressure, the substance can exist as a liquid at a higher temperature. So since 85 K is higher than 77 K, the pressure must be higher than 1 atm. That makes sense.

The heat of vaporization is given as 5560 J/mol. I remember that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used for these kinds of problems. The equation relates the change in pressure and temperature for a phase transition. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2), where R is the gas constant.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I have the equation right. Alternatively, sometimes it's written using the reciprocal of temperatures. Let me think. Oh right, the correct form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] / 1. Or wait, no, the other way around. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (TΔV). But since we're dealing with a vapor-liquid equilibrium, we can approximate ΔV as the volume of vapor minus the volume of liquid, which is approximately the volume of vapor since the liquid is much denser. So ΔV ≈ V_vapor. And because the ideal gas law applies, V = nRT/P. So for one mole, V = RT/P. So ΔV is RT/P at temperature T.

So substituting, we get dP/dT = (ΔH_vap) / (T * (RT/P)) ) → simplifies to dP/dT = (ΔH_vap P) / (R T²). Integrating this gives the relation between P and T.

Alternatively, using the integrated form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1/Mw) )? Wait, no. Wait, ΔH is per mole, so the equation is correct as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The integrated form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ]

Assuming that ΔH_vap is constant over the temperature range, which it probably is for this problem.

So in this problem, P1 is the pressure at T1, which is 77 K. Since it's the normal boiling point, P1 is 1 atm. We want to find P2, the pressure when the temperature T2 is 85 K.

So substituting into the equation:

ln(P2 / 1 atm) = (5560 J/mol) / R * (1/77 - 1/85)

Wait, what's the value of R, the gas constant? Oh right, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 1/77 and 1/85. 

1/77 ≈ 0.012987 K^-1
1/85 ≈ 0.011765 K^-1

The difference is 0.012987 - 0.011765 = 0.001222 K^-1.

Then, the term (ΔH_vap / R) is 5560 / 8.314 ≈ let me calculate that.

5560 divided by 8.314. Let's see: 8.314 * 600 is about 4988.4. 5560 - 4988.4 is 571.6. 571.6 /8.314 is approximately 68.75. So total is about 668.75.

Wait, wait, wait: 8.314 * 668 = let's compute 8 * 668 = 5344, 0.314 *668≈210 → 5344+210=5554. So 8.314 * 668 ≈ 5554. So 5560 is about 668. So 5560 /8.314 ≈ approx 668. So, (ΔH/R) ≈ 668.

So then, the product is 668 * 0.001222 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.001222 * 668 → 668 * 0.001 = 0.668, 668 *0.000222= approx 0.148. So total is about 0.668 +0.148=0.816.

So ln(P2) = 0.816 → because ln(P2/1) is ln(P2).

Wait, wait, wait, no. Because ln(P2/P1) is 0.816. Since P1 is 1 atm, ln(P2/1) = ln(P2) = 0.816.

So solving for P2, P2 = e^0.816.

What is e^0.8? I remember that e^0.7≈2.0138, e^0.8≈2.2255, e^0.85≈2.34, etc. So 0.816 is a bit higher than 0.8. Let me compute e^0.816.

Using a calculator would help, but since I don't have one, I'll approximate. Alternatively, maybe I can use a Taylor expansion, but that might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, 0.816 is 0.8 + 0.016.

We know that e^0.8 ≈ 2.2255.

The derivative of e^x is e^x, so for a small delta_x, e^(x + delta_x) ≈ e^x (1 + delta_x).

So delta_x is 0.016. So e^(0.816) ≈ e^0.8 * (1 + 0.016) → 2.2255 * 1.016.

2.2255 * 1.016 → 2.2255 *1=2.2255; 2.2255 *0.016= ~0.0356. So total is approximately 2.2611.

So P2 ≈ 2.26 atm.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.26 atm. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the equation. Wait, in the equation, it's (1/T1 - 1/T2). Because T2 > T1, 1/T1 is bigger than 1/T2, so the difference is positive. Which makes the right side positive, so ln(P2) is positive, so P2 is greater than 1, which matches our earlier conclusion that higher pressure is needed for higher temperature.

So yes, using the equation correctly. So the calculation seems correct.

To determine the pressure required to maintain liquid nitrogen at 85 K, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in its integrated form:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Here:
- \(P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm}\) (pressure at the normal boiling point, \(T_1 = 77 \, \text{K}\)),
- \(T_2 = 85 \, \text{K}\) (desired temperature),
- \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 5560 \, \text{J/mol}\) (heat of vaporization),
- \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}\) (gas constant).

### Step 1: Calculate the temperature reciprocals
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{77} \approx 0.012987 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{85} \approx 0.011765 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.012987 - 0.011765 = 0.001222 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R}\)
\[
\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} = \frac{5560}{8.314} \approx 668
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(\ln(P_2)\)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{1}\right) = \ln(P_2) = 668 \cdot 0.001222 \approx 0.816
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \(P_2\)
\[
P_2 = e^{0.816}
\]
Approximating \(e^{0.816}\):
\[
e^{0.816} \approx 2.26 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The pressure required to maintain liquid nitrogen at 85 K is approximately **2.26 atm**, which corresponds to **option B**.
