Okay, so I have this economics question here about how an increase in the price of imported forklifts affects two specific measures: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the GDP deflator. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should remember what each of these indicators measures. The CPI is a measure of the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households. So it's focused on what consumers buy. On the other hand, the GDP deflator is a broader measure that looks at the average price change of all goods and services produced within the economy, including those used for investment, government purchases, and exports.

Now, the question is about an increase in the price of forklifts imported from Belgium. Forklifts are machinery, so they're capital goods, right? Businesses use them for moving goods around, so they're probably part of investment spending rather than consumer spending.

Let me break this down. If the price of imported forklifts goes up, businesses in the US that buy these forklifts will face higher costs. But since these forklifts are investment goods, their prices don't directly affect the CPI. The CPI tracks consumer goods and services, so unless the increased cost of forklifts somehow trickles down to consumer prices—like if companies pass on their increased costs by raising the prices of their products—then CPI might be affected. But that's not a direct effect, more of an indirect one, and the question is about the immediate impact.

Now looking at the GDP deflator. It includes all goods and services produced within the economy. Wait, but these forklifts are imported, so they're not produced domestically. Hmm, does that matter? Or does the GDP deflator consider the price changes of all goods and services that are part of the country's expenditure, regardless of where they're produced?

Wait, no, the GDP deflator is calculated based on domestically produced goods and services. Because GDP is the total value of production within the country. So imports aren't included in GDP. So if the price of an imported good goes up, it doesn't directly affect the GDP deflator because that good isn't part of domestic production. But wait, in the expenditure approach, GDP includes imports as part of the total spending, but when calculating the deflator, it's applied to the domestic production.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The GDP deflator is the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP. Nominal GDP includes all expenditures, including imports. But when calculating real GDP, imports are subtracted as part of the net exports. So how does that affect the deflator?

Alternatively, maybe the GDP deflator is calculated as (Nominal GDP)/(Real GDP), where Real GDP is calculated using base year prices. So, if the prices of imports go up, it would affect the nominal GDP because when you calculate nominal GDP, you include the actual prices, including imports. But when calculating real GDP, you adjust for price changes using the GDP deflator. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Let me try a different approach. The CPI includes all goods and services bought by consumers, regardless of where they're produced. So if the imported forklifts are used by businesses, their prices wouldn't directly affect CPI unless the cost increase leads to higher consumer prices elsewhere. But the question is about the direct effect, I think.

So in this case, forklifts are not consumer goods, so their price increase doesn't affect CPI. As for the GDP deflator, since the forklifts are imported, they don't contribute to domestic production. So their price changes aren't part of the GDP deflator either. Wait, but I'm not so sure about that. Because when the US imports more expensive forklifts, the total expenditure on imports increases, which would affect nominal GDP. So the GDP deflator, which is nominal GDP over real GDP, would be influenced by higher import prices.

Wait, but real GDP is in constant prices, so changes in import prices would affect nominal GDP but not real GDP. So if the import prices go up, nominal GDP would increase, making the GDP deflator (which is nominal/real) also increase, assuming real GDP doesn't change.

Wait, but real GDP is calculated by using the GDP deflator. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify:

Nominal GDP = sum of all expenditures at current prices, including imports.

Real GDP = sum of all expenditures adjusted for inflation, using base year prices.

GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100.

So if the price of imported forklifts increases, the nominal GDP would increase because the expenditure on imports is higher. But real GDP would not be affected because it's measured in constant prices. So the GDP deflator would increase because nominal is up and real is same. So the deflator would go up.

But wait, the forklifts are imports, so when calculating real GDP, imports are subtracted (as part of net exports), but their price changes would still affect the nominal value, thus the deflator.

So in this scenario, the price increase in imported forklifts would increase the GDP deflator because it affects nominal GDP. But it wouldn't affect the CPI because CPI only includes consumer goods, not capital goods like forklifts.

So looking back at the options:

Option A: Both increase. But earlier I thought CPI might not be affected directly.

Option B: CPI increases, GDP deflator doesn't. No, because GDP deflator would increase.

Option C: GDP deflator increases, CPI doesn't. That seems right.

Option D: No effect on either. No, because GDP deflator would be affected.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the CPI wouldn't be affected because forklifts aren't consumer goods. So the correct answer would be C: increase the GDP deflator but not the CPI.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the GDP deflator includes imports in the nominal GDP. So when imports get more expensive, nominal GDP increases, thus the deflator increases.

So the answer is option A or C.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the forklifts are imported, their price changes affect the import component in the nominal GDP. So nominal GDP increases, which increases the GDP deflator. But since they're not part of the CPI basket, the CPI doesn't change. So the correct answer would be C: increases the GDP deflator but not the CPI.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is C.

An increase in the price of forklifts imported into the United States from Belgium will have different effects on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the GDP deflator due to their distinct focuses.

The CPI measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households. Since forklifts are capital goods used by businesses and not consumer goods, their price increase does not directly affect the CPI. Indirect effects, such as businesses passing on higher costs to consumers, are possible but not the primary focus of the question.

On the other hand, the GDP deflator is a broader measure that reflects the average price change of all goods and services included in nominal GDP, which includes imports. An increase in the price of imported forklifts would raise the nominal GDP, thereby increasing the GDP deflator, as real GDP (measured in constant prices) remains unaffected.

Given this analysis:
- The CPI is not directly affected because forklifts are not consumer goods.
- The GDP deflator is affected because the price increase impacts nominal GDP.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: increase the GDP deflator but not the consumer price index.

Answer: C
