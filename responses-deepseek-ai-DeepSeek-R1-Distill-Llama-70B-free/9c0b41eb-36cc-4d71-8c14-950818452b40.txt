Okay, so I've got this economics question here about investment demand. Hmm, I need to figure out when investment demand increases. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Investment demand... I think it's related to businesses investing in capital, like new machines, buildings, or technology. So what factors make businesses want to invest more? I remember something about interest rates and expectations.

Wait, the question gives options from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Stock market downturn. If the stock market is down, maybe businesses can't raise as much money through stocks, so they might invest less. Or maybe investors feel poorer and spend less. Not sure, but I think a downturn might decrease investment.

Option B: Inflation rates rise. Inflation eats into profits if companies can't pass on costs. Higher inflation might make the real interest rate go up because nominal rates include inflation. So if real interest is higher, borrowing is more expensive, which could reduce investment. Or maybe if inflation is high, people expect more inflation, which affects things differently. I'm not too sure about this one.

Option C: Real rate of interest rises. Oh wait, the real interest rate is what matters for investment decisions. If the real rate goes up, it's more expensive for businesses to borrow. So higher interest rates should decrease investment, right? Because the cost of capital increases. So if option C says the real rate rises, investment demand would decrease. So this option wouldn't be the answer.

Option D: Economy enters a recession. During a recession, sales are down, so businesses probably won't invest much. They might even cut back on investments. So this would decrease investment demand, not increase.

Option E: Global economic instability is high. Uncertainty makes businesses hesitant to invest. They might wait until things stabilize, so investment would decrease here. So E isn't the right answer.

Option F: Government regulation increases. More regulations can make it harder or more expensive to operate, which might reduce investment as businesses face higher costs or more hurdles. So F would decrease investment.

Option G: Unemployment rates increase. Higher unemployment might mean less consumer spending, leading to lower business sales. That could reduce investment as companies don't see the need to expand. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: Cost of acquiring and maintaining capital equipment rises. If it's more expensive to get machinery, etc., businesses would invest less. So H would decrease investment demand.

Option I: Real GDP decreases. If the economy is shrinking (lower real GDP), businesses are likely to reduce investment because demand for their products is down. So I wouldn't be the answer.

Option J: Investor optimism improves. Oh, right! If investors are more optimistic about the future, they expect higher returns on investments. So businesses are more likely to invest when people are optimistic because they anticipate better profits. That makes sense. So J would increase investment demand.

Wait, let me double-check. The real interest rate (option C) going up would lower investment because borrowing is more costly. So C is bad for investment. Conversely, if the real interest rate falls, investment increases. But the question is when does investment demand increase, so the correct answer should be when something makes businesses want to invest more.

Yes, so option J is about investor optimism. When optimism is high, businesses are more confident in future prospects, so they invest more. That definitely sounds right.

Investment demand increases when investor optimism improves. This is because higher optimism leads to greater confidence in future profitability, encouraging businesses to invest more in capital and expansion.
