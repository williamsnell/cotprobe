Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about a measure of a firm's monopoly pricing or market power. The question asks which option correctly represents such a measure, where a larger value means greater market power. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that there's a specific index used for this purpose. I think it's called the Lerner Index. Let me try to recall what that is.

So, Lerner Index, as I remember, measures a firm's market power. It's calculated by taking the difference between price (P) and marginal cost (MC), then dividing by the price. Oh wait, so the formula is (P - MC)/P. That makes sense because if a firm has a lot of market power, it can set a price much higher than its marginal cost. So the numerator would be larger, and since the denominator is the price, a higher ratio indicates more power.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. Option A is (P - MC)/MC squared. That doesn't seem right because the denominator should be P. Option B is (P - MC squared)/P. Wait, that's P minus MC squared, which doesn't fit the formula. Option C is (MC - P)/MC. That's negative of (P - MC)/MC, which isn't the Lerner Index. Plus, the denominator isn't P.

Option D is (MC - P)/MC squared. Still the same issue as C, and the denominator is squared. So no. Option E is (MC - P)/P squared. Again, wrong numerator and denominator. F is (P squared - MC)/P. That's (P - MC/P), which isn't the same as the index. G is (MC - P)/P. That's negative of (P - MC)/P, which would flip the sign. So if the index is positive when P>MC, G would be negative, which isn't correct.

Option H is (P - MC)/MC. Oh, wait, that's the same numerator as Lerner but the denominator is MC. I think this is called the markup, but not the Lerner Index. Because the Lerner Index divides by P, not MC. So H isn't the correct measure for market power as per the question.

Option I is (MC squared - P)/MC. That's different and doesn't fit. Option J is (P - MC)/P. Oh wait, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier! So J matches the Lerner Index formula. 

Wait, but let me make sure. The Lerner Index is (P - MC)/P, which equals 1 - (MC/P). So yes, J is correct.

I think I got it. The correct answer should be option J.

The question asks which option represents a measure of a firm's monopoly pricing or market power, where a larger value indicates greater market power. The correct measure for this is the Lerner Index, which is calculated as:

\[
\text{Lerner Index} = \frac{P - MC}{P}
\]

This formula measures the extent to which a firm can set its price above its marginal cost, with a higher value indicating greater market power. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \((P - MC)/MC^2\) — Incorrect, as the denominator should be \(P\), not \(MC^2\).
- **Option B**: \((P - MC^2)/P\) — Incorrect, as it subtracts \(MC^2\) instead of \(MC\).
- **Option C**: \((MC - P)/MC\) — Incorrect, as it flips the numerator and divides by \(MC\) instead of \(P\).
- **Option D**: \((MC - P)/MC^2\) — Incorrect for the same reasons as C.
- **Option E**: \((MC - P)/P^2\) — Incorrect, as it flips the numerator and divides by \(P^2\).
- **Option F**: \((P^2 - MC)/P\) — Incorrect, as it does not match the Lerner Index formula.
- **Option G**: \((MC - P)/P\) — Incorrect, as it flips the numerator.
- **Option H**: \((P - MC)/MC\) — Incorrect, as it divides by \(MC\) instead of \(P\).
- **Option I**: \((MC^2 - P)/MC\) — Incorrect, as it does not match the Lerner Index formula.
- **Option J**: \((P - MC)/P\) — Correct, as it matches the Lerner Index formula.

The correct answer is **Option J**, as it accurately represents the Lerner Index, which measures a firm's market power.
