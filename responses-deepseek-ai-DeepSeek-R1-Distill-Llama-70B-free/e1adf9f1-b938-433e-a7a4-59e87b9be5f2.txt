Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research, specifically in tracing the pathways of compounds synthesized in living cells. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that radioactive isotopes are used for tracking in biological systems. I think they can act as tracers because they emit radiation that can be detected. So if a compound is labeled with a radioactive isotope, scientists can follow its path through the cell or organism. Like, maybe they introduce a compound with a radioactive marker into a cell and then see where it goes or how it's metabolized.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which makes sense.

Option A says labeling with isotopes is a powerful method for studying metabolic pathways and other areas. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option B is about improving food flavor and texture. I don't think that's right. Maybe radiation is used for food irradiation to kill pests or extend shelf life, but that's not about isotopes in biological pathways.

Option C mentions stimulating the immune system. Not sure how isotopes would do that. Maybe some medical uses, but not directly related to tracing pathways.

Option D talks about increasing oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. That sounds more like something related to hemoglobin or red blood cells, perhaps using iron supplements, but not isotopes.

Option E is about enhancing agricultural crops. Maybe through mutation breeding using radiation, but again, that's different from tracing compounds in a cell.

Option F is using isotopes as nutrient supplements. Wait, some isotopes are used in research as tracers, but not as supplements. Like, maybe in nutrient uptake studies, but not as direct supplements.

Option G says they're used for glow-in-the-dark materials. That's more about luminescence, not biological tracing.

Option H is for spacecraft energy. That's a different application, like nuclear batteries or something.

Option I is about killing cancer cells, which relates to radiation therapy. But the question is about tracing pathways, not killing cells.

Option J is for dating archaeological samples, like carbon dating, which is a common use but not biological tracing in living cells.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be A because it directly relates to using isotopes as tracers in metabolic pathways.

The correct answer is A because radioactive isotopes are used to label substances, allowing researchers to trace the pathways of compounds synthesized in living cells and study specific metabolic processes. This method is widely applicable in biological research for understanding various biochemical pathways and mechanisms.

Answer: A
