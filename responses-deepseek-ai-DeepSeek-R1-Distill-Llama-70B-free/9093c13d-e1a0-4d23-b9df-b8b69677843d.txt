Question:

Define a hormone. How would you go about proving that a particular gland is responsible for a specific function?

Options:

A: A hormone is a type of organ
B: A hormone is a type of tissue
C: A hormone is an electrical signal sent through the nervous system to communicate between different parts of the body.
D: A hormone is a mineral that is involved in maintaining the balance of water in the body.
E: A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood.
F: A hormone is a structural protein that makes up the components of muscles and tissues.
G: A hormone is a digestive enzyme that breaks down food in the stomach and intestines.
H: A hormone is a type of vitamin that the body needs in small amounts to function properly.
I: A hormone is a type of cell
J: A hormone is a biological molecule that remains within the organ it is produced in and affects only that specific organ.

Okay, so I have this question about hormones and how to prove a gland is responsible for a specific function. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question has two parts. The first part is defining a hormone. I remember that hormones are chemicals, right? They're produced by glands or organs and they help regulate different bodily functions. So they must be some sort of chemical messenger.

Looking at the options for the definition:

Option A says a hormone is a type of organ. No, that can't be right because organs are much larger structures. Like the pancreas is an organ, but it produces hormones like insulin.

Option B is a type of tissue. Tissues are groups of cells, but hormones are individual chemicals, so that's not it either.

Option C describes an electrical signal in the nervous system. Wait, that sounds more like neurotransmitters or action potentials. Hormones are part of the endocrine system, which is separate from the nervous system, though they can work together.

Option D is a mineral involved in water balance. Minerals are like electrolytes, such as sodium or potassium. Those are more related to ion balance, not hormones.

Option E says a hormone is a chemical substance made by an organ or tissue and secreted into blood. That rings a bell. Hormones are indeed chemicals, like insulin or adrenaline, made by glands and released into the bloodstream.

Option F is a structural protein for muscles. Structural proteins are like collagen or keratin, not hormones.

Option G is a digestive enzyme. Those break down food, like amylase or lipase. Again, different function.

Option H is a vitamin. Vitamins are nutrients, not produced by the body, so that's not it.

Option I is a type of cell. No, a hormone isn't a cell; it's a molecule.

Option J says it's a molecule that stays in the organ and affects only that organ. Wait, no, hormones are released into the blood to affect distant organs, like how insulin from the pancreas affects liver and muscles.

So the correct definition must be option E.

Now, the second part is about proving a gland is responsible for a specific function. I think this involves experiments showing cause and effect. Like, if the gland is removed (extirpation), does the function stop? Then, if you add back the hormone, does the function return? Also, maybe using bioassays or showing that the gland produces the hormone.

But wait, the question asks how to go about proving it. So the steps could involve:

1. Observing the effect when the gland is removed (if function is lost).
2. Isolating the substance from the gland.
3. Administering that substance to see if it restores the function.
4. Possibly using modern techniques like radioactive tracing to see where the hormone acts.

So putting it all together, the best answer for the first part is E, and the method would involve these experimental steps to link the gland's secretion to the specific function.

To answer the question, we first identify the correct definition of a hormone. A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood to regulate various bodily functions. This matches option E.

To prove that a particular gland is responsible for a specific function, one would conduct experiments such as removing the gland (extirpation) to observe if the function ceases, isolating the suspected hormone, and administering it to see if the function is restored. This establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the gland and the function.
