Okay, so I've got this Python question here. Let me see. The question is, if x is 1, what is x << 3 in Python 3? Hmm, I remember that << is the bitwise left shift operator. Oh right, shifting bits to the left. 

Wait, how does that work again? So when you shift a number left by n bits, it's like multiplying it by 2^n. Oh right, because each shift to the left doubles the number. Like, 1 shifted left once is 2, twice is 4, and so on. 

So x is 1. Shifting that left by 3 places. Let me calculate that. 1 shifted left by 3 is 1 * 2^3. 2^3 is 8, right? So 1 times 8 is 8. 

Let me think about the options. The options are A to J. Option C is 8, so that should be the correct answer. I don't think I'm missing anything here. It's a straightforward left shift.

The operation `x << 3` in Python performs a bitwise left shift, which is equivalent to multiplying `x` by `2^3`. Since `x = 1`, the result is `1 * 8 = 8`.

Answer: C
