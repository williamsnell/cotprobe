Okay, so I've got this double integral problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with double integrals yet. But I'll give it a shot.

The function is f(x,y) = x * y^3 * exp(x² + y²), and I'm supposed to integrate this over the square I = [0,1] x [0,1]. So the integral is ∫ from 0 to 1 ∫ from 0 to 1 of x y³ e^(x² + y²) dx dy. Hmm.

Wait, double integrals can sometimes be split into the product of two single integrals if the variables are separable. Let me see if I can separate x and y terms here. The function is x * y³ * e^(x²) * e^(y²). Because e^(x² + y²) is e^(x²) * e^(y²). So that's helpful because each part depends only on x or y.

So the integral becomes [∫ from 0 to1 x e^(x²) dx ] * [∫ from 0 to1 y³ e^(y²) dy ]. That's great because I can compute each integral separately.

Let me handle the x integral first. Let me set u = x². Then du/dx = 2x, so (du)/2 = x dx. So when x=0, u=0; x=1, u=1. The integral ∫ x e^(x²) dx from 0 to1 becomes ∫ e^u * (du/2) from 0 to1. That's (1/2) ∫ e^u du from 0 to1. Which is (1/2)(e^1 - e^0) = (1/2)(e -1). Okay, that's straightforward.

Now the y integral: ∫ y³ e^(y²) dy from 0 to1. Hmm, y³ can be written as y * y². Maybe a substitution would work here. Let me try u = y². Then du/dy = 2y, so y dy = du/2. Wait, but I have y³ dy = y² * y dy. So substituting, that would be u * (du/2). So the integral becomes ∫ u e^u (du/2) from u=0 to u=1.

So that's (1/2) ∫ u e^u du from 0 to1. Integration by parts is needed here. Let me set v = u, dw = e^u du. Then dv = du, w = e^u. So ∫ v dw = v w - ∫ w dv = u e^u - ∫ e^u du = u e^u - e^u + C.

Evaluating from 0 to1: [1*e^1 - e^1] - [0*e^0 - e^0] = (e - e) - (0 -1) = 0 - (-1) = 1. Wait, but wait, that's without the 1/2 factor. So the whole integral is (1/2)(1) = 1/2.

Wait, let's double-check that. The integral ∫ y³ e^(y²) dy from 0 to1. Sub u=y², du=2y dy. So y³ dy = (y²)(y dy) = u*(du/2). So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ u e^u du from 0 to1. Which is (1/2)[u e^u - e^u] from 0 to1.

At u=1: (1*e^1 - e^1) = 0. At u=0: (0 - 1) = -1. So [0 - (-1)] =1. So (1/2)(1) = 1/2. Yep, that's correct.

So putting it all together, the double integral is (1/2)(e -1) * (1/2) ) = (e-1)/4.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the x integral was (1/2)(e-1), and the y integral was 1/2. So multiplying them gives (1/2)(e-1) * (1/2) = (e-1)/4.

Now I need to compute (e-1)/4 numerically because the options are all numbers. e is approximately 2.71828, so e-1 is about 1.71828. Divided by 4: 0.42957. Let me check that: 1.71828 /4. Yes, 4*0.4295 is about 1.718. So approximately 0.4295.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.4295. So the answer should be B.

To solve the double integral of the function \( f(x,y) = x y^3 e^{x^2 + y^2} \) over the square \( I = [0,1] \times [0,1] \), we first note that the integrand can be separated into terms involving only \( x \) and \( y \). This allows us to express the double integral as the product of two single integrals:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^1 x y^3 e^{x^2 + y^2} \, dx \, dy = \left( \int_0^1 x e^{x^2} \, dx \right) \cdot \left( \int_0^1 y^3 e^{y^2} \, dy \right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute the \( x \)-integral
For the \( x \)-integral, we use the substitution \( u = x^2 \), so \( du = 2x \, dx \) or \( x \, dx = \frac{du}{2} \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( x = 0 \), \( u = 0 \); when \( x = 1 \), \( u = 1 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^1 x e^{x^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 e^u \, du = \frac{1}{2} \left[ e^u \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2} (e - 1).
\]

### Step 2: Compute the \( y \)-integral
For the \( y \)-integral, we use the substitution \( u = y^2 \), so \( du = 2y \, dy \) or \( y \, dy = \frac{du}{2} \). The limits of integration remain the same: when \( y = 0 \), \( u = 0 \); when \( y = 1 \), \( u = 1 \). Rewriting \( y^3 e^{y^2} \, dy \) in terms of \( u \), we get:

\[
\int_0^1 y^3 e^{y^2} \, dy = \int_0^1 y^2 \cdot y e^{y^2} \, dy = \int_0^1 u \cdot \frac{du}{2} e^u = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 u e^u \, du.
\]

To evaluate \( \int u e^u \, du \), we use integration by parts with \( v = u \) and \( dw = e^u \, du \), so \( dv = du \) and \( w = e^u \). This gives:

\[
\int u e^u \, du = u e^u - \int e^u \, du = u e^u - e^u + C.
\]

Evaluating from \( u = 0 \) to \( u = 1 \):

\[
\left[ u e^u - e^u \right]_0^1 = \left( 1 \cdot e^1 - e^1 \right) - \left( 0 \cdot e^0 - e^0 \right) = (e - e) - (0 - 1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the \( y \)-integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Combine the results
The double integral is the product of the two single integrals:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{2} (e - 1) \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{4} (e - 1).
\]

### Step 4: Compute the numerical value
Using \( e \approx 2.71828 \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{4} (e - 1) = \frac{1}{4} (2.71828 - 1) = \frac{1.71828}{4} \approx 0.42957.
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is **B: 0.4295**.
