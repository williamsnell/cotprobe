Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the differences in social networks between older and younger adults. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking what's true about older adults' social networks compared to younger ones. The options are A through J, each describing different aspects like size, frequency of communication, dispersion, etc.

I remember reading somewhere that as people age, their social circles tend to change. I think it's something to do with the socioemotional selectivity theory. From what I recall, this theory suggests that older adults prioritize meaningful, closer relationships over a larger number of acquaintances. So they might have smaller, more intimate social circles.

Wait, but wait. I'm not sure if it's the inner circle that's smaller or the overall network. Oh right, I think older adults actually have smaller overall networks. They might have fewer friends and acquaintances, but the ones they do have are closer. So maybe their inner circles are more stable, but the outer circles are smaller.

Looking at the options, option C says "Smaller networks overall." That seems to fit because older adults might have fewer people in their network as they age. Option E says "Smaller inner circles," which contradicts because I thought their inner circles might stay the same or even be more prioritized, but perhaps the overall number is smaller.

Alternatively, another angle: younger people are often building their social networks—like in school, college, new jobs—so they might have larger networks with more acquaintances. Older adults, after retirement, might have less opportunity to meet new people, so their networks shrink.

So the correct answer would be that older adults have smaller networks overall. Looking at the options again, option C is "Smaller networks overall." So I think that's the right choice.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that older adults tend to have smaller social networks overall compared to younger adults. This aligns with socioemotional selectivity theory, which suggests that older adults prioritize meaningful relationships, leading to a reduction in the overall size of their social networks as they age.

Answer: C
