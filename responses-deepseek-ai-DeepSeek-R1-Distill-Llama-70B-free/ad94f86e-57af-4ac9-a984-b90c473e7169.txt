Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of molecules of phosgene gas. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, I remember that these kinds of problems usually involve converting mass to moles and then using Avogadro's number to find molecules. But wait, let me make sure I get the steps right.

The problem says that the mass of phosgene is 1.1 × 10^8 kg. Oh, wait, kilograms. I think I should convert that to grams because molar masses are usually in grams per mole. Oh right, because 1 kg is 1000 grams. So 1.1e8 kg times 1000 g/kg gives me 1.1e11 grams. That makes sense.

Next, I need the molar mass of phosgene, which is CCl2O. Let me break that down. Carbon (C) is about 12 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and chlorine (Cl) is around 35.5 g/mol each. So adding them up: 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 2*(35.5) for the two Cl atoms. Let me calculate that.

12 + 16 is 28, and 35.5 times two is 71. So 28 plus 71 is 99 g/mol. So the molar mass is 99 grams per mole.

Now, using the formula: moles = mass / molar mass. So that's 1.1e11 grams divided by 99 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1.1e11 divided by 99 is approximately 1.111...e9 moles. Wait, because 99 is roughly 100, and 1e11 divided by 1e2 is 1e9. So the exact value would be slightly higher than 1.1e9 / 99? Wait wait, 1.1e11 divided by 99 is about 1.111e9, because 99*1.1e9 is 1.089e11, which is close to 1.1e11. Alternatively, 1e11 / 99 is approximately 1.01e9. Hmm, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 99 times 1.111e9 equals 99*(1.111e9) → 99 * 1e9 is 9.9e10, and 99*0.111e9 is about 0.10989e10, adding them gives 1.00989e11, which is close to 1.1e11. So 1.1e11 /99 ≈ 1.111e9 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 1.1e11 divided by 99 correctly. 1.1e11 is 110,000,000,000 grams. Divided by 99 g/mol. So 110e9 /99 ≈ approximately 1.111e9 moles.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate it exactly. 110,000,000,000 / 99 = let's see. 99 * 1.111e9 = 99 * 1,111,111,111 = 1.1e11, so yes, the moles are approximately 1.111e9.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's see: 1e11 grams is 10^11 g. 10^11 / 99 = approx 1.0101e9. So 1.1e11 would be 1.1 * (1e11 /99) → 1.1 * 1.0101e9 → approximately 1.111e9 moles. So moles ≈ 1.111e9.

Now, each mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So the total number of molecules is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number.

So 1.111e9 moles * 6.022e23 molecules/mol = let's compute that.

1.111e9 * 6.022e23 = (1.111 * 6.022) * 1e32 (since 1e9 * 1e23 is 1e32).

Calculating 1.111 *6.022. Let me compute that.

1 *6.022 is 6.022, 0.111 *6.022 is approx 0.668. So total is approximately 6.022 + 0.668 = 6.69 approximately.

Wait, more accurately: 1.111 *6.022.

1.111 * 6 = 6.666, 1.111 * 0.022 = 0.0244 (because 1*0.022=0.022, 0.111 *0.022 ≈ 0.00244). So 0.022 + 0.00244 → 0.02444. So 6.666 + 0.02444 = 6.69044. So approximately 6.69044e32 molecules.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check: 1.1e8 kg is 1.1e11 grams. Divided by 99 g/mol gives moles. So 1.1e11 /99 is 1.111e9. Multiply by 6.022e23 → 6.690e32 molecules.

But looking at the options, option F is 6.6 × 10^32 molecules. That's the same as what I got. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make a mistake.

Wait, the problem says 1.1 × 10^8 kg. So 1.1e8 kg = 1.1e8 * 1e3 g = 1.1e11 g. Correct. Molar mass of CCl2O: C=12, O=16, Cl=35.5 each. So 12+16=28, 35.5 *2=71 → 28+71=99 g/mol. Correct.

Moles = 1.1e11 g /99 g/mol = approx 1.111e9 mol. Correct.

Multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23): 1.111e9 * 6.022e23 = (1.111 *6.022) * 1e32 → 6.69e32. So option F is 6.6 ×10^32, which matches.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me compute 1.1e11 /99 more accurately.

1.1e11 /99 = (1.1 /99 ) * 1e11.

1.1 /99 → 99 goes into 1.1 about 0.0111... times. Because 99 *0.0111 = approx 1.1.

So 0.0111 *1e11 = 1.11e9. So yes, 1.11e9 moles.

So 1.11e9 *6.022e23 = 1.11 *6.022 = 6.6842 → 6.6842e32.

Which is approximately 6.68e32. The option F is 6.6e32, which is close. So the correct answer is F.

But wait, let me look at the options again. Option F is 6.6 ×10^32. So yeah, that's the one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be precise with the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 1.1e11 /99 exactly.

99 × 1.111111e9 = 99 *1,111,111,111 = let's compute.

1,111,111,111 *100 = 111,111,111,100.

Minus 1,111,111,111: which is 111,111,111,100 -1,111,111,111 = 110,000,000,000 - wait, no, wait 99 is 100-1, so 1.111e9 *99 = 1.1e11.

So that's correct. So the exact number of moles is (1.1e11 /99) = 1.111111...e9.

So 1.111111111e9 *6.022e23 = let's compute 1.111111111 *6.022.

1.111111111 *6.022 = ?

Let me compute 1.111111111 *6 = 6.666666666.

1.111111111 *0.022 = 0.024444444 (since 1 *0.022 is 0.022, 0.111111111 *0.022= approx 0.00244444).

Adding 6.666666666 +0.024444444 = 6.69111111.

So 6.691e32.

So 6.691e32 is approximately 6.69e32, so option F is 6.6e32, which is the closest.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

To determine the number of molecules of phosgene (CCl₂O) corresponding to 1.1 × 10⁸ kg of gas, the following steps are taken:

1. **Convert mass to grams**:  
   Since 1 kg = 1000 g, the mass in grams is:  
   \[
   1.1 \times 10^8 \, \text{kg} \times 1000 \, \text{g/kg} = 1.1 \times 10^{11} \, \text{g}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the molar mass of phosgene (CCl₂O)**:  
   The molar mass is the sum of the atomic masses of its constituent atoms:  
   \[
   \text{C} = 12 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{O} = 16 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{Cl} = 35.5 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   Adding these:  
   \[
   12 + 16 + 2(35.5) = 99 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

3. **Convert mass to moles**:  
   Using the formula \(\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}}\):  
   \[
   \text{moles} = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{11} \, \text{g}}{99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.111 \times 10^9 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Convert moles to molecules**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules/mol):  
   \[
   \text{molecules} = 1.111 \times 10^9 \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}.
   \]  
   First, calculate \(1.111 \times 6.022\):  
   \[
   1.111 \times 6.022 \approx 6.691.
   \]  
   Then, multiply by \(10^{9} \times 10^{23} = 10^{32}\):  
   \[
   \text{molecules} \approx 6.691 \times 10^{32}.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The closest option to \(6.691 \times 10^{32}\) is \(6.6 \times 10^{32}\), which corresponds to **option F**.

Thus, the total number of molecules of phosgene is approximately \(6.6 \times 10^{32}\).

**Answer: F**
