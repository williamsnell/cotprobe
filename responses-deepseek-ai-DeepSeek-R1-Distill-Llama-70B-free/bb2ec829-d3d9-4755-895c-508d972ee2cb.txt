Question:

A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?

Options:

A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
B: Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
C: Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
D: Individuals who take Drug X have six times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
E: Individuals who do not take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
F: Individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer
G: Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer
H: Individuals who do not take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
I: Individuals who take Drug X have five times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
J: Individuals who take Drug X have zero risk of dying from this type of cancer

Okay, so I have this question about relative risk in a clinical trial. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that a physician is looking back at a trial involving Drug X. Drug X is known to increase the probability of cancer. So, 600 people were in the trial. 200 got Drug X, and 400 didn't. Then, 100 of those who took Drug X died from a particular cancer, and 100 who didn't take it also died from the same cancer. I need to find the relative risk of death from this cancer when taking Drug X compared to not taking it.

Hmm. Relative risk, right. I think relative risk is the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group versus the non-exposed group. So, in this case, the exposed group is the 200 who took Drug X, and the non-exposed are the 400 who didn't.

Wait, so the probability for the exposed group would be the number of deaths in that group divided by the total in the group. Same for the non-exposed. Then, relative risk is the exposed probability divided by the non-exposed probability.

Let me write this down. For Drug X users: 100 deaths out of 200 people. So the probability is 100/200, which is 0.5 or 50%. For non-users: 100 deaths out of 400. So that's 100/400, which is 0.25 or 25%.

So the relative risk is 0.5 divided by 0.25. Let me calculate that: 0.5 / 0.25 equals 2. So the relative risk is 2. That means Drug X users have twice the risk compared to non-users.

Looking at the options, option A says individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes, people confuse relative risk with odds ratio or other measures. But relative risk is just the ratio of the two probabilities. So yes, 50% vs 25% is a ratio of 2. So A is correct.

The relative risk of death from cancer in individuals taking Drug X compared to those not taking it is calculated by dividing the probability of death in the exposed group (Drug X users) by the probability in the non-exposed group (non-users). 

- Probability of death in Drug X users: 100/200 = 0.5 (50%)
- Probability of death in non-users: 100/400 = 0.25 (25%)
- Relative Risk = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2

Thus, individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer compared to those who do not take the drug.

Answer: A
