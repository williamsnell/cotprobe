Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about distillation of a solution containing ethyl alcohol and propyl alcohol. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that it's a 50 mole percent solution in propyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the solution is 50% by moles of propyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. So, like, the mole fraction of each is 0.5 each? Because 50 mole percent would mean each is 50%, right? Or wait, maybe it's a solution that's 50% propyl alcohol and 50% ethyl alcohol by moles. So, the initial mole fractions are X_ethanol = 0.5 and X_propanol = 0.5.

Then, this solution is distilled to the boiling point of 90°C. Oh, wait, no, I think it's that the solution is distilled, and the boiling point is 90°C. So, that's the temperature at which the solution is boiling. The condensate collected has a vapor pressure of 1066 mm Hg at that temperature. The pure vapor pressures are given: ethyl alcohol is 1190 mm Hg and propyl alcohol is 574 mm Hg at 90°C.

The problem asks for three things: a) mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid, b) mole fraction in the distillate, and c) moles of ethyl alcohol distilled. They also mention to assume ideal behavior, so Raoult's law applies.

Alright, let's tackle part a first. The mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid.

Wait, so during distillation, the liquid is boiling, and the vapor is richer in the more volatile component. Ethyl alcohol has a higher vapor pressure than propyl alcohol. So, higher volatility. So, ethyl alcohol will have a higher concentration in the vapor phase.

But part a is about the mole fraction in the boiling liquid. So, the solution is at 90°C, and pressure is presumably the sum of the partial pressures of each component.

Wait, wait. The total pressure (vapor pressure) of the solution is the sum of the partial pressures. The total pressure of the solution at boiling point would be the sum of each component's partial pressure. But wait, at the boiling point, the total pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which is typically around 760 mm Hg, but wait, the problem states that the condensate's vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, let me read again. The vapor pressure of the condensate is 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Wait, the condensate is the liquid that's collected after distillation. So, when the vapor is condensed, it becomes a liquid. The vapor pressure of that liquid at 90°C is 1066 mm Hg. Oh, perhaps that represents the total pressure of the vapor that was in equilibrium with the original boiling solution.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think: When you boil the solution, the vapor that comes off has a certain composition. When this vapor is condensed, you get the distillate, which is a liquid. The vapor pressure of this distillate at 90°C is 1066 mm Hg. So, perhaps this is the total vapor pressure of the mixture that condensed.

Wait, but the vapor pressure is a function of the composition of the liquid. So, if the distillate (the condensed vapor) has a vapor pressure of 1066 mm Hg at 90°C, then using Raoult's law, we can find the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in that distillate.

Wait, but Raoult's law says that the partial pressure of each component is equal to its mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. So, for the distillate, which is a liquid mixture of ethyl and propyl alcohol, the total vapor pressure (P_total) is X_ethanol_distillate * P_pure_ethanol + X_propanol_distillate * P_pure_propanol.

But since X_ethanol_distillate + X_propanol_distillate =1, we can write P_total = X_e * 1190 + (1 - X_e) * 574.

But wait, the P_total for the distillate is given as 1066 mm Hg. So, we can solve for X_e in the distillate.

Wait, but wait, is the vapor pressure of the distillate the same as the vapor pressure of the original boiling solution? Or is the distillate's vapor pressure at 90°C equal to 1066 mm Hg, which is the same as the vapor pressure of the solution at that temperature.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the original solution. The original solution has a certain composition (50 mole% each), but when it's boiled, the vapor that comes off is richer in ethyl alcohol. The condensate (distillate) has a composition such that when it's at 90°C, its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg.

Wait, but the original solution's boiling point is 90°C. So, at that temperature, the total vapor pressure is the sum of each component's partial pressure, which equals 760 mm Hg (assuming atmospheric pressure). Hmm, but wait, the problem says the condensate's vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg. That might not be the same as the boiling solution's vapor pressure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to structure this.

First, let's think about the original solution. It's 50% ethyl alcohol and 50% propyl alcohol by mole. So, X_e = 0.5, X_p = 0.5 in the liquid. The solution boils at 90°C. At that temperature, the pure vapor pressures are P_e^0 = 1190 mm Hg, P_p^0 =574 mm Hg.

Wait, the boiling point is determined by the condition that the sum of partial pressures equals the atmospheric pressure. So, at 90°C, the solution's total vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg (assuming standard atmospheric pressure). So, using Raoult's law:

P_total = X_e * P_e^0 + X_p * P_p^0 = 760 mm Hg.

But wait, in this problem, the original solution is being distilled, and the condensate has a vapor pressure of 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the setup wrong. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says: "The vapor pressure of the condensate collected in a cooled receiver is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature." So, the condensate is the distillate, which is a liquid. The vapor pressure of that liquid at 90°C is 1066 mm Hg. So, that would imply that when you have that particular mixture of ethyl and propyl alcohol, at 90°C, its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg.

So, the distillate is a mixture of ethyl and propyl alcohol with a total vapor pressure of 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. So, using Raoult's law, we can find the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the distillate, which is part b.

But part a asks for the mole fraction in the boiling liquid. Wait, but the original solution was 50% each. But when you boil it, the vapor is richer in ethyl alcohol, so the remaining liquid would have a lower mole fraction of ethyl alcohol than 0.5. But wait, no, because the problem says the solution is distilled to the boiling point, perhaps implying that we're looking at the azeotrope or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is being distilled, and the first vapor that comes off has a certain composition, which then is the distillate. But in this case, the distillate's vapor pressure is given, so perhaps that's the key to finding its composition.

Alternatively, maybe the process is that the solution is at 90°C, and the vapor in equilibrium with it has a pressure of 1066 mm Hg. Wait, but that can't be, because at 90°C, pure ethyl alcohol's vapor pressure is 1190 mm Hg, which is higher than 1066. So, that would suggest that the solution's vapor pressure is lower than pure ethyl's, which makes sense because it's a mixture.

Wait, but the original solution's vapor pressure would be at 90°C the sum of the partial pressures. But the problem says that the condensate's vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg at that temperature. So, perhaps the vapor that's distilled off has a certain composition, and when that vapor is condensed, the resulting liquid has a vapor pressure of 1066 mm Hg at 90°C.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. The original solution is 50% mole of ethyl and 50% propyl. So, X_e = 0.5, X_p=0.5.

2. When this solution is boiled, the vapor that comes off will have a composition determined by their partial pressures. The total vapor pressure (sum of partial pressures) equals the atmospheric pressure, which is 760 mm Hg at 90°C.

Wait, but the problem says that the condensate's vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg. Wait, that's higher than 760, which is confusing because 760 mm Hg is standard atmospheric pressure. So, if the condensate's vapor pressure is 1066, that would imply that it's under a higher pressure, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the condensate, when cooled, has a vapor pressure measured at 90°C. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total pressure in the system is 1066 mm Hg, which might not be atmospheric pressure. But that seems unlikely because distillation is typically conducted at atmospheric pressure.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think differently. The problem gives the vapor pressure of the condensate as 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. Since the condensate is a mixture, perhaps we can find the mole fractions in the condensate (which is the distillate) using Raoult's law.

So, for part b, the mole fraction in the distillate (condensate) is X_e_distillate, which can be found from:

P_total = X_e_distillate * P_e^0 + (1 - X_e_distillate) * P_p^0 = 1066.

So, substituting the known values:

X_e_distillate * 1190 + (1 - X_e_distillate) * 574 = 1066.

Let me compute this.

1190 X_e + 574 (1 - X_e) = 1066

Expand:

1190 X_e + 574 - 574 X_e = 1066

Combine like terms:

(1190 - 574) X_e + 574 = 1066

Calculate 1190 - 574: 616.

So,

616 X_e + 574 = 1066

Subtract 574 from both sides:

616 X_e = 1066 - 574 = 492.

So,

X_e = 492 / 616.

Let me compute that. 492 ÷ 616. Let's see, 616 x 0.8 = 492.8. So, approximately 0.8.

Wait, 616 * 0.8 = 492.8. So, 492 is a bit less than 0.8. Let's compute 492/616.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 123/154.

Hmm, 123 ÷ 154. Let me compute this. 154 * 0.8 = 123.2. So, it's approximately 0.798, which is about 0.8. So, X_e_distillate ≈ 0.8.

So, part b would be 0.8. Now, looking at the options, which option has b) as 0.80? Let's check the options.

Option F: a) 0.30, b)0.80, c)0.32.

Option B: b)0.85. Option E: b)0.75, etc. So, option F has b) 0.80, which matches our calculation.

Now, part a is the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the boiling liquid. Wait, the original solution is 50% each, but when it's boiled, the vapor is richer in ethyl alcohol, so the remaining liquid would have less ethyl alcohol. But wait, the problem might be implying that the boiling liquid is at 90°C, and its vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg, but that can't be because the boiling point is when the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, in this problem, the solution is being distilled, and the distillate's vapor pressure at 90°C is 1066 mm Hg. So, perhaps the solution's vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg, but that doesn't make sense because at the boiling point, the solution's vapor pressure should equal the atmospheric pressure.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The solution is at 90°C, and the condensate has a vapor pressure of 1066 mm Hg at 90°C. So, perhaps the solution's vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg, but that would mean it's boiling at a pressure higher than atmospheric. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is under a total pressure of 1066 mm Hg, so the sum of the partial pressures is 1066, which is higher than atmospheric. But that would mean the boiling point is higher. Wait, but the boiling point is given as 90°C, so maybe the surrounding pressure is 1066 mm Hg. But that's non-standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the condensate's vapor pressure as the total pressure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about part a again. The mole fraction in the boiling liquid. The solution is boiling, so the sum of the partial pressures equals the surrounding pressure, which is probably 1 atm (760 mm Hg). So, for the boiling liquid:

P_total = X_e_liq * P_e^0 + (1 - X_e_liq) * P_p^0 = 760 mm Hg.

Wait, but the problem says that the condensate's vapor pressure is 1066 mm Hg. So, perhaps the distillate's vapor pressure at 90°C is 1066 mm Hg, which we've already used to find X_e_distillate ≈0.8.

So, for part a, the mole fraction in the boiling liquid, perhaps we can use Raoult's law with the total pressure being 760 mm Hg.

So, let's set up the equation:

X_e_liq * 1190 + (1 - X_e_liq) * 574 = 760.

Let me compute this.

1190 X_e + 574 (1 - X_e) = 760.

Expanding:

1190 X_e + 574 - 574 X_e = 760.

Combine like terms:

(1190 - 574) X_e + 574 = 760.

Calculate 1190 - 574 = 616.

So,

616 X_e + 574 = 760.

Subtract 574 from both sides:

616 X_e = 760 - 574 = 186.

So, X_e_liq = 186 / 616.

Let me compute that. 186 ÷ 616 ≈ 0.302, so approximately 0.30.

Looking at the options, option F has a) 0.30, which matches.

So, part a) 0.30, part b) 0.80.

Now, part c) is the number of moles of ethyl alcohol that were distilled.

Wait, the problem states that the initial solution is 50 mole percent. Let's assume we have a total of 1 mole of solution for simplicity, so 0.5 moles of ethyl and 0.5 moles of propyl alcohol.

When we distill, the amount that distills over would depend on the composition of the vapor. But how much is actually distilled? Hmm, perhaps we need to calculate how much of the original solution was vaporized.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how much was distilled, just asks for the number of moles of ethyl alcohol that were distilled. Hmm, perhaps we can assume that all the vapor comes from the original 1 mole of solution, but that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the distillate is the vapor in equilibrium with the boiling solution. So, the mole fraction of ethyl alcohol in the vapor (which is the distillate) is 0.8, as calculated in part b. So, if we have, say, n moles of vapor, then 0.8n moles are ethyl alcohol.

But wait, the total moles vaporized can be found using the ideal gas law, perhaps. But without knowing the volume or pressure, maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the amount of distillate is such that the mole fraction in the vapor is 0.8.

Wait, but the problem gives the mole fractions in the liquid and the distillate, so perhaps the number of moles is based on the initial amount. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the solution is being completely distilled, so all of it is turned into vapor. But that's not realistic because distillation usually involves collecting the vapor over time. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the vapor is in equilibrium with the liquid at 90°C, so the mole fractions are as calculated.

Wait, but how do we find the number of moles of ethyl alcohol distilled? Let me think in terms of material balance.

Suppose we start with 1 mole of solution: 0.5 moles ethyl, 0.5 moles propyl.

After distillation, some amount, say, D moles, are distilled as vapor. The vapor has a composition of X_e_vapor = 0.8, so the moles of ethyl in the vapor are 0.8 D.

The remaining liquid would have (0.5 - 0.8 D) moles of ethyl alcohol, and (0.5 - 0.2 D) moles of propyl alcohol, assuming D is the total moles vaporized. Wait, because the vapor takes away 0.8 D moles of ethyl and 0.2 D moles of propyl.

But at the same time, the remaining liquid's composition should satisfy Raoult's
