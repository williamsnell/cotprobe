Okay, so I have this problem here where Steven Moore bought a new car for $3,462.20, and he wants to pay it off over 35 months. I need to find his monthly payments. Hmm, okay. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when you're paying for something in installments, it's usually an annuity problem. So, I think I should use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula here. The formula is something like P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where P is the present value (the total amount he needs to pay), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods (months in this case).

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about interest rates. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since it's a simple payment plan without any interest mentioned, perhaps it's just a straight division of the total amount by the number of months. So, $3,462.20 divided by 35 months. Let me try that.

Let me do the division. 3462.20 divided by 35. Let's see, 35 times 98 is 3430, right? Because 35*100 is 3500, minus 35*2 is 70, so 3500-70=3430. So 35*98=3430. Subtract that from 3462.20, which leaves 32.20. So that's 98 with a remainder of 32.20. Now, 32.20 divided by 35 is approximately 0.92. So adding that to 98 gives about 98.92.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately. 3462.20 / 35. Let's compute this step by step. 35 goes into 346 how many times? 35*9 is 315, 35*10 is 350 which is too big. So 9 times. 9*35=315. Subtract that from 346, you get 31. Bring down the 2, making it 312. 35 goes into 312 eight times (35*8=280). Subtract 280 from 312, you get 32. Bring down the next 2, making 322. 35*9 is 315. Subtract, get 7. Bring down the 0, making 70. 35 goes into 70 exactly 2 times. So putting it all together: 98.92 (since the decimal comes after 98, and the next digits are 92). So that's approximately $98.92 per month.

Looking at the options, option E is $98.92. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but I should make sure that there's no interest involved. The problem doesn't specify any interest rate, so I think it's safe to assume that it's a simple division. If there was interest, the problem would have mentioned it, right? So yeah, I think E is the correct choice here.

To determine Steven Moore's monthly payments for his car, we can assume a simple division of the total amount by the number of months, as no interest rate is provided. The total cost of the car is $3,462.20, and the payment period is 35 months.

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3,462.20}{35} \approx 98.92
\]

Thus, the monthly payment is approximately **$98.92**, which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: E
