Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it's asking. 

Alright, the problem says: A mass of 0.25 kg is dropped from rest in a medium that offers a resistance of 0.2 times the velocity, where v is in m/s. We need to find the maximum height from which it can be dropped so that its velocity doesn't exceed 10 m/s. The options are A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So this is a motion problem with air resistance. I remember that when an object is falling under gravity with air resistance, the motion is governed by Newton's second law. The forces acting on the object are gravity pulling it down and the air resistance opposing the motion.

Wait, the mass is 0.25 kg. Air resistance is given as 0.2|v|. So the equation of motion would be ma = mg - bv, right? Because the net force is the gravitational force minus the air resistance. And since the object is moving downward, the velocity is positive, so we can drop the absolute value.

Let me write that down. Newton's second law: m*a = m*g - b*v. But wait, a is dv/dt, the acceleration. So the differential equation is m dv/dt = m g - b v.

I think this is a first-order linear differential equation, which can be solved using an integrating factor. Let me rearrange it. 

Divide both sides by m: dv/dt = g - (b/m) v. Hmm, yes. So the equation is dv/dt + (b/m)v = g. 

The integrating factor would be e^(∫(b/m) dt) )= e^( (b/m) t ). So when I multiply both sides by the integrating factor, the left side becomes the derivative of (v * integrating factor) with respect to time.

Wait, let me double-check. The standard form is dv/dt + P(t) v = Q(t). So integrating factor is exp(∫P dt). Here, P is b/m, which is a constant. So integrating factor is e^((b/m) t).

Multiplying both sides by that:

e^((b/m) t) dv/dt + (b/m) e^((b/m) t) v = g e^((b/m) t).

The left side is d/dt [ v e^((b/m) t) ].

Integrate both sides with respect to t:

v e^((b/m) t) = ∫ g e^((b/m) t) dt + C.

The integral on the right: let u = (b/m) t, du = (b/m) dt. So ∫ e^u * (m/b) du ) * g. Wait, let's compute it.

∫ g e^((b/m) t) dt = g * (m/b) e^((b/m) t) ) + C.

So putting it all together:

v e^((b/m) t) = (g m / b) e^((b/m) t) ) + C.

Divide both sides by e^((b/m) t):

v(t) = (g m / b) + C e^(- (b/m) t).

Now, apply initial condition. At t=0, the object is dropped from rest, so v(0)=0.

So 0 = (g m / b) + C e^0 → C = - g m / b.

So the solution becomes:

v(t) = (g m / b) (1 - e^(- (b/m) t )).

Wait, that makes sense. As time increases, the exponential term approaches zero, so velocity approaches (g m / b), which is the terminal velocity.

But wait, the problem states that the velocity should not exceed 10 m/s. So we're to find the maximum height H such that when the object is dropped from H, its velocity never goes beyond 10 m/s.

Wait, but in reality, without any other forces, the velocity approaches a terminal velocity. So perhaps the terminal velocity is higher than 10 m/s, and we want the object to not reach that. So maybe we need to find the time when v(t) = 10 m/s and then find the displacement up to that time, which would be the maximum height.

Alternatively, perhaps the object is in the acceleration phase, and we need to find the point where its speed first reaches 10 m/s. Then the height from which it was dropped must be such that it doesn't accelerate beyond that speed.

Wait, but the terminal velocity is the maximum speed the object can reach. So if the terminal velocity is higher than 10 m/s, then the object will eventually reach 10 m/s, but then keep going. So if the terminal velocity is greater than 10, then we have to find the height where when it's dropped from that height, the object's speed at some point during the fall reaches exactly 10 m/s, but not more. Hmm, that might not make sense because once you pass that point, it'll keep accelerating until it hits terminal velocity. Wait, but maybe the object isn't allowed to go beyond 10 m/s, so perhaps the drop height is such that it just reaches 10 m/s at the point where it's released? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the object's maximum speed during the fall doesn't exceed 10 m/s, which would mean that the terminal velocity is 10 m/s. Wait, that might not be the case because the terminal velocity is when acceleration becomes zero.

Wait, maybe I should compute the terminal velocity first. Let's calculate that.

Terminal velocity v_t is when acceleration is zero, so m g = b v_t → v_t = (m g)/b.

Given m=0.25 kg, b=0.2 kg/s (since the resistance is 0.2|v|, and the units are kg m/s² when considering force). So:

v_t = (0.25 * 9.8) / 0.2 = (2.45) / 0.2 = 12.25 m/s.

Oh, so the terminal velocity is 12.25 m/s, which is higher than 10 m/s. So the object, if dropped from a sufficient height, would reach 10 m/s, but then continue to accelerate to 12.25 m/s. Therefore, to prevent the object from exceeding 10 m/s, we need to find the height from which it is dropped such that when it reaches 10 m/s, it has no more distance to fall. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the height at which the object's velocity becomes 10 m/s for the first time. But wait, in that case, the maximum height from which it can be dropped without exceeding 10 m/s would be that height, because if you drop it from higher, it would have already passed through that velocity.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the velocity as a function of time. So we can find the time when v(t) = 10 m/s, and then compute the distance fallen up to that time. That would be the maximum height. Because if you drop it from a higher point, the object would have to travel beyond that distance, which would cause the velocity to increase beyond 10 m/s.

Yes, that makes sense. So the plan is:

1. Find the time t when v(t) =10 m/s.

2. Find the displacement s(t) at that time, which would be the height H from which it's dropped to reach 10 m/s at the end of the fall.

So first, let's find t when v(t) =10.

We have the equation for v(t):

v(t) = (g m / b) [1 - e^(- (b/m) t ) ].

We can set this equal to 10 and solve for t.

So,

10 = ( (0.25 * 9.8 ) / 0.2 ) [1 - e^(-0.2/0.25 t ) ].

Compute (0.25 * 9.8 ) / 0.2:

0.25 *9.8 = 2.45; 2.45 / 0.2 = 12.25.

So,

10 = 12.25 [1 - e^(-0.8 t ) ].

Divide both sides by 12.25:

10 /12.25 = 1 - e^(-0.8 t )

10 /12.25 is approximately 0.8163. Let me compute it exactly: 10 ÷ 12.25. 12.25 is 49/4. So 10/(49/4) = 40/49 ≈ 0.8163.

So,

0.8163 = 1 - e^(-0.8 t )

Rearranging:

e^(-0.8 t ) = 1 - 0.8163 = 0.1837.

Take natural log of both sides:

-0.8 t = ln(0.1837)

Compute ln(0.1837): approximately, since ln(0.2)=~ -1.6094, 0.1837 is a bit less than 0.2, so ln is more negative. Let me compute it:

ln(0.1837) ≈ -1.694.

So,

-0.8 t ≈ -1.694 → t ≈ 1.694 / 0.8 ≈ 2.1175 seconds.

So t is approximately 2.1175 seconds.

Now, we need to find the displacement s(t) at this time, which will give us the height H.

The equation for displacement when under variable velocity is the integral of v(t) from 0 to t. So,

s(t) = ∫₀^t v(t') dt'.

We can use the expression for v(t):

v(t') = (g m / b) [1 - e^(- (b/m) t') ]

So,

s(t) = (g m / b) ∫₀^t [1 - e^(- (b/m) t') ] dt'

Let me compute this integral.

Let me denote (b/m) as a constant, let's say k = b/m = 0.2 /0.25 = 0.8 s^-1.

So,

s(t) = (g m / b) ∫₀^t [1 - e^(-k t') ] dt'

Which is:

= (g m / b) [ ∫₀^t 1 dt' - ∫₀^t e^(-k t') dt' ]

Compute each integral:

∫ 1 dt' from 0 to t is t.

∫ e^(-k t') dt' from 0 to t is [ (-1/k) e^(-k t') ) ] from 0 to t → (-1/k)(e^(-k t) -1 )

So,

s(t) = (g m / b) [ t - ( (-1/k)(e^(-k t) -1 ) ) ]

Simplify:

= (g m / b) [ t + ( (1 - e^(-k t) ) / k ) ]

Factor in the values. Let's compute each part.

We have g=9.8 m/s², m=0.25 kg, b=0.2 kg/s, k=0.8 s⁻¹.

Compute (g m / b): as before, that's 12.25 m/s, the terminal velocity.

So,

s(t) = 12.25 [ t + (1 - e^(-0.8 t )) / 0.8 ]

At t≈2.1175 s, let's compute each part.

Compute e^(-0.8 *2.1175):

0.8 *2.1175 ≈ 1.694. e^-1.694 ≈ 0.1837.

So,

1 - e^(-0.8 t) ≈ 1 - 0.1837 = 0.8163.

Now, t = 2.1175 s.

So,

t + (1 - e^(-0.8 t )) / 0.8 → 2.1175 + (0.8163) / 0.8.

0.8163 / 0.8 ≈ 1.0204.

So sum is 2.1175 + 1.0204 ≈ 3.1379 seconds? Wait no, because the units here are in meters? Wait, no, I'm calculating s(t), which is displacement.

Wait, no, the entire expression is multiplied by 12.25. So,

s(t) = 12.25 * [2.1175 + 1.0204 ].

Wait, 2.1175 + 1.0204 is 3.1379.

So,

s(t) ≈ 12.25 * 3.1379 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

12.25 *3 = 36.75, 12.25 *0.1379≈ 1.687. So total ≈ 36.75 + 1.687 = 38.437 meters.

Wait, that seems way too high because the options are around 10-17 meters. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the equation for s(t). Let me double-check the integral.

Wait, the integral of v(t) is the displacement, yes. Let me re-express s(t):

s(t) = ∫ v(t) dt = (g m / b) [ t - (1/k)(1 - e^(-k t)) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when integrating e^(-k t').

Wait, ∫ e^(-k t') dt' is (-1/k) e^(-k t') ) + C.

So evaluating from 0 to t:

(-1/k)(e^(-k t) - 1 )

So,

∫₀^t e^(-k t') dt' = (1 - e^(-k t )) / k.

So,

s(t) = (g m / b) [ t - (1 - e^(-k t )) / k ].

Wait, so my previous calculation was incorrect in the sign. I think I missed a negative sign. Let me correct that.

So,

s(t) = (g m / b) [ t - (1 - e^(-k t )) / k ]

Ah yes, because it's [ t - (1 - e^(-k t )) /k ].

So, plugging the numbers again.

k=0.8.

So,

t = 2.1175 s.

(1 - e^(-k t )) = 1 - 0.1837 = 0.8163.

So (1 - e^(-k t )) / k = 0.8163 /0.8 ≈1.0204.

So,

t - this value = 2.1175 - 1.0204 ≈ 1.0971.

Now, s(t) = (12.25) * 1.0971 ≈ ?

12 *1.0971 is 13.1652, 0.25 *1.0971≈0.2743. So total ≈13.4395 meters.

Hmm, that's approximately 13.44 meters. Looking at the options, G is 13.45 m. So that's very close.

Wait, but let me do the calculations more accurately. Let's compute t when v=10 again.

We had:

10 = 12.25 (1 - e^(-0.8 t) )

→ 1 - e^(-0.8 t) = 10/12.25 = 0.81632653.

So,

e^(-0.8 t) = 1 - 0.81632653 = 0.18367347.

Take natural log: ln(0.18367347) ≈ -1.6945.

So,

-0.8 t = -1.6945 → t = 1.6945 / 0.8 = 2.118125 s.

Now, compute s(t):

s(t) = (g m / b) [ t - (1 - e^(-k t )) /k ]

We have:

t = 2.118125 s.

(1 - e^(-k t )) = 1 - e^(-0.8 * 2.118125 ) = 1 - e^(-1.6945).

We know e^-1.6945 ≈ 0.1837, so 1 - 0.1837 =0.8163.

So,

(1 - e^(-k t )) / k = 0.8163 / 0.8 = 1.020375.

So,

t - (1 - e^(-k t ))/k = 2.118125 - 1.020375 = 1.09775 s.

Then,

s(t) = 12.25 * 1.09775 = ?

Compute 12 * 1.09775 = 13.173; 0.25 *1.09775=0.2744375.

Sum is 13.173 + 0.2744375 = 13.4474 m.

So approximately 13.45 meters, which is option G.

Wait, but the options given are:

A: 16.5 m

B:14.9

C:12.3

D:17.3

E:10.5

F:9.2

G:13.45

H:11.8

I:8.7

J:15.2

So G is 13.45 m. That's our calculated value.

But wait, let's think again. The question is asking for the maximum height from which the object can be dropped without its velocity exceeding 10 m/s. So if the object is dropped from that height, the maximum velocity it attains is exactly 10 m/s. If it's dropped from a higher point, then the velocity would go beyond 10 m/s as it approaches terminal velocity.

So our calculation gives H=13.45 m, which is option G. So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of a 0.25 kg object falling through a medium with air resistance given by \( F_{\text{air}} = 0.2|v| \). The goal is to find the maximum height \( H \) from which the object can be dropped such that its velocity does not exceed \( 10 \, \mathrm{m/s} \).

### Step 1: Equation of Motion
Using Newton's second law, the net force on the object is:
\[
m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - bv
\]
where \( m = 0.25 \, \mathrm{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \), and \( b = 0.2 \,
