Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Maine's aphorism. The question is asking how Maine's statement is often misunderstood. The statement is: "the movement of progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from Status to Contract." 

First, I need to understand what Maine meant by this. From what I remember, Henry Maine was a legal historian. He talked about societies evolving from a system based on status to one based on contract. Status refers to the social position or role you're born into, like in feudal times where your obligations and rights were determined by your birth. Contract, on the other hand, is about voluntary agreements between individuals, which is more characteristic of modern societies with more individual freedom and less rigid social structures.

So, the statement is about the progression from status-based societies to contract-based ones. Now, the question is about how this is misunderstood. Let's look at the options.

Option A: His concept of status is misrepresented. Hmm, maybe people get status wrong, but I'm not sure that's the main misunderstanding.

Option B: It is misinterpreted as a prediction. Oh, wait! I think Maine was describing a historical trend, not predicting the future. So people might think he's saying that all societies will inevitably move this way, but maybe he's just observing what has happened so far.

Option C: His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems. No, I think Western systems are exactly where he applied it, moving from status to contract.

Option D: It is incorrectly related to economic progression. I'm not sure about this. Economic factors might be part of it, but the main point is legal and social structure, not just economy.

Option E: It is taken literally. Maybe, but I'm not certain what 'taken literally' would mean here. Perhaps thinking it's a complete shift without any nuance?

Option F: His use of the word 'progressive' is often misconstrued. Progressive can mean different things. Maybe people think he's saying it's better, but perhaps he's just describing a change, not necessarily endorsing it as better.

Option G: His concept of 'contract' is often misinterpreted. Maybe people think contract is only about legal agreements, but Maine's idea is broader, including social contracts and individual freedoms.

Wait, but the question is about the misunderstanding of the aphorism. I think the key is that Maine was talking about the historical movement, not predicting the future. So people might take it as a prediction rather than a description of past trends. That would make option B the correct answer because it's misinterpreted as a prediction.

Alternatively, maybe the misunderstanding is about 'progressive' meaning something else. But I think the more common misunderstanding is that people think he's predicting the future, not just looking back.

So I'm leaning towards option B.

The question asks how Maine's aphorism is often misunderstood. Maine described a historical shift from status to contract, emphasizing voluntary agreements over predetermined roles. The key misunderstanding lies in interpreting his statement as a prediction rather than a historical observation. 

B: It is misinterpreted as a prediction.

Answer: B
