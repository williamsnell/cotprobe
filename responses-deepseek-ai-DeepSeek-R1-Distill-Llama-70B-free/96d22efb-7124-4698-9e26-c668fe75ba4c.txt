Okay, so I have this problem about depreciation, and I'm a bit rusty on the concept, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Mr. Preston bought a new car for $4,500. He used it for eight years and then sold it for $475. There are two parts to the question: (a) the total depreciation and (b) the average yearly depreciation. I need to find both and pick the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that depreciation is the decrease in the value of an asset over time. In this case, the car. So, total depreciation should be the original cost minus the selling price, right? Because depreciation is the amount the car has lost in value.

So the original cost is $4,500, and he sold it for $475. So total depreciation would be 4500 minus 475. Let me do that math: 4500 - 475. Hmm, 4500 minus 400 is 4100, then minus 75 more is 4025. So the total depreciation is $4,025. That's part (a).

Now part (b) asks for the average yearly depreciation. That should be the total depreciation divided by the number of years he used the car. He used it for eight years. So 4025 divided by 8. Let me calculate that.

4025 divided by 8. Let me see: 8 times 500 is 4000, which is 500 per year, but 4025 is 25 more than 4000. So 8 goes into 25 three times (8*3=24), with a remainder of 1. So 25/8 is 3.125. So adding that to 500, the average yearly depreciation would be 503.125. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 4025 divided by 8 is... Let me think again.

Wait, 8 * 500 is 4000. So 4025 - 4000 = 25. 25/8 is 3.125. So the total is 500 + 3.125 = 503.125. So approximately $503.13 per year.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check which option has total depreciation of $4,025 and yearly of about $503.13. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option H: Total $4,025 and yearly $503.13. That matches.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 4500-475 is 4025, correct. 4025/8. Let me compute 8 * 503.13. 8*500 is 4000, 8*3.13 is 25.04. So 4000+25.04=4025.04, which is about 4025, so that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option H.

The total depreciation is calculated as the original cost minus the selling price: $4,500 - $475 = $4,025. The average yearly depreciation is obtained by dividing the total depreciation by the number of years: $4,025 ÷ 8 ≈ $503.13. Comparing these values to the options, the correct choice is:

H: $4,025 and $503.13.

Answer: H
