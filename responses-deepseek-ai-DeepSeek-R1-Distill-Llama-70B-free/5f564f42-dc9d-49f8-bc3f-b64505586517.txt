Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a deed and who gets the proceeds from a wheat crop. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on property law, but let's try to think it through.

The scenario is that a woman executed a deed in 2001. The deed says she's conveying land for $1 to her friend for life. But there are some conditions. If liquor is ever sold on the land, it goes to her cousin and his heirs. Also, if the cousin's interest isn't valid, she reserves the right to re-enter and take back the property.

Then, in 2004, the friend died intestate before the wheat he planted could be harvested. The question is, who gets the proceeds from the crop?

First, I need to understand the interests created by the deed. The friend has a life estate, right? Because it's "to my friend for life." Life estates are common, where the holder has the right to use the property until they die.

So, the friend's life estate would typically include the right to use the land, including harvesting crops they planted. But wait, what about the timing? The friend died before the wheat was harvested. So, does the right to the crops pass to someone else after the life tenant dies?

Under common law, when a life tenant dies, their estate ends, and the remainder interest takes effect. But wait, what's the remainder here? The primary remainder is to the cousin if liquor is sold. But if that doesn't happen, does the woman have some reversion?

Wait, the deed says if the cousin's interest isn't valid, the woman can re-enter. So, the cousin has a contingent remainder. Contingent because it's based on the condition of liquor being sold.

So, the structure is: Life estate to the friend, contingent remainder to the cousin upon the sale of liquor, and if that's invalid, the woman has a right of reentry, which might act as a reversion.

Now, about the crops. In general, a life tenant is entitled to the crops they planted during their life estate. But what happens when the life tenant dies before harvest? Do they still get the proceeds, or does it pass to the holder of the future interest?

I remember something about this. I think that a life tenant is entitled to the crops they planted, even if they die before harvest. Because the right to the crops vests during their lifetime. So the life tenant's estate would own the crops upon their death. But wait, the friend died intestate, so their estate would go to their heirs.

Wait, but wait. Maybe it's different because the life estate ends at death, so any unharvested crops would belong to the next interest holder. Or does the life tenant's estate still take them?

I think the rule is that the life tenant's right to the crops is determined at the time of planting. So if they planted the crop, even if they die before harvesting, the estate would still own the crops. So the proceeds would go to the friend's estate, which would pass according to intestacy laws, meaning their heirs.

But wait, another angle: the woman created a life estate, but the deed includes a condition. If the life tenant dies, does the future interest affect the crops? I don't think so because the future interest is contingent on selling liquor, which hasn't happened. So the life estate was valid, and the remainder is still contingent.

So, the friend's life estate includes the right to the crops. Upon the friend's death, the estate would take the proceeds. Therefore, the proceeds would go to the friend's heirs.

Wait, but what about the possibility that the right to the crops passes to the next in line? For example, if the life estate ends, maybe the crops go to the reversioner or the remainderman.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The life tenant has the right to use the land during their life, including growing and harvesting crops. If they die before harvest, do their rights to the crops lapse, or do they pass to their estate?

I think the general rule is that the life tenant's estate owns the crops because they were planted during their life estate. So the friend's estate would inherit the right to the crops, and thus the proceeds would go to the friend's heirs.

Looking at the options, option I is "The friend's heirs." So I think that's the correct answer.

Another way: The life estate gives the friend the right to the land for life, including the crops planted. Upon their death, their estate owns the crops, so the proceeds go to their heirs.

The deed executed by the woman in 2001 created a life estate for her friend, with a contingent remainder to her cousin if liquor was ever sold on the land. If the cousin's interest was invalid, the woman reserved the right to re-enter the property. The friend died intestate in 2004 before harvesting the wheat they had planted.

Under property law, a life tenant is entitled to the crops they planted during their life estate, even if they die before the harvest. The right to the crops vests during the life tenant's lifetime, and upon their death, the proceeds from the crops would pass to the life tenant's estate. Since the friend died intestate, their estate would distribute the proceeds according to intestacy laws, meaning the proceeds would go to the friend's heirs.

The contingent remainder to the cousin is not relevant here because the condition (sale of liquor) has not been triggered. Similarly, the woman's right of reentry is not applicable in this scenario. Therefore, the proceeds from the crop belong to the friend's heirs.
