The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Why does the plasma (ion) tail of a comet always point away from the Sun?

Options:

A: The ions are following Keplerian orbits that lead away from the Sun.
B: The conservation of the angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun.
C: The solar wind electromagnetically "blows" the ions directly away from the Sun.
D: The ions are repelled by the Sun's magnetic field.
E: The gravity of other celestial bodies pulls the ions away from the Sun.
F: The tail is a reflection of the Sun's light and therefore points away from it.
G: The ions are naturally attracted to the colder regions of space, away from the Sun.
H: The Sun's radiation causes a chemical reaction that propels the ions away.
I: The heat of the Sun evaporates the ions, causing them to move away.
J: Radiation pressure from the Sun's light pushes the ions away.

Okay, so I've got this question about comets and their tails. Hmm, I remember that comets have two tails, right? One is the ion tail, and the other is the dust tail. The question is about the plasma or ion tail always pointing away from the Sun. I need to figure out why that happens.

I think the ion tail is made up of ions from the comet's nucleus. When the comet approaches the Sun, the ices vaporize, creating a cloud of gas and dust. The Sun's ultraviolet light ionizes some of these gases, making them charged particles. But why does the tail point away from the Sun?

Wait, the solar wind has something to do with this. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles ejected from the Sun. It's moving away from the Sun at high speeds. So maybe the ions from the comet are being pushed by the solar wind. Since the solar wind is moving away, it would carry the comet's ions along with it, making the tail point away.

Alternatively, I've heard about radiation pressure, which is the force exerted by sunlight. Photons from the Sun hitting particles can push them. But I'm not sure if that applies more to dust particles than to ions. The ion tail and dust tail can sometimes point in slightly different directions because they're affected by different forces.

Another thought: the Sun's magnetic field might play a role. The solar wind carries the Sun's magnetic field with it. The ionized gas from the comet would interact with this magnetic field. Since the solar wind is moving away, the ions would align along the magnetic field lines, which are stretched out away from the Sun. So the tail would follow the direction of the solar wind and the magnetic field.

Looking at the options, option C says the solar wind electromagnetically "blows" the ions away. That sounds plausible. Option J mentions radiation pressure pushing ions, but I'm not sure if that's the main factor for the ion tail. I think radiation pressure is more for the dust tail.

Option B is about angular momentum, but I don't see how that directly points the tail away. Option D suggests the Sun's magnetic field repels the ions, but I think it's more about the solar wind carrying them. Option J might be a contender, but I'm leaning towards C because the solar wind's electromagnetic effect is a stronger factor here.

So the correct answer is C.

The plasma (ion) tail of a comet points away from the Sun because the solar wind, a high-speed stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, interacts with the ionized gases from the comet. The solar wind carries the Sun's magnetic field, and the ions from the comet align along these magnetic field lines, which are stretched outward by the solar wind. This electromagnetic interaction effectively "blows" the ions away from the Sun, resulting in the tail pointing away from it.

Answer: C
