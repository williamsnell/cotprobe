Okay, so I've got this question about banking and the money supply. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says a commercial bank has $100,000 in deposits and has made loans of $65,000. The required reserve ratio is 20%. So there are two parts: (a) how much more can the bank lend, and (b) how much can the banking system as a whole add to the money supply because of this loan.

Alright, I remember that required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that a bank must hold in reserves rather than lend out. So, the bank can't lend all its deposits; it has to keep some in reserve.

First, let's tackle part (a). The bank has $100,000 in deposits. The required reserve is 20%, so the reserves must be 20% of 100,000. Let me calculate that: 0.20 * 100,000 = $20,000. So the bank must keep $20,000 in reserves.

Now, the bank has already made loans of $65,000. Wait, so the total deposits are $100k, and they've lent out $65k. So, their current reserves must be the deposits minus the loans plus any existing reserves. Wait, no, the reserves are a portion of the deposits. So the formula for required reserves is different.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of total reserves. So the bank's total reserves are equal to the required reserves plus any excess reserves they might have. But in this case, I think the bank is keeping exactly the required reserves, no excess, because the question is about how much more they can lend.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The required reserve ratio is 20%, so the bank must have at least 20% of its deposits as reserves. The rest can be used for loans. So total deposits are $100k. Required reserves are $20k. So the amount they can lend is the total deposits minus required reserves. But wait, they've already lent $65k. So how much more can they lend?

So the maximum they can lend is total deposits minus required reserves. So that's 100,000 - 20,000 = $80,000. They've already lent $65,000. So the additional amount they can lend is 80,000 - 65,000 = $15,000. So part (a) is $15,000.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So required reserves are 20% of deposits, so 20k. The bank's total assets must equal the deposits. So if they have 100k deposits, their total assets are 100k. Their assets are loans plus reserves. So their loans can be up to 80k, as calculated. Since they've already lent 65k, they can lend another 15k. So part (a) is 15k.

Now part (b) is about the banking system as a whole. So when a bank makes a loan, that money gets deposited elsewhere, and each subsequent bank can lend a portion of it, and so on. This is the money multiplier effect, I think.

The formula for the money multiplier is 1 divided by the required reserve ratio. But wait, the money multiplier is usually the reciprocal of the reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is 0.2, then the multiplier is 1/0.2 = 5. So when the initial bank lends 15k, it gets multiplied by 5, leading to an increase of 75k in the money supply.

Wait, but wait. The initial loan is 15k, and each new deposit leads to more loans. So the total increase is initial loan times the multiplier. So 15k * 5 = 75k. So part (b) is $75,000.

Looking at the options, option C says $15,000 and $75,000. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for part (b). The formula for the money supply change is the change in loans multiplied by the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio). So yes, 15k * (1/0.2) = 75k. So that's correct.

So the answers are (a) $15,000 and (b) $75,000, which is option C.

To determine how much additional money the bank can lend and the impact on the money supply, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Part (a): Additional lending capacity of the bank**  
   The bank has $100,000 in deposits and a required reserve ratio of 20%. This means it must hold at least $20,000 in reserves (calculated as $100,000 * 0.20). The remaining $80,000 can be used for loans. Since the bank has already lent $65,000, the additional amount it can lend is:  
   $$ 80,000 - 65,000 = 15,000. $$  

2. **Part (b): Impact on the money supply**  
   When the bank lends $15,000, this amount is deposited into the economy, and the banking system as a whole can create additional money through the money multiplier effect. The money multiplier is calculated as:  
   $$ \text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Required Reserve Ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.20} = 5. $$  
   Therefore, the total increase in the money supply is:  
   $$ 15,000 \times 5 = 75,000. $$  

From the given options, the correct answer is **C: $15,000 and $75,000**.
