Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Tencer and his mortgage. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says that Mr. Tencer has a $10,000 mortgage at 6% interest, and it's payable over 10 years. So, the original loan is $10k, and he's supposed to pay it off in a decade. Now, after five years, he still owes $7,000 and decides to pay the remaining amount all at once. But there's a catch: there's a 3% prepayment penalty. I need to figure out how much he has to pay in total.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should figure out how much he's paid so far, but wait, maybe that's not necessary. The key here is that after five years, the remaining balance is $7,000. Now, if he pays that off, he has to pay a penalty on that amount.

Wait, prepayment penalty is usually a percentage of the outstanding balance, right? So 3% of $7,000. Let me calculate that. 3% of 7k is 0.03 * 7000, which is $210. So the penalty is $210.

So the total amount he has to pay is the remaining balance plus the penalty. That would be 7000 + 210 = $7,210. So looking at the options, that's option H.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, with mortgages, there might be other factors like how the interest is calculated or if the penalty is applied differently. But in this case, the problem states it's a 3% prepayment penalty, so I think it's straightforward—3% of the remaining balance.

So yeah, the calculation seems correct. The total is $7,210, which is option H.

The total amount Mr. Tencer has to pay is calculated by adding the remaining mortgage balance of $7,000 to the 3% prepayment penalty. 

1. **Prepayment Penalty Calculation**:  
   3% of $7,000 = 0.03 × $7,000 = $210.  

2. **Total Payment**:  
   $7,000 (remaining balance) + $210 (penalty) = $7,210.  

Thus, the total amount Mr. Tencer has to pay is **$7,210**, which corresponds to option **H**.
