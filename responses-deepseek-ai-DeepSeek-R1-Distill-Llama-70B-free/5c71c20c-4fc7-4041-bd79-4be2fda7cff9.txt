Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem here. Let me read it again. Friedman Brothers accepted a 60-day sight draft on April 10th for $562.50. It was discounted on April 15th at 6%. I need to find the proceeds.

Hmm, I remember that when a draft is discounted, it's like getting the money earlier, but you have to subtract the discount. So the formula probably involves the discount amount subtracted from the face value.

Wait, the face value is $562.50. The discount rate is 6%, and the time is... well, the draft is 60 days, but it was discounted after 5 days because April 10 to April 15 is 5 days. So the discount period is 60 days minus the 5 days that have already passed? Or is it just the remaining days?

Wait, no. Sight drafts usually mean that payment is due on demand, but here it's a 60-day sight draft. Oh wait, maybe that means the draft is payable 60 days after the date of acceptance. So the due date is April 10 plus 60 days. Let me check: April has 30 days, so April 10 plus 60 days would be June 9th. Because April 10 to April 30 is 20 days, plus 40 days in May gets to June 9.

But wait, the discounting happened on April 15. So the time from April 15 to June 9 is... Let's see. April 15 to April 30 is 15 days, then all of May (31 days) and up to June 9 is 9 days. So 15 +31 +9 =55 days. So the discount period is 55 days.

Wait, but sometimes in banking, the discount period is calculated as the number of days remaining from the discount date to the due date. So from April 15 to June 9 is how many days? Let me calculate that correctly. April has 30 days, so from April 15 to April 30 is 15 days. Then, May has 31, and then June 9 is 9 days. So 15 +31 =46, plus 9 is 55 days. Yes, that's correct.

So the discount is calculated on the face value multiplied by the rate, multiplied by the time in years. Since the rate is 6%, and the time is 55 days. But wait, how do you convert days into years? Typically, it's 360 days a year in some calculations, or 365 in others. I think for simple discounting, it's often 360.

So the discount would be 562.50 * 6% * (55/360).

Let me calculate that. 6% is 0.06. 55 divided by 360 is approximately 0.1527778.

So 562.50 * 0.06 = 33.75. Then 33.75 multiplied by 55/360. Let me compute that.

Wait, no, the correct order is 562.50 * 0.06 * (55/360). Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 55/360 is approximately 0.15277778.

Then, 562.50 * 0.06 = 33.75.

Now, 33.75 * 0.15277778. Let's compute that.

33.75 * 0.15 is 5.0625. 0.00277778 * 33.75 is approximately 0.09375. So total discount is about 5.0625 + 0.09375 = 5.15625.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 55/360 is 0.152777... So 33.75 * 0.15277778.

Alternatively, 55 * 0.06 = 3.3. Then 3.3 divided by 360 is 0.009166667. Then multiplied by 562.50.

Wait, maybe I should compute it as (562.50 * 6%) * (55/360). Let me think.

Wait, 562.50 * 0.06 = 33.75. Then 33.75 * (55/360) = ?

55/360 is 11/72 ≈ 0.1527778.

So 33.75 * 11/72. Let's compute 33.75 * 11 = 371.25. Then divide by 72.

371.25 ÷72. Let's see: 72 *5=360, so 5 times with a remainder of 11.25. 11.25/72 is 0.15625. So 5.15625.

So the discount is $5.15625.

So the proceeds would be the face value minus discount: 562.50 -5.15625 = 557.34375.

Looking at the options, option B is $557.34. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes in these calculations, the discount is computed using 360 days, but sometimes it's 365. Let me check if that's the case here.

If it's 365 days, then 55/365 = 0.1506849.

So 562.50 * 0.06 = 33.75. Then 33.75 * 0.1506849 ≈ 5.08789.

So discount would be approximately $5.08789. Then proceeds would be 562.50 -5.08789 = 557.4121, which is about 557.41. But in the options, the closest is B:557.34 and D:555.34, E:559.90. So my initial calculation with 360 days gives 557.34, which is option B.

Wait, but another approach: the exact days from April 15 to June 9 is 55 days, as I calculated earlier. So using 360 days in a year, the time factor is 55/360.

Wait another thing: for a sight draft, the due date is 60 days after acceptance, which was April 10. So due date is June 9. So the time when discounted on April 15 is (June 9 - April 15) days, which is 55 days. So yes, 55 days.

So the discount calculation is correct as 5.15625, so proceeds are 557.34375, which rounds to 557.34, option B.

To calculate the proceeds from discounting the 60-day sight draft, we start with the face value of $562.50 and subtract the discount. The discount is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Discount} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Discount Rate} \times \frac{\text{Discount Period (in days)}}{\text{Days in Year}}
\]

Here:
- **Face Value** = $562.50
- **Discount Rate** = 6% = 0.06
- **Discount Period** = 55 days (from April 15 to June 9)
- **Days in Year** = 360 (commonly used in banking calculations)

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Discount} = 562.50 \times 0.06 \times \frac{55}{360}
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{55}{360} \approx 0.1527778 \). Then:

\[
562.50 \times 0.06 = 33.75
\]

\[
\text{Discount} = 33.75 \times 0.1527778 \approx 5.15625
\]

The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 562.50 - 5.15625 = 557.34375
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the proceeds are $557.34. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**B: $557.34**
