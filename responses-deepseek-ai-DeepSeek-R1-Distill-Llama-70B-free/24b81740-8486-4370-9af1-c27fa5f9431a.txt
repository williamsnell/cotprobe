Question:

A 29-year-old Hispanic woman, gravida 3, para 3, comes to the office because of recurrent low back pain during the past year. Rest and analgesics usually eradicate the pain within 2 weeks. However, the pain seems to recur every 2 to 3 months. Medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. She takes no medications except for an oral contraceptive. She walks 3 miles daily for exercise and works as a sales representative for a computer software company. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 lb); BMI is 37 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal, and physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Options:

A: Refer for chiropractic treatment
B: Order a CT scan of the lumbosacral spine
C: Prescribe stronger painkillers
D: Suggest a change in occupation
E: Recommend beginning a weight loss program
F: Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine
G: Administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone
H: Recommend surgery

Okay, so I've got this medical question to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The patient is a 29-year-old Hispanic woman. She's gravida 3, para 3, which means she's had three pregnancies and three births. She's coming in with recurrent low back pain over the past year. The pain usually goes away with rest and analgesics within two weeks, but it keeps coming back every 2-3 months.

Her medical history includes gestational diabetes during her pregnancies. She's taking an oral contraceptive and doesn't take any other medications. She walks three miles daily for exercise, so she's active, but her job is as a sales representative for a software company. That might mean she's sitting a lot at work.

Her BMI is 37, which is in the obese category. Obesity can contribute to back pain because of the extra weight putting strain on the spine. Her physical exam is normal, so no red flags there.

The question is asking what the most appropriate next step is from the given options.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Refer for chiropractic treatment. Chiropractic can help with back pain, especially if it's musculoskeletal. But since she's had recurrent issues, maybe it's more about weight contributing to the problem.

Option B: Order a CT scan. CT scans are good for detailed images, but without any red flags like trauma, cancer, or neurological symptoms, imaging might not be necessary yet. Plus, she's young, so maybe it's more mechanical.

Option C: Prescribe stronger painkillers. She's been using analgesics, which work, but stronger ones might not be the best approach. Obesity might mean she'd benefit more from weight loss rather than more meds.

Option D: Suggest a change in occupation. Her job is desk-based, which could contribute to back pain if she's sitting a lot. But she's also walking three miles a day, so maybe her activity level is sufficient. Changing jobs seems a bit drastic without trying other options first.

Option E: Recommend a weight loss program. Given her BMI is 37, obesity is a significant issue. Excess weight can put strain on the lower back, leading to recurrent pain. This seems like a likely good option because addressing the weight might reduce the frequency of back issues.

Option F: Order MRI. MRI is more detailed, but again, without red flags or severe symptoms, imaging might not be indicated yet. She doesn't have neurological deficits mentioned.

Option G: Epidural injection. That's usually for more severe cases, maybe with radiculopathy. She doesn't seem to have that, so this might be too aggressive.

Option H: Recommend surgery. Surgery is a last resort for back pain unless there's a clear indication like herniated discs with nerve issues. She doesn't have any signs of that.

Considering all this, her back pain is likely mechanical and related to her weight. Since she's obese, weight loss could significantly reduce the strain on her spine and help with the back pain. Other options like chiropractic or painkillers might provide temporary relief but don't address the underlying issue.

So the best next step is probably recommending a weight loss program.

The patient is a 29-year-old woman with recurrent low back pain, likely mechanical in nature, given her obesity (BMI 37). Her weight places additional strain on her spine, contributing to the pain. She has no red flags for serious conditions like neurological deficits or trauma, and her physical exam is normal. While options like chiropractic care or painkillers might provide temporary relief, they do not address the root cause. Weight loss would reduce the strain on her spine and is the most appropriate next step.
