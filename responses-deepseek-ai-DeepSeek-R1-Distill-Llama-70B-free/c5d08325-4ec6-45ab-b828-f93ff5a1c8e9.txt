Okay, so I've got this problem here where Pauline DiLorenzo wants to buy a store, and I need to figure out the return on her investment. Hmm, let's see. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the store is valued at $26,000, and she's getting a mortgage for $23,000. That means she's putting down the difference, right? So the down payment must be $26,000 minus $23,000. Let me calculate that: 26,000 - 23,000 equals $3,000. So she's investing $3,000 of her own money.

Now, the mortgage rate is 5.5% per annum. But wait, do I need to calculate the mortgage payments? Or is the interest on the mortgage part of her expenses? Hmm, the question is about return on investment, which usually looks at the net profit relative to her investment.

The problem gives her gross income as $3,500 and expenses as $1,800. So I think I need to figure out her net income from the property and then see what return that gives on her $3,000 investment.

Let me think about this. Gross income is the total income before expenses. So her expenses are $1,800. So net income would be gross minus expenses: 3,500 - 1,800. That equals $1,700 per year. Oh wait, but wait—does that include the mortgage payment as part of the expenses? Because the mortgage is a significant expense. Hmm, the way the question is phrased, it just says expenses are $1,800. So maybe that's all her expenses, including the mortgage. Or does the mortgage get treated separately?

Wait, no. The problem says she obtains a mortgage for $23,000 at 5.5% per annum. So perhaps the mortgage's annual interest is part of her expenses. But the problem states her expenses are $1,800. Maybe that's her operating expenses, not including the mortgage. Or maybe the $1,800 includes everything except the mortgage. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Wait, let me re-read the problem. It says, "She obtains a mortgage for $23,000 at a rate of 5.5% per annum. If her gross income is $3,500 and her expenses are $1,800..." Hmm, so perhaps the $1,800 are her total expenses, including mortgage payments. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the expenses don't include the mortgage, so I have to calculate the mortgage payment and add that to her expenses. But that complicates things because calculating mortgage payments requires knowing the term, which isn't given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the approach is simpler. The return on investment is calculated as net operating income divided by the down payment. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about what's given.

She's buying a property for $26k, putting down $3k, and getting a mortgage of $23k. Her gross income is $3,500 a year, and her expenses are $1,800 a year. So her net income before considering the mortgage would be 3,500 - 1,800 = $1,700. But wait, she has to pay the mortgage, which is an expense, right? So the $1,800 expenses might not include the mortgage. So perhaps I need to calculate her mortgage payment and subtract that as well.

So, the mortgage is $23,000 at 5.5% annual interest. But without knowing the term (like 20 or 30 years), I can't calculate the exact payment. Wait, but maybe the question is considering only the interest part of the mortgage payment for the first year? Because sometimes, for ROI, they look at cash flow before debt service. Or maybe it's using the simple interest.

If I assume that the mortgage interest per year is 5.5% of $23,000, then that's 0.055 * 23,000 = let's see: 23,000 * 0.055. 23 * 0.055 is 1.265, so 1.265 * 1000 is $1,265. So the annual mortgage interest is $1,265.

So her total expenses would be the given $1,800 plus the mortgage interest of $1,265? That would be 1,800 + 1,265 = $3,065.

Wait, but that would make her net income 3,500 (gross) minus 3,065 (total expenses) = $435. Then, her return on investment would be (435 / 3000) * 100. Let's calculate that: 435 ÷ 3,000 is 0.145, so 14.5%. Hmm, 14.5% is option E.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem says her expenses are $1,800. So perhaps that already includes the mortgage. So I don't need to calculate the mortgage interest. So her net income would be 3,500 minus 1,800, which is $1,700. Then ROI is 1,700 / 3,000 = 0.5667, which is about 56.67%. But that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the $1,800 expenses are operating expenses, and the mortgage is a separate expense. But without knowing how much the mortgage actually costs per year, I can't proceed. So maybe the problem expects me to ignore the mortgage payment and just use the given expenses.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the cash flow from the investment, not accounting for the mortgage payments. But that seems unlikely because the mortgage is a liability against the property.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the net cash flow, which is gross income minus operating expenses and mortgage payments. But without knowing the mortgage payment, I can't compute that. So maybe the problem expects me to consider the mortgage's annual interest as an expense.

So, let's proceed with that. So, annual mortgage interest is 5.5% of $23,000, which is $1,265. So total expenses would be 1,800 + 1,265 = $3,065.

Gross income is $3,500. So net income is 3,500 - 3,065 = $435.

Then, ROI is net income divided by her investment (down payment). So 435 / 3,000 = 0.145, which is 14.5% — option E.

But wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the cash flow before taxes and interest, which is called EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage interest is not considered an expense in this calculation, and the $1,800 expenses already include all other costs except the mortgage. But in that case, how would she repay the mortgage? It doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the down payment as the investment and the net operating income as the profit. So maybe net operating income is $1,700, and then ROI is 1,700 / 3,000 = 56.67%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the return on equity, which is net income divided by the down payment. But if the net income is $1,700, then 1,700 / 3,000 is 56.67% again. No option matches that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is considering the cash flow after mortgage payments. So her gross income is $3,500, and her total expenses (including mortgage) are $1,800 plus mortgage payment.

Wait, but without knowing the mortgage payment, I can't compute that. Unless it's a simple interest calculation. If the mortgage is $23,000 at 5.5%, the annual interest is $1,265.

So her total expenses would be $1,800 (other expenses) + $1,265 (interest) = $3,065. Then net income is $3,500 - $3,065 = $435. So ROI is 435 / 3,000 = 14.5%, which is option E.

That seems plausible. So the answer would be E: 14.5%.

To determine the return on Pauline DiLorenzo's investment, we start by calculating her down payment, which is the difference between the store's value and the mortgage amount:

\[
\text{Down Payment} = \$26,000 - \$23,000 = \$3,000
\]

Next, we calculate her net income. The problem states her gross income is \$3,500 and her expenses are \$1,800. However, the mortgage interest must also be considered as an expense. The annual mortgage interest is calculated as:

\[
\text{Mortgage Interest} = 5.5\% \times \$23,000 = 0.055 \times 23,000 = \$1,265
\]

Adding this to her operating expenses:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \$1,800 + \$1,265 = \$3,065
\]

Now, her net income is:

\[
\text{Net Income} = \text{Gross Income} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$3,500 - \$3,065 = \$435
\]

The return on investment (ROI) is calculated as the net income divided by the down payment:

\[
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Down Payment}} = \frac{\$435}{\$3,000} = 0.145 \times 100 = 14.5\%
\]

Thus, the return on her investment is **14.5%**, which corresponds to option **E**.
