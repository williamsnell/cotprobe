Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about Mr. Brown's commission. Hmm, so he gets a commission on his sales, and there's a bit of a twist with an additional percentage if he goes above a million. I need to figure out how much he earns when he sells $1,200,000 worth of goods.

Alright, first, let's break down the problem. The commission structure is tiered. So for every sale he makes, he gets 1% commission on all his sales. But if he sells more than $1,000,000, he gets an extra 1.5% on the amount that's over a million. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's phrased is "additional 1(1/2)% on all of his sales above $1,000,000." So, does that mean he gets 1% on the entire sale, plus 1.5% on the part that's over a million? Or is it that the commission structure changes to 2.5% beyond a million? Hmm, I think it's the first interpretation. Because it says an additional 1.5% on the sales above a million.

So, the total commission would be two parts: 1% on the entire amount, plus 1.5% on the amount exceeding $1,000,000.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure. Because sometimes these commission structures can be a bit tricky. So, the problem states: he receives a 1% commission on all his sales. Then, he gets an additional 1.5% on all of his sales above $1,000,000. So, the additional is on top of the 1% for the portion over a million. So, for the first million, it's 1%, and for the amount above that, it's 1% + 1.5% = 2.5%. Or wait, noâ€”maybe the 1.5% is only the additional part, so it's 1% on everything, and then 1.5% on the part above a million. So the total would be 1% on all, plus 1.5% on the overage.

Wait, let's think in terms of calculations. Let me take the total sales as $1,200,000. So the first $1,000,000, he gets 1% commission. The remaining $200,000, he gets 1% plus an extra 1.5%, so 2.5% on that part. Or wait, no, the question says he receives an additional 1.5% on all sales above $1,000,000. So perhaps the structure is: 1% on the entire sale, and then 1.5% extra on the part over a million. So that would be total commission: (1% of total) + (1.5% of (total - 1,000,000)).

Wait, that makes sense. Because he gets the base 1% on everything, and then an extra 1.5% on the part that's over a million. So let's calculate that.

So, total sales are $1,200,000. The first part is 1% of 1,200,000. Then, the amount over a million is 200,000. On that, he gets an additional 1.5%.

Calculating step by step:

Base commission: 1% of 1,200,000. 1% is 0.01, so 0.01 * 1,200,000 = 12,000.

Additional commission: 1.5% of (1,200,000 - 1,000,000) = 1.5% of 200,000. 1.5% is 0.015, so 0.015 * 200,000 = 3,000.

So total commission is 12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000.

Wait, but let me double-check. Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the question again.

"Mr. Brown receives a 1% commission on all his sales. He receives an additional 1(1/2)% on all of his sales above $1,000,000."

So, yes, all of his sales above a million get an extra 1.5%. So the base is 1% on everything, plus 1.5% on the overage.

Another way to look at it: For the first million, it's 1% of 1,000,000, which is 10,000. For the next 200,000, it's 1% (which is 2,000) plus 1.5% (which is 3,000), totaling 5,000 on the 200,000. So total would be 10,000 + 5,000 = 15,000. So that's another way to get 15,000.

Looking at the options, option C is $15,000. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me compute it again.

Total sales: 1,200,000.

First, 1% of 1,200,000 is 12,000.

Then, the amount above 1,000,000 is 200,000. The additional commission on this is 1.5% of 200,000.

1.5% is 0.015, so 200,000 * 0.015 = 3,000.

So total commission is 12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000. Yep, that matches.

So the correct answer should be C: $15,000.

Mr. Brown's commission structure is tiered. He earns a base commission of 1% on all his sales. Additionally, he receives an extra 1.5% on the portion of his sales that exceeds $1,000,000. 

Given his total sales of $1,200,000, the calculation is as follows:

1. **Base commission**: 1% of $1,200,000  
   \[
   0.01 \times 1,200,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Additional commission**: 1.5% on the amount above $1,000,000, which is $200,000  
   \[
   0.015 \times 200,000 = 3,000
   \]

3. **Total commission**:  
   \[
   12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000
   \]

Thus, Mr. Brown earns a total of $15,000. The correct answer is **C**.
