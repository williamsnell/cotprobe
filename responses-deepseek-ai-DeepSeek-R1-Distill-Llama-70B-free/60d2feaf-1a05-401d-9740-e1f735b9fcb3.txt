Okay, so I'm trying to solve this initial value problem, and then find the first time when the absolute value of u(t) equals 10. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The equation given is 3u'' - u' + 2u = 0. It's a linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. I remember that to solve these, I should find the characteristic equation first.

So the characteristic equation would be 3r² - r + 2 = 0. Right? Because I replace u'' with r², u' with r, and u with 1.

Let me solve this quadratic equation for r. The quadratic formula is r = [1 ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=3, b=-1, c=2.

Calculating the discriminant: b² -4ac = (-1)^2 -4*3*2 = 1 -24 = -23. Oh, so the discriminant is negative, which means the roots are complex. So the general solution will involve exponential functions with sine and cosine terms.

The roots are complex, so r = [1 ± sqrt(-23)]/(2*3) → (1 ± i√23)/6. So the real part is 1/6 and the imaginary part is sqrt(23)/6.

So the general solution is u(t) = e^(α t) [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)], where α is the real part and β is the imaginary part. So α = 1/6, β = sqrt(23)/6.

So u(t) = e^(t/6) [C1 cos( (sqrt(23)/6) t ) + C2 sin( (sqrt(23)/6) t ) ]

Now, I need to apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2.

Given u(0) = 2. Plugging t=0 into u(t):

u(0) = e^0 [C1 cos(0) + C2 sin(0)] = 1*(C1*1 + C2*0) => C1 = 2.

Next, find u'(t) to apply the second initial condition u'(0) = 0.

First, find the derivative of u(t):

u'(t) = derivative of e^(t/6) times the bracket plus e^(t/6) times derivative of the bracket.

So u'(t) = (1/6)e^(t/6) [C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)] + e^(t/6) [ -C1 β sin(β t) + C2 β cos(β t) ]

Factor out e^(t/6):

u'(t) = e^(t/6) [ (1/6)(C1 cos(β t) + C2 sin(β t)) ) + ( -C1 β sin(β t) + C2 β cos(β t) ) ]

Now evaluate u'(0):

At t=0, cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0.

So u'(0) = e^0 [ (1/6)(C1*1 + C2*0) + ( -C1 β *0 + C2 β *1 ) ]

Simplify: 1 * [ (C1/6) + (C2 β) ] = 0.

We know C1 is 2, so substituting:

(2/6) + C2 β = 0 → (1/3) + C2 β = 0 → C2 = (-1/3) / β.

Compute β: sqrt(23)/6. So C2 = (-1/3) / (sqrt(23)/6) ) = (-1/3) * (6/sqrt(23)) )= (-2)/sqrt(23).

So now, the specific solution is:

u(t) = e^(t/6) [ 2 cos( (sqrt(23)/6) t ) - (2/sqrt(23)) sin( (sqrt(23)/6) t ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can write this in a different form, like amplitude and phase shift, to make it easier to find when |u(t)|=10.

An expression of the form A e^(α t) cos(β t + φ) would be helpful, because then |u(t)| = A e^(α t) |cos(β t + φ)|, but wait, no, because in the expression, it's C1 cos + C2 sin. So actually, it's better to write it as a single cosine function with a phase shift.

So, u(t) = e^(t/6) [ 2 cos(ω t) + (something) sin(ω t) ]

Wait, the general form is C1 cos(ω t) + C2 sin(ω t) = A cos(ω t - δ), where A = sqrt(C1² + C2²), and tan δ = C2 / C1.

So here, C1=2, C2= -2/sqrt(23).

So A = sqrt( (2)^2 + ( (-2/sqrt(23)) )^2 ) = sqrt(4 + (4/23)) ) = sqrt( (92 +4)/23 ) = sqrt(96/23) = sqrt(96)/sqrt(23) = (4 sqrt(6))/sqrt(23).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor that differently, but let's compute it numerically.

Compute A: 96 /23 is about 4.1739. So sqrt(4.1739) ≈ 2.043.

So A ≈ 2.043.

Wait, perhaps exact expressions are better for now.

So, A = sqrt( (4) + (4/23) ) = sqrt( (92 +4)/23 ) = sqrt(96/23 ) = (4 * sqrt(6)) / sqrt(23) )

Wait, but I can rationalize the denominator: sqrt(96/23) = sqrt(96)/sqrt(23) = 4*sqrt(6)/sqrt(23) = 4 sqrt(138)/23? No, that's not correct. Wait, sqrt(96) = 4*sqrt(6), yes. So A = 4 sqrt(6)/sqrt(23) = 4 sqrt(138)/23? No, because sqrt(6)/sqrt(23) = sqrt(6*23)/23 = sqrt(138)/23. So 4 * sqrt(138)/23. So A is (4 sqrt(138))/23.

Hmm, but perhaps I can leave it as sqrt(96/23) for now.

Then, the phase angle δ is given by tan δ = C2/C1 = (-2/sqrt(23)) / 2 = (-1)/sqrt(23). So δ = arctangent of (-1/sqrt(23)).

So δ is negative, which makes sense because C2 is negative. So the solution can be written as:

u(t) = A e^(t/6) cos( ω t + δ ), but I'm not sure about the sign. Alternatively, perhaps it's cos(ω t - δ). Wait, the formula is C1 cos θ + C2 sin θ = A cos(θ - δ), where tan δ = C2/C1.

So here, δ is positive if C2 and C1 are positive, but since C2 is negative, δ will be in a different quadrant.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute δ as arctan( C2 / C1 ), which is arctan( (-2/sqrt(23))/2 ) = arctan( -1/sqrt(23) ). So δ is negative, or in the fourth quadrant.

So, the solution becomes:

u(t) = A e^{t/6} cos( (sqrt(23)/6) t - δ )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way. Alternatively, I could write it as A e^{t/6} cos(ω t + φ), where φ is the phase shift.

But perhaps for the purpose of finding when |u(t)|=10, it's better to stick with the original form.

So u(t) is e^{t/6} multiplied by a combination of cosine and sine terms. The exponential term is growing since the exponent is positive (1/6 is positive). So as t increases, the amplitude grows.

We need to find the smallest t>0 where |u(t)|=10. Since the exponential is always positive, it's the same as u(t) reaches 10 or -10. But since the initial condition u(0)=2 is positive, and the exponential is growing, but the oscillatory part may cause it to dip below zero. Wait, but the exponential is growing, so maybe the first time it reaches 10 is when the cosine term is at its peak.

Wait, but let's think about the behavior. At t=0, u(0)=2. Then, as t increases, the exponential grows. The oscillatory part (cos and sin) will cause u(t) to oscillate with increasing amplitude.

So the function u(t) will oscillate between e^{t/6}*(some maximum and minimum values). The maximums and minimums occur when the derivative is zero, but perhaps it's easier to find when u(t) reaches 10 by solving the equation.

But solving u(t)=10 would involve solving a transcendental equation, which might not be possible analytically. So perhaps I need to approximate the solution numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express u(t) in terms of a single cosine function with phase shift, then find when the amplitude times e^{t/6} times cosine equals 10.

Wait, the amplitude A is the coefficient in front of the cosine when the solution is written in the form A e^{α t} cos(β t + φ). So in that case, the maximum possible value of u(t) is A e^{α t}, and the minimum is -A e^{α t}.

Wait no, the amplitude is A e^{α t}, so the function oscillates between ± A e^{α t}.

Wait, no, because in the form u(t)=A e^{α t} cos(beta t + phi), the maximum value is A e^{alpha t}, and minimum is -A e^{alpha t}.

But in this case, alpha is positive (1/6), so A e^{alpha t} grows exponentially. So the 'envelope' of the oscillation is A e^{t/6}.

So, for |u(t)|=10, the function must touch either 10 or -10. But since the envelope is growing, the first time |u(t)|=10 would be the first time when the oscillating part reaches 10/A e^{t/6} equals 1 in absolute value.

Wait, let me think again. Let me denote the amplitude as A e^{t/6}, so |u(t)| = A e^{t/6} |cos(...)|. To have |u(t)|=10, we need A e^{t/6} |cos(...)| =10.

The maximum of |cos(...)| is 1, so the earliest time when this can happen is when cos(...) equals 1 or -1. Therefore, the first time when |u(t)|=10 is when A e^{t/6} =10, because that's when the envelope reaches 10, and the cosine term would be at its peak.

Wait, but this would only be true if the cosine term reaches 1 at that same t. So we have to ensure that at the time when A e^{t/6} =10, the argument of the cosine is an integer multiple of 2π, making cos(...) =1.

But that might not necessarily be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first time when |u(t)|=10 occurs at the first peak of the envelope.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate. Let's compute A.

Earlier, we found A = sqrt( (2)^2 + ( (-2)/sqrt(23) )^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 4/23) = sqrt( (92 +4)/23 ) = sqrt(96/23 )

Compute 96/23: 23*4=92, so 96/23=4 + 4/23 ≈4.1739. So sqrt(4.1739)= approx 2.043.

So A ≈ 2.043.

So the envelope is A e^{t/6} = 2.043 e^{t/6}.

We want this envelope to reach 10, so 2.043 e^{t/6} =10 → e^{t/6}=10/2.043 ≈4.896.

Take natural log: t/6 = ln(4.896) → t=6 * ln(4.896).

Compute ln(4.896): ln(5) is about 1.6094, 4.896 is a bit less than 5, so maybe around 1.587.

So t ≈6 *1.587 ≈9.522.

Wait, but this would be the time when the envelope reaches 10, implying that the maximum possible u(t) is 10. But the actual u(t) may reach 10 earlier because the cosine term could be 1 earlier than that.

Wait, no, the envelope is the maximum possible value at any time t, so the first time u(t) reaches 10 would be when the envelope reaches 10, and the cosine term is 1. So t would be around 9.522.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A: 14.1234

B:9.5678

C:10.7598

D:16.4321

E:15.6789

F:11.2345

G:12.3456

H:7.6543

I:13.5791

J:8.9876

Wait, my approximate t is around 9.52. Among the options, option B is 9.5678, which is very close. Option J is 8.98, which is lower, perhaps that's the first time when the cosine term is negative and the envelope reaches 10 in the negative direction, but since the initial condition starts at positive, maybe the first time it reaches 10 is when the envelope is positive.

Wait, but perhaps the first time |u(t)|=10 occurs when the function reaches 10, which would be at t≈9.52, which is option B (9.5678). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to solve A e^{t/6} =10 → t=6 ln(10/A).

Compute A: sqrt(96/23) → exact value is sqrt(96)/sqrt(23) = (4 sqrt(6))/sqrt(23) = 4 sqrt(138)/23, but perhaps it's better to compute it numerically.

Compute 96/23: 23*4=92, 96-92=4 → 4/23 ≈0.1739 → 96/23=4.1739.

sqrt(4.1739)= approx 2.043.

So A≈2.043, so 10/A≈4.896.

ln(4.896)≈1.588.

So t=6*1.588≈9.528.

Looking at the options, option B is 9.5678 which is very close. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 96/23 exactly: 23*4=92, so 96=23*4 +4 → 96/23=4 +4/23=4.173913.

sqrt(4.173913) = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

Calculate sqrt(4.173913):

We know that 2^2=4, 2.04^2=4.1616, 2.05^2=4.2025.

So 4.173913 is between 2.04^2 and 2.05^2.

Compute 2.04^2=4.1616.

4.173913-4.1616=0.012313.

The difference between 2.04 and 2.05 is 0.01 in x, which leads to 4.2025-4.1616=0.0409 in y.

So 0.012313/0.0409 ≈0.301 of the interval.

So x ≈2.04 + 0.301*(0.01)=2.04 +0.00301≈2.04301.

So sqrt(4.173913)=≈2.0430.

So A=2.0430.

Then 10/A=10/2.0430≈4.896.

Compute ln(4.896):

We know ln(4)=1.386294, ln(5)=1.60944.

Compute ln(4.896):

Let me use a calculator approach. Let me compute it as ln(4.896) = ?

I can write 4.896 = 4.8 * 1.02. So ln(4.8) + ln(1.02).

Wait, 4.8 is 48/10. Let me compute ln(4.8) and ln(1.02).

Alternatively, perhaps use a Taylor expansion around e^1.58.

Wait, perhaps better to use the fact that e^1.58 = ?

Compute e^1.58:

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.08 ≈1 +0.08 +0.08²/2 +0.08³/6 ≈1 +0.08 +0.0032 +0.000341 ≈1.083541.

So e^1.58= e^1.5 * e^0.08 ≈4.4817 *1.083541 ≈4.4817*1.08=4.835, and 4.4817*0.003541≈0.01586, so total ≈4.8508.

Which is less than 4.896.

Wait, e^1.58≈4.8508.

We need e^x=4.896, so x=1.58 + delta.

Compute the difference: 4.896-4.8508=0.0452.

The derivative of e^x at x=1.58 is e^1.58≈4.8508.

So delta ≈0.0452 /4.8508≈0.00932.

So x≈1.58 +0.00932≈1.5893.

So ln(4.896)=≈1.5893.

Thus, t=6 *1.5893≈9.5358.

So approximately 9.5358. The closest option is B:9.5678, which is about 0.032 difference. Hmm,
