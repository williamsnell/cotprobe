Question:

A contractor agreed to remodel a homeowner's garage for $5,000. Just before the parties signed the one-page written contract, the homeowner called to the contractor's attention the fact that the contract did not specify a time of completion. The parties orally agreed but did not specify in the contract that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days, and then they both signed the contract. The contract did not contain a merger clause. The contractor failed to finish the work in 60 days. The homeowner has sued the contractor for breach of contract. Is the court likely to admit evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement that the work would be completed in 60 days?

Options:

A: No, because the oral agreement contradicts the written contract.
B: Yes, because the homeowner brought up the time limit before signing the contract.
C: Yes, because the homeowner can provide evidence of the oral agreement.
D: Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.
E: No, because the oral agreement is considered hearsay.
F: No, because the contract is a fully integrated written contract.
G: Yes, because the court can consider oral agreements in absence of a merger clause.
H: No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.
I: Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.
J: No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the scenario is that a contractor and a homeowner have a contract to remodel a garage for $5,000. Right before they signed the written contract, the homeowner pointed out that the contract didn't specify a completion time. They orally agreed that the contractor would finish in 60 days but didn't write that into the contract. Then they signed it. The contract didn't have a merger clause. Now, the contractor didn't finish on time, and the homeowner is suing for breach. The question is whether the court will allow evidence of their oral agreement about the 60-day completion.

The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when a written contract exists, the parol evidence rule usually applies. Parol evidence rule says that prior or contemporaneous negotiations and agreements can't contradict a fully integrated written contract. But wait, there's a difference between fully integrated and partially integrated contracts. A fully integrated contract is meant to be the final and complete agreement between the parties, so no extrinsic evidence is allowed. A partially integrated contract only covers some terms, so other terms can exist outside.

In this case, the contract didn't include the time of completion. They had an oral agreement on that, but didn't write it in, so the written contract doesn't mention it. Also, there's no merger clause, which usually states that the written agreement is the complete and final version.

So, under the parol evidence rule, if the written contract is fully integrated, evidence of prior agreements can't be used to contradict it. But if it's partially integrated, then evidence of other terms is allowed as long as they don't contradict the written terms.

Wait, but in this case, the oral agreement was made at the same time as the written contract, right? So it's a contemporaneous agreement. The parol evidence rule applies to prior or contemporaneous agreements. If the written contract is fully integrated, then any prior or contemporaneous agreements are merged into it and can't be used. But if it's partially integrated, then some extrinsic evidence might be allowed.

The contract here doesn't have a merger clause, which is a clue. Without a merger clause, it's harder to argue that it's fully integrated. But sometimes, the circumstances can indicate whether it's fully integrated. Since they left out the time term, perhaps the written contract is only partially integrated. That would mean that the oral agreement about the time could be admissible as an additional term.

Wait, but another thought: the written contract is one page and covers the remodeling for $5,000. The time of completion was discussed and agreed upon orally but not included. So the written contract doesn't mention time, which suggests that it's not covering all the terms. Therefore, it's a partially integrated contract. So the parol evidence rule wouldn't exclude the oral agreement about the time because that term isn't in the written contract.

So the court would allow evidence of the oral agreement because it's an additional term that doesn't contradict the written contract. Looking at the options, option D says: "Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract." That makes sense.

Other options: Option F says no because it's fully integrated. But without a merger clause and since a term is missing, it's probably not fully integrated. Option G says yes because there's no merger clause. That's a factor, but the main point is whether it's fully or partially integrated. Option J says no because it's part of negotiations, but since it was a contemporaneous oral agreement, it's more than just negotiations.

So I think the correct answer is D.
</think>

The court is likely to admit evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement because the written contract did not include the time of completion, indicating it is partially integrated rather than fully integrated. Without a merger clause, the oral agreement about the 60-day completion can be considered as an additional term that does not contradict the written contract. 

Answer: D
