Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hmm, I remember from my notes that Hardy-Weinberg is all about population genetics and calculating allele frequencies. The question says it's an autosomal recessive trait expressed in 1% of the population. They want to know the percentage of carriers who don't show the trait.

Wait, right. For a recessive trait, the affected individuals are homozygous recessive. So the frequency of the trait is q squared, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele. The question says 1% have the trait, so q² = 0.01. That means q is the square root of 0.01, which is 0.1. So q is 0.1.

Now, carriers are the heterozygotes. The frequency of heterozygotes in a population is 2pq. Since p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is recessive, and p + q =1. So p would be 1 - q, which is 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.

Putting that into 2pq: 2 * 0.9 * 0.1. Let's calculate that. 0.9 times 0.1 is 0.09, times 2 is 0.18. So that's 18% carriers.

Looking at the options, option J is 18%. So the answer should be J.

To determine the percentage of the population that are carriers of an autosomal recessive trait but do not express it, we use the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principles. 

1. The frequency of the recessive trait (q²) is given as 1% (0.01). Solving for q, the frequency of the recessive allele:  
   \[
   q = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.1
   \]

2. The frequency of the dominant allele (p) is:  
   \[
   p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9
   \]

3. The frequency of heterozygous carriers (2pq) is:  
   \[
   2pq = 2(0.9)(0.1) = 0.18
   \]

Thus, 18% of the population are carriers but do not express the trait. 

The correct answer is **J: 18%**.
