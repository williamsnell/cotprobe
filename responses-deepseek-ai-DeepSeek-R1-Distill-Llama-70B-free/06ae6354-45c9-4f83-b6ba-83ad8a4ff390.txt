Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve: the limit as x approaches 0 of (csc(x) - cot(x)). Hmm, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with trigonometric limits, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that csc(x) is the reciprocal of sin(x), so csc(x) = 1/sin(x). Similarly, cot(x) is cos(x)/sin(x). So the expression becomes [1/sin(x) - cos(x)/sin(x)]. Oh wait, since they have the same denominator, I can combine them. That would be [1 - cos(x)] / sin(x) all over 1. Wait, no, let me write it out properly.

So, csc(x) - cot(x) = (1/sin(x)) - (cos(x)/sin(x)) = [1 - cos(x)] / sin(x). Right, that's the combined fraction.

Now, the limit is as x approaches 0. I remember that as x approaches 0, sin(x) is approximately x, and cos(x) is approximately 1 - (x²/2). So maybe I can use these approximations.

Let me substitute x with a small value, but perhaps it's better to use L’Hospital’s Rule. Because when x approaches 0, both the numerator and denominator approach 0. Let's see: the numerator is 1 - cos(x), and denominator is sin(x). As x approaches 0, sin(x) approaches 0 and cos(x) approaches 1, so numerator approaches 0 and denominator approaches 0. So it's a 0/0 indeterminate form. That means L’Hospital’s Rule applies.

Wait, but wait, I also remember that for small x, 1 - cos(x) is approximately x²/2, and sin(x) is approximately x. So [1 - cos(x)] / sin(x) ≈ (x²/2) / x = x/2. So as x approaches 0, this expression approaches 0. Wait, but that would make the limit 0. But wait, looking at the options, option E is 0. Hmm. But I'm not so sure. Maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, I can use series expansions. Let's expand 1 - cos(x) and sin(x) using their Taylor series around 0. 

1 - cos(x) = (x²/2) - (x^4/24) + ... and sin(x) = x - x^3/6 + x^5/120 - ... So [1 - cos(x)] / sin(x) would be (x²/2) divided by x, which is x/2. So as x approaches 0, this tends to 0. So the limit would be 0, which is option E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me try applying L’Hospital’s Rule properly. Take the function f(x) = [1 - cos(x)] / sin(x). Both numerator and denominator go to 0 as x approaches 0. So taking derivatives, numerator derivative is sin(x), denominator derivative is cos(x). So the limit becomes limit as x approaches 0 of sin(x)/cos(x) = 0/1 = 0. So same result.

But wait, wait a second. Another approach: I remember that 1 - cos(x) = 2 sin²(x/2), and sin(x) = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). So substituting these in: [2 sin²(x/2)] / [2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)] ] = [sin(x/2)] / [cos(x/2)] = tan(x/2). So the expression simplifies to tan(x/2). Then as x approaches 0, tan(x/2) approaches 0. So again, the limit is 0. So the answer would be E: 0.

Wait, but I think I've heard somewhere that the limit might be something else. Did I make a mistake in the trigonometric identities? Let me check.

Yes, 1 - cos(x) is indeed 2 sin²(x/2). And sin(x) is 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2). So [1 - cos(x)]/sin(x) becomes [2 sin²(x/2)] / [2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)].

The 2s cancel, and one sin(x/2) cancels, leaving sin(x/2) / cos(x/2) = tan(x/2). So as x approaches 0, x/2 is approaching 0, and tan(0) is 0. So the limit is indeed 0.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes when dealing with csc and cot, their difference might have a different behavior. But according to all these methods—approximations, L’Hospital, and trigonometric identities—the limit is 0.

Wait, but let me try putting in a small x value numerically. For example, x = 0.001 radians. Then sin(x) ≈ 0.00099999983, cos(x) ≈ 0.9999995. So 1 - cos(x) ≈ 0.0000005. Then [1 - cos(x)]/sin(x) ≈ 0.0000005 / 0.00099999983 ≈ 0.0005, which is 0.5e-3. So as x approaches 0, this approaches 0.

So all methods point to 0. Therefore, the correct answer should be E: 0.

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{x \to 0} (\csc(x) - \cot(x))\), we start by rewriting the expression in terms of sine and cosine:

\[
\csc(x) - \cot(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)} - \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)} = \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{\sin(x)}.
\]

Next, we analyze the behavior of the numerator and denominator as \(x \to 0\). Both \(1 - \cos(x)\) and \(\sin(x)\) approach 0, so this is a \(0/0\) indeterminate form. To resolve this, we can use L’Hospital’s Rule, which involves taking derivatives of the numerator and denominator:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{\sin(x)} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\frac{d}{dx}[1 - \cos(x)]}{\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}.
\]

As \(x \to 0\), \(\sin(x) \to 0\) and \(\cos(x) \to 1\), so:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} = \frac{0}{1} = 0.
\]

To confirm, we can also use trigonometric identities. Recall that \(1 - \cos(x) = 2\sin^2(x/2)\) and \(\sin(x) = 2\sin(x/2)\cos(x/2)\). Substituting these into the expression:

\[
\frac{1 - \cos(x)}{\sin(x)} = \frac{2\sin^2(x/2)}{2\sin(x/2)\cos(x/2)} = \frac{\sin(x/2)}{\cos(x/2)} = \tan(x/2).
\]

As \(x \to 0\), \(x/2 \to 0\), and \(\tan(x/2) \to 0\). Thus, the limit is consistent with the earlier result.

Finally, numerical testing with small values of \(x\) (e.g., \(x = 0.001\)) confirms that the expression approaches 0 as \(x \to 0\). Therefore, the limit is:

\[
\boxed{0}.
\]
