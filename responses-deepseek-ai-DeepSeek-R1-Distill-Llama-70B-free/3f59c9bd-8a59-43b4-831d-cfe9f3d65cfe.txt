Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about allele frequencies changing over generations. The gene C is mutating to c at a certain rate, and we need to find out how many generations it takes for the frequency of c to increase from 2% to 3%. Hmm, I think I remember something about mutation rates and allele frequencies from my notes.

Alright, so the mutation rate per generation is 2e-6. That's pretty low. And no other forces are acting, so selection, genetic drift, migration are all out of the picture. Mating is random, which probably means Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium applies, but with mutation, I guess that's not exactly equilibrium since the allele frequencies are changing.

Wait, mutation can cause the allele frequencies to change, even in the absence of other forces. Oh right, but how does that work in the long term? So, the mutation rate here is from C to c, but is there back mutation? The problem doesn't say, so I think we can assume it's only C mutating to c, and no reverse. So, each generation, some C alleles turn into c.

But wait, the initial frequency is 2% for c. So q is 0.02. We want to find when it becomes 0.03. So the change is 0.01 over some number of generations.

I think the formula for allele frequency change due to mutation in one direction is... Let me recall. If mutation is only from C to c at rate u per generation, then the change in q (frequency of c) each generation is given by delta q = u * (1 - q). Because each C allele has a chance u of mutating into c. So the increase in c is proportional to the number of C alleles, which is (1 - q).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the mutation is from C to c at rate u, then each C allele in the population has a probability u of becoming c each generation. So the number of new c alleles added each generation is u*(frequency of C). So delta q = u*(1 - q).

So the change in q per generation is u*(1 - q). That seems right. So it's a differential equation perhaps, since this is continuous.

Wait, but considering that u is very small, maybe we can model this with some approximation. Because when u is small, the change per generation is small, so we can model it as a differential equation, dq/dt = u*(1 - q). Then, solving this would give us the change over generations.

So the equation is dq/dt = u (1 - q). This is a first-order linear differential equation. Let's separate the variables:

dq / (1 - q) = u dt

Integrate both sides. The integral of dq/(1 - q) is -ln(1 - q) + C. The integral of u dt is u t + C.

So integrating, we have:

- ln(1 - q) = u t + C

Now, solve for C using initial conditions. At t=0, q = q0, which is 0.02.

So,

- ln(1 - 0.02) = 0 + C

So C = - ln(0.98). Let's compute that. Ln(0.98) is about -0.0202, so -ln(0.98)=0.0202. So C=0.0202.

Now, the equation is:

- ln(1 - q) = u t + 0.0202

We want to find t when q=0.03.

Substitute q=0.03:

- ln(1 - 0.03) = u t + 0.0202

Compute ln(0.97). Let me think: ln(0.97) is approximately -0.030459. So:

- (-0.030459) = u t + 0.0202

Which is 0.030459 = u t + 0.0202

So subtract 0.0202:

0.030459 - 0.0202 = u t

0.010259 = u t

u is 2e-6, which is 0.000002.

So t = 0.010259 / 0.000002 = 5,129.5 generations.

Hmm, looking at the options, option J is 5,128, which is very close. So the answer would be J.

Wait a second, but maybe I made an approximation with the logarithm. Because I used approximate values for ln(0.98) and ln(0.97). Let me check exact values.

The exact integral:
The integral of dq/(1 - q) is -ln(1 - q) + C.

So the equation after integration is:

ln(1/(1 - q)) = u t + C.

At t=0, q=0.02:

ln(1/(0.98)) = C.

So 1/0.98 is approximately 1.020408, so ln(1.020408) is about 0.0202027.

Then:

ln(1/(1 - q)) = u t + 0.0202027.

When q=0.03:

1/(1-0.03)=1/0.97 ≈1.030927.

ln(1.030927) is about 0.030332.

So:

0.030332 = u t + 0.0202027

Subtract 0.0202027:

0.030332 - 0.0202027 = 0.0101293

u=2e-6, so t=0.0101293 / 2e-6 = 0.0101293 / 0.000002 = 5076.5?

Wait, wait, no, wait: 0.0101293 divided by 0.000002 is 5,064.65.

Wait, no, 0.000002 is 2e-6, so 0.0101293 / 0.000002 = 0.0101293 / 2e-6.

Wait, 0.0101293 divided by 0.000002 is 5,064.65.

Hmm, my initial approximation gave 5,129.5, but using more precise ln values gives me around 5,064.65. But looking at the options, the closest is J:5,128, but wait, option D is 8,764, which is way off.

Wait, I might have made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. Maybe using the formula for allele frequency change with mutation-selection balance, but since there's no selection, it's just mutation.

Wait, another approach: the change in q over time when only mutation is occurring.

The standard formula is q_t = q_0 + u * (1 - q_0) * t.

Wait, is that correct? Because each generation, the increase is u*(1 - q). If we model this as a continuous process, maybe it's approximately dq/dt = u*(1 - q). But if we model it as a discrete generation process, maybe it's q_{t+1} = q_t + u*(1 - q_t). Because each generation, you add u*(1 - q) to q.

Wait, but for small u and small changes, the continuous approximation (using the differential equation) should be okay.

Wait, let's try this alternate approach. If we model each generation as a discrete step, then:

q_{t+1} = q_t + u*(1 - q_t)

This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for this.

We can rearrange this as:

q_{t+1} = q_t (1 - u) + u

This looks like a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is q_t = A (1 - u)^t + (u)/(1 - (1 - u)) ), but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the equilibrium.

Wait, the equilibrium occurs when q_{t+1} = q_t = q. So,

q = q (1 - u) + u

q = q - u q + u

Subtract q from both sides:

0 = -u q + u

So, -u q + u =0 → u (1 - q )=0 → q=1.

Hmm, that would mean the equilibrium is q=1, which makes sense because C is mutating into c, so over time, c would go to fixation.

But to find the number of generations needed to go from q0=0.02 to q=0.03:

We can model the recurrence as:

q_{t} = q0 (1 - u)^t + (1 - (1 - u)^t )

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again.

The recurrence is linear and can be solved. The homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.

Alternatively, the solution is:

q_t = (q0 - q_eq) (1 - u)^t + q_eq

Where q_eq is the equilibrium frequency, which is 1 as we saw.

So,

q_t = (0.02 - 1) (1 - u)^t + 1

Wait, that would mean q_t = 1 - 0.98 (1 - u)^t

Wait, let me plug in u=2e-6.

Let me set q_t=0.03:

0.03 = 1 - 0.98 (1 - 2e-6)^t

Rearranging:

0.98 (1 - 2e-6)^t = 1 -0.03 → 0.97

So,

(1 - 2e-6)^t = 0.97 / 0.98 ≈ 0.9897959

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

t * ln(1 - 2e-6) ) = ln(0.9897959)

Compute ln(1 - 2e-6) ≈ -2e-6 (since for small x, ln(1 - x) ≈ -x).

So,

t ≈ ln(0.9897959) / (-2e-6)

Compute ln(0.9897959):

Let me calculate that. 0.9897959 is approximately e^-0.0102 because e^-x ≈1 -x for small x.

Wait, more accurately, ln(0.9897959) = approximately -0.010204.

So,

t ≈ (-0.010204) / (-2e-6) = 0.010204 / 2e-6 ≈ 5,102 generations.

Hmm, this is about 5,100, so the closest option is J:5,128.

Wait, but in my first approach, using the differential equation, I got approximately 5,064 with more accurate ln values. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me check with more precise calculations.

Let me compute ln(0.97) and ln(0.98) more accurately.

Using a calculator:

ln(0.98) = -0.020202706.

So C = - ln(0.98) = 0.020202706.

When q=0.03,

ln(1/(1-0.03)) = ln(1/0.97) ≈ 0.0304592.

So,

0.0304592 = u t + 0.020202706

So,

u t = 0.0304592 - 0.020202706 = 0.010256494.

u is 2e-6, so t = 0.010256494 / 2e-6 = 0.010256494 / 0.000002 = 5,128.247.

So approximately 5,128.25 generations. So the closest option is J:5,128.

That's why option J is correct.

To determine how many generations are needed for the frequency of allele \( c \) to increase from 2% to 3% under the given mutation rate, we use the formula for allele frequency change due to mutation. The mutation rate \( u \) is \( 2 \times 10^{-6} \), and the change in allele frequency per generation is modeled by the differential equation:

\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = u(1 - q),
\]

where \( q \) is the frequency of allele \( c \). Separating variables and integrating:

\[
\int \frac{dq}{1 - q} = \int u \, dt,
\]

yields:

\[
-\ln(1 - q) = ut + C.
\]

Using the initial condition \( q = 0.02 \) at \( t = 0 \), we find \( C = -\ln(0.98) \approx 0.0202027 \). Substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
-\ln(1 - q) = ut + 0.0202027.
\]

At \( q = 0.03 \), we calculate:

\[
-\ln(1 - 0.03) = ut + 0.0202027.
\]

The left-hand side becomes \( -\ln(0.97) \approx 0.0304592 \). Substituting this value:

\[
0.0304592 = ut + 0.0202027.
\]

Solving for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{0.0304592 - 0.0202027}{u} = \frac{0.0102565}{2 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 5,128.25 \, \text{generations}.
\]

Thus, the closest answer is **5,128 generations**, corresponding to option **J**.
