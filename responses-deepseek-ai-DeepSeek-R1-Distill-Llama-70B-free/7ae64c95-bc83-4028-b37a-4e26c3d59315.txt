Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false, or if the information isn't provided. The options are from A to J, each combining the truth values of the two statements.

Statement 1 says, "Traditional machine learning results assume that the train and test sets are independent and identically distributed." Hmm. I remember from my studies that in traditional machine learning, a key assumption is that the training data and test data come from the same underlying distribution. This is often referred to as the "i.i.d." assumptionâ€”Independent and Identically Distributed. So, yes, I think Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: "In 2017, COCO models were usually pretrained on ImageNet." COCO is the Common Objects in Context dataset, commonly used in object detection tasks. I recall that many models, especially those used in tasks like COCO, often use transfer learning. ImageNet is a large dataset used for pretraining models, which are then fine-tuned on specific tasks. So, it makes sense that in 2017, COCO models were pretrained on ImageNet. I believe Statement 2 is true as well.

Wait, but let me think again. Was COCO itself used for pretraining, or were models pretrained on ImageNet and then trained on COCO? I think it's the latter. For example, models like ResNet were pretrained on ImageNet and then used as backbones for detectors in COCO. So yes, Statement 2 should be true.

So both statements are true. Looking at the options, option H is True, True. So the answer should be H.

The answer is H because both statements are true. 

Statement 1 correctly describes the i.i.d. assumption in traditional machine learning. Statement 2 accurately reflects that COCO models were often pretrained on ImageNet in 2017.

H: True, True

H
