Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the belt width for a pulley setup. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on belt drives, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The problem gives me a double leather belt that's 1/4 inch thick. The pulley is made of cast steel and has a diameter of 50 inches. It's rotating at 1000 rpm and transmits 100 horsepower. The coefficient of friction between the cast steel and leather is 0.40, the safe stress for the belting is 300 psi, and the joint efficiency is 70 percent. The question is asking for the belt width, and there are multiple-choice options provided.

Alright, first, I remember that for belt drives, the power transmitted depends on the belt tension, the belt speed, and the angle of wrap around the pulley. The formula for power is P = (T1 - T2) * v, where T1 and T2 are the tensions on the tight and slack sides, and v is the belt speed.

Wait, but I also remember that for a crossed belt, the angle of wrap is different than an open belt. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's open or crossed, but usually in these examples, it's an open belt drive unless stated otherwise. So I'll assume it's an open belt.

The angle of wrap θ for an open belt can be calculated using the formula θ = π + 2 arcsin((D - d)/(2C)), but wait, wait, in this case, both pulleys are the same diameter? Because the problem only mentions one pulley. Oh right, wait no. Wait, no, I think in this problem, it's a single pulley, but perhaps it's a double belt, meaning two belts are used. Or maybe it's a single belt with double thickness. Wait, the belt is double leather, so maybe it's two layers? Or perhaps double refers to something else. Hmm, but for the calculations, I think it's better to proceed as if it's a single belt. Maybe the 1/4 inch is the thickness per ply, so double would make it 1/2 inch thick. But wait, the thickness might affect the radius. Oh wait, because the belt's thickness adds to the pulley's radius when considering the arc of contact.

Wait, but the problem gives the pulley diameter as 50 inches. So the radius is 25 inches. But if the belt is 1/4 inch thick, then when wrapped around the pulley, the effective radius would be 25 + 1/4 = 25.25 inches? Or would the belt's thickness affect both the tight and slack side? Hmm, maybe I should consider that. But perhaps for this problem, the thickness is negligible compared to the pulley size, so we can ignore it. Alternatively, maybe it's part of the calculations for the angle of wrap.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the belt speed (v) because it's needed for the power calculation. Power P = (T1 - T2) * v. So if I can find T1 and T2, I can find the necessary belt width.

2. To find T1 and T2, I need to consider the friction between the belt and the pulley. The belt will have some tension, and the difference in tensions (T1 - T2) multiplied by the belt speed gives the power.

3. The belt's maximum allowable stress (300 psi) will relate to the belt width and the tensions. Because stress is force per area, and the force is the tension. Wait, stress (s) = T / (b * t), where b is the belt width and t is the thickness. So T = s * b * t.

4. The joint efficiency comes into play because the joints in the belt (like where the belt is spliced together) aren't 100% efficient, so the actual joint strength is less. So the allowable stress in the belt would be adjusted by the joint efficiency. So effective stress s_eff = s * η, where η is 0.7 in this case.

Wait, that seems important. So the maximum allowable stress considering the joint efficiency is 300 psi * 0.7 = 210 psi.

Wait no, wait, wait. No, joint efficiency affects the joint's strength. So the maximum allowable tension in the belt is limited by the joint strength. So if the safe stress for the belt material is 300 psi, but the joints can only handle 70% of that, then the effective allowable stress is 300 * 0.7 = 210 psi. So the maximum tension T that the belt can handle without failing at the joint is T = s_eff * b * t.

Got it.

So putting this together: T = 210 psi * b * (1/4 in) because the thickness is 1/4 inch.

Wait, but wait, the belt is double leather. Oh wait, perhaps that refers to the belt being made of two layers, so the thickness is 1/4 inch per layer, making it 1/2 inch total? Or does "double leather" mean something else, like double the strength? Hmm, the problem says it's a (1/4) in thick double leather belt. So maybe the thickness t is 1/4 inch. Hmm, but if it's double, maybe the thickness is 1/2 inch. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "A (1/4) in. thick double leather belt." So perhaps the total thickness is 1/4 inch, as a double layer. Or maybe each layer is 1/4 inch. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But for the sake of proceeding, I'll assume that the total thickness is 1/4 inch. So t = 0.25 inches.

So the maximum tension per belt is T = s_eff * b * t = 210 psi * b * 0.25 in.

But wait, if it's a double belt, perhaps that refers to two belts being used, so each belt would carry half the load. Hmm, but the problem says a double leather belt, which I think refers to the thickness, not the number of belts. So probably, the thickness is 0.25 in, and it's a single belt.

Ok, moving on.

Now, the power transmitted by a belt is given by P = (T1 - T2) * v.

I need to find (T1 - T2), and then find the belt width b that allows T1 to be within the allowable stress.

But to find T1 and T2, I need to consider the friction in the belt-pulley system. The relationship between T1 and T2 is given by the belt friction equation, which is T1 = T2 * e^(μθ), where μ is the coefficient of friction and θ is the angle of wrap in radians.

Wait, but θ is the angle that the belt wraps around the pulley. For an open belt drive with two pulleys of diameter D and d, the angle of wrap on the smaller pulley is θ = π + 2 arcsin((D - d)/(2C)), where C is the center distance. But in this problem, there's only one pulley mentioned, so perhaps it's a single pulley driving another, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's a single pulley and I'm supposed to assume it's a simple problem with a certain angle of wrap.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a crossed belt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should make a simplifying assumption that the angle of wrap is 180 degrees (π radians) because it's a single pulley. No, wait, a single pulley would have the belt going around half of it, so the angle of wrap would be π radians (180 degrees). Wait, no, if it's a single pulley, the belt would loop around it, making the angle of contact π radians, right? Because if the pulley is a circle, the belt would touch half the circumference, which is π radians.

Wait, but wait, no. If it's a crossed belt, the angle would be 2π, but that's for a crossed belt setup. For an open belt, the angle is less. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between open and crossed belts. Let me think again.

In an open belt drive with two pulleys, the larger pulley has a smaller angle of wrap, but for a single pulley, perhaps the problem is considering it as a simple case where the belt is wrapped 180 degrees, so θ = π radians. Alternatively, maybe the problem is set up differently. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Let's proceed with θ = π radians for now.

Wait, but perhaps in this problem, the angle of wrap is more than π? Because sometimes when you have a belt around a pulley, especially with some take-up, the angle can be a bit more, but without the other pulley's diameter, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the formula considering the pulley diameter and belt thickness.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the angle of wrap considering the belt thickness. Because the belt's thickness would affect the effective radius, right? So if the pulley has a radius R, and the belt has a thickness t, then the effective radius for the belt would be R + t. Wait, but when the belt is wrapped around the pulley, the center line of the belt is at R + t/2, perhaps. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the angle of wrap is calculated based on the outside radius.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can approximate θ as π radians for this problem. Let's proceed with that and see where it goes.

So, T1 = T2 * e^(μθ). With μ = 0.40 and θ = π radians, T1 = T2 * e^(0.4 * π). Let me calculate that exponent: 0.4 * π ≈ 1.2566. So e^1.2566 ≈ 3.513. So T1 ≈ 3.513 * T2.

Now, the power transmitted P = (T1 - T2) * v. We're given P = 100 hp. So, 100 hp = (3.513 T2 - T2) * v. That's (2.513 T2) * v.

Wait, 3.513 T2 minus T2 is 2.513 T2. So 100 hp = 2.513 T2 * v.

Now, I need to find v, the belt speed in feet per minute (fpm) or inches per minute (ipm), something consistent with the units.

The pulley's diameter is 50 inches, rotating at 1000 rpm. So the circumference is π * D = π * 50 inches. So each revolution, the belt moves 50π inches. At 1000 rpm, that's 50π * 1000 inches per minute. Let's calculate that.

50 * 1000 = 50,000. 50,000 * π ≈ 157,079.63 inches per minute. To convert to feet per minute, divide by 12: 157,079.63 / 12 ≈ 13,089.97 feet per minute.

Wait, but sometimes belt speeds are calculated in feet per minute. So v ≈ 13,090 fpm.

Hmm, but let me check: 50 inches is 50/12 ≈ 4.1667 feet. So circumference is π * 4.1667 ft ≈ 13.089 ft. At 1000 rpm, the speed is 13.089 ft/rev * 1000 rev/min = 13,089 ft/min.

Ok, so v ≈ 13,089 fpm.

Now, substituting back into the power equation:

100 hp = 2.513 T2 * 13,089 fpm.

Wait, but wait: power in hp can be related to force in pounds and speed in feet per minute via the formula: 1 hp = 550 ft-lbf per minute. So the equation is in terms of pounds and feet.

So, 100 hp = (T1 - T2) * v, where T1 and T2 are in pounds, and v is in feet per minute.

So, 100 hp = 2.513 T2 * 13,089 fpm.

Wait, but wait: 100 hp equals (T1 - T2) * v in ft-lbf per minute. So, 100 hp = (2.513 T2) * 13,089.

Wait, but 100 hp is equal to 100 * 550 = 55,000 ft-lbf per minute.

So, 55,000 = 2.513 T2 * 13,089.

Let me compute the right side: 2.513 * 13,089 ≈ 2.513 * 13,000 ≈ 32,669. So 2.513 * 13,089 ≈ 32,900 (approx). So 55,000 = 32,900 * T2. So T2 = 55,000 / 32,900 ≈ 1.671.

Wait, that can't be right, because that would give T2 ≈ 1.671 pounds, which seems way too low. T1 would then be ≈3.513 * 1.671 ≈ 5.87 pounds.

But that can't be right because the belt would need to handle more tension than that. Maybe I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, v is 13,089 fpm, correct. So 13,089 ft/min.

So 100 hp = (T1 - T2) * 13,089 ft/min.

But 100 hp is 100 * 550 = 55,000 ft-lbf per minute.

So, 55,000 = (T1 - T2) * 13,089.

So, (T1 - T2) = 55,000 / 13,089 ≈ 4.196 pounds.

Wait, so (T1 - T2) ≈ 4.196 lbs.

But earlier, I had T1 ≈ 3.513 T2.

So, substituting T1 = 3.513 T2 into (T1 - T2) = 4.196:

3.513 T2 - T2 = 4.196

2.513 T2 = 4.196

T2 ≈ 4.196 / 2.513 ≈ 1.670 pounds.

Then T1 ≈ 3.513 * 1.670 ≈ 5.867 pounds.

Wait, that seems really low. Tensions in belts are usually much higher, especially for 100 hp. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the angle of wrap. Earlier I assumed θ = π radians, but maybe that's not correct. Let me think again.

The angle of wrap θ for a crossed belt is 2π radians, but for an open belt drive with two pulleys, the angle depends on the diameter difference and the center distance. But in this problem, since there's only one pulley mentioned, perhaps it's a single-pulley system, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, perhaps it's a double-pulley system, but the problem only gives one diameter. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "a (1/4) in. thick double leather belt is used on a cast steel pulley 50 in. in diameter...". So perhaps it's a single pulley, but the belt is looped around it in a way that the angle of wrap is more than 180 degrees? Or maybe it's a crossed belt, so the angle is 2π radians.

Wait, if it's a crossed belt, then θ = 2π radians. Let me try that.

So, μ = 0.40, θ = 2π ≈ 6.2832 radians.

So T1 = T2 * e^(0.4 * 6.2832) = T2 * e^(2.5133). Let me compute e^2.5133 ≈ 12.18.

So T1 ≈ 12.18 T2.

Then, the power equation: P = (T1 - T2) * v = (12.18 T2 - T2) * v = 11.18 T2 * v.

We have P = 100 hp = 55,000 ft-lbf/min.

So 55,000 = 11.18 T2 * 13,089.

Wait, that gives T2 = 55,000 / (11.18 * 13,089).

Calculating denominator: 11.18 * 13,089 ≈ 146,300.

So T2 ≈ 55,000 / 146,300 ≈ 0.376 pounds.

Wait, that's even lower. So T1 = 12.18 * 0.376 ≈ 4.583 pounds.

That still seems way too low for 100 hp. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption about the angle of wrap. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the correct angle of wrap for a single pulley. Wait, no, in reality, a belt must loop around a pulley and connect to another point, so perhaps it's an open belt with a certain angle. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the belt to be wrapped 180 degrees, so θ = π radians.

Wait, let me go back to the open belt scenario where θ is less than 180 degrees. Hmm, but without knowing the other pulley's diameter, I can't calculate the exact angle. Maybe the problem is assuming the angle of wrap is 180 degrees, so θ = π radians, which is what I initially thought.

Wait, but then the tensions were way too low. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the belt speed. Let me double-check that.

Pulley diameter D = 50 inches. So radius R = 25 inches.

Belt speed v = π D N, where N is rpm.

Wait, that would be in inches per minute. So v = π * 50 * 1000 = 157,079.63 inches per minute.

Convert to feet per minute: 157,079.63 / 12 ≈ 13,089.97 fpm.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so if the angle of wrap is π radians, T1 = 3.513 T2, and then (T1 - T2) = 2.513 T2.

Then, 55,000 = 2.513 T2 * 13,089.

Wait, 2.513 * 13,089 ≈ 32,900.

So T2 = 55,000 / 32,900 ≈ 1.671 lb.

That seems too low. So T1 would be about 5.867 lb. But 5 lb of tension
