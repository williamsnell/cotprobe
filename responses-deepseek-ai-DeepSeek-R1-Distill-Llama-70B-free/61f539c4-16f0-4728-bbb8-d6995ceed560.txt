Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about calculating the final inventory for Firestone's Clothing Store on August 31. Let me read the problem again carefully.

They started with an inventory of $2,300 on August 1. During August, they bought new merchandise worth $1,125, and they made sales of $3,485. The margin on sales was 18%. I need to find the estimated final inventory.

Hmm, wait, what's the margin here? I remember that margin can refer to profit margin, which is usually calculated as (Sales - Cost of Goods Sold) / Sales. So if the margin is 18%, that means the profit is 18% of the sales. Or is it the gross profit margin?

Right, the gross profit margin is (Sales - COGS) / Sales. So if the margin is 18%, then the cost of goods sold (COGS) would be 82% of sales because 100% - 18% = 82%.

Wait, let me think again. If the margin is 18%, then COGS is (100% - 18%) = 82% of sales. So COGS = 0.82 * Sales.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: Gross profit is Sales minus COGS. So if the margin is 18%, then Gross Profit = 0.18 * Sales. Therefore, COGS = Sales - Gross Profit = Sales - 0.18 Sales = 0.82 Sales.

So, COGS is 82% of the sales. So in this case, Sales are $3,485. So COGS would be 0.82 * 3485. Let me calculate that.

0.82 * 3485 = Let me compute it step by step. 3485 * 0.8 is 2788, and 3485 *0.02 is 69.7. So 2788 +69.7 = 2857.7. So COGS is $2,857.70.

Now, the initial inventory was $2,300. They purchased new merchandise of $1,125, so the total inventory available for sale would be the beginning inventory plus purchases, which is 2300 + 1125 = 3425.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula for COGS is usually beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. Oh wait, COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think the correct formula is: COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory.

So rearranging that, Ending Inventory = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - COGS.

So I have all the numbers: Beginning Inventory is $2,300, Purchases are $1,125, and COGS is $2,857.70.

So plugging in: Ending Inventory = 2300 + 1125 - 2857.70.

Let me calculate that: 2300 + 1125 is 3425. Then 3425 - 2857.70 = 567.30.

So the ending inventory would be $567.30.

Looking at the options, option B is $567.30. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I want to make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let me go through it again.

Alternative approach: The profit margin is 18%, so that would mean that for every dollar sold, 18 cents is profit, and 82 cents is COGS. So from the sales of $3,485, COGS would be 0.82 * 3485, which as before is $2,857.70.

Then, the total goods available for sale are beginning inventory plus purchases: 2300 + 1125 = 3425.

So the cost of goods sold (COGS) is the amount that was sold during the period. So the ending inventory would be the total goods available minus COGS.

So 3425 - 2857.70 = 567.30. Yep, that's correct. So ending inventory is $567.30, which is option B.

To estimate the final inventory on August 31 for Firestone's Clothing Store, we start with the following data:

- **Beginning Inventory (August 1):** $2,300  
- **Purchases during August:** $1,125  
- **Sales during August:** $3,485  
- **Margin on sales:** 18%  

The margin on sales refers to the gross profit margin, which is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Sales} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}
\]  
Given the margin is 18%, the gross profit is 18% of sales, and COGS is therefore 82% of sales:  
\[
\text{COGS} = 0.82 \times \text{Sales}
\]  
Substituting the sales value:  
\[
\text{COGS} = 0.82 \times 3,485 = 2,857.70
\]  

The total inventory available for sale during August is:  
\[
\text{Total Inventory Available} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} = 2,300 + 1,125 = 3,425
\]  

The ending inventory can be calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{Ending Inventory} = \text{Total Inventory Available} - \text{COGS}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Ending Inventory} = 3,425 - 2,857.70 = 567.30
\]  

Thus, the estimated final inventory on August 31 is **$567.30**, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
