Question:

A 32-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being struck by a car while driving his motorcycle. He reports severe pelvic pain. On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?

Options:

A: Spongy
B: Posterior
C: Intramural (pre-prostatic)
D: Prostatic
E: Proximal
F: Penile
G: Bulbous
H: Anterior
I: Membranous
J: Distal

Okay, so I have this question about a man injured in a motorcycle accident. The scenario is he's 32 years old, brought to the ER 30 minutes after being hit. He has severe pelvic pain. The exam shows bruising of the perineum and pain when moving his pelvis. There's blood at the urethral meatus, but no other penile trauma. X-ray shows a superior pubic ramus fracture, and they're doing a retrograde urethrography to check for urethral disruption.

The question is asking which part of the urethra is at the greatest risk of injury here. The options are various parts: Spongy, Posterior, Intramural, Prostatic, Proximal, Penile, Bulbous, Anterior, Membranous, Distal.

Hmm. I remember that the urethra is divided into different parts. From what I've studied, the male urethra is divided into four parts: prostatic, membranous, bulbous, and penile (or spongy). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The male urethra is typically divided into the prostatic, membranous, and spongy (or penile) parts. Alternatively, sometimes it's grouped as anterior and posterior, where the posterior includes prostatic and membranous, and the anterior includes bulbous and penile.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize. The prostatic urethra is the part that runs through the prostate gland. Then, the membranous urethra is the short segment that passes through the urogenital diaphragm, which is the external urethral sphincter. Then comes the bulbous urethra, which is in the bulb of the penis, and then the penile or spongy urethra, which runs along the shaft of the penis.

In cases of pelvic fractures, especially from trauma like being hit by a car, the most common injury to the urethra is to the membranous part. Because the membranous urethra is fixed by the urogenital diaphragm, it doesn't have as much mobility. So when there's a fracture of the pelvis, like the pubic rami, it can cause shearing forces that disrupt this fixed portion.

Wait, but the patient also has blood at the urethral meatus, which is the external opening. That suggests that the injury is more distal, but I'm not sure. No, wait, blood at the meatus could come from any part of the urethra, but in the case of trauma, the presence of blood and the mechanism of injury would point towards a specific area.

I also remember that in pelvic fractures, especially those involving the pubic rami, the injury often occurs at the junction where the urethra is more fixed. Since the prostatic urethra is within the prostate and more protected, it's less likely to be injured. The membranous part is more susceptible because it's surrounded by the pelvic floor muscles and can be torn when the pelvis fractures.

The bulbous and penile parts are more mobile, so they're less likely to be injured in this scenario. The intramural part, I think that's another term for the pre-prostatic, which is part of the prostatic urethra, so maybe not the most likely here.

The posterior urethra includes the prostatic and membranous parts. So if the posterior urethra is injured, which part is that? Oh, wait, the posterior urethra is the part that's within the pelvis, so that's the prostatic and membranous sections.

Wait, but in most cases, the injury is specifically to the membranous urethra. Because the prostatic urethra is more elastic and less likely to tear. So in a pelvic fracture, the shearing forces cause disruption of the membranous part.

So in this patient, the fracture of the superior pubic ramus, which is part of the pelvis, would put stress on the fixed portion of the urethra. The retrograde urethrography would show disruption in the membranous urethra.

Looking at the options, option I is Membranous. So the answer should be I.

In this scenario, the patient sustained a pelvic fracture with a fracture of the superior pubic ramus, perineal bruising, and blood at the urethral meatus. These findings, combined with the mechanism of injury, suggest a high likelihood of urethral disruption. The urethra is divided into several regions: prostatic, membranous, bulbous, and penile (or spongy). The membranous urethra, which is the shortest and least mobile portion, is particularly vulnerable in pelvic fractures due to its fixation by the urogenital diaphragm. Shearing forces from the pelvic fracture can cause disruption at this fixed segment.

Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the membranous urethra is at the greatest risk of injury. This is consistent with the typical pattern of urethral trauma in pelvic fractures.
