Question:

Berscheid’s (1983) emotion-in-relationship model proposes that strong positive emotions are LESS likely to be elicited during the later stages of an intimate relationship than in its initial stages because:

Options:

A: over time, partners become more emotionally distant due to familiarity.
B: "over time, people become ""emotionally immune"" to the behaviors of others."
C: in the later stages, each partner's behavior becomes more erratic and unpredictable.
D: in the later stages, each partner works harder to be sensitive to the other’s needs.
E: in the later stages, each person is more self-centered and less other-centered.
F: in the later stages, each partner's behavior has become more predictable.
G: over time, partners become more independent and less reliant on each other for emotional support.
H: in the later stages, each partner is more focused on their own emotional needs.
I: in the later stages, each partner has less emotional investment in the relationship.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Berscheid’s emotion-in-relationship model. Hmm, I remember that Berscheid did some work on emotions in relationships, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question states that Berscheid's model suggests strong positive emotions are less likely in the later stages of an intimate relationship compared to the initial stages. Why would that be the case? 

I think in the early stages of a relationship, everything is new and exciting. People often experience strong emotions like passion and excitement because everything is novel. As time goes on, things might become more routine. So maybe the strong positive emotions wear off because the relationship becomes more predictable.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that aligns with this idea. Let me go through each choice.

Option A says partners become more emotionally distant due to familiarity. That might make sense because as you get to know someone better, the initial excitement fades. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what Berscheid said.

Option B mentions "emotionally immune" to others' behaviors. I'm not familiar with that term in this context, so I'm unsure.

Option C suggests behavior becomes erratic. That doesn't sound right. Usually, relationships become more predictable over time, not more unpredictable.

Option D says partners work harder to be sensitive. That seems positive, so it might not explain a decrease in strong positive emotions.

Option E claims people become more self-centered. I don't recall that being the main point here. It's more about the emotional intensity fading, not about selfishness.

Option F states behavior becomes more predictable. Yes, that rings a bell. Predictability can lead to routine, which might reduce the intense emotions present early on.

Option G talks about becoming more independent. While that could happen, I'm not sure if that's directly tied to the decrease in positive emotions as per Berscheid.

Option H focuses on own emotional needs. Again, not sure if that's the reason for reduced positive emotions.

Option I says less emotional investment. That could be a possibility, but I think the model is more about the emotions themselves rather than investment.

So, circling back, I think the main idea is that as the relationship progresses, the behaviors and interactions become more predictable, leading to less intense positive emotions. So the answer should be F.

Berscheid’s emotion-in-relationship model suggests that strong positive emotions diminish in the later stages of an intimate relationship due to increased predictability. As the relationship progresses, the novelty and excitement of the early stages fade, replaced by routine and familiarity. This predictability reduces the intensity of positive emotions. Among the options, the one that aligns with this reasoning is:

F: in the later stages, each partner's behavior has become more predictable.

Answer: F
