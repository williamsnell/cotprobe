Question:

In an automobile accident case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by driving at an excessive speed. The defendant's attorney calls its first witness, who was standing along the side of the road when the plaintiff's and defendant's cars collided. The defendant's attorney asks the witness: "Is it a fact that in your estimation, plaintiff was traveling at a speed of 45 m. p. h. in a 35 m. p. h. speed zone at the time of the accident?" The plaintiff objects. The trial judge should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because the judge may take judicial notice of the speed limit within the jurisdiction.
B: overrule the objection if the witness has already been shown to be an experienced driver who was able to estimate the approximate speed of moving vehicles.
C: sustain the objection if the witness has not been qualified as an expert witness.
D: sustain the objection, because the witness is not an adverse witness.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with witnesses and objections during a trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is an automobile accident case where the defendant is claiming the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by speeding. The defendant's attorney is questioning their first witness, who was standing by the road when the collision happened. The question is asking the witness if, in their estimation, the plaintiff was going 45 mph in a 35 mph zone.

The plaintiff objects, and the question is what the trial judge should doâ€”whether to overrule or sustain the objection.

The options are A through D. Let me look at each one.

Option A says the judge should overrule because the judge can take judicial notice of the speed limit. Hmm, judicial notice is when the court accepts a fact without evidence because it's common knowledge. Speed limits are usually set by statute, so maybe the judge can take notice of that. But the question is about the witness's estimate of the plaintiff's speed. The speed limit is a separate issue. So I'm not sure A is the right reason here.

Option B states the objection should be overruled if the witness has been shown to be an experienced driver able to estimate speed. This makes sense because lay witnesses can testify about speed estimates if they have a basis for their opinion. For example, if the witness is familiar with judging speed, like an experienced driver, their estimation is admissible. So if the attorney laid the foundation that the witness is experienced, then the question is proper.

Option C says the objection should be sustained if the witness isn't an expert. Well, expert witnesses can give opinions based on their expertise, but lay witnesses can also give opinions on matters like speed if they're in a position to know. So if the witness hasn't been qualified as an expert, but is just a layperson with relevant experience, their opinion might still be allowed. So C might not be correct because the witness doesn't need to be an expert if they can provide a competent lay opinion.

Option D argues that the objection should be sustained because the witness isn't adverse. I'm not sure how that applies here. The classification of a witness as adverse usually affects whether the attorney can treat them as hostile and ask leading questions. But here, the issue is about the form of the question and the qualification of the witness to testify about speed. So D might not be the right reason.

Putting it all together, the key issue is whether the witness is qualified to estimate the speed. If the witness has been shown to be experienced enough to make such an estimate, then the testimony is admissible. So the correct ruling would be to overrule the objection if that foundation is laid. That points me towards option B as the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether a lay witness's estimation of a vehicle's speed is admissible. The defendant's attorney asks the witness for their opinion on the plaintiff's speed, and the plaintiff objects. The admissibility hinges on whether the witness is qualified to provide such an estimate.

- **Option A** suggests the judge should overrule the objection based on judicial notice of the speed limit. However, judicial notice pertains to the speed limit itself, not the witness's estimation of speed. Thus, this option is irrelevant to the admissibility of the witness's opinion.

- **Option B** states the objection should be overruled if the witness is shown to be an experienced driver capable of estimating speed. This aligns with the rule that lay witnesses can provide opinions on speed if they have a basis for their estimation, such as relevant experience.

- **Option C** argues the objection should be sustained if the witness is not an expert. However, lay witnesses do not need to be experts to testify about speed; they only need to have a sufficient basis for their opinion.

- **Option D** claims the objection should be sustained because the witness is not adverse. This is irrelevant, as the issue is about the qualification to testify to speed, not the witness's classification.

The correct answer is **B**, as the witness's experience as a driver provides a proper foundation for their speed estimation, making their testimony admissible.

Answer: B
