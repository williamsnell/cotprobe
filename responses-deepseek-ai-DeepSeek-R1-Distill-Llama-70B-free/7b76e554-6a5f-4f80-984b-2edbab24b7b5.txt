Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about neural networks. Let's look at the two statements given.

Statement 1 says that RELUs are not monotonic, but sigmoids are monotonic. I remember that activation functions play a big role in neural networks. RELU is the Rectified Linear Unit, which is f(x) = max(0, x). So, if x increases, f(x) increases as well. Wait, but for x less than zero, it's flat. So does that make it non-monotonic? Or maybe it's still considered monotonic because once x is positive, it's linear. Hmm, wait, monotonic means the function is entirely non-decreasing or non-increasing. For RELU, when x increases beyond zero, f(x) increases. So it's non-decreasing overall. So maybe RELU is monotonic. But wait, the slope isn't the same everywhere. Oh but being monotonic doesn't require a constant slope, just that it doesn't decrease when x increases. So if I plot RELU, it's increasing for x>0 and flat for x<0. So overall, it's non-decreasing, which would make it monotonic. Wait, but I thought some sources say that RELU is non-monotonic. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the definition. Monotonic functions are those that either entirely non-decreasing or non-increasing. So for RELU, as x increases, the output doesn't decrease. So it's monotonic. So statement 1 says RELUs are not monotonic, which would be false then.

Wait, but I thought the sigmoid function is monotonic. Sigmoid is an S-shaped curve that increases smoothly from 0 to 1. It's definitely always increasing, so it's monotonic. So Statement 1 claims that RELU is not monotonic, but sigmoid is. But if my earlier reasoning is correct, then Statement 1 is incorrect because RELU is monotonic. So Statement 1 would be false.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum. I remember that gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that can get stuck in local minima. Especially in non-convex problems, which neural networks definitely are. So it's not guaranteed to find the global optimum. There's a lot of discussion about whether neural networks can converge to a global minimum, but I think in practice, they often find a good local minimum that works well, but not necessarily the global. So Statement 2 is probably false. Some sources say that under certain conditions, like with very large networks or specific initializations, gradient descent might converge to a global optimum, but in general, it's not guaranteed. So Statement 2 is likely false.

So Statement 1 is false because RELU is monotonic, and Statement 2 is false because gradient descent doesn't guarantee global optimum with high probability.

Looking back at the options:

A: True, False → Statement 1 true? No, because I think Statement 1 is false.

B: True, True → No, both can't be true.

C: Both partially true → Not sure, but I think Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false, so this might not fit.

D: Statement 1 cannot be determined, Statement 2 is false → Well, I think Statement 1 can be determined as false, so this might not apply.

E: Both cannot be determined → No, I think I can evaluate both.

F: False, False → Yes, this seems correct. Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but let me double-check Statement 1. Maybe I was wrong about RELU being monotonic. Let me think again. Monotonic means that as x increases, f(x) does not decrease. For x < 0, f(x) is 0; for x >0, it's x. So as x increases from -infty to +infty, f(x) goes from 0 to x, which is increasing. So yes, RELU is monotonic. So Statement 1 says they are not monotonic, which is wrong. So Statement 1 is false.

So the correct option is F: False, False.

Statement 1 claims that RELUs are not monotonic, but sigmoids are monotonic. RELU (Rectified Linear Unit) is defined as \( f(x) = \max(0, x) \). It is monotonic because it is non-decreasing: as \( x \) increases, \( f(x) \) does not decrease. Sigmoids, on the other hand, are also monotonic as they are S-shaped curves that always increase smoothly from 0 to 1. Therefore, Statement 1 is false because RELUs are monotonic.

Statement 2 asserts that neural networks trained with gradient descent converge to the global optimum with high probability. However, gradient descent is not guaranteed to find the global optimum, especially in non-convex optimization problems like training neural networks. It often converges to a local minimum, though in practice, these local minima can still yield good performance. Thus, Statement 2 is also false.

Given the analysis, both statements are false.

The correct answer is:

F: False, False

Answer: F
