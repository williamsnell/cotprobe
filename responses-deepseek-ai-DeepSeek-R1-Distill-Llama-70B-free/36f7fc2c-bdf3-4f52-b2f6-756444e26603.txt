Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding a probability involving a random sample from the standard normal distribution. Let me try to think this through step by step. 

The problem states that we have seven random variables, Z1 through Z7, each following a standard normal distribution N(0,1). Then we're defining W as the sum of their squares: W = Z1² + Z2² + ... + Z7². We need to find the probability that W lies between 1.69 and 14.07, so P(1.69 < W < 14.07).

Hmm, okay. I remember that when you square normal variables and add them up, it relates to the chi-squared distribution. Oh right, the sum of squares of independent standard normal variables follows a chi-squared distribution. And the number of variables here is seven, so the degrees of freedom would be 7. So W ~ χ²(7).

Right, so I need to find the probability that W is between 1.69 and 14.07 for a chi-squared distribution with 7 degrees of freedom. That means I need to calculate P(1.69 < χ²(7) < 14.07).

I think the way to approach this is to use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the chi-squared distribution. So the probability would be CDF(14.07) minus CDF(1.69). That makes sense because it's the area under the curve from 1.69 to 14.07.

But wait, I don't have the exact values of the CDF for these numbers. I remember that in statistics, especially in chi-squared tests, we often use tables or critical values. So maybe I should look up the critical values for the chi-squared distribution with 7 degrees of freedom.

I think the critical values correspond to certain probabilities. For example, the lower tail probabilities like 0.025, 0.05, 0.95, 0.975, etc. So I should check what 1.69 and 14.07 correspond to in terms of these probabilities.

Wait, I remember that for a chi-squared distribution with n degrees of freedom, the lower tail probability at a certain value gives the area to the left of that value. So let's think. If I can find the probabilities corresponding to 1.69 and 14.07, I can subtract them to get the probability between.

Wait, alternatively, maybe these numbers are the critical values themselves. Let me think. For 7 degrees of freedom, what are the critical values? Let me try to recall or figure out.

I remember that the chi-squared table typically gives values like the upper α/2 and lower α/2 points. For example, for a 90% confidence interval, you might use the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles.

Wait, let me think about the percentiles. So for a 7 degrees of freedom chi-squared distribution:

- The 5th percentile (lower 5%) might be around 2.17, but I'm not sure.
- The 95th percentile (upper 5%) is around 14.07, perhaps. Wait, that rings a bell. The upper 5% point for 7 df is 14.07, I think. And the lower 5% might be around 2.17.

But wait, in the problem, the lower bound is 1.69, which is less than 2.17. So that would correspond to a lower percentile than 5%. Maybe the 10th percentile? Or perhaps 2.5%?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the inverse. Let me check what 14.07 is: I think that for 7 df, 14.07 is the 0.95 quantile, meaning 95% of the distribution is to the left. So P(χ²(7) ≤14.07)=0.95. Similarly, 1.69 is the value where, say, 0.05 probability is to the left? Or maybe it's another value.

Wait, another approach: I can use the chi-square distribution table or a calculator. Since I can't access external resources, I'll have to rely on what I remember.

Wait, for 7 degrees of freedom, the critical values I remember are:

- At 0.95 (right tail): 14.07
- At 0.975: perhaps higher than that, maybe 16.01 or something.
- The lower end: for 0.05 (left tail) is maybe around 1.24, and 0.025 is 1.69 perhaps.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So the 0.025 quantile (left tail with area 2.5%) is 1.69, and the 0.95 quantile (right tail 5%) is 14.07.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The critical values are usually given for right tails. So for example, the value 14.07 is the point where 5% is to the right (i.e., 95% to the left). Similarly, the value 1.69 would be the point where 2.5% is to the left, meaning 97.5% is to the right.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again. Suppose I have a chi-squared table that gives the values for the upper tail probabilities. So for 7 df:

- The value 14.07 corresponds to 0.95 GOF (goodness of fit), which would mean that the probability of observing a value greater than 14.07 is 0.05. So P(χ²(7) >14.07)=0.05, which implies P(χ²(7) ≤14.07)=0.95.

Similarly, what about the lower end? If 1.69 is the value such that P(χ²(7) <1.69)=0.025, that would mean that 2.5% of the distribution is below 1.69. So P(χ²(7) ≤1.69)=0.025.

So now, we need P(1.69 < W <14.07) = P(W <14.07) - P(W <1.69) = 0.95 - 0.025 = 0.925.

Wait, that's 0.925, which is 92.5% probability. Looking at the options, option J is 0.925.

So the answer should be J: 0.925.

But wait, let me just make sure I didn't mix up the lower and upper values. Because sometimes the lower critical values are for the left tail, and the upper are for the right. So if 14.07 is the upper 5% point (right tail), and 1.69 is the lower 2.5% point (left tail), then the area between them is 1 - 0.025 - 0.05 = 0.925, which is 92.5%.

Yes, that makes sense. So the probability is 0.925, which is option J.

To solve the problem, we recognize that the sum of squares of independent standard normal variables follows a chi-squared distribution. Specifically, \( W = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + \cdots + Z_7^2 \) follows a chi-squared distribution with 7 degrees of freedom, denoted as \( \chi^2(7) \). The goal is to find \( P(1.69 < W < 14.07) \).

Using the properties of the chi-squared distribution, we interpret the bounds:

- The value 14.07 corresponds to the 95th percentile of the \( \chi^2(7) \) distribution, meaning \( P(W \leq 14.07) = 0.95 \).
- The value 1.69 corresponds to the 2.5th percentile of the \( \chi^2(7) \) distribution, meaning \( P(W \leq 1.69) = 0.025 \).

The probability that \( W \) lies between 1.69 and 14.07 is the difference between these cumulative probabilities:

\[
P(1.69 < W < 14.07) = P(W < 14.07) - P(W < 1.69) = 0.95 - 0.025 = 0.925.
\]

Thus, the probability is 0.925, which corresponds to option J.
