Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about who made a specific statement regarding the definition of law. The statement is: "Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice." The options are from A to J, each representing different legal philosophers or scholars.

First, I need to recall what each of these thinkers is known for. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Blackstone. I remember that Blackstone wrote Commentaries on the Laws of England. He had a more traditional view, emphasizing that law is based on reason and the will of God, but I'm not sure if the exact quote matches his words.

Option B: Bentham. He's associated with Utilitarianism and the idea that laws should aim for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. He also wrote about the principles of legislation, but I don't recall him defining law in that exact way.

Option C: Gray. There's a John Chipman Gray who wrote "The Nature and Sources of the Law." He focused on the historical and philosophical aspects, but I'm not certain about this exact quote.

Option D: Austin. Austin is known for his theory of law as the command of the sovereign. He defined law as commands backed by sanctions. The given statement doesn't quite fit because it mentions the state applying rules in justice, not just commands.

Option E: Kelsen. Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law posits that law is a system of norms, and he emphasized the basic norm. I don't think this statement matches his ideas exactly.

Option F: Dworkin. Dworkin is known for the concept of law as interpretation and the role of principles. His work is more about how law is interpreted rather than a definition like the one given.

Option G: Salmond. I'm vaguely remembering that Salmond wrote a jurisprudence textbook. He might have discussed the nature of law in terms of rules, but I'm not certain.

Option H: H.L.A. Hart. Hart's "The Concept of Law" talks about law as a system of primary and secondary rules. He emphasizes social rules and official acceptance, but the quote doesn't seem to match exactly.

Option I: Roscoe Pound. Pound was a sociological jurist, focusing on law and society. He talked about law as a means to social ends, but I don't recall this exact definition.

Option J: Holland. Thomas Erskine Holland wrote about the elements of jurisprudence. He defined law as "a body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice." Wait, that sounds very close to the given statement. Oh, but the question says "set of principles or body of rules." Hmm, but the structure is similar.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The quote in the question says "principles or body of rules." Let me think again. I think Holland's definition was something like law is a body of principles. Alternatively, maybe someone else.

Wait, another angle: the quote seems to align with the traditional or positivist view of law as a set of rules enforced by the state. Austin's command theory is about the sovereign's command, but the given quote is broader, mentioning principles and rules applied by the state.

Wait, I think John Austin's definition was more about commands from a sovereign, while the quote here is about state-recognized rules. So maybe it's not Austin.

I'm trying to remember specific definitions. I think the exact quote "Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice" is attributed to Thomas Erskine Holland. Yes, that rings a bell. So the answer would be J: Holland.

Alternatively, perhaps someone else. Wait, in the options, G is Salmond. I'm not sure about his exact definition. Salmond's jurisprudence text might have a similar statement, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: I remember that John Austin's definition was "Law is the command of the sovereign," so D is Austin. The given statement is different because it's about principles and rules applied by the state, not commands.

So the correct answer is J: Holland.

The statement "Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice" is attributed to Thomas Erskine Holland. Holland's definition aligns with this quote, as he emphasized law as a body of principles recognized and applied by the state. Other options, such as Austin, focus on commands from a sovereign, which does not match the quote. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: Holland

Answer: J
