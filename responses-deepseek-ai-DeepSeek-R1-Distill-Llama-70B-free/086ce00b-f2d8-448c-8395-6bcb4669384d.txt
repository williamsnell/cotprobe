Alright, so I've got this question about human rights diplomacy and standard-setting. Hmm, okay, I remember that standard-setting in this context has to do with creating some sort of guidelines or rules. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question is asking what the function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy is. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each one.

Option A says it's about setting certain standards in human rights treaties. That makes sense because treaties often have specific standards. But I'm not sure if that's the whole picture.

Option B mentions putting forward both binding and non-binding legal standards. Wait, binding would be like treaties that countries have to follow, and non-binding might be like resolutions or declarations. So standard-setting could involve both.

Option C is only non-binding. I don't think that's right because I remember that some standards are binding, like treaties.

Option D is enforcing treaties. No, that's more about implementation, not setting the standards themselves.

Option E talks about establishing universal principles. That sounds more like the broad goals, maybe like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. So that's part of standard-setting, but maybe not the entire function.

Option F is proposing binding standards only. But I think standard-setting includes both binding and non-binding, so F might be too narrow.

Option G is about non-binding proposals. Again, that leaves out the binding part, so probably not.

Option H is binding only, which again seems incomplete.

Option I says proposing certain standards in treaties. That's similar to A. Treaties are a part of it, but standard-setting might also include other documents like declarations.

Option J is creating guidelines for diplomacy. That sounds more like how diplomacy is conducted rather than setting the actual human rights standards.

Wait, so putting it all together. Standard-setting involves creating both binding and non-binding standards. For example, the UN might create treaties (binding) and resolutions (non-binding). So the function would include both. So looking back, option B says putting forward both binding and non-binding legal standards. That seems correct.

So the answer should be B.

The function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy involves creating both binding and non-binding legal standards. Binding standards are typically found in treaties that countries are obligated to follow, while non-binding standards may include resolutions or declarations. This dual approach ensures a comprehensive framework for human rights. 

Answer: B
