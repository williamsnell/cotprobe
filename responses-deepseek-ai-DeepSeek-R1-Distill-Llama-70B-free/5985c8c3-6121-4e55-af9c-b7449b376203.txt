Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It's a multiple-choice question, and I need to figure out which expression is another way to show 8 multiplied by 6. The options are labeled from A to E, and I have to pick the correct one.

Let me start by understanding the problem. I know that 8 times 6 is 48. So I need to look for an expression among the options that also equals 48. But wait, maybe there's another way to look at it. The question says "another way to show 8 x 6," so perhaps it's about rewriting the original expression in a different form, not just calculating it.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: (2x4)x6. Hmm, 2 times 4 is 8, and then 8 times 6 is 48. So this is like breaking down 8 into 2x4 and then multiplying by 6. That makes sense. So A is 8x6, which is exactly the original expression but written differently. So A is a possible correct answer.

Option B: (24+4)+6. Let's compute this. 24 plus 4 is 28, and 28 plus 6 is 34. That's not 48, so B doesn't work.

Option C: (2+4)x6. 2 plus 4 is 6, and 6 times 6 is 36. Not 48, so C is out.

Option D: (2x4)+6. 2x4 is 8, plus 6 is 14. Nope, that's not 48 either.

Option E: (16+16). 16 plus 16 is 32. Not 48, so E is wrong.

Wait, so only option A gives me 48 when calculated. So A must be the correct answer.

But wait, another way to think about it: 8x6 can be expressed in other ways, like using distributive properties. Maybe 8x6 can be written as (something else that equals 8) multiplied by 6. So for example, 8 can be 2x4, so (2x4)x6 is indeed 8x6. That's exactly what option A is. So yes, A is correct.

The correct answer is option A because it expresses 8 × 6 as (2 × 4) × 6, which is equivalent.

Answer: A
