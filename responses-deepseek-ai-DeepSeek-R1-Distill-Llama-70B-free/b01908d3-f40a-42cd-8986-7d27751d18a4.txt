Okay, so I've got this question here about ancient state societies and their material symbols. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. The question is asking for the most obvious material symbols, so I'm guessing it's about what's most visible or impressive.

Alright, the options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A is pottery fragments. Pottery is definitely something you find at ancient sites, but are they the most obvious symbols? I mean, pottery was used for daily life, like storing food and water. But symbols of a state... Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the top choice.

Option B: irrigation canals. Irrigation would be important for agriculture, especially in places like Mesopotamia or Egypt. But again, are canals symbols of the state? They're more functional. States would need them, but maybe not the most obvious symbol.

Option C: jewelry artifacts. Jewelry can indicate status, which is part of a state society. Rulers might wear elaborate jewelry to show their position. But is jewelry the most obvious symbol? It might be more about personal wealth rather than the state itself.

Option D: monumental works. That sounds promising. Monumental structures are big, public, and often built to last, like temples, palaces, or tombs for leaders. These could definitely symbolize the power and existence of the state. 

Option E: pyramids. Well, pyramids are a type of monumental work, specifically in Egypt. So E is a subset of D. But since D is an option, maybe D is broader and thus the better answer?

Option F: hieroglyphics. These are a form of writing, which is important for administration and record-keeping in a state. But the presence of writing itself is more about the system rather than a material symbol of the state's presence. Though, the existence of written records does support state-level organization.

Option G: agricultural tools. These are essential for sustaining the population, but again, they're more about daily life and economy rather than symbols of the state itself.

Option H: ancient weaponry. While states do have armies, the weapons themselves might not be the most obvious symbols. Unless it's something like massive defensive structures, but that's more under monumental works.

Option I: cave paintings. These are more associated with prehistoric, non-state societies. Early humans, not states, so probably not the right answer.

Option J: stone tablets. These could be used for laws or records, like the Code of Hammurabi. They do symbolize a state's legal system, but again, maybe not the most obvious or massive symbol compared to large structures.

Putting it all together, the most obvious material symbols are likely the big structures that states build. Pyramids are definitely one, but since D is "monumental works," which includes pyramids and other similar structures, D seems like the right choice. Monumental works are clear indicators of a state's presence because they require centralized planning, resources, and labor, which states can organize.

The most obvious material symbols of ancient state societies are monumental works, as they represent the centralized power, organization, and resources that define a state. These structures, such as temples, palaces, and tombs, are large-scale and designed to endure, serving as clear indicators of a state's presence and authority. While options like pyramids (E) and stone tablets (J) are significant, monumental works (D) encompass a broader category of such symbols.

Answer: D
