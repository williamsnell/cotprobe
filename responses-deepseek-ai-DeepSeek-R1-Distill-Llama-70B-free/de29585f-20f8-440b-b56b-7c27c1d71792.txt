Question:

An avid stamp collector had amassed a large and valuable collection. Many of his stamps were extremely rare and highly coveted. On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. "The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed "$75,000," instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?

Options:

A: The price term is $78,000, and it is unenforceable due to the secretary's mistake.
B: The price term is $75,000, and the cousin must pay an additional $3,000 due to the secretary's error.
C: The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.
D: The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.
E: The price term is $75,000, but the court may adjust the price to $78,000 if the cousin knew of the mistake.
F: The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.
G: The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.
H: The price term is $75,000, but the collector can demand the correct price of $78,000 due to the secretary's error.
I: The price term is $78,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because the collector signed the contract without noticing the mistaken price.
J: The price term is $78,000, but the court will reform the price to $75,000, because of the secretary's mistake.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically regarding mistakes in the terms of an agreement. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is about a stamp collector who wants to sell his collection. He sends a letter to his cousin offering to sell it for $75,000, but there's a mistake involved. The collector actually intended to say $78,000, but his secretary typed $75,000 by mistake. The collector signed the letter without noticing the error. Then the cousin accepted the offer as written.

So the question is about what the price term is and the legal effect of this mistake. I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I remember that contract law deals with issues like offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual assent. For a contract to be valid, there must be a meeting of the minds on all essential terms, including the price.

In this case, the collector made a mistake in the offer. He intended $78k but wrote $75k. The cousin, upon receiving the offer, accepted it as $75k. So, the issue is whether the contract is enforceable at $75k or if the mistake can be corrected to $78k.

I think about the different types of mistakes. One is a unilateral mistake, where only one party makes a mistake, and the other is a mutual mistake, where both parties have a wrong understanding. Here, only the collector (and his secretary) made the mistake. The cousin probably didn't know about it and just accepted the offer as presented.

Under the common law, if a mistake is made in an offer, and the offeree accepts it knowing that there's a mistake, maybe the contract can be avoided. But if the offeree doesn't know about the mistake, it's a bit different.

Wait, no—I think that if the mistake is in the offer, and the offeree accepts without knowing, the contract is formed as per the written terms. Because the offer was $75k, and the cousin accepted that. The collector is bound by the terms of his offer unless the mistake was so obvious that the cousin should have known.

But in this case, the cousin is also a stamp collector, so maybe he's aware of the collection's value. If $75k is a significant discount from what the collector intended, perhaps the cousin might have suspected an error. However, the question doesn't mention that the cousin knew about the mistake, so I think we can assume he didn't.

So, the offer was $75k, and the acceptance was for that amount. Therefore, the contract is formed with the price term at $75k. Now, can the collector try to get the contract rescinded or reformed because of the mistake?

I remember that for a contract to be rescinded due to mistake, the mistake must be material and relate to a fundamental assumption of the contract. Also, the party seeking rescission must not have been at fault in making the mistake.

Here, the collector's secretary made the mistake, and the collector didn't catch it. So, was it due to his own negligence? Maybe, because he signed the letter without checking. If that's the case, the collector might be barred from seeking rescission because his own negligence contributed to the mistake.

Alternatively, the doctrine of mistake allows for reformation of the contract under certain circumstances. Reformation is when the court changes the terms of the contract to reflect what the parties actually intended, as opposed to rescission, which cancels the contract.

But reformation requires that there was an agreement that was incorrectly reduced to writing—like a "mistake in integration." So, if the collector and cousin had an oral agreement about $78k, but the written offer mistakenly said $75k, then the collector could ask the court to reform the contract to the correct price.

Wait, in this case, was there any prior discussion about the price? The question says the collector had rejected offers to sell before. The letter was the offer. So, the offer was in writing, but the intended price was $78k, which was not communicated except through the letter. The cousin, upon receiving the offer, accepted it as written.

So, maybe the collector can't get reformation because he didn't communicate the intended price to the cousin except through the mistaken letter. Therefore, the cousin had no way of knowing that the collector intended $78k. So, the contract's price is $75k, and it's enforceable as is.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option G says the price is $75k and enforceable. Option F talks about court reforming to $78k, but I don't think that's possible because there's no evidence that the cousin knew of the mistake or that there was a prior agreement. Option E suggests the court may adjust if the cousin knew, but we don't have info on that.

So, the correct answer would be G: The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically addressing mistakes in the terms of an agreement. The stamp collector intended to offer his collection for $78,000 but, due to a secretary's error, the offer was mistakenly written as $75,000. The collector signed the letter without noticing the mistake, and the cousin accepted the offer as written. The legal issue is whether the contract is enforceable at $75,000 or if the mistake can be corrected to $78,000.

Under contract law, for a contract to be valid, there must be mutual assent on all essential terms, including the price. Here, the collector made a unilateral mistake in the offer, and the cousin accepted the offer as written ($75,000). Since the cousin had no knowledge of the collector's intended price of $78,000, the contract is formed based on the terms of the written offer.

The collector's negligence in not catching the mistake before signing the letter may prevent him from seeking rescission or reformation of the contract. Reformation requires evidence of a prior agreement that was incorrectly reduced to writing, which is not present here. Therefore, the contract is enforceable at the stated price of $75,000.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.**

Answer: G
