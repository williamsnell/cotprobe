Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to write the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts as a fraction in its simplest form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that ratios compare two quantities. So 2 cups to 3 quarts means I'm comparing cups to quarts. But wait, they're different units, so I should probably convert them to the same unit to make the ratio accurate.

I think about the conversions. I recall that 1 quart is equal to 4 cups. Oh right, yeah, because 1 quart is 4 cups. So if I have 3 quarts, converting that to cups would make it easier to compare with the 2 cups given.

So, let's convert 3 quarts to cups. Since 1 quart is 4 cups, 3 quarts would be 3 times 4, which is 12 cups. So 3 quarts = 12 cups.

Now the ratio becomes 2 cups to 12 cups. So that's 2:12. But wait, the question asks for this as a fraction in simplest form. So I can write this as 2 over 12, which is 2/12.

Now I need to simplify that fraction. Both 2 and 12 are divisible by 2. So dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives me 1/6. So the simplified fraction is 1/6.

Looking at the options provided, option H is 1 over 6, which matches what I got. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I convert quarts to cups correctly? Yes, 1 quart is 4 cups, so 3 quarts is 12. So 2 cups to 12 cups is indeed 2/12, which simplifies to 1/6. Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident the answer is H.

The ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts is converted by first noting that 1 quart equals 4 cups. Therefore, 3 quarts equals 12 cups. This makes the ratio 2:12, or as a fraction, 2/12. Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2 gives 1/6. Among the options, the correct one is H: 1 over 6.
