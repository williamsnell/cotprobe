Okay, so I've got this problem here about Harrison's Bookstore wanting to insure their inventory. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the inventory is estimated at $500,000, and they want to cover 70% of that. Right, so first I think I need to calculate 70% of $500,000. 

Wait, how do I calculate percentages again? Oh right, to find 70% of something, you multiply the number by 0.7. So 500,000 times 0.7... Let me do that. 500,000 times 0.7 is 350,000. So the insured value is $350,000. Got that down.

Now, the insurance company charges $0.50 per $100 of coverage. I'm a bit confused about how this works. So for every $100 that's insured, they charge 50 cents. So I need to figure out how much that would be for $350,000.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. If it's $0.50 per $100, then for each $100, the premium is $0.50. So for $350,000, how many $100 units are there? Well, $350,000 divided by $100 is 3500. Because 100 goes into 350,000 three thousand five hundred times.

So each of those 3500 units costs $0.50. So the total premium would be 3500 multiplied by 0.50. Let me calculate that. 3500 times 0.5 is... 3500 divided by 2 is 1750. So $1,750 per year.

Wait, let me double-check my math. 70% of 500k is 350k. Then 350k divided by 100 is 3500. Multiply by 0.5 gives 1750. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option C is $1,750. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the annual premium Harrison's Bookstore will pay for its insurance coverage, we start by calculating 70% of the inventory's value. The inventory is valued at $500,000, so:

\[
\text{Insured Value} = 500,000 \times 0.7 = 350,000
\]

Next, the insurance company charges $0.50 per $100 of coverage. To find the total premium, we calculate how many $100 units are in $350,000:

\[
\text{Number of $100 Units} = \frac{350,000}{100} = 3,500
\]

The premium for each $100 unit is $0.50, so the total premium is:

\[
\text{Total Premium} = 3,500 \times 0.5 = 1,750
\]

Thus, the annual premium Harrison's Bookstore will pay is $1,750. The correct answer is:

C: $1,750
