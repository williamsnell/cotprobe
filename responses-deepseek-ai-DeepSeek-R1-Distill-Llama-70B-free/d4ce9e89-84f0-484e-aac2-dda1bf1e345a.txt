Okay, so I have this economics problem here about production and costs. Hmm, I need to figure out the least cost production and the marginal physical product of capital. Let me see what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the question says that producing one unit of good Y requires 3 workers and 7 units of capital. The wage rate is $4 per worker, and the rent on a unit of capital is $1. I need to find the marginal physical product of capital (MPPK) that minimizes the cost and the total cost when the MPP of labor is $2.

Wait, I think this is about cost minimization in production. Firms want to minimize their costs given the output they produce. So they choose the combination of labor and capital that gives them the lowest cost for producing a certain level of output.

I remember that for cost minimization, the firm should equal the marginal product per dollar for each input. Oh right, the condition is that the ratio of marginal products should equal the ratio of their prices. So, MPP_L / Wage = MPP_K / Rent.

Wait, let me get that right. The marginal product of labor divided by the wage rate should equal the marginal product of capital divided by the rental rate of capital. So MPP_L / (W) = MPP_K / (R).

In this problem, the MPP_L is given as $2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question says that the marginal physical product of labor is $2. Or is that the value? Hmm, no, wait. Let me read again. It says, "what is this cost if the marginal physical product of labor is $2?" So MPP_L is 2.

Wait, but wait, the MPP is units of output per additional unit of input. So if the wage is $4, then the marginal product of labor per dollar is MPP_L / wage. Similarly for capital.

So, the condition is MPP_L / W = MPP_K / R.

Given that, let's plug in the numbers. MPP_L is 2, W is 4. So 2/4 = 0.5. So MPP_K / R must also be 0.5.

Since the rent R is $1 per unit of capital, MPP_K / 1 = MPP_K = 0.5. So MPP_K should be 0.5.

Wait, but wait, the MPPK is 0.5. So looking at the options, which one has MPPK as 0.5?

Looking at the options:

Option B: MPPK=0.5, total cost $19.

But wait, I need to also find the total cost. Hmm, what's the total cost here?

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Is the production of a unit of Y requiring 3 workers and 7 units of capital, but that might be for producing one unit. So if the firm is producing one unit, the cost would be (3 workers * $4) + (7 capital * $1) = (12) + (7) = $19. So total cost is $19.

Wait, but wait, maybe the problem is about producing a certain level of output, and using the least cost combination. Alternatively, perhaps the firm is producing a certain number of units, but the question gives per unit. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the firm's production function is such that each unit of Y requires 3 workers and 7 units of capital. So, for each unit of Y, cost is 3*4 + 7*1 = 12 +7=19. But then why are we talking about marginal products? Hmm maybe that's not the right way.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is about using the least cost combination, which means that the firm should choose the optimal ratio of labor to capital. But the given 3 workers and 7 capital per unit might not necessarily be the optimal. Or wait, maybe so. Wait, let me re-read the question.

Ah, the production of a unit of good Y requires 3 workers and 7 units of capital. So for each unit of Y, it's 3L and 7K. So if the firm produces, say, Q units, then it needs 3Q workers and 7Q capital. But the problem is asking about the least cost, so perhaps that's the current method, but whether it's optimal.

But wait, the question is phrased as: "what should be the MPPK in order for production to be carried out at least cost". So the current setup (3 workers and 7 capital per unit) may or may not be optimal. So perhaps the firm is not currently minimizing cost and needs to adjust.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the MPPK required for least cost production, given that MPP_L is 2. So the condition is MPP_L / W = MPP_K / R.

So, MPP_L is 2, W is 4. So 2/4=0.5. So MPP_K must be 0.5. So the MPPK is 0.5.

Now, the total cost for producing that unit would be the cost of 3 workers and 7 capital. So 3*4=12 and 7*1=7. So 12+7=19. So the total cost is $19, and MPPK is 0.5.

Looking at the options, that's option B: MPPK=0.5, total cost $19.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is about producing more than one unit? Or perhaps the MPPK is per unit of capital. Hmm, no, I think the initial approach is correct.

To determine the least cost production and the marginal physical product of capital (MPPK), we use the cost minimization condition: the ratio of marginal products of inputs should equal the ratio of their prices. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[
\frac{\text{MPP}_L}{W} = \frac{\text{MPP}_K}{R}
\]

Given:
- \(\text{MPP}_L = 2\)
- Wage (\(W\)) = \$4
- Rent on capital (\(R\)) = \$1

Substituting the values into the condition:

\[
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{\text{MPP}_K}{1}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
0.5 = \text{MPP}_K
\]

Thus, the marginal physical product of capital (\(\text{MPPK}\)) required for least cost production is **0.5**.

Next, to calculate the total cost of producing one unit of good Y, we use the given input requirements:
- Labor: 3 workers at \$4 per worker = \(3 \times 4 = \$12\)
- Capital: 7 units at \$1 per unit = \(7 \times 1 = \$7\)

Total cost = Cost of labor + Cost of capital = \(12 + 7 = \$19\).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: MPPK = 0.5, total cost = \$19**
