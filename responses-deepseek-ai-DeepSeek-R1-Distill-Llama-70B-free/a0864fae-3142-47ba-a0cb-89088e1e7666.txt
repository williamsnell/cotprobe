Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an alarm being dropped from a window, and I need to figure out what the measured frequency would be. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the alarm has a frequency of 400 Hz when it's stationary, I guess. When it's dropped, it's in free fall, meaning it's accelerating downward due to gravity. Now, the student is measuring the frequency using an oscilloscope. Wait, how does dropping the alarm affect the frequency that the student measures?

I remember something about the Doppler effect. Oh right, the Doppler effect is when the observed frequency changes because the source of the sound is moving relative to the observer. So if the source is moving towards you, the frequency increases, and if it's moving away, the frequency decreases. But wait, is that when the source is moving towards the observer or when the observer is moving towards the source?

Wait, no. The Doppler effect formula depends on the relative motion. Let me think. The general formula is f' = f (v + vo)/(v + vs), where v is the speed of sound in air, vo is the velocity of the observer towards the source, and vs is the velocity of the source towards the observer. But in this case, the observer is stationary, right? The student is on the ground, I assume, and the alarm is moving.

So the source is moving towards the ground. Wait, no, the source is moving away from the student. Because when you drop something, it's moving away from the student if the student is on a higher floor. Wait, no. Wait, the alarm is being dropped from above, so as it falls, it's moving towards the ground, which is where the student is? Or is the student inside the building? Hmm, the question says the student drops it out of a window, so the student is on the third floor. So as the alarm falls, it's moving away from the student, right? Because the student is at the window, and the alarm is going down.

Wait, no. Wait, if you're on the third floor and drop the alarm, you're on the same level as the source when it starts. As the alarm falls, it's moving away from you. So from the student's perspective, the source is moving away. So according to the Doppler effect, if the source is moving away, the observed frequency should be lower than the actual frequency.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another thought: when an object is in free fall, its speed increases as it falls. So initially, when it's just dropped, it's not moving very fast. As time passes, it accelerates, so its speed increases. So the velocity of the source (alarm) is increasing as it falls.

So the source is moving away from the observer (the student) with increasing speed. So the Doppler effect here depends on the source's speed relative to the medium (air). Since it's moving away, the observed frequency should decrease because the waves are getting stretched out.

Wait, but let me get the exact formula right. The Doppler effect when the source is moving away is f' = f * v / (v + vs), where vs is the speed of the source away from the observer. Because when the source is moving away, vs is positive, so the denominator is larger, making f' smaller than f.

So the measured frequency would be lower than 400 Hz. But wait, wait another thing: the student is holding the oscilloscope, and the alarm is moving away. So as the alarm falls, its speed increases. So the source's speed vs is increasing over time.

So the Doppler shift isn't constant. At first, when vs is small, f' is just a bit lower than 400 Hz, but as the source moves faster, vs increases, so f' becomes even lower. So the observed frequency would be decreasing as it falls.

Wait, but wait again. No, wait, if the source is moving away faster, the frequency decreases more. So as it falls, the speed increases, so the frequency observed would get lower and lower, meaning the frequency is decreasing over time.

But wait, I thought the Doppler effect when moving away would cause the observed frequency to be lower. So initially, it's at 400 Hz, but as the alarm starts moving down, the frequency drops. But wait, no, the alarm is the source, so when it's stationary, f' is 400 Hz. When it starts moving away, f' becomes lower. As it speeds up, f' becomes even lower.

So the measured frequency appears lower than 400 Hz, and as it falls, the frequency decreases further.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option E: appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency increases as it falls.

Option G: appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls.

Wait, no, so the measured frequency is lower, and as the source moves faster away (because it's accelerating), the observed frequency becomes even lower, so it's decreasing.

So the correct option would be G: appears lower and frequency decreases.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Wait, when the source is moving, the observed frequency depends on the source's velocity. If the source is moving away, then yes, f' = f * v/(v + vs). So as vs increases, f' decreases. So as the alarm is accelerating downward, vs increases, so f' decreases further. So the measured frequency is lower and gets lower as it falls.

So the correct option would be G: appears lower and frequency decreases.

But wait, let me check the options again. Let me list them:

A: higher, freq decreases
B: higher, alternates
C: higher, increases
D: higher, remains
E: lower, increases
F: lower, remains
G: lower, decreases
H: same
I: lower, alternates
J: fluctuates

So according to my reasoning, it's option G.

But wait, wait, another perspective. Wait, no, wait. The student is on the third floor and drops the alarm. So when the alarm is just dropped, it's next to the student. So as the alarm falls, it's moving away from the student.

Wait, no, from the student's point of view, the alarm is moving away. So the Doppler effect applies as the source moving away, leading to a lower frequency.

But wait, wait, no, wait another moment. When you drop something, the initial velocity is zero, and it accelerates downward. So as it falls, its speed increases. So the Doppler shift would become more pronounced over time.

Wait, but in the case of the Doppler effect, the formula is f' = f * (v) / (v + vs), assuming the observer is stationary and the source is moving away at speed vs. So as vs increases, f' decreases.

Thus, as the alarm falls, vs increases, so f' decreases. So the observed frequency is lower than 400 Hz and continues to decrease as it falls.

Looking back at the options, option G is: appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency decreases as it falls. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, now I'm getting confused because I think the opposite. Let me think again.

Wait, when the source is moving away, the observed frequency is lower. So the initial frequency would be 400 Hz when it's stationary. As it starts moving away, the frequency drops. As it speeds up (because it's in free fall), the frequency observed by the student drops even more.

So the frequency is lower than 400 Hz, and as it falls, the frequency decreases further. So the correct answer is G.

But wait, looking at the options, option E says the frequency increases as it falls. So that can't be right. Because the frequency should be decreasing.

So the answer should be G.

The problem involves an alarm with a frequency of 400 Hz being dropped from a third-floor window. The student measures the frequency using an oscilloscope. To analyze this, the Doppler effect must be considered, which describes how the observed frequency of a sound changes when the source is moving relative to the observer.

When the alarm is stationary, the observed frequency is 400 Hz. As the alarm falls, it accelerates downward due to gravity, moving away from the student. According to the Doppler effect, when the source moves away from the observer, the observed frequency decreases. The formula for the observed frequency is:

\[
f' = f \cdot \frac{v}{v + v_s}
\]

where \( f \) is the actual frequency, \( v \) is the speed of sound in air, and \( v_s \) is the speed of the source moving away from the observer. As the alarm falls, \( v_s \) increases due to acceleration, causing \( f' \) to decrease further over time.

Thus, the observed frequency is lower than 400 Hz, and it decreases as the alarm falls. This matches the description in option G.

**Critical analysis of the options:**

- **A, B, C, D:** These options suggest the frequency appears higher than 400 Hz, which is incorrect because the source is moving away, not towards the observer.
- **E:** Suggests the frequency increases as it falls, which is incorrect because the frequency decreases as the source moves away faster.
- **F:** Suggests the frequency remains constant, which is incorrect because the speed of the source increases, causing the frequency to decrease further.
- **G:** Correctly states that the frequency appears lower than 400 Hz and decreases as it falls.
- **H:** Suggests the frequency remains at 400 Hz, which is incorrect because the Doppler effect causes a shift in frequency.
- **I, J:** Suggest alternation or fluctuation in frequency, which is not consistent with the scenario of steady acceleration downward.

The correct answer is **G**.
