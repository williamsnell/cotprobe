Okay, so I've got this question about unsafe water and the number of deaths it causes each year as of 2019. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on exact numbers, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that waterborne diseases are a major public health issue, especially in developing countries. Diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid come to mind. These are often spread through contaminated water sources.

I think the World Health Organization (WHO) has some statistics on this. From what I recall, unsafe water, along with poor sanitation and hygiene, contributes significantly to mortality, particularly among children. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact figure.

Wait, the question is about unsafe water specifically. I think the number might be in the millions. I've heard somewhere that around 800,000 to a million deaths occur each year due to unsafe drinking water. But wait, maybe that's just for children. Or was it a broader figure?

Alternatively, I've come across reports stating that around 3.4 million deaths annually are caused by waterborne diseases. But that might include not just unsafe water but also lack of sanitation and poor hygiene. Oh, but the question specifically mentions unsafe water, so maybe it's a subset of that number.

Wait, another angle: I remember reading that in 2019, the number was around 485,000 deaths from unsafe drinking water, but that seems low. Or maybe that was just for a specific region. Alternatively, I've heard that diarrheal diseases, which are often water-related, cause about 1.6 million deaths annually, but again, that's a broader category.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the numbers. Let me think again. Oh right, I think the more accurate figure is around 800,000 deaths each year from unsafe water. That would correspond to option H: 800,000.

But wait, another thought: I've heard that the number might be higher because unsafe water also contributes to other health issues beyond just the immediate diseases. For example, malnutrition can be exacerbated by repeated diarrheal infections, which might not be directly counted in the mortality stats. So maybe the figure is higher?

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. For example, I remember that in 2002, the WHO estimated around 1.7 million deaths from unsafe water, but that was an older figure. I think the numbers have decreased since then due to global efforts, but maybe not that much.

Wait, the options given include 800,000 (option H) and others. I'm starting to think that 800,000 might be the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall any specific sources. Oh, right, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have targets related to clean water, and I think they cited that about 800,000 people die each year from lack of access to safe water. 

Wait, but another angle: if the question includes all deaths from water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) related issues, then the number would be higher. For instance, the WHO might report that around 3.4 million deaths are due to WASH issues, but that includes unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene. So if the question is only about unsafe water, maybe it's a portion of that number.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct figure is around 500,000. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of any reports I've read. Oh, the CDC mentions that each year, 801,000 children under 15 die from diarrheal diseases, which are often linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation. But the question isn't limited to children, so the total would be higher.

Wait, but that 801,000 is just for children, so the total including adults would be higher. If so, then 800,000 wouldn't make sense as the total. Maybe the figure is around 1.2 million or so.

Wait, looking at the options again: option E is 1.2 million, H is 800,000, and I'm torn between them. I think I've heard the 800k figure more often in the context of unsafe water specifically, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 3.6 million (option J). No, that seems too high. Or perhaps 1.2 million (option E). I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the global burden of disease study or perhaps the WHO's water sanitation hygiene pages would have this info. From what I recall, the 2019 data suggests that unsafe drinking water causes around 485,000 diarrheal deaths each year. But that's just diarrheal diseases, and not all deaths from unsafe water.

Wait, that would be around 485k, which is close to option D: 500,000. So maybe that's the figure. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, I've read that in 2017, the number was approximately 1.2 million deaths from unsafe water and sanitation. So that would correspond to option E: 1.2 million.

But I'm getting a bit confused because different sources might group things differently. If the question is specifically about unsafe water, the number might be lower than if it includes both water and sanitation.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is around 800,000, which would be option H. Alternatively, if it's higher, maybe 1.2 million.

I'm going to go with the 800,000 figure, as I think that's the number I've heard more frequently cited for unsafe water specifically.

As of 2019, unsafe water is responsible for about how many deaths each year? To answer this, I considered various sources and reports. Waterborne diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, often spread through contaminated water, contribute significantly to mortality, particularly in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other global health entities provide relevant data.

I initially thought the number might be around 800,000 deaths annually, as this figure is often cited for unsafe water specifically. However, I also considered broader categories, such as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related deaths, which might include a higher number, around 3.4 million. But since the question focuses solely on unsafe water, I narrowed it down.

Additionally, I recalled that diarrheal diseases, often linked to unsafe water, cause approximately 1.6 million deaths annually, but this includes both children and adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mentions that 801,000 children under 15 die from diarrheal diseases each year, suggesting the total number, including adults, would be higher. This led me to consider options like 1.2 million (option E) or 800,000 (option H).

After weighing the evidence, I concluded that the figure of 800,000 deaths annually from unsafe water is the most frequently cited and specific to the question. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: 800,000
