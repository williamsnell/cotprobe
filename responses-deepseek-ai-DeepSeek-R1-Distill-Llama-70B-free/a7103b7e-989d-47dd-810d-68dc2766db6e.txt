Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Huemer's arguments on drug use harms. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about Huemer's stance on why the harms of drug use aren't considered in a specific way. The options are A, B, C, and D. I remember that Huemer has written about drug legalization, so maybe this is from that context.

Option A says "more harmful on average than legally permitted harmful activities." So, Huemer might be arguing that drugs aren't worse than other things we already allow, like alcohol or tobacco. That makes sense because sometimes people argue that legal drugs can be as harmful as illegal ones.

Option B is "differing from the harms of other legally permitted harmful activities." This suggests that the nature of the harm from drugs is different, but I'm not sure if Huemer is focusing on the type of harm or the degree. I think he's more about the comparison in terms of harm level rather than the kind.

Option C states "more detrimental to a person's character than others legally permitted harmful activities." This seems to imply a moral judgment about the user's character, which doesn't ring a bell with what I know about Huemer's arguments. He's more about the pragmatic aspects like harm and liberty rather than moral character.

So, putting it together, Huemer likely argues that the harms of drug use aren't more severe on average than other permitted activities. That would make option A correct. But wait, the question says there's no reason to think the harms are in an important sense... So, if A is the correct point, then the answer is A. But I'm also considering if the question is about whether the harms are more or different. 

Wait, the question is phrased as "no reason to think that the harms are in an important sense..." So if the harms aren't more on average, then option A would be the correct choice because there's no reason to think they're more harmful than what's already permitted.

I don't think B or C fit as well because the argument is more about the comparison of harm levels rather than the type of harm or moral impact. So the answer should be A.

The question revolves around Huemer's argument regarding the harms of drug use relative to legally permitted activities. Huemer's stance is that there is no reason to believe the harms of drug use are significantly worse than those of other legally allowed harmful activities, such as alcohol or tobacco. This aligns with option A, which focuses on the average level of harm. Options B and C, which discuss the nature of harm and moral character, respectively, are less relevant to Huemer's argument, which centers on the comparative severity of harm rather than its type or moral implications.

Answer: A
