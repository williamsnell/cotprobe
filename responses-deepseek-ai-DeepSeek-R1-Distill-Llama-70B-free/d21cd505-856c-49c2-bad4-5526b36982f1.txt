Okay, so Patricia starts with a salary of $20,000. The question is about calculating her salary after two years with two 10% increases. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, after the first year, her salary increases by 10%. So I should calculate 10% of $20,000 and add it to her original salary. Let's see, 10% of 20,000 is 2,000. So after the first year, she'll make 20,000 + 2,000 = $22,000.

Now, the second year's increase is again 10%, but this time it's based on the previous year's salary, which is now $22,000. So I need to find 10% of 22,000. 10% of 22,000 is 2,200. Adding that to her current salary gives 22,000 + 2,200 = $24,200.

Wait, let me double-check that. First increase: 20k * 1.10 = 22k. Second increase: 22k * 1.10 = 24.2k. So yes, that's $24,200 after two years.

Looking at the options, option D is $24,200. So the answer should be D.

The correct answer is calculated by applying two successive 10% increases to Patricia's starting salary.

1. **First year's increase**:  
   10% of $20,000 = $2,000.  
   New salary = $20,000 + $2,000 = **$22,000**.

2. **Second year's increase**:  
   10% of $22,000 = $2,200.  
   New salary = $22,000 + $2,200 = **$24,200**.

Thus, after two years, Patricia's salary is **$24,200**, which corresponds to option D.

D
