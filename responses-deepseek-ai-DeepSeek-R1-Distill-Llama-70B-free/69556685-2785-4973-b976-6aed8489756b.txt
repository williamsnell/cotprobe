Okay, so I have this question about directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. The question is asking which of the statements I, II, III must be true for a finite DAG with at least one edge. Hmm. Let me think through each part step by step.

First, let's understand what a DAG is. A DAG is a directed graph with no cycles. So, there's no path that starts and ends on the same vertex, right? And finite means it has a limited number of vertices and edges, but the edges are more than zero here.

Now, let's look at the statements:

I. G has a vertex with no incoming edge.
II. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.
III. G has an isolated vertex, meaning it has neither incoming nor outgoing edges.

I remember that in a DAG, the concept of a topological sort comes into play. In a topological order, you arrange the vertices such that for every directed edge (u â†’ v), u comes before v in the ordering. So, in such a sorted list, the first vertex must have no incoming edges because there's nothing before it. Similarly, the last vertex must have no outgoing edges because there's nothing after it. So, statements I and II seem correct.

Wait, but statement III says there's an isolated vertex, which has neither. Does every DAG have such a vertex? Hmm. Let's think of an example. Suppose I have a DAG with two vertices, A and B, and a single edge from A to B. So, A has no incoming edges (so I is satisfied), B has no outgoing edges (so II is satisfied). But neither A nor B are isolated because A has an outgoing edge, and B has an incoming edge. So in this case, there's no isolated vertex. Therefore, statement III isn't necessarily true. So III is false.

So, the correct statements are I and II only. Looking at the options, option C is "I and II only." So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another way to think about this: the topological sort has a source (no incoming edges) and a sink (no outgoing edges). But the source might have outgoing edges, and the sink might have incoming edges. So, the source and sink are not necessarily isolated. So, yeah, statements I and II are always true, but III is not necessarily.

So the correct choice is C: I and II only.

In a finite directed acyclic graph (DAG) with at least one edge, we analyze the given statements:

1. **Statement I**: A DAG must have at least one vertex with no incoming edges. This is true because, in a topological ordering of a DAG, the first vertex has no incoming edges (it is a source).

2. **Statement II**: A DAG must have at least one vertex with no outgoing edges. This is also true because, in a topological ordering, the last vertex has no outgoing edges (it is a sink).

3. **Statement III**: A DAG must have an isolated vertex (a vertex with neither incoming nor outgoing edges). This is not necessarily true. For example, in a DAG with two vertices connected by a single edge, neither vertex is isolated.

Thus, statements I and II are always true, but statement III is not necessarily true. The correct answer is:

**C: I and II only**

Answer: C
