Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the mass of the homosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my atmospheric layers, but I remember that the homosphere is the lowest layer of the Earth's atmosphere where the composition is fairly uniform. Oh wait, right, it's where the atmosphere is well-mixed, up to about 100 km or so, but I think for this problem, the exact height might not matter because maybe we're making an approximation.

The question gives me some values: Earth's mean radius is 6.37 × 10^6 meters, normal atmospheric pressure is 1.013 × 10^5 N/m², and gravitational acceleration is 9.8 m/s². I need to find the mass of the homosphere.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think atmospheric mass is related to pressure and gravity. Oh right, the formula for the mass of the atmosphere can be derived from the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. So the pressure at the Earth's surface is due to the weight of the atmosphere above it. The formula I remember is P = (mass of atmosphere) * g / (4 * π * R²), but wait, let me think again.

Pressure P is force per unit area. The force here is the weight of the atmosphere, which is mass times gravity (mg). The area over which this force is exerted is the Earth's surface area, which is 4πR². So P = (m * g) / (4πR²). Rearranging that, m = (P * 4πR²) / g.

Let me plug in the numbers. P is 1.013e5 N/m², R is 6.37e6 m, g is 9.8 m/s².

Calculating step by step. Let me compute 4πR² first. 4 * π is approximately 12.566. Multiply by R squared. R squared is (6.37e6)^2. Let me compute that:

6.37^2 is about 40.57, so (6.37e6)^2 = 40.57e12 m². Multiply by 12.566: 40.57e12 * 12.566. Let's approximate that. 40 * 12.566 is about 502.64, and 0.57 *12.566 is about 7.17, so total around 509.81e12 m². Wait, that's 5.0981e14 m².

Now multiply by P, which is 1.013e5 N/m². So (1.013e5) * (5.0981e14) = let's calculate that. 1.013 * 5.0981 is about 5.164. So 5.164e19. But wait, units? N is kg·m/s², so N/m² is kg/(m·s²). Hmm, but maybe units will work out.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me compute 4πR²:

R = 6.37e6 m, so R squared is (6.37e6)^2 = (6.37)^2 * 1e12. 6.37 squared is 40.5769, so 40.5769e12 m².

4π is about 12.566. So 12.566 * 40.5769e12 = let's compute that.

12 *40.5769e12 = 486.9228e12, 0.566 *40.5769e12 is approx 22.94e12. So total is 486.9228 +22.94 = 509.8628e12 m², which is 5.098628e14 m².

Multiply that by P=1.013e5 N/m²: 1.013e5 *5.098628e14 = (1.013 *5.098628) * 1e5 *1e14 = (5.164) * 1e19 = 5.164e19 kg·m/s² * m²? Wait, let's think about units.

Wait, the pressure P is in N/m², which is (kg·m/s²)/m²) = kg/(m·s²). So when you multiply P by area (m²), you get kg·m/s², which is a force. Wait, but that's the total force exerted by the atmosphere, which is mg. So m = (P * 4π R²) / g.

So let me compute that. I've got m = (1.013e5) * (5.0986e14) / (9.8).

Compute numerator: 1.013e5 * 5.0986e14 = 5.164e19 as before.

Wait, 1.013e5 is 1.013 * 1e5. 5.0986e14 is 5.0986 *1e14. Multiply them: (1.013 *5.0986) = approx 5.164, and 1e5 *1e14 = 1e19. So numerator is 5.164e19.

Now divide by g=9.8 m/s²: 5.164e19 /9.8 ≈ 5.27e18 kg.

Wait, but let me calculate that more accurately. 5.164 /9.8= approx 0.527. So 0.527e19 is 5.27e18 kg.

Looking at the options, option E is 5.27 ×10^18 kg. So the answer would be E.

Wait but wait a second. I think I might have mixed up the formula. Another approach I've heard of is using the relation P = ρgh, where ρ is air density, g is gravity, and h is scale height. But maybe that's a different approach. Alternatively, the mass might be calculated as the surface pressure divided by gravity, multiplied by the area, which is what I did.

Alternatively, I've heard that the total mass of the atmosphere is approximately 5.15 ×10^18 kg. So why is my calculation giving 5.27e18? Hmm, perhaps because I used approximate values for R and g.

Wait the given values are R=6.37e6 m, P=1.013e5, g=9.8. Using these precise numbers.

Let me recalculate with more precise steps.

Compute 4π R²:

4π = 12.566370614.

R^2 = (6.37e6)^2 = (6.37)^2 * 1e12 = 40.5769e12 m².

So 4π R² = 12.566370614 *40.5769e12.

Let me compute 12 *40.5769= 486.9228, 0.566370614 *40.5769 is approximately, let's compute:

0.5 *40.5769 =20.28845, 0.066370614 *40.5769 ≈2.695. So total around 20.28845+2.695=22.983. So 486.9228 +22.983=509.9058e12 =5.099058e14 m².

Multiply by P=1.013e5: 5.099058e14 *1.013e5 = (5.099058 *1.013) *1e19.

5.099058 *1.013: 5 *1.013=5.065, 0.099058 *1.013≈0.1003. So total is approx 5.1653. So 5.1653e19 (kg·m/s² * m²? Wait, no, the units are N=kg·m/s², so N/m² * m² = N, which is force. So m=P*A/(g), so m=(N)/(g) = (kg·m/s²) / (m/s²) )= kg.

So m=5.1653e19 /9.8 = 5.1653e19 /9.8.

Compute 5.1653e19 /9.8:

5.1653 /9.8 = 0.527 (since 5.2 is 0.53*9.8=5.194, so 0.527 is correct). So 0.527e19 kg =5.27e18 kg.

Which matches option E:5.27 ×10^18 kg.

So the correct answer should be E.

To calculate the mass of the homosphere, we use the relationship between atmospheric pressure, gravitational acceleration, and the Earth's surface area. The formula for the mass of the atmosphere is derived from the hydrostatic equilibrium condition:

\[
m = \frac{P \cdot 4\pi R^2}{g}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 1.013 \times 10^5 \, \text{N/m}^2 \) (normal atmospheric pressure),
- \( R = 6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \) (Earth's mean radius),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (gravitational acceleration).

### Step 1: Calculate the Earth's surface area
The Earth's surface area is given by \( 4\pi R^2 \). Substituting \( R = 6.37 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \):

\[
R^2 = (6.37 \times 10^6)^2 = 40.5769 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}^2
\]

\[
4\pi R^2 = 12.566 \cdot 40.5769 \times 10^{12} = 5.0986 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Multiply pressure by surface area
The total force exerted by the atmosphere is:

\[
P \cdot 4\pi R^2 = (1.013 \times 10^5) \cdot (5.0986 \times 10^{14}) = 5.164 \times 10^{19} \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 3: Divide by gravitational acceleration
The mass of the atmosphere is:

\[
m = \frac{5.164 \times 10^{19}}{9.8} = 5.27 \times 10^{18} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated mass of the homosphere is approximately \( 5.27 \times 10^{18} \, \text{kg} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
