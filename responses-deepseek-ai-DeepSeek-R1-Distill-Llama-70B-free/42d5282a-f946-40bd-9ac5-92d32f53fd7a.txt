Okay, so I have this problem about Owens Company and a draft they accepted. Hmm, I remember that a draft is like a bill of exchange, right? So Watts Bros. drew a draft on Owens Company for $560, and it's a 90-day sight draft. I think that means the payment is due 90 days after the draft is accepted.

Wait, the question says it's a 90-day sight draft. So when Owens accepts it, the due date is 90 days from then. Now, Watts Bros. discounted this draft 34 days before the due date. Oh right, discounting a draft means they're getting the money before it's due, but they have to pay a discount rate.

The rate given is 6%. So I need to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the face value to find the proceeds. Proceeds are what Watts Bros. actually receive after the discount.

Wait, let me think. The formula for the discount is face value multiplied by the rate multiplied by the time. But time here is in years. So how do I convert days into years?

Since the draft is discounted 34 days before due date, the time is 34 days. To get the time in years, I divide by 360 or 365. I think in finance, it's usually 360 days a year, the banker's year. So 34/360 years.

Calculating the discount: 560 * 0.06 * (34/360). Let me compute that.

First, 0.06 * 34 = 2.04. Then, 2.04 / 360 = approximately 0.005666... So 560 * 0.005666 is... Let's calculate that. 560 * 0.005 is 2.8, and 0.000666 * 560 is about 0.373. So total discount is around 3.173.

Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. 34/360 is 0.094444... So 560 * 0.06 is 33.6. Then 33.6 * 0.094444 is... Let's calculate that. 33.6 * 0.09 = 3.024, and 33.6 * 0.004444 is about 0.149. So total discount is approximately 3.024 + 0.149 = 3.173. So the discount is $3.17 approximately.

Wait, but let me do it step by step. 34 days is the unexpired time. So the discount is (560 * 6% * 34/360). Let me compute it exactly.

First, 6% is 0.06. 34 divided by 360 is 34/360. So 560 * 0.06 = 33.6. Then 33.6 * (34/360) = ?

Wait, 34/360 is 17/180. So 33.6 * 17 = let's compute 33*17=561, 0.6*17=10.2, so total 571.2. Then divide by 180: 571.2 /180 = 3.1733... So approximately $3.17.

So the discount is $3.17. Therefore, the proceeds are 560 - 3.17 = $556.83.

Looking at the options, option H is $556.83. So the answer should be H.

To determine the proceeds Watts Bros. received when discounting the draft, we calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the face value of the draft.

1. **Face Value**: $560  
2. **Discount Rate**: 6% (0.06)  
3. **Time in Years**: 34 days รท 360 = 0.094444...

The discount is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Discount} = 560 \times 0.06 \times 0.094444 = 3.1733...
\]

The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:  
\[
\text{Proceeds} = 560 - 3.1733 = 556.83
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **H: $556.83**.
