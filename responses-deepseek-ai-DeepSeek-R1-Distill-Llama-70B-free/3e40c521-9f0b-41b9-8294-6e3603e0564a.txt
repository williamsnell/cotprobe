To solve the second order boundary-value problem given by the differential equation \( y'' - 2y' + 2y = 0 \) with boundary conditions \( y(0) = 0 \) and \( y\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1 \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Solve the Homogeneous Differential Equation
The given differential equation is linear and homogeneous. To find the general solution, we first solve the characteristic equation:

\[
r^2 - 2r + 2 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
r = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{(2)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm 2i}{2} = 1 \pm i
\]

Thus, the general solution to the differential equation is:

\[
y(x) = e^{x} \left( C_1 \cos(x) + C_2 \sin(x) \right)
\]

### Step 2: Apply Boundary Conditions
Now, we apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \).

1. **Boundary Condition at \( x = 0 \):**

\[
y(0) = e^{0} \left( C_1 \cos(0) + C_2 \sin(0) \right) = C_1 (1) + C_2 (0) = C_1 = 0
\]

Thus, \( C_1 = 0 \).

2. **Boundary Condition at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \):**

\[
y\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = e^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left( C_1 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + C_2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \right)
\]

Since \( C_1 = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
1 = e^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left( 0 + C_2 (1) \right) \implies C_2 = e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}
\]

### Step 3: Write the Particular Solution
Substituting \( C_1 = 0 \) and \( C_2 = e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} \) into the general solution:

\[
y(x) = e^{x} \left( 0 \cdot \cos(x) + e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(x) \right) = e^{x} e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(x) = e^{x - \frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(x)
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate \( y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \)

Now, we evaluate the solution at \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \):

\[
y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = e^{\frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{2}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = e^{-\frac{\pi}{4}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Using \( e^{-\frac{\pi}{4}} \approx 0.456 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707 \):

\[
y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \approx 0.456 \cdot 0.707 \approx 0.322
\]

### Final Answer
The value of \( y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \) is approximately **0.322**, which corresponds to option **H**.
