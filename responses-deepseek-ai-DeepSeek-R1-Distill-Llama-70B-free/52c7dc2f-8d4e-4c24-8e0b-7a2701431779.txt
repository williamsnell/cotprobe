Question:

The American flag is usually made with its width and length in the ratio of 10 to 19. Which dimensions are in the correct ratio for the flag?

Options:

B: 35 ft by 66 ft
C: 25 ft by 47 ft
D: 30 ft by 53 ft
E: 30 in. by 57 in.
F: 45 in. by 85 in.
G: 27 in. by 57 in.

Okay, so I've got this question about the American flag's dimensions and their ratio. The question says the width to length ratio is 10 to 19. I need to find which of the options matches that ratio.

First, I think I should understand what a ratio means here. The ratio 10:19 means that for every 10 units of width, the length is 19 units. So, width divided by length should equal 10/19. Alternatively, width is (10/19) times the length.

Now, looking at the options, each gives two dimensions. I guess the first number is the width and the second is the length. So for each option, I should calculate width/length and see if it's approximately 10/19.

Let me calculate 10 divided by 19 to get an approximate decimal. 10 ÷ 19 is about 0.5263. So I'm looking for a width/length ratio close to 0.526.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: 27 ft by 53 ft. So 27/53. Let me calculate that. 27 ÷ 53 is approximately 0.5094. That's a bit lower than 0.5263. So not quite matching.

Option B: 35 by 66. 35/66. Let's see: 35 ÷ 66 is about 0.5303. That's very close to 0.5263. Hmm, maybe this is the one. But I should check all options.

Option C: 25 by 47. 25/47 is approximately 0.5319. Also close, but a bit higher than 0.526. Wait, but maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, 10/19 is exactly 0.526315789... So 35/66 is about 0.5303. Let me subtract: 0.5303-0.5263 is about 0.004, which is a small difference. Option C is 25/47. Let me compute that. 25 ÷ 47: 47 goes into 25 zero, then 250 divided by 47 is about 5 times (5*47=235), remainder 15. 150/47 is about 3 (3*47=141), remainder 9. So 0.5319 approximately. So that's a bit higher.

Option D: 30 by 53. 30/53 is about 0.566. That's higher, so no.

Option E: 30 inches by 57 inches. 30/57 simplifies to 10/19 because both divided by 3 are 10 and 19. Oh wait, that's exactly the ratio. So 30/57 is exactly 10/19. So this option E is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the other options just to be thorough.

Option F: 45 in. by 85 in. 45/85. Let's simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5, that's 9/17. 9/17 is approximately 0.5294, which is close but not exactly 10/19.

Option G: 27 in. by 57 in. 27/57 simplifies by dividing by 3: 9/19. So the ratio is 9:19. That's not 10:19. So no.

Wait, so the correct ratio is when the width is 10 units and length 19. So for any option where width/length = 10/19, it's correct. But looking back, option E is 30 by 57. 30 divided by 57 is 10/19 because 30 is 10*3 and 57 is 19*3. So that's exactly the ratio. So E is correct.

But just to double-check, let's see if any other option also gives the same ratio. For instance, option E is inches, others are feet. But the ratio is unitless, so the units don't matter as long as both are the same. So E is correct.

Wait, but wait, what about option B? 35/66. Let me check: 35 is 5*7, 66 is 6*11. No common factors. 35/66 is approximately 0.5303, which is very close but not exact. So E is exactly correct.

So the answer should be option E.

The American flag's width to length ratio is specified as 10:19. This means that for every 10 units of width, the length is 19 units, or mathematically, width/length = 10/19 ≈ 0.5263. To determine the correct dimensions, each option is evaluated by calculating the width/length ratio and comparing it to 10/19.

- **Option A (27 ft by 53 ft):** 27/53 ≈ 0.5094, which is lower than 0.5263.
- **Option B (35 ft by 66 ft):** 35/66 ≈ 0.5303, which is very close but not exact.
- **Option C (25 ft by 47 ft):** 25/47 ≈ 0.5319, which is slightly higher than 0.5263.
- **Option D (30 ft by 53 ft):** 30/53 ≈ 0.566, which is too high.
- **Option E (30 in. by 57 in.):** 30/57 simplifies to 10/19 exactly, as 30 = 10×3 and 57 = 19×3. This matches the required ratio perfectly.
- **Option F (45 in. by 85 in.):** 45/85 ≈ 0.5294, which is close but not exact.
- **Option G (27 in. by 57 in.):** 27/57 simplifies to 9/19, which is not 10/19.

Among all the options, **Option E** is the only one where the width/length ratio exactly matches 10:19. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E**
