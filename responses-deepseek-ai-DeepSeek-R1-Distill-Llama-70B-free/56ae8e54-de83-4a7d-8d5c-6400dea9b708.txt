Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don’t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?
1. An attacker replacing bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker’s own choosing.
2. An attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client.

Options:

A: False, True
B: False, False
C: False, Partly True
D: Partly True, False
E: True, False
F: True, Partly False
G: True, Partly True
H: Partly False, True
I: True, True
J: Partly True, True

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about TLS security, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a TLS connection has been successfully established between a client and a server. They checked the server certificate and did a Diffie-Hellman exchange. But the client didn’t provide a certificate. Both are honest, don’t leak keys, and the crypto is good.

The question asks which attacks TLS protects against. The options are two statements:

1. An attacker replacing bytes sent by a client with their own.
2. An attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by the client.

The options are a combination of whether each statement is something TLS protects against. So I need to determine for each statement, does TLS prevent it?

First, I remember that TLS provides several security features: confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. But let me think about each point.

Statement 1: Attacker replacing bytes. So this is about tampering. TLS should have integrity checking. How? Because in TLS, each record is protected with a MAC (Message Authentication Code). The MAC is computed using a shared secret, so if an attacker tries to modify the data, the MAC would not match when the client or server verifies it. So the receiver would know the data was tampered with. So TLS does protect against this. So statement 1 is something TLS protects against.

Statement 2: Attacker reading plaintext. TLS encrypts the data, right? So if the encryption is good, then an attacker can’t read the plaintext. They can see the ciphertext, but not the actual data. So statement 2 is also protected against.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Since the client didn't provide a certificate, does that affect anything? Well, mutual authentication isn't in place here. The server is authenticated via the certificate, but the client isn't. So if an attacker does a man-in-the-middle (MITM), but wait, the server's certificate was checked. So MITM would require the attacker to have a valid certificate for the server, right? But in our scenario, the cryptography is good, so perhaps MITM isn't possible. So the encryption should hold, protecting both confidentiality and integrity.

So both statements 1 and 2 are attacks that TLS protects against. So the answer would be that both are true.

Looking at the options, option I is True, True. So the answer should be I.
</think>

TLS provides confidentiality through encryption and integrity through MACs. Since the server's certificate was verified and the cryptography is strong, an attacker cannot read the plaintext (statement 2) or modify the data without detection (statement 1). Both protections apply.
