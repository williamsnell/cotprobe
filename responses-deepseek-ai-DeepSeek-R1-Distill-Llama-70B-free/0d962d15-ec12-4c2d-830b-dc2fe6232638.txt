Okay, so I've got this problem here about the diffusion rate of water from an open cylindrical tank. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is a tank where the water surface is 25 feet below the top. Dry air is blown over the top, and the system is at 65°F and 1 atm. The air is stagnant, so I guess that means there's no bulk movement of air, right? So diffusion is the main thing happening here.

I remember that diffusion rate can be calculated using Fick's Law. Oh wait, Fick's Law for diffusion, right. So Fick's Law says that the diffusion rate is proportional to the concentration gradient and the area, and inversely proportional to the thickness of the medium through which it's diffusing. Or wait, maybe it's proportional to the concentration gradient and the diffusion coefficient. Let me get this straight.

The formula I think is something like N = -D * A * (dc/dx). But since the problem gives a stagnant medium, maybe it's a steady-state diffusion, so the equation would be N = (D * A * (c2 - c1)) / thickness. Oh wait, but in this case, the thickness would be the distance the water vapor has to diffuse through. Since the water is 25 ft below the top, I think that's the distance, so the air layer is 25 feet thick.

Wait, but wait, the tank is cylindrical, but the question is about the diffusion rate per square foot, so maybe the area will cancel out in the end? Because the question asks for the rate in lb moles per ft² per hour. So maybe I can calculate it per unit area.

So, the variables I need are:
- D: diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air. I think I need to find this value. But wait, I don't remember the exact value. Maybe I can calculate it or look it up from some table. But since I'm just thinking, I'll have to assume a value. Alternatively, maybe it's given in some formula or standard conditions.

At 65°F, which is about 18°C, I think the diffusion coefficient for water vapor in air is around 0.25 cm²/s. Wait, but units are important here. Because in the problem, the length is in feet and time in hours. So I need to convert D into the right units.

Wait, D is typically in cm²/s. So 0.25 cm²/s is 0.25e-4 m²/s, but wait, 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 0.25 cm²/s is 0.25e-4 m²/s.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for D in ft²/s. Let me think. 1 foot is 30.48 cm, so 1 ft² is (30.48)^2 cm² ≈ 929.03 cm². So 1 cm²/s = 1e-4 m²/s = 1/(929.03) ft²/s ≈ 1.076e-3 ft²/s.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because 1 ft² = 929.03 cm², so if D is 0.25 cm²/s, then in ft²/s, it's 0.25 / 929.03 ≈ 2.69e-4 ft²/s.

Wait, let me calculate that again. 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². But in terms of ft², 1 m is about 3.28084 feet, so 1 m² is (3.28084)^2 ft² ≈ 10.7639 ft². Therefore, 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m² = 1e-4 * 10.7639 ft² ≈ 0.00107639 ft². So 0.25 cm²/s is 0.25 * 0.00107639 ft²/s ≈ 0.0002691 ft²/s.

So D ≈ 0.0002691 ft²/s.

But wait, the time is in hours, so I should convert D into ft² per hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, multiply by 3600:

D = 0.0002691 ft²/s * 3600 s/hr ≈ 0.9695 ft²/hr.

Hmm, okay, so D is approximately 0.9695 ft²/hr at 65°F.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure if that value of D is correct. Maybe the actual D for water vapor in air at 65°F is different. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember a standard value. Wait, at 20°C, D is about 0.22 cm²/s. But 65°F is about 18.3°C, so maybe similar. Wait, so perhaps D is around 0.22 cm²/s. Let me use that.

So redoing the calculation: D = 0.22 cm²/s.

Convert to ft²/s:

0.22 cm²/s * (1 ft² / 929.03 cm²) ) = 0.22 / 929.03 ≈ 2.366e-4 ft²/s.

Then per hour: 2.366e-4 * 3600 ≈ 0.8527 ft²/hr.

So D ≈ 0.8527 ft²/hr.

Hmm, wait, but I'm not certain about that number. Maybe I should check a reference. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that D for water vapor in air is roughly around 0.2 to 0.3 cm²/s at around 20°C. So perhaps using 0.25 cm²/s as an estimate is acceptable for this problem.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact value of D. Maybe I can proceed with the calculation and see where it goes, and perhaps the options will help me check.

Next, I need the concentration gradient. The concentrations at the two ends of the diffusion path.

At the surface of the water, the air is saturated with water vapor. So the concentration there is the molar concentration of saturated water vapor at 65°F and 1 atm.

Then, at the top of the tank, since dry air is blown, the concentration there is zero, I think. Wait, no, because the air is blown over the top, so maybe the concentration at the top is very low, but perhaps we can approximate it as zero. Or maybe it's not zero, but since the air is dry, maybe the concentration is much lower than at the surface.

Wait, but in some setups, the concentration at the surface is c1 and at the end is c2, so the gradient is (c1 - c2). If the top is well-ventilated and kept dry, maybe c2 is zero, so the gradient is c1.

So I need to find c1, the molar concentration of water vapor at 65°F and 1 atm.

To find the molar concentration, I can use the ideal gas law. The concentration is n/V = P/(RT), where P is the vapor pressure, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in absolute units.

So first, I need the vapor pressure of water at 65°F. Let me check that. Wait, 65°F is 18.33°C. The vapor pressure of water at 18.33°C is approximately 1.444 kPa. Or wait, maybe I should recall that at 20°C, it's about 2.339 kPa, so at 18°C, it's a bit lower. Let me think. At 10°C, it's about 1.227 kPa. At 20°C, 2.339 kPa. So 18°C is near 20, perhaps around 2.06 kPa? Alternatively, maybe I can use a table. Wait, perhaps I can just approximate it as 1.9 kPa for 65°F? Wait, no, that's probably too low.

Alternatively, I can use the Antoine equation to calculate the vapor pressure. The Antoine equation is log10(P) = A - B/(T + C), where P is in mmHg and T is in °C.

For water, the constants are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So T is 18.33°C.

So log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(18.33 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(262.815) ≈ 8.14019 - 6.896 ≈ 1.244.

So P = 10^1.244 ≈ 17.45 mmHg.

Wait, 1 mmHg is 0.1333 kPa, so 17.45 mmHg is 17.45 * 0.1333 ≈ 2.33 kPa. Hmm, that's close to the value at 20°C, which makes sense because 65°F is 18.3°C, so it's a bit lower. So maybe P ≈ 2.33 kPa.

Wait, but wait, 65°F is 18.3°C. Let me calculate it accurately.

Using Antoine equation:

T = 18.3°C.

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(18.3 + 244.485) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/262.785 ≈ 8.14019 - 6.896 ≈ 1.24419.

So P = 10^1.24419 ≈ 17.45 mmHg. So converting to kPa: 17.45 mmHg * 0.1333 kPa/mmHg ≈ 2.33 kPa.

So the vapor pressure P = 2.33 kPa.

Now, the concentration c is n/V = P/(RT).

R is the gas constant. What value to use? Since we're dealing with lb moles, perhaps R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·°R). Wait, but our pressure is in kPa, so maybe better to use SI units first, then convert.

Alternatively, let's do everything in SI units and then convert to lb moles at the end.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in SI units and then convert.

So R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

T is 65°F, which is (65 - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15 = 18.333 + 273.15 ≈ 291.483 K.

So c = P/(R*T) = (23300 Pa) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 291.483 K).

Wait, Pa is N/m², J is N·m, so 8.314 J/mol·K is the same as 8.314 (N·m)/(mol·K) = 8.314 (m³·Pa)/(mol·K), since Pa = N/m² = kg/(m·s²), but perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

So P is 23300 Pa.

R*T = 8.314 * 291.483 ≈ let's compute that. 8 * 291 = 2328, 0.314*291 ≈ 91.4, so total ≈ 2328 +91.4 ≈ 2419.4 J/mol.

So c = 23300 / 2419.4 ≈ 9.63 mol/m³.

So that's the concentration at the water surface.

At the top, the air is dry, so c2 ≈ 0. So the concentration difference is 9.63 mol/m³.

Wait, but wait, the problem is that the diffusion is through a 25 ft layer of stagnant air. So the gradient is over 25 ft.

But wait, when using Fick's Law in steady state, the flux is (D * (c1 - c2)) / L, where L is the thickness.

But wait, so the molar flux N is D*(c1 - c2)/L.

Then, the rate per unit area would be N = (D * c1) / L, since c2 is zero.

So, N = (D * c1) / L.

But wait, we have to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me make sure.

So, D is in m²/s. c1 is in mol/m³. L is in meters.

So N would be (m²/s) * (mol/m³) / (m) ) = (m²/s * mol/m³) * 1/m = (mol/s·m²) * m = mol/(s·m) * m²? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. Fick's Law in steady state is:

N = (D * A * (c1 - c2)) / L

But N is in mol/s, A is area in m², L is length in meters.

So N per unit area would be (D*(c1 - c2))/L.

So the units would be (m²/s) * (mol/m³) / m = (mol/s·m). Which is mol/(m²·s), which is correct for molar flux.

So, in this case, since c2 is zero, it's (D * c1) / L.

So, plugging the numbers:

D = 0.25 cm²/s = 0.25e-4 m²/s.

c1 = 9.63 mol/m³.

L = 25 ft. Let's convert that to meters. 1 ft = 0.3048 m, so 25 ft = 7.62 m.

So N per unit area = (0.25e-4 m²/s * 9.63 mol/m³) / 7.62 m.

Compute numerator: 0.00025 * 9.63 ≈ 0.0024075 m²·mol/(s·m³).

Divide by 7.62 m: 0.0024075 /7.62 ≈ 3.158e-4 mol/(m²·s).

Hmm, that's per second. But we need per hour. So multiply by 3600 s/hr:

3.158e-4 * 3600 ≈ 1.137 mol/(m²·hr).

Wait, so the flux is about 1.137 mol/(m²·hr). But wait, the options are in lb moles, so I need to convert from mol to lb moles.

Wait, a mole is a mole, but lb mole is based on the pound-mole, where 1 lb mole is Avogadro's number of pounds. Wait, no, wait, the molecular weight of water is 18 g/mol, so 18 g/mol = 0.0396 lb/mol, since 1 lb is 453.59 grams.

Wait, no, actually, 1 lb mole is the amount of substance whose mass is equal to the molecular weight in pounds. So for water, molecular weight is 18.015 g/mol, which is 18.015 / 453.59 lb/mol ≈ 0.03968 lb/mol.

So 1 mol is 0.03968 lb mol.

So 1.137 mol/(m²·hr) * 0.03968 lb/mol ≈ 0.04514 lb mol/(m²·hr).

Wait, but wait, the tank is cylindrical, and the problem asks for the rate per ft². So we need to convert m² to ft².

1 m² is about 10.7639 ft². So 0.04514 lb mol/(m²·hr) * 10.7639 ft²/m² ≈ 0.04514 * 10.7639 ≈ 0.485 lb mol/(ft²·hr).

Wait, but that's 0.485 lb moles per square foot per hour. Looking at the options, the highest is 5e-6, which is much lower. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right. 0.485 lb moles/ft²·hr is way higher than any of the options. So I must have messed up the unit conversions.

Let me retrace my steps.

First, calculating c1, the concentration at the water surface:

I computed it as 9.63 mol/m³ using SI units. That seems correct.

Then, D was taken as 0.25 cm²/s, which is 0.25e-4 m²/s. That's correct.

L is 25 ft = 7.62 m. Correct.

So N per area is (D * c1) / L.

Plugging in, (0.25e-4 m²/s * 9.63 mol/m³) /7.62 m.

Compute numerator: 0.25e-4 *9.63 = 2.4075e-5 m²·mol/(s·m³).

Wait, m²·mol/(s·m³) = mol/(s·m).

Then divide by 7.62 m: 2.4075e-5 /7.62 ≈ 3.158e-6 mol/(s·m²).

Ah, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. So let me compute it again.

Wait, 0.00025 * 9.63 = 0.0024075.

Then 0.0024075 /7.62 ≈ 0.0003158 mol/(m²·s).

So 0.0003158 mol/(m²·s) is 3.158e-4 mol/(m²·s).

Multiply by 3600 s/hr: 3.158e-4 *3600 ≈ 1.137 mol/(m²·hr).

Now, converting to lb moles: 1.137 mol = 1.137 * 0.03968 lb mol ≈ 0.0451 lb mol.

So 0.0451 lb mol/(m²·hr).

Now, converting m² to ft²: 1 m² = 10.7639 ft², so 0.0451 lb mol/(m²·hr) = 0.0451 * 10.7639 lb mol/(ft²·hr).

0.0451 * 10.7639 ≈ 0.485 lb mol/(ft²·hr).

But that's way higher than any of the options, which go up to 5e-6. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for D. Let me check.

Wait, I used D as 0.25 cm²/s, which is 0.25e-4 m²/s. But perhaps the correct D is much smaller. Maybe I should
