Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because orbital mechanics isn't my strongest suit, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about putting a 1000-kg satellite into a circular orbit 300 km above Earth's surface. I need to find out how much work must be done on the satellite. The options are given, but I should try to calculate it myself first.

I remember that when you're dealing with putting an object into orbit, you have to consider both the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy. Wait, no, actually, I think the total mechanical energy in orbit is the sum of kinetic and potential, and the work done is the energy required to get it there.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. The work done against gravity to move the satellite from Earth's surface to that orbit. But wait, the satellite is moving from the Earth's surface to the orbit, or is it starting from somewhere else? Oh, wait, the problem says putting it into orbit, so I think we can assume it's being moved from the Earth's surface to the orbit.

Wait, but actually, the formula for the energy required to put a satellite into orbit includes considering its potential energy at that altitude and the kinetic energy it needs for circular orbit.

Hmm, I think the formula for the total mechanical energy (E) in a circular orbit is given by E = - (G * M_e * m) / (2r), where r is the radius from the center of the Earth. Because in orbit, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² and the potential is - (G M_e m)/r. So the total energy E is the sum, which is (1/2 mv²) - (G M_e m /r). But for a circular orbit, the centripetal force is provided by gravity, so mv²/r = G M_e m /r² → v² = G M_e / r. So substituting that into E gives (1/2)(G M_e m /r) - (G M_e m /r) = - (G M_e m)/(2r).

So the mechanical energy is negative, but the work done to put it there should be the change in mechanical energy from the Earth's surface to the orbit.

Wait, wait. The Earth's surface isn't necessarily the initial point. Wait, but in the problem, maybe the satellite is being lifted from the surface. So the initial state is when the satellite is on Earth's surface, and the final state is in orbit.

Wait, but on the Earth's surface, the gravitational potential energy is U = - (G M_e m) / R_e, where R_e is Earth's radius. And the kinetic energy there is zero because it's not moving yet. So the initial mechanical energy is E_initial = - (G M_e m)/ R_e.

The final mechanical energy in orbit is E_final = - (G M_e m)/(2r), where r is R_e + 300 km. So the work done should be the change in energy, E_final - E_initial, but wait, no, because work done by external forces is the change in mechanical energy. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, the work done on the satellite is equal to the change in its mechanical energy. So W = ΔE = E_final - E_initial.

Wait, let me make sure. The mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So the work done by external forces (like a rocket) to move the satellite from the surface to the orbit would be the difference between the final and initial mechanical energies.

So substituting, E_initial is the energy at Earth's surface: E_initial = - (G M_e m)/ R_e.

E_final is the energy in orbit: E_final = - (G M_e m) / (2r), where r = R_e + 300 km.

So W = E_final - E_initial.

Wait, but that would be W = [ - (G M_e m)/(2r) ] - [ - (G M_e m)/ R_e ]

Simplify that: W = (G M_e m) [ (1/R_e) - (1/(2r)) ) ].

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if you're moving something against gravity, you expect the work done to be positive. Let me make sure about the signs.

Wait, the initial mechanical energy is lower (more negative) than the final, because in orbit, the satellite is higher, so the potential energy is less negative (higher). So E_final is less negative than E_initial. So E_final - E_initial would be positive, which makes sense because you're doing work on the satellite.

Wait, let me compute this. Let me plug numbers in.

Given:

Mass of satellite, m = 1000 kg.

Earth's radius, R_e = 6.38e6 meters.

Mass of Earth, M_e = 5.97e24 kg.

Altitude h = 300 km = 300,000 meters, so r = R_e + h = 6.38e6 + 3e5 = Let's compute that: 6.38e6 is 6,380,000, plus 300,000 is 6,680,000 meters, so r = 6.68e6 m.

G is the gravitational constant, 6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg².

So the initial mechanical energy E_initial = - (G M_e m) / R_e.

E_final = - (G M_e m) / (2r).

So work done W is E_final - E_initial = [ - (G M_e m)/(2r) ] - [ - (G M_e m)/R_e ].

Which becomes W = (G M_e m) [ (1/R_e) - (1/(2r)) ].

Let me compute each part.

First, calculate (1/R_e) and 1/(2r).

1/R_e = 1 / 6.38e6 m ≈ 1.568e-7 m^-1.

1/(2r) = 1/(2 *6.68e6 ) = 1/(1.336e7 ) ≈ 7.48e-8 m^-1.

So [1/R_e - 1/(2r) ] ≈ 1.568e-7 - 7.48e-8 = about 8.8e-8 m^-1.

Wait wait, wait. Let me compute more accurately.

1/R_e = 1/(6.38e6) = approximately 0.0000001568 m^-1 = 1.568e-7 m^-1.

r = 6.38e6 + 0.3e6 = 6.68e6 m.

So 2r = 13.36e6 m, so 1/(2r) = 1/(13.36e6 ) = approx 7.483e-8 m^-1.

So 1/R_e - 1/(2r) = 1.568e-7 - 7.483e-8 = Let's compute that.

1.568e-7 is 0.1568e-6, 7.483e-8 is 0.07483e-6.

So 0.1568e-6 - 0.07483e-6 = 0.08197e-6 ≈ 8.197e-8 m^-1.

So the term inside the brackets is approximately 8.197e-8 m^-1.

Now, G M_e m = 6.6743e-11 * 5.97e24 kg * 1000 kg.

Let me compute that step by step.

Compute G*M_e first: 6.6743e-11 * 5.97e24 = 

6.6743e-11 * 5.97e24 = 6.6743 * 5.97 = let's compute that:

6 *5.97 is about 35.82, 0.6743 *5.97 ≈ 4.03, so total approx 39.85. But more precisely:

6.6743 *5.97 = ?

Let me compute 6 *5.97 =35.82, 0.6743 *5.97.

0.6 *5.97=3.582, 0.0743*5.97≈0.443, so total 3.582+0.443=4.025.

So 6.6743 *5.97 ≈ 39.845. So 39.845e13 (since 1e-11 * 1e24 = 1e13).

So G*M_e = approx 3.9845e14 m³/s².

Then multiply by m=1000 kg: 3.9845e14 *1e3 = 3.9845e17.

Wait, no, wait: G*M_e is 6.674e-11 * 5.97e24 = let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 6.6743e-11 * 5.97e24:

Multiply 6.6743 *5.97 = let's compute:

6 *5.97=35.82, 0.6743*5.97.

As before, 0.6 *5.97=3.582, 0.0743 *5.97≈0.443. So 3.582 +0.443=4.025. So 35.82 +4.025=39.845.

So 6.6743e-11 *5.97e24 = 39.845e13 → 3.9845e14 m³/s².

Then multiply by m=1000 kg: 3.9845e14 *1e3 = 3.9845e17 J·m.

Wait, no, wait. The units: G is in m³/(kg s²), M_e is kg. So G*M_e has units m³/s². Then, when you multiply by m (kg), G*M_e*m has units m³/s² * kg → which is (N·m²/kg) * kg → N·m² = J·m. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute G*M_e*m as the product, and then multiply by the term [1/R_e - 1/(2r)], which is in m^-1.

So the units would be (m³/s²) * kg * (1/m) )= (m³ kg)/(s² m) )= kg m²/s² = Joules.

So the correct way is to compute G*M_e*m*(1/R_e - 1/(2r)).

So let's compute that.

So G*M_e = 6.6743e-11 *5.97e24 = let me compute this accurately.

6.6743e-11 *5.97e24 = (6.6743 *5.97) * 1e13 = 39.845e13 = 3.9845e14 m³/s².

Multiply by m=1000 kg: 3.9845e14 *1e3 = 3.9845e17 m³ kg/(s²).

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute G*M_e*m as 6.674e-11 *5.97e24 *1e3.

Compute 6.674e-11 *5.97e24 first: 

6.674 *5.97 = approx 39.84 as before. Then 1e-11 * 1e24 = 1e13.

So 39.84 *1e13 = 3.984e14.

Multiply by 1e3 (m=1000 kg):

3.984e14 *1e3 = 3.984e17.

Now, multiply that by [1/R_e - 1/(2r)] which is 8.197e-8 m^-1.

So the work W = 3.984e17 * 8.197e-8.

Let me compute that: 3.984e17 *8.197e-8 = (3.984 *8.197) *1e9.

Compute 3.984 *8.197:

Let me compute 4 *8=32, but more accurately:

3 *8=24, 0.984*8=7.872. So 24 +7.872=31.872.

But wait, 3.984 *8.197.

Wait, maybe compute 4 *8.197 =32.788, then subtract 0.016 *8.197 ≈0.131.

So 32.788 -0.131=32.657.

So approx 32.657.

So 3.984 *8.197≈32.657.

So 32.657 *1e9 =3.2657e10 J.

Wait, but the options are in units of 1e10 J. So 3.2657e10 J is 3.2657 when expressed in 1e10 J units.

Looking at the options, option C is 3.26, which is very close. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might make an error in the arithmetic.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.984e17 *8.197e-8 more accurately.

3.984e17 = 3.984 *1e17.

8.197e-8 =8.197 *1e-8.

Multiply them: (3.984 *8.197) *1e(17-8) = (3.984*8.197)*1e9.

Compute 3.984 *8.197.

Let me compute 3 *8 =24, 3*0.197=0.591; 0.984*8=7.872, 0.984*0.197≈0.194.

So 24 +0.591=24.591; 7.872 +0.194=8.066.

24.591 +8.066=32.657.

So 32.657 *1e9 =3.2657e10 J.

Convert to 1e10 J units: 3.2657 → option C is 3.26. So that's the closest.

So the answer should be C:3.26.

To determine the work required to put a 1000-kg satellite into a circular orbit 300 km above Earth's surface, we calculate the change in the satellite's total mechanical energy. The total mechanical energy in a circular orbit is given by:

\[
E = -\frac{G M_e m}{2r}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)), \( M_e \) is Earth's mass (\( 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)), \( m \) is the satellite's mass (\( 1000 \, \text{kg} \)), and \( r \) is the orbital radius, which is Earth's radius (\( R_e = 6.38 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)) plus the altitude (\( 300 \, \text{km} = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{m} \)), so:

\[
r = R_e + h = 6.38 \times 10^6 + 3 \times 10^5 = 6.68 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}.
\]

The initial mechanical energy at Earth's surface is:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = -\frac{G M_e m}{R_e}.
\]

The final mechanical energy in orbit is:

\[
E_{\text{final}} = -\frac{G M_e m}{2r}.
\]

The work done to put the satellite into orbit is the change in mechanical energy:

\[
W = E_{\text{final}} - E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{G M_e m}{R_e} - \frac{G M_e m}{2r}.
\]

Factoring out \( G M_e m \), we get:

\[
W = G M_e m \left( \frac{1}{R_e} - \frac{1}{2r} \right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( G M_e m \)
\[
G M_e m = (6.6743 \times 10^{-11})(5.97 \times 10^{24})(1000) = 3.9845 \times 10^{17} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{1}{R_e} - \frac{1}{2r} \)
\[
\frac{1}{R_e} = \frac{1}{6.38 \times 10^6} \approx 1.568 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}^{-1},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2r} = \frac{1}{2(6.68 \times 10^6)} = \frac{1}{1.336 \times 10^7} \approx 7.483 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]
\[
\frac{1}{R_e} - \frac{1}{2r} = 1.568 \times 10^{-7} - 7.483 \times 10^{-8} = 8.197 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( W \)
\[
W = (3.9845 \times 10^{17})(8.197 \times 10^{-8}) = (3.9845 \times 8.197) \times 10^9.
\]
\[
3.9845 \times 8.197 \approx 32.657,
\]
\[
W \approx 32.657 \times 10^9 = 3.2657 \times 10^{10} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert to the given unit (\( 10^{10} \, \text{J} \))
\[
W \approx 3.2657 \, \text{(in units of \( 10^{10} \, \text{J} \))}.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option is **C: 3.26**.
