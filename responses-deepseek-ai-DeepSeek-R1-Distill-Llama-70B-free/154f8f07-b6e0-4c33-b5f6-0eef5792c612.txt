Okay, so I have this physics problem here about polarized light and crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The problem says a beam of plane polarized light with a wavelength of 6e-5 cm falls normally on a thin quartz crystal. The optic axis is on the surface, which I think means that the light is split into the ordinary and extraordinary rays. Oh right, when light enters a crystal like quartz, which is birefringent, it splits into two components: the O-ray and the E-ray. Each travels with a different refractive index.

The question is asking for the thickness of the crystal where the phase difference between the E and O beams is π radians when they emerge. The options are given from A to J, with various thicknesses in millimeters.

I remember that the phase difference depends on the difference in the optical paths of the two rays. The optical path difference (OPD) is given by (n2 - n1) * d, where d is the thickness. But wait, since the light is traveling through the crystal, each ray has its own refractive index—n_O for the ordinary and n_E for the extraordinary.

So, the phase difference Δφ is (2π/λ) * (n_O - n_E) * d, but wait, no. Wait, the OPD is (n_O * d) and (n_E * d) for each ray. The difference would be (n_O - n_E) * d, right? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Since n_O is 1.544 and n_E is 1.553, n_E is larger. So the E-ray has a higher refractive index than the O-ray. That means the E-ray will travel slower, so its wavelength inside the crystal is shorter, leading to a phase lag.

Wait, the phase difference would be (2π/λ) multiplied by the OPD. So OPD is (n_E - n_O) * d. Because each ray's path is n * d. So the difference is (n_E - n_O)*d. So the phase difference is (2π/λ) * (n_E - n_O) * d.

We want this phase difference to be π radians. So setting up the equation:

(2π/λ) * (n_E - n_O) * d = π.

Let me plug in the numbers. First, let's find n_E - n_O. n_E is 1.553, n_O is 1.544. So 1.553 - 1.544 = 0.009.

So the equation becomes:

(2π / λ) * 0.009 * d = π.

We can cancel out π on both sides, leaving:

2 * 0.009 * d / λ = 1.

Wait, no. Let me write it:

(2π * 0.009 * d) / λ = π.

Divide both sides by π:

(2 * 0.009 * d) / λ = 1.

So 2 * 0.009 * d = λ.

Compute 2 * 0.009: that's 0.018.

So 0.018 * d = λ.

Wait, but wait—what is λ in terms of units? The given λ is 6e-5 cm. Let me convert that to meters for consistency, but wait, maybe I should convert it to whatever units the thickness d will be in. Since the answer options are in mm, perhaps I should express everything in mm.

Wait, 6e-5 cm is 6e-7 meters, which is 0.6 micrometers, but maybe it's easier to convert to mm. Because 1 cm is 10 mm, so 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * 10 mm = 6e-4 mm. So λ = 6e-4 mm.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 1 cm is 10 mm, so 6e-5 cm is 6e-5 * 10 mm = 6e-4 mm. Yes.

So λ is 6e-4 mm.

So back to the equation: 0.018 * d = 6e-4 mm.

Solving for d:

d = (6e-4 mm) / 0.018.

Let me compute that.

6e-4 is 0.0006. 0.0006 / 0.018 = ?

0.0006 divided by 0.018. Hmm, 0.0006 is 6 * 1e-4, and 0.018 is 1.8 * 1e-2.

So (6e-4) / (1.8e-2) ) = (6 / 1.8 ) * (1e-4 / 1e-2 ) = (3.333...) * (1e-2) ) = 0.03333... mm.

So approximately 0.0333 mm.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.033 mm. Option C is 0.032, and G is 0.034, so H looks like the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, I had 0.018 * d = 6e-4 mm.

So d = (6e-4) / 0.018.

Wait, 6e-4 is 0.0006. 0.0006 / 0.018 = ?

Let me compute 0.0006 / 0.018.

Well, 0.018 goes into 0.0006 how many times? Hmm, 0.018 is 18e-3, 0.0006 is 6e-4.

So (6e-4) / (18e-3) ) = (6/18) * (1e-4 / 1e-3 ) = (1/3) * (1e-1) ) = (1/3)*0.1 = 0.033333... So yes, 0.0333 mm, which is 0.033 mm when rounded to three decimal places.

Looking at the options, H is 0.033 mm. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the thickness \( d \) of the quartz crystal that results in a phase difference of \( \pi \) radians between the extraordinary (E) and ordinary (O) beams, we start by analyzing the optical path difference (OPD). The OPD is given by:

\[
\text{OPD} = (n_E - n_O) \cdot d
\]

where \( n_E = 1.553 \) and \( n_O = 1.544 \). The phase difference \( \Delta \phi \) is related to the OPD by:

\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \cdot \text{OPD}
\]

Substituting the OPD:

\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \cdot (n_E - n_O) \cdot d
\]

We are given that \( \Delta \phi = \pi \), so:

\[
\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \cdot (n_E - n_O) \cdot d = \pi
\]

Dividing through by \( \pi \):

\[
\frac{2}{\lambda} \cdot (n_E - n_O) \cdot d = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{\lambda}{2 \cdot (n_E - n_O)}
\]

The wavelength \( \lambda \) is given as \( 6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \), which is equivalent to \( 6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mm} \). Substituting \( \lambda = 6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mm} \) and \( n_E - n_O = 1.553 - 1.544 = 0.009 \):

\[
d = \frac{6 \times 10^{-4}}{2 \cdot 0.009}
\]

\[
d = \frac{6 \times 10^{-4}}{0.018}
\]

\[
d = 0.0333 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the thickness of the crystal is approximately \( 0.033 \, \text{mm} \). Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 0.033 mm**
