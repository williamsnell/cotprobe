Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see, the question says that P(A ∪ B) is 0.76 and P(A ∪ B') is 0.87. I need to find P(A). Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the probability of the union of two events, P(A ∪ B), is given by the formula P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). So that's P(A) + P(B) minus the probability that both A and B happen together.

But wait, in this problem, there are two different unions. The first is A ∪ B, and the second is A ∪ B', where B' is the complement of B. So B' would be all the outcomes where B does not occur.

I think I should write down the two equations based on the given information. Let's assign:

Equation 1: P(A ∪ B) = 0.76
Equation 2: P(A ∪ B') = 0.87

Using the union formula for both, equation 1 becomes:
P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.76

And equation 2, which is A ∪ B', would be:
P(A) + P(B') - P(A ∩ B') = 0.87

Wait, but P(B') is the complement of P(B), so P(B') = 1 - P(B). That's a useful substitution.

So substitute that into equation 2:
P(A) + (1 - P(B)) - P(A ∩ B') = 0.87

Hmm, okay. Now I have two equations. Let me write them again:

1) P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.76
2) P(A) + (1 - P(B)) - P(A ∩ B') = 0.87

I can try to manipulate these equations to solve for P(A). Let's see if adding them would help.

Adding equation 1 and equation 2:

[P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)] + [P(A) + (1 - P(B)) - P(A ∩ B')] = 0.76 + 0.87

Simplify the left side:

P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) + P(A) +1 - P(B) - P(A ∩ B') 

Let's combine like terms:

P(A) + P(A) = 2P(A)
P(B) - P(B) cancels out, so 0.
Then we have 1, and then the two terms with intersections.

So, 2P(A) + 1 - P(A ∩ B) - P(A ∩ B') = 1.63 (since 0.76 + 0.87 is 1.63)

Hmm, that gives me 2P(A) + 1 - [P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B')] = 1.63

Wait, but P(A ∩ B) and P(A ∩ B') are both probabilities, and since B and B' are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, A can happen when B happens or when B doesn't. So, P(A) can be broken into P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B') because these two are mutually exclusive. So, P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B').

So, substituting that into the equation, the sum [P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ B')] is just P(A). So now the equation becomes:

2P(A) + 1 - P(A) = 1.63

Simplify that:

2P(A) +1 - P(A) = P(A) + 1 = 1.63

So, P(A) + 1 = 1.63 → P(A) = 1.63 -1 = 0.63

Wait, that would make P(A) 0.63, which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

We had two equations:

1) P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B) = 0.76
2) P(A) + (1 - P(B)) - P(A ∩ B') = 0.87

Adding them gives 2P(A) +1 - [P(A∩B) + P(A∩B')] = 1.63

But since P(A∩B) + P(A∩B') = P(A), because for any event A, it can occur when B happens or when B doesn't. So their sum is indeed P(A).

So substituting that in, 2P(A) +1 - P(A) = P(A) +1 = 1.63 → P(A)=0.63.

So the correct answer should be 0.63, which is option H.

To solve the problem, we start with the given probabilities:

1. \( P(A \cup B) = 0.76 \)
2. \( P(A \cup B') = 0.87 \)

Using the formula for the probability of a union, \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \), we can write:

1. \( P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.76 \)
2. \( P(A) + P(B') - P(A \cap B') = 0.87 \)

Since \( P(B') = 1 - P(B) \), substitute this into the second equation:

2. \( P(A) + (1 - P(B)) - P(A \cap B') = 0.87 \)

Now we have two equations:

1. \( P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.76 \)
2. \( P(A) + (1 - P(B)) - P(A \cap B') = 0.87 \)

Adding these two equations:

\[
[P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)] + [P(A) + (1 - P(B)) - P(A \cap B')] = 0.76 + 0.87
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:

\[
P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) + P(A) + 1 - P(B) - P(A \cap B')
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
2P(A) + 1 - [P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B')] = 1.63
\]

Since \( P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B') = P(A) \) (because \( A \) can occur when \( B \) happens or when \( B \) does not), substitute this into the equation:

\[
2P(A) + 1 - P(A) = 1.63
\]

Simplify:

\[
P(A) + 1 = 1.63
\]

Solve for \( P(A) \):

\[
P(A) = 1.63 - 1 = 0.63
\]

Thus, the probability \( P(A) \) is 0.63, which corresponds to option **H**.
