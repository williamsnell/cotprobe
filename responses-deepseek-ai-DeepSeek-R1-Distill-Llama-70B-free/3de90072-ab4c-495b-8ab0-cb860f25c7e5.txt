Okay, so I've got this question about Nelson's Cycle Shop and their inventory. Hmm, I need to figure out the final inventory after considering the initial stock, purchases, sales, and the margin. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the initial inventory on January 1st is $30,156. During the month, they bought new merchandise totaling $28,300. So the total goods available for sale would be the initial inventory plus the new purchases. Let me calculate that. 30,156 plus 28,300 equals... let's see, 30k plus 28k is 58k, and then 156 plus 300 is 456. So total is $58,456 available for sale.

Now, the sales for the month were $72,600. But the margin on sales was 45%. Wait, margin is usually calculated as (sales - cost) / sales, right? Or is it something else here. Oh wait, the margin is the gross profit margin. So the margin of 45% means that for every dollar sold, 45 cents is profit, and 55 cents is cost. So the cost of goods sold (COGS) would be 55% of the sales.

Let me compute the COGS. Sales are $72,600, so COGS is 72,600 multiplied by 0.55. Let me calculate that. 72,600 * 0.5 is 36,300, and 72,600 * 0.05 is 3,630. Adding those together, 36,300 + 3,630 is 39,930. So COGS is $39,930.

Wait, but COGS can't be more than the goods available for sale, can it? Because you can't sell more than you have. Let me check the numbers again. Goods available are $58,456. COGS is $39,930, which is less than that, so it's fine.

Now, to find the ending inventory, I think we subtract COGS from the goods available. So, 58,456 minus 39,930 equals... let me do the math. 58,456 - 39,930. 58k minus 39k is 19k, but wait, 58,456 minus 39,930 is actually 18,526. So the ending inventory should be $18,526.

Looking at the options, option G is $18,526. So the answer should be G.

To estimate the final inventory for Nelson's Cycle Shop, we start with the initial inventory of $30,156 and add the new merchandise purchases of $28,300, giving total goods available for sale of $58,456.

Sales for the month were $72,600, with a gross profit margin of 45%. This means the cost of goods sold (COGS) is 55% of sales. Calculating COGS:  
$72,600 * 0.55 = $39,930.

The final inventory is the goods available for sale minus COGS:  
$58,456 - $39,930 = $18,526.

Thus, the final inventory is $18,526, which corresponds to option G.

G: $18,526

Answer: G
