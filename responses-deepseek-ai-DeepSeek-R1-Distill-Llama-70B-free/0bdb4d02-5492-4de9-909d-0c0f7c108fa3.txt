Okay, so I have this problem about an invoice payment, and I need to figure out how much was paid. Let's see what the question says.

The invoice is dated March 2nd for $416.50. There are deductions: 15% and 2.5%. The terms are 2% 10-EOM, and the payment was made on April 10th. Hmm, I need to calculate the amount remitted.

First, I think I should understand the discounts here. There are two deductions mentioned: 15% and 2.5%. Wait, are these both discounts, or is one a discount and the other something else? The problem says "less 15% and 2(1/2)%", so probably both are discounts subtracted from the invoice amount.

So the total discount would be 15% + 2.5% = 17.5%. Let me calculate that. 17.5% of $416.50. Hmm, 416.50 * 0.175. Let me compute that. 416.50 * 0.1 is 41.65, 0.07 is 29.155, 0.005 is 2.0825. Adding those: 41.65 + 29.155 is 70.805, plus 2.0825 is 72.8875. So about $72.8875 discount. Subtracting that from the invoice amount: 416.50 - 72.8875 = $343.6125. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because sometimes in business, the order of discounts matters, but I think here it's just adding up the percentages since both are subtracted.

Wait, but then there's also the terms: 2% 10-EOM. I need to remember what that means. EOM stands for End of Month, right? So 2% discount if paid within 10 days after the end of the month. Wait, but the invoice is March 2nd. So the EOM would be March 31st. So the 10 days would be up to April 10th. Oh, wait, the payment was made on April 10th, which is exactly the last day for the discount. So they qualify for the 2% discount.

Wait, but wait a minute. The initial discounts are 15% and 2.5%, which sum to 17.5%, and then there's an additional 2% discount for timely payment under the EOM terms. How does that work? Or are the 15% and 2.5% part of the same terms?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as: the invoice amount is $416.50, and there are two separate deductions—15% and 2.5%—and then the payment terms offer an additional 2% if paid by 10th of the next month.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

First, the invoice amount: $416.50.

Subtract 15%: 416.50 * 0.15 = let me compute that. 400*0.15 is 60, 16.50*0.15 is 2.475, so total 62.475. So 416.50 - 62.475 = $354.025.

Then subtract 2.5%: 354.025 * 0.025. Let me calculate that. 350 *0.025 is 8.75, 4.025 *0.025 is about 0.100625. So total 8.75 + 0.100625 ≈ 8.850625. So subtract that from 354.025, which gives 354.025 - 8.850625 = $345.174375.

Now, the terms are 2% 10-EOM. So if payment is made by April 10th, which it was, they get an additional 2% discount on the adjusted amount. So calculate 2% of $345.174375.

2% is 0.02. So 345.174375 * 0.02 = 6.9034875. So the discount is $6.9034875. Subtract that from the current amount: 345.174375 - 6.9034875 = $338.2708875. 

Looking at the options, option E is $338.27, which matches this. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I applied the discounts in the wrong order. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the 15% and 2.5% are applied first to the original amount, then the 2% discount is applied on the result.

Wait, that's what I did. So 416.50 less 15% and 2.5% gives 416.50*(1 - 0.15 - 0.025) = 416.50 * 0.825 = let me compute that. 416.50 * 0.8 is 333.2, 416.50 * 0.025 is 10.4125, so 333.2 + 10.4125 = 343.6125. Then, the 2% discount on 343.6125 is 6.87225, so 343.6125 - 6.87225 = 336.74025. Hmm, that's different. Wait, no, perhaps that approach is wrong because the 2% is applied after the initial discounts. Wait, but that's what I did earlier, which gave me $338.27.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 2% is applied to the amount after the two discounts. Let me verify.

Another way: The initial amount is $416.50. Two discounts: 15% and 2.5%, so total 17.5%. So 416.50 * (1 - 0.175) = 416.50 * 0.825 = 343.6125.

Then, apply the 2% discount because payment was made by April 10th, which is within the 10-EOM terms. So 343.6125 * 0.98 = 343.6125 * (1 - 0.02) = 343.6125 - (343.6125 * 0.02).

Compute 343.6125 * 0.02: 6.87225. So subtract that: 343.6125 - 6.87225 = 336.74025. Wait, that's about $336.74, which isn't one of the options. Hmmm. But earlier I got $338.27 when I applied the discounts differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the discounts in sequence. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the 15% and 2.5% are applied to the original amount, and then the 2% discount is applied to that result.

So original amount: 416.50.

After 15% discount: 416.50 * 0.85 = 354.025.

After 2.5% discount: 354.025 * 0.975 = Let's compute that. 354.025 * 0.975. 354.025 * 1 is 354.025, minus 354.025 * 0.025. 354.025 * 0.025 is 8.850625. So 354.025 - 8.850625 = 345.174375.

Then, apply the 2% discount for the EOM terms: 345.174375 * 0.98 = 345.174375 - (345.174375 * 0.02). 345.174375 * 0.02 is 6.9034875. So 345.174375 - 6.9034875 = 338.2708875, which is approximately $338.27, which is option E.

So why does the other approach give a different answer? Because when I applied 17.5% first, then 2%, it gave me a different result. But perhaps the correct approach is to apply each discount step by step, as they are separate discounts, rather than summing the percentages. So perhaps the correct way is to apply the 15%, then the 2.5%, then the 2%. So that would give $338.27.

Looking at the options, E is $338.27, which matches this. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the amount remitted in payment, we start with the invoice amount of $416.50 and apply the discounts step by step:

1. **Apply the 15% discount**:  
   \[
   416.50 \times (1 - 0.15) = 416.50 \times 0.85 = 354.025
   \]

2. **Apply the 2.5% discount**:  
   \[
   354.025 \times (1 - 0.025) = 354.025 \times 0.975 = 345.174375
   \]

3. **Apply the 2% EOM discount** (since payment was made by April 10, the last day to qualify for the discount):  
   \[
   345.174375 \times (1 - 0.02) = 345.174375 \times 0.98 = 338.2708875
   \]

Thus, the amount remitted in payment is approximately **$338.27**, which corresponds to option **E**.
