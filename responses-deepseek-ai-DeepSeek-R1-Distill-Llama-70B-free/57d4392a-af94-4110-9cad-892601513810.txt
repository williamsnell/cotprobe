During her testimony, the victim recounted the incident and described how the defendant savagely beat her with a baseball bat. She was not asked by the prosecution whether she made any statements during the attack. After the victim was excused and left the witness stand, the prosecution called another witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this. "Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's proffered testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a statement of then existing condition.
B: inadmissible, because it is a statement of opinion rather than fact.

D: inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused.
E: admissible as a present sense impression.
F: inadmissible because the witness was not present during the attack.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

The scenario is a trial where the defendant is accused of attempted murder. The prosecution called the victim to testify, and she described being beaten with a baseball bat. The prosecution didn't ask her if she made any statements during the attack. Then, after the victim left the stand, the prosecution called another witness who wants to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this." The defense objects, and we need to figure out if this testimony is admissible.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the victim's statement here is being offered to prove that the defendant did it, I think. But there are exceptions to the hearsay rule.

Looking at the options, let's consider each possible exception.

Option A: Statement of then existing condition. That's under FRE 803(3), right? It covers statements showing the declarant's then state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. But wait, the part about "Don't let the defendant get away" sounds more like a statement about a past event or an accusation, not just the physical condition. So maybe this isn't the right fit.

Option E: Present sense impression. That's someone describing an event while perceiving it or immediately after. The statement was made when the beating stopped, which is right after the event. But the content is a scream, which includes an accusation. Present sense impression usually covers descriptions of the event, not necessarily accusatory statements. So maybe E isn't the best fit either.

Option G: Excited utterance. FRE 803(2) says a statement made under the stress of a startling event and relating to the event. The victim was just beaten and screamed, so she was under stress. The statement relates to the event. But I remember that excited utterances can include statements that are more than just descriptions, like identifications or accusations, as long as they're made in the stress of the moment. So this could fit.

Option H says it's inadmissible as hearsay without exception. So if none of the exceptions apply, H would be correct. But I think one of the exceptions should apply here.

Option I: Statement against interest. That's when the declarant's statement is against their own interest. Here, the victim is accusing the defendant, which isn't against her interest. So I doesn't apply.

Option D: Victim wasn't questioned about the statement before being excused. I don't think that affects the admissibility of the statement through another witness. The issue is whether the statement itself is hearsay and falls under an exception, not whether the victim was asked about it.

Option F: Witness not present during the attack. But the witness is testifying about what the victim said after the attack, so their presence during the attack isn't necessary. So F isn't the issue.

Option B: Opinion vs fact. The statement is a statement of fact, not opinion, so B isn't correct.

Option C: Victim didn't make the statement under oath. But whether a statement was under oath doesn't determine hearsay admissibility. Hearsay exceptions don't require the statement to be under oath. So C isn't the issue.

Putting it all together: the statement is an excited utterance because it was made immediately after the beating while the victim was under the stress of the event. So the correct exception would be G, excited utterance, making it admissible.

The statement made by the victim, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this," is being offered as evidence. To determine its admissibility, it is necessary to analyze whether it falls under a recognized hearsay exception.

- **Option A**: The statement does not qualify as a "statement of then existing condition" under FRE 803(3) because it includes an accusatory statement ("Don't let the defendant get away with this") that goes beyond describing the victim's physical or emotional state.
  
- **Option E**: While the statement was made immediately after the event, it is more than a "present sense impression" under FRE 803(1), as it includes an accusation, which is not typical of this exception.

- **Option G**: The statement qualifies as an "excited utterance" under FRE 803(2). It was made while the victim was under the stress of the startling event (the beating) and relates to the event itself. Excited utterances can include accusatory statements if made in the heat of the moment.

- **Option H**: This option is incorrect because the statement falls under the excited utterance exception, making it admissible.

- **Option I**: The statement is not against the victim's interest, so this exception does not apply.

- **Option D**: Whether the victim was questioned about the statement is irrelevant to the admissibility of the statement through another witness.

- **Option F**: The witness's presence during the attack is not required, as the testimony concerns the victim's statement after the attack.

- **Option B**: The statement is a factual assertion, not an opinion.

- **Option C**: The statement's admissibility does not depend on whether it was made under oath.

The correct analysis is that the statement is admissible as an excited utterance under FRE 803(2).
