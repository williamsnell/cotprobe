Question:

Rainbow Corporation has outstanding 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred. The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: The proposal is invalidly approved because a unanimous vote from both classes is required.
B: The proposal is validly approved because the nonvoting preferred stock does not count towards the vote.
C: The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.
D: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.
E: The proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have the majority vote.
F: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because the proposal affects the common stock.
G: The proposal is validly approved because the preferred stockholders who voted in favor have a liquidation preference.
H: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the outstanding shares did not approve.
I: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.
J: The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.

Okay, so I've got this question about corporate governance and shareholders' voting rights. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

The question is about Rainbow Corporation. They have 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. The preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share plus a 3% noncumulative dividend. Now, the company is submitting a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that come ahead of the old preferred stock.

At the shareholders' meeting, 700 common shareholders voted in favor, and 400 preferred did too. The question is about which statement is correct regarding the approval of this proposal.

The options are A through J, each making different claims about the validity of the approval based on the voting.

I remember that when it comes to amendments to the corporate charter, like creating a new class of stock, the rules can be a bit tricky. Normally, such changes require a vote of the shareholders, but the exact requirements depend on the circumstances.

So, first, the existing preferred stock is nonvoting. Nonvoting preferred typically doesn't have the right to vote on most matters, except perhaps when their specific rights are affected. But wait, in this case, the company is proposing a new class of preferred stock that has better redemption rights. That might affect the existing preferred shareholders because the new class would come before them in liquidation. So their interests are impacted.

Under corporate law, when a corporation wants to issue a new class of stock that affects the existing classes, especially in a way that could dilute their rights, those existing shareholders might have a right to vote on the matter. This is often governed by the concept of "class voting." Class voting means that each class of stock votes separately on matters that particularly affect their rights.

In this scenario, the new preferred stock would have redemption rights that come ahead of the old preferred. So this could impact the existing preferred stockholders because in a liquidation scenario, the new preferred would be paid before the old. Hence, the old preferred's liquidation preference is being altered, or at least their priority is being changed. That sounds like a change that affects their rights as a class.

So, for such changes, the corporation's articles of incorporation (or charter) might require that the affected class approve the change. Alternatively, state law might require it. Typically, when a proposed amendment affects a particular class of stock, that class must vote on it, and perhaps a majority (or sometimes two-thirds) of that class must approve.

Wait, but in this case, the existing preferred stock is nonvoting. Does that mean they can't vote on this matter? Or does the fact that their rights are being affected override their usual nonvoting status?

I think the key point is that even if the preferred stock is normally nonvoting, when their specific rights are being altered, they might get the right to vote on that particular issue. So, in this case, since the proposal affects their liquidation preference (by creating a class that comes before them), the nonvoting preferred stockholders would have the right to vote on this proposal.

So both the common and preferred stockholders would need to approve the proposal. But the question is, what's the required vote? Usually, when a class vote is required, it's a majority of that class. So, for the preferred stock, approval would require a majority of their outstanding shares. Similarly, for the common stock, it's typically a majority vote.

Looking at the votes: 700 common shares voted yes out of 1,000, which is 70%â€”so that's a majority. But for the preferred, 400 out of 1,000 voted yes. That's 40%, which is not a majority. So, if both classes need to approve, and the preferred only got 40% in favor, the proposal wouldn't be approved.

Wait, but is a majority of each class required, or is it a different threshold? The question doesn't specify, but generally, when a class is entitled to vote on a matter, it's a majority of that class's votes. So if the preferred class only got 40% in favor, they didn't approve it.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says the proposal is invalid because a unanimous vote from both classes is required. Unanimous seems too strict. I don't think that's the case unless the corporate charter requires it, which isn't indicated here.

Option B says it's valid because nonvoting preferred doesn't count. But wait, in this case, because their rights are affected, they do get to vote, so B is incorrect.

Option C claims it's invalid because a two-thirds vote of each class is needed. But I thought it's a majority unless stated otherwise. Unless the state law requires a higher threshold. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify whether a higher vote is needed. So perhaps the default is majority.

Option D says the preferred vote doesn't matter because they're nonvoting. But that's not correct because their rights are affected, so they do get to vote on this specific issue.

Option E says it's approved because common has majority. But if the preferred also needs to approve, and they didn't, then it's not valid. So E is incorrect.

Option F: preferred vote doesn't matter because the proposal affects common. No, the proposal affects both, as it's about a new preferred class that affects the old preferred's rights.

Option G: Valid because preferred who voted have liquidation preference. Not sure about this. The approval isn't about their current rights but whether the class as a whole approves.

Option H: Invalid because majority of outstanding shares didn't approve. Wait, the total shares are 2000. 700 +400=1100 voted yes, which is 55% of 2000. So majority did approve overall, but if each class needs a majority, then H is incorrect because it's about overall shares, not per class.

Option I: Invalid because majority of preferred didn't approve. Yes, because the preferred only had 400 votes (40%) in favor. So if their class needed a majority, then I is correct.

Option J: Valid because overall majority approved. But if each class needs a majority, then the overall doesn't matter. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be I: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.

The question revolves around whether Rainbow Corporation's proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that come ahead of the old preferred stock is validly approved. The corporation has 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. The proposal received 700 votes in favor from common shareholders and 400 votes in favor from preferred shareholders.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Voting Rights of Nonvoting Preferred Stock**: Although the preferred stock is nonvoting, its rights are directly affected by the proposal, as the new class of preferred stock would have higher redemption priority. This entitles the existing preferred shareholders to vote on the matter under the principle of class voting.

2. **Required Vote for Approval**: When a proposal affects the rights of a specific class of stock, approval typically requires a majority vote from that class. Therefore, both the common and preferred shareholders must approve the proposal, with each class voting separately.

3. **Analysis of Votes**:
   - Common shareholders: 700 out of 1,000 voted in favor, which is a majority (70%).
   - Preferred shareholders: 400 out of 1,000 voted in favor, which is not a majority (40%).

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Unanimous approval is not required unless specified by the corporate charter or state law, which is not indicated here.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Nonvoting preferred stockholders are entitled to vote on this proposal because their rights are directly affected.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. A two-thirds vote is not required unless specified, and the default threshold is a majority.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The preferred shareholders' votes do matter because their rights are affected.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. While the common shareholders approved the proposal, the preferred shareholders did not, and their approval is also required.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The proposal affects both classes of stock, not just the common stock.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The validity of the proposal depends on the majority vote of each class, not the liquidation preference of individual shareholders.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The overall majority of outstanding shares (55%) is irrelevant if each class must approve the proposal.
   - **Option I**: Correct. The proposal is invalid because the preferred shareholders did not approve it with a majority vote (only 40% voted in favor).
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. Overall majority approval does not supersede the requirement for each class to approve the proposal.

**Conclusion**: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve it.
