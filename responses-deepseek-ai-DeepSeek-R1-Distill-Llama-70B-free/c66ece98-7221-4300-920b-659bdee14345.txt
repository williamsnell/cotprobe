Question:

How is the federal payroll tax that supports the Social Security program a regressive tax?

Options:

A: The tax is regressive because only self-employed individuals are required to pay it.
B: The tax is regressive because all workers pay the same percentage of their income.
C: The tax is regressive because higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate.
D: The tax is regressive because it only applies to the first $10,000 of income.
E: The tax is regressive because it exempts all investment income.
F: The tax is regressive because it includes additional deductions for higher income earners.
G: The tax is regressive because there is a dollar limit on the amount of income, subject to the tax.
H: The tax is regressive because lower incomes are not taxed to provide relief to lower earners.
I: The tax is regressive because it is only applied to non-wage forms of income.
J: The tax is regressive because it is a flat tax that takes a smaller proportion of income as the income rises.

Okay, so I need to figure out why the federal payroll tax for Social Security is considered regressive. Hmm, I remember that regressive taxes are those where lower-income individuals pay a larger proportion of their income compared to higher-income earners. So, the question is asking how the payroll tax fits into that.

I think the payroll tax is a flat tax, meaning everyone pays the same rate. Wait, but that would be proportional, right? But I remember something about a cap on income that's taxed. Oh right, there's a maximum income level beyond which you don't pay Social Security taxes. So, for example, if the cap is $160k or something, people earning more than that don't pay the tax on the amount above the cap.

So, how does this make it regressive? Well, let's say someone makes $200k. They only pay the tax on the first $160k. The percentage of their total income that goes to Social Security is lower than someone making, say, $50k, because the $50k person pays on all their income. So, the higher earner pays a smaller proportion. That makes it regressive because the tax burden is lower for higher incomes.

Looking at the options, option G says it's regressive because there's a dollar limit on income subject to tax. That sounds right because beyond that limit, higher earners don't contribute, so they pay a smaller percentage.

Wait, option J says it's a flat tax that takes a smaller proportion as income rises. That also makes sense. Because flat tax would mean same rate, but since the cap exists, higher income individuals effectively pay less as a percentage. So, J is also a possible correct answer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. A flat tax is proportional if applied to all income. But when only a portion is taxed, it becomes regressive. So, the key is the cap. So option G says there's a dollar limit, making higher earners pay less proportionally. Option J says it's a flat tax that takes smaller proportion as income rises. Both are correct explanations.

Wait, the question is asking why it's regressive. So the reason is that the tax applies only up to a certain income level. So the correct answer is G or J. Hmm.

Wait, the flat tax aspect is the same rate, but because of the cap, it's effectively regressive. So is it the flat tax or the cap that causes regressivity? I think the cap is the main reason. So the tax is applied only to the first X dollars, so higher earners have a lower effective rate.

So the correct answer would be G: The tax is regressive because there is a dollar limit on the amount of income subject to the tax.

Alternatively, option J says it's a flat tax that takes a smaller proportion as income rises. That also explains it. So maybe J is correct.

Wait, the definition of regressive is that the tax rate decreases as income increases. So, when you have a flat tax with a cap, higher earners have a lower effective rate. So option J is saying it's a flat tax that takes a smaller proportion as income rises, which is correct.

But I'm a bit torn because both G and J seem relevant. Let me look at the options again.

Option G: ...dollar limit on income subject to tax. So, it's about the cap.

Option J: It's a flat tax that takes smaller proportion as income rises.

Which one is more accurate as the reason for regressivity?

I think the key is that the tax is regressive because higher income people pay a smaller percentage. So the structure is a flat rate, but due to the cap, it's regressive. So the reason is the cap, which is option G.

Wait, but option J is also correct because it explains that as income rises, the proportion paid decreases. So both G and J are correct, but which is the better answer.

Wait, the question is "how is it regressive." So the reason is that beyond a certain point, you don't pay. So G seems to directly point to the cap. J is more about the effect of the flat tax with cap.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, I think the correct answer is G. Because the existence of a cap (dollar limit) makes the tax regressive. Without the cap, a flat tax would be proportional, not regressive.

So the answer should be G.

The federal payroll tax supporting Social Security is regressive because it includes a dollar limit on the income subject to the tax. This means that higher-income earners are only taxed on the portion of their income up to this cap, resulting in a smaller proportion of their total income being taxed compared to lower-income earners. This structure makes the tax regressive.

Answer: G
