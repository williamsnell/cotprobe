Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy when moving charges. Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have two charges, q1 is +4 statC and q2 is... wait, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Oh, I think it's saying q2 is -6 statC because there's a line in the middle. So q1 is positive, q2 is negative. They start at a separation of r1 = 3 cm and then move to r2 = 8 cm. We need to find the change in potential energy when they're moved apart.

Wait, electric potential energy... right, the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * q1 * q2 / r. Oh wait, but wait—what are the units here? The charges are in statC, which is the esu unit. I remember that in the CGS system, the constant k is 1, but let me double-check that. Oh right, in CGS, Coulomb's law uses k = 1, so the potential energy formula simplifies a bit.

So since the charges are in statC and the distance is in cm, everything should work out without needing to convert units, I think. So the initial potential energy U1 is k*(q1*q2)/r1. But since k is 1 in CGS units, it's just (4 * (-6)) / 3 cm. Wait, but wait—hold on, the distance in the denominator is in cm, but does that matter? Because in CGS, the distance is in cm, right? So yes, we can proceed.

Let me compute U1 first. q1 is +4, q2 is -6. So 4 * (-6) is -24. Divided by r1, which is 3 cm. So U1 = (-24) / 3 = -8 ergs? Because in CGS, the unit for potential energy is erg. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me make sure about the units.

Wait, the formula in CGS is U = (q1 * q2) / r, and the unit is erg. So yeah, U1 is -8 ergs.

Then, when the separation increases to 8 cm, the new potential energy U2 is (4 * (-6)) / 8. Let's compute that. 4*(-6) is -24, divided by 8 is -3 ergs.

So the change in potential energy is U2 - U1. So that's (-3) - (-8) = (-3) +8 = +5 ergs. Wait, so the change is positive 5 ergs.

But wait, I should think about the sign. Wait, the charges are opposite, so initially when they're close, the potential energy is negative because opposite charges attract, right? So moving them apart would require doing work against the attractive force. So the potential energy should increase, becoming less negative, which means the change is positive.

Wait, U1 is -8 ergs, U2 is -3. So the change is ΔU = U2 - U1 = (-3) - (-8) = +5 ergs. So the potential energy increases by 5 ergs.

Looking at the options, option J is +5 ergs. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Another way to think about it: when you have opposite charges, bringing them closer decreases potential energy (more negative), and moving them apart increases it (less negative). So in this case, moving from 3 cm to 8 cm, which is farther apart, the potential energy becomes less negative, so the change is positive.

Yes, that makes sense. So the change is +5 ergs, which is option J.

To determine the change in potential energy when the separation between two charges, \( q_1 = +4 \, \text{statC} \) and \( q_2 = -6 \, \text{statC} \), is increased from \( r_1 = 3 \, \text{cm} \) to \( r_2 = 8 \, \text{cm} \), we use the formula for electric potential energy:

\[
U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
\]

In the CGS system, \( k = 1 \), so the formula simplifies to:

\[
U = \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the initial potential energy (\( U_1 \))
\[
U_1 = \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r_1} = \frac{(+4) \cdot (-6)}{3} = \frac{-24}{3} = -8 \, \text{ergs}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the final potential energy (\( U_2 \))
\[
U_2 = \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r_2} = \frac{(+4) \cdot (-6)}{8} = \frac{-24}{8} = -3 \, \text{ergs}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the change in potential energy (\( \Delta U \))
\[
\Delta U = U_2 - U_1 = (-3) - (-8) = -3 + 8 = +5 \, \text{ergs}
\]

The change in potential energy is \( +5 \, \text{ergs} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
