Okay, so I have this problem where Mary Redmond bought a home for $28,500. She put down 20% as a down payment, and the rest is to be paid over 10 years in monthly payments. Additionally, there's a financing charge of 7% per year on the unpaid balance added to each monthly payment. I need to calculate the total payment due for the first month.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. First, the down payment is 20% of the home price. So I should calculate that. 20% of $28,500 is 0.2 * 28,500. Let me do that math: 28,500 times 0.2 is 5,700. So the down payment is $5,700.

That leaves the remaining amount to be financed. The total price was $28,500, so subtracting the down payment, the amount financed is 28,500 - 5,700 = $22,800.

Now, this $22,800 is to be paid over 10 years. Since it's monthly payments, I should figure out how many months that is. 10 years times 12 months each year gives 120 months.

But wait, there's also a financing charge of 7% per year on the unpaid balance. Oh right, that's an annual interest rate. So each month, the interest would be a portion of that. Let me think, 7% per year divided by 12 months, so that's approximately 0.583333% per month.

So the way this works is that each monthly payment will have both principal and interest. But since this is the first payment, the interest for the first month will be calculated on the initial unpaid balance, which is $22,800.

So the interest for the first month is 7% annually on $22,800. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the 7% is the annual rate, so the monthly interest rate is 7/12 percent. Let me calculate that: 7 divided by 12 is approximately 0.583333% per month.

So the interest for the first month is $22,800 multiplied by 0.007/12, wait no, wait. Wait, no, the 7% is an annual rate. So per month, it's 7% divided by 12. So 0.07 /12 is approximately 0.0058333 (or 0.583333% as a decimal).

So the interest part of the first payment is 22,800 * (0.07/12). Let me calculate that. 22,800 times 0.07 is 1,596. Then divide by 12: 1,596 /12 = 133. So the interest part is $133.

Wait, but wait a second. That's just the interest part. But the problem says that the financing charge is added to each monthly payment. So the total payment would be the interest plus the principal part for that month.

But wait, am I supposed to calculate the monthly payment (the principal and interest) and then add the interest again? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that the balance is to be paid by monthly payments over 10 years, and in addition, a financing charge of 7% per year of the unpaid balance is to be added to each monthly payment. Oh wait, that might be a bit different.

So perhaps the monthly payment is calculated as the principal payment, and then each month, an interest charge of (7% per annum /12) * unpaid balance is added as a finance charge.

Wait, so the monthly payment consists of two parts: the principal part, which is the amount applied to reduce the debt, and the interest charge on the current unpaid balance.

Wait, but that's similar to an amortizing loan. So perhaps I need to calculate the monthly payment as the principal plus interest each month.

Wait, but in an amortizing loan, each payment is part principal and part interest. The total payment remains the same each month, with the early payments having more interest and less principal, and later payments more principal and less interest.

But the way the question is phrased, perhaps the monthly payment is just the principal part, and then each month, they add the interest charge as an extra. Hmm, but that's not how it's usually done. Alternatively, perhaps the 7% per annum is the annual interest rate on the unpaid balance, which is then added each month as part of the payment.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to model it.

The total amount financed is $22,800. The term is 120 months. The annual interest rate is 7%, so the monthly interest rate is 7% /12, which is approximately 0.00583333.

In a typical amortizing loan, the monthly payment (P) can be calculated using the formula:

P = (Pv * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where Pv is the present value (loan amount), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

So plugging in the numbers: Pv = 22,800, r = 0.07/12 = 0.00583333, n = 120.

So P = (22,800 * 0.00583333) / (1 - (1 + 0.00583333)^-120)

Let me compute the denominator first: (1 + 0.00583333)^120. I think that's approximately e^(0.00583333*120) but more accurately, I should compute it step by step. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the monthly payment (P) as the amount that when paid each month for 120 months will pay off the loan with interest.

But wait, perhaps in this problem, the way it's worded, the 7% is added as a finance charge on the unpaid balance each month. So each month, you pay the interest on the current balance plus some principal.

So perhaps the first payment is the interest on the initial balance plus the principal. But wait, the question is asking for the total payment due for the first month, which would include both the principal and the interest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not an amortizing loan, but rather that each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance, and the payment is the principal plus that interest. Wait, but that would mean that each month's payment is principal plus interest, but the principal part would vary.

Alternatively, maybe the 7% is added each month on the unpaid balance, so each month's payment includes the interest for that month plus the principal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each month, the borrower pays the interest accrued that month, and also pays down some principal. So the total payment would be the interest for the month plus the principal payment.

Wait, but in this case, the first month's payment would be the interest on $22,800 for one month (which is 7% annual /12 * 22,800) plus whatever the principal is.

Wait, but then how is the principal determined? Because the total payments over 10 years would have to sum up to the principal plus interest. But perhaps the problem is that each month, you pay the interest on the current balance, and then the rest goes to principal. So the principal payment each month would be the same, but the interest would decrease as the balance decreases.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, the down payment is $5,700. The financed amount is $22,800.

The monthly payment has two parts: interest and principal. The interest is calculated on the outstanding balance each month.

In the first month, the outstanding balance is $22,800. The interest for the first month is (7% /12) *22,800 = (0.07/12)*22,800.

Calculating that: 0.07 *22,800 = 1,596. Divide by 12: 1,596 /12 = 133. So the interest is $133.

Now, the principal part would be the rest of the payment. But wait, how much is the total payment? Because the problem says the balance is to be paid over 10 years, so the principal payments each month would be 22,800 divided by 120 months, which is 190 per month.

So the principal part each month is $190. Then, the interest in the first month is $133, so the total payment would be 133 + 190 = 323.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is $323. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. So each month, the principal payment is $190, and the interest is calculated on the remaining balance. So first month: interest $133, principal $190, total $323.

Yes, that makes sense. So the first month's payment is $323, which would be option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 7% per annum as a simple interest, and each month, they add that to the payment. So perhaps the total payment is the principal plus the monthly interest. So the principal is 22,800 /120 = $190, and the interest is (7% of 22,800)/12 = 133. So total 323.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be F.

Mary Redmond purchased a home for $28,500 with a 20% down payment, leaving a financed amount of $22,800. This amount is to be paid over 10 years (120 months) with a 7% annual financing charge on the unpaid balance added to each monthly payment.

1. **Down Payment Calculation**:  
   The down payment is 20% of $28,500:  
   \[
   0.2 \times 28,500 = 5,700
   \]  
   The remaining balance to be financed is:  
   \[
   28,500 - 5,700 = 22,800
   \]

2. **Interest Calculation for the First Month**:  
   The annual interest rate is 7%, so the monthly interest rate is:  
   \[
   \frac{0.07}{12} \approx 0.00583333
   \]  
   The interest for the first month is calculated on the initial balance of $22,800:  
   \[
   22,800 \times 0.00583333 \approx 133
   \]

3. **Principal Payment for the First Month**:  
   The total financed amount of $22,800 is to be paid over 120 months, so the principal payment each month is:  
   \[
   \frac{22,800}{120} = 190
   \]

4. **Total Payment for the First Month**:  
   The total payment is the sum of the interest and the principal:  
   \[
   133 + 190 = 323
   \]

Thus, the total payment due for the first month is **$323**, which corresponds to option **F**.
