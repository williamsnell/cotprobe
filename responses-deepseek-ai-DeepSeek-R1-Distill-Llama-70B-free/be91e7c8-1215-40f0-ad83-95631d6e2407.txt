Question:

A grantor conveyed her mansion and surrounding property to her nephew "for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs. " Two years later, the nephew entered into a real estate agreement for the sale of the property to his brother, whereby the nephew agreed to convey the premises to the brother in fee simple absolute. Prior to the settlement date, the brother contacted the nephew, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the nephew could not convey a fee simple. The Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished by statute in this jurisdiction. Thus, the nephew's prayer for specific performance would be

Options:

A: denied, because the remainder to the nephew's heirs is a contingent interest.
B: granted, because the nephew has the right to sell his life estate.
C: denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.
D: denied, because the nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer a fee simple absolute.
E: denied, because the Rule would not be triggered, thus creating only a life estate in the nephew.
F: granted, because the nephew's life estate combined with his vested remainder gives him a fee simple.
G: denied, because under the Doctrine of Worthier Title, at the termination of the nephew's life estate, the grantor has a reversionary interest.
H: granted, because the nephew's heirs receive a vested indefeasible interest in the property.
I: granted, because the nephew has a vested remainder in fee simple absolute.
J: granted, because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my property concepts, but I'll try my best.

The question involves a grantor who conveyed her mansion and surrounding property to her nephew. The conveyance is "for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs." So, the nephew gets a life estate, and after he dies, his heirs get the property in fee simple. 

Then, two years later, the nephew enters into a real estate agreement to sell the property to his brother. The agreement says the nephew will convey the premises to his brother in fee simple absolute. But before the settlement, the brother backs out, saying the nephew can't convey a fee simple. The question is about whether the nephew's prayer for specific performance would be granted, considering that the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished in this jurisdiction.

I remember that the Rule in Shelley's Case applies when a life estate is given to someone, and then a remainder is given to their heirs. Without the Rule, the remainder would typically be contingent because the nephew's heirs might not exist at his death. But the Rule kicks in and makes the remainder vested, effectively creating a fee simple in the nephew. Wait, but the question says the Rule has been abolished, so that changes things.

So, without the Rule, the conveyance is "to A for life, remainder to A's heirs." Normally, that would be a contingent remainder because the class of heirs is not certain yet. So the nephew has a life estate, and the remainder is contingent. 

But wait, in some jurisdictions, when the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished, the remainder to the grantee's heirs is treated as a contingent remainder. So the nephew would only have a life estate, and the remainder is contingent on him having heirs at his death. 

Now, the nephew is trying to sell the property to his brother and convey a fee simple. But since the nephew only has a life estate, he can't convey more than that. So when the brother realizes this, he refuses to go through with the deal because the nephew can't give him the fee simple. 

So the question is whether the court would order specific performance of the contract. Specific performance is when the court forces the parties to perform the contract as agreed. For real estate, it's usually granted because land is considered unique.

But can the nephew actually convey a fee simple? If he only owns a life estate, he can't transfer more than that. So even if he wanted to, he can't give the brother a fee simple. Therefore, the contract might not be enforceable because the nephew can't fulfill his end of the bargain.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Denied because remainder is contingent. That seems possible because without Shelley's Rule, the remainder to heirs is contingent.

B: Granted because nephew can sell life estate. Well, he can sell his life estate, but the issue is whether he can convey fee simple. So maybe the brother is right that he can't do that.

C: Denied because nephew can't convey larger estate than he has. That makes sense. If he only has a life estate, he can't give fee simple.

D: Denied because his interest is life estate and can't transfer fee. Similar to C, but more specific about the interest.

E: Denied because Rule not triggered, so only life estate. Without Shelley's Rule, the nephew only has a life estate, so remainder is contingent.

F: Granted because life estate + vested remainder = fee. But without Shelley's Rule, the remainder isn't vested, so this might not apply.

G: Denied because Doctrine of Worthier Title. I'm not too sure about this. The Doctrine of Worthier Title applies when a person tries to transfer property in a way that creates a reversion or remainder in someone else, which is against public policy. But I'm not sure it's directly applicable here.

H: Granted because heirs have vested interest. No, because without Shelley's Rule, the heirs have a contingent remainder, not vested.

I: Granted because nephew has vested remainder. Again, without Shelley's Rule, the remainder is contingent, so this isn't correct.

J: Granted because the remainder becomes vested. If the remainder becomes vested upon the nephew's death, but the nephew can't convey that future interest now.

So, the issue is whether the nephew can convey a fee simple. Since he only has a life estate, he can't. So when he contracts to sell the property in fee simple, he can't perform. Therefore, specific performance would be denied because he can't convey more than he has.

Looking again, option C says: Denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses. That seems correct. Similarly, option D is similar, but more specific. Let me think about the wording.

The nephew's interest is a life estate; he doesn't own the fee simple. So when he agreed to convey fee simple, he can't do that. Therefore, the brother is right, and the nephew's prayer for specific performance would be denied.

So the correct answer would be either C or D. Let me re-read the options.

Option C: Denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.

Option D: Denied, because the nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer a fee simple absolute.

Both seem correct, but the question is about the nephew's ability to convey. So technically, he can't convey more than his life estate. He can sell his life estate, but the brother wants a fee simple. So the nephew can't perform, thus specific performance is denied.

So looking back, the correct answer is either C or D. But wait, the original conveyance was to the nephew for life, remainder to his heirs. So the nephew has a life estate, and the remainder is contingent.

When the nephew contracts to convey fee simple, he's trying to convey the entire ownership, which he doesn't have. So the contract is based on his ability to convey, which he doesn't have. Therefore, specific performance is denied because he can't perform.

So the answer would be C or D. Hmm, but I think the more precise reason is that he doesn't have the estate to convey, which is option C. Alternatively, D says his interest is limited, which is also correct.

Wait, let me think about what each option states.

Option C says he cannot convey a larger estate than he has. That's a general principle: you can't convey more than you own. So that's correct.

Option D says his interest is for life, so he can't transfer a fee. That's also correct.

But which one is the better answer? The question is about the nephew's prayer for specific performance. Specific performance requires that the plaintiff (nephew) is able to perform. If he can't convey the fee simple, the court won't force the brother to perform because the nephew can't give what he promised.

So either C or D would be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished. So without it, the conveyance to the nephew is a life estate, and the remainder is contingent. So the nephew can't convey a fee simple because he doesn't have it, and the remainder is still contingent.

Therefore, the correct reason is that the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he has, which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says his interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer fee. That's also correct, but perhaps more specific.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about the options.

Option C: Denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.

Option D: Denied, because the nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer a fee simple absolute.

So C is a general principle, D is more specific.

In this case, the nephew only has a life estate, so he can't give the brother a fee simple. Therefore, the answer is either C or D.

Wait, but the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished. So the original conveyance is "to A for life, then to A's heirs." Without the Rule, that's a life estate with a contingent remainder in A's heirs. So the nephew can't convey a fee simple because he doesn't have it. Therefore, the reason is that he can't convey more than he has, so option C.

Alternatively, D is also correct because his interest is a life estate. 

But I think the correct answer is C. Because the nephew's interest is a life estate, so when he tries to convey fee simple, he can't. So the court would deny specific performance because he can't perform. So the answer is C: Denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.

Wait, but another thought: if the nephew has a life estate, can he transfer that? Yes, he can transfer his life estate, but the brother wants a fee simple. So the contract is for fee simple, which the nephew can't provide. Therefore, the nephew can't perform, so specific performance is denied.

So the reason is that the nephew can't convey fee simple, so the answer is C or D.

Looking back, the options:

Option C: Denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.

Option D: Denied, because the nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer a fee simple absolute.

I think both are correct, but perhaps D is more specific.

Wait, but the answer options are from A-J. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Denied, remainder is contingent. So the nephew can't convey because his own interest is a life estate, but that's not the main issue here. The issue is that he's trying to convey a fee simple.

So the correct answer is C or D.

I think the answer is D because it specifically addresses the nephew's inability to transfer a fee simple. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the answer could be C because it's a general principle.

But in the question, the brother says the nephew can't convey a fee simple. So the nephew's inability stems from his limited estate.

I think the correct answer is C. Because the nephew can't convey a larger estate than he has. He only has a life estate, so he can't give a fee simple.

Wait, but when you have a life estate, you can dispose of it during your life. So the nephew could sell his life estate, but the brother is buying the fee simple. Therefore, the nephew can't fulfill the contract, so specific performance is denied, because he can't convey what he doesn't have.

So the reason is that he can't convey a larger estate, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D because his interest is only for life, so he can't transfer a fee. Either way, both C and D seem correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, but another angle: what about the possibility of estoppel by deed or after-acquired title? But that's more when someone sells property they don't own but later acquire it. But that's probably not applicable here.

So I think the correct answer is C: Denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.

The question revolves around the nephew's ability to convey a fee simple absolute interest in the property, given that he only holds a life estate with a contingent remainder after the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished. The nephew agreed to sell the property to his brother in fee simple, but the brother refused to perform, arguing that the nephew could not convey a fee simple. The analysis focuses on whether the nephew can fulfill his contractual obligation to convey a fee simple absolute.

1. **Initial Conveyance**: The grantor conveyed the property "to the nephew for life, remainder to his heirs." Without the Rule in Shelley's Case, this creates a life estate in the nephew and a contingent remainder in his heirs. The nephew does not own the fee simple absolute.

2. **Nephew's Interest**: The nephew only has a life estate, which is limited to his lifetime. He cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses. A fee simple absolute exceeds the nephew's interest, as the remainder is contingent and not vested.

3. **Contractual Obligation**: The nephew agreed to convey a fee simple absolute to his brother. Since the nephew only holds a life estate, he cannot fulfill this obligation. The brother correctly identifies this issue and refuses to perform.

4. **Specific Performance**: Specific performance requires the plaintiff (nephew) to be able to perform the contract as agreed. Since the nephew cannot convey a fee simple absolute, the court would deny specific performance.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. While the remainder is contingent, the key issue is the nephew's inability to convey a fee simple, not the nature of the remainder itself.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The nephew can sell his life estate, but the contract requires conveying a fee simple, which he cannot do.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses. He only has a life estate and cannot grant a fee simple.
   - **Option D**: Also correct. The nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime, and he cannot transfer a fee simple absolute. This is a more specific explanation of the same principle as in Option C.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The absence of the Rule in Shelley's Case means the nephew has a life estate with a contingent remainder, but this does not directly explain why specific performance is denied.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. Without the Rule in Shelley's Case, the nephew does not have a vested remainder, so his interest does not combine to form a fee simple.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The Doctrine of Worthier Title is not directly applicable here.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The heirs have a contingent interest, not a vested indefeasible interest.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The nephew does not have a vested remainder in fee simple absolute.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The remainder does not become vested until the nephew's death, and he cannot convey it now.

6. **Conclusion**: The nephew cannot convey a fee simple absolute because he only holds a life estate. Both Options C and D correctly address this issue, but Option C provides the broader principle that the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.
