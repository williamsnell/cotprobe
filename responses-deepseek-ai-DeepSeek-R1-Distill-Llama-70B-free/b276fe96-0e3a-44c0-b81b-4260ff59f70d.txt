Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem is about a block with a charge placed in an electric field, and I need to find the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the block. The given values are the mass of the block (10.0 grams), the charge (+8.00 × 10^-5 C), and the electric field vector, which is given in terms of i and j components: (3000 i - 600 j) N/C.

Hmm, wait a second. Oh right, the mass is given, but I think it's a distractor here because the force on a charge in an electric field doesn't depend on the mass. Oh yeah, because F = qE, not F = ma or anything involving mass. So I can ignore the mass of the block here.

So the formula I need is F = q * E. But wait, since the electric field is a vector, I need to calculate the magnitude of the force vector. Oh right, because the force will be in the same direction as the electric field if the charge is positive.

Wait, no, wait. The electric force on a positive charge is F = q * E, and the direction is the same as E. But since E is given as a vector, I should compute the magnitude of F by taking the dot product of the charge with the electric field vector. Alternatively, since E is already a vector, the magnitude of F is the charge multiplied by the magnitude of E.

Wait no, wait again. The magnitude of F is the product of the charge and the magnitude of E. Because F is a vector, but the question asks for the magnitude, so I just need the scalar value.

So first, I should find the magnitude of the electric field E. The electric field is given as (3000 i - 600 j) N/C. To find its magnitude, I can use the formula for the magnitude of a vector: |E| = sqrt( (Ex)^2 + (Ey)^2 )

Let me calculate that. Ex is 3000 N/C, and Ey is -600 N/C. But since I'm squaring them, the signs won't matter. So:

Ex squared is 3000^2 = 9,000,000.
Ey squared is (-600)^2 = 360,000.
Adding them together gives 9,000,000 + 360,000 = 9,360,000.

Taking the square root of 9,360,000. Let me compute that. Hmm, sqrt(9,360,000) = let's see, 3000^2 is 9,000,000, and 3060^2 is (3000+60)^2 = 3000² + 2*3000*60 +60² = 9,000,000 + 360,000 + 3,600 = 9,363,600. Oh wait, that's even a bit higher than 9,360,000.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think. Let me factor this. 9,360,000 is 9,360,000 = 9.36 × 10^6. The square root of 9.36 is 3.06, because 3.06^2 is 9.36 (since 3^2 is 9, 0.06^2 is 0.0036, and cross terms 2*3*0.06 = 0.36. So 9 + 0.36 + 0.0036 = 9.3636. Wait, but that's 3.06^2=9.3636, which is slightly more than 9.36, which is 9.360000.

So maybe it's exactly 3,060? No, wait, 3,060 squared is (3.06 × 10^3)^2 = 9.36 × 10^6, which is 9,360,000. Exactly. So the magnitude of E is 3,060 N/C.

So |E| = 3060 N/C.

Now, the charge q is 8.00 × 10^-5 C.

So the magnitude of the force F is F = q * |E|.

So plugging the numbers in: F = 8.00e-5 C * 3060 N/C.

Let me compute that.

Compute 8e-5 * 3060.

First, 8 * 3060 = let's compute that. 8*3000=24,000, 8*60=480; total 24,480.

So 8e-5 * 3060 = (8 * 3060) * 1e-5 = 24,480 * 1e-5.

Wait, 1e-5 is 0.00001. So 24,480 * 0.00001 = 0.2448.

So F = 0.2448 Newtons.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.245 N, which matches this value. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I compute the magnitude correctly?

E's components are 3000 and -600. So the magnitude is sqrt(3000² + (-600)^2) = sqrt(9e6 + 3.6e5) = sqrt(9.36e6) = 3060 N/C. That seems right.

Then F = 8e-5 * 3060 = 8 * 3060 / 1e5. 8 *3060 = 24480. 24480 / 1e5 = 0.2448 N. Yep, that's 0.245 N when rounded to three decimal places.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.245 N. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force on the block, we use the formula for the force on a charge in an electric field:

\[
F = q \cdot |E|
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the magnitude of the electric field
The electric field is given as a vector:

\[
\vec{E} = (3000 \hat{i} - 600 \hat{j}) \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

The magnitude of the electric field is calculated using the formula for the magnitude of a vector:

\[
|E| = \sqrt{E_x^2 + E_y^2}
\]

Substituting the components:

\[
|E| = \sqrt{(3000)^2 + (-600)^2} = \sqrt{9,000,000 + 360,000} = \sqrt{9,360,000} = 3060 \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the magnitude of the force
The charge of the block is:

\[
q = +8.00 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

The magnitude of the force is:

\[
F = q \cdot |E| = (8.00 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot (3060)
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
F = 8.00 \cdot 3060 \cdot 10^{-5} = 24,480 \cdot 10^{-5} = 0.2448 \, \mathrm{N}
\]

Rounding to three decimal places:

\[
F = 0.245 \, \mathrm{N}
\]

### Final Answer
The magnitude of the electrostatic force on the block is **0.245 N**, which corresponds to **option A**.
