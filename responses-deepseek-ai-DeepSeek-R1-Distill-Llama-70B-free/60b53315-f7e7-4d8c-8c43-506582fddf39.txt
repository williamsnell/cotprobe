Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer for this insurance policy premium question. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

So, there are three policies, each with a face value, a premium rate, and a term. I think the term is how long the policy is for. The question is asking about the premium for each policy, and the options are combinations of these premiums.

The formula I remember for calculating the premium is: Premium = (Face Value) * (Rate per $100) * (Term in years). Wait, no, actually, I think the rate is per $100 per year. So for each year, you multiply the rate by the face value divided by 100. Then multiply by the number of years.

Let me break it down for each policy.

Policy 1:
Face Value = $9,000
Rate = $0.28 per $100 per year
Term = 1 year

So the premium would be (9000 / 100) * 0.28 * 1. Let's calculate that. 9000 divided by 100 is 90. 90 times 0.28 is 25.2. So Policy 1's premium is $25.20.

Policy 2:
Face Value = $52,000
Rate = $0.35 per $100 per year
Term = 3 years

Calculating: (52000 / 100) = 520. Multiply by rate 0.35: 520 * 0.35 = let's see, 500*0.35=175 and 20*0.35=7, so 175+7=182. Then multiply by 3 years: 182 *3 = 546. So Policy 2's premium is $546.00.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because the term is 3 years, so the total is 182 per year times 3, which is 546. So yes, that's correct.

Policy 3:
Face Value = $28,000
Rate = $0.42 per $100 per year
Term = 1 year

Calculating: 28000 /100 = 280. 280 * 0.42. Let me compute that: 280 *0.4 is 112, and 280 *0.02 is 5.6. So total is 117.6. So Policy 3 is $117.60.

Now, looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: P1:52, P2:182, P3:28. No, because my calculations don't match. P1 is 25.20, so A is wrong.

Option B: P1:28, P2:546, P3:117.60. Well, P1 is 28? No, I got 25.20. So B is wrong.

Option C: P1:28, P2:491, P3:117.00. No, P1 is wrong, and P2 is 546, not 491. P3 is 117.6, not 117. So C is wrong.

Option D: P1:25.20, P2:491.40, P3:117.60. Wait, I calculated P2 as 546. So D is wrong because P2 is 491.40.

Option E: P1:52, P2:182, P3:117.60. No, P1 is wrong. So E is out.

Option F: P1:28, P2:182, P3:117.60. P1 and P2 are wrong. So F is no.

Option G: P1:25.20, P2:182, P3:176.40. P2 is 182 but according to my calculation, it's 546. So G is wrong.

Option H: P1:52, P2:491.40, P3:28. All wrong. So H is no.

Option I: P1:25.20, P2:182, P3:117.60. P2 is wrong because it should be 546. So I is incorrect.

Option J: P1:25.20, P2:546, P3:117.60. Oh wait, that's exactly what I calculated. So J seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check the policies. Policy 2's term is 3 years, so 182 per year times 3 is 546. Yes. And Policy 3 is 117.60. So J is the correct option.

To determine the correct answer, we calculate the premium for each policy using the formula:

\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{\text{Face Value}}{100}\right) \times \text{Rate per \$100 per year} \times \text{Term in years}.
\]

### Policy 1:
- Face Value: $9,000
- Rate: $0.28 per $100 per year
- Term: 1 year

\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{9,000}{100}\right) \times 0.28 \times 1 = 90 \times 0.28 = 25.20.
\]

### Policy 2:
- Face Value: $52,000
- Rate: $0.35 per $100 per year
- Term: 3 years

\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{52,000}{100}\right) \times 0.35 \times 3 = 520 \times 0.35 \times 3 = 182 \times 3 = 546.00.
\]

### Policy 3:
- Face Value: $28,000
- Rate: $0.42 per $100 per year
- Term: 1 year

\[
\text{Premium} = \left(\frac{28,000}{100}\right) \times 0.42 \times 1 = 280 \times 0.42 = 117.60.
\]

### Matching with Options:
- **Policy 1**: $25.20
- **Policy 2**: $546.00
- **Policy 3**: $117.60

The only option that matches these values is **J**.
