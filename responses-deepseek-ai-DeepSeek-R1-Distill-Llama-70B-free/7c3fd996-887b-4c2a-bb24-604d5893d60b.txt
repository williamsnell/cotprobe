Question:

Devise an experiment which would distinguish between Decay and Interference theories of forgetting. What results would have to be obtained to support the Decay theory? To support the Interference theory?

Options:

A: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly more than the control group, indicating that time strengthens memories. Interference Theory is supported if recall is unaffected by additional learning tasks.
B: Interference Theory is supported if the control group recalls more than the experimental group when a competing task is introduced immediately after learning, indicating that immediate interference affects recall.
C: Interference Theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A
D: Decay Theory is supported if the recall is unaffected over time, while Interference Theory is supported if recall decreases with the introduction of a competing task shortly after learning.
E: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group demonstrates improved recall with the introduction of a competing task, indicating that interference can actually enhance memory retention.
F: Decay Theory is supported if both groups recall the same amount from learning task A, proving that time fades memories. Interference Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly less than the control group, indicating interference from other memories
G: Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly less than the control group
H: Decay Theory is supported if recall diminishes in the absence of any competing tasks over a long period, indicating that memories fade naturally over time. Interference Theory is supported if recall diminishes only when a competing task is introduced during the retention interval.
I: Both theories are supported if the control group recalls significantly less than the experimental group
J: Interference Theory is supported if both groups show improved recall over time, suggesting that memories consolidate rather than decay or interfere with each other.

Okay, so I have this question about the Decay and Interference theories of forgetting. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that these are two different explanations for why we forget things. Let me think about each theory.

Decay theory suggests that memories naturally fade over time if they're not used or rehearsed. So, the longer you go without recalling a memory, the weaker it gets, until it's forgotten. On the other hand, interference theory says that forgetting happens because other information interferes with the memory. Like, if you learn something new, it might disrupt your existing memories, making them harder to recall.

The question is asking me to design an experiment to distinguish between these two theories. So I need to figure out what results would support each theory.

Let me think about how to set up the experiment. Maybe have two groups: a control group and an experimental group. The control group would probably just learn some information and then be tested on it after a certain time without any additional tasks. The experimental group might learn the same information but then do another task that could interfere, like learning a different set of information or doing something that uses similar memory pathways.

Wait, but wait. No, actually, to test interference, the experimental group might be given a competing task after learning. Like, after learning task A, they do task B, which could interfere. The control group doesn't do task B. Then, after some time, both groups are tested on task A.

So if the control group remembers more than the experimental group, that would support interference theory because the extra task interfered with their memory of task A. But if both groups forget equally over time without any interfering tasks, that would support decay theory.

Alternatively, maybe for decay theory, you could have a situation where the passage of time without interference leads to forgetting. So the control group might wait a long time without doing anything else, and the experimental group does something else right after learning. If the experimental group's recall isn't worse, but the control's is, that could show decay. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. Decay theory is about the passage of time causing forgetting regardless of new information. So an experiment could test whether time alone causes forgetting. So maybe the control group learns something and is tested immediately, while the experimental group learns it and waits a while without any interfering tasks before testing. If the experimental group recalls less, that supports decay.

Interference theory would require introducing new information or tasks after the initial learning. So if after learning task A, the experimental group does task B, and their recall of A is worse than the control group which didn't do task B, that supports interference.

Looking at the options now. The question asks what results support each theory.

Option H says: Decay is supported if recall diminishes without competing tasks over a long time, and interference if recall diminishes only when a competing task is introduced. That makes sense.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option H says exactly that. Decay when no interference but time passes. Interference when a competing task causes worse recall.

So the correct answer would be H. Let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A says Decay is supported if experimental recalls more. That doesn't fit because time should make it worse, not better. Option B talks about control recalling more when a competing task is introduced, which might be interference. But I'm not sure. Option H seems to fit what I thought.

To distinguish between the Decay and Interference theories of forgetting, an experiment could involve two groups: a control group and an experimental group. The control group would learn information and be tested after a period of time without any interfering tasks, while the experimental group would learn the same information but also engage in a competing task during the retention interval. 

- **Decay Theory** posits that memories fade naturally over time without the need for interference. Therefore, if recall diminishes in the absence of any competing tasks over a long period, this would support the Decay Theory.
- **Interference Theory** suggests that forgetting occurs due to interference from new information or tasks. If recall diminishes only when a competing task is introduced during the retention interval, this would support the Interference Theory.

Among the options provided, Option H aligns with this reasoning: Decay Theory is supported if recall diminishes in the absence of competing tasks over time, and Interference Theory is supported if recall diminishes when a competing task is introduced.

Answer: H
