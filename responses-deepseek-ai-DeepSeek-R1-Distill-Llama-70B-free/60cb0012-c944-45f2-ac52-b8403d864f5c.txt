Okay, so I've got this question here about ionic substances and their lattice enthalpies. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the greatest lattice enthalpy. I remember lattice enthalpy is the energy released when ions come together to form a solid crystal lattice. The higher the lattice enthalpy, the stronger the attraction between the ions.

Wait, what factors affect lattice enthalpy again? Oh right, it's mainly about the charges of the ions and the size of the ions. Higher charges mean stronger electrostatic attraction, which leads to higher lattice enthalpy. Also, smaller ions can get closer together, so that makes the lattice stronger too.

So the options given are A to J. Let me list them out:

A: CaS
B: MgS
C: NaCl
D: LiCl
E: NaF
F: MgO
G: LiF
H: CaO
I: KF
J: KCl

I think I should look at the charges of the ions and their sizes. Let's break it down.

For each compound, I'll note the metal and non-metal ions:

A: Ca²+ and S²-
B: Mg²+ and S²-
C: Na+ and Cl⁻
D: Li+ and Cl⁻
E: Na+ and F⁻
F: Mg²+ and O²-
G: Li+ and F⁻
H: Ca²+ and O²-
I: K+ and F⁻
J: K+ and Cl⁻

Now, higher charges are better for higher lattice enthalpy. So compounds with +2 and -2 charges are better than +1 and -1.

Looking at the options:

Which compounds have +2 and -2? A, B, F, H. The others have +1 and -1. So among these, the ones with higher charges are in A, B, F, H.

Now, also considering the size of the ions. For the same charge, smaller ions lead to higher lattice enthalpy because they can get closer, increasing the electrostatic attraction.

For the cations (positive ions) in the +2 group:

A: Ca²+ has a larger ionic radius than Mg²+. Because in the same period, Mg is to the right of Ca, so Mg has a smaller atomic size. Wait, no—wait, Ca is in group 2, Mg is group 2 as well. Ca is below Mg in group 2. So Ca has a larger atomic radius than Mg. So Mg²+ is smaller than Ca²+.

So between A (CaS) and B (MgS), MgS has smaller cation (Mg²+ is smaller than Ca²+), so MgS would have higher lattice enthalpy than CaS because the ions are smaller and closer.

Similarly, looking at F (MgO) and H (CaO): both have O²- as the anion. MgO has Mg²+ (smaller) and CaO has Ca²+ (larger). So MgO's lattice enthalpy should be higher than CaO because the Mg²+ is smaller, so closer to O²-.

Now among the +2 compounds: A, B, F, H.

So between B (MgS) and F (MgO): both have Mg²+. Let's look at the anions. S²- and O²-. O²- is smaller than S²- because oxygen is higher in the periodic table. So O²- has a smaller ionic radius. So the MgO (F) will have a higher lattice enthalpy than MgS (B) because the anion is smaller, allowing the ions to be closer, stronger attraction.

So F (MgO) is a candidate.

Then H (CaO) has Ca²+ and O²-. Ca²+ is larger than Mg²+, so the lattice enthalpy of CaO is lower than MgO.

So among the +2, MgO (F) is better.

Wait, what about the other +2 compounds? Are there any others with higher charges? No, because all the other compounds are +1 and -1.

So now, comparing MgO (F) with the rest.

Wait, but wait—another thing I remember is that for ions with the same charge, the lattice enthalpy increases as the size of the ions decreases. So for the same charges, the smaller the ions, the higher the lattice enthalpy.

So looking at MgO (F) and LiF (G). Oh wait, LiF has +1 and -1 charges, not +2 and -2. So MgO (F) is better than LiF (G) because of higher charges.

Wait, but in the options, F is MgO, which has +2 and -2, whereas G is LiF, which is +1 and -1. So MgO has higher charges, so higher lattice enthalpy.

So F is better than G.

Wait, but I might have missed something. Let me think again.

So the compounds:

F: MgO → Mg²+ and O²-
H: CaO → Ca²+ and O²-
B: MgS → Mg²+ and S²-
A: CaS → Ca²+ and S²-
The others: +1 and -1.

So, for the +2 and -2 group, which has the smallest ions? Mg²+ is smaller than Ca²+, and O²- is smaller than S²-.

So MgO (F) has the combination of smaller cation (Mg²+) and smaller anion (O²-) compared to the other +2/-2 compounds.

Thus, MgO (F) should have the highest lattice enthalpy.

Wait, but what about the other compounds? Let me check. For example, H is CaO. Ca²+ is larger than Mg²+, so CaO's lattice enthalpy is lower than MgO. Similarly, B is MgS—since S²- is larger than O²-, the lattice enthalpy is lower than that of MgO.

So yes, F (MgO) is the one.

Wait, but another point: some compounds might have higher charges, but I think all the options are either +2/-2 or +1/-1. So MgO has the highest charge combination.

So the answer should be F: MgO.

To determine which ionic substance has the greatest lattice enthalpy, we consider two key factors: the charges of the ions and their ionic radii. Lattice enthalpy increases with higher ionic charges and smaller ionic radii, as stronger electrostatic attractions result when ions are closer together.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Compounds with +2 and -2 charges**:  
   - **A: CaS** (Ca²⁺, S²⁻)  
   - **B: MgS** (Mg²⁺, S²⁻)  
   - **F: MgO** (Mg²⁺, O²⁻)  
   - **H: CaO** (Ca²⁺, O²⁻)  

   Among these, Mg²⁺ is smaller than Ca²⁺, and O²⁻ is smaller than S²⁻. Therefore, **MgO (F)**, with the smallest cation (Mg²⁺) and the smallest anion (O²⁻), has the strongest electrostatic attraction and the highest lattice enthalpy.  

2. **Compounds with +1 and -1 charges**:  
   - **C: NaCl** (Na⁺, Cl⁻)  
   - **D: LiCl** (Li⁺, Cl⁻)  
   - **E: NaF** (Na⁺, F⁻)  
   - **G: LiF** (Li⁺, F⁻)  
   - **I: KF** (K⁺, F⁻)  
   - **J: KCl** (K⁺, Cl⁻)  

   While these compounds have smaller ions compared to some +2/-2 compounds, their lower ionic charges result in weaker electrostatic attractions, leading to lower lattice enthalpies compared to the +2/-2 compounds.

### Conclusion:
Among all the options, **MgO (F)** has the highest lattice enthalpy due to its combination of high ionic charges (+2 and -2) and the smallest ionic radii (Mg²⁺ and O²⁻).
