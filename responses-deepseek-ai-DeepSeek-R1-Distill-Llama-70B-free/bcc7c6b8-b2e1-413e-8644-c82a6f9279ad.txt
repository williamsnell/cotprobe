Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read it again carefully. 

The situation is about a man and a woman who are tennis partners. The man had an accident at work last January where he slipped and fell while restocking shelves. Now, he's suing the grocery store for damages, claiming the accident caused him back and leg pain. At the trial, the woman testified that five days before the accident, the man told her, "I can't complete the tennis match because of pains in my back and legs." The question is about whether this testimony is admissible and under what grounds.

Hmm. So the man is claiming that the accident caused his back and leg pain. But the woman is saying that he had these pains before the accident. That seems relevant because if he had the pain before, it might contradict his claim that the accident caused it. But I need to think about the rules of evidence here.

The statement the woman is testifying about is something the man said before the accident. So it's a statement made by a party (the man) that's being offered against him now. Wait, but this is a civil case, so the man is the plaintiff. The defendant (the grocery store) is probably trying to use this statement to show that the man had pre-existing injuries, which would affect damages.

Now, the issue is whether this statement is admissible. The possible objections would be hearsay, relevance, etc.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. So the woman is testifying about what the man said. If the purpose is to prove that the man actually had back and leg pain before the accident, then it's hearsay because it's being offered to establish the truth of the matter (that he had pain before).

But wait, there's an exception for statements of physical condition. I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), there's an exception for statements describing the declarant's then-existing physical condition. So if the statement was made to describe how he felt at that time, it's admissible as an exception to hearsay.

So looking at the options, I see options D and F. Option D says admissible as a statement of physical condition, and F says admissible as a statement of bodily condition. Wait, I think the rule refers to "physical condition" or "bodily condition." Let me recall: I think FRE 803(3) includes statements about the declarant's then-existing physical condition, so that would make it admissible.

But wait, another thought: the man is the plaintiff, and this is a statement he made. So the statement is being offered by the defense to show he had pain before the accident. Since the man is a party, the statement could also be admissible as a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2), which means it's not hearsay at all. Because party admissions are excluded from the definition of hearsay.

So if the statement is a party admission, it's admissible. But I'm a bit confused here. The statement was made by the plaintiff (the man) before the accident. The defendant is offering it. So under 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is admissible if it's offered against a party and was made by the party himself. So yes, this is a party admission, so it's not hearsay.

Wait, but wait. The man is the plaintiff, so the defendant is offering his statement against him. So that would fit 801(d)(2)(A). So the statement is admissible as a party admission, meaning it's not hearsay, so the hearsay objection wouldn't apply.

But looking at the options, none of them mention party admission. Let me check the options again.

Option H says admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statements are usually for impeaching a witness. Here, the man is the plaintiff, and this is a statement he made before. But he's the plaintiff, so if he testified about his condition, maybe this could be a prior inconsistent statement, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, but in this scenario, the statement is being offered to prove he had pain before the accident, not to impeach his testimony. So maybe it's more about the physical condition exception or the party admission.

Hmm. The woman's testimony is about the man's statement. If the statement is a party admission, then it's admissible as non-hearsay. So that would make the testimony admissible, so options that say inadmissible as hearsay would be incorrect.

Looking at the options again: option B says inadmissible as hearsay. But if it's a party admission, hearsay doesn't apply. So B would be incorrect.

Option D and F are about exceptions. But if the statement is a party admission, it's not hearsay, so those exceptions don't apply. So the correct reason would be that it's admissible as a party admission, but I don't see that option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option I: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Option F: admissible as a statement of bodily condition. So if the statement is admissible under 803(3), then F would be correct, because it's an exception. But if it's a party admission, then it's not hearsay, so it's admissible without needing an exception.

Wait, but the statement is about the man's physical condition at the time, so it's a statement of his then-existing condition, so it's covered by 803(3). So it's admissible as an exception. Alternatively, it's also a party admission, so it's admissible as non-hearsay.

But the options don't have party admission as an option. Let me look again.

The options are A through J. The only options that say admissible are D, F, G, H, I.

So if the statement is a party admission, it's admissible. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is testing the exception for physical condition.

Wait, but 803(3) allows for statements about the declarant's then-existing physical condition. So the man's statement about his back and leg pain is about his condition at that time. So it's admissible under 803(3), making option F correct, as it's a statement of bodily condition.

Alternatively, if the statement is being offered as a party admission, it's admissible. But the options don't include party admission, so perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, but the options D and F are similar. Option D says "statement of physical condition," F says "bodily condition." I think the rule uses "physical condition," so perhaps D is the correct one. Or maybe both are correct, but looking at the options, F is "bodily condition," which is similar.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The man's statement is about his current pain at the time of speaking. So it's a present bodily condition, so it falls under 803(3). Therefore, it's an exception to the hearsay rule, making it admissible. So the correct option would be F: admissible as a statement of bodily condition.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says "admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule." So that's a broader option. So if F is a specific exception, then F is better.

So the correct answer is either F or I. But I think F is more precise because it's specifically the exception for statements of bodily condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is not hearsay because it's a party admission. So then, the testimony would be admissible as a party admission, and the hearsay rule doesn't apply. So then, the options that say inadmissible as hearsay (option B) would be incorrect. But none of the options mention party admission.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The woman is testifying about the man's statement. The statement is offered to show that the man had pain before the accident, which would affect his claim. So it's being offered for the truth of the matter (that he had pain before), so it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

The possible exceptions are present physical condition (803(3)) or statement of then-existing mental or physical condition. So the statement is about his existing condition at the time, so it's admissible under 803(3). Therefore, the testimony is admissible as an exception to hearsay.

So looking at the options, option F says "admissible as a statement of bodily condition," which aligns with 803(3). So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, for statements of physical condition, the declarant's motive to lie can affect admissibility. But I think that's more about the weight of the evidence, not admissibility.

Alternatively, if the statement is being offered as a party admission, it's non-hearsay, so it doesn't need an exception. But the options don't include that. So perhaps the intended answer is F or I.

Wait, option I is "admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule." That's a broader category. So 803(3) is an exception, so I think F is more specific and correct.

So I think the correct answer is F.

The man is suing the grocery store, claiming that the accident caused his back and leg pain. The woman testified that five days before the accident, the man told her he couldn't complete a tennis match due to pains in his back and legs. The issue is whether this testimony is admissible.

The statement is being offered to show that the man had pre-existing pain, which is relevant to the case. However, it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, making it hearsay unless an exception applies. 

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), statements describing the declarant's then-existing physical condition are admissible under the exception in FRE 803(3). The man's statement about his back and leg pain at the time it was made qualifies as a statement of his then-existing physical condition. Therefore, the testimony is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

While the statement could also be considered a party admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), the options provided do not explicitly mention this. Among the given options, the most precise and correct answer is that the testimony is admissible as a statement of bodily condition under FRE 803(3).

ANSWER: F
