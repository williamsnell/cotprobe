Question:

A prominent judge lived next door to a father. Recently, the judge had sentenced the father's son to six months in prison on a narcotics charge. One afternoon while the judge was mowing his lawn, the father decided to avenge his son's conviction.

The water hit the judge in the back and drenched him. The judge would be able to recover against the father for which of the following tort or torts?

Options:

A: Trespass to land and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
B: Assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
C: Negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
D: Trespass to chattels and battery.
E: Negligence and battery.
F: Assault and trespass to chattels.
G: Battery and trespass to land.
H: Negligence and assault.
I: Battery, assault and trespass to land.

Okay, so I have this tort question in front of me, and I need to figure out which torts apply here. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a judge who sentenced a father's son to six months in prison for a narcotics charge. The father wants revenge, so he sets up a water sprinkler behind some shrubs that separate their properties. When the judge is mowing his lawn and gets close, the father turns on the sprinkler, which soaks the judge. The judge didn't see the water coming.

So the question is asking which torts the judge can recover for. The options are A through J, each listing possible torts.

Let me recall the elements of each tort. I think the key ones here are battery, assault, trespass to land, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and trespass to chattels.

First, battery. Battery requires an intentional harmful or offensive touching of another person. The touching can be indirect, like throwing something at someone. Here, the father sprayed water which hit the judge. That's a physical contact, so that's a touching. Was it harmful or offensive? Well, it's not necessarily harmful, but being drenched could be offensive. So battery might apply.

Next, assault. Assault is an intentional act that causes reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact. So the judge needs to have seen the water coming and felt afraid. But the question says the judge didn't see the water coming. So he didn't have the apprehension. Therefore, assault might not apply here.

What about trespass to land? Trespass to land occurs when someone enters another's land without permission, causing interference. The water from the sprinkler crossed onto the judge's property. So the father's action caused water to trespass onto the judge's land. That could be trespass to land.

Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires intentional or reckless conduct that's extreme and outrageous, causing severe emotional distress. I'm not sure here. The father was trying to avenge his son's conviction, which is a strong motive, but just spraying water might not be extreme enough. It's more of a prank, maybe, but depending on the context. But IIED usually requires more severe emotional harm. So maybe IIED doesn't apply.

Negligence would require a breach of duty causing injury. But here, the father's action was intentional, not negligent. So negligence is probably not the case here.

Trespass to chattels involves interference with personal property. I don't see any mention of damaging the judge's property, just that he was drenched. So that might not apply.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Trespass to land and IIED. I think trespass to land is possible, but IIED might not be because the emotional distress might not be severe enough.

Option B: Assault and IIED. But no, assault doesn't apply because the judge didn't see it coming.

Option C: Negligence and IIED. Negligence is probably out because it's an intentional act.

Option D: Trespass to chattels and battery. Trespass to chattels seems unlikely here.

Option E: Negligence and battery. Again, negligence might not apply.

Option F: Assault and trespass to chattels. Assault is out, and so is trespass to chattels.

Option G: Battery and trespass to land. This seems possible. The water hitting is battery, and the water on land is trespass to land.

Option H: Negligence and assault. Both don't fit.

Option I: Battery, assault, and trespass to land. But assault isn't applicable here since there was no apprehension.

So the best option seems to be G: battery and trespass to land.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Did the water trespass onto the land? Because the father's sprinkler was on his own property, but the water went onto the judge's lawn. So that's an unauthorized entry, which is trespass to land. So yes, that applies.

So the judge can sue for battery because he was touched by the water, and for trespass to land because water entered his property without permission.

So the answer should be G.

The scenario involves a judge who was soaked by a water sprinkler set up by a father seeking revenge for his son's conviction. To determine which torts apply, we analyze the elements of each:

1. **Battery**: This requires an intentional harmful or offensive touching. The water from the sprinkler caused physical contact with the judge, which could be considered offensive. Thus, battery applies.

2. **Assault**: This requires an act causing reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. Since the judge did not see the water coming, he did not experience apprehension, so assault does not apply.

3. **Trespass to Land**: This occurs when someone causes an unauthorized entry on another's land. The water from the father's sprinkler crossed onto the judge's property, constituting trespass to land.

4. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: This requires extreme and outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress. While the father's motive was strong, the act of spraying water is more of a prank and likely does not meet the threshold for IIED.

5. **Negligence**: This involves a breach of duty causing injury. The father's act was intentional, not negligent, so negligence does not apply.

6. **Trespass to Chattels**: This involves interference with personal property. There is no indication of damage to the judge's property, so this does not apply.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Trespass to land and IIED — Trespass to land applies, but IIED likely does not.
- **B**: Assault and IIED — Neither applies.
- **C**: Negligence and IIED — Neither applies.
- **D**: Trespass to chattels and battery — Trespass to chattels does not apply.
- **E**: Negligence and battery — Negligence does not apply.
- **F**: Assault and trespass to chattels — Neither applies.
- **G**: Battery and trespass to land — Both apply.
- **H**: Negligence and assault — Neither applies.
- **I**: Battery, assault, and trespass to land — Assault does not apply.

The correct answer is **G: Battery and trespass to land**, as both torts are supported by the facts.

Answer: G
