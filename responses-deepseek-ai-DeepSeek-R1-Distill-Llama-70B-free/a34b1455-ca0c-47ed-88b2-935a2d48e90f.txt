Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, Zoey is laying bricks for her patio, and the salesman wants to sell her as many bricks as possible without any leftovers. The goal is to cover the patio with a thickness of one brick. 

First, I need to find out the area of the patio and the area of each brick, then see how many bricks fit into the patio area. But wait, I should make sure that the units are consistent because the patio is measured in feet and the bricks in inches. Oh right, unit conversion is crucial here.

The patio dimensions are 12 feet by 10 feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, let me convert those to inches to match the brick dimensions. So 12 feet is 12 * 12 = 144 inches, and 10 feet is 10 * 12 = 120 inches. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 12 feet is 12 *12 inches? No, wait, no, 1 foot is 12 inches. So 12 feet is 12 * 12 inches? Let me think. Oh no, wait, 12 feet is 12 * 12 inches? No, 12 feet would be 12 * 12 inches? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, 1 foot is 12 inches. So 12 feet is 12 * 12 inches, which is 144 inches. Similarly, 10 feet is 10 * 12 inches, which is 120 inches. So the patio is 144 inches by 120 inches.

Now, the area of the patio in square inches is 144 * 120. Let me calculate that. 144 * 120. Hmm, 144 * 100 is 14,400, and 144 * 20 is 2,880, so total is 17,280 square inches.

Each brick is 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches. Wait, but since the patio is covered with a thickness of one brick, I think that means the bricks are laid flat, so their thickness (2 inches) is the height. But when calculating how many bricks fit into the area, I think I only need to consider the area of each brick's face. Wait, no, because the problem is about covering the area, so each brick covers a certain area.

Wait, no. Each brick has a length and width that contribute to the area. So each brick's area is 4 inches * 6 inches (since the 2 inches is the height, and we're only covering the patio area, which is 2D). So each brick covers 24 square inches in area.

So the number of bricks would be the total patio area divided by the brick area. So that's 17,280 / 24. Let's compute that. 17,280 divided by 24.

Hmm, 24 * 700 is 16,800. 17,280 minus 16,800 is 480. 480 /24 is 20. So 700 +20 =720. So 720 bricks?

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are in the thousands. Wait, wait, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, the area of the patio is 144 inches by 120 inches, so 144 * 120 = 17,280 square inches. Each brick's area is 4 * 6 =24 square inches. So 17,280 /24 = 720 bricks. But the options don't have 720. The options start from 1,440 and go up. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I got the brick dimensions wrong. Oh, wait! The problem says each brick is 4 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches, and the patio is covered with a thickness of one brick. So maybe the 2-inch side is the height, but perhaps when laying the bricks, they can be arranged in different orientations. Oh, wait, perhaps the area each brick covers depends on how it's placed.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the area based on the brick's dimensions. For example, if you lay the brick with the 4x6 face down, then each brick covers 24 square inches. But what if the brick is placed with a different face, like 4x2, then the area would be 8 square inches, but that would require more bricks. Or 6x2, which is 12. No, that would complicate things.

Wait, but the salesman wants to sell as many bricks as possible. So he would want each brick to cover the smallest possible area, so that more bricks are needed. Because, for example, if each brick covers 8 square inches, then the number of bricks would be 17,280 /8 = 2,160 bricks. Which is option F. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the question says the salesman wants to sell as many bricks as possible without any leftovers. So he would arrange the bricks in such a way that each brick covers as little area as possible, thereby requiring more bricks. So the brick's smallest possible face area would determine the maximum number of bricks.

So the brick has dimensions 4x6x2 inches. The possible areas when laying the brick are:

- 4x6 =24 in²
- 4x2=8 in²
- 6x2=12 in²

So the smallest area is 8 in². So if each brick is placed such that it covers 8 in², then the number of bricks would be 17,280 /8 = 2,160. So that's option F.

Wait, but wait another moment. The thickness is one brick. So perhaps the height (thickness) is 2 inches. So the bricks are laid in a way that their height is 2 inches, which is the thickness of the patio. So the area of each brick's base (the part covering the patio) would be length × width, which could be either 4x6, 4x2, or 6x2. But the salesman wants to sell as many bricks, so he would choose the smallest possible base area, which is 4x2=8 in², so each brick covers 8 in², leading to 17,280 /8 = 2,160 bricks. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's see what the other approach would be. If the bricks are laid with the largest face, then each brick covers 24 in², so 17,280 /24=720 bricks. But the options don't include 720. So the correct approach must be to arrange the bricks such that each brick covers the smallest area, thus requiring more bricks. So 2,160 bricks, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, F is 2,160. So that's the answer.

To determine the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell to Zoey, we need to calculate the area of the patio and the area of each brick, then determine how many bricks fit into the patio area. 

### Step 1: Convert patio dimensions to inches
The patio dimensions are 12 feet by 10 feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
- 12 feet = \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \) inches
- 10 feet = \( 10 \times 12 = 120 \) inches

Thus, the patio area is:
\[
144 \, \text{inches} \times 120 \, \text{inches} = 17,280 \, \text{square inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the area of each brick
Each brick has dimensions \( 4 \, \text{inches} \times 6 \, \text{inches} \times 2 \, \text{inches} \). Since the patio is being covered with a thickness of one brick, the thickness (2 inches) is the height, and the area of the brick's base (the part covering the patio) depends on its orientation:
- If the brick is laid with the \( 4 \times 6 \) face down, the area is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \, \text{square inches} \).
- If the brick is laid with the \( 4 \times 2 \) face down, the area is \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \, \text{square inches} \).
- If the brick is laid with the \( 6 \times 2 \) face down, the area is \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \, \text{square inches} \).

The salesman wants to sell as many bricks as possible, so he would choose the orientation where each brick covers the smallest possible area. The smallest area is \( 8 \, \text{square inches} \) (when the \( 4 \times 2 \) face is down).

### Step 3: Calculate the number of bricks
To find the number of bricks needed, divide the total patio area by the area of one brick:
\[
\text{Number of bricks} = \frac{17,280 \, \text{square inches}}{8 \, \text{square inches per brick}} = 2,160
\]

### Step 4: Verify the answer
The calculation shows that 2,160 bricks are required when each brick covers \( 8 \, \text{square inches} \). This matches option F.
