Okay, so I have this problem here: 0.32 grams is equal to something centigrams. I need to find the correct number from the options A to J. Hmm, I remember that metric units are based on moving decimals by certain places.

Wait, centi- means one hundredth, right? So a centigram is a hundredth of a gram. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The prefix centi- is 10^-2, which is 0.01. So 1 centigram equals 0.01 grams. That means to convert grams to centigrams, I multiply by 100.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. If I have grams and I want to get to centigrams, since each centigram is smaller, the number should be bigger. Because 1 gram is 100 centigrams. So 0.32 grams would be 0.32 * 100 centigrams. That makes sense because moving from grams to centigrams involves multiplying by 100.

So 0.32 grams times 100 is 32. So the number should be 32. Let me look at the options. Option D is 32. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the prefixes. Another way is to think about the conversion factor. Since 1 cg is 0.01 grams, then to find how many cg are in 0.32 grams, I divide by 0.01. Or, 0.32 / 0.01 is 32. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 0.32 grams equals x centigrams. So 1 gram is 100 cg, so 0.32 grams is 0.32 * 100 = 32 cg. So the correct answer is 32, which is option D.

To convert 0.32 grams to centigrams, we use the fact that 1 gram equals 100 centigrams. Therefore, multiplying 0.32 grams by 100 gives 32 centigrams. The correct answer is 32, which corresponds to option D.
