Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating marginal and average physical productivities and determining the optimum population, which is the level with the highest per capita income. The data provided is a table with population in thousands and total physical product in thousand tons. The columns for marginal and average physical product are empty, so I'll need to fill those in first.

Hmm, I remember that marginal physical product (MPP) is the additional output produced by adding one more unit of a variable input, in this case, population (labor). So for each population level beyond the first, MPP is the change in total physical product when the population increases by one thousand.

Looking at the table, when population increases from 1 to 2 thousand, total product goes from 10 to 22. So the MPP for population 2 is 22 -10 =12. Similarly, for population 3, it's 36-22=14. Wait, but wait, I think I might be mixing up the rows here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the first row is population 1, total product 10. Then population 2 is 22. So MPP for population 2 is 22-10=12. Then for population 3, it's 36-22=14, right? MPP increases here. Then population 4: 52-36=16. Population 5: 70-52=18. Population 6: 90-70=20. Population 7: 108-90=18. Oh wait, that's interesting—the MPP starts to drop after 6. Then population 8: 124-108=16, and population 9: 135-124=11.

So the MPP is increasing up to population 6 and then decreases after that. Hmm, that might be a point to note.

Next, average physical product (APP) is total product divided by population. So for each population level, I take the total product and divide by the population (in thousands). Let me calculate that.

Population 1: 10 /1 =10. Population 2:22/2=11. Population 3:36/3=12. Population 4:52/4=13. Population 5:70/5=14. Population 6:90/6=15. Population7:108/7≈15.43. Population8:124/8=15.5. Population9:135/9=15.

Wait a second, so the average product peaks at population 8 with 15.5, but wait, wait: let me recalculate some because my initial calculations might be off.

Wait for population 7: 108 divided by 7 is approximately 15.428, which is about 15.43. Population 8 is 124/8=15.5. Population 9 is 135/9=15. So the average product increases up to 8, then drops at 9.

But wait, I thought that the maximum average product occurs where marginal equals average. Or is it when MPP equals APP? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Oh right, in production theory, the average product of labor is maximized where the MPP equals the APP. Because when MPP is above APP, adding more labor increases APP, and when MPP is below, adding more labor decreases APP.

So I should look for the point where MPP equals APP. Let's see the data:

Looking at each population level:

Population 1: APP=10, MPP for pop 2 is 12. So MPP (for pop 2) is higher than APP (10), so adding the second worker increases APP.

Population 2: APP=11, MPP for pop3 is 14, which is higher than 11. So adding third worker increases APP.

Population3: APP=12, MPP for pop4=16>12, so adding the fourth increases APP.

Population4: APP=13, MPP for pop5=18>13, so continue.

Population5: APP=14, MPP for pop6=20>14, so add.

Population6: APP=15, MPP for pop7=18>15. So add.

Population7: APP≈15.43, MPP for pop8=16>15.43, so add.

Population8: APP=15.5, MPP for pop9=11<15.5. So adding the ninth worker would cause APP to drop.

So the point where MPP equals APP is somewhere around when MPP crosses APP. Let's see, at population 8, APP is 15.5, MPP for pop9 is 11. So perhaps the maximum APP occurs at pop8.

Wait, but let me check the MPP and APP for each population. Let's make a table:

Population | Total Product | MPP (previous difference) | APP (TP/Pop)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 10 | - | 10
2 | 22 | 12 | 11
3 | 36 |14 |12
4 |52 |16 |13
5 |70 |18 |14
6 |90 |20 |15
7 |108 |18 |~15.43
8 |124 |16 |15.5
9 |135 |11 |15

Wait, for MPP, each row's MPP is the difference from the previous row. So for population 2, MPP is 12 (22-10), which is for the second worker. Similarly, MPP for population 3 is 14 (36-22), etc.

So the MPP for each population N is the difference between total product at N and N-1.

Now, to find where MPP equals APP. Let's see:

At each population level, see if MPP of that level equals the APP of the previous level or something else? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum average occurs where MPP is just about to drop below the APP.

Wait, let's list the MPP and APP for each population.

Looking at each level:

- Population 1: APP=10. MPP at 2 is 12. Since 12 >10, adding the second worker increases APP.

- Population 2: APP=11. MPP for 3 is14>11 → add third.

- Population3: APP=12. MPP4=16>12→ add.

- Population4: APP=13. MPP5=18>13→ add.

- Population5: APP=14. MPP6=20>14→ add.

- Population6: APP=15. MPP7=18>15→ add.

- Population7: APP≈15.43. MPP8=16>15.43 → add.

- Population8: APP=15.5. MPP9=11 <15.5 → don't add.

So the maximum average product occurs at population 8, because after that, adding more workers (pop9) causes APP to drop.

Wait, but when MPP equals APP, that's the point where adding another worker would cause APP to stop increasing. So let's check when MPP equals APP.

Looking at the data:

At population 7, MPP8=16, APP7≈15.43 → MPP (16) > APP (15.43) → so adding pop8 would increase APP.

At population8, MPP9=11, which is less than APP8=15.5. So the point where MPP=APP would be between pop7 and pop8, but since we're dealing with discrete units, the maximum APP is at pop8.

So the per capita income is highest at pop8, which is 15.5 thousand tons per thousand people.

Wait, but wait. The question asks for the "optimum" population, which is where per capita income is highest. So that's when average product is highest.

Looking back, the highest average product is 15.5 at population 8.

So the optimum population is 8 thousand people, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check. When pop is 7, APP is ~15.43; at 8, it's 15.5; at9, it's 15. So 8 is the peak.

Yes, so the answer should be D:8 thousand people.
</think>

To determine the "optimum" population (the level with the highest per capita income), we need to calculate the marginal physical product (MPP) and average physical product (APP) using the provided data. The MPP is the additional output produced by adding one more unit of labor, while the APP is the total physical product divided by the population.

### Calculations:
1. **Marginal Physical Product (MPP):**
   - MPP for each population level is the difference in total physical product between consecutive levels:
     - Population 2: \( 22 - 10 = 12 \)
     - Population 3: \( 36 - 22 = 14 \)
     - Population 4: \( 52 - 36 = 16 \)
     - Population 5: \( 70 - 52 = 18 \)
     - Population 6: \( 90 - 70 = 20 \)
     - Population 7: \( 108 - 90 = 18 \)
     - Population 8: \( 124 - 108 = 16 \)
     - Population 9: \( 135 - 124 = 11 \)

2. **Average Physical Product (APP):**
   - APP for each population level is the total physical product divided by the population:
     - Population 1: \( \frac{10}{1} = 10 \)
     - Population 2: \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \)
     - Population 3: \( \frac{36}{3} = 12 \)
     - Population 4: \( \frac{52}{4} = 13 \)
     - Population 5: \( \frac{70}{5} = 14 \)
     - Population 6: \( \frac{90}{6} = 15 \)
     - Population 7: \( \frac{108}{7} \approx 15.43 \)
     - Population 8: \( \frac{124}{8} = 15.5 \)
     - Population 9: \( \frac{135}{9} = 15 \)

### Analysis:
- The APP increases as the population grows, reaching its peak at a population of 8 thousand, where \( \text{APP} = 15.5 \). Beyond this point, at a population of 9 thousand, the APP declines to 15.
- The MPP initially increases but starts to decline after a population of 6 thousand. The MPP falls below the APP at a population of 9 thousand, indicating diminishing returns to labor.

### Conclusion:
The optimum population, where per capita income (APP) is maximized, is at a population of 8 thousand people.
