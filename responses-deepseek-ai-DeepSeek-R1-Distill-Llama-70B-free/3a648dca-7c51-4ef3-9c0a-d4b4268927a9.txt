Question:

A purchaser signed an agreement of sale to buy real estate. It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?

Options:

A: Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.
B: Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval  the first notice communicated is the effective one.
C: No, because the seller did not give the purchaser an opportunity to correct his mistake.
D: No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.
E: Yes, because the purchaser did not formally submit a mortgage application, violating the agreement.
F: No, because the approval of the belated application should allow the transaction to proceed.
G: Yes, because the purchaser did not fulfill the conditions of the contingency clause in the specified time.
H: No, because the amount of time that he was late was a "de minimus" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.
I: No, because the purchaser's discussion with a mortgage broker should be considered as an attempt to apply.
J: Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate question. Let me read through it again. The scenario is about a purchaser who signed an agreement of sale with a contingency clause. The contingency required him to make a completed mortgage application within a specified time, and it said time was of the essence. But instead of applying, he asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion on whether he'd qualify. Then the seller rescinded the sale because there was no application on time. Later, the purchaser applied and got approved, but the seller still wants to rescind. The question is whether the seller will prevail.

Hmm, so the key points here are the contingency clause and the time being of the essence. I remember that when time is of the essence, punctual performance is crucial. So if the condition isn't met on time, the other party can rescind.

The purchaser didn't make the application but instead asked a friend for an opinion. So he didn't submit a completed application. The contingency wasn't fulfilled by the deadline. So the seller rescinded. Then later, he applied and was approved, but after the deadline.

I think about the concept of contingency clauses. They usually require certain conditions to be met for the contract to proceed. If the condition isn't met, the contract can be rescinded. Also, when time is of the essence, even a short delay can be a material breach.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because he didn't apply timely and lost the contingency protection. That makes sense because the contingency requires timely application. He failed, so seller can rescind.

Option B: Yes, because she rescinded first. But I think the timing of the rescission isn't the main issue here; it's whether the condition was met.

Option C: No, because the seller didn't give a chance to correct. But the contingency clause is usually strict; maybe the seller doesn't have to give another chance once the time passes.

Option D: No, because talking to the broker was a timely application. But I don't think an informal discussion counts as a completed application. The clause probably requires an actual application.

Option E: Yes, because he didn't formally apply. That's similar to A. It fits because he didn't submit an application.

Option F: No, because the belated approval allows the transaction. But since the approval was after the deadline, maybe it's too late. Contingency is about meeting the condition on time.

Option G: Yes, because he didn't fulfill the contingency on time. This seems correct because the contingency requires timely completion.

Option H: No, because the delay was minor. But if time is of the essence, even a short delay might not be excused.

Option I: No, because discussing with a broker is an attempt. But I think the clause requires a completed application, not just an inquiry.

Option J: Yes, because seller can rescind anytime. No, the seller can't rescind anytime; they have to have a valid reason, like failure of a contingency.

So the main issue is whether the purchaser met the contingency on time. He didn't apply within the specified time, so he failed the contingency. The fact that he later got approved doesn't matter because the deadline passed.

So options A, E, G are all pointing towards the seller being able to rescind. Let me think about the exact terms. The question says the agreement required a completed application within a certain time. The purchaser didn't do that; he just asked for an opinion. So the contingency wasn't fulfilled.

Therefore, the correct answer should be either A, E, or G. Let me look at each:

A says because he didn't make a timely application, losing the contingency.

E says because he didn't formally submit, violating the agreement.

G says because he didn't fulfill the contingency in time.

All three seem correct, but maybe the best answer is G, as it directly addresses the contingency condition not being met in the specified time. Alternatively, E is about the formality of submission. But maybe in the law, the key is that the condition wasn't met on time, regardless of later attempts.

Wait, another thought: the contingency is a condition that must be satisfied. If the condition is not met, the contract can be rescinded. So the seller's right to rescind arises when the condition fails. Since the purchaser didn't make the application on time, the seller can rescind. So G is the most accurate.

Alternatively, A and E are also correct. But looking at the options, maybe G is more precise because it's about fulfilling the contingency condition in time.

I think the correct answer is either G or A. Let me check case law. Typically, if a contingency isn't met by the deadline, the contract can be terminated. So the seller can rescind because the condition was not satisfied on time. So the answer is G.

The scenario revolves around a real estate purchase agreement with a contingency clause requiring the purchaser to make a completed mortgage application within a specified time, emphasizing that "time is of the essence." The purchaser failed to submit a timely application, instead seeking an opinion from a mortgage broker friend. The seller rescinded the sale due to the missed deadline, and the purchaser later submitted a belated application and received approval. The question is whether the seller can prevail in rescinding the transaction.

Key points to consider:

1. **Contingency Clause and Time Being of the Essence**: The contingency required a completed mortgage application by a specific deadline. When "time is of the essence," punctual performance is critical, and failure to meet the deadline can result in the seller's right to rescind.

2. **Purchaser's Actions**: The purchaser did not submit a formal mortgage application within the specified time. Instead, he sought an opinion from a broker, which does not constitute a completed application as required by the contingency clause.

3. **Seller's Rescission**: The seller rescinded the sale after the deadline passed. The purchaser's subsequent approval of a belated application does not retroactively satisfy the contingency, as the condition must be met by the specified time.

Analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The purchaser failed to make a timely application, losing the protection of the contingency clause.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The timing of the seller's rescission is not the primary issue; the failure to meet the contingency deadline is the key factor.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The contingency clause is typically strict, and the seller is not obligated to give the purchaser an opportunity to correct the mistake after the deadline.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Discussing the application with a broker does not constitute a completed application as required by the contingency.
- **Option E**: Correct. The purchaser did not formally submit a mortgage application, violating the agreement.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The belated approval does not negate the failure to meet the contingency deadline.
- **Option G**: Correct. The purchaser did not fulfill the contingency condition within the specified time, which is the primary reason the seller can rescind.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Even a minor delay can be material when "time is of the essence."
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The purchaser's discussion with the broker does not satisfy the requirement for a completed application.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The seller cannot rescind at any time; they must have a valid reason, such as the failure of a contingency.

The most accurate answer is **Option G**, as it directly addresses the failure to fulfill the contingency condition within the specified time, which is the core issue in this case.

Answer: G
