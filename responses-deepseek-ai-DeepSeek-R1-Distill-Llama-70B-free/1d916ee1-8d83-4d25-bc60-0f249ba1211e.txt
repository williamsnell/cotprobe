Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s-1)^2 using convolution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but let me try to work through this.

First, I remember that the inverse Laplace transform, L⁻¹, is used to convert a function from the s-domain back to the time domain. The function given is 1/(s-1)^2. I think I should break this down into simpler terms if possible.

Wait, I recall that sometimes when you have something like 1/(s-a)^n, it relates to shifted functions in the time domain. Like, for n=1, L⁻¹{1/(s-a)} is e^{at}. But here, n is 2, so maybe it's related to a derivative or something.

Wait, another approach is to use convolution. The convolution theorem states that L⁻¹{F(s)G(s)} = (f * g)(t), where f and g are the inverse transforms of F and G respectively. So maybe I can split 1/(s-1)^2 into two functions whose product it is.

Let me think: 1/(s-1)^2 is the same as [1/(s-1)] * [1/(s-1)]. So F(s) = G(s) = 1/(s-1). Then the inverse Laplace of each is e^t, because L⁻¹{1/(s-1)} = e^{t}. So, applying the convolution theorem, the inverse transform would be the convolution of e^t with itself.

Right, so the convolution of two functions f and g is (f * g)(t) = ∫₀^t f(τ)g(t-τ) dτ. So in this case, f(τ) = e^{τ}, g(t-τ) = e^{t-τ}.

Putting it together: ∫₀^t e^{τ} * e^{t - τ} dτ. Let's simplify the integrand. e^{τ} * e^{t-τ} = e^{t}, because e^{τ} * e^{-τ} is 1. So the integrand is e^t.

So the integral becomes e^t * ∫₀^t dτ. The integral of dτ from 0 to t is just t. So the whole thing is e^t * t.

Wait, so the inverse Laplace transform is t e^t. Looking at the options, option E is t e^t. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it is using the formula for L⁻¹{1/(s-a)^n}. I think the general formula is L⁻¹{1/(s-a)^n} = (t^{n-1} e^{at}) / (n-1)! So for n=2, it would be (t e^{a t}) / 1! = t e^{a t}. Since a=1 here, it's t e^t. Yep, that confirms it. So the answer should be E.

To find the inverse Laplace transform \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{1}{(s-1)^2} \right\} \) using convolution, we start by recognizing that the given function can be expressed as the product of two identical functions:  
\[
\frac{1}{(s-1)^2} = \frac{1}{s-1} \cdot \frac{1}{s-1}.
\]  
Here, \( F(s) = G(s) = \frac{1}{s-1} \). The convolution theorem states that:  
\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ F(s)G(s) \right\} = (f * g)(t), 
\]  
where \( f(t) \) and \( g(t) \) are the inverse Laplace transforms of \( F(s) \) and \( G(s) \), respectively. For \( F(s) = \frac{1}{s-1} \), the inverse Laplace transform is \( f(t) = e^t \). Similarly, \( g(t) = e^t \).  

The convolution of \( f(t) \) and \( g(t) \) is given by:  
\[
(f * g)(t) = \int_0^t f(\tau)g(t-\tau) \, d\tau.
\]  
Substituting \( f(\tau) = e^\tau \) and \( g(t-\tau) = e^{t-\tau} \), we have:  
\[
(f * g)(t) = \int_0^t e^\tau \cdot e^{t-\tau} \, d\tau.
\]  
Simplifying the integrand:  
\[
e^\tau \cdot e^{t-\tau} = e^t.
\]  
Thus, the integral becomes:  
\[
\int_0^t e^t \, d\tau = e^t \cdot \int_0^t d\tau = e^t \cdot t.
\]  
Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform is \( t e^t \).  

This result is consistent with the general formula for the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{(s-a)^n} \), which is \( \frac{t^{n-1} e^{at}}{(n-1)!} \). For \( n=2 \) and \( a=1 \), this gives \( t e^t \).  

From the given options, the correct answer is **E: \( t e^t \)**.
