Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a particle's motion, and I need to find its velocity, acceleration, and their magnitudes at time t=0. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem gives me the position equations: x = sin(2t), y = cos(2t)(1?), wait, wait, maybe it's cos(2t) multiplied by something. Oh, looking again, the equation is written as y = cos2t(1). Wait, that's a bit unclear. Oh, wait, perhaps it's y = cos(2t). Because the way it's written is y=cos2t(1). Maybe that's a typo, and it's just y = cos(2t). And z = e^(-t). Okay, that makes sense.

So the position vector r(t) is [sin(2t), cos(2t), e^(-t)].

Now, the first part is to determine the velocity. Velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time. So I'll need to find the derivatives of each component.

Let's find the derivatives:

dx/dt = derivative of sin(2t) with respect to t. The derivative of sin(u) is cos(u)*du/dt. So u=2t, du/dt=2. So dx/dt = 2 cos(2t).

dy/dt = derivative of cos(2t). The derivative of cos(u) is -sin(u)*du/dt. So dy/dt = -2 sin(2t).

dz/dt = derivative of e^(-t). The derivative of e^u is e^u * du/dt. Here, u=-t, so du/dt=-1. So dz/dt = -e^(-t).

So the velocity vector v(t) is [2 cos(2t), -2 sin(2t), -e^(-t)].

Next, acceleration is the derivative of velocity, so the second derivative of position.

Find the derivatives of each component of v(t):

d²x/dt² = derivative of 2 cos(2t). That's 2 * (-sin(2t))*2 = -4 sin(2t).

d²y/dt² = derivative of (-2 sin(2t)). That's -2 * cos(2t)*2 = -4 cos(2t). Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. The derivative of sin(u) is cos(u)*du/dt. So derivative of -2 sin(2t) is -2 * 2 cos(2t) = -4 cos(2t).

d²z/dt² = derivative of -e^(-t). Again, the derivative of e^(-t) is -e^(-t), so derivative of -e^(-t) is e^(-t).

So acceleration a(t) is [-4 sin(2t), -4 cos(2t), e^(-t)].

Now, the problem asks for the velocity and acceleration at t=0, and their magnitudes.

Let's compute each component at t=0.

For velocity v(0):

dx/dt at t=0: 2 cos(0) = 2*1=2.

dy/dt at t=0: -2 sin(0) = 0.

dz/dt at t=0: -e^0 = -1.

So v(0) is (2, 0, -1).

Acceleration a(0):

d²x/dt² at t=0: -4 sin(0) = 0.

d²y/dt² at t=0: -4 cos(0) = -4*1 = -4.

d²z/dt² at t=0: e^0 = 1.

So a(0) is (0, -4, 1).

Now, find the magnitudes of these vectors.

Magnitude of velocity: |v| = sqrt( (2)^2 + (0)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 0 +1) = sqrt(5).

Magnitude of acceleration: |a| = sqrt( (0)^2 + (-4)^2 + (1)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + 16 +1) = sqrt(17).

Now, let me look at the options to find which one matches. Let's check each option.

Option A: velocity (0,2,-1), no, my velocity is (2,0,-1). So not A.

Option B: velocity (2,0,-1), acceleration (0,-4,1). Magnitudes sqrt(5) and sqrt(17). Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Option E: velocity same as B, but magnitudes 2 and 4. That's not right because sqrt(5) is about 2.236, and sqrt(17) is about 4.123. So E's magnitudes are wrong.

Other options: Let me quickly scan others.

Option B seems correct.

Wait, wait. Let me check if I made any mistakes in the derivatives.

Wait, for y = cos(2t). dy/dt is -2 sin(2t), correct. So at t=0, dy/dt is 0. So y component of velocity is 0. So velocity is (2,0,-1).

Acceleration: the second derivatives. x's second derivative is -4 sin(2t), at t=0, sin(0)=0. y's second derivative is -4 cos(2t), at t=0, cos(0)=1, so it's -4. z's second derivative is e^{-t}, so at t=0, it's 1.

So acceleration is (0, -4, 1). Correct.

Magnitudes: velocity is sqrt(4 + 0 +1) = sqrt(5). Acceleration sqrt(0 + 16 +1) = sqrt(17). So option B.

Looking back at the options, option B has velocity (2,0,-1), acceleration (0,-4,1), with magnitudes sqrt(5) and sqrt(17). So that's correct.

To solve the problem, we start with the position equations of the particle:

\[
x = \sin(2t), \quad y = \cos(2t), \quad z = e^{-t}.
\]

### 1. Velocity of the particle
The velocity is the first derivative of the position vector with respect to time \(t\). Computing the derivatives of each component:

- \( \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \sin(2t) = 2\cos(2t), \)
- \( \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \cos(2t) = -2\sin(2t), \)
- \( \frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} e^{-t} = -e^{-t}. \)

Thus, the velocity vector is:

\[
v(t) = \left( 2\cos(2t), -2\sin(2t), -e^{-t} \right).
\]

### 2. Acceleration of the particle
The acceleration is the second derivative of the position vector with respect to time \(t\). Computing the derivatives of each component of the velocity:

- \( \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 2\cos(2t) \right) = -4\sin(2t), \)
- \( \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -2\sin(2t) \right) = -4\cos(2t), \)
- \( \frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( -e^{-t} \right) = e^{-t}. \)

Thus, the acceleration vector is:

\[
a(t) = \left( -4\sin(2t), -4\cos(2t), e^{-t} \right).
\]

### 3. Magnitudes of velocity and acceleration at \(t = 0\)
At \(t = 0\):

- \( v(0) = \left( 2\cos(0), -2\sin(0), -e^{0} \right) = (2, 0, -1), \)
- \( a(0) = \left( -4\sin(0), -4\cos(0), e^{0} \right) = (0, -4, 1). \)

The magnitudes are:

- \( |v| = \sqrt{(2)^2 + (0)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 0 + 1} = \sqrt{5}, \)
- \( |a| = \sqrt{(0)^2 + (-4)^2 + (1)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 16 + 1} = \sqrt{17}. \)

### Final Answer
Comparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is:

**B: Velocity is \((2, 0, -1)\), acceleration is \((0, -4, 1)\), velocity magnitude is \(\sqrt{5}\), acceleration magnitude is \(\sqrt{17}\).**
