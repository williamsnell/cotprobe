Okay, so I have this question about the Saffir-Simpson scale and hurricanes. Hmm, I remember that the Saffir-Simpson scale categorizes hurricanes based on their wind speed, central pressure, and potential damage. The question is asking for the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have according to this scale.

Wait, I think the scale starts at Category 1. Let me try to recall the categories. Category 1 is the lowest, right? So what's the wind speed for Category 1? I believe it's between 74 mph and something higher, like maybe 95 or 100. Oh wait, no, I think the categories go up higher. Let me think: Category 1 is 74-95 mph, Category 2 is 96-110, Category 3 is 111-129, and so on.

But wait, the question is about the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have. So that would be the minimum speed to be classified as a hurricane. I remember that tropical cyclones with winds below 74 mph are called tropical storms. So a hurricane must have winds of at least 74 mph. That means the slowest wind speed a hurricane can have is 74 mph.

Looking at the options, F is 74 mph. So the answer should be F.

The Saffir-Simpson scale categorizes hurricanes based on wind speed, with Category 1 being the lowest. A hurricane must have wind speeds of at least 74 mph; below that, it's classified as a tropical storm. Thus, the slowest wind speed for a hurricane is 74 mph.

Answer: F
