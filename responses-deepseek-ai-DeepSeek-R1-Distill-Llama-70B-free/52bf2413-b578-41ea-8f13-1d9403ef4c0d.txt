Okay, so I've got this Fourier series problem here. The question is about finding the Fourier cosine series for f(x) = x over the interval 0 < x < c. Hmm, I remember that Fourier series can be a bit tricky, especially when dealing with different intervals and whether the function is even or odd.

Wait, Fourier cosine series usually come into play when we're dealing with even functions, right? But our function here is f(x) = x, which is an odd function. Oh wait, but the interval given is from 0 to c, so I think we're extending the function as an even function. Because for Fourier cosine series, we consider the function to be even, extending it symmetrically about the y-axis.

So the general approach is to find the Fourier cosine series of f(x) on the interval [0, c]. I recall that the Fourier series coefficients for the cosine series are calculated using integrals from 0 to c.

The formula for the Fourier cosine series is f(x) ≈ a0/2 + sum from n=1 to infinity of an cos(nπx/c), where:

a0 = (2/c) * ∫ from 0 to c of f(x) dx

and

an = (2/c) * ∫ from 0 to c of f(x) cos(nπx/c) dx.

Alright, let's compute these coefficients.

First, compute a0:

a0 = (2/c) * ∫ x dx from 0 to c.

The integral of x dx is (1/2)x² evaluated from 0 to c, which is (1/2)c². So,

a0 = (2/c) * (1/2)c² = (2/c)(c²/2) = c.

So the a0 term is c, and when we take a0/2, that's c/2.

Next, compute an:

an = (2/c) * ∫ x cos(nπx/c) dx from 0 to c.

Hmm, integrating x cos(ax) dx. I think integration by parts is needed here. Let me set u = x, dv = cos(ax) dx. Then du = dx, and v = (1/a) sin(ax).

So, ∫ x cos(ax) dx = uv - ∫ v du = x*(1/a) sin(ax) - ∫ (1/a) sin(ax) dx.

The integral becomes (x/a) sin(ax) + (1/a²) cos(ax)) + C.

Applying the limits from 0 to c:

At x = c:
(c/a) sin(ac) + (1/a²) cos(ac)
At x = 0:
(0) + (1/a²) cos(0) = (1/a²)(1) = 1/a².

So the definite integral from 0 to c is [ (c/a) sin(ac) + (1/a²)(cos(ac) -1) ].

Wait, let's plug in a = nπ/c, because in our case, a is nπ/c. So:

Integral from 0 to c of x cos(nπx/c) dx = [ (c/(nπ/c)) sin(nπ) + (1/( (nπ/c)^2 )) (cos(nπ) -1) ) ].

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, the term (x/a) sin(ax) evaluated at c:

x = c, a = nπ/c → (c / (nπ/c)) ) * sin(nπ) = (c^2 / nπ) * sin(nπ).

But sin(nπ) is zero for all integer n. So this term is zero.

Then, the term (1/a²) [cos(ac) - 1] evaluated at a = nπ/c.

Wait, a is nπ/c, so ac = nπ. So cos(ac) is cos(nπ), which is (-1)^n.

So the integral becomes (1/( (nπ/c)^2 )) [ (-1)^n - 1 ].

So, putting it all together:

∫ x cos(nπx/c) dx from 0 to c = (c^2 / (nπ)^2) [ (-1)^n - 1 ].

Wait, because 1/(a²) is 1/( (nπ/c)^2 ) = c²/(n²π²).

So the integral is (c²/(n²π²)) [ (-1)^n -1 ].

Now, multiply this by (2/c) to get an:

an = (2/c) * (c²/(n²π²)) [ (-1)^n -1 ].

Simplify:

an = (2 c²)/(c n² π²) [ (-1)^n -1 ]

= (2 c)/(n² π²) [ (-1)^n -1 ].

Hmm, let's factor this:

[ (-1)^n -1 ] can be written as - (1 - (-1)^n ). So,

an = (2c)/(n² π²) * [ - (1 - (-1)^n) ] 

= - (2c (1 - (-1)^n )) / (n² π²).

Wait, 1 - (-1)^n is zero when n is even because (-1)^n is 1. So this term is non-zero only when n is odd. Because when n is odd, (-1)^n is -1, so 1 - (-1)^n = 2.

So, for even n, an is zero. For odd n, an is:

an = - (2c (2) ) / (n² π² ) = -4c / (n² π²).

Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, when n is even, 1 - (-1)^n is 0, so an=0.

When n is odd, 1 - (-1)^n = 2, so:

an = (2c/(n² π²)) * (- (2)) ) → an = -4c/(n² π²).

So, the Fourier series will only have terms where n is odd. So we can write the sum by letting n be 2k+1, where k starts from 0.

Wait, but in the expression for the series, the sum is over n from 1 to infinity, but because an is zero for even n, we can rewrite the sum as sum over k from 0 to infinity, with n = 2k+1.

Thus, the Fourier series becomes:

f(x) ≈ (c/2) + sum_{k=0}^∞ [ -4c/( (2k+1)^2 π² ) ] cos( (2k+1) π x / c )

Wait, but wait the cosine terms in the sum. Let me reindex. Let me let n be an odd integer, so n = 2k + 1 with k starting at 0.

So the sum becomes:

sum_{k=0}^\infty [ -4c/( (2k+1)^2 π² ) ] cos( (2k+1) π x / c )

But wait, in the options, some have the sum starting at k=1. Oh, but when k starts at 0, n starts at 1 as 2k+1=1, which is correct.

Wait, but the options have sums with n or k starting at different points. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: sum starts at k=0, terms are cos( (2k+1)πx/c ), denominator (2k+1)^2. Coefficients 4c/π².

Our expression has a negative sign and 4c/π² factor. Hmm.

Wait, let's write the Fourier series expression again.

From our calculation:

f(x) = c/2 + sum_{n=1}^\infty [ -4c/(n² π²) ] * (1 - (-1)^n)/2 ? Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, no, wait the sum over all n of an cos(nπx/c) is equivalent to sum over k of [ terms where n=2k+1 ]

So, the series is:

f(x) = c/2 + sum_{k=0}^\infty [ -4c/( (2k+1)^2 π² ) ] cos( (2k+1) π x/c )

Which can be written as:

f(x) = c/2 - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Looking at the options, option B matches this except for the sign in front.

Option B says:

(4c/π²) sum starting at k=0, with cos terms, and the coefficient is positive. But in our case, it's negative.

So, our expression is:

(c/2) - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Looking at the options:

Option B is: (c/2) + (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos( (2k+1)πx/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

So the sign is opposite.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the sign when computing an?

Let me go back. When I computed an, I had:

an = (2/c) * [ integral from 0 to c x cos(nπx/c) dx ]

The integral was [ (c/(nπ/c)) sin(nπ) + (c²/(n² π²)) (cos(nπ) -1) ]

But sin(nπ) is zero, so the integral is (c²/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n - 1 )

So,

an = (2/c) * (c²/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n -1 )

= (2 c)/(n² π²) ( (-1)^n -1 )

= (2 c)/(n² π²) [ - (1 - (-1)^n ) ]

= - (2 c (1 - (-1)^n )) / (n² π² )

So, for each n, an is negative times (1 - (-1)^n) over n squared.

So, when n is even, 1 - (-1)^n = 0, so an=0.

When n is odd, 1 - (-1)^n = 2, so an = - (4 c) / (n^2 π^2 )

So, the series is:

f(x) = a0/2 + sum_{n=1}^\infty an cos(nπx/c )

= c/2 + sum_{n=1}^\infty [ -4c/(n^2 π^2) ] * [ (1 - (-1)^n)/2 ] cos(nπx/c )

Wait, no, because for each n, the term is an cos(nπx/c ), and an is zero for even n, so the sum only has odd terms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the sum starting at n=1, but only over odd n.

Wait, but in the expression, the sum is over all n from 1 to infinity, but an is zero for even n, so only odd terms contribute.

So, the series can be written as:

f(x) = c/2 - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos( (2k+1) πx/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Because for each k, n=2k+1 is odd, and each term is -4c/(n² π²) cos(nπx/c).

So comparing to the options, let me look again.

Option B is:

(1/2)c + (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos( (2k+1)πx/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Which has a positive coefficient, but our calculation has a negative.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute the integral.

The integral ∫ x cos(nπx/c) dx from 0 to c.

I had:

= [ (x c^2)/(n π) sin(n π) ) ] from 0 to c → which is zero because sin(nπ)=0.

Plus [ c²/(n² π²) (cos(n π) - 1) ]

So, the integral is (c²/(n² π²))( cos(n π) -1 )

So,

an = (2/c) * (c²/(n² π²))( cos(n π) -1 )

= (2 c)/(n² π²) ( (-1)^n -1 )

So,

an = (2 c/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n -1 )

Which is:

= (2 c/(n² π²)) ( - (1 - (-1)^n) )

= - (2 c (1 - (-1)^n )) / (n² π² )

So, yes, an is negative for each n, but only non-zero when n is odd.

So the Fourier series is:

f(x) = c/2 + sum_{n=1}^\infty [ - (2 c (1 - (-1)^n )) / (n² π² ) ] cos(n π x/c )

But since 1 - (-1)^n is zero when n even, and 2 when n odd, this becomes:

For n odd:

an = - (2 c * 2 ) / (n² π² ) = -4 c/(n² π² )

So, f(x) = c/2 - (4 c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos( (2k+1) π x/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Looking back at the options, which option matches this?

Option B is:

(1/2)c + (4 c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos(...) / (2k+1)^2 ]

So positive sign, which doesn't match.

Option D is:

(1/2)c - (4 c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos(...) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Which matches our result except that the sum starts at k=0. So the correct expression is option B has a plus, but our calculation has a minus. So the correct option would be option D?

Wait, let me check option D:

D: (1/2)c - (4c/π²) sum_{k=0}^\infty [ cos( (2k+1)πx/c ) / (2k+1)^2 ]

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So option D is the correct one.

Wait, but earlier I thought option B was close except for the sign. So perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option D is:

D: f(x) \sim (1 / 2)c - (4c / \pi^2)\infty\sum_k=0 [{cos[(2k + 1)\pix/ c]} / (2k + 1)^2]

Yes, that's exactly what we derived.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To find the Fourier cosine series of \( f(x) = x \) over the interval \( 0 < x < c \), we recognize that the function is extended as an even function. The Fourier cosine series is given by:

\[
f(x) \sim \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{c}\right),
\]

where the coefficients \( a_0 \) and \( a_n \) are calculated as:

\[
a_0 = \frac{2}{c} \int_0^c x \, dx,
\]
\[
a_n = \frac{2}{c} \int_0^c x \cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{c}\right) dx.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( a_0 \)
\[
a_0 = \frac{2}{c} \int_0^c x \, dx = \frac{2}{c} \left[\frac{x^2}{2}\right]_0^c = \frac{2}{c} \cdot \frac{c^2}{2} = c.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{a_0}{2} = \frac{c}{2} \).

### Step 2: Compute \( a_n \)
Using integration by parts for \( \int_0^c x \cos\left(\frac{n\pi x}{c}\right) dx \), we find:

\[
a_n = \frac{2}{c} \cdot \frac{c^2}{n^2\pi^2} \left[(-1)^n - 1\right].
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a_n = \frac{2c}{n^2\pi^2} \left[(-1)^n - 1\right].
\]

For even \( n \), \( (-1)^n = 1 \), so \( a_n = 0 \). For odd \( n \), \( (-1)^n = -1 \), so:

\[
a_n = -\frac{4c}{n^2\pi^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Rewrite the series
Since \( a_n = 0 \) for even \( n \), the series can be rewritten by summing over odd \( n \). Let \( n = 2k + 1 \) with \( k \geq 0 \). The Fourier cosine series becomes:

\[
f(x) \sim \frac{c}{2} - \frac{4c}{\pi^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi x}{c}\right)}{(2k+1)^2}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options, the correct match is:

**D: \( f(x) \sim \frac{1}{2}c - \frac{4c}{\pi^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\cos\left(\frac{(2k+1)\pi x}{c}\right)}{(2k+1)^2} \).**

This matches the derived expression exactly.
