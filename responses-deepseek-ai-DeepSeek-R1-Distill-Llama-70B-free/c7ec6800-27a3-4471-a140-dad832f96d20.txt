Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this group theory question. Let's take it step by step. 

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1: If H and K are subgroups of G and one of H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.

Hmm, I remember that for HK to be a subgroup, it must satisfy the subgroup criteria. HK is the set of all products hk where h is in H and k is in K. 

I think there's a theorem that says if either H is normal in G or K is normal in G, then HK is a subgroup. Wait, but does that always hold? Or does it require that one is normal in the other? Oh right, I think the condition is that if one of them is normal in G, then HK is a subgroup. Because, suppose H is normal. Then for any h in H and k in K, we have k h k^{-1} is in H. So when you multiply elements from H and K, the product remains closed because of the normal subgroup property.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. I remember that if H and K are subgroups and one is normal, then HK is a subgroup. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose G is the symmetric group S3. Let H be the normal subgroup A3 (the alternating group), which is normal in S3. Let K be a Sylow 2-subgroup, say of order 2. Then HK would be A3 times a transposition. Since A3 is normal, HK should be a subgroup. But wait, in S3, A3 is of order 3, K is order 2. HK would have order 6, which is the entire group S3. So yeah, HK is a subgroup here.

Another example: Let G be any group, H a normal subgroup, K any subgroup. Then HK is a subgroup. Because the normality ensures that HK = KH, and the product is closed. So I think Statement 1 is True.

Wait, but what if neither is normal? Then HK isn't necessarily a subgroup. But the statement says that if one is normal, so yes, it holds. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: All groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian.

I remember that groups of order p^2 are Abelian. Because for a prime p, the order is p squared. Let me think about the structure. If p is prime, the group must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group Z_{p^2} or the direct product Z_p × Z_p.

Wait, but are there any non-Abelian groups of order p^2? For example, when p=2, the Klein four-group is Abelian. For p=3, the Heisenberg group? No, wait, that's order 3^3. Wait, no, groups of order p^2 have exponent p, and their center is nontrivial. Let me recall the classification. The fundamental theorem of finite Abelian groups says that every finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups. So for order p^2, it's either Z_{p^2} or Z_p × Z_p.

But wait, could there be a non-Abelian group of order p^2? Let me think about semidirect products. For a group of order p^2, the only possible way is if it's the direct product, because otherwise, if it's a semidirect product, it would require a nontrivial action, but for elementary Abelian groups, all extensions are trivial. So I think all groups of order p^2 are Abelian. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait a second. What about p=2? The dihedral group of order 8? No, that's order 8, which is 2^3, so not p^2. So for p^2, the only groups are Abelian. So Statement 2 is True.

So both statements are True. Looking at the options, option D says both are True. Option I says Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False, which can't be right.

Wait, wait another thought. Did I get Statement 1 right? Because I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact condition. The exact theorem: If H and K are subgroups of G and H is normal in G, then HK is a subgroup. Because HK is the product, and since H is normal, HK = KH, so the product is closed and HK is a subgroup.

Yes, that's correct. So Statement 1 is True.

So both statements are True, so the correct option is D: True, True.

Statement 1: If \( H \) and \( K \) are subgroups of \( G \) and one of \( H \) or \( K \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \), then \( HK \) is a subgroup of \( G \).

This statement is true. For \( HK \) to be a subgroup, it must satisfy the subgroup criteria, including closure, identity, inverses, and associativity. If either \( H \) or \( K \) is normal in \( G \), the product \( HK \) is guaranteed to be a subgroup. For example, if \( H \) is normal in \( G \), then \( kHk^{-1} = H \) for all \( k \in K \), ensuring that \( HK \) is closed under multiplication. This satisfies the subgroup conditions, making \( HK \) a subgroup of \( G \).

Statement 2: All groups of order \( p^2 \), where \( p \) is prime, are Abelian.

This statement is also true. For a prime \( p \), a group of order \( p^2 \) must be isomorphic to either the cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_{p^2} \) or the direct product \( \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p \). Both of these groups are Abelian. There are no non-Abelian groups of order \( p^2 \), as any such group would require a nontrivial semidirect product structure, which is not possible for groups of order \( p^2 \).

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is:

**D: True, True**
