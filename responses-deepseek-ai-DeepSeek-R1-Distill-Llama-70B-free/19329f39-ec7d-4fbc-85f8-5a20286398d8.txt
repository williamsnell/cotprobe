Okay, so I've got this problem about an automobile's connecting shaft. The question is about finding the suitable standard diameter for the shaft based on the given parameters. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that the power being transmitted is 120 horsepower. But wait, I remember that in mechanical systems, horsepower needs to be converted into actual power units for calculations. Oh right, 1 horsepower is about 745.7 watts, so 120 hp would be 120 * 745.7. Let me calculate that. 120 * 700 is 84,000, and 120 * 45.7 is 5,484. So adding them gives around 89,484 watts. So approximately 89,484 watts.

Next, the shaft is rotating at 300 rpm. I think I need to find the torque here because power is related to torque and angular velocity. The formula that comes to mind is Power = Torque * Angular Velocity. But wait, the units have to be consistent. Angular velocity in rpm needs to be converted into radians per second.

So, 300 rpm to radians per second. Since one revolution is 2π radians, 300 rpm is 300 * 2π radians per minute. To get per second, divide by 60. So, (300 * 2π) / 60 = 5π * 10 = 50π radians per second. Approximately 157.08 radians per second.

Now, using the power formula: Power (P) = Torque (T) * Angular Velocity (ω). So, rearranging for torque: T = P / ω. Plugging in the numbers: T = 89,484 W / 157.08 rad/s. Let me compute that. 89,484 divided by 157 is roughly 570.5. Wait, let me do it more accurately. 157.08 * 570 = let's see, 157 * 500 is 78,500, 157*70=10,990 → total 89,490. Oh, that's close to 89,484. So torque is approximately 570.5 N·m.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Oh no, I think I messed up the units earlier. Because the power I have is in watts, which is joules per second, and torque is in N·m, which is kg·m²/s². So when you divide watts (kg·m²/s³) by radians per second (which is 1/s), you get kg·m²/s², which is correct for torque. So my calculation seems right.

Now, moving on to the shear stress part. The problem states that the shear stress is 6500 psi. Shear stress (τ) is related to torque (T) and the polar moment of inertia (J) of the shaft. The formula is τ = (T * r) / J, where r is the radius of the shaft. But wait, I think the formula is τ = T * r / J. But the polar moment J for a solid shaft is (π/2) * d^4, where d is the diameter. Or wait, J is π d^4 / 32 for a solid shaft. Let me confirm: J = π d^4 / 32. So, substituting into the shear stress formula, we get τ = (T * (d/2)) / (π d^4 /32). Let me simplify that.

So τ = (T * d/2) * (32)/(π d^4) ). The d's will cancel out. Let's see: (T * d) * 32 / (2 * π d^4) → Wait, wait, wait. Let me write it again. τ = T * (d/2) / ( (π d^4)/32 ). So, that's T * (d/2) * 32 / (π d^4 ). So, T * 16 / (π d^3 ). Because (d/2) *32 is 16 d, and denominator is π d^4 → 16 d / (π d^4) → 16/(π d^3).

So, τ = (16 T) / (π d^3 ). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. J for a solid shaft is (π d^4 ) /32. So, J = π d^4 /32. Then, τ = (T * r)/J → since r is d/2, τ = (T*(d/2)) / (π d^4 /32) ) → T*(d/2) *32/(π d^4) ) → T * 16 d / (π d^4 ) → T *16/(π d^3 ). So yes, τ = (16 T) / (π d^3 ).

So, solving for d: d^3 = (16 T) / (π τ ). Plugging the numbers in, T is 570.5 N·m, τ is 6500 psi. Wait, but wait, the units. Are they compatible? Let me think. Because in the formula, I've been using SI units, but the shear stress is given in psi, which is pounds per square inch. So I need to convert that to Pascals.

Right, 1 psi is about 6894.76 Pascals. So 6500 psi is 6500 * 6894.76 Pa. Let me compute that. 6500 * 6894.76 → Let's approximate. 6000 * 6894.76 is 41,368,560. 500*6894.76 is 3,447,380 → total about 44,815,940 Pa, which is roughly 44.816 MPa.

So τ is 44.816e6 Pascals.

Now plug into d^3 = (16 * T) / (π * τ ). T is 570.5 N·m.

So, d^3 = (16 * 570.5) / (π * 44.816e6 ). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

16 * 570.5 = 9,128.

Denominator: π * 44.816e6 ≈ 3.1416 * 44.816e6 ≈ 140.8e6 → approximately 140.8 million.

So d^3 = 9,128 / 140.8e6 → Let's compute that. 9,128 ÷ 140.8e6 → 9,128 ÷ 140,800,000 = approximately 0.0000648 m^3.

Wait, 1 m^3 is (1000 mm)^3 = 1e9 mm³. So 0.0000648 m³ is 64.8 liters? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 m³ is 1e9 mm³, so 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So 0.0000648 m³ is 64.8e-3 m³ → 64.8 liters? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 0.0000648 m³ is 0.0648 liters, which is 64.8 cubic centimeters. Hmm, but I'm looking for the diameter in inches. Wait, maybe I made a unit mistake. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of 16*T/(pi*tau). Let me recompute.

T is 570.5 N·m.

tau is 44.816e6 Pa.

So 16 * 570.5 = 9,128 N·m.

Denominator: pi * 44.816e6 → 3.1416 * 44.816e6 ≈ 140.8e6 N/m².

So d^3 = 9,128 / 140.8e6 → Let me compute this as:

9,128 ÷ 140,800,000 = 0.0000648 m^3.

Wait, 1 m^3 is (1 m)^3 = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So 0.0000648 m^3 is 64.8 cm³.

Wait, but diameter is in inches. Wait, perhaps I should express d^3 in terms of inches. Because the options are in inches.

Wait, but in the formula, I used SI units. So d would be in meters. Let me compute d in meters.

d^3 = 0.0000648 m³ → cube root of 0.0000648 is needed.

Cube root of 0.0000648 m³ → Let me compute.

0.0000648 m³ = 64.8e-6 m³.

The cube root of 64.8e-6 is (64.8)^(1/3) * 1e-2. Because (a * 1e-6)^(1/3) = a^(1/3) * 1e-2.

What's the cube root of 64.8? Well, 4^3 is 64, so cube root of 64 is 4. 64.8 is a little more, so maybe 4.01 m? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 4^3 is 64, so 4.0 m would be 64,000,000 m³, which is way bigger than our 0.0000648 m³. Wait, no, this can't be right. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, 1 m is 100 cm, so 1 m³ is 1e6 liters? No, 1 m³ is 1000 liters because 1 m³ = 10^3 liters. Wait, but 0.0000648 m³ is 64.8 liters? That can't be, because 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 0.0000648 m³ is 0.0648 liters, which is 64.8 milliliters. Oh, okay.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just calculate the cube root of 0.0000648 m³.

Compute d^3 = 0.0000648 m³.

d = cube root(0.0000648) meters.

Let me compute 0.0000648^(1/3). Let me think in terms of exponents.

0.0000648 = 6.48e-5.

So, cube root is (6.48)^(1/3) multiplied by (1e-5)^(1/3).

(1e-5)^(1/3) = 1e-5/3 ≈ 1e-1.6667 ≈ 0.02154.

Cube root of 6.48 is approximately 1.866, because 1.8^3 is 5.832, 1.86^3 ≈ (1.8^3) + ... Let me compute 1.866^3: 1.866 * 1.866 is about 3.48, multiplied by 1.866 again gives around 6.48. So yes, cube root of 6.48 is about 1.866.

So, 1.866 * 0.02154 ≈ 0.0402 meters. So d ≈ 0.0402 meters, which is 4.02 centimeters. Wait, that's 1.58 inches. But looking at the options, the closest is D:1.5 in or I:2.5 in. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me go back.

The formula I used was τ = 16 T / (π d^3 ), but wait, another approach is to use the formula for torsional shear stress: τ = (T * r) / J, and J for a solid shaft is π d^4 / 32.

So, τ = (T * (d/2)) / ( π d^4 /32 ). Let me rearrange this:

τ = (T * d / 2 ) * (32) / (π d^4 )

Simplify: (32 T d) / (2 π d^4 ) → (16 T) / ( π d^3 )

So the formula seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the units when converting psi to Pascals. Let me recheck that.

1 psi = 6894.76 Pascals. So 6500 psi is 6500 * 6894.76 Pa.

Calculating: 6000 * 6894.76 = 41,368,560 Pa.

500 * 6894.76 = 3,447,380 Pa.

Adding them: 41,368,560 + 3,447,380 = 44,815,940 Pa, which is 44.81594 MPa.

So that's correct.

Now, using the formula, τ = (16 T) / ( π d^3 )

We can solve for d:

d^3 = (16 T) / ( π τ )

Plugging in the numbers:

16 * T = 16 * 570.5 = 9,128 N·m.

Denominator: π * 44,815,940 ≈ 3.1416 * 44,815,940 ≈ let's compute 44,815,940 * 3 = 134,447,820, and 44,815,940 * 0.1416 ≈ 6,342,000. So total denominator is approximately 140,789,820 N/m².

So d^3 = 9,128 / 140,789,820 → Let me compute that.

9,128 ÷ 140,789,820 ≈ 0.0000648 m³.

So d = cube root (0.0000648) meters.

Wait, 0.0000648 m³ is 64.8 cm³. Because 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³, so 0.0000648 m³ is 64.8 cm³.

The cube root of 64.8 cm³ is the diameter. Wait, no, because 1 cm³ is (0.1 m)^3. So 64.8 cm³ is 64.8e-6 m³, which is the same as 0.0000648 m³, which matches.

So, the cube root of 64.8 cm³ is 4 cm, because 4^3 is 64. So d is 4 cm, which is 0.04 m, or 1.57 inches. Wait, 4 cm is approximately 1.57 inches. Looking at the options, D is 1.5 in, I is 2.5 in, which is larger. Hmm, but perhaps I should check if I missed a step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting torque. Let me double-check the torque calculation.

Power is 120 hp. 1 hp is 745.7 W, so 120 * 745.7 = 89,484 W.

Angular velocity ω is 300 rpm. To convert to radians per second: 300 * 2π /60 = 10π rad/s ≈ 31.416 rad/s.

Wait wait wait, earlier I thought it was 50π, but that's wrong. Let me recompute ω.

300 rpm is 300 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians.

So, 300 * 2π = 600π radians per minute. To get per second, divide by 60. So 600π /60 = 10π rad/s, which is about 31.416 rad/s.

Oh! I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 50π, but it's actually 10π. So ω is about 31.416 rad/s.

So earlier, when I calculated torque as T = P/ω = 89,484 W / 31.416 rad/s → That's a big difference. So let's recalculate that.

89,484 / 31.416 → Let me compute that.

31.416 * 2850 = Let's see, 31.416 * 2800 = 87,  (Wait, 31.416 * 2800 = 31.416 * 28 * 100 = 31.416 * 28 is 879.648 → 879.648 * 100 = 87,964.8 W). So 2800 rad/s would give 87,964.8 W. But we have 89,484 W, which is 1,519.2 W higher.

So, 1,519.2 /31.416 ≈ 48.36. So total torque T is 2800 + 48.36 ≈ 2848.36 N·m.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got around 570 N·m, but with the corrected ω, it's 2848 N·m. That's a big difference. So where did I go wrong before? Oh, I see. I must have miscalculated ω earlier. So, it's 10π rad/s, not 50π. So my initial torque calculation was wrong. That changes everything.

So with the correct ω of 31.416 rad/s, the torque T is 89,484 /31.416 ≈ 2848.36 N·m.

So now, back to the shear stress formula.

τ = 16 T / ( π d^3 )

We have τ = 6500 psi = 44,815,940 Pa.

So, rearranging for d^3:

d^3 = (16 * T) / ( π * τ )

Plugging in the numbers:

16 * 2848.36 = 45,573.76 N·m.

Denominator: π * 44,815,940 ≈ 3.1416 * 44,815,940 ≈ 140,789,820 Pa.

So d^3 = 45,573.76 / 140,789,820 → Let me compute this.

45,573.76 ÷ 140,789,820 → Approximately 0.0003236 m³.

So d = cube root of 0.0003236 m³.

What's the cube root of 0.0003236? Let me compute.

0.0003236 m³ is 323.6 cm³. Because 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³, so 0.0003236 m³ = 323.6 cm³.

The cube root of 323.6 cm³ is approximately 6.85 cm. Because 6.8^3 is 314.4, 6.9^3=328.5. So, 6.85 cm is approximately 2.7 inches (since 1 inch ≈ 2.54 cm). 6.85 cm / 2.54 ≈ 2.7 inches. So that would be option A: 2.7
