Okay, so I have this problem where Ms. Chen bought a used car worth $1650 using an installment plan. She paid $50 down and then $1840 in monthly payments over two years. I need to find the annual interest rate she paid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when something is bought on installments, the total amount paid includes the principal plus interest. The principal here would be the price of the car minus the down payment. So the principal is $1650 minus $50, which is $1600. That makes sense because she's paying off this $1600 over time, plus the interest.

She's making monthly payments, each of $1840, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the total payments are $1840? Or is that the total per month? Wait, the question says $1,840 in monthly installment payments over two years. So each month she's paying $1840? Wait, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Let me see: two years is 24 months. So 24 times 1840 would be a lot, but perhaps that's the case. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the car is worth $1650, and she's paying $1840 a month? That would mean she's paying way more than the car's value each month. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misreading the problem.

Wait, perhaps the $1,840 is the total she paid in installments, not per month. Let me check the question again. It says she paid $50 down and $1,840 in monthly installment payments over two years. Oh, wait, no, it's "$1,840 in monthly installment payments" — that wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it's $1,840 per month? But that would mean 24 payments of $1840, which totals $44,160, which is way more than the car's price. That can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's $1840 total in monthly payments over two years. But that would mean each payment is $1840/24 ≈ $76.67 per month. That seems more reasonable. But the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let me read the question again: "paying $50 down and $1,840 in monthly installment payments over a period of two years." Hmm, the wording could be interpreted as she paid $50 down, and then each month she paid $1,840. But that would imply 24 payments of $1840 each, totaling $44,160, which is way too high for a $1650 car. So that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's a total of $1,840 paid over 24 months, meaning each payment is $76.67. But that seems more plausible.

Wait, maybe the way it's written is "$1,840 in monthly installments", meaning each installment is $1840. But that would make the total payments way too high, so perhaps the intended meaning is that the total of all monthly installments is $1,840, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue, and it's supposed to say something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the total amount she paid in installments is $1,840. So the total she paid is $50 down plus $1,840, making the total $1,890. But the car was worth $1,650, so the principal is $1,600. So she paid $1,840 in installments over two years, which is $1,840, but wait, that would make the total she paid $1,890, while the principal is $1,600. So the interest would be $190. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the monthly payments add up to $1,840 over two years. So 24 months times monthly payment equals $1,840. So each payment is $1,840 /24 ≈ $76.67 per month. But that would be a very low monthly payment for a $1,600 principal over two years. Let me calculate what the monthly payment would be at different interest rates.

Alternatively, perhaps the $1,840 is the total of all installments. So the total amount paid in installments is $1,840, plus the down payment of $50, totaling $1,890 for a $1,650 car. So the principal is $1,600, and the interest paid is $1,840 - $1,600 = $240. Wait, but that's the total interest over two years.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a simple interest calculation. If the principal is $1,600, and the total interest is $240 over two years, then the interest per year would be $120. So the annual interest rate would be (120 / 1600) * 100% = 7.5%. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the right approach, or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, maybe it's not simple interest, but rather installment payments with compound interest, so I should use the present value of an annuity formula.

The present value (PV) of the installments should equal the principal. So PV is $1,600. The payment (PMT) each month is, say, X, and the number of periods (n) is 24 months. The interest rate per period is r. The formula is PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

But I don't know the PMT. Wait, in this problem, the total amount she's paying in installments is $1,840. So that would be PMT * 24 = 1840, so PMT = 1840 / 24 ≈ 76.6667 per month.

So the present value of those payments would be 76.6667 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ] = 1600.

So we can plug in values for r to find which option satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the formula for the interest rate. But this might get complicated without a financial calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 78 or other methods, but I think the present value approach is more accurate.

Let me try to compute this step by step.

So each monthly payment is $76.6667. The present value is $1600.

We can rearrange the formula to solve for r.

But without a calculator, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate by testing the given options.

The options given are:

A:10%, B:17.5%, C:15.2%, D:13.3%, E:20%, F:19.8%, G:18%, H:16%, I:12%, J:14.4%.

So let's compute the present value for each of these and see which one gets closest to $1600.

But wait, I have to convert the annual rate to a monthly rate by dividing by 12.

Let me start with option A: 10% annual rate, so monthly rate is 10%/12 ≈ 0.008333.

The present value factor for 24 periods at 0.8333% is:

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + 0.008333)^-24 ] / 0.008333

Calculating numerator: 1 - (1.008333)^-24

First, compute 1.008333^24.

Using the rule that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) when r is small, but perhaps better to compute step by step.

Alternatively, compute (1.008333)^24.

Let me compute it approximately.

1.008333^24:

We can compute it as follows:

ln(1.008333) ≈ 0.008267

Multiply by 24: 0.008267 *24 ≈ 0.1984

e^0.1984 ≈ 1.219

So (1.008333)^24 ≈ 1.219, so 1/1.219 ≈ 0.8203.

So numerator is 1 - 0.8203 = 0.1797

Now, denominator is 0.008333.

So PVIFA = 0.1797 / 0.008333 ≈ 21.56

Then, present value is PMT * PVIFA = 76.6667 * 21.56 ≈ let's calculate:

70 *21.56 = 1509.2

6.6667 *21.56 ≈ 143.5

Total ≈ 1509.2 + 143.5 = 1652.7. But the principal is $1600, so this is higher than needed. So the interest rate must be higher than 10%, because at 10%, the present value is higher than $1600.

Next, try option J:14.4% annual rate.

Monthly rate: 14.4%/12 = 1.2% = 0.012.

Compute PVIFA for 24 periods at 1.2% monthly.

PVIFA = [1 - (1.012)^-24 ] / 0.012

Compute (1.012)^24:

Again, approximate. Let's compute step by step.

1.012^24.

We can compute it as:

We can compute ln(1.012) ≈ 0.0119.

Multiply by 24: 0.0119 *24 = 0.2856.

e^0.2856 ≈ 1.331.

So (1.012)^24 ≈ 1.331, so 1/1.331 ≈ 0.7513.

Numerator: 1 - 0.7513 = 0.2487

Denominator: 0.012.

PVIFA = 0.2487 / 0.012 ≈ 20.725

Then present value = 76.6667 * 20.725 ≈ Let's compute:

70 *20.725 = 1449.75

6.6667 *20.725 ≈ 138.2

Total ≈ 1449.75 + 138.2 = 1587.95, which is close to $1600. So the present value is about $1588, but we need it to be $1600. So the rate must be a bit lower than 14.4%. Wait, no, because when the rate is lower, the present value is higher. Wait, when the discount rate is lower, the present value of the payments is higher. So since at 14.4% the PV is $1588, which is less than $1600, we need a lower rate to get a higher PV. Wait, no, wait: when the discount rate is higher, the present value is lower. So to reach $1600, which is higher than $1588, we need a lower discount rate than 14.4%.

Wait, but 14.4% is option J. Let me check the next lower option. Wait, the options are in a certain order. Let me list them again:

A:10%

B:17.5%

C:15.2%

D:13.3%

E:20%

F:19.8%

G:18%

H:16%

I:12%

J:14.4%

Wait, I just tried J (14.4%) and got a PV of about 1588, which is less than 1600. So perhaps the correct rate is lower than 14.4%, so let's try option I:12% annual.

Monthly rate: 1% (0.01).

Compute PVIFA for 24 periods at 1%.

PVIFA = [1 - (1.01)^-24 ] / 0.01

Compute (1.01)^24: Using the same method.

ln(1.01) ≈ 0.00995.

Multiply by 24: 0.00995 *24 ≈ 0.2388.

e^0.2388 ≈ 1.270.

So (1.01)^24 ≈ 1.270, so 1/1.270 ≈ 0.7874.

Numerator: 1 - 0.7874 = 0.2126

Denominator: 0.01.

PVIFA = 0.2126 / 0.01 = 21.26.

Then present value = 76.6667 *21.26 ≈ Compute:

70 *21.26 = 1488.2

6.6667 *21.26 ≈ 141.8

Total ≈ 1488.2 + 141.8 ≈ 1630.

That's higher than $1600. So at 12%, the PV is approximately $1630, which is more than $1600. So the correct rate is between 12% and 14.4%.

Wait, but wait, 14.4% gave us 1588, which is less than 1600, and 12% gives 1630, which is higher than 1600. So the actual rate is between 12% and 14.4%. Let's try option D:13.3%.

13.3% annual, so monthly rate is 13.3/12 ≈ 1.1083% ≈ 0.011083.

Compute PVIFA for 24 periods at 0.011083.

First, compute (1.011083)^24.

We can approximate using logarithms.

ln(1.011083) ≈ 0.011.

Multiply by 24: 0.011 *24 = 0.264.

e^0.264 ≈ 1.301.

So (1.011083)^24 ≈ 1.301, so 1/1.301 ≈ 0.7689.

Numerator: 1 - 0.7689 = 0.2311.

Denominator: 0.011083.

PVIFA ≈ 0.2311 / 0.011083 ≈ 20.86.

Then present value = 76.6667 *20.86 ≈ Let's compute:

70 *20.86= 1450.2

6.6667*20.86≈ 139.0

Total ≈ 1450.2 + 139.0 ≈ 1589.2.

Hmm, that's about $1589, which is still less than $1600. So the rate is lower than 13.3%. Let's try 12.5% to see.

12.5% annual, so monthly rate is 12.5/12 ≈ 0.0104167.

Compute PVIFA for 24 periods at 0.0104167.

Compute (1.0104167)^24.

ln(1.0104167) ≈ 0.01035.

Multiply by 24: 0.01035 *24 ≈ 0.2484.

e^0.2484 ≈ 1.282.

So (1.0104167)^24 ≈ 1.282, so 1/1.282 ≈ 0.7803.

Numerator: 1 - 0.7803 = 0.2197.

Denominator: 0.0104167.

PVIFA ≈ 0.2197 / 0.0104167 ≈ 21.09.

Then present value = 76.6667 *21.09 ≈ Let's compute:

70 *21.09 = 1476.3

6.6667 *21.09 ≈ 140.7

Total ≈ 1476.3 +140.7 ≈ 1617.

That's higher than 1600. So at 12.5%, PV is ~1617, which is higher than 1600. So the rate is between 12.5% and 13.3%.

Wait, but 13.3% gave us 1589, which is below 1600, and 12.5% is 1617, which is above.

So perhaps the actual rate is around 13% or so.

Wait, perhaps trying 13% annual.

13% annual, monthly rate 13/12=1.0833%.

Compute PVIFA for 24 periods at 1.0833%.

(1.010833)^24.

ln(1.010833) ≈ 0.01078.

Multiply by 24: 0.01078*24≈ 0.2587.

e^0.2587 ≈ 1.295.

So (1.010833)^24≈1.295, so 1/1.295≈0.7722.

Numerator:1-0.7722=0.2278.

Denominator:0.010833.

PVIFA≈0.2278 / 0.010833≈21.03.

Then PV=76.6667 *21.03≈ 70*21.03=1472.1, 6.6667*21.03≈140.2, total≈1612.3.

Hmm, that's still higher than 1600.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me try a different approach. Maybe using linear interpolation between the known points.

At 12%: PV=1630

At 13.3%: PV≈1589

We need PV=1600, which lies between 1589 and 1630.

The difference between 12% and 13.3% is 1.3% annual rate. The PV difference is 1630 - 1589 = 41.

We need to find the rate where PV is 1600, which is 1630 - 30 = 1600.

So the fraction is 30/41 ≈ 0.7317 of the interval from 12% to 13.3%.

So the rate would be 12% + 0.7317*(1.3%) ≈ 12% + 0.951% ≈ 12.951%, approximately 13%.

But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the options are given, and perhaps the closest one is option J:14.4% which gave us PV≈1588, which is close to 1600. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

The problem states that she paid $50 down and $1,840 in monthly installment payments over two years. Wait, perhaps the total amount paid in installments is $1,840, meaning each month she pays $1,840/24 ≈ $76.67. But this would mean the total she paid is $50 + $1,840 = $1,890, with the principal being $1,600, so the interest is $240 over two years, which is $120 per year. So the interest rate would be (120 /1600)*100 = 7.5% annually. But 7.5% is not an option, so I must have misinterpreted.

Alternatively, perhaps the $1,840 is the amount she pays
