Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the BASIC RND function. Hmm, I remember that RND gives a random number between 0 and 1, right? So I need to figure out how to generate different ranges of integers using RND. Let's take each part one by one.

Part (a) asks for an integral random number between 0 and X-1. So I'm thinking, if RND is between 0 and 1, multiplying by X would give me a number up to just under X. Taking the integer part with INT should give me from 0 up to X-1 because when you multiply by X, the max is just below X, so INT of that would be X-1. So the statement should be something like LET T = INT(X * RND). Wait, but looking at the options, I see option A has (a) LET T = INT(X*RND), which fits. Option D has (a) as INT((X-1)*RND). Hmm, but wait, if X is 5, for example, X-1 is 4, so 4*RND gives up to 4, but since RND is less than 1, it's up to just under 4. So INT would give 0 to 3. But the question wants up to X-1, which is 4 in this example. Oh wait, no—wait, X is 5, X-1 is 4. So 5 * RND gives up to just under 5. So INT(5*RND) can be 0 to 4, which is exactly 0 to X-1 when X is 5. So option A is correct for part (a).

Moving to part (b): generate a number between 1 and X. So we want 1 up to X, inclusive. How to adjust the previous method. If I take RND, multiply by X, which gives up to X, then take INT, which would give 0 to X-1. But we need 1 to X. So maybe add 1 before taking INT? Wait no, because 1 + (X*RND) could be up to X+1, but when we take INT, it would be up to X. So it depends on whether RND can be 1. Wait, RND returns a number less than 1, I think. So X * RND is less than X. Adding 1 would make it from 1 up to just under X+1. Taking INT would give 1 up to X. So the statement would be V = INT(1 + X*RND). Looking at the options, option A for (b) is exactly that. So part (b) in option A is correct.

Part (c): simulate a die toss, which is 1 to 6. Using the same logic as part (b), we can do 1 + INT(6*RND). So 6*RND gives up to 6 (but less than 6 since RND <1), INT makes it 0-5. Adding 1 makes it 1-6. So the statement would be W = INT(1 + 6*RND). Looking at the options, option A for (c) is that. So yes, option A is correct here.

Part (d): simulate a binary choice, 1 or 2. So we need to generate either 1 or 2. Let me think. 2*RND gives 0 to 2 (but less than 2), so INT(2*RND) would be 0 or 1. Adding 1 would make it 1 or 2. So the statement is N = INT(2*RND) + 1. Wait, wait, or is it INT(1 + 2*RND)? Let me see. When RND is 0.5 or higher, 2*RND is 1 or higher. So INT(2*RND) would be 1 when RND is >=0.5, and 0 otherwise. So adding 1 gives 1 or 2. So the statement should be N = INT(2*RND) + 1. Or wait, another approach: 1 + INT(2*RND). Which is the same as adding 1 after. So looking at the options, option A for (d) is LET N = INT(1 + 2*RND). Wait, but 1 + 2*RND could be up to 3. Because 2*RND is less than 2, adding 1 makes less than 3. So INT of that would be 0,1, or 2? Wait, no. Let me think: if RND is 0, 2*RND is 0, 1+0=1, INT is 1. If RND is 0.3, 0.6 → 1.6 → INT 1. If RND is 0.5, 1 → 2, INT is 2. If RND is 0.6, 1.2 → INT 1? Wait, wait. Wait 2*RND is 1.2, adding 1 gives 2.2, INT is 2. So actually, 2*RND ranges from 0 (included) to 2 (excluded). So 2*RND can be from 0 up to but not including 2. When you add 1, it's 1 up to but not including 3. So INT(1 + 2*RND) gives 1 when 1 <= ... <2, which is when 0 <= RND <0.5, and 2 when 2 <= ... <3, which is when 1 <= 1+2*RND <3 → 0 <= 2*RND <2 → which is always true, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Let's see:

When RND is between 0 and 0.5, 2*RND is 0 to 1. So 1 + 2*RND is 1 to 2. INT of that is 1.

When RND is between 0.5 and 1, 2*RND is 1 to 2. So 1 + 2*RND is 2 to 3. INT of that is 2.

So this gives 1 or 2, which is what we want. So option A for (d) is correct.

Wait, but some of the other options might have different approaches. Let me check option D for (d): LET N = INT(RND *1) +1. RND*1 is same as RND, which is 0 to 1, so INT is 0. Adding 1 gives 1. So that's only 1, which is wrong. So option D is incorrect for (d).

Another option is option H, which for (d) has LET N = INT(RND *1) +1, which again would be 0 or 1. So N would be 1 or 2? Wait, wait. Wait RND is 0 to 1, so RND *1 is same. INT(RND *1) is 0. So N=0+1=1 always. That can't be right. So option H is wrong.

Option A's (d) seems correct.

Putting it all together, option A is the correct choice because all four parts (a)-(d) are correct in option A.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the correct BASIC statements for generating specific random numbers using the RND function, which returns a value between 0 and 1. Each part of the question requires a different range of random integers, and the solution involves scaling and shifting the output of RND appropriately.

### Analysis of Each Part:

1. **(a) Generate an integral random number between 0 and X-1**  
   To achieve this, multiply RND by X, which gives a value between 0 and X (excluding X). Taking the integer part with INT ensures the result is between 0 and X-1.  
   Correct statement: `LET T = INT(X * RND)`.

2. **(b) Generate an integral random number between 1 and X**  
   Multiply RND by X to get a value between 0 and X (excluding X). Adding 1 shifts the range to 1 to X+1, and taking the integer part with INT ensures the result is between 1 and X.  
   Correct statement: `LET V = INT(1 + X * RND)`.

3. **(c) Simulate the toss of a cubical die (1 to 6)**  
   Multiply RND by 6 to get a value between 0 and 6 (excluding 6). Adding 1 shifts the range to 1 to 7, and taking the integer part with INT ensures the result is between 1 and 6.  
   Correct statement: `LET W = INT(1 + 6 * RND)`.

4. **(d) Simulate a binary random choice (1 or 2)**  
   Multiply RND by 2 to get a value between 0 and 2 (excluding 2). Taking the integer part with INT gives 0 or 1. Adding 1 shifts the result to 1 or 2.  
   Correct statement: `LET N = INT(1 + 2 * RND)`.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Matches all the correct statements for parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
- **Option B**: Incorrect scaling and shifting in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect use of INT and improper shifting in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
- **Option D**: Incorrect implementation in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
- **Option E**: Incorrect use of RND with arguments, which is not valid BASIC syntax.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect scaling and shifting in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
- **Option G**: Incorrect use of INT and improper shifting in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
- **Option H**: Incorrect implementation in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
- **Option I**: Incorrect use of INT and improper shifting in parts (a), (b), (c), and (d).  

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only choice that correctly implements all four parts of the question.
