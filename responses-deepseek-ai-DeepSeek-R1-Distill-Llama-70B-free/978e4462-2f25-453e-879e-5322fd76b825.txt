Question:

A major problem in thinking is maintaining alertness or concentration. What have experimental findings demonstrated about this problem?

Options:

A: The human mind can easily concentrate for long periods of time.
B: Concentration is unaffected by external distractions if the subject is engaging enough.
C: Attention can be sustained indefinitely if the subject is of personal interest.
D: The human system responds poorly to novelty or change in stimuli.
E: Frequent breaks diminish the ability to focus on tasks.
F: It is difficult to maintain attention for a long time on one particular subject or source of stimulation.
G: The human system shows increased alertness in response to monotonous stimuli.
H: Alertness is constant and does not fluctuate throughout the day.
I: The mind is better at multitasking than focusing on a single task for an extended period.
J: Concentration improves with time.

Okay, so I have this question here about thinking and concentration. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about a major problem in thinking related to maintaining alertness or concentration. What have experimental findings shown about this?

Let me look at the options. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Option A: The human mind can easily concentrate for long periods. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I remember reading somewhere that people have trouble focusing for too long. Like, attention spans are limited. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Concentration is unaffected by external distractions if the subject is engaging enough. Hmm, I think external distractions do affect concentration. Even if the task is interesting, if there's noise or other interruptions, it's hard to focus. So B might not be right.

Option C: Attention can be sustained indefinitely if the subject is of personal interest. I'm not so sure about that. Even if you love a subject, after a while, you might get tired or your mind starts to wander. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D: The human system responds poorly to novelty or change in stimuli. Wait, I think it's the opposite. People get bored with the same stimuli and respond better to new things. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: Frequent breaks diminish the ability to focus on tasks. No, I think breaks actually help. Like taking short breaks can improve focus when you come back. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: It is difficult to maintain attention for a long time on one particular subject or source of stimulation. Yeah, this rings a bell. I remember something about attention spans and how sustained focus is hard. So F might be the correct answer.

Option G: The human system shows increased alertness in response to monotonous stimuli. No, monotony makes people less alert. Like, if you're doing the same thing over and over, you get bored and less focused. So G is wrong.

Option H: Alertness is constant and does not fluctuate throughout the day. No way. I know my alertness varies. I'm more alert in the morning and get tired in the afternoon. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The mind is better at multitasking than focusing on a single task for an extended period. Wait, I think research shows that multitasking is actually less efficient than focusing on one task. So maybe I isn't right.

Option J: Concentration improves with time. I don't think so. Without breaks or changes, concentration tends to decrease over time as you get fatigued. So J is probably not correct.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. Experimental findings have shown that maintaining attention on one thing for a long time is difficult. That makes sense because our brains tend to wander or get fatigued.

The correct answer is F. Experimental findings have shown that it is difficult to maintain attention for a long time on one particular subject or source of stimulation. This aligns with the understanding that sustained focus is challenging due to factors like mental fatigue and distractions.

Answer: F
