Okay, so I've got this problem about pressure loss in a pipe, and I'm a bit new to fluid dynamics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me a horizontal pipe with an inside diameter of 1.2 inches. Hmm, wait, the units here are in inches, but other parameters are in feet. I'll need to convert that diameter to feet later on. The roughness, k, is given as 0.002 feet, and the water flows at 9.3 ft/s. The kinematic viscosity of water is 0.93e-5 ft²/s. I'm supposed to find the pressure loss per 10 feet of pipe. The options are given from A to J.

I remember that pressure loss, or head loss, in a pipe is calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The formula is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D), where f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the pipe length, v is the flow velocity, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and D is the pipe diameter.

But wait, I need to find the friction factor f first. The friction factor depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, which is determined by the Reynolds number. Reynolds number Re is (v * D) / ν. If Re is less than 2000, it's laminar and f is 64/Re. If it's turbulent, which is most cases for pipes, we use the Colebrook-White equation or a Moody diagram. But since I don't have the Moody diagram here, I'll go with Colebrook-White.

The Colebrook-White equation is 1/sqrt(f) = log((k/(3.7*D)) + (1/(Re * sqrt(f))), but that's a bit complicated to solve algebraically. Alternatively, an approximation for the friction factor in the turbulent regime is the Moody equation, but since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I can find Re first and see if it's turbulent.

First, let's get all the units consistent. The diameter is given in inches, so 1.2 inches is 1.2/12 = 0.1 feet. The velocity is 9.3 ft/s, and kinematic viscosity ν is 0.93e-5 ft²/s.

Calculating the Reynolds number Re = (v * D) / ν. Plugging the numbers: 9.3 * 0.1 / (0.93e-5). Let me compute that. 9.3 * 0.1 is 0.93. Divide by 0.93e-5: 0.93 / 0.93e-5 = 1e5. So Re is 1e5, which is definitely in the turbulent regime. So I need to compute the friction factor f using either the Colebrook-White equation or an approximate method.

An alternative formula I remember is the approximation for f when the flow is turbulent and the pipe is rough. There's the formula f = (1/4n) * log((k/(3.7*D)) + (1/(Re * sqrt(f))) ), but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, for fully turbulent flow where the roughness is the main factor, f can be approximated. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: for high Reynolds numbers, the friction factor depends mainly on the relative roughness, which is k/(D). Let me compute that. The relative roughness ε/D = 0.002 ft / 0.1 ft = 0.02. So ε/D is 0.02, which is 2% relative roughness. 

Looking up Moody's diagram for a relative roughness of 0.02 and a high Reynolds number (since Re is 1e5), the friction factor f is approximately 0.016. Wait, I'm trying to recall the Moody diagram. For ε/D of 0.02, at Re of 1e5, I think f is around 0.016. Alternatively, perhaps 0.015 or 0.017. Let me think, if ε/D is 0.02, Moody's gives f around 0.016. Let's proceed with f=0.016. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the Colebrook-White equation. The equation is:

1/sqrt(f) = log( (k/(3.7*D)) + (1/(Re * sqrt(f))) )

But this is an iterative equation because f appears on both sides. Let me plug in the known values.

k = 0.002 ft, D = 0.1 ft.

k/(3.7 D) = 0.002/(3.7 * 0.1) = 0.002 / 0.37 ≈ 0.005405.

Re is 1e5, and let's assume an initial f, perhaps 0.02 as a guess.

So the term (1/(Re * sqrt(f))) is 1/(1e5 * sqrt(0.02)).

sqrt(0.02) is approx 0.1414, so 1/(1e5 * 0.1414) = 1/(14140) ≈ 7.07e-5.

So the argument of the log becomes 0.005405 + 0.0000707 ≈ 0.0054757.

Take the log (base 10) of that: log(0.0054757) ≈ log(5.4757e-3) ≈ -2.26.

So 1/sqrt(f) = -2.26. Wait, that can't be right because 1/sqrt(f) is positive. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign or the equation setup.

Wait, no, I think I used the correct formula. Let me recheck. Oh wait, no, wait! The Colebrook-White equation is written as:

1/sqrt(f) = log( (k/(3.7*D)) + (1/(Re * sqrt(f))) )

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the equation. The correct form is:

1/sqrt(f) = log( (ε/(3.7 D) ) + ( (2.51 * ν) / (D * v) ) * sqrt(f) )

Wait, perhaps I was using the wrong form earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Alternatively, another version is:

1/sqrt(f) = log( (k/(3.7 D)) ) + (1/(Re sqrt(f)) )

But I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the implicit equation and solve for f numerically.

Alternatively, let me think about the explicit formula for f when the flow is completely rough. In the fully rough zone, f is given by:

f = (1/4) * (log( (k/(3.7 D) )) )^2

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, for high Reynolds numbers where the flow is fully rough, f depends only on the relative roughness. The formula is f = (1/4) * (log( (k/(3.7 D) )) )^(-2). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things. Let me think.

The formula for f in the fully rough (turbulent) regime is f = (1/ ( (log( (k/(3.7 D) )) )) )^2 ) * (1/4). Or perhaps f = (log( (k/(3.7 D) )) )^{-2} * 0.25. Let me compute that.

We have k/(3.7 D) = 0.002 / (3.7 * 0.1) = 0.002/(0.37) ≈ 0.005405.

Then log(0.005405) is log base 10: since 0.005 is 5e-3. Log(5e-3) is log(5) + (-3) log(10) → approx 0.69897 -3 = -2.3010.

So log(k/(3.7 D)) ≈ -2.3010.

So f = (1/( -2.3010 ))^2 * (1/4) → (1/5.294) * 0.25 → 0.1887 * 0.25 ≈ 0.0472. Wait, that can't be right because f=0.047 seems a bit high. I thought earlier that f was around 0.016. Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe in the fully rough zone, the friction factor is given by f = (k/(3.7 D))^(1/3) * something. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for f using the relative roughness and the Reynolds number. Let me try the Colebrook-White equation again, this time correctly.

The correct form is:

1/√f = log[(k/(3.7 D)) + (1/(Re √f))]

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for f. Let me denote the terms:

a = k/(3.7 D) = 0.002/(3.7 * 0.1) = 0.002 / 0.37 ≈ 0.005405.

Re is 1e5.

So the equation becomes:

1/√f = log( a + (1/(Re √f)) )

This is a nonlinear equation in f, so I'll need to solve it iteratively.

Let me start by assuming an initial value for f. Let's try f_initial = 0.02.

Compute the right-hand side (RHS):

RHS = log( a + (1/(Re * sqrt(f_initial))) )

sqrt(f_initial) = sqrt(0.02) ≈ 0.1414.

1/(Re * sqrt(f_initial)) = 1/(1e5 * 0.1414) ≈ 1/14140 ≈ 7.07e-5.

So a + ... = 0.005405 + 0.0000707 ≈ 0.0054757.

log(0.0054757) ≈ log(5.4757e-3) = log(5.4757) + log(1e-3) ≈ 0.7395 -3 = -2.2605.

So 1/sqrt(f_initial) = 1/0.1414 ≈ 7.0711.

But according to the equation, 1/sqrt(f) = RHS = -2.2605. That can't be, because the left side is positive. Hmm, that suggests that f_initial is not the correct value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because the equation is 1/sqrt(f) = log(term), and the log is negative, which would imply 1/sqrt(f) is negative, which is impossible. That suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the correct form of the Colebrook-White equation.

Ah, wait! I think I messed up the equation. The correct form is:

1/√f = log( (k/(3.7 D) ) + (1/(Re √f)) )

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct form is:

1/√f = log( (k/(3.7 D) ) + ( (2.51 * ν) / (D * v) ) * √f )

Wait, perhaps I got the second term wrong. Let's re-express the equation properly.

The correct Colebrook-White equation is:

1/√f = log( (k/(3.7 D)) + (2.51 ν) / (D v √f) )

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, it's written as:

1/√f = log( (k/(3.7 D)) + ( (2.51 ν) / (D v) ) * √f )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check.

Wait, actually, the correct form is:

1/√f = log( (ε/D) / 3.7 ) + log( 1 + (2.51 ν sqrt(f))/(D v) )

Wait no, perhaps it's better to look for the correct formula.

Wait, the correct form is:

1/√f = log( (k/(3.7 D)) + (1/(Re √f)) )

Wait, perhaps I was right the first time. Let me try again.

With a = k/(3.7 D) = 0.005405.

Re = 1e5.

Let me try a better initial guess. Let's assume a lower f. Let's say f_initial = 0.018.

Compute sqrt(f_initial) = sqrt(0.018) ≈ 0.1341.

Then, 1/(Re * sqrt(f)) = 1/(1e5 * 0.1341) ≈ 1/13410 ≈ 7.46e-5.

So a + 1/(Re sqrt(f)) = 0.005405 + 0.0000746 ≈ 0.00548.

log(0.00548) ≈ -2.26.

So 1/sqrt(f) = -2.26 → which is impossible, because 1/sqrt(f) is positive.

Hmm, that indicates that my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should instead use an iterative method, like Newton-Raphson, to solve for f.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an alternative formula for friction factor when flow is turbulent. There's the Moody diagram which relates f to Re and relative roughness. But without the diagram, I can recall that for relative roughness ε/D of 0.02, and Re of 1e5, the friction factor is about 0.016.

Wait, I'm starting to think that perhaps f is around 0.016. Let me proceed with that and see where it gets me.

So f ≈ 0.016.

Now, using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D).

But wait, the problem asks for pressure loss, not head loss. So I'll need to convert h_f (head loss in feet) to pressure loss in psi.

The relationship between pressure loss (ΔP) and head loss (h_f) is ΔP = h_f * γ, where γ is the specific weight of the fluid. For water, γ is 62.4 lb/ft³.

So first, compute h_f.

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D).

Let's plug in the numbers.

f = 0.016.

L = 10 ft.

v = 9.3 ft/s.

g = 32.2 ft/s².

D = 0.1 ft.

So:

h_f = (0.016 * 10 * (9.3)^2) / (2 * 32.2 * 0.1 )

Compute numerator: 0.016 *10=0.16; 9.3²=86.49. So 0.16 *86.49 ≈ 13.838.

Denominator: 2 *32.2=64.4; 64.4 *0.1=6.44.

So h_f ≈ 13.838 /6.44 ≈ 2.15 ft of head.

Now, convert that to psi. Since 1 ft of water head is approximately 0.433 psi (because pressure is force per area; 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft = 62.4 lb/ft², and atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi ≈ 2116.2 lb/ft², so 62.4 / 14.7 ≈ 4.24, but wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate it correctly. Let me compute it accurately.

The specific weight γ = 62.4 lb/ft³.

Pressure P = γ * h.

So h_f is 2.15 ft. So P = 62.4 lb/ft³ * 2.15 ft = 134.04 lb/ft².

Now, convert lb/ft² to psi. Since 1 psi = 144 lb/ft² (because 1 ft² = 144 in², and 1 psi is 1 lb/in²).

So P = 134.04 lb/ft² / 144 lb/in²/psi ≈ 0.9308 psi.

Wait, that's only about 0.93 psi. But looking at the options, the closest is option J: 2.0 psi. But wait, I must have made a mistake because my calculation gives around 0.93 psi, but none of the options are exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the friction factor.

Wait, another thought: I assumed f=0.016, but maybe the correct f is higher. Because perhaps the initial assumption about f was wrong. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the friction factor more accurately. Let me attempt the iterative method.

Let me denote f as a variable and solve 1/sqrt(f) = log( a + (1/(Re sqrt(f))) ), with a = 0.005405, Re=1e5.

Let me try f=0.02.

Compute 1/sqrt(0.02)=7.0711.

On the RHS: log(0.005405 + 1/(1e5 * sqrt(0.02)) ) = log(0.005405 + 1/(1414.2)).

Compute 1/1414.2 ≈ 0.000707.

So 0.005405 + 0.000707 ≈ 0.006112.

log(0.006112)= log(6.112e-3) ≈ log(6.112) + (-3) → approximately 0.786 -3 = -2.214.

But 1/sqrt(f)=7.0711, which is much larger than RHS of -2.214. So that suggests f is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I should try a smaller f, like f=0.015.

1/sqrt(0.015)=8.164.

RHS: log(0.005405 + 1/(1e5 * sqrt(0.015)) )

Compute sqrt(0.015)=0.1225, so 1/(1e5 *0.1225)=1/12250≈8.17e-5.

So 0.005405 + 0.0000817 ≈ 0.0054867.

log(0.0054867)= log(5.4867e-3)≈-2.259.

So 1/sqrt(f)=8.164 vs RHS=-2.259. Not matching.

Hmm, maybe f is even smaller. Let's try f=0.013.

1/sqrt(0.013)=
