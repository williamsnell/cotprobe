Question:

A cashier worked part-time at a convenience store. As the cashier was sitting behind the cash register, he noticed a boy enter the store. While the boy walked through the store, the cashier watched him on a hidden camera located behind the cashier's counter. Thereupon, the cashier saw the boy pick up two packs of baseball cards and place them in his coat pocket. The boy then walked to the rear of the store, where he picked up a package of cupcakes. The boy took the cupcakes to the front counter and paid the cashier for the cupcakes only. The boy started to walk out of the store when the cashier said, "Hey, kid, I'm not charging you for the baseball cards because you paid for the cupcakes. But next time I'm not going to let you get away with it. " The baseball cards sold for $5 per pack. The boy has committed which, if any, crimes?

Options:

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding theft. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a boy who enters a store, takes two packs of baseball cards, puts them in his pocket, then picks up cupcakes, pays for them, and starts to leave. The cashier stops him, saying he's not charging for the baseball cards this time but implies that the boy was trying to take them without paying. The baseball cards are each $5, so two would be $10.

First, I need to figure out what crime the boy might have committed. The options are various theft-related crimes: false pretenses, no crime, robbery, theft by deception, embezzlement, fraud, larceny, petit theft, larceny by trick.

So, let's think about each possible crime and see which fits the situation.

1. **False Pretenses**: This typically involves obtaining title to property by deception. The person lies to the owner to get the owner to hand over the property. For example, if the boy lied to the cashier to get the baseball cards, that could be false pretenses. But here, the boy didn't deceive the cashier into giving him the cards; he just took them without paying. So maybe not this.

2. **No Crime (Option B)**: Could the boy have not committed any crime? That seems unlikely because he took items without paying. But maybe there's a technicality. For example, if he intended to pay but forgot, but the cashier's statement suggests he was trying to steal.

3. **Robbery (Option C)**: Robbery involves taking property from someone using force or threat of force. There's no indication of force here, so robbery doesn't apply.

4. **Theft by Deception (Option D)**: This is similar to false pretenses but perhaps a broader term. It involves obtaining property by deception. Again, the boy didn't deceive the cashier into giving him the cards; he just took them, so maybe not.

5. **Embezzlement (Option E)**: This occurs when someone in a position of trust (like an employee) steals from their employer. The boy isn't an employee, so this doesn't fit.

6. **Fraud (Option F)**: Fraud involves intentional deception for personal gain. While the boy took the cards, fraud is a broader term and might not specifically apply here as a standalone crime in this context.

7. **Larceny (Option G)**: Larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. This seems to fit because the boy took the baseball cards without paying, intending to keep them.

8. **Petit Theft (Option H)**: Petit theft is a form of larceny but applies to smaller values. Since each pack is $5, two would be $10. Depending on the jurisdiction, petit theft might apply, but the question doesn't specify the exact legal thresholds. However, the main issue is whether it's theft, regardless of the category.

9. **Larceny by Trick (Option I)**: This occurs when the thief obtains possession of the property by some deceit or trick, with the intention of converting it to their own use. But in this case, the boy didn't trick the cashier into giving him the cards; he just took them without the cashier noticing until later. So maybe not larceny by trick.

So, putting it together. The boy took the baseball cards without paying, intending to steal them. He paid for the cupcakes, which is a separate transaction. The cashier noticed via the hidden camera, so the boy was caught before leaving. The key elements are the taking without payment and the intent to deprive the owner permanently.

Therefore, this fits larceny. Now, considering petit theft, if the value is low, it might be petit larceny or theft. But the question is asking which crime he has committed, if any. Petit theft is a type of larceny, so the broader category would be larceny.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, petit theft is a specific offense for lower-value items. So if the total is $10, it might be petit theft, which is a form of larceny. However, the answer options don't have both G and H correct, so I need to see which is the best fit.

Looking back, the question asks "which, if any, crimes?" So the boy took the two packs, each $5, so total $10. If the jurisdiction's threshold for petit theft is, say, under $300, then $10 would be petit theft. But since the options include both G and H, I need to decide which is correct.

Wait, but the cashier didn't let him get away with it. Does that affect the crime? No, because the crime is complete once he takes the property with intent to steal, regardless of whether he's caught or the property is recovered.

So, the boy committed theft (larceny) of the baseball cards. Petit theft would be a subtype if the value is low. But the answer options include both G and H. So which one is the correct answer?

Looking at the options, G is larceny, H is petit theft. The question states "if any," so if petit theft is a specific type of larceny, and the value is $10, then H would be the correct answer. However, sometimes petit theft is considered a separate offense, but in some contexts, it's just larceny with a lower penalty based on value.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the boy intended to steal the baseball cards, so it's larceny regardless of the amount. Petit theft is a grading based on the value, but the crime is still larceny. However, the options are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is G, larceny, because petit theft is a subset.

Wait, but in criminal law, petit larceny (or petit theft) is a specific charge when the value is below a certain amount. So if the jurisdiction considers $10 as petit theft, then H would be correct. But without knowing the exact threshold, I think the question expects the answer to be larceny, as that's the general term.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, larceny. But I'm a bit confused because the value is low, so petit theft might apply.

Another angle: the cashier didn't report it or let the boy off with a warning. Does that affect the crime? No, because the crime is committed when the boy took the items with intent to steal. The cashier's action doesn't undo the crime.

So, the boy committed larceny. Petit theft might be a more specific answer, but I think the correct term is larceny. Wait, but the options have both G and H. So which is correct.

Wait, the question states "the boy has committed which, if any, crimes?" So it's possible that he's committed petit theft as a form of larceny. But the options list G as larceny and H as petit theft.

In some jurisdictions, petit theft is a specific offense, so H might be the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the question considers larceny as the general category, then G would be correct.

Wait, another thought. The cashier saw him take the baseball cards and then take the cupcakes, pay for them, and then tried to leave. The cashier then confronted him, but didn't press charges. So the boy took the baseball cards without paying, which is larceny. Petit theft would depend on the value.

Since the value is $10, which is likely below the felony threshold, it's petit theft, which is a type of larceny. So the answer would be H: Petit theft.

Alternatively, some might argue that petit theft is a form of larceny, so G is correct. But I think in the context of multiple-choice questions, if both G and H are options, and the value is low, H is the better answer.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which, if any, crimes?" So it's possible that the correct answer is larceny, and petit theft is a subset. But I think the answer expects G, larceny, because that's the general crime, and petit theft is a specific type based on value, which the question doesn't specify the legal threshold for.

Alternatively, the answer could be G: Larceny.

Wait, but the cashier's statement might imply that the boy was trying to steal, but perhaps the intent wasn't fully formed? No, because the boy put the cards in his pocket and tried to leave without paying, which shows intent to steal.

So, the correct answer is either G or H. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, the question gives the price as $5 per pack, so two packs would be $10. If the jurisdiction's petit theft threshold is, say, under $100 or $300, then $10 would qualify. Petit theft is a form of larceny but is a specific offense. So the answer would be H: Petit theft.

But some might argue that the correct answer is larceny regardless of the value. I think the more precise answer would be petit theft, so H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I think I'll go with G: Larceny, as the general crime, and H being a specific instance. But I'm not 100% sure.

The scenario involves a boy who took two packs of baseball cards worth $10 without paying, intending to steal them, and then paid for cupcakes before attempting to leave. The cashier confronted him but did not press charges. The key issue is determining which crime, if any, the boy committed.

1. **False Pretenses (A)**: This involves deception to obtain property, which is not applicable here since the boy did not deceive the cashier into handing over the cards.

2. **No Crime (B)**: This is unlikely because the boy took property without paying, indicating an intent to steal.

3. **Robbery (C)**: Robbery requires force or threat of force, which is absent in this case.

4. **Theft by Deception (D)**: This involves deception to obtain property, which does not apply here as the boy did not deceive the cashier to get the cards.

5. **Embezzlement (E)**: This occurs when someone in a trusted position steals from their employer, which is irrelevant since the boy is not an employee.

6. **Fraud (F)**: Fraud involves intentional deception for personal gain, which is not directly applicable here.

7. **Larceny (G)**: Larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. This fits the scenario as the boy took the cards without payment, intending to steal them.

8. **Petit Theft (H)**: Petit theft is a form of larceny involving smaller-value items. Since the total value of the cards is $10, which is likely below the felony threshold in most jurisdictions, petit theft applies.

9. **Larceny by Trick (I)**: This involves obtaining property through deceit, which is not relevant here as the boy did not trick the cashier.

The boy committed theft, specifically petit theft, due to the low value of the items. While larceny is the broader category, petit theft is the more precise answer based on the value of the stolen items. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: Petit theft.

Answer: H
