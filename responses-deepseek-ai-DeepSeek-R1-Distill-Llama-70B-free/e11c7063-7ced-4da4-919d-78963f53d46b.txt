Question:

Suppose Unix did not provide a way of passing file descriptors between processes, but still allowed inheriting file descriptors from a parent on fork and exec. What aspects of the OKWS design would break without file descriptor passing?

2. It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to a database proxy.

Options:

A: False, True
B: False, False
C: True, True
D: True, False

Okay, so I've got this question about Unix file descriptors and the OKWS design. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what aspects of OKWS would break if Unix didn't allow passing file descriptors between processes, but still allowed inheriting them on fork and exec. So, the two options are about services sending messages to oklogd and getting a TCP connection to a database proxy.

First, I remember that in Unix, when a process forks, it inherits the parent's file descriptors. That's how, for example, a child process can access the same files the parent was using. But passing file descriptors between unrelated processes usually requires some kind of IPC mechanism. I think the main way to pass them is via System V IPC or maybe using sockets with sendmsg and recvmsg where you can send fds over a socket.

Wait, but the question says that Unix doesn't provide a way to pass file descriptors between processes. So any mechanism that relies on sending fds directly wouldn't work. But fork and exec still allow inheritance, so when a process forks, the child has the parent's descriptors.

Let me think about the two aspects mentioned.

1. Services sending messages to oklogd. Oklogd is a logging daemon, right? So services probably send log messages to it. How do they do that? If the service and oklogd are separate processes, they might communicate via a socket. Now, if they can't pass file descriptors, does that affect this? Well, if the communication is via sending messages (like strings or data), then they don't need to pass file descriptors. They could just use send and recv on the socket. So maybe this wouldn't break. Alternatively, if oklogd's communication requires the service to pass a file descriptor (like for some logging handle), then it would be a problem. But I'm not sure. I think most logging daemons just accept log messages via a socket without needing to exchange file descriptors. So perhaps this aspect would still work.

2. Services getting a TCP connection to a database proxy. Hmm, maybe the database proxy is a service that the application needs to connect to. So when a service wants to connect to the database, it might get a socket from the proxy. But how is that done? If the proxy and the service are separate processes, how would the proxy pass the TCP connection (which is a file descriptor) to the service? Without the ability to pass file descriptors, the service can't get the TCP connection via that method. So the service might have to connect directly, but if the proxy is necessary (like for connection pooling or access control), then without passing the fd, the service can't get the connection. So this aspect would break.

Wait, but maybe the proxy is started by forking, so when a service starts, it inherits the necessary file descriptors. Or perhaps the proxy is part of the service's setup. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: services might fork and then exec the proxy, inheriting the file descriptors. But if the service isn't the parent, then it can't inherit from the proxy. So if the proxy is a separate process, and it can't send the file descriptor to the service, then the service can't get it. So in that case, without file descriptor passing, the service can't get the TCP connection from the proxy.

So putting it together:

1. Sending messages to oklogd would still be possible because you don't need to pass file descriptors for that. So the first statement would be false.

2. Getting a TCP connection from the proxy would be impossible without passing fds, so the second statement is true.

Looking at the options, the first option is whether it's impossible for services to send messages (statement 1), and the second is whether it's impossible to get a TCP connection (statement 2).

The question is phrased as: "What aspects ... would break without file descriptor passing?" So the two statements are whether each aspect would break.

So statement 1: without fd passing, would it be impossible? If the answer is no (because it's still possible), then statement 1 is false. Statement 2: yes, it would be impossible, so statement 2 is true.

Looking at the options, option A is False, True. So the answer would be A.

If Unix did not provide a way to pass file descriptors between processes, but still allowed inheriting file descriptors on fork and exec, the implications for the OKWS design would depend on how each aspect operates:

1. **Services sending messages to oklogd**: Oklogd is a logging daemon that typically receives log messages via a socket. Since sending log messages does not require passing file descriptors, this functionality would not break. Therefore, it would not be impossible for services to send messages to oklogd, making the first statement false.

2. **Services getting a TCP connection to a database proxy**: If the database proxy is a separate process, passing a TCP connection (a file descriptor) to the service would require file descriptor passing. Without this capability, the service would be unable to obtain the TCP connection from the proxy, making the second statement true.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is **False, True**, which corresponds to option A.
