Okay, so I have this logic question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a type of fallacy. The scenario is: If you argue that something is flawed because it fails to do something, but that something was never intended to be done by it, what fallacy have you committed?

The options are A through D, and I need to pick the right one. Let me break this down.

Hmm. So, the argument is that something is flawed because it doesn't do X, but X wasn't part of its intended purpose. That sounds familiar. I think this is a common fallacy where you're holding something to a standard it was never meant to meet.

Wait, what's that called again? I remember there are several fallacies related to arguments. Like ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy... Oh, right! There's something called the "appeal to ignorance," but I don't think that's it here. Or maybe "straw man," but that's when you misrepresent someone's argument.

Wait, another thought: There's a fallacy called "ignoratio elenchi," which means "ignoring the issue." It's when you prove a different point than what was at stake. But how does that apply here?

Alternatively, I've heard of the "red herring" fallacy, which is introducing an irrelevant point, but I don't think that's exactly this either. Or perhaps "false cause," but that's about incorrectly linking causes.

Wait, there's a fallacy called "appeal to inappropriate criteria" or something similar. Let me think. Oh, yes! The "fallacy of irrelevant criteria." That's when you judge something based on criteria that aren't relevant to its purpose.

So, in this scenario, the person is criticizing something for not doing something it was never supposed to do. So they're using the wrong criteria to evaluate it. That would fit the "irrelevant criteria" fallacy.

But looking at the options given, I don't see "irrelevant criteria" as one of them. The options are A: ad ignorantium, B: Many questions, C: Extension, D: Compound proposition.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. Another possibility is the "straw man" fallacy. That's when you misrepresent someone's argument to make it easier to attack. But in this case, it's more about evaluating the thing based on the wrong criteria, not misrepresenting the argument.

Alternatively, could it be the "false dichotomy"? No, that's when you present two options as the only possibilities when there are more. That doesn't fit here.

Wait, another thought: The fallacy might be called "wrongly assuming the conclusion," but that's more like circular reasoning.

Wait, perhaps it's the "appeal to standards" fallacy. Or maybe "misleading vividness." No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of the structure. The argument is that X is flawed because it doesn't do Y, but Y wasn't intended. So the argument is attacking X on a point that's irrelevant to X's purpose.

Ah, I think the correct term for this is "ignoratio elenchi," but I'm not sure. Wait, no, "ignoratio elenchi" is more about proving a different point than what's at issue. Like, in a debate, you argue for something that's not what the opponent is claiming.

Wait, another angle: The fallacy is called "attacking a straw man," but that's when you misrepresent the opponent's argument. So if someone says, "My plan will help the economy," and you respond, "But it won't solve world hunger," that's a straw man because you're attacking a point they didn't make.

Wait, that's exactly the scenario here! So in this case, the argument is that the plan is flawed because it doesn't do something it was never intended to do. That's a straw man fallacy because you're attacking a position the other person didn't take.

Wait, but the options don't include straw man. The options are A: ad ignorantium, B: Many questions, C: Extension, D: Compound proposition.

Hmm, none of these sound like straw man. Did I misunderstand the options? Let me look again.

Wait, option C is "Extension." I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe it's "fallacy of extension," but I don't recall that term. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistranslation or another term for something else.

Wait, another possibility: The fallacy is called "not proving the point" or "irrelevant conclusion," which is a type of igno ratio elenchi. So maybe the correct answer is A: ad ignorantium? Wait, no, ad ignorantium is appeal to ignorance, which is assuming something is true because it's not proven false, or vice versa.

So that doesn't fit here. Option B is "Many questions," which I think refers to "complex question" fallacy, where a question assumes a premise that hasn't been established. Like, "When did you stop beating your wife?" which assumes you did beat her.

Option D: "Compound proposition." I'm not sure, but perhaps it's the fallacy of treating a compound proposition as simple or vice versa.

Wait, none of these options seem to match the scenario. So perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong fallacy. Let me recall the structure of the question again.

The argument is flawed because it fails to do Y, but Y wasn't intended. So the error is in the criteria used. That's called the "fallacy of irrelevant criteria" or "appeal to inappropriate criteria."

But given the options, I don't see that. So perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe the correct answer is C: Extension. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to "appeal to ignorance," but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another approach: The fallacy is called "denying the antecedent," but that's a logical fallacy in conditional statements, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's "false cause," but that's about causation.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's definition.

Option A: ad ignorantium. Appeal to ignorance. Arguing that something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or false because it hasn't been proven true. That doesn't fit.

Option B: Many questions. That's the complex question fallacy, like assuming a fact not in evidence in the question. For example, "Do you still beat your wife?" assumes you did. So not relevant here.

Option C: Extension. I'm not sure. Maybe it refers to "fallacy of extension," where a term is used beyond its proper scope. Hmm, maybe. If someone uses a term in a broader sense than intended, that's a fallacy. But in the given scenario, it's about evaluating something based on unintended criteria. So not sure.

Option D: Compound proposition. That refers to a statement made up of simpler propositions. The fallacy would be in how they're treated. Like, incorrectly asserting or denying parts.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: Extension. Because the argument is extending the scope of what the thing was supposed to do beyond its intended purpose. So, the fallacy is that the argument extends the thing's purpose to include something it wasn't meant to, thus making it flawed for not doing it.

Alternatively, another thought: The fallacy is called "irrelevant conclusion," which is a type of igno ratio elenchi. But that's not among the options either.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think of it this way: The argument is flawed because it's based on an irrelevant point. So the correct fallacy is "irrelevant conclusion," but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is C: Extension.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: Many questions, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: Extension. Because the argument is extending the purpose of the thing beyond its intended scope, thus making it flawed for not meeting those extended criteria.

I think I'll go with C: Extension as the answer.

The question involves identifying a fallacy where something is criticized for failing to do something it was never intended to do. This scenario describes a situation where the argument is based on irrelevant criteria, as the criticism is directed at a point outside the intended purpose of the thing being evaluated.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: ad ignorantium** refers to the appeal to ignorance fallacy, which involves arguing that something is true because it has not been proven false or vice versa. This does not fit the scenario.
- **B: Many questions** refers to the complex question fallacy, where a question assumes a premise that has not been established. This is also not relevant here.
- **C: Extension** could refer to the fallacy of extending the scope or purpose of something beyond its intended limits. This aligns with the scenario, as the argument unfairly criticizes the thing for not meeting criteria it was never meant to satisfy.
- **D: Compound proposition** involves treating a compound statement as simple or vice versa, which does not apply to this situation.

Given the analysis, the best fit is **C: Extension**, as the argument extends the scope of the thing's purpose beyond its intended limits, making it flawed for not meeting irrelevant criteria.

Answer: C
