Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it says. A scientist crosses two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black is dominant over white. The offspring are three-quarters black and one-quarter white. I need to figure out the genotypes of the parents.

Hmm, right. So, dominant is black, so the parents have black coats. But their genotypes could be either BB or Bb because both would show the dominant trait. 

Wait, the possible options involve different crosses. Let me think about the possible crosses and the ratios they produce.

If both parents are BB, then all offspring would be BB, so 100% black. But in this problem, some are white. So BB × BB isn't the answer. So options J is out, I think.

What if one parent is BB and the other is Bb? Let's see. BB × Bb would give all Bb offspring, so all would be black. Again, no white, so that's not it either.

Now, what about Bb × Bb? That's a classic cross. The offspring would be BB : Bb : bb in a 25% 50% 25% ratio. So phenotypically, that's 75% black (since BB and Bb both show black) and 25% white. Oh wait, that's exactly what the question says. So that would mean the parents are both Bb.

Looking at the options, option A is Bb × Bb. That fits. But let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option B says BB × BB and Bb × bb. Wait, but that's two different crosses. I'm not sure. The question says "both have black coats" so both parents are black, so BB × BB would give all black. Bb × bb would give 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So if you have both crosses, maybe some have more white, but the question says three quarters black. So it's not either of these.

Option C is bb × Bb. So one parent is white (bb, because they can't show the dominant black), and the other is Bb. But wait, the parents are both black. So option C can't be right because one parent is white.

Option D is bb × bb, both white. So all offspring are white. But the question says the parents are black, so D is out.

Option E: bb × BB. Again, one parent is white (bb), which can't be because both are black. So E is wrong.

Option F: Bb × bb. So one parent is Bb (black), the other is bb (white). Wait, but parent is supposed to be black. So one parent can't be bb. So F is out.

Option G: Bb × BB. So parents are Bb and BB. Both are black. Their cross would give 50% BB and 50% Bb. So all offspring would be black. No white. So that's not matching the 25% white.

Option H: BB × Bb. Same as G, all offspring are black.

Option I: BB × bb. One parent is white. But parents are both black, so can't be.

So the only option that fits is A: Bb × Bb, which gives 75% black and 25% white.

The question involves determining the genotypes of two black-coated guinea pig parents that produce offspring with a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (75% black and 25% white). Black coat (B) is dominant over white coat (b). Since both parents have black coats, their genotypes could be either BB or Bb. 

To analyze the options:

- **Option A (Bb × Bb):** This cross produces offspring in a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb ratio. Phenotypically, this results in 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb), which matches the observed ratio. This is a valid option.

- **Option B (BB × BB and Bb × bb):** BB × BB produces all BB (black) offspring, and Bb × bb produces 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Combining these does not yield the observed 3:1 ratio.

- **Option C (bb × Bb):** One parent is white (bb), but the question specifies both parents are black. This option is invalid.

- **Option D (bb × bb):** Both parents are white, producing all white offspring. This contradicts the observed data.

- **Option E (bb × BB):** One parent is white (bb), which contradicts the condition that both parents are black. Invalid.

- **Option F (Bb × bb):** One parent is white (bb), which again contradicts the condition that both parents are black. Invalid.

- **Option G (Bb × BB):** This cross produces 50% BB and 50% Bb offspring, all of which are black. It does not produce any white offspring, so it does not match the observed ratio.

- **Option H (BB × Bb):** This is the same as Option G, producing all black offspring. It does not match the observed ratio.

- **Option I (BB × bb):** One parent is white (bb), which contradicts the condition that both parents are black. Invalid.

- **Option J (BB × BB):** This cross produces all BB offspring, resulting in 100% black offspring. It does not match the observed ratio.

The only option consistent with the observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio and the condition that both parents are black is **Option A (Bb × Bb)**.
