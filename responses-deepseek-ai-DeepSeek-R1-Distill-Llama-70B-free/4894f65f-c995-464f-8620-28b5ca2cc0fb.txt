Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question says that a particular character in an animal species is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring, but never from the father. And I have to conclude the mode of inheritance from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that genes are usually passed from both parents, but there are exceptions. Let me think about different inheritance patterns. So, like, autosomal vs sex-linked, and other possibilities like mitochondrial inheritance.

Wait, mitochondrial DNA comes to mind. Because mitochondria are passed down from the mother's egg, not the sperm. So if a trait is always from the mother, maybe it's mitochondrial. But wait, the options don't say mitochondrial directly. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is "Extrachromosomal inheritance." I think extrachromosomal refers to things like plasmids in bacteria, but in humans or animals, it would be mitochondrial DNA or chloroplast DNA, which are outside the nucleus. So that's probably the case here.

Other options: option C is sex-linked dominant. That would mean the gene is on the X chromosome. But if the father has it, he'd pass it to daughters (since he gives X to daughters), but not sons. So if the trait isn't coming from the father, maybe it's on the X but only from mother. But wait, the question says the father never transmits it. So if it's X-linked, then the father could pass it to daughters if he has it. So in some cases, the father could transmit it. But the question says never, so maybe that's not it.

Option D says absence of certain genes in the father. So if the father doesn't have the gene, he can't pass it. But that's more about whether the father has the gene, not the mode of inheritance. Like, it's a case where the father is homozygous recessive, maybe, but that's not necessarily about the mode.

Option A is mutation. That's a random change, not about inheritance patterns.

Option B, codominance, is when both alleles show. Like blood types. Not related to parent transmission.

Option E is polygenic, which means multiple genes. Doesn't explain parent-specific transmission.

Option F, environmental influence. That's about non-genetic factors, so probably not the answer.

Option H, autosomal recessive. That would depend on both parents contributing, but the question is about transmission, not expression.

Option I, inheritance from the father. Well, the question says the trait never comes from the father, so this is the opposite.

Option J, incomplete dominance, is about how alleles express, not transmission.

So going back, the main point is that the trait is always from the mother. So the mode is probably extrachromosomal, like mitochondrial. So the answer should be G.

Wait, another thought: could it be X-linked? Like, if it's on the X and the father never passes it because he only gives Y to sons and X to daughters. So for a trait to never come from the father, maybe the gene is on the X. Because fathers can pass X-linked genes to daughters but not sons. But the question says the trait is never transmitted from the father. So if it's X-linked dominant, fathers can pass it to daughters, so the daughters would have the trait. But the question states that the father never transmits the trait, so that would be the case only if the gene isn't on the X. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the scenario says the character is always transmitted from the mother but never from the father. So if it's X-linked and the mother is the carrier, the father can't pass it because he doesn't have another X. Hmm, no, wait: if the gene is X-linked recessive, then fathers can't pass it to sons because they give Y. But they can pass it to daughters if they have the gene on their X. So for a trait that's never passed from the father, perhaps it's X-linked recessive? But then the mother must have it. But the question is about the mode of inheritance, not the specific scenario of who has the gene.

Alternatively, the gene is on the Y chromosome, but then only sons would get it, but the question says the trait is never transmitted by the father. So that's not it.

So going back, the only mode that fits is extrachromosomal, like mitochondrial. Because the father's sperm doesn't contribute mitochondria to the embryo. So the trait would come only from the mother. So the answer is G.

If a particular character in a species is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father, it suggests a specific mode of inheritance. The key detail is that the trait is exclusively maternally inherited, which points to extrachromosomal inheritance. This is because extrachromosomal elements, such as mitochondrial DNA, are passed down from the mother via the egg, as sperm do not contribute mitochondria to the embryo.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Mutation** refers to random genetic changes and does not explain the consistent maternal transmission.  
- **B: Codominance** involves both alleles being expressed, unrelated to transmission patterns.  
- **C: Sex-linked dominant inheritance** would allow fathers to transmit the trait to daughters, contradicting the "never from the father" condition.  
- **D: Absence of certain genes in the father** describes a scenario where the father lacks the gene but does not address the inheritance mechanism.  
- **E: Polygenic inheritance** involves multiple genes and does not explain exclusive maternal transmission.  
- **F: Environmental influence** is non-genetic and irrelevant to the question.  
- **G: Extrachromosomal inheritance** fits perfectly, as it explains why the trait is passed only from the mother.  
- **H: Autosomal recessive inheritance** depends on both parents contributing alleles, inconsistent with the exclusivity of maternal transmission.  
- **I: Inheritance from the father** contradicts the premise of the question.  
- **J: Incomplete dominance** pertains to how alleles are expressed, not transmission patterns.  

Thus, the most plausible conclusion is **extrachromosomal inheritance**, making **G** the correct answer.
