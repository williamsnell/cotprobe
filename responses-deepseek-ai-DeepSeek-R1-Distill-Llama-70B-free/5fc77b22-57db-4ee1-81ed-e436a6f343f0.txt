Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the heat of vaporization of water at 35°C and 1 atm. The normal boiling point is given as 9720 cal/mole. Hmm, wait, actually, I think I might be mixing something up. Oh wait, no, the normal boiling point is a temperature, but the question says 9720 cal/mole—wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe that's the heat of vaporization at the normal boiling point. Oh right, because the normal boiling point is 100°C, so the heat of vaporization at 100°C is 9720 cal/mole.

So the question is asking for the heat of vaporization at 35°C, which is lower than 100°C. I remember that the heat of vaporization can change with temperature. To calculate this, I think I need to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but wait, that equation is for the vapor pressure as a function of temperature, right? Or maybe I should use Kirchhoff's Law. Oh, right, Kirchhoff's Law is about the change in heat of reaction with temperature, but here we're dealing with a phase change.

Wait, another approach: the heat of vaporization at a different temperature can be found using the Cp values for the liquid and gas phases. Oh right, because when you change the temperature, the heat required will change based on the heat capacities.

The formula I think is ΔH_vap at T2 = ΔH_vap at T1 + ∫(T1 to T2) [Cp(g) - Cp(l)] dT.

Yes, that sounds right. Because when you have a phase change, the heat of vaporization at another temperature is adjusted by the heat capacities of the gas and liquid phases over the temperature change.

So the given data are:

At normal boiling point (100°C, I suppose), ΔH_vap = 9720 cal/mol.

We need to find ΔH_vap at 35°C.

Wait, but wait, 35°C is below 100°C, so the vaporization heat should be higher? Or lower? Hmm. Because when you go to a lower temperature, the heat of vaporization increases. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the heat of vaporization is the amount of heat you need to supply to turn liquid into gas. At higher temperatures, maybe it's easier, so less heat is needed. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. At higher temps, the molecules have more energy, so maybe the ΔH_vap is lower. Let me think: at the boiling point, all the heat goes into breaking the intermolecular forces. At lower temps, you need more because you have to not only break the forces but also supply more heat because the molecules are moving slower. Or wait, no, the opposite. Wait, let me get this straight.

Wait, the formula is ΔH2 = ΔH1 + (T2 - T1) * (Cp_gas - Cp_liquid). Wait, but that's for the change in enthalpy of the process. Wait, but wait, no, the heat of vaporization is the enthalpy change for the phase transition. So if the temperature changes, the Cp values affect it.

So let me outline the steps.

Given:
ΔH_vap at T1 (100°C, 373 K) = 9720 cal/mol.
We need to find ΔH_vap at T2 (35°C, 308 K).

The formula is:

ΔH_vap(T2) = ΔH_vap(T1) + ∫(from T1 to T2) [Cp(g) - Cp(l)] dT.

Wait, but wait, since T2 is less than T1, I'm going from higher to lower temperature. So the integral is from T1 to T2, which is a negative change.

But wait, let me think about the formula. Let me rederive it. The enthalpy change for vaporization at different temperatures.

At T1, the process is H2O(l) → H2O(g), ΔH1.

At T2, the same process but at a different temperature. So the total ΔH at T2 would be ΔH1 plus the enthalpy change of cooling both the liquid and the gas from T1 to T2.

Wait, no, more accurately, to calculate the heat of vaporization at T2, we can think of it as:

1. Heat the liquid from T2 to T1: q1 = Cp(l) * (T1 - T2)
2. Vaporize at T1: q2 = ΔH1
3. Cool the gas from T1 to T2: q3 = Cp(g) * (T2 - T1)

So the total heat at T2 would be q1 + q2 + q3 = [Cp(l)(T1-T2)] + ΔH1 + [Cp(g)(T2 - T1)].

Hmm, but that sums up to ΔH1 + (T1-T2)(Cp(l) - Cp(g)).

Wait, so ΔH_vap(T2) = ΔH1 + (T1 - T2)(Cp(l) - Cp(g)) * (average or something?), but wait, because Cp's are given as functions. Oh wait, in the problem, Cp(l) is constant, but Cp(g) is a function of temperature.

Wait, no, the problem states:

C_p for H2O(l) is 18.06 cal/(deg·mol), which is a constant, independent of temperature.

C_p for H2O(g) is given as 7.219 + 2.374e-3 T + 2.67e-7 T^2 cal/(deg·mol).

So the Cp for gas is a function of temperature, so when calculating the integral, I need to integrate Cp(g) from T1 to T2, but since T1 and T2 are in Celsius or Kelvin, but I think we'll convert them to Kelvin for calculations.

Wait, but the formula I derived earlier was:

ΔH_vap(T2) = ΔH_vap(T1) + ∫(T1 to T2) [Cp(g) - Cp(l)] dT.

Wait, but in the earlier step-by-step, the calculation ended up as ΔH1 + (T1-T2)(Cp(l) - Cp(g)), but that's assuming Cp is constant. However, since Cp(g) varies with T, I can't just use an average value. So I have to integrate.

But wait, the problem states that Cp(l) is independent of temperature, so it's a constant. But Cp(g) is a function of T.

So, the integral becomes:

Integral from T1 to T2 of [Cp(g) - Cp(l)] dT.

Which is equal to Integral Cp(g) dT from T1 to T2 minus Integral Cp(l) dT from T1 to T2.

So let me compute each part.

First, let's compute the integral of Cp(g) dT.

Cp(g) = 7.219 + 2.374e-3 T + 2.67e-7 T^2.

So the integral from T1 to T2 is:

Integral = 7.219*(T2 - T1) + (2.374e-3)/2 * (T2^2 - T1^2) + (2.67e-7)/3 * (T2^3 - T1^3).

Similarly, the integral of Cp(l) is 18.06*(T2 - T1).

So putting it all together:

ΔH_vap(T2) = ΔH1 + [Integral Cp(g) dT - Integral Cp(l) dT] from T1 to T2.

So let's plug in the numbers.

First, T1 is the normal boiling point, which is 100°C. Let's convert that to Kelvin: 373 K.

T2 is 35°C: 308 K.

Wait, wait, but the Cp(g) function is given in terms of Celsius or Kelvin? The problem says C_p is in cal deg^-1 mole^-1. So T is in Celsius or Kelvin? Because in the expression, 2.374e-3 T, T is in Kelvin? Or in Celsius? Hmm, this is a point of confusion.

Wait, this could be a problem. Because if T is in Celsius, then when T is 100°C, the term 2.374e-3*T would be 0.2374 cal/(mol·K), which doesn't make sense for a physical property because it's dependent on the temperature scale. So I think T must be in Kelvin. So we should convert T1 and T2 to Kelvin.

So T1 = 373 K, T2 = 308 K.

Wait, but wait, wait, let me think again. The formula for Cp(g) is given as a function of T, but the units are cal/(deg·mol). So probably, T is in Celsius, but that would complicate the integration because when you integrate with respect to T in Celsius, the limits would be in Celsius. Alternatively, perhaps T is in Kelvin. Hmm.

But the problem doesn't specify, but let's think. The standard approach is that when Cp is given as a function of T, and T is in K, but in this problem, the data is given as 7.219 + 2.374e-3 T + 2.67e-7 T^2, with T probably in K. Let me proceed with T in K.

So T1 = 373 K, T2=308 K. The difference is ΔT = T2 - T1 = -65 K.

Wait, but now I'm integrating from T1=373 to T2=308, so the integral from higher to lower temperature. So let me compute each term.

Compute Integral Cp(g) dT from 373 to 308.

Cp(g) = 7.219 + 2.374e-3 T + 2.67e-7 T^2.

Integral = 7.219*(308 - 373) + (2.374e-3)/2 * (308^2 - 373^2) + (2.67e-7)/3 * (308^3 - 373^3).

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: 7.219 * (308 - 373) = 7.219 * (-65) = calculate that.

7.219 * 65 = let's compute:

7 * 65 = 455, 0.219*65≈14.235 → total ≈469.235. So with the negative, it's -469.235 cal/(mol).

Second term: (2.374e-3)/2 = 1.187e-3.

Compute 308^2 = 94,864; 373^2=139,129.

So (94,864 - 139,129) = -44,265.

Multiply by 1.187e-3: -44,265 * 0.001187 ≈ let's compute 44,265 * 0.001 = 44.265, 44,265 * 0.000187≈≈8.27 → total ≈52.535. So negative: -52.535 cal/(mol).

Third term: (2.67e-7)/3 ≈ 8.9e-8.

Compute 308^3 = 308 * 308 *308. Let's compute 308^2=94,864. 308 * 94,864 = Let's compute 300*94864=28,459,200; 8*94,864=758,912 → total 29,218,112.

373^3 =373 *373 *373. Let's compute 373^2=139,129. 373 *139,129. Let's compute 300*139,129=41,738,700; 73*139,129≈10,135,417 → total≈51,874,117.

So (29,218,112 - 51,874,117) = -22,656,005.

Multiply by 8.9e-8: -22,656,005 *8.9e-8 ≈ Let's compute 22,656,005 *8.9e-8. 22,656,005 ≈2.2656e7. 2.2656e7 *8.9e-8 = 2.2656 *8.9 *1e-1= (approx 20.18) *0.1=2.018. So this term is approximately -2.018 cal/mol.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

22,656,005 *8.9e-8 = (22,656,005) * (8.9 x 10^-8) 

= (2.2656005e7) * (8.9e-8) 

= 2.2656005 * 8.9 * 1e-1 

Because 1e7 *1e-8 =1e-1.

2.2656 *8.9 = let's compute:

2 *8.9 =17.8

0.2656 *8.9 ≈ 2.365

Total ≈ 17.8 +2.365 = 20.165 → 20.165 *0.1=2.0165 → so about 2.0165. So negative: -2.0165 cal/mol.

So adding all three terms:

First term: -469.235

Second term: -52.535

Third term: -2.0165

Total integral of Cp(g) dT: -469.235 -52.535 -2.0165 ≈ -523.7865 cal/mol.

Now compute the integral of Cp(l) dT from T1 to T2.

Cp(l)=18.06 cal/(deg·mol). So integral is 18.06*(308 -373) =18.06*(-65) = -1173.9 cal/mol.

So the difference [Integral Cp(g) - Integral Cp(l)] = (-523.7865) - (-1173.9) = (-523.7865) +1173.9 = 650.1135 cal/mol.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is:

ΔH_vap(T2) = ΔH1 + [Integral Cp(g) dT - Integral Cp(l) dT]

So the change is Integral Cp(g) - Integral Cp(l) = (-523.7865) - (-1173.9) = 650.1135 cal/mol.

So ΔH_vap at 35°C is 9720 + 650.1135 ≈ 9720 +650 = 10370.1135 cal/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 10,370 cal/mol. So that's the answer.
</think>

To calculate the heat of vaporization of water at 35°C and 1 atm, we use the relationship:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}}(T_2) = \Delta H_{\text{vap}}(T_1) + \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \left[C_p(\text{g}) - C_p(\text{l})\right] dT
\]

### Given Data:
- **Normal boiling point**: \( T_1 = 100^\circ \text{C} = 373 \, \text{K} \)
- **Heat of vaporization at \( T_1 \)**: \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}}(T_1) = 9720 \, \text{cal/mol} \)
- **Temperature at which we need \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} \)**: \( T_2 = 35^\circ \text{C} = 308 \, \text{K} \)
- **Heat capacities**:
  - \( C_p(\text{l}) = 18.06 \, \text{cal/(deg·mol)} \) (constant)
  - \( C_p(\text{g}) = 7.219 + 2.374 \times 10^{-3} T + 2.67 \times 10^{-7} T^2 \, \text{cal/(deg·mol)} \)

### Step 1: Integral of \( C_p(\text{g}) \)
The integral of \( C_p(\text{g}) \) from \( T_1 \) to \( T_2 \) is:

\[
\int_{T_1}^{T_2} C_p(\text{g}) \, dT = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \left(7.219 + 2.374 \times 10^{-3} T + 2.67 \times 10^{-7} T^2\right) dT
\]

Breaking it into terms:
1. \( \int 7.219 \, dT = 7.219 (T_2 - T_1) \)
2. \( \int 2.374 \times 10^{-3} T \, dT = \frac{2.374 \times 10^{-3}}{2} \left(T_2^2 - T_1^2\right) \)
3. \( \int 2.67 \times 10^{-7} T^2 \, dT = \frac{2.67 \times 10^{-7}}{3} \left(T_2^3 - T_1^3\right) \)

Substituting \( T_1 = 373 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 308 \, \text{K} \):
1. \( 7.219 (308 - 373) = 7.219 \times (-65) = -469.235 \, \text{cal/mol} \)
2. \( \frac{2.374 \times 10^{-3}}{2} \left(308^2 - 373^2\right) = 1.187 \times 10^{-3} \left(94864 - 139129\right) = 1.187 \times 10^{-3} \times (-44265) = -52.535 \, \text{cal/mol} \)
3. \( \frac{2.67 \times 10^{-7}}{3} \left(308^3 - 373^3\right) = 8.9 \times 10^{-8} \left(29218111 - 51874117\right) = 8.9 \times 10^{-8} \times (-22656006) = -2.016 \, \text{cal/mol} \)

Total integral of \( C_p(\text{g}) \):
\[
\int_{T_1}^{T_2} C_p(\text{g}) \, dT = -469.235 - 52.535 - 2
