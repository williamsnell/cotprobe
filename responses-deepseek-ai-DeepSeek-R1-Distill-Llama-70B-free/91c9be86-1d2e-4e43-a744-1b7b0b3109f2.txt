Okay, so I have this question about Gresham's Law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through what I remember about this topic.

I remember that Gresham's Law is an economic principle, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. I think it has something to do with money, specifically how different types of money interact in an economy. 

Wait, I think it's about how bad money drives out good money. So, if there are two forms of currency in circulation, one being more valuable (good money) and the other less so (bad money), people tend to hold onto the good money and use the bad money for transactions. This causes the bad money to circulate more, pushing the good money out of circulation.

Let me see the options again. Option A says "Bad money drives out good." That sounds familiar. Option D is the opposite, "Good money drives out bad," which I don't think is correct. I might be mixing things up, but I'm pretty sure Gresham's Law is about the bad driving out the good.

Another way to think about it: if both types of money are accepted as legal tender but one has higher intrinsic value, people will keep the valuable one and spend the less valuable. For example, if a country has both a gold coin and a copper coin with the same face value, people would spend the copper and save the gold. So the copper (bad money) circulates, and gold (good) is hoarded.

So looking at the options, A is the correct statement of Gresham's Law. Let me just make sure I'm not confusing it with any other laws. Oh right, there's also the quantity theory of money, which is about the quantity of money affecting its value. But that's not what this question is about. 

So I'm confident that the answer is A.

The correct answer is A: Bad money drives out good. This is because Gresham's Law states that when two forms of money are in circulation, the less valuable (bad) money tends to be used more in transactions, causing the more valuable (good) money to be hoarded and thus driven out of circulation.

Answer: A
