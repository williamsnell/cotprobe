Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about atoms and their mass contributions. Hmm, I need to figure out which part contributes less than 1/1000 of the atom's mass. Let me think about what I remember from my chemistry classes.

Alright, I remember that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, which is really heavy, while electrons are much lighter and orbit around the nucleus.

Wait, the question is about what contributes less than 1/1000 of the mass. So, which part is that? I think electrons are super light. Like, their mass is much smaller compared to protons and neutrons. Oh right, the mass of an electron is about 1/1836 that of a proton. So electrons contribute very little to the atom's total mass.

But the question says "less than 1/1000 of the mass of any atom is contributed by..." So it's not about the majority, but the minority contributor. So the majority comes from the nucleus, right? Because protons and neutrons are much heavier.

So the options are about which parts contribute that small fraction. Let me look at the options again.

Option G is the electrons. Oh, but wait, the question could be a bit tricky. Let me think about the total mass. The nucleus (protons and neutrons) makes up most of the atom's mass. Electrons contribute very little. So in an atom, electrons contribute less than 1/1000 of the total mass. But wait, let me make sure.

The mass of a proton is approximately 1836 times that of an electron. So each electron contributes about 0.05% of the mass of a proton. So for a carbon atom, which has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons, the electrons' total mass would be negligible compared to the nucleus.

Wait, but wait another thing. The mass of the atom is the sum of protons, neutrons, and electrons. But the majority comes from protons and neutrons. So the electrons' mass is a tiny fraction. So the question is asking which part contributes less than 1/1000, so that's the electrons.

Looking at the options again. Option G says the electrons. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, let me check other options to be sure. Option B is electrons and protons. No, because protons contribute a lot, not a small fraction. Option H is protons and electrons—same issue. Option I is electrons and neutrons—no, neutrons are heavy. Option J is electrons and nucleus—nucleus is most of the mass. So no.

So the correct answer is G.

The question asks which part contributes less than 1/1000 of the mass of any atom. Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons, with protons and neutrons residing in the nucleus and electrons orbiting around it. Protons and neutrons are significantly heavier than electrons, and the nucleus accounts for the vast majority of an atom's mass. Electrons, being much lighter, contribute only a negligible fraction of the total mass.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

- **Option G (the electrons):** Electrons are extremely light, with a mass approximately 1/1836 that of a proton. Their total contribution to the atom's mass is indeed less than 1/1000, making this the correct choice.
- Other options involve combinations that include protons, neutrons, or the nucleus, all of which contribute significantly to the atom's mass and are therefore incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: the electrons**.
