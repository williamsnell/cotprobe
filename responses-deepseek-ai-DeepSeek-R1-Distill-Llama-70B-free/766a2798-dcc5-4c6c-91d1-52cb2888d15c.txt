Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the immediate effect on the money supply when a bank receives a deposit and then makes a loan. Specifically, Bank A gets a $1000 deposit in cash from Mr. X, and then they grant a $500 loan to Mr. Y. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that money supply isn't just the cash people have; it also includes deposits in banks. So when someone deposits cash into a bank, that should affect the money supply. Wait, but how?

Let me think. When Mr. X deposits $1000 in currency into Bank A, what happens? Currency is part of the money supply, right? So if he takes cash and puts it into the bank, the cash goes into the bank's vault. So the money in circulation (currency) decreases by $1000, but the bank's reserves increase by $1000. But does that change the overall money supply?

Wait, I think the money supply includes both currency and demand deposits. So when Mr. X puts his cash into the bank, the currency in circulation decreases, but his deposit account increases. So the total money supply (M1) should stay the same because one form (currency) is converted into another (deposit). So the initial effect of the deposit is no change in the money supply.

Now, the next part is the bank granting a loan of $500 to Mr. Y. When a bank makes a loan, it credits the borrower's account. So Mr. Y's deposit increases by $500. This is new money being created because the bank is adding to the deposits. So this should increase the money supply by $500.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. When the bank lends $500, it's creating new money. So the total deposits go up by $500. So the initial deposit of $1000 didn't change the money supply, but the loan increases it by $500.

So the overall immediate effect is an increase of $500 in the money supply. But looking at the options, the question is about the immediate effect of both actions together. So the deposit of $1000 doesn't change the money supply, and the loan adds $500. So the total change is an increase of $500.

Wait, but wait another thing. When the bank receives the $1000 deposit, it's just moving money from one form (cash) to another (deposit). So the money supply remains the same. Then, when the bank makes a $500 loan, it's adding new money. So the net effect is adding $500 to the money supply.

Looking at the options, option B is "add $500 to the money supply." So the correct answer should be B.

But let me double-check. The initial deposit doesn't change M1 because it's just a transfer from currency to deposits. The loan creates new deposits, so increases M1 by $500. So yes, B makes sense.

The immediate effect on the money supply can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Deposit of $1000 in Currency**: When Mr. X deposits $1000 in cash into Bank A, the currency in circulation decreases by $1000, but the bank's reserves increase by $1000. Since the money supply (M1) includes both currency and demand deposits, the conversion of cash into a bank deposit does not change the total money supply. The money is simply moving from one form (currency) to another (deposit).

2. **Loan of $500 to Mr. Y**: When Bank A grants a $500 loan to Mr. Y, it credits Mr. Y's account, increasing deposits by $500. This action creates new money in the economy, as the bank is adding to the money supply through the creation of new deposits.

Combining these two actions, the deposit of $1000 does not change the money supply, but the loan of $500 increases the money supply by $500. Therefore, the immediate effect on the money supply is an increase of $500.

**Correct Answer: B**
