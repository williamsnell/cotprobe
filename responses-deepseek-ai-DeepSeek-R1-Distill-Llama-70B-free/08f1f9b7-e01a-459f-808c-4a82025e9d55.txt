The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What do thecodonsAUG, UAG, UAA, and UGA code for?

Options:

A: AUG codes for aspartic acid, while UAG codes for tryptophan, UAA for cysteine, and UGA for arginine.
B: AUG codes for serine and is a regular codon in the middle of the mRNA sequence. UAG, UAA, and UGA code for the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, respectively.
C: AUG codes for methionine and signals the end of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are terminator codons, they code for various amino acids.
D: AUG codes for tyrosine, UAG, UAA, and UGA are initiator codons.
E: AUG codes for methionine and signals the start of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are terminator codons, they code for no amino acids and signal the end of a polypeptide chain.
F: AUG codes for glycine and is an elongation codon, while UAG, UAA, and UGA code for the start of protein synthesis.
G: AUG is a terminator codon that signals the end of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are non-standard codons that incorporate unusual amino acids.
H: AUG codes for alanine and signals the continuation of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are codons that code for branching amino acids.
I: AUG codes for valine, while UAG, UAA, and UGA code for essential amino acids.
J: AUG codes for leucine and signals the start of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are initiator codons, they code for no amino acids and signal the start of a polypeptide chain.

Okay, so I've got this question about codons and what they code for. Hmm, I remember that codons are sequences of three nucleotides in mRNA that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals. Let me think through this.

The question is asking about four specific codons: AUG, UAG, UAA, and UGA. I need to remember what each of these does.

First, I think about AUG. I recall that AUG is a special codon. Oh right, it's the start codon. It signals the beginning of a protein sequence. And I think it codes for methionine, which is an amino acid. So in translation, when the ribosome sees AUG, it starts building the protein and adds methionine as the first amino acid.

Now, what about the others? UAG, UAA, UGA. I remember these are stop codons. They signal the end of the protein synthesis. They don't code for any amino acid; instead, when the ribosome reads them, it releases the protein and stops translation. So these are terminator codons, not coding for anything.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly states that AUG codes for methionine and is the start, while the others are stops.

Let's go through the options:

Option A: AUG for aspartic acid? No, that's wrong because AUG is methionine. So A is out.

Option B: AUG codes for serine? No, wrong again. Also, it says UAG etc. code for amino acids, which they don't. So B is incorrect.

Option C: AUG codes for methionine and signals end? No, it's the start, not end. So C is wrong.

Option D: AUG is tyrosine? No, that's incorrect. Also, the others are initiator, which they're not. D is wrong.

Option E: AUG codes for methionine and starts synthesis. The other three are terminator codons, coding for nothing. That fits what I was thinking. So E looks correct.

Option F: AUG is glycine? No, that's wrong. F is out.

Option G: AUG is terminator? No, it's the start. So G is wrong.

Option H: AUG is alanine and continues. No, it's start, not alanine. H is wrong.

Option I: AUG is valine. No, wrong again. I is out.

Option J: AUG is leucine and start. No, it's methionine. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer is E. It correctly identifies AUG as the start codon coding for methionine, and the others as stop codons that don't code for amino acids.

The question asks about the function of the codons AUG, UAG, UAA, and UGA. 

- AUG is the start codon, coding for methionine and signaling the beginning of protein synthesis. 
- UAG, UAA, and UGA are stop codons, which do not code for any amino acids but instead signal the termination of protein synthesis.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. AUG codes for methionine, not aspartic acid, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not coding for amino acids.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. AUG codes for methionine, not serine, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not coding for amino acids.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. AUG signals the start, not the end, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not coding for amino acids.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. AUG codes for methionine, not tyrosine, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not initiator codons.
- **Option E**: Correct. AUG codes for methionine and signals the start of protein synthesis. UAG, UAA, and UGA are stop codons that do not code for amino acids.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. AUG codes for methionine, not glycine, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not start codons.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. AUG is a start codon, not a terminator codon.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. AUG codes for methionine, not alanine, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not branching codons.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. AUG codes for methionine, not valine, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not coding for amino acids.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. AUG codes for methionine, not leucine, and UAG, UAA, UGA are stop codons, not initiator codons.

The correct answer is **E**.
