Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the Carnot efficiency of a steam engine. Hmm, I think I remember that the Carnot efficiency is related to the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs. Oh right, it's a formula involving the ratio of the cold temperature to the hot temperature subtracted from one.

Wait, the formula is η = 1 - (T_cold / T_hot). But wait, I think the temperatures need to be in Kelvin, right? Because when dealing with thermodynamic efficiencies, you have to use absolute temperatures.

So the problem states that the steam is operating at 100°C and discharging at 60°C. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 100°C is the temperature of the steam, and 60°C is the discharge temperature. So the hot reservoir is at 100°C, and the cold is at 60°C.

Wait, no, wait a second. Steam engines typically operate by taking heat from a high-temperature source and releasing it to a lower-temperature sink. So the high temperature here would be the temperature of the steam before it does work, which is 100°C. The low temperature is where it's discharging, so 60°C.

So I need to convert both temperatures to Kelvin. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 100°C + 273.15 is 373.15 K. And 60°C is 333.15 K.

Wait wait, wait a minute. I'm a bit confused. Is the high temperature the source and the low the sink? So in the Carnot cycle, the engine absorbs heat from the hot reservoir and releases it to the cold reservoir. So the efficiency is based on those two temperatures.

So the formula is η = 1 - (Tc / Th), where Tc is the cold temperature and Th is the hot temperature, both in Kelvin.

So plugging in the numbers: Tc is 333.15 K, Th is 373.15 K.

So let me compute Tc/Th first. 333.15 divided by 373.15. Let me calculate that.

333.15 / 373.15. Let me see, 333 divided by 373 is approximately 0.893. So 0.893.

Then 1 minus 0.893 is approximately 0.107. So the efficiency would be about 0.107, or 10.7%.

Looking at the options, the choices are A to J. Let me check the options again. Option J is 0.11, which is 11% efficiency. That's very close to our calculated value of approximately 10.7%. So I think the correct answer is J.

Wait but wait, another thought. Did I mix up the temperatures? Because sometimes the high temperature is where heat is absorbed, and the low where it's expelled. So in this case, the engine is operating on steam at 100°C, which would be the high temperature, and discharging to 60°C, the low. So the formula should be 1 - (60+273)/(100+273) as I did, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperatures are in different units? No, the problem says to assume 298.15 K unless otherwise stated, but the temperatures given are 100 and 60 degrees Celsius, so I think adding 273 is correct.

So the calculation is right. 0.107, so the closest option is J, 0.11.

To calculate the Carnot efficiency of the primitive steam engine, we use the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{T_{\text{cold}}}{T_{\text{hot}}}
\]

where \( T_{\text{cold}} \) and \( T_{\text{hot}} \) are the absolute temperatures of the cold and hot reservoirs, respectively, in Kelvin. The problem specifies that the steam operates at \( 100^\circ \mathrm{C} \) (hot reservoir) and discharges at \( 60^\circ \mathrm{C} \) (cold reservoir). Converting these temperatures to Kelvin:

\[
T_{\text{hot}} = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 \, \mathrm{K}, \quad T_{\text{cold}} = 60 + 273.15 = 333.15 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\eta = 1 - \frac{333.15}{373.15}.
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{333.15}{373.15} \approx 0.893.
\]

Then, subtract from 1:

\[
\eta = 1 - 0.893 = 0.107.
\]

The efficiency is approximately \( 0.107 \), or \( 10.7\% \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( 0.11 \), corresponding to option J.
