Question:

An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?

Options:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count
B: Decreased basophil count
C: Decreased macrophage activity
D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration
E: Increased macrophage activity
F: Decreased neutrophil count
G: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration
H: Increased eosinophil count
I: Increased lymphocyte count
J: Increased basophil count

Okay, so I've got this question here about the immune system and stress. Hmm, let me think through it. The scenario is that medical students have more upper respiratory infections during finals week. The hypothesis is that the stress of studying affects their immune system, making them more susceptible.

The question asks which lab finding supports this. So I need to connect stress to immune changes. From what I remember, stress triggers the release of cortisol. Cortisol is a steroid hormone, part of the glucocorticoids. I think it's released in response to stress and has various effects on the body.

Cortisol's effects on the immune system: I recall that cortisol suppresses the immune system. It does this by affecting certain cells. For example, it can cause lymphocytes to decrease because cortisol is known to induce apoptosis in lymphocytes or maybe reduce their circulation. Also, I think cortisol affects the distribution of white blood cells. Like, after a stressful event, you might see changes in the differential count.

Looking at the options, the lab findings are about various blood cell counts and cortisol levels. So if stress is high during finals, cortisol should be up. Let me look at the options.

Option D: Increased AM serum cortisol. That makes sense because during stress, cortisol is elevated. Morning cortisol is usually higher naturally, but if stress is acute, maybe it's even higher than usual in the morning.

Other options: Decreased lymphocyte count (Option A). Since cortisol can reduce lymphocytes, this would support the hypothesis. So both A and D could be correct. Wait, but the question is about which finding supports the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that stress (causing immune suppression) leads to more infections. So the lab finding should show an indicator of immune suppression.

Let me think again. Cortisol is an immune suppressant. So if cortisol is higher, the immune system is more suppressed. So both an increase in cortisol (D) and a decrease in lymphocytes (A) would point to immune suppression. But the question is, which finding supports the hypothesis.

Wait, the question is asking which laboratory finding is most likely to support the hypothesis. The hypothesis links stress (exams) to immune issues leading to more infections. So the lab should show either the effect of stress (high cortisol) or the effect on the immune cells.

But let's think about which of these is a direct effect. High cortisol is a direct marker of stress. So if D is present, it shows that the stress is indeed causing increased cortisol, which in turn affects the immune system. Alternatively, if the immune cells are down, like in A, that also supports the hypothesis.

I think the question is about the most likely finding. So in exams, stress increases cortisol, which then leads to decreased immune cells. So which of the options is more directly linked to this?

Another point: cortisol has a diurnal rhythm. It's higher in the morning and lower at night. So the AM cortisol would be the correct time to measure it. So D says increased AM cortisol, which is correct.

So if a student is stressed, their cortisol levels go up. High cortisol impairs the immune response, making them more susceptible to infections. So both D and A could be correct, but which is more likely to be the finding that supports the hypothesis.

Wait, the question is about what laboratory finding supports the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that stress (exams) affects the immune system. So the lab finding could be either the stress marker (cortisol) or the immune effect (lower lymphocytes, etc.).

Which is a better indicator? I think that increased cortisol is a direct indicator of stress, which in turn affects the immune system. So if D is correct, that would support the hypothesis because it shows that the students are indeed stressed, and the stress is causing the immune suppression.

Alternatively, if the lymphocytes are low, that supports the immune suppression part. So both A and D are relevant, but the question is which is more likely.

Wait, another thought: The immune system's response under stress isn't just about cortisol. There's also adrenaline and other hormones. But cortisol is a major player in immune suppression.

So, if the students have higher cortisol, that directly indicates stress. Then, the next step is that the immune system is compromised. So which of the options is the best support?

The question is about the lab finding in the students during exam week. So if their cortisol is high, that would directly support the idea that stress is causing immune issues.

So the correct answer would be D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration.

Another option is A: decreased lymphocyte count. But sometimes, acute stress can cause an increase in certain white blood cells due to demargination. Wait, no, I think with chronic stress, cortisol leads to lymphopenia (low lymphocytes).

So if the exam period is a time of acute stress, maybe the lymphocytes are redistributed, not necessarily decreased. But finals week is probably a period of chronic stress, so lymphocyte count would be lower.

So the options are D and A. But which is the better fit?

The question is about which supports the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that stress (exams) affects the immune system, leading to more infections. So the lab finding could be either the immune system change (like low lymphocytes) or the stress indicator (high cortisol).

But the question is about which is most likely. So, for example, if the students have increased cortisol, that's a direct sign of stress. If their lymphocytes are low, that's a sign of immune suppression. Both support the hypothesis, but which is the better option.

Wait, the question is asking for the finding that supports the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that stress (the cause) leads to immune suppression (the effect). So a finding that shows the effect would support the hypothesis. So, if they have more infections, and their lymphocytes are low, that supports the idea that their immune system is compromised.

Alternatively, if their cortisol is high, that shows the stress part, which is the cause. So which is more directly supporting the hypothesis?

Hmm. The question is tricky. But the hypothesis is about the effect of stress on the immune system. So the lab finding should relate to the immune system's function. So a lower lymphocyte count (A) would indicate immune suppression, which makes them more susceptible to infections. Therefore, A would support the hypothesis.

Wait, but what does cortisol do? High cortisol would cause the immune system to be suppressed. So if the students have increased cortisol, that explains the immune suppression. So D is also a supporting factor.

Wait, but the actual effect is on the immune cells. So if the immune cells are down, that's the effect. So both D and A support the hypothesis, but which is more likely as an answer.

Looking back at the options, the answer could be either. But in medical exams, the common stress response includes increased cortisol and changes in WBC count. So in this case, during exams, the students' cortisol is high, which causes their lymphocytes to drop.

So in the lab findings, both could be present. But the question is about which one is most likely to support the hypothesis.

I think the intended answer is D: increased AM cortisol. Because it's a direct indicator of stress, which is the cause. But then again, the effect on the immune system is the lower lymphocytes.

Wait, another point: the question is about which lab finding is most likely to support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the stress of exams (the cause) leads to immune suppression (the effect), causing more infections.

So the lab finding could be either the stress marker (cortisol) or the immune marker (lymphocytes). But which one is more directly linked to immune function.

If the exam is causing stress, which increases cortisol, which in turn suppresses the immune system. So the presence of high cortisol is a key part of the pathway. So finding D would support that the stress is indeed occurring and leading to the immune issues.

Alternatively, if the lymphocytes are low, that shows the immune system is suppressed, which would result in more infections. So both are correct, but the question is about which is the best support.

In exams, often the correct answer is the direct effect on the immune system. So perhaps A is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The question states that the incidence is increased during finals week. The hypothesis is that stress is causing it. So to support this, you'd want to show that the stress (high cortisol) is present, leading to immune issues.

So if the lab shows increased cortisol, that directly connects stress (from exams) to the immune problem. Alternatively, if the lab shows low lymphocytes, that's the effect.

But the question is which finding supports the hypothesis. The hypothesis is about the effect of stress on the immune system. So both are supportive, but the answer might be D because it's the cause.

Wait, but the actual effect on the immune system is the key here. Because the hypothesis is that stress affects the immune system. So the presence of immune suppression (like low lymphocytes) would directly support the hypothesis.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think about what each option represents.

Option D: Increased AM cortisol. This would indicate that the students are stressed, which is the proposed cause. So this supports that stress is happening, which leads to the effect.

Option A: Decreased lymphocyte count. This would indicate that the immune system is suppressed, which is the proposed effect.

So the question is which finding supports the hypothesis. Which part of the hypothesis do these options target?

The hypothesis is that stress (exams) → affects the immune system → more susceptible to infection.

So if the lab shows that the immune system is affected (A), that supports the link between stress and infection. Alternatively, if the lab shows that stress is present (D), that supports that the cause is indeed stress.

So which one is more directly supporting the hypothesis? The hypothesis is about the effect of stress on the immune system. So the lab finding showing the effect on the immune system (A) would support the hypothesis.

Wait, but could there be other reasons for low lymphocytes besides stress? Sure. But in the context of the question, it's implied that the stress is causing it.

So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another thought: cortisol's effect on lymphocytes. Does cortisol cause a decrease in lymphocytes? I think yes. Because lymphocytes are sensitive to cortisol. So if cortisol is high, lymphocytes would be lower.

So both D and A could be present. So which is the best answer.

The question is which is the most likely finding. So perhaps the question expects you to select the finding that shows the immune system is suppressed.

So in that case, A would be correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused now. Let me try to recall: when cortisol is elevated, it causes a decrease in certain immune cells. Lymphopenia is a known effect of increased cortisol.

So if D is correct (high cortisol), then A would also be correct. But the options are separate.

So which one is the best answer. The question is which finding supports the hypothesis.

The hypothesis is that stress (exams) causes immune suppression, leading to more infections. So a finding that shows immune suppression would be A: decreased lymphocytes. That would support the hypothesis because it's about the immune system being affected.

Alternatively, if the stress is causing high cortisol, which is then causing the immune suppression. So in that case, both D and A would be supporting, but the question is which is the best choice.

Wait, the question is asking for the lab finding in these students during exam week. So both could be present, but the options are separate.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, because it directly relates to the stress aspect, which is the cause.

Alternatively, if the question is about the immune system's status, then A is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about this again.

The question is about which lab finding supports the hypothesis that stress is affecting the immune system. So the finding should be related to the immune system's function.

So a decreased lymphocyte count (A) would indicate that the immune system is compromised, which supports the hypothesis.

But another angle: the presence of high cortisol (D) indicates that the body is under stress, which supports the stress part of the hypothesis.

So the correct answer depends on whether the question is testing the cause (stress) or the effect (immune suppression). The hypothesis links the two, but the lab finding should relate to the effect.

Wait, the hypothesis is that stress (the cause) affects the immune system (the effect), making the students more susceptible.

Which lab finding would directly support the effect? The immune system being suppressed.

So the correct answer would be A: decreased lymphocyte count.

But wait, another thing: cortisol has other effects. For example, it can cause neutrophilia (increased neutrophils) because it promotes the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow and inhibits their migration from the blood. So you might see increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes.

But looking at the options, option F is decreased neutrophil count, which would not fit. So in this case, the correct finding would be decreased lymphocytes (A) and increased neutrophils (but that's not an option for the correct answer here).

So given the options, A is a correct effect of high cortisol.

Wait, but the question provides option D as increased AM cortisol. So in that case, if D is correct, it would explain why the students have more infections.

So which is the better answer? The question is about supporting the hypothesis that stress affects the immune system. So if they have increased cortisol, that's the stress part. If they have decreased lymphocytes, that's the immune part.

I think the intended answer is D: increased AM cortisol, because it directly shows that stress is present, which is the proposed cause. So the presence of high cortisol supports the hypothesis that stress is affecting the immune system.

But I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that chronic stress leads to a suppressed immune system, which can be indicated by lower lymphocyte counts. But in the context of an exam question, the correct answer is likely D.

Wait, another approach: the immune system's function is suppressed when cortisol is high. So the presence of high cortisol (D) would indicate that the immune system is being affected, thus leading to more infections.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is D.
</think>

The question involves a hypothesis that stress from finals week negatively impacts the immune system of medical students, making them more susceptible to infections. The task is to identify which laboratory finding most strongly supports this hypothesis. 

Cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, is known to suppress the immune system. It can cause lymphopenia (decreased lymphocyte count) and other immune-related changes. The options provided include both stress markers (e.g., cortisol levels) and immune system indicators (e.g., lymphocyte count). 

Option D, "Increased AM serum cortisol concentration," directly reflects the stress caused by finals week, which is the proposed cause of immune suppression. Option A, "Decreased lymphocyte count," indicates immune suppression, which is the proposed effect. Both options are relevant, but the question asks for the finding that most strongly supports the hypothesis. Since the hypothesis links stress (the cause) to immune suppression (the effect), the presence of increased cortisol (D) directly supports the stress component of the hypothesis, making it the most appropriate answer.

ANSWER: D
