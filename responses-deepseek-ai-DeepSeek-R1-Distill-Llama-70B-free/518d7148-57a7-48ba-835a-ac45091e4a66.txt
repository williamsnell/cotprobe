Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about short-run costs and which one always increases as output increases. The options are A through I, so I need to think about each one carefully.

First, I remember that in economics, especially in production and cost, there are various cost concepts. Let me try to list them out and see which ones increase with output.

The question is asking which short-run cost "always" increases as output increases. So I'm looking for a cost curve that rises consistently as output goes up. I think that's important because some costs might decrease or have a U-shape.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Average variable cost (AVC). I think AVC is calculated by dividing total variable cost by output. AVC can decrease initially due to increasing marginal returns and then increase because of diminishing marginal returns. So it's not always increasing; it might first decrease and then increase. So A isn't the correct answer.

Option B: Marginal revenue (MR). Wait, MR is a revenue concept, not a cost. But just to be sure, MR is the additional revenue from selling one more unit. It usually decreases as output increases because of the law of demand—higher quantity leads to lower price. But this isn't a cost, so B is out.

Option C: Average total cost (ATC). ATC includes both fixed and variable costs. I recall that the ATC curve is U-shaped. It first decreases as output increases because fixed costs are spread over more units, but after a certain point, it starts increasing due to diminishing marginal returns. So C isn't always increasing.

Option D: Marginal cost (MC). MC is the cost of producing one more unit. In the short run, MC initially decreases but then increases. It's related to the law of diminishing marginal returns. So MC doesn't always increase with output. So D isn't correct.

Option E: Total variable cost (TVC). TVC increases as output increases because each additional unit produced adds to variable costs. Wait, is that always the case? Well, if producing more units means each unit's cost goes up, then TVC would definitely increase. But wait, in the short run, as more units are produced, variable costs (like labor, materials) increase. So yes, TVC should always increase as output increases. Hmm, that sounds promising.

Option F: Total overhead cost. Overhead costs are fixed costs, right? Like rent or salaries that don't change with output. So F is a fixed cost and doesn't change with output. So F is out.

Option G: Average revenue cost. I'm not sure about this term. Maybe it refers to average cost related to revenue, but I don't recall a standard term like that. It might be a trick option. I'll ignore G for now.

Option H: Total fixed cost (TFC). These are costs that don't change with output. So H remains constant regardless of output levels. So H is out.

Option I: Average fixed cost (AFC). AFC is TFC divided by output. As output increases, AFC decreases because you're spreading fixed costs over more units. So I decreases, not increases.

So going back, the options that could be correct are E and maybe another. Wait, let me recheck each.

Wait, total variable cost (E) is definitely increasing as output goes up because each additional unit adds to variable costs. So E is the one that always increases.

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure none of the other options could also fit. For example, average variable cost (A) doesn't always increase because it's average—it might decrease and then increase, but the total (E) keeps increasing. Similarly, total fixed cost doesn't change, so it's not E.

So the correct answer should be E: Total variable cost.

To determine which short-run cost always increases as output increases, we analyze each option:

- **A: Average variable cost (AVC)**: AVC decreases initially due to increasing marginal returns and then increases due to diminishing marginal returns. It does not always increase, so this is incorrect.  
- **B: Marginal revenue (MR)**: MR is a revenue concept, not a cost, and it typically decreases as output increases due to the law of demand. This is irrelevant to the question.  
- **C: Average total cost (ATC)**: ATC is U-shaped, decreasing initially as fixed costs are spread over more units, then increasing due to diminishing marginal returns. It does not always increase, so this is incorrect.  
- **D: Marginal cost (MC)**: MC initially decreases and then increases due to diminishing marginal returns. It does not always increase, so this is incorrect.  
- **E: Total variable cost (TVC)**: TVC increases as output increases because each additional unit produced adds to variable costs. This is consistent and always occurs, making it the correct answer.  
- **F: Total overhead cost**: Overhead costs are fixed and do not change with output, so this is incorrect.  
- **G: Average revenue cost**: This is not a standard term in economics and appears to be a trick option, so it is irrelevant.  
- **H: Total fixed cost (TFC)**: TFC remains constant regardless of output, so this is incorrect.  
- **I: Average fixed cost (AFC)**: AFC decreases as output increases because fixed costs are spread over more units. This is the opposite of what the question asks, so it is incorrect.  

The only cost that always increases as output increases is **Total variable cost (TVC)**.
