Question:

On January 1, year 1, a company purchased equipment for $100 million. The equipment consists of four major components, of which two components comprise 80% of the total cost and each has a 20-year useful life. The remaining two components have costs of $10 million each; one of them has a useful life of four years, and the other has a useful life of five years. The company applies the cost model to the equipment and uses the straight-line method of depreciation. Under IFRS, what is the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1?

Options:

A: $7,500,000
B: $5,000,000
C: $6,000,000
D: $8,000,000
E: $10,000,000
F: $9,500,000
G: $7,000,000
H: $4,000,000
I: $9,000,000
J: $8,500,000

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about depreciation under IFRS. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the situation is that a company bought some equipment on January 1, Year 1, for $100 million. The equipment has four major components. Two of them make up 80% of the total cost, so that's 80% of 100 million, which is $80 million. Each of these two has a useful life of 20 years. The other two components are each $10 million, so that's the remaining 20% of the cost, split as $10 million each. 

Wait, no, wait. The question says the remaining two have costs of $10 million each. So total for the remaining two is $20 million, which makes sense because 80% is $80 million, so 20% is $20 million, split into two parts of $10 million each.

Now, useful lives: one of the $10 million components has a 4-year life, and the other has 5 years. The company uses the straight-line method and the cost model for depreciation.

The question is asking for the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, Year 1. So, the first year's depreciation.

Under IFRS, I remember that when an asset has components with different useful lives, each component should be depreciated separately. This is called component depreciation. So you can't just take the total cost and divide by an average life or something; you have to break it down by components.

So let's list out each component and calculate their depreciation.

First component: $40 million (since 80% is $80 million, split into two, so each is $40 million). Each has a 20-year life. So the annual depreciation for each would be 40 million divided by 20 years, which is 2 million per year each. So together, these two would be 4 million per year.

Wait, no. Wait, 40 million each. 40 / 20 = 2 million per year per component. So two components at 2 million each is 4 million total for these two.

Then the next component is $10 million with a 4-year life. So 10 million divided by 4 is 2.5 million per year.

The last component is another $10 million, but with a 5-year life. So 10 /5 = 2 million per year.

So adding all these up: 4 million (from the two 20-year components) + 2.5 million + 2 million = 8.5 million total depreciation for the year.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, J is $8,500,000. So that's 8.5 million. So the answer should be J.

But let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the components.

So, two components at 40 million each, 20 years: 40/20=2 million each, so 4 million total.

Two components: 10 million each. One is 4 years: 2.5 million. The other is 5 years: 2 million. So 2.5 + 2 = 4.5. Added to the 4 million, that's 8.5 million. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer is J.

Under IFRS, when an asset consists of multiple components with different useful lives, each component must be depreciated separately. The equipment in this case has four components:

1. **Two components costing $40 million each (total $80 million)** with a 20-year useful life:
   - Depreciation per component: $40 million / 20 years = $2 million per year.
   - Total depreciation for these two components: $2 million Ã— 2 = $4 million per year.

2. **One component costing $10 million** with a 4-year useful life:
   - Depreciation: $10 million / 4 years = $2.5 million per year.

3. **One component costing $10 million** with a 5-year useful life:
   - Depreciation: $10 million / 5 years = $2 million per year.

Adding these amounts together:
- Total depreciation expense for the year: $4 million + $2.5 million + $2 million = $8.5 million.

Thus, the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, Year 1, is **$8,500,000**.

The correct answer is **J**.
