Question:

 Why, according to Gill, does Leon Kass think the notion of being "better off dead" is incoherent?

Options:

A: because Kass thinks that death is not a state of being and therefore cannot be evaluated.
B: because Kass believes in the sanctity of life and opposes euthanasia.
C: because Kass maintains that the concept of death is inherently negative and cannot be considered as "better".
D: because there has yet to be a satisfactory philosophical explanation of why death is bad.
E: because dead people no longer exist, and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die.
F: because Kass believes suffering in life can lead to personal growth, making death not a better option.
G: because some things (e.g., long-term torture) are worse than death.
H: because Kass believes that one cannot compare being alive and being dead.
I: because death is, by definition, undesirable.
J: because death cannot be considered as a better option when life is valuable.

Okay, so I've got this question about Leon Kass and his views on the phrase "better off dead." I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question is asking why Gill says Kass thinks the notion is incoherent. So I need to remember what each of these philosophers argued about, especially regarding death and euthanasia.

Leon Kass is known for his work in bioethics and his opposition to euthanasia. From what I remember, he's written about the sanctity of life and the importance of human dignity. But the question is about the coherence of the idea that someone is "better off dead." So, why would Kass find that notion incoherent?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Because Kass thinks death isn't a state of being and can't be evaluated. That sounds a bit abstract. If death isn't a state, then comparing life and death becomes tricky because one state (life) exists and the other (death) doesn't. I think this might be related to the idea that you can't compare being alive to not being alive because the latter isn't a state with experiences.

Option B: Kass believes in the sanctity of life and opposes euthanasia. This is true, but does it directly explain why the notion is incoherent? Sanctity of life would make him oppose it, but the question is about the coherence, not just his stance.

Option C: Maintains death is inherently negative. That might be part of it, but again, not sure if it's the reason for incoherence.

Option D: No satisfactory explanation of why death is bad. That's more of a philosophical problem but not directly Kass's argument.

Option E: Dead people can't benefit because they don't exist. This seems similar to option A. If you're dead, you can't have experiences, so the idea of being "better off" doesn't apply because there's no subject to benefit.

Option F: Suffering leads to growth. That could be another angle, but I don't recall Kass focusing on personal growth as the main reason.

Option G: Some things are worse than death. This is more about when death might be preferable, but Kass would likely oppose that view.

Option H: Can't compare alive and dead. This rings a bell. If you can't compare the two states because one is existence and the other nonexistence, then the idea of being "better off" doesn't hold because there's nothing to compare to.

Option I: Death is by definition bad. That's a possible stance, but again, not sure if it's about coherence.

Option J: Death can't be better if life is valuable. This is more about the value judgment rather than the logical coherence.

So, thinking back, Kass's argument hinges on the idea that you can't compare being alive to being dead because once you're dead, you don't exist to experience anything. Therefore, the concept of being "better off dead" is incoherent because there's no subject to benefit after death. It's like saying someone is better off not existing, but since they don't exist, the comparison doesn't make sense.

Wait, but another angle is that comparing life and death is impossible because they're not on the same scale. So when someone says they're better off dead, they're assuming a comparison between two states where one (death) isn't a state of being. So maybe it's more about the inability to evaluate or compare.

So looking at the options, E says dead people can't benefit, which is about the subject. H says you can't compare alive and dead, which is about the comparison itself.

I think Kass's argument is that death isn't a state where one can be better or worse off. So it's incoherent to say someone is better off dead because they don't exist in death to have that state. So that would align with option E, but wait, option H is about the comparison.

Alternatively, maybe it's that you can't compare being alive to being dead because they're not comparable states. So H would be the reason.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall specific arguments. I think Kass argues that since death is the absence of existence, there's no way to evaluate whether someone is better off dead because they don't exist to experience being better or worse off. So the concept is incoherent because the subject no longer exists to have any state. That would point to option E.

But another thought: If you can't compare the two states because one is non-being, then it's the comparison that's impossible. So H would be the reason.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up different philosophers. I remember Epicurus arguing that death isn't bad because when you're dead, you don't exist to experience it. But Kass's argument is more about the sanctity of life and the impossibility of comparing the states.

Alternatively, I think Kass's point is that since the dead don't exist, the idea of their being "better off" is impossible because there's no subject to benefit. So it's incoherent because you can't assign a benefit to a non-existent entity. That would make E the correct answer.

But wait, another angle: The concept of being "better off dead" implies a comparison between life and death. If life is bad, death is better. But Kass might argue that you can't make that comparison because death isn't a state that can be evaluated. So H would be the reason.

I'm a bit torn between E and H. But I think the key point is that in death, you don't exist, so you can't have a better or worse state. Therefore, the notion is incoherent because it's impossible to evaluate.

So the correct answer would be E: because dead people no longer exist and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die.

Wait, but looking back, the options: Option E says "because dead people no longer exist, and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die." That makes sense because if they're dead, there's no one to benefit. So the idea of being better off dead is incoherent because the subject doesn't exist in death to have that state.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's about the impossibility of comparison, which would be H. But I think E is more precise because it's about the nonexistence making the concept incoherent.

Hmm, but now I'm second-guessing. Another approach: the phrase "better off dead" implies that death is a state that is better than their current life. But if death isn't a state of being, then you can't say it's better because there's nothing to compare.

Wait, I think the correct reasoning is that you can't compare being alive to being dead because they're not comparable states. So the notion is incoherent because you can't make that comparison. That would be option H.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to remember any specific quotes or points. Oh, right, Kass argues that life is inherently valuable, and the idea of being better off dead undermines that because it's based on a false comparison. So the incoherence comes from the inability to compare life and death as states of being. Therefore, option H is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the key point is that you can't evaluate death as a better state because the person doesn't exist in death to have experiences. So it's incoherent because the subject is gone. So that would be E.

Alternatively, the incoherence is because you can't compare life and death. So H.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on my understanding, Kass's argument is that death isn't a state where one can be better or worse off. So the notion is incoherent because it's impossible to evaluate. That would make option A correct: because death isn't a state of being and can't be evaluated.

Wait, option A says "because Kass thinks that death is not a state of being and therefore cannot be evaluated." That sounds right. So if death isn't a state, you can't evaluate whether someone is better off dead.

But earlier I thought it was E, but now I'm considering A and H. I'm getting a bit confused. I think the correct answer is E, but I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E because if you're dead, you can't have experiences, so the concept of being better off doesn't apply. So the phrase is incoherent because it implies that the dead person is experiencing being better off, which they can't because they don't exist.

Yes, I think that's right. So the answer is E.

The question asks why Leon Kass thinks the notion of being "better off dead" is incoherent, according to Gill. To answer this, it's important to focus on Kass's arguments about death and its relationship to the concept of being "better off."

Kass is known for his opposition to euthanasia and his belief in the sanctity of life, but the question specifically concerns the coherence of the phrase "better off dead." The key to understanding Kass's position lies in his argument that death is not a state of being. Since death represents the absence of existence, it cannot be evaluated as a state where someone could be "better off." This makes the notion incoherent because it implies a comparison between life and death, where death is not a state that can be assessed.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests that death is not a state of being and cannot be evaluated. This aligns with Kass's argument that death lacks the qualities necessary for evaluation, making the comparison incoherent.
- **Option E** states that dead people no longer exist and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die. This also aligns with Kass's reasoning, as it highlights the impossibility of benefiting from a state of nonexistence.

Between these, **Option E** is more precise because it directly addresses the incoherence of the phrase "better off dead" by emphasizing that the dead cannot experience or benefit from death. This makes the notion inherently incoherent, as it assumes a subject (the deceased) who no longer exists to experience being "better off."

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: because dead people no longer exist, and thus cannot benefit from choosing to die.

Answer: E
