Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the Millers insuring their house. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Mr. and Mrs. Miller bought their house and land for $32,700. They think the land is worth $5,500. They want to insure the house at 80% of its value. The question is, how much insurance should they purchase?

Alright, so first, the total cost is $32,700, which includes both the house and the land. The land is estimated at $5,500. So, I guess the first step is to find out how much the house alone is worth. 

So, if the total is $32,700 and the land is $5,500, subtracting the land value from the total should give the house's value. Let me do that calculation.

$32,700 minus $5,500. Hmm, 32,700 minus 5,000 is 27,700, and then minus another 500 is 27,200. So the house is worth $27,200.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should write it out more clearly. 32,700 minus 5,500. Let's see:

32,700
- 5,500
= ?

32,700 - 5,000 is 27,700. Then subtract 500 more: 27,700 - 500 = 27,200. Yep, that's right. So the house is $27,200.

Now, they want to insure the house at 80% of its value. So I need to calculate 80% of $27,200.

Calculating percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle it. 80% is the same as 0.8 in decimal form. So, 27,200 multiplied by 0.8.

Let me compute that. 27,200 times 0.8. Let's break it down:

27,200 * 0.8 = ?

Well, 27,200 * 0.8 is the same as 27,200 * (8/10) = (27,200 / 10) * 8.

27,200 divided by 10 is 2,720. Then multiply by 8: 2,720 * 8.

Let me calculate 2,720 * 8. 2,000 *8 is 16,000, and 720*8 is 5,760. So adding those together: 16,000 + 5,760 = 21,760. 

So 80% of $27,200 is $21,760. Therefore, the Millers should purchase $21,760 worth of insurance.

Now, looking back at the options provided:

A: $24,560
B: $21,760
C: $26,160
D: $5,500
E: $32,700
F: $27,200
G: $29,360
H: $22,000
I: $17,280
J: $19,440

The correct answer is B: $21,760.

The Millers paid $32,700 for their house and land, with the land valued at $5,500. Subtracting the land value from the total gives the house's value: $32,700 - $5,500 = $27,200. They want to insure the house at 80% of its value. Calculating 80% of $27,200: 

$$27,200 \times 0.8 = $21,760.$$

Thus, the insurance they should purchase is $21,760.

B: $21,760

Answer: B
