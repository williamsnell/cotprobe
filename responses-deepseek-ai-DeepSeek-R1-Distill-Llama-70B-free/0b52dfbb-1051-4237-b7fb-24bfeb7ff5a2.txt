Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking, "What percent of .65% is .42%?" And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when you're asked what percent one number is of another, you usually divide the first number by the second and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So, in this case, I think I need to divide .42% by .65% and then multiply by 100.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I have the right approach. The question is phrased as "What percent of A is B?" So, the formula should be (B / A) * 100%. Yeah, that sounds right. So here, A is .65% and B is .42%.

But wait, both are percentages. So maybe I should convert those percentages to their decimal forms to make the calculation easier. So, .65% becomes 0.65 divided by 100, which is 0.0065. Similarly, .42% is 0.42/100 = 0.0042.

So now, I need to calculate (0.0042 / 0.0065) * 100%. Let me do that step by step. 

First, divide 0.0042 by 0.0065. Hmm, let's see. 0.0042 รท 0.0065. Maybe I can simplify this by multiplying numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate the decimals. That would give me 42 รท 65. 

42 divided by 65. Let me compute that. 65 goes into 42 zero times, so I add a decimal point and a zero, making it 420. 65 times 6 is 390, which is less than 420. 65*6=390, so 420-390=30. Bring down another zero: 300. 65 goes into 300 four times (65*4=260). Subtract, 300-260=40. Bring down another zero: 400. 65*6=390 again. So that's 6 again. 400-390=10. Bring down another zero: 100. 65 goes into 100 once (65), leaving 35. Bring down another zero: 350. 65*5=325. So 5. 350-325=25. Bring down another zero: 250. 65*3=195. 250-195=55. Bring down another zero: 550. 65*8=520. 550-520=30. Wait, I've seen 30 before. So this is repeating.

Putting it all together, 42/65 is 0.64615... So approximately 0.64615. 

Now, multiply that by 100% to get the percentage. 0.64615 * 100 = 64.615%. So approximately 64.615%.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 64.6%, which matches. But wait, let me double-check the options:

Options are:

A:500%
B:700%
C:646%
D:65%
E:60%
F:800%
G:845%
H:75%
I:64.6%
J:550%

So option I is 64.6%, which is what I got. 

But wait, another way to think about this: the question is about percentages. So alternatively, maybe I can treat them as numbers without converting to decimals. So, (0.42 / 0.65) * 100. Let me compute 0.42 divided by 0.65. 

0.42 รท 0.65. Let's see, 0.65 times 0.6 is 0.39. 0.42 minus 0.39 is 0.03. So that's 0.6 with a remainder of 0.03. Bring down a zero: 0.030. 0.65 goes into 0.030 about 0.046 times (since 0.65 * 0.04 = 0.026, and 0.65 * 0.046 = approx 0.0299). So approximately 0.646. So again, 64.6%, which is option I.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be I.

To determine what percent of 0.65% is 0.42%, we use the formula for percentage calculations:  

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100\%
\]

Here, the "Part" is 0.42%, and the "Whole" is 0.65%. Converting these percentages to decimals, we have:  

\[
0.42\% = 0.0042 \quad \text{and} \quad 0.65\% = 0.0065
\]

Now, divide the two decimals:  

\[
\frac{0.0042}{0.0065} = \frac{42}{65} \approx 0.64615
\]

Multiply by 100% to convert to a percentage:  

\[
0.64615 \times 100\% \approx 64.615\%
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, we get approximately **64.6%**, which corresponds to option **I**.  

Answer: I
