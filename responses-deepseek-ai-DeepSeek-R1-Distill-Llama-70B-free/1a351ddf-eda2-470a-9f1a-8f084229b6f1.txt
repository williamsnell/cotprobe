Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a pipe resonating at different temperatures. Hmm, I remember that resonance in pipes has something to do with the speed of sound. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says that at 20°C, the pipe is open at both ends and resonates at 440 Hz. Then on a colder day, the speed of sound is 3% lower, and I need to find the new frequency.

Wait, I think the resonance frequency for a pipe open at both ends depends on the speed of sound. Oh right, the formula for the fundamental frequency is f = v/(2L), where v is the speed of sound and L is the length of the pipe. Oh, because the wavelength is 2L for the first harmonic when both ends are open.

So, if the speed of sound changes, the frequency should change proportionally, since L is the same (the pipe's length doesn't change with temperature, I assume). 

At 20°C, the speed of sound is v. On the cold day, it's v' = v - 0.03v = 0.97v. 

So the original frequency f1 = 440 Hz = v/(2L). The new frequency f2 would be v'/(2L) = (0.97v)/(2L) = 0.97 * (v/(2L)) = 0.97 * f1.

Calculating that, 0.97 * 440 Hz equals... let me compute that. 440 times 0.97. 440 * 0.97 is 440*(1-0.03) = 440 - (440 * 0.03). 440 * 0.03 is 13.2, so 440 -13.2 is 426.8 Hz. 

Looking at the options, the closest one would be 427 Hz, which is option A. Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, 426.8 is approximately 427, yes. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but why am I assuming that the length of the pipe doesn't change? Well, I think in these problems, unless stated otherwise, the pipe's length is considered constant. The change in temperature might cause thermal expansion, but the problem doesn't mention that, so I think it's safe to ignore it. So the speed is the only variable here.

So yeah, the frequency would decrease by 3%, leading to 440 * 0.97 = 426.8, so approximately 427 Hz. So the correct option is A.

The problem involves a pipe open at both ends that resonates at 440 Hz at 20°C. The resonance frequency of such a pipe is given by \( f = \frac{v}{2L} \), where \( v \) is the speed of sound and \( L \) is the pipe's length. Since the pipe's length is constant, the frequency is directly proportional to the speed of sound.

On a colder day, the speed of sound decreases by 3%, so the new speed of sound is \( v' = 0.97v \). The new frequency \( f_2 \) is therefore:

\[
f_2 = 0.97 \cdot f_1 = 0.97 \cdot 440 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

Calculating this:

\[
0.97 \cdot 440 = 440 - (440 \cdot 0.03) = 440 - 13.2 = 426.8 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

The closest option to 426.8 Hz is 427 Hz, which corresponds to option A. Assuming the pipe's length remains constant (as no thermal expansion is mentioned), the frequency decreases by 3% due to the reduced speed of sound.

Answer: A
