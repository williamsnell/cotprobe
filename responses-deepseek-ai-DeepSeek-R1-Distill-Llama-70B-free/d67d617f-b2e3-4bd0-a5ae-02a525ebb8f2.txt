Okay, I've got this problem about a motor and power factor correction. Hmm, let's see. So, the question is about a single-phase induction motor, right? The motor is 220 volts, 60 hertz, 10 horsepower. It operates at an efficiency of 86% and a power factor of 90%. The goal is to find the capacitance needed to parallel with the motor so that the feeder operates at unity power factor.

Wait, I remember that power factor correction usually involves adding a capacitor. The capacitor provides reactive power to compensate for the inductive reactance of the motor, thereby improving the power factor.

So, first, I think I need to find the power of the motor. Horsepower to watts, right? Because 1 hp is about 746 watts. So, 10 hp would be 10 * 746 = 7460 watts.

But wait, the efficiency comes into play here. Efficiency is the output power divided by input power. So, the input power would be higher than the output. Oh wait, the motor's output is 10 hp, but the input is higher because of less than 100% efficiency.

Wait, let me think. Efficiency (η) is output power / input power. So, input power (P_input) = output power / η.

So, output power is 10 hp * 746 = 7460 watts. But since the efficiency is 86%, input power is P_input = 7460 / 0.86. Let me calculate that.

7460 / 0.86 → let's see, 7460 divided by 0.86. 0.86 is approximately 0.86. So 7460 / 0.86 equals around 8674 watts. Let's double-check that calculation. 0.86 times 8674 is 7460? 0.86 *8674: 0.8*8674=6938.4, 0.06*8674=520.44 → total 7458.84, which is close enough. So input power is about 8674 watts.

Next, the power factor of the motor is 90%, which is 0.9. And power factor is the cosine of the angle between voltage and current. So, the motor is operating at a lagging power factor, which is typical for inductive loads.

The idea is to add a capacitor in parallel so that the overall power factor becomes 1 (unity). So, the capacitor will supply the reactive power that the motor is lacking.

I think the formula to find the required reactive power (Q) is based on the current and voltage. Alternatively, I can use the power triangle approach.

In a power system, the apparent power (S) is the vector sum of real power (P) and reactive power (Q). The power factor (pf) is P/S.

So, for the motor, P is the input power, which is 8674 W. The power factor is 0.9, so S (apparent power) = P / pf = 8674 / 0.9 = approximately 9631.11 VA.

Then, the reactive power Q can be found using Q = S * sin(theta), where theta is the angle whose cosine is the power factor. Alternatively, since tan(theta) = Q/P, and since power factor is 0.9, theta is arccos(0.9). Let me compute that.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the relation Q = sqrt(S² - P²). Oh wait, no, S is sqrt(P² + Q²). So, solving for Q, we get Q = sqrt(S² - P²).

But wait, no: since S² = P² + Q², so Q = sqrt(S² - P²) = sqrt( (P/pf)^2 - P^2 ). Let me plug in the numbers.

P is 8674 W, pf is 0.9. So S = 8674 / 0.9 = 9631.11 VA.

Then, Q = sqrt(9631.11² - 8674²).

Let me compute this. Maybe it's easier to factor out P^2.

Q = P * sqrt( (1/pf²) - 1 ) 

So, substituting the numbers:

Q = 8674 * sqrt( (1/(0.9)^2) - 1 )

0.9 squared is 0.81. 1/0.81 is approximately 1.2345679.

So 1.2345679 - 1 = 0.2345679.

Square root of 0.2345679 is approximately 0.484.

So Q ≈ 8674 * 0.484 ≈ let's compute that.

8674 * 0.4 is 3469.6, and 8674 * 0.084 is approximately 8674 * 0.08=693.92, plus 8674 *0.004=34.7, so total 728.62. So 3469.6 + 728.62 = 4198.22. So Q ≈ 4198 VARs.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have gotten that wrong. Because the power factor is the cosine of theta, so the reactive power is Q = P * tan(theta). Alternatively, since cos(theta) = 0.9, sin(theta) would be sqrt(1 - 0.81) = sqrt(0.19) ≈ 0.43589. So tan(theta) = sin/cos = 0.43589 / 0.9 ≈ 0.484, which matches what I had before. So yes, Q = P * tan(theta) = 8674 * 0.484 ≈ 4198 VARs.

So the motor is consuming 8674 W of real power and 4198 VAR of reactive power. To achieve unity power factor, the total reactive power should be zero. So the capacitor needs to supply 4198 VAR.

Wait, no. Because the capacitor will supply reactive power, which is positive (since capacitors have negative reactance, but in VAR terms, they lead), so the total reactive power would be the motor's Q (which is inductive, so positive) minus the capacitor's Q (capacitive, negative, so subtracting). Wait, actually, the motor's Q is positive (lagging), the capacitor's Q is negative (leading). So the total Q is 4198 - Q_c. We want the total Q to be zero, so Q_c = 4198 VAR.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total power. The feeder needs to supply real power P, and the reactive power should cancel out. So the capacitor's reactive power (Qc) must equal the motor's reactive power (Qm). So Qc = Qm = 4198 VAR.

Wait, but wait, the power factor after adding the capacitor should be 1, meaning that the line current's power factor is 1. So the total reactive power must be zero.

So the capacitor's reactive power (Qc) should be equal and opposite to the motor's reactive power (Qm). So yes, Qc = Qm.

So now, I need to find the capacitance that gives Qc = 4198 VAR at 220 V and 60 Hz.

The formula for reactive power of a capacitor is Qc = V² * ω * C, where ω is the angular frequency (2πf) and C is capacitance in farads.

Wait, another formula I remember is Qc = V² * (2πf) * C.

So rearranging for C: C = Qc / (V² * 2πf).

Plugging in the numbers:

V is 220 volts, f is 60 Hz, Qc is 4198 VAR.

So C = 4198 / (220² * 2 * π * 60 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 220 squared is 220 * 220 = 48,400.

Then, 2 * π * 60 = 120π ≈ 376.99.

So denominator is 48400 * 376.99 → let me compute that.

But wait, no: 48400 * (376.99) → but that's a big number. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 48,400 * 376.99 first.

Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Let me compute 48,400 * 376.99.

Wait, 48,400 * 300 = 14,520,000.

48,400 * 76.99 = let's compute 48,400 * 70 = 3,388,000.

48,400 * 6.99 = 48,400 *7= 338,800 minus 48,400 *0.01=484 → 338,800 - 484=338,316.

So 3,388,000 + 338,316 = 3,726,316.

Then total denominator is 14,520,000 + 3,726,316 = 18,246,316.

So denominator is approximately 18,246,316.

So C = 4198 / 18,246,316 → let's compute that.

4198 divided by 18,246,316 → let me see, 4198/18,246,316 ≈ 2.3e-4.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because that seems a bit low. Alternatively, maybe I should check the formula again.

Wait, another formula for reactive power is Q = V * I_r, where I_r is the reactive current. For a capacitor, I_r = V * ω * C. So Q = V * (V * ω * C) = V² ω C. So yes, that's correct.

So C = Qc / (V^2 * ω).

So let's recalculate with precise numbers.

Compute denominator:

V^2 = 220^2 = 48,400.

ω = 2π * 60 = 120π ≈ 376.991118.

So denominator is 48,400 * 376.991118 ≈ let's compute that.

48,400 * 376.991118 → 48,400 * 377 ≈ 48,400 * 377.

Compute 48,400 * 300 = 14,520,000.

48,400 * 77 = let's see, 48,400 *70=3,388,000, 48,400 *7=338,800 → 3,388,000 +338,800=3,726,800.

So 14,520,000 +3,726,800 =18,246,800.

So denominator ≈ 18,246,800.

So C = 4198 / 18,246,800 → let's compute this.

4198 ÷ 18,246,800 ≈ 0.00023 farads.

Wait, 0.00023 F is 230 microfarads. Because 1 microfarad is 1e-6 F, so 230e-6 F.

So the required capacitance is approximately 230 microfarads.

Looking at the options, option J is 229 microfarads, which is close. Option C is 250, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Let me check the calculations more accurately.

Wait, let's recalculate Q more precisely. Because earlier, I approximated Q as 4198, but perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

So, S = P / pf = 8674 / 0.9 = 9631.1111 VA.

Then, Q = sqrt(S² - P²) = sqrt(9631.11² - 8674^2).

Compute 9631.11²:

9631^2 = let's compute 9600^2=92,160,000. Then, 31^2=961. And cross terms 2*9600*31= 595,200. So 92,160,000 +595,200 +961 = 92,756,161.

Similarly, 8674^2: 8000^2=64,000,000. 674^2= approx 674*674. Let's compute 600^2=360,000. 74^2=5476. 2*600*74=88,800. So 360,000 +88,800 +5476= 455,276. So 8000^2 +2*8000*674 +674^2 → 64,000,000 + 10,752,000 (because 2*8000*674= 2*5,392,000=10,784,000? Wait, wait, 8000 *674 = 5,392,000. So 2*8000*674=10,784,000. Then 674^2= 455,276. So total 64e6 +10.784e6 =74.784e6 +0.455e6=75.239e6. So 8674^2=75,239,276.

Wait, no, maybe I should compute 8674 *8674.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (a-b)(a+b) = a² - b², where a=9631.11, b=8674.

So a² - b² = (9631.11 -8674)(9631.11 +8674) = (957.11)(18305.11).

Compute 957.11 * 18305.11.

Hmm, that's a bit tedious. Let's approximate 957 * 18305 = ?

Approximately 957 *18,305 = let's compute 1000 *18,305 =18,305,000. Subtract 43 *18,305.

43 *18,305: 40 *18,305=732,200, 3 *18,305=54,915 → total 787,115.

So 18,305,000 - 787,115 = 17,517,885.

So a² - b² ≈17,517,885. So Q = sqrt(17,517,885) ≈4,186 VARs.

Wait, earlier I approximated 4198, but precise calculation would be about 4186. Hmm, that's a small difference.

So Qc needed is about 4186 VAR.

Now, compute C = Qc / (V² * 2πf).

V is 220, so V²=48,400.

2πf = 2 * π *60 ≈376.991.

So denominator is 48,400 * 376.991 ≈ let's compute 48,400 * 377.

As before, 48,400 *377 = 18,246,800.

So C = 4186 / 18,246,800 ≈ 0.0002294 F → 229.4 microfarads.

So approximately 229 microfarads.

Looking at the options, option J is 229 microfarads. Option D is 209, which is lower. So the correct answer would be J.

But wait, why is option G 219? Maybe I made a miscalculation in the Q value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute S² - P² more accurately.

Wait, S is 9631.1111, so S² is 9631.1111^2.

Let me compute that precisely.

9631.1111 is equal to 9631 and 1/9. Because 0.1111 is 1/9 approximately.

So 9631.1111^2 = (9631 + 1/9)^2 = 9631^2 + 2*9631*(1/9) + (1/9)^2.

Compute each term:

9631^2: Let's compute 9600^2 =92,160,000. 31^2=961. 2*9600*31= 595,200. So 92,160,000 +595,200=92,755,200 +961=92,756,161.

Then, 2 *9631 * (1/9) = (2 *9631)/9. 9631 *2=19,262 → 19,262 /9 ≈2136.888...

And (1/9)^2 =1/81≈0.0123.

So S² =92,756,161 + 2136.888 + 0.0123≈92,758,297.90.

P is 8674, so P²=8674^2= let's compute that accurately.

8674 *8674. Let's compute (8000 +674)^2 =8000^2 +2*8000*674 +674^2.

8000^2=64,000,000.

2*8000*674=2*5,392,000=10,784,000.

674^2 = (600+74)^2=600² + 2*600*74 +74²=360,000 + 88,800 +5,476=360,000+88,800=448,800+5,476=454,276.

So total P²=64,000,000 +10,784,000=74,784,000+454,276=75,238,276.

So S² - P² =92,758,297.9 -75,238,276 =17,520,021.9.

So Q = sqrt(17,520,021.9) ≈4,187 VARs.

So more accurately, Q is about 4187 VAR.

Now, compute C=4187/(220^2 * 2π*60).

220²=48,400.

2π*60=120π≈376.991.

So denominator=48,400 * 376.991 ≈ let's compute 484 * 376.991 *100.

Wait, 48,400 *376.991 = 48,400 * (300 +70 +6.991) = 48,400*300=14,520,000; 48,400*70=3,388,000; 48,400*6.991≈48,400*7=338,800 minus 48,400*0.009≈435.6 → 338,800-435.6=338,364.4.

So sum all together: 14,520,000 +3,388,000=17,908,000 +338,364.4=18,246,364.4.

So denominator≈18,246,364.4.

So C=4187 / 18,246,364.4 → let's compute this.

4187 ÷18,246,364.4 ≈ 0.0002295 F → 229.5 microfarads.

So the closest option is J: 229 microfarads.

But wait, let me check the initial steps for any possible mistakes. Did I compute the input power correctly?

Yes, the output power is 10 hp =7460 W. Efficiency is
