Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the charges required to produce a specific electric displacement field, D. The field is given as D = [r + (1/r²)] U(r₀ - r) 1_r. Hmm, I remember that the electric displacement field D is related to the electric field E and polarization P, but for this problem, maybe we can treat D as the field we're analyzing.

Wait, right. In free space, D is equal to epsilon_0 E plus P, but if there's no polarization, D is just epsilon_0 E. But I'm not sure if that's the approach here. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the charges using the divergence of D, which relates to the free charge density.

Oh right! The divergence of D equals the free charge density, rho_free. So to find the charges, I should compute the divergence of D and see what that gives. Also, since D is given in spherical coordinates, I should remember how to compute the divergence in spherical coordinates.

So D is a vector field, and it's given in the radial direction. Its magnitude is [r + (1/r²)] multiplied by the unit step function U(r₀ - r). Wait, the Heaviside step function U(r₀ - r) is 1 when r < r₀, and 0 otherwise. So this D field is non-zero only inside the sphere of radius r₀. Outside, D is zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the step function U(r₀ - r) is 1 when r₀ - r ≥ 0, so when r ≤ r₀. So inside the sphere of radius r₀, D is [r + (1/r²)] in the radial direction, and zero outside. So the D field exists only inside the sphere.

Now, to find the free charge density rho_free, I need to compute the divergence of D. Since D is purely radial and depends only on r, the divergence simplifies in spherical coordinates.

The divergence of a radial vector field D(r) in spherical coordinates is (1/r²) d/dr (r² D(r)). Oh wait, no, I think I might be mixing it up. Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, for a purely radial vector field D(r) ȓ, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² D(r)). Right, because the other terms (the angular parts) vanish since D doesn't depend on theta or phi.

So let's compute that. Inside the sphere, D(r) = r + 1/r². So first, compute r² D(r) = r² (r + 1/r²) = r³ + 1.

Then take the derivative d/dr (r² D(r)) = d/dr (r³ + 1) = 3r².

Then, the divergence is (1/r²) * 3r² = 3. So inside the sphere, rho_free = 3 C/m³.

Wait, but wait, what are the units here? Oh, the options mention charge densities in C/m³, so this makes sense. So inside the sphere, rho_free is 3 C/m³.

Now, what happens at r = r₀? Because D has a step function, there's a discontinuity. I remember that the discontinuity in D across a surface is equal to the surface charge density sigma_free. So the discontinuity in the normal component of D gives sigma_free.

Wait, D inside is [r + 1/r²], and outside D is zero. So at r = r₀, the D inside is r₀ + 1/(r₀²), and outside it's zero. So the discontinuity is D_inside - D_outside = (r₀ + 1/r₀²) - 0 = r₀ + 1/r₀².

Wait, but the formula is that the surface charge sigma_free is equal to the discontinuity in D across the surface, specifically sigma_free = D_inside - D_outside. So here, sigma_free = (r₀ + 1/r₀²) - 0 = r₀ + 1/r₀². But wait, looking at the options, some have negative signs. So perhaps I need to think about the direction. Wait, the D field is in the radial direction. So if the surface is at r=r₀, then the direction of D is outward. So the discontinuity is D_inside (just inside the surface) minus D_outside (just outside), which is [r₀ + 1/r₀²] - 0. So sigma_free is positive, r₀ + 1/r₀².

Wait, but looking at the options, some have negative signs for the surface charge. Hmm. Let me make sure I got this right. Another way to think: in electrostatics, when you have a surface charge, the electric displacement D jumps by sigma_free as you cross the surface. The direction of D is radially outward, so if D is continuous from inside to outside, but in this case, D inside is non-zero, and outside is zero. So the jump is D_inside - D_outside. Since D_outside is zero, sigma_free is D_inside at r=r₀, which is positive.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider the sign more carefully. Because when moving from inside to outside, the normal direction is outward. The D just inside is D_in = [r₀ + 1/(r₀²)] 1_r. Just outside, D_out is zero. So the jump is D_out - D_in = - [r₀ + 1/(r₀²)].

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check. The correct formula is sigma_free = D_out - D_in, right? Because the surface charge is equal to the discontinuity in D across the surface, with D_out being the field just outside the surface, and D_in just inside. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the correct formula is sigma_free = D_in - D_out. Because when you have a surface charge, the D field jumps outward. So the change in D as you cross the surface is sigma_free. So if you go from inside to outside, D goes from D_in to D_out, so D_out = D_in + sigma_free * n_hat, where n_hat is the outward normal. So sigma_free = D_out - D_in. Wait, no.

Wait, the correct formula is that the discontinuity in D is equal to sigma_free. So the difference D_out - D_in is equal to sigma_free. Because the electric displacement D has a jump of sigma_free across the surface, with D_out being the field just outside, D_in just inside. So if D_out is larger than D_in, sigma_free is positive. In our case, D_out is zero, and D_in is [r₀ + 1/r₀²], so D_out - D_in = - [r₀ + 1/r₀²]. Therefore, sigma_free is negative. Oh, so sigma_free = - [r₀ + 1/r₀²].

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if D is discontinuous, and D_out is zero, then the jump is negative. So the surface charge would be negative. Because D_out < D_in. So sigma_free = D_out - D_in = - [r₀ + 1/r₀²].

Wait, but wait, another approach. Let me think about Gauss's law. The surface charge contributes to the discontinuity in D. So the field just outside the surface is D_out = D_in + sigma_free. But in our case, D_out is zero. So 0 = D_in + sigma_free. So sigma_free = - D_in. D_in at r=r₀ is [r₀ + 1/r₀²], so sigma_free = - [r₀ + 1/r₀²].

Ah, that makes sense. So sigma_free is negative. So the surface charge is - [r₀ + 1/r₀²].

So putting it all together: the free charge consists of a volume charge density rho_free = 3 C/m³ inside the sphere (r < r₀), and a surface charge density sigma_free = - [r₀ + 1/r₀²] on the sphere r = r₀.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options describe a uniform charge density, a surface charge, and possibly a point charge at the origin.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh, right! Because the divergence of D gives the free charge density, but if there's a delta function at the origin, we need to account for that as a point charge.

Wait, when computing the divergence of D, I assumed D was [r + 1/r²] inside. But wait, in spherical coordinates, when r approaches zero, the 1/r² term becomes problematic. Let me think about whether the D field includes a point charge at the origin.

Because, the expression D = [r + 1/r²] U(r₀ - r) 1_r. So for r approaching zero, D approaches 1/r², which is similar to the field of a point charge. Let's recall that for a point charge Q, the D field is Q/(4π r²) 1_r. So in this case, the D field inside has a term 1/r², which suggests that there's a point charge at the origin contributing to D.

So, when I compute the divergence of D, I have rho_free = 3 C/m³, but I also have to consider any delta function contributions at r=0, because the divergence might involve delta functions due to the 1/r² term.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the divergence as 3 C/m³, which is a constant, so that suggests that the 1/r² term doesn't contribute to the divergence except at r=0. Because when I took the derivative of (r^3 +1), that's 3r², so when divided by r², gives 3. So that suggests that the 1/r² term doesn't contribute to the volume charge except at the origin.

So, perhaps the 1/r² term in D comes from a point charge at the origin. Let me calculate what that point charge would be.

The D field from a point charge Q is (Q/(4π r²)) 1_r. So comparing that to the 1/r² term in D, which is (1/r²) 1_r, so equate the two: (Q/(4π r²)) = (1/r²), so Q = 4π * 1 = 4π coulombs.

Wait, no. Because in D's expression inside the sphere, the D field is [r + 1/r²], so the 1/r² part would come from a point charge of Q = 4π * (1) = 4π C. So that's a point charge at the origin.

Therefore, the total charge distribution consists of three parts: a uniform volume charge density rho = 3 C/m³, a surface charge sigma = - [r₀ + 1/r₀²] on the sphere r=r₀, and a point charge Q =4π C at the origin.

Wait, but wait: the point charge is included in the volume charge rho_free? Because earlier, when I calculated the divergence, I found rho_free =3 C/m³, but that might be ignoring the delta function at the origin. Because when I computed the divergence, I treated D as differentiable, but in reality, at r=0, the 1/r² term leads to a delta function in rho_free.

So perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the divergence of D is 3 C/m³ plus a delta function at the origin corresponding to the point charge.

Wait, let me think again. The D field is D(r) = [r + 1/r²] for r < r₀. Let me compute the divergence again, but this time accounting for any delta functions.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² D(r)).

For r > 0, r² D(r) = r³ + 1.

d/dr (r³ +1) = 3r², so divergence is 3r² / r² = 3. So rho_free is 3 everywhere except at r=0.

But wait, when r approaches zero, the 1/r² term leads to a delta function in the divergence. Because the divergence of 1/r² in spherical coordinates is 4π delta(r). Let me confirm that: the divergence of (1/r²) ȓ is 4π delta³(r). So in this case, the D field has a term 1/r² ȓ, so its divergence is 4π delta(r).

Therefore, the total rho_free is 3 + 4π delta(r), but wait, no. Because when I compute the divergence of [r + 1/r²], I get 3 from the 'r' term, and 4π delta(r) from the '1/r²' term. So rho_free would be 3 + 4π delta(r). But does that make sense? Let me think again.

Wait, the function D(r) is [r + 1/r²], so when taking the divergence, each term contributes separately. So the divergence of r ȓ is 3 (as we have), and the divergence of (1/r²) ȓ is 4π delta(r). So the total rho_free is 3 + 4π delta(r).

Wait, but that means that there is a volume charge density of 3 C/m³ plus a point charge of 4π C at the origin. So in the options, the point charge is 4π C. Now, looking back at the options:

Option C: uniform charge density 4 C/m³, no surface charge, and 4π point charge.

Option G: 2 C/m³, surface charge - [r₀ + 1/r₀²], and 4π point charge.

Wait, but according to our calculation, we have a volume charge of 3 C/m³, surface charge of - [r₀ + 1/r₀²], and a point charge of 4π C.

Looking at the options, let's check each.

Option E: uniform charge density 3 C/m³, surface charge - [r₀ + 1/r₀²], and point charge 2π.

Hmm, but our point charge is 4π, so that's not matching.

Option J: uniform charge density 3 C/m³, surface charge - [r₀ + 1/r₀²], and point charge 4π. Yes, that matches.

Wait, what's option J?

Looking back: Option J says a uniform charge density of 3 C/m³, surface charge of - [r₀ + 1/r₀²], and a point charge of 4π coulombs. Yes, that's exactly what we have.

Wait, but earlier I thought the surface charge sigma was negative [r₀ + 1/r₀²], which matches. The volume charge is 3 C/m³, and the point charge is 4π C.

So the correct option would be J.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option G has a uniform charge of 2 C/m³, which doesn't match. Option C has 4 C/m³, which is higher than our 3. Option E has a point charge of 2π, but we have 4π.

So the correct answer is option J.

To determine the charges required to produce the given electric displacement field **D = [r + (1/r²)] U(r₀ - r) 1_r**, we analyze the problem using the relationship between the divergence of **D** and the free charge density, as well as the discontinuity of **D** across surfaces.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Divergence of D (Volume Charge Density):**
   The divergence of **D** in spherical coordinates is given by:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 D(r) \right).
   \]
   Inside the sphere (\(r < r_0\)), \(D(r) = r + \frac{1}{r^2}\). Substituting this:
   \[
   r^2 D(r) = r^3 + 1, \quad \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^3 + 1 \right) = 3r^2, \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \frac{3r^2}{r^2} = 3.
   \]
   Thus, the free charge density is constant inside the sphere: \(\rho_{\text{free}} = 3 \, \text{C/m}^3\).

2. **Surface Charge Density at \(r = r_0\):**
   The discontinuity in **D** across the surface \(r = r_0\) gives the surface charge density:
   \[
   \sigma_{\text{free}} = D_{\text{inside}} - D_{\text{outside}}.
   \]
   Inside (\(r < r_0\)): \(D_{\text{inside}} = r_0 + \frac{1}{r_0^2}\). Outside (\(r > r_0\)): \(D_{\text{outside}} = 0\). Therefore:
   \[
   \sigma_{\text{free}} = - \left( r_0 + \frac{1}{r_0^2} \right).
   \]

3. **Point Charge at the Origin:**
   The term \(\frac{1}{r^2}\) in \(D(r)\) corresponds to the field of a point charge. Comparing with the standard form of the displacement field for a point charge, \(D = \frac{Q}{4\pi r^2} \hat{r}\), we find:
   \[
   Q = 4\pi \, \text{C}.
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Uniform Charge Density:** The volume charge density is \(3 \, \text{C/m}^3\), which matches options **E**, **H**, **J**, and **D**.
- **Surface Charge Density:** The surface charge is \(- \left( r_0 + \frac{1}{r_0^2} \right)\), which matches options **E**, **G**, **H**, **J**, and **I**.
- **Point Charge:** The point charge at the origin is \(4\pi \, \text{C}\), which matches options **A**, **C**, **G**, and **J**.

Combining all three components, the correct option is **J**:  
- Uniform charge density: \(3 \, \text{C/m}^3\),  
- Surface charge: \(- \left( r_0 + \frac{1}{r_0^2} \right
