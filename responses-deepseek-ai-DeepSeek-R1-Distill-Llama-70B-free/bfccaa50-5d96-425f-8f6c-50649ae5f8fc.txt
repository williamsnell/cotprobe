Question:

The superintendent of a large school district asks the school psychologist to predict students' grade point averages (GPAs) for the first year of high school. The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?

Options:

A: The cost of administering the school interest inventory to all students
B: The correlation between the school interest inventory scores and the achievement test scores
C: The similarity between the school interest inventory scores and the aptitude test scores
D: The effect of the school interest inventory score on the students' second-year high school GPA
E: The correlation between the school interest inventory score and the students' middle school GPA
F: The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA
G: The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score
H: The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA
I: The time required to administer the school interest inventory
J: The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a school psychologist deciding whether to include a school interest inventory in a regression analysis to predict high school GPAs. Hmm, I need to figure out the major concern here.

The question says the psychologist has already included achievement and aptitude scores as predictors. Now they're thinking about adding the interest inventory. So the options are about what the main issue is when making that decision.

I remember that in regression analysis, when you add a new variable, you want to know if it contributes significantly to the prediction. The key thing is whether the new variable adds to the model's predictive power beyond what's already there. So the concern would be about the new variable's impact on the model's multiple correlation coefficient.

Looking at the options, option F says it's about the degree to which the interest score raises the multiple correlation. That makes sense because if adding it doesn't significantly increase the correlation, it's probably not worth including. 

Other options don't seem as relevant. Option A is about cost, which is practical but not the statistical concern. Option B is about correlation with achievement, but that's about multicollinearity, not necessarily the main point here. Option E talks about middle school GPA, which isn't the outcome variable here. Option G is zero-order correlation, but in multiple regression, we care about the unique contribution, so partial correlations matter more. 

So the main concern should be whether adding the interest inventory improves the model's ability to predict first-year GPA. So the correct answer is F.

The school psychologist's primary concern when deciding whether to include the school interest inventory in the regression analysis should be whether it significantly improves the model's predictive power. This is best assessed by determining the degree to which the interest inventory scores raise the multiple correlation coefficient for predicting first-year high school GPA. Among the options, F directly addresses this concern, making it the correct choice.

Answer: F
