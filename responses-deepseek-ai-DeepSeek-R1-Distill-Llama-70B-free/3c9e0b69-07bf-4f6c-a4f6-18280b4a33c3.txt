Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Alright, let's read it again carefully.

So, a ball is thrown eastward into the air from the origin. The initial velocity is given as 50i +80k feet per second. Wait, i, j, k are the unit vectors in the x, y, z directions. So, east is the positive x, right? So 50i would be the x-component, and 80k is the vertical component, upward I guess.

The spin of the ball causes a southward acceleration of 4 ft/s². Hmm, south is the negative y direction. So the acceleration vector is given as a = -4j -32k. Wait, why -32k? Oh, because gravity is acting downward, which is the negative z direction. So the acceleration has two components: -4j (southward) and -32k (downward, gravity).

The question is asking what speed the ball lands with. So I need to find the speed when it hits the ground again.

I remember that in projectile motion, we can break the problem into components. But wait, this isn't a standard projectile because of the additional southward acceleration. That complicates things a bit. So I can't just use the usual kinematic equations for each axis independently because the acceleration affects the y-component.

Let's outline the problem:

- Initial position: origin (0,0,0)
- Initial velocity: v₀ = 50i +80k (so v₀x =50, v₀y=0, v₀z=80)
- Acceleration: a = -4j -32k (so ax=0, ay=-4, az=-32)

I need to find the final velocity when the ball lands, which is when the z (vertical) position is back to zero (ground level).

So first, I should find the time when it lands. To do that, I can model the vertical (z) motion.

The vertical motion is along the z-axis. The initial velocity is 80 ft/s upward. The acceleration is -32 ft/s² (downward). So the equation for the position in z is:

z(t) = z₀ + v₀z * t + (1/2) a_z t²

Since z₀ is 0, and a_z is -32, this becomes:

z(t) = 80 t + (1/2)(-32) t²
z(t) = 80 t -16 t²

We want to find when z(t) = 0 again (the ball lands). So set z(t)=0:

0 = 80 t -16 t²

Factor out t:

t(80 -16 t) = 0

So t=0 (initial throw) and 80-16 t =0 → t=80/(16) =5 seconds. So the ball lands at t=5 seconds.

Now, I need to find the velocity components at t=5s.

Velocity is given by v(t) = v₀ + a t

So let's compute each component.

x-component: 
v_x = v₀x + a_x * t
v₀x is 50, a_x is 0, so v_x =50 +0*t =50 ft/s. So the x-component stays constant because there's no acceleration in the x direction.

y-component:
v_y = v₀y + a_y * t
v₀y is 0, a_y is -4. So v_y = 0 + (-4)*5 = -20 ft/s. So the ball is moving southward at 20 ft/s when it lands.

z-component:
v_z = v₀z + a_z * t
v₀z is 80, a_z is -32. So v_z =80 + (-32)*5 = 80 -160 = -80 ft/s. So the ball is moving downward at 80 ft/s when it lands.

So the velocity vector at landing is (50, -20, -80) ft/s.

Now, the speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. So speed = sqrt(v_x² + v_y² + v_z²).

Let's compute each term:

v_x² = 50² =2500
v_y² = (-20)^2=400
v_z² = (-80)^2=6400
Sum: 2500 +400 =2900 +6400=9300.

So speed = sqrt(9300). Simplify that.

9300 = 100 *93. So sqrt(9300) = sqrt(100*93) =10*sqrt(93). So the speed is 10√93 ft/s.

Looking at the options, option I is 10√93 ft/s. So the answer should be I.

To determine the speed of the ball when it lands, we analyze its motion in three dimensions. The initial velocity is given as **v₀ = 50i + 80k** (eastward and upward), and the acceleration is **a = -4j - 32k** (southward and downward due to gravity). The ball lands when its vertical (z-axis) position returns to zero.

### Step 1: Time of flight
The vertical motion is governed by the equation:
\[
z(t) = z_0 + v_{0z}t + \frac{1}{2}a_z t^2
\]
Substituting \(z_0 = 0\), \(v_{0z} = 80 \, \mathrm{ft/s}\), and \(a_z = -32 \, \mathrm{ft/s^2}\):
\[
z(t) = 80t - 16t^2
\]
Setting \(z(t) = 0\) to find when the ball lands:
\[
0 = 80t - 16t^2 \implies t(80 - 16t) = 0
\]
This gives \(t = 0\) (initial throw) and \(t = 5 \, \mathrm{s}\) (when the ball lands). Thus, the ball lands at \(t = 5 \, \mathrm{s}\).

### Step 2: Velocity components at \(t = 5 \, \mathrm{s}\)
The velocity vector is given by:
\[
\mathbf{v}(t) = \mathbf{v}_0 + \mathbf{a}t
\]
Breaking this into components:
1. **x-component**: \(v_x = v_{0x} + a_x t = 50 + 0 \cdot t = 50 \, \mathrm{ft/s}\)
2. **y-component**: \(v_y = v_{0y} + a_y t = 0 + (-4) \cdot t = -20 \, \mathrm{ft/s}\)
3. **z-component**: \(v_z = v_{0z} + a_z t = 80 + (-32) \cdot t = -80 \, \mathrm{ft/s}\)

Thus, the velocity vector at landing is:
\[
\mathbf{v}(5) = 50 \, \mathbf{i} - 20 \, \mathbf{j} - 80 \, \mathbf{k} \, \mathrm{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Speed at landing
The speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector:
\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}
\]
Substituting \(v_x = 50\), \(v_y = -20\), and \(v_z = -80\):
\[
\text{Speed} = \sqrt{50^2 + (-20)^2 + (-80)^2} = \sqrt{2500 + 400 + 6400} = \sqrt{9300}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\sqrt{9300} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 93} = 10\sqrt{93} \, \mathrm{ft/s}
\]

### Final Answer
The speed of the ball when it lands is \(10\sqrt{93} \, \mathrm{ft/s}\), which corresponds to option **I**.
