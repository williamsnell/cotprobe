Okay, so I've got this question about power factor in a circuit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what I remember about power factor. Power factor is the ratio of real power to apparent power, right? It's like cos(theta) where theta is the phase angle between voltage and current.

The question gives me the readings from three meters: ammeter, voltmeter, and wattmeter. The ammeter reads 0.15 amperes, the voltmeter is at 115 volts, and the wattmeter shows 15.9 watts. So I need to calculate the power factor from these values.

Wait, power factor (PF) is calculated as the real power divided by the apparent power. Oh right, the formula is PF = P / (V * I), since apparent power is voltage multiplied by current.

So let's plug in the numbers. The real power P is given by the wattmeter, which is 15.9 watts. The voltage V is 115 volts, and the current I is 0.15 amperes.

Calculating the denominator first: V * I = 115 * 0.15. Let me compute that. 115 times 0.15... 100*0.15 is 15, 15*0.15 is 2.25. So 15 + 2.25 = 17.25. So apparent power is 17.25 VA (volt-amperes).

Now the real power is 15.9 W. So PF = 15.9 / 17.25. Let me do that division. Hmm, 15.9 divided by 17.25. Maybe I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator can be multiplied by 100 to make it 1590 / 1725. Let me see if I can reduce this.

Divide numerator and denominator by 15. 1590 ÷15 = 106, and 1725 ÷15 = 115. So now it's 106/115. Let me compute this division.

106 divided by 115. Hmm, 115 goes into 106 zero times. So I'll add a decimal point and some zeros. 1060 divided by 115. 115 *9 is 1035. Subtract 1035 from 1060, that leaves 25. Bring down next zero: 250. 115*2=230. Subtract from 250: 20. Bring down next zero: 200. 115*1=115. Subtract: 85. Bring down zero: 850. 115*7=805. Subtract: 45. Bring down zero: 450. 115*3=345. Subtract: 105. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here, but maybe it's around 0.92 something.

Wait, that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it. 17.25 is the denominator. So 15.9 /17.25. Let's see, 15.9 is 0.9 times 17.666... So 17.25 is a bit less than that. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 15.9 ÷17.25.

Alternatively, I can compute 15.9 / 17.25 = (15.9 * 100) / (17.25 * 100) )= 1590 / 1725. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 3: 1590/3=530; 1725/3=575. So 530/575. Hmm. Wait, 530 divided by 575. Let's see, 575 is larger than 530. So it's less than 1. Wait, perhaps I should have done it differently. Alternatively, 15.9 /17.25 = (159/172.5) * (1/10). Wait, maybe that's not helping.

Wait, perhaps I can multiply numerator and denominator by 4 to eliminate the decimal. 15.9 *4 is 63.6, and 17.25 *4 is 69. So now it's 63.6 /69. That's easier. 63.6 ÷69.

Let me compute that. 69 into 63.6. 69 goes into 63.6 0.92 times? Let me check: 69 * 0.9 = 62.1. Subtracting that from 63.6 gives 1.5. 69 goes into 1.5 about 0.0217 times. So total is approximately 0.9217. So around 0.92.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.92. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I make little mistakes. So:

PF = 15.9 / (115 * 0.15) = 15.9 / 17.25.

15.9 ÷17.25.

17.25 *0.9 =15.525. 15.9 -15.525 is 0.375.

So 0.375 /17.25 = 0.0217. So 0.9 +0.0217=0.9217. Yep, so PF is approximately 0.92, which matches option I.

To determine the power factor (PF) of the circuit, we use the formula:

\[
\text{PF} = \frac{P}{V \cdot I}
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the real power (given by the wattmeter as 15.9 W),
- \( V \) is the voltage (given by the voltmeter as 115 V),
- \( I \) is the current (given by the ammeter as 0.15 A).

First, calculate the apparent power (\( V \cdot I \)):

\[
V \cdot I = 115 \cdot 0.15 = 17.25 \, \text{VA (volt-amperes)}.
\]

Next, calculate the power factor:

\[
\text{PF} = \frac{P}{V \cdot I} = \frac{15.9}{17.25}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{15.9}{17.25} \approx 0.9217.
\]

Thus, the power factor is approximately \( 0.92 \).

From the given options, the closest match is:

**I: 0.92**
