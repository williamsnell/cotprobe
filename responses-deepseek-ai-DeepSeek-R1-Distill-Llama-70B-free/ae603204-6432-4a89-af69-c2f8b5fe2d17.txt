Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about symbolizing a sentence using propositional logic (PL). The sentence given is: "Dylan likes neither math nor science." And I have to choose the correct formula from the options provided.

First, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. The key part here is "neither... nor," which indicates that both options are being negated. So Dylan doesn't like math and he doesn't like science either.

Let me break it down. Let's assign some variables to make it easier. Let me say that M stands for "Dylan likes math" and S stands for "Dylan likes science." So the sentence is saying that both M and S are false.

Now, the original sentence is a negation of both—so in logic terms, I think that would translate to the negation of M and the negation of S. So that would be ~M and ~S. But I need to combine these two somehow.

In propositional logic, when we want to say that both of two things are true, we use a conjunction, which is the ∧ symbol. So if I want to say that Dylan doesn't like math AND he doesn't like science, that would be ~M ∧ ~S. So I think that's the correct formula.

Looking at the options, option C is ~M ∧ ~S. That seems to fit. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes these questions can be tricky with the wording.

Another way to approach this is to think about the structure of the sentence. The sentence is "neither M nor S," which is logically equivalent to saying "not (M or S)." Because if you don't have either one, then it's the same as saying it's not the case that you have at least one of them.

Wait, but that's another way to look at it. "Neither M nor S" is the same as "not (M or S)." So that would be ~(M ∨ S). Hmm, that's option H.

Wait, now I'm confused. Am I supposed to represent it as the conjunction of the negations or the negation of the disjunction?

I remember that in logic, De Morgan's laws tell us that ~(M ∨ S) is equivalent to ~M ∧ ~S. So both expressions are logically equivalent. So whether I write ~M ∧ ~S or ~(M ∨ S), they mean the same thing.

So looking back at the options, option C is ~M ∧ ~S, and option H is ~(M ∨ S). Both would be correct in terms of meaning, but the question is asking for the best symbolization of the given sentence.

The original sentence is "Dylan likes neither math nor science." The phrase "neither... nor" is naturally expressing the negation of both, which aligns more directly with the conjunction of the negations, ~M ∧ ~S. So option C seems to be the more straightforward symbolization.

But wait, I should double-check. Let me think about how each option is structured.

Option J is ~M ∨ ~S. That's the disjunction of the negations. That would mean "either Dylan doesn't like math, or he doesn't like science, or both." But the original sentence is stating that he likes neither, which implies both. So J isn't as precise because it allows for cases where only one is disliked.

So, the correct expression must be a conjunction, not a disjunction. So option C is ~M ∧ ~S, which correctly states both dislikes, while option H is ~(M ∨ S), which is another way of expressing the same thing.

So which one is better? The question is about the best symbolization. Since the sentence uses "neither... nor," it's more directly represented by the conjunction of the negations, which is option C. However, option H is logically equivalent because of De Morgan's law.

Wait, but let me look at all the options again to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A: M ∨ ~S → This would mean Dylan likes math or doesn't like science. Doesn't fit the "neither" case.

Option B: ~M ∨ S → Doesn't like math or likes science. Also not the case.

Option C: ~M ∧ ~S → Correct, both negated.

Option D: M ∨ S → Likes math or science. Opposite of what we need.

Option E: M ∧ S → Likes both. Also opposite.

Option F: ~(~M ∨ S) → This simplifies to M ∧ ~S. So likes math but not science. Not the case.

Option G: ~(M • S) → Assuming • is conjunction, so ~(M ∧ S) which is equivalent to ~M ∨ ~S. So this is option J, which is the disjunction of negations.

Option H: ~(M ∨ S) → Which is equivalent to ~M ∧ ~S.

Option I: ~(M ∧ ~S) → This would mean it's not the case that Dylan likes math but not science. Not relevant here.

Option J: ~M ∨ ~S → As discussed, this is different from what we need.

So the correct options are C and H. But which one is the best symbolization of the original sentence?

The original sentence is "Dylan likes neither math nor science." The structure here is "neither X nor Y," which in logic is usually represented as ~(X ∨ Y), or equivalently, ~X ∧ ~Y. But sometimes, the "neither... nor" is directly translated as the conjunction of the negations.

So, in terms of direct translation, option C would be the most straightforward: ~M ∧ ~S.

But another perspective is that "neither... nor" is the negation of "either... or," which would make it ~(M ∨ S), which is option H.

So which is better? I think it's a matter of how the sentence is phrased. Since the sentence is asserting that both are not liked, the conjunction of the negations (option C) directly reflects that.

However, sometimes in logic, ~(M ∨ S) is considered the standard way to represent "neither." But I'm a bit torn here because both options are correct, but the question is about the best symbolization.

Wait, another thought: The sentence can be read as Dylan does not like math, and Dylan does not like science. So it's asserting both negations, which would be ~M ∧ ~S. So option C is the direct symbolization.

Alternatively, using De Morgan's law, it's also correct to write it as ~(M ∨ S), which is option H. So both C and H are correct, but the question is, which is the best symbolization.

Looking back at the options, the answer choices include both C and H, so I need to decide between them.

The way the sentence is phrased uses "neither... nor," which in English often corresponds to the negation of a disjunction. So "Dylan likes neither math nor science" is the same as "It's not the case that Dylan likes math or science," which would be ~(M ∨ S), so option H.

Wait, but I thought earlier that "neither... nor" is more like the conjunction of the negations. Maybe I should look up how "neither... nor" is typically translated in logic.

From what I remember, "Neither P nor Q" is logically equivalent to "Not (P or Q)", which is ~(P ∨ Q). So that would make option H the correct choice.

But then again, ~(P ∨ Q) is equivalent to ~P ∧ ~Q, so both C and H are correct. However, the question is about the best symbolization of the given sentence. The sentence uses "neither... nor," which directly corresponds to ~(P ∨ Q), so H would be the better choice.

Wait, maybe I should think about how to construct the logic formula from the sentence. The sentence is a negation of a disjunction. So "neither" indicates that neither one is true, so it's not the case that either is true. So the formula is ~(M ∨ S), which is option H.

But earlier, I thought that option C, ~M ∧ ~S, is equally correct. So which one should I pick as the best symbolization?

The question is about the best formula, so it's possible that both are correct, but perhaps one is more direct. Since the sentence uses "neither... nor," which is a negation of a disjunction in natural language, the direct translation would be ~(M ∨ S), which is option H.

But wait, another angle: In some logic systems, "neither... nor" is represented as the conjunction of the negations, so ~M ∧ ~S. So which is more appropriate?

I think both options are correct, but the answer might expect option C because it directly represents both negations without using the disjunction.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is ~M ∧ ~S, which clearly states both are not liked. Option H is ~(M ∨ S), which also means the same.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider how the sentence is structured. "Dylan likes neither math nor science" can be broken down as Dylan does not like math (¬M) and Dylan does not like science (¬S), so the conjunction of both, which is option C.

Yes, that makes sense. So option C is the correct answer.

The sentence "Dylan likes neither math nor science" is analyzed to determine its logical symbolization. Assigning variables, let \( M \) represent "Dylan likes math" and \( S \) represent "Dylan likes science." The phrase "neither... nor" indicates that both \( M \) and \( S \) are negated, meaning Dylan does not like math and does not like science.

This can be expressed in two ways:
1. As the conjunction of the negations: \( \neg M \land \neg S \), which directly states that both \( M \) and \( S \) are false.
2. As the negation of a disjunction: \( \neg (M \lor S) \), which means it is not the case that Dylan likes math or science.

Both \( \neg M \land \neg S \) (option C) and \( \neg (M \lor S) \) (option H) are logically equivalent due to De Morgan's laws. However, the sentence's structure "neither... nor" aligns more directly with the conjunction of the negations, \( \neg M \land \neg S \), as it explicitly asserts that both are false.

Thus, the best symbolization of the sentence is \( \neg M \land \neg S \), which corresponds to option C.
