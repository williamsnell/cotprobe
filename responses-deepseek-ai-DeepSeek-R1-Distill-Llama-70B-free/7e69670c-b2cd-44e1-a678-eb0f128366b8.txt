Okay, so I've got this Laplace transform problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is asking for the Laplace transform of g(t), where g(t) is zero when t is less than 4 and equals (t-4)^2 when t is greater than or equal to 4. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, Laplace transforms can sometimes be tricky, especially with functions that have time shifts. I remember that when a function is shifted in time, like starting at t = a instead of t = 0, we use the time-shifting property of Laplace transforms.

The time-shifting formula is L{f(t - a)u(t - a)} = e^(-a s) F(s), where u is the unit step function and F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t). So in this case, g(t) is (t-4)^2 multiplied by the unit step function u(t-4). So, g(t) = (t-4)^2 u(t-4).

Now, I need to find the Laplace transform of (t-4)^2. Let me think about the Laplace transform of t^n. I recall that L{t^n} = n! / s^(n+1). So for n=2, L{t^2} = 2! / s^3, which is 2/s^3.

But wait, here the function is (t-4)^2, so I can think of it as f(t) = (t)^2 shifted to start at t=4. So using the time-shifting property, the Laplace transform would be e^(-4s) multiplied by the transform of t^2. That would be e^(-4s) * 2/s^3.

Looking at the options, option A is (2 e^(-4s))/s^3, which matches what I just got. Option E is (2 e^(-4s))/s^4, but that's s^4 in the denominator, which doesn't fit because for t^2 it should be s^3.

Let me double-check. The function is (t-4)^2 for t â‰¥4, which is the same as f(t-4) where f(t) = t^2. So the Laplace transform of f(t) is 2/s^3. Then the time-shift introduces the exponential factor e^(-4s). So putting it together, it's (2 e^(-4s))/s^3, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I apply the correct time-shifting formula? Yes, because the function starts at t=4, so a=4. So F(s) is for t^2, which is 2/s^3, multiplied by e^(-4s). So yes, that's correct.

I think I'm confident with option A. Let me just glance through the other options again. Option C is (2/s^2)e^(-4s), but that's for t, not t^2. Option E is 2/s^4, which would be for t^3. So A seems right.

To find the Laplace transform \( \mathcal{L}\{g(t)\} \), where \( g(t) = 0 \) for \( t < 4 \) and \( g(t) = (t-4)^2 \) for \( t \geq 4 \), we use the time-shifting property of Laplace transforms. The function \( g(t) \) can be expressed as \( (t-4)^2 \cdot u(t-4) \), where \( u(t-4) \) is the unit step function.

The time-shifting property states that the Laplace transform of \( f(t-a) \cdot u(t-a) \) is \( e^{-as}F(s) \), where \( F(s) \) is the Laplace transform of \( f(t) \). Here, \( f(t) = t^2 \), and its Laplace transform is \( \mathcal{L}\{t^2\} = \frac{2}{s^3} \). Applying the time-shifting property with \( a = 4 \), the Laplace transform of \( g(t) \) becomes:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{g(t)\} = e^{-4s} \cdot \frac{2}{s^3} = \frac{2e^{-4s}}{s^3}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{2e^{-4s}}{s^3} \) matches the derived result.
- **Option B**: \( \frac{2}{s^3} \) is incorrect because it lacks the exponential factor \( e^{-4s} \).
- **Option C**: \( \frac{2}{s^2} \cdot e^{-4s} \) is incorrect because the denominator should be \( s^3 \), not \( s^2 \).
- **Option D**: \( \frac{4}{s^3} \) is incorrect because it lacks the exponential factor \( e^{-4s} \).
- **Option E**: \( \frac{2e^{-4s}}{s^4} \) is incorrect because the denominator should be \( s^3 \), not \( s^4 \).
- **Option F**: \( \frac{2}{s^3} \cdot e^{-s} \) is incorrect because the exponential factor should be \( e^{-4s} \), not \( e^{-s} \).
- **Option G**: \( e^{-4s} \) is incorrect because it does not include the \( \frac{2}{s^3} \) term.
- **Option H**: \( \frac{e^{-4s}}{s^2} \) is incorrect because the denominator should be \( s^3 \), not \( s^2 \).
- **Option I**: \( \frac{2}{s} \cdot e^{-4s} \) is incorrect because the denominator should be \( s^3 \), not \( s \).
- **Option J**: \( \frac{t^2 - 8t + 16}{s} \) is incorrect because it does not represent the Laplace transform of \( g(t) \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: \( \frac{2e^{-4s}}{s^3} \)**.
