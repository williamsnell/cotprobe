Okay, let's see. I've got this question about productivity between two countries, X and Z. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the question says that country X has an output of 30,000 units with 3,000 workers. Country Z's output is 40,000 units with 8,000 workers. I think productivity here refers to labor productivity, which is output per worker.

I remember that productivity is calculated as total output divided by the number of workers. So, for each country, I can compute this.

Let's start with country X. Their output is 30,000 units. They have 3,000 people working. So, dividing 30,000 by 3,000 gives me 10 units per worker. So, productivity in X is 10.

Now, country Z has 40,000 units of output and 8,000 workers. So, 40,000 divided by 8,000 is 5 units per worker. So, productivity in Z is 5.

Wait, wait. That means country X's productivity is higher than Z's. Because 10 is more than 5. So, I'm looking for an option where X is more productive by a certain percentage.

The question is, by what percentage is X's productivity higher than Z's. So, I think the formula for percentage increase is [(X - Z)/Z] * 100%.

Plugging in the numbers: (10 -5)/5 = 1. So, 1 *100% is 100% increase. Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, none of them say 100%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait wait, no. Let me double-check. Productivity X is 10, Z is 5. So, X is 10/5 = 2 times Z's productivity. So, that's a 100% increase. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.

Options provided are:

A: X is 75% higher than Z.

B: X is 33% higher.

C: Z is 33% higher than X.

D: Z is 50% higher than X.

E: X is 50% higher.

F: Same.

G: X is 25% lower.

H: Z is twice X.

I: X is twice Z.

J: Z is 25% higher.

Wait, my calculation says X is 100% higher than Z, which would mean X is twice as productive. So, which option says that? Looking at the options, option I says "The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as country Z." That sounds right because 10 is twice 5.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes percentage higher can be tricky. Let's think again. If Z is 5 and X is 10, then X is 5 units higher than Z. So, the increase is 5 over Z's 5, which is 100% more. So, X is 100% higher than Z, which is the same as saying X is twice Z's productivity.

Looking back at the options, option I says X is twice as much as Z. So that's correct. But wait, let me check all the options again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: 75% higher. If X were 8.75, that would be 75% higher than 5 (5 *1.75=8.75). But X is 10, so that's not it.

Option B: 33% higher. 5 * 1.33 is about 6.65, which is less than 10.

Option E: 50% higher. 5 *1.5=7.5, still less than 10.

So, the correct answer must be option I: X's productivity is twice that of Z.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the percentage correctly. The percentage increase from Z to X is (X - Z)/Z *100%. So, (10-5)/5 *100 = 100%. So, X is 100% higher than Z, which is the same as saying X is twice Z.

So, the correct option is I.

To determine the productivity of labor in country X and country Z, we calculate output per worker for each country:

- **Country X**: Output is 30,000 units with 3,000 workers.  
  Productivity = \( \frac{30,000}{3,000} = 10 \) units per worker.  

- **Country Z**: Output is 40,000 units with 8,000 workers.  
  Productivity = \( \frac{40,000}{8,000} = 5 \) units per worker.  

Next, we compare the productivity of the two countries. Country X's productivity (10 units per worker) is twice that of country Z (5 units per worker). This means country X's productivity is 100% higher than country Z's productivity.

Analyzing the options:  
- **Option I** states, "The productivity of labor in country X is twice as much as country Z," which aligns with the calculation.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
