Okay, so I've got this problem about water moving through a heat exchanger tube, and I need to find the exit temperature using some analogies: Reynolds, Colburn, Prandtl, and von Karman. Hmm, I remember that these are related to heat transfer and fluid flow. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the given data to make sure I have everything straight. The inside diameter D is 1.25 inches, and the length L is 9.0 feet. The water enters at 45°F with a flow rate of 18 gallons per minute. The wall temperature is a constant 200°F. I need to find the exit temperature. The options are multiple choice, so I'll have to calculate and see which one matches.

Wait, the question mentions using analogies, so I think it's referring to the Reynolds analogy, which relates heat transfer and friction in turbulent flow. Oh right, the Reynolds analogy is Nu = (f/2) Re Pr^(1/3), and sometimes it's used with the Colburn analogy, which is Nu = (f/2) Re Pr^(1/3) for turbulent flow. Or maybe it's the Prandtl and von Karman analogies, which I think are for laminar flow but maybe applicable here depending on the flow regime.

Wait, first I need to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Oh right, for that, I calculate the Reynolds number. Reynolds number Re is (v D)/ν, where v is the velocity, D is diameter, and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but I don't have the velocity yet. Alternatively, I can compute Re using the flow rate. The flow rate is given in gallons per minute, so maybe I should convert that into more standard units. Let me think.

Flow rate Q is 18 gal/min. I know that 1 gallon is about 0.00378541 cubic meters, but maybe better to convert to feet and seconds for consistency. Let me see: 1 gallon is 0.133681 cubic feet. So 18 gal/min is 18 * 0.133681 = approximately 2.4062 cubic feet per minute. But wait, to get velocity, I need to find the volumetric flow rate per area.

Wait, the tube's inside diameter is 1.25 inches. Let me convert that to feet. 1.25 inches is 1.25/12 = 0.1041667 feet. The cross-sectional area A is π D² /4. So A = π * (0.1041667)^2 /4. Let me calculate that.

0.1041667 squared is approximately 0.0108333. Multiply by π gives about 0.034069. Divided by 4, that's roughly 0.00851725 square feet.

So the velocity v is Q/A. Wait, Q is in cubic feet per minute, and A is in square feet. So v = (2.4062 ft³/min) / (0.00851725 ft²) = let me compute that. 2.4062 / 0.00851725 ≈ 282.4 feet per minute. That's about 4.707 feet per second (since 282.4 /60 ≈ 4.707).

Hmm, but wait, I'm using units here. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to convert the flow rate into SI units. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for Reynolds number in terms of flow rate. Let me recall that formula.

Reynolds number can be calculated as Re = (4 * Q) / (π D ν), where Q is the volumetric flow rate. Wait, but I need to make sure all units are consistent. Let me check the units.

So, if I have Q in gallons per minute, I can convert that to cubic feet per second, but maybe that's a hassle. Alternatively, maybe use the formula with appropriate unit conversions.

Wait, another approach: The formula for Re is (v D)/ν. I have D in inches, so let me convert that to feet as I did before. D = 1.25 in = 0.1041667 ft.

I have velocity v in feet per second, as I found before. What about ν (kinematic viscosity) for water? At what temperature? Hmm, since the water is entering at 45°F, which is about 7.22°C. I think the viscosity of water around that temperature is around 0.00001 ft²/s, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ν is approximately 1.08 ×10^-5 ft²/s at 45°F. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact value, but since I can't, I'll proceed with an approximate value.

Wait, the kinematic viscosity ν for water at 45°F (7.2°C) is about 0.00001 ft²/s. Let me double-check: I think at 20°C, it's about 1.004×10^-6 m²/s. Wait, 1 m²/s is 10.7639 ft²/s, so 1.004e-6 m²/s is about 1.08e-5 ft²/s. So at 45°F, which is a bit higher than 20°C, the viscosity would be lower. So maybe around 0.8e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, perhaps using exact values isn't possible, but for the sake of calculation, I'll proceed with ν = 0.9e-5 ft²/s.

So, Re = v D / ν. I have v ≈ 4.707 ft/s, D = 0.1041667 ft. So v D is 4.707 * 0.1041667 ≈ 0.4907 ft²/s.

Then, Re = 0.4907 / (0.9e-5) ≈ 0.4907 / 0.00009 ≈ 5450. Hmm, wait, that's about 5450. So Re is 5450. That's in the turbulent flow regime, which typically starts around Re=4000. So yes, turbulent flow.

So, since it's turbulent, I can use the Reynolds analogy or the Colburn analogy. Let me recall that the Colburn analogy is Nu = (f/2) Re Pr^(1/3). And the Prandtl number Pr is the ratio of viscous diffusion to thermal diffusion. For water, at around 45°F, Pr is about 4 or so? Wait, at 20°C, Pr is around 7, but as temperature increases, it decreases. So at 45°F, which is lower than 20°C, perhaps Pr is higher, maybe around 7 or 8. Wait, I think at 40°F, Pr is about 7.02, and at 50°F, it's about 6.0. So maybe taking Pr as 6.5 or so would be a rough estimate.

Wait, perhaps I can get a more accurate value. Let me think: The Prandtl number for water varies with temperature. At 45°F, which is 7.22°C, Pr is around 9.42? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a table or formula, but since I can't, I'll proceed with Pr=6.5 for now.

Next, I need to find the friction factor f for turbulent flow. For that, I can use the von Karman equation or the Colebrook-White equation. Alternatively, the Blasius equation gives f = 0.316 Re^(-1/4) for turbulent flow in smooth tubes, which is a simplification. Since we're using analogies, perhaps the assumption is a smooth tube, so Blasius is acceptable.

So, Blasius: f = 0.316 Re^(-1/4). Since Re is 5450, let's compute Re^(-1/4). Let me compute Re^(1/4) first: 5450^(0.25). The fourth root of 10,000 is 10, so 5450 is a bit less. Let me approximate:

Let me see, 5^4 is 625, 10^4 is 10,000. So 5450 is 5.45 ×10^3, so the fourth root is (5.45)^(1/4) × (10^3)^(1/4).

(10^3)^(1/4) is 10^(3/4) ≈ 5.623. And (5.45)^(1/4) is approximately 1.5, because 1.5^4 is 5.06. So 5.45 would be a bit higher, say about 1.52. So 1.52 *5.623 ≈ 8.55. So Re^(1/4) ≈8.55.

So Re^(-1/4) is 1/8.55 ≈0.117. So f =0.316 * 0.117 ≈0.037.

Wait, let me check that. 0.316 * 0.117. 0.3*0.117=0.0351, 0.016 *0.117=0.001872. So total f≈0.03697, approximately 0.037.

So now, using the Colburn analogy, Nu = (f/2) Re Pr^(1/3).

So, f/2 = 0.037/2=0.0185.

Re is 5450.

Pr is 6.5, so Pr^(1/3) is cube root of 6.5. Let me compute that. Cube root of 8 is 2, cube root of 1 is 1, so 6.5 is between 1.8 and 1.9. Let's compute 1.8^3=5.832, 1.85^3= (1.8+0.05)^3= 1.8^3 + 3*(1.8)^2*(0.05) + 3*(1.8)*(0.05)^2 + (0.05)^3 =5.832 + 3*(3.24)(0.05) + ... Let me compute 3*(3.24)(0.05) =0.486, and the other terms are negligible. So 5.832 +0.486=6.318. So 1.85^3≈6.318, which is less than 6.5. Let me try 1.86^3: 1.8^3 is 5.832, 0.06^3 is 0.000216, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me compute (1.86)^3 = (1.8 + 0.06)^3.

Wait, maybe a better approach. Let me compute 1.86^3:

1.86 * 1.86 = (2 - 0.14)^2 = 4 - 0.56 + 0.0196 = 3.4596.

Then, 3.4596 *1.86: Let me compute 3.4596 * 1.8 = 6.227, and 3.4596 *0.06≈0.2076. So total is 6.227 +0.2076=6.4346. So 1.86^3≈6.4346. Still less than 6.5.

1.87^3: Let me compute 1.87 *1.87 first. 1.8*1.8=3.24, 1.8*0.07=0.126, 0.07*1.8=0.126, 0.07*0.07=0.0049. So 3.24 +0.126 +0.126 +0.0049 = 3.4969.

Then, 3.4969 *1.87: Let's compute 3.4969*1.8=6.29442, and 3.4969*0.07≈0.2448. So total 6.29442 +0.2448≈6.5392. So 1.87^3≈6.5392, which is just over 6.5. So, Pr^(1/3)= approx 1.87.

Wait, Pr is 6.5, so Pr^(1/3)= approximately 1.87.

So, putting it all together:

Nu = (0.0185) * (5450) * (1.87).

Let me compute 0.0185 *5450 first.

0.0185 *5450: 5450 *0.01=54.5; 5450*0.0085=5450*(0.01 -0.0015)=54.5 -8.175=46.325. So 0.0185 is 0.01 +0.0085, so 54.5 +46.325=100.825. So 0.0185*5450≈100.825.

Then, multiply by 1.87: 100.825 *1.87.

Let me compute 100 *1.87=187, 0.825*1.87≈1.54375. So total Nu≈187 +1.54375≈188.54375. So around 188.54.

Now, Nusselt number Nu is h * D / k, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, D is diameter, and k is thermal conductivity. So h = Nu *k / D.

I need the thermal conductivity of water at around 45°F. Let me recall that for water, at 40°C (104°F), k is about 0.628 W/m·K, but I'm not sure at lower temperatures. Wait, at 20°C, k is about 0.598 W/m·K. Let me try to find a value for 45°F, which is 7°C. I think at lower temperatures, the thermal conductivity decreases a bit. Wait, no, actually, water's thermal conductivity decreases as temperature increases. Wait, no, wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the thermal conductivity of water actually decreases as temperature increases beyond a certain point. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Let me think. At very low temperatures, like near freezing, water's thermal conductivity is higher. As temperature increases, k increases to a peak around 130°C, then starts to decrease. Wait, maybe I'm remembering it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should just use an approximate value of k=0.435 W/m·K, but wait, that's in SI units. Wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything to consistent units, perhaps SI or English units. Let me think in SI units for easier calculation. Let me proceed.

D is 1.25 inches, which is 0.03175 meters. So D=0.03175 m.

k for water at 45°F (7.2°C) is approximately 0.634 W/m·K. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check some approximate values. At 20°C, k is about 0.598 W/m·K. At 30°C, it's about 0.615. At 40°C, 0.628. Hmm, maybe at lower temperatures, it's a bit lower. Wait, perhaps at 10°C, it's about 0.581 W/m·K. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with an approximate value. Let me take k≈0.6 W/m·K for water at 45°F. Let's say k=0.6 W/m·K.

So h = Nu *k / D.

Nu is 188.54, k=0.6, D=0.03175 m.

So h = 188.54 * 0.6 / 0.03175.

Compute numerator: 188.54 *0.6 = 113.124.

Denominator: 0.03175.

So h = 113.124 /0.03175 ≈ 3563.5 W/m²·K.

Wait, that seems high, but okay, let's proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check.

Wait, Nusselt number is (h D)/k, so h = (Nu *k)/D. Yes, that's correct. So with D in meters, and k in W/m·K, the units for h would be W/m²·K.

Now, with h known, I can proceed to find the exit temperature of the water.

The heat exchanger is a tube, so this is a double-pipe or a single tube heat exchanger. We can model this as a steady-flow process. The heat transfer rate Q can be determined by the temperature change of the water and the heat gained from the wall.

The formula for heat transfer is Q = m c_p (T_out - T_in), where m is mass flow rate, c_p is specific heat, and T_in and T_out are inlet and outlet temperatures.

Also, Q can be expressed as Q = h A ΔT, where A is the surface area for heat transfer, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

But wait, the problem is that the tube wall is at a constant temperature T_wall, so the heat transfer is Q = h A (T_wall - T_bulk), where T_bulk is the bulk temperature of the fluid. But in this case, since the flow is through a tube, the bulk temperature changes along the tube, so we need to integrate along the length. Alternatively, maybe we can use the effectiveness-NTU method, but perhaps for this problem, the assumption is that the exit temperature is found using the log mean temperature difference or a simplified approach.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to use the energy balance equation and the convective heat transfer equation together.

Wait, the mass flow rate m_dot is rho * Q, where Q is the volumetric flow rate. So first, let's compute m_dot.

Density of water at 45°F. Let me recall that at 45°F, the density is about 999 kg/m³? Wait, no, wait, in English units, density of water is about 62.4 lbm/ft³ at 60°F. At 45°F, it's slightly higher. Let me approximate rho = 62.3 lbm/ft³.

Wait, but I'm using SI units for some calculations, so maybe better to convert all to SI.

Let me compute m_dot in SI units.

First, flow rate Q is 18 gal/min. Convert that to m³/s.

1 gal = 0.00378541 m³, so 18 gal = 0.0689074 m³. Per minute, so per second, it's 0.0689074 /
