Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about atmospheric pollutants, specifically SOx emissions from power stations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that SOx is a mixture mainly of SO2, but it can contain between 1% to 10% SO3 by weight. I need to find the approximate range for x in SOx. Wait, SOx is like a general term for the oxides of sulfur, right? So x would be the average number of oxygen atoms per sulfur atom in the mixture.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. SOx is the general formula, but in reality, it's a mixture of SO2 and SO3. So the question is asking for the range of x, which would be an average based on the percentages of SO2 and SO3.

Let me think. So for each molecule, SO2 has 2 oxygen atoms, SO3 has 3. But since the mixture is by mass, I can't just average the number of oxygens. I need to calculate the average based on the weight percentages.

Wait, no, the percentages given are by weight, but SOx is calculated as percent by weight of the total mass as SO3. So maybe I should think about the molar contributions or something like that.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the average value of x based on the proportions of SO2 and SO3 in the mixture by mass. But since the question gives the percentage of SO3 in the mixture as 1% to 10%, maybe I can model this as a weighted average.

So let's break it down. Let's say the total mass is M. Then, the mass of SO3 is between 1% and 10% of M, and the rest is SO2.

But wait, to find x, which is the average number of oxygen atoms per sulfur atom in the mixture, I think I need to consider the moles of each oxide and how much oxygen they contribute.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total moles of sulfur and the total moles of oxygen, then find the ratio O/S to get x.

Because for each SO2 molecule, there's 1 S and 2 O. For SO3, 1 S and 3 O. So if I have a certain number of moles of each, the total O is (2n2 + 3n3) and total S is (n2 + n3), so x would be (2n2 +3n3)/(n2 +n3).

But wait, the percentages given are by weight, so I need to convert that to moles.

Let me think. Let's consider a sample where the mass of SO3 is 1% to 10% of the total mass. So for each case (like 1% and 10%), I can compute x and then see the range.

Let me pick a total mass, say 100 grams, to make it easy. So for 1% SO3, that's 1 gram SO3 and 99 grams SO2. For 10%, it's 10 grams SO3 and 90 grams SO2.

But wait, I need to find the number of moles for each. The molar mass of SO2 is 64 g/mol (32(S) + 16*2(O)). The molar mass of SO3 is 80 g/mol (32 + 16*3).

So for the 1% case:

SO3 mass = 1g → moles = 1/80 ≈ 0.0125 mol.

SO2 mass = 99g → moles = 99/64 ≈ 1.5469 mol.

Total S atoms: 0.0125 + 1.5469 ≈ 1.5594 mol.

Total O atoms: SO3 contributes 3*0.0125 = 0.0375 mol. SO2 contributes 2*1.5469 ≈3.0938. Total O is 3.1313 mol.

So x is O/S → 3.1313 / 1.5594 ≈ 2.01.

Wait, that's for 1% SO3. Now for 10% SO3:

SO3 mass =10g → moles =10/80=0.125 mol.

SO2 mass=90g → moles=90/64≈1.40625 mol.

Total S: 0.125 +1.40625 =1.53125 mol.

O from SO3: 3 *0.125=0.375 mol.

O from SO2:2 *1.40625≈2.8125 mol.

Total O: 0.375+2.8125=3.1875.

x=3.1875 /1.53125 ≈2.083.

So for 1% SO3, x≈2.01, for 10% SO3, x≈2.083. So the range of x is approximately between 2.01 and 2.08.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices don't exactly match that. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A: x = 2.01 → which is the lower end of our calculation.

B: x = 3.14/1.56 → let's compute that. 3.14 is about pi, 1.56 is about pi/2. So 3.14/1.56≈2.01. So option B is approximately 2.01, same as option A.

C: x =1.56/3.14 → that's about 0.5. So that's not relevant.

D: x =1.25e-2 → that's 0.0125, which is way too low.

Wait, but our calculation shows that x ranges from about 2.01 to 2.08. So the possible x values in the options would be 2.01. But option B also gives 2.01, same as A.

But the question asks for the range, so maybe the x would vary between when it's 1% and 10% SO3. Wait, in our calculation, when SO3 is 1%, x is about 2.01, and when it's 10%, x is about 2.08.

So the range would be from 2.01 to approximately 2.08.

Looking at the options, the only ones that match any of these are options A and B, both giving 2.01. But the question is about the range to assign to x. So perhaps the options are considering another approach.

Wait another thought, maybe I should calculate x as the ratio of the average oxygen per sulfur, considering the mass fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is approximating x as (mass of SO3 *3 + mass of SO2 *2 ) divided by (mass of SO3 + mass of SO2), because each SO2 has 2 O, SO3 has 3 O.

Wait, but that approach doesn't account for molar masses. Oh, wait, because the percentage is by mass, maybe the approach is to compute the average O per S based on mass contribution, but that's not correct because the number of S atoms is more in the compound with lower molar mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial approach I took, considering the moles, gave x between 2.01 and 2.08. So the x would be approximately around 2.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.01, which is at the lower end. Option B is 3.14/1.56, which is about 2.01 as well. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or B.

Wait, but the question says "the approximate range to assign to x". Since when SO3 is 1%, x is 2.01, and when it's 10%, x is 2.08. So the range is about 2.01 to 2.08, but looking at the options, only 2.01 is present in options A and B.

So perhaps the intended answer is A: x=2.01, but that's only the lower bound. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molar ratio, not the mass ratio. But the problem states that SO3 is 1-10% by weight. So that's mass percent.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to compute the average molecular formula. Let me think: the formula is SOx. The total mass is M = m_SO2 + m_SO3.

Each mole of SO2 is 64 g, contributes 2 O per S. Each mole of SO3 is 80 g, contributes 3 O per S.

So the total moles of S is m_SO2/64 + m_SO3/80.

Wait, but I've already done that approach earlier. So perhaps I should think in terms of the atomic ratio.

Wait, another approach: compute the average O/S ratio based on the mass fractions.

Wait, for each compound, the O/S ratio is (2 for SO2, 3 for SO3). But the mass fractions are given, so the average would be the sum of (mass fraction * O/S ratio) divided by the sum of (mass fraction). But wait, that's not correct because the number of sulfur atoms depends on the moles, not the mass.

Ah, perhaps I'm getting confused between mass fraction and mole fraction. The problem gives mass fractions, so to find the average O per S, I need to compute (total O atoms) / (total S atoms).

Which is what I did earlier, and that gave me x between 2.01 and 2.08.

But looking at the options, only 2.01 is present in options A and B.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the average x would be around (1%*3 +99%*2)/100, but in terms of moles, which isn't correct because the mass percentages don't translate directly to mole percentages.

Wait, let's try that approach just to see. If I take the mass percentages as if they were mole fractions, which they aren't, but just for argument.

So for 1% SO3 (by mass), if I incorrectly treat it as mole fraction, x would be 0.01*3 + 0.99*2 = 0.03 + 1.98 = 2.01.

Similarly, for 10%, x would be 0.1*3 +0.9*2=0.3 +1.8=2.1.

So in that incorrect approach, x ranges from 2.01 to 2.1, but that's not considering the actual molar masses. However, the correct approach via moles gave x from 2.01 to 2.08.

But in the options, the only value close is 2.01. So perhaps the intended answer is A:2.01.

Alternatively, option B is 3.14/1.56, which is roughly 2.01. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or B.

Wait, but 3.14 is pi, which is about 22/7, and 1.56 is about half of 3.14. So 3.14/1.56 would be about 2.01.

So both A and B evaluate to the same value, 2.01.

But the question is about the range. So perhaps the correct answer is the range from 2.01 to 2.08, but since none of the options provide a range, maybe the intended answer is 2.01 as the lower bound. So perhaps the correct option is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the x as varying between 2 and 3, but that's too broad.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recheck.

For 1% SO3:

mass SO3=1g → moles SO3=1/80=0.0125 mol.

mass SO2=99g → moles=99/64≈1.546875 mol.

Total S atoms: 0.0125 +1.546875=1.559375 mol.

Total O atoms: (3 *0.0125)+(2 *1.546875)=0.0375 +3.09375=3.13125.

x=3.13125 /1.559375 ≈ 2.01.

For 10%:

mass SO3=10g → moles=10/80=0.125.

mass SO2=90g → moles=90/64≈1.40625.

S atoms: 0.125 +1.40625=1.53125.

O atoms: (3 *0.125)+(2 *1.40625)=0.375 +2.8125=3.1875.

x=3.1875 /1.53125≈2.0833.

So x ranges from about 2.01 to 2.08.

But the options don't have 2.08. Only 2.01 is present in options A and B.

So perhaps the question is asking for the approximate value. Since the maximum is 2.08, but the options don't go that high, maybe the intended answer is 2.01, which is option A or B.

Looking back at the options, option B is 3.14/1.56. Let me compute that exact value.

3.14 divided by 1.56:

3.14 / 1.56 = approximately 2.01. So option B is also 2.01.

But the problem states that the SO3 content can be anywhere from 1% to 10%, meaning x can vary. But in the options, only 2.01 is present, but the question asks for the range. Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is A:2.01, considering the minimal SO3 content.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average x as (2 +3)/2=2.5, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Suppose the mixture is mostly SO2 with a small percentage of SO3. So the value of x would be slightly higher than 2, approaching 3 as SO3 increases.

In the 1% case, x is about 2.01, and 10% is 2.08. So the range is from approximately 2.01 to 2.08. Since none of the options provide a range, perhaps the intended answer is 2.01, which is option A or B.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects the x to be between 2 and 3, but that's not precise.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is treating the SOx as if it's a single oxide, and calculating x based on the average oxygen per sulfur, but based on mass.

Wait, the formula for SOx would have a molar mass of (32 +16x). If the mixture is mostly SO2 with some SO3, then the average molar mass would be between 64 (SO2) and 80 (SO3).

Wait, but the problem gives the percentage as SO3 by weight. So for a mixture that's 1% SO3, the average molar mass would be 0.01*80 +0.99*64 =0.8 +63.36=64.16 g/mol. The molar mass of SOx is 32 +16x =64.16 → 16x=32.16 →x≈2.01.

Similarly, for 10% SO3, the average molar mass is 0.1*80 +0.9*64=8 +57.6=65.6. So 32 +16x=65.6 →16x=33.6 →x=2.1.

So the x would range from 2.01 to 2.1. So the minimal x is 2.01, and maximal around 2.1. So the range is about 2.01 to 2.1.

But in the options, only 2.01 is present. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.01, which is option A or B.

Since the question asks for the approximate range, and the options only give single values, perhaps the intended answer is 2.01, so option A or B.

But looking at the options, both A and B are 2.01. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or B.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the SO3 is 1-10% by weight. So the x would vary, but the options don't have a range, only single values. So perhaps the intended answer is the lower bound, which is 2.01.

So the answer would be A: x=2.01.

But wait, option B is 3.14/1.56, which is approximately 2.01 as well. So both A and B evaluate to the same value. However, the options are labeled from A to J, so each is a unique choice.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Because 3.14 is pi and 1.56 is approximately pi/2. So 3.14/1.56 is about 2.01. So perhaps the intended answer is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the average of 2 and 3, which is 2.5, but that's not in the options.

I'm a bit confused, but based on my calculations, the x ranges from about 2.01 to 2.08. So the approximate value would be around 2.01 to 2.1. Since the options don't have a range, the closest option is A or B, both giving 2.01.

So I'm going to go with option A: x=2.01.

The question involves determining the approximate range for \( x \) in the formula \( \text{SO}_x \), where \( \text{SO}_x \) is a mixture of \( \text{SO}_2 \) and \( \text{SO}_3 \). The mixture contains 1% to 10% \( \text{SO}_3 \) by weight, with the rest being \( \text{SO}_2 \). The goal is to calculate the range of \( x \), which represents the average number of oxygen atoms per sulfur atom in the mixture.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding \( x \):**  
   \( x \) is the average number of oxygen atoms per sulfur atom in the mixture. For \( \text{SO}_2 \), \( x = 2 \), and for \( \text{SO}_3 \), \( x = 3 \). The value of \( x \) depends on the relative proportions of \( \text{SO}_2 \) and \( \text{SO}_3 \) in the mixture.

2. **Weight Percentages and Molar Masses:**  
   - The molar mass of \( \text{SO}_2 \) is \( 64 \, \text{g/mol} \), and the molar mass of \( \text{
