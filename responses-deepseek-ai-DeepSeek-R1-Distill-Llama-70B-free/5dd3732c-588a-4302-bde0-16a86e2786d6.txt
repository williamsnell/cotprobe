Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Edith Calder's earnings. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, Edith gets a weekly salary of $80. That's straightforward. But she also gets a 5% commission on her sales over $1,000. Oh right, so the commission isn't on all her sales, just the amount that's above $1,000. 

Last week, her sales were $1,354.20. I need to calculate her total earnings for the week, which includes her base salary plus the commission. 

First, let's break it down. Her base salary is $80. That part's easy. Now, the commission part. She gets 5% on the amount over $1,000. So I need to find out how much she sold over $1,000.

Her total sales are $1,354.20. Subtracting $1,000 from that gives me $354.20. That's the amount she made over the threshold. 

Now, calculating 5% of $354.20. To find 5%, I can multiply by 0.05. Let me do that: 354.20 * 0.05. Hmm, let's compute that. 354 times 0.05 is 17.7, and 0.20 times 0.05 is 0.01, so total is 17.71. 

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. Actually, 354.20 * 0.05 is calculated as 354.20 divided by 20, because 5% is 1/20. So 354.20 divided by 20. Let me do that division. 20 goes into 354 how many times? 20*17 is 340, so that leaves 14.20. 14.20 divided by 20 is 0.71. So 17 + 0.71 equals 17.71. So the commission is $17.71.

Wait, I think I did that right. So her commission is $17.71. 

Now, adding that to her base salary. $80 plus $17.71 equals $97.71. So her total earnings for the week should be $97.71.

Looking at the options, option I is $97.71. So that's the answer.

Edith Calder's earnings consist of a base salary of $80 plus a 5% commission on sales over $1,000. Her sales were $1,354.20, so the amount over $1,000 is $354.20. 

Calculating 5% of $354.20:  
$354.20 Ã— 0.05 = $17.71.  

Adding the commission to her base salary:  
$80 + $17.71 = $97.71.  

The correct answer is **I: $97.71**.
