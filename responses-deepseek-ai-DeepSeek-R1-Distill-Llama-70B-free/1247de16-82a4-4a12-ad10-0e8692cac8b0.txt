Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the volume when a region is rotated around the y-axis. Hmm, let me see. The region is bounded by y = x and y = x² in the first quadrant. I think I should start by visualizing this.

First quadrant means both x and y are positive. So, y = x is a straight line at 45 degrees, and y = x² is a parabola opening upwards. I remember that these two curves intersect where x = x². Let me solve that: x² - x = 0 → x(x-1) = 0, so x=0 and x=1. So the points of intersection are at (0,0) and (1,1). That makes sense.

Now, the region between them is the area where x² is below y = x because, for 0 < x <1, x² is less than x. So between x=0 and x=1, the curves form a sort of leaf shape in the first quadrant.

The question is about rotating this area around the y-axis. I think I need to use the method of cylindrical shells or the washer method. Wait, which one is better here? Since we're rotating around the y-axis, maybe the shell method would be easier because integrating with respect to x might be simpler.

Alternatively, if I use the washer method, I might have to express x in terms of y. Let me think about both approaches.

Using the shell method: The formula for the volume when rotating around the y-axis is 2π times the integral from a to b of x*(f(x) - g(x)) dx. Here, f(x) is the upper function, which is y = x, and g(x) is the lower function, y = x². So the height of each shell is (x - x²), and the circumference is 2πx.

So the integral would be from x=0 to x=1. So the volume V = 2π ∫ (x*(x - x²)) dx from 0 to1. Let me compute that.

Expanding the integrand: x*(x -x²) = x² - x³. So the integral becomes ∫ (x² - x³) dx from 0 to1. Integrating term by term:

Integral of x² is (x³)/3, and integral of x³ is (x⁴)/4. So evaluating from 0 to1:

At 1: (1/3) - (1/4) = (4/12 - 3/12) = 1/12. At 0, it's 0. So the integral is 1/12. Multiply by 2π: 2π*(1/12) = π/6.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Wait, the formula for the shell method is correct? The volume element is 2π * (radius) * (height) * dx. So yes, radius is x, height is (x - x²). So the setup is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should try the washer method to see if I get the same answer. With the washer method, we'd integrate with respect to y. We need to express x in terms of y for both curves.

For y = x, x = y. For y = x², x = sqrt(y). So for a given y, the outer radius is x = sqrt(y) (since when rotating around the y-axis, the outer function is the one farther from the axis, which is x = sqrt(y)), and the inner radius is x = y. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when rotating around the y-axis, the radius is the x-value. So for a washer at a particular y, the outer radius is the x from the curve farther from the y-axis, which in this case, between y= x and y =x², which one is bigger? Let me think.

Wait, the region is bounded by y =x and y=x². For a given y between 0 and 1, the x values go from sqrt(y) (the parabola) up to y (the line). But wait, no, that can't be. Wait, when y is between 0 and 1, for each y, the x on the parabola is x = sqrt(y), which is larger than x = y, because sqrt(y) > y in that interval (since y <1, sqrt(y) is bigger, e.g., y=0.25, sqrt(y)=0.5>0.25).

Wait, no. Wait, for a given y, say y=0.5, the x from the line y=x is x=0.5, and from the parabola y=x², x would be sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707. So the parabola is to the right (higher x) than the line. So when using the washer method, the outer radius is x = sqrt(y), and the inner radius is x = y. Is that right? Because when you rotate around the y-axis, the radius is x, so the outer radius is the larger x, which is sqrt(y), and the inner is y.

So the area of the washer is π( (sqrt(y))² - (y)^2 ) = π( y - y² ). Then integrate this from y=0 to y=1.

So the volume V = π ∫ (y - y²) dy from 0 to1.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of y is (y²)/2, and the integral of y² is (y³)/3.

So evaluating from 0 to1: [ (1/2) - (1/3) ) ] - [0] = (3/6 - 2/6) = 1/6. Multiply by π: π*(1/6) = π/6.

So same answer as the shell method. So that's reassuring.

So the volume is π/6. Looking at the options, J is π/6.

To find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by \( y = x \) and \( y = x^2 \) in the first quadrant about the \( y \)-axis, we can use either the **shell method** or the **washer method**. Both approaches yield the same result.

### 1. **Shell Method**
The formula for the volume using the shell method is:
\[
V = 2\pi \int_{a}^{b} x \cdot [f(x) - g(x)] \, dx
\]
Here:
- \( f(x) = x \) (the upper function),
- \( g(x) = x^2 \) (the lower function),
- \( a = 0 \), \( b = 1 \).

The height of each shell is \( f(x) - g(x) = x - x^2 \), and the radius is \( x \). Substituting these into the formula:
\[
V = 2\pi \int_{0}^{1} x \cdot (x - x^2) \, dx = 2\pi \int_{0}^{1} (x^2 - x^3) \, dx
\]
Expanding the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (x^2 - x^3) \, dx = \int_{0}^{1} x^2 \, dx - \int_{0}^{1} x^3 \, dx
\]
\[
= \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{1} - \left[ \frac{x^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}
\]
Thus:
\[
V = 2\pi \cdot \frac{1}{12} = \frac{\pi}{6}
\]

### 2. **Washer Method**
The formula for the volume using the washer method is:
\[
V = \pi \int_{c}^{d} \left[ R(y)^2 - r(y)^2 \right] \, dy
\]
Here:
- \( R(y) = \sqrt{y} \) (the outer radius, from \( y = x^2 \)),
- \( r(y) = y \) (the inner radius, from \( y = x \)),
- \( c = 0 \), \( d = 1 \).

The area of the washer is:
\[
\pi \left[ (\sqrt{y})^2 - y^2 \right] = \pi (y - y^2)
\]
Substituting into the formula:
\[
V = \pi \int_{0}^{1} (y - y^2) \, dy
\]
Expanding the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{1} (y - y^2) \, dy = \int_{0}^{1} y \, dy - \int_{0}^{1} y^2 \, dy
\]
\[
= \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{1} - \left[ \frac{y^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{6}
\]
Thus:
\[
V = \pi \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{\pi}{6}
\]

### Final Answer
Both methods confirm that the volume of the solid is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \). Therefore, the correct option is:

**J: \( \frac{\pi}{6} \)**
