Okay, so I've got this question about Mill and his views on how to decide how to act. Hmm, I remember that Mill was a utilitarian, right? So utilitarianism is all about the consequences of actions. The main idea is that an action is right if it promotes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. 

The question is asking about Mill's claim on deciding how to act. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option.

Option A says consult tradition. I don't think that's right because Mill was more about looking forward and using reason rather than just following tradition. So probably not A.

Option B is always follow personal instincts. That doesn't sound like Mill either. I think he emphasized reason and calculation over instinct.

Option C suggests depending on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility. Wait, Mill did talk about secondary principles or rules. He believed that over time, we can develop rules that are generally useful, but they shouldn't be followed blindly. Instead, they should be based on the principle of utility. So C might be a contender.

Option D is acting based on personal values regardless of consequences. That doesn't fit because utilitarianism is all about consequences.

Option E is doing what's legally required. I don't recall Mill saying that. Laws can be wrong, so he probably wouldn't advocate for always following them.

Option F says act to benefit the most people, regardless of consequences. Wait, that sounds a bit off. Utilitarianism is about consequences, but this option says regardless of consequences, which seems contradictory. Maybe F is incorrect.

Option G is doing what peers or society expects. That doesn't align with Mill's emphasis on individuality and critical thinking.

Option H says calculate the expected consequences. Oh, right, because Mill's utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness, which would require considering the consequences of each action. So H sounds right.

Option I is about immediate happiness. That's more like the Epicurean approach, but Mill's version of utilitarianism considers long-term consequences, not just immediate pleasure.

Option J is consulting scripture, which doesn't fit with Mill's secular and reason-based philosophy.

So now I'm a bit confused between C and H. Option C is about rules of thumb based on utility, while H is about calculating consequences each time. From what I remember, Mill argued for considering the actual consequences in each situation rather than just following rules. He thought that as society progresses, people would use their reasoning to apply the principle of utility directly. So maybe C is about rules, but H is about the actual calculation.

Wait, the question is about deciding how to act. Mill says in Utilitarianism that the principle of utility is the foundation, and when deciding, we should look at the actual consequences. So the correct approach is to calculate the expected consequences (H), rather than relying on rules (C), even if those rules are derived from utility. Because Mill emphasizes the importance of considering each case on its merits, especially as people's moral reasoning improves.

So the answer should be H: we should always calculate the expected consequences of our action.

The correct answer is H: we should always calculate the expected consequences of our action.

Mill's utilitarianism emphasizes that decisions should be based on the principle of utility, which involves maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering. While Mill acknowledges the practical use of rules of thumb derived from utility, he argues that these should not be followed blindly. Instead, individuals should engage in rational calculation of the expected consequences of their actions to determine the right course. This aligns with his belief in applying the principle of utility directly, especially as individuals and society progress in moral reasoning.

Answer: H
