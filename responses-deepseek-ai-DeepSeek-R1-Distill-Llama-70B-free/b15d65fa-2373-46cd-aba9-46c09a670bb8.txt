Alright, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. It says to express 6,400,000 divided by 400 in scientific notation. Hmm, okay, I remember that scientific notation is a way to write really big or really small numbers more manageable. It's usually in the form of a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by 10 raised to some power.

Wait, but first I should probably compute the division part. Let's see, 6,400,000 divided by 400. I'm a bit rusty on division, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me write it out step by step.

6,400,000 ÷ 400. Alternatively, I can think of this as 6,400,000 ÷ 400. Maybe I can cancel zeros to make it easier. Both numbers have three zeros at the end. So, 6,400,000 has six zeros, and 400 has two zeros. Wait, no, 400 is 4 followed by two zeros, so that's three digits, but 6,400,000 is seven digits.

Wait, perhaps I can divide both numerator and denominator by 100 first. So 6,400,000 ÷ 100 is 64,000, and 400 ÷ 100 is 4. So now it's 64,000 ÷ 4. That's easier. 

64,000 divided by 4. Let's compute that. 4 goes into 6 once with 2 remainder. 4 into 24 is 6. So 16,000? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 4 into 64 is 16, right? So 64,000 ÷ 4 is 16,000. Because 4 times 16,000 is 64,000. So the result of the division is 16,000.

Wait wait, no, no, that can't be right. Because 400 times 16,000 is 6,400,000, yes. So 6,400,000 divided by 400 is indeed 16,000. Okay, so now I have to express 16,000 in scientific notation.

Scientific notation, right. So I need to write it as a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by 10 to the power of something. So 16,000 is the same as 1.6 times 10,000, because 1.6 multiplied by 10,000 equals 16,000. 

Wait, 10,000 is 10^4. So 1.6 times 10^4. But wait, let me double-check that. 1.6 × 10^4 is 16,000, which matches. So the scientific notation is 1.6 × 10^4.

Wait, but looking at the options provided, let me check the options again. The options are A through J. Let's see.

Option A: 6.4 ×10^4 — that's 64,000, which is bigger than 16,000, so no.

Option B: 4 ×10^4 — that's 40,000, still bigger.

Option C: 6.4 ×10^3 — that's 6,400.

Option D:4×10^6 — 4 million, way too big.

Option E:1.6 ×10^5 — 160,000, which is ten times larger than what I have.

Option F:1.6 ×10^6 — 1,600,000, no.

Option G:4 ×10^5 — 400,000.

Option H:1.6 ×10^3 — 1,600.

Option I:1.6 ×10^4 — that's 16,000, which matches what I have.

Option J:6.4 ×10^5 — 640,000.

So the correct answer should be option I: 1.6 ×10^4.

To solve the problem of expressing \( \frac{6,400,000}{400} \) in scientific notation:

1. **Perform the division**:  
   \( 6,400,000 \div 400 = 16,000 \).

2. **Convert 16,000 to scientific notation**:  
   Scientific notation requires a number between 1 and 10 multiplied by a power of 10.  
   \( 16,000 = 1.6 \times 10^4 \).

3. **Match with the options**:  
   The result \( 1.6 \times 10^4 \) corresponds to **Option I**.
