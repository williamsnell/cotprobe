Question:

A train pulled into a busy station. Some passengers got off the train, and others got on. A few moments later, a train conductor shouted, "All aboard!" to indicate that the train was about to depart the station. At that moment, a man, carrying a large cardboard box, came running through the station toward the train "Wait for me!" he shouted as he ran toward the train. The man with the box reached the edge of the platform, next to the train, just as the train started to move. The man hesitated, unsure of whether he should give up or go ahead and jump onto the train even though it was moving. A railroad worker, who happened to be standing next to the train, decided to be helpful. He said, "You can make it," and gave the man a shove toward the open door of the train. The man stumbled and dropped the box that he was carrying. Instantly, the box made a loud screeching noise. The box contained powerful fireworks, and the impact of the box hitting the ground had caused a large rocket to ignite. The rocket flew out of the box and shot across the train station, glancing off the ceiling and finally crashing into a wall of a small coffee shop on the far side of the train station, about 150 feet from the train. The rocket's collision caused a shelf on the wall to fall. A large container of coffee that was on the shelf fell and hit a customer who was sitting in the shop and enjoying a cup of coffee. The coffee shop customer suffered an injury to her shoulder as a result of being hit by the container of coffee. If the coffee shop customer asserts a negligence claim against the railroad, which of the following elements of her claim will the plaintiff be unable to satisfy?

Options:

A: Assumption of risk.
B: Proximate or legal causation.
C: Negligence per se.
D: Breach.
E: Cause-in-fact.
F: Duty.
G: Contributory negligence.
H: Foreseeability.
I: Vicarious liability.
J: Comparative negligence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this negligence question. Let me start by recalling what negligence requires. I remember that negligence has four elements: duty, breach, causation (both actual and proximate), and damages. So the plaintiff must prove all four to win the case.

The question is about a scenario where a woman in a coffee shop is injured by a falling coffee container. The injury happened because a rocket from a box hit the shop. The rocket was set off when the man carrying the box was shoved by a railroad worker, causing him to drop the box. The box contained fireworks, and the impact ignited a rocket.

The plaintiff is suing the railroad, so I need to figure out which element she can't satisfy. The options are various legal terms related to negligence.

First, duty: The railroad has a duty to its passengers and people in the vicinity to operate safely. So duty is likely met, so F is not the answer.

Breach: The railroad worker shoved the man, which might be considered a breach of duty. If the worker acted negligently, that's a breach. So D might be an issue, but I'm not sure yet.

Causation: This is tricky. There are two typesâ€”cause-in-fact and proximate (legal) causation. Cause-in-fact is whether the action was a direct cause. Here, the worker's shove led to the box dropping, which led to the rocket, which hit the coffee shop, causing the container to fall and injure the woman. So cause-in-fact seems established. So E is probably not the issue.

Proximate causation involves foreseeability. The question is whether a reasonable person could have foreseen this chain of events. The worker might not have expected the box to contain fireworks, or that dropping it would cause a rocket to ignite and travel 150 feet into a coffee shop. So maybe the chain of events is too remote. If that's the case, proximate causation fails.

Negligence per se (C) is when a law is violated, and that's considered negligence. I don't know if any specific law was broken here, so maybe not relevant. But if the worker violated a safety regulation, maybe. But the question is about what the plaintiff can't satisfy, so if it's not applicable, C might not be the right answer either.

Assumption of risk (A) is when the plaintiff knowingly took a risk. The woman in the coffee shop didn't do anything like that, so A is out.

Contributory negligence (G) and comparative negligence (J) are defenses where the plaintiff's own actions contributed. But here, the plaintiff was just a bystander, so these don't apply. So G and J are not the answers.

Vicarious liability (I) applies when an employer is liable for an employee's actions. The railroad would be vicariously liable for the worker's negligence, assuming he was acting within the scope of employment. So I is probably not the issue.

Foreseeability (H) is part of proximate causation. If the worker couldn't have reasonably foreseen the exact harm, then proximate causation fails. So the issue is whether the harm was foreseeable.

So the elements are: duty, breach, causation (both types), and damages. The plaintiff can show duty, breach, cause-in-fact, and damages. The problem is proximate causation because the events might be too remote. So the element she can't satisfy is proximate or legal causation, which is option B.

Wait, but option H is foreseeability, which is a part of proximate causation. So the question is whether the correct answer is B or H. The question asks which element she can't satisfy. Proximate causation requires that the harm was foreseeable. If the court decides that it wasn't foreseeable, then proximate causation fails. So the element she can't satisfy is B: Proximate or legal causation.

So looking back at the options, the answer should be B.

The question revolves around a negligence claim where the plaintiff, a coffee shop customer, was injured due to a chain of events initiated by a railroad worker's actions. To succeed in a negligence claim, the plaintiff must establish four elements: duty, breach, causation (both cause-in-fact and proximate), and damages. 

1. **Duty (F):** The railroad owed a duty of care to individuals in the vicinity, including the plaintiff. This element is satisfied, so F is not the correct answer.  
2. **Breach (D):** The railroad worker's decision to shove the man carrying the box could constitute a breach of duty. This element is likely satisfied, so D is not the correct answer.  
3. **Cause-in-Fact (E):** The chain of events leading to the plaintiff's injury can be traced back to the worker's shove. This element is satisfied, so E is not the correct answer.  
4. **Proximate Causation (B):** This element requires that the harm was foreseeable. The worker might not have reasonably foreseen that shoving the man would lead to the box igniting fireworks, which would then travel 150 feet and cause an injury in a coffee shop. If the court deems this chain of events too remote, proximate causation fails.  
5. **Negligence Per Se (C):** This applies when a law is violated, but no specific law is indicated here. Thus, C is not the correct answer.  
6. **Assumption of Risk (A):** The plaintiff did not knowingly take any risk, so A is not applicable.  
7. **Contributory Negligence (G) and Comparative Negligence (J):** These defenses involve the plaintiff's own actions contributing to the harm, which is not the case here. Thus, G and J are not correct.  
8. **Vicarious Liability (I):** The railroad would likely be liable for the worker's actions under vicarious liability, so I is not the correct answer.  
9. **Foreseeability (H):** While foreseeability is part of proximate causation, the question specifically asks about the element the plaintiff cannot satisfy. The broader issue lies in proximate causation, making B the correct answer.

The plaintiff's claim fails due to the inability to establish proximate causation, as the harm was likely deemed unforeseeable. 

Answer: B
