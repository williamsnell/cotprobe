Okay, so I have this question about how many states in the international system are likely to have nuclear weapons right now. The options are from A to J, each with different numbers. I need to figure out the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that nuclear weapons are a big deal in international relations. Only certain countries have them. I think the number isn't too high because not every country can develop nuclear weapons. Let me think about which countries I know have nuclear weapons.

First, the big ones come to mind. The United States and Russia definitely have a lot. Then there's China, France, and the United Kingdom. So that's five so far. I also remember that India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons. Oh wait, and North Korea, even though it's a bit controversial. So that adds three more, making it eight.

Wait, what about Israel? I think they have nuclear weapons too, but they don't officially confirm it. So including Israel, that's nine. Are there any others? I don't think so. Maybe some other countries have programs, but I don't think they've successfully developed weapons yet.

So putting that together, the count is probably around eight or nine. Let me check the options. Option H is between 8 and 15, which would include nine. But wait, are there any other countries I might be missing?

I think South Africa had nuclear weapons before but dismantled them. So they don't count anymore. Other countries like Iran are trying, but I don't think they have them yet. So yeah, it's likely around nine.

Looking back at the options, H is between 8 and 15. But wait, another thought: the exact number is about nine, so H includes 8-15. But maybe the exact count is nine. Wait, let me recount:

1. USA
2. Russia
3. China
4. France
5. UK
6. India
7. Pakistan
8. North Korea
9. Israel

Yes, that's nine. So the number is 9, which falls into option H (8-15). But wait, another thought: sometimes the count is around 8 or 9. Some sources might not include North Korea or Israel, but most do. So the answer should be H.

Another angle: the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) recognizes five nuclear-weapon states: USA, Russia, China, France, UK. Then, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are non-NPT members who have nuclear weapons. Israel is also a non-NPT state with nuclear capabilities. So that's 5 + 4 = 9.

So the correct answer is H: Between 8 and 15.

The number of states with nuclear weapons is approximately nine, including the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel. This count places the number of nuclear-armed states between 8 and 15.

Answer: H
