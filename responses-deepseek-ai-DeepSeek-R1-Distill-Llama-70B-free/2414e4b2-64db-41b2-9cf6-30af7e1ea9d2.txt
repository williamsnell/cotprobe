Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume this question takes place in a "lien theory" state. A woman and her co-habiting partner share a property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.

Options:

A: No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.
B: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the property was jointly owned and one partner cannot unilaterally mortgage the property without the other's consent.
C: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the woman has the right of survivorship, which overrides the partner's debts.
D: Yes, the bank can execute on the mortgage because the partner's debt is considered a lien on the property, which overrides the joint tenancy.
E: Yes, the bank can execute on the mortgage because the partner used his interest in the property as collateral for the loan.
F: Yes, the bank can execute on the mortgage because the joint tenancy is considered severed when one partner incurs a debt without the knowledge of the other.
G: Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.
H: Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.
I: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.
J: No, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the majority view in a "lien theory" state is that a mortgage does not sever a joint tenancy.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about joint tenancy and mortgages in a lien theory state. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: a woman and her partner are joint tenants with the right of survivorship. That means when one dies, the other automatically gets the entire property without going through probate. So, if one dies, the other just owns it outright.

Now, the partner ran up debts without telling her. He used his interest in the property to get a mortgage from the bank secretly. So he must have taken out a loan using the property as collateral. But she didn't know about it.

Then he dies. The bank wants to execute on the mortgage, meaning they want to foreclose or take action to collect the debt. The question is, can they do that?

I remember that in joint tenancy, the key feature is the right of survivorship. But when one joint tenant mortgages their interest, what happens? I think it depends on whether the mortgage is considered to sever the joint tenancy.

In a lien theory state, a mortgage is treated as a lien against the property rather than transferring legal title to the lender. So, when the partner took the mortgage, he was using his interest as collateral, creating a lien on his share.

But here's the thing: in joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided interest. So when one takes a mortgage, it's only on their share. But does that affect the joint tenancy? I've heard that in some cases, a mortgage by one tenant can sever the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the case in a lien theory state.

Wait, I think in lien theory states, a mortgage by one joint tenant doesn't sever the joint tenancy. Instead, it just creates a lien on that tenant's interest. So when the partner dies, the woman still gets the entire property by survivorship, but the bank can only go after the decedent's share, which is now gone. Wait, no, because the bank had a lien on his interest. But if he dies, does that lien survive?

Wait, no. If the joint tenancy isn't severed, and the partner dies, the woman owns the whole property. But the bank's mortgage was only on his interest. But since he's dead, his interest effectively ceases to exist because of the right of survivorship. So does the bank lose out?

Alternatively, some sources say that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the tenancy, so the lien would only attach to the decedent's interest, which is extinguished upon death. Therefore, the bank can't enforce the mortgage against the entire property because the woman took it all.

Wait, but I've also read that in some jurisdictions, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, it doesn't affect the survivorship rights. So when the mortgaging tenant dies, the surviving tenant takes the property free of the mortgage because the mortgage was only on the deceased's interest, which is gone.

So in this case, the bank can't execute on the mortgage because the woman now owns the entire property, and the mortgage only attached to the partner's share, which no longer exists.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says the bank can't execute because the woman has survivorship rights overriding the debt. That sounds right based on what I thought.

Option I says the mortgage lien couldn't destroy the joint tenancy, so the property passes to the survivor. That also aligns with my conclusion.

Wait, but some might argue that the mortgagee (the bank) can still enforce the lien against the property. Hmm. I think the majority view is that a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the tenancy. So when the mortgagor dies, the survivor takes the property free of the mortgage because the lien was only on the deceased's interest, which is extinguished.

So looking at the answer choices again:

Option I: No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.

That seems correct.

Another option is J: No, the majority view in a lien theory state is that a mortgage does not sever a joint tenancy. So the bank can't execute because the mortgage didn't sever, and the survivorship means the bank's lien is on a defunct interest.

But wait, if the mortgage didn't sever, then the bank's lien is only on the share that's now gone. So the bank can't enforce against the entire property because the woman owns it all. So the answer would be either I or J.

I think the answer is J because it directly states that in a lien theory state, a mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, so the bank can't execute.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the mortgage doesn't sever the joint tenancy, then the partner's interest is still part of the joint tenancy. So when he dies, the woman gets it all. The bank's lien was on his interest, but since that interest is extinguished, the lien can't attach to anything. So the bank can't execute.

So option J says that the majority view is that the mortgage doesn't sever, so the bank can't execute. That would be correct.

Wait, but some sources indicate that in a lien theory state, a mortgage by one joint tenant is allowed without severing the tenancy, but upon the death of the mortgagor, the lien is extinguished because their interest has passed through survivorship. So the bank can't proceed against the property because the lien only applied to the deceased's interest.

So the correct answer would be that the bank cannot execute, because the mortgage didn't sever the tenancy, and the survivorship right takes precedence.

Looking at the options, option J says exactly that: No, because the majority view is that a mortgage doesn't sever a joint tenancy in a lien theory state.

Yes, so the answer is J.
</think>

In a "lien theory" state, a mortgage is treated as a lien against the property rather than a transfer of title. When a joint tenant mortgages their interest, the majority view is that this does not sever the joint tenancy. Instead, the mortgage creates a lien only on the mortgaging tenant's interest. Upon the death of the mortgaging tenant, the surviving joint tenant takes the entire property by operation of the right of survivorship. Since the mortgage was only on the deceased tenant's interest, which is extinguished upon death, the lien cannot attach to the surviving tenant's interest. Therefore, the bank cannot execute on the mortgage because the majority view in a lien theory state holds that a mortgage does not sever a joint tenancy.
