Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about translating a sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "David teaches Chris." They've given me the symbols: c stands for Chris, d for David, and Txy means x teaches y. The options are from A to J, each with different combinations of these symbols.

Alright, so I need to break this down. Let's start by understanding what each symbol represents. Txy is a predicate where x is the teacher and y is the student. So, Txy translates to "x teaches y." That makes sense. So in our case, we need to represent "David teaches Chris."

Now, the subject of the sentence is David, and the object is Chris. So in terms of Txy, x should be David, and y should be Chris. So substituting the variables, x is d (since d is David) and y is c (since c is Chris). So putting it together, it should be Tdc, right? Because T followed by d and then c.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me look at the options to see if Tdc is one of them. Option A is Tdc. So that's probably the correct one. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes these logic problems can be tricky with the order.

Another way to think about it is: the predicate T takes two arguments, the teacher first and the student second. So the first argument after T is the teacher, which is David (d), and the second is the student, Chris (c). So T followed by d and c, making Tdc. Yep, that's definitely option A.

I don't think I'm mixing up the order here. Let me just visualize it: T (d, c) would mean d teaches c, which is exactly the statement given. So yeah, option A should be correct.

Wait a second, though. Let me check the other options to make sure none of them fit better. Option B is Tcc, which would mean Chris teaches Chris. That doesn't make sense. Option C is cTd, which is like c T d. But predicates usually go in the order of the arguments, so T should come first. Option D is cTc, which again is Chris teaching himself. No. Option E is dTdc, which seems like more than two arguments; maybe that's a different structure. Option F is dTc, which is only two symbols, but the predicate T takes two variables, so maybe that's not right. Or is it? Wait, T is a two-place predicate, so it should have two variables after it. So option F has d followed by T and then c, which might actually be the same as Tdc but written differently. Wait, no, in logic, the standard form is the predicate followed by the arguments in parentheses. But in these options, they're written without parentheses, so the order matters. So Tdc would be correct, and dTc would be different because the order is switched. So F is dTc, which would mean c teaches d, right? Because the first argument is d, so that would be the teacher, and c is the student. So F would mean David teaches Chris? Wait, no, wait. Hold on, no. Wait, in Txy, x is the teacher, y is the student. So in dTc, if it's written as dTc, that would be T(d,c), which is the same as Tdc. Or is it? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think the correct way is that the predicate T comes first, followed by its arguments. So Tdc is the correct way. But if someone writes dTc, that might not be standard. So perhaps the correct option is A, Tdc. Because in logic, the predicate is written first, then the arguments in order. So the correct translation should have T followed by d and c, making Tdc, which is option A.

So to sum it up, the correct answer is A.

The question asks to translate "David teaches Chris" into predicate logic using the given symbols: c (Chris), d (David), and Txy (x teaches y). The predicate Txy means "x teaches y," so the teacher (David) is represented by d, and the student (Chris) by c. Therefore, the correct translation is Tdc, where T is followed by d (David) and c (Chris). 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Tdc** correctly represents "David teaches Chris."
- **B: Tcc** incorrectly suggests Chris teaches himself.
- **C: cTd** and **D: cTc** misplace the predicate and arguments.
- **E: dTdc** and **I: dTcd** use incorrect structures with too many arguments.
- **F: dTc** might imply the reverse (Chris teaches David) if not properly structured.
- **G: Tcd**, **H: Tdd**, and **J: cTdd** are incorrect as they misrepresent the teacher-student relationship.

Thus, the correct translation is **Tdc**, corresponding to option A.
