Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with equilibrium problems. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that 0.1 moles of Cu(NO3)2 are added to 1.0 moles of NH3, and then the solution is diluted to 1000 ml. I need to find the concentration of Cu²+ formed. The equilibrium constant K_eq is given as 8.5 × 10^-13.

Hmm, wait, I remember that Cu²+ reacts with NH3 to form a complex ion. Oh right, the reaction is something like Cu²+ + NH3 ⇌ [Cu(NH3)_n]^2+. But wait, what's the exact form of the complex? I think for copper, it's usually [Cu(NH3)4]²+. So the reaction would be:

Cu²+ + 4 NH3 ⇌ [Cu(NH3)4]²+

And the equilibrium expression for this would be K_eq = [ [Cu(NH3)4²+] ] / ( [Cu²+][NH3]^4 )

Wait, but in the problem, the K_eq given is 8.5e-13. Oh wait, wait, no, that K_eq might actually be the formation constant, which is the same as what I just wrote. So that's correct.

So the first thing I need to do is figure out the initial concentrations of Cu²+ and NH3 before the reaction. Then, use the equilibrium expression to find the concentration at equilibrium.

Wait, the solution is diluted to 1000 ml, which is 1 liter. So the total volume is 1 L.

The initial moles of Cu(NO3)2 are 0.1 moles. Since Cu(NO3)2 dissociates completely, it'll give 0.1 moles of Cu²+ and 0.2 moles of NO3^- per liter. So the initial concentration of Cu²+ is 0.1 M.

The initial moles of NH3 are 1.0 mole in 1 liter, so that's 1.0 M.

Now, the reaction will proceed where NH3 binds with Cu²+ to form the complex. Let me set up an ICE table.

Let's let x be the amount of Cu²+ that reacts. So:

Initial:
[Cu²+] = 0.1 M
[NH3] = 1.0 M
[Complex] = 0

Change:
[Cu²+] decreases by x: 0.1 - x
[NH3] decreases by 4x: 1.0 - 4x
[Complex] increases by x: x

At equilibrium:
[Cu²+] = 0.1 - x
[NH3] = 1.0 - 4x
[Complex] = x

The K_eq is 8.5e-13, which is a very small number. That suggests that the reaction doesn't proceed much, so x is going to be very small. Maybe I can approximate that 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 and 1.0 - 4x ≈ 1.0. That would simplify things a lot.

So substituting into the K_eq expression:

K_eq = (x) / ( (0.1)(1.0)^4 ) = 8.5e-13

Wait, let me write that correctly. The K_eq is [Complex]/( [Cu²+][NH3]^4 ), which is x / ( (0.1)(1)^4 ) = x/(0.1) = 8.5e-13.

So solving for x:

x = 0.1 * 8.5e-13 = 8.5e-14.

So [Complex] is 8.5e-14 M, and [Cu²+] is approximately 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 M. But wait, that seems too high because K_eq is so small, so maybe the approximation holds.

Wait, but let me think again. Because K_eq is very small, x is indeed negligible compared to 0.1 and 1.0, so the approximation is valid. So the [Cu²+] at equilibrium is approximately 0.1 M. But wait, the options don't have 0.1 M as the answer except option I. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 8.5e-2
B:5e-2
C:1.0
D:8.5e-13
E:1.7e-13
F:0.05
G:3e-13
H:6.5e-13
I:0.1
J:2e-13

So option I is 0.1 M, which matches my initial approximation. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I miss something?

Wait another thought. Maybe the K given is not the formation constant but the dissociation constant. Because sometimes K can be presented as the reverse. Let me think: the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium for the formation of the complex from the ions. If the K given is Kf, then what I did is correct. But if K is the dissociation constant, then it's the reciprocal.

Wait, the problem says K_eq is 8.5e-13. I think in this context, K_eq refers to the formation of the complex, so Kf is 8.5e-13.

Wait, no, actually, the problem states that K_eq is given as 8.5e-13, and the question is about the concentration of Cu²+ formed. So I think my approach is correct.

Wait, but according to my calculation, [Cu²+] is approximately 0.1 M, which is option I. But let me think again. Because when you add excess ammonia, you might expect that most of the Cu²+ would form the complex. But wait, no, because the K_eq is very small, meaning that the complex doesn't form much. So only a tiny amount of Cu²+ reacts, leaving most as free Cu²+.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the dissociation of the complex. Wait, perhaps I got the reaction backward. Let me clarify.

Wait, the reaction is Cu²+ + 4NH3 ⇌ [Cu(NH3)4]^2+. So K_eq is the formation constant, Kf. So if Kf is small, the formation of the complex is not favored, so Cu²+ remains mostly uncomplexed.

So the initial approximation that x is negligible is correct, so [Cu²+] ≈ 0.1 M, which is option I.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says that 0.1 moles of Cu(NO3)2 are added to 1.0 mole of NH3, which is 4 times more than needed for the 4:1 ratio. Because 0.1 mole of Cu²+ would require 0.4 moles of NH3 to form the complex. Since there's 1.0 mole of NH3, which is more than enough, the approximation holds.

So the answer should be 0.1 M, which is option I. But wait, looking at the options, option I is 0.1 M. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the ICE table. Let me check again.

Wait, the reaction is:

Cu²+ + 4 NH3 → [Cu(NH3)4]^2+

So for every mole of complex formed, one mole of Cu²+ is consumed, and four moles of NH3 are consumed.

So the ICE table is correct. The change is -x for Cu²+, -4x for NH3, and +x for the complex.

Then K_eq = [complex]/([Cu²+][NH3]^4) = (x) / ( (0.1 - x)(1 - 4x)^4 )

But since x is very small, 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 and 1 -4x ≈1, so K_eq ≈ x/(0.1 * 1) )= x / 0.1 = 8.5e-13.

So x = 8.5e-13 * 0.1 = 8.5e-14.

So [Cu²+] is 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1 M.

Therefore, the concentration of Cu²+ is approximately 0.1 M. So option I is correct.

Wait, but the options have option E as 1.7e-13, which is way smaller. Did I make a mistake? Maybe I should think again.

Wait, perhaps the K_eq given is the overall equilibrium for the dissociation, but perhaps I mixed up the direction.

Wait, another possibility is that the problem is considering the hydrolysis of the complex. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written as the dissociation of the complex into Cu²+ and NH3.

Wait, no, in the problem, the Cu(NO3)2 is added to excess NH3, so the complex should form, not dissociate.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the dissociation of the complex, but that doesn't fit the given K_eq.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose that the complex is formed, and the K_eq is the formation constant, which is small, so not much complex forms. So the initial Cu²+ remains at 0.1 M, but maybe a small amount forms the complex. So the free Cu²+ is 0.1 M.

Wait, but then why is option D present as 8.5e-13? Because that's the K_eq, but that's the formation constant. So perhaps the concentration of the complex is K_eq times [Cu²+][NH3]^4.

Wait, let me think in terms of the reverse reaction. If the complex is unstable (small Kf), then most of the Cu²+ stays as Cu²+. So the [Cu²+] is approximately 0.1 M.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the approximation that the concentration of free NH3 is very high, so I can consider it as a constant.

Let me denote the concentration of free Cu²+ as 's'. Then, the formation of the complex is:

s + 4 NH3 → complex.

The equilibrium expression is Kf = [complex]/(s * [NH3]^4 ) = 8.5e-13.

But since [NH3] is 1.0 M (approx), this simplifies to [complex] = Kf * s * (1)^4 = 8.5e-13 * s.

The total concentration of Cu is the sum of free Cu²+ and the complex:

Total Cu = s + [complex] = s + 8.5e-13 * s ≈ s (since 8.5e-13 is negligible).

The initial moles of Cu(NO3)2 are 0.1 moles in 1 L, so initial [Cu²+] is 0.1 M. So s ≈ 0.1 M.

Wait, that circles back to the same conclusion.

So I think the correct answer is option I, 0.1 M.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium reaction:

\[
\text{Cu}^{2+} + 4 \text{NH}_3 \leftrightharpoons [\text{Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4]^{2+}
\]

The equilibrium constant is given as \( K_{\text{eq}} = 8.5 \times 10^{-13} \), which is very small, indicating that the formation of the complex is not favored. This suggests that the concentration of free \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\) will remain close to its initial value.

### Step 1: Initial concentrations
- The solution contains 0.1 moles of \(\text{Cu(NO}_3\text{)}_2\) in 1.0 L, so the initial concentration of \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\) is:
  \[
  [\text{Cu}^{2+}]_{\text{initial}} = 0.1 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- The solution also contains 1.0 mole of \(\text{NH}_3\) in 1.0 L, so the initial concentration of \(\text{NH}_3\) is:
  \[
  [\text{NH}_3]_{\text{initial}} = 1.0 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Equilibrium expression
At equilibrium, let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\) that reacts to form the complex. The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{Cu}^{2+}] = 0.1 - x\),
- \([\text{NH}_3] = 1.0 - 4x\),
- \([\text{[Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4]^{2+}] = x\).

The equilibrium constant expression is:
\[
K_{\text{eq}} = \frac{[\text{[Cu(NH}_3\text{)}_4]^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}][\text{NH}_3]^4}.
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:
\[
K_{\text{eq}} = \frac{x}{(0.1 - x)(1.0 - 4x)^4}.
\]

### Step 3: Approximation
Since \( K_{\text{eq}} \) is very small (\( 8.5 \times 10^{-13} \)), the reaction does not proceed significantly, meaning \( x \) is negligible compared to the initial concentrations. Thus, we approximate:
\[
0.1 - x \approx 0.1, \quad 1.0 - 4x \approx 1.0.
\]

The equilibrium expression simplifies to:
\[
K_{\text{eq}} \approx \frac{x}{(0.1)(1.0)^4} = \frac{x}{0.1}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = K_{\text{eq}} \cdot 0.1 = (8.5 \times 10^{-13}) \cdot 0.1 = 8.5 \times 10^{-14}.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium concentration of \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\) is:
\[
[\text{Cu}^{2+}] = 0.1 - x \approx 0.1 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Final answer
The concentration of \(\text{Cu}^{2+}\) at equilibrium is approximately \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
