Okay, so I've got this question about time-division multiplexing (TDM) using Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). Hmm, I need to figure out how many voice signals can be multiplexed over a single communication channel. Let's break down the question step by step.

First, the question gives me some parameters. The minimum interval allowed for reliable bit identification is 1 microsecond (μs). That makes sense because in PCM, each bit must be held for a certain time to be detected properly. So if the bit interval is 1 μs, that's the time each bit takes to transmit.

Next, the allowable voice bandwidth is 3 kHz. I remember that the bandwidth of a signal relates to the sampling rate needed. Oh right, the Nyquist theorem says the sampling rate should be at least twice the bandwidth to avoid aliasing. So for 3 kHz, the sampling rate would be 2 * 3kHz = 6 kHz. Wait, but wait, 3kHz is the bandwidth, so the maximum frequency component is 3kHz. So the sampling rate is 2 times that, which is 6000 Hz. That means 6000 samples per second per voice channel.

But wait, each sample is quantized into a certain number of bits. The quantization level here is 16. Oh right, quantization levels determine how many bits each sample uses. 16 levels mean log2(16) = 4 bits per sample. So each voice sample is 4 bits.

So for each voice channel, the bit rate would be the sampling rate multiplied by the bits per sample. That's 6000 samples/sec * 4 bits/sample = 24,000 bits per second per voice channel.

Now, the TDM system needs to multiplex all these signals. The total data rate of the channel must be at least the sum of all the individual bit rates. But how do I find the total channel data rate?

Wait, I'm given the minimum bit interval, which is 1 μs. Bit interval is the time per bit, so the bit rate is 1 / interval. But wait, the interval is in microseconds. So 1 μs is 1e-6 seconds. So the bit rate is 1e6 bits per second (bps). Because 1 / 1e-6 s = 1e6 bps, which is 1 Mbps.

So the total channel capacity is 1e6 bps.

Now, each voice channel uses 24,000 bps. So the number of voice channels that can be multiplexed is total channel rate divided by each voice channel's rate.

Number of channels N = 1e6 / 24,000.

Let me calculate that. 1e6 / 24e3 = (1e6)/(24e3) = 1000000 / 24000 ≈ 41.666...

Wait, but that's approximately 41.666. But the options given are in whole numbers. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

1. Voice bandwidth: 3kHz. So sampling rate is 2 * 3kHz = 6kHz. Correct.

2. Quantization level 16: so 4 bits per sample. So each sample is 4 bits. So per second, 6000 samples, each 4 bits: 6000 *4= 24,000 bps per voice. That's right.

3. Bit interval is 1 μs, so the bit rate is 1e6 bps. Because 1 / 1e-6 s = 1e6 bps.

So total capacity is 1e6 bps.

Number of channels is 1e6 / 24e3 = 41.666... So approximately 41 or 42. But the options are all multiples of 5 or 10.

Wait, the options are A:45, B:90, C:80, etc. Hmm, 41 isn't among them. So maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the TDM frame includes other factors, like synchronization bits or guard times. But the question doesn't mention that. It's possible that the initial calculation is correct, but maybe I made a mistake in the assumptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1 μs is the time per bit, so the total bit rate is 1e6 bps. So each voice channel is 24e3 bps. So the number is 1e6 /24e3 = 41.666, which is about 41. Hmm.

But the options don't have 41. The closest is option A:45, but that's 3 higher. Did I miscalculate the sampling rate?

Wait, another thought. What if the 3kHz is the bandwidth, so the maximum frequency is 3kHz, but the sampling rate is twice that. So 6kHz. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total bits per frame. Let me think about the TDM system. Each frame has one sample from each voice channel. So the frame duration is 1 / (sampling rate), which is 1/6kHz = 1/6000 = 0.166666... milliseconds, which is 166.666 μs per frame.

Wait, but each frame has as many samples as the number of channels. So the time per frame is N * (time per sample). Each sample is 4 bits, but the frame is built by taking one sample from each channel. So each sample is 4 bits, but in terms of the time for the frame, it's the number of bits times the bit interval.

Wait no, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, the total data rate is 1e6 bps, and each voice channel requires 24e3 bps. So N = 1e6 /24e3 = 41.666. So 41 channels. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the bit interval is 1 μs, which is the time for each bit. So the total data rate is 1e6 bps. Each voice channel is 24e3 bps. So N =1e6 /24e3=41.666, which is about 41. Hmm.

But the options don't have 41. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the bit rate per voice channel.

Wait another approach: Let's think about the number of bits per second per voice channel. Each voice channel is sampled at 6kHz, each sample is 4 bits. So 6,000 *4 =24,000 bits per second. Correct.

So 24,000 bps per voice. So total number is 1e6 /24e3= approx 41.67. So 41.67. So 41 is the number, but the options don't have 41.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the sampling rate. Let me think again. The voice bandwidth is 3kHz, so the highest frequency is 3kHz. So the minimum sampling rate is 6kHz. So yes, 6,000 samples per second. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different definition. For example, sometimes the bandwidth is considered as double-sided (like in modems), but for voice, it's baseband, so 3kHz is the highest frequency. So 6kHz sampling rate. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe the issue is the way the TDM system works. Each frame in TDM must carry all the samples for each channel. So each frame consists of N samples, each 4 bits. So the number of bits per frame is 4*N. The frame time is the time to send all these bits.

Alternatively, the frame rate is the sampling rate. So the frame time is 1 / 6kHz= 1/6000 ≈ 0.166666 ms.

In that time, the system must transmit N *4 bits. Because each channel contributes one sample (4 bits) per frame.

So the total bits per frame is 4*N. The time per frame is 1/6000 seconds. The data rate would be (4*N) / (1/6000) )= 24,000 * N bits per second.

But the total data rate is 1e6 bps. So,

24,000 * N = 1e6

=> N = 1e6 /24e3 = 41.666...

Same result as before. So 41.67, so approximately 42 channels. But none of the options match.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are:

A:45

B:90

C:80

D:50

E:150

F:100

G:30

H:75

I:120

J:60

Hmm, 42 is closest to 45, but why? Or maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the 1 μs is the time per sample, not per bit. Wait no, that can't be. Because 1 μs per bit would make the bit rate 1e6 bps. But if it's per sample, that would be different.

Wait the question says "the minimum interval of 1 μs must be allowed for reliable identification of bits". So each bit must be held for 1 μs. So the bit rate is 1e6 bps.

So each bit takes 1 μs. So each sample is 4 bits, so each sample takes 4 μs.

So per voice channel, the sampling rate is 6kHz (6,000 samples per second). Each sample takes 4 μs, so each voice channel's bit rate is 6,000 *4 bits =24,000 bits per second, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the TDM system's total bit rate is 1e6 bps, so number of voice channels is 1e6 /24e3 = ~41.666.

So I'm getting 41 or 42, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Another thought: Maybe the system uses more than one bit per sample? No, no, 16 levels is 4 bits.

Wait, maybe the total data rate is calculated differently. Let me think: The total data rate is 1e6 bps. Each voice channel requires 24e3 bps. So 1e6 /24e3 = ~41.66. So 41 is the maximum. So the closest option is A:45, but that's higher than 41. Hmm. So perhaps the question expects us to approximate.

Wait, 1e6 is 1,000,000. Divided by 24,000 is 41.666... So approximately 41.67. But none of the options are near that except perhaps 45 is an option, but why would it be 45?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sampling rate. Let me double-check. If the voice bandwidth is 3kHz, then the sampling rate is 2 * 3kHz =6kHz. Correct. So 6,000 samples per second, each 4 bits, gives 24,000 bits per second.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the voice signal has an effective bandwidth of 4kHz, but that's not stated here.

Wait another possibility: Maybe the 1 μs is the frame time, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the total number of bits that can be sent in the time it takes to send a frame.

Wait, perhaps the way to calculate is as follows: Each bit takes 1 μs, so each sample (4 bits) takes 4 μs. So for each voice channel, the number of samples per second is 6,000. So each voice channel requires 6,000 *4 μs =24,000 μs per second, which is 24 milliseconds per second. That doesn't seem right because that's per channel. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the time per channel in the TDM system is N * (4 μs), where N is the number of channels. The total time per frame must be less than the sampling interval. Wait, the frame duration is 1/6kHz= ~0.166666 ms. So 0.166666 ms = 166.666 μs.

In that time, we need to send N*4 bits (since each channel contributes 4 bits per frame). Each bit takes 1 μs, so the total time per frame is N*4 *1 μs. Which must be <= 166.666 μs.

So N*4 <= 166.666 → N <= 41.666. So same as before. So N=41. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the total channel data rate as 1e6 bps, and each voice channel is 24e3 bps. So 1e6 /24e3=41.666. So 41 channels. But again, no option near that except A:45, which is 4 more.

Hmm. Maybe the question uses an approximate value for something. Let me re-examine the numbers.

Wait, 1e6 /24e3 is 41.666, which is about 41.67. But if I approximate 24e3 as 25e3, then 1e6/25e3=40. So 40 is even less. So that doesn't help.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the 1 μs is the time per sample, not per bit. Oh wait, that could change everything. Let me see.

If the minimum interval for a sample is 1 μs, then the sample rate would be 1e6 samples per second. But that's probably not correct because the sample rate is 6kHz as per earlier.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 1 μs is the time per bit. So each bit takes 1 μs, so 1e6 bits per second. So each voice channel is 24e3 bps. So 1e6 /24e3=41.666. So same result.

Wait, could the quantization level be different? The question says 16 levels, which is 4 bits. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the options provided don't include 42. So maybe the answer intended is option J:60. But wait, 60 would require 60 *24e3=1,440,000 bps, which exceeds 1e6. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the bit rate per voice channel. Let me think again. Each voice channel is sampled 6,000 times per second, each sample is 4 bits. So 6,000 *4=24,000 bits per second. Correct.

Wait, maybe the TDM system uses a different framing. For example, adding synchronization bits. But the question doesn't mention that, so perhaps it's not considered here.

Alternatively, perhaps the system uses a higher bit rate. Wait, maybe I should calculate the bit rate in a different way.

Wait, another approach: The minimum bit interval is 1 μs, so the maximum bit rate is 1e6 bps. Each voice channel has a bit rate of 24e3 bps. So number of channels is 1e6 /24e3 ≈ 41.666. So 41. So perhaps the closest option is A:45. But 45 is higher than 41.67. Or maybe the question expects rounding up.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the sampling rate is wrong. Maybe the sampling rate is higher. Oh wait, sometimes in PCM, they might use 8kHz as the standard sampling rate for telephone. But the question says the bandwidth is 3kHz, so the sampling rate should be 6kHz. But if someone mistakenly uses 8kHz, then the calculation would be different.

Wait, if I use 8kHz as the sampling rate, then the calculation would be 8,000 samples per second. So 8,000 *4=32,000 bits per second per voice channel. Then number of channels is 1e6 /32e3=31.25, which is about 31. Closest option is G:30, but that's not the case here since the question states 3kHz bandwidth, so 6kHz is correct.

Wait another thought: Is the 3kHz the bandwidth per channel or the total? No, the question says "the allowable voice bandwidth for telephone line transmission is 3kHz," which I think refers to each voice channel's bandwidth. So each voice channel is 3kHz, and the multiplexed system can handle multiple such channels.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3kHz is the total bandwidth of the communication channel. Oh wait, but the question says "the allowable voice bandwidth for telephone line transmission is 3kHz." So perhaps each voice signal has a bandwidth of up to 3kHz, so the multiplexed system will have a bandwidth much higher. But for TDM, the bandwidth is determined by the bit rate, which is 1e6 bps, which corresponds to a bandwidth of roughly 1e6 /2 = 500kHz (since bandwidth is about half the bit rate for binary signals). That's way higher than necessary, but perhaps that's not the factor here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total bandwidth required. Let's see, each voice channel is 3kHz. If we have N channels, the total bandwidth would be N *3kHz. But the TDM system's bandwidth is determined by the bit rate. The bit rate is 1e6 bps, which for binary signals, the bandwidth is about R/2, so 500kHz. So N*3kHz must be <=500kHz → N<=~166. But that's not considering the multiplexing efficiency, but that's a different approach and probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate based on the total time available per second for all channels. Let me think differently. Each voice channel requires 24,000 bits per second. The total channel can handle 1e6 bits per second. So N = 1e6 /24e3 ≈41.666. So 41. But since 41 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 45, which is option A. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate 1e6 /24e3. 24e3 is 24,000. 1e6 /24e3 = 1,000,000 /24,000 ≈41.666. So yes, 41.67.

Wait, perhaps the question intended the minimum interval as 2 μs? Then the bit rate would be 500,000 bps. Then N=500,000 /24,000 ≈20.83. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum interval is 2 μs per bit, leading to 500,000 bps. But the question states 1 μs, so that's not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the time-division multiplexing includes additional bits for framing or synchronization. For example, if each frame has some overhead bits. Let's say each frame has, say, 1
