Okay, so I've got this problem here about Rowena and Ruby painting a room. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

Rowena can paint a room in 14 hours. So her painting rate must be 1 room per 14 hours, right? That means in one hour, she paints 1/14 of the room. Similarly, Ruby can paint the same room in 6 hours, so her rate is 1/6 per hour. Got that down.

The problem says that if Rowena paints for x hours and Ruby paints for y hours, they finish half the painting. So the total work done is half the room. Then, if they switch the hours—Rowena paints y hours and Ruby paints x hours—they finish the whole room. So that's the full painting.

I think I can set up some equations based on their rates. Let's see.

First scenario: Rowena paints x hours, Ruby paints y hours. The work done is half a room. So the sum of their contributions is 1/2.

Rowena's contribution: (1/14) * x
Ruby's contribution: (1/6) * y
So, (x/14) + (y/6) = 1/2. Let me write that as equation (1).

Second scenario: Rowena paints y hours, Ruby paints x hours. Now the total work is 1 room.

Rowena's contribution here: (1/14) * y
Ruby's contribution: (1/6) * x
So, (y/14) + (x/6) = 1. That's equation (2).

Now I have two equations:

(1) x/14 + y/6 = 1/2

(2) y/14 + x/6 = 1

I need to solve this system of equations for x and y.

Hmm, let's try to rearrange both equations to make it easier. Maybe express them in terms of x and y.

Equation (1): Multiply both sides by 42 (the least common multiple of 14 and 6) to eliminate denominators.

42*(x/14) + 42*(y/6) = 42*(1/2)
Which simplifies to 3x + 7y = 21.

Equation (2): Similarly, multiply by 42.

42*(y/14) + 42*(x/6) = 42*1
Which simplifies to 3y + 7x = 42.

So now the system looks like:

3x + 7y = 21   ...(1a)

7x + 3y = 42    ...(2a)

Hmm, okay, I can solve this using substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.

Let me write them again:

(1a) 3x +7y =21

(2a)7x +3y=42

Maybe I can make the coefficients of one of the variables the same. Let's try to eliminate one variable.

If I multiply (1a) by 7 and (2a) by 3, the coefficients of x would be 21 and 21, so I can subtract.

Multiply (1a) by 7: 21x +49y = 147 ...(3)

Multiply (2a) by 3:21x +9y =126    ...(4)

Now subtract equation (4) from equation (3):

(21x +49y) - (21x +9y) =147 -126

21x -21x +49y -9y =21

Which is 40y =21

So y =21/40.

Wait, that's 21 over 40. Let me check my math.

Wait, 49y -9y is 40y. 147-126 is 21. So y=21/40.

Now plug this back into one of the equations to find x.

Let's use equation (1a):3x +7y=21.

Substitute y=21/40:

3x +7*(21/40) =21

3x + (147/40)=21

Convert 21 to 840/40 to have same denominator.

3x = 840/40 -147/40 = (840-147)/40 = 693/40

So x = (693/40)/(3) = (693)/(120) = Simplify this.

693 divided by 3 is 231, 120 divided by 3 is 40. So 231/40.

Wait, so x is 231/40 and y is21/40.

Let me check if these fit into equation (2a):7x +3y=42.

Compute 7x=7*(231/40)=1617/40

3y=3*(21/40)=63/40

Adding them: (1617+63)/40 =1680/40=42. Which is correct. So that's good.

So the solution is x=231/40, y=21/40.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches (231/40,21/40).

Looking at the options:

Option C is (21/40,231/40) which is swapped.

Option J is (231/40,21/40). Yes, that's x and y.

So the correct answer is J.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the painting rates of Rowena and Ruby. Rowena paints at a rate of \( \frac{1}{14} \) of the room per hour, and Ruby paints at a rate of \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the room per hour.

The problem provides two scenarios:

1. When Rowena paints for \( x \) hours and Ruby paints for \( y \) hours, they complete half the room. This gives the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{14} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

2. When Rowena paints for \( y \) hours and Ruby paints for \( x \) hours, they complete the entire room. This gives the equation:
   \[
   \frac{y}{14} + \frac{x}{6} = 1.
   \]

To eliminate the denominators, we multiply through by 42 (the least common multiple of 14 and 6):

1. \( 3x + 7y = 21 \).
2. \( 7x + 3y = 42 \).

We now solve this system of equations. First, we use the elimination method:

- Multiply the first equation by 7: \( 21x + 49y = 147 \).
- Multiply the second equation by 3: \( 21x + 9y = 126 \).

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[
(21x + 49y) - (21x + 9y) = 147 - 126,
\]
\[
40y = 21 \implies y = \frac{21}{40}.
\]

Substitute \( y = \frac{21}{40} \) into the first equation:
\[
3x + 7\left(\frac{21}{40}\right) = 21,
\]
\[
3x + \frac{147}{40} = 21.
\]

Convert 21 to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
\[
3x + \frac{147}{40} = \frac{840}{40}.
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
3x = \frac{840}{40} - \frac{147}{40} = \frac{693}{40},
\]
\[
x = \frac{693}{120} = \frac{231}{40}.
\]

Thus, the solution is \( x = \frac{231}{40} \) and \( y = \frac{21}{40} \).

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
\[
\left(\frac{231}{40}, \frac{21}{40}\right).
\]

This matches option **J**.
