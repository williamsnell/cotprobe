Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a rotating disk and torque. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my rotational dynamics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: If a disk is rotating at 1200 revolutions per minute, what torque is required to stop it in 3.0 minutes? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. I need to pick the right one.

Wait, torque is involved in changing the rotational motion. So I remember that torque (τ) is related to angular acceleration (α) through the formula τ = Iα, where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, I don't have the mass or size of the disk, so maybe I'm missing some information here. Or perhaps it's a standard formula without needing all that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about angular velocity and angular acceleration. Oh right, torque is also related to the change in angular momentum over time, so τ = dL/dt. Since L (angular momentum) is Iω, so τ = I (dω/dt) = Iα.

Wait, but without knowing the moment of inertia, I can't directly calculate the torque. So maybe I'm supposed to assume a standard value for I, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the question uses some typical unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me think again.

The disk is rotating at 1200 rev/min, and we need to find the torque to stop it in 3 minutes. So first, I should probably find the angular acceleration required to bring it to a stop.

Angular acceleration α is the change in angular velocity over time (Δω/Δt). Since it's stopping, the change in ω is from initial to zero.

But wait, the given time is 3.0 minutes. I need to convert that into seconds because standard units are usually in seconds.

Wait, but maybe the time is 3 minutes, which is 180 seconds. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, 3 minutes is 3 * 60 = 180 seconds. Right.

But wait, the initial angular velocity is given in revolutions per minute. I should convert that to radians per second because torque equations typically use SI units.

So 1200 rev/min. There are 2π radians in a revolution, so that's 1200 * 2π radians per minute. Now, per minute to per second, divide by 60.

So ω_initial = 1200 * 2π / 60 = (1200/60)*2π = 20 * 2π = 40π radians per second.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate that. 1200 rev/min = 1200 * 2π rad/min. To get per second, divide by 60. So 1200 * 2π /60 = (1200/60)*2π = 20 * 2π = 40π rad/s. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the final angular velocity ω_final is 0, since we're stopping it. The time Δt is 3 minutes, which is 180 seconds.

So the angular acceleration α is (0 - 40π) / 180 = -40π / 180 = -2π/9 rad/s². The negative sign indicates it's deceleration.

Now, torque τ is I * α. But wait, I don't know I, the moment of inertia. Hmm, this is a problem. Unless I'm supposed to assume a standard moment of inertia for a disk. Oh wait, I remember that for a solid disk rotating about its central axis, the moment of inertia is (1/2)MR². But without knowing M or R, I can't compute I.

Wait, perhaps the question is using some other approach, maybe involving standard values or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the torque is given per unit moment of inertia? That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to use angular momentum. Oh wait, angular momentum L = Iω. So the change in angular momentum is I (ω_final - ω_initial) = I (0 - 40π) = -40π I. The torque is the rate of change of angular momentum, so τ = ΔL/Δt = (-40π I) / 180.

But without knowing I, I can't compute the torque. So perhaps the question expects me to express the torque in terms of I, but the options are numerical. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the question is using lb-ft units, which are imperial. So perhaps it's using some conversion factors. Oh wait, the problem might have given the moment of inertia in slug-ft², but I don't see any information about mass or radius. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Maybe the problem is assuming a specific moment of inertia. Wait, but nothing in the question gives any clue about the size or mass of the disk. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is using a standard formula that I'm forgetting.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is about the angular acceleration and uses a formula that relates torque to the change in revs over time, without needing the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the question is a trick, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, maybe the torque can be found using τ = (Δω) / Δt * I, but without I, I can't find τ. So perhaps the question expects me to know I for a disk, but without more info, that's impossible. So maybe I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach. For example, using the work-energy principle, where the work done by torque equals the change in rotational kinetic energy.

But work done by torque is torque multiplied by angular displacement. The change in KE is (1/2)I ω². But again, without knowing I, I can't find torque. So that approach also seems stuck.

Wait, perhaps the time is 3 minutes, which is 180 seconds, and the initial angular velocity is 40π rad/s. The angular acceleration is -40π / 180 = -2π/9 rad/s². So torque is I * (-2π/9).

But without I, I can't get a numerical value. So maybe the question is missing some data, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the angular acceleration is uniform and using some other formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's a standard problem where I is assumed, but I don't recall such a standard value.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem gives the moment of inertia elsewhere, but in the provided question, it's not visible. So perhaps the question is incomplete, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the options and see if the numbers make sense. The options are all in negative values, which makes sense because the torque is in the opposite direction to stop the rotation.

Wait, I think I might be missing something here. Let's think about the units. Oh, the question is in lb-ft, which is torque in pound-feet. But in the SI system, torque is in Newton-meters. So perhaps the problem expects me to use imperial units.

Wait, but without I in slug-ft² units, I can't compute the torque. So perhaps the problem is expecting just the calculation of angular acceleration and then torque, but expressed per unit I, which doesn't fit the options.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with what I have and see if I can get an expression.

So τ = I * α = I * (-40π / 180) = I * (-2π/9) ≈ I * (-0.6981) lb-ft.

But none of the options match this unless I is given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial ω. Let me recalculate that.

1200 rev/min to rad/s: 1200 rev/min = 1200 * 2π rad/min = 2400π rad/min. To get per second, divide by 60: 2400π /60 = 40π rad/s. That's correct.

So α = (0 - 40π) / 180 = -40π/180 = -2π/9 ≈ -0.6981 rad/s².

So τ = I * (-0.6981). But without I, I can't get further. Unless perhaps the moment of inertia is 1 slug-ft², which would make τ ≈ -0.698 lb-ft, but that's not any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different unit conversion. Wait, 1 revolution is 2π radians, correct. So 1200 rev/min is 1200 * 2π rad/minute. Then, per second, divide by 60.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the time? The time is 3.0 minutes, which is 180 seconds, correct.

Wait, maybe the question uses minutes as the unit for time in the angular acceleration calculation. Oh wait, that would be wrong because angular acceleration is in rad/s².

Wait, let me think: if I mistakenly treated the time as minutes instead of converting to seconds, that would cause an error. Suppose someone forgets to convert 3 minutes to 180 seconds. Let's see what happens in that case.

If Δt is 3 minutes, treating it as 3 seconds (which is wrong), then α would be (0 - 40π) /3 = -40π/3 ≈ -41.8879 rad/s². Then τ = I * (-41.8879). But that's much larger than any of the options, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the time was mistakenly treated as seconds when it's actually minutes, leading to a smaller α.

Wait, but I think I'm really stuck here. Maybe the problem expects me to know that the torque is proportional to the change in angular velocity over time, but without I, it's impossible to find a numerical value. So perhaps the question is incomplete or I'm missing a key piece of information.

Wait, looking back at the question, perhaps it's a standard problem where I is taken as 1 unit, but that's not indicated. So maybe the torque is simply the change in angular velocity over time, but that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the torque is calculated using the formula τ = (P)(t), where P is power, but without knowing power, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using angular velocity in rev/min and time in minutes, but that's unconventional and probably incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula τ = (change in rev/min) * some factor. Let me think: 1200 rev/min to 0 in 3 minutes is a change of 1200 rev/min over 3 minutes, so the rate is 400 rev per minute per minute, but that's not a standard unit. Wait, no, that's 1200 rev/(3 min) = 400 rev/min². To convert that to rad/s², multiply by 2π rad/rev and divide by 60 s/min. So 400 rev/min² * 2π rad/rev / 60 s/min = (800π/60) rad/s² ≈ 41.8879 rad/s². But wait, that's positive, but since it's stopping, it's negative.

Wait, no, wait. The initial ω is 1200 rev/min, final is 0. So change is -1200 rev/min over 3 min. So the angular acceleration in rev/min² is -1200 /3 = -400 rev/min².

Converting that to rad/s²: each rev is 2π rad, and each min is 60 s. So 400 rev/min² = 400 * 2π rad / (60 s²) )= (800π)/60 ≈ 41.8879 rad/s².

So then, τ = I * α. If I is in slug-ft², but without I, I can't compute τ. So I'm back to square one.

Hmm, maybe the problem assumes a unit moment of inertia. For example, if I is 1 slug-ft², then τ is about -41.89 lb-ft. Looking at the options, the closest is option G: -45 lb-ft, but it's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate with I as 1, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects you to compute the angular acceleration in rev/min² and then use some conversion factor to torque without involving I. That doesn't make sense, but perhaps the formula used is τ (lb-ft) = (angular acceleration in rev/min²) * some constant.

Wait, maybe the formula is τ (lb-ft) = (Δrev/min) / Δt (min) * k, where k is a conversion factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to compute the angular acceleration in rev/min² and then multiply by a factor to get torque in lb-ft, but I'm not sure what that factor would be.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't have the moment of inertia. Maybe the problem expects me to assume that I is 1 slug-ft². Let's try that. So τ = I * α = 1 * (-2π/9) ≈ -0.698 lb-ft. But none of the options match that. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used different unit conversions. Let me think about the units involved.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to use the formula τ = (change in RPM) * (1/min) * conversion factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula τ = (angular acceleration in RPM per second) * some factor.

Wait, another approach: Let's think in terms of units. Torque in lb-ft is related to moment of inertia (in slug-ft²) multiplied by angular acceleration in rad/s².

So τ (lb-ft) = I (slug-ft²) * α (rad/s²).

But without I, I can't compute the torque. So I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually testing the understanding that to stop the rotation, the torque required is proportional to the initial angular velocity divided by the time. So τ ∝ ω / t.

Given that, let's compute ω over t.

ω is 40π rad/s. t is 180 s. So 40π / 180 = 2π/9 ≈ 0.698 rad/s².

But without I, τ can't be found. So I'm back to the same issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula τ = ΔL / Δt, where ΔL is the change in angular momentum. ΔL = I * Δω. So τ = I * (Δω / Δt) = I * α.

But again, without I, this is impossible.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again. They are all negative, and the magnitudes are in the 15-45 range. So perhaps I'm supposed to find the torque as being proportional to (1200 rev/min) / (3 min) * some factor.

Wait, 1200 /3 = 400 rev/min per minute. So 400 rev/min². Converting that to rad/s²: 400 rev/min² = 400 * 2π rad/(60 s²) =  (800 π)/60 ≈ 41.8879 rad/s².

If I then multiply by a moment of inertia I, but without I, I can't get torque. So perhaps I'm missing I, but in the problem statement, there's no info on I.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes I is 1, but that gives τ ≈ -41.89 lb-ft. The closest option is G: -45 lb-ft, but it's not exact. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 400 rev/min² is 400 * 2π/60 = 400 * π /30 ≈ 13.333 * π ≈ 41.8879 rad/s².

So I think the torque would be I multiplied by that. But I is missing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the disk has a radius of 1 ft, and mass of 1 slug, making I = (1/2) MR² = 0.5 * 1 * 1 = 0.5 slug-ft². Then τ = 0.5 * (-41.8879) ≈ -20.94 lb-ft. That would be closest to option E: -20 lb-ft.

But wait, why would the disk's I be 0.5? There's no information given about the disk's size or mass. So I'm making a lot of assumptions here, which isn't ideal.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that I is 1 lb-ft-s². Wait, no, moment of inertia units are slug-ft², and torque is lb-ft. So I is in slug-ft², and α in rad/s², so τ is (slug-ft²)(rad/s²) = slug-ft²/s². But 1 lb = 1 slug-ft/s², so τ = (slug-ft²/s²) )*(1 lb-ft/(slug-ft/s²)) )= lb-ft, which works out.

But without knowing I, I can't get the number. So perhaps the problem is missing data, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is only testing the relationship between angular velocity and torque, assuming time is in minutes and using some conversion factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the formula τ = (ω_initial * I) / t. Since τ is the rate of change of angular momentum, perhaps it's I*(ω/t). But without knowing I, that doesn't help.

Wait, unless I is given in the problem as part of the standard info, but I don't see it here. So I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the calculation and pick the closest option.

Wait, if I take the angular acceleration as -40π/180 = -2π/9 ≈ -0.698 rad/s². If I assume I is, say, 30 slug-ft², then τ = 30 * (-0.698) ≈ -20.94 lb-ft, which would correspond to option E: -20 lb-ft.

But why would I assume I is 30? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the problem expects the use of I = 1 slug-ft², leading to about -0.7 lb-ft, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the time was taken as 3 seconds instead of 180, which would make α = -40π/3 ≈ -41.8879 rad/s². Then, if I is, say, 1 slug-ft², torque is about -41.89 lb-ft. But the options don't have that. Closest is G: -45 lb-ft.

But I don't think that's correct because the time is definitely
