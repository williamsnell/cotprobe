Question:

A state trooper was convicted in federal court in 2008 of taking bribes. He was sentenced to probation. He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:"Section 8. Any member of the state law enforcement staff. . . who is convicted of. . . briberyshall not be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the stateSuch conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contractSection 12. The provisions of this Act shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975. Section 14. This Act shall take effect immediately. "Following the enactment of the statute, the state trooper received a letter from the state which stated that pursuant to the statute, the state is immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to you on account of your 2008 bribery conviction. "The trooper contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. Assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. The trooper might still be able to eventually have his pension reinstated if

Options:

A: he can prove that the bribe was unrelated to his duties as a state trooper.
B: he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of thestatute.
C: he can prove that the statute is being applied selectively and discriminately.
D: he can show that the discontinuance of benefits is a form of double jeopardy.
E: he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.
F: he can demonstrate that the statute unfairly targets retired law enforcement officials.
G: he can demonstrate that his conviction was overturned on appeal.
H: he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U. S. Supreme Court.
I: he can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a state trooper who was convicted of bribery and had his pension taken away because of a new statute. The question is about whether he can get his pension reinstated even if the state's highest court says the statute is constitutional. I need to figure out which option is the correct answer.

Let me start by breaking down the facts. The trooper was convicted in 2008, sentenced to probation, and had been a state trooper since 1978. He became fully qualified for his pension in 1998 and retired in 2006, starting to receive his pension right away. Then in 2009, a new law was enacted that says anyone in state law enforcement convicted of bribery can't receive any retirement benefits. The law is retroactive to 1975 and is effective immediately. The state then stopped his pension payments, and he's challenging it as unconstitutional, but the state court says it's okay.

The question is, under what grounds could he still get his pension back despite the law being upheld as constitutional.

The options are A through I, each presenting a different legal argument.

First, I need to understand the legal issues here. The main issue seems to be whether the state can retroactively revoke his pension. The statute is retroactive, applying to anyone convicted as far back as 1975, which includes this trooper's 2008 conviction. But since he started receiving his pension in 2006, before the law was passed, there's a question about whether the state can take away benefits that were already being received.

I remember that in the U.S., there's a concept called the Contract Clause, which is part of the Constitution. The Contract Clause (Article I, Section 10) prohibits states from passing laws that impair contractual obligations. So if the state had a contract with the trooper regarding his pension, and then later passed a law that changes that contract, that might be a problem under the Contract Clause.

But in this case, the state's highest court has already ruled the statute constitutional. So the trooper can't argue that the law is unconstitutional anymore. Therefore, he needs another angle.

Looking at the options, let's go one by one.

Option A: Prove the bribe was unrelated to his duties. I'm not sure how that would affect the pension. The statute seems to apply regardless of whether the bribery was related to his job. So maybe that's not a winning argument.

Option B: Show he was convicted before the effective date. The law is retroactive to 1975, so even if he was convicted later, it's still covered. Plus, the effective date is immediate, so the conviction in 2008 is within the retroactive period. So I don't think B helps.

Option C: Prove selective and discriminatory application. That's more of an equal protection argument. If the law is applied unfairly to him compared to others, that might be a issue. But the question states the law was upheld as constitutional, so perhaps the court didn't find it discriminatory. Unless he can show it's being applied in a way that's selectively targeting him, which is different from the law being constitutional on its face.

Option D: Discontinuance is double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is about being tried twice for the same offense. Here, the issue is the loss of pension, which is a civil penalty, not a criminal punishment. So I don't think double jeopardy applies here. The Supreme Court has held that certain civil penalties don't constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes, especially if they're intended to be remedial. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: Presidential pardon. If he gets a pardon, would that affect the conviction? A pardon usually wipes out the conviction, at least in terms of punishment. But does it nullify the conviction itself? I think a pardon doesn't expunge the conviction; it's more about forgiveness. However, some laws might tie benefits to a conviction, so if the conviction is pardoned, maybe the basis for denying the pension is gone. But I'm not sure if a presidential pardon would apply here because this is a state law, and a federal pardon wouldn't affect state convictions unless it's a federal conviction. Wait, in this case, the trooper was convicted in federal court. Oh, right! The question says he was convicted in federal court in 2008. So a presidential pardon would apply. If he receives a pardon, does that mean his conviction is no longer valid for the purposes of the state statute? Because the statute says any member convicted of bribery shall not receive benefits. If the conviction is pardoned, perhaps the legal basis for denying the pension is removed. So E could be a possibility.

Option F: Unfairly targets retired officials. That might be an equal protection argument, but again, the state court upheld the law as constitutional, so unless there's something specific about targeting retired people, which the law's retroactivity does, but the court already said it's okay. So F might not work.

Option G: Conviction overturned on appeal. Well, if his conviction is overturned, then there's no conviction, so the basis for stopping the pension is gone. But the question says he was convicted in 2008, and the state court upheld the statute. So if he successfully appeals and gets the conviction overturned, then yes, he could get his pension back. But the question is about what he might still do, so G is a possibility.

Option H: Exercise discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court. Well, if the state court has ruled, he could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the question says assume the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. So unless the Supreme Court would overrule that, but the option says he exercises his right, not that the Court would rule in his favor. So H might not be the answer because it's about the process, not the outcome.

Option I: Violates dormant commerce clause. The commerce clause is about interstate commerce. I don't see how a state pension law would affect interstate commerce, so I doubt I is the right answer.

So, narrowing down, the possible options are E, G, and maybe C.

Wait, the question is about what might still allow him to have his pension reinstated despite the law being upheld. So even if the law is constitutional, there might be other reasons.

If the trooper's conviction is overturned (G), then the basis for denying the pension is gone, so the state would have to reinstate it. That seems like a solid reason, regardless of the statute's constitutionality.

Alternatively, if he gets a pardon (E), does that negate the conviction? A presidential pardon for a federal conviction would mean that the conviction is forgiven, but does it erase it? Legally, a pardon doesn't expunge the record, but it does remove the legal consequences. So if the state law is based on having a conviction, and the pardon removes the legal effect of the conviction, then perhaps the state can't deny the pension anymore. But I'm not entirely sure how that works with state laws. Since the conviction was federal, and the pardon is federal, maybe the state would still consider the conviction valid for their purposes. Or maybe the pardon would cause the state to reverse the decision because the conviction is no longer a basis for the penalty.

Alternatively, if the conviction is overturned on appeal (G), then the conviction is vacated, so the state law's condition (being convicted) is no longer met. So G seems like a clear path.

But let's think again. In the scenario, the state court upheld the statute as constitutional. So if the trooper's conviction is overturned, then the state would have to stop applying the statute against him because there's no conviction anymore. So G would allow him to get his pension back.

Similarly, if he gets a pardon (E), the conviction is forgiven, but does that mean it's as if he was never convicted? I think a pardon doesn't erase the conviction, it just forgives the punishment. So the conviction would still exist, but the pardon might remove any penalties attached to it. But the state law is based on the conviction itself, not the punishment. So if the law says anyone convicted, regardless of punishment, then a pardon might not affect it. Unless the law is interpreted to require a conviction without pardon, but I think that's not the case. So maybe E wouldn't work because the conviction still stands, just pardoned.

Wait, but some laws might consider a pardon as grounds to restore rights or benefits. For example, in some states, a pardon allows restoration of certain rights, like voting or holding office. So perhaps the state's pension law would consider a pardon as removing the disqualification. But I'm not sure about that. It might depend on the specific wording of the statute. The statute here says "convicted of bribery," and if the pardon doesn't expunge the conviction, then the conviction still exists, so the state could still deny the pension. Unless the pardon is considered to nullify the conviction for the purposes of the law, but I think that's not the case.

So perhaps G is the better option because if the conviction is overturned, there's no conviction anymore, so the state can't apply the statute.

Wait, but the trooper was convicted in 2008, and the state law was enacted in 2009. If he appeals the conviction now, in the future, and it's overturned, then yes, the basis is gone. So G would allow him to get his pension back.

Alternatively, if he can prove that the statute is being applied selectively (C), that's an as-applied challenge. Even if the law is constitutional on its face, it could be unconstitutional as applied if it's applied in a way that's discriminatory. But I don't know if that's the case here. The question doesn't give any info suggesting selective application, so it's less likely.

So, putting it all together, the possible answers are E and G.

But considering that a pardon doesn't necessarily remove the conviction, only the punishment, whereas overturning the conviction would remove the basis for the statute's application, G seems more directly effective.

Wait, but the question states that the state's highest court has already upheld the statute as constitutional. So if the trooper's conviction is overturned, he can argue that without a conviction, the statute doesn't apply, regardless of its constitutionality. So the constitutionality of the statute is a separate issue from whether the conviction exists.

Therefore, the correct answer would be G: he can demonstrate that his conviction was overturned on appeal.

The question revolves around a state trooper whose pension was revoked due to a retroactive statute enacted in 2009, which denied benefits to law enforcement officials convicted of bribery. The trooper was convicted in federal court in 2008, and the state's highest court upheld the statute as constitutional. The task is to determine under what grounds the trooper might still have his pension reinstated.

### Key Analysis of Options:

- **Option A**: Proving the bribe was unrelated to his duties is unlikely to help, as the statute applies regardless of whether the bribery was job-related.

- **Option B**: Showing he was convicted before the statute's effective date is irrelevant because the statute is retroactive to 1975, covering his 2008 conviction.

- **Option C**: Arguing selective and discriminatory application could be a viable equal protection claim, but the question does not provide evidence of selective enforcement, and the statute was upheld as constitutional.

- **Option D**: Claiming double jeopardy is inapplicable because the loss of pension is a civil penalty, not criminal punishment.

- **Option E**: A presidential pardon would forgive the conviction but does not expunge it. Since the statute is based on the existence of a conviction, a pardon might not automatically restore the pension.

- **Option F**: Arguing the statute unfairly targets retired officials is unlikely to succeed, as the retroactivity was upheld as constitutional.

- **Option G**: If the trooper’s conviction is overturned on appeal, the basis for denying the pension disappears, as the statute depends on the existence of a conviction. This is a strong argument.

- **Option H**: Exercising discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court is a procedural step but does not guarantee reinstatement of the pension.

- **Option I**: Violations of the dormant commerce clause are irrelevant here, as the statute does not involve interstate commerce.

### Conclusion:
The most direct and effective path to reinstatement is **Option G**, as overturning the conviction would remove the legal basis for denying the pension, regardless of the statute's constitutionality.
