Question:

A company offered to sell several loads of landscaping stones at a specified price and itemized terms. The offeree sent a notification to the offeror stating, "We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date." The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. On the date of shipment, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager and told him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time, he was shipping the goods back, and to "ignore any paperwork we sent." The offeror sued the offeree for breach of contract. Who will prevail?

Options:

A: The offeree will prevail because verbal rejection of the contract is considered valid.
B: The offeror will prevail because the offeree's modifications to the terms were not significant enough to void the contract.
C: The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.
D: The offeree will prevail because it returned the goods, effectively cancelling the contract.
E: The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.
F: The offeror will prevail because the offeree did not officially cancel the contract in writing.
G: The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.
H: The offeree will prevail because the modifications to the terms were not accepted by the offeror.
I: The offeror will prevail because the offeree already accepted the terms when it sent the initial notification.
J: The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

So, the setup is that a company offered to sell landscaping stones with specific terms. The offeree received the offer and sent a notification saying they got the offer. Then, the offeror shipped the goods upon getting that notification. On the shipment date, the offeree sent an acceptance with slight modifications. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager, said they couldn't accept the offer, were shipping the goods back, and told them to ignore any paperwork sent. The offeror sued for breach of contract. Who wins?

Hmm. I remember that contract formation requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. The key here is whether there was a valid acceptance.

The offeror sent an offer. The offeree first sent a notification acknowledging receipt of the offer. Then, the offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. Wait, but the notification wasn't an acceptance, right? It was just acknowledging the offer. So the offeror might have acted on that, but that wouldn't necessarily form a contract yet.

Then, on the shipment date, the offeree sent an acceptance with slight modifications. Under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies to the sale of goods, the offeree's response with additional terms is a counteroffer. But wait, the UCC has something called the "battle of the forms," where even if the acceptance has different terms, it can still form a contract under certain conditions.

Wait, but if the modifications were material, then it's a counteroffer. If minor, maybe it's considered an acceptance. But the offeror might argue that the modifications were not accepted, so no contract was formed.

But hold on, the offeror shipped the goods after the first notification. Was that an acceptance? Because the first notification didn't accept the offer; it just acknowledged it. So perhaps the offeror shipped in anticipation, but that doesn't necessarily mean they accepted.

Alternatively, under the UCC, when an order is placed and the seller ships the goods, sometimes that can be considered an acceptance. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, in this case, the offeree sent a notification, then the offeror shipped. Then the offeree sent an acceptance with modifications. Then, after the goods arrived, the offeree rejected and sent them back.

So the question is whether a contract was formed when the offeror shipped the goods upon the first notification, or whether the offeree's acceptance with modifications either formed a contract or not.

Wait, the first notification was just an acknowledgment, so the offeror might have shipped the goods in anticipation, but without an acceptance, there's no contract yet.

When the offeree sent the acceptance with modifications, that's a counteroffer. The offeror's shipment would be an acceptance of that counteroffer only if they agreed to the new terms. But the offeror didn't communicate acceptance of the modified terms. So perhaps no contract was formed yet.

Alternatively, under the UCC, the offeror's shipment could be an acceptance, but I'm not sure.

But wait, the offeree later called and rejected the offer, saying to ignore the paperwork. So maybe the offeree revoked their acceptance before the offeror accepted.

Wait, but in contract law, once an acceptance is sent, it's effective upon dispatch, unless it's revocation. But in this case, the offeree sent an acceptance with modifications, which is a counteroffer. So the offeror would have to accept that counteroffer for a contract to form. If the offeror didn't accept, then no contract.

But the offeror shipped the goods after the first notification, which wasn't an acceptance. So the shipment might have been an offer to sell, and the offeree's acceptance would have to match the terms.

Alternatively, under the UCC, when a buyer sends an order, and the seller ships goods, it can be considered an acceptance. But in this case, the first notification wasn't an order, just an acknowledgment.

Wait, the initial notification said, "We have received your offer..." That doesn't indicate an acceptance. So the offeror shipped without an acceptance, perhaps in anticipation. That might be at their own risk if the offeree decides not to go through with it.

Then, the offeree sent an acceptance with modifications. If that's a counteroffer, and the offeror didn't accept it, then no contract. Then, the offeree later revoked that, but if it was a counteroffer and not an acceptance, then the offeror's shipment was perhaps an offer, but the offeree's later rejection would mean no contract.

Wait, but the offeror's shipment could be seen as an acceptance of the offeree's counteroffer. But I'm not sure. Or perhaps the offeror's shipment was on their original terms, not the modified ones.

Alternatively, maybe the offeree's initial notification wasn't an acceptance, so the offeror's shipment was an offer, and the offeree's later acceptance with modifications would be a counteroffer, which the offeror didn't accept. Therefore, no contract.

Wait, but the offeror's act of shipping could be considered an acceptance if it's in response to an offer. But the offeree's initial notification wasn't an offer; it was just acknowledging receipt.

So perhaps the offeror's shipment was an offer, and the offeree's acceptance with modifications was a counteroffer, which the offeror then didn't accept. So no contract.

But then the offeree later called and said they couldn't accept, which would be a revocation of their counteroffer. Wait, but if the offeror had already shipped, does that matter?

Alternatively, in the UCC, under ยง2-206, an order or acceptance can be by conduct. So maybe the offeror's shipment upon the initial notification was an acceptance of the offer. But the initial notification wasn't an offer; it was just acknowledging the offer.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The initial offer was from the offeror (company) to sell. The offeree (buyer) sent a notification acknowledging the offer. Then, the offeror shipped the goods. So perhaps the offeror's shipment was an acceptance of the offeree's order, but no order was placed yet.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let's try to outline the timeline:

1. Offeror sends offer to sell stones with specific terms.

2. Offeree sends notification: "We have received your offer..." - this is not an acceptance, just an acknowledgment.

3. Offeror ships goods upon receiving this notification. So they shipped without an acceptance.

4. On the shipment date, offeree sends an acceptance with slight modifications. This is a counteroffer.

5. Goods arrive. Offeree calls and says they can't accept, are returning goods, and to ignore any paperwork.

So the key points are: Was there a valid acceptance? Did the offeror's shipment constitute acceptance?

Alternatively, under the UCC, when a seller ships goods in response to an offer, it can be an acceptance. But the offer here was from the offeror to sell. The offeree's first notification wasn't an order or an acceptance; it was just acknowledging the offer.

So the offeror shipped without an acceptance. That could be considered an offer to sell, but the offeree's response was a counteroffer.

Wait, no. The initial offer was from the offeror. The offeree's first notification isn't an offer. Then the offeror ships, which could be considered an acceptance of the offeree's... but there was no offer from the offeree yet. So maybe the offeror's shipment was an offer, and the offeree's acceptance was a counteroffer.

But in that case, the offeror didn't accept the counteroffer. So no contract.

Alternatively, maybe the offeror's shipment was an acceptance of the offeree's acknowledgment, but that doesn't make sense because the acknowledgment wasn't an offer.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the options.

Option J says the offeree will prevail because they never accepted on the same terms. So if there was no mutual assent on the same terms, no contract.

The offeror's offer had specific terms. The offeree's response was a notification, not acceptance. Then the offeror shipped. Then the offeree sent an acceptance with modifications, which is a counteroffer. So unless the offeror accepted that, no contract.

The offeror didn't accept the modified terms, so no contract. Therefore, when the offeree rejected, no breach occurred because there was no contract.

So the offeree would win, which would make option J correct.

Alternatively, option G says the offeror will prevail because the posting of acceptance finalized the contract. But that acceptance had modifications, so it's a counteroffer. So G is incorrect.

Option E says the offeree will prevail because they rejected when they called. But the issue is whether a contract was formed before that.

Alternatively, if the offeror's shipment was an acceptance of the offeree's acknowledgment, but that's not valid because the acknowledgment wasn't an offer.

So no contract was formed, so the offeree's rejection doesn't breach anything. So option J makes sense.

The question revolves around whether a contract was formed between the offeror and the offeree. The key issue is whether there was a valid acceptance of the offer. 

1. **Initial Offer and Acknowledgment**: The offeror sent an offer to sell landscaping stones with specific terms. The offeree acknowledged receipt of the offer but did not accept it at that point.

2. **Offeror Ships Goods**: Upon receiving the acknowledgment, the offeror shipped the goods. However, the offeree's acknowledgment was not an acceptance, so the offeror's shipment cannot be considered an acceptance of an offer that was never made by the offeree.

3. **Offeree's Counteroffer**: On the date of shipment, the offeree sent an acceptance with slight modifications to the terms. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), this constitutes a counteroffer, not an acceptance, because it introduced new terms.

4. **No Contract Formation**: For a contract to be formed, the offeror would need to accept the offeree's counteroffer. Since the offeror did not agree to the modified terms, no contract was formed.

5. **Offeree's Rejection**: After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager, rejected the offer, and stated to ignore any paperwork. This rejection was valid because no contract had been formed due to the lack of mutual assent on the same terms.

6. **Conclusion**: Since no contract was formed, the offeree's rejection did not constitute a breach. The offeree never accepted the offer on the same terms specified by the offeror, and therefore, the offeree will prevail.

**Correct Answer: J**  
The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.
