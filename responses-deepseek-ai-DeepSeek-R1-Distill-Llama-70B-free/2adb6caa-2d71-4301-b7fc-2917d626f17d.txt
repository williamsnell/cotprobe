Okay, so I'm trying to solve this heat transfer problem. Let me see what's given and what I need to find. 

The pipe is 1.6 feet long, and the inside diameter is 0.03 feet. Water is flowing through it at a rate of 18 lbm per hour. The pipe's inside surface is maintained at 350°F because steam is condensing outside. The water enters at 40°F, and I need to find the outlet temperature, T_b2, and the heat transfer coefficient. Wait, no, looking back, the question says to determine the heat transfer coefficient and the outlet temperature. Hmm, but the options only give temperatures, so maybe the question is focusing on finding T_b2, the outlet temp. Or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, let me read the question again. Oh, right, the options are A-J, each a temperature. So the answer must be the outlet temperature. But wait, in the question, it's asking for both the heat transfer coefficient and T_b2. Hmm, maybe I misread. Oh wait, perhaps it's a two-part question, but the options are just for the temperature. Maybe the question is part of a larger problem where another part is about the coefficient. But in any case, I'll proceed.

I think I should use the concept of heat exchangers here. Since it's a pipe, it's essentially a double-pipe heat exchanger, but maybe I can model it as such. The heat transfer occurs from the steam (condensing outside) to the water inside the pipe. So the inside surface is at a constant temperature, which is 350°F. Wait, no, the surface is probably at the condensing temperature of the steam, which would be a constant. But in the problem, it's given as 350°F, so that's the temperature of the inside surface, Ts.

The water is flowing through the pipe. Its flow rate is given as 18 lbm/hr. The pipe's length is 1.6 ft, and the inside diameter is 0.03 ft, so I can compute the cross-sectional area if needed. But wait, since it's a pipe, the volume flow rate might be needed. Alternatively, since the mass flow rate is given, perhaps I can find the velocity and then the Reynolds number, which would help in finding the heat transfer coefficient.

Wait, but the problem asks for the heat transfer coefficient and the outlet temp. So perhaps I should first compute the heat transfer coefficient using the Reynolds number and the appropriate correlation, then use that to find the outlet temp with the heat exchanger equations.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the mass flow rate, but it's already given as 18 lbm/hr. Wait, no, maybe I need the velocity. So first, find the cross-sectional area of the pipe.

The diameter D is 0.03 ft, so radius r is 0.015 ft. Area A = π r² = π*(0.015)^2. Let me compute that. 0.015 squared is 0.000225, multiplied by π is approximately 0.00070686 ft².

Mass flow rate m_dot is 18 lbm/hr. To find velocity, I need the density of water. Wait, but I don't have the temperature of the water yet. Hmm. Since the water is at 40°F at the inlet, I can use properties at that temperature. But actually, the properties might change as the water heats up. But perhaps we can assume that the average temperature isn't too high, so maybe using the properties at 40°F is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe using an average temperature. But I'm not sure. Let me think: if the incoming water is 40°F and the surface is 350°F, the water will heat up, but how much? The options suggest the outlet could be up to 240°F. Let's say the average temperature is, say, (40+240)/2=140°F. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can proceed with the inlet properties and adjust later if needed.

Wait, but for the heat transfer coefficient calculation, the properties should be evaluated at the average bulk temperature. But since I don't know the outlet temp yet, perhaps I can make an initial assumption.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the heat transfer coefficient using the Dittus-Boelter correlation for turbulent flow, but first I need to check if the flow is laminar or turbulent.

So, to find the flow regime, I need to compute the Reynolds number, Re. Re = (m_dot / A) / μ. Where m_dot is the mass flow rate, A is the cross-sectional area, and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water.

But wait, m_dot is 18 lbm/hr. Let me convert the units. The area A is in ft², so let's get all units consistent.

First, let me convert m_dot to lbm/s, but perhaps it's easier to convert to lbm/(ft²·s) or similar. Alternatively, let me compute the velocity first.

Velocity v = m_dot / (A * density). Wait, m_dot is mass flow rate, which is mass per unit time. So v = (m_dot / ρ) / A. Wait, no, m_dot = ρ * A * v, so v = m_dot / (ρ*A).

I need the density ρ in lbm/ft³ and dynamic viscosity μ in lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, or maybe better to use consistent units. Let me get the properties of water at 40°F.

At 40°F, water has:

Density ρ ≈ 62.4 lbm/ft³ (I remember that at 60°F it's about 62.4, so 40°F would be slightly higher, maybe around 62.4 still. Let me double-check. Wait, no, actually, the density of water is about 62.4 lbm/ft³ at 60°F, but at lower temperatures, it's higher. For example, at 40°F, it's about 62.42 lbm/ft³, so close enough. So ρ ≈ 62.4 lbm/ft³.

Dynamic viscosity μ at 40°F is about 0.0000158 lbm/(ft·s) or 0.0000158 * 3600 = 0.05688 lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, no, units can get confusing here. Let me think in terms of SI units to avoid confusion, but perhaps it's easier to convert m_dot to lbm/s.

Wait, let's compute the velocity in ft/s.

m_dot is 18 lbm/hr. So per hour, 18 lbm. Let's find lbm per second: 18 / 3600 ≈ 0.005 lbm/s.

So v = m_dot / (ρ * A).

A is the cross-sectional area in ft². A = π*(0.015)^2 ≈ 0.00070686 ft².

So v = (0.005 lbm/s) / (62.4 lbm/ft³ * 0.00070686 ft²).

Compute denominator: 62.4 * 0.00070686 ≈ 0.0441 lbm/ft²·s.

So v ≈ 0.005 / 0.0441 ≈ 0.1133 ft/s.

Wait, that seems low. Wait, let me check the units again. Because m_dot is lbm/s, ρ is lbm/ft³, A is ft², so units are (lbm/s) / (lbm/ft³ * ft²) ) = (lbm/s) * (ft³/(lbm*ft²)) ) = ft/s. So units are correct.

So v ≈ 0.1133 ft/s. Then, Re = (v * D) / ν, where D is diameter and ν is kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but I have μ, so perhaps better to compute Re as (ρ v D) / μ.

Given that, let's compute Re.

D is 0.03 ft.

So Re = (62.4 lbm/ft³) * 0.1133 ft/s * 0.03 ft / μ.

What's μ at 40°F? Let's be precise. At 40°F (4.44°C), μ for water is about 0.00001294 lbm/(ft·s) (from tables). So μ ≈ 1.294 x 10^-5 lbm/(ft·s).

So Re = (62.4 * 0.1133 * 0.03) / 1.294e-5.

Compute numerator: 62.4 * 0.1133 ≈ 7.07, then * 0.03 → ≈ 0.2121.

So Re ≈ 0.2121 / 1.294e-5 ≈ approx 16,383. Wait, that's over 10,000, so turbulent flow. So the flow is turbulent, which allows me to use the Dittus-Boelter correlation for the Nusselt number.

Dittus-Boelter equation: Nu = 0.023 Re^(4/5) Pr^(1/3), for turbulent flow (Re > 10,000). But I need to know the Prandtl number Pr.

Prandtl number is the ratio of viscous diffusion rate to thermal diffusion rate. For water, at 40°F, I think Pr is around 7.0 (from memory, but perhaps I should double-check).

Wait, no, at lower temperatures, Pr for water is higher. At 60°F, Pr is about 3, but at lower temps, it's higher. Wait, let me think: at 32°F, Pr for water is about 13.6, and at 100°F, it's around 3. So at 40°F, perhaps around 7 to 10. Let me look it up, but since I can't, I'll have to estimate. Alternatively, I can proceed with an approximate value, say Pr ≈ 7.

So, with Re ≈ 16,383, and Pr ≈7.

Compute Nu: 0.023 * (16383)^(4/5) * (7)^(1/3).

First, compute (16383)^(4/5). Let me compute ln(16383) first. 16383 is about 1.6e4. ln(1.6e4) ≈ ln(16000) ≈ 9.680.

(4/5)*9.680 ≈ 7.744. Exponentiate: e^7.744 ≈ 2300. So (16383)^(4/5) ≈ 2300? Wait, that seems high. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 16383^(0.8). Because 4/5 is 0.8.

Let me compute 16383^0.8.

Alternatively, I can compute it as follows:

16383 is approximately 1.6383e4.

We can write 1.6383e4 = 10^4 * 1.6383.

So (1.6383e4)^0.8 = (10^4)^0.8 * (1.6383)^0.8.

(10^4)^0.8 = 10^(3.2) ≈ 10^3 * 10^0.2 ≈ 1000 * 1.5849 ≈ 1584.9.

(1.6383)^0.8: Let me compute ln(1.6383)=0.490, multiply by 0.8→0.392, exponentiate→e^0.392≈1.48.

So 1584.9 * 1.48 ≈ 2346. So approximately 2346.

So 0.023 * 2346 * (7)^(1/3).

Compute (7)^(1/3) ≈ 1.913.

So 0.023 * 2346 ≈ 54.0, then 54.0 * 1.913 ≈ 103.3. So Nu ≈ 103.

Now, Nu = h * D / k, where h is the heat transfer coefficient, D is the diameter, and k is thermal conductivity.

So h = (Nu * k) / D.

I need the thermal conductivity of water at 40°F, which is about 0.346 Btu/(hr·ft·°F). Wait, let me confirm: at 60°F, k is about 0.38, so at 40°F, it's lower, maybe around 0.34. Let's say k=0.346.

So h = (103 * 0.346) / 0.03.

Compute numerator: 103 * 0.346 ≈ 35.638.

Divide by 0.03: 35.638 / 0.03 ≈ 1188 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that seems high. But let me check the units: Btu/(hr·ft²·°F) is correct for h in English units.

But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, Dittus-Boelter gives Nu=0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.333. With Re≈16,383, Pr≈7. So the calculation for Nu was about 103. Then h = (103 * 0.346)/0.03 → (35.638)/0.03 ≈ 1188.

Hmm, okay.

Now that I have h, I can compute the heat transfer rate. But I also need to find the outlet temperature of the water. So I can use the energy balance equation for the water.

The heat transferred to the water is q = m_dot * c_p * (T_out - T_in).

Also, q can be calculated using the heat transfer equation: q = h * A_surface * (T_s - T_avg), but wait, no, more accurately, it's q = h * A * LMTD, but in this case, since the surface temperature is constant, it's a constant wall temperature scenario, so perhaps it's better to use the effectiveness-NTU method.

Wait, the pipe is a double-pipe heat exchanger, but the outside is a condensing fluid, which is providing a constant temperature. So the inside surface is at Ts=350°F.

So the heat exchanger here is a tube with water flowing inside, and steam condensing outside, keeping the surface at Ts. So the heat transfer is from the surface to the water.

So the effectiveness-NTU method applies here. The effectiveness ε is given by:

ε = (T_b2 - T_b1) / (T_s - T_b1)

But another approach is to use the equation for heat transfer in a pipe with constant wall temperature, which is:

q = m_dot * c_p * (T_out - T_in) = h * A * (T_s - T_avg), but I think a better approach is to use the LMTD method. Alternatively, use the equation for a double-pipe exchanger with known h.

Wait, the formula for a pipe (treated as a double-pipe) with length L, inside diameter D, and surface temperature Ts is:

q = h * π D L * (T_s - T_b_avg), where T_b_avg is the average bulk temperature.

But T_b_avg = (T_in + T_out)/2.

Alternatively, the heat transfer can be computed as:

q = m_dot * c_p * (T_out - T_in) = h * A_surface * (T_s - T_avg), where A_surface is the inside surface area, π D L.

So, let me write the equations.

First, compute q:

q = m_dot * c_p (T_out - T_in) 

q = h * π D L (T_s - (T_in + T_out)/2 )

Let me solve for T_out.

First, I need the specific heat of water, c_p. At around 40°F, c_p is approximately 1 Btu/(lbm·°F). Let me confirm: yes, for water, it's about 1 Btu/(lbm·°F).

So, m_dot is 18 lbm/hr.

So:

18 * 1 * (T_out - 40) = h * π * 0.03 * 1.6 * (350 - (40 + T_out)/2 )

Let me compute the right-hand side.

h is 1188 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Compute A_surface: π D L = π * 0.03 * 1.6 ≈ 0.1508 ft².

So:

RHS = 1188 * 0.1508 * (350 - (40 + T_out)/2 )

Calculate 1188 * 0.1508 ≈ 1188 * 0.15 ≈ 178.2. Wait, more accurately: 0.1508 * 1188 = let's compute 1188 * 0.15 = 178.2, and 1188 * 0.0008 = ~0.95, so total ≈ 179.15.

So RHS ≈ 179.15 * (350 - (40 + T_out)/2 )

Now, the equation becomes:

18*(T_out -40) = 179.15*(350 - (40 + T_out)/2 )

Simplify the RHS expression.

350 - (40 + T_out)/2 = 350 - 20 - T_out/2 = 330 - T_out/2.

So:

18*(T_out -40) = 179.15*(330 - T_out/2 )

Let me compute 179.15 * 330 = let's see, 179 * 300 = 53,700, 179 *30=5,370 → total 59,070. Then, 0.15 *330=49.5 → 59,070 +49.5=59,119.5.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 179.15 * 330 is:

179.15 * 300 = 53,745.

179.15 * 30 = 5,374.5.

So total 53,745 +5,374.5 = 59,119.5.

Then, the term with T_out is 179.15 * (-T_out/2 )= -179.15*(T_out)/2 ≈ -89.575*T_out.

So the RHS becomes 59,119.5 -89.575*T_out.

Now, the equation is:

18*T_out -720 = 59,119.5 -89.575*T_out.

Bring all terms to one side:

18*T_out +89.575*T_out = 59,119.5 +720.

Compute 18 +89.575=107.575.

So 107.575*T_out = 59,839.5.

Thus, T_out=59,839.5 / 107.575 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 107.575 * 555 = approx 107 *
