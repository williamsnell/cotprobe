Okay, so I have this question here about nekton, and I'm a bit rusty on my biology terms. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that nekton refers to marine animals that are capable of swimming against currents. They're not just passive drifters; they have the ability to move actively through the water. So, the key here is finding an organism that swims actively.

Looking at the options:

A: Sponge. Sponges are sessile, right? They attach themselves to surfaces and don't move around. So not nekton.

B: Protist. That's a broad category. Some protists can move, like protozoa, but others are plant-like or fungi-like. Without more specifics, I can't be sure, but I don't think protists are classified as nekton.

C: Clam. Clams are mollusks, typically living in sediment. They don't swim actively, so probably not nekton.

D: Starfish. Starfish, or sea stars, move slowly along the ocean floor. They don't swim in the water column, so they're part of the benthos, not nekton.

E: Coral. Corals are also sessile, forming colonies attached to reefs. They don't move around, so definitely not nekton.

F: Barnacle. Barnacles are marine crustaceans, but they're sessile as adults. They attach to surfaces, so no swimming against currents.

G: Whale. Whales are marine mammals. They swim actively through the water. This fits the definition of nekton because they can move against currents.

H: Seaweed. That's a type of marine algae, which are plants. They don't move, so not nekton.

I: Cyanobacterium. These are bacteria, like phytoplankton. They don't swim actively, just float, so not nekton.

J: Algae. Similar to seaweed and cyanobacteria, algae are mostly sessile or drift with the current, not swimming against it.

So, the best fit here is option G, Whale.

Nekton refers to marine animals capable of actively swimming against currents. To determine which organism fits this category, we analyze each option:

- **A: Sponge**: Sessile, does not swim.  
- **B: Protist**: A broad category, but not specifically known for active swimming.  
- **C: Clam**: Lives in sediment and does not swim actively.  
- **D: Starfish**: Moves slowly on the ocean floor, not in the water column.  
- **E: Coral**: Sessile, forming attached colonies.  
- **F: Barnacle**: Sessile as adults, do not swim.  
- **G: Whale**: Actively swims through the water, fitting the definition of nekton.  
- **H: Seaweed**: Sessile marine algae.  
- **I: Cyanobacterium**: Floats passively, does not swim.  
- **J: Algae**: Generally sessile or drifting, not actively swimming.  

The only organism that fits the criteria of nekton is the **whale**.
