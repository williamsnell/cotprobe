Question:

A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of numbness in her right hand. During this period, she has had tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is employed as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She played as a pitcher in a softball league for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows full muscle strength. Palpation of the right elbow produces a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger. The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of which of the following on the right?

Options:

A: Median nerve at the forearm
B: Radial nerve at the forearm
C: Ulnar nerve at the elbow
D: Median nerve at the elbow
E: Radial nerve at the wrist
F: Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm
G: Radial nerve at the elbow
H: Ulnar nerve at the wrist
I: Median nerve at the wrist
J: Musculocutaneous nerve at the wrist

Alright, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about. 

Okay, the patient is a 25-year-old woman with numbness in her right hand for two months. She experiences tingling in the right ring and small fingers most of the time. No history of serious illness, no medications. She works as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She used to be a pitcher in a softball league for five years, stopping two years ago.

Hmm, the symptoms are numbness and tingling in specific fingers. Ring and small fingers—those are the fourth and fifth fingers, right? So, those are the medial two fingers of the hand. I remember that nerve distribution is important here. The median nerve usually controls the first three and a half fingers, while the ulnar nerve covers the last two, the ring and small. So, if the ring and small are affected, it's probably the ulnar nerve that's involved.

She has no history of major illnesses, so maybe this is a repetitive strain or something. She works as a cashier, so maybe uses her hands a lot, but not sure. Pitching in softball for five years—maybe some repetitive motion injury, but she stopped two years ago. The symptoms started two months ago, so might not be directly related to the pitching anymore unless it's a long-term effect.

On examination, full muscle strength—so no atrophy or weakness. That's something because if the nerve were severely compressed, maybe we'd see some weakness, but she's got normal strength. So maybe it's a mild or early entrapment.

Palpation of the right elbow causes severe pain in the ring and small fingers. Oh, that's a key clue. When they press on the elbow and the pain shoots to those fingers, that suggests the nerve is being compressed at the elbow. Because the ulnar nerve runs through the elbow, specifically the cubital tunnel at the medial epicondyle. So palpating that area would cause the pain along the nerve's distribution.

Also, the sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of the ring finger and the entire small finger. That's exactly the area the ulnar nerve covers. So the sensory deficit matches the ulnar nerve distribution.

Putting it all together, the symptoms point towards ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow. I think that's called cubital tunnel syndrome. So the question is asking which nerve is entrapped where. The options are about the nerves and their locations.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Ulnar nerve at the elbow. That fits. Because the pain is at the elbow, and the nerve involved is the ulnar.

Other options: Let's see. Option H is ulnar at the wrist, which would be Guyon's canal syndrome. That might cause similar symptoms, but the palpation at the elbow wouldn't cause pain in that case. So H is less likely.

The median nerve is for the first three fingers, so options A, D, I are about median. Since the symptoms are in the ring and small, it's not median. So those can be ruled out.

Options B, E, G are radial nerve. Radial usually affects the back of the hand, the thumb side, so not the ring and small fingers. So radial is probably not involved.

Options F and J are musculocutaneous, which I think is more about the muscles of the forearm and maybe the lateral forearm sensation. Not the hand, so those are unlikely.

So the correct answer should be option C: Ulnar nerve at the elbow.

The patient is a 25-year-old woman presenting with numbness and tingling in her right ring and small fingers, which are innervated by the ulnar nerve. The symptoms suggest nerve entrapment, as the tingling is localized to the fourth and fifth fingers, and palpation of the right elbow elicits severe pain in those fingers. This indicates the ulnar nerve is likely compressed at the elbow, specifically in the cubital tunnel. The absence of muscle weakness and the sensory deficit pattern further support this diagnosis. Other options, such as median or radial nerve entrapment, are less likely because they affect different areas of the hand. The ulnar nerve at the wrist (Guyon's canal syndrome) is also unlikely, as the pain is triggered by palpation at the elbow.

The most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.

Answer: C
