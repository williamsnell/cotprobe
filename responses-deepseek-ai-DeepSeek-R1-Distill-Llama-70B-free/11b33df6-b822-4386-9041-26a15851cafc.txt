Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer between two metals. Hmm, let's see what it says. Alright, five kilograms of aluminum at 250 K are placed in contact with 15 kg of copper at 375 K. No energy is transferred to the surroundings, so it's an isolated system. I need to find the final temperature.

Wait, I remember that when two substances are in contact, heat transfers from the hotter to the cooler until they reach thermal equilibrium. The final temperature should be somewhere between the two initial temperatures. The key here is to use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat lost by one should equal the heat gained by the other.

But wait, the specific heat capacities are given in J/gm·K. Oh right, because the masses are in kg, I'll need to convert them to grams to make the units match. Or maybe I can adjust the specific heat to kg instead. Let me think: 1 kg is 1000 grams. So for aluminum, 5 kg is 5000 grams. Similarly, 15 kg of copper is 15000 grams.

So the formula for heat transfer is Q = m * c_v * ΔT. Since the system is isolated, the heat lost by copper (which is hotter) should equal the heat gained by aluminum. So I can set up the equation as:

mass_aluminum * c_aluminum * (T_final - T_initial_aluminum) = - mass_copper * c_copper * (T_final - T_initial_copper)

Wait, but since copper is losing heat, the right side should be negative. Or perhaps I should write it as the sum of the heats being zero. Let me set it up as:

m_aluminum * c_aluminum * (Tf - 250) + m_copper * c_copper * (Tf - 375) = 0

Yes, that makes sense because the heat gained by aluminum is positive, and heat lost by copper is negative. So the sum is zero.

Plugging in the numbers:

m_aluminum = 5 kg = 5000 g
c_aluminum = 0.91 J/g·K
T_initial_aluminum = 250 K

m_copper =15 kg =15000 g
c_copper =0.39 J/g·K
T_initial_copper =375 K

So the equation becomes:

5000 * 0.91 * (Tf -250) + 15000 * 0.39 * (Tf -375) =0

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, calculate 5000 * 0.91. 5000 * 0.9 is 4500, and 5000 *0.01 is 50, so 4550. So the first part is 4550*(Tf-250).

Second term: 15000 * 0.39. Let's see, 10,000 *0.39 is 3900, 5000*0.39 is 1950, so 15000 is 5850. So the second part is 5850*(Tf-375).

Wait, but wait—no, wait. 15000 *0.39 is 15000 *0.39. Let me calculate that correctly. 0.39 times 15,000. 15,000 times 0.4 is 6,000. But 0.39 is one cent less, so 15,000 *0.01 is 150. So 6,000 - 150 = 5850. Yes, that's correct.

Now, putting it in the equation:

4550*(Tf -250) + 5850*(Tf -375) =0

Let me expand this:

4550 Tf - 4550*250 + 5850 Tf -5850*375 =0

Combine like terms:

(4550 + 5850) * Tf - (4550*250 + 5850*375) =0

So 10400 Tf = 4550*250 + 5850*375

Wait, no, because it's 4550*Tf +5850*Tf = (4550 +5850) Tf = 10400 Tf.

So 10400 Tf = 4550*250 + 5850*375

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, the equation is:

4550*(Tf -250) +5850*(Tf -375) = 0

Which is 4550 Tf - (4550*250) + 5850 Tf - (5850*375) =0

So combining the Tf terms: (4550 +5850) Tf =10400 Tf

Then the constants are - (4550 *250 + 5850 *375 )

So 10400 Tf = 4550*250 + 5850*375

Wait, no, because when I move everything to the other side, it's 10400 Tf = 4550*250 +5850*375.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck the signs.

Wait, the equation is:

4550*Tf -4550*250 +5850*Tf -5850*375 =0

So Tf*(4550 +5850) =4550*250 +5850*375

Yes, so 10400 Tf = 4550 *250 +5850*375

Let me compute the right-hand side.

First, 4550 *250. Let's compute 4550 *250.

Breaking it down: 4550 *200 = 910,000; 4550 *50= 227,500. So total 1,137,500.

Wait, 4550 *250: 250 is 2.5e2. 4550 * 250 = 4550 * (200 +50) = 4550*200=910,000 and 4550*50=227,500. 910,000 +227,500=1,137,500.

Then 5850 *375. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute this:

5850 * 300 = 1,755,000.

5850 *75 = ?

Compute 5850 *70 = 409,500.

5850 *5=29,250.

So 409,500 +29,250=438,750.

So 5850 *375 =5850*(300+75) =1,755,000 +438,750=2,193,750.

So the right-hand side is 1,137,500 +2,193,750=3,331,250.

So 10400 * Tf =3,331,250 → Tf=3,331,250 /10400.

Let me compute that division.

3,331,250 ÷ 10,400.

Hmm, let's see. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 333,125 / 1,040.

Wait, perhaps I can simplify.

What's 333125 ÷ 1040?

Alternatively, 333125 ÷ 1040.

Let me see, 1040 *300=312,000. 333,125-312,000=21,125.

So 300 + (21,125 /1040).

21,125 ÷1040: 1040*20=20,800. 21,125-20,800=325.

So 20 + (325/1040)=approx 20.3115.

So 300 +20.3115=320.3115 K.

Wait, that's approximately 320.31 K.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option E is 300 K, which is lower. Option J is 321 K, which is very close. Hmm, my calculation got approximately 320.3 K. So the closest option is either J:321 or 320ish.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recompute 333,125 ÷ 1,040.

Alternatively, let's compute 3,331,250 ÷10,400.

Let me try this way: 10,400 * 320 = 3,328,000.

Subtracting that from 3,331,250 gives 3,331,250 -3,328,000=3,250.

So 3,250 ÷10,400=0.3125.

So 320 +0.3125=320.3125 K, which is approximately 320.31 K.

So the closest option is J:321 K.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check all calculations because sometimes a small mistake can happen.

Let me recompute the right-hand side:

4550 *250 = 4550 * 250.

Wait, 4550 *250: 250 is 100 + 150.

4550 *100=455,000.

4550 *150=682,500.

455,000 +682,500=1,137,500. That's correct.

5850 *375=?

5850 *300=1,755,000.

5850 *75=438,750.

1,755,000 +438,750=2,193,750.

So 1,137,500 +2,193,750=3,331,250.

Yes, that's correct.

Then 10,400 Tf=3,331,250.

So Tf=3,331,250 /10,400.

Let me compute this precisely.

Let me divide 3,331,250 by 10,400.

Another approach: 10,400 * 320 = 3,328,000.

3,331,250 -3,328,000=3,250.

So 3,250 /10,400 = approx 0.3125.

So 320.3125 K.

Looking at the options, J is 321, which is 0.6875 away. Alternatively, maybe I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:285 K

B:375 K

C:310 K

D:345 K

E:300 K

F:350 K

G:365 K

H:275 K

I:260 K

J:321 K

So the closest is J:321 K.

But wait, my calculation is 320.31, which is 320.3 K, so 320 K. But the options don't have 320. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation setup. Let me recheck.

Wait, I used the equation:

m_aluminum * c_aluminum * (Tf - 250) + m_copper * c_copper * (Tf -375) =0

But wait, for copper, since it's losing heat, the term should be negative, right? So perhaps the equation should be:

m_aluminum * c_aluminum * (Tf - 250) = m_copper * c_copper * (375 - Tf)

Yes, that's another way to write it. Because the heat lost by copper (which is at higher temperature) is equal to the heat gained by aluminum.

So let's try that approach.

So:

m_al c_al (Tf-250) = m_cu c_cu (375 - Tf)

So:

5000 *0.91 (Tf-250) =15000 *0.39 (375 - Tf)

Compute each side.

Left side: 5000 *0.91 =4550 → 4550 (Tf-250)

Right side:15000 *0.39=5850 →5850 (375 - Tf)

So equation:

4550 (Tf -250) = 5850 (375 - Tf)

Expanding both sides:

4550 Tf -1,137,500 = 2,193,750 -5850 Tf

Bring like terms together:

4550 Tf +5850 Tf = 2,193,750 +1,137,500

10400 Tf = 3,331,250

Same as before. So Tf=3,331,250 /10400=320.3125 K.

So same result.

So the final temperature is approximately 320.3 K, which is 320 K when rounded to the nearest whole number. But the options don't have 320 K. The closest is J:321 K.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct specific heat capacities. Oh wait, the problem states c_v, which is the molar specific heat? Wait, no, the units are J/gm·K, so it's per gram. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the masses. Wait, the problem says five kg of aluminum and 15 kg of copper. So 5 kg is 5000 grams, and 15 kg is 15000 grams. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the arithmetic when I multiplied 5000 *0.91. 5000 *0.9 is 4500, 5000 *0.01 is 50, so 4550. That's correct.

15000 *0.39: 10,000 *0.39 is 3900, 5000 *0.39 is 1950. So 3900+1950=5850. Correct.

So, I think my calculation is correct, leading to approximately 320.3 K.

Looking again at the options, the closest is J:321 K.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check the calculation for 3,331,250 ÷10,400.

Let me compute it more precisely.

3,331,250 divided by 10,400.

Let me write it as:

3,331,250 ÷ 10,400 = ?

Let me compute how many times 10,400 goes into 3,331,250.

10,400 * 320 = 3,328,000.

Subtract from 3,331,250: 3,331,250 -3,328,000=3,250.

Now, 3,250 ÷10,400 = ?

Well, 10,400 *0.3 =3,120.

3,250 -3,120=130.

So 0.3 + (130/10,400).

130 ÷10,400 = 0.0125.

So 0.3 +0.0125=0.3125.

So total is 320.3125 K.

So 320.3125 is approximately 320.31 K.

In the options, J is 321, which is the next integer. So perhaps the correct answer is J:321 K.

But wait, none of the other options are close. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equation.

Alternative approach: Let's calculate using specific heat in J/kg·K.

Wait, because 1 J/gm is 1 kJ/kg. So 0.91 J/gm·K = 910 J/kg·K.

Similarly, 0.39 J/gm·K =390 J/kg·K.

So, using kg instead of grams:

Heat equation: m_al * c_al * (Tf-250) + m_cu * c_cu * (Tf-375) =0

So:

5 kg *910 J/kg·K (Tf-250) +15 kg *390 J/kg·K (Tf-375)=0

Compute each term:

5 *910=4550 → same as before.

15 *390=5850 → same as before.

So 4550(Tf-250) +5850(Tf-375)=0 → same equation as before.

So same result again.

So I think my approach is correct, and the answer should be approximately 320.3 K, which is closest to option J:321 K.

Wait, but why isn't there an option for 320? Oh well, perhaps in the options it's rounded to the nearest whole number. So 320.3 would round to 320, but if the options don't have that, then 321 is the next.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equation as heat lost by copper equals heat gained by aluminum. So:

m_cu * c_cu * (375 - Tf) = m_al * c_al * (Tf -250)

Which is the same as before. So:

15000 g *0.39 J/gK (375-Tf) =5000 g *0.91 J/gK (Tf-250)

Which gives:

5850 (375-Tf)=4550 (Tf -250)

Same equation. So same result.

Hmm. I think the correct final answer is 320.3 K, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is 321 K. Maybe the intended answer is 320 K, but it's rounded up. Or perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for equilibrium temperature.

The formula is:

T_final = (m1 c1 T1 + m2 c2 T2) / (m1 c1 + m2 c2)

Wait, wait, no. Because c is per gram, and m is in grams.

So T_final = (m1 c1 T1 + m2 c2 T2) / (m1 c1 + m2 c2)

Plugging in:

m1=5000 g, c1=0.91, T1=250

m2=15000 g, c2=0.39, T2=375

So numerator=5000 *0.91 *250 +15000 *0.39 *375

Denominator=5000 *0.91 +15000 *0.39

Calculate numerator:

5000 *0.91 =4550 → 4550 *250=1,137,500

15000 *0.39=5850 →5850 *375=2,193,750

Sum:1,137,500 +2,193,750=3,331,250

Denominator:5000*0.91=4550 +15000 *0.39=5850 →4550 +5850=10400

So T_final=3,331,250 /10400=320.3125 K.

Same as before.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 320.3 K, which isn't an option. Wait, looking again at options, option J is 321 K.

So the correct answer must be J.
</think>

To determine the final temperature of the metals, we use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat lost by copper is equal to the heat gained by aluminum, as no energy is transferred to the surroundings. The heat transfer equation is:

\[
m_{\text{Al}} c_{\text{Al}} (T_f - T_{\text{initial,Al}}) + m_{\text{Cu}} c_{\text{Cu}} (T_f - T_{\text{initial,Cu}}) = 0
\]

### Given Data:
- Mass of aluminum: \( m_{\text{Al}} = 5 \, \text{kg} = 5000 \, \text{g} \)
- Specific heat of aluminum: \(
