Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: The cost of a stock was $4,200. If its selling price was 85% of the total cost, find the selling price. Then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Alright, so the key points are that the cost is $4,200, and the selling price is 85% of that cost. I need to calculate 85% of $4,200 and see which option matches.

Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember that to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 85% as a decimal is 0.85. 

So the calculation should be 0.85 multiplied by 4200. Let me do that. Let me write it out: 4200 * 0.85.

Wait, maybe I can break it down to make it easier. I know that 10% of 4200 is 420, right? So 80% would be 8 times that, which is 8 * 420. Let me calculate that. 8 * 400 is 3200, and 8 * 20 is 160, so 3200 + 160 = 3360. So 80% is $3,360.

Then there's the remaining 5%, which is half of 10%, so 5% of 4200 is half of 420, which is 210. So 85% is 80% plus 5%, which is 3360 + 210 = 3570.

Wait, but let me check that again. 85% is 0.85, so 4200 * 0.85. Another way: 4200 * 0.8 is 3360, and 4200 * 0.05 is 210. Adding them together gives 3570. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options now. Option H is $3,570, which matches what I got. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but I should double-check my math to be sure. Sometimes I make calculation errors without realizing. Let me recalculate 4200 * 0.85.

Alternatively, I can think of 4200 as 42 * 100, so 42 * 85. Let's compute 42 * 85. 40 * 85 is 3400, and 2 * 85 is 170. So 3400 + 170 = 3570. Yep, same result.

So I'm confident now that the selling price is $3,570, which is option H.

The selling price is calculated as 85% of the cost. Converting 85% to a decimal gives 0.85. Multiplying 0.85 by $4,200 results in $3,570. Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is H.

Answer: H
