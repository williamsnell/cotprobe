Okay, so I've got this question about antennas, and I'm supposed to find the maximum effective aperture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the directivity of the antenna is 50, and it operates at a wavelength of 4 meters. I remember that there's a formula connecting directivity (or gain) with effective aperture. Oh right, the formula is something like directivity D equals the effective aperture multiplied by some factor involving the wavelength. Wait, more specifically, I think it's D = (4π * A_eff) / λ². Or was it D = (A_eff * something) over lambda squared?

Wait, another thought. I recall that the maximum effective aperture A_max is related to the directivity D by the formula D = (4π A) / λ². So rearranging that, A = (D * λ²) / (4π). Does that make sense?

Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: the formula for the maximum effective aperture (A_max) is given by A_max = (D * λ²) / (4π). Let me check that. Oh wait, I think I might be mixing up the formulas. Because directivity D is the ratio of the radiation intensity to the average intensity. Oh right, the average intensity is P_total/(4π r²), and the radiation intensity U is P/(4π r²) * D. So integrating over the sphere gives the total power.

Alternatively, I remember the formula A_eff = (λ² D) / (4π). So that would be A_eff_max equals lambda squared times D divided by 4 pi.

So given that, let's plug in the numbers. D is 50, lambda is 4 meters. So lambda squared is 16. Then 50 times 16 is 800. Divide that by 4 pi. 4 pi is approximately 12.566. So 800 divided by ~12.566 equals... let's see. 12.566 times 63 is about 791. So 800/12.566 is approximately 63.66, something like that. Wait, but looking at the options, I see option H is 63.6 m². So that must be the answer.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I get the formula right? Let me double-check. Oh, another way to think about it: the maximum effective aperture is when the antenna is 100% efficient, which would be when the directivity equals the gain. So the formula I used should be correct.

Another way to think about it: the effective aperture is related to the physical size of the antenna, but in this case, we're given directivity, so using the formula A = (D λ²)/(4π) is spot on.

So with D=50, λ=4m:

A = (50 * (4)^2)/(4π) = (50 *16)/(4π) = (800)/(12.566) ≈63.66 m². Which matches option H.

So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the maximum effective aperture (\(A_{\text{eff}}\)) of an antenna, we use the formula:

\[
A_{\text{eff}} = \frac{D \cdot \lambda^2}{4\pi}
\]

where:
- \(D\) is the directivity of the antenna,
- \(\lambda\) is the operating wavelength.

Given:
- \(D = 50\),
- \(\lambda = 4 \, \text{m}\),

we calculate:

\[
A_{\text{eff}} = \frac{50 \cdot (4)^2}{4\pi} = \frac{50 \cdot 16}{4\pi} = \frac{800}{12.566} \approx 63.66 \, \text{m}^2
\]

This matches option **H**, which is \(63.6 \, \text{m}^2\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

H
