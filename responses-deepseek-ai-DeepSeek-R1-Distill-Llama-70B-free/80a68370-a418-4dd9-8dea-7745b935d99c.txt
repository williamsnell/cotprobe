Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about closing a deflationary gap using a change in government spending. The model given includes equations for consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and money demand (M_d) and supply (M_s). The equilibrium income is currently at 500, but the full employment level is 600, so there's a deflationary gap of 100. The task is to find out how much G needs to change to close this gap, assuming the money supply stays constant.

First, I need to understand what a deflationary gap is. From what I remember, a deflationary gap occurs when the equilibrium level of income is below the full employment level. This means that there's excess supply in the economy—people aren't spending enough, so there's unemployment. The desired change here is to increase income by 100 to reach 600.

The model's equations are:
- Y = C + I + G
- C = 100 + 0.6Y
- I = 0.2Y - 50i
- M_d = 0.25Y - 30i
- M_s = 65
- G = 100

The equilibrium was found to be 500, so I'll take that as given. Now, the money supply is constant, so I can't change M_s. I need to find the required change in G.

I think the approach here is to use the multiplier effect. Since we're dealing with government spending, which is a component of aggregate demand, increasing G should boost Y by some multiple of the increase in G.

The multiplier formula is 1/(1 - MPC), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. From the consumption equation, MPC is 0.6. So the multiplier would be 1/(1-0.6) = 1/0.4 = 2.5.

So each dollar increase in G would increase Y by $2.5. But wait, I have to make sure there aren't any other factors, like changes in interest rates affecting investment. But the question says the money supply is held constant, so I might need to consider that.

Wait, the money supply is fixed at M_s = 65. So any changes in Y would affect the interest rate, which in turn affects investment. So this isn't just a simple Keynesian multiplier; it's a more complex model where both the interest rate and investment are involved.

Hmm, maybe I should set up the equations again. Let me think about equilibrium conditions.

In equilibrium, Y = C + I + G. Let's substitute the given equations.

C = 100 + 0.6Y
I = 0.2Y - 50i
G is given as 100.

So Y = (100 + 0.6Y) + (0.2Y -50i) + 100.

Simplify that:
Y = 100 + 0.6Y + 0.2Y -50i + 100
Y = 200 + 0.8Y -50i

Bring terms together:
Y - 0.8Y = 200 -50i
0.2Y = 200 -50i
So, Y = (200 -50i)/0.2 = 1000 - 250i.

Now, the money market equilibrium is M_d = M_s.

M_d = 0.25Y -30i = 65.

So substitute Y from above into M_d:

0.25*(1000 -250i) -30i = 65
250 -62.5i -30i =65
250 -92.5i =65
-92.5i =65 -250
-92.5i = -185
i = (-185)/(-92.5) = 2.

So the equilibrium interest rate is 2. But that's under the initial conditions where Y is 500. Wait, maybe I should check if this aligns with Y=500.

Wait, wait. If Y=500, then let's compute i.

From Y = 1000 -250i → 500 =1000 -250i → 250i=500 → i=2. So that's correct.

So, when Y is 500, i is 2, and M_d equals M_s.

Now, the problem is to find the change in G needed to get Y to 600. So let me denote the new G as G' = 100 + ΔG. The new Y will be 600.

We need to find ΔG such that Y=600.

Let me set up the equations again with the new G.

So, Y' = C + I + G'

C' = 100 + 0.6Y'
I' = 0.2Y' -50i'
G' = 100 + ΔG

So, Y' = (100 + 0.6Y') + (0.2Y' -50i') + (100 + ΔG)

Simplify:
Y' = 100 + 0.6Y' + 0.2Y' -50i' +100 + ΔG
Y' = 200 + 0.8Y' + ΔG -50i'

Bring terms together:
Y' - 0.8Y' = 200 + ΔG -50i'
0.2Y' = 200 + ΔG -50i'
Y' = (200 + ΔG -50i') / 0.2 = 1000 +5ΔG -250i'.

Now, the money market equation with Y' and i' must hold:

M_d' = M_s → 0.25Y' -30i' =65

Substitute Y' from above:

0.25*(1000 +5ΔG -250i') -30i' =65

Compute 0.25*1000=250, 0.25*5ΔG=1.25ΔG, 0.25*(-250i')=-62.5i'

So:

250 +1.25ΔG -62.5i' -30i' =65

Combine like terms:

250 +1.25ΔG -92.5i' =65

Bring 250 to the right:

1.25ΔG -92.5i' =65-250 → 1.25ΔG -92.5i' =-185

Now, from the goods market, Y'=600.

From earlier: Y' =1000 +5ΔG -250i' → 600=1000 +5ΔG -250i'

Rearranging:

5ΔG -250i' =600-1000 →5ΔG -250i' =-400 → Divide both sides by 5: ΔG -50i' =-80 → ΔG=50i' -80.

Now, substitute this into the money market equation.

We had:

1.25ΔG -92.5i' =-185.

Substitute ΔG=50i' -80 into this:

1.25*(50i' -80) -92.5i' =-185

Compute 1.25*50i' =62.5i', 1.25*(-80)= -100.

So:

62.5i' -100 -92.5i' =-185

Combine terms:

(62.5i' -92.5i') -100 =-185 → (-30i') -100 =-185 → -30i' =-85 → i'= (-85)/(-30) = 85/30 ≈2.8333.

So i' is approximately 2.8333.

Now, plug this back into the expression for ΔG.

ΔG=50i' -80 →50*(2.8333) -80 → 141.6665 -80 =61.6665 ≈61.6665.

Wait, so ΔG is approximately 61.67. Looking at the options, option F is 61.5, which is close. But let me double-check my calculations to see if I made any errors.

Wait, let me recheck the substitution step. From Y'=600, we have:

5ΔG -250i' =-400 → ΔG= (250i' -400)/5 =50i' -80.

Then, substituting into the money equation:

1.25ΔG =1.25*(50i' -80) =62.5i' -100.

So, 62.5i' -100 -92.5i' =-185 → (-30i') =-85 → i'=85/30=2.8333... So that's correct.

Then ΔG=50*(85/30) -80.

50*(85/30) = (50*85)/30 =4250/30 ≈141.6667.

141.6667 -80=61.6667, which is approximately 61.67.

Looking at the options, F is 61.5, which is close but not exact. Hmm, maybe I made a rounding error. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, when I did 0.25*(1000 +5ΔG -250i') -30i' =65, let me recalculate that.

0.25*1000=250, 0.25*5ΔG=1.25ΔG, 0.25*(-250i')=-62.5i'.

So 250 +1.25ΔG -62.5i' -30i' =65 → 250 +1.25ΔG -92.5i' =65 → 1.25ΔG -92.5i' =-185.

Yes, that's correct. Then, from Y'=600, 5ΔG -250i' =-400 → ΔG=50i' -80.

Substituting into the money equation:

1.25*(50i' -80) -92.5i' =-185 → 62.5i' -100 -92.5i' =-185 → (-30i' -100) =-185 → -30i' =-85 → i'=85/30=2.8333.

So, ΔG=50*(2.8333) -80 → 141.6665 -80 =61.6665.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 61.6665. Option F is 61.5, which is 61.5. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding during calculations, maybe the correct answer is F.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should have kept more decimal places. Let me try to calculate it more precisely.

i' =85/30 = 2.833333...

So, 50*i'=50*(2.833333...) =141.666666...

141.666666... -80=61.666666...

So, ΔG=61.666..., which is approximately 61.67.

Looking at the options, F is 61.5. But there's no option with 61.666..., so perhaps the intended answer is F, 61.5, considering possible rounding.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplier approach. Let me think differently. Since the multiplier effect in this model isn't just the simple Keynesian multiplier because the interest rate affects investment. So the multiplier would be larger than the simple 2.5.

Wait, but I approached it through setting up equations again, which I think is correct. So I think the correct ΔG is approximately 61.67, so the closest option is F:61.5.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is 61.666..., which is 61 and two-thirds. So 61.666... is 61.67 when rounded to two decimal places.

Looking at the options, F is 61.5, which is 61.5. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me try solving without substitution.

Alternative approach: Let's use the multiplier formula when both G and I change.

The general formula for the multiplier when considering the interest rate is:

Multiplier = 1 / [ (1 - MPC) + (MPC - MPI)*(ΔI/ΔY)*(dY/dI) ) ]

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the required change in G using the equations.

Wait, another approach: The deflationary gap is the difference between full employment and equilibrium Y, which is 100. We need an increase in Y of 100.

The multiplier effect here, considering the change in G and the effect on interest rates, might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the change in G as ΔG and find how much ΔG is needed to get Y to increase by 100.

Let me think about the total change. The initial equilibrium is Y=500, and we need Y=600, so ΔY=100.

The change in G is ΔG, and the change in I would be ΔI=0.2ΔY -50Δi, where Δi is the change in interest rate.

But because the money supply is constant, any change in Y will affect the interest rate.

From the money demand equation:

M_d =0.25Y -30i = M_s=65.

When Y increases by ΔY, and i increases by Δi, we have:

0.25(Y + ΔY) -30(i + Δi) =65.

But initial Y=500, i=2.

So 0.25*(500 + ΔY) -30*(2 + Δi) =65.

Compute 0.25*500=125, 0.25ΔY, 30*2=60, 30Δi.

So:

125 +0.25ΔY -60 -30Δi =65 → 65 +0.25ΔY -30Δi =65 → 0.25ΔY -30Δi=0 → 0.25ΔY=30Δi → Δi= (0.25/30)ΔY ≈0.008333ΔY.

So, the interest rate increases by approximately 0.008333 times the change in Y.

Now, the change in I is ΔI=0.2ΔY -50Δi.

Substituting Δi from above:

ΔI=0.2ΔY -50*(0.25ΔY/30) → 0.2ΔY - (50*0.25ΔY)/30 → 0.2ΔY - (12.5ΔY)/30.

Simplify:

0.2ΔY = 6/30 ΔY = 0.2ΔY.

(12.5ΔY)/30 = (25/2 ΔY)/30 =25ΔY/(60)≈0.4166667ΔY.

So, ΔI=0.2ΔY -0.4166667ΔY= -0.2166667ΔY.

So, the change in investment is negative 0.2166667 times ΔY.

Now, the change in Y is determined by the change in G and I.

ΔY = ΔG + ΔI.

Substituting ΔI:

ΔY = ΔG + (-0.2166667ΔY) → ΔY +0.2166667ΔY = ΔG → 1.2166667ΔY = ΔG → ΔG=1.2166667ΔY.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, more accurately, the change in Y is:

ΔY = ΔG + ΔI.

But ΔI is a function of ΔY and Δi, which is also a function of ΔY.

So, let me write ΔY = ΔG + 0.2ΔY -50Δi.

But from the money market, Δi = (0.25/30)ΔY ≈0.008333ΔY.

So, substituting back:

ΔY = ΔG +0.2ΔY -50*(0.25/30)ΔY.

Simplify:

ΔY = ΔG +0.2ΔY - (12.5/30)ΔY.

Compute 12.5/30 ≈0.4166667.

So:

ΔY = ΔG +0.2ΔY -0.4166667ΔY.

Combine like terms:

ΔY = ΔG + (0.2 -0.4166667)ΔY → ΔY = ΔG -0.2166667ΔY.

Bring the ΔY term to the left:

ΔY +0.2166667ΔY = ΔG → 1.2166667ΔY = ΔG → ΔG = (1/0.7833333)ΔY.

Wait, wait, 1.2166667 ≈1.2166667, so 1/0.2166667 is not correct. Wait, no.

Wait, 1.2166667 is approximately 1.2166667, so to express this as ΔG = (1 / (1 - 0.7833333))ΔY. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, let me represent 0.2166667 as a fraction. 0.2166667 is 13/60.

So, 1.2166667 = 1 +13/60 =73/60.

So, 73/60 ΔY = ΔG → ΔG = (73/60)ΔY.

But wait, ΔY is 100, so ΔG=(73/60)*100 ≈121.6667.

Wait, that would imply ΔG is about 121.67, which is way higher than the options provided. But the options don't go that high except for I (100) and J (65), but 121 isn't an option. So this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let's go back.

Wait, I think I messed up the sign. Let me redo the substitution.

From the money market, Δi = (0.25/30)ΔY ≈0.0083333ΔY.

From the investment function, ΔI=0.2ΔY -50Δi → 0.2ΔY -50*(0.0083333ΔY) → 0.2ΔY -0.4166665ΔY = -0.2166665ΔY.

So, the change in I is negative 0.2166665 ΔY.

Now, the change in Y is:

ΔY = ΔG + ΔI + ΔC.

Wait, wait, no, in the initial model, Y = C + I + G. So, the change in Y would be ΔY = ΔC + ΔI + ΔG.

But ΔC is MPC*ΔY =0.6ΔY.

So:

ΔY = 0.6ΔY + ΔI + ΔG.

We have ΔI as -0.2166665ΔY.

So:

ΔY =0.6ΔY + (-0.2166665ΔY) + ΔG.
