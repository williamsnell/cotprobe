Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about psychology research methods. The question is about which research design would most likely show that intelligence test scores begin to decline in early adulthood. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that there are different types of research designs, each with their own purpose. The question is asking about the impact of age on intelligence, so I'm guessing it's about how intelligence changes over time as people age.

The options are A through J, each a different design. Let me list what each one does.

A: Case study. That's an in-depth study of one person or a small group. It's not about tracking changes over time across a population, so probably not relevant here.

B: Longitudinal. Oh right, longitudinal studies follow the same group of people over a long period. So if they test people's intelligence at various points as they age, they can see changes. This seems relevant because it would track the decline in the same individuals over time.

C: Observational. This involves observing behavior without interfering. While it can be used in various settings, it doesn't specifically imply tracking the same people over time unless it's a longitudinal observational study. But the key here is the design, not the method.

D: Experimental. Experiments involve manipulating variables and measuring outcomes. But age can't be manipulated, so this doesn't fit. Plus, experiments are more about cause and effect, not tracking over time.

E: Analogue. This uses artificial settings to mimic real situations. Not directly related to studying age-related changes in the same people.

F: Comparative. This compares different groups, maybe at different ages, but again, not necessarily tracking the same individuals over time.

G: Survey. Surveys collect data through self-reports. They can be used in cross-sectional studies but don't track individuals over time.

H: Cross-sectional. This design studies different groups of people at different ages at a single point in time. So it compares, say, 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds, etc., but each group is different people. This can show general trends but might not capture individual changes. Also, cross-sectional might miss cohort effects—differences due to the time period people grew up in.

I: Cross-sequential. I think this is a combination of longitudinal and cross-sectional. It might involve measuring multiple cohorts over time. But I'm not as sure about this one.

J: Correlational. This looks for relationships between variables, but doesn't establish causation. It doesn't necessarily track over time either.

The question is about when intelligence test scores begin to decline in early adulthood. So the psychologist would want to see how the same individuals' scores change as they age. That points to a longitudinal study because it follows the same people over time. If she uses longitudinal, she'll see within the group when the decline starts.

Wait, but cross-sectional (option H) looks at different people at different ages. So in a cross-sectional study, if she tests a bunch of people of various ages, she might observe lower scores in older groups. But that's based on comparing different cohorts, not the same individuals. So which design would show that a decline starts in early adulthood?

If the study uses cross-sectional, it's possible that the data might suggest a decline, but it's not as direct as longitudinal. However, the question is about the results indicating that intelligence begins to decline in early adulthood. So if the psychologist uses a longitudinal design, she can observe the same individuals and see when their scores start to drop.

But wait, some longitudinal studies might show that within individuals, intelligence peaks in early adulthood and then declines. Cross-sectional might average data across different people and could potentially miss individual variations but still could show trends.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to get at the difference between cross-sectional and longitudinal. The psychologist's study results indicating decline in early adulthood—if she's seeing within the same group, that's longitudinal. But if she's seeing it across different groups, that's cross-sectional.

Wait, but the question is about which design would lead to the results indicating decline in early adulthood. So which design is more likely to show that.

I think cross-sectional might not show the decline as clearly because of cohort effects. For example, older participants might have had less education or different life experiences, which could affect test scores. So a cross-sectional study might suggest a decline with age, but it's not as accurate because it's not tracking the same people.

A longitudinal study would control for cohort effects because it's the same people. So if the psychologist uses longitudinal, she can more accurately see if scores start to drop as the same individuals age into early adulthood.

So the correct answer should be B: longitudinal. But wait, looking back, the options are A-J. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A: case study
B: longitudinal
C: observational
D: experimental
E: analogue
F: comparative
G: survey
H: cross-sectional
I: cross-sequential
J: correlational

So the answer is B, longitudinal.

The question asks which research design would most likely indicate that intelligence test scores begin to decline in early adulthood. To determine this, it is important to evaluate the purpose of each research design:

- **A: Case study** involves in-depth analysis of a single individual or small group, which does not track changes over time in a population.  
- **B: Longitudinal** follows the same group of people over an extended period, allowing researchers to observe changes within individuals as they age. This design is ideal for studying age-related trends.  
- **C: Observational** involves observing behavior without interference but does not inherently imply tracking the same individuals over time.  
- **D: Experimental** manipulates variables to study cause and effect, which is not applicable here since age cannot be manipulated.  
- **E: Analogue** uses artificial settings to mimic real situations, which is not relevant to studying age-related changes.  
- **F: Comparative** compares different groups but does not necessarily track the same individuals over time.  
- **G: Survey** collects self-reported data, often used in cross-sectional studies, but does not track individuals longitudinally.  
- **H: Cross-sectional** studies different groups of people at different ages at a single point in time. While it can show general trends, it is less precise for observing individual changes over time due to cohort effects.  
- **I: Cross-sequential** combines longitudinal and cross-sectional elements but is more complex and less directly relevant to the question.  
- **J: Correlational** identifies relationships between variables but does not track changes over time.  

A **longitudinal design** is the most appropriate because it allows the psychologist to track the same individuals over time, directly observing when intelligence test scores begin to decline in early adulthood. This design provides the clearest evidence for age-related changes within individuals.
