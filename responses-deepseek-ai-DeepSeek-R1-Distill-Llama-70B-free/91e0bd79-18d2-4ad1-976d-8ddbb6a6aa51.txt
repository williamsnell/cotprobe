Question:

Late one evening a man was driving home from his job as a security guard at a jewefry store. As the man approached a railroad crossing he noticed that the barriers to the crossing were open. The man cautiously looked both ways for any train. Assuming that no train was coming, he proceeded across the railroad tracks. Suddenly, an oncoming train struck the man's car, completely demolishing it. The man was dead on arrival at the local hospital. Unknown to the man, the railroad crossing guard, in a drunken stupor, had fallen asleep at the barrier controls. He failed to see or hear the signals from the oncoming train that struck and killed the man. The railroad company was well aware of the crossing guard's alcoholism, but continued to employ him. However, two weeks after the accident occurred, the railroad company fired the crossing guard. The executor of the man's estate institutes a wrongful death action against the railroad company. During the trial, the attorney for the man's estate offered into proof the fact that the defendant railroad company dismissed the crossing guard shortly after the accident. Upon objection by the railroad company's attorney, the court should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, as the employee's dismissal was an admission that the railroad company was aware of the crossing guard's chronic alcoholism.
B: sustain the objection, as the dismissal is irrelevant to the case at hand.
C: sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible.
D: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is direct evidence of negligence.
E: overrule the objection, as an adoptive admission by conduct.
F: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is evidence of the railroad company's knowledge of the guard's incompetence.
G: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could unduly influence the jury.
H: sustain the objection, because the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
I: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is circumstantial evidence of negligence.
J: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could be seen as an admission of guilt.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of certain evidence in a wrongful death case. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the situation: A man was driving home and got hit by a train because the railroad crossing barriers were open. The guard was drunk and asleep, and the railroad company knew he was an alcoholic but kept him employed. After the accident, they fired him. Now, the estate is suing the railroad company, and during the trial, they want to introduce the fact that the railroad fired the guard two weeks after the accident. The railroad objects, and the court has to decide whether to allow that evidence.

The question is about whether the court should overrule or sustain the objection. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

I remember from my studies that evidence of subsequent actions can sometimes be inadmissible. For example, under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), there's a rule about subsequent remedial measures. I think it's Rule 407. That rule says that evidence of fixing a problem after an event (like making a repair) isn't admissible to prove negligence or culpability. The idea is that people shouldn't be discouraged from making repairs or taking safety measures after an accident just because it could be used against them in court.

In this case, the railroad fired the guard. Firing an employee could be seen as a remedial measure—they're correcting the problem of having an incompetent or alcoholic guard. So, if the plaintiff offers this as evidence, the defendant (railroad) would likely object, citing Rule 407.

Looking at the options, option C says, "sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible." That sounds like it's directly citing Rule 407. But wait, firing someone isn't exactly a repair, but it's a subsequent action taken to address the problem. So, maybe it's considered a remedial measure under the same principle.

Alternatively, some might think that firing the guard is an admission of guilt, which could fall under a different rule, like admissions. But I think the key issue here is whether it's a subsequent remedial measure. Because if it is, then under Rule 407, it's inadmissible for the purpose of showing negligence or liability. However, there might be exceptions—like if the evidence is being offered for another purpose, such as to show knowledge of the guard's alcoholism, not just to prove negligence.

Wait, the plaintiff's attorney is offering the dismissal as evidence. But why? Probably to show that the railroad knew the guard was incompetent and thus negligent in keeping him. So, if they fired him after the accident, it might indicate that they realized he was unfit, which would support their negligence claim.

However, under Rule 407, even if the evidence is relevant for another purpose, the rule excludes it if it's being used to prove negligence. But wait, no—the rule allows for other purposes. Let me check Rule 407 again. It says that evidence of subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence, but it can be used for other purposes, like proving ownership or control.

So, if the plaintiff is offering the dismissal to show the railroad's knowledge of the guard's incompetence, it might be admissible for that limited purpose, not for the negligence itself. But in this question, the objection is being made, and the court is deciding whether to allow it. If the railroad's attorney objects, the court must decide whether it's admissible.

But wait, the options don't really touch on this. Option C is about subsequent remedial repairs, which is a direct application of Rule 407. So if the firing is considered a remedial measure, then the evidence would be inadmissible, and the court should sustain the objection.

Alternatively, option F says, "overrule the objection, as the dismissal is evidence of the railroad company's knowledge of the guard's incompetence." That's another angle. If the dismissal is being offered to show that the railroad knew the guard was incompetent, then it's not about negligence per se, but about their knowledge, which is relevant to their own negligence in hiring or retaining him.

Wait, but under Rule 407, even if the purpose is to show knowledge, if the evidence is a subsequent remedial measure, it's still inadmissible for that purpose. Or does Rule 407 only apply when the evidence is used to prove negligence or defect? Let me think.

Rule 407 states: "Evidence of taking any action that would have been a proportional or reasonable response to the situation is not admissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, or defects." So, if the railroad fired the guard as a response to the accident, that action (firing) is a subsequent remedial measure. Therefore, evidence of the firing is inadmissible to prove negligence or culpability. However, it might be admissible for other purposes, like to show that the railroad had knowledge of the guard's incompetence before the accident, which would relate to their own negligence in employing him.

So, if the plaintiff is offering the dismissal to show that the railroad knew the guard was unfit, then it's admissible. But if the purpose is to show that the railroad was negligent, then it's inadmissible. The question is, what is the purpose for which the evidence is being offered?

The question states that the attorney offered the fact that the railroad dismissed the guard. The reason for offering it would likely be to show that the railroad recognized the guard's unfitness after the accident, implying they should have known before. So, it's about their knowledge, not directly about negligence. Therefore, it might be admissible under an exception to Rule 407.

But looking back at the options, option C says the objection should be sustained because it's evidence of subsequent remedial repairs. If the court believes that the dismissal is a remedial measure, then under Rule 407, it would be inadmissible. So the court would sustain the objection.

Alternatively, if the court thinks that the dismissal is admissible to show knowledge, then the objection would be overruled. But I'm not sure if that's the case. I think the primary issue here is whether the dismissal is a subsequent remedial measure, making it inadmissible under Rule 407, regardless of the purpose it's being offered for.

Wait, no. The rule excludes evidence of subsequent measures to prove negligence, but allows it for other purposes. So if the plaintiff is using it to prove the railroad's knowledge, it's allowed. But if the railroad objects on the basis that it's a subsequent remedial measure, the court would have to decide whether the evidence is admissible for that other purpose.

But looking at the options, option C is about subsequent remedial repairs being inadmissible. So if the court follows that, they would sustain the objection, making option C correct.

Alternatively, option F says it's overruled because it's evidence of knowledge. So which is correct?

I think the key here is that the dismissal is a subsequent remedial measure, so under Rule 407, it's inadmissible to prove negligence. But it can be used for other purposes, like proving knowledge. So if the plaintiff can argue that it's for knowledge, then it's admissible. But the railroad's objection would be on the grounds that it's a subsequent remedial measure, and thus inadmissible.

So the court would need to decide whether the evidence is being used for a permissible purpose. But in the question, the railroad's attorney objects, so the court must sustain or overrule the objection.

If the court believes that the dismissal is a subsequent remedial measure, and the plaintiff is using it to show negligence, then the court would sustain the objection. If the plaintiff is using it to show knowledge, then it's allowed, and the objection would be overruled.

But the question doesn't specify the plaintiff's purpose, just that they offered the fact. So perhaps the court would sustain the objection under Rule 407 because the evidence is of a subsequent remedial measure, and thus inadmissible for the purpose of proving negligence.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option C: sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible.

Wait, but the dismissal isn't a repair; it's an employment action. Does Rule 407 apply to employment decisions? I think the rule is broader than just physical repairs. It can include any measures taken to address the problem, like firing an incompetent employee. So yes, it would fall under subsequent remedial measures.

So the answer should be C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a wrongful death case where the plaintiff seeks to introduce the fact that the railroad company fired the crossing guard two weeks after the accident. The key issue is whether this evidence is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 407, which prohibits the use of subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence or culpability.

Rule 407 excludes evidence of actions taken after an event to address the problem, such as repairs or other corrective measures, if the purpose is to prove negligence or liability. In this case, firing the guard could be considered a subsequent remedial measure, as it addresses the issue of the guard's incompetence. While Rule 407 allows such evidence for other purposes (e.g., to show knowledge or ownership), the primary purpose here appears to be to prove negligence, making it inadmissible under the rule.

Option C correctly identifies that the court should sustain the objection because the dismissal is evidence of a subsequent remedial measure, which is inadmissible under Rule 407. Other options, such as those suggesting the evidence is admissible to show knowledge or as an admission of guilt, do not align with the specific application of Rule 407 in this context.
