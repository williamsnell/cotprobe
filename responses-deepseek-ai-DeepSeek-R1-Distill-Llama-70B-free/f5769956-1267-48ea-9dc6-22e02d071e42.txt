Question:

A woman needed to have her microwave repaired. She contacted the local handyman, who said he could repair the microwave for $100. The woman readily agreed and delivered the microwave to the handyman, who promised to have it ready in two weeks. One week later, the handyman realized that he had so much work to do that he would not be able to repair the microwave on time. He then took the microwave to a repair store. The repair store agreed to repair the microwave for $80 within one week. The owner of the repair store that contracted with the handyman was unaware that the woman actually owned the microwave. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if the handyman does not pay the repair bill.
B: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman and the repair store, but only if the repair is not completed on time.
C: The woman has no cause of action against either the repair store or the handyman.
D: The woman has no cause of action as she agreed to the repair without a specific completion date.
E: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store, but only if they knew she was the true owner of the microwave.
F: The woman has a cause of action against the repair store only.
G: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman, but only if the microwave is not repaired.
H: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.
I: The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman.
J: The woman has a cause of action against both the repair store and the handyman, but only if the handyman fails to pay the repair bill.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically regarding who is liable when a repair job goes wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So, the scenario is: A woman hires a handyman to fix her microwave for $100, and he agrees to have it done in two weeks. She gives him the microwave. Then, a week later, the handyman realizes he's too busy and takes it to a repair store. The repair store charges $80 and says they can fix it in a week. The store owner didn't know the woman owns the microwave. Now, if the repair store fails to fix it, who is liable?

The question is asking which of the options A-J correctly states the legal situation here.

First, I think I need to figure out the contractual relationships here. The woman contracted directly with the handyman. So, there's a contract between them. The handyman then contracts with the repair store to do the work. But the repair store doesn't know the woman is the owner; maybe they think the handyman owns it.

So, if the repair store fails, the handyman is the one who hired them. So, the handyman would have a contract with the repair store. If they don't fix it, the handyman could sue the repair store for breach of contract, right? But the question is about the woman's cause of action.

The woman's contract is with the handyman. So, if the handyman doesn't fulfill his obligation to fix the microwave, he's in breach. The fact that he subcontracted the work doesn't change his liability to the woman. So, the woman can sue the handyman for not fixing her microwave on time or at all.

Now, what about the repair store? The woman didn't contract with them. So, can she sue the repair store? Generally, in contract law, only parties to the contract can sue each other. Since the repair store's contract is with the handyman, the woman isn't a party. So, she can't sue the repair store unless there's some other basis, like negligence or something else.

Wait, but if the repair store damaged the microwave, maybe there's a tort claim. But the question says the repair store failed to repair, not that they damaged it further. So, maybe not tort. Alternatively, could the woman have a third-party beneficiary claim? For that, the handyman and repair store would have to have intended that the woman benefit from their contract. But the repair store didn't know she was the owner, so probably not. So, the woman can't sue the repair store directly.

So, putting it together: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman because he didn't fulfill the contract. She doesn't have a cause of action against the repair store because there's no privity of contract between her and the store.

Looking at the options:

Option H says: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only. That seems right.

Option I says she can sue both, but that's probably wrong because she can't sue the store.

Option G says she can sue the handyman only if the microwave isn't repaired. Well, the handyman is responsible regardless of whether it's repaired, because he's the one who contracted to do it. So, if the repair store fails, the handyman is still liable to her.

So, the correct answer should be H.

The woman contracted with the handyman to repair her microwave for $100, creating a contractual relationship between them. The handyman then subcontracted the repair to a store for $80, but the store was unaware of the woman's ownership. If the repair store fails to repair the microwave, the woman's cause of action lies with the handyman, as he is the party with whom she contracted. The handyman is responsible for fulfilling the contract, regardless of whether he subcontracted the work. The woman has no direct contractual relationship with the repair store, and there is no indication of a third-party beneficiary relationship or tort liability on the part of the store. Therefore, the woman can only hold the handyman liable for the breach of their contract.

The correct answer is:

H: The woman has a cause of action against the handyman only.

Answer: H
