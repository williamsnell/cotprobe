Question:

Why do economists stress the cross-elasticitiesbetween different factors of production?

Options:

A: Cross-elasticity is used to calculate the gross domestic product (GDP)
B: Cross-elasticity is essential for setting the price of luxury goods
C: Cross-elasticity is a measure of consumer preference stability over time
D: Cross-elasticity is important to maintain economic balance
E: Cross-elasticity influences the interest rates set by central banks
F: Cross-elasticity determines the fixed costs of production
G: Cross-elasticity is crucial for international trade
H: Cross-elasticity helps in predicting the weather impact on crop production
I: Cross-elasticity between the factors of production is important because factors of production often interact, at times by complementing each other's functions, at times serving as each other's substitute.
J: Cross-elasticity is important due to government regulations

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking why economists stress the cross-elasticities between different factors of production. The options are from A to J. Hmm, I remember that cross-elasticity has something to do with how different goods or factors relate in terms of elasticity.

Wait, cross-elasticity of demand, right? I think that's when the demand for one good is affected by the price change of another good. Like, if two goods are substitutes, their cross-elasticity would be positive because if one becomes more expensive, people might buy the other more. Complements would have negative cross-elasticity because if one gets more expensive, people buy less of both.

But wait, the question is about factors of production, not just goods. Factors of production are things like labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship. So cross-elasticity between factors would mean how these factors interact in the production process.

Why do economists care about that? Well, in production, sometimes factors can substitute for each other. Like, if a factory increases its use of machinery (capital), maybe it can reduce the number of workers (labor) needed. So they are substitutes. Or sometimes they might complement each otherâ€”like you need both labor and machinery to produce something, so they work together.

So if two factors are substitutes, their cross-elasticity would be positive. If they're complements, negative. This would affect how firms decide to allocate their resources. If the price of one factor goes up, the firm might switch to using more of a substitute factor. Or if factors are complements, an increase in the price of one might lead to using less of both.

Looking at the options:

Option I says, "Cross-elasticity between the factors of production is important because factors of production often interact, at times by complementing each other's functions, at times serving as each other's substitute." That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. It's about how factors can either substitute or complement each other in production.

Let me look at the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A: Cross-elasticity for GDP? No, GDP is calculated based on output, not directly on elasticity between factors.

Option B: Luxury goods pricing? Doesn't seem directly related to factors of production's elasticity.

Option C: Consumer preference stability. That's more about demand elasticity, not factors of production.

Option D: Maintain economic balance. That's too vague and not specific to factors of production.

Option E: Central banks and interest rates. Maybe related, but not directly about why cross-elasticity between production factors is stressed.

Option F: Fixed costs. No, fixed costs are about production costs that don't change with output.

Option G: International trade. While cross-elasticity affects trade, the question is about factors of production, not trade itself.

Option H: Weather impact on crops. That's a specific scenario, not the general reason economists stress cross-elasticities.

Option J: Government regulations. I don't see the direct link here.

So, the best fit is option I. It explains that factors can substitute or complement each other, which is why economists care about their cross-elasticities.

The correct answer is:

I: Cross-elasticity between the factors of production is important because factors of production often interact, at times by complementing each other's functions, at times serving as each other's substitute.
