Okay, so I've got this gas law problem here. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that when dealing with ideal gases, the combined gas law should be useful. Let me think. Oh right, the combined gas law is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. That should help me relate the initial and final conditions.

So the problem says the gas is initially at 350 ml, 25.0°C, and 600 torr. And we need to find the volume when the temperature is 600°C and the pressure is 25.0 torr. Wait, but temperature in gas laws needs to be in Kelvin, right? Because you can't have negative temperatures in these calculations.

Alright, let's convert the temperatures first. Starting with the initial temperature. 25.0°C to Kelvin is 25 + 273.15, which is 298.15 K. And the final temperature is 600°C, so that's 600 + 273.15 = 873.15 K. Got that down.

Now, plugging the values into the equation. P1 is 600 torr, V1 is 350 ml. T1 is 298.15 K. P2 is 25.0 torr, T2 is 873.15 K. And V2 is what we're solving for.

So writing out the equation: (600 torr * 350 ml) / 298.15 K = (25 torr * V2) / 873.15 K.

Wait, maybe I should rearrange it to solve for V2. Let me see, V2 = (P1 * V1 * T2) / (P2 * T1). Yeah, that makes sense.

Plugging in the numbers: V2 = (600 * 350 * 873.15) / (25 * 298.15). Hmm, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 600 * 350 = 210,000. Then 210,000 * 873.15. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me think of it as 210,000 * 800 would be 168,000,000. But 873.15 is 73.15 more than 800. So 210,000 *73.15 = let me calculate that. 210,000 *70 is 14,700,000, and 210,000 *3.15 is 661,500. So total is 14,7 + 0.6615 = 15,361,500. So total numerator is 168,000,000 +15,361,500 = 183,361,500.

Wait wait, maybe I should just do it more accurately. Let me compute 600 * 350 first: 600 *350 is 210,000. Then 210,000 *873.15. Let me compute 873.15 * 210,000. 210,000 is 2.1e5. So 873.15 * 2.1e5 = 873.15 * 210,000.

Alternatively, maybe I can do it another way. 873.15 multiplied by 210,000. Let's see, 873 * 210,000 = 873 * 2.1e5 = (800 +73) *2.1e5. 800*2.1e5 is 1.68e8, and 73*2.1e5 is 15.3e6 (since 73 *210,000 = 15,330,000). So 1.68e8 + 0.0153e8 = 1.6953e8. But wait, 873.15 is 873.15, so perhaps I should do 873.15 * 210,000.

Wait, 210,000 = 2.1e5. So 873.15 * 2.1e5 = 873.15 * 2.1 * 1e5. 873.15 *2.1 is... Let's compute that. 873 *2 =1746, 873 *0.1=87.3. So 1746 +87.3 =1833.3. Then 0.15 *2.1 is 0.315, so adding that, 1833.615. So 1833.615 *1e5 = 183,361,500.

So the numerator is 183,361,500.

Now the denominator is 25 * 298.15. 25 *300 is 7500, but since it's 298.15, that's 25*(300 -1.85) = 25*300=7500, minus 25*1.85=46.25, so 7500-46.25=7453.75.

So V2 = 183,361,500 / 7453.75. Let me compute that division.

Hmm, let me see. 183,361,500 divided by 7453.75.

Maybe I can simplify this. Let me see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 25 first. 7453.75 /25 is 7453.75 ÷25. 7453.75 ÷5 is 1490.75; ÷5 again is 298.15. So denominator becomes 298.15.

The numerator: 183,361,500 ÷25 is 7,334,460.

So now it's 7,334,460 / 298.15.

Hmm, let's compute that. 298.15 times 24,600: wait, wait, maybe approximate.

Wait, 298.15 is approximately 298. Let me see, 298 *24,600 = ?

Wait, that's way too big. Wait, no, wait, 298 * 24,600 would be 298 * 2.46e4 = 7.34e7? Wait no, 298 *24,600 = 298*(2e4 +4.6e3) = 5.96e7 + 1.37e6 = 6.327e7, which is way bigger than 7.334e6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, 298.15 * 24,600 = ?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just do the division: 7,334,460 ÷ 298.15.

Let me compute 7,334,460 ÷ 300 to approximate first.

7,334,460 ÷300 = 24,447.866... So approximately 24,447.87.

But since 298.15 is less than 300, the actual result will be a little higher.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute exact.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach, but I don't have one here. Alternatively, maybe I can note that 298.15 * 24,600 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the units.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate V2.

Wait, V2 = (600 * 350 *873.15) / (25 * 298.15).

Wait, 600/25 is 24. So V2 = 24 * (350 * 873.15) / 298.15.

Hmm, 350 *873.15 = let me compute that. 350 *800=280,000. 350*73.15= 350*(70 +3.15) = 350*70=24,500 and 350*3.15=1,102.5. So total 24,500 +1,102.5=25,602.5. So 280,000 +25,602.5=305,602.5.

So now V2 =24 * (305,602.5) /298.15.

So compute 305,602.5 / 298.15.

Hmm, 298.15 * 1025 = let's see, 298*1000=298,000. 298*25=7450. So 298,000 +7,450=305,450. So 298.15 * 1025 = approximately 305,450 (maybe a little more because of the 0.15).

So 305,602.5 is a little more than 1025 *298.15.

So 305,602.5 -305,450 =152.5 left. So 152.5 /298.15 ≈ 0.511. So total is approx 1025.511.

So V2 =24 *1025.511 ≈24 *1025 =24,600 plus 24*0.511≈12.264. So about 24,612.264 ml.

Wait, that's 24,612 ml. Oh wait, but that's way more than the options here. The options are like, 24.6 l is option J, which is 24,600 ml. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial steps. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe I should compute (600/25) * (350 ml) * (873.15/298.15). Because the formula is (P1/P2) * (V1) * (T2/T1).

So 600/25 =24. Then 873.15/298.15 is approximately 2.93. Because 298 *3 is 894, so 873/298 is about 2.93.

So 24 *350 *2.93. Let me compute 350 *24 =8,400. Then 8,400 *2.93.

8,400 *2=16,800. 8,400 *0.93=7,812. So total 16,800 +7,812=24,612. So 24,612 ml, which is 24.612 liters. So looking at the options, option J is 24.6 l, which is 24,600 ml. So that's very close.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately the ratio T2/T1.

T2 is 873.15, T1 is 298.15. So 873.15 /298.15.

Let me compute that. 298.15 *2 =596.3. 596.3 + 298.15=894.45. But 873.15 is less than that. So 2.93 times approximately.

Wait, 298.15 *2.93 = let's compute that.

298.15 *2 =596.3
298.15 *0.9=268.335
298.15 *0.03=8.9445
Adding them together: 596.3 +268.335 =864.635 +8.9445=873.5795. Oh, wait, that's almost exactly 873.5795, which is just a bit higher than 873.15. So 2.93 times gives 873.58, but our T2 is 873.15, which is a bit less.

So perhaps the exact ratio is slightly less than 2.93. Hmm, let me compute it more accurately.

Let me do 873.15 /298.15.

Let me write it as 873.15 ÷298.15.

Let me compute this division.

So 298.15 * 2 =596.3. Subtract from 873.15: 873.15-596.3=276.85.

Bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals), so 2768.5 divided by 298.15.

298.15 *9=2683.35. Subtract that from 2768.5: 2768.5-2683.35=85.15.

Bring down a zero: 851.5. Now, 298.15*2=596.3. Subtract from 851.5: 851.5-596.3=255.2.

Bring down a zero: 2552.0. 298.15 *8=2385.2. Subtract: 2552-2385.2=166.8.

Bring down a zero: 1668. So 298.15 *5=1490.75. Subtract: 1668-1490.75=177.25.

Hmm, getting a bit tedious, but so far, we have 2.9 plus 0. (the 9 is the first digit after the decimal). Wait, let me retrace.

Wait, 873.15 /298.15 = 2.93 (approx), but more precisely, perhaps 2.928.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 873.15 ÷298.15:

Approximately, 298.15 *2.928 ≈?

298.15 *2 =596.3

298.15 *0.9=268.335 → total 596.3 +268.335=864.635

298.15 *0.02=5.963 → 864.635 +5.963=870.598

298.15 *0.008=2.3852 → 870.598 +2.3852=872.9832

Which is very close to 873.15. The difference is 873.15 -872.9832=0.1668.

So 298.15 *0.00056 ≈0.1668 (since 298.15 *0.0005=0.149075, and 0.00006 would be about 0.0179). So approximately, 0.00056 would give 0.1668.

So total ratio is approximately 2.928 +0.00056=2.92856.

So T2/T1≈2.92856.

So V2= (600/25) *350 ml *2.92856.

600/25 is 24. So 24 *350 =8,400. 8,400 *2.92856.

Calculate 8,400 *2=16,800.

8,400 *0.9=7,560.

8,400 *0.02856= let's compute that.

0.02 *8,400=168.

0.00856 *8,400=72.  (Wait, 8,400 *0.008=67.2; 8,400 *0.00056=4.704. So 67.2 +4.704=71.904.)

So 168 +71.904=239.904.

So adding all together: 16,800 +7,560=24,360 +239.904=24,600 (approximately). So V2≈24,600 ml, which is 24.6 liters.

Looking at the options, option J is 24.6 l. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait, my earlier calculation gave me about 24,612 ml, which is about 24.61 liters, but the option is 24.6 l. So that's very close. I think that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 25.0^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = 600.0^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 873.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Rearrange the equation to solve for \( V_2 \)
\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the given values
- \( P_1 = 600 \, \text{torr} \), \( V_1 = 350 \, \text{ml} \), \( T_1 = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_2 = 25.0 \, \text{torr} \), \( T_2 = 873.15 \, \text{K} \)

\[
V_2 = \frac{(600)(350)(873.15)}{(25)(298.15)}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the calculation
1. Compute \( \frac{600}{25} = 24 \).
2. Compute \( \frac{873.15}{298.15} \approx 2.928 \).
3. Multiply: \( V_2 = 24 \cdot 350 \cdot 2.928 \).

### Step 5: Final calculation
- \( 24 \cdot 350 = 8,400 \)
- \( 8,400 \cdot 2.928 \approx 24,600 \, \text{ml} \)

Convert to liters: \( 24,600 \, \text{ml} = 24.6 \, \text{L} \).

### Step 6: Match the closest option
The closest option to \( 24.6 \, \text{L} \) is **J: 24.6 L**.
