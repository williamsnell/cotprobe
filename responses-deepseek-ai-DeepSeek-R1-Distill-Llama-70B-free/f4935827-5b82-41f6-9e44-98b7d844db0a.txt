Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the characteristics of a good manipulator according to Richard Christie's work. I remember that Christie did some research on manipulators, probably in the context of psychology or social behavior. 

Wait, I think Christie and his colleagues developed something called the Machiavellian personality scale. Machiavellianism is one of the dark triad traits, along with narcissism and psychopathy. So, a manipulative person, a Machiavellian, would have certain traits that allow them to manipulate others effectively.

Let me try to recall. Machiavellians are known for being strategic, manipulative, and having low empathy. They are often described as charming but insincere, willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. They don't have strong moral principles and are more pragmatic.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches these traits. Let's go through each option:

Option A: Compassion, obedience, altruism, self-sacrifice. That's the opposite. Manipulators aren't compassionate or obedient; they're more self-serving.

Option B: Low interpersonal awareness, rigid compliance, absence of ambition, excessive trust. No, manipulators are high in interpersonal awareness, not low. They know how to read people. Also, rigid compliance doesn't fit; they probably don't follow rules strictly.

Option C: Lack of emotion when dealing with people, no conventional morality, no strong ideology, psychological balance. Hmm, that sounds closer. They might not show much emotion, don't follow conventional morals, aren't committed to ideologies, and are relatively stable.

Option D: Lack of empathy, non-conformity, no ideological beliefs, high narcissism. Some of these fit, like lack of empathy and non-conformity, but high narcissism is more about self-importance, which might not be the same as Machiavellianism. Also, narcissism is a different trait in the dark triad.

Option E: Guilt, dependence on approval, religious convictions, transparency. No, manipulators don't feel guilt and aren't transparent.

Option F: High emotional intelligence, adherence to norms, religious beliefs, psychological maturity. No, manipulators have high emotional intelligence but don't adhere to norms; they use them to their advantage.

Option G: Emotional attachments, high morals, strong ideology, instability. No, manipulators don't have strong morals or emotional attachments.

Option H: High empathy, strict adherence, ideological dogma, low self-esteem. No, manipulators have low empathy, not high.

Option I: Lack of strategy, high ethics, activism, volatility. No, manipulators are strategic and not ethical.

Option J: Genuine emotions, fair play, loyalty, anxiety. No, manipulators don't show genuine emotions and aren't anxious.

So, the best fit seems to be Option C. It mentions lack of emotion, no conventional morality, no strong ideology, and psychological balance. That aligns with what I remember about Machiavellians from Christie's work. They're calm, calculating, not bound by traditional morals, and don't get swayed by strong beliefs, staying relatively balanced.

The correct answer is C. Richard Christie's work on manipulators, particularly in the context of Machiavellian personality traits, highlights characteristics such as a lack of emotion when dealing with people, a lack of conventional morality, no strong ideological commitments, and relative psychological balance. These traits enable manipulators to act strategically and pragmatically without being constrained by empathy, morals, or rigid beliefs.
