Okay, so I've got this problem about transpiration cooling using liquid oxygen. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is about protecting combustion chamber walls. The inside surface temperature should be maintained at 1170°R. They're adding liquid oxygen at 170°R through the porous walls into the chamber. The gas stream is at 3100°R. The heat transfer coefficient without oxygen is 250 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. I need to find the required rate of adding oxygen.

Wait, transpiration cooling... I remember that it's a method where a coolant is injected through a porous material to reduce heat transfer. The coolant evaporates, taking heat away from the surface. So in this case, liquid O2 is being used.

I think the key here is to calculate the heat flux. Without the oxygen, the heat transfer would be determined by the heat transfer coefficient, the area, and the temperature difference. But when adding the oxygen, the heat is used to both heat the wall and vaporize the O2.

Wait, no, maybe the heat from the gas stream is being used to heat the wall and the oxygen. Or perhaps the heat conducted through the wall is balanced by the heat carried away by the oxygen.

Wait, the walls are being cooled by the oxygen. So the heat flux from the hot gas to the wall must be balanced by the heat carried away by the oxygen.

Right, the heat conducted through the wall (q) is equal to the heat absorbed by the oxygen (q_m). So q = q_m.

But wait, let me think again. The heat from the gas (at 3100 R) flows through the wall to the inside surface (1170 R). The oxygen, at 170 R, is added through the walls. So the heat conducted through the wall is used to heat the oxygen from 170 R to 1170 R, plus any phase change. Oh wait, but is the oxygen liquid or gas when it's added? The question says liquid oxygen is added. So it's probably vaporizing.

Wait, when a liquid is vaporized, it absorbs a lot of heat. So maybe the oxygen first warms up from 170 R to its boiling point at that pressure, then vaporizes, and then the gas warms up further to the wall temperature of 1170 R.

But I'm not sure about the pressure here. Maybe it's at standard conditions. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention pressure, so perhaps we can assume that the latent heat of vaporization is at standard conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified, assuming that the oxygen's temperature increases to the wall temperature without considering phase change. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because liquid would vaporize upon heating.

Wait, maybe I should model this as the oxygen being heated from 170 R to the wall temperature of 1170 R. But that's a 1000 R rise. Wait, but if it's liquid, that might not be the case. Because as a liquid, it would require heat to boil, and then as gas, heat to increase temperature.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the oxygen is being used to cool the wall by taking away the heat. So the heat conducted from the gas to the wall is used to heat the oxygen from its initial temperature to the wall's temperature. But perhaps we can model it using an energy balance.

The heat transferred from the gas to the wall is equal to the heat absorbed by the oxygen. So:

q = h * A * (T_gas - T_wall) 

But wait, no, that's without the oxygen. Because when you add the oxygen, it's altering the heat transfer. Hmm, maybe I should think about the overall heat transfer with the cooling effect.

Wait, I remember the concept of effectiveness in heat exchangers. Or maybe the concept of using a cooling flow to reduce the heat flux.

Alternatively, the heat flux without the cooling is q = h * (T_gas - T_wall). But when you add the cooling, the heat is carried away by the coolant (oxygen), so the actual heat flux to the wall is q = h * (T_gas - T_wall) - (m * c_p * (T_wall - T_oxygen_in)) )

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, the heat lost by the gas is equal to the heat gained by the wall plus the heat carried away by the oxygen.

Wait, let me think about the energy balance. The heat conducted through the wall (q_cond) is the heat from the gas to the wall. But this heat is used to heat the oxygen and also to maintain the wall at a certain temperature. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the heat flux from the gas to the wall is q = h * (T_gas - T_wall). But this q must be equal to the heat carried away by the oxygen. So q = m * (h_fg + c_p*(T_wall - T_sat)) )

Wait, no, perhaps the heat carried by the oxygen is the latent heat plus the sensible heat. But I'm not sure about the exact approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler: the heat conducted through the wall is equal to the heat required to warm the oxygen from its initial temperature to the wall temperature, considering both the latent heat (if it's a phase change) and the sensible heat.

Wait, but if the oxygen is a liquid at 170 R, when it's added through the walls, it's going to vaporize. So it will absorb the latent heat of vaporization at that temperature, and then the gas will be heated from the boiling point to the wall temperature.

But wait, I don't have the boiling point of oxygen at a certain pressure. Since the problem doesn't give that, perhaps it assumes that the oxygen is already a gas? Or perhaps the temperature given is such that there's no phase change, which I doubt.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the oxygen remains in the liquid phase, which doesn't make sense because adding it to a hot environment, it would vaporize.

Wait, perhaps the problem ignores the latent heat and treats the oxygen as a gas. But that's probably not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem treats the heat as being used to raise the temperature of the oxygen from 170 R to the wall temperature of 1170 R, without considering phase change. That might be a simplification they expect us to make.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the formula.

The heat transfer without oxygen is q = h * A * (T_gas - T_wall). So that's 250 * (3100 - 1170) = 250 * 1930 = 482500 Btu/(hr·ft²).

But when oxygen is added, the heat is carried away by the oxygen. So the heat flux becomes q = m * c_p * (T_wall - T_initial), where m is the mass flow rate, and T_initial is the oxygen's initial temperature.

Wait, but if the oxygen is a liquid, then it would require latent heat to vaporize. So perhaps it's q = m * (h_fg + c_p_gas*(T_wall - T_boil)).

But without knowing the boiling point, I can't do that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the oxygen is in the gas phase and only absorbs sensible heat.

Wait, but the question states that liquid oxygen is added, so it's definitely undergoing a phase change. So maybe the heat required is the latent heat plus the sensible heat.

But without knowing the specific latent heat of vaporization for oxygen, I can't proceed. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the latent heat and only consider sensible heating. Let me check the data given.

Ah, wait, the problem doesn't give any latent heat or specific heat capacities, so perhaps it's intended to model the process without considering phase change. So treating the oxygen as a gas that's being heated from 170 R to 1170 R.

In that case, the heat carried away by the oxygen per unit area would be m_dot * c_p * (T_wall - T_initial), where m_dot is the mass flow rate per unit area.

Wait, but the question asks for the rate in lb-moles per hour per square foot. So perhaps I need to find m_dot in lb-moles/hr·ft².

Hmm, but I don't have the specific heat of oxygen. Wait, maybe I can use the specific heat at constant pressure for diatomic gases. Oxygen is diatomic, O2. The specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, for diatomic gases is about 7/2 R, where R is the gas constant.

Wait, R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lb-mole·°R) but I'm not sure if that's the value to use. Alternatively, R is 1.986 Btu/(lb-mole·°R). So 7/2 * 1.986 ≈ 6.947 Btu/(lb-mole·°R).

So c_p = (7/2) * R = (7/2) * 1.986 ≈ 6.947 Btu/(lb-mole·°R).

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's per mole or per mass. Hmm.

So, the heat conducted through the wall is q = h * (T_gas - T_wall) = 250 * (3100 - 1170) = 250 * 1930 = 482500 Btu/(hr·ft²).

This heat must be carried away by the oxygen. So:

q = m_dot * c_p * (T_wall - T_initial)

So 482500 = m_dot * 6.947 * (1170 - 170) → 1170-170=1000 R.

So 482500 = m_dot * 6.947 * 1000 → m_dot = 482500 / (6.947 * 1000) → let's calculate that.

6.947 * 1000 = 6947 → 482500 / 6947 ≈ let's see, 482500 ÷ 7000 is about 69, but since 6947 is close, maybe around 69.5.

Wait, 6947 * 69 = let's compute 7000 * 69 = 483,000. So 483,000 - (53 * 69) = 53*69=3657 → 483000-3657= 479,343. Hmm, but 482500 is the numerator. 482500-479343=3157. So 3157/6947 ≈ 0.454. So m_dot ≈ 69.454 lb-moles/(hr·ft²).

Wait, that's way higher than any of the options given (options are up to 40 lb-moles). So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the oxygen is a liquid and thus its specific heat is much lower. Oh wait, but when it's a liquid, the specific heat is per unit mass, not per mole. So perhaps that's where I went wrong.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the mass flow rate, not molar flow rate. Because if the oxygen is a liquid, it's being added as a mass flow, and then we convert to moles.

Wait, but the answer options are in lb-moles per hour per square foot. So, perhaps I need to compute the molar flow rate.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me start over.

The heat conducted from the gas to the wall is q = h*(T_gas - T_wall) = 250*(3100-1170) = 250*1930 = 482500 Btu/(hr·ft²).

This heat is carried away by the oxygen. So the heat per unit time per unit area is m_dot * (h_fg + c_p*(T_wall - T_boil)).

But without knowing T_boil or h_fg, this approach is stuck. So perhaps the problem is simplifying it, assuming that the oxygen is in gaseous form and only sensible heat is considered.

In that case, q = m_dot * c_p * (T_wall - T_initial).

But I'm getting a m_dot of around 69.45 lb-moles/(hr·ft²), which isn't among the options. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I should have used the correct units for c_p. Let me check. R is 1.986 Btu/(lb-mole·°R). So c_p for O2 as diatomic is (7/2)*R = 6.951 Btu/(lb-mole·°R).

So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat transfer coefficient given is for convection without the oxygen. But when the oxygen is transpired, it changes the convection coefficient. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention that. It says to find the required rate of oxygen addition, so perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't considering the oxygen as a coolant in the gas phase. Perhaps it's using the latent heat of vaporization of the oxygen. So the heat carried away is m_dot * h_fg.

So in that case, q = m_dot * h_fg.

But without h_fg for O2, I can't compute it. Wait, but perhaps it's given in the problem implicitly. Or maybe I should look up the latent heat of vaporization for O2. Wait, but I can't do that right now, so perhaps the problem expects me to use an approximate value.

Wait, the latent heat of vaporization for oxygen at its boiling point (around 90 K or 162 R) is approximately 50 Btu/lb-mole. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 70 Btu/lb-mole.

Wait, but if I assume h_fg is 70 Btu/lb-mole, then m_dot = q / h_fg = 482500 /70 ≈ 6899 lb-moles/(hr·ft²). That's way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the heat transfer with the oxygen as a cooling film. So the effective heat transfer coefficient becomes higher, but the temperature difference is adjusted.

Alternatively, the problem might be using the concept of the overall heat transfer coefficient considering the transpiration cooling. So the formula would involve the heat transfer coefficient and the mass flow rate.

Wait, another approach: The heat flux without transpiration is q = h * (T_gas - T_wall). When transpiration is applied, the effective heat flux is reduced because some of the heat is carried away by the coolant.

The formula I recall is:

q = (h / (1 + (m * c_p)/h )) * (T_gas - T_wall) - (m * c_p * (T_wall - T_initial))

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the overall heat transfer is:

q = h * (T_gas - T_wall) = m_dot * c_p * (T_wall - T_initial)

Wait, that's similar to what I did before. So plugging in the numbers again, I get m_dot ≈ 69 lb-moles/(hr·ft²), which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm using the wrong c_p.

Wait, maybe I should use the specific heat in terms of mass instead of moles. Because if the oxygen is a liquid, then its specific heat is per unit mass, like in Btu/(lb·°R).

The specific heat of liquid oxygen is about 0.0397 Btu/(lb·°R). Then, the latent heat of vaporization is around 50 Btu/lb (I'm not sure, but let's say approximately that).

Wait, but then the heat carried away would be for heating the liquid, then vaporizing it, then heating the gas.

But without knowing the exact temperatures, this is getting complicated. Let's try to proceed.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate heat conducted through the wall: q = h*(T_gas - T_wall) = 250*(3100-1170) = 250*1930 = 482500 Btu/(hr·ft²).

2. This heat is carried away by the oxygen. The oxygen is liquid at 170 R, which is about 170-460 = negative, wait no, 170 R is about -293°C. Wait, that's extremely cold. Wait, 170 R is 170-460 = -290 F. Hmm, that's way below the boiling point of oxygen, which is around 90 K or 162 R. So the oxygen is added as a liquid at 170 R, which is below its boiling point. Wait, no, that can't be, because 170 R is much lower than 162 R? Wait, no, 170 R is higher than 162 R. Wait, no, 170 R is 170, 162 R is lower. Oh wait, 170 R is higher than 162 R. So the oxygen is a liquid at 170 R, which is above its boiling point, so it's a gas? Or perhaps the boiling point at higher pressures is higher. Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the oxygen as a gas, and I should use the gas specific heat. So perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation.

Wait, but the initial calculation gave me 69 lb-moles/(hr·ft²), which isn't among the options. The options top at 40 lb-moles. So perhaps I'm missing a factor, like the heat carried away is only part of the total heat.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the heat conducted through the wall is split into heating the wall and the oxygen. But the wall's temperature is maintained by the cooling, so perhaps the heat conducted is entirely carried by the oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Stefan-Boltzman law for radiation, but the question mentions convection with a heat transfer coefficient, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with the mass flow rate as (q) / (c_p * (T_wall - T_initial)).

Wait, but using c_p as Btu/(lb-mole·°R), so:

m_dot = q / (c_p * (T_wall - T_initial)).

Plugging in the numbers:

m_dot = 482500 / (6.947 * 1000) ≈ 482500 / 6947 ≈ 69.45 lb-moles/(hr·ft²).

Hmm, but the options don't go that high. The highest option is E:40.2, so I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the specific heat of oxygen as a liquid, not a gas. Let me check the specific heat of liquid oxygen. I think it's around 0.0397 Btu/(lb·°R). Wait, but then I would need the mass flow rate, not molar.

Wait, let's try that approach.

If the oxygen is a liquid, then:

q = m_dot * c_pl * (T_wall - T_initial) + m_dot * h_fg

Where c_pl is the specific heat of liquid oxygen, and h
