Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about electric and magnetic fields. Hmm, I need to find which statement is false. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which of the options A to J is false. So, each option makes a statement about electric and magnetic fields and their effects on charges.

First, I should probably recall what I know about electric and magnetic fields. I remember that electric fields exert forces on charges, regardless of whether the charge is moving. The force is given by F = qE. On the other hand, magnetic fields only exert forces on moving charges. The magnetic force is given by F = q(v × B), which depends on the velocity of the charge and the direction of the magnetic field.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: "A positive charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a positive charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, positive charges do move in the direction of the electric field because the force is F = qE. As for the magnetic field, the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. So, the direction of the force (and thus the movement if that's the only force) would be perpendicular. So A sounds correct, but wait, the statement says the charge moves perpendicular to the magnetic field. Hmm, actually, the charge's movement (velocity) is perpendicular to the magnetic field when the force is maximum. So I think the statement is correct. So A is true.

Option B: "All charges experience a force in an electric field, but only moving charges can experience a force in a magnetic field." That aligns with what I remember. Electric fields affect all charges, moving or not. Magnetic fields only affect moving charges. So B is correct.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." Wait, no. The opposite is true. All charges feel electric force (moving or not), and only moving charges feel magnetic force. So C is saying the opposite, making it false. If C is the false statement, then the answer might be C. But I should check all options before deciding.

Option D: "A charge moving along the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving along the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." That makes sense because if the velocity is parallel to E, then F = qE (since v and E are same direction). For the magnetic part, if v is parallel to B, then v × B is zero, so F is zero. So D is correct.

Option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, no. The electric force is F = qE, so it's parallel to E (if q is positive) regardless of motion. But the magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B. So the statement might not be accurate. Wait, E says "experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." But if the charge is moving, the electric force is parallel to E, and the magnetic force is perpendicular to B, but the magnetic force isn't necessarily experienced in all cases. For example, if v is parallel to B, then the magnetic force is zero. So E's statement is not universally true. Wait, E says "all moving charges experience a force...", but some moving charges (like when v is parallel to B) won't feel magnetic force. So E is false in that part. So E is a false statement. Wait, but the question is asking which is false. So if E is false, then it's a candidate for the answer. But let me check the others.

Option F: "A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field." No, because a stationary charge isn't moving, so F = q(v × B) would be zero. So F is false, making F a false statement. Wait, but the question is which is false. So F is a false statement. Hmm, but I thought C was false as well.

Option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field." Stationary charges do feel electric force (parallel to E) but no magnetic force because they're not moving. So the statement says they experience a force perpendicular to B, which would be zero. So G is correct because the second part (perpendicular to B) is about not experiencing a force. Wait, no. Let me parse G again. It says "experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." So for stationary charges, the electric force is parallel to E, but the magnetic force is zero. So the statement is saying they experience both, which is incorrect. So G is false because stationary charges don't experience magnetic force. So G is a false statement.

Option H: "A charge moving perpendicular to the direction of an electric field will experience a force, but a charge moving perpendicular to the direction of a magnetic field will not experience a force." Moving perpendicular to E: F = qE, so it experiences a force. Moving perpendicular to B: then v and B are perpendicular, so F = qvB, maximum force. So the statement says it won't experience a force, which is false. Therefore, H is false.

Option I: "Electric and magnetic fields do not interact with each other." Hmm. Wait, do they interact? I think they can, but maybe in certain contexts. Like in a electromagnetic wave, they are perpendicular and oscillate. But in general, fields don't directly interact; they can coexist, but their forces are on charges, not on each other. So I think I is correct. So I is a true statement.

Option J: "A negative charge moves in the direction of an electric field; a negative charge moves perpendicular to a magnetic field." Wait, negative charges move opposite to the electric field direction because F = qE, and if q is negative, the force is opposite to E. So the first part is incorrect. The second part is correct because the movement (velocity) is perpendicular to B when the force is maximum. So J is making a false statement in the first part. So J is false.

Wait, let me summarize. The question is which statement is false. So the false statements I found are:

Option C: False because it reverses the conditions for E and B fields.
Option E: False because not all moving charges experience a magnetic force (only when v and B are not parallel).
Option F: False because stationary charges can't experience magnetic force.
Option G: False because stationary charges don't experience magnetic force, so the statement is wrong.
Option H: False because moving perpendicular to B does cause a magnetic force.
Option J: False because the first part is wrong (negative charge moves opposite to E).

So, the question is asking which is false. So I need to check all options.

Wait, the question is to pick the false statement from the options. So, the correct answer would be the option that is false.

Let me go through each again.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." This is wrong because only moving charges experience magnetic forces, not all charges. So C is false.

Option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." No, because some moving charges may have velocity parallel to B, so no magnetic force. So E is false.

Option F: "A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field." No, because v=0, F=0. So F is false.

Option G: "All stationary charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." No; stationary charges feel E force (parallel to E) but no B force. So the statement claims they experience a force from B, which is false. So G is false.

Option H: "A charge moving perpendicular to E experiences force, but moving perpendicular to B does not." The second part is wrong because moving perpendicular to B does experience force. So H is false.

Option J: "Negative charge moves in direction of E; moves perpendicular to B." The first part is wrong because negative charges move opposite to E. So J is false.

So, the question is to find the false statement. The options given are which is false.

Now, looking back, the question says: Which of the following statements is FALSE.

Looking at the options, the correct answer must be the false statement.

So, to find which option is false, but I'm getting multiple options as false. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in some.

Wait, let's double-check each.

Option C: All charges experience a force in a magnetic field? No, only moving charges. So C's statement is wrong, making it false. So C is false.

Option E: All moving charges experience a force parallel to E. Electric force is always parallel (if positive) or antiparallel (if negative), but the statement says 'parallel', which depends on the sign. Wait, but E says 'experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B'. But wait, for E, the force is F_E = qE, which is parallel to E if q is positive, opposite if negative. But the option says 'parallel', regardless of charge. So it might not be universally correct. However, the second part says 'perpendicular to B'. But the magnetic force is perpendicular to both v and B, so it's not necessarily 'perpendicular to B' in direction. Wait, the magnetic force is perpendicular to B, yes. Because F is in the direction perpendicular to B. So the magnetic force's direction is perpendicular to B. So E's statement says that moving charges experience a force (from E) parallel to E, and (from B) perpendicular to B. But, for the electric part, if the charge is negative, the force is antiparallel. So E is incorrect because it doesn't account for negative charges. Or, does "parallel" in the option mean regardless of charge's sign? Because the electric force is in the same direction as E only if positive. So E's statement is not universally correct, making E false.

Option F: Stationary charges can't experience force in B. So F is false.

Option G: Stationary charges experience a force from E (parallel) and from B (perpendicular), but since they don't move, B doesn't affect them. So G's statement is incorrect because it claims they experience both, which is false. So G is false.

Option H: Charge moving perpendicular to E experiences force (true, F = qE), but moving perpendicular to B, the force is maximum. So H's second part is false, making H false.

Option J: Negative charge moves in direction of E? No, opposite. So J is false.

Wait, the question is which statement is false. So all these options (C, E, F, G, H, J) are false. But that can't be, because the options are A to J.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this differently.

The correct physics:

Electric force (F_E) = q E. All charges, moving or not, experience this.

Magnetic force (F_B) = q (v × B). Only moving charges experience this.

So, for any option that says the opposite, it's false.

Now, let's go through each option again.

Option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field..." No, only moving ones. So C is false.

Option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." Not exactly. Because F_E is qE (parallel if positive), but F_B is q(v x B), which is perpendicular to B. But the statement says "experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." Wait, but F_E is parallel to E, F_B is perpendicular to B. So the statement is correct about the directions. Wait, but it's possible that the net force could be in a different direction, but each individual force has those properties. However, the option says "experience a force," which might be interpreted as both forces. But if a moving charge is in a region with both E and B fields, then yes, it can experience both forces. But the option says "all moving charges" which isn't necessarily true because if E or B is zero, then the force isn't present. But the option is making a general statement. So perhaps E is correct. Hmm, maybe I was wrong about E.

Wait, the options are statements about the fields, not about specific configurations. So when E says "all moving charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B," it's not necessarily correct because it's possible for a moving charge to have F_E and/or F_B, depending on the fields present. But the statement is making a universal claim, which may not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is correct if considering both forces together. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is which statement is definitely false, and only one is the correct answer.

Looking back, let's think about each option.

Option C: All charges experience force in B. No, only moving. So C is false.

Option F: Stationary charge can experience force in B. No, because v=0. So F is false.

Option G: Stationary charges experience force from E (true) and from B (false). So G is false.

Option H: Charge moving perpendicular to E: F_E exists (correct). Charge moving perpendicular to B: F_B exists (so H's statement that it doesn't is false). So H is false.

Option J: Negative charge moves in direction of E? No, opposite. So J is false.

So, multiple options are false. But the question must have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me read the options again.

The question is which statement is false.

Looking at each option again:

Option C: All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving in E. That's wrong. So C is false.

Option F: A stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field. No, so F is false.

Option G: All stationary charges experience force parallel to E and perpendicular to B. No, because no B force, so G is false.

Option J: Negative charge moves in E direction. No, so J is false.

So, the options C, F, G, H, J are all making false statements. But the question is to choose only one.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. Let me check the other options again.

Option D: Charge moving along E: F_E exists (yes). Charge moving along B: F_B zero (yes). So D is correct.

Option B: All charges experience E force, only moving experience B. Correct.

Option A: Positive charge moves in E direction (yes, because F_E is in E's direction for positive). Positive charge moves perpendicular to B, which is correct because F_B is perpendicular to B. So A is correct.

Option I: E and B fields don't interact. Correct, because fields don't exert forces on each other, only on charges.

So the false options are C, E, F, G, H, J.

But the question says only one is to be selected. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, looking again at option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field."

Wait, the electric force is F_E = q E, which is parallel to E (if q is positive) or antiparallel (if q is negative). So the direction of F_E depends on the charge's sign. Similarly, F_B is always perpendicular to B. So the statement in E says "force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." But for a negative charge, F_E would be antiparallel to E. So E's statement is not universally correct because it doesn't account for negative charges. Thus, E is a false statement.

But wait, another approach: the question is about whether the statement is false. So let me check the options again.

So, the correct answer is probably option C, which claims that all charges experience a force in a magnetic field, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, option F is also incorrect because it says a stationary charge can experience a magnetic force, which is impossible.

Wait, but the question is which is false. So perhaps more than one option is false, but the question expects only one correct answer. So perhaps I should look for which option is the best fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, another approach: the question is about identifying the false statement.

Let me try to think of each option's validity.

Option C says all charges experience a force in a magnetic field. That's wrong because only moving charges do. So C is false.

Option F says a stationary charge can experience a force in a magnetic field. That's wrong because v=0, so F_B=0. So F is false.

But the question is which is the false statement. So which of these is among the options.

If the options are A-J, and the question is which is false, then perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is looking for the most directly incorrect statement.

So, considering all that, the false statements are C, E, F, G, H, J.

But the question is which one is false, and the options are given as A to J.

Looking back, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the most directly false statement.

Option C: All charges experience a force in a magnetic field. No, only moving. So C is definitely false.

Option F: Stationary charges can experience force in B. No, so F is false.

So which of these is an option in the question.

Looking at the options, both C and F are present. So perhaps more than one is false, but the question requires choosing one.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option.

Wait, let me check option E again.

Option E: "All moving charges experience a force parallel to an electric field and perpendicular to a magnetic field."

Wait, the electric force is parallel to E (if positive), but the magnetic force is perpendicular to B. So the statement is about each force's direction relative to their respective fields. So the statement is correct in that sense. But wait, the statement says "experience a force", which could be interpreted as the net force. But no, the forces are separate. So E's statement is correct in terms of direction, but only if both fields are present. Hmm, perhaps E is correct.

Wait, no. Because the statement says "all moving charges experience a force parallel to E and perpendicular to B." But if a moving charge is in an electric field but no magnetic field, it doesn't experience a magnetic force. So the statement is making a universal claim that is not correct. So E is false.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the correct approach.

The correct answer is likely option C because it directly contradicts the fundamental principle that only moving charges experience magnetic forces.

So, putting it all together, the false statement is option C: "All charges experience a force in a magnetic field, but only moving charges can experience a force in an electric field." This is incorrect because all charges experience electric forces, and only moving charges experience magnetic forces. So
