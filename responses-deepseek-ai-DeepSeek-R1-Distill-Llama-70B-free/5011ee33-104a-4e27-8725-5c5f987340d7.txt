Okay, so I need to figure out the price that maximizes the manufacturer's profit. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the given information. The manufacturer currently sells 2000 units at $2 each. For every 1-cent increase in price, sales drop by 10 units. The fixed costs are $500, and variable costs (material and labor) are 40 cents per unit.

The goal is to find the optimal price that maximizes profit. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs (fixed + variable).

Let me think about how to model this. I should probably express the number of units sold as a function of the price. Let's denote the number of 1-cent increases as 'x'. So, each x represents a penny increase.

Wait, but price is in dollars, so maybe it's better to think in terms of dollars. Hmm, maybe I should model the price as $2 plus x dollars, where x is the number of 1-cent increases (so x would be in dollars, like 0.01, 0.02, etc.). Or maybe I can model it as x being the number of pennies, so price becomes 200 + x cents. Not sure yet, but let's go with the first approach.

So, the new price P would be 2 + 0.01x dollars. Because each x is a penny increase. And the quantity sold Q would be 2000 - 10x units. Because for each x increase, sales drop by 10 units.

Wait, let me confirm that. If x is the number of 1-cent increases, then each x adds one cent, so x=1 would be $2.01, x=2 is $2.02, etc. And for each x, Q decreases by 10. So yes, Q = 2000 -10x.

Now, total revenue (TR) is price times quantity: TR = P * Q = (2 + 0.01x)(2000 -10x).

Total cost (TC) is fixed cost plus variable cost per unit times quantity. So TC = 500 + 0.40 * Q. Since Q is 2000 -10x, TC =500 + 0.40*(2000 -10x).

Profit (π) is TR - TC. So I need to express π in terms of x and then find its maximum.

Let me compute TR first:

TR = (2 + 0.01x)(2000 -10x)
Multiply this out:

= 2*(2000) + 2*(-10x) + 0.01x*(2000) + 0.01x*(-10x)
= 4000 -20x +20x -0.1x²
Wait, the -20x and +20x cancel out, so TR =4000 - 0.1x².

Hmm, that's interesting. So TR is 4000 minus 0.1x squared.

Now, compute TC:

TC =500 + 0.40*(2000-10x)
=500 + 0.40*2000 -0.40*10x
=500 +800 -4x
=1300 -4x.

So profit π is TR - TC = (4000 -0.1x²) - (1300 -4x)
=4000 -0.1x² -1300 +4x
= (4000-1300) +4x -0.1x²
=2700 +4x -0.1x².

So π = -0.1x² +4x +2700.

This is a quadratic equation, and since the coefficient of x² is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex of a quadratic ax² +bx +c is at x = -b/(2a).

Here, a= -0.1, b=4.

So x = -4/(2*(-0.1)) = -4 / (-0.2) ) = 20.

So x=20. But wait, x is the number of 1-cent increases. So x=20 would mean a 20-cent increase. So the optimal price is $2 + 0.20 = $2.20 per unit.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes when setting up the equations, there might be a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck TR:

P = 2 + 0.01x

Q =2000 -10x

TR = (2 +0.01x)(2000 -10x) = 2*2000 +2*(-10x) +0.01x*2000 +0.01x*(-10x)
=4000 -20x +20x -0.1x². Oh yes, that's correct. So TR=4000 -0.1x².

TC: 500 + 0.4*(2000-10x) =500 +800 -4x =1300 -4x.

Profit π= TR - TC = (4000 -0.1x²) - (1300 -4x) =2700 +4x -0.1x².

So yes, the equation is correct. Then x=20.

So the price would be 2 + 0.01*20= 2.20 dollars.

Looking at the options, option F is $2.20. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me think about the quantity sold when x=20.

Q=2000 -10*20=2000-200=1800 units.

So selling 1800 units at $2.20 each.

TR would be 1800*2.20 = 3960.

TC: fixed 500 + variable 1800*0.40=720.

So total cost 500+720=1220.

Profit would be 3960-1220=2740.

Let me see if this is indeed the maximum. Let's try x=19 and x=21 to see if the profit is higher.

At x=19:

Price=2.19, Q=2000-190=1810.

TR=1810*2.19= Let's compute 1800*2.19=3942, 10*2.19=21.9, total 3963.9.

TC=500 +1810*0.40=500+724=1224.

Profit=3963.9-1224=2739.9.

Which is slightly less than 2740. So x=20 gives higher profit.

At x=21:

Price=2.21, Q=2000-210=1790.

TR=1790*2.21= Let's compute 1790*2=3580, 1790*0.21=375.9, total 3955.9.

TC=500 +1790*0.40=500+716=1216.

Profit=3955.9-1216=2739.9.

Again, less than at x=20.

So yes, x=20 is the maximum point.

Therefore, the optimal price is $2.20, which is option F.

To determine the price that maximizes the manufacturer's profit, we start by defining the price \( P \) and quantity sold \( Q \) as functions of the number of 1-cent increases (\( x \)):

- Price: \( P = 2 + 0.01x \) (in dollars)
- Quantity sold: \( Q = 2000 - 10x \) (in units)

### Total Revenue (TR)
Total revenue is calculated as:
\[
TR = P \cdot Q = (2 + 0.01x)(2000 - 10x)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
TR = 2 \cdot 2000 + 2 \cdot (-10x) + 0.01x \cdot 2000 + 0.01x \cdot (-10x)
\]
\[
TR = 4000 - 20x + 20x - 0.1x^2
\]
Simplifying:
\[
TR = 4000 - 0.1x^2
\]

### Total Cost (TC)
Total cost consists of fixed costs and variable costs:
\[
TC = 500 + 0.40 \cdot Q = 500 + 0.40 \cdot (2000 - 10x)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
TC = 500 + 800 - 4x
\]
Simplifying:
\[
TC = 1300 - 4x
\]

### Profit (π)
Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:
\[
\pi = TR - TC = (4000 - 0.1x^2) - (1300 - 4x)
\]
\[
\pi = 4000 - 0.1x^2 - 1300 + 4x
\]
\[
\pi = 2700 + 4x - 0.1x^2
\]

### Maximizing Profit
The profit function is a quadratic equation of the form \( \pi = -0.1x^2 + 4x + 2700 \), where the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative, indicating a downward-opening parabola. The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, given by:
\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]
Here, \( a = -0.1 \) and \( b = 4 \), so:
\[
x = -\frac{4}{2 \cdot (-0.1)} = \frac{4}{0.2} = 20
\]

Thus, \( x = 20 \), meaning the optimal price is:
\[
P = 2 + 0.01x = 2 + 0.01 \cdot 20 = 2.20
\]

### Verification
At \( x = 20 \):
- Price: \( P = 2.20 \)
- Quantity sold: \( Q = 2000 - 10 \cdot 20 = 1800 \)
- Total revenue: \( TR = 1800 \cdot 2.20 = 3960 \)
- Total cost: \( TC = 500 + 0.40 \cdot 1800 = 1220 \)
- Profit: \( \pi = TR - TC = 3960 - 1220 = 2740 \)

Checking \( x = 19 \) and \( x = 21 \) confirms that the profit is slightly lower in both cases, verifying that \( x = 20 \) maximizes the profit.

### Final Answer
The price that maximizes the manufacturer's profit is **$2.20**, corresponding to option **F**.
