Okay, so I have this question about forward contracts. Hmm, forward contracts are a type of financial derivative, right? They're agreements to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a specific date. I remember that the forward price is determined based on the spot price and some other factors like interest rates and dividends.

The question says it's a forward contract on a non-dividend paying stock. Oh right, so dividends don't come into play here. That simplifies things a bit. The stock's current price is $50, and the contract matures in 6 months. The interest rate given is 4% per annum. I think I need to calculate the forward price F.

Wait, how do you calculate the forward price? I recall there's a formula for it. For non-dividend paying stocks, the forward price is based on the cost of carry. The cost of carry includes the interest rate because you're essentially borrowing money to buy the stock now, and you'll earn interest if you invest.

The formula, if I remember correctly, is F = S * e^(r*T), where F is the forward price, S is the spot price, r is the risk-free interest rate, and T is the time to maturity in years. Oh wait, or is it S*(1 + r*T) for continuous compounding? Wait, wait. Another approach I remember is using the concept that the forward price should make the contract have zero value at initiation. 

So, the forward price F is set such that the present value of F equals the current stock price. Because if you enter the contract, you're committing to buy the stock at F in the future. The cost to carry the stock is the interest you'd pay on the money borrowed to buy it. 

Alternatively, the formula could be F = S * (1 + r*T). Since T is 6 months, which is 0.5 years. Let me plug in the numbers. S is $50, r is 4% or 0.04, T is 0.5. So F = 50*(1 + 0.04*0.5). Wait, 0.04 * 0.5 is 0.02. So 1 + 0.02 is 1.02. 50 multiplied by 1.02 is 51. So F would be $51.00. 

Wait, but another thoughtâ€”am I using the correct formula? Because sometimes I see it as F = S * e^(r*T), which is for continuous compounding. But in this case, the interest rate is given on a per annum basis, but it's not specified if it's simple or compounded. For such problems, I think we usually assume simple interest unless stated otherwise. So the formula would be F = S*(1 + r*T). 

Let me double-check the math. 4% per annum for 6 months is 2%, so 50 * 1.02 is indeed 51. So the forward price should be $51.00. Looking at the options, option B is 51.0. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but another angle: in some cases, the formula is F = S / (1 + r*T). No, that doesn't make sense here because that would be if you were discounting the future price back to present. But in a forward contract, the forward price is set so that the present value of the future obligation equals the spot price. So no, I think F = S*(1 + r*T) is correct because the buyer is paying more in the future.

Alternatively, think about arbitrage. If the forward price were higher than S*(1 + r*T), someone could short the stock, invest the proceeds, and on the maturity date, buy back the stock at F and make a risk-free profit. So the forward price must equate to S*(1 + r*T). 

Yes, that makes sense. So F is 51.00, which is option B.

The forward price \( F \) for a non-dividend paying stock is determined using the cost of carry formula, which accounts for the interest rate and time to maturity. The formula is:

\[
F = S \cdot (1 + r \cdot T)
\]

Where:
- \( S = \$50 \) (current stock price),
- \( r = 4\% = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( T = 6 \, \text{months} = 0.5 \, \text{years} \).

Plugging in the values:

\[
F = 50 \cdot (1 + 0.04 \cdot 0.5) = 50 \cdot (1 + 0.02) = 50 \cdot 1.02 = 51.00
\]

Thus, the forward price is \$51.00. This matches option **B**.
