Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about act jure gestionis, and I'm a bit confused. Let me think it through. I remember from my studies that jure gestionis has something to do with states acting in a private capacity. I think in international law, states can act in two ways: either as a state (jure imperii) or as a private entity (jure gestionis). 

So, jure imperii would be when the state is exercising its sovereign authority, like making laws, enforcing them, or conducting diplomatic missions. On the other hand, jure gestionis is when the state is doing something that a private person could also do, like buying or selling goods, entering into contracts, or engaging in commercial activities.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly defines acts jure gestionis. 

Option A says these are all actions by the State in a public capacity. Wait, that sounds more like jure imperii because public capacity implies sovereign functions.

Option B talks about government officials' conduct in their free time. I don't think that's right. Their personal actions don't necessarily represent the state's actions, whether jure gestionis or imperii.

Option C says acts jure gestionis are when the State acts in a private capacity. That aligns with what I remember. So C could be the correct answer.

Option D mentions international treaties being jure gestionis. Treaties are typically sovereign acts, so that's jure imperii, not gestionis. So D is incorrect.

Option E is about State court decisions. Courts are part of the judiciary, which is a public function, so that's jure imperii. Not E.

Option F refers to legislative decisions. Legislation is a classic example of sovereign authority, so jure imperii again. So F is wrong.

Option G states that all purchases by the State are jure gestionis. Purchasing, especially for commercial purposes, like buying supplies, could be jure gestionis. But wait, not all purchases. If it's related to a sovereign function, maybe not. But generally, purchases are private acts. So G might be correct, but I'm not sure because the option says "all purchases," which might be too broad.

Option H is about diplomatic missions. That's definitely a sovereign function, so jure imperii. H is wrong.

Option I refers to military actions. Military actions are state functions, so jure imperii. I is incorrect.

Option J says all acts by State corporations are jure gestionis. State corporations might engage in both types of acts. For example, if a state-owned company is selling goods, that's jure gestionis. But if it's involved in a sovereign function, maybe not. So J's option is too broad because it says "all," which isn't accurate.

So, between C and G. Option C says acts are in a private capacity, which is correct. G says all purchases are jure gestionis. While many purchases are, not all. For example, purchasing military equipment might be part of sovereign functions. So C is better because it's a general correct statement, whereas G is too absolute and potentially incorrect in some cases.

The correct answer is C. Acts jure gestionis occur when a State acts in a private capacity, such as engaging in commercial activities.
