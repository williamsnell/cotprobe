Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?

Options:

A: A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.
B: After consuming a large amount of alcohol at a party, a defendant decided to set a neighbor's car on fire out of spite. He was seen by witnesses and later arrested and charged with arson.
C: A defendant had been drinking at a local pub and got into a heated argument with another patron. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the other patron. The defendant is arrested and charged with attempted murder.
D: A defendant had consumed a fifth of bourbon. Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.
E: A defendant spent the evening drinking at a bar. On his way home, he broke into a house, intending to steal valuables. However, he fell asleep on the couch before he could steal anything. He was discovered by the homeowners and arrested and charged with attempted robbery.
F: At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.
G: A defendant was drinking at a bar when he noticed a woman leave her purse unattended. He stole the purse and was later arrested and charged with theft.
H: A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.
I: A defendant had been drinking heavily at a friend's house. Later that evening, he decided to drive home despite being significantly over the legal blood alcohol limit. On the way, he ran a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The defendant is arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter.
J: After a night of heavy drinking, a defendant broke into a jewelry store and stole several expensive items. He was caught on the store's surveillance cameras and later arrested and charged with burglary.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding when intoxication can negate criminal culpability. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is asking in which situation the defendant's intoxication would NOT be able to negate their criminal culpability. So, I need to find the case where the defendant's drunkenness isn't a valid defense against the crime charged.

First, I should remember the general rules about intoxication and criminal liability. I think that voluntary intoxication can sometimes be a defense, but it depends on the type of crime. For specific intent crimes, voluntary intoxication can negate the specific intent required. But for general intent crimes or crimes that don't require specific intent, intoxication usually isn't a defense.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. Conspiracy generally requires an agreement and intent to commit the crime. If the defendant was too drunk to form that intent, maybe intoxication could be used. But in this case, the defendant was plotting with buddies, so perhaps he did have the intent. Hmm, but the question is about when intoxication doesn't negate culpability. Maybe not the right answer.

Option B: Arson. Arson is typically a specific intent crime because you have to intentionally set fire to property. If too drunk, maybe couldn't form that intent. But if the defendant actually set the fire, maybe the intent can still be proven. Not sure yet.

Option C: Attempted murder. Attempted murder usually requires specific intent to kill. If intoxicated, maybe the defendant couldn't form that intent. But some jurisdictions might say that if the actions manifest an intent to kill, even while drunk, it's still culpable. Maybe this isn't the right case.

Option D: Assault with intent to commit rape. This is a specific intent crime because you need the intent to commit rape. If too drunk, maybe couldn't form that intent. So intoxication could be a defense here.

Option E: Attempted robbery. Attempt requires specific intent. If too drunk, maybe couldn't form the intent to commit robbery. But he broke in intending to steal, so maybe the intent was there before getting too drunk. Not sure.

Option F: Statutory rape. This is a strict liability crime. The issue is the age of consent. Intoxication isn't a defense because it's not about intent; it's about the fact that the victim is underage. So even if the defendant was drunk and thought she was older, it doesn't matter. So in this case, intoxication can't negate liability.

Option G: Theft. Theft requires intent to permanently deprive. If too drunk, maybe couldn't form intent. But if he took the purse, maybe the act itself shows intent. Not sure, but not the best option.

Option H: Assault with intent to commit battery. Battery is a general intent crime, I think. So intoxication wouldn't negate intent. Wait, no, assault might require intent to cause apprehension. If the defendant was so drunk he didn't realize, maybe. But I'm not certain.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter. This is typically a gross negligence crime. Intoxication can actually make it worse, showing recklessness. So intoxication wouldn't negate liability; in fact, it might increase it. So here, the defendant's drunkenness wouldn't be a defense.

Option J: Burglary. Burglary usually requires intent to commit a felony inside. If too drunk, maybe couldn't form that intent. So intoxication could be a defense.

So looking back, the question is where intoxication doesn't negate culpability. Option F is statutory rape, a strict liability offense. So even if drunk, it's no defense. Similarly, option I is vehicular manslaughter, which is a form of manslaughter, often involving gross negligence. Intoxication doesn't help there because it's about recklessness, not specific intent.

Wait, the question is about when intoxication doesn't negate culpability. So for specific intent crimes, intoxication can negate intent. For general intent, it usually doesn't. Also, for strict liability, it doesn't matter.

So in option F, statutory rape is strict liability, so intoxication is no defense. Similarly, in option I, vehicular manslaughter (which may be involuntary manslaughter), intoxication wouldn't negate because it's based on recklessness or negligence, not specific intent. But I'm not 100% sure which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is about situations where intoxication doesn't negate culpability. So when the crime doesn't require specific intent, or it's a strict liability offense.

Looking at each option:

Option F: Statutory rape is a strict liability crime. So intoxication is not a defense because it's about the minor's age, not the defendant's intent regarding age.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter. This is often considered a general intent crime or based on recklessness. So voluntary intoxication wouldn't negate the recklessness. In some cases, it might even be seen as aggravating.

So both F and I are possible, but looking at the options, which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question asks for the situation where intoxication would NOT be able to negate culpability. So which crimes don't allow intoxication as a defense.

Statutory rape is strict liability, so F would be correct. But I'm also thinking about specific intent vs general intent.

Wait, another thought: assault with intent to commit rape (option D) is a specific intent crime, so intoxication could negate intent. Similarly, conspiracy (A) requires specific intent. Arson (B) specific intent.

So in the options, F and I are the ones where intoxication doesn't help. But the question is which one is correct.

The question gives 10 options, and the answer is one of them.

In option F, the defendant is charged with statutory rape. The age of consent is 17, and the girl is 15 but looks older. But statutory rape doesn't care about the defendant's belief; it's strict liability. So intoxication doesn't matter. So F is a case where intoxication doesn't negate liability.

In option I, vehicular manslaughter: the defendant was driving drunk and caused death. Manslaughter can be voluntary or involuntary. Vehicular manslaughter is usually involuntary, which is based on recklessness or criminal negligence. Intoxication can't negate recklessness because being voluntarily intoxicated shows recklessness. So in this case, the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate culpability because the crime is based on recklessness, and intoxication supports that.

Wait, another angle: specific intent vs general intent. If the crime requires specific intent, intoxication can negate it. If it's general intent, it can't.

Vehicular manslaughter is a general intent crime? Or is it based on recklessness?

Involuntary manslaughter is typically a misdemeanor-based offense or recklessness. Recklessness is a subjective state. Wait, no, recklessness is an objective test in some cases. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe in the case of statutory rape (option F), intoxication can't be a defense because it's a strict liability offense regarding the age. So the correct answer would be F.

But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again.

Strict liability crimes don't require mens rea, so intoxication isn't a defense. So option F is such a case.

In contrast, option I is about vehicular manslaughter, which may require recklessness. But voluntary intoxication can't negate recklessness because getting drunk is itself reckless. So the defendant's intoxication wouldn't provide a defense.

Wait, but the question is about whether intoxication can negate culpability. So for recklessness, does intoxication negate it?

In general, voluntary intoxication can't negate recklessness because recklessness involves a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. If the defendant was too intoxicated to be aware, does that matter?

Wait, no. Recklessness is determined by whether a reasonable person would have been aware. So even if the defendant was too drunk to realize, if a sober person would have, then recklessness is established. So voluntary intoxication doesn't negate recklessness. Therefore, in option I, the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate culpability.

So both F and I are situations where intoxication doesn't negate culpability.

But the options only have one correct answer. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, the question is phrased as "would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?"

So for statutory rape (F), intoxication can't negate because it's strict liability. For vehicular manslaughter (I), it's because the crime is based on recklessness, which isn't negated by intoxication.

But looking at the answer options, which of these is presented.

The answer provided in the options is F and I as possible, but the correct answer is one of them.

I think the intended answer is F, because statutory rape is a strict liability offense, making it clear that intoxication is no defense. But I'm a bit uncertain between F and I.

Wait, another approach: looking for specific cases.

In the case of statutory rape, the defendant's belief about the victim's age is irrelevant because it's strict liability. Intoxication doesn't provide a defense.

In vehicular manslaughter, the defendant's intoxication would actually be used as evidence of recklessness, so it wouldn't negate liability. So in both F and I, intoxication doesn't negate liability, but which of the options is the correct answer.

Hmm, the question asks for which situation intoxication would NOT negate culpability. So both F and I are correct, but looking at the options, the answer choices are A-J.

Wait, looking back at the options, the answer is either F or I. But the question has only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option I. Let me think again: vehicular manslaughter can be charged as a misdemeanor manslaughter, which may require proving the underlying misdemeanor. But more commonly, it's based on reckless driving under the influence.

In any case, whether it's specific intent or recklessness, intoxication won't help. So both F and I seem to be correct, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because it's a strict liability offense, making it the clearest case where intoxication doesn't matter. Option I might involve recklessness, which could be another factor, but perhaps in some jurisdictions, intoxication could be a factor? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's a general intent crime, so intoxication doesn't negate. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, let's think about the Model Penal Code. Under the MPC, intoxication can negate intent only if it prevents the defendant from forming the required mens rea. For crimes requiring purpose (specific intent), intoxication can be a defense. For crimes requiring knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, it's generally not a defense, except in cases where the defendant was so intoxicated that they couldn't form the lower level of mens rea.

But statutory rape is a strict liability offense, which doesn't require any mens rea. So intoxication can't be a defense.

Vehicular manslaughter is often considered a form of involuntary manslaughter, which is usually based on recklessness or criminal negligence. Under the MPC, recklessness requires conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk. If the defendant was so intoxicated that they weren't aware, but a sober person would have been, then recklessness is still present. Therefore, intoxication doesn't negate recklessness. So in option I, intoxication wouldn't negate culpability.

So both F and I are situations where intoxication doesn't negate liability. But the question is asking for which situation among the options, which one is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread some.

Option F: statutory rape because the girl is 15, looks 25, and the defendant is drunk. Since it's statutory rape, it's strict liability, so intoxication doesn't matter.

Option I: vehicular manslaughter, which may be based on recklessness. So intoxication doesn't negate recklessness, so it doesn't negate liability.

So both are correct, but since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?"

So in F, the answer is yes—intoxication can't negate because it's strict liability. In I, yes—intoxication can't negate because it's recklessness.

But the question is asking for which option is such a case. So both F and I are correct, but the options provided only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the answer is F because it's a strict liability offense, making it the more obvious choice.

Alternatively, perhaps option I is the correct answer because vehicular manslaughter is a general intent crime, and intoxication doesn't negate general intent.

I think I'm getting stuck here, but I'll go with option F as the answer because statutory rape is a strict liability offense, making intoxication irrelevant. So the correct answer would be F.

To determine in which situation the defendant's intoxication would NOT be able to negate their criminal culpability, it is important to analyze the role of intoxication in relation to the type of crime charged. Intoxication can sometimes negate culpability for specific intent crimes but generally does not for general intent crimes or strict liability offenses.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

- **Option A (Conspiracy to commit robbery):** Conspiracy requires intent to agree and commit the crime. Intoxication could potentially negate the ability to form this intent, so it might be a defense here.

- **Option B (Arson):** Arson is a specific intent crime, requiring intent to set fire to property. Intoxication could negate the ability to form this intent, so it might be a defense.

- **Option C (Attempted murder):** Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill. Intoxication could negate the ability to form this intent, so it might be a defense.

- **Option D (Assault with intent to commit rape):** This is a specific intent crime, requiring intent to commit rape. Intoxication could negate the ability to form this intent, so it might be a defense.

- **Option E (Attempted robbery):** Attempt requires specific intent to commit the crime. Intoxication could negate the ability to form this intent, so it might be a defense.

- **Option F (Statutory rape):** Statutory rape is a strict liability offense, which does not require intent or mens rea. Intoxication cannot negate culpability because the crime is based solely on the age of the victim, regardless of the defendant's belief or intent.

- **Option G (Theft):** Theft requires intent to permanently deprive someone of property. Intoxication could negate the ability to form this intent, so it might be a defense.

- **Option H (Assault with intent to commit battery):** Assault generally requires intent to cause apprehension of harm. Intoxication might negate the ability to form this intent, so it could be a defense.

- **Option I (Vehicular manslaughter):** Vehicular manslaughter is typically based on recklessness or gross negligence. Voluntary intoxication does not negate recklessness because getting intoxicated is itself reckless behavior. Thus, intoxication would not negate culpability.

- **Option J (Burglary):** Burglary requires intent to commit a felony inside a structure. Intoxication could negate the ability to form this intent, so it might be a defense.

### Conclusion:
The question asks for the situation where intoxication would NOT be able to negate culpability. **Option F (Statutory rape)** is the correct answer because it is a strict liability offense, and intoxication cannot negate liability. While **Option I (Vehicular manslaughter)** also involves a situation where intoxication does not negate culpability (due to recklessness), statutory rape is the clearer and more direct example of a crime where intoxication is irrelevant to liability.
