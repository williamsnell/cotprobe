Question:

What do the results of studies with twins suggest about the influence of heredity on personality?

Options:

A: Heredity dictates personality completely, and the environment has no impact.
B: Identical twins raised apart will have completely different personalities due to environmental differences.
C: Personality traits are inherited in a fixed pattern, similar to physical traits like eye color.
D: Heredity determines intelligence, which in turn completely determines personality.
E: Heredity has no influence on personality.
F: Personalities are influenced only by peer interactions, not by heredity or family environment.
G: Fraternal twins have more similar personalities than identical twins due to shared environments.
H: Heredity provides a capacity for a wide range of behavior that may then be encouraged or sustained by the environment.
I: Environment solely determines personality traits.
J: Identical twins always have identical personalities.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about what twin studies suggest regarding heredity and personality. I remember from my psychology class that twin studies are often used to determine the influence of genetics versus environment on traits. 

The question is about the influence of heredity, so I'm thinking about the role of genetics in personality. I recall that identical twins share 100% of their genes, while fraternal twins share about 50% on average, similar to other siblings. So studies comparing these two groups can help figure out the genetic component.

I think the general consensus is that personality has a significant genetic component, but it's not the only factor. So environment also plays a role. I remember something about heritability estimates for personality traits being around 40-60%, meaning there's a substantial influence but not completely deterministic.

Looking at the options:

Option A says heredity dictates personality completely. That can't be right because the environment does have an impact, so A is probably wrong.

Option B says identical twins raised apart have completely different personalities. That doesn't make sense because if genetics play a role, they should have some similarities, so B is incorrect.

Option C suggests personality traits are inherited like eye color. But eye color is almost entirely genetic with little environmental influence, whereas personality is more of a mix, so C might not be the best choice.

Option D links intelligence to personality via heredity, but I don't think the studies suggest that intelligence completely determines personality. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E claims heredity has no influence, which contradicts what I remember from twin studies showing some genetic impact. So E is wrong.

Option F says only peer interactions matter. That ignores both genetics and family environment, which I think do play a role, so F is incorrect.

Option G says fraternal twins have more similar personalities than identical. That doesn't make sense because identical twins share more genes, so their personalities should be more similar on average. So G is wrong.

Option H states that heredity provides a capacity for behavior which is then influenced by the environment. That sounds familiarâ€”it's like a predisposition that can be shaped by experiences. This matches what I remember about the interaction between genetics and environment.

Option I says environment solely determines personality. No, because twin studies show genetics do play a role, so I is incorrect.

Option J claims identical twins always have identical personalities. But I know that even identical twins can have different personalities due to environmental factors, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be H. It reflects the idea that genetics provides a foundation, but the environment influences how those traits are expressed.

The correct answer is H. Twin studies suggest that heredity provides a predisposition or capacity for certain behaviors, which can then be influenced by environmental factors. This aligns with the understanding that personality is shaped by both genetic and environmental interactions, rather than being solely determined by either factor.

Answer: H
