Okay, so I've got this problem about uranium-238 decay, and I need to find the number of nuclei remaining after a certain time and the half-life. Hmm. Let me think.

Alright, part (a) is about finding the remaining nuclei after 1e8 years. I remember the formula for radioactive decay is N = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, t is time, and N0 is the initial number of nuclei.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I have all the numbers right. N0 is 1e25, right? And λ is given as 5e-18 per second. Oh wait, 5 times 10^-18. Oh, that's a really small decay constant, which makes sense for something with a long half-life like uranium.

So first, I need to calculate λt. Wait, t is given in years, so I have to convert that into seconds because λ is per second. Oh yeah, time units must match.

So one year is about 3.154e7 seconds. Let me calculate that. 365 days in a year, 24 hours, 60 minutes, 60 seconds. So 365 *24 = 8760 hours. 8760 *60=525600 minutes. 525600 *60=31,536,000 seconds, which is 3.1536e7 s. Approximately 3.15e7 s/year.

So the time t is 1e8 years. Multiply that by 3.15e7 seconds per year gives t in seconds. Let's compute that: 1e8 * 3.15e7 = 3.15e15 seconds.

Now, λ is 5e-18 per second. So λt is 5e-18 * 3.15e15. Let's calculate that exponent: 1e-18 * 1e15 = 1e-3. So 5 * 3.15 = 15.75, so 15.75e-3 is 0.01575.

Wait, so λt = 0.01575. Now, plug that into the exponential. e^-0.01575. I need to approximate this value. I remember that for small x, e^-x is approximately 1 -x + x²/2 etc. But since 0.01575 is small, maybe I can approximate e^-x ≈ 1 - x. Let's see.

Wait, but wait, 0.01575 is about 1.575%. So the error in the approximation might be acceptable. But maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that e^-0.015 is about 0.985, and e^-0.016 is about 0.984. So 0.01575 is about halfway between 0.015 and 0.016, so maybe around 0.9845 or so.

Alternatively, let me compute it more accurately. Using a calculator method: e^-x where x is 0.01575.

The Taylor series for e^-x is 1 - x + x^2/2 - x^3/6 + x^4/24 - ...

x = 0.01575
x^2 = (0.01575)^2 = approx 0.000248
x^3 = x^2 * x = 0.000248 * 0.01575 ≈ 0.000003906
x^4 = x^3 * x ≈ 0.0000000616

So e^-x ≈ 1 - 0.01575 + (0.000248/2) - (0.000003906/6) + (0.0000000616/24)

Calculate each term:

1 - 0.01575 = 0.98425

Adding 0.000248/2 = 0.000124 → 0.984374

Subtract 0.000003906/6 → 0.0000006513 → 0.98437335

Adding 0.0000000616/24 → approx 0.00000000256 → 0.98437335

So e^-0.01575 ≈ 0.98437 approximately. Let's say around 0.9844.

So N = N0 * e^(-λt) → 1e25 * 0.9844 = 9.844e24.

Wait, wait. Let me check my calculation for λt. Wait, t is 1e8 years, which is 1e8 * 3.15e7 = 3.15e15 seconds. So λt is 5e-18 * 3.15e15.

5e-18 * 3.15e15 = (5 * 3.15) * 1e-3 = 15.75 * 1e-3 = 0.01575. Correct.

So N is 1e25 * 0.98437 = 9.8437e24. So approximately 9.84e24.

Looking at the options, let's see which options have that. Looking at the options:

Option B: 8.4e24, part (a) is 8.4e24 which is lower than our calc.

Option D: 9.84e24, which matches closely. So for part (a), 9.84e24. So option D or I.

Wait, option I says 9.84e24 for part (a), but looking at the options, option D's part (a) is 9.84e24. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options show for each choice, the first number is part (a), the second is part (b). So looking for part (a) as 9.84e24.

Looking at the options:

Option D: a is 9.84e24, b is 4.5e9 years.

Option I: a is 9.84e24, b is 6.5e9.

Wait, but when I calculated N, it's 9.84e24, so the correct part (a) is that, so the options D, I have that.

Now part (b) is the half-life. I remember the half-life T_1/2 is related to λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ.

So let's compute that. T_1/2 = 0.6931 / (5e-18 s^-1).

Calculating that:

0.6931 / 5e-18 = (0.6931 /5) * 1e18 = 0.13862 * 1e18 = 1.3862e17 seconds.

Convert seconds to years. So how many seconds in a year? Approximately 3.15e7 s.

So T_1/2 = 1.3862e17 s / 3.15e7 s/year.

Compute 1.3862e17 / 3.15e7.

Divide 1.3862 by 3.15: approx 0.44, and the exponents are 1e17 /1e7 = 1e10. So 0.44e10 = 4.4e9 years.

So the half-life is approximately 4.4e9 years.

Looking at the options, let's see which has part (b) around 4.4e9.

Option D says part (b) is 4.5e9, which is close. Option B says 4.7e9, which is a bit higher. Option I says 6.5e9, which is higher.

So the correct option would have part (a) 9.84e24 and part (b) 4.5e9. So looking at the options, that's option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my T_1/2 calculation.

Wait, λ is 5e-18 per second. So λ = 5e-18 s^-1.

T_1/2 = ln(2)/(5e-18) = (0.693147)/(5e-18) = 1.38629e-1 / 1e-18 → wait, no:

Wait, 0.6931 divided by 5 is approximately 0.13862. So 0.13862e18 → 1.3862e17 seconds.

Convert to years: 1.3862e17 s / 3.154e7 s/year ≈ let's compute this.

3.154e7 is approximately 3.154 * 1e7.

So 1.3862e17 / 3.154e7 = (1.3862 / 3.154) ) * 1e10.

1.3862 / 3.154 ≈ let's compute:

3.154 goes into 1.3862 how many times? 3.154 * 0.44 is about 1.38784, which is a bit higher, so maybe 0.44 exactly.

Wait, 3.154 * 0.44 = 3.154*0.4=1.2616, 3.154*.04=0.12616 → total 1.38776.

But our numerator is 1.3862e17, which is a bit less than 1.38776e17. So 0.44 is an overestimation. Let's compute 1.3862 /3.154 ≈?

Let me compute 3.154 * x =1.3862, x=?

1.3862 /3.154 = ?

Let me compute 3.154 * 0.44=1.38776.

So 0.44 would give 1.38776, which is larger than 1.3862. So perhaps 0.439?

3.154 * 0.439 = 3.154*(0.4 + 0.03 +0.009)

0.4 *3.154=1.2616

0.03*3.154=0.09462

0.009*3.154=0.028386

Sum: 1.2616 + 0.09462 = 1.35622 + 0.028386=1.384606.

Which is close to 1.3862. So 0.439 gives 1.3846, which is about 1.3846, and we have 1.3862. So the difference is 1.3862 -1.3846=0.0016.

So how much more is needed? For each 0.001 added to x (which is 0.439 + 0.001=0.440), each 0.001 increase in x gives 3.154 *0.001=0.003154 increase in the product.

We need an additional 0.0016, so 0.0016 /0.003154 ≈ 0.507 of 0.001. So x ≈ 0.439 + 0.000507=0.4395.

So approximately 0.4395.

So 1.3862e17 /3.154e7 ≈ (0.4395) * 1e10 = 4.395e9 years.

So about 4.4e9 years, which is 4.4 billion years.

Looking at the options, option D says half-life is 4.5e9, which is very close. So that's the correct answer.

So part (a) is 9.84e24, and part (b) is 4.5e9. So the correct choice is option D.

To solve the problem, we use the radioactive decay formula:

\[
N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Part (a): Number of Uranium Nuclei Remaining
Given:
- Initial number of nuclei: \( N_0 = 10^{25} \)
- Decay constant: \( \lambda = 5 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)
- Time: \( t = 10^8 \, \text{years} \)

First, convert \( t \) to seconds:
\[
t = 10^8 \, \text{years} \times 3.154 \times 10^7 \, \text{s/year} = 3.154 \times 10^{15} \, \text{s}
\]

Calculate \( \lambda t \):
\[
\lambda t = (5 \times 10^{-18}) \times (3.154 \times 10^{15}) = 0.01575
\]

Now, compute \( e^{-\lambda t} \). For small \( x \), \( e^{-x} \approx 1 - x + \frac{x^2}{2} - \dots \). Using approximations or a calculator:
\[
e^{-0.01575} \approx 0.9844
\]

Finally, calculate \( N \):
\[
N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} = (10^{25}) \times 0.9844 = 9.844 \times 10^{24}
\]

### Part (b): Half-Life of Uranium
The half-life \( T_{1/2} \) is related to \( \lambda \) by:
\[
T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda = 5 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1} \):
\[
T_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{5 \times 10^{-18}} = 1.3862 \times 10^{17} \, \text{s}
\]

Convert to years:
\[
T_{1/2} = \frac{1.3862 \times 10^{17}}{3.154 \times 10^7} \approx 4.395 \times 10^9 \, \text{years}
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Part (a): \( N = 9.84 \times 10^{24} \)
- Part (b): \( T_{1/2} = 4.5 \times 10^9 \, \text{years} \)

The correct option is **D**.
