Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "Alexis is greeted by Ben." The given symbols are a for Alexis, b for Ben, and Gxy for x greets y. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. The sentence is in passive voice because it's saying that Alexis is the one being greeted, and Ben is doing the greeting. So the structure is subject (Alexis) being acted upon by the verb (greeted) by the agent (Ben).

Now, in predicate logic, the predicate Gxy is defined as x greets y. So Gxy would mean that x is the one doing the greeting, and y is the one being greeted. Wait, no, wait. Actually, in logic, the order matters. So Gxy is x greets y, which would mean that x is the subject (the one performing the action), and y is the object (the one being greeted). So for example, G(a,b) would mean a greets b, or Alexis greets Ben.

But the sentence here is "Alexis is greeted by Ben," which is the reverse. So Ben is greeting Alexis. So in terms of Gxy, that would be G(b,a) because Ben (b) is greeting Alexis (a). So the correct predicate would be G(b,a), which is read as b greets a.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: G(ab) – This looks like G is applied to a single term ab, which doesn't make sense because G takes two arguments, x and y. So this is incorrect.

B: aGb – This seems to be using infix notation, but I'm not sure if that's standard. Wait, in logic, usually predicates are written before the arguments, so G(a,b) would be correct if a greets b. But B is written as aGb, which might not be the right syntax. I think the correct form is G followed by the arguments in parentheses, like G(a,b). So B might not be the right way to write it.

C: aGba – Again, this seems off. It looks like a is the subject, then G, then b and a. But predicate logic usually uses prefix notation, so the predicate comes first, followed by the arguments. So this doesn't look right.

D: ~Gba – This is the negation of G(b,a), which would mean Ben does not greet Alexis. But the original sentence is stating that Ben does greet Alexis, so D is the opposite.

E: Gba – This would be G(b,a), which is exactly what we want. Because G(b,a) translates to Ben greets Alexis, which is the same as Alexis is greeted by Ben.

F: Gaa – This would mean a greets a, so Alexis greets herself, which isn't the case here.

G: Gab – G(a,b) means Alexis greets Ben, but the sentence says Ben greets Alexis, so this is the opposite.

H: Gb~a – This seems to be G(b, ~a), which would mean Ben greets not a, which doesn't make sense. The negation is misplaced here.

I: Gbb – This would mean Ben greets himself, which isn't the case.

J: Ga/b – I'm not sure what this syntax means. It looks like G(a/b), which might be dividing a by b, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

So the correct answer should be E: Gba, which correctly represents Ben greeting Alexis.

The sentence "Alexis is greeted by Ben" needs to be translated into predicate logic using the given symbols: a (Alexis), b (Ben), and Gxy (x greets y). The sentence is in passive voice, where Ben (b) is the one performing the greeting, and Alexis (a) is the one being greeted. Therefore, the correct predicate logic expression is G(b,a), which is written as Gba.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: G(ab)** – Incorrect, as G takes two separate arguments, not a single term.
- **B: aGb** – Incorrect, as it uses non-standard infix notation.
- **C: aGba** – Incorrect, as it misplaces the predicate and arguments.
- **D: ~Gba** – Incorrect, as it negates the greeting.
- **E: Gba** – Correct, as it represents Ben greeting Alexis.
- **F: Gaa** – Incorrect, as it implies Alexis greets herself.
- **G: Gab** – Incorrect, as it implies Alexis greets Ben.
- **H: Gb~a** – Incorrect, as it misapplies negation.
- **I: Gbb** – Incorrect, as it implies Ben greets himself.
- **J: Ga/b** – Incorrect, as it uses invalid syntax.

The best translation is **E: Gba**.
