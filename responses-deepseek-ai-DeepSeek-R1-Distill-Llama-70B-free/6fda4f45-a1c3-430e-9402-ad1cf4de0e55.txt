Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about determining the required sample size for estimating the mean strength of a part. The quality engineer wants to be 98% confident that the maximum error is 0.25. They took a preliminary sample of 32 parts, which gave a mean of 35.68 and a standard deviation of 1.723. And the question is asking how large a sample is needed.

Hmm, I remember that when calculating sample size for estimating a mean, the formula involves confidence interval and margin of error. The margin of error (E) is given as 0.25, and the confidence level is 98%, which I think corresponds to a certain Z-score.

Wait, the formula for the sample size n is n = (Z * σ / E)^2, but since the population standard deviation σ is unknown, we use the sample standard deviation s instead. So in this case, we'd use s = 1.723.

First, I need to find the Z-score for a 98% confidence level. The confidence level is the probability that the true mean lies within the interval. So for 98%, I think that leaves 2% in the tails, which is 1% on each side since it's two-tailed.

I remember that Z-scores for confidence levels are found using the standard normal distribution. For 98% confidence, the Z value is the one that leaves 1% in each tail. I think the Z-score for 98% is around 2.33 or something. Wait, let me recall: 90% is 1.645, 95% is about 1.96, 99% is around 2.576. Oh wait, 98% is somewhere between 95% and 99%. Maybe I should check a Z-table or remember the exact value.

Wait, I think the Z-score for 98% confidence is approximately 2.33. Or was it 2.326? Because I recall that 95% is 1.96, 97.5% is around 1.96 as well? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, the formula for the Z-score when the confidence level is C is Z = norm.inv((1 - C/100)/2, 0, 1) in Excel, but since I don't have Excel, I'll have to rely on memory or a table.

Wait, 98% confidence. So alpha is 0.02, and the two-tailed alpha/2 is 0.01. So the Z-score is the value such that P(Z > z) = 0.01. From standard normal tables, the Z for 0.99 cumulative probability is about 2.33. Let me confirm:

Z=2.33 corresponds to about 0.9901 in the standard normal table, so that's correct. So Z is approximately 2.33.

Now, the formula for the required sample size n is:

n = (Z * s / E)^2

Plugging in the numbers:

Z = 2.33
s = 1.723
E = 0.25

So let's compute Z*s first: 2.33 * 1.723.

Let me calculate that:

2 * 1.723 is 3.446. 0.33 * 1.723 is approximately 0.568. So total is about 3.446 + 0.568 = 4.014.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

2.33 * 1.723:

Let me compute 2 * 1.723 = 3.446

Then 0.33 * 1.723:

0.3 * 1.723 = 0.5169

0.03 * 1.723 = 0.05169

Adding those gives 0.5169 + 0.05169 = 0.56859

So total is 3.446 + 0.56859 = 4.01459.

So Z*s is approximately 4.0146.

Then, divide that by E, which is 0.25:

4.0146 / 0.25 = 16.0584

Then square it: (16.0584)^2.

Hmm, 16 squared is 256. 0.0584 squared is negligible, but to compute accurately:

16.0584 * 16.0584.

Let me compute 16 * 16 = 256.

16 * 0.0584 = 0.9344

0.0584 * 16 = 0.9344

0.0584 * 0.0584 is about 0.0034.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=16, b=0.0584.

So (16 + 0.0584)^2 = 16² + 2*16*0.0584 + (0.0584)^2.

16² is 256.

2*16*0.0584 = 32 * 0.0584 = Let's compute 32 * 0.05 = 1.6 and 32 * 0.0084 = 0.2688. So 1.6 + 0.2688 = 1.8688.

(0.0584)^2 is approximately 0.0034.

So total is 256 + 1.8688 + 0.0034 ≈ 257.8722.

So n ≈ 257.8722.

Since sample size must be an integer and we can't have a fraction of a sample, we round up to the next whole number, which is 258.

But wait, looking at the options, option F is 257, which is very close to 258. But sometimes, depending on rounding during calculations, it might come to 257. Let me check my calculations again to make sure.

Wait, maybe the exact Z-score is a bit different. Perhaps I should use a more precise Z-value. For example, the exact Z for 98% confidence. Let me think, maybe it's 2.326 instead of 2.33. Because I remember that for 95%, it's 1.96, and for 99% it's 2.576. So 98% is likely around 2.326.

Wait, another approach: the Z-score for 98% confidence is the value where the cumulative probability is 0.99 (since 98% confidence leaves 1% in each tail). So looking at standard normal table:

At Z=2.33, the cumulative is about 0.9901, which is very close to 0.99.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator: the exact value for 98% confidence is Z = 2.326 (since 1 - 0.98/2 = 0.99).

Wait, let me think again. For a 98% confidence interval, the area in the middle is 98%, so each tail has 1%. So the Z-score is the value where the area to the left is 0.99. Which is exactly 2.326 in the standard normal distribution.

Yes, so Z is 2.326, not 2.33. Let me recalculate with that.

So Z = 2.326.

Compute Z * s = 2.326 * 1.723.

Let me compute it step by step.

2 * 1.723 = 3.446.

0.326 * 1.723:

Compute 0.3 * 1.723 = 0.5169.

0.02 * 1.723 = 0.03446.

0.006 * 1.723 = 0.010338.

Adding those: 0.5169 + 0.03446 = 0.55136 + 0.010338 = 0.5617.

So total Z*s = 3.446 + 0.5617 = 4.0077.

Now divide by E, which is 0.25: 4.0077 / 0.25 = 16.0308.

Now square that: (16.0308)^2.

16^2 = 256.

0.0308^2 ≈ 0.000948.

And 2 * 16 * 0.0308 = 0.9856.

So 256 + 0.9856 + 0.000948 ≈ 256.9865.

So approximately 256.9865, which is about 257.

So n ≈ 257. So the required sample size is 257.

Looking at the options, option F is 257.

But wait, sometimes, the calculation might require rounding up. Because the sample size must be an integer, and if the calculation is 256.98, which is very close to 257, you'd round up to 257. So the answer should be 257.

So the correct option is F:257.
</think>

To determine the required sample size for estimating the mean strength of the left hinge, we use the formula for sample size:

\[
n = \left(\frac{Z \cdot s}{E}\right)^2
\]

Where:
- \( Z \) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.
- \( s \) is the sample standard deviation.
- \( E \) is the maximum error (margin of error).

### Step 1: Determine the Z-score
The confidence level is 98%, which means the area in the tails is \( \alpha = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 \), or \( \alpha/2 = 0.01 \) in each tail. From the standard normal distribution, the Z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.99 is approximately \( Z = 2.326 \).

### Step 2: Plug in the values
Given:
- \( Z = 2.326 \)
- \( s = 1.723 \)
- \( E = 0.25 \)

First, calculate \( Z \cdot s \):
\[
Z \cdot s = 2.326 \cdot 1.723 = 4.0077
\]

Next, divide by \( E \):
\[
\frac{Z \cdot s}{E} = \frac{4.0077}{0.25} = 16.0308
\]

Finally, square the result to find \( n \):
\[
n = (16.0308)^2 = 256.9865
\]

Since the sample size must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
\[
n = 257
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The closest option to the calculated sample size is **F: 257**.
