Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about garden peas. Let's see what it's asking for. I remember that when dealing with data, calculating mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation are common tasks. The question gives me a sample of 13 plants with their heights in centimeters. 

First, I need to list out all the numbers to work with them. The data provided is: 161, 183, 177, 157, 181, 176, 180, 162, 163, 174, 179, 169, 187. Wait, let me make sure I got all of them. Let me count—oh yeah, that's 13 numbers.

Starting with part (a), the mean. To calculate the mean, I sum all the values and divide by the number of observations, which is 13 here. So I'll add them up one by one.

Let's add sequentially:
161 + 183 = 344
344 +177 = 521
521 +157 = 678
678 +181 = 859
859 +176 = 1035
1035 +180 = 1215
1215 +162 = 1377
1377 +163 = 1540
1540 +174 = 1714
1714 +179 = 1893
1893 +169 = 2062
2062 +187 = 2249

Wait, let me check that again because adding so many numbers can be error-prone. Let me do it step by step:

Numbers in order: 157, 161, 162, 163, 169, 174, 176, 177, 179, 180, 181, 183, 187.

Wait, I think I might have misread the initial data. Let me clarify the data set. The given data is: 161, 183, 177, 157, 181, 176, 180, 162, 163, 174, 179, 169, 187.

So adding them:

157 +161 = 318
318 +183 = 501
501 +177 = 678
678 +181 = 859
859 +176 = 1035
1035 +180 = 1215
1215 +162 = 1377
1377 +163 = 1540
1540 +174 = 1714
1714 +179 = 1893
1893 +169 = 2062
2062 +187 = 2249.

So sum is 2249. Mean is 2249 divided by 13. Let's compute that. 2249 ÷13.

13 × 172 = 2236 (because 13 ×170=2210, plus 13×2=26 → 2210+26=2236)
2249 -2236 =13. So 172 + (13/13)=173. So the mean is 173 cm.

Wait, wait, 13×173=2249. Yes, so mean is 173 cm.

Now part (b), the median. To find the median, I need to arrange the data in order and find the middle value. Since there are 13 data points, the median will be the 7th value when sorted.

Let me sort the data:

Let me list all the numbers again:

157, 161, 162, 163, 169, 174, 176, 177, 179, 180, 181, 183, 187.

Wait, arranging in order:

157 is the smallest. Then 161, then 162, 163, then 169, 174, 176, 177, 179, 180, 181, 183, 187.

So position 7 is 177. So median is 177 cm.

Wait, no, let me recount. Let me number them:

1: 157
2: 161
3: 162
4: 163
5: 169
6: 174
7: 176 → Wait, did I miss any?

Wait my initial list after sorting is:

157, 161, 162, 163, 169, 174, 176, 177, 179, 180, 181, 183, 187.

So the 7th is 176. Because positions 1-13:

1:157, 2:161, 3:162, 4:163, 5:169, 6:174, 7:176, 8:177, 9:179,10:180,11:181,12:183,13:187.

Ah, so median is 176 cm. Wait, earlier I thought the median was 177, but when I sort correctly, it's 176. So I must have made a mistake in the initial arrangement.

Wait, maybe I need to recount the sorted list.

Wait the given data is: 161,183,177,157,181,176,180,162,163,174,179,169,187.

So let's write them all down and sort correctly.

List of heights:

161, 183, 177, 157, 181, 176, 180, 162, 163, 174, 179, 169, 187.

Sorting them in ascending order:

Start with the smallest:

157 (1st)

Next, 161 (2nd)

Then 162 (3rd)

163 (4th)

169 (5th)

174 (6th)

176 (7th)

177 (8th)

179 (9th)

180 (10th)

181 (11th)

183 (12th)

187 (13th)

So the 7th term is 176. Hence, median is 176 cm.

Wait, but in the options, the medians vary. Let me check the options again. Looking for mean 173, median 176.

Looking at the options:

Option J: Mean 173, Median 176, Mode:176-180, etc. Let's check others.

Option J says median 176. So that's a possible candidate.

Now part (c), the mode. The mode is the most frequently occurring value. Looking at the data: 157, 161, 162, 163, 169, 174, 176, 177, 179, 180, 181, 183, 187.

Each of these values appears once. So there is no mode. But looking at the options, all the options have a mode as a range. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, perhaps the data is grouped into intervals, but the given data is individual values. Hmm.

Wait, the question says to calculate the mode. If all values are unique, mode doesn't exist. But the options give ranges like 174-179, etc. So perhaps the data is grouped into classes, and the modal class is the one with the highest frequency.

Wait, the original data is a list of 13 individual plant heights. So each is a single value. So mode would be the value that occurs most often. Since all are unique, mode is none. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial data. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the data given is: 161 183 177 157 181 176 180 162 163 174 179 169 187. So each is a single number. So all occur once. So mode is none. But the options don't have that. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the data is misread. Let me check again. The original data is written as "161183177157181176180 162163174179169187". Oh, perhaps I miscounted the numbers.

Wait, perhaps the data is: 161, 183, 177, 157, 181, 176, 180, 162, 163, 174, 179, 169, 187. That's 13 numbers, each unique. So no mode. But the options don't have mode as 'none'. So perhaps the question expects the modal class, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I've miscounted and there are duplicates. Let me check each number:

Looking through the list:

161, 183, 177, 157, 181, 176, 180, 162, 163, 174, 179, 169, 187.

Each appears once. No duplicates. So mode doesn't exist. But the options all have a mode, so perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the given data is for 13 plants, but perhaps some have same heights. Let me recheck the data:

The data as given: 161, 183, 177, 157, 181, 176, 180, 162, 163, 174, 179, 169, 187. Each is unique. So mode is none. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question meant something else.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to group them into intervals, like 160-165, 165-170, etc., and then find the modal class. But the question gives individual data points, not grouped. So perhaps the mode is not applicable, but the options are expecting a class.

Alternatively, maybe the mode is the most frequent value, but since none repeat, perhaps the mode is the middle value? I'm a bit confused. Let me proceed to other parts and see.

Part (d) and (e): variance and standard deviation.

Variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

First, I need to compute each (x_i - mean)^2, sum them, divide by n (since it's a sample, but sometimes divided by n-1. Wait, the question says it's a sample, so variance would be sample variance, using n-1. Let me confirm.

Wait, variance can be population variance (divided by n) or sample variance (divided by n-1). Since the question says it's a random sampling, so it's a sample. So for sample variance, use n-1.

So steps:

1. Calculate mean (already done: 173 cm).

2. For each data point, subtract mean and square the result.

3. Sum all these squared differences.

4. Divide by (n-1) → 12, to get sample variance.

5. Standard deviation is sqrt(variance).

So let's compute each term.

The data points sorted: 157, 161, 162, 163, 169, 174, 176, 177, 179, 180, 181, 183, 187.

Compute each (x_i - 173)^2:

157: (157-173)= -16 → 256

161: (161-173)= -12 → 144

162: -11 →121

163: -10 →100

169: -4 →16

174: +1 →1

176: +3 →9

177: +4 →16

179: +6 →36

180: +7 →49

181: +8 →64

183: +10 →100

187: +14 →196

Now, sum all these squared differences.

Let me list them:

256, 144, 121, 100, 16, 1, 9, 16, 36, 49, 64, 100, 196.

Adding them step by step:

Start with 256.

256 +144 =400

400 +121=521

521 +100=621

621 +16=637

637 +1=638

638 +9=647

647 +16=663

663 +36=699

699 +49=748

748 +64=812

812 +100=912

912 +196=1108.

So sum of squared differences is 1108.

Variance is 1108 divided by 12 (n-1=13-1=12).

1108 /12 = let's compute:

12 ×92 = 1104 → 92 with remainder 4. So 92 + (4/12) = 92.333... So variance is approximately 92.333 cm².

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the variances are exactly 92.33. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the squared terms. Let me recheck each calculation.

List of (x_i - 173)^2:

157: (157-173)=-16→256

161: -12 →144

162: -11 →121

163: -10 →100

169: -4 →16

174: +1 →1

176: +3 →9

177: +4 →16

179: +6 →36

180: +7 →49

181: +8 →64

183: +10 →100

187: +14 →196

Wait, let's re-add these:

256 +144 = 400

+121 →521

+100 →621

+16 →637

+1 →638

+9 →647

+16 →663

+36 →699

+49 →748

+64 →812

+100 →912

+196 →1108.

Yes, sum is 1108. Variance is 1108/12 = 92.333... cm².

Standard deviation is sqrt(92.333) ≈ 9.607 cm.

Looking at the options, let me check which ones have variance around 92.33 and std dev ~9.61.

Looking at option J: Variance 92.33 cm², std dev 9.61 cm. Yes, that's what I have.

So far, for option J, mean is 173, median 176, mode 176-180, variance 92.33, std dev 9.61.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the mode is none because all values are unique. So why does option J have mode as 176-180? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question groups the data into intervals, and the mode is the interval with the most data points.

Wait, the original data isn't grouped. So perhaps the question assumes that each number is in a class of 5 cm, like 160-165, 165-170, etc. Let me count how many fall into each interval.

Let me create intervals of 5 cm:

160-165: 161,162,163 →3 data points.

165-170: 169 →1.

170-175: 174 →1.

175-180:176,177,179,180 →4.

180-185:181,183 →2.

185-190:187 →1.

Wait, so the interval with the most data points is 175-180 with 4. So the modal class is 175-180. But option J says mode is 176-180. Hmm, perhaps the intervals are defined differently, like 175-180 is 175-180, but option J says 176-180. So perhaps it's a typo, but let me check the intervals again.

Wait, perhaps the intervals are 170-175, 175-180, etc. But in that case, 175-180 would have 176,177,179,180 →4 points, which is the highest.

So the modal class is 175-180. But option J says the mode is 176-180, which is a 4 cm interval? Or perhaps the intervals are 5 cm starting at 160.

Wait, maybe the intervals are 160-165, 165-170, 170-175, 175-180, 180-185, 185-190.

In that case, 175-180 has four values:176,177,179,180.

So the mode is the 175-180 interval.

But option J says mode is 176-180. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the data points in 175-180 are 176,177,179,180. So that's four points.

The next highest is 160-165 with three points.

So the modal class is 175-180. So in the options, the mode is given as a range, so looking for 175-180.

Looking at the options:

Option J: Mode 176-180. Hmm, that's a 5 cm interval? Or maybe it's a typo.

Wait, perhaps the question intended the mode as the most frequent single value, but since all are unique, perhaps the closest option is considering the range. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier with the median.

Wait, the median was 176 cm, so perhaps the mode is the range around that. But I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the mode to be the median's interval. But I'm not sure.

Given that, looking back at the options, option J matches the mean (173), median (176), variance (~92.33), and std dev (~9.61). So I think option J is the correct choice.

So the answer should be J.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the given data set of plant heights:  
161, 183, 177, 157, 181, 176, 180, 162, 163, 174, 179, 169, 187.  

### (a) Mean  
The mean is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of observations.  
Sum = \( 157 + 161 + 162 + 163 + 169 + 174 + 176 + 177 + 179 + 180 + 181 + 183 + 187 = 2249 \).  
Mean = \( \frac{2249}{13} = 173 \, \text{cm} \).

### (b) Median  
To find the median, the data is sorted:  
157, 161, 162, 163, 169, 174, 176, 177, 179, 180, 181, 183, 187.  
Since there are 13 data points, the median is the 7th value:  
Median = \( 176 \, \text{cm} \).

### (c) Mode  
The mode is the value that appears most frequently. However, all values in the data set are unique, so there is no mode.  
If the data is grouped into intervals (e.g., 160-165, 165-170, etc.), the interval 175-180 contains the most values (176, 177, 179, 180). Thus, the modal class is 175-180.  
In the options, the mode is approximated as 176-180, which aligns with this result.

### (d) Variance  
Variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.  
For each data point \( x_i \), compute \( (x_i - \text{mean})^2 \):  
\[
\begin{align*}
(157-173)^2 &= 256, \\
(161-173)^2 &= 144, \\
(162-173)^2 &= 121,
