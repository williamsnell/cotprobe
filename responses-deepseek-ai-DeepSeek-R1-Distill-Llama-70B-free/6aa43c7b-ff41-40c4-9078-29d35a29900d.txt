Question:

A heavyset man with long red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a man was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged

Options:

A: admissible as a prior identification by the witness.
B: inadmissible, due to the potential for bias or suggestion.
C: admissible as past recollection recorded.
D: admissible, as it is the owner's personal account of the event.
E: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.
F: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
G: inadmissible, as it is based on a photograph and not a live lineup.
H: admissible, as it provides critical evidence for the case.
I: inadmissible, because the owner failed to identify the man in court.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

Alright, the scenario is about a robbery. A heavyset man with long red hair robbed a liquor store. Then, a man was arrested and charged. At his trial, the liquor store owner testified. The owner said he couldn't identify the man in court because the man now had a shaven head. So, the defendant's appearance has changed since the robbery—shaved head versus long red hair. That makes sense why the owner can't identify him now.

Then the prosecuting attorney hands the owner six photographs. The owner is going to testify that he previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, which is a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was the robber. The defense objects, and we need to determine if this testimony is admissible.

The options are A through J, but looking at the options, I see A to I. So, the possible answers are A to I.

I remember that when a witness can't testify about something in court, the prosecution might try to use prior statements. But there are rules about that, like under the hearsay rule and exceptions.

So, the owner can't identify the defendant in court because he's changed his appearance. That’s a problem for the prosecution because they need to establish that the defendant is the one who committed the robbery.

The prosecutor wants the owner to testify about a prior identification he made from the photographs. So, the issue is whether that prior identification is admissible.

I think about the rules of evidence. There's something about prior identification being admissible if the witness can't remember in court. But also, the confrontation clause might come into play because the defendant has the right to confront witnesses against him.

Wait, the prior identification, like a photo lineup, has specific rules. If the witness made an identification in a lineup, that can be admitted if the witness is present in court and subject to cross-examination. But if the witness can't remember, then the prior statement can be used to refresh their memory or as a recorded recollection.

Wait, in this case, the owner is testifying that he previously identified picture #4 as the robber. But he can't identify the defendant in court because of the changed appearance. So, the prosecution is offering his prior statement to prove that the defendant is the robber.

But is that prior statement hearsay? Because the statement is being offered for the truth of the matter—that the defendant is the robber. So, yes, it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

I recall that under FRE 801(d)(1)(A), prior statements by a witness who is subject to cross-examination can be admissible as non-hearsay if they were given under oath at a prior proceeding. But wait, the prior statement here was made to the prosecuting attorney, not in a prior proceeding. So that exception might not apply.

Another exception could be past recollection recorded under FRE 803(5). But for that, the witness must forget the information on the stand, and a record made at the time can be used to refresh their memory. The problem is that the owner isn't forgetting the event; he's just unable to identify the defendant now because of the change in appearance. So maybe that's not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe it's a prior identification under a different rule. I think FRE 801(d)(1)(C) deals with identification of a person after perceiving them, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Or perhaps it's about the admissibility of prior identifications when the witness can't make one in court.

Wait, I remember that if a witness is unable to make an identification in court, prior identifications can be admitted if certain conditions are met. But there's also the issue of whether the prior identification was made under circumstances that indicate it's reliable.

But another angle is the Confrontation Clause. Crawford v. Washington says that statements made by a witness who isn't testifying can't be used unless the defendant had a chance to cross-examine. Here, the witness is testifying, so maybe it's allowed. But wait, the prior statement is being used as evidence, so it's a hearsay issue more than confrontation.

Wait, another point: the prior identification is part of the res gestae or present sense impression, but that might not fit here because the identification was made during a lineup after the fact, not immediately.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible under the rule that allows a witness to use a prior consistent statement to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. But I don't think that applies here because the issue isn't that the owner's testimony is being impeached as a recent fabrication.

Wait, maybe the prior identification is non-hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth. But no, the prosecutor is offering it to show that the owner identified the defendant as the robber, which is for the truth of the matter. So it's hearsay.

So, if it's hearsay, we need an exception. The prior identification could fall under the exception for statements of identification under FRE 801(d)(1)(C). That says that a statement is not hearsay if it's a statement of identification of a person made after perceiving him, and the statement was made under circumstances indicating the declarant's belief in the person's identity. But wait, the prior statement here was made to the prosecutor, so it's a statement of identification after perceiving the photo, perhaps.

Wait, but the owner's prior statement was made when looking at the photo, so that would be an identification under 801(d)(1)(C). However, that exception requires that the declarant (the owner) testify at trial and be subject to cross-examination. In this case, the owner is testifying, so that condition is met.

So, under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), the prior identification is admissible as non-hearsay because it's a statement of identification made by a witness who is testifying and subject to cross.

So, looking at the options, option A says it's admissible as a prior identification by the witness. That would fit because the owner is testifying and made the identification before.

But wait, another point—does this apply when the witness can't identify the person in court? I think yes, because 801(d)(1)(C) doesn't require the witness to make an identification in court, just that they made the statement before and are now testifying about it. So, even if they can't make the identification now, the prior statement is admissible.

Wait, but in some cases, the court might require that the witness have some recollection when using the prior identification. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. If the witness can't identify the person in court at all, does that affect the admissibility of the prior statement?

I think the rule is that even if the witness can't recall, the prior identification is still admissible under 801(d)(1)(C). Because the statement was made when the witness had a fresh memory, and now they can't remember. So, the prior statement stands as a statement of identification.

So, option A says it's admissible as a prior identification, which fits.

Alternatively, option E says it's inadmissible because of the confrontation clause. But since the witness is testifying and subject to cross-examination, the confrontation clause isn't violated. Crawford allows statements where the declarant is testifying.

So, putting it all together, the owner's prior identification is admissible under 801(d)(1)(C), so the answer is A.

Wait, but in the question, the owner is being handed the photos during trial and is going to testify about his prior identification. So, the prior statement is being offered through the owner's current testimony, not as an out-of-court statement. So, perhaps it's not hearsay at all because the owner is testifying about his prior statement. Wait no, because the prior statement is being offered for the truth of the matter, so it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

But under 801(d)(1)(C), it's non-hearsay. So the testimony is admissible as a prior identification.

So the correct answer should be A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's prior identification of a defendant. The liquor store owner, who cannot identify the defendant in court due to his changed appearance, is being asked to testify about a prior identification he made from a set of photographs. The key issue is whether this prior identification is admissible under the rules of evidence.

The prior identification was made when the owner selected picture #4, which depicts the defendant before he shaved his head. This statement is being offered for the truth of the matter—that the defendant was the robber—and thus constitutes hearsay unless an exception applies. 

Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(1)(C), a statement of identification is not considered hearsay if it was made by a witness who perceived the person and believed in their identity at the time. This rule applies here because the owner made the identification while viewing the photographs, and he is now testifying in court, subject to cross-examination. The fact that the owner cannot identify the defendant in court does not bar the admissibility of the prior identification, as the rule does not require the witness to make an in-court identification.

Additionally, the Confrontation Clause is not violated because the owner is testifying and subject to cross-examination, allowing the defendant to challenge the identification. Therefore, the prior identification is admissible as non-hearsay under FRE 801(d)(1)(C).

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: admissible as a prior identification by the witness.**

This conclusion aligns with the rules of evidence and the specific circumstances of the case.
