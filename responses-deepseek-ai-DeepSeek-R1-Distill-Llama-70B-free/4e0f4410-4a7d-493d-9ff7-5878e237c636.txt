Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about difference feminism, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about feminism theories, specifically difference feminism.

From what I remember, difference feminism is a branch that emphasizes the differences between men and women, arguing that these differences should be recognized and valued rather than ignored. It's kind of the opposite of the more traditional equality feminism, which focuses on making men and women equal in rights and opportunities, sometimes by minimizing differences.

So, the central thesis of difference feminism is that men and women are fundamentally different in more than just physical aspects. These differences extend to their thought processes, values, and approaches to issues like justice and morality. They argue that these differences should be acknowledged and that each gender's unique perspectives should be considered.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that best captures this idea. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: 'Difference feminism argues that men and women are fundamentally the same.' Wait, that doesn't sound right. Difference feminism is about differences, not sameness. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: 'Men are unable to comprehend their differences from women.' Hmm, that seems more like a statement about understanding, not the central thesis. It's a bit too specific about comprehension rather than the nature of differences.

Option C: 'Men and women differ only in physical attributes, not in their thought processes.' No, difference feminism says there are more than just physical differences. So C is incorrect because it limits differences to physical traits.

Option D: 'Men are more inclined towards justice, while women tend to focus on fairness.' This is interesting. I think I've heard something about Carol Gilligan's work where she talks about men focusing on justice and women on care or fairness. That might align with difference feminism, but I'm not sure if this is the central thesis or just one aspect.

Option E: 'There are fundamental differences between individual women.' This seems more about diversity among women rather than between men and women. So E doesn't fit the thesis which is about gender differences.

Option F: 'Women are more focused on equality, while men prioritize freedom.' This sounds more like a generalization but doesn't capture the essence of difference feminism's central idea.

Option G: 'Feminism is about eradicating differences between men and women.' No, that's more like equality feminism. Difference feminism doesn't want to eradicate differences; they want to acknowledge them.

Option H: 'Men and women have different conceptions of the feminist project.' I'm not sure about this. It's possible, but I'm not certain if this is the central thesis.

Option I: 'Women and men have identical perspectives on justice.' Definitely not, since difference feminism argues they have different perspectives.

Option J: 'Women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice.' This rings a bell. I think this relates to the idea that women might consider the specific circumstances and relationships in moral decision-making, while men might rely more on abstract principles. This seems to highlight a fundamental difference in approach, which aligns with difference feminism.

So, putting it all together, the central thesis is about inherent differences in perspectives and approaches between men and women. Option J seems to reflect that by stating that women consider context while men use abstract justice notions.

The central thesis of difference feminism emphasizes that men and women have inherent differences in their perspectives and approaches, particularly in areas like justice and morality. Option J captures this by stating that women focus on context while men rely on abstract notions of justice, aligning with the idea that these differences should be recognized and valued.

Answer: J
