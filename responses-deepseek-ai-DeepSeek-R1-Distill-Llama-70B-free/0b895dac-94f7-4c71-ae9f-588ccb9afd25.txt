Okay, so I've got this question about PKU and how to prevent the mental retardation associated with it. Hmm, I remember PKU stands for Phenylketonuria. It's a genetic disorder, right? So, from what I learned, PKU affects the body's ability to process a certain amino acid called phenylalanine. If that builds up, it can cause problems, especially in the brain, leading to intellectual disabilities if not treated early.

The question is asking what's the preventive measure for the mental retardation caused by PKU. Let me look at the options. A is hormone replacementâ€”I don't think that's related. B is surgery, which doesn't seem right for a metabolic issue. C is psychotherapy, which is more about mental health, not the root cause. D is vitamin supplements. Wait, I'm not sure. PKU is about phenylalanine metabolism, so maybe diet is the key.

Oh wait, I think the treatment for PKU is a strict low-protein diet to avoid phenylalanine. But the options don't mention diet. So maybe the next best thing is something else. Let me think again. Oh, there's something called newborn screening where they test for PKU and then manage the diet early. But the question is about preventing the retardation.

Wait, another thought. I remember that in some cases, supplements might include something that helps metabolize phenylalanine. Or maybe it's about managing the levels. Oh, wait, but the main treatment is dietary restriction. Since the options don't have diet, perhaps the next best answer is D: vitamin supplements? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle. PKU is caused by a defect in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Without that enzyme, phenylalanine can't be converted into tyrosine. So, maybe the treatment involves something that helps lower phenylalanine levels. I've heard about a substance called sapropterin, which is a form of vitamin B9 (folate), used in some cases. So, that would be a vitamin supplement. So option D might be correct.

Alternatively, gene therapy (option G) is a possibility, but I don't think it's widely used yet. So the established method is dietary control, but the options don't have that. So the next best answer would be vitamin supplements, specifically if we're talking about using something like sapropterin. Or perhaps it's about ensuring the diet is supplemented with necessary nutrients because they have to avoid so many foods.

Wait, another thought. The question is about prevention. So early diagnosis and dietary management are key. But if the options don't include diet, perhaps the answer is D, because vitamins are part of the management. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Another approach: the mental retardation is due to high phenylalanine levels. Preventing it would mean lowering those levels. The standard treatment is a low-protein diet, but again, not an option. So, looking at the options, none directly say diet, but perhaps the answer is G: gene therapy. But gene therapy isn't a standard treatment yet, more experimental. So maybe the intended answer is D.

Wait, wait! I also remember that newborns with PKU are often started on a special formula that's low in phenylalanine. But formula is a type of dietary adjustment, not exactly a vitamin supplement. So perhaps the answer isn't D. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to something else.

Wait, another thought: tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is used in some cases of PKU. It's a cofactor for the enzyme. So, it's a supplement, but is it a vitamin? I'm not sure. BH4 is sometimes categorized under vitamin supplements. So if the question refers to that, then D would be correct.

Alternatively, if PKU management doesn't involve vitamins, then perhaps the answer is something else. But I'm pretty sure that vitamin supplements are part of the management, especially in cases where the diet alone isn't sufficient or to help with the enzyme function.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is D: vitamin supplements.

The mental retardation associated with PKU is preventable with:

PKU (Phenylketonuria) is a genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. If untreated, excessive phenylalanine can lead to intellectual disabilities. The standard treatment involves a strict low-protein diet to manage phenylalanine levels. However, the question does not include diet as an option. Among the provided choices, vitamin supplements are relevant because certain supplements, such as tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), are used to help manage PKU by acting as a cofactor for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This makes vitamin supplements the most appropriate answer.
