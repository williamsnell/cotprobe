Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychotherapies and self-disclosure by the psychologist. Hmm, I remember that self-disclosure refers to when the therapist shares their own thoughts or feelings with the client. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each option.

The question is asking which therapy specifically recommends and frequently uses self-disclosure. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Object relations therapy. I think this is more about the client's internalized relationships and how they relate to others. The therapist might use techniques like interpretation but I'm not sure if self-disclosure is a big part here.

Option B: Play Therapy. This is usually for kids, right? The therapist uses play to help the child express themselves. I don't recall self-disclosure being a key technique here since the focus is on the child's play.

Option C: Interpersonal therapy. This focuses on improving interpersonal relationships. The therapist might work on communication skills and address issues in the client's relationships. I'm not certain if self-disclosure is a main technique, but maybe they do share some things to model behavior.

Option D: Narrative Therapy. This approach helps clients rewrite their life stories. The therapist might collaborate with the client but I don't think they disclose much about themselves. It's more about the client's narrative.

Option E: Transactional analysis. This involves analyzing transactions between the ego states (Parent, Adult, Child). The therapist might use some self-disclosure to explain their own ego states, but I'm not sure if it's a primary technique.

Option F: Dialectical Behavior Therapy. This is more about teaching coping skills and emotional regulation. The therapist might share some strategies but I don't think self-disclosure is a core method here.

Option G: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT is about identifying and changing negative thought patterns. The therapist is more of a guide, teaching techniques. I don't remember self-disclosure being emphasized much here.

Option H: Feminist psychotherapy. This approach emphasizes equality and collaboration between therapist and client. I think self-disclosure might be used to reduce the power imbalance and build trust. So this could be a candidate.

Option I: Gestalt Therapy. I remember that Gestalt therapists encourage awareness in the present moment. They might use techniques like empty chair or role-playing. Also, I think they do use self-disclosure more than other therapies because they focus on the therapeutic relationship and authenticity.

Option J: Exposure Therapy. This is a behavioral technique where clients are exposed to feared objects to reduce anxiety. The therapist's role is more about guiding the exposure, so self-disclosure doesn't seem relevant here.

Now, narrowing it down. I think Gestalt Therapy (I) and Feminist psychotherapy (H) are possibilities. Gestalt emphasizes the therapist's genuine response, which would involve self-disclosure. Feminist therapy also values self-disclosure to create a more equal relationship.

Wait, let me think again. In Gestalt therapy, the therapist might share their own feelings or observations about the client's behavior to increase awareness. That's a key part of the approach. So self-disclosure is specifically recommended here.

Feminist therapy does use self-disclosure too, to empower the client and acknowledge the therapist's own experiences, but I'm not sure if it's as central as in Gestalt. Also, the question asks which one is "specifically recommended and frequently applied." Gestalt comes to mind because of the emphasis on the therapeutic relationship and authenticity.

So the answer is probably I: Gestalt Therapy.

The question asks which psychotherapy specifically recommends and frequently applies self-disclosure by the psychologist. Self-disclosure refers to the therapist sharing their own thoughts or feelings with the client. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Object Relations Therapy (A):** Focuses on internalized relationships and interpretations, not self-disclosure.
- **Play Therapy (B):** Involves children and play, with no emphasis on therapist self-disclosure.
- **Interpersonal Therapy (C):** Focuses on improving relationships, but self-disclosure isn't a core technique.
- **Narrative Therapy (D):** Centers on the client's life story, not therapist self-disclosure.
- **Transactional Analysis (E):** Analyzes ego states but doesn't primarily use self-disclosure.
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (F):** Teaches coping skills, not focused on self-disclosure.
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (G):** Guides cognitive changes without emphasizing self-disclosure.
- **Feminist Psychotherapy (H):** Values collaboration and may use self-disclosure to reduce power imbalances, but it's not as central as in other therapies.
- **Gestalt Therapy (I):** Emphasizes authenticity and the therapeutic relationship, with self-disclosure being a key technique to increase client awareness.
- **Exposure Therapy (J):** Focuses on behavioral exposure, not self-disclosure.

Gestalt Therapy stands out because it specifically recommends and frequently uses self-disclosure to enhance authenticity and awareness in the therapeutic relationship. While Feminist Psychotherapy also uses self-disclosure, it is not as central to the approach as it is in Gestalt Therapy.
