Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the declining-balance method. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the company bought machinery for $15,000, and it's expected to last six years with no residual value. They want to use the maximum percentage allowable under the declining-balance method. I remember that declining-balance is a type of accelerated depreciation, where you take a higher depreciation in the early years and less later on.

Wait, the maximum percentageâ€”oh right, for declining balance, the typical rates are like 200% or 150% of the straight-line rate. Since the machinery's life is six years, the straight-line rate would be 1/6, which is approximately 16.67%. So the maximum percentage for declining balance would be double that, 33.33%? Because 200% of straight-line is 2*(1/6) = 0.3333 or 33.33%. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the formula for depreciation each year is Book Value * Depreciation Rate. And each year, the book value decreases by the depreciation taken. But wait, in the declining balance method, you don't depreciate the full amount in the last year if it would take the book value below zero. But since it's six years and we're looking at the first three, maybe that's not an issue yet.

Let me start calculating year by year.

Year 1: The initial book value is $15,000. Depreciation is 15,000 * 33.33%. Let me compute 33.33% of 15,000. 0.3333 * 15000 = 5000? Wait, wait, 15,000 divided by 3 is 5,000. So yes, 5,000. So after year 1, book value is 15,000 - 5,000 = 10,000.

Year 2: Now the book value is 10,000. Depreciation is 10,000 * 33.33% = 3,333.33. So approximately $3,333. So the book value becomes 10,000 - 3,333.33 = 6,666.67.

Year 3: Book value is now 6,666.67. Depreciation is 6,666.67 * 0.3333. Let me compute that, 6,666.67 * 1/3 is about 2,222.22. So depreciation is $2,222.22, and the book value becomes 6,666.67 - 2,222.22 = 4,444.45.

Wait, looking at the options, do any of them match these numbers? Let me check the options.

Option B says Year 1: $5,000, Year 2: $3,333, Year 3: $2,222. That matches exactly with what I calculated. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes the maximum rate could be different based on conventions. Like, for a six-year life, is the safe rate 20% or 25%? Wait, no, because 1/6 is approximately 16.67%, so 200% would be 33.33%. So that's correct.

Alternatively, some tables use the 200% declining balance, which for six years would have an 33.33% rate. So yeah, that calculation seems right. So option B is the correct one. The depreciation for each of the first three years is 5k, then 3,333, then 2,222.
</think>

To determine the depreciation and book value for the first three years using the declining-balance method, we start with the following information:

- **Initial Cost of Machinery**: $15,000  
- **Useful Life**: 6 years  
- **Residual Value**: $0  
- **Depreciation Method**: Declining-balance with the maximum allowable rate.

### Step 1: Determine the Depreciation Rate
The declining-balance method uses a rate that is a multiple of the straight-line rate. The straight-line rate is calculated as:

\[
\text{Straight-line rate} = \frac{1}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667 \, (16.67\%).
\]

For the maximum allowable rate under the declining-balance method, we use **200% of the straight-line rate**:

\[
\text{Declining-balance rate} = 2 \times 0.1667 = 0.3333 \, (33.33\%).
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Depreciation and Book Value for Each Year
The depreciation for each year is calculated as the book value at the beginning of the year multiplied by the depreciation rate. The book value is then updated by subtracting the depreciation for that year.

1. **Year 1**:
   - Initial Book Value: $15,000  
   - Depreciation: \( 15,000 \times 0.3333 = 5,000 \)  
   - Book Value: \( 15,000 - 5,000 = 10,000 \).

2. **Year 2**:
   - Book Value: $10,000  
   - Depreciation: \( 10,000 \times 0.3333 = 3,333.33 \)  
   - Book Value: \( 10,000 - 3,333.33 = 6,666.67 \).

3. **Year 3**:
   - Book Value: $6,666.67  
   - Depreciation: \( 6,666.67 \times 0.3333 = 2,222.22 \)  
   - Book Value: \( 6,666.67 - 2,222.22 = 4,444.45 \).

### Step 3: Match with the Options
From the calculations:
- **Year 1 Depreciation**: $5,000  
- **Year 2 Depreciation**: $3,333  
- **Year 3 Depreciation**: $2,222  

This matches **Option B**: Year 1: $5,000, Year 2: $3,333, Year 3: $2,222.

### Final Answer:
B
