Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the molecular weight of a gas. Let's see what the question says. The gas has a density of 2.50 g per liter at 98 degrees Celsius and 0.974 atm. Hmm, right, I remember that molecular weight relates to the ideal gas law somehow.

Wait, I think the formula used here is the one that connects density, pressure, temperature, and molecular weight. Oh right, the ideal gas equation can be written in terms of density. The formula is d = (PM)/(RT), where d is density, P is pressure, M is molar mass (molecular weight), R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

So first, I need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. Let's calculate that. 98°C plus 273.15 gives me 371.15 K. Got that down.

Next, I should probably make sure I have all the values in the right units. The density is given in g/L, which is the same as grams per liter. Pressure is in atm, and R is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), which matches the units here.

Now, plugging the known values into the formula. We're solving for M, so rearranging the formula gives M = (dRT)/P.

Let me jot down the numbers:
d = 2.50 g/L
R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)
T = 371.15 K
P = 0.974 atm

So calculating the numerator first: d multiplied by R multiplied by T.

2.50 * 0.0821 = let's see, 2 times 0.0821 is 0.1642, 0.5 times 0.0821 is 0.04105, so adding them gives 0.20525. Then multiply by T (371.15).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2.50 * 0.0821 is 0.20525. Then multiply that by 371.15.

0.20525 * 371.15. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me compute that step by step.

Let's break 371.15 into 300 + 70 + 1.15. So 0.20525 * 300 is 61.575. 0.20525 *70 is 14.3675. 0.20525 *1.15 is approximately 0.236. Adding those together: 61.575 +14.3675 is 75.9425, plus 0.236 gives about 76.1785.

So the numerator is approximately 76.1785 g·atm/(mol·K) * K? Wait, no, let me think about units again. Wait, d is g/L, R is L·atm/(mol·K), T is K, so when you multiply d*R*T, the units are (g/L) * (L·atm/(mol·K)) * K = g·atm/mol. Oh, right.

So the numerator is 76.1785 g·atm/mol. Then we divide by pressure, which is 0.974 atm. So M = 76.1785 / 0.974.

Calculating that division: 76.1785 / 0.974. Hmm. Let me approximate. 0.974 is almost 1, but a little less. So 76 / 0.974 is about 76 / 0.97, which is roughly 78.3. Wait, wait a second, better to compute accurately.

Let me compute 76.1785 divided by 0.974. Maybe do it as follows:

0.974 times 78 is 75.972 (because 0.974 * 70=68.18, 0.974*8=7.792 → 75.972). 76.1785 is a bit more than 75.972. So 78 would give 75.972. The difference is 76.1785-75.972=0.2065. Now, how much more than 78 do we need? So 0.2065 / 0.974 per additional 1 in M. So 0.2065 / 0.974 ≈ 0.212. So M is approximately 78.212.

Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 76.1785 / 0.974 more accurately.

Let me try long division. 76.1785 ÷ 0.974.

Alternatively, note that 0.974 ≈ 1 - 0.026. But maybe an alternative approach: 76.1785 / 0.974 = (76.1785 * 1000) / (0.974 * 1000) ) = 76178.5 / 974.

Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write 76.1785 ÷ 0.974.

Let me approximate:

0.974 × 78 = 75.972 → as before.

So 78 gives 75.972. The remaining is 76.1785 -75.972=0.2065.

So 0.2065 /0.974 = approx 0.2118.

So total M ≈78.2118, so approximately 78.21 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option H is 78.1 g, which is very close. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I make any errors in calculation?

Wait, in the step where I multiplied d * R * T:

d=2.50 g/L, R=0.0821, T=371.15 K.

2.50 * 0.0821 = 0.20525.

0.20525 * 371.15 = let me compute that again accurately.

0.20525 * 371.15.

Let's compute 0.2 * 371.15 =74.23.

0.00525 *371.15. 0.005 *371.15=1.85575, 0.00025*371.15=0.0927875. So 1.85575 +0.0927875=1.9485375.

Adding to 74.23 gives 74.23 +1.9485375=76.1785375.

So 76.1785 g·atm/(mol·K) * K → 76.1785 g·atm/mol.

Divide by pressure 0.974 atm.

76.1785 /0.974 = let's compute this exactly.

Let me compute 76.1785 ÷ 0.974.

Let me write 0.974 as 974/1000.

So 76.1785 * (1000/974) = (76178.5 /974) → let me compute 974 ×78 = 75,972. So 78 gives 75,972.

Subtract 75,972 from 76,178.5 → 76,178.5-75,972=206.5.

So 206.5 /974 → approximately 0.2118.

So total is 78.2118, which is approximately 78.21 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option H is 78.1. Which is very close. So the answer is H.

To determine the molecular weight (M) of the gas, we use the formula derived from the ideal gas law:

\[
d = \frac{PM}{RT}
\]

Rearranging for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{dRT}{P}
\]

### Given Data:
- Density (\( d \)) = 2.50 g/L
- Pressure (\( P \)) = 0.974 atm
- Temperature (\( T \)) = 98°C = 371.15 K (converted from Celsius to Kelvin)
- Gas constant (\( R \)) = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

### Calculation:
1. **Calculate the numerator (\( dRT \)):**
   \[
   dRT = 2.50 \times 0.0821 \times 371.15
   \]
   - \( 2.50 \times 0.0821 = 0.20525 \)
   - \( 0.20525 \times 371.15 = 76.1785 \, \text{g·atm/mol} \)

2. **Divide by pressure (\( P \)) to find \( M \):**
   \[
   M = \frac{76.1785}{0.974} \approx 78.21 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated molecular weight is approximately 78.21 g/mol. Among the given options, the closest value is **78.1 g**, which corresponds to **option H**.
