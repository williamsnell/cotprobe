Okay, so I've got this question about fiscal policy and what to do during a recession. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that fiscal policy involves the government using spending and taxation to influence the economy. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

Alright, the question is asking what the appropriate fiscal policy is to remedy a recession. The options are from A to J, each suggesting different combinations of government spending and tax changes.

I recall that during a recession, the economy is in a slump. People are losing jobs, businesses aren't making money, so they're not investing. So the goal would be to stimulate the economy, right? The government can do this by increasing aggregate demand. How? Well, through fiscal policy, which includes government spending and taxes.

So, when the economy is in a recession, the government should probably increase its spending. Because when the government spends more, it creates demand for goods and services, which can create jobs and get the economy moving again. For example, building infrastructure projects or funding public services.

On the taxation side, I think cutting taxes would also help. If people have more money in their pockets because taxes are lower, they might spend more. That increased consumer spending would further boost aggregate demand. Alternatively, the government could cut business taxes to encourage investment, but I'm not sure if that's as effective in the short term.

Wait, but some of the options involve both increasing spending and cutting taxes. I think that would be the most expansionary approach. Because increasing spending directly adds to demand, and cutting taxes gives the private sector more money to spend or invest.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Increase spending and taxes. That might not be good because higher taxes could reduce disposable income, which might offset the benefits of increased government spending. So maybe not the best choice.

Option B: Reduce spending and increase taxes. Oh, that sounds like austerity, which would probably make the recession worse by reducing demand further.

Option C: Increase taxes without changing spending. That would take money out of people's pockets, leading to less spending. Doesn't seem right for a recession.

Option D: Keep everything the same. But that's not taking action to address the recession, so it's not helpful.

Option E: Reduce spending and taxes. Lower taxes could help, but cutting spending at the same time might be counterproductive. It depends on the balance, but I'm not sure this is the best approach.

Option F: Reduce taxes without changing spending. That would put more money in people's pockets, which is good. But without increasing government spending, maybe the stimulus isn't as strong as it could be.

Option G: Increase spending and reduce taxes. This seems like the classic expansionary fiscal policy. Both measures aim to boost aggregate demand, so this should be the right approach.

Option H: Decrease spending and increase taxes. This is contractionary, so it's the opposite of what's needed.

Option I: Increase spending without changing taxes. That would add demand through government purchases, but not address the private sector's disposable income. Still, it's better than nothing, but maybe not as effective as also cutting taxes.

Option J: Reduce spending without changing taxes. That would probably make things worse since lower spending would reduce demand.

So putting it all together, the best option is G: increase government spending and reduce taxes. That way, both the government and the private sector contribute to higher aggregate demand, helping pull the economy out of recession.

The appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession involves increasing aggregate demand to stimulate economic activity. During a recession, the government should adopt an expansionary fiscal policy. This can be achieved by increasing government spending, which directly creates demand for goods and services, and reducing taxes, which increases disposable income and encourages consumer spending and investment. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Increasing both spending and taxes could offset the benefits of higher spending due to reduced disposable income.  
- **B**: Reducing spending and increasing taxes would worsen the recession by further decreasing demand.  
- **C**: Increasing taxes without changing spending would reduce disposable income and consumer spending.  
- **D**: Maintaining current levels does nothing to address the recession.  
- **E**: Reducing spending and taxes might help slightly through tax cuts, but cutting spending is counterproductive.  
- **F**: Reducing taxes without changing spending boosts disposable income but lacks the direct demand injection from increased government spending.  
- **G**: Increasing spending and reducing taxes is the most effective approach, as it boosts demand through both government and private sector activity.  
- **H**: Decreasing spending and increasing taxes is contractionary and harmful during a recession.  
- **I**: Increasing spending without tax changes helps but is less effective than also reducing taxes.  
- **J**: Reducing spending without changing taxes worsens the recession by lowering demand.  

The best choice is **G**, as it combines increased government spending with tax reductions, providing a comprehensive stimulus to the economy.
