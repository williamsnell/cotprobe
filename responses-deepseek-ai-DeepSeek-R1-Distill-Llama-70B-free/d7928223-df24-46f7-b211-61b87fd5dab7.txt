Okay, so I've got this question about vitamins and cooking. Hmm. The question is asking which vitamins are lost most readily during cooking. The options are A through J, each pairing different vitamins.

I remember that vitamins can be affected by cooking, especially when it comes to water-soluble ones. Wait, water-soluble vitamins like the B vitamins and vitamin C are more likely to be lost in water when you cook, like boiling vegetables. Because they dissolve in water and the cooking water is often discarded.

So looking at the options, I need to find a pair that includes these. Let's go through them.

Option A: vitamin C and thiamin. Oh, right, thiamin is another name for vitamin B1. Both are water-soluble. So this seems like a good candidate.

Option B: niacin and riboflavin. Those are B3 and B2, also water-soluble. So they might be lost too, but are they the ones lost most readily?

Option C: riboflavin and vitamin C. Both are correct, but I think the question is about which pair is the most readily lost, not just any two.

Wait, the question is which are lost most readily. I think vitamin C is one of the most easily destroyed. Heat and water cause it to break down. Thiamin is also sensitive to heat and water. So maybe A is better.

Option D: vitamin A and riboflavin. Vitamin A is fat-soluble, so it's not as affected by cooking in water. So probably not this one.

Option E: vitamin B and D. Hmm, that's a bit vague. Vitamin B is a complex, but also, vitamin D is fat-soluble. So maybe not the best choice.

Option F: B6 and B12. Both are water-soluble, yes, but are they the most readily lost? I think B vitamins in general can be lost, but I'm not sure if these are the top two.

Option G: D and E, both fat-soluble, so less likely to be lost with cooking in water.

Option H: B12 and folic acid. Both are water-soluble. Folic acid is another one that's lost when cooking. But I thought vitamin C is more prominent in being lost.

Option I: E and niacin. Again, niacin is B3. Not sure.

Option J: A and K. Both fat-soluble, so less likely.

So the options with water-soluble vitamins are A, B, C, F, H.

The question is about which are lost most readily. I think vitamin C and thiamine are the primary ones because they're very sensitive. So the answer should be A.

The vitamins most readily lost during cooking are those that are water-soluble, as they dissolve in water and can be discarded with cooking liquids. Vitamin C is particularly sensitive to heat and water, and thiamin (vitamin B1) is also easily lost under similar conditions. Among the options provided, the pair that best represents these readily lost vitamins is **vitamin C and thiamin**.

Answer: A
