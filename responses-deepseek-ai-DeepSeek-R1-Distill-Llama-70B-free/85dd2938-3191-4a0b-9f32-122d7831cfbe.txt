Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. The question says that the change in Gibbs energy for a certain constant-pressure process fits the expression ΔG/J equals -85.40 plus 36.5 times (T/K). I need to find the value of ΔS for the process. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that Gibbs free energy is related to entropy and enthalpy. Oh right, the equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, that's under constant temperature, right? Or is it more general? Well, maybe in this case, since the process is constant-pressure, I can use that equation.

But the question gives me an expression for ΔG as a function of temperature. So ΔG = (-85.40 + 36.5(T)) J. Let me write that out in terms of J, T in K. So ΔG = -85.40 J + 36.5 J*(T/K)*something? Wait, no, let me look. The expression is ΔG divided by J equals that, but that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, the way it's written is ΔG/J = -85.40 + 36.5*(T/K). Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe the equation is ΔG = (-85.40 + 36.5*(T)) J? Because the units are in J on the left side.

Wait, the original expression is written as ΔG / J equals something. So maybe it's ΔG = (-85.40 + 36.5*(T/K)) * J? That would make sense. So ΔG = (-85.40 + 36.5*(T)) ) J? Because T is in K, so 36.5*(T/K) would be unitless, multiplied by J. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, no, maybe the equation is written with T in numerator, so it's 36.5*(T/K). So the entire term is unitless, making the whole expression in J. So yeah, ΔG in J is -85.40 plus 36.5*(T/K).

But I'm trying to find ΔS. So I need to relate ΔG to ΔS. Let me think about the relation between ΔG and ΔS. Oh right, another equation comes to mind: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, that's the Gibbs free energy equation at constant temperature and pressure, right? So if I can find ΔH from this expression, I can then find ΔS.

Wait, but the given equation is ΔG as a function of T. Let me write it again:

ΔG = (-85.40 + 36.5*(T/K)) J.

So that's ΔG = (-85.40 + 36.5*(T)) J? Wait, because T is in K, so T/K is unitless. So yes.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express ΔG in terms of T. Let me write it as ΔG = a + b*T, where a is a constant and b is the coefficient of T.

So in this case, a is -85.40 J and b is 36.5 J/K.

But wait, the Gibbs equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Hmm. So if I have ΔG in terms of T, then perhaps I can compare this to the general equation.

Wait, let's see. The general equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. So if I write this as ΔG = (ΔH) + (-ΔS) * T. So that's linear in T. Comparing this to the given expression, which is ΔG = (-85.40 J) + (36.5 J/K)*T.

Wait, so in the general equation, the coefficient of T is (-ΔS). So comparing to the given, which has a positive 36.5 J/K as the coefficient. So that would mean that -ΔS = 36.5 J/K.

Wait, no, in the given expression, the coefficient is positive. So from the general equation, the coefficient of T is (-ΔS). So if the given expression's coefficient is 36.5 J/K, then (-ΔS) = 36.5 J/K. So solving for ΔS would give ΔS = -36.5 J/K.

Wait, but that would make the entropy change negative. Let me make sure I'm getting the signs right.

Wait, the general equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. So rearranged, that's ΔG = ΔH + (-TΔS). So when expressed as a function of T, the slope is (-ΔS). So in the given problem, the slope (the coefficient of T) is 36.5 J/K. So:

slope = -ΔS => 36.5 = -ΔS => ΔS = -36.5 J/K.

So looking at the options, option E is -36.5 J K^-1. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check. So the given ΔG is a linear function of T with a positive slope. Since the slope is -ΔS, that would make ΔS negative. So that's correct.

Another way to think about it: if the process is such that increasing T increases ΔG, then the entropy change must be negative because ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. So if T increases and ΔG increases, then the term involving T, which is TΔS, must be negative. So ΔS must be negative. Therefore, the correct option is E.

To solve the problem, we start with the given expression for the change in Gibbs energy:

\[
\Delta G / \text{J} = -85.40 + 36.5 \cdot (T / \text{K}),
\]

which implies:

\[
\Delta G = -85.40 \, \text{J} + 36.5 \, \text{J/K} \cdot T.
\]

The Gibbs free energy equation is:

\[
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S.
\]

By comparing this with the given expression, we can identify the coefficients. The constant term \(-85.40 \, \text{J}\) corresponds to \(\Delta H\), and the coefficient of \(T\), \(36.5 \, \text{J/K}\), corresponds to \(-\Delta S\). Thus:

\[
-\Delta S = 36.5 \, \text{J/K}.
\]

Solving for \(\Delta S\), we find:

\[
\Delta S = -36.5 \, \text{J/K}.
\]

This matches option **E**. The negative value of \(\Delta S\) indicates that the entropy decreases during the process.
