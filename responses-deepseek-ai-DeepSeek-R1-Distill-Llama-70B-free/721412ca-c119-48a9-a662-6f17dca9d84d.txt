Question:

Mr. Haskell has decided to buy a rental property. The building costs $50,000 and the land costs $30,000. The annual rent income is estimated to be $10,450 and the annual expense, $3,200. Mr. Haskell plans to depreciate the building by the straight line method over 40 years. Mr. Haskell wants to choose the best of three investment plans. Plan A Pay the full $80,000 from personal account. Plan B Borrow $30,000 and pay $50,000 from personal account. Rate of interest is 4(1/2)%. Plan C Borrow $60,000 and pay $20,000 from personal account. Rate of interest is 5 (1/4)%. If the tax rate is 40%, which investment plan has the highest rate of return?

Options:

A: Plan B, if the interest rates drop to 3%
B: Plan A, if the tax rate decreases to 30%
C: Plan A
D: Plan C, assuming rental income increases by 5% annually
E: Plan C
F: None of the plans
G: Plan B
H: Plan C, if additional tax deductions are available for interest paid
I: Plan A, with a government grant covering 10% of the initial investment
J: Plan B, with an additional private investor contributing $10,000

Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about Mr. Haskell wanting to buy a rental property. He's considering three investment plans, and I need to figure out which one gives the highest rate of return. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the building costs $50,000 and the land $30,000, so total is $80,000. The annual rent is $10,450 and expenses are $3,200. So, the net rental income before taxes and depreciation would be 10,450 minus 3,200, which is $7,250. 

He's planning to depreciate the building using the straight-line method over 40 years. So the annual depreciation would be 50,000 divided by 40, which is $1,250 per year. Depreciation is a non-cash expense, so it reduces taxable income but doesn't affect cash flow directly.

Now, the tax rate is 40%. So, the tax savings from depreciation would be 1,250 times 40%, which is $500 per year. Without considering any financing yet, his net income after taxes would be the rental income minus expenses, minus taxes on that income, plus the tax savings from depreciation. Wait, noâ€”actually, the taxable income is (rent - expenses - depreciation), and then taxes are calculated on that. Then, the cash flow would be the net rental income plus the tax savings from depreciation.

Let me structure this step by step. 

First, calculate the operating cash flow before financing for each plan. Since the plans differ in how much he borrows and the interest rates, the financing costs will affect the net cash flow.

Plan A: He pays the full $80,000 from his personal account. So, no loan, no interest. His cash flow would be the rent minus expenses, minus taxes on the taxable income, plus tax savings from depreciation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the net cash flow after taxes and after financing.

Wait, another approach: For each plan, calculate the annual cash inflows and outflows.

Let me outline each plan.

Plan A: No borrowing. So, initial investment is $80,000. Annual cash flow is:

Net rental income (before tax and depreciation): 10,450 - 3,200 = $7,250.

Depreciation is $1,250. So taxable income is 7,250 - 1,250 = $6,000.

Taxes on that would be 6,000 * 40% = $2,400.

So, after-tax cash flow would be (7,250 - 3,200) - taxes? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the cash flow is rent minus expenses, which is $7,250. Then, taxes are calculated on the taxable income (7,250 - depreciation). So, the tax is $2,400. So, the cash flow after taxes is 7,250 (net rental) minus 2,400 (taxes) plus any tax savings from depreciation? Wait, no, the depreciation is a non-cash expense, so the tax calculated is on the lower income. So, the tax saving is 1,250 * 40% = $500. So, the cash flow is 7,250 (net rental) plus 500 (tax savings) = $7,750 per year.

Wait, another way: Cash flow before tax is 7,250. Then, taxable income is 7,250 - 1,250 depreciation = 6,000. Tax is 6,000 * 0.4 = 2,400. So, after-tax cash flow is 7,250 - 2,400 = 4,850. Then, add back depreciation since it's non-cash: 4,850 + 1,250 = 6,100. Wait, that makes sense because EBITDA is 7,250, and then after tax, adding back depreciation.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The formula for cash flow from operations is:

Operating Cash Flow = (Rental Income - Expenses - Depreciation) * (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation

Alternatively, it can be calculated as:

(Net Income) + Non-cash expenses (like depreciation)

So, Net Income is (10,450 - 3,200 - 1,250) = 6,000.

Taxes are 6,000 * 0.4 = 2,400.

So, Net Income after tax is 6,000 - 2,400 = 3,600.

Then, add back depreciation: 3,600 + 1,250 = 4,850.

Wait, that's different from before. Hmm, maybe I should stick with the standard formula.

Alternatively, the after-tax cash flow can be calculated as:

Gross Income (10,450) minus expenses (3,200) gives 7,250. Then, subtract taxes on the taxable income (7,250 - depreciation 1,250 = 6,000 taxed at 40% is 2,400). So, 7,250 - 2,400 = 4,850.

But since depreciation isn't a cash flow, the total cash flow becomes 4,850 (after-tax) plus depreciation 1,250, totaling 6,100.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula is:

Net operating income (NOI) = Gross Income - Operating Expenses.

Then, taxable income = NOI - Depreciation.

Tax = taxable income * tax rate.

Cash flow before tax (but after depreciation) is NOI - Depreciation.

Then, tax is calculated on taxable income, so cash flow after tax is (NOI - Depreciation) * (1 - tax rate) + Depreciation * tax rate? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

NOI = $7,250.

Taxable Income = NOI - Depreciation = 7,250 - 1,250 = 6,000.

Tax = 6,000 * 0.4 = $2,400.

So, after-tax NOI is 6,000 - 2,400 = 3,600.

But wait, that's after-tax net income. The cash flow would then be this plus depreciation, because depreciation is a non-cash expense. So, cash flow is 3,600 + 1,250 = $4,850.

Alternatively, another way to calculate cash flow is: 

EBIT = NOI - Depreciation = 7,250 - 1,250 = 6,000.

Tax = 6,000 * 0.4 = 2,400.

Net Income = 6,000 - 2,400 = 3,600.

Cash flow from operations = Net Income + Depreciation = 3,600 + 1,250 = 4,850.

So, for Plan A, since there's no financing, the cash flow is $4,850 per year.

Now, Plan B: He borrows $30,000 and pays $50,000 from his personal account. The interest rate is 4.5%.

So, he has a loan of $30,000. I assume he's paying interest annually, and perhaps the interest is deductible. So, the interest expense would be 30,000 * 4.5% = $1,350 per year.

Now, his cash flow would be:

NOI: 7,250.

Depreciation: 1,250.

EBIT: 7,250 - 1,250 = 6,000.

Interest expense: 1,350.

Taxable Income: EBIT - Interest = 6,000 - 1,350 = 4,650.

Tax: 4,650 * 0.4 = 1,860.

Net Income: 4,650 - 1,860 = 2,790.

Cash flow from operations: Net Income + Depreciation = 2,790 + 1,250 = 4,040.

But wait, we also have to account for the interest payment, which is a cash outflow. So, the cash flow after operations is 4,040 (from operations) minus interest paid (1,350). So, 4,040 - 1,350 = 2,690.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the interest is tax-deductible, so the after-tax interest cost is 1,350 * (1 - 0.4) = 810.

Then, the cash flow would be the after-tax cash flow from operations (which includes the after-tax interest). So, let me think: The net rental is 7,250, then subtract interest (1,350), subtract depreciation (1,250), but wait, that's not correct because depreciation is a non-cash expense.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the cash flow before financing, then subtract the after-tax interest expense.

So, for Plan B:

Cash flow before financing is 4,850 (same as Plan A).

Then, subtract the after-tax interest expense. The interest is 1,350, and the tax saving on interest is 1,350 * 0.4 = 540, so after-tax interest is 1,350 - 540 = 810.

So, cash flow after financing would be 4,850 - 810 = 4,040.

Wait, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way: Calculate EBIT as 7,250 (NOI) - 1,250 (depreciation) = 6,000.

Interest is 1,350, so EBT (Earnings Before Tax) is 6,000 - 1,350 = 4,650.

Tax is 4,650 * 0.4 = 1,860.

Net Income is 4,650 - 1,860 = 2,790.

Cash flow from operations is 2,790 + 1,250 = 4,040.

Then, subtract the interest payment (1,350) which is a cash outflow. So, 4,040 - 1,350 = 2,690? That can't be right because earlier method gave 4,040. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should structure it as:

After-tax cash flow from operations is 4,850 (as in Plan A).

Then, subtract the after-tax interest payment.

Interest is 1,350, tax saving is 1,350 * 0.4 = 540, so after-tax interest is 810.

So, cash flow becomes 4,850 - 810 = 4,040.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, Plan B's annual cash flow is $4,040.

Plan C: He borrows $60,000 and pays $20,000 from his account. The interest rate is 5.25%.

So, interest expense is 60,000 * 5.25% = 3,150.

So, using the same approach:

Cash flow before financing is 4,850.

After-tax interest expense is 3,150 * (1 - 0.4) = 3,150 * 0.6 = 1,890.

So, cash flow after financing would be 4,850 - 1,890 = 2,960.

Wait, but let me confirm:

EBIT is 6,000.

Interest is 3,150.

EBT is 6,000 - 3,150 = 2,850.

Tax is 2,850 * 0.4 = 1,140.

Net Income: 2,850 - 1,140 = 1,710.

Cash flow from operations: 1,710 + 1,250 = 2,960.

Then, subtract interest payment of 3,150? No, because that's already accounted for in the EBT. Wait, no, the interest is an expense, so the cash flow after operations is 2,960, and then the interest is paid from that. But wait, no, because the interest is already an expense in the income statement, so the cash flow from operations includes the effect of interest through taxes. So, perhaps the correct cash flow is 2,960 as calculated.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but let's proceed.

So, comparing the three plans:

Plan A: 4,850 per year.

Plan B: 4,040 per year.

Plan C: 2,960 per year.

Wait, but Plan A seems better than B and C in terms of annual cash flow.

But wait, I'm not considering the initial investment. Because higher cash flow doesn't necessarily mean higher return on investment. We need to calculate the return on equity.

Wait, the question is about the highest rate of return. So, perhaps we should compute the cash flow and then determine the rate of return on the initial equity investment.

For each plan, the initial equity is:

Plan A: $80,000.

Plan B: $50,000.

Plan C: $20,000.

So, the cash flow each year is:

A: 4,850.

B: 4,040.

C: 2,960.

So, the rate of return would be cash flow divided by initial equity, but since it's an investment, we should probably consider the internal rate of return, which would require looking at the net present value of cash flows over time, but the problem doesn't specify the time period beyond the annual cash flows. So perhaps they just mean the cash flow as a percentage of the initial investment.

So, let's compute the return on equity for each plan.

Plan A: 4,850 / 80,000 = 6.0625%.

Plan B: 4,040 / 50,000 = 8.08%.

Plan C: 2,960 / 20,000 = 14.8%.

Wait, that's interesting. So, Plan C has the highest percentage return on equity at 14.8%, followed by B at 8.08%, then A at 6.06%.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive because Plan C has a higher interest rate. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cash flow for Plan C. Let's recalculate.

Plan C:

Loan of $60,000 at 5.25% interest. So, annual interest is 60,000 * 0.0525 = 3,150.

So, in the income statement:

Gross Rental Income: 10,450.

Operating Expenses: 3,200.

NOI: 7,250.

Depreciation: 1,250.

EBIT: 7,250 - 1,250 = 6,000.

Interest: 3,150.

EBT: 6,000 - 3,150 = 2,850.

Tax: 2,850 * 0.4 = 1,140.

Net Income: 2,850 - 1,140 = 1,710.

Cash flow from operations: 1,710 + 1,250 (depreciation) = 2,960.

Now, the interest is an expense that's already accounted for in EBT, so the cash flow from operations includes the after-tax effect of the interest. So, the cash flow after financing would be 2,960.

So, yes, the cash flow is $2,960 per year on an equity investment of $20,000.

So, 2,960 / 20,000 = 14.8% return.

Plan B: 4,040 / 50,000 = 8.08%.

Plan A: 4,850 /80,000=6.0625%.

So, based on this, Plan C gives the highest return on equity at 14.8%.

But wait, let me think if I'm missing something. Because even though Plan C has a higher ROE, the cash flow is lower than Plan B and A. But since the initial investment is smaller, the percentage is higher.

So, the question is which plan has the highest rate of return. So, it's about the return on the initial investment, which is ROE.

So, Plan C has the highest ROE, so the answer would be Plan C, which is option E.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Plan B, if the interest rates drop to 3%

B: Plan A, if the tax rate decreases to 30%

C: Plan A

D: Plan C, assuming rental income increases by 5% annually

E: Plan C

F: None of the plans

G: Plan B

H: Plan C, if additional tax deductions are available for interest paid

I: Plan A, with a government grant covering 10% of the initial investment

J: Plan B, with an additional private investor contributing $10,000

So, according to my calculations, the answer is E: Plan C.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the cash flows. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: Calculate the net cash flow after all expenses, including loan payments.

Wait, another way: For each plan, compute the cash flow after all expenses, including interest and principal. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the loan is being amortized or if it's interest-only. Hmm, the problem states that he's borrowing the money but doesn't specify repayment terms. So, perhaps we're only considering the interest payments, not the principal repayment, which would be the case if it's a 40-year loan, but the problem doesn't say. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 40-year depreciation period, but the loan term isn't specified. So, perhaps we're to assume that only interest is being paid annually, and the principal is due at the end. So, in that case, the only cash outflow is the interest payment each year.

So, in that case, the cash flow calculations I did earlier stand.

But let me think again. The cash flow for Plan C is $2,960, which is 14.8% of $20,000, which is better than the other options.

Wait, but what about the risk involved with higher leverage? Higher borrowing increases risk, but the question is about the rate of return, so based purely on ROE, Plan C is better.

So, the answer is E: Plan C.
</think>

To determine which investment plan offers the highest rate of return, we analyze the cash flows and returns on equity for each plan. The property costs $80,000 ($50,000 for the building and $30,000 for the land), with an annual rental income of $10,450 and expenses of $3,200. The building is depreciated using the straight-line method over 40 years, resulting in annual depreciation of $1,250. The tax rate is 40%.

### Plan A: Pay $80,000 from personal account
- **NOI (Net Operating Income):** $10,450 - $3,200 = $7,250  
- **Taxable Income:** $7,250 - $1,250 (depreciation) = $6,000  
- **Tax:** $6,000 * 40% = $2,400  
- **Net Income:** $6,000 - $2,400 = $3,600
