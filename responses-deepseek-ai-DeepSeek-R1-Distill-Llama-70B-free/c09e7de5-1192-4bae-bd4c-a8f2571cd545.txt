Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ship using sonar. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question asks for the wavelength of a 262 Hz wave in water. The options are from A to J, each with different numerical values in meters. Hmm, I remember that wavelength relates to frequency and the speed of the wave. Oh right, the formula is lambda equals speed divided by frequency, λ = v/f.

Wait, but what's the speed of sound in water? I think in air it's like 343 m/s at room temperature, but water's different. I seem to recall that sound travels faster in water. Wasn't it something like 1500 m/s? Or maybe 1520 m/s? I think for problems like this, they often use 1500 m/s as the speed of sound in water. I'll go with that unless told otherwise.

So, v is 1500 m/s, and the frequency f is 262 Hz. Plugging into the formula, λ = 1500 / 262.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 1500 divided by 262. Hmm, 262 times 5 is 1310, subtracting that from 1500 gives 190 left. Then 262 goes into 190 about 0.72 times? Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute it as 1500 ÷ 262. Let me do the division step by step. 262 * 5 is 1310. 1500 - 1310 = 190. Then bring down a zero, making it 1900. How many times does 262 go into 1900? Let's see, 262 * 7 is 1834. Subtract that: 1900 - 1834 = 66. Bring down another zero, making it 660. 262 goes into 660 twice (2*262=524). Subtract: 660-524=136. Bring down another zero, making it 1360. 262 *5 is 1310. Subtract: 50. Hmm, so this is getting a bit tedious, but the approximation is 5.72... Let me check with a calculator approach.

Wait, 262 times 5 is 1310. So 1500-1310 is 190. So the first part is 5 and then 190/262. 190 divided by 262 is approximately 0.725. So 5.725 meters? Looking at the options, none of them is exactly 5.725. Let me look again at the options.

Wait the options are:
A:4.95
B:3.14
C:6.78
D:6.25
E:7.48
F:5.65
G:3.89
H:4.32
I:5.00
J:2.87

Hmm, my calculation gives about 5.725 m, but the closest options are F:5.65 and I:5.00. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the speed of sound. Perhaps it's not 1500? Maybe it's 1482 m/s or another value. Let me think. I remember that the speed of sound in water is around 1500 m/s at 20°C, but sometimes they use 1520 m/s for more precise calculations.

Wait, if the speed is 1520, then 1520 / 262 is what? Let me compute that. 262 *5=1310. 1520-1310=210. 210/262 is approximately 0.80. So that would be 5.80. Hmm, 5.80 is close to 5.65 (option F) and 6.78 is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I've misremembered the speed. Another approach: the standard speed used in such problems is often 1500 m/s. So 1500/262 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately. 262 times 5 is 1310. 1500 - 1310 is 190. So that's 5 plus 190/262. 190 divided by 262 is approximately 0.725. So 5.725 meters. Looking at the options, the closest one is F:5.65 or I:5.00. But 5.725 isn't exactly there. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another approach: 262 is approximately 250. 1500/250 is 6. But 262 is bigger than 250, so the result should be a bit less than 6. Let's see: 262 * 5.7 = let's compute 262*5=1310, 262*0.7=183.4, so 1310+183.4=1493.4. That's close to 1500. So 5.7 would give 1493.4, so 5.7 is a bit low. So 5.72 *262 = ?

Wait 5.72 *262:

5 *262 = 1310

0.72 *262: 0.7*262=183.4; 0.02*262=5.24; so total 188.64.

So 1310+188.64=1498.64. Close to 1500. So 5.72 *262 ≈1498.64. So 5.72 gives 1498.64, which is just a bit less than 1500. So the actual value would be a bit higher than 5.72, perhaps 5.73? Because 5.73 *262 would be 5.72*262 + 0.01*262 = 1498.64 + 2.62 = 1501.26. Oh, that's over 1500. So 5.72 gives 1498.64, and 5.73 gives 1501.26. So 262 Hz at 1500 m/s would have a wavelength between 5.72 and 5.73 m.

Looking back at the options, the closest option is F:5.65, which is 5.65. But that's a bit lower than our calculated 5.72. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the speed of sound. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the speed of sound in water is sometimes taken as 1450 m/s. Let's try that. 1450 divided by 262.

1450 / 262: let's compute 262 *5=1310, 1450-1310=140. So 5 + 140/262. 140/262 is approximately 0.534. So 5.534, which is about 5.53 m. Again, that's not matching any options exactly. The options don't have 5.53, but F is 5.65, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem again. Is the frequency exactly 262 Hz? Yes. So maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternative approach: Let's compute 1500 divided by 262.

Performing division step by step:

262 ) 1500.00

How many times does 262 go into 1500? 5 times 262 is 1310. Subtract 1310 from 1500: 190. Bring down a zero, making it 1900.

Now, how many times does 262 go into 1900? Let's compute 262 *7 = 1834. 1900 - 1834 =66. Bring down zero, making it 660.

262 goes into 660 how many times? 2 times 262 is 524. Subtract: 660-524=136. Bring down zero, making it 1360.

262 goes into 1360: 5 times (5*262=1310). Subtract: 50. Bring down zero, making it 500.

262 goes into 500 once: 262. Subtract: 238. Bring down zero, making it 2380.

262 *9=2358. 2380-2358=22. So the result is 5.725... so approximately 5.725 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:5.65. But 5.725 is higher than 5.65. Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option I is 5.00, which is lower. Option F is 5.65. Hmm, but perhaps the exact calculation leads to 5.72, which isn't present, but maybe the intended answer is F:5.65.

Wait, but wait another thought: Did I get the speed of sound correctly? I assumed 1500 m/s. But perhaps the problem uses a different value. Like 1482 m/s. Let me try that.

1482 / 262 = ?

Well, 262 *5=1310. 1482-1310=172. 172/262 is approx 0.657. So 5.657, which is about 5.66. So that's close to option F:5.65.

Ah, that makes sense. So if the speed is 1482 m/s, then the wavelength is approximately 5.66, which would round to 5.65 or 5.66. So option F is 5.65, which would be the correct choice.

Wait, but why would the speed be 1482 m/s? I thought it's 1500. Maybe the problem uses a specific value. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used 1450 m/s. Let me try 1450.

1450 /262 =?

262 *5=1310, 1450-1310=140. 140/262≈0.534. So 5.534, which is 5.53, not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 1520 m/s. Let me compute 1520/262.

1520 divided by 262:

262 *5=1310. 1520-1310=210. 210/262≈0.80. So 5.80. But none of the options is 5.80. Closest would be F:5.65, but that's 0.15 less.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a rounded value. Let me think differently. Maybe the answer expects an approximate speed of 1500 m/s, so 1500/262 is approximately 5.725 m. But none of the options match exactly. Hmm.

Looking at the options again, option I is 5.00, which is way too low. Option F is 5.65, option D is 6.25, option C is 6.78, which is higher. So perhaps the intended answer is F:5.65, assuming the speed was taken as 1482 m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate using exactly 262 Hz and 1500 m/s. Let's compute 1500/262.

262 * 5 = 1310. 1500 - 1310 =190.

So 190/262 = 0.725 approximately.

So 5.725 m.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:5.65. But that's 5.65, which is 0.075 less than 5.725. Maybe the problem expects rounding down, so 5.65 would be the option.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is 1500/262 = approximately 5.725, but perhaps the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is F:5.65, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the speed used is 1430 m/s. Let me try 1430/262.

1430 ÷262 ≈5.43 m. That doesn't match any options either.

Alternatively, maybe I should think if I confused frequency and wavelength. No, the formula is correct: λ = v/f.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 262 into 1500 more accurately.

1500 / 262 = ?

Let me compute 262 × 5.725:

5 ×262 =1310.

0.725 ×262: 0.7 ×262=183.4, 0.025 ×262=6.55.

So 183.4 +6.55=189.95.

So 5 ×262 +0.725 ×262 =1310 +189.95=1499.95, which is almost 1500. So 5.725 is about right. So 5.725 m.

But the options don't have 5.725. So perhaps the intended answer is F:5.65 if they rounded down, but it's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the speed. Wait, another thought: the speed of sound in seawater is about 1533 m/s at 0°C and 34.3‰ salinity. But sometimes, it's approximated as 1500 m/s for simplicity.

Wait, wait, I think another approach is to compute 1500 ÷262 without approximating.

Compute 262 ×5 =1310.

1500-1310=190.

Bring down a decimal and a zero: 1900.

262 ×7=1834.

1900-1834=66.

Bring down a zero: 660.

262 ×2=524.

660-524=136.

Bring down a zero:1360.

262 ×5=1310.

1360-1310=50.

Bring down zero:500.

262 ×1=262.

500-262=238.

Bring down a zero:2380.

262 ×9=2358.

2380-2358=22.

So up to this point, the division gives 5.725... So 5.725 meters.

Looking at the options again, none of them is exactly 5.725. So perhaps the intended answer is not present, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the speed.

Wait, perhaps the speed of sound in water is 1493 m/s. Let me compute 1493 /262.

262 ×5=1310.

1493-1310=183.

183/262≈0.7.

So 5.7 m. But option F is 5.65, which is 5.65, which is close to 5.7.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F:5.65.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just proceed with 5.725, which isn't an option, but perhaps the intended answer is F:5.65, considering possible rounding or different speed values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if any of the options when multiplied by 262 gives 1500. Let's see:

Option F:5.65 m. 5.65 ×262 = ?

5 ×262 =1310.

0.65 ×262 =170.3.

So 1310 +170.3=1480.3. Close to 1500 but not exactly.

Option I:5.00 m. 5 ×262=1310. That's way too low.

Option C:6.78 ×262= let's see: 6×262=1572, 0.78×262≈204.36. Total ≈1572+204.36=1776.36, which is way over 1500.

Option D:6.25×262= let's compute 6×262=1572, 0.25×262=65.5. Total 1572+65.5=1637.5. Also way over.

Option E:7.48×262=> way too high.

Option A:4.95 ×262= 4×262=1048, 0.95×262≈248.9. Total 1048+248.9= 1296.9. Too low.

Option B:3.14≈ pi. 3×262=786, 0.14×262≈36.68. Total 786+36.68=822.68. Way too low.

Option G:3.89×262= let's see, 3×262=786, 0.89×262≈233.38. Total ≈1019.38. Still low.

Option H:4.32×262=4×262=1048, 0.32×262≈83.84. Total 1048+83.84=1131.84. Still low.

Option J:2.87×262= approx 751.14. Way too low.

Hmm, so none of the options when multiplied by 262 give exactly 1500. So perhaps the intended answer is F:5.65, as 5.65×262=1480.3, which is approximately 1500, but not exact. But wait, 5.65×262=1480.3, which is 19.7 less than 1500. That's a significant difference.

Wait, but earlier when I computed 5.725, that's 5.725 ×262 = 1500 (approximately). So I'm a bit confused because none of the options match exactly. Perhaps the intended answer is F:5.65, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps the problem used a different speed, like 1450 m/s. Let's compute 1450/262.

1450 ÷262: 5 ×262=1310, 1450-1310=140. 140/262 ≈0.534. So 5.534 m, which is approximately 5.53. Still, the closest option is F:5.65, but that's higher.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use 2540 m/s, but that's the speed in some other materials, not water.

Wait, maybe I should think that the options are designed with a specific calculation in mind. Let's see option F is 5.65. Let's compute 262 ×5.65.

262 ×5=1310.

262 ×0.65=170.3.

So 1310 +170.3=1480.3 m/s. So 1480.3 m/s. But the speed of sound is supposed to be 1500. So 1480 is a bit low. Maybe the problem expects to use 1480 as the speed. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F:5.65, assuming that the product 262 ×5.65 is 1480.3, but that's not matching 1500.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. The question is about a sonar system. Sonar uses sound waves underwater, so the speed should be correct for water.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses 343 m/s, which is the speed of sound in air. But that would give a wavelength of 343/262 ≈1.31 m, which is not among the options.

No, that can't be right. So
