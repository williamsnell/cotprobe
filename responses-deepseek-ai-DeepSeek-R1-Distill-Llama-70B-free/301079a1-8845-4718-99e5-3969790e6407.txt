Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about strategies to reduce aggressiveness in children, and I need to figure out which one is least effective. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which strategy would probably be least effective. The options are A through D: social skills training, encouraging competitive sports and games, exposure to a nonaggressive model, and opportunities for catharsis.

Hmm, I remember from psychology that aggression in children can be influenced by various factors, including environment, models, and the ways they express emotions. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Social skills training. I think this is about teaching kids how to interact better, solve problems without fighting, and communicate effectively. That makes sense because if a child learns better ways to handle social situations, they might be less aggressive. So this would probably reduce aggression, making it an effective strategy. So A is probably not the answer we're looking for.

Option B: Encouraging competitive sports and games. Wait, competitive sports can sometimes increase aggression because they emphasize winning over others. If children are engaged in competitive activities, they might learn to be more aggressive to win, especially if the games aren't teaching good sportsmanship. So this could actually make aggression worse rather than reduce it. That makes B a possible candidate for the least effective strategy.

Option C: Exposure to a nonaggressive model. I remember something about modeling behavior from Bandura's social learning theory. If a child observes someone who isn't aggressive and maybe solves problems peacefully, they might imitate that behavior. So exposure to nonaggressive models should help reduce aggression, making C an effective strategy. So C isn't the answer.

Option D: Opportunities for catharsis. Catharsis is the idea that expressing or acting out pent-up emotions, like aggression, can reduce them. For example, playing aggressively with toys or in games. But wait, I think the research on this is mixed. Some studies suggest that catharsis might actually increase aggression because it reinforces aggressive behaviors rather than reducing them. So if a child is allowed to act out aggressively, they might feel more aggressive afterward, not less. So D could be an ineffective strategy. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's about whether it's done constructively or not.

Wait, so the question is about which is least effective. Let's compare B and D. Encouraging competitive sports might promote aggression because the focus is on winning, which can lead to more competitive and aggressive behavior. On the other hand, catharsis—like letting a child hit a pillow—might not reduce aggression and could even increase it if not done properly. So both B and D could be ineffective, but which is worse?

I think that competitive sports can sometimes teach teamwork and can be positive if conducted properly, but they can also foster aggression if the environment is too competitive. So maybe B is actually worse because it's more about encouraging competition rather than teaching alternative behaviors. Alternatively, if D is about catharsis, which might not work as intended, but maybe it's less harmful than B.

Wait, another angle: Social skills training (A) clearly helps, nonaggressive models (C) help. Catharsis (D) might not be effective, and competitive sports (B) might actually increase aggression. So between B and D, which is worse.

I think that competitive sports and games (B) would probably be least effective because they might increase aggression rather than decrease it. Catharsis, if done in a controlled way, might help some children, but the evidence is mixed. But the question is about the least effective strategy. So the worst option would be B, because it's encouraging competition, which can lead to more aggression.

Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Another thought: some research suggests that sports can actually reduce aggression by providing an outlet, but only if they're structured in a way that emphasizes fair play and teamwork. But if the focus is on winning, then maybe it's not helpful. So maybe the option B is promoting the wrong kind of competitive environment.

Putting it all together, the strategy least likely to reduce aggression would be B: encouraging competitive sports and games. So the answer is B.

The question asks which strategy would be least effective for reducing aggressiveness in children. Let’s analyze each option:

- **Option A: Social skills training** teaches children how to interact better, solve problems, and communicate effectively, which can reduce aggression. This is an effective strategy.
- **Option B: Encouraging competitive sports and games** can increase aggression because the focus on winning may lead to more competitive and aggressive behavior, especially if good sportsmanship is not emphasized. This makes it a likely ineffective strategy.
- **Option C: Exposure to a nonaggressive model** allows children to observe and imitate peaceful problem-solving behaviors, which can reduce aggression. This is an effective strategy.
- **Option D: Opportunities for catharsis** involves expressing pent-up emotions, but research suggests it may not reduce aggression and could even increase it if not done constructively. However, it may be less harmful than competitive sports.

Comparing B and D, encouraging competitive sports (B) is likely the least effective because it can directly promote aggression, whereas catharsis (D) might have mixed results but is less directly harmful. Therefore, the least effective strategy is **B**.

Answer: B
