Question:

A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is

Options:

A: 3.0 microseconds
B: 2.6 microseconds
C: 2.4 microseconds
D: 2.0 microseconds
E: 0.6 microseconds
F: 1.6 microseconds
G: 0.8 microseconds
H: 1.8 microseconds
I: 1.2 microseconds

Okay, so I have this problem about a microcomputer handling data acquisition and control. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The task is to digitize four analog input signals, process them, and output their average continually in real time. So the microcomputer is doing this repeatedly without any delays.

First, let's look at the components involved. There's an external analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that's triggered by a CPU instruction. It takes 12 microseconds to digitize one input, and only one at a time. So for each of the four signals, it's 12 µs per digitization.

Then, for each digitized signal, the CPU has to execute five instructions. That includes the triggering instruction, so each digitization requires five instructions. Since there are four signals, that's 5 instructions per signal times four, so 5 *4 =20 instructions just for digitizing.

After digitizing all four signals, the CPU then has to average them. That requires ten more CPU instructions. So those are ten instructions for each set of four samples.

The question is about finding the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output rates. So we're looking for the cycle time, I think—the time it takes to process one complete set of four signals, compute the average, and output it. 

Let me outline the steps:
1. Digitize four signals, each taking 12 µs, sequentially. So total ADC time is 4 *12 =48 µs.
2. For each digitization, the CPU executes five instructions. So four signals mean 5 *4 =20 instructions.
3. After digitizing all four, the CPU executes ten more instructions to average and output.

Wait, but the ADC is external and triggered by the CPU. So the CPU can't do anything else while the ADC is converting, right? Or can it? Hmm, no, the problem says that the ADC is triggered by a CPU instruction, and each digitization occurs one at a time. So I think the CPU triggers the ADC, then the ADC does its thing, which takes 12 µs, during which the CPU might be doing other tasks? Or maybe the CPU has to wait for the ADC to finish before proceeding. Hmm, the problem isn't clear on that. But typically, in such setups, the CPU would trigger the ADC and then wait for it to finish, perhaps using a polling loop or an interrupt. But since the problem says that the digitization is triggered by a CPU instruction, and only one at a time, perhaps the CPU has to wait for each ADC conversion to complete before moving on to the next.

Alternatively, maybe the ADC and CPU can operate in a pipelined fashion. But without more info, I'll assume that the CPU has to wait for each ADC conversion. So the total time for the four ADC conversions would be 4 *12 µs =48 µs.

Now, for each of those four signals, the CPU has to execute five instructions. So that's 5 instructions per signal, four signals total. So 20 instructions. Let's call each instruction's time T. So 20T is the time the CPU spends on those instructions.

Then, after all four are done, the CPU does ten more instructions for averaging and output. So that's 10T.

So the total time for one complete cycle (digitizing four signals, processing, and outputting) is:

ADC time + CPU instructions time.

ADC time is 48 µs.

CPU time is (20 +10) * T =30 T.

So total time per cycle is 48 +30T µs.

But wait, the data needs to be processed in real time, so the cycle time must be less than or equal to the time available for each cycle. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the data rate. The problem doesn't specify the sampling rate, but perhaps it's implied that the processing must be done as fast as possible without falling behind. So the total time per cycle should be equal to the time taken by the ADC plus the CPU time, but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, maybe the processing must complete before the next set of data comes in. So the maximum time allowed per cycle is the same as the time it takes the ADC to process four signals and the CPU to handle everything else. Or perhaps the data is coming in at a rate that the total processing time can't exceed the time between data sets.

Alternatively, maybe the data is being sampled every certain period, and the processing must finish within that period.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as the total time for one cycle (digitizing four signals, processing) must be equal to the time it takes for the next cycle to start. So the total time T_total must be less than or equal to the maximum allowable time, which depends on the digitization and processing.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me restate the problem: we need to find the maximum average instruction execution time (T) such that the microcomputer can keep up.

So the total time per cycle is T_total = time spent on ADC conversions + time spent on CPU instructions.

ADC time is 4 *12 =48 µs.

CPU time is (5 *4 +10) * T =30 T.

So T_total =48 +30 T.

But what constrains T_total? It needs to be such that each cycle completes before the next one starts. But without knowing the data rate, like how often the data comes in, perhaps the data is arriving as fast as possible, so the processing must be done in the same time as the data digitization plus processing.

Wait, perhaps the ADC can only process one signal at a time, so for four signals, it's 4*12=48 µs. But the CPU has to execute the instructions for each digitization. So for each digitization, the CPU does five instructions, which take 5T each. So the time for each digitization would be 12 µs (ADC) plus 5T (CPU). But wait, does the CPU wait for the ADC to finish before executing the next instruction? 

Alternatively, maybe the ADC takes 12 µs, during which the CPU is busy with the five instructions. But that can't be, because each digitization requires the CPU to do five instructions, so for each ADC, the CPU spends 5T time.

Wait, perhaps each ADC conversion is triggered, which takes CPU time. So for each signal, the ADC takes 12 µs, and during that time, the CPU can't do anything else. Or perhaps the CPU can proceed. Hmm, I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me see.

Wait, the problem says that each digitization is triggered by a CPU instruction. So for each of the four signals, the CPU issues a trigger instruction, which takes T time. Then the ADC takes 12 µs to do the conversion. So for each signal, the time is T (trigger) +12 µs (ADC). But the CPU can perform other instructions while the ADC is running, perhaps.

Wait no, the problem says that five CPU instructions must be executed for each signal digitized, including the triggering instruction. So for each digitization, the CPU must execute five instructions. So that's 5T per digitization. So for four signals, that's 4*5T=20T.

So in terms of timing, for each digitization, the CPU does five instructions, which take 5T, but the ADC takes 12 µs. So the two can overlap? Like, after the CPU triggers the ADC, the ADC runs in parallel, and the CPU can proceed to do other instructions, but in this case, the problem states that each digitization is handled one at a time. So perhaps the CPU has to wait for the ADC to finish before moving on to the next digitization.

So the per-signal time would be max(5T, 12 µs). Because the CPU can't start the next digitization until both the ADC is done and the CPU has finished its instructions.

Wait, that might make sense. Because for each signal, the ADC is 12 µs, and the CPU has to do 5 instructions, taking 5T. So whichever is longer will determine the time for that signal's processing.

So for each signal, the time is the maximum of 12 µs and 5T. Because both the ADC and the CPU instructions must complete before moving on.

But since we're looking for the maximum T such that the system can keep up, T must be such that 5T ≤12 µs, because if 5T is longer than 12, that would mean the CPU is the bottleneck. So to make sure the CPU isn't slowing down the ADC, 5T should be ≤12 µs. So T ≤12/5=2.4 µs. But wait, perhaps that's not the case because the ADC and CPU can work in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps the CPU can interleave instructions with ADC conversions. Like, trigger the ADC, then while it's running, the CPU can do the next instructions. But the problem says that only one digitization occurs at a time, so perhaps the CPU must handle each digitization sequentially.

Wait, perhaps the process is as follows:

For each of the four signals:

1. CPU triggers ADC (1 instruction, time T).
2. ADC takes 12 µs to convert.
3. CPU does the remaining four instructions (4 instructions, 4T), but these can be done while the ADC is running, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem states that five instructions are executed for each signal digitized, including the trigger. So perhaps the five instructions are all part of the process for that digitization. So it's possible that the CPU triggers the ADC, which takes 12 µs, and during that time, the CPU can perform the other four instructions. So the total time per digitization would be max(12 µs, 5T). Because the ADC and CPU could be working in parallel.

If 5T is less than 12 µs, then the per-digitization time is 12 µs. If 5T is more, then it's 5T.

So the total time for four digitizations would be 4 * max(12,5T).

Wait, but if the CPU can do the five instructions while the ADC is running, then the time per digitization would be the maximum of 12 and 5T. So for each digitization, the CPU does five instructions which take 5T time, but the ADC takes 12 µs. So the two can happen in parallel. So the time taken per digitization is the maximum of the two.

So for each digitization, the time is max(12,5T). So for four digitizations, it's 4*max(12,5T).

But after that, the CPU has to do ten more instructions to average and output, which takes 10T.

So the total time for the entire cycle is 4*max(12,5T) +10T.

But for the system to keep up, the total time per cycle must be less than or equal to the time available. Wait, but what's the time available? Hmm, perhaps the data is arriving at a rate that requires the processing to finish in the same time it takes to digitize all four signals. Or perhaps it's that the processing must be done in the time the ADC takes for four signals plus the CPU processing.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently.

The problem says we're to find the maximum average instruction execution time T that allows the computer to keep up. So the total time taken per cycle must be such that each cycle completes before the next begins.

Assuming that the data is coming in as fast as possible, the processing must finish as quickly as possible.

So the total time per cycle is the time for four ADC conversions plus the CPU processing.

Wait, but the ADCs are sequential, so four times 12 µs is 48 µs. But during each ADC conversion, the CPU can execute the five instructions. Alternatively, perhaps the CPU can only process one ADC at a time, so the total time is the sum of each digitization's time.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Let me approach it again.

Each digitization takes 12 µs for the ADC. For each digitization, the CPU must execute five instructions. The CPU can't trigger the next ADC until the previous one is done. So the time for each digitization is 12 µs (ADC) plus 5T (CPU). Because the CPU can't do anything else while the ADC is running, because it's waiting for it to finish.

Wait, but that's assuming that the CPU has to wait for the ADC to finish each digitization before proceeding. So each digitization's total time is 12 µs plus 5T.

But that would make the four digitizations take 4*(12 +5T) µs.

Then, after all four, the CPU has to do ten instructions, which is 10T.

So the total cycle time is 4*(12 +5T) +10T =48 +20T +10T =48 +30T.

But wait, if the CPU is waiting for the ADC each time, the time per digitization is 12 +5T. So four of them would be 4*(12 +5T) =48 +20T. Then, plus 10T for the averaging, giving 48 +30T.

So the cycle time is 48 +30T.

But we need this cycle time to be less than or equal to the maximum allowable time. But what's the maximum allowable time?

Wait, perhaps the data is coming in at a rate where each cycle must be completed within a certain period. But the problem doesn’t specify a data rate or a maximum allowable cycle time. So maybe the data is being sampled as fast as possible, and the processing must be done in the same time as the digitization and processing.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the processing must be able to handle the data without any delay, so the time per cycle must be equal to the time it takes to digitize four signals, which is 48 µs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the data is coming in at a certain rate, and the processing must not fall behind. So the time per cycle must be less than or equal to the time between data sets. But without knowing the data rate, perhaps the problem is considering that the processing must finish each cycle before the next set of data arrives. So the total cycle time must be less than or equal to the time it would take if the CPU wasn't a bottleneck.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider the worst case where the CPU is the bottleneck. For each digitization, the CPU takes 5T, and the ADC takes 12 µs. So the time per digitization is 12 +5T. Or maybe the CPU can't start the next digitization until both it and the ADC are done.

Wait, the problem says that five instructions are executed for each digitized signal. That suggests that for each signal, the CPU does five instructions, which includes the trigger. So perhaps for each digitization, the CPU must execute five instructions, which take 5T, and the ADC takes 12 µs. So the time for each digitization is 5T (CPU) plus 12 µs (ADC). Because the ADC can't start until the CPU triggers it, but after that, the CPU is busy with the other four instructions. Or wait, maybe the CPU triggers the ADC, and while the ADC is running, the CPU can do other instructions.

But the problem says that each digitization is triggered by a CPU instruction. So perhaps the CPU does the trigger (1 instruction, T time), then the ADC runs (12 µs), and during that time, the CPU can do the other four instructions (4T). So the total time per digitization would be the maximum of (12 µs and T +4T)=5T. So per digitization, the time is max(12,5T).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the CPU has to wait for the ADC to finish before proceeding. So the total time per digitization is 12 µs (ADC) plus 5T (CPU instructions). So 12 +5T per digitization.

So four digitizations would take 4*(12 +5T) =48 +20T µs.

Then, after that, the CPU does ten instructions for averaging, which is 10T.

So the total cycle time is 48 +20T +10T =48 +30T µs.

Now, for the system to keep up, the cycle time must be less than or equal to the time available. But what's the time available? Well, perhaps the data is coming in at a rate that requires each cycle to take no more than 48 µs plus some processing time. Wait, maybe the data arrives every certain time, and the processing must be done by then.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is in a loop where it must process each set of four samples as quickly as possible, without any delay.

Wait, but without knowing the data rate, perhaps the maximum allowable cycle time is when the cycle time is equal to the time the ADC takes for four samples, which is 48 µs, plus the CPU time. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the data is being sampled at a rate that the time between samples is the same as the processing time. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the entire processing (digitizing four signals, and processing) must be done in the time it takes to digitize four signals, but that can't be right because processing takes time.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum allowable cycle time is when the cycle time equals the time it takes to digitize four signals, which is 48 µs. So 48 +30T =48 → T=0, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about it as the total time per cycle must be equal to the maximum time that the CPU can take without causing any delay.

Wait, maybe the processing must be done in the same time as the ADC takes for four signals, which is 48 µs. So 48 +30T =48 → T=0, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the processing must finish within the time the ADC takes for four signals, but that would mean 30T ≤48 → T ≤1.6 µs. But looking at the options, 1.6 is option F. But wait, that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the CPU can process the data while the ADC is digitizing. So for each of the four digitizations, the CPU can process the data in parallel.

Wait, maybe the ADC takes 12 µs per sample, and for four samples, that's 48 µs. During that 48 µs, the CPU is busy with 5 instructions per sample. So 4 samples ×5 instructions =20 instructions. Plus 10 instructions for the average, totaling 30 instructions.

So the CPU must execute 30 instructions in 48 µs. So the average instruction time T is 48/30 =1.6 µs. So the maximum T is 1.6 µs, which is option F.

Wait
