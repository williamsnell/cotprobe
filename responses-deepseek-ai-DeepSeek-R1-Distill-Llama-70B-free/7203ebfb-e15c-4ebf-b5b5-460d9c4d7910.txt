Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Haines buying a tractor, and I need to figure out the depreciation after the first five years using the straight-line method. Hmm, let's see. I remember that straight-line depreciation is a method where the cost of an asset is spread evenly over its useful life. So each year, the depreciation expense is the same.

The tractor costs $2,895.00, and the salvage value at the end of 10 years is $495.00. Salvage value is what the asset is worth at the end of its useful life, right? So the depreciation doesn't reduce the asset's value below that.

I think the first step is to calculate the total depreciation over the 10 years. So that would be the initial cost minus the salvage value. Let me do the math: $2,895 minus $495. Let me subtract that. 2895 - 495... Well, 2895 minus 400 is 2495, then minus 95 more would be 2400. So total depreciation is $2,400 over 10 years.

Since it's straight-line, each year's depreciation is the same. So I divide the total depreciation by the number of years. $2,400 divided by 10 equals $240 per year. So each year, the depreciation is $240.

But the question asks for the depreciation after the first five years. Wait, do they mean the total accumulated depreciation up to that point, or just the depreciation in the fifth year? Hmm. Depreciation methods typically calculate the expense each year, but when they ask for after five years, I think they're asking for the total depreciation accumulated over those five years.

So if each year is $240, then five years would be 5 times 240. Let me calculate that: 5 * 240 is 1,200. So the accumulated depreciation after five years would be $1,200.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is, the annual depreciation is $240, so each year it adds up. So year 1: 240, year 2: 480, year3:720, year4:960, year5:1200. Yes, that makes sense.

So looking at the options, option G is $1,200. That must be the correct answer.

To determine the depreciation after the first five years using the straight-line method, we start by calculating the total depreciation over the asset's useful life. The tractor costs $2,895.00, and its salvage value at the end of 10 years is $495.00. The total depreciation is:

\[
\text{Total Depreciation} = \text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value} = \$2,895 - \$495 = \$2,400
\]

Under the straight-line method, depreciation is evenly spread over the useful life of the asset. Therefore, the annual depreciation is:

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Total Depreciation}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{\$2,400}{10} = \$240 \text{ per year}
\]

To find the total depreciation after the first five years, we multiply the annual depreciation by 5:

\[
\text{Depreciation After 5 Years} = \$240 \times 5 = \$1,200
\]

Thus, the accumulated depreciation after the first five years is **$1,200**.
