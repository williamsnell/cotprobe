Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capacitors and the work required to charge them. Hmm, I remember that capacitors store electrical energy, and there's a formula involved in calculating the energy. Let me think about what I learned in class.

The question is asking how much work is required to charge a 10 microfarad capacitor to a potential difference of 100 volts. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the right one. 

Wait, I think the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor is something like U equals (1/2) * C * V squared. Yeah, that's right. U is the energy in joules, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage.

So the capacitance here is 10 microfarads. Oh wait, micro is 10^-6, so that's 10e-6 farads. And the voltage is 100 volts. So plug those values into the formula.

Let me write this out. U = 0.5 * C * V². So substituting the numbers: 0.5 * 10e-6 F * (100 V)^2.

Calculating the voltage squared first: 100 squared is 10,000. Then multiply by capacitance: 10e-6 * 10,000. Let's see, 10e-6 is 0.00001, multiplied by 10,000 gives 0.1. Then multiply by 0.5: 0.5 * 0.1 is 0.05. So the energy is 0.05 joules.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.05 J. So the answer should be B.

Wait wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. 10 microfarad is 10e-6, yes. 100 volts squared is 10,000. Multiply those together: 10e-6 * 10^4 = 10^(-6+4) = 10^-2, which is 0.01. Then 0.01 multiplied by 0.5 is 0.005. Oh wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation earlier?

Wait no, wait. Because the formula is (1/2) * C * V^2. So C is 10e-6 F, V is 100 V.

So V squared is 100^2 = 10^4 = 10,000. Then C times V squared is 10e-6 * 10,000 = 0.1. Then multiply by 1/2, which gives 0.05 J. So I think my first calculation was correct. So 0.05 is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh wait, 10e-6 is 0.00001, right? So 0.00001 * 10,000 is 0.1, yes. Half of that is 0.05. So yes, answer B.

To determine the work required to charge a 10 µF capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V, we use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C \cdot V^2
\]

Here:
- \( C = 10 \, \mu\text{F} = 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{F} = 0.00001 \, \text{F} \)
- \( V = 100 \, \text{V} \)

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.00001 \cdot (100)^2
\]

First, calculate \( V^2 \):
\[
100^2 = 10,000
\]

Next, multiply \( C \cdot V^2 \):
\[
0.00001 \cdot 10,000 = 0.1
\]

Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.1 = 0.05 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the work required to charge the capacitor is \( 0.05 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
