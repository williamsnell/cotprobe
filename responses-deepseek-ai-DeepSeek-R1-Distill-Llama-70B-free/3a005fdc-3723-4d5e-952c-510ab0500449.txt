Okay, so I've got this Python expression to evaluate: 1 + 3 % 3. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my operator precedence, but I think the modulo operator has lower precedence than addition, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I remember that multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. Oh wait, wait, modulo is like multiplication level. So in order of operations, I should do the modulo first before the addition.

Let me break it down. The expression is 1 + (3 % 3). What's 3 mod 3? Well, 3 divided by 3 is exactly 1 with no remainder. So 3 % 3 should be 0. So then adding 1 to that gives 1 + 0, which equals 1.

Wait, but could I have mixed up the order? Like, if I did 1 + 3 first, that would be 4, and then 4 % 3 is 1. Oh wait no, because the modulo has higher precedence than addition. So it's calculated first. So yeah, 3%3=0, then add 1.

So the result should be 1. Looking at the options, option D is 1.

The expression `1 + 3 % 3` is evaluated by first computing the modulo operation due to operator precedence. Since `3 % 3 = 0`, adding 1 gives `1`.

Answer: D
