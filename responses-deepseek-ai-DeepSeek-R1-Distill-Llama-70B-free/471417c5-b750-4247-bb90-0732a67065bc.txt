Okay, so I've got this question here about research methods, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says a researcher is testing problem-solving skills in three different age groups: twenty 10-year-olds, twenty 20-year-olds, and twenty 30-year-olds. The study is about age and problem-solving. The question is asking which research method is being used here.

The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think about each option.

First, I remember that research methods can be categorized in different ways. There's experimental, which involves manipulating variables and seeing the effect. But in this case, the researcher isn't changing anything; they're just testing different ages. So maybe not experimental.

Then there's the survey method, which usually involves asking people questions. But here, the participants are being tested on their problem-solving skills, not just answering a questionnaire. So survey might not be the right fit.

Case study comes to mind, but that's more about in-depth analysis of a single case or a small number of cases over time. This study has multiple participants across different ages, so it's probably not a case study.

Stage? Hmm, not sure about that. Maybe it's related to developmental stages, but I don't think that's a specific research method.

Correlation method is about finding relationships between variables. But in this case, the researcher is looking at different age groups to see how problem-solving changes. It's more about comparing across ages than looking for a correlation between variables over the same group.

Cross-sectional studies involve observing different groups at the same time. So, for example, testing 10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, and 30-year-olds all now. That sounds exactly like what's happening here. They're taking a snapshot across different ages.

Longitudinal studies, on the other hand, follow the same group over time. Like testing the same people when they're 10, then again at 20, and again at 30. But the question says twenty participants in each age group, implying different people, not the same individuals over time.

Sequential and developmental methods... Sequential might involve following participants over time but perhaps in different cohorts. Developmental research looks at changes over time, but I think cross-sectional is more specific here.

Ethnographic is about observing cultures or social groups in their natural settings, which doesn't fit this scenario.

So putting it all together, the researcher is testing different age groups at one point in time. That's a cross-sectional study. So the answer should be F: cross-sectional.

The researcher is testing problem-solving skills across three different age groups (10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, and 30-year-olds) at one point in time. This approach involves comparing different groups simultaneously, which is characteristic of a cross-sectional study. 

Answer: F
