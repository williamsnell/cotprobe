Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about oil supply and demand. I need to find the equilibrium price and the number of barrels sold at that price. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium is where the supply equals the demand, right?

The problem says the distributors are willing to buy 60 minus p barrels per day. Wait, p is the price in dollars per barrel. So the demand function is Qd = 60 - p. Or wait, actually, the wording says "buy 60-p barrels per day when p = dollars per barrel." So yeah, that's the demand.

On the supply side, the Republic's officials are willing to supply (p² / 10) barrels per day. So the supply function is Qs = (p²)/10.

At equilibrium, Qd equals Qs. So I should set them equal to each other and solve for p. Let me write that down:

60 - p = (p²)/10.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let's rearrange this equation. Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the denominator.

10*(60 - p) = p².

Calculating the left side: 10*60 is 600, and 10*(-p) is -10p. So,

600 - 10p = p².

Now, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 600 and add 10p to both sides:

p² +10p -600 = 0.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. If I subtract (600 -10p) from both sides, it becomes p² = 600 -10p. So bringing everything to the left:

p² - 600 +10p =0 → p² +10p -600 =0.

Wait, let's see. Alternatively, moving all terms to the right side: 0 = p² +10p -600. So the quadratic equation is p² +10p -600 = 0.

Now I need to solve this quadratic equation. The standard quadratic formula is p = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=10, c=-600.

Calculating the discriminant: b² -4ac = (10)^2 -4*(1)*(-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500.

Square root of 2500 is 50. So,

p = [-10 ±50]/(2*1).

So two solutions: 

1. (-10 +50)/2 = 40/2=20.

2. (-10 -50)/2 = -60/2=-30.

But price can't be negative, so p=20 is the solution. So equilibrium price is $20.

Now, how many barrels are sold? I can plug p=20 into either Qd or Qs. Let's use Qd: 60 - p =60-20=40 barrels per day.

Wait, let me check with Qs. Qs= (20)^2 /10=400/10=40. Yep, matches. So 40 barrels.

Looking at the options, option J says equilibrium price is 20, barrels sold 40. So answer should be J.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes I might make a mistake in the quadratic setup.

Alternative approach: perhaps I made a mistake in rearranging the initial equation.

Original setup: 60 - p = p² /10.

Multiply both sides by 10: 600 -10p = p².

Then, p² +10p -600=0. Yes, that's correct.

Quadratic formula again: a=1, b=10, c=-600.

Discriminant: 10^2 -4*1*(-600)=100+2400=2500.

sqrt(2500)=50. So roots: (-10 ±50)/2.

Positive solution is (40)/2=20. So p=20. Then Q=60-20=40. So option J is correct.

To determine the equilibrium price and the number of barrels sold, we start by setting the demand and supply functions equal to each other. The demand function is given as:

\[
Q_d = 60 - p
\]

The supply function is:

\[
Q_s = \frac{p^2}{10}
\]

At equilibrium, \( Q_d = Q_s \), so:

\[
60 - p = \frac{p^2}{10}
\]

To solve for \( p \), multiply both sides by 10:

\[
600 - 10p = p^2
\]

Rearrange into standard quadratic form:

\[
p^2 + 10p - 600 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \( p = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -600 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{Discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4(1)(-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500
\]

\[
\sqrt{2500} = 50
\]

\[
p = \frac{-10 \pm 50}{2}
\]

This gives two solutions:

\[
p = \frac{-10 + 50}{2} = 20 \quad \text{and} \quad p = \frac{-10 - 50}{2} = -30
\]

Since price cannot be negative, \( p = 20 \) dollars is the equilibrium price.

Next, we calculate the number of barrels sold at equilibrium by substituting \( p = 20 \) into either \( Q_d \) or \( Q_s \). Using \( Q_d = 60 - p \):

\[
Q_d = 60 - 20 = 40
\]

Thus, 40 barrels are sold at equilibrium.

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**J: Equilibrium price is 20 dollars, Number of barrels sold is 40 per day.**
