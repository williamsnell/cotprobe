Okay, so I've got this frequency modulation problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a frequency modulated wave has an angular carrier frequency ω_c of 5000 rad/sec, and the modulation index β is 10. The modulating signal m(t) is given as 20 cos(5t). I need to determine the bandwidth (BW) and the upper and lower sideband frequencies from the given options.

Hmm, right. I remember that in frequency modulation (FM), the bandwidth is determined by the modulation index and the modulating frequency. The formula for the bandwidth, if I recall correctly, is given by BW = 2β * f_m, where f_m is the modulating frequency. But wait, wait. Wait, actually, the formula BW = 2*(β + 1)*f_m comes to mind. Or is that for AM? No, no, wait. No, FM's bandwidth is a bit different because it's based on the number of sidebands. Oh right, the general formula for the bandwidth of an FM signal without modulation is just twice the modulating frequency, but when you have a modulation index greater than zero, the bandwidth increases.

Wait, I think the exact formula for the bandwidth (BW) in FM is BW = 2*(β + 1)*f_m. Or is it BW = 2*β*f_m? I need to get this straight. Oh wait, no, I think the correct formula is that the bandwidth is 2 times the sum of the highest frequency component in the modulating signal and the modulation index multiplied by that frequency. Or perhaps the bandwidth is 2*(β + 1)*f_m? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The basic idea is that the FM signal has multiple sidebands. The number of sidebands is determined by the modulation index β. The formula for the bandwidth is typically given as BW = 2*(β + 1)*f_m when the modulating signal is a single frequency. But wait, I'm not sure if that's right. Alternatively, I've heard that for FM, the bandwidth is approximately 2 times the deviation plus twice the modulating frequency. Or wait, the maximum deviation is β times the modulating frequency.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by first finding the frequency components involved. The modulating signal is m(t) = 20 cos(5t). The angular frequency of the modulating signal is ω_m = 5 rad/s. So the modulating frequency f_m is ω_m divided by 2π, right? So f_m = 5/(2π) Hz. Let me calculate that. 5 divided by 6.283 approximately equals 0.796 Hz. Hmm, that's a low frequency.

The modulation index β is given as 10. So the maximum frequency deviation Δf would be β times f_m. So Δf = 10 * (5/(2π)) ≈ 10 * 0.796 ≈ 7.96 Hz.

Wait, but bandwidth in FM is given by the range from the lower sideband to the upper sideband. The carrier frequency is in the middle. So the lower sideband is at (fc - (Δf + f_m)) and the upper sideband is at (fc + (Δf + f_m)). Or wait, perhaps I got that mixed up. Wait, no, the sidebands are spaced at a distance of the modulating frequency from the carrier. But when there's a modulation index, the deviation is β times the modulating frequency. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the maximum frequency deviation and how that affects the sidebands.

Wait, another approach: the total bandwidth of an FM signal is generally given by BW = 2*(β + 1)*f_m. So if β is 10 and f_m is 5/(2π) Hz, then BW would be 2*(10+1)*(5/(2π)).

Let me calculate that: 2 * 11 * (5/(2π)) = (22)*(5/(2π)) )= (110)/(2π) ≈ 55/π ≈ 17.5 Hz. Oh, wait, that's about 17.5 Hz for the bandwidth.

But looking at the options, let's see. Option F says bandwidth is 17.51 Hz. That's very close to my calculation. Hmm. So that might be the correct BW.

Now, the upper and lower sideband frequencies. The carrier frequency is given as ω_c = 5000 rad/s. To find the sidebands, I need to convert that to Hz. Since ω = 2πf, so f_c = ω_c/(2π) = 5000/(2π) ≈ 5000 / 6.283 ≈ 796 Hz. Wait, that's the carrier frequency in Hz.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait a second. Wait, no. Wait, the modulating signal is 20 cos(5t), so the modulating frequency f_m is 5/(2π) Hz, which is about 0.796 Hz, as I calculated earlier. So the maximum deviation is Δf = β * f_m = 10 * 0.796 ≈ 7.96 Hz.

So the maximum frequency of the FM wave is f_c + Δf, and the minimum is f_c - Δf. But wait, the sidebands are located at f_c ± (f_m + Δf)? Or is it f_c ± (f_m + nβ)? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in FM, the sidebands are spaced at intervals of the modulating frequency away from the carrier. The number of sidebands depends on the modulation index. Each pair of sidebands (upper and lower) is spaced by (k * f_m), where k is an integer.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the instantaneous frequency as f_c + β f_m cos(ω_m t). So the maximum frequency is f_c + β f_m, and the minimum is f_c - β f_m. Therefore, the upper sideband frequency is f_c + β f_m, and the lower sideband is f_c - β f_m. But wait, no, that's not right because f_m is the modulating frequency. But the sidebands in FM are actually at f_c ± (n f_m), where n is an integer up to the modulation index.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the sidebands are at f_c ± (f_m), and the deviation is β times f_m. So the maximum frequency is f_c + β f_m, and the minimum is f_c - β f_m. Therefore, the bandwidth is from (f_c - (β f_m + f_m)) to (f_c + (β f_m + f_m)), which would make BW = 2*(β + 1)*f_m. Oh, wait, but that's consistent with the formula I used earlier.

So given that, let's compute the upper and lower sideband frequencies. The maximum deviation is β f_m, so the upper sideband is at f_c + f_m + β f_m = f_c + (β + 1) f_m. Similarly, the lower sideband would be f_c - (β + 1) f_m. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the sidebands are at f_c ± (k f_m), where k is 1,2,... up to β. But when β is an integer, the highest sideband is at f_c ± β f_m. Wait, but in any case, the maximum frequency would be f_c + β f_m, and the minimum would be f_c - β f_m. Therefore, the upper sideband is f_c + β f_m and the lower sideband is f_c - β f_m. So the bandwidth would be (f_c + β f_m) - (f_c - β f_m) ) = 2 β f_m.

Wait, but earlier I thought the BW was 2*(β+1)*f_m, so now I'm getting conflicting results. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should refer to Carson's rule for FM bandwidth. Carson's rule states that the bandwidth is approximately 2(Δf + f_m), where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation. Since Δf = β f_m, the bandwidth becomes 2(β f_m + f_m) )= 2f_m (β +1 ). So that would make the bandwidth 2*(β +1 )*f_m.

In this case, β is 10, f_m is 5/(2π) Hz. So BW = 2*(10 +1 )*(5/(2π)) )= 2*11*(5/(2π)) )= (22)*(5/(2π)) )= (110)/(2π) )= 55/π ≈ 17.5 Hz. So that's the same as before. So the BW is approximately 17.5 Hz, which matches option F.

Now, the upper and lower sideband frequencies would be f_c ± (Δf + f_m ). Wait, according to Carson's rule, the bandwidth is 2*(Δf + f_m ), so the total range is from f_c - (Δf + f_m ) to f_c + (Δf + f_m ). So the lower sideband is f_c - (Δf + f_m ), and the upper is f_c + (Δf + f_m ).

Wait, but wait: for an FM signal, the maximum frequency is f_c + Δf, and the minimum is f_c - Δf. So the highest sideband is f_c + Δf, and the lowest is f_c - Δf. But the sidebands are actually spread out in steps of f_m. So the upper sideband is f_c + (Δf + f_m )? Or is it f_c + Δf? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing concepts here.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the sidebands are at frequencies f_c ± n f_m, where n is an integer up to β. So the highest sideband is at f_c + β f_m, and the lowest is f_c - β f_m. So the total bandwidth is 2 β f_m. But according to Carson's rule, it's 2(β +1 ) f_m. Hmm, so there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Carson's rule because it's a standard approximation. According to Carson's rule, the bandwidth is 2(β +1 )f_m. So the maximum and minimum frequencies would be f_c + (β +1 )f_m and f_c - (β +1 )f_m. Wait, no, that would make the BW 2*(β +1 ) * 2 f_m? No, wait, no.

Wait, let me clarify. The maximum frequency deviation is Δf = β f_m. So the maximum frequency is f_c + Δf = f_c + β f_m. Similarly, the minimum is f_c - β f_m. But the sidebands themselves are spaced at intervals of f_m from the carrier. So the first upper sideband is at f_c + f_m, and the second at f_c + 2 f_m, etc., up to f_c + β f_m. Similarly for the lower sidebands.

So the total bandwidth, which is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in the FM signal, would be from (f_c - β f_m) to (f_c + β f_m), which is a total bandwidth of 2 β f_m. But wait, that's conflicting with Carson's rule which says 2(β +1 ) f_m.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing two different things. Let me check my notes. Oh wait, I think in Carson's rule, it's an approximation that accounts for the fact that the sidebands extend beyond just β f_m. Because even though the modulation index is β, the sidebands go up to β f_m, but the way the bandwidth is calculated includes the entire range from the lowermost to uppermost sideband. Alternatively, maybe I should think that the bandwidth is the maximum frequency minus the minimum frequency, which would be [f_c + β f_m] - [f_c - β f_m] = 2 β f_m. So that's the total BW.

Wait, but according to what I calculated earlier using Carson's rule, the BW is 2(β +1 )f_m. Now I'm getting confused because there's a discrepancy between 2β f_m and 2(β +1 )f_m.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the problem. The modulating signal is m(t) = 20 cos(5t). So the angular frequency is 5 rad/s. So f_m is 5/(2π) ≈ 0.796 Hz. The modulation index β is 10, so Δf = β f_m ≈ 7.96 Hz. So the maximum frequency is f_c + Δf, and the minimum is f_c - Δf.

But f_c is given in angular terms as ω_c = 5000 rad/s. So to get f_c in Hz, we divide by 2π: f_c = 5000/(2π) ≈ 5000 / 6.283 ≈ 796.19 Hz.

So the upper sideband frequency is f_c + Δf ≈ 796.19 + 7.96 ≈ 804.15 Hz.

The lower sideband frequency is f_c - Δf ≈ 796.19 - 7.96 ≈ 788.23 Hz.

Wait, but wait a second. The modulating signal has a frequency of f_m, and the sidebands are at f_c ± f_m, but with the modulation index affecting the number of sidebands and their amplitudes.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it is. Let's think: the bandwidth is the range from the lowest frequency component to the highest. So if the maximum frequency is f_c + β f_m and the minimum is f_c - β f_m, then the bandwidth BW = 2 β f_m.

But earlier using Carson's rule, I got BW = 2 (β +1 ) f_m. So which one is correct?

Wait, let's double-check. According to standard FM theory, the bandwidth is given by BW = 2 (β + 1 ) f_m. Wait, no, that's not correct. I think that when the modulating signal is a single frequency, the FM signal has an infinite number of sidebands, but their amplitudes decrease as you go further from the carrier. The highest sidebands are at a distance of β f_m from the carrier. So the maximum frequency deviation is β f_m, so the highest frequency is f_c + β f_m, and the lowest is f_c - β f_m. Thus, the total bandwidth is 2 β f_m.

Wait, but according to Carson's rule, the bandwidth is approximated as BW = 2 (β f_m + f_m ) )= 2 f_m (β + 1 ). So that would be a larger bandwidth than just 2 β f_m. So which is it?

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should calculate both possibilities and see which option matches.

First approach:

BW = 2 β f_m.

β =10, f_m=5/(2π) Hz.

BW = 2 *10*(5/(2π)) = (100)/(2π) ≈ 50/π ≈15.915 Hz. Approximately 15.915 Hz.

Second approach (Carson's rule):

BW = 2 (β +1 ) f_m = 2*(11)*(5/(2π)) )= (110)/(2π) ≈ 55/π ≈17.5 Hz.

Looking at the options, option F is 17.51 Hz, which is close to 17.5 Hz. So that suggests that the correct approach is using Carson's rule.

So the bandwidth is approximately 17.5 Hz.

Now, the sideband frequencies: according to the first approach, the upper sideband would be f_c + β f_m, and lower f_c - β f_m.

f_c is 796.19 Hz.

β f_m =10 * (5/(2π)) )≈10 *0.796≈7.96 Hz.

So upper sideband ≈796.19 +7.96≈804.15 Hz.

Lower sideband≈796.19 -7.96≈788.23 Hz.

But wait, let's compute using the exact values.

f_c = 5000/(2π) = 2500/π ≈ 796.19 Hz.

f_m =5/(2π)≈0.796 Hz.

β =10, so β f_m=7.96 Hz.

So upper sideband: f_c + β f_m = 796.19 +7.96≈804.15 Hz.

Lower sideband: 796.19 -7.96≈788.23 Hz.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option F: Bandwidth 17.51 Hz, lower sideband 778.3 Hz, upper 813.3 Hz.

Wait, that doesn't match my calculations. So I must have made a mistake. Because according to my calculation, the lower sideband is around 788 Hz, and upper around 804 Hz, but option F's lower is 778.3 and upper is 813.3. That's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sidebands. Alternatively, perhaps the sidebands are at f_c ± (f_m + β f_m )= f_c ± f_m (β +1 ). Let me try that.

So f_c ± (β +1 ) f_m.

β+1=11. So 11 * f_m = 11 * (5/(2π)) )=55/(2π)≈8.73 Hz.

So upper sideband: 796.19 +8.73≈804.92 Hz.

Lower sideband:796.19 -8.73≈787.46 Hz.

Hmm, that's closer to my previous calculation but still doesn't match any option exactly.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option F: BW 17.51, lower 778.3, upper 813.3.

Wait, 778.3 is about 796.19 -17.89 Hz. 813.3 is about 796.19 +17.11 Hz. So the difference between upper and lower is 813.3 -778.3=35 Hz, which would correspond to a BW of 35 Hz. But that can't be right because our BW was 17.5.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing angular frequency and Hz. Wait, the carrier is given as ω_c =5000 rad/sec. So f_c is 5000/(2π)≈796.19 Hz. The modulating frequency is 5 rad/sec, so f_m=5/(2π)≈0.796 Hz.

Wait, but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the sideband frequencies differently.

Wait,
