Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Steve King is buying dress slacks on sale. The price is $33.15 for two pairs. And the sales tax is 5.5%. The question is asking how much he'll pay for four pairs.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to find the cost for four pairs. Since two pairs cost $33.15, I can find the price for one pair and then multiply by four. Or maybe just multiply the two-pair price by two. Oh wait, yeah, that makes sense. Because four is two times two, so 33.15 times 2 would give the pre-tax cost for four pairs.

Let me do that calculation. 33.15 multiplied by 2. Let's see, 33 times 2 is 66, and 0.15 times 2 is 0.30, so altogether that's 66.30. So the total before tax is $66.30.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says he's buying four pairs. So yes, 2 pairs at 33.15, so four would be 33.15 * 2. So 33.15 * 2 is 66.30.

Now, I need to calculate the sales tax on this amount. The tax rate is 5.5%. So I have to find 5.5% of 66.30 and add it to the total.

Alternatively, I can multiply 66.30 by 1.055 to get the total including tax. Let me think which is easier.

Calculating the tax first: 5.5% as a decimal is 0.055. So 66.30 * 0.055 equals... let me compute that.

Let me break it down. 66 * 0.055 is... 0.055 times 60 is 3.3, and 0.055 times 6 is 0.33, so 3.3 + 0.33 is 3.63. Then, the 0.30 part: 0.3 *0.055 is 0.0165. So adding that to 3.63 gives 3.6465. So approximately $3.6465 in tax.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately. 66.30 times 0.055. Let me compute 66.30 * 0.05 and 66.30 * 0.005 and add them.

0.05 of 66.30 is 3.315. 0.005 of 66.30 is 0.3315. Adding them together: 3.315 + 0.3315 = 3.6465. So yeah, same as before.

So the tax is $3.6465. Now, adding that to the pre-tax amount of $66.30.

66.30 + 3.6465 = 69.9465. So approximately $69.95 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see a 69.95 as the correct option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option F is $69.95. So is that the answer? But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total differently. Maybe calculate the unit price first and then apply tax. Let's see.

Each pair is 33.15 divided by 2. 33.15 / 2 is 16.575 per pair. So four pairs would be 16.575 *4.

16.575 *4: 16 *4 is 64, 0.575 *4 is 2.3. So 64 +2.3 is 66.30. So same as before, so that's correct.

Now, applying tax on 66.30 at 5.5%. Let me compute 66.30 *1.055.

Hmm, 66.30 * 1.055. Let's compute 66.30 *1 = 66.30. 66.30 *0.05 is 3.315. 66.30 *0.005 is 0.3315. So adding 66.30 +3.315 + 0.3315.

66.30 +3.315 is 69.615. 69.615 +0.3315 is 69.9465, which as before is 69.95 when rounded.

So the total cost is $69.95, which is option F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A to J. Let me list them:

A: 68.40  
B:74.10  
C:71.85  
D:67.00  
E:72.00  
F:69.95  
G:65.80  
H:66.30  
I:70.50  
J:73.20  

So F is 69.95, which is what I got. So that's the answer.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Maybe using total cost for four pairs including tax.

Alternatively, compute the tax first on the two-pair price, then multiply by two.

Wait, no. Because the tax applies to the total amount. So the correct way is to find the total for four pairs, then apply tax.

But wait, perhaps I should calculate the tax per pair and then multiply. Let me think.

Each pair is 16.575. Tax per pair would be 16.575 *0.055. Let's compute that: 16 *0.055 is 0.88, and 0.575 *0.055 is approximately 0.031625. So total tax per pair is around 0.88 +0.031625 = 0.911625. Then for four pairs, tax would be 4 *0.911625 = 3.6465, same as before. So total is 66.30 +3.6465=69.9465, which is 69.95.

So yes, I think F is correct.

Wait, but looking back, maybe I've missed something. Let me check the initial price again. The problem says "dress slacks on sale at $33.15 for two pairs." So that's correct, two pairs for 33.15.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the tax per each two pairs. Wait, but that's not correct because tax is applied on the total amount, not per item. So the correct approach is to find the total for four pairs, then apply tax.

So yeah, I think F is correct.

To determine how much Steve King pays for four pairs of slacks, we start by calculating the cost for four pairs before tax. Since two pairs cost $33.15, four pairs will cost:

\[
33.15 \times 2 = 66.30
\]

Next, we calculate the sales tax of 5.5% on the total pre-tax amount of $66.30. Sales tax is computed as:

\[
66.30 \times 0.055 = 3.6465
\]

Adding the sales tax to the pre-tax amount gives the total cost:

\[
66.30 + 3.6465 = 69.9465
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total cost is $69.95. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**F: $69.95**
