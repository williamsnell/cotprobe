Question:

A steel cylinder contains liquid at a mean bulk temperature of 80°F. Steam condensing at 212°F on the outside surface is used for heating the liquid. The coefficient of heat transfer on the steam side is 1,000 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F. The liquid is agitated by the stirring action of a turbine impeller. Its diameter is 2 ft., and it moves at an angular velocity of 100 rpm. The cylinder is 6 ft. long, with a diameter of 6 ft. and a wall thickness of 1/8 in. The thermal conductivity of steel may be taken as 9.4 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F. Properties of the liquid, taken as constant, are: c_p = 0.6 Btu/lbm-°Fk = 0.1 Btu/hr-ft-°F \rho = 60lbm/ft^3 The viscosity at 130°F is 653.4lbm/ft-hr, and at 212°F is 113.74lbm/ft-hr.

Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the time required to raise the temperature of a liquid in a steel cylinder using steam condensation. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably identify all the given information. The cylinder has liquid at a mean bulk temperature of 80°F, and steam condensing at 212°F is heating it. The steam side has a heat transfer coefficient of 1000 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. The liquid is agitated by a turbine impeller with a diameter of 2 ft and moving at 100 rpm. The cylinder is 6 ft long, diameter 6 ft, and wall thickness 1/8 inch. The thermal conductivity of steel is 9.4 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

The liquid's properties are: specific heat (c_p) 0.6 Btu/lbm-°F, thermal conductivity (k) 0.1 Btu/hr-ft-°F, and density (rho) 60 lbm/ft³. Viscosity at 130°F is 653.4 lbm/ft-hr and at 212°F it's 113.74 lbm/ft-hr.

The goal is to find the time to raise the bulk temperature to 180°F.

Hmm, okay. So this is a heat transfer problem, probably involving convection and conduction. Since the liquid is agitated, I think the main mode of heat transfer would be forced convection. But because the steam is condensing on the outside, the heat has to go through the steel cylinder wall to the liquid.

I remember that in such cases, the overall heat transfer coefficient (U) is important. U is calculated considering the resistances in series: steam side, steel wall, and liquid side.

Wait, right. The formula is 1/U = 1/h_steam + (wall thickness)/(k_steel) + 1/h_liquid. Because each of these contributes a resistance to heat transfer.

But wait, in this case, the steam is condensing, so the heat transfer coefficient for the steam side (h_steam) is given as 1000. The steel wall's resistance is (thickness)/(k_steel), which is (1/8 inch converted to feet) divided by 9.4.

But what about the liquid side? Hmm. Because the liquid is agitated, we'll need to calculate the convective heat transfer coefficient (h_liquid) using the appropriate correlation, probably the dimensionless numbers like Reynolds, Prandtl, and Nusselt.

So first, I'll need to find h_liquid. Agitated liquids often use the impeller Reynolds number for determining turbulent flow. The formula I remember is the Reynolds number (Re) equals (impeller diameter * angular velocity * conversion factor) / viscosity. Oh wait, angular velocity in rpm needs to be converted to rad/s, but I think I saw a formula where Re = (n * D^2) / ν, where n is in rev/s and D is diameter.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The impeller Reynolds number is Re = (ω * D²) / ν, where ω is in radians per second. So yes, I need to convert 100 rpm to rad/s.

Right, 100 rpm is 100/60 rev/s, which is about 1.6667 rev/s. Each revolution is 2π radians, so ω = 1.6667 * 2π ≈ 10.472 rad/s.

Then, the diameter D is 2 ft. So Re = (10.472 * (2)^2) / ν. But wait, the viscosity depends on temperature. The liquid's initial temp is 80°F, but it's being heated. I'm not sure if the viscosity is taken at the initial or the final condition. The problem gives viscosity at 130°F and 212°F. Maybe we can take an average or use the initial temp. Or wait, perhaps we can calculate the viscosity at the average temperature, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Alternatively, maybe we can use the initial viscosity for the Re calculation.

Wait, the problem gives the viscosity at 130°F and 212°F. So perhaps we can interpolate to find the viscosity at the bulk temperature as it changes. But that complicates things because viscosity is temperature-dependent, and the bulk temperature is changing over time. Hmm, maybe the problem expects us to use the viscosity at the initial temperature for the Re calculation. Let me check the given data: at 130°F, it's 653.4, and at 212°F, 113.74. So when the liquid is at 80°F, which is lower than 130°F, the viscosity must be higher than 653.4. But wait, I don't have the value at 80°F. Oh, that's a problem. Hmm, perhaps I'm to assume that the viscosity is roughly the average of the two given temperatures, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe we're to assume that since the liquid is being heated, the viscosity decreases, but without the exact value, perhaps we need to proceed with an approximation.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to use the initial temperature's viscosity, but since we don't have it, perhaps we can ignore it and proceed with the given data. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the value at 130°F as an approximation. Let me proceed with that for now, keeping in mind that this is an assumption.

So, using ν = 653.4 lbm/ft-hr at 130°F, but wait, the initial temperature is 80°F, which is lower than 130°F, so actual ν is higher than 653.4. Without knowing exact value, maybe the problem expects us to use the lower value, or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the given data as is.

Wait, perhaps I should use the average of the two given viscosities. At 130°F: 653.4, at 212°F: 113.74. The average is roughly (653.4 + 113.74)/2 ≈ 383.57 lbm/ft-hr. But this is a guess; I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects to take the initial temperature's viscosity, but since it's not provided, maybe it's supposed to use the lower value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the value at 130°F. Maybe I should proceed with that, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the viscosity is not a major factor here because the Re is so high that the flow is turbulent, making the choice of ν less critical. Let me proceed and see where it goes.

So, Re = (ω D²) / ν. Let's calculate ω first. 100 rpm is 100 rev/min * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 s) )= (100 * 2π) /60 ≈ 10.472 rad/s.

D is 2 ft, so D² is 4 ft².

ν is 653.4 lbm/ft-hr. Wait, units: Re is dimensionless, so the units should work out. Let me confirm: ω is in 1/s (rad/s), D is ft, so D² is ft². ν is in ft²/s? Wait, no. Wait, kinematic viscosity ν has units of ft²/s. But here, the given viscosity is in lbm/ft-hr. Hmm, perhaps I need to convert that to ft²/s.

Wait, dynamic viscosity (mu) is in lbm/ft-hr. To get kinematic viscosity (nu), we need mu/rho. So nu = mu/(rho). Because rho is 60 lbm/ft³.

So, for mu at 130°F: 653.4 lbm/ft-hr. So nu = 653.4 / 60 ≈ 10.89 ft²/hr. But wait, to get it in ft²/s, divide by 3600 s/hr: 10.89 / 3600 ≈ 0.003026 ft²/s.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try computing Re.

Re = (omega * D^2) / nu

Omega is 10.472 rad/s.

D is 2 ft, so D²=4 ft².

nu is 10.89 ft²/hr. Wait, that can't be right because units for Re must be unitless. So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, 1 ft²/hr is equal to (1/3600) ft²/s. So nu in ft²/s is 10.89 / 3600 ≈ 0.003026 ft²/s.

So Re = (10.472 * 4) / 0.003026 ≈ (41.888) / 0.003026 ≈ around 13,840. That's a high Reynolds number, which suggests turbulent flow.

Since Re is about 13,800, which is well above the turbulent threshold of around 10,000, so the flow is turbulent. So I can use a turbulent flow correlation for the Nusselt number.

The typical correlation for turbulent flow in agitated vessels is the Reynolds analogy or other correlations, but perhaps I should use the standard Nusselt number correlation for turbulent flow, like Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33, where Pr is the Prandtl number.

Prandtl number (Pr) is (mu * c_p) / k. Wait, but here, mu is dynamic viscosity, so let me compute that. Wait, earlier I calculated nu as 10.89 ft²/hr, which is (mu/rho). So mu = nu * rho. So mu = 10.89 ft²/hr * 60 lbm/ft³. Wait, ft²/hr is (ft * ft)/hr. So mu would be (ft²/hr * lbm/ft³) )= lbm/(ft·hr), which matches the given units for mu (lbm/ft-hr).

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:

Given mu at 130°F is 653.4 lbm/ft-hr. So nu = mu / rho = 653.4 /60 = 10.89 ft²/hr. Wait, but 1 ft²/hr is 1/(3600) ft²/s. So in ft²/s, it's 10.89 / 3600 ≈ 0.003026 ft²/s.

So Pr = (mu * c_p) / k.

Wait, wait, no. Pr = (mu * c_p) / k, but using consistent units.

Alternatively, since nu = mu/(rho), and Pr = (nu * rho * c_p) / k. Wait, but that's the same as (mu c_p)/(k). Let me compute that.

mu is 653.4 lbm/ft-hr.

c_p is 0.6 Btu/lbm-°F.

k is 0.1 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

So Pr = (mu * c_p) / k.

Hmm, let's compute that.

mu = 653.4 lbm/ft-hr.

So, (653.4 lbm/ft-hr) * (0.6 Btu/lbm-°F) )= 392.04 (lbm·Btu)/(ft-hr-lbm-°F) ) Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing units. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Pr using the formula Pr = (mu * c_p) / k.

So, mu is 653.4 lbm/ft-hr.

c_p is 0.6 Btu/lbm-°F.

k is 0.1 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

So, mu * c_p = 653.4 * 0.6 = 392.04 (lbm·Btu)/(ft-hr-lbm-°F) ) → simplifies to (Btu)/(ft-hr-°F).

Then, divided by k (0.1 Btu/hr-ft-°F), so 392.04 / 0.1 = 3920.4. So Pr is 3920.4. That's a high Prandtl number, which makes sense for viscous liquids.

Wait, but wait, that seems too high. Let me check the units again. Let me make sure I'm using correct units for Pr.

Pr = (mu * c_p) / k.

mu is in lbm/ft-hr.

c_p is in Btu/lbm-°F.

k is in Btu/hr-ft-°F.

So, when you multiply mu (lbm/ft-hr) by c_p (Btu/lbm-°F), you get (lbm * Btu)/(ft-hr-lbm-°F) ) → (Btu)/(ft-hr-°F).

Then, dividing by k, which is (Btu)/(hr-ft-°F), so the units become (Btu)/(ft-hr-°F) ) / (Btu)/(hr-ft-°F) ) → (Btu * hr-ft-°F) ) / (Btu * ft-hr-°F) ) → unitless, correct for Pr.

So, the calculation gives Pr ≈ 3920.4.

Now, using the Nusselt number correlation for turbulent flow: Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33.

So, Re is 13,840.

So, Re^0.8: Let's compute 13840^0.8.

Wait, 13840 is approximately 1.384e4.

Take natural logs: ln(13840) ≈ ln(1.384e4) = ln(1.384) + ln(1e4) ≈ 0.326 + 9.2103 ≈ 9.536.

Multiply by 0.8: 9.536 * 0.8 ≈ 7.629.

Exponentiate: e^7.629 ≈ 2040.

Wait, that seems high, but let me check with actual calculation.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 13840^0.8.

Alternatively, using logarithms:

log10(13840) ≈ 4.1408 (since 10^4=10000, 13840 is 1.384 *10^4 → log10(1.384)=0.1408 → total 4.1408.

Multiply by 0.8 → 3.3126.

So 10^3.3126 ≈ 10^0.3126 * 10^3 → approx 2.04 * 1000 = 2040. So yes, Re^0.8 ≈ 2040.

Pr is 3920.4, so Pr^0.33: Let's compute that.

Compute ln(3920.4) ≈ 8.275.

Multiply by 0.33 → 2.7308.

Exponentiate: e^2.7308 ≈ 15.43.

So Pr^0.33 ≈ 15.43.

Now, Nu = 0.023 * 2040 * 15.43 ≈ 0.023 * 2040 ≈ 46.92, then 46.92 * 15.43 ≈ let's see: 46.92 * 15 = 703.8, 46.92 * 0.43 ≈ 20.18, so total ≈ 723.98.

So Nu ≈ 724.

Then, the heat transfer coefficient h_liquid = (Nu * k) / D.

Wait, k here is the thermal conductivity of the liquid, which is 0.1 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

D is the diameter of the impeller, 2 ft.

So h_liquid = (724 * 0.1) / 2 = (72.4) / 2 = 36.2 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because in some correlations, the characteristic length is the impeller diameter, so yes, D is 2 ft.

So h_liquid is 36.2 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Now, let's compute the overall heat transfer coefficient U.

1/U = 1/h_steam + (wall thickness)/(k_steel) + 1/h_liquid.

h_steam is 1000.

Wall thickness is 1/8 inch. Convert to feet: 1/8 inch = 1/(8*12) ft = 1/96 ft ≈ 0.0104167 ft.

k_steel is 9.4 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

So the wall's contribution is (0.0104167 ft) / (9.4 Btu/hr-ft-°F) ) ≈ 0.001108 hr-ft²-°F/Btu.

h_liquid is 36.2, so 1/h_liquid ≈ 0.02763 hr-ft²-°F/Btu.

h_steam is 1000, so 1/h_steam = 0.001.

So 1/U = 0.001 + 0.001108 + 0.02763 ≈ 0.029738.

So U ≈ 1 / 0.029738 ≈ 33.66 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, is this correct? Because the steam side is 1000, which is much higher than the liquid side 36, so the liquid side is the main resistance, which makes sense.

Now, with U known, we can proceed to calculate the heat transfer rate.

The heat required to raise the temperature of the liquid from 80°F to 180°F is Q = m * c_p * ΔT.

The mass of the liquid is needed. The cylinder's volume is π*(D/2)^2 * length. The diameter is 6 ft, so radius 3 ft, length 6 ft. Volume V = π*(3)^2 *6 = π*9*6 = 54π ft³ ≈ 169.646 ft³.

Density rho is 60 lbm/ft³, so mass m = rho * V = 60 * 169.646 ≈ 10,178.76 lbm.

ΔT is 100°F (from 80 to 180).

So Q = 10178.76 lbm * 0.6 Btu/lbm-°F * 100°F = 10178.76 * 60 = 610,725.6 Btu.

Wait, but that's the total heat required. The heat transfer rate is Q_dot = U * A * ΔT. But wait, we also have to consider the area A. Since the cylinder is 6 ft long and 6 ft diameter, the surface area is the area of the cylinder's side. Area A = 2πr * L = 2π*(3 ft)*6 ft = 36π ≈ 113.097 ft².

Wait, but wait, the heating is done via the cylinder's wall, so the area is the surface area in contact with the liquid, which is the inside surface of the cylinder. So yes
