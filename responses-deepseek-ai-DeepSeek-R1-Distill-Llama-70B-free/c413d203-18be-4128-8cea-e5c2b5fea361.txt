Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about burglary, and I need to figure out which of the options A, B, or C constitutes a burglary. I'm a bit rusty on criminal law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that burglary is defined as the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. The key elements are: (1) unauthorized entry, (2) into a building, (3) at the time of entry, the intent to commit a felony inside.

So I need to analyze each option to see if all these elements are met.

Let's start with option A: A defendant breaks into a house during a snowstorm, seeking shelter. He then finds a transistor radio the next morning and takes it before leaving.

Breaking in without permission is the unauthorized entry. So that's the first element. The house is a building, so that's the second. Now, the intent part. At the time he entered, what was his intention? He was seeking shelter because of the storm. So, his initial intent was just to get out of the cold, not to commit a felony like theft. The theft happened the next morning when he found the radio. But burglary requires the intent at the time of entry. Since he didn't have the intent to steal when he broke in, this might not count as burglary. Instead, it might be theft after unlawful entry, but not burglary. So A might not be the correct answer.

Moving on to option B: A defendant sees a homeowner through a window, gets angry, picks up a brick, and throws it intending to kill the homeowner. So he's outside the home, throws a brick through the window. Did he enter the building? I don't think so. He just threw a brick through the window. There's no entry into the building. So without entering, it's not burglary. It could be attempted murder or vandalism, but not burglary because the entry element is missing. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: A defendant sees a guest at a hotel who he claims owes him money. After the guest retires to his room, the defendant breaks in and threatens him about the debt. So, breaking into the hotel room unauthorized. That's the entry part. The hotel room is a building, so that's covered. Now, intent. At the time of entry, what was his intent? He intended to threaten the guest regarding the money. Threatening someone could be considered assault or extortion, which are felonies. So at the time he broke in, he had the intent to commit a felony inside. All elements are present: unauthorized entry, into a building, with intent to commit a felony at the time of entry.

Wait, but is threatening someone about money considered a felony? I think making a threat could be assault, which is a felony depending on the jurisdiction. Also, if the intent was to extort money, that's a felony. So yes, the intent was there at the time of entry.

So option C meets all the criteria for burglary. A doesn't because intent was formed after entry. B doesn't because no entry occurred. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine which situation constitutes burglary, we analyze each option against the legal definition of burglary: the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony at the time of entry.

- **Option A**: The defendant entered the house unlawfully but did so to seek shelter, not with the intent to commit a felony. The theft occurred the next morning, after entry, so the intent to commit a felony was not present at the time of entry. This does not meet the criteria for burglary.

- **Option B**: The defendant threw a brick through the window with the intent to kill, but there was no entry into the building. Burglary requires unauthorized entry into a building, which is absent here. This is not burglary.

- **Option C**: The defendant unlawfully entered the hotel room with the intent to threaten the guest regarding a debt. Threatening someone can constitute a felony (e.g., assault or extortion). All elements of burglary are present: unauthorized entry, entry into a building, and intent to commit a felony at the time of entry.

The correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
