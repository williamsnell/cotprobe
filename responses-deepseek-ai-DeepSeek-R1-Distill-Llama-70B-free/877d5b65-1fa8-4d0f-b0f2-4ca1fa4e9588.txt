Okay, so I've got this question about amino acid requirements in human nutrition, and I need to figure out the correct statement from the options A to J. Hmm, I remember that amino acids are crucial because some are essential and others are non-essential. Wait, essential amino acids can't be made by the body, so we need to get them from our diet.

The question is about which statement is correct regarding human amino acid requirements. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The amino acid requirements for adults are assumed for all ages. I'm not sure about this. I remember that infants and children have different needs because they're growing. So maybe adults' requirements aren't the same as for others. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Breast milk's amino acid pattern is the requirement for all children. Well, breast milk is tailored for infants, right? But children older than infants might have different needs as they grow, especially as they start eating more solid foods. So B might not be correct either.

Option C: Infant requirements are assumed for maintenance in all ages. Maintenance usually refers to what adults need to sustain their bodies without growth. But infants are growing rapidly, so their requirements are higher. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D: Animal protein's amino acid pattern is the requirement for adults. Animal proteins are complete, meaning they have all essential amino acids. But does that mean their pattern is the standard? I think our requirement is based more on human needs than just animal sources. So D might not be correct.

Option E: Human tissue protein's pattern is the requirement for all ages. Human tissues are made of various proteins, and their amino acid composition probably reflects what our bodies need. So this might be the correct approach. But wait, do we use this for all ages or just specific groups?

Option F: Adult requirements are for maintenance in all ages. No, because children and infants need more for growth. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Human tissue protein's pattern is for infants and children. That makes sense because infants are building their bodies, so their required amino acids would align with tissue composition. But the question is about which option is correct. Let me think.

Option H: Breast milk's pattern is for all adults. No, adults have different needs, and breast milk is for infants, so H is wrong.

Option I: Elderly requirements are for all ages. Probably not, because the elderly have different needs, maybe less for growth but more for maintenance and health issues. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Children's requirements are for all ages. That doesn't sound right because adults don't need as much for growth. So J is wrong.

Wait, going back. The question is about which statement is correct. So E says human tissue protein's pattern is the requirement for all ages. Is that accurate? I think that the amino acid requirements are based on what the body needs to maintain tissues, so for adults, it's about maintenance. Infants and children need more for growth, so their requirements are higher. But the base pattern is probably similar, just the quantities vary.

Alternatively, I remember that the FAO/WHO/UNU 2007 report established amino acid requirements based on the amino acid composition of human tissues. Oh wait, no, I think they actually use the amino acid pattern of breast milk as the reference for infants, and for adults, they use the composition of human proteins. Or was it that the adult requirements are based on the amino acid composition of mixed proteins in the body?

Wait, another angle: I think that for infants, breast milk is considered the gold standard, so the amino acid pattern of breast milk is taken as the requirement for infants. For adults, the requirement is based on the composition of the body's proteins. Because when you break down and rebuild proteins, the body's tissues require certain amino acids. So the human tissue protein's amino acid pattern would be the basis for determining requirements across all ages.

So looking back, option E says that human tissue protein's pattern is assumed for all ages. Option G says it's for infants and young children. So which is correct?

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So if the correct approach is that the amino acid requirements are based on human tissue protein for all ages, then E is correct. But I thought that infants use breast milk as the standard. Maybe E is correct in a general sense, but perhaps the answer is G because it specifies infants and children.

Wait, no. I think the amino acid requirements for infants are indeed based on breast milk. For adults, it's based on their tissue maintenance. So the correct statements would be:

For infants, breast milk's amino acid pattern is the requirement (so B would be incorrect because it's for all children, not just infants). For adults, it's human tissue.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option E says human tissue is the requirement pattern for all ages. That can't be right because infants have higher requirements for growth. But maybe the pattern (the ratio) is similar, just the amounts differ.

Alternatively, the question is about the correct statement, not necessarily the scientific basis. The correct statement would be that the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is the requirement for all ages, which would be E.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) and other guidelines base the amino acid requirements on the body's needs. For infants, it's breast milk; for adults, it's the composition of body proteins. So the correct statement would be that the amino acid pattern of human tissue is the basis for adults, but not necessarily for all ages.

Looking back at the options, E says human tissue is the pattern for all ages. Is that correct? Or is it that human tissue is the basis for adults, while breast milk is for infants.

Hmm, if that's the case, then E is incorrect. Let's look for other options.

Option G: Human tissue is the pattern for infants and children. That doesn't seem right because infants are based on breast milk. So G is wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is D: animal protein's pattern is the adult requirement. But I thought that's not the case. Because animal proteins vary, and the human body's needs are specific.

Alternatively, the correct answer is E: human tissue for all ages. Or perhaps option D is incorrect because it's not the pattern, but the source.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct statement is E. Wait, no, I think I remember that the adult amino acid requirements are based on the composition of human proteins. So the correct answer would be E, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

E: The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for all ages.

Yes, this makes sense because the body's tissues require certain amino acids to maintain structure, so the requirements are based on that. Even though infants and children have higher amounts, the pattern (which amino acids are needed) is the same as in tissue proteins. So the correct answer is E.

To determine the correct statement about human amino acid requirements in nutrition, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Adult amino acid requirements are not assumed to apply to all ages, as infants and children have higher needs due to growth.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While breast milk is the gold standard for infants, it is not assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children, as older children have different needs.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Infant requirements are for growth, not maintenance, and cannot be applied to all ages.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While animal proteins are complete, human amino acid requirements are based on human tissue composition, not animal protein patterns.
- **Option E**: Correct. The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is used as the basis for determining requirements across all ages, as it reflects the body's needs for tissue maintenance and growth.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Adult requirements are for maintenance, but they do not apply universally to all ages.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While infants and children have higher needs, their requirements are based on breast milk, not human tissue protein.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Breast milk is for infants, not adults.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Elderly requirements are not assumed to apply to all ages.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Children's requirements are higher for growth and do not apply universally.

The correct statement is **E**, as the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is the basis for determining requirements across all ages, even though the amounts may vary depending on age and growth needs.
