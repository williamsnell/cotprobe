Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle. Hmm, I remember that gravitational acceleration isn't constant, especially when you're in orbit. Wait, but wait, isn't gravity what keeps the shuttle in orbit? Oh right, but the question is about the actual acceleration.

So the Space Shuttle is orbiting 300 km above Earth's surface. Earth's radius is 6,400 km. So the total distance from Earth's center must be 6,400 + 300 = 6,700 km. Got it.

I remember the formula for gravitational acceleration is g = G*M / r². G is the gravitational constant, right? Which I think is around 6.67e-11 N(m/kg)². And M is Earth's mass. Wait, but I might not need the exact values if I can relate it to Earth's surface gravity.

Oh wait, on Earth's surface, the radius is 6,400 km, so r is 6,400,000 meters. The gravitational acceleration there is 9.8 m/s². So maybe I can use that as a reference point.

So the idea is that the shuttle is at a distance r, which is greater than Earth's radius. So the gravitational acceleration should be less than 9.8 m/s². Because as you go further from Earth, gravity decreases.

So how much less? Let me think. The formula depends on the square of the distance. So (r_shuttle / r_earth) squared, but inverse because gravity decreases with distance.

Wait, let me write it out. Let me denote g as the shuttle's acceleration, and g0 as 9.8 m/s² on Earth's surface.

So g = g0 * (R_earth / (R_earth + h))².

Where h is 300 km. Wait, R_earth is 6,400 km, so h is much smaller than R. But not negligible, so I can't just approximate it as 9.8.

So plugging in the numbers: R_earth = 6400 km, h=300 km. So total r = 6700 km.

So, (R_earth / r) = 6400 / 6700. Let's compute that. 6400 divided by 6700. Hmm, 64/67 is approximately 0.9552. Wait, 67 times 0.955 is about 64. So square of that is (0.9552)^2. Let me compute that:

0.9552 * 0.9552. Let's see, 0.9^2 is 0.81, 0.05^2 is 0.0025, but wait, perhaps better to calculate step by step.

Wait, 9552 * 9552. Well, that's a bit tedious, but maybe approximate. Alternatively, think of 0.96 squared is about 0.9216. 0.955 is close to 0.96, so maybe 0.912?

Alternatively, 0.9552 squared:

(9600 - 48)^2 / (10^8) → No, perhaps it's easier to just multiply 0.955 * 0.955.

Let me calculate it:

0.955 * 0.955:

Let me do 955 * 955 first. 955^2. Hmm, (900 + 55)^2 = 900² + 2*900*55 + 55².

900² is 810,000.

2*900*55 = 2*49,500 =99,000.

55^2 is 3,025.

So total is 810,000 +99,000 = 909,000 + 3,025 = 912,025.

So 955^2 = 912,025. So 0.955^2 is 0.912025.

So approximately 0.912.

So g = 9.8 * 0.912 ≈ ?

9.8 * 0.9 is 8.82, and 9.8 * 0.012 is about 0.1176.

Adding them gives 8.82 + 0.1176 = 8.9376 m/s². Hmm, about 8.94 m/s².

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is option F:8.9 m/s². Or maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the numbers. Because 6400 / 6700 is indeed 64/67. Let me compute that more accurately.

64 divided by 67. Let's see, 67 * 0.955 is 64. So 64/67 = 0.955 approximately.

Wait, but 67 times 0.953 is?

67 * 0.95 is 63.65. 67 * 0.003 is 0.201. So 0.953 *67 = 63.65 + 0.201 = 63.851. Still a bit higher than 64. So maybe 0.955 is correct.

So (64/67)^2 is (approx 0.955)^2 = 0.912, as before.

So 9.8 * 0.912 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately:

0.9 *9.8 = 8.82

0.012 *9.8 = 0.1176

So 8.82 + 0.1176 = 8.9376 ≈8.94 m/s².

Looking at the options, option F is 8.9, which is close.

Wait, but wait, am I using the correct formula? Because in orbit, the gravitational acceleration provides the necessary centripetal force. So the formula is correct.

Alternatively, some might think that the shuttle experiences zero gravity, but that's only if you're in free fall, which the shuttle is. But the question is about the gravitational acceleration, not the apparent weightlessness. So zero is option A, which isn't right.

So the answer should be approximately 8.9 m/s², which is option F.

To determine the gravitational acceleration experienced by the Space Shuttle orbiting 300 km above Earth's surface, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration:

\[
g = g_0 \left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Earth}} + h}\right)^2
\]

Here:
- \( g_0 = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (gravitational acceleration at Earth's surface),
- \( R_{\text{Earth}} = 6,400 \, \text{km} = 6,400,000 \, \text{m} \),
- \( h = 300 \, \text{km} = 300,000 \, \text{m} \).

The total distance from Earth's center to the Space Shuttle is:

\[
r = R_{\text{Earth}} + h = 6,400,000 + 300,000 = 6,700,000 \, \text{m}.
\]

The ratio of distances is:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{r} = \frac{6,400,000}{6,700,000} \approx 0.9552.
\]

Squaring this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{Earth}}}{r}\right)^2 \approx (0.9552)^2 \approx 0.912.
\]

Substituting into the formula for \( g \):

\[
g = 9.8 \times 0.912 \approx 8.94 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

This value is closest to option **F: 8.9 m/s²**. The gravitational acceleration decreases with distance from Earth's center, and while the shuttle is in free fall, the question specifically asks for the gravitational acceleration, not the apparent weightlessness.

The correct answer is:

**F: 8.9 m/s²**
