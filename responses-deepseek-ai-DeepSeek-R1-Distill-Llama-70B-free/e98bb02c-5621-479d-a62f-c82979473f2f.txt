Okay, so I've got this question about public relations specialisations and which one relies on segmentation of the population into psychographics, demographics, and geodemographics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that public relations involves various areas like media relations, crisis management, employee relations, etc. The question is about segmentation methods. Segmentation into demographics (age, gender, income), psychographics (lifestyle, attitudes), and geodemographics (location-based data) is a marketing approach. So, I'm guessing it's related to a PR area that involves targeting specific audiences.

Looking at the options:
A: Employee relations - that's about internal communications with staff, maybe not so much external segmentation.
B: Public affairs - deals with government and policy, might involve some segmentation but not sure.
C: Crisis management - more about handling crises, maybe uses segmentation for messaging.
D: Government relations - similar to public affairs, focused on influencing policy.
E: Media relations - working with media, but not sure if heavy segmentation is key here.
F: Issues management - handling specific issues, perhaps uses some audience segmentation.
G: Investor relations - communicates with investors, important but maybe more financial data than demographics.
H: Community relations - engaging with local communities, could use geodemographics.
I: Corporate communications - overall company messaging, might use some segmentation.
J: Marketing communications - this sounds like it's directly about promoting products, so definitely uses segmentation.

Wait, the question is about public relations specialisations. Marketing communications is a subset of PR? Or is it more of a marketing field? I think marketing communications is a PR specialisation because it's about how a company communicates with its target audience to promote products or services. So, using psychographics, demographics, and geodemographics would be crucial here to tailor messages effectively.

So the answer is probably J: Marketing communications.
