Question:

In which of the following situations would the defendant's intoxication NOT be able to negate his criminal culpability?

Options:

A: A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.
B: After consuming a large amount of alcohol at a party, a defendant decided to set a neighbor's car on fire out of spite. He was seen by witnesses and later arrested and charged with arson.
C: A defendant had been drinking at a local pub and got into a heated argument with another patron. The argument escalated, and the defendant pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed the other patron. The defendant is arrested and charged with attempted murder.
D: A defendant had consumed a fifth of bourbon. Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.
E: A defendant spent the evening drinking at a bar. On his way home, he broke into a house, intending to steal valuables. However, he fell asleep on the couch before he could steal anything. He was discovered by the homeowners and arrested and charged with attempted robbery.
F: At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.
G: A defendant was drinking at a bar when he noticed a woman leave her purse unattended. He stole the purse and was later arrested and charged with theft.
H: A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.
I: A defendant had been drinking heavily at a friend's house. Later that evening, he decided to drive home despite being significantly over the legal blood alcohol limit. On the way, he ran a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The defendant is arrested and charged with vehicular manslaughter.
J: After a night of heavy drinking, a defendant broke into a jewelry store and stole several expensive items. He was caught on the store's surveillance cameras and later arrested and charged with burglary.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding when intoxication doesn't negate criminal culpability. Hmm. I remember that intoxication can sometimes be a defense, but it depends on the type of crime charged.

The question asks in which situation the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate their culpability. So I need to figure out for each option whether intoxication would be a valid defense or not.

First, I should recall the different types of crimes and how intoxication applies. I think specific intent crimes are those where the defendant must have a specific intent beyond just the act itself. Like burglary requires intent to commit a felony inside, and assault with intent to commit another crime might also be specific.

If a crime is a specific intent crime, then voluntary intoxication can be a defense because it might prevent the defendant from forming that specific intent. But for general intent crimes, intoxication isn't a defense because the intent required is more basic.

Wait, but some jurisdictions might treat certain crimes as general or specific intent differently. So I need to be careful.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Conspiracy to commit robbery. Conspiracy requires an agreement and intent to commit the crime. I think conspiracy is a specific intent crime because you have to intentionally agree to commit a crime. So if someone was too drunk, maybe they couldn't form that intent. But wait, in this scenario, the defendant was plotting with buddies, so it's possible he had the intent even if drunk. But I'm not sure. The key is whether intoxication negates the required intent.

Option B: Arson. Arson is typically a specific intent crime because you have to intentionally set fire to property. If the defendant was so drunk he couldn't form that intent, maybe the defense applies. But if he did set the fire intentionally, even drunk, then maybe not. So the defense might negate culpability here.

Option C: Attempted murder with a stabbing. Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form that intent, the defense could apply. But if he actually intended to stab, maybe the intoxication isn't a defense. So in this case, if he pulled a knife and stabbed, perhaps the intent was there despite intoxication. But I'm not certain.

Option D: Assault with intent to commit rape. This is a specific intent crime because the intent is to commit rape. Intoxication might negate that specific intent, unless the defendant's actions show he had the intent regardless.

Option E: Attempted robbery. Attempt requires specific intent to commit robbery. If he was too drunk to form that intent, the defense might apply. But the scenario says he intended to steal but fell asleep. So perhaps he had the intent, but failed. Not sure if intoxication negates the intent here.

Option F: Statutory rape. This is a strict liability crime, I believe. The victim's age makes it illegal regardless of the defendant's knowledge. So even if the defendant was drunk and thought she was of age, it doesn't matter. Intoxication isn't a defense here because it's not about intent but about the fact (her age). So in this case, intoxication wouldn't negate culpability.

Option G: Theft. Theft usually requires intent to permanently deprive, so specific intent. If drunk, maybe couldn't form that intent. So intoxication could be a defense. Unless the defendant knew he was taking the purse, but being drunk might prevent that intent.

Option H: Assault with intent to commit battery. Assault is typically an intentional tort, so specific intent. If the defendant threw the tire iron, maybe he intended to hit someone, but if he was so drunk he couldn't form that intent, then the defense applies.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter. This is often a general intent or even negligence-based crime. But I'm not sure. Wait, manslaughter can be voluntary or involuntary. Vehicular manslaughter is usually due to recklessness or criminal negligence. Intoxication might actually increase culpability because being drunk impairs judgment. So in this case, intoxication wouldn't negate the culpability because it's not a specific intent crime. Or perhaps it's about recklessness, and intoxication can't negate recklessness.

Wait, but specific intent vs general. Vehicular manslaughter is typically a general intent crime, so intoxication isn't a defense. So the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate his culpability here.

Option J: Burglary. Burglary requires breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony. That's a specific intent crime. So if too drunk to form that intent, the defense applies.

So the question is which situation does intoxication NOT negate culpability. So looking for a scenario where intoxication isn't a valid defense.

From the options, Option F is statutory rape, which is strict liability. So intoxication isn't a defense. So in that case, the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate his culpability because the crime doesn't require intent regarding the victim's age.

Similarly, vehicular manslaughter (Option I) is a general intent crime, so intoxication isn't a defense. So in that case, it also wouldn't negate culpability.

Wait, so now I'm confused between F and I.

Statutory rape is strict liability, so no intent needed regarding the age. So even if the defendant was drunk and mistakenly thought she was over age, it's no defense. So in that case, the answer would be F.

Vehicular manslaughter, if it's a general intent crime, then intoxication isn't a defense. So in that case, the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate culpability as well. So both F and I could be correct?

Wait, the question is about which situation the intoxication would NOT be able to negate the culpability. So looking for a situation where the defense fails.

So the correct answer would be in a strict liability crime, like statutory rape (Option F) or vehicular manslaughter if it's a general intent crime.

But I think statutory rape is a strict liability offense, so F would definitely be a situation where intoxication doesn't negate culpability.

Vehicular manslaughter, depending on jurisdiction, might be considered as involuntary manslaughter, which is a general intent crime, so intoxication is not a defense. So both F and I could be correct, but I need to check the options again.

Wait, looking back:

Option F: Charged with statutory rape. The age of consent is 17, and the girl is 15 but looks older. The defendant is drunk, but it's statutory rape regardless of his belief about her age. So intoxication doesn't negate the offense. So F is correct.

Option I: Vehicular manslaughter. The defendant was driving drunk, ran a red light, hit a pedestrian. Manslaughter can be based on recklessness. Being drunk can actually show recklessness. Alternatively, some might say that intoxication can't negate recklessness because being voluntarily intoxicated shows disregard for safety. So in that case, the intoxication wouldn't negate the recklessness. So the defendant's intoxication wouldn't be a defense, making Option I another correct answer.

Wait, but the question is asking in which situation intoxication would NOT negate culpability. So if the crime requires specific intent, intoxication can be a defense. If it's general intent or strict liability, then it's not a defense.

So the correct options would be F and I, but I need to pick the one that's among the choices.

But wait, the options are from A to J, so perhaps more than one could fit, but the question is which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again.

Statutory rape is a strict liability offense, so intent is irrelevant. Therefore, intoxication (voluntary) is not a defense. So F is correct.

In the case of vehicular manslaughter, if it's based on recklessness, then voluntary intoxication doesn't negate recklessness. Because reckless is a subjective awareness of the risk, but when you're voluntarily drunk, you're responsible for the reckless conduct. So in that case, the intoxication wouldn't negate the culpability.

So both F and I are situations where intoxication wouldn't negate the defendant's culpability.

But looking back at the options, the question is asking for which ONE situation. So perhaps I need to check which crimes are strict liability or which don't require specific intent.

Wait, in the options, F is statutory rape and I is vehicular manslaughter. So which of these would not allow intoxication as a defense.

Wait, vehicular manslaughter could be considered as a crime where intoxication is actually evidence of recklessness, so it would not negate culpability. So in that case, I would be correct.

But I'm a bit confused because the answer can't be two options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about each option's crime:

A: Conspiracy. Specific intent. So intoxication could negate intent.

B: Arson. Specific intent. Intoxication possible defense.

C: Attempted murder. Specific intent. Possible defense.

D: Assault with intent to commit rape. Specific intent. Possible defense.

E: Attempted robbery. Specific intent. Possible defense.

F: Statutory rape. Strict liability. No defense.

G: Theft. Specific intent. Possible defense.

H: Assault with intent to commit battery. Specific intent. Possible defense.

I: Vehicular manslaughter. General intent. No defense.

J: Burglary. Specific intent. Possible defense.

So the correct answers would be F and I.

But the question is which one is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is F.

But wait, let me think again. The options are A to J, and the question is which situation does intoxication not negate culpability. So both F and I are possible, but the options only allow one answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about vehicular manslaughter. Maybe it's a specific intent crime, but I don't think so. Manslaughter is typically a general intent crime.

Wait, no. Manslaughter can be voluntary (heat of passion, specific intent?) or involuntary (recklessness or criminal negligence, general intent). Vehicular manslaughter is usually involuntary, based on recklessness, which is a general intent.

So in that case, intoxication wouldn't negate the recklessness because the defendant was aware of the risk (or should have been), and being drunk doesn't excuse that.

So Option I is another correct answer.

But since the question is multiple-choice and only one option is correct, perhaps F is the intended answer because statutory rape is a strict liability offense, making it clear that intoxication is not a defense.

So the correct answer would be F.

To determine in which situation the defendant's intoxication would NOT negate their criminal culpability, it is essential to analyze the nature of the crimes charged and whether intoxication can serve as a defense. Intoxication can sometimes negate culpability for specific intent crimes, as it may prevent the formation of the required intent. However, for general intent crimes or strict liability offenses, intoxication is generally not a valid defense.

### Analysis of Each Option:

- **A: Conspiracy to commit robbery**  
  Conspiracy requires specific intent to agree and commit a crime. Intoxication could potentially negate the ability to form this specific intent, making it a valid defense in some cases.

- **B: Arson**  
  Arson is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intentional act of setting fire to property. Intoxication could potentially negate the specific intent required, making it a valid defense.

- **C: Attempted murder**  
  Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill. If the defendant was too intoxicated to form this intent, intoxication could serve as a defense.

- **D: Assault with intent to commit rape**  
  This is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intent to commit rape. Intoxication could potentially negate the formation of this specific intent.

- **E: Attempted robbery**  
  Attempted robbery requires specific intent to commit robbery. Intoxication could potentially negate the ability to form this intent, making it a valid defense.

- **F: Statutory rape**  
  Statutory rape is a strict liability offense. The defendant's intent or belief about the victim's age is irrelevant, as the crime is based solely on the victim's age. Intoxication is not a valid defense in this case.

- **G: Theft**  
  Theft requires specific intent to permanently deprive someone of their property. Intoxication could potentially negate the ability to form this intent, making it a valid defense.

- **H: Assault with intent to commit battery**  
  This is a specific intent crime, as it requires the intent to commit battery. Intoxication could potentially negate the formation of this intent.

- **I: Vehicular manslaughter**  
  Vehicular manslaughter is typically a general intent crime based on recklessness or criminal negligence. Intoxication does not negate recklessness, as voluntary intoxication demonstrates a disregard for the risks of driving under the influence. Thus, intoxication would not negate culpability in this case.

- **J: Burglary**  
  Burglary requires specific intent to commit a felony upon unlawful entry. Intoxication could potentially negate the ability to form this specific intent, making it a valid defense.

### Conclusion:
The question asks for the situation where intoxication would NOT negate culpability. Both **F (statutory rape)** and **I (vehicular manslaughter)** fit this criterion. However, statutory rape is a strict liability offense, making it the clearest example where intoxication does not negate culpability. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

**F**
