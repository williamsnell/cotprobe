Question:

A mother has an 11-year-old daughter. The mother is legally separated from her husband and has filed for divorce. The mother and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother went out to dinner and left her daughter at home. Upon leaving the house, the mother locked the door to her bedroom. While the mother was gone, the daughter found a spare key to her mother's bedroom and opened the door. While rummaging through her mother's dresser, she found a bag containing white powder. Concerned that the bag might contain drugs, the daughter called her father to ask his advice. The husband instructed her to call the police. The daughter then telephoned the police station and reported what she had found. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to her home. The daughter allowed the police to come inside and led them to her mother's bedroom. She gave the officers the bag, which they took to the station house for a lab test. After the results confirmed that the bag contained cocaine, the mother was arrested and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The mother's attorney has filed a motion to prevent the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the daughter, and husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.
B: denied, because the police were acting on the daughter's concern for her mother's wellbeing.
C: denied, because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.
D: denied, because the daughter had a reasonable concern for her mother's safety.
E: denied, because the cocaine was found in a common area of the home, not a private space.
F: granted, because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.
G: granted, because the husband did not physically give consent for the police to enter the home.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me start by going through the scenario step by step. 

So, the setup is about a mother and daughter. The mother is legally separated and has filed for divorce. She and her husband own their home in joint tenancy. One night, the mother goes out, locks her bedroom door, and the daughter finds a spare key. The daughter goes into the bedroom, finds a bag of white powder, thinks it might be drugs, calls her dad, who tells her to call the police. The daughter then calls the police, lets them in, shows them the bag, and the police take it. The mother is arrested, and now her attorney is trying to suppress the evidence, claiming it was obtained illegally.

The question is whether the motion to suppress should be granted or denied. The options are A through G, with various reasons.

Hmm. So, the key issue here is whether the police entry into the home and the seizure of the cocaine were legal. Because if they were, then the evidence is admissible, and the motion is denied. If not, the motion is granted.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, police generally need a warrant to enter a home unless there's an exception. One exception is consent. So if someone with authority consents to the entry, the police can come in without a warrant.

Now, who has the authority to give consent here? The daughter is 11 years old. Can a minor give consent for a police search? I think the general rule is that a minor can consent, but there might be nuances. Also, the mother and the father are co-owners of the house, so both have authority. But the mother is the one who locked her bedroom, which might be considered her private area.

Wait, the daughter used a spare key to unlock the mother's bedroom. So she entered without the mother's permission. But then she called the police. The daughter let the police in. So the question is, did the daughter have the authority to let the police into the home, and then into the bedroom?

I recall that when two people jointly own a home, each has the authority to consent to a search of the entire premises. So if the daughter, as a co-owner, allowed the police in, that might be enough. But wait, the daughter is 11. Are there any cases where a minor's consent is valid? I think the Supreme Court has held that a minor can give consent, but it depends on the circumstances. In some cases, like when the minor is the primary resident or has responsibility for the area, their consent is valid.

Alternatively, the daughter's father, as a co-owner, could have given consent. But in this case, the daughter called the father, who told her to call the police. But the father wasn't present when the police came. So the daughter let them in. So the issue is whether the daughter's consent was sufficient.

Another angle is the concept of "apparent authority." The police might have reasonably believed that the daughter had authority to let them in. But if the daughter was a minor, would that affect the apparent authority? Maybe not, because the police might not know her age, and she's living there, so they could assume she has authority.

But wait, the mother's bedroom is a private space, even within the home. So even if the daughter can let the police into the house, does she have authority to let them into the mother's locked bedroom? Because the mother had locked it, indicating she expected privacy there.

I remember that in the case of a joint owner, each has the right to use the property, but not necessarily to give consent for areas exclusively used by another. For example, in the case where one spouse allows the police to search the other's private area, it's a bit tricky. The Supreme Court case of Georgia v. Randolph comes to mind. In that case, when one occupant gives consent, but another present occupant objects, the consent is invalid. But in this case, the mother wasn't present. So if the daughter, as a co-owner, gave consent, maybe that's enough.

But wait, the daughter is a minor. So does her age affect her ability to consent? I think the courts usually consider whether the minor has sufficient control over the premises. Since she lives there, maybe her consent is valid.

Alternatively, the mother had locked her bedroom, which might indicate that she expected privacy there, and the daughter didn't have authority to let the police in there. So the police entering the bedroom and seizing the evidence might have been an illegal search.

So, if the daughter didn't have authority to consent to the search of the bedroom, then the evidence would be suppressed. Therefore, the motion to suppress would be granted.

Looking at the options, option F says the motion should be granted because the daughter didn't have apparent authority to let the police into the bedroom. Option G says because the husband didn't give consent. But the husband wasn't there, so the daughter's consent is the issue.

So the correct answer would depend on whether the daughter had authority. Given that she's a minor and the room was locked, maybe she didn't have authority to let the police into the bedroom, making F the right choice.

The motion to suppress the evidence should be granted because the daughter, as an 11-year-old minor, did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's locked bedroom. Although she allowed the police into the home, the locked bedroom indicates a reasonable expectation of privacy, and her age and lack of authority over that private space make her consent insufficient to justify the search.

Answer: F
