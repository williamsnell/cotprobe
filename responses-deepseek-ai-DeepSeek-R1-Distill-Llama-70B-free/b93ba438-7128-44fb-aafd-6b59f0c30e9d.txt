Okay, so I'm trying to calculate the GDP for this economy that only produces cheese and crackers. Hmm, I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given time period. So, in this case, I need to find the total value of cheese and crackers produced.

The question gives me the prices and quantities for both goods. Cheese is $3 per pound, and 10 pounds are produced. Crackers are $2 per pound, with 20 pounds produced. 

Wait, right. GDP is calculated by multiplying the price of each good by the quantity produced, then adding them together. So for cheese, it's 3 dollars times 10 pounds. Let me do that math: 3 * 10 equals 30. So the value from cheese is $30.

Now for crackers, it's 2 dollars per pound times 20 pounds. 2 * 20 is 40. So crackers contribute $40.

Adding those together, 30 plus 40 makes 70. So the total GDP should be $70. 

Let me check the options. Option G is $70. So I think that's the correct answer.

To calculate GDP, multiply the price and quantity of each good and sum the results.

- Cheese: $3/lb * 10 lbs = $30  
- Crackers: $2/lb * 20 lbs = $40  
- Total GDP = $30 + $40 = $70  

The correct answer is G.
