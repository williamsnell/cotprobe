Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this biology question here. Let me read it carefully and see what it's about.

The question says that a group of pelicans from the same species separated because of an unsuccessful migration. Then, 150 years later, they reunite but can't produce offspring. So, the question is asking what this scenario is an example of, and I have to choose from options A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when populations of the same species become geographically isolated, they can develop into different species over time. That process is called speciation. Now, the key here is the type of speciation. I think there are a couple of main types: allopatric and sympatric.

Allopatric speciation happens when populations are physically separated by a barrier, like a mountain or a river, and they can't interbreed. Over time, they evolve into different species. Sympatric speciation is when they stay in the same area but still can't interbreed, maybe due to different behaviors or genetic changes.

In the question, the pelicans were separated by migration issues, so they were probably in different locations. After 150 years apart, they can't have offspring, which means they've become different species. So this must be an example of allopatric speciation.

Looking at the options, J is allopatric speciation. But wait, let me think again. What about the other options? 

Gene flow (A) is the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another, which isn't what happened here because they were separated. Temporal isolation (B) is when species can't mate because of different timing, like different breeding seasons. That's not the case here.

Disruptive selection (C) is when extreme traits are favored, leading to diversity within a population. But this isn't about selection; it's about isolation leading to inability to mate. Founder effect (D) is when a small group starts a new population, leading to loss of genetic variation. Not exactly the situation here since it's about separation over time.

Genetic drift (E) is random changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations. Again, not directly about isolation leading to new species. Sexual selection (F) is about mate choice driving evolution, but that's not what's causing the issue here.

Sympatric speciation (G) would be if they were in the same area but couldn't interbreed. But in this case, they were separated, so G doesn't fit. Habitat fragmentation (H) is when a habitat breaks into smaller pieces, leading to isolated populations. That's a cause of speciation, but the question is about the result, not the cause.

Bottleneck effect (I) is when a population's size drastically reduces, leading to loss of genetic diversity. Not the same as being unable to produce offspring after separation.

So the correct answer must be J: allopatric speciation.

The question describes a scenario where a group of pelicans from the same species becomes separated due to an unsuccessful migration. After 150 years apart, they reunite but are unable to produce offspring, indicating that they have evolved into distinct species. This process occurs when populations are geographically isolated and evolve independently, which is known as allopatric speciation.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Gene flow** refers to the transfer of genetic material between populations, which is not relevant here since the populations were isolated.
- **B: Temporal isolation** involves differences in breeding timing, which is not the case here.
- **C: Disruptive selection** refers to selection for extreme traits, which is unrelated to the scenario.
- **D: Founder effect** involves genetic changes in a new population, but this is not the focus of the question.
- **E: Genetic drift** refers to random changes in allele frequencies, which is not the primary mechanism here.
- **F: Sexual selection** involves mate choice, which is not relevant to the inability to produce offspring.
- **G: Sympatric speciation** occurs in the same geographic area, which does not apply since the pelicans were separated.
- **H: Habitat fragmentation** is a cause of isolation but does not describe the outcome of speciation.
- **I: Bottleneck effect** refers to population size reduction, which is not the focus here.
- **J: Allopatric speciation** occurs when geographically isolated populations evolve into different species, which matches the scenario.

The correct answer is **J: allopatric speciation**.
