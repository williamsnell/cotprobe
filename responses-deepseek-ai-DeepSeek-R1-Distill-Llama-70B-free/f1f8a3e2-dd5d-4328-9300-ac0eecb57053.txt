Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about Ms. Edwards' disposable income and her expenditures. Disposable income is what's left after taxes, right? So her income went up from $19,000 to $20,000. That means her income increased by $1,000. 

Her expenditures also went up, from $15,200 to $15,950. So the increase in expenditures would be the difference between these two. Let me calculate that. 15,950 minus 15,200 is $750. So she spent $750 more when her income went up by $1,000. 

The first part of the question asks for the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). I remember that MPC is the ratio of the change in consumption to the change in disposable income. So it's the amount she spent more divided by the amount her income increased. 

So here, the change in consumption is $750, and the change in income is $1,000. So MPC would be 750 / 1000. Let me do that division. 750 divided by 1000 is 0.75. So MPC is 0.75. 

Now, the second part is the marginal propensity to save (MPS). I think MPS is just 1 minus MPC because whatever isn't consumed is saved. So if MPC is 0.75, then MPS should be 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Disposable income is Y = $20,000 now, and before it was $19,000. So the change in Y (ΔY) is $1,000. Expenditures (which I think are consumption, C) went from $15,200 to $15,950, so ΔC is $750. So yes, MPC is ΔC/ΔY = 750/1000 = 0.75. 

Then MPS is the change in saving over change in income. Savings would be Y - C. Initially, saving was 19,000 - 15,200 = 3,800. Now it's 20,000 - 15,950 = 4,050. So the change in saving (ΔS) is 4,050 - 3,800 = 250. Then MPS is ΔS/ΔY = 250 / 1000 = 0.25. 

So that matches what I thought earlier. So the MPC is 0.75, and MPS is 0.25. Now I need to look at the options. 

Looking at the options, option E says MPC is 0.75 and MPS is 0.25. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, let me just double-check if I didn't make any calculation mistakes. 

Change in income: 20,000 - 19,000 = 1,000. Correct. 

Change in consumption: 15,950 -15,200 = 750. Correct. 

MPC = 750/1000 = 0.75. MPS is 250/1000 = 0.25. Yep, that's right. So option E is correct.

To determine Ms. Edwards' marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and marginal propensity to save (MPS), we analyze the changes in her disposable income and expenditures. 

1. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC):**  
   MPC is calculated as the ratio of the change in consumption (ΔC) to the change in disposable income (ΔY).  
   - Change in disposable income (ΔY) = $20,000 - $19,000 = $1,000  
   - Change in consumption (ΔC) = $15,950 - $15,200 = $750  
   - MPC = ΔC / ΔY = $750 / $1,000 = 0.75  

2. **Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS):**  
   MPS is the complement of MPC, as the portion of additional income not consumed is saved.  
   - MPS = 1 - MPC = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25  

Thus, Ms. Edwards' marginal propensity to consume is 0.75, and her marginal propensity to save is 0.25.  

The correct answer is:  
**E: Marginal propensity to consume is .75, marginal propensity to save is .25**
