Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bob's Camera Shop reducing the price of their worst-selling camera. The original price is $65, and they reduced it by 8 and 1/3 percent. I need to find out what the new selling price is. Hmm, let's see.

Alright, first, I remember that percentages can be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle this. So, 8 and 1/3 percent. Wait, 1/3 is like 0.333..., right? So 8.333... percent. That makes sense because 1/3 as a decimal is approximately 0.3333.

So, the first step is probably to find out what 8.333% of $65 is, and then subtract that from the original price to get the new price. Yeah, that sounds right because a percentage decrease means you take that percentage off the original.

Let me write this down. So, the formula would be: New Price = Original Price - (Percentage Decrease * Original Price). Or, another way to write it is New Price = Original Price * (1 - Percentage Decrease). Both should give the same result, I think.

Wait, let me make sure about the formula. Oh right, because percentage decrease is subtracted from 1. So 8.333% as a decimal is 0.08333. So 1 - 0.08333 is 0.91667. Then multiply that by the original price.

But maybe I should calculate the discount first. Let's try that approach. So, 8.333% of $65. Hmm, how do I calculate that?

So, 8.333% is the same as 8 and 1/3 percent. Which is 8.333...%. As a decimal, that's 0.08333. So, 0.08333 multiplied by 65.

Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.08333 * 65. Maybe I can break this down. 1% of 65 is 0.65. So 8% is 0.08 * 65, which is 5.2. And 0.333% is 0.003333 * 65. Let me compute that.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1/3 of 65, because 1/3 percent is the same as 0.3333%. So 1% is 0.65, so 0.333% is roughly a third of 0.65. Let me see, 0.65 divided by 3 is approximately 0.216666... So 8% is 5.2, and 0.333% is about 0.216666. Adding those together gives 5.2 + 0.216666 = 5.416666.

So the discount is $5.416666. Now, subtracting that from the original $65. 65 - 5.416666 equals... Let me compute that. 65 minus 5 is 60, 60 minus 0.416666 is 59.583333... So approximately $59.583333.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Let me check the options again. The options are A: $64.58, B: $60.08, C: $63.58, D: $57.58, E: $60.58, F: $58.58, G: $61.58, H: $59.58, I: $56.58, J: $62.58.

Oh wait, option H is $59.58. So that's very close to 59.583333, which is approximately 59.58 when rounded to the nearest cent. So H would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with fractions, it's easy to make a mistake. So another approach: 8 1/3% is the same as 25/3 percent. Because 8 is 24/3, plus 1/3 is 25/3, which is approximately 8.3333%.

So, 25/3 percent as a decimal is 25/3 divided by 100, which is 25/(3*100) = 25/300 = 1/12 ≈ 0.083333.

So the discount is (1/12) * 65 = 65/12. Let's compute 65 divided by 12. 12*5=60, so 5 with a remainder of 5. 5/12 is approximately 0.416666. So yes, 5.416666, which matches what I had before.

So subtracting that from 65 gives 59.583333, which is $59.58 when rounded to the nearest cent. So the correct answer must be H.

Alternatively, using the other formula: New Price = 65 * (1 - 25/300). Because 25/300 is 8.333...%. So 1 - 25/300 is 275/300, which simplifies to 11/12. So 65 * (11/12) is the new price.

Calculating 65 * 11 = 715, then divided by 12. Let me do that division: 715 ÷ 12. 12*59 is 708 because 12*60=720, which is 5 more than 715. So 12*59=708. 715-708=7. So 7/12 is 0.583333. So the price is 59.583333, which is $59.58. So H again.

I think I'm confident that H is correct. So the answer is H.

To determine the new selling price of the camera after an 8⅓% discount, we first convert the percentage to a decimal. 8⅓% is equivalent to 0.08333. The original price of the camera is $65.

The discount amount is calculated as:
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.08333 \times 65 = 5.41667
\]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives:
\[
\text{New Price} = 65 - 5.41667 = 59.58333
\]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the new price is $59.58. Comparing this to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**H: $59.58**

H
