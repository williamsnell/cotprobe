Question:

A watch manufacturer has an agreement with a watch wholesaler in which the wholesaler agrees to purchase all of the watches made each month by the manufacturer, within an estimated number of 1000 to 1500 watches per month. Although the agreement worked well at 1,000 watches per month, the manufacturer expanded its plant capacity and produced 2500 watches per month. The wholesaler could no longer pay for that volume of watches. The manufacturer sued the wholesaler to compel it to buy its full output each month as required by the contract. will the court likely grant the manufacturer's request?

Options:

A: Yes, a doubling of the output contract in these circumstances meets a good faith standard and is reasonable.
B: No, because the expansion is a disproportionate increase in product that exceeds contractual estimates and cannot be handled by the buyer.
C: No, because the manufacturer should have consulted with the wholesaler before increasing production.
D: Yes, because the manufacturer has the right to increase production as it sees fit.
E: Yes, because doubling the size of the output contract is not unreasonable and is only 500 more the top estimated limit.
F: No, because the wholesaler has the right to reject any amount that exceeds the estimated number.
G: Yes, because the contract does not specify a maximum production limit.
H: No, because a change of more than 10% is considered to be unreasonable and the basis for a breach of contract.
I: Yes, because the agreement states the wholesaler will purchase all watches made each month.
J: No, because the wholesaler cannot be expected to buy more than the estimated amount agreed upon.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this contract law question. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the scenario is about a watch manufacturer and a wholesaler. They have an agreement where the wholesaler agrees to buy all the watches the manufacturer makes each month. The estimated number is between 1000 to 1500 watches per month. Initially, it worked well at 1000, but then the manufacturer expanded their plant and started producing 2500 watches a month. The wholesaler couldn't handle that volume, so the manufacturer sued to force the wholesaler to buy the full output.

The question is whether the court will grant the manufacturer's request.

Hmm. I remember that contracts often include terms about good faith and sometimes have clauses about estimated quantities. But in this case, the agreement was that the wholesaler would buy all the watches made each month, with an estimate of 1000-1500. So the manufacturer went way beyond that, to 2500, which is a significant increase.

I think courts look at whether the increase is reasonable and whether it's within the spirit of the contract. Even if the contract says "all watches made," the estimate probably sets some expectations. If the manufacturer more than doubles the production, that might be seen as unfair because the wholesaler didn't agree to that higher number.

Looking at the options:

Option B says no because the expansion is a disproportionate increase beyond the estimates. That sounds plausible because 2500 is outside the 1000-1500 range, so it's way more than expected.

Option J also says no, citing that the wholesaler can't be expected to buy more than the estimated amount. But the contract says they have to buy all, but maybe the estimates are part of that. So perhaps the court would look at whether the increase was reasonable.

Option A says yes because doubling meets a good faith standard. But wait, 2500 is more than double 1000; it's 2.5 times. So maybe that's not seen as good faith.

Option I says yes because the agreement says the wholesaler will buy all watches. But that might be too strict because the estimates probably matter. Contracts often have such estimates to set expectations, and a drastic increase could be a breach of good faith.

So I think the court would likely side with the wholesaler. The manufacturer increased production beyond the estimated range, which the wholesaler didn't agree to. So option B seems correct because the increase is disproportionate.

The court is unlikely to grant the manufacturer's request because the increase in production to 2500 watches exceeds the estimated range of 1000 to 1500, making it a disproportionate increase that the wholesaler did not agree to. This likely breaches the good faith standard expected in contracts.

Answer: B
