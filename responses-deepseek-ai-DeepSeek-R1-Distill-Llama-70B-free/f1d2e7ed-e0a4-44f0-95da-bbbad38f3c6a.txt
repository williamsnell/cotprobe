Okay, so I've got this problem here about Kate and John writing GRE math practice tests. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

So, Kate takes k days to write a test alone, and John takes j days alone. But when they work in alternating 2-day shifts, the time it takes depends on who starts first. If Kate starts, it takes 10 days. If John starts, it's 10.5 days. And the question is, how long would it take them if they worked together simultaneously?

Wait, I remember that when people work together, their rates add up. So maybe I should think in terms of their rates. Let me think about their rates per day.

Kate's rate would be 1/k per day, right? Because she can finish one test in k days. Similarly, John's rate is 1/j per day.

Now, when they work in shifts, the total time depends on how much each contributes. Let's model both scenarios.

First scenario: Kate starts, and they alternate every 2 days. So the total time is 10 days. How many days does each work?

Let me see. If they switch every 2 days, in 10 days there are 5 shifts. Wait, each shift is 2 days, so 5 shifts would cover 10 days. But wait, because it starts with Kate, the breakdown is:

Kate works 2 days, then John 2 days, Kate 2, John 2, Kate 2. So Kate works 3 shifts (2 days each) and John works 2 shifts (2 days each). Because 3*2 + 2*2= 6+4=10 days.

Wait, no, 3 shifts for Kate would be 2 days each, right? So 3 shifts * 2 days = 6 days. John would have 2 shifts, 2*2=4 days. 6+4=10 days total. So Kate works 6 days, John works 4 days.

In this case, the total work done is 1 test. So the work done is Kate's contribution plus John's. So:

Kate's work: (6 days) * (1/k) = 6/k
John's work: (4 days) * (1/j) = 4/j
Total: 6/k +4/j =1.

Second scenario: John starts first, and the total time is 10.5 days. Let's see how many shifts they each have.

Each shift is 2 days. 10.5 days is 5 full shifts (5*2=10 days) plus half a day. Wait, but shifts are 2 days each. So maybe the last shift is only 0.5 days. Hmm, but that complicates things because a shift is supposed to be 2 days.

Wait, maybe the initial approach isn't correct. Let me think again. Perhaps the shifts are in 2-day blocks, regardless of the total time. So if it starts with John, the first shift is John for 2 days, then Kate for 2, John for 2, Kate for 2, John for 2, and then maybe a half shift? Wait, 10.5 days is 5 shifts of 2 days each (10 days) plus 0.5 days. Hmm, but that would mean the last half day is part of a shift. But the shifts are 2 days each. So maybe the last shift is incomplete.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach isn't the right way to model it. Perhaps I should think in terms of the number of full shifts and any partial shifts.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the total work done in each scenario.

In the first case, with Kate starting, the total time is 10 days. So in 10 days, how much does each work?

Number of shifts: 5 shifts (each 2 days). Since Kate starts, she does the first, third, fifth shifts. John does the second, fourth. So Kate does 3 shifts (3*2=6 days) and John does 2 shifts (4 days). So same as before.

So work done: (6/k)+(4/j)=1.

In the second scenario, when John starts, the total time is 10.5 days. Let's see: 10.5 is 5 shifts of 2 days each (10 days) plus 0.5 days. So the first shift is John for 2 days, then Kate 2, John 2, Kate 2, John 2 (total 10 days), but then there's an extra 0.5 days. So the next shift would be Kate, but she only works 0.5 days.

So in this scenario, John works 3 shifts (2 each) so 6 days, Kate works 2 full shifts (4 days) and 0.5 days. So 4.5 days total.

So work done: (4.5)/k + (6)/j =1.

Now we have two equations:

1) 6/k +4/j =1
2) 4.5/k +6/j =1

We can solve these two equations to find k and j.

Let me write them as:

Equation (1): 6/k +4/j =1
Equation (2): (9/2)/k +6/j =1

Let me write equation (2) as 4.5/k +6/j =1.

To solve for k and j, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2). Wait, no, maybe express variables differently.

Let me denote a=1/k and b=1/j. Then the equations become:

Equation (1): 6a +4b=1
Equation (2):4.5a +6b=1

Now we have:

6a +4b =1 → Multiply both sides by 3 to make it easier? Or perhaps use substitution.

Multiply equation (1) by 3 and equation (2) by 2 to eliminate one variable.

Equation (1) *3: 18a +12b =3
Equation (2) *2: 9a +12b =2

Now subtract equation (2)*2 from equation (1)*3:

(18a +12b) - (9a +12b) =3-2 →9a=1 → a=1/9.

So a=1/9 → 1/k=1/9 →k=9 days.

Now plug a=1/9 into equation (1):

6*(1/9) +4b =1 → 6/9 +4b=1 → 2/3 +4b=1 →4b=1/3 → b=1/(12).

So b=1/12 → 1/j=1/12 → j=12 days.

So Kate takes 9 days alone, John takes 12 days alone.

Now, when working together, their rates add up. So combined rate is a + b =1/9 +1/12.

Let me compute that: 1/9 is 4/36, 1/12 is3/36. So together, 7/36 per day. So the time taken is reciprocal of that: 36/7 days.

Looking at the options, option D is 36/7 days.

To solve the problem, we analyze the work rates of Kate and John. Let \( k \) be the time (in days) Kate takes to write a test alone, and \( j \) be the time John takes. Their work rates are \( \frac{1}{k} \) and \( \frac{1}{j} \), respectively.

### Scenario 1: Kate starts, total time = 10 days
- Kate works 3 shifts of 2 days each, contributing \( \frac{6}{k} \) to the work.
- John works 2 shifts of 2 days each, contributing \( \frac{4}{j} \) to the work.
- Total work done: \( \frac{6}{k} + \frac{4}{j} = 1 \).

### Scenario 2: John starts, total time = 10.5 days
- John works 3 shifts of 2 days each, contributing \( \frac{6}{j} \) to the work.
- Kate works 2 full shifts of 2 days each and one partial shift of 0.5 days, contributing \( \frac{4.5}{k} \) to the work.
- Total work done: \( \frac{4.5}{k} + \frac{6}{j} = 1 \).

### Solving the equations
Let \( a = \frac{1}{k} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{j} \). The equations become:
1. \( 6a + 4b = 1 \)
2. \( 4.5a + 6b = 1 \)

To solve, multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 2:
1. \( 18a + 12b = 3 \)
2. \( 9a + 12b = 2 \)

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
9a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{9}
\]
Substitute \( a = \frac{1}{9} \) into the first equation:
\[
6 \cdot \frac{1}{9} + 4b = 1 \implies \frac{2}{3} + 4b = 1 \implies 4b = \frac{1}{3} \implies b = \frac{1}{12}
\]

Thus, \( k = 9 \) days and \( j = 12 \) days.

### Combined work rate
When working together, their combined rate is:
\[
a + b = \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{4}{36} + \frac{3}{36} = \frac{7}{36}
\]
The time to complete one test together is the reciprocal of the combined rate:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{1}{\frac{7}{36}} = \frac{36}{7} \, \text{days}
\]

### Final Answer
The correct option is **D: 36/7 days**.
