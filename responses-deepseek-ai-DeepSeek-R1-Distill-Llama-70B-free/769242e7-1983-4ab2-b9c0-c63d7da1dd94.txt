Okay, so I have this question in front of me about individual differences in vocal language development. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that there are various factors that influence how well and how quickly a child develops their language skills. The question is asking which option is NOT a contributor.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The quality of nonparental early care and education experiences. I think this does matter. Like, if a child is in a daycare where the caregivers are engaging and talk a lot, that probably helps their language development. So A is a contributor, so it's not the answer.

Option B: Hearing loss. Oh yeah, that makes sense. If a child can't hear well, they can't pick up sounds and words as easily. So hearing loss definitely affects language development. So B contributes, not the answer.

Option C: Variation in the support for language acquisition in the social environment. Social environment, like how much people talk to the child, read, etc. This is a big factor. So C contributes, not the answer.

Option D: The particular native language in a child’s environment. Well, different languages have different structures and sounds, so that would influence how a child learns to speak. So D is a contributor, not the answer.

Option E: The child's grade level in school. Wait, grade level... Hmm. I'm thinking, when do kids start developing vocal language? It starts way before school, like in infancy and toddler years. So grade level is more about their academic progress rather than the initial language development. Or maybe if they're in higher grades, they have more advanced language, but the question is about individual differences in the development. So maybe grade level isn't a direct contributor because it's more about the educational stage rather than the underlying factors that influence language acquisition.

Option F: The child's age. Age definitely affects it. Younger children are in the rapid language acquisition phase. If a child is older, say starting to learn later, that might influence their skills. So F is a contributor, not the answer.

Wait, but the question is about which is NOT a contributor. So the answer would be E, because grade level is more about the education system's structure rather than individual differences in language development. Like, two kids in the same grade might have different language skills based on other factors, but their grade level itself isn't causing the difference. It's more of a reflection of their age and education, not a direct cause.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could grade level affect language skills because of the curriculum? But I think that's more about educational content rather than the inherent development. So the primary contributors are things like hearing, environment, social support, native language, and age. Grade level isn't a direct cause; it's more of a setting where language might be further developed, but it's not an individual difference factor itself.

So I think the answer is E.

The question asks which option is NOT a contributor to individual differences in the development of vocal language skills. 

- **Option A**: Quality of nonparental care contributes because engaging caregivers can enhance language development. 
- **Option B**: Hearing loss directly impacts language acquisition as it affects sound perception. 
- **Option C**: Social environment support is crucial for language development. 
- **Option D**: The native language's structure influences learning. 
- **Option E**: Grade level is more about educational progression and not a direct factor in individual differences in language development. 
- **Option F**: Age affects language development stages. 

Grade level (E) is not a direct contributor to individual differences in vocal language skills, as it reflects educational structure rather than inherent developmental factors.

Answer: E
