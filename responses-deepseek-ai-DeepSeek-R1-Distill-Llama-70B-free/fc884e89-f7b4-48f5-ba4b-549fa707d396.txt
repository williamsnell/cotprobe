Okay, so I have this question about Anscombe and moral obligation. Hmm, I remember that Anscombe was a philosopher, right? I think she wrote something about ethics. The question is asking where the notion of moral obligation comes from according to her.

Wait, I recall that Anscombe was critical of certain approaches to ethics, especially those that she thought were not grounded properly. Oh right, she wrote an essay called "Modern Moral Philosophy." In that, she talked about how moral terms like 'obligation' were based on a law conception of ethics. 

So, she argued that without a divine lawgiver, the concept of moral obligation doesn't make much sense. Because if you think about it, when people talk about being morally obligated, it's like they're obeying a set of laws. And laws usually come from a lawgiver. 

In the past, moral systems were often tied to religion, like divine command theory. But when people stopped believing in a divine being, the basis for moral obligation started to erode. That's why she was critical of the moral philosophy of her time because it was using concepts that didn't have a solid foundation anymore.

So, putting it all together, Anscombe must have said that moral obligation is derived from divine law. Looking at the options, option H is divine law. 

Wait, but could it be natural law instead? I mean, natural law is another concept, but isn't that more like something inherent without necessarily a divine source? Or is it tied to a divine being? I'm a bit confused. 

Let me think again. Anscombe's point was that without a divine lawgiver, the idea of moral obligation as a law doesn't hold. So she's linking moral obligation to divine law. So the answer should be H, divine law.

Anscombe argues that the concept of moral obligation is grounded in the idea of divine law. She emphasizes that moral obligations are akin to laws, which typically require a lawgiver. In her critique of modern moral philosophy, she suggests that without a divine source, the notion of moral obligation lacks a coherent foundation. Therefore, the correct answer is divine law.

Answer: H
