Question:

One month before finals, Conrad makes a study schedule and begins to review his notes. Two weeks before finals, Conrad is studying for hours each day to prepare. Right after finals at the start of summer vacation, Conrad comes down with the flu. Which of the following theories best explains this chain of events?

Options:

A: Erikson's stages of psychosocial development
B: Thorndike's law of effect
C: Selye's general adaptation syndrome
D: Yerkes-Dodson law
E: Bandura's social learning theory
F: Freud's psychosexual stages of development
G: Pavlov's classical conditioning
H: Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory
I: Maslow's hierarchy of needs
J: Piaget's stages of cognitive development

Okay, so I have this question here about Conrad and his study schedule leading up to finals, and then he gets the flu right after. I need to figure out which psychological theory explains this situation best. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that Conrad starts preparing a month before finals. He reviews his notes and then two weeks before, he's studying for hours each day. Then, right after finals, he gets the flu. So, the chain of events is intense studying leading to getting sick right after.

Hmm, which theory relates stress or prolonged effort to health issues? I remember there's something about stress response and the body's adaptation. Oh wait, Selye's general adaptation syndrome comes to mind. I think that's about the body's response to stress in three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.

So, let me break it down. When Conrad starts studying a month before, that's the initial stress trigger. The alarm phase is the first reaction where the body's fight-or-flight response kicks in. Then, as he continues studying for two weeks, his body is in the resistance stage, where it's coping with the stress, but the stress is chronic. After finals, when the immediate stressor is gone, his body might be in the exhaustion phase, where his immune system is depleted, making him susceptible to illness like the flu.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the theories. There's also the Yerkes-Dodson law about optimal arousal levels for performance. That's more about how stress can affect performance, with too much stress leading to decreased performance. But that doesn't directly explain getting sick afterward.

Bandura's social learning theory is about learning through observation, so that doesn't fit here. Erikson's stages are about psychosocial development across the lifespanâ€”again, not relevant to this situation.

Freud's psychosexual stages are about development and unconscious motivations, which doesn't tie into getting sick after stress. Pavlov's classical conditioning is about associative learning, so that's not it either.

Maslow's hierarchy is about human needs and motivation, not directly about stress response. Festinger's cognitive dissonance is about conflicting thoughts leading to discomfort, which isn't the case here.

Piaget's cognitive development stages are about how children think at different ages, so that doesn't apply either.

So, putting it all together, the best fit seems to be Selye's general adaptation syndrome because it explains the body's response to prolonged stress, leading to a weakened immune system and illness after the stress period ends.

The scenario describes Conrad experiencing prolonged stress from intense studying, followed by illness after the stressor (finals) ended. This aligns with Selye's general adaptation syndrome, which outlines three stages of stress response: alarm (initial reaction), resistance (coping with stress), and exhaustion (depletion of resources, leading to susceptibility to illness). The other theories do not directly explain the link between prolonged stress and subsequent illness.
