Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cast-iron pulley rotating on a motor shaft. The problem states that it's rotating at 250 rpm and delivering 50 horsepower. I need to calculate the pulley's diameter. The given data includes the density of cast-iron as 0.05 lb per cubic inch and a tensile stress of 150 lbs per square inch. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that power is related to torque and angular velocity. The formula that comes to mind is Power = Torque × Angular Velocity. But wait, I think the units need to be consistent here. Power is in horsepower, torque would be in foot-pounds or inch-pounds, and angular velocity is in rpm, which needs to be converted to radians per second or per minute.

Wait, let me think. The standard formula in the English system is horsepower (hp) equals torque (in ft-lb) multiplied by angular velocity (in revolutions per minute), divided by some constant. Or maybe it's better to convert everything into consistent units. Alternatively, I think the formula is:

Power (hp) = (Torque (in lb·ft) × Speed (rpm)) / 5252

Because I remember that 1 hp is approximately 5252 lb·ft per minute. So if I rearrange that, Torque would be (Power × 5252) / Speed.

So let's compute that. The power is 50 hp, so Torque = (50 × 5252) / 250 rpm. Let me calculate that: 50 * 5252 is 262,600. Divided by 250 gives me 1,050.6 lb·ft. Wait, but that's torque in lb-ft. I might need it in lb-in because the stress is given in psi (lbs per square inch). So there are 12 inches in a foot, so 1 lb-ft is 12 lb-in. So 1,050.6 lb-ft equals 12,607.2 lb-in. Wait, no, wait: 1,050.6 ft-lb × 12 in/ft = 12,607.2 in-lbs. That's the torque.

But wait, torque is also related to the rotational stress in the shaft. Oh wait, no, the pulley isn't a shaft, it's a pulley. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Wait, the pulley is attached to the shaft, so maybe I'm supposed to think about the stress in the pulley's rim or something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the rotational stress causing the pulley's material to have a certain strength.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to consider the strength of the material and the torque it can handle. Since the pulley is made of cast iron, which has a given tensile stress, we can relate that to the torque.

Wait, torque in a rotating shaft causes a shearing stress. The formula for shearing stress in a shaft is τ = (T × r) / J, where τ is shear stress, T is torque, r is radius, and J is the polar moment of inertia. But wait, the pulley is a disk, not a shaft. Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the centrifugal stress in the pulley. Because when a pulley rotates, the material on the edge is under tension due to the rotation. The formula for hoop stress in a rotating ring is σ = ρ * ω² * r², where σ is the stress, ρ is the density, ω is the angular velocity in radians per second, and r is the radius.

Wait, that might make sense. Because the pulley is spinning, the outer edge experiences a tensile stress due to the centrifugal force. So the maximum stress in the pulley's material would be at the outer edge, given by σ = ρ * ω² * r².

But wait, the problem gives the tensile stress as 150 psi. So maybe that's the maximum allowable stress, so we can set σ to 150 psi and solve for r.

So the equation would be:

σ = ρ * ω² * r²

We can rearrange to solve for r:

r = sqrt(σ / (ρ * ω²))

But wait, let me make sure I get the units right. The density is given in lb per cubic inch, and stress is psi (lb per square inch). Angular velocity needs to be in radians per second because standard unit for ω is rad/s.

Wait, so let's start by converting the rotational speed from rpm to rad/s.

The pulley is rotating at 250 rpm. There are 2π radians in one revolution, and 60 seconds in a minute.

So ω = (250 rev/min) × (2π rad/rev) × (1 min/60 sec) ) = (250 * 2π) / 60 rad/s.

Let me compute that: 250 * 2 = 500, 500 * π ≈ 500 * 3.1416 ≈ 1570.8. Divide by 60: 1570.8 /60 ≈ 26.18 rad/s.

So ω is approximately 26.18 rad/s.

Now, plug into the equation:

σ = 150 psi = 0.05 lb/in³ * (26.18 rad/s)^2 * r^2.

Wait, wait, let me compute the right side step by step.

First, compute ω squared: (26.18)^2 ≈ 686 (since 26^2 is 676, 26.18^2 is about 686).

Then, the equation becomes:

150 = 0.05 * 686 * r²

Compute 0.05 * 686: 0.05 * 686 is 34.3.

So 150 = 34.3 * r².

Solve for r²: r² = 150 / 34.3 ≈ 4.376.

So r ≈ sqrt(4.376) ≈ 2.092 inches.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the diameter about 4.18 inches, which isn't one of the options. So I must have messed something up.

Wait, maybe I've got the wrong formula. Let me think again. The formula for the hoop stress in a rotating ring is indeed σ = ρ * ω² * r². But wait, isn't that for a thin ring? And perhaps the units require some conversion because the density is in lb per cubic inch, and stress is in lb per square inch.

Wait, maybe the formula uses mass per unit volume, which is density, but does that include gravitational factors? Hmm, because in the English system, sometimes you have to account for the conversion between mass and weight, which involves g (32.2 ft/s² or something). Oh wait, but in the formula, when you have ρ in slugs per cubic foot, but here we have lb per cubic inch. Hmm, maybe I should convert the units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check. The formula for centrifugal stress (hoop stress) in a rotating thin ring is σ = ρ * (ω r)^2, where ρ is the density in mass per unit volume, and ω is in radians per second.

Wait, but in the English system, if I have ρ in lb per cubic inch, that's actually weight density (since weight is mass times g). Oh wait, no, in the English system, lb is a unit of force, so lb per cubic inch would be force per volume, which would be like weight density, but that's not correct. Because density should be mass per volume, but in the English system, sometimes people use pounds as both force and mass, which can get confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to convert the density from lb/in³ to slug/in³ because in the English system, mass is in slugs. Let's think. The given density is 0.05 lb per cubic inch. But since 1 slug is 32.174 lb·s²/ft, I need to convert lb to slugs.

Wait, 1 lb mass is 1 slug divided by (32.174 lb·s²/ft per slug), but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that the units in the formula are consistent. Let me try to get all units in the English system.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the formula in terms of weight density. Because in the English system, weight (force) is in lb, mass is in slugs, and weight density is lb per cubic inch.

Wait, the formula for centrifugal stress is σ = (weight density) * (angular velocity in rad/s)^2 * r^2. But wait, that doesn't seem right because weight density is force per volume, which is different from mass density (mass per volume). So perhaps the formula should involve mass density, but in the English system, we have to adjust with g.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is σ = (mass density) * (angular velocity)^2 * r^2. But then, how do I get mass density from the given weight density?

The given density is 0.05 lb per cubic inch. Since 1 lb is weight, and 1 slug is mass = weight/g, so mass density (slug per cubic inch) would be weight density (lb per cubic inch) divided by g (in lb slug⁻¹ ft s⁻²). Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think again.

The relationship between mass and weight is: weight (W) = mass (m) × g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (32.174 ft/s²). So, if we have weight density (ρ_weight) = W/V = m*g / V = mass density (ρ_mass) * g.

So, ρ_mass = ρ_weight / g.

Given that ρ_weight is 0.05 lb/in³, and g is 32.174 ft/s². But here's the problem: units. Because 0.05 lb/in³ is a weight density in lb per cubic inch, and g is in ft/s². To get ρ_mass in slugs per cubic inch, we need to convert the units.

Wait, 1 slug is 1 lb·s²/ft. So to convert from lb/in³ to slug/in³, we can do:

ρ_mass (slug/in³) = ρ_weight (lb/in³) / (g (ft/s²)) * (ft³/lb·s²)) )

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me try dimensional analysis.

We have ρ_weight = 0.05 lb/in³.

We want ρ_mass in slugs/in³.

We know that 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft. So 1 slug/ft³ = 1 lb·s²/(ft·ft³) )= 1 lb·s²/ft^4, which doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the conversion factor between lb/in³ and slug/in³.

Since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, but perhaps it's easier to convert lb/in³ to slug/ft³ first, then to slug/in³.

Wait, 1 ft = 12 inches, so 1 ft³ = (12 in)^3 = 1728 in³.

So, 1 lb/ft³ = 1 lb / 1728 in³ → 1 lb/ft³ = 1/(1728) lb/in³.

So, 1 lb/in³ = 1728 lb/ft³.

Now, 1 slug/ft³ = 1 slug per cubic foot.

Given that weight density is mass times g, so ρ_weight = ρ_mass × g.

So, ρ_mass = ρ_weight / g.

So, if ρ_weight is in lb/ft³, then ρ_mass in slug/ft³ would be (lb/ft³) / (ft/s²) ) → (lb/(ft³)) / (ft/s²) ) → lb/(ft^4 · s²). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

ρ_mass (slug/ft³) = ρ_weight (lb/ft³) / g (ft/s²)

Because weight density is mass density × g.

So, if ρ_weight is in lb/ft³ and g is in ft/s², then ρ_mass would be (lb/ft³) / (ft/s²) ) = (lb·s²) / (ft^4). But that doesn't resolve to slug/ft³.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I should just stick with the metric system formula and adjust the units accordingly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express everything in consistent units. Let's try to convert the density from lb/in³ to slug/in³.

The given ρ is 0.05 lb/in³. Since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, but how does that convert to lb/in³?

Wait, 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft, so 1 slug/ft³ = 1 lb/(ft²·s²). Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute the density in slugs per cubic inch.

Wait, 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So 1 lb = 1/32.174 slug·ft/s².

So, 0.05 lb/in³ = 0.05 * (1/32.174) slug·ft/(s²·in³).

But ft is 12 inches, so ft³ is (12 in)^3 = 1728 in³.

So, 1 ft = 12 in, so 1 ft³ = 1728 in³. Therefore, 1 lb/ft³ = 1 lb / 1728 in³.

But in our case, we have lb/in³, so 0.05 lb/in³ = 0.05 * 1728 lb/ft³ = 86.4 lb/ft³.

Now, since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, then 1 slug/ft³ = (32.174 lb·s²/ft) / ft³ = 32.174 lb/(ft²·s²).

Wait, perhaps to find ρ_mass in slug/ft³, we can take ρ_weight in lb/ft³ and divide by g in ft/s².

So, ρ_mass = ρ_weight / g.

Given that ρ_weight is 86.4 lb/ft³ and g is 32.174 ft/s²,

ρ_mass = 86.4 / 32.174 ≈ 2.684 slug/ft³.

Wait, that seems right. So now, the mass density is approximately 2.684 slugs per cubic foot.

Now, the formula for centrifugal stress is σ = ρ_mass * ω² * r².

Wait, but wait, in the formula, the units: ρ_mass is in slug/ft³, ω is in rad/s, and r is in feet.

So, let's convert everything to these units.

We have:

σ = 150 psi → which is 150 lb/in².

But since we're working in ft units, let's convert psi to lb/ft².

Wait, 1 ft = 12 in, so 1 ft² = 144 in². Therefore, 1 lb/in² = 144 lb/ft².

So, 150 psi = 150 lb/in² = 150 * 144 lb/ft² = 21,600 lb/ft².

Now, the formula is σ = ρ_mass * ω² * r².

We have σ in lb/ft², ρ_mass in slug/ft³, ω in rad/s, and r in ft.

So, let's plug in the numbers.

We have:

21,600 lb/ft² = (2.684 slug/ft³) * (ω rad/s)^2 * (r ft)^2.

Wait, but we have to compute ω in rad/s correctly. Earlier, we calculated ω as approximately 26.18 rad/s, but let me verify.

250 rpm → 250 rev/min → 250 * 2π rad/min → convert to rad/s: 250 * 2π / 60 → (500π)/60 ≈ 26.18 rad/s. So that's correct.

So, substituting:

21,600 = 2.684 * (26.18)^2 * r².

Compute (26.18)^2: approx 686 as before.

So, 21,600 = 2.684 * 686 * r².

Compute 2.684 * 686:

2.684 * 600 = 1,610.4

2.684 * 86 = approx 231.0 (since 2.684 * 80=215.12, 2.684*6=16.10 → 215.12+16.10=231.22)

So total ≈ 1,610.4 + 231.22 ≈ 1,841.62.

So, 21,600 = 1,841.62 * r².

r² = 21,600 / 1,841.62 ≈ 11.737 ft².

So, r ≈ sqrt(11.737) ≈ 3.426 ft.

Wait, 3.426 ft is about 41.11 inches. So diameter would be about 82.22 inches.

Wait, let me check that calculation again because 3.426 ft is 41.11 inches, so diameter is 82.22 inches. Looking at the options, option C is 82.2 in, which matches.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I converted 0.05 lb/in³ to lb/ft³: 0.05 lb/in³ * (12 in/ft)^3 = 0.05 * 1728 lb/ft³ → 86.4 lb/ft³. Correct.

Then, ρ_mass = 86.4 lb/ft³ / 32.174 ft/s² → 86.4 /32.174 ≈ 2.684 slugs/ft³. Correct.

Then, σ in lb/ft²: 150 psi → 150 * 144 = 21,600 lb/ft².

Then, 21,600 = 2.684 * (26.18)^2 * r².

(26.18)^2 = 686 → 2.684 * 686 ≈ 1,841.6.

r² = 21,600 / 1,841.6 ≈ 11.737 → r ≈ 3.426 ft → 3.426 *12 = 41.11 inches. So diameter is 82.22 inches, which is option C.

But wait, the options include option C as 82.2 in, which matches. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but earlier when I tried without unit conversion, I got a diameter
