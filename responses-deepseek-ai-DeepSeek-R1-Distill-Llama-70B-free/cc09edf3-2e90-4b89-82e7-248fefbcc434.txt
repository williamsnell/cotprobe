Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a simple telescope. Hmm, telescopes, right. I remember that telescopes use lenses to magnify objects. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The problem gives me some parameters: the focal length of the objective (F) is 24 cm, and the eyepiece (f) is 4 cm. The aperture of the objective is 2 cm, and the eyepiece's aperture is 1 cm. There are three parts to the question: (a) where to place the eye for the greatest extent, (b) the diameter of the eye ring, and (c) the angular size of the largest object seen, done in two ways.

Starting with part (a). I think this is about the position where the eye should be placed. Oh wait, for a telescope, the image formed by the objective is the object for the eyepiece. When the object is distant, the image formed by the objective is at its focal point. So the eyepiece acts as a magnifying glass to view this image.

So the distance between the two lenses should be the sum of their focal lengths. Wait, wait. No, wait. The objective forms a real image at F, which is 24 cm. Then the eyepiece, which is a converging lens too, takes that image and forms a virtual image. The eyepiece's focal length is 4 cm, so the eyepiece should be placed so that the image from the objective is within its focal length. Oh, right, because when the image is inside the eyepiece's focal length, it produces a virtual image at infinity. But wait, for maximum viewing, maybe when the image is at the near point or something? Or perhaps when the eye is placed at the eyepiece's focal length.

Wait, maybe the eye is placed at the focal point of the eyepiece. Because the eyepiece forms a virtual image at infinity when its object is at f. So the eyepiece's object distance u should be equal to f. So the total length of the telescope is F + f = 24 +4=28 cm. So the two lenses are 28 cm apart. But the question is where the eye must be placed. Oh, I think it's the position relative to the eyepiece. Since the image is formed at the focal point of the eyepiece, the eye must be placed at the focal point. Wait, no... the image is at the focal point, but the eye can't focus on that. Or wait, no, the eyepiece forms a virtual image at infinity when the object is placed at its focal point. So, when the image from the objective is at the eyepiece's focal point, the eyepiece will create a virtual image at infinity, which allows the eye to see it without accommodation.

But the eye can only see it clearly if the image is at infinity, which happens when the image is at the eyepiece's focal point. So the eyepiece's object is at its focal point, so the eye lens is placed such that the eye is at the focal point of the eyepiece. So the distance from the eyepiece to the eye is its focal length, which is 4 cm. Wait, but then the eyepiece is 4 cm away from the image. Or is that the case?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The objective lens has a focal length of 24 cm. So the image of a distant object is formed at F =24 cm from the objective. Then, this image becomes the object for the eyepiece. The eyepiece is placed so that this image is at its focal point. So the eyepiece's object distance is f =4 cm. Wait, no, the object distance for the eyepiece (u) is the distance from the eyepiece to the image formed by the objective. If the eyepiece is placed next to the objective, the distance between the two lenses is F + f =28 cm. So the image from the objective is at 24 cm behind the objective, which is also 4 cm in front of the eyepiece (since 28-24=4). So the eyepiece's object is at u=4 cm, which is exactly its focal length. So when u =f, the eyepiece forms an image at infinity. So the eye can be placed anywhere along the line beyond, but for maximum viewing, the eye should be at the focal point of the eyepiece. Wait, no, the image is at infinity, so the eye can see it best when the eye is relaxed, with the image at infinity. So the eye doesn't have to be placed at any specific point beyond the eyepiece except that it should be within the exit pupil.

Wait, but the question is (a) where the eye must be placed. So the image is at infinity, so the eye needs to adjust to see that. So the eye's position isn't critical because the image is at infinity. But the eye must be placed such that the exit pupil's location allows the eye's pupil to capture the light. So perhaps the eye should be at the focal point of the eyepiece. Or maybe the eye can be placed as close as possible to the eyepiece's focal point. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but maybe I can come back to part (a) after figuring out the other parts.

Part (b): the diameter of the eye ring, which I think refers to the diameter of the exit pupil. The exit pupil is the image of the objective's aperture formed by the eyepiece. So the exit pupil diameter D can be found by D = (d_objective) * (f_eyepiece) / F_objective. Wait, is that correct?

I remember that the magnification for the exit pupil is the ratio of the eyepiece focal length to the objective focal length. So M = f / F. So the exit pupil diameter is d_eye = d_objective * (f / F). Because the eyepiece is projecting an image of the objective's aperture.

So given d_objective is 2 cm, f=4 cm, F=24 cm. So D = 2 * (4/24) = 2*(1/6) = 1/3 cm. So the diameter is 1/3 cm. Wait, but let me make sure. The formula for exit pupil diameter is (aperture of objective) * (f_eyepiece) / (f_objective). So 2 *4 /24= 8/24=1/3 cm. So that's 0.333 cm.

Looking at the options, option H says (1/3) cm for part (b). So that's a clue.

Now part (c): the angular size of the largest object which can be seen. Given that the eye is treated as a point located at the eye point. So this is the maximum angular size visible, which I think relates to the maximum angle that the telescope can collect, limited by the aperture.

Wait, when the eye is at the eye point (exit pupil), the maximum angle is determined by the size of the objective and the exit pupil. Hmm, no, perhaps it's the maximum angle that the objective can collect, which depends on its aperture and the focal length.

Wait, another approach: the maximum angular size is determined by the ratio of the aperture of the eyepiece to its focal length. Or perhaps considering the angular resolution, but here it's about the size of the object's image.

Wait, perhaps the largest object is determined by the field of view. The field of view is determined by the eyepiece's aperture and the focal length of the objective. Or maybe it's the angular size when the object's image fills the exit pupil.

Alternatively, the maximum angular size θ is given by θ = aperture of eyepiece / (f_objective), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The maximum angular size occurs when the object's image just fits into the exit pupil. So the maximum angle is determined by the ratio of the exit pupil's diameter to the focal length of the eyepiece? Or perhaps the objective's focal length.

Wait, perhaps the maximum angular size can be found using the magnifying power. Wait, when using magnifying power, the angular size of the object is M times the angular size without the telescope.

Wait, the magnifying power M is given by (F + f)/f, or is it F/f? Wait, telescopes can be in different configurations. For a refracting telescope (astronomical telescope), the magnifying power is F/f. Because M = F/f.

Wait, yes, the magnification M is (f_objective)/(f_eyepiece). So M = 24/4 =6.

So the angular magnification is 6. So any object seen through the telescope will have an angular size 6 times larger than when viewed with the naked eye.

But the question is about the largest object that can be seen. So perhaps the largest object is when the image's angular size is maximum, which would relate to the field of view.

Wait, perhaps the maximum angular size is when the object's image fills the exit pupil. Alternatively, the maximum object size is when the object is at the maximum angle that the telescope can accept.

I think the maximum angular size θ is given by the ratio of the eyepiece's aperture to the objective's focal length. So θ = (d_eyepiece) / F. Since d_eyepiece is 1 cm and F is 24 cm, θ = 1/24 radians. To convert that to degrees: 1 radian is about 57.3 degrees. So θ ≈ (1/24)*57.3 ≈ 2.38 degrees. Alternatively, wait, perhaps I should think about this differently.

Wait, another approach: the maximum angular size is when the object's image fills the exit pupil. The exit pupil diameter is D =1/3 cm, as found in part (b). The exit pupil is located at the eyepiece's focal point. So the maximum angle would be D / f_eyepiece. So θ = (1/3 cm) / 4 cm = 1/12 radians. 1/12 radians is approximately 8.57 degrees. That doesn't seem to match any of the options though.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The maximum angular size of the object as seen by the eye is determined by the ratio of the objective's aperture to its focal length. Because the objective collects light and sets the limit on the maximum angle. Wait, that would be θ = d_objective / (2 F). Wait, actually, the resolution is related to that, but perhaps the maximum angular size is when the object's image fills the exit pupil.

Wait, perhaps the maximum angular size is determined by the ratio of the eyepiece's aperture to its focal length. Because the eyepiece's aperture limits the size of the exit pupil. So θ = d_eyepiece / (f_eyepiece) = 1 cm /4 cm = 0.25 radians. 0.25 radians is about 14.3 degrees. That seems too large, and none of the options match.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the field of view. The field of view (FoV) is the maximum angle that the telescope can image. It's determined by the eyepiece's aperture and the focal length of the objective.

Alternatively, using the formula: FoV (in radians) = (d_eyepiece) / (f_objective). So d_eyepiece is 1 cm, f_objective is 24 cm. So FoV =1/24 ≈0.0417 radians, which is about 2.38 degrees.

Wait, this matches roughly with what I had earlier. So part (c) when using magnifying power would involve M. Let's see, without using M, perhaps it's θ = d_eyepiece / f_objective, which is 1/24 rad ≈ 2.38 degrees. Using M, perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, if using magnifying power, M=6. So the maximum angular size would be determined by the eye's angular resolution. Wait, the eye can resolve about 1 arcminute, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe the maximum angular size is the FoV, which is θ = (d_eyepiece / f_objective) * (180/pi) degrees. So 1/24 rad is approx 2.39 degrees, which is about 2.4 degrees. Looking at the options, which one has around 2 degrees or 2.04 degrees?

Looking at the options, option H has 2.04 degrees. So perhaps part (c) is approximately 2.04 degrees.

Wait, but how do I get exactly 2.04 degrees? Let me compute 1/24 rad to degrees precisely.

1 rad = 180/pi ≈57.2958 degrees. So 1/24 rad = 57.2958 /24 ≈ 2.3873 degrees. That's about 2.39 degrees. The options don't have exactly that. Option H's part (c) is 2.04 degrees. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: The maximum angular size is when the object's image fills the exit pupil. The exit pupil diameter is D=1/3 cm, as found earlier. The exit pupil is formed by the eyepiece, so the angular size is D / f_eyepiece. So 1/3 cm divided by 4 cm gives 1/12 rad. 1/12 rad is approximately 8.57 degrees. That's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the maximum angular size occurs when the object's image fills the objective's aperture. But that would be more about resolution, not size.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum angular size is the angular diameter of the exit pupil as seen by the eye. Since the exit pupil is at the eyepiece's focal point, the angle would be D / (eye placement distance), but I'm not sure about the placement.

Wait, perhaps the maximum object size is determined by the ratio of the eyepiece's aperture to the objective's focal length. So θ = (d_eyepiece) / F. So 1 cm /24 cm = 1/24 rad ≈ 2.39 degrees. So that aligns with what I had before. So part (c) is about 2.39 degrees, which would be approximately 2.4 degrees. But none of the options exactly match that. Option H is 2.04, which is a bit lower. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the formula is (d_eyepiece) / (F + f). Because the total length is F +f= 28 cm. So θ = 1/28 rad ≈ 6.428 degrees. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the eyepiece's focal length. θ = (d_eyepiece) / f_eyepiece. 1/4 rad is 14.3 degrees. That seems too big.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think about using the magnifying power approach.

The magnifying power M is F/f =24/4=6. So any angular size is magnified by 6 times. So the maximum angular size of the object as seen by the eye would be the maximum angular size without the telescope divided by M.

Wait, but without the telescope, the maximum angular size is determined by the eye's resolving power, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the largest object that can be seen is limited by the telescope's field of view, which is FoV = (d_eyepiece) / (F). So 1/24 rad ≈ 2.39 degrees. So when viewed through the telescope, the object's angular size is M times larger than the actual size. Wait, no, the magnification makes the image larger, so the object's actual angular size θ would be θ = FoV / M. So FoV is the maximum angle as seen in the telescope. So without the telescope, the object's angular size would be FoV/M. But the question is about the largest object that can be seen when using the telescope, so perhaps it's when the object's size fills the FoV.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it this way: The field of view (FoV) is the maximum angular size that the telescope can display. So if the object is larger than FoV, you can't see it all. So the largest object you can see has an angular size equal to the FoV. So the FoV is θ = (d_eyepiece)/(F). So θ =1/24 rad ≈2.39 degrees.

But the problem says to solve part (c) using (i) magnifying power, and (ii) without using magnifying power. So perhaps for (i), using M, and for (ii), using FoV directly.

Wait, perhaps for (i), the maximum angular size is FoV, which is the same as without using M. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, let's approach part (c) without using magnifying power. The maximum angular size is when the image is formed at the exit pupil. So the maximum angle is determined by the size of the exit pupil and the focal length of the eyepiece. So θ = D / f_eyepiece. D is the exit pupil diameter, which we found to be 1/3 cm. So θ = (1/3) /4 = 1/12 rad ≈8.57 degrees. That's not matching any of the options except maybe option H, but that's 2.04 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. If I consider the diameter, perhaps the radius is what's used. So θ = (D/2)/f_eyepiece. So (1/6)/4 =1/24 rad ≈ 2.39 degrees. That matches the earlier calculation.

Ah! So that's the correct approach. The maximum angular size is when the exit pupil's radius is considered. So θ = (D_exit/2)/f_eyepiece. Because the angle is calculated from the radius. So D_exit is 1/3 cm, so radius is 1/6 cm. Divide by f_eyepiece (4 cm): (1/6)/4 =1/24 rad ≈2.39 degrees.

So that's part (c) without using magnifying power. So in the options, the closest is option H with 2.04 degrees, but 2.39 is approximately 2.4, which none of the options have. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating D_exit.

Wait, earlier I thought D_exit is 1/3 cm. Let me re-calculate that. The exit pupil diameter D_exit = (d_objective) * (f_eyepiece)/(F_objective). So d_objective=2 cm, f_eyepiece=4 cm, F_objective=24 cm.
