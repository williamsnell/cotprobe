Question:

The marketing research firm of Burrows, Heller and Larimer wants to estimate the proportions of men and women who are familiar with a shoe polish. In a sample (random) of 100 men and 200 women it is found that 20 men and 60 women had used this particular shoe polish. Compute a 95% confidence interval for the difference in pro portions between men and women familiar with the product. Use this to test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal.

Options:

A: The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference in proportions
B: The proportions are equal
C: The proportions are not equal
D: The confidence interval does not include zero, indicating a significant difference in proportions
E: The proportion of women is higher
F: The confidence interval is too wide to determine a significant difference
G: The proportion of men is higher
H: No conclusion can be drawn without further data
I: The proportion of men is significantly lower
J: The proportion of women is significantly lower

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The marketing research firm is looking to estimate the proportions of men and women familiar with a shoe polish. They took a random sample: 100 men and 200 women. The results were that 20 men and 60 women had used the product. They want a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions between men and women. Then, use this to test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal.

Hmm, so the main goal is to compute the confidence interval and then see if it includes zero, which would mean there's no significant difference. If it doesn't include zero, then the difference is statistically significant.

Okay, so first, I need to compute the sample proportions for men and women. The formula for sample proportion is the number of successes over the sample size.

For men: 20 out of 100 used the polish. So p_men = 20/100 = 0.2.

For women: 60 out of 200. So p_women = 60/200 = 0.3.

The difference in proportions, which is p_women - p_men, would be 0.3 - 0.2 = 0.1.

Now, to compute the confidence interval, I think we need to use the formula for the standard error (SE) of the difference in proportions. The formula I remember is:

SE = sqrt( (p1*(1-p1)/n1) + (p2*(1-p2)/n2) )

So plugging the numbers in:

p1 is 0.2, n1 is 100. p2 is 0.3, n2 is 200.

So SE = sqrt( (0.2*0.8/100) + (0.3*0.7/200) )

Calculating each part:

0.2*0.8 = 0.16. Divided by 100 is 0.0016.

0.3*0.7 = 0.21. Divided by 200 is 0.00105.

Adding them together: 0.0016 + 0.00105 = 0.00265.

Taking the square root of that: sqrt(0.00265) ≈ 0.0515.

So the standard error is approximately 0.0515.

Next, the critical value for a 95% confidence interval. Since this is a two-tailed test, each tail has 2.5%, so the z-score is about 1.96.

So the margin of error (ME) is z * SE = 1.96 * 0.0515 ≈ 0.101.

So the confidence interval is the difference in proportions (0.1) plus or minus the ME.

So lower limit: 0.1 - 0.101 = -0.001.

Upper limit: 0.1 + 0.101 = 0.201.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Because 1.96 * 0.0515.

Calculating 0.0515 * 2 = 0.103. Then 0.0515 * 0.96 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). Wait, maybe better to just compute 1.96 * 0.0515.

1.96 * 0.05 is 0.098, and 1.96 * 0.0015 is about 0.00294. So total is approximately 0.098 + 0.00294 = 0.10094, so about 0.101, which matches earlier.

So the confidence interval is from -0.001 to 0.201.

Wait, so that's a range that includes zero? Because the lower bound is just below zero, and the upper is positive. So the interval includes zero.

If that's the case, then the difference isn't statistically significant at the 95% level. So we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal.

Wait, but wait, the lower bound is -0.001, which is almost zero. So the interval is (-0.001, 0.201). So zero is within this range. So that would mean that we can't say the difference is statistically significant.

So the confidence interval includes zero, which means there's no significant difference.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the interval includes zero, so no difference.

Option D says the interval doesn't include zero, so significant difference.

So based on this, the correct answer should be A.

But wait, let me think again. The difference is 0.1, and the confidence interval is roughly from -0.001 to 0.201. So zero is included.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify.

Another approach: using the formula for the standard error when comparing two proportions. The formula is correct, right? Yes.

p1=0.2, so p1*(1-p1)/n1 = 0.16/100=0.0016.

p2=0.3, so p2*(1-p2)/n2 = 0.21/200=0.00105.

Sum is 0.00265, sqrt is about 0.0515.

Z-score is 1.96 for 95% CI.

So 1.96 * 0.0515 = 0.10094, so ME is ~0.101.

So the CI is 0.1 ± 0.101, which gives (0.1 - 0.101)= -0.001 and (0.1 +0.101)=0.201.

So yes, zero is within the interval, so A is correct.

Wait, but what about the alternative method using a pooled proportion? Does that change anything? Wait, the method I used assumes independent samples, which they are. So that's correct.

Alternatively, when the sample sizes are large enough and the proportions aren't extreme, using the standard formula is appropriate.

So the conclusion is that the confidence interval includes zero, so no significant difference. Therefore, the answer is A.

To estimate the proportions of men and women familiar with the shoe polish and test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal, we compute a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions.

### Step 1: Calculate Sample Proportions
- For men: \( p_{\text{men}} = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \)
- For women: \( p_{\text{women}} = \frac{60}{200} = 0.3 \)
- Difference in proportions: \( p_{\text{women}} - p_{\text{men}} = 0.3 - 0.2 = 0.1 \)

### Step 2: Compute Standard Error (SE)
The formula for SE is:
\[
SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.2(1-0.2)}{100} + \frac{0.3(1-0.3)}{200}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.16}{100} + \frac{0.21}{200}} = \sqrt{0.0016 + 0.00105} = \sqrt{0.00265} \approx 0.0515
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Margin of Error (ME)
The z-score for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96. Thus:
\[
ME = z \cdot SE = 1.96 \cdot 0.0515 \approx 0.101
\]

### Step 4: Construct the Confidence Interval
The confidence interval for the difference in proportions is:
\[
\text{Lower limit} = 0.1 - 0.101 = -0.001
\]
\[
\text{Upper limit} = 0.1 + 0.101 = 0.201
\]
Thus, the 95% confidence interval is approximately \((-0.001, 0.201)\).

### Step 5: Interpret the Results
The confidence interval includes zero (\(-0.001\) to \(0.201\)), indicating that the difference in proportions between men and women is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal.

### Evaluation of Options
- **A**: Correct. The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no significant difference in proportions.
- **B**: Incorrect. The confidence interval including zero does not confirm that the proportions are equal, only that the difference is not statistically significant.
- **C**: Incorrect. The confidence interval includes zero, so the proportions are not significantly different.
- **D**: Incorrect. The confidence interval includes zero, so there is no significant difference.
- **E**: Incorrect. The confidence interval includes zero, so no significant difference is detected.
- **F**: Incorrect. The confidence interval is not too wide; it clearly includes zero.
- **G**: Incorrect. The confidence interval includes zero, so no significant difference is detected.
- **H**: Incorrect. A conclusion can be drawn: the difference is not statistically significant.
- **I**: Incorrect. The confidence interval includes zero, so no significant difference is detected.
- **J**: Incorrect. The confidence interval includes zero, so no significant difference is detected.

### Final Answer
The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no significant difference in proportions.
