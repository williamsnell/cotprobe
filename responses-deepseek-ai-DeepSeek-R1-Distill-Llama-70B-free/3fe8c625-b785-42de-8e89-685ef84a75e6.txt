Okay, so I've got this problem about an induction motor, and I need to figure out the answers for four different parts: horsepower output, torque, percent efficiency, and power factor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on induction motor calculations, but let's take it step by step.

First, the given data. The motor is a 5-hp, 60-cycle, 115-volt, eight-pole, three-phase induction motor. They've done no-load and load tests.

No-load test data:
- Voltage (V_NL) = 115 V
- Power input (P1) = 725 W
- Power output (P2) = -425 W (Wait, that's negative. Oh right, at no load, the output power is zero because there's no load, so maybe P2 here represents the losses or something else.)
- Current (I_NL) = 10 A

Load test data:
- Voltage (V_L) = 115 V
- Power input (P1) = 3140 W
- Power output (P2) = 1570 W
- Current (I_L) = 27.3 A
- Rotor speed (rpm_rotor) = 810 rpm

Additional data: D-c stator resistance between terminals is 0.128 ohms.

Wait, I think for the no-load test, the power input is the no-load power, which includes core losses (iron losses) and some other losses. The no-load current is the magnetizing current. The load test gives the input power and output power under load.

Let me start by tackling part (a), the horsepower output. Horsepower output is usually the mechanical power output. In the load test, P2 is 1570 W, which I think is the output power. So that's the mechanical power. But wait, the problem says it's a 5-hp motor, but under load, the output is 1570 W. Let me convert that to horsepower.

Wait, 1 horsepower is 746 watts. So 1570 W divided by 746 gives about 2.1 hp. But that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding what P2 is. Wait, maybe P2 is the rotor input power. Or perhaps there's another factor.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The load test gives the power input as 3140 W. The power output is 1570 W. So the mechanical output would be 1570 W, right? Because that's the power delivered to the load. So 1570 W is the output. 1570 /746 is approximately 2.1 hp? But the options are higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe P2 is the power developed in the rotor, not the output. Because in induction motors, the output is the rotor's mechanical power. So the rotor's mechanical power is P2. 

Wait, but wait. The power input to the motor is 3140 W. The power output P2 is 1570 W. But wait, that would mean the efficiency is 1570 / 3140, which is about 0.5, which seems too low. So perhaps P2 isn't the mechanical output. Maybe I'm getting confused between the different powers here.

Wait, in the no-load test, P1 is the input power (stator input), which is 725 W, and P2 is negative 425 W. Hmm, perhaps P2 is the power factor? Or maybe it's the reactive power. Wait, no, the units are in watts, so it's real power. Negative real power would indicate power flowing out, but that doesn't make sense at no load. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the data represents the stator input (P1) and the rotor input (P2). So for no-load, P1 is 725 W into the stator, and P2 is the rotor power, which would be lower because of losses. But I'm not too sure.

Wait, perhaps the no-load test is used to find the core losses and the stator losses. So the no-load input power is equal to the stator iron losses plus the stator copper losses at no load. But at no load, the current is the magnetizing current, which is lower than the full load current.

So, for the no-load test:

Stator input power (P1) = 725 W = stator copper losses (I² R) + core losses.

Stator current I_NL is 10 A. The stator resistance is given as 0.128 ohms. So stator copper losses are 3 phases, so I² R multiplied by 3.

Wait, for a three-phase motor, the line current is measured. So the total copper loss is 3 * (I_ph)^2 * R. But the line current I is related to the phase current I_ph by I = I_ph * sqrt(3) for a star connection, or I_ph = I for a delta connection. Hmm, but the motor is three-phase, but the connection isn't specified. I think for the purpose of calculating losses, we can consider that the stator resistance is given per phase.

Wait, the stator resistance is given as 0.128 ohms between terminals. So for a three-phase motor, each phase's resistance would be 0.128 ohms if it's delta connected. Because in a delta connection, each phase has the full line voltage. Alternatively, if it's star-connected, each phase's resistance would be different. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the total resistance per phase.

Wait, no. The DC resistance between terminals: for a delta-connected stator, each phase resistance is R. For a star-connected, each phase resistance would be R as well, but the line voltage is higher. Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with what I have.

So for the no-load test:

Stator copper loss (P_copper_NL) = 3 * (I_NL)^2 * R_per_phase.

Wait, but the stator resistance given is 0.128 ohms between terminals. So if the motor is delta-connected, each phase's resistance is 0.128 ohms. If it's star-connected, each phase's resistance would be 0.128 ohms? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given stator resistance is the total for all three phases. No, usually, when you measure DC resistance between two terminals, you're measuring the resistance of one phase. Because in a three-phase motor, each phase is connected, and the DC resistance between any two terminals is the resistance of one phase.

Wait, no. For a delta-connected motor, the DC resistance between any two terminals is the resistance of one phase. For a star-connected motor, it's the same as one phase's resistance. So in either case, the DC resistance between two terminals is R_per_phase.

So for the no-load test:

Stator copper loss (P_copper_NL) = 3 * (I_NL)^2 * R_per_phase.

Wait, no. Wait, I_NL is the line current. For a three-phase motor, each phase current is the same as the line current (for delta), or line current is sqrt(3) times phase current (for star). But for power calculations, the total copper loss is 3 * (I_phase)^2 * R_phase.

So if I_NL is the line current, which is 10 A, then in a delta connection, phase current is the same as line current, so I_phase = 10 A. So copper loss is 3 * (10)^2 * 0.128.

Calculating that: 3 * 100 * 0.128 = 38.4 W.

So P_copper_NL = 38.4 W.

Then, the stator input power at no load is P1 = 725 W, which equals the sum of copper losses and core losses (P_core).

So 725 = 38.4 + P_core => P_core = 725 - 38.4 = 686.6 W.

So core losses are 686.6 W.

Now, moving to the load test. The input power is 3140 W. The output power is 1570 W. So the efficiency would be output / input, which is 1570 / 3140 ≈ 0.5, but that's way too low. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding what P2 is.

Wait, maybe P2 is the rotor copper loss. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the output power is the mechanical power, which is P2 plus some other loss?

Wait, in induction motor theory, the power flow is: stator input = stator copper loss + rotor copper loss + mechanical power output + core losses.

Wait, but core losses are accounted for in the no-load test. So under load, the stator input is P1 = 3140 W. The stator copper loss under load is 3 * (I_L)^2 * R_per_phase.

I_L is 27.3 A, R is 0.128 ohms.

So P_copper_L = 3 * (27.3)^2 * 0.128.

Calculating that: 27.3 squared is approximately 745. So 3 * 745 = 2235, multiplied by 0.128 gives 2235 * 0.128 = approx 286. So P_copper_L ≈ 286 W.

So stator copper loss is 286 W.

So input power (P1) is 3140 W. So the remaining power is 3140 - 286 = 2854 W. This represents the power transferred to the rotor, minus the core losses, which are 686.6 W as calculated earlier.

Wait, but wait, the core losses are a constant loss that occurs even under load. So the power after stator copper loss is 3140 - 286 = 2854 W. Then, subtract the core losses (686.6 W), giving 2854 - 686.6 = 2167.4 W. This is the rotor input power, which is equal to the sum of rotor copper loss and the mechanical power output.

The rotor input power (P_rotor) = rotor copper loss (P_r) + mechanical power output (P_mech).

But to find P_rotor, we can also calculate it from the slip and the rotor current.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the slip first. The motor has eight poles, so the synchronous speed is (120 * f)/p = (120 *60)/8 = 900 rpm.

The rotor speed is 810 rpm. So slip s = (900 - 810)/900 = 90/900 = 0.1 or 10% slip.

Now, the rotor copper loss is s * P_rotor. Because in an induction motor, the rotor copper loss is proportional to the slip.

So P_r = s * P_rotor => P_rotor = P_r / s.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me see.

Alternatively, the mechanical power output is P_mech = (1 - s) * P_rotor. Because the rotor input is split into mechanical power and rotor copper loss, which is s * P_rotor.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula: mechanical power P_mech = (1 - s) * (P_rotor).

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach.

The total power after stator copper and core losses is 2167.4 W, which is the rotor input. So the rotor input is 2167.4 W. The rotor's power is split into rotor copper loss and mechanical power.

So P_rotor = 2167.4 W.

The rotor copper loss is (I_rotor)^2 * R_rotor. But I don't have R_rotor. Alternatively, using the slip formula:

P_rotor = (rotor current)^2 * (R_rotor / s) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can find the rotor current using the equivalent circuit approach.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the mechanical power from the output power given. The load test gives P2 as 1570 W. So if that's the mechanical power output, then P_mech = 1570 W.

So, if P_rotor = 1570 + P_r, and P_r = s * P_rotor.

So substituting, P_rotor = 1570 + s * P_rotor.

Rearranging, P_rotor - s * P_rotor = 1570 => P_rotor (1 - s) = 1570.

We know s is 0.1, so 1 - s = 0.9.

Thus, P_rotor = 1570 / 0.9 ≈ 1744.44 W.

So the rotor's input power is about 1744.44 W.

But earlier, I had the rotor input power as 2167.4 W (after subtracting stator copper and core losses). So that's a discrepancy. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps P2 isn't the mechanical output.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data. Maybe P2 is the rotor's output, which is the mechanical power. So if P2 is 1570 W, that's the mechanical power.

But then the rotor's input is 1570 / (1 - s) = 1570 / 0.9 ≈ 1744.44 W.

So the rotor's input is 1744.44 W, which must match the 2167.4 W I calculated earlier. But that's not matching, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the power flow again.

Stator input: 3140 W.

Stator copper loss: 286 W.

So power to rotor and core: 3140 - 286 = 2854 W.

No, wait, the core loss is a constant loss, which was 686.6 W as found from the no-load test. So the power after stator copper loss is 3140 - 286 = 2854 W. Then, subtract core loss to get the rotor input: 2854 - 686.6 = 2167.4 W.

So rotor input is 2167.4 W.

The rotor's mechanical output is P_mech = (1 - s) * (P_rotor - P_r).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to use the formula for mechanical power.

Wait, the mechanical power can be calculated from the speed and torque. Torque T = (P_mech * 5252) / rpm. But I don't have torque yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the rotor copper loss and then subtract from the rotor input to get the mechanical power.

So, rotor input is 2167.4 W.

Rotor copper loss is s * rotor input.

So P_r = 0.1 * 2167.4 = 216.74 W.

Thus, mechanical power P_mech = 2167.4 - 216.74 = 1950.66 W.

Convert that to horsepower: 1950.66 / 746 ≈ 2.614 hp. But the options are all higher than that. Hmm, that doesn't match any of the options either. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the output power is not 1570 W. Because in the load test, P2 is given as 1570 W. Maybe that's the rotor's mechanical output. So P_mech = 1570 W.

But then, using the slip s=0.1, the rotor input would be 1570 / (1 - s) = 1570 / 0.9 ≈ 1744.44 W.

But earlier, the rotor input is 2167.4 W, which is much higher. So this suggests that I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps P2 is the power transferred across the air gap, which is the rotor's input. So P2 = 1570 W is the rotor's input. So in that case, the mechanical power would be (1 - s) * 1570 = 0.9 * 1570 = 1413 W.

But then, that's about 1.89 hp, which is still lower than the options. So I'm clearly misunderstanding something about the given data.

Wait, perhaps the P2 in the load test is the mechanical output. So if P2 is 1570 W, then that's the mechanical power. So the horsepower output is 1570 W / 746 ≈ 2.1 hp. But the options don't have that. So maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the output is actually the shaft output in horsepower, but the given P2 isn't that. Alternatively, perhaps the horsepower is calculated using torque and speed.

Wait, part (b) asks for torque, so maybe I can find torque first, which would help in finding the horsepower.

The torque can be found using the formula T = (5252 * P_mech) / rpm.

But I'm not sure about P_mech. Alternatively, torque can be found from the rotational speed and the power.

Wait, power is torque multiplied by angular velocity. So torque T = P / ω, where ω is in radians per second.

The rotor speed is 810 rpm. Let's convert that to radians per second: 810 * 2π /60 = 810 * π /30 ≈ 26.8 rad/s.

If the mechanical power is P_mech, then T = P_mech / ω.

But I'm not sure what P_mech is. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate torque using the current and other parameters.

Wait, another approach is to find the developed torque using the formula involving the slip, rotor current, etc. But I'm not sure about the rotor current.

Wait, the stator current under load is 27.3 A. The no-load current is 10 A. So the difference might be due to the load.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to calculate the torque from the given data.

The synchronous speed is 900 rpm, and the rotor speed is 810 rpm, giving a slip of 10%.

The torque can be calculated using the formula:

Torque T = (P_rotor * (1 - s)) / (2π * N_sync / 60)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, using the formula for torque in terms of power and speed.

Wait, the mechanical power P_mech is T * ω, where ω is in radians per second.

So ω = 810 rpm = 810 * 2π /60 = 26.8 rad/s.

If I can find P_mech, then T = P_mech / ω.

But again, I'm stuck on P_mech.

Wait, perhaps the output power is 1570 W. So P_mech = 1570 W.

Then T = 1570 / 26.8 ≈ 58.58 Nm.

Convert that to lb-ft: 1 Nm ≈ 0.7376 lb-ft. So 58.58 * 0.7376 ≈ 43.
