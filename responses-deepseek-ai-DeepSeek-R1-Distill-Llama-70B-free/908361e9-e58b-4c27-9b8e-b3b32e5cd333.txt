Okay, so I have this question about overfitting in machine learning, and I need to figure out whether the two statements are true or false. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question has two statements:

1. Overfitting is more likely when the set of training data is small.
2. Overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small.

And I have to determine if each is true or false, then pick the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's start with the first statement. I remember that overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. One of the common causes is when the training dataset is too small. If there's not enough data, the model might learn the noise and outliers in the training set rather than the underlying patterns. So a small training set can definitely lead to overfitting. That makes Statement 1 true.

Now, the second statement: overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is small. Hmm. Wait, the hypothesis space refers to the set of all possible models or functions that the learning algorithm can choose from. If the hypothesis space is small, that means the model has limited flexibility. I think a smaller hypothesis space would actually reduce the risk of overfitting because the model can't fit the training data too closely. For example, a linear model (small hypothesis space) is less likely to overfit compared to a high-degree polynomial model (large hypothesis space). So a small hypothesis space might lead to underfitting instead. Therefore, Statement 2 seems false because overfitting is more likely when the hypothesis space is large, not small.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. If the hypothesis space is too big, the model can memorize the training data, which is bad. So yes, a larger hypothesis space increases the chance of overfitting. So a small hypothesis space would mean the model is simpler and less prone to overfitting. So Statement 2 says overfitting is more likely when hypothesis space is smallâ€”that's incorrect. So Statement 2 is false.

So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Now I need to look at the options and see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option F says: True, False. That's exactly what I concluded. So the answer should be F.

Statement 1 is true because a small training dataset can lead to overfitting, as the model may learn noise instead of patterns. Statement 2 is false because a small hypothesis space reduces overfitting by limiting model complexity, making underfitting more likely instead.

Answer: F
