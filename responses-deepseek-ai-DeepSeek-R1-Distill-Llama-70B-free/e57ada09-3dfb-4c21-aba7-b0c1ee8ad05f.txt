Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that a single firm has a monopoly on the widget market. They can produce at constant average and marginal costs, both equal to 10. The original market demand curve is Q = 60 - P. I need to find the profit-maximizing price for the firm.

Hmm, I remember that in a monopoly situation, the firm is the sole supplier, so they face the market demand curve. Profit maximization happens where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Right, so I need to find the point where MR = MC.

Wait, but the given demand is in the form Q = 60 - P. Maybe it's easier to express this as P in terms of Q. Let me rearrange that. So, P = 60 - Q. That makes sense because as quantity increases, price decreases, which aligns with the law of demand.

Now, to find the revenue, I know that revenue (R) is price multiplied by quantity. So R = P * Q. Since P is (60 - Q), substituting that in, R = (60 - Q) * Q. That simplifies to R = 60Q - Q². 

Next, I need to find the marginal revenue (MR). MR is the derivative of the revenue with respect to Q. So taking the derivative of R = 60Q - Q², I get MR = 60 - 2Q. Oh wait, that's right because the derivative of 60Q is 60, and the derivative of Q squared is 2Q, so it's 60 - 2Q.

The marginal cost (MC) is given as 10. So to find the profit-maximizing quantity, I set MR equal to MC. So 60 - 2Q = 10. Solving for Q: 60 - 10 = 2Q → 50 = 2Q → Q = 25.

Wait, but I need the price, not the quantity. So once I have Q=25, I plug this back into the demand equation to find P. The demand equation is P = 60 - Q. So P = 60 - 25 = 35. So the price is 35.

Let me double-check. MC is 10. MR is 60-2Q. Setting them equal gives Q=25. Then P = 60 - 25 = 35. So the answer should be 35. Looking at the options, H is 35.

I think that's correct. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I correctly calculate MR? Yes, from R=60Q - Q², MR is the derivative, which is 60 - 2Q. Setting that equal to MC of 10, yes, gives Q=25. Then P=35. Yep, that's right.
</think>

To determine the profit-maximizing price for the monopolistic firm, we start by noting that profit maximization occurs where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). The market demand curve is given as \( Q = 60 - P \), which can be rearranged to \( P = 60 - Q \). 

Revenue (\( R \)) is calculated as \( P \times Q \), so substituting \( P = 60 - Q \), we get:
\[
R = (60 - Q) \cdot Q = 60Q - Q^2
\]

Marginal revenue is the derivative of the revenue function with respect to \( Q \):
\[
MR = \frac{dR}{dQ} = 60 - 2Q
\]

The marginal cost (MC) is given as 10. Setting \( MR = MC \) to find the profit-maximizing quantity:
\[
60 - 2Q = 10
\]
\[
2Q = 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q = 25
\]

Substituting \( Q = 25 \) back into the demand equation \( P = 60 - Q \) to find the price:
\[
P = 60 - 25 = 35
\]

Thus, the profit-maximizing price is 35. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

H: 35
