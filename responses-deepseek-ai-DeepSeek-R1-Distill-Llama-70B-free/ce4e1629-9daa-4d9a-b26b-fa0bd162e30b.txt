Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about when the earliest humans appear in a two-hour movie that represents the entire history of the universe. Hmm, I remember that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old, right? And human history is just a tiny fraction of that.

Wait, the question is structured as a timeline where the whole universe's history is condensed into a two-hour movie. So each second of the movie represents a certain number of years in real life. I think I need to calculate how much time humans take up in this timeline.

Let me break it down. The movie is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes or 7200 seconds. The universe is 13.8 billion years old. So, let's convert that into seconds to make it easier. One year is about 31,536,000 seconds (since 365 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds). So 13.8 billion years is 13.8e9 * 31,536,000 seconds. But wait, maybe I don't need the exact number because the question is about proportion.

If the entire universe is 13.8 billion years, and humans appeared, oh, I think around 300,000 years ago. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The earliest humans, like Homo sapiens, appeared about 300,000 years ago in Africa. But the human family, maybe including earlier hominids, goes back a few million years. So let's say roughly 2.5 million years ago for the earliest members.

So the time from the big bang to now is 13.8 billion years. The time humans have been around is about 2.5 million years. So the fraction of the movie that humans take up is 2.5 million divided by 13.8 billion.

Let me calculate that: 2.5e6 / 13.8e9 = approximately 0.000181. So that's 0.0181% of the total time. 

Now, the movie is 120 minutes long. So 0.0181% of 120 minutes is how much time? Let's compute that. 120 * 0.000181 = about 0.0217 minutes. Converting that to seconds, 0.0217 *60 ≈ 1.3 seconds.

So the earliest humans appear in the last couple of seconds of the movie. Looking at the options, option F says during the final 3 seconds. Option D is the final 30 seconds, which would be way too long. Option G is at the end, which is vague, but F is more precise. Option H is 10 minutes, which is way off.

Wait, but I might have miscalculated. Let me check again. 2.5 million years is 2.5e6, and 13.8e9 is 13,800 million. So 2.5 /13,800 is approximately 0.000181, which is about 0.018%. So 0.018% of 7200 seconds (since 2 hours = 7200 seconds) is 7200 * 0.000181 ≈ 1.3 seconds. So yeah, about 1.3 seconds, so the earliest humans would appear in the last couple of seconds.

Looking at the options, F is 3 seconds, which is close. So the earliest humans appear in the final 3 seconds of the film.
