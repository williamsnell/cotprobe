Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry has always been a little tricky for me. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem involves a reaction between ferric sulfate (Fe₂(SO₄)₃) and barium chloride (BaCl₂), producing barium sulfate (BaSO₄) and ferric chloride (FeCl₃). The balanced equation is given: Fe₂(SO₄)₃ + 3BaCl₂ → 3BaSO₄↓ + 2FeCl₃.

There are three parts to the question, labeled (A), (B), and (C). Each part asks for a specific mass related to the reaction. The options are given as A through J, each with three values. My job is to calculate each part and see which option matches all three.

Starting with part (A): How much BaCl₂ should be used to react with 10 grams of Fe₂(SO₄)₃?

So, I think I need to find the molar ratio between Fe₂(SO₄)₃ and BaCl₂ from the balanced equation. The equation shows a 1:3 ratio. For every mole of Fe₂(SO₄)₃, three moles of BaCl₂ are needed.

First, I'll calculate the molar mass of Fe₂(SO₄)₃. Breaking it down:

- Fe: atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol. There are 2 Fe atoms, so 2 * 55.85 = 111.7 g/mol.
- S: atomic weight around 32.07 g/mol. Each sulfate has one S, and there are 3 sulfates, so 3 * 32.07 = 96.21 g/mol.
- O: in sulfate (SO₄^2-), each has 4 O. So 4 O per sulfate, times 3 sulfates: 4*3=12 O atoms. O is about 16 g/mol, so 12 * 16 = 192 g/mol.

Adding those together: 111.7 (Fe) + 96.21 (S) + 192 (O) = 399.91 g/mol for Fe₂(SO₄)₃.

Next, molar mass of BaCl₂:

- Ba is about 137.33 g/mol.
- Cl is about 35.45 g/mol, and there are 2 Cl atoms: 2 * 35.45 = 70.90 g/mol.
Total: 137.33 + 70.90 = 208.23 g/mol.

Now, the reaction ratio is 1 mole Fe₂(SO₄)₃ to 3 moles BaCl₂.

Given 10 grams of Fe₂(SO₄)₃, I'll find how many moles that is:

Moles = mass / molar mass = 10 g / 399.91 g/mol ≈ 0.02502 mol.

Since the ratio is 1:3, moles of BaCl₂ needed = 3 * 0.02502 ≈ 0.07506 mol.

Now, convert moles of BaCl₂ to grams:

Mass = moles * molar mass = 0.07506 mol * 208.23 g/mol ≈ 15.62 grams.

Wait, looking at the options, in part (A), option H has 15.62 grams for part (A). So part (A) would be 15.62 grams. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the molar masses to be precise.

Fe₂(SO₄)₃:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol * 2 = 111.69 g/mol.

S: 32.065 * 3 = 96.195 g/mol.

O: 16.00 g/mol * (4 * 3) = 12 * 16 = 192.00 g/mol.

Total: 111.69 + 96.195 = 207.885; 207.885 + 192 = 399.885 g/mol. So approximately 399.89 g/mol.

So 10 grams is 10 / 399.89 ≈ 0.02502 mol.

Times 3 gives 0.07506 mol BaCl₂.

BaCl₂'s molar mass:

Ba: 137.327 g/mol, Cl: 35.45 * 2 = 70.90. Total: 137.327 +70.90 = 208.227 g/mol.

So 0.07506 mol * 208.227 g/mol = let's compute that.

0.07506 * 200 = 15.012; 0.07506 * 8.227 ≈ approx 0.07506 * 8 = 0.60048; 0.07506 * 0.227 ≈ 0.01704.

Adding 15.012 + 0.60048 = 15.61248 + 0.01704 ≈ 15.6295 grams. So approximately 15.63 grams, which matches the 15.62 in option H. So part (A) is 15.62 grams, which is option H's first value.

Wait, but looking back, the options for part (A) in all the choices are the first numbers. So option H says 15.62 grams for part (A). That seems correct.

Moving on to part (B): How much Fe₂(SO₄)₃ is needed to produce 100 grams of BaSO₄?

So I need to relate Fe₂(SO₄)₃ to BaSO₄ using the balanced equation. The ratio is 1 mole Fe₂(SO₄)₃ to 3 moles BaSO₄.

So first, find moles of BaSO₄ in 100 grams.

Molar mass of BaSO₄: Ba is 137.327, S is 32.065, O is 16 *4=64. So total is 137.327 +32.065 +64 = 233.392 g/mol.

Moles of BaSO₄ = 100 g / 233.392 g/mol ≈ 0.4286 mol.

Since the ratio is 3 moles BaSO₄ per 1 mole Fe₂(SO₄)₃, the moles of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ needed is 0.4286 / 3 ≈ 0.14286 mol.

Mass of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ is moles * molar mass = 0.14286 mol * 399.89 g/mol.

Calculating: 0.14286 * 400 = approx 57.144 grams. Wait, more accurately:

0.14286 * 399.89 → Let me compute 0.14286 * 400 = 57.144; but since it's 399.89, which is 0.11 less than 400, so 0.14286 * 0.11 = 0.0157146. Subtract that from 57.144: 57.144 - 0.0157146 ≈ 57.1283 grams.

Wait, that's about 57.13 grams. But looking at the options, let's see which option's part (B) is around 57 grams.

Looking at the options:

Option H has (A) 15.62, (B)57.11, (C)40.56.

Option G has (B)70.29, which is higher. Option A has (B)67.11. Option C (B)61.88, D (B)57.11 is in option H's part (B): 57.11.

Wait, wait, but my calculation gave me approximately 57.13, which is very close to 57.11. So part (B) is 57.11 grams, which is option H's second value.

Wait, but let me double-check the ratio. The balanced equation is 1 Fe₂(SO₄)₃ producing 3 BaSO₄. So yes, to get 3 moles of BaSO₄, you need 1 mole Fe₂(SO₄)₃. So for 0.4286 moles BaSO₄, it's 0.4286 /3 = 0.14286 moles Fe₂(SO₄)₃.

Yes, and the molar mass is 399.89, so 0.14286 * 399.89 is indeed approximately 57.13 grams. So 57.11 is correct, matching option H's part (B).

Now part (C): From a mixture of 50 g Fe₂(SO₄)₃ and 100 g BaCl₂, how much FeCl₃ can be produced?

This is a limiting reactant problem. I need to determine which reactant is the limiting one.

First, find moles of each reactant.

Moles of Fe₂(SO₄)₃:

Mass =50 g, molar mass=399.89 g/mol → 50 / 399.89 ≈ 0.125 mole.

Moles of BaCl₂: 100 g / 208.23 g/mol ≈ 0.4805 mole.

The reaction is 1 Fe₂(SO₄)₃ : 3 BaCl₂.

So, find how much each can react.

The ratio is 1:3, so for Fe₂(SO₄)₃, the required BaCl₂ is 3 * moles Fe₂(SO₄)₃.

So required BaCl₂ for 0.125 Fe₂(SO₄)₃ is 3 * 0.125 = 0.375 moles.

But available BaCl₂ is 0.4805 moles, which is more than 0.375. So Fe₂(SO₄)₃ is the limiting reactant.

So the reaction will proceed based on Fe₂(SO₄)₃. So the amount of FeCl₃ produced depends on Fe₂(SO₄)₃.

From the balanced equation, 1 mole Fe₂(SO₄)₃ produces 2 moles FeCl₃.

So moles FeCl₃ = 0.125 * 2 = 0.25 moles.

Molar mass of FeCl₃: Fe is 55.845, Cl is 35.45 *3 =106.35. So total is 55.845 +106.35 =162.195 g/mol.

Mass of FeCl₃ = 0.25 mol *162.195 g/mol ≈40.54875 grams. So approximately 40.55 grams.

Looking at the options, option H's part (C) is 40.56 grams, which matches.

So all three parts:

(A)15.62g, (B)57.11g, (C)40.56g → option H.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically using stoichiometry and the given balanced equation:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\text{Fe}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 + 3\text{BaCl}_2 \rightarrow 3\text{BaSO}_4 \downarrow + 2\text{FeCl}_3
\]

### Part (A): How much BaCl₂ is needed to react with 10 g of Fe₂(SO₄)₃?

1. **Molar mass of Fe₂(SO₄)₃**:  
   \[
   \text{Fe}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = 2(55.85) + 3(32.07 + 4(16)) = 399.89 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

2. **Moles of Fe₂(SO₄)₃**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{10}{399.89} \approx 0.02502 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Molar ratio**: From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ reacts with 3 moles of BaCl₂.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of BaCl}_2 = 3 \times 0.02502 \approx 0.07506 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Molar mass of BaCl₂**:  
   \[
   \text{BaCl}_2 = 137.33 + 2(35.45) = 208.23 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

5. **Mass of BaCl₂**:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass} = 0.07506 \times 208.23 \approx 15.62 \, \text{g}
   \]

Thus, **15.62 g of BaCl₂** is required.

### Part (B): How much Fe₂(SO₄)₃ is needed to produce 100 g of BaSO₄?

1. **Molar mass of BaSO₄**:  
   \[
   \text{BaSO}_4 = 137.33 + 32.07 + 4(16) = 233.39 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

2. **Moles of BaSO₄**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{100}{233.39} \approx 0.4286 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Molar ratio**: From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ produces 3 moles of BaSO₄.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Fe}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 = \frac{0.4286}{3} \approx 0.14286 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Mass of Fe₂(SO₄)₃**:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass} = 0.14286 \times 399.89 \approx 57.11 \, \text{g}
   \]

Thus, **57.11 g of Fe₂(SO₄)₃** is required.

### Part (C): How much FeCl₃ can be produced from 50 g of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ and 100 g of BaCl₂?

1. **Limiting reactant**:  
   - **Moles of Fe₂(SO₄)₃**:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{50}{399.89} \approx 0.125 \, \text{mol}
     \]
   - **Moles of BaCl₂**:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{100}{208.23} \approx 0.4805 \, \text{mol}
     \]
   - From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ reacts with 3 moles of BaCl₂.  
     \[
     \text{Required BaCl}_2 = 3 \times 0.125 = 0.375 \, \text{mol}
     \]
     Since 0.4805 moles of BaCl₂ are available, Fe₂(SO₄)₃ is the limiting reactant.

2. **Moles of FeCl₃**: From the balanced equation, 1 mole of Fe₂(SO₄)₃ produces 2 moles of FeCl₃.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of FeCl}_3 = 0.125 \times 2 = 0.25 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Molar mass of FeCl₃**:  
   \[
   \text{FeCl}_3 = 55.85 + 3(35.45) = 162.20 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

4. **Mass of FeCl₃**:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass} = 0.25 \times 162.20 \approx 40.56 \, \text{g}
   \]

Thus, **40.56 g of FeCl₃** can be produced.
