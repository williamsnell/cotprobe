Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to write 27 over 36 in its simplest form. Hmm, right, that's a fraction, and I remember that simplifying a fraction means reducing it to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. 

Wait, let me think about how to do that. So the fraction is 27/36. I guess the first step is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 27 and 36. I remember that the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

Let me list the factors of each number. For 27, the factors are 1, 3, 9, 27. For 36, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Now I need to find the common factors. The common ones are 1, 3, 9. So the greatest one is 9. 

Okay, so I should divide both numerator and denominator by 9. Let's do that. 27 divided by 9 is 3, and 36 divided by 9 is 4. So the simplified fraction is 3/4. 

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 9 is 27, and 4 times 9 is 36. Yep, that checks out. And 3 and 4 don't have any common factors other than 1, so that's definitely the simplest form.

Now, looking at the options given. Option I is 3 over 4, which matches what I got. So the answer should be I.

To simplify the fraction 27/36, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 27 and 36, which is 9. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 9 gives 3/4. Among the options, 3/4 corresponds to option I.
