Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It says that 0.0324 Faradays liberated 0.651 grams of Calcium, and I need to find the atomic weight of Calcium from the given options. Hmm, I think I remember something about Faraday's laws of electrolysis here. Let me try to piece this together.

First, I recall Faraday's first law, which states that the amount of substance liberated at an electrode is directly proportional to the amount of electricity that passes through the solution. The formula I think is m = (M * Q) / (n * F), where m is mass, M is molar mass, Q is the charge in coulombs, n is the valency or the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant.

Wait, but wait, the question gives the charge in Faradays, not coulombs. Oh right, because 1 Faraday is the charge of one mole of electrons, which is approximately 96485 coulombs per mole. So maybe I can work directly with Faraday units here.

So the formula might simplify when using Faraday units. Let me think again. The equation should relate the mass deposited to the quantity of electricity. I think another way to write this is: m = (M * F) / (n), where F is in Faraday units.

Wait, no, perhaps it's m = (M * Q) / (n * F), but since Q is given in Faraday, which is F units, maybe the F in the denominator cancels out. Let me think. Oh, right, because each Faraday is F coulombs. So if Q is in Faraday, then Q * F would give coulombs, but in the formula we have Q in coulombs divided by F, so perhaps when using Faraday units, the equation becomes m = (M * Q_Faraday) / (n).

Wait, let me get this straight. The formula m = (M * Q) / (n * F) comes from the fact that Q is in coulombs. So when Q is in Faraday, which is Q_F = Q / F, then substituting into the equation would give m = (M * Q_F * F) / (n * F) ), so F cancels out, leaving m = (M * Q_F) / n.

Yes, that makes sense. So the formula simplifies to m = (M * Q_F) / n.

Now, I need to find M, the molar mass of Calcium. So rearranging the formula, M = (m * n) / Q_F.

What's the value of n for Calcium? Calcium is a group 2 metal, so it has a +2 charge. That means each Calcium ion gains 2 electrons to become a neutral atom. So n = 2.

Given that, the mass m is 0.651 grams, and Q_F is 0.0324 Faraday.

Plugging in the numbers: M = (0.651 g * 2) / 0.0324 F.

Let me calculate that. 0.651 multiplied by 2 is 1.302. Then, 1.302 divided by 0.0324.

Wait, let me compute that. 1.302 / 0.0324. Hmm, let me write it as 1.302 รท 0.0324.

Alternatively, maybe I can simplify the numbers. Let's see, 1.302 divided by 0.0324 is the same as (1.302 * 1000) / (0.0324 * 1000) ) = 1302 / 32.4.

Wait, 32.4 times 40 is 1296. Because 32.4 * 40 = 32.4 *4 *10 = 129.6 *10= 1296. So 32.4 *40=1296. Then 1302 is 6 more than 1296. So 40 with a remainder of 6.

So 1302 /32.4 = 40 + (6/32.4). Let's compute 6/32.4. 32.4 is approximately 32.4, so 6 divided by 32.4 is approximately 0.185. So total is approximately 40.185.

Wait, but wait, let me check the exact calculation. 32.4 multiplied by 40 is 1296. Then 1302 - 1296 is 6. So 6/32.4 equals 0.185185... So 40.185.

Wait, but wait, 32.4 * 40.185 is 32.4*(40 + 0.185) = 1296 + (32.4 * 0.185). Let me compute 32.4 * 0.185.

32.4 * 0.1 = 3.24

32.4 * 0.08 = 2.592

32.4 * 0.005 = 0.162

So 3.24 + 2.592 = 5.832, plus 0.162 = 5.994. So approximately 5.994, so total is 1296 + 5.994 = 1301.994, which is about 1302. So correct.

So M is approximately 40.185 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is 40.2, which is very close. So the correct answer should be B:40.2.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So using m = (M * Q) / n, solving for M gives M = (m * n) / Q.

m is 0.651g, n is 2, Q is 0.0324 F.

So (0.651 * 2) = 1.302. 1.302 / 0.0324 = 40.185, which rounds to 40.2. So yes, option B is correct.

To determine the atomic weight of Calcium (Ca), we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The relationship between the mass of a substance liberated, the molar mass, and the quantity of electricity is given by:

\[
m = \frac{M \cdot Q}{n}
\]

Where:
- \( m \) is the mass of Calcium liberated (\( 0.651 \, \text{g} \)),
- \( M \) is the molar mass of Calcium (to be determined),
- \( Q \) is the quantity of electricity in Faraday units (\( 0.0324 \, \text{F} \)),
- \( n \) is the number of electrons transferred (for Calcium, \( n = 2 \), as it is a group 2 metal).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{m \cdot n}{Q}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
M = \frac{0.651 \cdot 2}{0.0324}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.651 \cdot 2 = 1.302
\]

Then divide by \( 0.0324 \):

\[
M = \frac{1.302}{0.0324} \approx 40.185
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, \( M \approx 40.2 \, \text{g/mol} \).

From the given options, the closest value is **40.2**, which corresponds to option **B**.
