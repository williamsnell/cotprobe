Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question is asking what equal positive charges would have to be placed on Earth and the Moon to neutralize their gravitational attraction. Hmm, that sounds interesting. I think I remember something about gravitational force and electric force being related here.

Alright, so the idea is that the gravitational pull between Earth and Moon is keeping them in orbit. But if we place charges on both, these charges would create an electric force. The question wants these two forces to balance each other, right? So the gravitational force equals the electric force.

Wait, but wait. The gravitational force is attractive, and the electric force when both are positive would be repulsive. So to neutralize the gravitational attraction, the electric force must provide an equal and opposite force. So the electric force should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, making the net force zero. So the charges would need to be positive so that the electric force is repulsive, countering the gravitational pull.

So the formula for gravitational force is F_grav = G * (M * m) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, m is Moon's mass, and r is the distance between them. The electric force is F_elec = k * (q * q) / r², because both charges are the same and it's q squared.

Since the forces need to balance each other, we set them equal. So F_grav = F_elec. That gives G*(M*m)/r² = k*(q²)/r². Oh wait, the r² terms cancel out, which is nice. So that leaves G*(M*m) = k*q².

I think I remember the values for G and k. Let me see. G is the gravitational constant, approximately 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². Coulomb's constant k is about 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

Now, the masses of Earth and Moon. Earth's mass is roughly 5.97×10^24 kg, and the Moon is about 7.35×10^22 kg. So M = 5.97e24 kg, m = 7.35e22 kg.

The distance between Earth and Moon varies, but on average it's about 3.84×10^8 meters. But wait, in the equation, r² cancels out, so I don't need the distance after all. That's a relief because I sometimes mix up the exact value.

So putting the numbers into the equation: G*M*m = k*q². I need to solve for q.

Let me write that equation again:

q² = (G * M * m) / k

So q = sqrt( (G * M * m) / k )

Let me plug in the numbers:

G = 6.674e-11
M = 5.97e24 kg
m = 7.35e22 kg
k = 8.988e9

Calculating the numerator first: G * M * m.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, G * M = 6.674e-11 * 5.97e24
= (6.674 * 5.97) * 1e13 --> because 1e-11 * 1e24 is 1e13
6.674 * 5.97 is about...
Let me calculate 6 * 6 is 36, but more accurately:
6.674 * 5.97: 6 *5 is 30, 6*0.97 is ~5.82, 0.674 *5 is ~3.37, 0.674 *0.97 is ~0.654. Hmm, adding up: 30 +5.82=35.82 +3.37=39.19 +0.654= approx 39.84. So 6.674e-11 *5.97e24 = approx 39.84e13 = 3.984e14.

Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let's compute 6.674 *5.97.

6 *5 =30, 6 *0.97=5.82, 0.674 *5 =3.37, 0.674 *0.97 = 0.654. Adding all together: 30 +5.82=35.82 +3.37=39.19 +0.654=39.844. So yes, 39.844e13 is 3.9844e14.

Now multiply by m, which is 7.35e22 kg.

So 3.9844e14 *7.35e22 = (3.9844 *7.35) * 1e36.

Calculate 3.9844 *7.35:

3 *7 =21, 3 *0.35=1.05, 0.9844*7=6.8908, 0.9844*0.35≈0.3445.

Adding up: 21 +1.05=22.05 +6.8908=28.9408 +0.3445=29.2853.

So approximately 29.2853e36 = 2.92853e37.

Wait wait, no, wait. Because 3.9844e14 *7.35e22 = 3.9844 *7.35 = ~29.285, and 1e14 *1e22 = 1e36. So 29.285e36 = 2.9285e37.

Now the numerator is 2.9285e37.

The denominator is k, which is 8.988e9.

So q² = (2.9285e37) / (8.988e9) = (2.9285 /8.988 )e(37-9) = (approx 0.3258) e28 = 3.258e27.

Wait, because 2.9285 divided by 8.988 is about 0.3258.

So q squared is 3.258e27 C². So q is the square root of that.

So q = sqrt(3.258e27) = sqrt(3.258) * 1e13.5.

Wait, 1e27 is (1e13.5)^2, because 13.5 *2=27. So 1e13.5 is 1e13 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162e13.

So sqrt(3.258) is approx 1.805.

So 1.805 * 3.162e13 = ?

1.8 *3 is 5.4, 1.8 *0.162≈0.2916, 0.05 *3=0.15, 0.05 *0.162=0.0081.

Wait perhaps I should compute 1.805 * 3.162.

Let me compute 1.8 *3.162 = 5.692. Then 0.005 *3.162=0.01581. So total is 5.7078, approximately 5.708e13.

Wait, but my previous step: wait, q squared is 3.258e27 C², so sqrt(3.258e27)= sqrt(3.258)*1e13.5.

Wait, 1e13.5 is 1e13 * sqrt(10) ≈3.162e13 C. So sqrt(3.258) is about 1.805, so 1.805 *3.162e13 = ?

1.805 *3.162: Let me compute 1.8 *3.162 = 5.6916, plus 0.005*3.162=0.01581. So total is 5.7074e13 C.

So approximately 5.7e13 C.

Looking at the options, option H is 5.7e13 C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait q squared is (G*M*m)/(k). Let me recompute the numerator and denominator.

G =6.674e-11, M=5.97e24, m=7.35e22.

So G*M*m =6.674e-11 *5.97e24 *7.35e22.

Let me compute the exponents first: 1e-11 *1e24 *1e22 =1e( -11 +24 +22 )= 1e35.

Wait wait, 1e-11 * 1e24 = 1e13. Then 1e13 *1e22=1e35.

So the exponents part is 1e35.

Now the coefficients: 6.674 *5.97 *7.35.

Compute 6.674 *5.97 first.

6 *5 is 30, 6 *0.97=5.82, 0.674*5=3.37, 0.674*0.97≈0.654.

So 30 +5.82=35.82 +3.37=39.19 +0.654=39.844.

Now 39.844 *7.35.

Let me compute 39 *7 =273, 39 *0.35=13.65, 0.844 *7≈5.908, 0.844 *0.35≈0.2954.

Adding up:

273 +13.65=286.65 +5.908=292.558 +0.2954=292.8534.

So the coefficient is 292.8534.

So numerator is 292.8534e35.

Wait, no, no. Because 6.674e-11 *5.97e24 = (6.674 *5.97)e( -11 +24 )= 39.844e13 =3.9844e14.

Then multiplied by 7.35e22 gives 3.9844e14 *7.35e22 = (3.9844 *7.35) *1e(14+22)= 29.285e36=2.9285e37.

So the numerator is 2.9285e37.

Denominator is k=8.988e9.

So q² = 2.9285e37 /8.988e9 = (2.9285 /8.988 )e(37-9) = 0.3258e28 = 3.258e27.

q is sqrt(3.258e27) = sqrt(3.258) * 1e13.5.

sqrt(3.258)= approx 1.805. 1e13.5 is sqrt(1e27)=1e13.5= approx 3.162e13.

So 1.805 *3.162e13= approx 5.707e13 C. So about 5.7e13 C.

Looking at the options:

Option H is 5.7e13 C.

So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the equal positive charges that must be placed on Earth and the Moon to neutralize their gravitational attraction, we equate the gravitational force and the electric force between the two bodies. The gravitational force is given by:

\[
F_{\text{grav}} = G \frac{M m}{r^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / kg^2} \)), \( M \) is the mass of Earth (\( 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \mathrm{kg} \)), \( m \) is the mass of the Moon (\( 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \mathrm{kg} \)), and \( r \) is the average distance between Earth and the Moon (\( 3.84 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m} \)).

The electric force is given by Coulomb's law:

\[
F_{\text{elec}} = k \frac{q^2}{r^2}
\]

where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant (\( 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \)) and \( q \) is the charge to be determined. Since the forces must balance, we set \( F_{\text{grav}} = F_{\text{elec}} \), which simplifies to:

\[
G M m = k q^2
\]

Rearranging for \( q \):

\[
q = \sqrt{\frac{G M m}{k}}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \)
- \( M = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \)
- \( m = 7.35 \times 10^{22} \)
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \)

First, calculate the numerator \( G M m \):
\[
G M m = (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) (5.97 \times 10^{24}) (7.35 \times 10^{22})
\]
\[
G M m = 2.9285 \times 10^{37}
\]

Now divide by \( k \):
\[
\frac{G M m}{k} = \frac{2.9285 \times 10^{37}}{8.988 \times 10^9} = 3.258 \times 10^{27}
\]

Take the square root to find \( q \):
\[
q = \sqrt{3.258 \times 10^{27}} = \sqrt{3.258} \times 10^{13.5}
\]
\[
q \approx 1.805 \times 3.162 \times 10^{13} = 5.707 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

Thus, the required charge is approximately \( 5.7 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{C} \), which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
