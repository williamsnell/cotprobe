Okay, so I've got this question here about how cyanobacteria differ from green unicellular algae. Hmm, I remember that both of these are photosynthetic organisms, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences. Let me think through this.

First, I should recall what I know about cyanobacteria. They're bacteria, right? So they're prokaryotic cells, meaning they don't have a nucleus or any membrane-bound organelles. Green algae, on the other hand, are eukaryotic. So their cells have a nucleus and other organelles like chloroplasts. Oh wait, but wait—some green algae are unicellular, like Chlamydomonas, right? So the question is specifically about unicellular green algae.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Cyanobacteria reduce sulfur compounds. I'm not sure about this. I think some bacteria can reduce sulfur, like in sulfur-reducing bacteria, but I don't know if cyanobacteria specifically do this. Maybe they use sulfur compounds, but I don't remember if that's a key difference.

Option B: Cyanobacteria have no nuclei. That makes sense because they're prokaryotes. Green algae being eukaryotes would have nuclei. So this could be a correct difference.

Option C: Green algae cannot reduce nitrogen compounds. Wait, nitrogen reduction—like converting nitrates to ammonia? I think plants, including algae, can do that. Maybe some bacteria can fix nitrogen, but I'm not sure if this is a key point between cyanobacteria and green algae.

Option D: Green algae cannot photosynthesize. No, that's not right. Both can photosynthesize. Green algae photosynthesize using chlorophyll, same as cyanobacteria do.

Option E: Green algae produce cell membranes. Well, all cells have cell membranes, so that can't be the difference. Unless it's referring to something specific like lipid composition, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option F: Green algae have no chlorophyll. No, that's wrong. Green algae have chlorophyll a and b, which gives them their green color. Cyanobacteria have chlorophyll a, but also phycobiliproteins like phycocyanin, which gives them a blue color. So this option is incorrect.

Option G: Cyanobacteria lack cell walls. Wait, I thought they have cell walls, similar to other bacteria. Green algae also have cell walls, usually made of cellulose. Maybe some cyanobacteria have different cell wall structures, but I don't think they lack them entirely.

Option H: Cyanobacteria can photosynthesize. Yes, that's correct, but wait—so can green algae. So if the question is about the difference, this option isn't highlighting a difference but a similarity. So it's not the right answer in this context.

Wait, the question is asking how they differ. So which one points out a difference.

So, looking back, option B says cyanobacteria have no nuclei, which is correct because they're prokaryotes. Green algae, being eukaryotes, have nuclei. So that's a key difference.

Option H is about photosynthesis, which both do, so not a difference.

So the correct answer should be B. Let me double-check the other options again to be sure.

Option B is correct. Other options don't really capture the main difference. For example, option C, I'm not sure about, but I don't think it's a main distinguishing feature. The major difference is the presence of a nucleus in green algae and absence in cyanobacteria.

Cyanobacteria and green unicellular algae are both photosynthetic organisms, but they differ fundamentally in their cellular structure. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotic, meaning they lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. In contrast, green algae are eukaryotic, with cells that include a nucleus and organelles like chloroplasts. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While some bacteria reduce sulfur compounds, this is not a defining feature of cyanobacteria.  
- **B**: Correct. Cyanobacteria lack nuclei due to their prokaryotic nature, whereas green algae have nuclei.  
- **C**: Green algae can reduce nitrogen compounds, so this is not a valid distinction.  
- **D**: Incorrect, as both cyanobacteria and green algae photosynthesize.  
- **E**: All cells produce membranes, so this does not differentiate them.  
- **F**: Green algae do have chlorophyll, so this is incorrect.  
- **G**: Cyanobacteria do have cell walls, so this is not accurate.  
- **H**: While true, it does not highlight a difference since both photosynthesize.  

The key difference is that cyanobacteria lack nuclei, making **B** the correct answer.

Answer: B
