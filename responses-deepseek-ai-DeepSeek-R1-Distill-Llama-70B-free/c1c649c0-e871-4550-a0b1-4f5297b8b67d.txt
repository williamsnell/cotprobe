Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Hmm, I remember that the principle has something to do with the uncertainty in position and momentum. Oh right, the equation is something like Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. 

The problem says a car has a mass of 1x10^3 kg and is moving at 10 m/s. We measure its position with a precision of 1x10^-6 meters. I need to find the theoretical limit in precision for measuring the speed, which relates to the uncertainty in velocity.

Wait, but the uncertainty principle is between position and momentum. So I should probably start there. Let's jot down the given values.

Mass (m) = 1e3 kg
Speed (v) = 10 m/s (but I'm not sure if this is needed directly)
Position uncertainty (Δx) = 1e-6 m

I need to find the uncertainty in velocity (Δv). Since momentum p = m*v, the uncertainty in momentum Δp would be m*Δv, assuming that the uncertainty in mass is negligible (which it is, because mass is known exactly here).

So the Heisenberg equation is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π). I can plug in the known values here. First, I need Planck's constant. I remember h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

Let me write down the equation:

Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π)

But Δp is m * Δv, so substituting that in:

Δx * m * Δv ≥ h/(4π)

I need to solve for Δv. So rearranging the equation:

Δv ≥ h/(4π * Δx * m)

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34
Δx = 1e-6 m
m = 1e3 kg

So let's compute the denominator first: 4π * 1e-6 * 1e3.

4π is approximately 12.566. Then 1e-6 *1e3 is 0.001 (since 1e-6 *1e3 = 1e-3). So 12.566 * 0.001 = 0.012566.

So denominator is 0.012566.

Now, h is 6.626e-34. So 6.626e-34 / 0.012566 = ?

Let me calculate that. 6.626e-34 divided by approximately 0.012566.

6.626 / 0.012566 ≈ let's see. 0.012566 is about 1/79.58, so 6.626 * 79.58 ≈ 527.3.

So 6.626e-34 / 0.012566 ≈ 527.3e-34 → which is 5.273e-32 m/s.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.

Compute 4π: 4 * 3.1416 = 12.5664.

Δx * m = 1e-6 * 1e3 = 1e-3 kg·m.

So denominator = 12.5664 * 1e-3 = 0.0125664.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but I'll use 6.626e-34).

So 6.626e-34 / 0.0125664 = ?

Let me write it as 6.626 / 0.0125664 = ?

Calculate 6.626 / 0.0125664.

0.0125664 is roughly 1.25664e-2.

6.626 / 0.0125664 ≈ Let's compute 6.626 ÷ 0.0125664.

Dividing 6.626 by 0.0125664. Let me do it numerically.

0.0125664 goes into 6.626 how many times?

0.0125664 * 527 = approx 527 * 0.0125664.

Let me compute 527 * 0.0125664.

527 * 0.01 = 5.27

527 * 0.0025664 = let's see. 0.002 is 1.054, 0.0005664 is 527*0.0005664 ≈ 0.298.

So 5.27 + 1.054 + 0.298 ≈ 6.622, which is close to 6.626.

So 527 times 0.0125664 is about 6.622, so 527 gives us roughly 6.622e-34, but wait, no, wait: sorry, let me clarify.

Wait, no, because 6.626 is in the numerator. Wait, in the equation, it's (6.626e-34) / (0.0125664) = (6.626 / 0.0125664) * 1e-34.

So 6.626 / 0.0125664 is approximately 527.3.

So 6.626e-34 / 0.0125664 = 527.3e-34 = 5.273e-32.

So Δv ≥ 5.273e-32 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.3e-32, which is the closest.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 6.626e-34 / (4π * Δx * m) again.

Wait, 4πΔx m = 4 * π * 1e-6 m * 1e3 kg.

Compute 4π: 12.566370614.

Then 1e-6 *1e3 = 1e-3.

So 12.566370614 * 1e-3 = 0.012566370614.

So 6.626e-34 / 0.012566370614 = ?

Calculate 6.626 / 0.01256637 = approximately 527.3.

Wait, let me compute 6.626 / 0.01256637 precisely.

Let me do this division step by step.

0.01256637 goes into 6.626 how many times?

0.01256637 * 527 = ?

0.01256637 * 500 = 6.283185.

0.01256637 *27 = approx 0.33964.

So total is 6.283185 + 0.33964 = 6.622825.

Which is very close to 6.626.

So 527 times gives 6.622825, which is 6.622825.

The difference is 6.626 -6.622825 = 0.003175.

So 0.003175 / 0.01256637 ≈ 0.2527.

So 527 + 0.2527 ≈ 527.2527.

So approximately 527.253.

So 527.253e-34 → wait no, because the division gives us 527.253, so 6.626e-34 / 0.01256637 = (6.626 / 0.01256637) * 1e-34 = 527.253 *1e-34 = 5.27253e-32 m/s.

So approximately 5.27e-32 m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.3e-32, which is the closest to 5.27e-32. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh, option C is 7.3e-32, so no, A is the correct one.

To determine the theoretical limit in precision for measuring the speed of the car, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}
\]

Here, \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position, \( \Delta p \) is the uncertainty in momentum, and \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( h \approx 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). Since momentum \( p = m \cdot v \), the uncertainty in momentum can be expressed as \( \Delta p = m \cdot \Delta v \), where \( m \) is the mass of the car and \( \Delta v \) is the uncertainty in velocity. Substituting this into the uncertainty principle gives:

\[
\Delta x \cdot m \cdot \Delta v \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}
\]

Rearranging for \( \Delta v \):

\[
\Delta v \geq \frac{h}{4\pi \cdot \Delta x \cdot m}
\]

The given values are:
- \( m = 1 \times 10^3 \, \text{kg} \),
- \( \Delta x = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \),
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
4\pi \cdot \Delta x \cdot m = 4\pi \cdot (1 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (1 \times 10^3) = 4\pi \cdot 10^{-3} \approx 12.566 \cdot 10^{-3} = 0.012566
\]

Now, calculate \( \Delta v \):

\[
\Delta v \geq \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{0.012566} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{m/s}
\]

Thus, the theoretical limit in precision for measuring the speed of the car is approximately \( 5.3 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{m/s} \).

Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:

**A: \( 5.3 \times 10^{-32} \, \text{m/s} \)**.
