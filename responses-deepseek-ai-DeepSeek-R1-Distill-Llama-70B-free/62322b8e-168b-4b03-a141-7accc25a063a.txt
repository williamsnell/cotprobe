Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out which statement is false. Let's see. The question is about the war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo. I remember these trials were after World War II, but let me go through each option carefully.

First, the options are labeled A through H. I'll go one by one.

Option A: The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after the First World War. Hmm, wait a second. I thought the Nuremberg Trials were after WWII, not WWI. So this might be false because the First World War ended in 1918, and the trials I remember were in the mid-1940s.

Option B: The war crimes trials found that "superior orders" could not be used as a defense for war crimes or crimes against humanity. I think this is correct. The Nuremberg Trials established that following orders isn't a valid excuse for committing such crimes. So B is true.

Option C: The trials introduced 'crime against humanity' as an offense. I believe this is true. The Nuremberg Trials were the first to prosecute crimes against humanity, setting a precedent.

Option D: The trials were held after WWII but before the creation of the UN. Wait, when was the UN created? I think the UN was established in 1945, right? The Nuremberg Trials started in 1945 as well, but the main trials were in 1946. So maybe after the UN was created. If the UN was created before the trials, then D would be false. Wait, the UN Charter came into effect in October 1945, and the Nuremberg Trials began in November 1945. So technically, the trials were after the UN's creation. So D would be false because the trials were after the UN was created. But let me check other options.

Option E: The trials were conducted by the United Nations. I don't think so. The Nuremberg Trials were conducted by the Allied powers, specifically the four main ones: US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union. The UN as an organization wasn't directly conducting them, I believe. So E is false. But wait, D and E could both be false. Let me keep going.

Option F: The trials took place in the US. No, the Nuremberg Trials were in Nuremberg, Germany, and Tokyo Trials in Japan. So F is definitely false. But I thought the question is about which one is false, but perhaps only one is the correct answer.

Option G: The trials did not include the crime of genocide. I remember that the concept of genocide was introduced around that time. Wait, the term 'genocide' was coined during the Nuremberg Trials, but was it part of the charges? Or was it added later in other conventions? Hmm. The Genocide Convention was adopted in 1948. So maybe the Nuremberg Trials didn't include genocide as a crime. So G would be true because they didn't include it, making the statement correct.

Option H: The trials held individuals responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Yes, that's correct. They established individual responsibility.

So now, back to the options. The question is which statement is false.

Option A: Trials after WWI? No, after WWII, so A is false.

Option D: Trials after WWII but before UN creation? No, because UN was created in 1945 and trials started same year. So D is false.

Option E: Conducted by UN? No, so E is false.

Option F: Trials in US? No, so F is false.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false. So I need to check each option carefully.

Let me clarify:

- A: Incorrect because Nuremberg and Tokyo trials were after WWII, not WWI.

- D: UN was created in 1945, trials started same year. So the statement says they were held after WWII but before the UN was created. But the UN was already in place when the trials started. So D is incorrect.

- E: Trials conducted by UN? No, by the Allies. So E is incorrect.

- F: Trials in US? No, in Germany and Japan. So F is incorrect.

Wait, so multiple options are false. But the question says "which one is false," implying only one is incorrect. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which statement is false, so the other options are true except one.

But I need to identify the false statement.

Option A says the trials took place immediately after the First World War. That's incorrect because they were after WWII. So A is false.

Option E says the trials were conducted by the UN. I don't think so; the Allies conducted them, not the UN. So E is false.

Option F says the trials were in the US, which is wrong.

Option D: Trials after WWII but before UN creation. But UN was created before the main trials started. So D is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out facts.

1. Nuremberg Trials: November 1945 to October 1946.

2. Tokyo Trials: May 1946 to November 1948.

3. United Nations was established on October 24, 1945, when 29 nations ratified the charter.

So the Nuremberg Trials started in November 1945, after the UN was created. So D's statement that the trials were held after WWII but before the UN's creation is false because the UN was already created. So D is false.

E: The trials were conducted by the UN. No, the Allies conducted them. So E is false.

Which one is the false statement in the options given?

The question is which statement is false.

Looking back, the options are A to H.

The correct answer should be A, because the trials were after WWII, not WWI.

But wait, the question asks which is false, meaning the other statements are true except one.

Wait, let's go through each option.

Option A: Trials after WWI? No, so A is false.

Option B: Correct, superior orders not a defense.

Option C: Correct, crime against humanity introduced.

Option D: Incorrect, because UN was created before trials started.

Option E: Incorrect, trials not conducted by UN.

Option F: Incorrect, trials not in US.

Option G: Correct, genocide wasn't part of the charges.

Option H: Correct, individual responsibility.

So the possible false statements are A, D, E, F.

But the question is which one is false. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, the question might have only one incorrect statement.

Wait, the question is which statement is false.

Looking again, the question is which one is false.

So perhaps the correct answer is A because it incorrectly states the trials were after WWI.

Alternatively, let me check each statement.

A: Incorrect, trials after WWII.

B: Correct.

C: Correct.

D: Incorrect.

E: Incorrect.

F: Incorrect.

G: Correct.

H: Correct.

So the question is which statement is false. So multiple are false, but perhaps only one is the intended answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which one is false, and the other options are true.

Looking again, the possible false statements are A, D, E, F.

But the options are presented as possible answers, so perhaps I need to pick the one that is definitely false.

Wait, the question is which statement is false. Since the other options are true, only one is false.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, option A says the trials took place immediately after the First World War. That's definitely wrong because they were after WWII. So A is false.

Option E says the trials were conducted by the UN. That's also wrong. So which of these is the correct answer?

Wait, the question is which is false, so the correct answer is the false statement.

But the given options are A through H, and the user is to select the false one.

So perhaps the intended answer is A, because it's a clear error regarding the war.

But wait, option F says the trials took place in the US. That's also wrong because they were in Germany and Japan.

But I think the most incorrect statement is A, because it's about the wrong war.

So the false statements are A, D, E, F.

But the answer options are from A to J, but the options given are A to H.

Wait, the options are A to H, so the possible answers are A to H.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is A, because it's a clear error regarding the time period.

Alternatively, the question is from a textbook, so perhaps the intended answer is A.

Wait, but what about option E? The trials were conducted by the UN. That's definitely wrong. The Allies conducted them, so E is false.

But the question is asking which statement is false, and perhaps more than one is false, but the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is false because the trials were held after the creation of the UN.

Wait, so D says the trials were after WWII but before the UN was created. But the UN was created in Oct 1945, and the trials started in Nov 1945, so D is incorrect. So D is false.

So D is a false statement.

Wait, but then option D is a false statement, making it the answer.

But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's the most glaring error.

Wait, let me think again.

The Nuremberg Trials were after WWII, so option A is false.

Option D says trials were after WWII but before UN creation. But the UN was established in October 1945, and the trials started in November 1945. So the trials were after the UN's creation, making D's statement false.

So D is false.

Option E says the trials were conducted by the UN. That's false because it was the Allies who conducted them.

So E is also false.

So which one is the correct answer?

The question is which statement is false. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the most clearly false statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, because the trials were in Germany and Japan, not the US.

But the question is about which is false.

Wait, perhaps I should list each option's validity.

A: False.

B: True.

C: True.

D: False.

E: False.

F: False.

G: True.

H: True.

So the false statements are A, D, E, F.

But the question is which one is false, so the correct answer is one of these.

But the given options are A through H, so it's possible that the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that only one is false, but I'm getting multiple.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's the first option, and the most obviously incorrect.

But I'm a bit torn between A and E.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the creation of the UN. The UN was established in 1945, before the Nuremberg Trials began in November 1945. So the trials were after the UN was created, making option D's statement false because it claims the trials were before the UN was created.

So D is false.

But option E says the trials were conducted by the UN, which is also false.

So which one is the correct answer to the question.

The question is which statement is false.

The options are A to H, so the answer could be any of them.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A: Trials after WWI. Definitely false.

D: Trials after WWII but before UN. False, because UN was created in 1945, same year as the trials started.

E: Conducted by UN. False.

F: Trials in US. False.

So four options are false. But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the Genocide Convention was after Nuremberg, so option G is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because it's an easy mistake.

Wait, the Tokyo Trials were in Japan, Nuremberg in Germany, so F is definitely false.

But the question is which is false, so maybe F is the correct answer.

Alternatively, the intended answer is A.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's clearly wrong regarding the time period.

But other options are also wrong.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is A.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the answer is A because the trials were after WWII, making A false.

So I'll go with A as the false statement.

To determine which statement is false, each option is analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Claims the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials took place immediately after the First World War. This is false because the trials occurred after the Second World War, not the First.

- **Option B**: States that "superior orders" could not be used as a defense for war crimes or crimes against humanity. This is true, as the Nuremberg Trials established this principle.

- **Option C**: Asserts that the trials introduced "crime against humanity" as an offense. This is true, as the Nuremberg Trials were the first to prosecute crimes against humanity.

- **Option D**: Claims the trials were held after WWII but before the creation of the United Nations. This is false because the UN was established in October 1945, and the Nuremberg Trials began in November 1945, after the UN's creation.

- **Option E**: States that the trials were conducted by the United Nations. This is false, as the trials were conducted by the Allied powers, not the UN.

- **Option F**: Claims the trials took place in the United States. This is false because the Nuremberg Trials were held in Germany, and the Tokyo Trials were held in Japan.

- **Option G**: States that the trials did not include the crime of genocide. This is true because the concept of genocide was not part of the charges at the time, though it was later recognized in the 1948 Genocide Convention.

- **Option H**: Asserts that the trials held individuals legally responsible for acts such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. This is true, as the trials established individual responsibility for such acts.

While multiple options (A, D, E, F) are false, the most glaring and straightforward false statement is **Option A**, as it incorrectly associates the trials with the First World War instead of the Second World War.

**Answer: A**
