Question:

A male bacterium conjugates with a female bacterium. After conjugation, the female becomes a male. Account for this "sexchange".

Options:

A: The female bacterium becomes a male as a result of nutrient deficiency
B: The female becomes a male by receiving one copy of the F factor
C: The female bacterium becomes a male through the process of osmosis
D: The female bacterium becomes a male through gene mutation
E: The female bacterium becomes a male after receiving multiple copies of non-F factor genes
F: The female bacterium becomes a male through binary fission
G: The female bacterium becomes a male by incorporating a plasmid unrelated to the F factor
H: The female bacterium becomes a male after exposure to antibiotics
I: The female bacterium becomes a male due to a viral infection
J: The female bacterium becomes a male due to environmental factors

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about bacterial conjugation. So, the question is: A male bacterium conjugates with a female bacterium, and after that, the female becomes a male. I need to explain why this "sex change" happens.

Alright, I remember that in bacterial conjugation, the male bacteria have something called the F factor. The F factor is a plasmid, which is a circular piece of DNA separate from the bacterial chromosome. This plasmid allows the male bacteria to transfer genetic material to the female.

So, the male has the F plasmid, which includes genes for the sex pilus and the ability to transfer DNA. The female doesn't have this F factor, so she can't initiate conjugation on her own. When they conjugate, the male transfers the F plasmid to the female.

Wait, but after conjugation, the female becomes a male. So, why does that happen? Well, if the female receives the F factor, she would then have it. Since having the F factor makes a bacterium male, she becomes a male. So the transfer of the F plasmid makes the female into a male.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the female becomes male by receiving one copy of the F factor. That makes sense because once she gets the F plasmid, she can now act as a male.

Option E talks about multiple copies of non-F genes, which doesn't seem right. The F factor is the key here.

Option G mentions a plasmid unrelated to F, which wouldn't confer maleness. So G is out.

Other options like nutrient deficiency or environmental factors (A and J) don't directly relate to the genetic transfer. Mutation (D) is unlikely because this is a standard process in conjugation, not a random mutation.

So the correct answer should be B.

The "sex change" in bacteria during conjugation occurs because the female bacterium receives the F factor, a plasmid, from the male bacterium. The F factor is a circular DNA molecule that confers maleness by enabling the bacterium to initiate conjugation. When the female bacterium receives this plasmid, it gains the ability to act as a male, hence undergoing this transformation.

**Option Analysis:**

- **B**: Correct. The female becomes a male by receiving the F factor, which is essential for male characteristics.
- **E**: Incorrect. The transfer of multiple non-F factor genes is unrelated to the sex change.
- **G**: Incorrect. A plasmid unrelated to the F factor would not confer maleness.
- **A, J**: Incorrect. Nutrient deficiency or environmental factors do not directly cause the sex change.
- **D**: Incorrect. This is not a result of random mutation but a genetic transfer.
- **C, F, H, I**: Incorrect. Osmosis, binary fission, antibiotics, or viral infection are unrelated to this process.

**Answer: B**
