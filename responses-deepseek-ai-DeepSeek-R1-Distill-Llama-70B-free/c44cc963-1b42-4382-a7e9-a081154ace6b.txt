Okay, so I've got this question about inventory turnover for Kane's Record Store. Hmm, let me think. I remember that inventory turnover is a measure of how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory in a given period. The formula, I think, is cost of goods sold divided by the average inventory.

Wait, but the question gives me beginning inventory, purchases, and ending inventory. So I need to find the cost of goods sold first, right? Because the formula requires that.

Starting with the beginning inventory, which is $16,000. Then they made purchases of $58,000. So the total available for sale would be beginning inventory plus purchases. That's 16k + 58k = $74,000. 

But then, the ending inventory is $14,000. So the cost of goods sold must be the total available minus ending inventory. So 74k minus 14k gives me $60,000. 

Now, average inventory. That's probably (beginning inventory + ending inventory) divided by 2. So (16k +14k)/2 = 30k/2 = $15,000. 

Wait wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, sometimes average inventory is calculated differently. Oh right, because purchases are made over the period, the average inventory might be based on beginning plus ending divided by two. Yeah, that makes sense. So that's 30k/2 = 15k.

So now, the formula: inventory turnover = COGS / average inventory. COGS is 60k, average is 15k. So 60k /15k = 4 times. So the rate is 4 times.

Looking at the options, option A is 4 times. So the answer should be A.

To calculate the inventory turnover rate for Kane's Record Store, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
\]

1. **Calculate COGS**:  
   COGS is determined by subtracting ending inventory from the total inventory available for sale:  
   \[
   \text{COGS} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{COGS} = \$16,000 + \$58,000 - \$14,000 = \$60,000
   \]

2. **Calculate Average Inventory**:  
   Average inventory is the average of beginning and ending inventory:  
   \[
   \text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Ending Inventory}}{2}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\$16,000 + \$14,000}{2} = \$15,000
   \]

3. **Calculate Inventory Turnover**:  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\$60,000}{\$15,000} = 4 \text{ times}
   \]

Thus, the inventory turnover rate is **4 times**, which corresponds to option **A**.

**Answer: A**
