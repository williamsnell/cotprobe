Question:

On November 1, Beeson contracted to purchase from Sloan for $250,000 certain property located in the City of La Mirada. In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because

Options:

A: legal title remained in Sloan.
B: The property's value decreased substantially due to the rezoning.
C: Sloan failed to disclose potential rezoning risks.
D: Beeson had not yet paid the full purchase price.
E: The contract was not legally binding.
F: Sloan assumed the risk.
G: equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.
H: Sloan would be unjustly enriched.
I: The city council's decision was unforeseeable.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with real estate transactions and the doctrine of equitable conversion. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. So, Beeson contracted to buy property from Sloan for $250,000. The contract was made on November 1, with a deposit of $12,500 and the balance due on December 1. The purpose was to build a commercial shopping mall. Then, on November 24, the city council rezoned the property for single-family residential use. Because of this, Beeson refuses to go through with the contract. Sloan is suing for specific performance, arguing that under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the loss falls on the buyer, Beeson. Beeson counters that enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive.

The question is why judgment would be for Beeson, meaning the court sides with him. So, I need to think about the legal principles here.

From what I remember, the doctrine of equitable conversion applies once a contract for the sale of land is made. Under this doctrine, the risk of loss for the property shifts to the buyer, even though the seller still holds legal title. So, if something happens to the property after the contract is signed, like damage or destruction, the buyer bears that loss. That's the risk side of it.

But wait, in this case, the issue is a change in zoning, not physical damage. So, the question is whether such a change affects the application of the doctrine. Sloan is arguing that the doctrine applies, so Beeson has to bear the loss. Beeson is arguing that it's too harsh to enforce the contract.

So, the possible defenses Beeson might have could include impossibility, impracticability, or perhaps that the contract shouldn't be specifically enforced because it's unfair.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Legal title remained in Sloan. But under equitable conversion, the buyer is treated as the equitable owner, so the seller having legal title doesn't matter much here. The risk is on the buyer regardless.

Option B: The property's value decreased substantially due to rezoning. That makes sense because the intended use (commercial) is now prohibited. So the value would drop. But does that matter? The doctrine of equitable conversion generally places the risk on the buyer. Unless the change is so fundamental that it affects the purpose of the contract.

Option C: Sloan failed to disclose potential rezoning risks. I don't see any mention of that in the facts. The question doesn't state that Sloan knew about possible rezoning and didn't tell Beeson. So this might not be applicable.

Option D: Beeson had not yet paid the full purchase price. But under the doctrine, payment isn't the issue; the risk is on the buyer once the contract is made. So this doesn't seem relevant.

Option E: The contract was not legally binding. But the contract was formed, deposit paid, so it seems binding unless there's an issue like mistake or impossibility. But nothing indicates the contract wasn't legally binding at the start.

Option F: Sloan assumed the risk. Wait, no, under the doctrine, the risk is on the buyer. So this might not be the right reason.

Option G: Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain. Equitable relief, like specific performance, is granted when it's just and fair. If enforcing the contract would be harsh, the court might refuse specific performance. Even if the contract is valid, courts can refuse specific performance if it's unfair.

Option H: Sloan would be unjustly enriched. I'm not sure how that applies here. If Beeson doesn't perform, Sloan might have to sell the property again, perhaps at a lower price, but I don't see how Sloan being enriched comes into play.

Option I: The city council's decision was unforeseeable. Unforeseeability can play into impossibility or impracticability, but rezoning is a known risk in real estate. Unless it was a completely unexpected change, but that's not stated. I'm not sure this is the main reason.

So, putting it together: Sloan is suing for specific performance, relying on equitable conversion. Beeson argues it's harsh. The court might side with Beeson if enforcing the contract would be unfair. Even if the doctrine places the risk on him, the court can exercise discretion in equity to refuse specific performance if it's harsh.

So, the judgment would be for Beeson because the court finds that enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive, so equity relieves him. That points to option G: equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.

Alternatively, option B says the property's value decreased. But the decrease in value alone might not be sufficient if the risk was on Beeson. Unless the change in value is so drastic that it makes the contract unconscionable. But the question frames Beeson's argument as harsh and oppressive, which aligns with option G.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The question revolves around a real estate transaction and the doctrine of equitable conversion. Beeson contracted to buy property from Sloan for $250,000, intending to build a commercial shopping mall. After the contract was signed, the property was rezoned for single-family residential use, making Beeson's intended purpose impossible. Sloan seeks specific performance, arguing that under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk of loss falls on the buyer. Beeson argues that enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Legal title remaining with Sloan is irrelevant under the doctrine of equitable conversion, as the buyer bears the risk regardless of legal title.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the property's value likely decreased due to rezoning, the doctrine of equitable conversion generally places the risk on the buyer. A decrease in value alone does not necessarily make enforcement harsh.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no evidence in the facts that Sloan failed to disclose potential rezoning risks.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The doctrine of equitable conversion applies regardless of whether the full purchase price has been paid.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The contract appears legally binding, as there is no indication of issues like mistake or impossibility at the time of formation.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the risk is on the buyer, not the seller.
- **Option G**: Correct. Courts may refuse specific performance if enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive. This aligns with Beeson's argument that enforcement would be unfair given the unforeseen rezoning.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. There is no indication that Sloan would be unjustly enriched if the contract is not enforced.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Rezoning is a known risk in real estate, and the facts do not suggest the change was unforeseeable.

The most likely reason for judgment in favor of Beeson is that equity will relieve him of a bad bargain due to the harsh and oppressive nature of enforcing the contract after the rezoning.
