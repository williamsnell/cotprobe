Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about carbon dioxide expanding adiabatically. Hmm, I remember that adiabatic processes mean no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. And since it's a reversible process, it's probably using some specific equations.

The problem gives me the initial pressure as 57.4 kPa, and the initial volume is 1.0 dm³. The final volume is 2.0 dm³. Oh wait, and gamma (γ) is 1.4. So I remember that for an adiabatic process, there's this equation relating pressure and volume. Let me think... I think it's something like P1 * V1^γ equals P2 * V2^γ. Oh wait, no, wait. Because when a gas expands adiabatically, both pressure and temperature change. So the formula should be P1 * V1^(-γ) equals P2 * V2^(-γ), but I might be getting the signs wrong. Or maybe it's P1 * V1^γ equals P2 * V2^γ. Wait, no, that can't be right because when volume increases, pressure should decrease.

Wait, wait. Let me get the exact formula. I think the correct relation is P1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ. No, wait, no. Because for an adiabatic process, the relation is TV^(γ-1) = constant and PV^γ = constant. Oh right, so it's P1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's PV^γ equals a constant. So P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ. Yes, that sounds right. So I can use that to find the final pressure.

So the initial state is P1 = 57.4 kPa, V1 = 1.0 dm³, and V2 is 2.0 dm³. Plugging into the equation:

P1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ

So solving for P2:

P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2)^γ

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's rearrange the equation correctly.

P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2)^γ

Wait, no, because P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ --> P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ

Wait, but let's make sure. Let me use exponents correctly.

So (V1/V2) is (1.0 dm³ / 2.0 dm³) = 0.5.

Gamma is 1.4, so (0.5)^1.4. Hmm, I need to compute that.

Wait, 0.5 is 1/2, so (1/2)^1.4. Let me think about how to calculate that. Wait, 1.4 is the same as 14/10 or 7/5. So exponent 1.4 is same as taking the 5th root of (1/2)^7. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute using logarithms or approximate it.

Alternatively, I remember that 2^3 is 8, so 2^0.4 is about 1.3195, because 2^0.4 is approximately 1.3195. Wait, wait, 2^0.3 is about 1.23, 0.4 is higher. Let me think, 2^0.4 ≈ 1.3195. So (1/2)^1.4 is 1/(2^1.4) = 1/(2 * 2^0.4) ) ≈ 1/(2 * 1.3195) ≈ 1 / 2.639 ≈ 0.379.

Wait, but wait another way: natural logarithm approach. Let me calculate ln(0.5) = -ln(2) ≈ -0.6931. Multiply by 1.4: -0.6931 *1.4 ≈ -0.9703. Then exponentiate e^-0.9703 ≈ 0.378. So yes, about 0.378.

So P2 = 57.4 kPa * 0.378 ≈ Let's compute that.

57.4 * 0.378. Hmm, 57 * 0.4 is 22.8, but since it's 0.378, which is slightly less than 0.38.

Wait, 57 * 0.378 = ?

Let me compute 57 * 0.3 = 17.1.

57 * 0.07 = 3.99.

57 * 0.008 = 0.456.

So 17.1 + 3.99 = 21.09, + 0.456 = 21.546.

But wait, perhaps I should compute 57.4 * 0.378.

Alternatively, 57.4 * 0.378.

Hmm, 57.4 * 0.3 is 17.22.

57.4 * 0.07 = 4.018.

57.4 * 0.008 = 0.4592.

Now sum them: 17.22 + 4.018=21.238 + 0.4592=21.6972.

So approximately 21.7 kPa.

Looking at the options, option C is 22 kPa, option G is 20 kPa, and option I is 25 kPa, option B is 28. So our calculation is about 21.7, which is closest to option C (22 kPa) or perhaps option G is 20. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, the formula is P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

Wait, V1 is 1.0 dm³, V2 is 2.0 dm³. So V1/V2 is 0.5.

So 0.5^1.4 is the factor.

Wait, let me compute 0.5^1.4.

Wait, 0.5 is 2^-1.

So (0.5)^1.4 = 2^(-1.4) = 1/(2^1.4).

2^1 =2, 2^0.4=approx 1.3195. So 2^1.4=approx 2 * 1.3195=2.639. So 1/2.639≈0.379.

So yes, that's correct. So 57.4 * 0.379 is approximately 21.7.

So the closest option is C:22 kPa. But wait, the options say C is 22 kPA (with a capital A typo perhaps). But looking at the options:

Options:

A:18 kPa

B:28 kPa

C:22kPA

D:45 kPa

E:40 kPa

F:15kPA

G:20 kPa

H:30kPA

I:25kPA

J:35 kPa

So option C is 22, which would be the closest to our calculation of 21.7.

Wait, but sometimes the formula is written as P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ. So perhaps I should check that again.

Wait, the relation is P V^γ = constant for an adiabatic process.

So P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ.

So P2 = P1 (V1/V2)^γ.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute using the ratio.

So (V1/V2) = 0.5.

So 0.5^gamma where gamma is 1.4.

Wait, but I just did that.

So perhaps the answer is 22, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Is the formula correct for an expansion? Because when the volume increases, pressure should decrease, which matches our calculation (from 57 to ~21). So seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether it's CO2, but the problem says to assume ideal gas behavior, so CO2 being polyatomic wouldn't matter beyond using the correct gamma, which is given as 1.4. So that's fine.

So the correct answer should be option C:22kPa.

To calculate the final pressure of carbon dioxide expanding reversibly and adiabatically, we use the relation for an adiabatic process:

\[
P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(P_2\):

\[
P_2 = P_1 \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^\gamma
\]

Given:
- \(P_1 = 57.4 \, \text{kPa}\),
- \(V_1 = 1.0 \, \text{dm}^3\),
- \(V_2 = 2.0 \, \text{dm}^3\),
- \(\gamma = 1.4\),

we calculate:

1. **Volume ratio**:  
   \[
   \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{1.0}{2.0} = 0.5
   \]

2. **Exponentiation**:  
   \[
   0.5^{1.4} = 2^{-1.4} = \frac{1}{2^{1.4}}
   \]
   Using approximations, \(2^{1.4} \approx 2.639\), so:
   \[
   0.5^{1.4} \approx \frac{1}{2.639} \approx 0.379
   \]

3. **Final pressure**:  
   \[
   P_2 = 57.4 \times 0.379 \approx 21.7 \, \text{kPa}
   \]

The closest option to \(21.7 \, \text{kPa}\) is **22 kPa**, which corresponds to option **C**.

**Critical analysis of options**:
- Option A (18 kPa) is too low.
- Option B (28 kPa) is too high.
- Option C (22 kPa) matches the calculation.
- Option D (45 kPa) is far too high.
- Option E (40 kPa) is also too high.
- Option F (15 kPa) is too low.
- Option G (20 kPa) is close but slightly lower than the calculated value.
- Option H (30 kPa) is too high.
- Option I (25 kPa) is slightly higher than the calculated value.
- Option J (35 kPa) is too high.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: 22 kPa**.
