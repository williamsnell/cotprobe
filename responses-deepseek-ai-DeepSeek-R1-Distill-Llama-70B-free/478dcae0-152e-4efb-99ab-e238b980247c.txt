Okay, so I've got this question about Mars missions, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see, the question is asking which Mars mission landed on May 25, 2008, and dug a trench into ice-rich soil. Hmm, I remember there were several Mars missions around that time, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

First, I'll try to list some of the missions I know. There's the Mars Science Laboratory, which I think is Curiosity Rover. That one landed in 2012, so that's probably not it. Then there's the Mars Odyssey, which I believe was an orbiter, not a lander. Odyssey's been around for a while, maybe launched in the early 2000s.

Then there's Phoenix Mars Lander. I remember hearing about Phoenix because it was looking for water ice. I think it landed in 2008, but wait, was it May? Or was it earlier? I'm not sure. Another mission is the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which I think was more about orbiting and taking high-res images, not landing. So that's probably not it.

Mars Express was a European mission, I think it was an orbiter too. Mars Global Surveyor was an older one, maybe from the 90s. The Mars Exploration Rovers, like Spirit and Opportunity, landed in 2004, so that's too early. ExoMars is a more recent mission, I think it's still ongoing or maybe launched later than 2008.

Wait, MAVEN is another orbiter, right? It studies the atmosphere, and I think it arrived at Mars in 2013. So that's later than 2008. The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is India's mission, and I think that also came later, maybe 2013 or 2014.

So narrowing it down, the Phoenix Mars Lander seems like a good candidate. I remember it was sent to the Martian arctic and it did find ice. The landing date was May 25, 2008, if I'm not mistaken. It had a robotic arm that dug trenches, which matches the question's description.

Wait, but I should double-check the other options to make sure. The Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity) was 2012, so that's out. Mars Odyssey is an orbiter, so no landing. MAVEN is 2013, so no. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is an orbiter too. So the only lander around that time that fits is Phoenix.

Yes, I think the answer is D: Phoenix Mars Lander.

The mission that landed on Mars on May 25, 2008, and dug trenches into ice-rich soil is the Phoenix Mars Lander. This mission was specifically designed to explore the Martian arctic and search for water ice, using a robotic arm to dig into the soil. Other options, such as Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN, were orbiters and not landers. Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity) landed later in 2012, and other missions like ExoMars and Mars Orbiter Mission were launched after 2008. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: D
