Question:

Explain the method of copulation in the earthworms.

Options:

A: Earthworms reproduce asexually by fission.
B: Earthworms engage in internal fertilization where one worm injects sperm directly into the ovaries of the other.
C: Each earthworm fertilizes its own eggs internally without the need for a mate.
D: Earthworms attract mates through airborne pheromones and mate on the surface without physical contact.
E: Earthworms reproduce by budding, where small worms grow out of the parent's body.
F: Earthworms exchange sperm by connecting their posterior ends and then separate to lay fertilized eggs.
G: Earthworms reproduce by external fertilization in water.
H: Earthworms lay eggs without any copulation.
I: Two earthworms unite ventral surface to ventral surface with opposite anterior ends. They discharge sperm into the other's seminal receptacles. After separation, a cocoon is secreted for egg and sperm deposition.
J: Two earthworms connect at their anterior ends and exchange sperm through their mouths before separating to lay eggs independently.

Okay, so I need to figure out how earthworms copulate. I'm a bit rusty on my earthworm biology, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that earthworms are annelids, and they're hermaphroditic. That means each worm has both male and female reproductive organs. But wait, being hermaphroditic doesn't always mean they can fertilize themselves. I think they still need to mate with another worm to exchange sperm.

So the question is about their method of copulation. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Reproduce asexually by fission. No, I'm pretty sure earthworms don't do that. Asexual reproduction by fission is more like what flatworms or some other invertebrates do. Earthworms usually reproduce sexually.

Option B: Internal fertilization where one injects sperm into the other's ovaries. Wait, earthworms have external fertilization, don't they? Or do they? Hmm. I think they might exchange sperm and then each worm uses that sperm to fertilize their own eggs. So maybe it's external. But I'm not certain.

Option C: Each worm fertilizes its own eggs without a mate. That doesn't sound right because they are hermaphroditic but still need cross-fertilization. So each can't just do it alone; they need to mate.

Option D: Attract mates with pheromones and mate on the surface without contact. I don't think so. I recall that earthworms do mate, and they physically connect. So this option might be incorrect.

Option E: Reproduce by budding. No, that's more like yeast or some other organisms. Earthworms don't do that.

Option F: Exchange sperm by connecting posterior ends. Wait, I think they connect their anterior ends. Or maybe the opposite ends? I'm getting a bit confused. Earthworms have a clitellum, which is a glandular section used in reproduction. When they mate, they align their bodies and exchange sperm. So maybe they connect their anterior ends, or maybe the posterior?

Wait, no, I think they align their bodies in opposite directions. So one's head is near the other's tail. Oh wait, no. Because each has both sets of organs, so maybe they align so that their male parts meet the female parts of the other worm.

Option G: External fertilization in water. Hmm, I'm not sure. I know that earthworms are terrestrial and live in moist soil, so they might not need water for fertilization. They might exchange sperm and then each lays eggs with the received sperm, so maybe it's internal fertilization of the eggs.

Option H: Lay eggs without copulation. That can't be right because they do need to mate to exchange sperm. So this option is out.

Option I: Two worms unite ventral to ventral, opposite ends. They discharge sperm into each other's seminal receptacles. Then separate and secrete a cocoon. That sounds familiar. I think this is correct. The ventral surfaces (their undersides) are pressed together, and each deposits sperm into the other. After separating, each worm will use the received sperm to fertilize their eggs, and then they form a cocoon around the fertilized eggs.

Option J: Connect at anterior ends and exchange sperm through mouths. No, I don't think earthworms have mouthparts involved in reproduction. They exchange sperm through their genital openings, which are in the clitellum area, I believe.

So putting it together, option I describes the correct method. Two earthworms press their ventral surfaces together, opposite ends, exchange sperm, then each forms a cocoon to lay eggs.
</think>

Earthworms are hermaphroditic, meaning each individual possesses both male and female reproductive organs. However, they still require mating with another worm to exchange sperm for successful fertilization. During copulation, two earthworms align their bodies ventral surface to ventral surface, with their anterior ends pointing in opposite directions. They then discharge sperm into each other's seminal receptacles. After separating, each worm uses the received sperm to fertilize its eggs and secretes a cocoon to encase the fertilized eggs for development.

The correct answer is **I**.
