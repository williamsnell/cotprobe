Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a capacitor losing its charge over time. Hmm, I remember that capacitors can lose charge, maybe through some kind of discharge process. The question says the capacitor loses half its remaining charge every second. So every second, it's left with half of whatever it had in the previous second.

The problem states that after five seconds, the charge is q. I need to find the initial charge. Let me think about how this works. So it's a half-life problem, I think. Like radioactive decay, where the substance decays by a certain fraction in a certain time.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the initial charge as Q. After each second, the charge becomes half of what it was. So after one second, it's Q/2. After two seconds, (Q/2)/2 = Q/4. After three, Q/8, four seconds Q/16, and after five seconds, Q/32.

Wait, because each time it halves, so each step is multiplying by 1/2. So after n seconds, the charge is Q * (1/2)^n.

The problem says that after five seconds, the charge is q. So, substituting n=5, we get:

q = Q * (1/2)^5

Let me compute (1/2)^5. 1/2 to the fifth power is 1/32. So,

q = Q * (1/32)

I need to solve for Q. So,

Q = q * 32

So the initial charge is 32 times q. Looking at the options, option I is 32q. So the answer should be I.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the math. Each second, the charge halves. So after 1s: Q/2, 2s: Q/4, 3s: Q/8, 4s: Q/16, 5s: Q/32. Yes, so Q = 32 q.

Yes, so the correct answer is I: 32q.

To determine the initial charge of the capacitor, we recognize that the charge decreases by half every second. Let the initial charge be \( Q \). After \( n \) seconds, the charge \( q \) is given by:

\[
q = Q \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n
\]

The problem specifies that after \( n = 5 \) seconds, the charge is \( q \). Substituting these values:

\[
q = Q \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5
\]

Simplifying \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32} \), we have:

\[
q = Q \cdot \frac{1}{32}
\]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[
Q = q \cdot 32
\]

Thus, the initial charge is \( 32q \), which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
