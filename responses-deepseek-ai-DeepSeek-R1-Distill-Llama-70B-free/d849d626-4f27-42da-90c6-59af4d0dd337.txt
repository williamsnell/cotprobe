Okay, so I have this question about insurance and how losses are distributed between two companies. Let me see if I can figure this out.

The scenario is that Adams Manufacturing had a fire loss of $45,000. They have two insurance policies: one with Acme Insurance for $50,000 and another with Safe Way Insurance for $30,000. I need to determine how much each insurance company paid towards the loss.

Hmm, I remember something about insurance policies and how they might split the payment. I think it's called something like pro-rata or something similar. Oh right, when there are multiple insurance policies covering the same risk, the loss is usually shared among the insurers in proportion to their policy limits.

Wait, so the total insurance coverage here is the sum of both policies. Acme has a $50k policy and Safe Way has $30k. So the total coverage is 50,000 + 30,000 = $80,000.

But wait, the loss is only $45,000. So the companies can't pay more than their policy, but in this case, since the loss is less than the total coverage, each company pays a portion of the loss based on their share of the total coverage.

So the proportion for Acme would be 50,000 / 80,000. And for Safe Way, it's 30,000 / 80,000.

Let me calculate that. 50k over 80k is 5/8, which is 0.625. And 30k over 80k is 3/8, which is 0.375.

So the loss is $45,000. So Acme would pay 45,000 multiplied by 5/8. Let me compute that: 45,000 * 0.625. Hmm, 45 * 0.625 is 28.125, so 28.125 thousand dollars. So Acme pays $28,125.

Then Safe Way would pay the remaining, which is 45,000 - 28,125 = 16,875. Alternatively, 45,000 * 0.375 = 16,875.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches these numbers. Let's glance through the options.

Option D says Acme: $28,125 and Safe: $16,875. That's exactly what I got.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, if the total insurance is more than the loss, each company's payment is the proportion of their policy relative to the total. So yes, that's what I did.

Alternatively, if the loss exceeded the total, each would pay up to their policy, but in this case, the loss is less than the total coverage, so it's a pro-rata share.

So the correct option should be D.

The Adams Manufacturing Company suffered a fire loss of $45,000, covered by two insurance policies: Acme Insurance ($50,000) and Safe Way Insurance ($30,000). To determine how much each insurer pays, the loss is split proportionally based on their policy limits.

1. **Total Insurance Coverage**: $50,000 (Acme) + $30,000 (Safe Way) = $80,000.
2. **Proportional Shares**:
   - Acme's share: \( \frac{50,000}{80,000} = \frac{5}{8} = 0.625 \).
   - Safe Way's share: \( \frac{30,000}{80,000} = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375 \).
3. **Payment Calculation**:
   - Acme pays: \( 45,000 \times 0.625 = 28,125 \).
   - Safe Way pays: \( 45,000 \times 0.375 = 16,875 \).

The correct option is **D: Acme Insurance - $28,125, Safe Way Insurance - $16,875**.
