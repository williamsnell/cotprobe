Question:

It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.

Options:

A: Neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals traveling towards the dendrites only.
B: The receptors for neurotransmitters are only found on the axonal terminals.
C: The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only.
D: The synaptic vesicle is present inside the dendrites of a neuron.
E: The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.
F: The neurotransmitter degrades immediately upon release and cannot travel to the axon.
G: The dendrites actively pump the neurotransmitter back to the axon after it has been received.
H: The neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end of a neuron only.
I: The dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect of the axonal neurotransmitter.
J: The neurotransmitter can travel in both directions.

Okay, so I have this question about why chemical transmission at a synapse is unidirectional, meaning the neurotransmitter only goes from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that neurons communicate through synapses, and the direction matters here.

Wait, why can't it go the other way? Let me think. So the presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, and then the postsynaptic neuron has receptors to catch them. Oh right, the receptors are only on the postsynaptic side. That makes sense because if the receptors were on both sides, the signal could go backwards.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. Option A says neurotransmitters are released because of signals going towards the dendrites. No, I think the release is triggered by the action potential arriving at the axon terminals, not dendrites. Plus, the signal direction is about where the release happens, not why it's unidirectional.

Option B claims receptors are only on axonal terminals. Wait, no. Axonal terminals are the ones releasing the neurotransmitters. The receptors should be on the dendrites of the next neuron. So B is incorrect.

Option C says neurotransmitters are present only in the axonal end. Oh, right! The presynaptic neuron has vesicles filled with neurotransmitters in its axon terminals. The postsynaptic neuron doesn't store them because it's the receiver. So this could be a reason. If the dendrite doesn't have the neurotransmitters, they can't send signals back.

Option D says synaptic vesicles are in dendrites. No, I'm pretty sure vesicles are in the axon terminals. So D is wrong.

Option E says axon terminals can't release neurotransmitters. No, that's the opposite of what happens. The axon terminals do release them, so E is wrong.

Option F: Neurotransmitters degrade immediately. I don't think that's the main reason. They do get broken down, but that's after transmission. The direction is more about where they're released and where the receptors are.

Option G: Dendrites pump neurotransmitters back. I haven't heard of that. Once neurotransmitters bind, they either get broken down or reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron, I think. But that doesn't explain the unidirectional transmission.

Option H: Neurotransmitter only in dendrites. No, that's the opposite. The presynaptic axon has them.

Option I: Dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. I don't think so. Each synapse uses specific neurotransmitters, but that doesn't directly explain the direction.

Option J: Can travel both ways. No, because the setup doesn't allow it. So J is wrong.

So putting it together, the main reasons are that neurotransmitters are stored in the axon terminals (option C) and the receptors are on the dendrites (which isn't directly one of the options, but C is about the presence of the neurotransmitter). Wait, no, looking at the options again, none directly mention receptors. Oh wait, perhaps C is the correct answer because if the neurotransmitters are only in the axon, they can't be released from the dendrite side. That would prevent the reverse transmission. So the transmission is unidirectional because the source is only on one side.

The unidirectional nature of chemical transmission at a synapse is due to the specific structural and functional organization of neurons. Neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles located at the axonal terminals of the presynaptic neuron. When an action potential reaches these terminals, the vesicles release the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The postsynaptic neuron, which has dendrites containing receptors for these neurotransmitters, receives the signal. This setup ensures that neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals and act on the dendrites, preventing reverse transmission. Among the options provided, the most accurate explanation is that neurotransmitters are present in the axonal end of a neuron only, which ensures the unidirectional flow of signals.
