Okay, so I have this question about protective tariffs on imported steel, and I need to figure out the correct consequence. Hmm, I remember that tariffs are taxes on imported goods, right? So a protective tariff is meant to protect domestic industries by making imported goods more expensive.

Let me think about each option one by one. 

Option A says domestic steel producers lose revenue. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the tariff makes imported steel more expensive, people would buy more domestic steel. So domestic producers should gain revenue, not lose it. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Allocative efficiency is improved. Allocative efficiency means resources are used to produce what consumers value most. But tariffs distort the market because they artificially raise prices. So this might lead to inefficiency because domestic producers don't have as much incentive to innovate or reduce costs. So B might not be correct.

Option C: It results in a decrease in domestic steel production. No, that doesn't make sense. With the tariff, domestic producers can charge higher prices because imports are more expensive. So they should produce more, not less. So C is wrong.

Option D: Income is transferred from consumers to domestic producers. Oh, right, because the price of steel goes up due to the tariff. Consumers pay more, so the extra money goes to the domestic companies. So D sounds right.

Option E: Domestic steel prices fall. No, the tariff would make steel prices go up because imports are pricier, so domestic producers can raise their prices without losing customers. So E is wrong.

Option F: Net exports fall. Hmm, wait. If the country imposes a tariff on steel imports, other countries might retaliate by imposing tariffs on our exports. That could reduce our exports, which would lower net exports. But does it directly cause F? Or is it about net exports of steel? I'm not sure. Maybe F isn't the primary effect.

Option G: The quality of domestic steel decreases. I'm not sure about this. Tariffs can lead to less competition, so domestic firms might not innovate as much, possibly affecting quality. But is that a direct consequence? I think D is more directly related.

Option H: Foreign steel producers gain market share. No, the opposite. With tariffs, their steel is more expensive, so they lose market share to domestic producers. So H is wrong.

Option I: Income transferred from domestic to foreign producers. No, the tariff is on imports, so domestic producers gain. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Encourages foreign trade partnerships. I don't think so. Tariffs might lead to trade tensions, not partnerships. So J is unlikely.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: Income is transferred from domestic steel consumers to domestic steel producers.

The consequence of a protective tariff on imported steel is that it makes imported steel more expensive, leading consumers to buy more domestic steel. This results in higher prices for domestic steel, causing income to shift from consumers to domestic producers. 

- **A**: Incorrect. Domestic producers gain revenue due to higher prices.
- **B**: Incorrect. Tariffs distort the market, reducing allocative efficiency.
- **C**: Incorrect. Domestic production increases as domestic firms face less competition.
- **D**: Correct. Higher prices transfer income from consumers to domestic producers.
- **E**: Incorrect. Prices rise, not fall.
- **F**: Unlikely. While possible, it's not the primary effect.
- **G**: Possible but not the most direct consequence.
- **H**: Incorrect. Foreign producers lose market share.
- **I**: Incorrect. Income flows to domestic, not foreign, producers.
- **J**: Incorrect. Tariffs can strain trade relations.

Answer: D
