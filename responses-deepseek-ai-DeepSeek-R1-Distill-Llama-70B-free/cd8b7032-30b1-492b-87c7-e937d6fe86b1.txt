Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of [sin(3t) * sin(t/π)] divided by t squared, dt. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let's see if I can break it down.

First off, I remember that when dealing with integrals involving products of sine functions, there's a product-to-sum identity that might help. Oh right, the identity is sin(A) * sin(B) equals [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)] divided by 2. So maybe I can apply that here.

Let me rewrite the numerator using that identity. So sin(3t) * sin(t/π) becomes [cos(3t - t/π) - cos(3t + t/π)] divided by 2. That simplifies the product into a difference of cosines, which might be easier to handle.

So now the integral becomes (1/2) times the integral of [cos((3 - 1/π)t) - cos((3 + 1/π)t)] divided by t squared, dt, from -∞ to +∞. Hmm, integrating each term separately might be the way to go.

Wait, but integrating cosine terms over t squared... I'm trying to remember if there's a standard integral formula that fits this. Oh right! I think the integral of cos(kt)/t² dt from -infinity to infinity is something involving the delta function or maybe relates to the Fourier transform. Wait, perhaps I should think about the Fourier transform of 1/t². Or maybe use integration by parts.

Alternatively, I recall that the Fourier transform of 1/t² might not be straightforward, but perhaps there's another approach. Let me think about the integral ∫ [cos(kt)] / t² dt. Hmm, wait, maybe I can express 1/t² as an integral of some function. Oh, right! I think 1/t² is related to the integral of e^{-s t²} or something similar, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I can use the concept of Fourier transforms here. Because the integral is from -infty to infty, which often shows up in Fourier transforms. The function here is [cos(a t)] / t². So if I can find the Fourier transform of 1/t², then I can plug in a and find the value.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the Fourier transform of 1/t². Alternatively, maybe I should consider integrating by parts. Let's see: Let u = cos(kt), dv = dt/t². Then du = -k sin(kt) dt, and v = -1/t. So integration by parts gives uv evaluated from -infty to +infty minus the integral of v du.

Hmm, but when I plug in the limits, [ -cos(kt)/t ] from -infty to +infty. But as t approaches ±infty, cos(kt) oscillates between -1 and 1, and 1/t approaches zero. So the uv term would be zero. Then the integral becomes the integral of [k sin(kt)] / t dt. Wait, that's the same as k times the integral of sin(kt)/t dt. Oh, but the integral of sin(kt)/t from -infty to infty is π times the sign of k, I think. Because ∫_{-∞}^{∞} sin(kt)/t dt = π * sign(k) for k ≠ 0.

Wait a second, so putting it all together: The integral after integration by parts is k times π sign(k)/2? Wait, no, let's see. The integral of sin(kt)/t from -infty to infty is π * sign(k) when k is positive, and -π when k is negative. Because ∫_{-infty}^infty (sin x)/x dx is π. So, for our case, the integral becomes k * (π/2) * sign(k), because when you do the integral of sin(kt)/t, you get π if k is positive, or -π if k is negative. Wait, wait, no, let me correct that.

Wait, the integral ∫_{-infty}^{infty} sin(kt)/t dt equals π if k > 0, and -π if k < 0. So it's π * sign(k). So in our case, after integration by parts, the integral becomes k * ∫ sin(kt)/t dt from -infty to infty, which is k * π sign(k). But wait, that would be k * π * sign(k). For positive k, that's k * π, and for negative k, it's k * (-π) = -k π. So overall, it's π |k|.

Wait, let's plug that back. So the integral of [cos(kt)] / t² dt from -infty to infty would be π |k|.

Wait, no. Because when I did the integration by parts, the integral became ∫ [k sin(kt)] / t dt, which is k times ∫ sin(kt)/t dt. So that's k times π sign(k). So for positive k, it's k * π. For negative k, it's k * (-π) = -k π. So overall, it's π |k|, because |k| is positive regardless of the sign of k.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, when I did integration by parts, I had:

∫ [cos(kt)]/t² dt = [ -cos(kt)/t ]_{-∞}^{+∞} + ∫ [k sin(kt)]/t dt.

The first term is zero because at t approaching ±infty, 1/t goes to zero and cos(kt) is bounded. So the integral becomes k ∫ sin(kt)/t dt.

And ∫_{-infty}^{+infty} sin(kt)/t dt is π sign(k). So the integral becomes k * π sign(k) = π |k|.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the integral of cos(kt)/t² is π |k|. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the integration by parts. Let me try that again.

Let u = cos(kt), dv = dt/t².

Then du = -k sin(kt) dt, v = -1/t.

So, integration by parts gives:

u*v from -infty to +infty minus ∫ v du.

So,

[ cos(kt) * (-1/t) ] from -infty to +infty + ∫ (1/t) * k sin(kt) dt.

The first term: as t approaches +infty, cos(kt) oscillates but 1/t goes to zero. Same as t approaches -infty. So the first term is zero.

So the integral becomes ∫ [k sin(kt)] / t dt, which is k times ∫ sin(kt)/t dt.

Now, ∫_{-infty}^{+infty} sin(kt)/t dt = π sign(k). So the result is k * π sign(k) = π |k|.

Wait, but that would mean that ∫_{-infty}^{+infty} [cos(kt)] / t² dt = π |k|.

But wait, that seems a bit strange. Because if k is zero, then cos(kt) is 1, and the integral of 1/t² from -infty to infty is not finite. So perhaps this formula holds for k ≠ 0.

So, going back to our problem.

Our integral after applying the product-to-sum identity is:

(1/2) ∫ [ cos( (3 - 1/π ) t ) - cos( (3 + 1/π ) t ) ] / t² dt from -infty to infty.

So each term is of the form ∫ cos(a t)/t² dt, which we just found is π |a|.

So the first term is (3 - 1/π ), and the second term is (3 + 1/π ), both multiplied by π.

So putting it together:

(1/2) [ π |3 - 1/π| - π |3 + 1/π| ].

Wait, but let's compute each term. Let's compute a1 = 3 - 1/π and a2 = 3 + 1/π.

Compute a1: 3 is about 3, 1/π is about 0.318. So 3 - 0.318 is about 2.682, which is positive. So |a1| = a1.

a2 is 3 + 0.318, which is about 3.318, also positive. So |a2| = a2.

So substituting in:

(1/2) [ π (3 - 1/π ) - π (3 + 1/π ) ].

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets:

π*(3 - 1/π) = 3π - 1.

π*(3 + 1/π) = 3π + 1.

So subtracting the second term from the first:

(3π -1) - (3π +1) = 3π -1 -3π -1 = -2.

So now the entire expression is (1/2) * (-2) = -1.

Wait, so the integral evaluates to -1. So looking back at the options, option H is -1.0.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with signs.

Let me redo the substitution:

The integral becomes (1/2) [ π a1 - π a2 ].

But wait, the integral is (1/2) times [ ∫ cos(a1 t)/t² dt - ∫ cos(a2 t)/t² dt ].

Each of those integrals is π |a1| and π |a2|, respectively.

So substituting:

(1/2) [ π a1 - π a2 ].

Wait, because a1 and a2 are positive, |a1| = a1 and |a2| = a2.

So:

(1/2) π (a1 - a2) = (1/2) π [ (3 - 1/π ) - (3 + 1/π ) ].

Simplify inside:

3 -1/π -3 -1/π = (-2/π).

So:

(1/2) π (-2/π) = (1/2) * (-2) = -1.

Yes, that's correct. So the value of the integral is -1.0, which is option H.

Wait, but let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the integration by parts? Let me see. The integral of cos(kt)/t² is indeed π |k|? Or is it 2π |k|? Because sometimes the integral from 0 to infinity is π |k|/2, so from -infty to infty would be π |k|. Wait, let me confirm.

The integral of cos(kt)/t² from -infty to infty: I think the standard integral is ∫_{-infty}^infty (cos(kt))/t^2 dt = π |k|. So that part seems correct.

Another way to think about it: The Fourier transform of 1/t² might relate to the distribution or principal value, but I'm not entirely sure. But given that the integration by parts led me to this result, and the steps make sense, I think the answer is -1.0.

To evaluate the integral 

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\sin(3t) \sin(t/\pi)}{t^2} \, dt,
\]

we start by using the product-to-sum identity for sine functions:

\[
\sin(A) \sin(B) = \frac{\cos(A-B) - \cos(A+B)}{2}.
\]

Applying this to the numerator, we rewrite the integral as:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\sin(3t) \sin(t/\pi)}{t^2} \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos\left((3 - 1/\pi)t\right) - \cos\left((3 + 1/\pi)t\right)}{t^2} \, dt.
\]

This separates into two integrals:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos\left((3 - 1/\pi)t\right)}{t^2} \, dt - \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos\left((3 + 1/\pi)t\right)}{t^2} \, dt \right].
\]

The integral of \(\cos(kt)/t^2\) over \((-∞, +∞)\) is known to be:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos(kt)}{t^2} \, dt = \pi |k|.
\]

Applying this result to each term, we identify \(k_1 = 3 - 1/\pi\) and \(k_2 = 3 + 1/\pi\). Since both \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) are positive, we have:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos\left((3 - 1/\pi)t\right)}{t^2} \, dt = \pi (3 - 1/\pi), \quad \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos\left((3 + 1/\pi)t\right)}{t^2} \, dt = \pi (3 + 1/\pi).
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left[ \pi (3 - 1/\pi) - \pi (3 + 1/\pi) \right].
\]

Simplify the terms inside the brackets:

\[
\pi (3 - 1/\pi) - \pi (3 + 1/\pi) = \pi \cdot 3 - \pi \cdot (1/\pi) - \pi \cdot 3 - \pi \cdot (1/\pi) = 3\pi - 1 - 3\pi - 1 = -2.
\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot (-2) = -1.
\]

The value of the integral is therefore \(-1.0\), which corresponds to option **H**.
