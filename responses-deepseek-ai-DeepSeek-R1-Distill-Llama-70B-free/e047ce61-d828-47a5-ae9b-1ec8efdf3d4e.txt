Okay, so I have this question about bonds and their fair market value. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question says: A state issues a 15-year $1000 bond that pays $25 every six months. The current market interest rate is 4%. What's the fair market value of the bond?

Alright, so I remember that bonds are priced based on the present value of their future cash flows. So I need to calculate the present value of all the interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity.

First, let's break down the given information. The bond has a face value (par value) of $1000, which is what it will be worth at maturity in 15 years. It pays $25 every six months. Wait, so that's a semiannual payment. So each year, it pays $50 in total, but divided into two payments of $25 each.

Wait, no. Wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Because if it's paying $25 every six months, then each year it's two payments of $25. So the annual interest is $50. So the coupon rate is 5% because (50/1000) = 0.05 or 5%. But wait, wait, the question says the current market rate is 4%. Oh, so the market interest rate is different from the bond's coupon rate. That will affect whether the bond is sold at a premium or discount.

So the bond's coupon rate is 5%, and the market rate is 4%. Since the coupon rate is higher than the market rate, the bond should sell at a premium, right? Because investors are willing to pay more for a higher coupon rate in a lower interest environment.

So the fair market value is the present value of all the cash flows. So we have two parts: the present value of the interest payments (an annuity) and the present value of the principal (a lump sum).

Since the payments are semiannual, I need to adjust the interest rate and the periods accordingly. The market rate is 4% annually, so semiannually it's 2% per period (because 4% divided by 2). The bond life is 15 years, so there are 30 semiannual periods (15 * 2).

So for the interest payments: each period is $25. So the present value of an ordinary annuity would be PMT × [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

PMT is $25, r is 2% or 0.02, and n is 30.

Calculating the present value factor for the annuity part:

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + 0.02)^-30] / 0.02.

I remember that the formula for PVIFA is [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r. Let me compute this.

First, (1.02)^30. Hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but I can approximate. Let me think: 1.02^30 is about e^(0.02*30) = e^0.6 ≈ 1.8221, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, I can use the exact calculation.

Wait, (1.02)^10 is approximately 1.2190, (1.02)^20 is about (1.2190)^2 ≈ 1.488, and (1.02)^30 would be (1.2190)^3. Let me compute that. 1.219 * 1.219 = approx 1.488, then multiplied by 1.219 again. 1.488 * 1.219 ≈ 1.488 * 1.2 is 1.7856 plus 1.488 * 0.019.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use a financial calculator approach. Alternatively, I can recall that (1.02)^30 is about 1.8061.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.8061. So let's use that.

So [1 - (1/1.8061)] / 0.02.

1/1.8061 ≈ 0.5537.

So [1 - 0.5537] = 0.4463. Divide by 0.02, gives 22.315.

So the PVIFA is approximately 22.315. So the present value of the interest payments is 25 * 22.315 = 557.875.

Wait, let me double-check that. 25 * 22.315: 20*22=440, 5*22=110, 0.315*25=7.875. So 440 + 110 + 7.875 = 557.875. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the present value of the principal. The principal is $1000, received in 30 periods at 2% per period. So the present value factor is [1 / (1.02)^30] = 1 / 1.8061 ≈ 0.5537. So 1000 * 0.5537 = 553.7.

So the total present value is the sum of the interest PV and the principal PV: 557.875 + 553.7 = 1111.575. Hmm, approximately 1111.58.

Looking at the options, option G is 1111.97, and option C is 1150, etc. So I must have miscalculated somewhere. Maybe I approximated the PVIFA incorrectly.

Wait, let me recalculate the PVIFA more accurately. Without approximating.

The formula is [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

r is 0.02, n is 30.

(1.02)^-30 is 1 / (1.02)^30.

Calculating (1.02)^30 exactly might be better. Let me compute 1.02^30.

Let me compute step by step:

1.02^1 = 1.02
^2 = 1.0404
^3=1.061208
^4=1.08243216
^5=1.10408 (approx)
^10: (1.02)^10 is approximately 1.2190 as before.
^20: (1.2190)^2 ≈ 1.4881.
^30: (1.4881) * (1.2190) = let's compute:

1.4881 * 1.2190:

1 * 1.4881 = 1.4881
0.2 *1.4881=0.29762
0.1 *1.4881=0.14881
0.019 *1.4881 ≈ 0.02830

Adding all: 1.4881 + 0.29762 = 1.78572 + 0.14881 = 1.93453 + 0.0283 ≈ 1.9628.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought (1.02)^30 was about 1.806. Hmm, perhaps my step-by-step approach is getting me confused. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use the more precise value.

I know that (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.8061, so the present value factor for the principal is 1 / 1.8061 ≈ 0.55368.

So the principal's present value is 1000 * 0.55368 ≈ 553.68.

Now for the annuity, the PVIFA. Using r=0.02, n=30.

The formula is (1 - (1.02)^-30 ) / 0.02.

(1.02)^-30 = 1/(1.02)^30 ≈ 1/1.8061 ≈ 0.55368.

So (1 - 0.55368) = 0.44632. Divided by 0.02 gives 22.316.

So the annuity present value is 25 * 22.316 = 557.9.

So total present value is 557.9 + 553.68 = 1111.58.

Looking back at the options, option G is 1111.97, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps I made a slight approximation error in the PVIFA.

Wait, maybe I should calculate (1.02)^30 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for precise computation, but since I can't, I'll proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the logarithm method for more accurate estimation.

ln(1.02) ≈ 0.0198026.

So ln(1.02)^30 = 30 * 0.0198026 ≈ 0.594076.

e^0.594076 ≈ e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.594 is a bit higher. Let me compute e^0.594.

We know that e^0.6 is approximately 1.8221. So 0.594 is 0.6 minus 0.006. So e^0.594 ≈ e^0.6 * e^(-0.006) ≈ 1.8221 * (1 - 0.006) ≈ 1.8221 * 0.994 ≈ 1.811. So (1.02)^30 ≈ 1.811.

So 1/(1.02)^30 ≈ 0.552.

So the principal's PV is 1000 * 0.552 = 552.

The annuity factor: [1 - (1/1.811)] / 0.02 = [ (1.811 - 1)/1.811 ] / 0.02 = (0.811/1.811) / 0.02 ≈ (0.4478) / 0.02 ≈ 22.39.

So 25 * 22.39 = 559.75.

Total PV: 552 + 559.75 = 1111.75, which is very close to 1111.97.

Wait, perhaps more precise calculation of the annuity factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula with more precise numbers. Maybe the exact PVIFA is 22.316, so 25 * 22.316 = 557.9.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two methods. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, 1111.97.

Wait, but I'm getting approximately 1111.58, which is very close to 1111.97. Maybe there's a more precise way to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the time value. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach is to use the formula for the price of a bond:

Price = (C × (1 - (1 + r)^-n )) / r + (FV) / (1 + r)^n.

Where C is the annual coupon payment, r is the periodic interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

Wait, but in this case, the coupon payment is $25 every six months, so annual coupon is $50. So C is $50 per year, but since it's semiannual, each payment is $25, with 30 periods.

So yes, the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the more precise value for (1.02)^-30.

Wait, let me compute (1.02)^30 with more precision.

Using a calculator (pretending I'm doing it step by step):

1.02^1 = 1.02

^2 = 1.0404

^3 = 1.061208

^4 = 1.08243216

^5 = 1.10408 (approx)

^6 = 1.12616

^7 = 1.14868

^8 = 1.171659

^9 = 1.195085

^10 = 1.2190

^11 = 1.24405

^12 = 1.269734

^13 = 1.296026

^14 = 1.322982

^15 = 1.350763

^16 = 1.379499

^17 = 1.409085

^18 = 1.439696

^19 = 1.471328

^20 = 1.503631

^21 = 1.536881

^22 = 1.571160

^23 = 1.606094

^24 = 1.642015

^25 = 1.678946

^26 = 1.717147

^27 = 1.756782

^28 = 1.797654

^29 = 1.839665

^30 = 1.882470

Wait, that's not matching my earlier approximation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step calculation. Because earlier I thought (1.02)^30 was around 1.8 something, but this step-by-step calculation is giving me 1.882 at 30. Wait, that can't be right. Because 1.02^30 is actually approximately 1.806, not 1.88.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should just accept that the precise calculation might give a PVIFA of about 22.32, leading to 25 * 22.32 = 558, and the principal's PV of 553.68, totaling 1111.68, which is very close to option G's 1111.97.

So perhaps the correct answer is G: 1111.97.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the precise formula.

The formula for the bond price is:

Price = (C × [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r ) + (F / (1 + r)^n )

Where:
C = annual coupon payment = $50
But wait, no, wait, because the payments are semiannual, so each period is 6 months, so r is 4%/2=2% per period, n=30, C is $25 per period.

So the formula should be:

Price = 25 * [1 - (1.02)^-30 ] / 0.02 + 1000 / (1.02)^30

Calculating each part:

First part: 25 * [1 - 1/(1.02)^30 ] / 0.02

Second part: 1000 / (1.02)^30

Let me get the exact value of (1.02)^30.

Using a calculator, (1.02)^30 ≈ 1.80611.

So 1/(1.02)^30 ≈ 0.55368.

So first part: 25 * (1 - 0.55368)/0.02 = 25 * (0.44632 / 0.02) = 25 * 22.316 = 557.9.

Second part: 1000 * 0.55368 = 553.68.

Total price: 557.9 + 553.68 = 1111.58.

Hmm, the options have G as 1111.97, which is about 0.39 higher. So perhaps the precise calculation gives a slightly higher number.

Wait, maybe I should calculate (1.02)^30 precisely.

Using a calculator, (1.02)^30 is approximately 1.80611, so the reciprocal is 0.55368.

So the exact present value would be 25*(1 - 0.55368)/0.02 + 1000*0.55368.

Which is 25*(0.44632/0.02) + 553.68.

25 * 22.316 = 557.9.

557.9 + 553.68 = 1111.58.

So the closest option is G: 1111.97, but our calculation is 1111.58, which is not exactly matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, the coupon is $25 every six months, so that's $50 annually. The bond's life is 15 years, so 30 periods. The market rate is 4%, so 2% per period.

Is the formula correct? Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the present value of the coupon payments as an annuity due, but I don't think that's the case here because bond payments are typically ordinary annuities (payments at the end of each period).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be:

Price = (C / r) * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] + FV / (1 + r)^n.

Which is the same as I did.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is precise, and 1111.58 is the correct value, but the options don't have that. Wait, looking at the options again:

Options are:

A: 975.00
B: 1250.00
C: 1150.00
D: 1050.00
E: 1085.65
F: 1000.00
G: 1111.97
H: 950.00
I: 1200.00
J: 900.00

So G is 1111.97, which is very close to our calculated 1111.58. Perhaps the slight difference is due to rounding in intermediate steps. So the correct answer would be G.
</think>

To determine the fair market value of the bond, we calculate the present value of its future cash flows, which include the semiannual interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity. The bond has a face value of $1000, a 15-year maturity, and pays $25 every six months ($50 annually). The market interest rate is 4%, which equates to a semiannual rate of 2% (4% divided by 2). The bond has 30 semiannual periods (15 years × 2).

### Step 1: Present Value of Interest Payments (Annuity)
The interest payments form an ordinary annuity. The present value of an annuity is calculated using the formula:

\[
PV_{\text{annuity}} = PMT \times \left[\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\right]
\]

Where:
- \(PMT = 25\) (semiannual interest payment),
- \(r = 0.02\) (semiannual interest rate),
- \(n = 30\) (number of periods).

First, calculate the present value annuity factor (\(PVIFA\)):

\[
PVIFA = \frac{1 - (1 + 0.02)^{-30}}{0.02}
\]

Using approximations:
- \((1.02)^{-30} \approx 0.55368\),
- \(1 - 0.55368 = 0.44632\),
- \(PVIFA = \frac{0.44632}{0.02} \approx 22
