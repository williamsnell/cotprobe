Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about centrifugal forces in a country, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

First, I remember that in geography, centrifugal forces are factors that tend to tear a country apart or lead to division. They work against the centripetal forces, which are the things that unify a country. So the question is asking which option is an example of a centrifugal force.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: Political stability. Hmm, that sounds more like a unifying factor because stability usually holds a country together. So probably not the answer.

B: Geographical unity. That also seems like a centripetal force. If a country's geography is unified, like not fragmented by mountains or rivers, it brings people together.

C: A strong economy. A strong economy is generally good for a country, so it's a centripetal force. It binds people together because everyone benefits.

D: An attack by another country. Wait, that's interesting. If another country attacks, I think that might actually unite the people against a common enemy, so it could be centripetal. But maybe in some cases, it could cause division if the country is already unstable. I'm not sure about this one. I'll have to think more.

E: A charismatic national leader. A leader like this would likely inspire and unite the country, so that's a centripetal force.

F: A popular national sport. Something like soccer or cricket can bring people together, so definitely a centripetal force.

G: Shared historical experiences. Common history tends to unify people, so that's centripetal.

H: A common language. Language is a major unifying factor. Without it, countries can have divisions, like in places where multiple languages are spoken. So a common language is centripetal.

I: Religious differences. Oh, this stands out. Religious differences can cause conflicts and divisions within a country. For example, countries where different religious groups have significant tensions or even violence. That's a centrifugal force because it pulls people apart.

J: A national holiday. Celebrating a national holiday brings people together, so that's centripetal.

So the question is asking which is a centrifugal force. From the options, I is religious differences, which fits because differing religions can create divisions. The other options either promote unity or are neutral but not necessarily divisive.

Wait, let me double-check. Centrifugal forces include things like different languages, religions, ethnicities, economic disparities, etc. So yes, religious differences definitely fit.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The question asks which option represents a centrifugal force in a country. Centrifugal forces are factors that create division and pull a country apart. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (Political stability)** and **C (A strong economy)** are centripetal forces that unify a country.
- **B (Geographical unity)** and **H (A common language)** also promote unity.
- **D (An attack by another country)** can sometimes unite people against a common threat.
- **E (A charismatic national leader)** and **F (A popular national sport)** inspire unity.
- **G (Shared historical experiences)** and **J (A national holiday)** foster a sense of common identity.

However, **I (Religious differences)** stands out as a centrifugal force because differing religious beliefs can lead to conflicts and divisions within a country, pulling it apart.

Answer: I
