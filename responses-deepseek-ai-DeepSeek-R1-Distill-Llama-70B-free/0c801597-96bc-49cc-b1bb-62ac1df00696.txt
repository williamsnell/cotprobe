Okay, so I have this problem about the net rate of evaporation from a water drop. Hmm, I remember that evaporation rates can be calculated using some kind of diffusion equation, maybe Fick's Law? I think Fick's Law relates the rate of diffusion to the concentration gradient.

The problem gives me a water drop with a diameter of 0.03 cm. That means the radius is half of that, so 0.015 cm. But wait, I should convert that into meters for consistency with SI units, right? So 0.015 cm is 0.0015 meters, or 1.5e-4 meters.

The drop is falling at 225 cm/s, which is 2.25 m/s. The air is at 1 atm pressure, and the temperature of the air is 145°F. Oh wait, I need to convert that to Celsius or Kelvin. Let me think, Fahrenheit to Celsius is (F -32) *5/9. So 145 -32 is 113. Multiply by 5/9: 113 *5 is 565, divided by 9 is about 62.78°C. To Kelvin, add 273.15, so about 335.93 K.

The surface temperature of the drop is 70°F. Let me convert that too. 70-32=38, *5/9 is about 21.11°C, and Kelvin is 294.26 K.

The vapor pressure of water at 70°F is given as 0.0247 atm. I think that's the saturation vapor pressure at the surface temperature of the drop. The surrounding air is at a higher temperature (145°F), so I guess the air can hold more vapor. But wait, the air is dry, so the vapor pressure in the air is probably zero unless it's saturated. But the problem doesn't say the air is saturated, so maybe the vapor pressure in the bulk air is zero.

Hmm, wait, no, the air is dry, so the partial pressure of water in the air is zero. So the concentration gradient is based on the vapor pressure at the surface minus the vapor pressure in the air.

But wait, I think the evaporation rate can be found using the equation:

N = (k * A * (P_s - P_inf)) / (R*T)

Wait, is that the right formula? Or is it using the mass transfer coefficient? Maybe it's the Sherwood number or something related to convection.

Oh right, for mass transfer, the rate might be calculated using the mass transfer coefficient (k_g), the area, and the concentration difference. The formula is something like N = k_g * A * (C_s - C_inf), where C is concentration.

Wait, how do I get the concentrations? Since we have vapor pressures, I can relate those to concentrations using the ideal gas law. C = P/(R*T), where R is the gas constant, probably in appropriate units.

So the concentration at the surface (C_s) is P_s/(R*T_s), and the concentration in the bulk air (C_inf) is P_inf/(R*T_inf). But wait, the air is dry, so P_inf is zero? No, wait. Because the air's temperature is higher, the surrounding air's vapor pressure is zero only if it's completely dry. But if the air is dry, the vapor pressure in the surrounding is zero. So P_inf = 0.

Wait, no, because the surrounding air's temperature is higher. So at the surface of the drop, the temperature is 70°F (21.11°C), and the surrounding air is 145°F (62.78°C). So the vapor pressure at the surface is 0.0247 atm. But the surrounding air can have vapor pressure up to its own saturation point, but since it's dry, the actual vapor pressure is zero.

So the concentration difference is C_s - C_inf = (P_s/(R T_s)) - (P_inf/(R T_inf)). But P_inf is zero, so it's just P_s/(R T_s).

Wait, but wait, because the surrounding air is at a different temperature. So maybe the approach is a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the log mean driving force, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the rate of evaporation can be calculated using the formula:

N = (k_g * A) * (P_s - P_inf) / (R T)

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, in some cases, the evaporation rate is given by the equation:

N = (h_m * A * (y_s - y_inf)) 

Where h_m is the mass transfer coefficient, y is the mole fraction, and A is the area.

But to find h_m, we might need to use the Sherwood number, which relates to the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. The Sherwood number Sh = h_m * d / D, where d is the diameter of the drop, and D is the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Calculate the area of the drop. It's a sphere, so surface area is 4 * π * r².

2. Determine the mass transfer coefficient, h_m. For that, compute the Sherwood number, Sh.

3. The Sherwood number for a sphere in convective mass transfer can be estimated using an appropriate correlation. I think for a sphere in a flow, a common correlation is Sh = 2 + 0.552 * Re^(1/2) * Sc^(1/3), for Re < 400.

Wait, Re is the Reynolds number, which is (velocity * diameter)/kinematic viscosity. I need the kinematic viscosity of air at the film temperature. The film temperature is the average of the surface temperature and the ambient temperature.

Wait, but the surface is at 70°F (294 K) and the air is at 145°F (336 K). So average is (294 + 336)/2 = 315 K. So I need the kinematic viscosity of air at 315 K.

I remember that the kinematic viscosity of air at around 300 K is about 15e-6 m²/s. Let me check: At 20°C (293 K), it's about 1.5e-5 m²/s, which is 15e-6. At higher temps, it increases. At 50°C (323 K), it's about 18e-6. So at 315 K, maybe around 16e-6 m²/s? Let's say approximately 16e-6 m²/s.

The diameter of the drop is 0.03 cm, which is 3e-4 meters. The velocity is 225 cm/s, which is 2.25 m/s.

So Re = (v * d) / ν = (2.25 m/s) * (3e-4 m) / (16e-6 m²/s). Let's calculate that.

2.25 * 3e-4 = 6.75e-4. Divided by 16e-6: 6.75e-4 / 16e-6 = (6.75 / 16) * 1e2 = approx 0.421875 * 100 = 42.1875. So Re is about 42.19.

Now, using the Sherwood number correlation Sh = 2 + 0.552 * Re^(0.5) * Sc^(1/3). So I need the Schmidt number, Sc, which is ν / D, where D is the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air.

The diffusion coefficient for water vapor in air at around 300 K is about 2.5e-5 m²/s. Let's say D = 2.5e-5 m²/s. So Sc = ν / D = (16e-6) / (2.5e-5) = (16/25) * (1e-6/1e-5) )= 0.64 * 0.1 = 0.064. Wait, no, wait: 16e-6 / 2.5e-5 = (16/2.5) * (1e-6 / 1e-5) )= 6.4 * 0.1 = 0.64. So Sc is 0.64.

Now, compute Re^0.5: sqrt(42.19) ≈ 6.495.

So Sh = 2 + 0.552 * 6.495 * (0.64)^(1/3). Let's compute each part.

First, 0.64^(1/3) is approximately 0.64^(0.333) ≈ 0.857.

So 0.552 * 6.495 ≈ 3.581. Then multiply by 0.857: 3.581 * 0.857 ≈ 3.07.

So Sh = 2 + 3.07 ≈ 5.07.

Now, h_m = Sh * D / d.

h_m = 5.07 * (2.5e-5 m²/s) / (3e-4 m) = 5.07 * (2.5e-5 / 3e-4) )= 5.07 * (0.083333...) = approx 0.4218 m/s.

Wait, no, wait: D is 2.5e-5 m²/s, d is 3e-4 m.

So 2.5e-5 / 3e-4 = (2.5/3) * 1e-5/1e-4 = 0.8333 * 0.1 = 0.08333.

Multiply by Sh (5.07): 5.07 * 0.08333 ≈ 0.422 m/s.

So h_m is approximately 0.422 m/s.

Now, the mole fraction difference: y_s - y_inf. 

The mole fraction y is (P_vapor) / P_total. Here, for the surface, P_s is 0.0247 atm, and P_total is 1 atm. So y_s = 0.0247 / 1 = 0.0247.

For the surrounding air, since it's dry, P_inf is 0, so y_inf is 0.

So the mole fraction difference is 0.0247.

Wait, but wait a second. The surrounding air is at a different temperature, so the saturation pressure is higher. But the problem says the air is dry, so the vapor pressure in the air is zero, hence y_inf is zero.

So the concentration difference is y_s = 0.0247.

Now, the mass transfer rate N is h_m * A * (y_s - y_inf) * P_total / (R T)

Wait, no. Wait, I think N is given by:

N = (h_m * A) * (C_s - C_inf)

But C is in kmol/m³. Alternatively, using the ideal gas law, C = P/(R T).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the molar flux as h_m multiplied by (C_s - C_inf), which is (P_s/(R T_s) - P_inf/(R T_inf)).

But since P_inf is zero, it's P_s/(R T_s).

So N = h_m * A * (P_s / (R T_s)).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to clarify.

The molar flux (mol/(m²·s)) is h_m * (C_s - C_inf). So N (total) is flux multiplied by area A.

C_s = P_s / (R T_s)

C_inf = P_inf / (R T_inf) = 0, since P_inf is zero.

So N = h_m * A * (P_s) / (R T_s)

Wait, let me confirm the units. h_m is in m/s, A is m², P in Pa (if using SI units) or atm, R in appropriate units.

But wait, let's make sure about the units.

h_m is m/s.

P is in Pascals (if using R in J/(mol·K)).

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T is in Kelvin.

So, putting it all together:

N = (h_m [m/s]) * (A [m²]) * (P_s [Pa]) / (R [J/mol·K] * T_s [K])

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So R has units J/(mol·K) = (kg·m²/s²)/(mol·K).

So P_s/(R T_s) would have units (Pa)/( (kg·m²/(s²·mol·K)) * K ) ) → (kg/(m·s²)) * (s²·mol·K)/(kg·m² * K) ) → (mol/(m³)).

Which makes sense because concentration is in mol/m³.

So, N (mol/s) = h_m (m/s) * A (m²) * (P_s/(R T_s)) (mol/m³)

So the units: (m/s) * m² * (mol/m³) ) → (mol/s).

Yes, that works.

So let's compute each part.

First, compute P_s. It's given as 0.0247 atm. Let's convert that to Pascals. 1 atm is 101325 Pa, so 0.0247 atm * 101325 ≈ 2500 Pa. Let me compute it: 0.0247 * 101325 = approximately 2500. Let me compute more accurately.

0.0247 * 101325:

Well, 0.02 * 101325 = 2026.5

0.0047 * 101325 = let's calculate 0.004 * 101325 = 405.3, and 0.0007 *101325≈70.9275. So total 405.3 +70.9275=476.2275.

So sum: 2026.5 + 476.2275 ≈ 2502.7275 Pa.

So P_s ≈ 2503 Pa.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T_s is the surface temperature in Kelvin: 70°F is 294.26 K.

So P_s/(R T_s) = 2503 / (8.314 * 294.26) → compute denominator: 8.314 *294.26 ≈ let's compute 8 * 294 =2352, 0.314*294≈92.3, so total ≈2352+92.3=2444.3.

So 2503 /2444.3 ≈ 1.0237 mol/m³.

Now, h_m is 0.422 m/s.

Area A: the drop is a sphere with diameter 0.03 cm → radius 0.015 cm = 0.0015 m. So surface area A =4 * π * r² = 4 * π * (0.0015)^2.

Compute 0.0015^2 = 2.25e-6 m².

So 4 * π * 2.25e-6 = approx 2.827e-5 m².

Now, putting it all together:

N = h_m * A * (P_s/(R T_s)).

So N = 0.422 * 2.827e-5 * 1.0237.

Compute 0.422 *2.827e-5 → 0.422 * 2.827e-5 ≈ 1.192e-5.

Multiply by 1.0237: 1.192e-5 *1.0237 ≈ 1.22e-5 mol/s.

Wait, but wait. The options given are in the range of 1e-7 to 1e-6. My calculation is giving 1.22e-5, which is larger than any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

Wait, in the calculation of Sh, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck:

Re was about 42.19.

Sh = 2 + 0.552 * Re^0.5 * Sc^(1/3).

Re^0.5 = sqrt(42.19) ≈6.495.

Sc was 0.64, so Sc^(1/3) ≈0.857.

So 0.552 *6.495= let's compute 0.5 *6.495=3.2475, 0.052*6.495≈0.337. So total ≈3.5845.

Then multiply by 0.857: 3.5845 *0.857 ≈3.07.

So Sh=2+3.07=5.07.

Then h_m = (Sh * D)/d.

D is 2.5e-5 m²/s, d=3e-4 m.

So h_m= (5.07 *2.5e-5)/ (3e-4) = (1.2675e-4) /3e-4 = approx 0.4225 m/s. That seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I used the wrong formula for Sh. Another correlation I remember for mass transfer around a sphere is Sh = 2 + 0.552 Re^0.5 Sc^(1/3), which I think is correct for Re < 400.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses Re^(1/2) and Sc^(1/3), which I think is correct.

Wait, but another thought: the mass transfer coefficient h_m is in m/s, but perhaps in some contexts, it's in kmol/(m²·s), but I think the way I used it is correct.

Wait, perhaps instead of using h_m as m/s, I should have used the formula N = (h_m * A * (P_s - P_inf)) / (R T_avg), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the rate of evaporation can be found using the equation:

N = (k_g * A * (P_s - P_inf)) / (R T)

But I'm getting a bit confused about whether to use T_s or an average temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

N = (k_g * A) * (y_s - y_inf) * P / (R T)

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another formula I found in some notes is:

N = (h_m * A) * (ρ_s - ρ_inf) / M_w

Where ρ is mass concentration, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the mass transfer using the equation:

N = (Sherwood number) * D * A * (C_s - C_inf) / d

Wait, no, because h_m = Sh * D / d.

So, with the numbers I have, I get N ≈1.22e-5 mol/s, but the
