Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the fatigue strength of a steel shaft. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanical properties, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the shaft needs to sustain 80,000 cycles. The materials given are a tensile strength of 390 MPa and an endurance limit of 115 MPa. Wait, I remember that fatigue strength depends on whether the number of cycles is above or below a certain threshold, like the endurance limit.

Oh right, the endurance limit is the stress level below which the material can theoretically withstand an infinite number of cycles without failing. But in this case, the cycles are 80,000, which is a finite number, not infinite. So I can't just use the endurance limit directly. I think I need to use the S-N curve or some kind of fatigue life equation.

Wait, what's the S-N curve? Oh yeah, it's a plot of stress (S) against the number of cycles (N) that a material can endure before failing. The curve usually has two regions: one where the relationship is linear up to a certain point, and beyond that, it's almost flat, which is the endurance limit.

So for steel, if the number of cycles is above a certain value (like 1e6 or something), we can use the endurance limit. But if it's below that, we have to calculate using the fatigue strength formula.

I'm a bit confused about the formula. I think the fatigue strength (S_e) can be calculated using the Basquin equation or maybe some other empirical relation. Oh wait, maybe it's the one where S_e = S_ut * (1 - (log N / log N_e)), where N_e is the number of cycles at the endurance limit. Or was that for a different material?

Wait, another approach: For steel, the endurance limit is typically around half the ultimate tensile strength. But in this case, the tensile strength is 390 MPa, and the endurance limit is 115 MPa. Wait, 115 isn't exactly half of 390. 390/2 is 195, which is higher than 115. So maybe this is a different situation, like the material isn't in a fully reversed loading condition, or perhaps it's a different type of steel.

Wait, no. The endurance limit is usually for fully reversed loading. If the problem doesn't specify the type of loading, I guess we're to assume fully reversed. So the given endurance limit is 115 MPa.

But wait, the problem is asking for the fatigue strength at 80,000 cycles. Since 80,000 is less than the endurance limit's cycle (which is usually around 1e6 or 1e7 for steels), I think I should use the fatigue strength formula that accounts for the number of cycles.

I remember the formula for fatigue strength when N is less than the endurance limit (which is around 1e6 cycles). For steels, the fatigue strength S_e can be found using the equation:

S_e = S_ut * (1 - (log N / log N_ref)) 

But wait, what's N_ref? I think for steels, the endurance limit is often considered to be at N_ref = 1e6 cycles. So if the number of cycles N is less than that, the fatigue strength is higher than the endurance limit.

Alternatively, another formula I've come across is the one that relates the fatigue life using the tensile strength and the number of cycles in the fatigue regime. For N between say 10^3 to 10^6 cycles, the fatigue strength can be calculated using S = S_ut * (N / A) ^ (-1/b), where A and b are material constants.

Wait, but I don't have A and b here. Maybe I should think of another approach. Oh, perhaps I can use the Goodman line or the Soderberg equation, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. Let's think about the S-N curve for steel. For N > N_e (where N_e is ~1e6 cycles), the fatigue strength is the endurance limit. For N < N_e, the fatigue strength is higher. So, the formula might be S = S_endurance + (S_ut - S_endurance) * (log N_e / log N) ?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to recall. The fatigue strength at N cycles when N < N_e (endurance limit) can be determined by the equation:

S_e = S_ut * (N_e / N)^k 

Wait, where k is a constant. For steel, what's k? I think for steel, the slope of the S-N curve in the finite life region is around 1/3 or something like that. Wait, maybe k is 1/3 or another value.

Alternatively, I've heard of the equation S = S_endurance + (S_ut - S_endurance) * (log N_e - log N)/(log N_e - log N_ref), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the fatigue strength for a given number of cycles can be found using the formula:

S_e = (S_ut * S_endurance) / (S_ut + S_endurance) * something. No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a linear interpolation between the tensile strength (at one cycle) and the endurance limit (at 1e6 cycles). So, the fatigue strength decreases as the number of cycles increases.

Let me try that approach. So, if at N=1, S = S_ut =390 MPa. At N=1e6, S = S_endurance=115 MPa. So, for N=80,000, which is between 1 and 1e6, the fatigue strength would be somewhere between 115 and 390.

Assuming a linear relationship on a log-log scale, the formula would be:

log S = log S_ut + (log S_endurance - log S_ut) * (log N) / (log N_e)

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

S = S_endurance + (S_ut - S_endurance) * (1 - (log N)/(log N_e)) )

Wait, let me check. Another approach is the equation S = (S_ut * S_endurance) / (S_ut + S_endurance) ) * something. No, that's probably not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the Basquin equation, which is S = S_ut * (N)^(-1/b), where b is a material parameter. But I don't have b here.

Wait, I think for steel, the value of b is often taken as 1/9. Or is it 1/3? Wait, I'm getting confused. I think in the Basquin equation, for steel, the slope is about 1/9, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I've heard that for steel, the exponent is around -0.1, so b would be 10, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another source said that for steel, the slope in the S-N curve (m) is around 3 or 5, which would mean 1/m is 0.333 or 0.2.

Wait, if the Basquin equation is S = A * N^(-1/b), and for steel, b is about 9, then 1/b is 1/9 ≈ 0.111.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the following approach:

The fatigue strength at N cycles is given by S = S_endurance + (S_ut - S_endurance) * (log N_e - log N) / (log N_e - log N_ref)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula that for N between 10^3 and 10^6 cycles, the fatigue strength can be found using S = S_endurance + (S_ut - S_endurance) * (1 - (log N)/(log N_e)) )

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to estimate based on the given options. Let's see, the options are A through J, with values ranging from 135 to 210 MPa.

Wait, if I consider that the number of cycles is 80,000, which is less than 1e6, so the fatigue strength should be higher than the endurance limit of 115 MPa but less than the tensile strength of 390 MPa.

Looking at the options, options C is 164.8, D is 190, E is 175, G is 155, H is 150. These are all above 115, which makes sense.

Wait, but how to calculate it. Let me try using the formula: S_e = S_endurance + (S_ut - S_endurance) * (1 - (log N / log N_e)).

Assuming N_e is 1e6 cycles. So N=80,000.

Compute log N = log(80000) ≈ 4.903 (since log(1e5)=5, 8e4 is 10^4.903≈8e4).

log N_e = log(1e6) =6.

So (log N / log N_e) = 4.903 /6 ≈0.8188.

So 1 - 0.8188 = 0.1812.

Then, (S_ut - S_endurance) = 390-115=275.

Multiply by 0.1812: 275 * 0.1812 ≈50 MPa.

So S_e =115 +50=165 MPa. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 164.8 MPa, which is very close. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Some sources use S_e = S_endurance * (1 + (S_ut/S_endurance -1) * (N_e/N)^k ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula S_e = S_ut * (N_e / (N_e + N))^(1/3). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another angle: The formula for the fatigue limit can be found using the equation for the S-N curve where S = a * N^b, where a and b are constants. For steel, what are a and b?

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is S_e = S_endurance + (S_ut - S_endurance) * (1 - (log N)/(log N_e)).

Which is what I used earlier, giving 165 MPa. So option C is 164.8, which is almost exactly what I got. So that must be the correct answer.

To calculate the fatigue strength of the steel shaft for 80,000 cycles, we use the relationship between the fatigue strength, tensile strength, endurance limit, and the number of cycles. The formula applied is:

\[
S_e = S_{\text{endurance}} + (S_{\text{ut}} - S_{\text{endurance}}) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\log N}{\log N_e}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( S_{\text{endurance}} = 115 \, \text{MPa} \),
- \( S_{\text{ut}} = 390 \, \text{MPa} \),
- \( N = 80,000 \),
- \( N_e = 1,000,000 \) (endurance limit threshold).

First, calculate the logarithmic terms:
\[
\log N = \log(80,000) \approx 4.903, \quad \log N_e = \log(1,000,000) = 6.
\]

The ratio of the logarithms is:
\[
\frac{\log N}{\log N_e} = \frac{4.903}{6} \approx 0.8188.
\]

Substitute into the formula:
\[
1 - \frac{\log N}{\log N_e} = 1 - 0.8188 = 0.1812,
\]
\[
S_{\text{ut}} - S_{\text{endurance}} = 390 - 115 = 275 \, \text{MPa}.
\]

Now calculate the fatigue strength:
\[
S_e = 115 + 275 \cdot 0.1812 \approx 115 + 50 = 165 \, \text{MPa}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest value is **164.8 MPa**, which corresponds to **Option C**.
