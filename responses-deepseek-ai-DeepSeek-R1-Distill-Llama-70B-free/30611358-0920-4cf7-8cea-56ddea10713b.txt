Okay, so I've got this question about demodulating a single tone-modulated signal. Hmm, I remember from my communication systems class that modulation and demodulation are processes used to encode information onto a carrier wave. But wait, the question is about single sideband (SSB) modulation, right?

The given modulated signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t). Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the question says the modulated signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t)? Or is that the baseband signal that's being modulated? Wait, no, the question says m(t) is the single tone-modulated signal. Or is m(t) the message signal before modulation? I think I need to clarify this.

Wait, in SSB modulation, the message signal is typically a single tone or something like that. So the modulated signal would be an SSB signal which has components around the carrier frequency. But wait, the question is about the demodulated output. So after demodulation, what do we get?

Wait, the process: when you modulate a signal using SSB, you end up with a signal that has either the upper sideband or the lower sideband. Then, during demodulation, you multiply the received signal by the carrier (or a synchronous carrier) to extract the original message.

But wait, the question is about the demodulated single sideband output. So the modulated signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t). Oh wait no, wait. Wait, m(t) is the modulating signal. So the SSB modulated signal would be something else. But in the question, it's given that m(t) is the single tone-modulated signal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the modulated signal being an SSB signal. So when you demodulate it, you get back the original message. But wait, the question says m(t) is the modulated signal, and we're to find g(t), the demodulated output.

Alternatively, perhaps m(t) is the original message, and the modulated signal is an SSB version. Then, the demodulation process would give us back m(t), but perhaps with some scaling.

Wait, let's think about SSB demodulation. The SSB signal is a product of the message signal (say, m(t)) and a carrier, but only one sideband is transmitted. So the modulated signal would be something like m(t) * cos(ω_c t) for upper sideband, but in a way that shifts the frequency spectrum.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

Modulation in SSB: The message signal is multiplied by the carrier, but through a process that results in only one sideband being present. So the modulated signal is either upper or lower sideband. The demodulation process involves multiplying by the carrier again and then low-pass filtering.

So, suppose the modulated signal is s(t) = m(t) * cos(ω_c t), but for SSB, m(t) is single-tone, so m(t) = cos(ω_m t). Then, the modulated signal s(t) would involve terms at (ω_c + ω_m) and (ω_c - ω_m), but in SSB, one of these is suppressed.

Wait, no, in SSB, the modulated signal is either the upper or the lower sideband. So when you modulate, you get s(t) = A [cos(ω_c + ω_m t) + cos(ω_c - ω_m t)] but for SSB, only one of these terms is present. Hmm, or perhaps it's represented differently.

Wait, maybe I should recall that for a single tone message, the SSB signal would be A cos(ω_c t) cos(ω_m t) which can be expanded using product-to-sum formulas. So, cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A−B)] / 2. So s(t) would be A/2 [cos((ω_c + ω_m)t) + cos((ω_c - ω_m)t)]. But if it's SSB, only one of these terms is present. So for example, upper sideband would be A/2 cos((ω_c + ω_m)t), and lower sideband A/2 cos((ω_c - ω_m)t).

Wait, but the question is about demodulating the SSB signal. So the receiver would multiply the received SSB signal by the carrier and then low-pass filter.

So, suppose the received SSB signal is r(t) = A_r cos((ω_c ± ω_m)t), where ± depends on whether it's upper or lower sideband.

Demodulation is done by multiplying by the carrier. So g(t) = r(t) * cos(ω_c t). Let's compute this.

g(t) = A_r cos((ω_c ± ω_m)t) * cos(ω_c t)

Using product-to-sum identity: cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A−B)] / 2

So,

g(t) = A_r/2 [ cos( (ω_c ± ω_m + ω_c) t ) + cos( (ω_c ± ω_m - ω_c) t ) ]

Simplify the terms:

First term inside cos: (2 ω_c ± ω_m) t

Second term: (± ω_m) t

So,

g(t) = (A_r / 2) [ cos( (2 ω_c ± ω_m) t ) + cos( ± ω_m t ) ]

Now, after this multiplication, the next step is to low-pass filter this signal. The low-pass filter removes the high-frequency term, which is the (2 ω_c ± ω_m) term. So what remains is the lower frequency term.

So after filtering, the output is (A_r / 2) cos(± ω_m t). But since cosine is even, cos(-θ) = cos θ, so it's (A_r / 2) cos(ω_m t).

Wait, but the original message was m(t) = cos(ω_m t). So the demodulated output should be proportional to m(t). So g(t) = (A_r / 2) cos(ω_m t).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

The options are:

A: Ar cos(2ω_m ±Δφ)
B: (Ar/3) cos(ω_m ±3Δφ)
C: (Ar/4) cos(ω_m ±Δφ)
D: Ar/2 cos(ω_m ±Δφ/2)
E: Ar/2 sin(ω_m)
F: Ar/2 sin(2ω_m ±Δφ/2)
G: Ar/2 cos(ω_m ±Δφ)
H: Ar/2 sin(ω_m ±Δφ)
I: Ar/2 cos(ω_m)
J: Ar cos(ω_m ±Δφ/3)

Wait, but in our case, the output is (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t). Looking through the options, option I says y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t). But let's check the other options.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it's the demodulated single sideband output. So perhaps the initial modulated signal was m(t) itself, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I mixed up the modulation and demodulation steps.

Wait, perhaps the given m(t) is the modulated signal, and we have to find the demodulated output. So m(t) is the SSB signal.

Wait, let me re-express this. Let's say the modulated signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), but that's probably not right. Because SSB modulation would place the message signal in a different frequency band. So perhaps m(t) is the modulated SSB signal, and we're to demodulate it to get back the original message. But in the question, m(t) is given as the modulated signal, and g(t) is the demodulated output.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's assume that the modulated signal is m(t) = A cos(ω_c t) cos(ω_m t). Then, the demodulation process would involve multiplying by cos(ω_c t), leading to terms at sum and difference frequencies. But wait, if m(t) is already an SSB signal, which is either upper or lower sideband, then perhaps m(t) is just A cos((ω_c + ω_m) t) or A cos((ω_c - ω_m) t).

Wait, but in the question, the modulated signal is given as m(t) = cos(ω_m t), which is a baseband signal, not modulated. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the given m(t) is the modulated SSB signal, and we're to find the demodulated output.

Wait, the question says: "For a single tone-modulated signal m(t) = cos(ω_m t). Find the demodulated single sideband output g(t)."

Wait, so m(t) is the modulated signal. So m(t) is the SSB signal. So m(t) would be something like A cos(ω_c t ± ω_m t), but perhaps. But wait, no, SSB is when you have the carrier plus the sideband, but only one sideband. Alternatively, the SSB signal is a product of the message and the carrier, but only one of the sidebands is present.

Wait, perhaps the modulated signal is m(t) = A cos(ω_m t), which is a single tone. But that's not modulated yet; modulation would involve mixing with a carrier. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the demodulation of an SSB signal, and m(t) is the modulating signal. So the SSB modulated signal would be s(t) = A cos(ω_c t) * cos(ω_m t), but only one sideband is present. So in reality, s(t) would be A [cos((ω_c + ω_m) t) + cos((ω_c - ω_m) t)] / 2, but for SSB, only one of these terms is present.

Wait, but the question says the modulated signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t). So perhaps m(t) is the SSB signal, which would be at a different frequency. Wait, maybe m(t) is the modulated signal, and when you demodulate it, you get back the original.

Wait, let me think again. The process is: original message is some signal, say x(t), which is modulated using SSB to produce the modulated signal m(t). Then, when you demodulate m(t), you get back x(t). So if the original x(t) is a single tone, say x(t) = cos(ω_0 t), then the modulated m(t) would be an SSB signal, and demodulating would give back x(t).

But the question states that m(t) is the modulated signal, which is a single tone. So when demodulated, what do we get? Wait, perhaps the modulated signal is m(t) = A cos(ω_m t), which is a single tone. But how is this modulated? Because modulation usually involves a carrier frequency.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the demodulation process of an SSB signal.

The SSB modulated signal is given by m(t) = A cos(ω_c t ± ω_m t), but that's not quite right. Wait, no, SSB modulated signal is m(t) = A [cos((ω_c + ω_m) t) + cos((ω_c - ω_m) t)] / 2, but only one term is present.

Wait, perhaps I should take a different approach. Let me consider that the modulated SSB signal is s(t) = A cos(ω_c t + φ) * cos(ω_m t). Wait, no, that's amplitude modulation, not SSB.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to model SSB as a form of frequency translation. So the message m(t) is multiplied by a carrier to shift it in frequency. For SSB, it's done in a way that only one sideband is transmitted.

So for a message m(t) = cos(ω_m t), the SSB signal would be s(t) = cos(ω_c t) * cos(ω_m t), but using single sideband, so only either the sum or the difference frequency is present. But wait, when you multiply two cosines, you get sum and difference frequencies.

So s(t) = [cos((ω_c + ω_m) t) + cos((ω_c - ω_m) t)] / 2. But in SSB, one of these terms is removed, so s(t) would be either [cos((ω_c + ω_m) t)] / 2 or [cos((ω_c - ω_m) t)] / 2.

Wait, but the question says that the modulated signal m(t) is a single tone, so perhaps the SSB signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t). But that can't be, because without the carrier, it's just a baseband signal. So perhaps the question is misworded, and m(t) is actually the message signal before modulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the modulated signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), and when you demodulate it, you get back the original baseband signal.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because demodulation of an SSB signal should involve mixing with the carrier to bring it back to baseband.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see the options again.

Looking at the options, option G is (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t ± Δφ). But the correct output after demodulation should be (A_r/2) cos(ω_m t), without any phase shift. So that would match option I, which is (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t). But wait, in our earlier analysis, after demodulation, the output is (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t). So that would correspond to option I.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because if the modulated signal is m(t) = cos(ω_m t), then when you demodulate, perhaps you're just extracting the envelope. But that's more like AM demodulation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the demodulation of an SSB signal that was modulated with a single tone would result in a scaled version of that tone. So if m(t) is the modulated SSB signal, then after demodulation, we get (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t), which is option I.

But wait, looking back, when I multiplied the SSB signal by the carrier, the result after filtering was (A_r/2) cos(ω_m t). So that would match option I, which is (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t).

So the correct answer should be option I.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option I is y(t) = (Ar/2) cos(ω_m t), yes. So that's the one.

To determine the demodulated single sideband (SSB) output \( g(t) \) for a single tone-modulated signal \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \), we analyze the demodulation process. In SSB modulation, the modulated signal typically consists of either the upper or lower sideband, which is a frequency-shifted version of the original message signal. During demodulation, the received SSB signal is multiplied by a synchronous carrier wave, and the high-frequency components are removed using a low-pass filter, leaving the original baseband message signal.

Given \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \) as the modulated SSB signal, the demodulation process involves extracting the original message signal. After multiplying by the carrier and filtering, the output is proportional to the original message signal \( \cos(\omega_m t) \), scaled by a factor of \( \frac{A_r}{2} \), where \( A_r \) is the amplitude of the received signal.

From the options provided:

- **Option I**: \( y(t) = \frac{A_r}{2} \cos(\omega_m t) \) matches the expected demodulated output, as it represents the scaled baseband signal without any additional phase shifts or frequency components.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: \( y(t) = \frac{A_r}{2} \cos(\omega_m t) \)**.
