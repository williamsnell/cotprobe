Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about remarriages, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is asking, "Remarriages are..." and then there are ten options from A to J. My task is to select the right one. Let's go through each option one by one and see which makes the most sense based on what I know.

Starting with option A: "More frequent for men than women." I remember reading somewhere that men tend to remarry more often than women after a divorce. I'm not entirely sure why, but maybe it's because men might seek companionship more actively, or perhaps societal expectations play a role. So this could be a possible correct answer.

Option B: "Illegal in most countries." That doesn't sound right. I know that in many places, remarriage is legal after a divorce or the death of a spouse. There might be some countries with stricter laws, but I don't think it's illegal in most. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: "Most common among those who have never been married before." Wait, that doesn't make sense. Remarriage by definition is when someone marries again after a previous marriage, so if they've never been married before, it's their first marriage, not a remarriage. So C is likely wrong.

Option D: "Typically more successful." I'm not sure about this. I've heard that remarriages, especially second marriages, have a higher divorce rate than first marriages. So if that's the case, D would be incorrect.

Option E: "Always unsuccessful." That's too absolute. While many remarriages do face challenges, it's not true that all of them are unsuccessful. Some people do have successful remarriages, so E is incorrect.

Option F: "Always successful." Again, this is an absolute statement, and it's not true because many remarriages end in divorce. So F is out.

Option G: "More frequent for women than men." This is the opposite of option A. I thought men remarry more often, but maybe I should think again. I've heard that women, especially after divorce, might be less likely to remarry compared to men because they might have different support systems or perhaps due to financial independence. So G might not be correct.

Option H: "Typically less successful." This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Remarriages do have higher divorce rates, so they're often less successful than first marriages. H seems like a strong candidate.

Option I: "Only allowed after a certain period of time." I don't think that's true. Some places might have a waiting period after a divorce before you can remarry, but it's not a universal rule. So I is incorrect.

Option J: "Most common among those who have been married multiple times before." Hmm, that's an interesting point. I think remarriage rates do increase with the number of previous marriages. People who have been married before are more likely to remarry again. So J could be correct.

Now I'm torn between options A, H, and J. Let me try to break it down.

Option A says men remarry more than women. I think that's correct because, statistically, men tend to remarry at higher rates. Women might be more selective or have different priorities after a divorce.

Option H states that remarriages are typically less successful. That's also correct because the divorce rate for second marriages is higher than for first marriages. So H is a strong contender.

Option J suggests that remarriages are most common among those who have been married multiple times before. That makes sense because once someone has remarried once, they might be more likely to do it again. So J could also be correct.

Wait, the question is asking what remarriages are. So I need to see which of these statements is accurate.

So, thinking about each statement:

A: More frequent for men than women. I think this is true. Men do remarry more often than women.

H: Typically less successful. This is also true because second marriages have a higher failure rate.

J: Most common among those who have been married multiple times before. This is also correct because people who have remarried once are more likely to remarry again.

But the question is about what remarriages are in general. So which of these is a correct statement?

I think all three could be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the question is looking for one specific fact.

Wait, let me try to remember any specific statistics or studies. I recall that the divorce rate is higher for second marriages, so H is correct. Also, men remarry more often than women, so A is correct. And people who have remarried before are more likely to remarry again, so J is correct.

But the options are presented as single choices. So the question is, which of these is a correct statement about remarriages.

Wait, the question is phrased as "Remarriages are..." So it's a general statement about remarriages.

So if the question is about the frequency of remarriages among men and women, then A and G are opposites. I'm pretty sure that men remarry more frequently than women, so A is correct.

If the question is about the success rate, then H is correct because remarriages are typically less successful.

If it's about who remarry the most, then J is correct because people with multiple marriages are more likely to remarry again.

So, the correct answer depends on which aspect the question is targeting. But the options are all separate, so the question is perhaps focusing on one particular fact.

I think in the context of the question, the correct answers are A, H, and J. But which one is presented as an option in the question?

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, each independent. So, the correct answer would be the one that is a true statement about remarriages.

So, considering each option:

A: True, men remarry more than women.

H: True, remarriages are less successful.

J: True, more common among those who have been married multiple times.

So, if the question is about frequency among genders, A is correct. If about success rates, H is correct. If about who remarries the most, J is correct.

But the question is asking "Remarriages are..." and each option is a different descriptor.

So, perhaps the correct answer is H: Typically less successful.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check if I remember correctly. I think that the divorce rate for second marriages is indeed higher than for first marriages. So H would be correct.

Alternatively, the question could be about the frequency of remarriage among different groups. For example, option J says they are most common among those who have been married multiple times before. That also makes sense because the more times you've been married, the more likely you are to remarry again.

But the question is about remarriages in general, so perhaps the key is to determine which statement is correct.

Another approach is to eliminate the incorrect options. B, C, E, F, I are clearly incorrect. So we're left with A, D, G, H, J.

D says "Typically more successful," which contradicts what I know, so D is incorrect.

G says "More frequent for women than men," which I think is the opposite of correct, so G is incorrect.

So now we're down to A, H, J.

Now, I think all three could be correct statements, but the question is which one is correct in this context.

The question asks, "Remarriages are..." So each option is a statement about remarriages. So all three statements A, H, J could be correct, but in the context of the options given, we need to pick the best one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J: "Most common among those who have been married multiple times before." Because once someone has remarried, they are more likely to do it again. So the statement is correct.

Alternatively, H: "Typically less successful." That is also correct.

So which one is more accurate as a general statement?

I think both H and J are correct. But the question is which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the options are mutually exclusive, so only one can be correct.

I think H is a more general statement about remarriages, while J is a specific fact about who tends to remarry more often.

But the question is about what remarriages are, in general. So perhaps H is the correct answer because it's a statement about the success of remarriages, which is a common topic in sociology.

Alternatively, the correct answer could be A, as it's about the frequency among genders.

I'm a bit stuck here, but I'll try to think about what the question is more likely to be testing.

I think the question is focusing on the success rate of remarriages, which would make H the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the question is in the present tense, "Remarriages are..." So looking for a general fact about remarriages.

I think the most commonly known fact is that remarriages have a higher divorce rate, making them less successful. So H would be correct.

But I also recall that men remarry more often than women, so A is also correct.

Hmm. So which one is the correct answer for this question?

Wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer is likely H: Typically less successful.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it could be J: Most common among those who have been married multiple times before.

I think I need to make a decision here. Based on what I know, H is correct because remarriages are typically less successful, having a higher divorce rate than first marriages.

So I'll go with H.

The question asks about remarriages and provides ten options to choose from. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **A**: "More frequent for men than women" is considered plausible, as men statistically remarry more often than women.  
- **B**: "Illegal in most countries" is incorrect, as remarriage is legal in most places after divorce or death of a spouse.  
- **C**: "Most common among those who have never been married before" is incorrect, as remarriage applies to those who have been married previously.  
- **D**: "Typically more successful" is incorrect, as remarriages often have higher divorce rates than first marriages.  
- **E**: "Always unsuccessful" is too absolute and incorrect, as some remarriages succeed.  
- **F**: "Always successful" is also incorrect for the same reason as E.  
- **G**: "More frequent for women than men" contradicts the general understanding that men remarry more often.  
- **H**: "Typically less successful" aligns with the known higher divorce rates for remarriages compared to first marriages.  
- **I**: "Only allowed after a certain period of time" is incorrect, as waiting periods for remarriage are not universal.  
- **J**: "Most common among those who have been married multiple times before" is plausible, as individuals who have remarried once are more likely to remarry again.  

After evaluating the options, **H** ("Typically less successful") is selected as the most accurate general statement about remarriages, given the higher divorce rates associated with them.

Answer: H
