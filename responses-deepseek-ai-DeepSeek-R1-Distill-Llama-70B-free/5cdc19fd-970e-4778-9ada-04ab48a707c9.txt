Okay, so I've got this question about utilitarianism and Mill's response to a criticism. Hmm, I remember that utilitarianism is an ethical theory that suggests actions are right if they maximize overall happiness. The question mentions a complaint that utilitarianism is a doctrine "worthy of swine." I think that's referring to the idea that utilitarianism only cares about the quantity of pleasure, not the type, which might be considered base or animalistic, like how pigs just eat whatever without caring about the quality.

So, the question is asking what Mill respondsâ€”how he defends utilitarianism against this criticism. I recall that Mill was a utilitarian but he had some nuances in his views. He must have argued that pleasures aren't all the same. I think he said something about the quality of pleasures being important, not just the quantity. 

Wait, in his book "Utilitarianism," Mill addresses this by introducing the idea that some pleasures are higher or more valuable than others. He uses the example of preferring higher intellectual pleasures over lower sensual ones. So, it's not just about how much pleasure but the kind of pleasure. 

Looking at the options, the choices are about how pleasures differ. The options are cost, weight, species, purity, morality, frequency, quality, practicality, intensity, duration. 

The key here is that Mill emphasizes the quality of pleasure. So, the answer should be G: quality. Let me double-check. Yes, because the criticism was about swine, implying base pleasures, and Mill's response is that higher quality pleasures are more valuable.

Mill addresses the criticism that utilitarianism is a doctrine "worthy of swine" by arguing that pleasures differ in quality. He distinguishes between higher intellectual pleasures and lower sensual ones, emphasizing that the quality of pleasure matters, not just the quantity.
