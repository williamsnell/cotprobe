Question:

A farm and an orchard are adjoining tracts of land located in a county. In 2006, a farmer purchased the farm, a 10-acre tract, in fee simple absolute. The orchard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the farm, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the farm under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the orchard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the orchard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the orchard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $250,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher farmer deed nor the farmer  investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the farm. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that both the farm and the orchard abut a public highway and that ingress and egress are afforded the investor by that highway. In an appropriate action by the investor to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the farm, she should

Options:

A: win, because the farmer had constructive notice of the easement.
B: lose, because the right-of-way was abandoned inasmuch as there never was any actual use made.
C: lose, because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard from the rancher.
D: lose, because the easement was not in use at the time of the sale to the investor.
E: lose, because the investor has reasonable access to the public highway without using the right-of-way.
F: win, because the investor has a right to access all parts of her property.
G: lose, because the easement was not specifically mentioned in the deed between the farmer and the investor.
H: win, because the right-of-way was never officially terminated.
I: win, because the investor acquired an easement by implication.
J: win, because the original deed clearly states the existence of the right-of-way.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about easements and property rights. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So the setup is that there are two adjacent tracts of land: a farm and an orchard. The farm is 10 acres, and the orchard is 20 acres to the north. The farmer bought the farm in 2006, getting fee simple absolute. The orchard was owned by a rancher, also fee simple.

Now, way back, a predecessor of the farmer granted a shepherd an easement appurtenant for ingress and egress across the farm. This easement was created with a deed, properly recorded. But the shepherd never actually used it. So, the easement exists legally but hasn't been used.

In 2010, the rancher sells the orchard to the farmer. So now the farmer owns both the farm and the orchard. Then in 2011, the farmer sells the orchard to an investor for $250k. Neither the deed from rancher to farmer nor from farmer to investor mentions the easement.

Now, the investor claims she has the right-of-way across the farm. Farmer says no such easement exists. Both properties abut a public highway, so the investor can access via that.

The question is, in a court case, would the investor win the right to use the right-of-way?

Hmm. Let's think about easement law. An easement appurtenant requires two properties: the dominant estate (which benefits) and the servient estate (which is burdened). The easement must attach to the land, not a person. So when the dominant estate (orchard) is sold, the easement should go with it, right?

Wait, but the farmer now owns both the farm and the orchard. So when he buys the orchard, does that cause a merger? Merger happens when the same person owns both the dominant and servient estates. But if that's the case, the easement is extinguished because it's no longer necessary—since one person owns both.

But wait, the farmer only owned both for a short time. He bought the orchard in 2010 and sold it in 2011. So during that time, he owned both, which might cause a merger, extinguishing the easement. But then, when he sells the orchard, does the easement come back?

I think merger only applies if the two estates are owned by the same person. So when the farmer sold the orchard, he no longer owns both, so the merger would end. But wait, does the merger during his ownership extinguish the easement permanently, or does it only suspend it while he owns both?

I remember that when an easement is extinguished by merger, it's only while the two estates are in common ownership. Once they are separated again, the easement can revive, unless there's something else, like abandonment.

But in this case, the easement was never used. The shepherd never used it. So could there be abandonment? But abandonment usually requires the owner of the easement (dominant estate) to clearly abandon it, like by not using it and intending to abandon. But here, the shepherd didn't use it, but also didn't do anything to abandon it. So maybe it's not abandoned.

Wait, but the investor is now the owner of the orchard. When the farmer sold it to her, the easement should have passed with the land if it was still valid. But if the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer owned both, then when he sold it, there was no easement to pass on.

So the key issue is whether the easement was extinguished during the time the farmer owned both properties.

Option C says the investor loses because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard. That sounds plausible.

Alternatively, option A says she wins because the farmer had constructive notice. The easement was recorded, so the farmer should have known about it when he bought the farm. But when he bought the orchard, he might have caused a merger, extinguishing it.

Wait, the original easement was created by a predecessor of the farmer. So when the farmer bought the farm, he took it subject to the existing easement. Then, when he bought the orchard, which was the dominant estate, he owned both, causing a merger. So the easement would be extinguished.

When he later sells the orchard, the easement isn't automatically revived because it was already extinguished. So the investor doesn't get the easement.

But another angle: when the farmer sold the orchard, the deed didn't mention the easement. But in property law, easements that are appurtenant and properly recorded are supposed to run with the land, so they don't need to be mentioned in the deed. But if the easement was extinguished by merger, then it's gone.

So the investor wouldn't have the easement because it was already extinguished when the farmer owned both.

Looking at the options:

C: lose because extinguished by merger.

D: lose because easement not in use when sold. But non-use doesn't necessarily terminate it; it's about abandonment, which wasn't the case here.

E: lose because she has access via public highway. But having an alternative access doesn't terminate an existing easement. So E isn't the reason.

So the best answer seems to be C: lose because of merger.

Another possibility is option J: win because the original deed states it. But if the easement was extinguished by merger, the original deed doesn't matter anymore.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around whether the investor has a right-of-way across the farm based on an easement appurtenant created in 2006. The easement was properly recorded but never used by the shepherd. The farmer acquired the orchard in 2010, creating a situation where the same person owned both the dominant estate (orchard) and the servient estate (farm). This raises the issue of merger, which occurs when the same party owns both estates, potentially extinguishing the easement. When the farmer sold the orchard to the investor in 2011, the easement could not revive because it had already been extinguished during the period of common ownership.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Easement by Merger**: When the farmer acquired the orchard, he owned both the dominant and servient estates. This created a merger, which extinguished the easement. The fact that the easement was recorded and appurtenant does not prevent its extinction during the period of common ownership.

2. **Abandonment**: Although the easement was never used, abandonment requires clear intent or actions to relinquish the right. There is no evidence of such intent here, so abandonment is not a valid defense.

3. **Public Highway Access**: The investor's access to the public highway does not negate the easement. However, since the easement was extinguished by merger, this point is moot.

4. **Deed References**: The absence of any mention of the easement in the deeds does not affect its status because easements appurtenant are intended to run with the land. However, the merger during the farmer's ownership rendered the easement invalid regardless.

The investor loses because the easement was extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired the orchard. This extinction is permanent, even after the farmer sold the orchard to the investor.
