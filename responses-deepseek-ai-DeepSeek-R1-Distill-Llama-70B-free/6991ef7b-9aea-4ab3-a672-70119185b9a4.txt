Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the work done when lifting a leaky bucket. Hmm, work done against gravity, right? I remember that work is force times distance, but since the force here changes as things are lifted, I think I need to use calculus, maybe an integral.

Alright, let's read the problem again. So, there's a 10-kg bucket that's leaking. It's lifted to a height of 12 meters at a constant speed. The rope weighs 0.8 kg/m. The bucket initially has 36 kg of water, but it leaks at a constant rate and finishes draining just as it reaches 12 meters. I'm supposed to find the work done.

Wait, so the total mass being lifted changes with time as water leaks. But the lifting is at constant speed, so acceleration is zero, which probably means the force applied equals the weight at each point.

Work done is the integral of force over distance. But here, the force isn't constant because the mass (and thus weight) changes as the bucket is lifted.

Let me break this down into parts: the bucket, the water, and the rope. Each contributes to the total force.

Starting with the bucket itself: it's 10 kg. So its weight is 10 kg * g, where g is 9.8 m/s². But since we're dealing with work, which is force times distance, the work for the bucket would be mgh, right? So 10 * g * 12. But wait, maybe I should keep g as a variable for now and plug in numbers later.

Next, the water. Initially, it's 36 kg, but it leaks at a constant rate. Since it finishes draining at 12 meters, the leakage rate is such that over the distance of 12 meters, all 36 kg leaks out. So the mass of the water as a function of height y would decrease linearly from 36 kg at y=0 to 0 at y=12.

So the mass of water at height y is m_water(y) = 36 - (36/12)y = 36 - 3y kg. Wait, because in 12 meters, 36 kg is lost. So per meter, it loses 3 kg. So yes, that formula makes sense.

So the force due to the water at any height y is m_water(y) * g, and the work done to lift the water is the integral from 0 to 12 of m_water(y) * g * dy. So that would be ∫ (36 - 3y) * g dy from 0 to 12. Let me compute that: integral of 36 is 36y, integral of 3y is (3/2)y². So evaluated from 0 to 12, it's [36*12 - (3/2)(12)^2] * g. Let's calculate that: 36*12 is 432, (3/2)*144 is 216. So 432 - 216 = 216. Multiply by g, so 216g for the water's work.

Then, the bucket's work is straightforward: 10 kg * g * 12 m = 120g.

Now, the rope. The rope's weight is given as 0.8 kg/m. Since it's being lifted, as we pull it up, the length of rope that's hanging decreases. At any height y, the amount of rope still being lifted is (12 - y) meters, right? Because when you've lifted y meters, that much rope is out of the well and doesn't contribute to the weight anymore. So the mass of the rope at height y is 0.8*(12 - y) kg. So the force is 0.8*(12 - y)*g.

Thus, the work done to lift the rope is the integral from 0 to 12 of 0.8*(12 - y) * g dy. Let's compute that. 0.8g ∫(12 - y) dy from 0 to12. The integral of 12 is 12y, integral of y is (1/2)y². So evaluating from 0 to 12: 12*12 - (1/2)(12)^2 = 144 - 72 = 72. Multiply by 0.8 g: 0.8*72 g = 57.6 g.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the rope's mass. So when lifting the bucket, at a height y, the rope that's still hanging is 12 - y meters. Because as you lift, the rope is being pulled up, so the length that's left to lift decreases. So the mass at any point is 0.8 kg/m * (12 - y) meters. So yeah, the force is 0.8*(12 - y)*g, and the work is the integral of that from 0 to12.

So adding up all the contributions: bucket + water + rope.

Total work W = (120 + 216 + 57.6)*g.

Wait, let me add those numbers. 120 + 216 = 336, plus 57.6 is 393.6. So W = 393.6 g.

Wait, but wait, 10 kg bucket times 12 m is 120 kg·m, which when multiplied by g is 120g. Similarly, the water's contribution was 216g, and the rope was 57.6g. So 120 + 216 is 336, plus 57.6 is 393.6. So yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me double-check the rope's calculation. The integral was 0.8g ∫ (12 - y) dy from 0 to12.

Integral of (12 - y) dy is [12y - 0.5 y²] from 0 to12. So plugging in 12: 12*12=144, 0.5*(12)^2=72. So 144-72=72. Multiply by 0.8g: 57.6g. That's correct.

So total work is (120 + 216 +57.6) g = 393.6 g.

Now, plugging in g=9.8 m/s². So 393.6 *9.8.

Let me compute that. 393.6 *9.8 = ?

Well, 393.6 *10 is 3936, minus 393.6 *0.2 (since 9.8=10-0.2). 0.2 *393.6 is 78.72. So 3936 -78.72=3857.28 J.

Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 3857 J. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait, did I get all the contributions right? Let me go through each part again.

Bucket: 10 kg, 12 m, so 10*12=120 kg·m → 120g J.

Water: starts at 36 kg, leaks at 3 kg/m. So mass as a function of y is 36-3y. The work is ∫ (36-3y)g dy from 0 to12.

Integral: 36y - 1.5 y² from 0 to12 → 36*12=432, 1.5*(144)=216. So 432-216=216, times g → 216g J.

Rope: at any y, the remaining rope is (12 - y) m, so mass is 0.8*(12 - y). The force is 0.8*(12 - y)*g. Work is ∫ from 0 to12 of 0.8*(12 - y)g dy.

Which is 0.8g ∫12 - y dy → 0.8g [12y - 0.5 y²] from 0 to12 → 0.8g (144 -72) = 0.8g (72) = 57.6g J.

Adding all together: 120g +216g +57.6g = 393.6g.

393.6 *9.8 = let's recalculate.

393.6 *10=3936; 393.6 *0.2=78.72. So 3936 -78.72=3857.28 J. Rounded to four significant figures, it's 3857 J.

Looking back at the options, option E is 3857 J. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the work done in lifting the leaky bucket, we need to account for the work done against gravity for three components: the bucket, the water, and the rope. The work is expressed as an integral for each component, summed together, and evaluated.

### 1. **Work to lift the bucket**
The bucket has a constant mass of 10 kg, so the work done to lift it to a height of 12 m is:

\[
W_{\text{bucket}} = m_{\text{bucket}} \cdot g \cdot h = 10 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 12 = 1176 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

### 2. **Work to lift the water**
The water leaks at a constant rate, starting with 36 kg and draining completely over 12 m. The mass of the water as a function of height \( y \) is:

\[
m_{\text{water}}(y) = 36 - 3y \, \mathrm{kg}.
\]

The work done to lift the water is:

\[
W_{\text{water}} = \int_0^{12} m_{\text{water}}(y) \cdot g \, dy = \int_0^{12} (36 - 3y) \cdot 9.8 \, dy.
\]

Breaking this into terms:

\[
\int_0^{12} 36 \, dy = 36y \Big|_0^{12} = 432, \quad \int_0^{12} 3y \, dy = \frac{3}{2} y^2 \Big|_0^{12} = 216.
\]

Thus:

\[
W_{\text{water}} = (432 - 216) \cdot 9.8 = 216 \cdot 9.8 = 2116.8 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

### 3. **Work to lift the rope**
The rope has a linear density of \( 0.8 \, \mathrm{kg/m} \). At any height \( y \), the length of rope still being lifted is \( 12 - y \), so its mass is:

\[
m_{\text{rope}}(y) = 0.8 \cdot (12 - y) \, \mathrm{kg}.
\]

The work done to lift the rope is:

\[
W_{\text{rope}} = \int_0^{12} m_{\text{rope}}(y) \cdot g \, dy = \int_0^{12} 0.8 \cdot (12 - y) \cdot 9.8 \, dy.
\]

Breaking this into terms:

\[
\int_0^{12} 12 \, dy = 12y \Big|_0^{12} = 144, \quad \int_0^{12} y \, dy = \frac{1}{2} y^2 \Big|_0^{12} = 72.
\]

Thus:

\[
W_{\text{rope}} = 0.8 \cdot 9.8 \cdot (144 - 72) = 0.8 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 72 = 564.48 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

### 4. **Total work**
The total work is the sum of the work done on the bucket, water, and rope:

\[
W_{\text{total}} = W_{\text{bucket}} + W_{\text{water}} + W_{\text{rope}} = 1176 + 2116.8 + 564.48 = 3857.28 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number:

\[
W_{\text{total}} = 3857 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

### Final Answer:
**E: 3857 J**
