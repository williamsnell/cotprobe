Okay, so I have this finance problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of questions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem is about ABC Corporation issuing bonds and setting up a fund to redeem them. Let's break down the details.

So, the company issued 200 bonds, each with a $1,000 face value. That means the total face value is 200 * $1,000 = $200,000. These bonds are redeemable at par after 15 years, so the company will have to pay back $200,000 in 15 years.

To accumulate the funds needed for redemption, ABC has set up a fund where they make annual deposits. The fund earns 4% interest per year. The question is asking for the principal in the fund at the end of 12 years.

Wait, wait. So the fund is being built up over time. So they're making annual contributions, and the money is growing with interest each year. They have 15 years until redemption, but the question is about the principal after 12 years. Hmm, so maybe they started the fund 12 years before the redemption date, which is 3 years remaining. Or perhaps they have 12 years of deposits already made, and the fund has been growing for those 12 years.

I think the setup is that the company needs to have $200,000 at the end of 15 years. So they're making annual deposits into a fund that earns 4% each year. The fund's value at the end of each year is the sum of all deposits plus the interest earned.

Wait, no, the question is asking for the principal at the end of 12 years, not the total needed. So maybe it's a case of a sinking fund where they are accumulating the amount over 15 years, but we're looking at the balance after 12 years.

So the key here is to calculate the future value of the sinking fund after 12 years, given annual deposits. But wait, I'm not sure if the deposits are being made at the end of each year or the beginning. Typically, in these problems, unless stated otherwise, it's end of year.

So, the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity (end of period payments) is:

FV = PMT * [( (1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

Where:
FV = Future Value
PMT = annual deposit (payment)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of years

But wait, in this question, we don't know the PMT. So perhaps we can compute it based on the requirement that at year 15, the fund needs to be $200,000. But the question is only asking about the amount after 12 years, so maybe we need to find the annual payment first, then compute the FV after 12 years.

Wait, so the plan is that the company needs $200,000 at year 15. They are contributing each year, and the fund earns 4% annually. So the present value of the $200,000 at year 0 is equal to the sum of the deposits made each year, each discounted back to year 0.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to compute the annual payment needed so that the future value at year 15 is $200,000. So solving for PMT in the FV formula.

So, FV at year 15 is $200,000. So:

200,000 = PMT * [ ( (1 + 0.04)^15 - 1 ) / 0.04 ]

We can compute the term in the brackets first. Let me calculate (1.04)^15. Hmm, I think 1.04^15 is approximately 2.396. Let me verify that. Well, 1.04^10 is about 1.480, and 1.04^5 is about 1.216. So 1.480 * 1.216 ≈ 1.799, which is about 1.04^15. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, alternatively, I can use the formula for the future value annuity factor.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the present value approach. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the required annual payment first. Because without knowing that, I can't find the FV after 12 years.

So, the future value of the annuity at year 15 is $200,000.

FV = PMT * [ ((1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

200,000 = PMT * [ (1.04^15 - 1 ) / 0.04 ]

Let me compute (1.04)^15. Let me compute it step by step.

1.04^1 = 1.04

^2: 1.0816

^3: 1.124864

^4: approx 1.16985856

^5: approx 1.2166529024

^6: 1.262470 (approx)

^7: 1.3108

^8: 1.3605

^9: 1.4129

^10: approx 1.4802

^11: 1.04 * 1.4802 = 1.5386

^12: 1.04 * 1.5386 ≈ 1.5985

^13: 1.04 * 1.5985 ≈ 1.6623

^14: 1.04 * 1.6623 ≈ 1.7290

^15: 1.04 * 1.7290 ≈ 1.7971

So approximately 1.7971.

So ((1.04^15) - 1 ) = 0.7971.

Divide by 0.04 gives 0.7971 / 0.04 = 19.9275.

So 200,000 = PMT * 19.9275

So PMT = 200,000 / 19.9275 ≈ 10,033.65 per year.

Wait, wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 200,000 divided by 19.9275 is approximately 200,000 / 20 = 10,000. So yes, about $10,033.65 per year. So that's the annual deposit.

But wait, that's the amount they need to deposit each year to have $200,000 at year 15.

Now, the question is, what's the principal in the fund at the end of 12 years? So after 12 years of deposits and interest.

So for this, I can compute the future value of the annuity after 12 years.

Alternatively, since each deposit is made at the end of each year, the FV after 12 years would be the sum of each deposit compounded for 0 to 11 years, depending on when they were made.

The formula for FV of an ordinary annuity after n years is:

FV = PMT * [ ((1 + r)^n - 1 ) / r ]

So using the same PMT of $10,033.65, r=4%, n=12.

Compute (1.04)^12. Let's calculate that.

1.04^12: Let's see, I know that 1.04^6 is about 1.2653, so 1.2653 squared is approx 1.2653 * 1.2653.

Let me compute 1.2653 * 1.2653.

1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44.

1.2 * 0.0653 = 0.07836, and same for the other, so 0.15672.

Then 0.0653 * 0.0653 is negligible, so approx 1.44 + 0.15672 + ... = 1.5967.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 1.04^12 step by step.

1.04^1 = 1.04

^2 = 1.0816

^3 ≈ 1.124864

^4 ≈ 1.16985856

^5 ≈ 1.2166529

^6 ≈ 1.265319

^7 ≈ 1.3159318

^8 ≈ 1.368569

^9 ≈ 1.4233128

^10 ≈ 1.4802443

^11 ≈ 1.5394543

^12 ≈ 1.6010329

So (1.04)^12 ≈ 1.6010.

So ((1.04^12) -1 ) / 0.04 = (0.6010) / 0.04 = 15.025.

So FV = 10,033.65 * 15.025 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

10,000 * 15.025 = 150,250.

33.65 * 15.025 ≈ 33.65 *15=504.75, and 33.65 *0.025=0.84125, so total approx 505.591.

So total FV ≈ 150,250 + 505.591 = 150,755.59.

Wait, but wait, this is an approximate calculation. The exact value might be a bit different. Let me check with more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the annual payment is approximately $10,033.65, but let's see if the initial calculation was precise enough.

Wait, let's recompute the annuity factor for 15 years.

Earlier, I approximated (1.04)^15 as 1.7971, which gives (1.7971-1)/0.04= 19.9275, which when multiplied by PMT gives 200,000.

But perhaps a more accurate calculation is better.

Let me compute 1.04^15 using a calculator approach. Hmm, perhaps I can use the rule of logarithms, but maybe that's too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the annual payment is approximately $10,033.65, and proceed.

So then, for 12 years, the future value is PMT * [(1.04^12 -1)/0.04] = 10,033.65 * 15.025 ≈ 150,755.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that figure. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $180,250

B: $175,000

C: $15,026

D: $205,500

E: $9,988.01

F: $12,000

G: $125,000

H: $200,000

I: $160,320

J: $150,080

Hmm, my approximate calculation got around $150,755, which is close to option J: $150,080, but not exact. So perhaps my calculation was a bit off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the annual payment. Let me recalculate the PMT.

The FV after 15 years is $200,000. So:

FV = PMT * [ (1.04^15 -1 ) / 0.04 ].

Let me compute 1.04^15 more accurately. Let's compute each year step by step.

Year 1: 1.04

Year 2: 1.0816

Year 3: 1.124864

Year 4: 1.16985856

Year 5: 1.2166529

Year 6: 1.265319

Year 7: 1.3159318

Year 8: 1.368569

Year 9: 1.4233128

Year 10: 1.4802443

Year 11: 1.4802443 *1.04 = let's compute:

1.4802443 *1.04 = 1.4802443 + (1.4802443 *0.04) = 1.4802443 + 0.05920977 ≈ 1.53945407.

Year 12: 1.53945407 *1.04.

1.53945407 * 0.04 = 0.06157816, so 1.53945407 + 0.06157816 ≈ 1.60103223.

Year 13: 1.60103223 *1.04.

1.60103223 * 0.04 = 0.06404129, so 1.60103223 + 0.06404129 ≈ 1.66507352.

Year 14: 1.66507352 *1.04.

1.66507352 *0.04 = 0.06660294, so 1.66507352 + 0.06660294 ≈ 1.73167646.

Year 15: 1.73167646 *1.04.

1.73167646 *0.04 = 0.069267058, so 1.73167646 + 0.069267058 ≈ 1.800943518.

So 1.04^15 ≈ 1.800943518.

So [(1.04^15) -1 ] = 0.800943518.

Divide by 0.04: 0.800943518 / 0.04 = 20.02358795.

So FV = PMT * 20.02358795 = 200,000.

So PMT = 200,000 / 20.02358795 ≈ let's compute that.

200,000 ÷ 20.02358795 ≈ 200,000 / 20.023588 ≈ 10,000 - because 20 * 10,000 = 200,000. But let's do it more accurately.

Compute 200,000 ÷ 20.023588.

Let me approximate:

20.023588 * 10,000 = 200,235.88.

But we need 200,000, so 10,000 would give us 200,235.88, which is a bit more than required. So perhaps PMT is approximately 9,975 per year.

Wait, let me compute 20.023588 * x = 200,000.

x = 200,000 / 20.023588 ≈ let's compute that using division.

200,000 ÷ 20.023588.

Well, 200,000 ÷ 20 is 10,000.

But since 20.023588 is a bit more than 20, the result will be a bit less than 10,000.

Let me compute 20.023588 * 9,975 = ?

Compute 20 * 9,975 = 199,500.

Then 0.023588 *9,975 ≈ let's compute 9,975 *0.023588.

Well, 10,000 *0.023588 = 235.88, so 9,975 is 25 less, so 235.88 - (25 *0.023588)= 235.88 - 0.5897= 235.2903.

So 20.023588 *9,975 = 199,500 + 235.2903≈ 199,735.29.

Which is close to 200,000. The difference is 200,000 -199,735.29= 264.71.

So how much more do we need?

We can compute how much more PMT is needed beyond 9,975 to make up the difference.

Each additional dollar in PMT contributes approximately 20.023588 dollars to FV. So 264.71 /20.023588 ≈ ~13.21.

So PMT≈9,975 +13.21= 9,988.21.

So approximately $9,988.21 per year.

Wait, that's much lower than the initial estimate of ~$10,033. I think I made a mistake earlier. Hmm.

So now, with PMT = ~$9,988.21.

Now, the next step is to compute the future value of this annuity after 12 years.

So FV = PMT * [ (1.04^12 -1 ) /0.04 ]

We have 1.04^12 ≈1.60103223, as calculated earlier.

So (1.60103223 -1 )=0.60103223.

Divide by 0.04: 0.60103223 /0.04 =15.0258.

So FV =9,988.21 *15.0258.

Let me compute that.

9,988.21 *15 = 149,823.15.

9,988.21 *0.0258≈9,988.21 *0.025=249.70525, and 9,988.21 *0.0008≈7.99056.

So 249.70525 +7.99056≈257.6958.

So total FV≈149,823.15 +257.6958≈150,080.85.

Rounding to the nearest dollar gives $150,081.

Looking at the options, option J is $150,080, which is very close to this value.

So the correct answer should be J.
</think>

The ABC Corporation has issued 200 bonds, each with a $1,000 face value, totaling $200,000, redeemable at par after 15 years. To accumulate the funds required for redemption, ABC has established a sinking fund with annual deposits earning 4% interest per year. The goal is to determine the principal in the fund at the end of 12 years.

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the Annual Deposit (PMT):**
   The future value of the fund at year 15 must equal $200,000. Using the future value of an annuity formula:
   \[
   FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
   \]
   where \( FV = 200,000 \), \( r = 0.04 \), and \( n = 15 \). Calculating \( (1.04)^{15} \approx 1.8009 \), the annuity factor becomes:
   \[
   \frac{(1.04)^{15} - 1}{0.04} \approx 20.0236
   \]
   Solving for \( PMT \):
   \[
   PMT = \frac{200,000}{20.0236} \approx 9,988.21
   \]

2. **Calculate the Future Value at Year 12:**
   The future value of the sinking fund after 12 years is calculated using the same formula:
   \[
   FV = PMT \cdot \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
   \]
   where \( PMT = 9,988.21 \), \( r = 0.04 \), and \( n = 12 \). Calculating \( (1.04)^{12} \approx 1.6010 \),
