Question:

A man entered a half-opened window to a neighbor's trailer and waited in the dark bedroom inside. After a while, he got in bed and had sexual relations with the woman while she slept. At trial, he claimed that he believed that the woman had consented because he had dated her many times and had consensual sexual relations with her many times in the past. He hadn't seen her in about one week but assumed her consent. He denied specific intent to rape and claimed a desire to surprise her with a "romantic" variation of their usual activities. The woman admitted to prior consensual relations but denied consent on this occasion. Has he stated a viable defense to rape?

Options:

A: No, his belief that she consented in advance was unreasonable and impermissible.
B: No, because he did not receive explicit consent for this specific encounter.
C: Yes, because he entered through an unlocked window which could be seen as an invitation.
D: Yes, because they had a history of consensual relations and this could be seen as a continuation of that.
E: Yes, rape is a specific intent crime and there's no evidence that he intended a criminal result.
F: Yes, his belief that she consented was reasonable based on prior experience.
G: No, rape of an unconscious woman is a strict liability crime that does not permit a defense.
H: No, because the woman was asleep and unable to give consent.
I: Yes, because he had no intent to harm or force her into anything she didn't want.
J: No, because consent cannot be assumed from past experiences.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this rape law question. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is that a man entered a half-opened window into his neighbor's trailer. He waited in the dark bedroom and then got into bed with the woman while she was asleep. They had sexual relations while she was sleeping. At trial, he claims he believed she consented because they had dated many times and had consensual sex before. He hadn't seen her in a week but assumed she consented. He says he didn't intend to rape her and wanted to surprise her romantically. The woman says they had consensual relations before but denies consenting this time.

The question is whether he has a viable defense to rape.

Hmm. So I remember that rape generally requires the prosecution to prove that the defendant intended to commit the act without consent. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

I think consent is a key element. If the woman was asleep, she couldn't give consent. But he's arguing that he reasonably believed she consented based on their past.

Wait, but in many jurisdictions, a person can't consent if they're unconscious or asleep. So even if they had a history, if she's asleep, she can't consent. So his belief that she consented because of past relations might not matter.

Also, I remember something about "reasonable belief" in consent. But if the belief is based on past experiences, is that reasonable? Or does the law require consent to be given at the time of the act?

I think the law says that consent must be given at the time of the act. So past consent doesn't imply future consent. So assuming consent because of prior relations isn't valid.

Looking at the options:

Option B says no because he didn't get explicit consent for this specific encounter. That seems relevant because each encounter needs its own consent.

Option H says no because she was asleep and couldn't consent. That also seems correct because she was unconscious.

Option G says no because it's a strict liability crime. Wait, is rape strict liability? I thought strict liability didn't apply to rape because it's a specific intent crime. So maybe G is incorrect.

Option F says his belief was reasonable based on prior experience. But I think that's not a valid defense because consent must be contemporaneous.

Option J says no because consent can't be assumed from past experiences. That aligns with what I was thinking.

So the viable defenses here would be that he didn't have consent, and his belief doesn't hold because she was asleep.

So the answer should be that his defense isn't viable. Looking at the options, H and B and J and A might be candidates.

Option H directly states that because she was asleep, she couldn't consent. So that's a solid reason.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The scenario involves a man who entered a woman's trailer through an open window, waited in her dark bedroom, and had sexual relations with her while she slept. He claimed a belief that she consented based on their history of consensual relations, but she denied consent for this specific encounter. Rape requires proof that the defendant intended to act without consent. Consent must be given at the time of the act, and past consent does not imply future consent. Additionally, a person who is asleep cannot give consent. The man's belief in consent based on prior relations is not valid, as consent must be contemporaneous. Therefore, his defense is not viable because the woman was asleep and unable to consent.

Answer: H
