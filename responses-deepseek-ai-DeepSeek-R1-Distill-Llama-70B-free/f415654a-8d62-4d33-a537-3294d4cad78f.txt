The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen," 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about revolutions and gender based on the provided passages. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. It asks which observation about revolutions and gender is best supported by the first passage, which is Olympe de Gouges' "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen" from 1791.

Looking at the passage, Olympe de Gouges is addressing women, urging them to wake up and recognize their rights. She mentions that the enslaved man has become free but unjust to his companion, implying that while men gained freedom through the revolution, women did not see the same benefits. She calls out the leaders for their pretensions of superiority and encourages women to oppose them with reason.

So the main point here is that even after a revolution, which presumably brought some changes, women's rights were not adequately addressed. The revolution (in this case, the French Revolution) didn't improve women's status as hoped.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says revolutions are always successful in improving women's status. But the passage suggests the opposite, so A is incorrect.

Option B claims women rarely support revolutions and thus get little benefit. The passage doesn't talk about women's support; it's more about the outcome, so B doesn't seem right.

Option C states women are typically the primary beneficiaries. Again, the passage shows they weren't, so C is out.

Option D says the success of a revolution is determined by its impact on women's rights. That's a possible angle, but the passage isn't making that broad statement. It's more about the lack of benefit to women, not defining revolutionary success.

Option E suggests gains are equally distributed. The passage clearly indicates that's not the case, so E is wrong.

Option F claims revolutions result in immediate gender equality. The passage contradicts this, so F is incorrect.

Option G says revolutionary progressivism doesn't always concern itself with gender equality. This aligns with the passage because despite the revolution, women's rights were neglected. So G looks promising.

Option H says women's rights are always championed by revolutionary leaders. The passage shows leaders didn't do that, so H is wrong.

Option I claims women typically assume leadership roles during revolutions. The passage doesn't discuss leadership roles, so I isn't supported.

So the best answer is G: Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.

The passage by Olympe de Gouges highlights that the French Revolution, while bringing freedom to men, failed to improve women's rights, indicating that revolutionary movements may overlook gender equality. 

Answer: G
