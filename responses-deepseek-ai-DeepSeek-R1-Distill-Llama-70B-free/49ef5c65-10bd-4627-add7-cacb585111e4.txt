Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a psychologist's ethical dilemma. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The scenario is that Dr. Leonard Lykowski has been seeing a client for three sessions. He notices he's feeling hostile towards her because she reminds him of his wife, whom he's currently divorcing. The question is asking what his best course of action should be.

First, I need to think about the ethical principles involved here. I remember that psychologists have a duty to maintain professional boundaries and ensure that their personal issues don't interfere with their clients' treatment. There's also something about countertransference, which is when a therapist's feelings towards the client are influenced by the therapist's own experiences.

So, the options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Consult with another psychologist to determine whether to continue seeing the client. That sounds reasonable because getting a second opinion could help him decide if he can handle the case without his personal issues affecting the therapy.

Option B: Seek personal therapy and continue working with the client. This makes sense because if he's dealing with his own issues, therapy could help him manage his feelings better. But does he continue with the client? I'm not sure if that's the best idea because his feelings might still interfere.

Option C: Refer the client to another therapist after discussing the reason with her. Being honest with the client and referring her elsewhere might be a good option. It's transparent, but I'm not sure if it's necessary to disclose the reason. Maybe just referring her without giving too much detail is better to protect his privacy.

Option D: Recognize it's countertransference and continue. Countertransference is a real phenomenon, but if it's affecting his ability to be objective, he shouldn't just continue. He needs to address it somehow.

Option E: Express hostility during the session. That's definitely wrong. He shouldn't act on those feelings towards the client.

Option F: Terminate without explanation. That might be abrupt and could harm the client's trust in therapy. It's better to handle it with care.

Option G: Discuss personal situation with the client. I think this crosses professional boundaries. The therapy should focus on the client, not the therapist's personal life.

Option H: Ignore his feelings. Ignoring them isn't a solution. They could affect his work without him realizing it.

Option I: Refer without telling the client the reason. This is an option, but it's important to consider if the client needs to know or if it's better for her to continue elsewhere without knowing the reason.

Option J: Ask the client to find another therapist without reason. Similar to I, but perhaps less direct. It might be better to refer than to ask the client to find someone else.

So, considering all of this, the main issue is Dr. Lykowski's personal feelings affecting his ability to treat the client effectively. The ethical guidelines probably require him to take steps to ensure the client receives proper treatment without his biases.

Option C suggests discussing the reason with the client before referring. But ethically, is it appropriate to tell the client that she reminds him of his wife? That might make the client uncomfortable or affect her own feelings. Alternatively, options I and J involve referring without explanation. But is it better to be honest or to protect his privacy?

Wait, another thought: the American Psychological Association's ethical principles mention that psychologists should take care to avoid harming clients and that if their own issues interfere, they should take appropriate action, which might include referring the client to another therapist. So, he should probably refer her.

Now, between options C, I, and J. Option C says discuss the reason with her. Option I says refer without telling. Option J says ask her to find another without reason.

I think it's better to be honest but not necessarily disclose personal details. So maybe he can refer her without going into why, just saying it's in her best interest. Or perhaps he can explain that he's facing some personal issues that might affect their sessions, so he thinks another therapist would be better for her.

But wait, if he tells her the reason, it might involve his personal life, which could blur boundaries. It's probably better to refer without giving the specific reason, to protect both his privacy and the client's feelings.

So, looking back at the options, option C says refer after discussing the reason. That might involve telling her that she reminds him of his wife, which could be awkward. Option I is referring without telling the reason, which is more about protecting privacy but might be less transparent. Option J is asking the client to find another therapist without a reason, which might be less professional than a direct referral.

The best course would be to refer the client to another therapist. Among the options, C suggests discussing the reason, which might not be necessary. Option I and J involve not telling the reason. But in practice, the referral should be done without unnecessary disclosure. So perhaps the best option is to refer the client without giving the specific reason, which would be option I or J.

Wait, option C says refer after discussing the reason with her. If he discusses the reason, he might have to tell her about his personal situation, which could be inappropriate. So maybe the better approach is to refer her without explaining, which would be option I: refer without telling her the reason.

Alternatively, another approach is to seek consultation (option A) to determine whether he can continue. If he's unsure, consulting another professional might help him decide. But if his feelings are already causing hostility, perhaps he should stop seeing her.

Another thought: if he continues, his countertransference could negatively impact the therapy. So, the best action is to refer her to another therapist. So which option is that?

Looking back, option C is about discussing the reason. Option I is referring without telling. Option J is asking the client to find another without reason.

I think the correct answer is option C. Wait, no, because discussing his personal reasons might not be appropriate. Alternatively, option A is consulting another psychologist to decide. That could be a good first step.

Wait, the question is about the best course of action. So, perhaps the first step is to consult with another psychologist, as in option A, to get an objective opinion on whether he can continue working with the client or should refer her.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If a therapist realizes that their personal feelings are interfering, the ethical guidelines suggest that they should take steps to ensure the client's well-being, which may include referring the client to another therapist if the interference is significant.

So, in this case, Dr. Lykowski is feeling hostile, which is a strong emotion. It's likely affecting his ability to be objective and effective. Therefore, the best action is to refer the client to another therapist.

Between the options, option C says refer after discussing the reason. But is it necessary or appropriate to discuss the reason with the client? I'm not sure. It might be better to refer without giving the reason to protect both parties' privacy.

Option I says refer without telling the client the reason. That seems appropriate because it maintains professional boundaries without disclosing personal information.

Wait, but option C says discuss the reason with her. So, in that case, he would tell her why he's referring her, which might be honest but could also make her uncomfortable. It's a tricky balance.

Another approach: the correct ethical action is to refer the client without explanation, which would be option I. However, some might argue that being transparent is better, but transparency doesn't require disclosing personal details.

Wait, but the question is about the best course of action. The options are:

A: Consult another psychologist to decide whether to continue.

B: Seek personal therapy and continue.

C: Refer after discussing the reason.

D: Continue, recognizing countertransference.

E: Express hostility.

F: Terminate without explanation.

G: Discuss personal situation.

H: Ignore feelings.

I: Refer without telling reason.

J: Ask client to find another without reason.

I think the correct answer is either A or I. Because option A suggests consulting, which is a good step, but the question is about the best action after realizing the issue. So perhaps the immediate best action is to refer the client.

Wait, but if he can manage his feelings through personal therapy, as in option B, that might be another approach. However, if his feelings are too strong, it's better to refer.

In the given scenario, he's feeling hostile, which is a significant issue. So, perhaps the best action is to refer the client to another therapist. So, looking at options, I think the correct answer is C or I.

But I'm a bit torn. Let me think about what the ethical guidelines say. According to APA ethics, when a psychologist's personal issues interfere with their effectiveness, they should take appropriate measures, such as seeking consultation or referring the client.

So, perhaps the best first step is to consult with another psychologist (option A). But if he's certain his feelings are too strong, he should refer.

The question is after three sessions, so he's already started. If he's feeling hostile, it's better to stop seeing her. So, perhaps the best action is to refer her to another therapist without giving the reason (option I) or after discussing (option C).

But discussing the reason might involve telling her about his wife, which could be inappropriate. So, perhaps the better option is to refer without explanation, which is option I.

Wait, but option C says refer after discussing the reason with her. That might be more transparent but could also be problematic. So, which is better?

Alternatively, option A: consult with another psychologist. That might help him decide whether to continue or refer. So, option A could be the first step before deciding.

But the question is what is the best course of action. So, if he's aware that his feelings are interfering, the best action is to refer the client, perhaps without giving the reason.

So, the correct answer would be option C or I.

Wait, another angle: the question says he realizes he's feeling hostile because she reminds him of his wife. This is classic countertransference. The correct handling of countertransference is to recognize it and manage it, perhaps through personal therapy or consultation. But if it's too severe, he should refer.

So, option D says recognize it's countertransference and continue. But if the countertransference is causing hostility, he shouldn't continue. So option D is not correct.

Option B is seeking personal therapy and continuing. That might be possible, but if his feelings are too strong, it's better to refer.

So, putting it all together, the best course is to refer the client to another therapist. The options for that are C, I, or J.

Between them, referring without telling the reason (I) is probably better than telling her (C), as it maintains professionalism without unnecessary disclosure.

Wait, but option C says discuss the reason with her. That might involve telling her about his personal issues, which isn't appropriate. So, better to refer without explanation, which is option I.

Alternatively, option J says ask the client to find another therapist without providing a reason. That's similar to I but perhaps less direct.

I think the better option is to refer the client to another therapist without telling her the reason, which is option I.

Wait, but another thought: when referring, it's better to explain that it's in the client's best interest without going into personal details. So perhaps the correct approach is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is option A: consult with another psychologist to determine whether to continue. Because he might not be sure whether he can handle it, so consulting is a good step.

But the question is about what he should do after realizing his feelings. So, the immediate action is either to refer or to consult.

I think the correct answer is option C: refer after discussing the reason. Because transparency is important, but perhaps he doesn't need to disclose his personal life. Alternatively, he could say that he feels it's best for her to see someone else without explaining why, which would be option I.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me try to recall what I learned. In such cases, the therapist should prioritize the client's well-being. If personal issues interfere, the therapist should refer the client. The referral should be done respectfully, without necessarily disclosing personal reasons.

So, the best action is to refer the client to another therapist without telling her the reason, which is option I.

Wait, but another point: option C says refer after discussing the reason with her. That could mean he tells her that he's going through a divorce and that's why he's referring her. But that's his personal issue, and it's not appropriate to share that with the client.

Therefore, option I is better because it avoids disclosing personal information. So, the answer should be option C or I.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option C. No, wait. No, because discussing the reason might involve his personal life, which is not appropriate. So the better option is I: refer without telling the reason.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to seek consultation first (option A), then decide. But the question is about what he should do now, after realizing his feelings.

I think the best answer is option C: refer after discussing the reason with her. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, option I is better.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: seek personal therapy and continue. But if his feelings are too strong, that's not advisable. He should refer.

I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is option C. No, wait. I think the correct answer is option C: refer after discussing the reason with her. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I: refer without telling the reason.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake. The correct answer is option C. No, I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently.

In therapy, when a therapist experiences countertransference that's too strong, they should refer the client. The ethical guidelines suggest that. So, he should refer her. Now, whether to tell her the reason or not. It's not necessary to disclose his personal issues, so he can refer her without explaining why, which is option I.

So, the best answer is option I.

Wait, but I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me think again. The options are:

C: refer after discussing the reason.

I: refer without telling the reason.

Which is better? It's better to be honest but without over-sharing. So, perhaps he can say something like, "I feel that another therapist might be a better fit for you at this time," without going into details. That would fall under option I.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the best course of action is to refer the client to another therapist without telling her the reason, which is option I.

Dr. Leonard Lykowski is facing an ethical dilemma where his personal feelings of hostility toward a client, stemming from her resemblance to his wife during a divorce, are interfering with his ability to provide effective therapy. The question asks for the best course of action to ensure the client receives proper treatment while maintaining professional boundaries.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Consult with another psychologist**  
   Consulting another psychologist could provide an objective perspective on whether Dr. Lykowski can continue working with the client. However, the question focuses on the immediate best action after realizing the issue, and consulting may not directly address the need to ensure the client's well-being.

2. **Option B: Seek personal therapy and continue working with the client**  
   While seeking personal therapy is a good step for managing Dr. Lykowski's feelings, continuing to work with the client while experiencing hostility may not be in the client's best interest. This option risks ongoing interference from unresolved personal issues.

3. **Option C: Refer the client to another therapist after discussing the reason with her**  
   Referring the client is appropriate, but discussing the reason (e.g., that she reminds him of his wife) could blur professional boundaries and make the client uncomfortable. This option raises concerns about appropriateness and transparency.

4. **Option D: Recognize countertransference and continue working with the client**  
   While recognizing countertransference is important, continuing to work with the client despite strong feelings of hostility is not advisable. This could negatively impact the therapeutic relationship and the client's treatment.

5. **Option E: Express hostility toward the client during the session**  
   This is clearly unethical and harmful. Expressing hostility would violate professional standards and damage the client's trust.

6. **Option F: Terminate the therapy sessions without any explanation**  
   Abrupt termination without explanation could harm the client's trust in therapy and is not a responsible approach. It is better to handle the situation with care and professionalism.

7. **Option G: Discuss his personal situation with the client to create transparency**  
   While transparency is important, discussing Dr. Lykowski's personal life with the client crosses professional boundaries and shifts the focus from the client's needs to the therapist's personal issues.

8. **Option H: Ignore his feelings and continue working with the client**  
   Ignoring his feelings is not a solution, as unresolved countertransference could unconsciously affect his interactions with the client and compromise the therapy.

9. **Option I: Refer the client to another therapist without telling the client the reason for the referral**  
   Referring the client to another therapist is the most appropriate action to ensure the client receives unbiased and effective treatment. Not disclosing the reason protects Dr. Lykowski's privacy and avoids unnecessary discomfort for the client.

10. **Option J: Ask the client to find another therapist without providing a reason**  
    While similar to Option I, this approach is less direct and professional. It is better for the therapist to take the initiative to refer the client rather than asking the client to find another therapist.

### Conclusion:
The best course of action is to refer the client to another therapist without disclosing the personal reason, as this maintains professional boundaries, protects the client's well-being, and adheres to ethical guidelines. This corresponds to **Option I**.

Answer: I
