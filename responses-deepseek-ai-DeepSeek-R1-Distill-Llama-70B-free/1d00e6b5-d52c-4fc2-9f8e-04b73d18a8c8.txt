Okay, so I've got this question about life insurance, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Mr. Ozaku who took out a $5,000 ordinary life insurance policy. He's 20 now and will pay semiannual premiums until he's 75. I need to find out two things: how much he'll pay in total premiums, and how much his beneficiary will receive if he dies.

First, I should recall what an ordinary life insurance policy typically is. I think ordinary life insurance is the same as whole life insurance. In that case, the policy provides a death benefit and has a cash value component. The premiums are usually fixed and paid regularly.

Wait, the question says it's an ordinary life policy, which I believe is another term for whole life. So, the key here is that the premiums are paid for a certain number of years, and the policy stays in force until death, as long as premiums are paid.

Now, the first part is calculating the total premiums paid. Mr. Ozaku is 20 and will pay until 75. So the number of years he'll pay is 75 minus 20, which is 55 years. But wait, he's paying semiannual premiums. So each year, he makes two payments.

So the total number of payments is 55 years * 2 payments per year = 110 payments.

But wait, the question says he's paying until age 75. So from age 20 to 75 is 55 years. So semiannual would be 55*2=110 payments.

But wait, I don't know the amount of each premium. Hmm, but the options don't give me that. Hmm. Wait, maybe this is a level premium policy, and the total premium amount is based on the face value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question asks how much he will pay in premiums. So I need to compute the total amount paid over the 55 years.

Wait, but without knowing the premium per period, how can I calculate total? Oh, perhaps the options are structured in a way that the total premium is simply the number of payments times the premium per period. But without knowing the premium per period, I can't calculate it directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the policy is such that the total premiums paid minus the cost would be the death benefit. Or maybe it's a term life policy. Wait, no, the question says it's an ordinary life insurance policy, which is usually whole life, so it's permanent coverage.

Wait, but in whole life, part of the premium goes into the cash value, and part goes to the death benefit. But wait, the death benefit in a whole life policy is fixed, right? So in this case, the death benefit is $5,000, which is the amount the beneficiary would receive.

Wait, the question states that he took out a $5,000 policy. So the death benefit is $5,000. So when he dies, regardless of when, the beneficiary gets $5,000.

But looking at the options, some have more than $5k as death benefit. So that can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says it's an ordinary life insurance policy. I think in ordinary life insurance, the premiums are paid for a certain period, and the death benefit is paid upon death. But perhaps in this case, it's a term life policy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe this is a limited payment life insurance policy, where the premiums are paid for a certain number of years, and then the policy remains in force without further premiums. But the question says he pays until he's 75, so perhaps it's just a whole life policy where he pays until 75, but that's unusual because whole life typically requires premiums until age 100 or the death of the insured.

Hmm, maybe this is an endowment policy? No, endowment policies have a set term and pay out the sum if the person survives.

Wait, perhaps the question is simpler. Let me re-read it.

He's 20, took a $5k ordinary life policy. Pays semiannual until 75. How much in premiums? And if he dies, how much does beneficiary get?

Wait, perhaps the question is just about the total premiums paid, which is the face amount plus some interest or something.

Wait, but I don't have the interest rate. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps the total premium is simply the number of payments times the premium per period. But without knowing the premium per period, I can't compute it. Unless the policy is such that the total premiums equal the death benefit, which doesn't make sense because insurance companies make money.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. Maybe it's a term life policy, and the $5,000 is the death benefit, so the beneficiary gets that. But the premium he pays each time, for 55 years, twice a year. But without knowing the premium, how can I find the total?

Wait, maybe the premium is calculated as the face amount divided by the number of payments. So 5000 divided by 110 payments. That would be about 45.45 per semiannual payment. But then total paid would be 5000. So the total premiums would be $5,000, and the death benefit is $5,000. But looking at the options, option I says $4,801.50 and $5k. Option E is $5k and $4,801.50. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 20-pay life policy, but the question says until 75, which is 55 years, so 110 payments.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the two parts. The total amount paid is the sum of all the premiums. The death benefit is $5,000. So looking at the options, the death benefit is either $5,000 or higher. Let me check the options:

Option A: 7k and 5k. So death benefit is 5k.

Option B: 6750 and 5250. Death benefit 5250.

Option C: 4500 and 4000.

Option D:5500 and 5k.

Option E:5k and 4801.5.

Option F:4500 and 5500.

Option G:6k and 6500.

Option H:5500 and 4500.

Option I:4801.5 and 5k.

Option J:5250 and 5750.

So the death benefit is $5k in options A, D, E, I.

But the question says it's a $5,000 policy, so the death benefit is $5k. So the correct answer should have death benefit as $5k, so those options are A, D, E, I.

Now, the total premium paid would be the number of payments times the premium per period. But I don't know the premium per period. Hmm. Unless the policy is such that the sum of premiums equals the death benefit. But that can't be, because then the insurance company wouldn't make any money. So perhaps the policy is a term policy where the total premiums are more than the death benefit, but in that case, the death benefit is fixed.

Wait, perhaps this is a whole life policy, and the total premiums paid are calculated as the annual premium multiplied by the number of years. But without knowing the annual premium, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is a simple one. The policy is $5k, so the beneficiary gets $5k. So from the options, the death benefit is $5k in A, D, E, I.

Now, the total premiums: from age 20 to 75 is 55 years. He pays semiannually, so 110 payments. If each payment is, say, $50, then total is 5500, which is option D: $5,500 and $5k. Or if it's $45 per payment, 45*110=4950, which isn't an option. Alternatively, let me think of the options. The possible total premiums are $4,801.50 (option I), $5,000 (option E), $5,500 (D), $7,000 (A), etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the total premium is the present value of the death benefit. But that calculation requires an interest rate, which isn't provided.

Wait, perhaps the policy is a term life for 55 years. So he's paying for 55 years, semiannual. So 110 payments. But without knowing the premium, I can't compute. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single premium, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe it's a 20-year policy, but the question says until age 75, so 55 years. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a whole life policy, and the total premiums paid would be higher than the death benefit. The death benefit is $5k, so the total premium would be higher. So looking at the options, options A and D have higher total premiums.

Option A: total premium $7k, death $5k.

Option D: total $5,500, death $5k.

So which makes more sense? Well, 110 payments. If each payment is $50, total is $5,500 (option D). That seems plausible. So the total would be 50 * 110=5,500.

So then, the correct answer would have total premium 5,500 and death benefit 5,000. So option D.

But wait, let me check. If he's paying $50 every six months for 55 years. 55 * 2 = 110 payments. 50 *110=5,500.

Yes, so the total is $5,500, and the death benefit is $5,000.

Looking at the options:

Option D: $5,500 and $5,000. So that's the one.

But wait, let me think again. Because in a whole life policy, the premium is usually higher than what's needed to pay the death benefit, because part goes to cash value. So the total premiums would be higher than the death benefit. So in this case, $5,500 is higher than $5k, which makes sense.

So the correct answer would be option D.

To determine how much Mr. Ozaku will pay in premiums and how much his beneficiary will receive, we analyze the given information:

1. **Policy Type**: The question specifies an "ordinary life insurance policy," which is typically a whole life insurance policy. This means the death benefit is fixed at $5,000, and the premiums are paid for a specified period.

2. **Premium Payment Details**: Mr. Ozaku is 20 years old and will pay semiannual premiums until age 75. This means the payment period is 55 years (75 - 20). Since he pays semiannually, the total number of payments is:
   \[
   55 \, \text{years} \times 2 \, \text{payments per year} = 110 \, \text{payments}.
   \]

3. **Death Benefit**: The policy's death benefit is explicitly stated as $5,000. This is the amount the beneficiary will receive if Mr. Ozaku dies.

4. **Total Premiums Paid**: The question does not provide the exact premium amount per payment. However, based on the options, we can infer that the total premiums paid must be higher than the death benefit, as is typical for whole life insurance policies (where part of the premium contributes to the cash value). Among the options, only those with a death benefit of $5,000 are plausible, as the policy explicitly states a $5,000 death benefit.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Total premiums = $7,000, Death benefit = $5,000. This is plausible but does not match the expected total premiums for 110 payments.
   - **Option D**: Total premiums = $5,500, Death benefit = $5,000. This aligns with the expected total premiums if each semiannual payment is $50 (50 × 110 = $5,500).
   - Other options either have incorrect death benefits or implausible total premiums.

Thus, the most consistent answer is **Option D**, where Mr. Ozaku pays a total of $5,500 in premiums, and his beneficiary receives $5,000 upon his death.

Answer: D
