Okay, so I've got this question here about Mach number and the speed of a jet plane. Hmm, I remember that Mach number relates to the speed of sound, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the speed of sound at sea level is approximately 750 miles per hour. Oh wait, I think I've heard that number before, but sometimes I get confused with kilometers. Anyway, the given value is 750 mph, so I'll go with that.

The jet plane is traveling at Mach 2.2. So, what does Mach number mean again? Oh right, Mach number is the ratio of the object's speed to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. So Mach 1 is the speed of sound, Mach 2 is twice that, and so on. So the formula should be something like: speed = Mach number * speed of sound.

Let me write that down. So speed = Mach * speed_of_sound. Given that, the speed here would be 2.2 multiplied by 750 mph.

Wait, let me do the math. 2 times 750 is 1500, and 0.2 times 750 is 150. So 1500 + 150 equals 1650. So the speed would be 1650 mph.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option F is 1650 mph. So that should be the answer. But wait, are there any tricks here? Like, is the speed of sound given in a different unit that I need to convert? Oh, the question says it's in miles per hour, so no conversion needed. So I think I'm good.

I don't think I missed anything. The calculation seems straightforward. So yeah, the correct answer should be F: 1650 mph.

The speed of a jet traveling at Mach 2.2 is calculated by multiplying the Mach number by the speed of sound at sea level. Given that the speed of sound is 750 mph, the calculation is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \text{Mach Number} \times \text{Speed of Sound} = 2.2 \times 750 = 1650 \, \text{mph}.
\]

From the provided options, the correct answer is **F: 1650 mph**.
