Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the film "Easy Rider." The question is asking about the emblem on the back of Peter Fonda's leather jacket in the movie. The options are A through J, each with different symbols.

First, I remember that "Easy Rider" is a classic 1969 film that's part of the counterculture movement of the 60s. It's about two bikers traveling across the US, right? The main characters are played by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper.

Peter Fonda's character, I think his name is Wyatt, has a very iconic leather jacket. I've seen pictures of it before. The jacket is a significant part of the movie's imagery. Now, what's on the back? I'm trying to visualize it. I recall that the jacket had some kind of emblem, maybe something related to freedom or rebellion.

Let me think about the options. Option B is a peace symbol. That makes sense because the late 60s were all about the peace movement, especially with the Vietnam War protests. But wait, another option is E, the American flag. I remember seeing the jacket with an American flag design. Or was it something else?

Wait, no, the jacket had the American flag on it. I think that's correct. Peter Fonda's character's jacket was a stars and stripes design. It's become such an iconic image that it's often referenced in popular culture. So the emblem would be the American flag, which is option E.

But let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Option C is a star-spangled banner, which is similar to the flag. Option G is a bald eagle, which is another American symbol. But I'm pretty sure it's the flag itself, not just a part of it.

Another thought: the jacket also had some other details, like fringe maybe, but the main emblem was the flag. So I think E is the right answer.
