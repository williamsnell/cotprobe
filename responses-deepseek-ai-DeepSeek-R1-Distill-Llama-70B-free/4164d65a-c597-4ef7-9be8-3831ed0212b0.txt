Okay, so I have this question about defining "learning." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me ten options, from A to J. I need to pick the correct one. Let's see what I remember about learning. I think learning is about changing behavior based on experience or practice. But wait, I should be careful because some options might seem similar.

Option A says learning is a change in behavior without practice or experience. That doesn't sound right because I remember that practice or experience are key parts of learning. So A is probably wrong.

Option B mentions an involuntary physiological response. That sounds more like a reflex, not learning. Like when you pull your hand back from something hot without thinking. So B isn't it.

Option C says it's a temporary change. But wait, learning is supposed to be more permanent, right? Like once you learn to ride a bike, you don't forget it easily. So C might not be correct.

Option D states it's a relatively permanent change from practice or experience. That rings a bell. Yeah, I think that's the standard definition. Learning leads to lasting changes, not temporary ones, and it's based on practice or what you experience.

Option E talks about a decrease in response to stimuli over time. Oh, that's habituation, a type of learning, but not the definition of learning itself. So E is a specific kind, not the general definition.

Option F is about periodic shifts in thinking. I don't recall that being part of learning. It sounds more like something else, maybe cognitive changes over time, but not the core concept of learning.

Option G says it's acquiring skills through genetics. That's more about instinct or inherited traits, not learning. Learning is about acquiring knowledge through experience, not just from genes.

Option H is a short-term adaptation without lasting effects. That's more like conditioning or temporary changes, which isn't the same as learning, which should be more permanent.

Option I is about memorizing facts. While memorization is part of learning, it's not the whole definition. Learning also involves understanding and applying knowledge, not just memorizing.

Option J talks about downloading info directly. That sounds like science fiction, like The Matrix. In reality, learning is a process of absorbing and processing information, not just downloading it.

Putting it all together, the best fit is option D. It correctly states that learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior due to practice or experience.

The correct answer is D: Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior resulting from conditions of practice or experience.

Answer: D
