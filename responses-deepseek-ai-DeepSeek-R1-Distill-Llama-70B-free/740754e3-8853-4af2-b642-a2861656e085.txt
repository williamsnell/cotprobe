Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about balancing chemical equations by filling in the missing species and their coefficients. There are three parts: (a), (b), and (c). Each part has a reaction that's missing some components. I need to pick the correct options from the given choices A through J.

Let me start by breaking down each part.

Part (a) is NaOH + _____ → NaHSO4 + HOH. I think this is an acid-base reaction. NaOH is a strong base, and NaHSO4 is sodium bisulfate. HOH is just water. So the missing species here is probably an acid that reacts with NaOH to produce NaHSO4 and water. Since NaHSO4 is the salt, the acid would be H2SO4, sulfuric acid, because NaOH (a base) reacting with H2SO4 (an acid) would form Na2SO4, but wait, no, wait, bisulfate is HSO4^-.

Wait, NaOH and H2SO4 reacting... Let's think. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is a diprotic acid. So in the first step, it donates a proton to NaOH. So NaOH + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + H2O. That makes sense because it's a neutralization reaction where the base accepts a proton from the acid. So the missing species is H2SO4. So for part (a), the blank is H2SO4.

Moving on to part (b): PCl3 + __ HOH → _____ + 3HCl. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. PCl3 is phosphorus trichloride. I think this might be a hydrolysis reaction. When PCl3 reacts with water, it typically forms H3PO3 (phosphorous acid) and HCl. The reaction is PCl3 + 3 H2O → H3PO3 + 3 HCl. So the blank before HOH is 3 H2O, and the product is H3PO3. But looking back, the equation given is PCl3 + __ HOH → _____ + 3HCl. So the missing species in the blank is water, and the other product is H3PO3. So the second blank is H3PO3. Wait, because the question is about the species missing. So the first blank is 3 H2O, but in the equation, it's written as HOH, which is H2O. So the coefficient would be 3 before HOH.

Wait, the way the equation is written: PCl3 + some HOH → something + 3HCl. So the number of HCl is 3, so the other product must have 3 H from the PCl3. Let's see, PCl3 has P in +3 oxidation state. In H3PO3, P is +3 as well, so that makes sense. So the products are H3PO3 and 3 HCl. So the missing species (the product) is H3PO3.

Now part (c): CH4 + ____ → CCl4 + 4HCl. CH4 is methane reacting to form carbon tetrachloride and HCl. This is probably a substitution reaction where methane reacts with Cl2 in the presence of light. The reaction is CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl. But wait, in the given equation, the blank is before Cl2. Because the reactant is CH4 plus something. So the missing species is Cl2, and the coefficient is 4. Wait, no—wait, the way the equation is written: CH4 + ____ → CCl4 + 4 HCl. So the blank is for Cl2, and the coefficient would be 4, because each CH4 reacts with 4 Cl2 molecules. So the coefficient is 4 Cl2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes, the coefficients might need balancing. Let me think again. Methane has four hydrogens. Each substitution replaces a hydrogen with Cl, which would require Cl2. So for each substitution, you use one Cl2 molecule because each Cl2 provides two Cl atoms, but each substitution only uses one Cl. Wait, no—each substitution of one H in CH4 with Cl uses one Cl atom, but each Cl2 molecule provides two Cl atoms. So for four substitutions, you need four Cl atoms, which would come from two Cl2 molecules. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, no. The reaction of methane with Cl2 is a chain reaction, and each molecule of CH4 can react with up to four molecules of Cl2, producing one CCl4 and four HCl. So the correct equation is CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl. So the coefficient is 4 Cl2.

Wait, but that's a lot of Cl2. Let me make sure. Each substitution of H with Cl in CH4 requires one Cl2 molecule per substitution because each substitution replaces one H, and each Cl2 provides two Cl atoms for two substitution steps. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me think of the mechanism. Methane reacts with Cl2 under certain conditions, and each H can be replaced by Cl. Each substitution consumes one Cl2 molecule because each substitution requires two Cl atoms: one to replace the H, and the other as a byproduct. No, wait, each substitution actually uses one Cl2, but for each substitution, two Cl atoms are involved.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to write the balanced equation. Let's count the atoms.

On the left: CH4 has 4 H and 1 C. Cl2 is Cl2.

On the right: CCl4 has 4 Cl and 1 C. 4 HCl has 4 H and 4 Cl.

So, for Cl: On the left, each Cl2 is 2 Cl atoms. On the right: 4 Cl in CCl4 and 4 Cl in HCl, total 8 Cl atoms.

So, number of Cl2 molecules needed: 8 Cl atoms → 4 Cl2 molecules. So the equation is CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl.

Wait, that's correct. So for part (c), the missing species is Cl2 with a coefficient of 4.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option provides three parts corresponding to (a), (b), (c). So for (a), the missing species is H2SO4; for (b), the missing species before HOH is 3 H2O (since PCl3 + 3 H2O → H3PO3 + 3 HCl), so the blank before HOH is 3, and the product is H3PO3. For (c), the missing species is 4 Cl2.

So looking at the options:

Option E: (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)3, (c) 4 Cl2.

Wait, Option E is (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)3, (c) 4 Cl2.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)3, (c) 2 Cl2.

Option E: (a) H2SO4, (b) P(OH)3, (c) 4 Cl2.

Wait, but I thought (c) requires 4 Cl2. So that would point to option E.

Wait, but I should double-check.

Wait, for part (b), the reaction is PCl3 + HOH → ... + 3 HCl. The correct product is H3PO3, which is P(OH)3. So the missing product is P(OH)3, so the blank is that. And the HOH is 3, so in the blank before HOH, it's 3. So for (b), the first blank is 3, and the product is P(OH)3.

So, in the options, part (b) for option E is P(OH)3. So that fits.

For (a), it's H2SO4, so the correct option would be E.

Wait, but looking at option E: H2SO4, P(OH)3, 4 Cl2.

So, yes, that seems correct.

So the correct answer is E.

To balance the given chemical equations, we analyze each part as follows:

**(a)** The reaction is **NaOH + _____ → NaHSO₄ + HOH**. This is an acid-base neutralization reaction. Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄) and water (H₂O). The missing species is **H₂SO₄**.

**(b)** The reaction is **PCl₃ + __ HOH → _____ + 3HCl**. Phosphorus trichloride (PCl₃) undergoes hydrolysis with water to form phosphorous acid (H₃PO₃) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The balanced reaction is **PCl₃ + 3H₂O → H₃PO₃ + 3HCl**. Thus, the missing species is **3H₂O**, and the product is **H₃PO₃**.

**(c)** The reaction is **CH₄ + ____ → CCl₄ + 4HCl**. Methane (CH₄) reacts with chlorine gas (Cl₂) in a substitution reaction to form carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). The balanced reaction is **CH₄ + 4Cl₂ → CCl₄ + 4HCl**. The missing species is **4Cl₂**.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

- **(a)** H₂SO₄  
- **(b)** P(OH)₃ (H₃PO₃)  
- **(c)** 4Cl₂  

This corresponds to **Option E**.
