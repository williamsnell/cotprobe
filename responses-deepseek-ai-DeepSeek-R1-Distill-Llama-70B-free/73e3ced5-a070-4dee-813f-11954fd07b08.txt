Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which of these options was NOT a guest villain in the 1960s Batman TV series. The options are A through J, each with a different occupation or character name. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Batman show from the 60s was known for its campy humor and the various villains that appeared. Each villain often had a theme related to their name or occupation. For example, the Joker, Penguin, Catwoman were regulars, but there were many others.

Looking at the options:

A: The Painter - I'm not sure about this one. I don't recall a villain specifically named The Painter. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

B: The Plumber - I don't think I've heard of a Plumber villain in the show. That seems a bit odd, but maybe it's a trick.

C: The Librarian - I think there was a Librarian villain. Let me check my memory. Yes, I believe she was played by a guest actress, maybe a woman with a bookish theme.

D: The Minstrel - Oh right, The Minstrel was a villain who used music and lutes as part of his crimes. He appeared in a couple of episodes.

E: The Bookworm - Definitely a villain. He was played by Roddy McDowall, if I remember correctly. His lair was shaped like a book, and he had a book-themed scheme.

F: The Chef - I'm not sure about The Chef. There were some food-themed villains, like The Pie-in-the-Face Man or others, but I don't recall a Chef specifically. Maybe this is the one that's not real.

G: The Squeegee Guy - Hmm, this sounds familiar. Wait, wasn't there a villain named The Squeegee Man? Or maybe it's a variation. I think he used a squeegee as a weapon or part of his motif.

H: The Gardener - There was a villain named The Gardener, I believe. She had plant-based schemes and maybe even a plant-like lair.

I: The Archer - Yes, The Archer was a villain who used a bow and arrow, with a Robin Hood theme. He appeared in a few episodes.

J: The Jester - I'm not sure about this one. Wait, The Jester was a villain in the show, right? Or was that from another Batman series? I think he was played by someone like Jack Gilford or another actor, using a jester theme with jokes and tricks.

Wait, let me go through each again. The ones I'm certain about are D (Minstrel), E (Bookworm), I (Archer), and G (Squeegee). The Librarian (C) I'm pretty sure was a villain too. The Chef (F) I'm not so sure about. I don't remember a Chef villain. The Plumber (B) also doesn't ring a bell. Painter (A) I'm not certain either.

Wait, another thought: The show had a lot of villains with various themes. Let me think about some of the more obscure ones. There was The Clock King, The Mad Hatter, The Riddler, The Puzzler, etc. The Chef... I'm trying to recall if that was a real one. I think I might have heard of The Chef being a villain, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe The Plumber was a character but not a main villain.

Alternatively, I remember that The Bookworm was a recurring villain, so E is definitely real. The Minstrel, D, was a real villain. The Archer, I, yes. The Squeegee guy, G, I think was in one episode. The Librarian, C, I'm pretty sure was a female villain. 

As for The Painter, A, I'm not sure. I don't remember a Painter villain. The Jester, J, I'm a bit confused about. I think The Jester was in the show, but maybe I'm mixing it up with another series. 

Wait, I think the correct answer is B: The Plumber. I don't recall The Plumber being a villain in the 1960s Batman. Alternatively, maybe F: The Chef isn't a villain. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think The Chef was actually a villain. He was played by a guest star, maybe in an episode involving a restaurant or food scheme. So if F is real, then the fake one would be B: The Plumber. Because I can't think of a Plumber villain from that show.

Alternatively, maybe The Squeegee Guy is the fake one. Wait, no, I'm pretty sure The Squeegee Man was a villain. So then, the Plumber must be the one that's not a guest villain.

So putting it all together, the answer should be B: The Plumber.
