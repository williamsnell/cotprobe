Okay, so I've got this physics question about the escape velocity. Hmm, I remember that escape velocity is the speed an object needs to break free from a celestial body's gravity without any further propulsion. The question gives me the gravitational constant G, the mass M of the body, and its radius R. I need to pick the correct formula from the options given.

Wait, how do I derive the escape velocity formula? I think it's based on the idea that the kinetic energy of the escaping object has to overcome the gravitational potential energy holding it back. So, the kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv², and the gravitational potential energy (PE) is -GMm/R. But wait, since the object is escaping, the potential energy becomes zero at infinity. So the PE near the surface is negative, but we can think of the work needed to move it to infinity as the positive value.

So setting KE equal to the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy: (1/2)mv² = GMm/R. Oh wait, but I'm not sure about the signs here. The gravitational potential energy is negative, so the KE needs to be enough to make the total energy zero at infinity. So maybe the correct equation is (1/2)mv² = GMm/R. Because when you escape, your kinetic energy equals the gravitational binding energy.

Wait, let me think again. The work done to move the object from the surface to infinity is the integral of the gravitational force over distance. Gravitational force is F = GMm/r². So the work done W is the integral from R to infinity of F dr. That integral is GMm (1/R - 0) )= GMm/R. So the work done by gravity is negative, meaning the object gains kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy required is equal to the gravitational potential energy but positive.

So equate 1/2 mv² to GMm/R. The m's cancel out, so v² = 2GM/R. Taking the square root, v equals sqrt(2GM/R). Oh wait, but let me look at the options. Option C is sqrt(2GM/R). Option E is sqrt(GM/R). So it seems option C is correct.

Wait, but another way I've heard it explained is using the concept of orbital velocity. The escape velocity is sqrt(2) times the orbital velocity at the surface. Because the orbital velocity v_orb is sqrt(GM/R). So escape velocity would be sqrt(2) times that, making it sqrt(2GM/R). That also points to option C.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option A is 2sqrt(GM/R), which is twice the orbital velocity, not the escape velocity. Option B is sqrt(GM/(2R)), which is half the orbital velocity. That doesn't seem right. Option E is just the orbital velocity. Option J is sqrt(2GM) which doesn't have R, so that can't be right because escape velocity depends on both mass and radius. So yeah, option C is correct.

The escape velocity is the speed required for an object to overcome the gravitational pull of a celestial body and move to infinity. It is derived by equating the kinetic energy of the object to the gravitational potential energy it needs to overcome. The kinetic energy is given by \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), and the gravitational potential energy near the surface of the celestial body is \( -\frac{GMm}{R} \). Setting these equal (and ignoring the negative sign for potential energy), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{R}.
\]

Canceling \( m \) and solving for \( v^2 \), we find:

\[
v^2 = \frac{2GM}{R}.
\]

Taking the square root gives:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}.
\]

This matches option C. Other options are incorrect because:

- Option A (\( 2\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \)) is twice the orbital velocity, not the escape velocity.
- Option B (\( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{2R}} \)) is half the orbital velocity.
- Option E (\( \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} \)) is the orbital velocity, not the escape velocity.
- Option J (\( \sqrt{2GM} \)) does not depend on \( R \), which is incorrect.

Thus, the correct formula for the escape velocity is:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}.
\]
