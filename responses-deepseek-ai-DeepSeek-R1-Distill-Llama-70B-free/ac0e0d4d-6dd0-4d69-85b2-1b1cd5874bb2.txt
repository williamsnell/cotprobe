Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's a net force F_A acting on object A, and another net force F_B on object B. The mass of object B is twice the mass of object A. Also, the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A. I need to find out the relationship between F_A and F_B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember from Newton's laws that force equals mass times acceleration, F = ma. So each force can be expressed in terms of the mass and acceleration of each object.

Let me write down what I know. For object A, the force F_A equals mass of A (m_A) multiplied by acceleration of A (a_A). So F_A = m_A * a_A. Similarly, for object B, F_B = m_B * a_B.

The problem states that m_B is twice m_A. So m_B = 2 * m_A. And the acceleration of B is twice that of A, so a_B = 2 * a_A.

I need to find a relationship between F_B and F_A. Let me substitute the given values into the equations.

F_A = m_A * a_A.

F_B = m_B * a_B = (2 m_A) * (2 a_A).

Let me compute that. 2 times 2 is 4, so F_B = 4 * m_A * a_A.

Wait a second, m_A * a_A is F_A. So F_B = 4 * F_A.

Looking at the options, option C says F_B = 4 F_A. So that's the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should go through it again.

F_A is m_A * a_A.

F_B is (2 m_A) * (2 a_A) = 4 m_A a_A. Since m_A a_A is F_A, that's 4 F_A. Yep, that seems right.

So the correct option should be C.

To solve the problem, we use Newton's second law, which states that force equals mass times acceleration, \( F = ma \). 

For object A, the force is given by:
\[
F_A = m_A \cdot a_A
\]
For object B, the force is:
\[
F_B = m_B \cdot a_B
\]

The problem specifies that \( m_B = 2m_A \) and \( a_B = 2a_A \). Substituting these values into the equation for \( F_B \):
\[
F_B = (2m_A) \cdot (2a_A) = 4m_A \cdot a_A
\]

Since \( m_A \cdot a_A = F_A \), we can rewrite this as:
\[
F_B = 4F_A
\]

Thus, the relationship between the forces is \( F_B = 4F_A \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
