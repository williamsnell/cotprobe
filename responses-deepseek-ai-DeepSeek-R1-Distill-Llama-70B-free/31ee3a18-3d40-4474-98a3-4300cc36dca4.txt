Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Smart Calculator Corp. and their costs. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that total costs are made up of fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are the expenses that don't change with the number of units produced, like rent or salaries. Variable costs, on the other hand, do change with production levels, such as materials or labor costs per unit.

The problem states that when they produce 700 calculators, the total cost is $15,700. And when they make 1,000 calculators, the total cost goes up to $16,000. I need to find out what the variable cost per calculator is and what the fixed cost is.

I think the approach here is to set up a system of equations. Let me denote the fixed cost as FC and the variable cost per unit as VC. So the total cost (TC) would be FC plus VC multiplied by the number of units (Q).

So for 700 calculators:
TC1 = FC + VC * 700 = $15,700.

For 1,000 calculators:
TC2 = FC + VC * 1000 = $16,000.

Now I have two equations with two variables, FC and VC. I can solve them using substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.

If I subtract the first equation from the second, the FC terms will cancel out. Let's try that.

TC2 - TC1 = (FC + 1000VC) - (FC + 700VC) 
$16,000 - $15,700 = 300VC
$300 = 300VC

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, 16,000 minus 15,700 is actually 300. So 300 = 300VC. So VC would be 300 / 300 = $1 per calculator. Oh, that makes sense.

So the variable cost is $1 per calculator. Now I can plug this back into one of the equations to find the fixed cost. Let's use the first equation.

TC1 = FC + (VC * 700)
15,700 = FC + (1 * 700)
15,700 = FC + 700
So FC = 15,700 - 700 = 15,000.

So the fixed cost is $15,000 and the variable cost is $1 per calculator. Let me check the options to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options, option B says variable cost $1 and fixed cost $15,000. Option I has variable cost $2 and fixed cost $15,000, so that's not right. Option A's fixed cost is higher than 15k, so no. Option B matches exactly what I found.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me plug in the numbers again. When producing 700 units, fixed is 15k, variable is 700*1=700. Total is 15,700, which matches. For 1000 units: 15k + 1000*1=16k, which also matches. Yep, that's correct.

To determine the variable and fixed costs for the Smart Calculator Corp., we start by defining the total cost (TC) as the sum of fixed costs (FC) and variable costs (VC) per unit multiplied by the number of units produced (Q). The problem provides two data points:

1. When 700 calculators are produced, the total cost is $15,700:
   \[
   TC_1 = FC + VC \cdot 700 = 15,700
   \]

2. When 1,000 calculators are produced, the total cost is $16,000:
   \[
   TC_2 = FC + VC \cdot 1000 = 16,000
   \]

To find the variable cost per calculator (VC), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
TC_2 - TC_1 = (FC + 1000VC) - (FC + 700VC)
\]
\[
16,000 - 15,700 = 300VC
\]
\[
300 = 300VC \implies VC = 1
\]
Thus, the variable cost per calculator is $1.

Next, we substitute \( VC = 1 \) into the first equation to solve for the fixed cost (FC):
\[
15,700 = FC + 1 \cdot 700
\]
\[
FC = 15,700 - 700 = 15,000
\]
The fixed cost is $15,000.

Finally, comparing these results to the options provided, the correct answer is **Option B**, which states: "Variable cost: $1 per calculator, Fixed cost: $15,000."
