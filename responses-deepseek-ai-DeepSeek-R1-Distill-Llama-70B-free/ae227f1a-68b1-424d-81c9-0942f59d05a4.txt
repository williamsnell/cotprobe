Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about thermal stress in an aluminum cylinder. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on thermal expansion and stress calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says an aluminum cylinder is 10 cm long and has a cross-sectional area of 20 cm². It's used as a spacer between two steel walls. At 17.2°C, it just fits. Then it warms up to 22.3°C. The walls are rigid, so they don't move. I need to find the stress in the cylinder and the total force on each wall. The unit is 10^4 N, so the answers will be in multiples of that.

Wait, stress is force per area, right? So stress equals force divided by area. But wait, the question says calculate the stress and the total force. Oh, but the options are single letters, so maybe they're asking for one or the other? Hmm. Let me read the question again. Oh, wait, it says calculate the stress and the total force. So maybe both are calculated, but the options are possible answers, perhaps for one of them. But the options are labeled from A to J, so maybe only one value is expected. Wait, the question says to select from the options, which includes letters A-J. So perhaps it's just the stress or the force.

But wait, the question says "the stress in the cylinder and the total force..." but maybe the options are for the force, or perhaps for the stress. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to find the stress and the force. But the options don't have two answers, so perhaps the question is phrased such that I need to calculate one of them, and the other is dependent. Hmm, perhaps stress is calculated first, then force is stress times area.

Wait, let's get the given data straight.

The cylinder is aluminum. I remember that the coefficient of linear expansion for aluminum is around 23e-6 per °C. Wait, let me think. Yes, I think α for aluminum is about 23 × 10^-6 /°C. Steel's α is lower, but since the walls are rigid and the distance apart is constant, the cylinder's expansion is constrained.

So initially, at 17.2°C, the length is 10 cm. When it heats up to 22.3°C, the temperature change ΔT is 22.3 - 17.2 = 5.1°C.

If unconstrained, the length would increase by ΔL = α * L0 * ΔT. But since the walls are fixed, the cylinder can't expand, so it's under compression. So the change in length is ΔL = α L0 ΔT, but since it's constrained, the actual length remains the same, so we have a strain.

Strain ε is the change in length over original length, but in this case, it's a thermal strain. Since the expansion is prevented, the strain would be negative (compression). So the strain is -α ΔT.

Wait, but the general formula for thermal strain is ε = α (ΔT). But when constrained, the material can't expand, so the resulting strain is ε = -α ΔT because it's compressive.

Wait, no. Wait, if it's allowed to expand, it would have a positive strain. When it's constrained, the strain caused by the expansion is prevented, so the strain is negative. So the resulting strain is ε = -α ΔT.

Then, stress is given by Hooke's law: σ = E * ε. But since ε is negative, stress will be negative, indicating compression.

Wait, but I think I should double-check. Another approach: when the temperature increases, the material wants to expand, but the walls prevent it. So the cylinder is under compressive stress. So the stress would be σ = - E * α ΔT.

Wait, Young's modulus E for aluminum is about 70 GPa, or 70 × 10^9 Pa. But wait, let me confirm that. I think E for aluminum is around 70 GPa. Yeah, that's right.

So putting it all together:

ΔT = 22.3 - 17.2 = 5.1 °C.

α for aluminum is 23e-6 /°C.

So ε = α ΔT = (23e-6)(5.1) = let's compute that.

23 * 5.1 = 117.3, so 117.3e-6.

Which is 0.0001173.

Since the walls prevent expansion, the strain is negative: ε = -117.3e-6.

Then, stress σ = E * ε.

E = 70e9 Pa.

So σ = 70e9 * (-117.3e-6) = let's compute:

70e9 = 7e10? Wait, no, 70e9 is 70,000,000,000.

Multiply by 117.3e-6: 70e9 * 117.3e-6 = 70e9 * 1.173e-4.

Wait, 70e9 is 7e10? No, 70e9 is 7 * 10^10? Wait, no, 70e9 is 70 * 10^9. So 70e9 = 7e10? No, 70e9 is 7e10? Wait, wait, 10^9 is 1e9. 70e9 is 70 * 1e9 = 7e10. Oh yeah, because 70e9 = 7 * 10 * 1e9 = 7e10.

So 7e10 * 1.173e-4 = 7 * 1.173e6.

Because 7e10 * 1e-4 is 7e6, so 7e10 * 1.173e-4 = 7 * 1.173 * 1e6.

7 * 1.173 is approximately 8.211.

So σ ≈ 8.211e6 Pa, which is about 8.211 MPa.

But wait, since ε is negative, σ is negative: σ ≈ -8.211e6 Pa.

Wait, but the question asks for the stress and the force. So the stress is about -8.2e6 Pa. But the options are given as letters with possible numbers, and I'm to choose from A to J. The options are in multiples of 1e4 N, I think.

Wait, wait, the question says the unit is 1e4 N. So perhaps the problem is asking for the force, not the stress. Let me check: the question says "the stress in the cylinder and the total force it exerts on each wall". So perhaps I'm to calculate both, but the options are for one of them. Wait, but the options are single letters. So maybe the question is only asking for the force. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the force. Force F is stress σ times area A.

Area A is 20 cm² = 20e-4 m², because 1 m² is (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm², so 20 cm² is 20 / 1e4 = 0.002 m², which is 2e-3 m².

Wait, stress is in Pascals, which is N/m². So F = σ * A.

So σ is -8.211e6 Pa, A is 20 cm² = 20e-4 m².

So F = (-8.211e6) * (20e-4) = let's compute that.

First, 8.211e6 * 20e-4 = 8.211e6 * 2e-3 = 8.211 * 2 * 1e3.

Because 1e6 * 1e-3 is 1e3.

So 8.211 * 2 = 16.422, so 16.422e3 N, which is 16,422 N.

But wait, the options are in multiples of 1e4 N, so 16,422 N is 1.6422e4 N. So approximately 1.64 x 1e4 N.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.0, option G is 2.5, J is 2.0. Hmm, but 1.64 isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate.

Compute F = σ * A.

σ = E * α * ΔT.

E = 70e9 Pa.

α = 23e-6 /°C.

ΔT = 5.1°C.

So σ = 70e9 * 23e-6 * 5.1.

Wait, wait, no. Because σ is E * ε, and ε is α ΔT. But since it's constrained, ε is negative: ε = - α ΔT.

So σ = E * (- α ΔT) = - E α ΔT.

So F = σ * A = (- E α ΔT) * A.

So F = - E * α * ΔT * A.

Plugging the numbers:

E =70e9 Pa.

α=23e-6 /°C.

ΔT=5.1.

A=20e-4 m².

So F = -70e9 * 23e-6 *5.1 *20e-4.

Let's compute this step by step.

First, multiply 70e9 and 23e-6:

70e9 = 7e10.

23e-6 = 2.3e-5.

7e10 * 2.3e-5 = (7 * 2.3) * 1e5.

7 * 2.3 = 16.1.

So 16.1e5 = 1.61e6.

Now multiply by 5.1:

1.61e6 *5.1 = let's see, 1.61 *5.1 = approx 8.211, so 8.211e6.

Then multiply by 20e-4:

8.211e6 * 20e-4 = 8.211e6 * 2e-3 = (8.211 * 2) * 1e3.

8.211 * 2 = 16.422, so 16.422e3 = 1.6422e4 N.

So F ≈ -1.6422e4 N. Wait, but the options are in 1e4 N units. So in terms of 1e4 N, it's approximately -1.64. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: -1.7 or option C: -2.3, etc. Hmm, none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 70e9 * 23e-6 first.

70e9 is 70,000,000,000.

23e-6 is 0.000023.

Multiply them: 70e9 *23e-6 = 70 *23 * 1e3.

Because 1e9 * 1e-6 = 1e3.

70 *23 = 1610.

So 1610 * 1e3 = 1,610,000.

Wait, that's 1.61e6.

Then multiply by ΔT=5.1: 1.61e6 *5.1 = 8.211e6.

Then multiply by area A=20 cm² = 0.002 m² = 2e-3 m².

So 8.211e6 *2e-3 = 16,422 N.

Which is 1.6422e4 N. So F ≈ -1.64e4 N. So in terms of 1e4 N, it's -1.64, which is approximately -1.6.

But the options are:

A: 0.8

B: -3.0

C: -2.3

D: -1.7

E: -0.5

F: 1.0

G:2.5

H:1.4

I: -1.2

J:2.0

So the closest option is D: -1.7, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check units again.

Area A: 20 cm² is 20e-4 m²? Yes, because 1 m² = 1e4 dm² = 1e4 *1e4 cm² = 1e8 cm²? Wait, no, wait 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10,000 cm². So 20 cm² is 20 / 10,000 = 0.002 m² = 2e-3 m². So that's correct.

E is 70e9 Pa, correct.

α is 23e-6 /°C, correct.

ΔT is 5.1°C, correct.

So no, the calculation seems right. So F = -1.64e4 N. So that's approximately -1.64 ×1e4 N.

Looking at the options, D is -1.7, which is the closest. So perhaps that's the intended answer. But wait, why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong value for α. Let me check: Aluminum's linear expansion coefficient is about 23 ×10^-6 /°C. Another source says 24e-6. Maybe I should use 24e-6.

Let me recalculate with α=24e-6.

Then:

α=24e-6.

So σ = E * α * ΔT =70e9 *24e-6 *5.1.

70e9 *24e-6 = 70*24 *1e3 = 1680 *1e3 = 1.68e6.

Multiply by 5.1: 1.68e6 *5.1 = 8.568e6.

Then F = σ * A =8.568e6 *20e-4 = 8.568e6 * 2e-3 = 17,136 N.

Which is 1.7136e4 N.

So F = -1.7136e4 N, which is approximately -1.71e4 N, so in options, that's -1.71, which is closer to option D: -1.7.

So that makes sense.

Therefore, the force is approximately -1.7e4 N. So the correct answer would be D: -1.7.

But wait, the question asks for the stress in the cylinder and the total force. I've calculated the force as -1.7e4 N, so that's option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have calculated the stress instead. Let's see, stress is σ = -E α ΔT.

So with E =70e9, α=24e-6, ΔT=5.1.

σ =70e9 *24e-6 *5.1.

70e9 is 7e10.

24e-6 is 2.4e-5.

7e10 *2.4e-5 =7*2.4 *1e5 =16.8e5=1.68e6.

Multiply by 5.1: 1.68e6 *5.1 =8.568e6 Pa.

So σ≈8.568e6 Pa, which is 8.568 MPa.

But the options don't have this; the options are in terms of 1e4 N, so perhaps stress isn't the right approach. The question might be asking for force, which would be option D: -1.7.

So I think the correct answer is D: -1.7.

To solve the problem, we calculate the force exerted by the aluminum cylinder on the steel walls due to thermal expansion. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Given Data**:
   - Length of the cylinder: \( L_0 = 10 \, \text{cm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)
   - Cross-sectional area: \( A = 20 \, \text{cm}^2 = 20 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2 = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^2 \)
   - Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 17.2^\circ \text{C} \)
   - Final temperature: \( T_2 = 22.3^\circ \text{C} \)
   - Temperature change: \( \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 5.1^\circ \text{C} \)
   - Coefficient of linear expansion for aluminum: \( \alpha = 23 \times 10^{-6} \, ^\circ \text{C}^{-1} \)
   - Young's modulus for aluminum: \( E = 70 \, \text{GPa} = 70 \times 10^9 \, \text{Pa} \)

2. **Thermal Strain**:
   The thermal strain is given by:
   \[
   \varepsilon = \alpha \Delta T
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \varepsilon = (23 \times 10^{-6}) (5.1) = 117.3 \times 10^{-6} = 0.0001173
   \]
   Since the walls are rigid and prevent expansion, the strain is compressive:
   \[
   \varepsilon = -0.0001173
   \]

3. **Thermal Stress**:
   Stress is calculated using Hooke's law:
   \[
   \sigma = E \varepsilon
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \sigma = (70 \times 10^9) (-0.0001173) = -8.211 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa}
   \]

4. **Force Exerted on the Walls**:
   The force exerted on each wall is:
   \[
   F = \sigma A
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   F = (-8.211 \times 10^6) (2 \times 10^{-3}) = -16,422 \, \text{N}
   \]
   Converting to the specified unit (\( 10^4 \, \text{N} \)):
   \[
   F = -1.6422 \times 10^4 \, \text{N
