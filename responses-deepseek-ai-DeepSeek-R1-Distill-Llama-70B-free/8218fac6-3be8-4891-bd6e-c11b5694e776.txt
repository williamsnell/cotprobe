Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the digit that comes right before the seven zeros at the end of 30 factorial (30!). Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the number. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, the number of trailing zeros is the minimum of the number of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of 30!. I think there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the number of 5s determines the trailing zeros. 

Wait, so for 30!, how many 5s are there? Let me calculate that. I think you do 30 divided by 5, which is 6. But wait, there's also 25, which is 5 squared, so each contributes an extra 5. So 30 divided by 25 is 1. So the total number of 5s is 6 + 1 = 7. That's why there are seven trailing zeros.

But the question isn't about the number of zeros, it's about the digit before those zeros. I'm a bit stuck here. How do I find that?

I remember that to find the last non-zero digit of a factorial, there's a method. Maybe I can compute 30! and look at the last digit before the zeros, but 30! is a huge number. That's not practical to compute directly. So I need a smarter way.

I've heard that there's a formula or method to find the last non-zero digit of n!. Let me think. Oh right, one approach involves computing the product modulo 10, but ignoring the factors that contribute to trailing zeros. So I need to remove the factors of 10, which are the pairs of 2 and 5. Since there are more 2s than 5s, after pairing each 5 with a 2, there will be some 2s left over. 

So the plan is: compute the product of numbers from 1 to 30, but for each multiple of 5, divide out a 2 to account for the 10. Then, take the result modulo 10 to get the last non-zero digit.

Wait, maybe more accurately: for each multiple of 5, we have a factor that contributes to a trailing zero. So for each such 5, we can remove a 2 from the prime factors. So the remaining product will be (product of all numbers 1-30) divided by 10^7, but we need to compute this without the trailing zeros.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the product modulo 10^something, maybe 10^8, to keep track of the digits before the zeros.

Another approach I've heard about is to compute the last non-zero digit by handling cycles and patterns. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Compute the product of all numbers from 1 to 30, ignoring multiples of 5 and adjusting for the excess factors of 2.
2. For each multiple of 5 in the factorial, we have a corresponding pair of 2 and 5 that makes a 10. So for each 5, we can remove a 2.
3. After accounting for all 5s (which are 7 in total), there will be some 2s left. The number of excess 2s would be the total number of 2s minus 7.
4. Compute the total number of 2s in 30! to find how many are left after removing 7 for the 5s.

Calculating the number of 2s in 30!: 

30 divided by 2 is 15.
30 divided by 4 is 7.
30 divided by 8 is 3.
30 divided by 16 is 1.
30 divided by 32 is 0. So total 2s are 15 +7 +3 +1 =26. So after subtracting 7 (for the 5s), we have 19 excess 2s.

So now, the idea is to compute the product of numbers 1-30, removing factors of 5 and 2 as needed, and then multiply the remaining product by 2^19. Then take modulo 10 to get the last non-zero digit.

But wait, maybe it's better to compute modulo 10^k, where k is more than 1, to account for possible carries. Because when you multiply, the last few digits can affect each other.

Alternatively, perhaps compute modulo 10^8 (since we have 7 zeros and we need one digit before that, but perhaps 8 digits to avoid issues). But that might be computationally intensive.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the product modulo 10, but after handling the 2s and 5s. Wait no, because when you multiply, higher digits can carry over. So maybe we need to compute modulo 10^something, maybe 10^ (7+1) = 10^8, but then again, that's a big number.

Alternatively, there's a method where you compute the last non-zero digit by considering the product in parts, handling the cycles, perhaps using properties of modular arithmetic.

I've heard that there's a formula where you can compute the last non-zero digit by breaking the factorial into groups and using modulo 10 or 20. Let me try to recall.

Another approach is to compute the product modulo 10, but adjusting for the factors of 2 and 5. But I'm not sure if that's sufficient.

Wait, I think the standard method involves computing the product modulo 10^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros plus one. So in this case, 7 zeros, so k=8. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, here's a step-by-step method I found before:

1. Remove factors of 5 and corresponding 2s to eliminate trailing zeros.
2. Compute the product of the remaining factors modulo 10.
3. Multiply by the remaining 2s modulo 10.
4. The result modulo 10 is the last non-zero digit.

Wait, but I think this might not account for all the carrying over, so perhaps it's better to compute modulo 10^something higher.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the product modulo 10^8, ignoring the factors that lead to trailing zeros.

Let me try to outline the steps more clearly:

- For each number from 1 to 30:
   - If the number is a multiple of 5, skip it (since we'll handle the 5s separately).
   - Else, multiply the current product by the number, then divide by 2 for each 5 that's been skipped (since each 5 requires a 2 to make a 10).

Wait, but each 5 requires a 2, and since there are 7 fives, I have to divide the product by 2^7, but I also have excess 2s beyond that.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is:

Compute the product P = product of numbers 1 to 30, with multiples of 5 removed, and each such removal accompanied by dividing by a 2 (so for each 5, a 2 is removed). Then, after that, multiply by 2^(number of 2s - number of 5s) modulo 10.

Wait, let me think again. So for each multiple of 5 in 30!, we have a 5 and a 2 to make a 10, contributing to a trailing zero. So in the product, we can ignore the 5s and divide by as many 2s as the number of 5s. So P would be (product of all numbers 1 to 30) / (5^7 * 2^7) = product of (numbers not divisible by 5) * (2^(26-7)).

Wait, but 26 is the number of 2s in 30!, so after dividing by 2^7, we have 2^19 remaining.

So the product becomes (product of numbers 1-30, excluding multiples of 5) multiplied by 2^19, then divided by 5^7. But since 5^7 is a factor, but we're ignoring the 5s.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me look for a method to compute the last non-zero digit of 30!.

I found that the last non-zero digit of n! can be computed using the formula:

last_non_zero(n!) = (last_non_zero(n/5! ) * last_non_zero(n mod 5! ) * 2^{n/5}) ) mod 10

Wait, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, I remember a method where you compute the product in cycles, perhaps breaking it down by modulo 20 or similar.

Another approach:

1. Compute the product modulo 10^8 to keep the last 8 digits before the trailing zeros.
2. Remove factors of 10 as you go by dividing by 10 each time a multiple of 10 is encountered, but that might not capture all necessary factors.

Wait, perhaps the better way is to compute the product without the factors of 5 and then adjust for the excess factors of 2.

So let's try to compute the product step by step, ignoring multiples of 5, and for each multiple of 5, we remove a 2.

So let's list the numbers from 1 to 30, excluding multiples of 5. The numbers are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, for each of these, we'll multiply them together, and for each multiple of 5 (which we've excluded), we'll remove a 2 from the product. Since there are 7 multiples of 5, we'll have to divide the product by 2^7.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the product as we go, and after each step, take modulo 10^8 (since we need the last 8 digits) to keep the numbers manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product modulo 10^8, but without the factors contributing to the trailing zeros.

Wait, but 10^8 is a large modulus. Maybe I can compute modulo 10^8, but after each multiplication, divide by 10 for each trailing zero. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product modulo 10^8, but for each number, factor out the 2s and 5s as needed.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the product modulo 10 by considering that each 2 and 5 contributes to a 10, which we can factor out. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should proceed step by step, calculating the product while removing factors of 5 and adjusting the factors of 2.

Let me try to compute the product modulo 10, but this might not capture all necessary digits. Alternatively, perhaps compute modulo 100000000 (10^8) to get the last 8 digits before the zeros, then the 8th digit from the end would be the one before the 7 zeros.

Wait, that sounds feasible. Let's try that.

So the plan is:

1. Compute the product of all numbers from 1 to 30, but for each multiple of 5, divide by 10 (which is 2*5), so for each such number, divide by 5 and by 2. But since 5s are only 7, we'll have to manage the 2s accordingly.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: For each number from 1 to 30, if it's a multiple of 5, we'll factor out a 5 and a corresponding 2 (since each 5 pairs with a 2 to make a 10, contributing to a trailing zero). So for each multiple of 5, we'll divide the product by 10 once.

But I'm not sure this approach is correct because higher multiples of 5 (like 25) contribute more than one 5, so we'd need to factor those out as well.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the product as follows:

Initialize the product as 1.

For each number i from 1 to 30:

   While i is divisible by 5, divide i by 5 and count how many times this happens (this gives the number of 5s contributed by this number).

   Multiply the product by the remaining i (after removing 5s).

   Then, multiply the product by 2^(number of 5s) at the end, but wait, no, because we have excess 2s to account for.

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let me count the number of 5s and 2s first.

Number of 5s in 30! is 7, as calculated before. Number of 2s is 26.

So the product without trailing zeros would be (30! ) / (10^7) = (30! ) / (2^7 * 5^7). But 30! also has 26 2s, so the remaining product after removing 10^7 is (30! ) / (2^7 *5^7 ) = (product of numbers 1-30, with all 5s and 7 2s removed) * 2^(26-7) = product * 2^19.

But that's a huge number. So perhaps I can compute this product modulo 10^8, which would give me the last 8 digits, and then the 8th digit would be the one before the 7 zeros.

Wait, but how to compute this without actually calculating 30! ?

Let me try to compute the product step by step, removing factors of 5 and adjusting for 2s.

Initialize product = 1.

For each i from 1 to 30:

   While i is divisible by 5, divide i by 5, and increment a counter for 5s.

   Multiply product by i.

   While product is divisible by 10, divide by 10. (But wait, perhaps this isn't the right approach.)

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the product without considering 5s, and then multiply by the appropriate power of 2 after.

Wait, maybe the approach is as follows:

1. Remove all factors of 5 from the numbers 1 to 30. So for each number divisible by 5, divide it by 5 as many times as possible. For example, 25 becomes 1 (since 25 =5^2), 5 becomes 1, 10 becomes 2, etc.

Wait, no, perhaps I should just exclude the factors of 5 entirely and then adjust for the 2s.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can find a pattern or use recursion.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product modulo 10^8, but ignoring the factors of 5 and adjusting for the 2s.

Let me try that.

Compute product = 1.

For each i from 1 to 30:

   If i is divisible by 5, skip it (since we're removing all factors of 5, but this would also remove numbers like 10, 15, etc., which might not be correct). Wait, no, perhaps I should factor out the 5s, not skip the entire number.

Wait, perhaps for each i:

   While i is divisible by 5, divide i by 5 and increment a counter.

So for each i, factor out all 5s, and keep track of how many 5s there are.

Then, after processing all i, multiply the product by 2^(number_of_5s) to account for the 2s that were paired with the 5s to make 10s. But since there are more 2s than 5s, we have excess 2s.

Wait, let's formalize this:

Initialize product = 1.

count_5 = 0.

For i from 1 to 30:

   current = i.

   while current %5 ==0:

       current = current /5

       count_5 +=1

   product = (product * current) % (10^8)

After processing all i, we have product, which is the product of all numbers from 1 to 30 with all factors of 5 removed.

Now, since each 5 was paired with a 2 to make a 10, and we have count_5=7, we need to multiply by 2^count_5 to account for the 2s that were used. But wait, the number of 2s in 30! is 26, so the excess 2s are 26 -7=19. So we need to multiply the product by 2^19.

Wait, but perhaps I should multiply the product by 2^(count_5) to account for the 2s that were used with the 5s, and then multiply by the excess 2s. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the steps.

Wait, the product after removing 5s has all the factors except 5s. But in reality, in 30!, for each 5, there's a corresponding 2 that's part of a 10, so when we remove the 5s, we should also remove the same number of 2s. So the total product would be (product without 5s) * (2^(total_2s - count_5)).

So:

product = (product without 5s) * (2^(26 -7)) = product_without_5s * 2^19.

Then, the last non-zero digit of 30! is the last digit of this product modulo 10.

Wait, but I think we need to compute this product modulo 10^8 to get the correct last few digits before the trailing zeros.

So let's compute it step by step.

Compute product = 1.

count_5 = 0.

For each i from 1 to 30:

   current = i.

   while current %5 ==0:

       current = current /5

       count_5 +=1

   product = (product * current) % 100000000  # Modulo 10^8.

After this loop, product is the product of all numbers from 1 to 30 with all factors of 5 removed, modulo 1e8.

Now, compute the excess 2s: total_2s =26, count_5=7, so excess_2s=26-7=19.

Multiply product by 2^19 modulo 1e8.

So product = (product * (2^19)) % 100000000.

Now, the last 8 digits of this product will give us the digits before the 7 trailing zeros. So the 8th digit from the end is the one we're looking for.

Wait, but 2^19 is a large number. Let me compute 2^19.

2^10=1024.

2^20=1,048,576.

So 2^19=524,288.

So product = (product
