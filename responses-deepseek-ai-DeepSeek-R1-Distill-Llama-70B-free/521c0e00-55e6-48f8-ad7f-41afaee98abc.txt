Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about heat transfer in a pipe where water is being preheated. The reactor has a maximum power rating, and we need to find the length of the pipe and the maximum exit temperature.

First, I'll start by listing out all the given data to get a clear picture.

- Maximum power per meter of pipe: 150 W/m
- Operating temperature of the reactor: 350 K (but wait, I'm not sure if this is the temperature of the reactor or the fluid. Oh, right, the pipe's operating temp is probably the surroundings, but maybe it's the fluid's exit temp... Hmm, I might need to think about that again.)
- Flow rate: 5 kg/hr. I'll probably need to convert this into kg/s for calculations because power is in Watts (Joules per second).
- Inlet temperature (mean bulk): 290 K
- Internal diameter of the pipe: 0.005 m. I might need this to find the cross-sectional area or velocity, but since the question doesn't mention anything about pressure drop or flow velocity affecting the heat transfer, maybe it's not needed for part (a). Wait, perhaps it's needed for calculating the volume, but I'm not sure yet.

The problem has two parts: (a) the length of the pipe needed to transfer the necessary heat, and (b) the maximum exit temperature.

Starting with part (a): Calculate the length of the pipe.

I think the approach here is to calculate the heat required to raise the temperature of the water from 290 K to the exit temperature. But wait, the exit temperature in part (a) might be the operating temperature of the reactor, which is 350 K. Or is the exit temperature something else? Oh, wait, part (a) is about the necessary preheating, which probably brings the water up to the reactor's operating temperature. So the exit temperature for part (a) is 350 K.

But wait, the problem says the reactor's maximum power is 150 W per meter. So the power supplied per meter is 150 W/m. The total power needed to heat the water would be the heat transfer rate, which is Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_inlet). 

Wait, but the reactor supplies power, which is the rate of heat transfer. So the Q here is the power provided by the reactor per unit length multiplied by the length of the pipe.

So Q = (Power per meter) * L = 150 W/m * L (meters) = 150 L Watts.

On the other hand, Q is also equal to the heat required to raise the water's temperature. So Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_inlet).

So setting these equal: 150 L = m_dot * c_p * (350 - 290)

I need to compute m_dot in kg/s. Given that flow rate is 5 kg/hr, so 5 kg/hr is 5/3600 kg/s ≈ 0.0013889 kg/s.

The specific heat capacity of water, c_p, is approximately 4186 J/kg·K.

So let's plug the numbers in:

150 L = (5/3600) kg/s * 4186 J/kg·K * (60 K)

Wait, 350 - 290 is 60 K.

Calculating the right-hand side:

(5/3600) * 4186 * 60 = ?

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5/3600 is approximately 0.0013889.

Multiply by 4186: 0.0013889 * 4186 ≈ let's compute 0.0013889 * 4000 = 5.5556, and 0.0013889 * 186 ≈ 0.2586. So total roughly 5.5556 + 0.2586 ≈ 5.8142.

Then multiply by 60: 5.8142 * 60 ≈ 348.85.

So the right-hand side is approximately 348.85 Watts.

Wait, but wait: Q is 150 L = 348.85.

So solving for L: L = 348.85 / 150 ≈ 2.3257 meters.

Looking at the options, J is (a) 2.32 m, which is very close. So part (a) would be 2.32 m, which is option J.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for any possible errors.

Calculating m_dot:

5 kg/hr = 5/3600 kg/s = 0.001388889 kg/s.

c_p for water is 4186 J/kg·K.

Delta T is 60 K.

So Q = m_dot * c_p * delta_T = 0.001388889 * 4186 * 60.

Compute 0.001388889 * 4186 first.

0.001388889 is approximately 1/720 (since 1/720≈0.0013889).

So 4186 * (1/720) = 4186 /720 ≈ 5.81.

Wait, 720 * 5=3600, 720*5.8=4176, which is close to 4186, so 5.81 is correct.

Then multiply by 60: 5.81 *60 = 348.6.

So yes, Q ≈ 348.6 W.

So 150 L = 348.6 → L ≈ 2.324 m. So about 2.32 meters, which is option J.

So part (a) is 2.32 m, which is answer J.

Now part (b): maximum exit temperature.

Wait, the maximum power is 150 W per meter. So when the pipe is longer than needed for just heating to 350 K, perhaps in part (a) we're only heating to 350 K, but part (b) is about the maximum possible exit temperature if we use the maximum power.

Wait, maybe I got part (a) wrong. Because part (a) is asking for the length over which necessary preheating is accomplished, which brings the water up to 350 K. But part (b) is the maximum exit temperature possible, which might be higher than 350 K because the power is supplied along the entire pipe.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the reactor has a maximum power rating of 150 W per meter. So the pipe could be longer than needed for reaching 350 K, allowing the water to heat beyond that point, but perhaps the reactor's operating temperature is 350 K, which is the maximum allowed. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me read the question again.

"Water enters a reactor through a length of pipe in which the necessary preheating is accomplished. The reactor has a maximum power rating of 150 W per meter of pipe, and its operating temperature is 350 K."

Ah, the operating temperature is 350 K, so the water can't be heated beyond that in the reactor. So when the pipe is of length L, part (a) is when the exit temperature is 350 K, which requires a certain length. But part (b) is asking, assuming the pipe is the length found in (a), what's the maximum exit temperature possible. Or wait, no, perhaps part (b) is a separate question. Maybe for part (a), the pipe is just to reach 350 K, and part (b) is, if the pipe is the same length as part (a), but the power is supplied at maximum 150 W/m, what's the maximum possible exit temperature.

Wait, no, perhaps part (a) is the length needed to reach 350 K with the given flow rate and power. Then part (b) is, given that pipe length (from part a), what is the maximum exit temperature, perhaps when more power is used? No, because the maximum power is 150 W/m. Wait, perhaps in part (a), the calculation assumes the entire length is providing heat at 150 W/m. So in part (a), the exit is 350 K, but in part (b), if the pipe is longer than part (a), then the exit could be higher. Hmm, but the question says the pipe's length is such that the necessary preheating is done, so perhaps part (a) is finding that length, and part (b) is, for that length, what's the maximum possible exit temperature.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. The maximum power per meter is 150 W/m. So the total power available is 150 * L, where L is the length found in part (a). But in part (a), the exit temp is 350 K, which is the reactor's operating temp. So in part (a), Q is 150 L = m_dot c_p (350-290). So L is 2.32 m.

In part (b), what's the maximum exit temp? So perhaps the maximum exit temp occurs when all the available power is used to heat the water, but without any limit on temperature. But wait, the reactor's operating temperature is 350 K, so maybe that's the maximum. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum exit temp is when the pipe is the same length as in part (a), and the power is 150 W/m, so the same total power.

Wait, no, perhaps part (b) is using the same flow rate and the same pipe length as part (a), but calculates the exit temp when the maximum power is applied. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps part (b) is independent of part (a), but just using the same parameters except that the length is such that the maximum possible temperature is achieved. Or perhaps I should approach part (b) separately.

Wait, let me think again. The question says, in part (b), the maximum exit temperature of the water. So perhaps it's the maximum possible exit temp given the flow rate, the pipe's diameter, and the maximum power. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the case where the pipe is as long as possible, but given that the maximum power is 150 W/m, but that seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps I should model both parts together.

Wait, from part (a), we found that L is approximately 2.32 m, which is option J. Now, part (b) asks for the maximum exit temp. So perhaps, the maximum exit temp would be when the pipe is longer, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps part (b) is unrelated to part (a), and is asking, given the same parameters except that the exit temp is maximized, what's the exit temp and the required pipe length.

Wait, but the question gives two parts, (a) and (b), so perhaps (a) is to find the pipe length when the exit temp is 350 K, and (b) is to find the maximum possible exit temp given that the pipe is the same length as (a), but the power is applied at 150 W/m.

Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps (a) is the length needed to reach 350 K with the given power per meter, and (b) is, with that same length, what's the maximum temp possible, which would require more heat, but perhaps the power is fixed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

In part (a), the necessary preheating is to bring the water from 290 K to 350 K, which requires a certain length L, which we found to be about 2.32 m.

In part (b), the maximum exit temperature would be when the reactor is providing the maximum possible heat. Since the reactor's maximum power is 150 W/m, using the same length L found in part (a), the heat input would be Q = 150 * L.

Wait, but part (a) already uses Q = 150 L to compute L. So in part (a), the exit temp is 350 K. So in part (b), the question is, what's the maximum possible exit temp when the reactor operates at maximum power, which would be when all the power is used to heat the water beyond 350 K, but that can't be because the reactor's operating temp is 350 K.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario. The reactor's operating temp is 350 K, so perhaps the water can't be heated beyond that. So maybe part (b) is when the pipe is of length L found in (a), what's the exit temp. But that would be 350 K, which isn't an option. So perhaps part (b) is when the pipe is longer than necessary, but the maximum power is applied.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of part (b) as a separate problem. If the pipe's length is such that the maximum possible exit temperature is achieved, given the maximum power per meter.

Wait, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps part (b) is, regardless of the length, what's the maximum possible exit temp given the flow rate, but that doesn't make sense because more length would allow more heating.

Wait, maybe part (b) is assuming the pipe is the same length as found in (a), and we're to find the exit temp when maximum power is applied. Wait, but in part (a), the power per meter is 150 W/m, which is the maximum. So perhaps part (b) is asking, what's the exit temp when the pipe is at length L from part (a), but the power is the maximum possible, which is the same as in part (a). That can't be, because then the exit temp would be 350 K, which isn't one of the options except perhaps option J's part (b) is 367 K.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the assumption is that in part (a), the exit temp is 350 K, and part (b) is, what is the exit temp if the pipe is longer, allowing more heat to be transferred, thus raising the temp beyond 350 K. But then, the reactor's operating temp is 350 K, so perhaps the water can't be heated beyond that because the reactor's surroundings are at 350 K. But that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps the reactor's maximum power is 150 W/m, and the question is, with that power, what's the maximum possible exit temp.

Wait, perhaps the maximum exit temp is determined by the maximum possible heat that can be transferred given the flow rate and the power. So Q = 150 L, and Q = m_dot c_p (T_exit - 290). So solving for T_exit:

T_exit = 290 + (150 L) / (m_dot c_p)

In part (a), we found that when T_exit is 350 K, L is 2.32 m. So in part (b), perhaps the length is the same, 2.32 m, so:

T_exit = 290 + (150 * 2.32) / (m_dot c_p)

Wait, let me compute this. m_dot is 5 kg/hr = 5/3600 kg/s ≈ 0.0013889 kg/s.

150 * 2.32 = 348 W.

So Q = 348 W.

Then, T_exit = 290 + (348) / (0.0013889 * 4186)

Compute denominator: 0.0013889 * 4186 ≈ 5.814.

So 348 / 5.814 ≈ 59.8 K.

So T_exit ≈ 290 + 59.8 ≈ 349.8 K, approximately 350 K, which is the same as part (a). That can't be right because part (b) should have a higher temp.

Wait, perhaps I'm not understanding the problem correctly. Maybe part (b) is when the pipe's length is such that the maximum possible temperature is achieved, perhaps without considering the 350 K limit. Or perhaps the maximum exit temp is when the reactor is operating at maximum power for a given length.

Wait, perhaps part (b) is when the pipe is the same length as in part (a), but the power is the maximum possible. But in part (a), the power was already at maximum. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum exit temp is determined by the energy balance without any constraint on the temperature. So Q = m_dot c_p (T_exit - 290) = 150 L.

But we don't know L. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum temp occurs when all the power is used, but without any constraint on L. Wait, but L isn't given.

Wait, perhaps part (b) is a separate calculation where the exit temp is determined by the maximum possible Q, which is when the entire pipe is at maximum power. But without knowing the pipe length, I can't compute Q. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the maximum exit temp occurs when the reactor is at maximum power, and the pipe length is the same as in part (a). So with L=2.32 m, and Q=150*2.32=348 W, then:

Q = m_dot c_p (T_exit - 290)

So T_exit = 290 + Q/(m_dot c_p)

Which is what I did earlier, getting approximately 350 K. So that can't be the case, since 350 K is the operating temp, but the option J has part (b) as 367.07 K, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me recheck part (a).

Wait, perhaps the operating temp is not the exit temp. Maybe the reactor's temp is 350 K, and the pipe is where heat is added to the water. So the heat transferred could be from the reactor to the water.

In that case, the heat transfer would be Q = U A ΔT, but I don't have U or A. Hmm, perhaps that's a different approach.

Wait, but the problem says the reactor has a maximum power of 150 W/m. So power per meter is 150 W/m, which is the heat flux per meter.

So the total power is 150 L, as before.

So for part (a), the heat needed to bring the water from 290 K to 350 K is Q = m_dot c_p (350-290) = 5/3600 * 4186 *60 = approx 348.6 W. So the length is 348.6 /150 ≈ 2.324 m.

So part (a) is 2.32 m.

Now part (b): maximum exit temp. Assuming the same flow rate and pipe length as part (a), but perhaps the maximum power is applied. But in part (a), the power was exactly the required to reach 350 K. So perhaps part (b) is when the pipe is longer, allowing more heat to be transferred, thus higher exit temp.

Wait, but the problem gives part (a) and (b) as separate questions, so perhaps part (b) is a separate scenario where the pipe's length is such that it allows maximum exit temp given the
