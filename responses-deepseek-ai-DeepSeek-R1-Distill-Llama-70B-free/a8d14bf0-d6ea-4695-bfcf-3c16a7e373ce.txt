Okay, let's tackle this genetics problem. Hmm, so we're dealing with fruit flies and eye color. I remember that in fruit flies, eye color is often an X-linked trait. The question says the gene for vermilion eye color (v) is X-linked and recessive. The wild-type allele (v^+) gives dull red eyes. 

So the setup is a cross between a female with wild-type eyes and an unknown male. The progeny numbers are given as:

Females: 64 wild-type, 57 vermilion
Males: 42 wild-type, 59 vermilion

Wait, I need to find the genotypes of both parents.

First, for the female's genotype. Since she has wild-type eyes, her possible genotypes are either homozygous (v^+ v^+) or heterozygous (v^+ v). Because the gene is on the X chromosome, females have two copies.

Now, let's think about the male. Fruit fly males are hemizygous for X-linked traits; they have only one X (and a Y). So the male's X will determine his phenotype. The male's genotype could be v^+ (wild-type) or v (vermilion).

Looking at the offspring:

Daughters receive an X from each parent. Sons receive the X from the mother and the Y from the father.

Let me break it down.

The female parent is crossed with a male of unknown genotype. Let's call the female genotype as Mom and male as Dad.

Assuming the female is v^+ v^+, then she can only pass v^+ to all her daughters, and her sons would get v^+ (from her) and Y (from dad). Wait no, wait. Wait, for sons, the X comes from the mother, Y from the father.

Wait, let's think again.

The female parent must pass an X to her sons. So if the female is v^+ v^+, all her sons would get v^+ from her, so sons would all be wild-type, regardless of the father's genotype. But looking at the data, the sons (males) are 42 wild-type and 59 vermilion. So that can't be the case if the mother is v^+ v^+ because all sons would have wild-type eyes. But here, some sons are vermilion. So the mother can't be v^+ v^+.

Hmm, so maybe the mother is v^+ v. Because then, she can pass either v^+ or v to her sons. So if the mother is v^+ v, then her sons could be either v^+ or v, depending on which X they get.

Now, looking at the male progeny: 42 wild-type, 59 vermilion. So the ratio is roughly 42:59, which is approximately 1:1.4. That suggests that about half the sons are wild-type and half are vermilion. Which would happen if the mother is v^+ v. Because each son has a 50% chance of getting v^+ (wild-type) or v (vermilion) from her.

But wait, the father's X would go to the daughters. Because females get an X from each parent. So if the father is, say, v^+, then all daughters would get v^+ from dad, and from mom either v^+ or v. If mom is v^+ v, then daughters could be v^+ v^+ (if they get v^+ from mom) or v^+ v (if they get v from mom). But wait, wait. No, because the father's X is v^+ or v.

Wait, let's think about each scenario.

Case 1: Mother is v^+ v.

If the father is v^+ (wild-type), then:

- Sons get X from mother (either v^+ or v) and Y from father.

So sons would be 50% v^+ (wild-type) and 50% v (vermilion).

Which matches the observed numbers: 42 wild-type (about 42%) and 59 vermillion (about 58%) sons. That fits a 50:50 ratio, which is approximately what we have here.

Now, the daughters would receive X from both parents. Mother can give v^+ or v, father gives v^+.

So daughters would be either v^+ (from father) and v^+ (from mother) → v^+ v^+ (wild-type), or v^+ (father) and v (mother) → v^+ v (which is also phenotypically wild-type since v^+ is dominant).

Wait, so all daughters would be wild-type. But in the data, daughters are 64 wild-type and 57 vermilion. So that's a problem because according to this scenario, daughters should all be wild-type. But in reality, some daughters are vermilion.

Hmm, so that can't be the case. Maybe the father's genotype is different.

Alternative scenario: If the mother is v^+ v, and the father is v.

Then:

- Sons get X from mother (v^+ or v) and Y from father.

So sons would be 50% v^+ (wild-type) and 50% v (vermilion). Which again matches the sons' data.

Now, the daughters:

They get X from father (v) and X from mother (v^+ or v).

So the possible daughter genotypes are:

- v (from dad) and v^+ (from mom): v^+ v → phenotypically wild-type.

- v (from dad) and v (from mom): v v → phenotypically vermilion.

So the daughters would have a 50% chance of being wild-type (v^+ v) and 50% chance of being vermilion (v v).

Looking at the daughter counts: 64 wild-type and 57 vermilion. That's approximately a 53:47 split, which is close to 50:50. So this fits.

Wait, so let me summarize:

Mother's genotype: v^+ v.

Father's genotype: v.

So the cross is:

Mother: v^+ v (heterozygous, so wild-type because v^+ is dominant)

Father: v (because males have only one X; so his phenotype is vermilion, but wait, no: if the father is v, then his eye color would be vermilion. But the question says that the female is crossed with an unknown male. So the male's phenotype isn't given.

Wait, but in the data, the sons are 42 wild-type and 59 vermilion. If the father is v, then the mother must be v^+ v, because the sons would get either v^+ or v from her. 

Wait, but in this scenario, when the father is v, daughters get v from him and either v^+ or v from mom. So daughters would be either v^+ v (wild-type) or v v (vermilion). The numbers are 64 wild and 57 vermil, which is about 53% and 47%, so roughly half each. That makes sense.

So, the mother must be v^+ v, and the father must be v.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Female: v^+ v, Male: v.

Yes, that's our conclusion.

Wait, let's check the other options to make sure.

Option E: female v^+ v, male v^+ v. But male can't have v^+ v because males are XY, so they only have one X. So for the male, genotype is just v^+ or v. So option E is invalid because male can't be v^+ v.

Option G: female v^+ v, male v^+. Then sons would get v^+ (from mom) and Y (from dad). So all sons would be v^+, wild-type. But in data, sons are split, so this can't be.

Option H: female v v^+ (same as v^+ v, since order doesn't matter), male v v. But male can't have two v's because he has only one X. So that's impossible.

Option F: female v^+ v, male v. That fits.

But wait, let me double-check the math.

Mother: v^+ v.

Father: v.

Daughters get X from father (v) and X from mother (v^+ or v).

So daughters: 50% v^+ v (wild-type), 50% v v (vermilion).

Female progeny: 64 wild, 57 vermil. 64 +57=121. 64/121≈52.9%, 57≈47.1%. Close enough to 50:50, so that works.

Sons get X from mother (v^+ or v), Y from father.

So 50% v^+ Y (wild), 50% v Y (vermilion).

Males: 42 wild, 59 vermil. 42+59=101. 42≈41.6%, 59≈58.4%. Close to 50:50, so that works.

So the female parent is v^+ v, and the male is v.

Looking back at the options, option F is female v^+ v and male v. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Option F: yes, that's what we have.

So for part (a), the female's genotype is v^+ v, and (b) the male's is v.

Looking at the options:

Option F is:

Female: v^+ v, Male: v.

Yes, that's the correct answer.

To determine the genotypes of the female and male parents, we analyze the inheritance of the X-linked vermilion eye color gene (\(v\)) in fruit flies. The female parent has wild-type eyes, so her possible genotypes are \(v^+ v^+\) (homozygous) or \(v^+ v\) (heterozygous). The male parent, being hemizygous, can only have one of the alleles (\(v^+\) or \(v\)).

### Analysis of Offspring Data:
1. **Sons (Males):**  
   Sons inherit their X chromosome from the mother and their Y chromosome from the father.  
   - If the mother were \(v^+ v^+\), all sons would inherit \(v^+\) and thus have wild-type eyes. However, the data shows 42 wild-type and 59 vermilion sons, indicating a 1:1 ratio. This is inconsistent with a \(v^+ v^+\) mother.  
   - If the mother is \(v^+ v\), she can pass either \(v^+\) or \(v\) to her sons. This would result in approximately half of the sons being wild-type (\(v^+\)) and half being vermilion (\(v\)), which matches the observed data.

2. **Daughters (Females):**  
   Daughters inherit one X chromosome from each parent.  
   - If the mother is \(v^+ v\) and the father is \(v\), daughters will inherit \(v\) from the father and either \(v^+\) or \(v\) from the mother.  
     - \(v^+ v\): Wild-type (dull red eyes).  
     - \(v v\): Vermilion eyes.  
   - The observed data shows 64 wild-type and 57 vermilion daughters, approximately a 1:1 ratio. This is consistent with a \(v^+ v\) mother and a \(v\) father.

### Conclusion:
- The female parent must be \(v^+ v\) (heterozygous), as she produces both wild-type and vermilion offspring.  
- The male parent must be \(v\), as he contributes only the \(v\) allele to his daughters and does not influence the sons' phenotypes beyond the Y chromosome.

### Correct Option:
**F: Female parent genotype: \(v^+ v\), Male parent genotype: \(v\).**
