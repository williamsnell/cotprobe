Okay, so I've got this problem here about Bob rolling a die each morning. Let me try to understand what's going on. So, Bob uses a fair six-sided die. Each morning, he rolls it. Depending on what he rolls, he decides what cereal to eat. But wait, there's a twist if he rolls a 1—he rolls again. The question is about the expected number of times he rolls the die in a non-leap year.

Hmm. So first, I think I need to find the expected number of rolls each morning, and then multiply that by the number of days in a year, which is 365.

Wait, right. Because each day is independent, so the total expected rolls would be 365 multiplied by the expected number of rolls per day.

So the key is to find the expected number of rolls each day. Let's think about that. Each day, he starts by rolling the die. Depending on what comes up, he might have to roll again.

The die has six faces: numbers 1 through 6. The possible outcomes each roll are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, each with probability 1/6.

Now, the rules: if he rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. Composite numbers on a die are 4, 6, right? Because 2 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, and 1 is neither. So composites are 4 and 6. So that's two outcomes.

If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened. Primes are 2, 3, 5—so three outcomes.

Wait, and then if he rolls a 1, he rolls again. So 1 is the only number that makes him re-roll.

So the process each morning is: he rolls until he gets a number that's not 1. So each morning, he might roll once, twice, etc., until he stops.

Now, the expected number of rolls per day is the expected value of a geometric distribution where each trial has a success probability. Or wait, maybe it's more like a geometric series situation.

Let me model this. Each time he rolls, there's a 1/6 chance of rolling a 1, which means he has to roll again, and a 5/6 chance of stopping (because any other number—2,3,4,5,6—will make him stop).

Wait, no. Wait, because 1 is the only number that makes him roll again. So the probability of stopping on each roll is 5/6, and the probability of having to roll again is 1/6.

The expected number of rolls per day is the sum of the probabilities that he has to roll more than once.

So the expectation E can be written as: E = 1 + (1/6)*E. Because he rolls once (that's the 1), and then with probability 1/6, he has to start over, which would add the expected E again. Oh wait, that's a recursive way to think about it.

So solving for E:

E = 1 + (1/6)E

Subtract (1/6)E from both sides:

E - (1/6)E = 1

(5/6)E = 1

E = (6/5) = 1.2 rolls per day.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Because each time he rolls a 1, he adds another roll. So the expectation E is the sum over the number of rolls multiplied by their probabilities.

E = sum_{k=1 to ∞} k * P(k rolls)

What's P(k rolls)? Well, he has to roll 1 exactly (k-1) times and then not roll 1 on the k-th roll.

So P(k) = (1/6)^(k-1) * (5/6)

Then E is sum_{k=1 to ∞} k * (1/6)^(k-1) * (5/6)

Hmm. I remember that the expectation for a geometric distribution where you count the number of trials until the first success is 1/p, where p is the probability of success on each trial. But wait, in this case, the "success" is stopping, which happens with probability 5/6 each time after rolling.

Wait, so the number of rolls is a geometric distribution where p is 5/6. So the expectation would be 1/p, which is 6/5, which is 1.2. So that matches what I got earlier.

So each day, the expected number of rolls is 6/5.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because each day, he keeps rolling until he gets a number that's not 1. So each day, the number of rolls is a geometric random variable where each trial (after the first) has a probability of 1/6 to continue. So the expectation is 1/(5/6) )? Wait, no, because the expectation for the number of trials until the first success is 1/p, where p is the probability of success each trial.

Wait, in this case, the first roll is a trial that can lead to success (stopping) or failure (rolling again). So the number of rolls is the number of trials until the first success, where success is not rolling a 1.

So p = 5/6, so expectation is 1/p = 6/5. So yes, 6/5 rolls per day.

So the total expected number of rolls in a year is 365 * (6/5) = (365 * 6) / 5.

Let me compute that.

365 * 6 = 2190.

2190 /5 = 438.

So the answer would be 438, which I think is option E.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The options are A: 365/4, B:365, C:3/2, D:365/2, E:438, F:5/4, G:1095, H:730, I:5/8, J:1825/4.

Yes, option E is 438.

So the correct answer is E.

To determine the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year, we first calculate the expected number of rolls per day. Bob rolls a fair six-sided die, and if he rolls a 1, he rolls again. The probability of rolling a 1 is \( \frac{1}{6} \), and the probability of stopping (rolling any other number) is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

The number of rolls per day follows a geometric distribution, where the expected number of rolls is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{p}
\]

Here, \( p = \frac{5}{6} \), so:

\[
E = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{6}} = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2
\]

Thus, the expected number of rolls per day is \( \frac{6}{5} \). In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the total expected number of rolls in a year is:

\[
365 \times \frac{6}{5} = \frac{365 \times 6}{5} = \frac{2190}{5} = 438
\]

Therefore, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year is 438.

The correct answer is:

**E: 438**
