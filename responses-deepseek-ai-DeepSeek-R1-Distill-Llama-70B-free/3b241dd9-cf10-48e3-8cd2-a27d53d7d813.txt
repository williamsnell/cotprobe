Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the standard enthalpy of the combustion reaction of propene. Hmm, I remember that combustion reactions involve a substance reacting with oxygen to produce CO2 and H2O. So propene (which is C3H6) burning in O2 to form CO2 and H2O.

The given data includes two reactions and their standard enthalpies. The first reaction is the hydrogenation of propene. The reaction is CH2:CH.CH3 + H2 → CH3CH2CH3, and the enthalpy is -124 kJ/mol^-1. Wait, that's exothermic because it's negative. Hydrogenation adds H2, so this makes sense because adding hydrogen usually releases energy.

The second reaction is the oxidation (combustion) of propane. The reaction is CH3CH2CH3 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O, with ΔH of -2222 kJ/mol^-1. That's a big exothermic value, which makes sense for a combustion reaction.

But I need to find the enthalpy for the combustion of propene. So, how are these reactions related? Maybe I can use Hess's Law, which allows us to combine reactions to get the desired one.

Let me write down the combustion reactions I know. The general form is:

CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

For propane (C3H8), the combustion is given. For propene (C3H6), I'm to find it.

Wait, I think I can express the combustion of propene in terms of the given reactions. Let me outline the steps.

First, I recall that the combustion of propene would be:

C3H6 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

But to get from the given reactions to this, maybe I can manipulate the given reactions.

Let me think: the first reaction is the hydrogenation of propene to propane. So, propene plus H2 becomes propane, releasing 124 kJ (since ΔH is negative). So equation 1 is:

CH2=CH2CH3 + H2 → CH3CH2CH3; ΔH1 = -124 kJ/mol.

The second reaction is the combustion of propane, which is:

CH3CH2CH3 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O; ΔH2 = -2222 kJ/mol.

I need to get the combustion of propene. So, I can think of it as starting with propane combustion and then reversing the hydrogenation step.

Wait, perhaps I can write the combustion of propene as the sum of two reactions.

Let me try to write the desired reaction as a combination. So, if I have the combustion of propane, and I want to relate it to propene.

Alternatively, perhaps I can reverse the hydrogenation reaction. Let's think: The hydrogenation reaction adds H2 to propene to make propane. So, if I reverse that, propane would lose H2 to become propene.

So, reversing reaction 1 gives: CH3CH2CH3 → CH2=CH2CH3 + H2; ΔH = +124 kJ/mol (because reversing the reaction changes the sign of ΔH).

Now, if I have the combustion of propane (reaction 2), which produces CO2 and H2O, and then perhaps use the reversed reaction 1 to relate propane to propene.

Wait, perhaps the desired reaction (combustion of propene) can be written as:

propane combustion reaction (ΔH2) plus the reverse of reaction 1 (ΔH1_rev). But wait, no. Let me think in terms of equations.

Let me write each step:

1. Propene + H2 → Propane; ΔH1 = -124 kJ.

2. Propane + 5 O2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O; ΔH2 = -2222 kJ.

Now, I want the combustion of propene, which is:

Propene + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

Wait, but I need to balance the oxygen and such. Let me write the balanced equation for propene's combustion.

The formula for propene is C3H6. Combustion reaction:

C3H6 + (5/1) O2 → 3 CO2 + 3 H2O.

Wait, let's balance it properly.

C3H6 has 3 C and 6 H. So, each CO2 has one C, so 3 CO2. Each H2O has 2 H, so for 6 H, we need 3 H2O. So, the balanced equation is:

C3H6 + (5) O2 → 3 CO2 + 3 H2O.

Now, to find ΔH for this reaction.

How can I get this from reactions 1 and 2?

Let me see. Let me think of reaction 2 as the combustion of propane. If I can relate propane back to propene, perhaps I can combine the reactions.

Wait, another approach: The combustion of propene can be thought of as the combustion of propane minus the hydrogenation of propene. Because propane has more H than propene, perhaps.

Alternatively, let me think of the following: If I take the combustion of propane (reaction 2) and subtract the hydrogenation reaction (reaction 1), but adjust for the correct stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the desired reaction can be obtained by taking reaction 2 and then subtracting reaction 1. Let's see.

Reaction 2: CH3CH2CH3 + 5 O2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O; ΔH = -2222.

Reaction 1: CH2=CHCH3 + H2 → CH3CH2CH3; ΔH = -124.

If I reverse reaction 1, I get: CH3CH2CH3 → CH2=CHCH3 + H2; ΔH = +124.

So, if I add reaction 2 and the reversed reaction 1, what happens?

Adding reaction 2 and reversed reaction 1:

CH3CH2CH3 + 5 O2 → 3 CO2 + 4 H2O; ΔH = -2222.

Plus

CH3CH2CH3 → CH2=CHCH3 + H2; ΔH = +124.

Wait, but that would sum to:

CH3CH2CH3 + 5 O2 + CH3CH2CH3 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O + CH2=CHCH3 + H2.

That's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should subtract reaction 1 from reaction 2.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The combustion of propene can be written as propane's combustion plus the dehydrogenation (reverse hydrogenation) of propane back to propene.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think in terms of equations.

Let me write the two reactions:

Reaction A: Propene → Propane + H2; ΔH = -124.

Reaction B: Propane +5 O2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O; ΔH = -2222.

I need to find the combustion of propene, which is:

Propene + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

Wait, perhaps I can write the desired reaction as Reaction B minus Reaction A.

Wait, let's see:

If I take Reaction B (propane combustion) and subtract Reaction A (propene to propane), I would get:

Reaction B: Propane +5 O2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O.

Reaction A: Propene → Propane + H2.

Wait, but when I subtract Reaction A, I need to reverse it. So, subtracting Reaction A is the same as adding the reverse of Reaction A.

So, Reaction B + Reverse Reaction A would be:

Propane +5 O2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O.

Plus

Propane + H2 → Propene.

So adding these gives:

Propane +5 O2 + Propane + H2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O + Propene.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. I'm getting 2 moles of propane on the reactant side, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the desired reaction as the sum of Reaction B and the reverse of Reaction A, but adjusting for the number of moles.

Wait, perhaps I can write the desired reaction as follows:

Desired reaction: Propene + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

I can think of this as the propane combustion (Reaction B) minus the hydrogenation (Reaction A), because hydrogenation adds H2 to propene to make propane.

So, the overall idea is that if I have propane (which is more saturated) and I remove H2, I get propene. So, the combustion of propene could be the combustion of propane minus the energy change from adding H2.

Wait, perhaps I should write each step.

Let me start by considering the combustion of propane (Reaction B):

CH3CH2CH3 + 5 O2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O; ΔH = -2222 kJ.

Now, to get the combustion of propene, I can think of propane being converted back to propene by removing H2 (since propene has fewer H's). So, the reverse of Reaction A is:

CH3CH2CH3 → CH2=CH2CH3 + H2; ΔH = +124 kJ.

So, if I have Reaction B, which is the combustion of propane, and I add the reverse of Reaction A, which is propane turning into propene plus H2, perhaps that can lead me to the combustion of propene.

Wait, let me try to add Reaction B and the reverse of Reaction A:

Reaction B: CH3CH2CH3 +5 O2 →3 CO2 +4 H2O; ΔH=-2222.

Reverse Reaction A: CH3CH2CH3 → CH2=CH2CH3 + H2; ΔH=+124.

Adding them together:

CH3CH2CH3 +5 O2 + CH3CH2CH3 →3 CO2 +4 H2O + CH2=CH2CH3 + H2.

Wait, that's two moles of propane on the left. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should subtract Reaction A from Reaction B. Let's see:

Reaction B gives propane's combustion, but to get propene's combustion, maybe I should take Reaction B and subtract Reaction A, but make sure the stoichiometry lines up.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of Hess's Law, which allows me to combine reactions.

So, the desired reaction is:

C3H6 + 5 O2 →3 CO2 +3 H2O.

I can write this as the sum of Reaction B and the reverse of Reaction A, but let me see.

Wait, another approach: Let me write the combustion of propene as the sum of the combustion of propane and the reverse of the hydrogenation of propene.

So, the combustion of propene would be:

(CH3CH2CH3's combustion) + (CH3CH2CH3 → CH2=CH2CH3 + H2).

Wait, but that doesn't directly give me the combustion of propene. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the combustion of propene in terms of propane's combustion.

Wait, let's consider the number of H atoms. Propane has 8 H, propene has 6 H. So propane has 2 more H atoms.

So, when propane combusts, it produces 4 H2O (which has 8 H in total). Propene, when it combusts, produces 3 H2O (6 H). So, the difference is one H2O less when moving from propane to propene.

Wait, perhaps I can write the combustion of propene as propane's combustion minus the hydrogenation reaction, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's try again. Let me write the two reactions.

Reaction 1: C3H6 + H2 → C3H8; ΔH = -124 kJ.

Reaction 2: C3H8 +5 O2 →3 CO2 +4 H2O; ΔH = -2222 kJ.

I need Reaction 3: C3H6 + x O2 →3 CO2 +3 H2O; ΔH = ?

So, how to get Reaction 3 from Reactions 1 and 2.

Let me try to express Reaction 3 as Reaction 2 minus Reaction 1. Wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, let me think of Reaction 3 as Reaction 2 minus Reaction 1. So:

Reaction 2: C3H8 +5 O2 →3 CO2 +4 H2O.

Reaction 1: C3H6 + H2 → C3H8.

So, if I subtract Reaction 1 from Reaction 2, I get:

(C3H8 +5 O2) - (C3H6 + H2) → (3 CO2 +4 H2O) - C3H8.

But when I subtract reactions, I subtract the entire equation, so:

C3H8 +5 O2 - C3H6 - H2 →3 CO2 +4 H2O - C3H8.

Simplify the left side: C3H8 - C3H6 = C3H8 - C3H6 = (they have the same C, but H8 vs H6, so that's 2 H). So, C3H8 - C3H6 = 2 H.

So, left side becomes: 5 O2 - H2 +2 H = 5 O2 + H2.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I should write Reaction 3 as Reaction 2 plus (reverse of Reaction 1), but adjusted for moles.

Wait, let me write Reaction 1 as:

C3H6 + H2 → C3H8; ΔH = -124.

Reverse Reaction 1: C3H8 → C3H6 + H2; ΔH = +124.

So, if I have Reaction 2 (C3H8 +5 O2 → products) and then add Reverse Reaction 1 (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2), perhaps I can get something.

But when I add them:

C3H8 +5 O2 + C3H8 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O + C3H6 + H2.

Wait, that's 2 C3H8 on the left, which might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I should take Reaction 2 and subtract Reaction 1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the enthalpy change of the combustion of propene by using the enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't give me the standard enthalpies of formation, so perhaps that's not the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I can use the given reactions to find the desired ΔH.

Wait, another approach: The combustion of propene is exothermic, and the given options have various negative values. The options are -124, which is the hydrogenation, and others like -2222, which is propane's combustion.

I think I need to find the enthalpy change when propene combusts. Let's see, perhaps I can relate the combustion of propene to propane's combustion.

Let me think: Combustion of propene (C3H6) can be thought of as the combustion of propane (C3H8) minus the addition of H2 (since propene is C3H6, which is two H less than propane).

Wait, but that might not be directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the combustion of propene as:

C3H6 + 5 O2 →3 CO2 +3 H2O.

And the combustion of propane is C3H8 +5 O2 →3 CO2 +4 H2O.

So, the difference between the two is that propane has two more H atoms than propene. So, when propane combusts, it produces one more H2O molecule than propene.

So, the combustion of propene would produce 3 H2O, while propane's combustion produces 4 H2O.

So, perhaps the ΔH for propene's combustion is the propane's ΔH plus the enthalpy change for removing an H2O and adjusting for the H.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, think about the enthalpy of combustion of propene as propane's combustion plus the enthalpy change when propane loses H2 to become propene.

So, when propane becomes propene, it releases H2. The enthalpy change for that is Reaction 1 reversed, which is +124 kJ.

So, the combustion of propene would be propane's combustion plus the enthalpy change of converting propane to propene plus H2. Because when you combust propene, you're effectively combust propane but without that last H2 addition.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

Combustion of propene = Combustion of propane - (Hydrogenation of propene).

Because when you hydrogenate propene, you're adding H2 to make propane, which releases energy. So, going the other way (dehydrogenation) would require energy, so the combustion of propene would be less exothermic than propane's.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think in terms of equations.

Let me write:

Desired reaction: C3H6 +5 O2 →3 CO2 +3 H2O; ΔH = ?

We have Reaction 2: C3H8 +5 O2 →3 CO2 +4 H2O; ΔH = -2222.

And Reaction 1: C3H6 + H2 → C3H8; ΔH = -124.

If I subtract Reaction 1 from Reaction 2, I get:

(C3H8 +5 O2) - (C3H6 + H2) → (3 CO2 +4 H2O) - C3H8.

Simplify the left side: C3H8 - C3H6 = (same C3) but H8 - H6 = 2 H, so 2 H.

So, left side becomes: 5 O2 - H2 +2 H → 5 O2 + H2 (since 2H is H2).

Wait, this is getting messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can express Reaction 3 as Reaction 2 minus Reaction 1.

So, ΔH3 = ΔH2 - ΔH1.

Wait, no, because Reaction 1 is C3H6 + H2 → C3H8. So, if I subtract Reaction 1 from Reaction 2, I get:

Reaction 2: C
