Question:

A 70-year-old woman comes to the office because of worsening tremor of her hands. The tremor has been present for most of her life and initially was mild and would occur only when she was tired or stressed. During the past month the shaking has become more noticeable and frequent. She is now embarrassed to eat with other people because of how obvious the tremor has become. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help her to cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. Medical history is also remarkable for essential hypertension controlled with lisinopril and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. Her only other medication is occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. She used to drink one to two alcoholic beverages monthly but now drinks one glass of wine daily because, she says, it reduces her tremor. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (155 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a moderate tremor of both hands that is not present at rest. Complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests are ordered and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor?

Options:

A: Early Parkinson disease
B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy
C: Adverse effect of atorvastatin therapy
D: Adverse effect of ibuprofen therapy
E: Increase in alcohol consumption
F: Hyperthyroidism
G: Bereavement reaction
H: Adverse effect of lisinopril therapy
I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress
J: Onset of multiple sclerosis

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a worsening tremor in her hands. She's had the tremor most of her life, but it was mild and only happened when she was stressed or tired. Recently, over the past month, it's become more noticeable and frequent. She's embarrassed to eat with others because of it.

Her medications include fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks, which she started after her husband's death two months ago. She's also taking lisinopril for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. Occasionally, she takes ibuprofen for joint pain. She's increased her alcohol intake from one or two drinks a month to one glass of wine daily, which she says helps her tremor.

She's 5'6" and 70 kg, so her BMI is 25, which is normal. Vitals are all within normal ranges. On physical exam, there's a moderate tremor in both hands, but it's not present at rest. They've ordered blood tests, including thyroid function, but the results aren't in yet.

The question is asking for the most likely cause of her worsening tremor.

Alright, let's think about the possible causes of tremors. The key types are resting tremors, action tremors, and others. Resting tremors are usually associated with Parkinson's disease and are present when the limb is at rest. Action tremors occur during voluntary movement and can be seen in essential tremor, which is often familial.

The patient's tremor isn't present at rest, so that makes me think it's an action tremor, possibly essential tremor. She's had it most of her life, which supports the idea of essential tremor, as it's typically a long-standing condition.

Now, what could be causing it to worsen? She's started fluoxetine recently. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, and SSRIs can cause tremors as a side effect. So that's a possibility. Also, she's been stressed due to bereavement, which can exacerbate essential tremor because stress is a known trigger.

Other medications she's taking: lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, and I don't recall that causing tremors. Atorvastatin is a statin; again, not a common cause of tremors. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, which I don't think is linked to tremors either. So options B, C, D, H are possibilities, but B (fluoxetine) seems more likely than the others.

She's increased her alcohol consumption. Alcohol is interesting because in some cases, like essential tremor, small amounts of alcohol can temporarily reduce the tremor. So she's drinking more now, which might be self-medicating, but it's not causing the tremor to worsen. In fact, if she's using it to reduce tremors, but the tremor is getting worse, maybe something else is going on.

Her thyroid function tests are pending. Hyperthyroidism (option F) can cause tremors, so that's a consideration. If she has hyperthyroidism, the tremor might be worse. But she's had this tremor her whole life, so if it's essential tremor, and now it's getting worse, maybe hyperthyroidism is contributing. But without the test results, it's speculative.

Her vital signs are normal, so signs of hyperthyroidism like tachycardia aren't present. Her pulse is 80, which is within normal range, so maybe less likely. But she's 70, and hyperthyroidism can present differently in the elderly.

Bereavement reaction (option G) is about emotional distress, but that wouldn't directly cause a tremor, though stress could exacerbate essential tremor.

So putting it together: she's had essential tremor for a long time, action type since it's not at rest. Now, possible exacerbating factors are stress (bereavement) and maybe fluoxetine.

Fluoxetine can cause tremors as a side effect. She started it three weeks ago, and the tremor worsened in the past month. So timing-wise, that fits. Alternatively, the stress of losing her husband could be making her essential tremor worse.

So the question is whether the worsening is due to the medication or the stress.

Her tremor was mild before but has become more noticeable. The fact that she started fluoxetine recently might indicate it's a drug side effect. But she's also under a lot of stress, which is a known exacerbating factor for essential tremor.

Looking at the options, the question is asking for the most likely cause. The options are:

I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress.

B: Adverse effect of fluoxetine.

So which is more likely? The patient has a long-standing history of tremor, so it's probably essential tremor. The recent worsening could be due to stress (bereavement) or the new medication.

Fluoxetine can cause tremors, but does it usually cause a significant worsening in someone with pre-existing essential tremor? Or would stress be more the culprit?

Alternatively, maybe both factors are contributing. But the question is which is the most likely cause.

I think that in this scenario, the fact that she started fluoxetine three weeks ago and the tremor worsened in the past month suggests that the medication could be contributing. However, essential tremor often worsens with stress, and the timing of her husband's death coinciding with the tremor worsening is also a consideration.

Wait, she started the medication three weeks ago, but the tremor has been worsening over the past month. So maybe the stress started two months ago when her husband died, and the tremor started getting worse then, before she started the medication. So perhaps the stress is the main factor.

Additionally, alcohol is helping her, which is more consistent with essential tremor.

So perhaps the most likely answer is I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress.

But wait, the question is about the cause of the worsening. Is it possible that the fluoxetine is making it worse on top of the stress?

Alternatively, could it be hyperthyroidism? But without knowing the test results, it's hard to say. The fact that her thyroid function tests are pending might be a hint, but the other information points more towards stress or medication.

I think the correct answer is either B or I.

Another point: Essential tremor is often exacerbated by stress, caffeine, fatigue, etc. So the recent stress from bereavement could explain the worsening.

But the fluoxetine could also cause or worsen tremor. So which is more likely?

Fluoxetine-induced tremor is a known side effect, and it can present as an action tremor. So if she started it three weeks ago, the tremor could have worsened due to the medication.

So perhaps the answer is B.

Wait, but the tremor was already present and mild. The fluoxetine might have made it worse. So the worsening could be due to the drug.

Alternatively, the stress from the bereavement could have exacerbated her essential tremor.

So how to decide between B and I.

The question is asking for the most likely cause. The patient's history is of essential tremor, and the recent worsening coincides with both starting the medication and the bereavement.

In clinical practice, both factors could contribute, but the question is looking for the single most likely cause.

I think that the initiation of fluoxetine is a strong contender because it's a new medication that can cause tremors. But in this case, the tremor was already present, so perhaps the fluoxetine is exacerbating it.

Alternatively, the stress of the bereavement is the cause, as stress is a known exacerbating factor.

I think the answer is I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress.

Wait, but the options are: option I says 'exacerbated by stress', which is her current situation. However, the patient also started a medication that can cause tremors.

Hmm. Another approach: what is the most likely diagnosis? The fact that the tremor is action-type and has been present for most of her life points to essential tremor. So the worsening is likely due to an exacerbating factor.

So the most likely cause is exacerbation due to stress (option I).

But the fluoxetine could also be contributing. So it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, the correct answer might be B, the adverse effect of fluoxetine.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the timing. The tremor started worsening in the past month. She started the medication three weeks ago. So the worsening began a month ago, before she started the medication. So the initial worsening could be due to stress, and then perhaps the medication made it worse.

But the question is which is the most likely cause of the worsening. So if the initial worsening was due to stress, and then the medication adding to it, but the question is about the cause, perhaps the most likely is the exacerbation due to stress.

Alternatively, the fluoxetine could have increased the tremor, but the question is, which is more likely.

I think I'm going to lean towards I: Essential tremor exacerbated by stress. Because the underlying condition is essential tremor, and stress is a known trigger, and the timing of the husband's death aligns with the worsening.

So the answer is I.

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a long-standing history of tremor, which has recently worsened. The tremor is action-type, as it is not present at rest, and has been exacerbated by stress, particularly following the death of her husband two months ago. She also started fluoxetine three weeks ago, which is known to cause tremors as a side effect. Other medications, such as lisinopril, atorvastatin, and ibuprofen, are less likely to contribute to the worsening tremor. While hyperthyroidism could cause tremors, her normal vital signs and the absence of specific symptoms make this less likely. 

The worsening tremor is most likely due to the exacerbation of her pre-existing essential tremor, which is often worsened by stress. Although fluoxetine could contribute, the timing of the worsening (beginning before the medication was started) and the patient's history strongly suggest stress as the primary factor. Therefore, the most likely cause is essential tremor exacerbated by stress.

Answer: I
