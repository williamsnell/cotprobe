Question:

Four days after undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of a fracture of the right femur sustained in a motor vehicle collision, a 47-year-old man continues to have agitation and confusion despite treatment with haloperidol. He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?

Options:

A: Adverse effect of medication
B: Alcohol withdrawal
C: Fat emboli
D: Sepsis

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the best answer. Let me read it carefully.

The patient is a 47-year-old man who had open reduction and internal fixation of a right femur fracture four days ago after a motor vehicle collision. Now, he's showing agitation and confusion despite being treated with haloperidol. His other medications are acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His vitals are a bit elevated: temp 37.2°C, pulse 98, respirations 24, BP 168/98. On exam, he's uncooperative, tremulous, and not oriented to place or time. CT head is normal.

So the question is, what's causing his symptoms? The options are A to D: Adverse effect of medication, Alcohol withdrawal, Fat emboli, Sepsis.

Hmm. Let's think step by step.

First, the patient's agitation and confusion didn't improve with haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic often used for delirium. So maybe it's something else causing the delirium.

His medications: acetaminophen is unlikely to cause confusion. Atenolol is a beta-blocker; I don't think it causes delirium. Heparin is for blood thinning, probably not related here.

His temperature is slightly elevated but not high. Pulse is up, BP is high. No focal neuro findings on CT, so probably not a stroke or anything structural.

What causes delirium in a post-surgical patient? A few possibilities come to mind. One is delirium tremens from alcohol withdrawal. Another could be medication side effects, maybe from the anesthetics or pain meds. Or maybe it's a systemic issue like sepsis or fat embolism.

Wait, he's on acetaminophen, so maybe not opioid-induced. But he might be on other pain meds not listed. But given the options, let's think.

Alcohol withdrawal: He's four days post-op. If he were an alcoholic, withdrawal could start around 48-72 hours after last drink. So four days is possible. Symptoms include agitation, confusion, tremors, hypertension, tachycardia. His exam shows tremulousness, which fits. His BP and pulse are up, which also fits. But the question is, do we have any info about his alcohol use? The question doesn't say. So maybe, but it's possible.

Another option is fat embolism. Fat embolism syndrome typically occurs after long bone fractures, like femur. It usually presents with respiratory distress, neurological symptoms, and petechiae. The timeframe is usually within 24-72 hours post-injury, which is about when he is now—four days post-op. But wait, he's four days post-op, so maybe a bit late? Not sure. Also, his CT head is normal, but fat emboli can cause microemboli leading to confusion. His respiratory rate is a bit elevated, but no mention of hypoxia or other respiratory issues. So maybe, but not sure.

Sepsis: His temp is slightly elevated, HR is up, BP is high but not low. Could be early sepsis, but usually you'd expect more signs like leukocytosis, maybe focal infection source. The question doesn't mention any other signs of infection, like wound issues or urinary issues. So maybe less likely.

Adverse effect of medication: The only psych meds mentioned are haloperidol, which can have side effects like extrapyramidal symptoms, but he's already on it and it's not helping. Other medications don't seem likely to cause confusion. Unless it's from something else not listed, like anesthetics or antibiotics. But the question doesn't give that info.

So, putting it together. The patient has confusion, agitation, tremors, hypertension, tachycardia. No signs of infection. Head CT is normal.

Alcohol withdrawal is a possibility. But without knowing his history, it's hard to confirm. Alternatively, fat embolism could cause confusion, but usually with more respiratory issues. Or maybe it's another cause.

Wait, another possibility is delirium caused by pain, but he's on acetaminophen, which might not be enough. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is due to the medications he's taking. For example, atenolol is a beta-blocker. I don't think it usually causes delirium, but maybe in some cases. Or maybe heparin? No, heparin doesn't cause that.

Alternatively, maybe the haloperidol is contributing. But he's being treated with it for agitation, so unlikely to be the cause.

So, the options are alcohol withdrawal, fat embolism, sepsis, or medication adverse effect.

The key points are: he's post femur fracture, which is a long bone, so fat embolism is a risk. Fat embolism syndrome can present with confusion, respiratory issues, and sometimes skin petechiae. His respiratory rate is 24, which is a bit elevated, but maybe not bad. The CT head is normal, so no big infarcts.

Wait, but fat embolism can cause a spectrum of symptoms. The classic triad is respiratory distress, neurological abnormalities, and petechial rash. He has some neurological symptoms. But the absence of rash and maybe not enough respiratory issues might make this less likely.

On the other hand, alcohol withdrawal is a common cause of delirium in hospitalized patients, especially if they have a history of alcohol use. The timing fits, as withdrawal symptoms can start 48-72 hours after last drink, so four days post-op could be peak around day 4-5.

His symptoms: confusion, agitation, tremors, hypertension, tachycardia. That fits with alcohol withdrawal. But without knowing his history, it's tricky.

Wait, the question says he's been treated with haloperidol, which is often used in alcohol withdrawal but isn't always effective, especially if benzodiazepines aren't used.

Another thought: in a trauma patient, especially with femur fracture, fat embolism is a known complication. It can cause confusion, altered mental status, and even seizures. So in that case, maybe it's C: Fat emboli.

But I'm a bit confused between B and C.

Alternatively, maybe sepsis is causing delirium. He's got a slightly elevated temp, but his BP is high, which is unusual for sepsis (usually hypotension). So maybe not sepsis.

So, the options are narrowing down to B or C.

The key is the context. Four days after a femur fracture, and he's confused. Fat embolism is a possibility, but the timing is a bit off because fat embolism usually occurs earlier, like within 24-48 hours after injury.

Wait, no. The patient had a motor vehicle collision, which likely caused the femur fracture. He is four days post-op now. So the fat embolism could have occurred anytime after the injury, but sometimes the symptoms can be delayed.

Alternatively, alcohol withdrawal could occur if he was a chronic user and didn't get any alcohol or benzodiazepines post-op.

So, without more info, which is more likely?

In a trauma patient with a femur fracture and confusion, fat embolism should be considered. But in a 47-year-old, especially if he has a history of alcohol, that's another angle.

But the question says he's on atenolol, which is a beta-blocker. Wait, if he's in alcohol withdrawal, beta-blockers can sometimes be used to manage the symptoms, but they don't treat the underlying cause. But he's still having symptoms despite that.

Alternatively, maybe the cause is the fat embolism. So I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another thought. Fat embolism can also lead to anemia and thrombocytopenia, but the question doesn't mention lab results.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the most likely cause is alcohol withdrawal. Because the presentation fits, and in a hospital setting, especially in someone who maybe wasn't screened for alcohol use, this could happen.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the confusion is due to the medications he's receiving, but I don't see any that are known to cause confusion except maybe the haloperidol, which is being used to treat it.

Wait, but he's on atenolol. Beta-blockers can cause delirium in some cases, but it's rare. I think it's more likely that his confusion is due to an external cause.

Given all this, I think the most likely answer is B: Alcohol withdrawal.

But wait, another angle: The patient's CT is normal, so structural issues are ruled out. The other options are systemic causes.

So, I'm going to go with B: Alcohol withdrawal.

The patient is a 47-year-old man who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a femur fracture after a motor vehicle collision. Four days post-operatively, he exhibits agitation, confusion, tremulousness, and disorientation, despite treatment with haloperidol. His vital signs show mild hypertension, tachycardia, and slightly elevated temperature. The CT head is normal, ruling out structural neurological causes. His medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic heparin, none of which are likely to cause confusion.

The differential diagnosis includes:

1. **Alcohol withdrawal**: The patient’s symptoms (agitation, confusion, tremors, hypertension, tachycardia) align with alcohol withdrawal, which can occur 48-72 hours after the last drink. However, the question does not provide a history of alcohol use, making this diagnosis less certain.

2. **Fat embolism**: Fat embolism syndrome is a known complication of long bone fractures like femur fractures. It typically presents with respiratory distress, neurological abnormalities, and petechiae. While the patient has neurological symptoms and an elevated respiratory rate, the absence of petechiae and significant respiratory distress makes this less likely.

3. **Sepsis**: Sepsis is unlikely given the lack of hypotension, leukocytosis, or other signs of infection. The slightly elevated temperature and tachycardia are nonspecific and could be explained by other causes.

4. **Adverse effect of medication**: None of the patient’s medications, including haloperidol, are known to cause confusion in this context. Atenolol, while a beta-blocker, rarely causes delirium.

Given the patient’s symptoms, the most likely cause is **alcohol withdrawal**, as it explains the agitation, confusion, tremors, and vital sign abnormalities. While fat embolism is a consideration, the lack of respiratory distress and petechiae makes it less likely. Sepsis and medication side effects are also less consistent with the presentation.
