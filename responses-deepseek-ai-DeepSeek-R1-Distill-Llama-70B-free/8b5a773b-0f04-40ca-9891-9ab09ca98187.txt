Okay, I need to figure out this question about how receptors in the retina differ from those in the cochlea. Let me think through this step by step.

So the question is about functional differences between retinal receptors and cochlear receptors. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different aspect.

First, I remember that the retina contains photoreceptor cells like rods and cones. These are responsible for detecting light and color. The cochlea, on the other hand, has hair cells that detect sound vibrations. Both are sensory receptors but for different stimuli.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Magnitude of resting potentials. Both have resting potentials, but I'm not sure how different they are. Maybe photoreceptors have a different resting potential than hair cells? Not sure if that's the main functional difference.

Option B: Size and structure. Well, rods and cones are different from hair cells. But the question is about function, not structure. So maybe B isn't the right choice.

Option C: Ability to regenerate. I remember that in mammals, retinal cells don't regenerate much, especially in adults. Cochlear hair cells also have limited regeneration in humans, but in some other animals, they can regenerate. But wait, maybe the difference is that one can't regenerate and the other can? Or is it the same? Not certain. Maybe this isn't the main point.

Option D: Speed of signal transmission. Both are sensory receptors, but speed might depend on the type of signal. Light and sound might have different processing speeds, but I'm not sure if the receptors themselves differ much in transmission speed. Maybe D isn't it.

Option E: Number of axons each cell has. Hmm, photoreceptors in the retina don't have axons. Instead, they have synapses that connect to bipolar cells. Cochlear hair cells also don't have axons; they connect to the auditory nerve via synapses. So maybe both don't have axons, so E isn't the difference.

Option F: Ions involved in action potentials. Both use ions like Na+ and K+. But wait, photoreceptors might have different ion channels. For example, in rods, light causes a hyperpolarization by closing Na+ channels. Cochlear hair cells have mechanically gated ion channels that let in K+ when the hair bundle is bent. So the ions involved in their signaling might differ. But does that translate to their action potentials? Hmm, not sure.

Option G: Degree of sensitivity. Retinal receptors are sensitive to light, which can vary widely in intensity, leading to sensitivity. Cochlear receptors are sensitive to sound vibrations, which also vary, but I'm not sure if one is more sensitive than the other in terms of function. Maybe not the key difference.

Option H: Length of refractory periods. Refractory periods relate to how quickly a cell can respond again after being stimulated. The type of stimuli (light vs sound) might influence this, but I don't remember specifics on how different these receptors are in this aspect. Not the main functional difference, I think.

Option I: Location of synapses. Both have synapses, but where? Photoreceptors synapse with bipolar cells in the retina. Cochlear hair cells synapse with the auditory nerve fibers. The location is different, but the question is about functional differences. Maybe the structure is more about where they are, but functionally, perhaps it's the same in terms of transmitting signals.

Option J: Types of energy they transduce. Oh wait, this seems important. Retinal receptors transduce light energy (photons) into electrical signals. Cochlear receptors transduce mechanical energy (sound vibrations) into electrical signals. So they're dealing with different forms of energy. That sounds like a fundamental functional difference.

So putting it together, the correct answer is J: types of energy they transduce. Because retinal receptors handle light (electromagnetic) and cochlear handle mechanical (sound).

The question asks about the functional differences between receptors in the retina of the eye and those in the cochlea of the ear. Retinal receptors, such as rods and cones, are specialized to detect light and color, transducing electromagnetic energy into electrical signals. In contrast, cochlear receptors, like hair cells, detect mechanical vibrations from sound, transducing mechanical energy into electrical signals. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Both receptors have resting potentials, but this is not their main functional difference.
- **B**: While their structures differ, the question focuses on functional differences.
- **C**: Both have limited regeneration in humans, so this is not a key distinction.
- **D**: The speed of signal transmission is not the primary functional difference.
- **E**: Neither type possesses axons, so this does not differentiate them.
- **F**: While ion channels differ, this is not the most fundamental functional distinction.
- **G**: Sensitivity to stimuli is not the defining difference.
- **H**: Refractory periods are not the main distinction.
- **I**: Synapse locations differ, but this is more structural than functional.
- **J**: The types of energy transduced (light vs. sound) represent the most significant functional difference.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**, as retinal receptors transduce electromagnetic energy, while cochlear receptors transduce mechanical energy.
