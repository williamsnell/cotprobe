The second of these contained a solution of silver nitrate (AgNO_3) and exhibited the following cathode reaction: Ag^+ + e^- \rightarrow Ag(s).

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrolysis. Hmm, I remember that when electricity passes through an electrolytic cell, metal ions get deposited at the cathode. The question gives me two different cells with copper sulfate and silver nitrate solutions. Both involve depositing metals at the cathode.

The first cell uses copper sulfate. The reaction is Cu²+ + 2e⁻ → Cu(s). So for each copper ion, two electrons are gained. The second cell uses silver nitrate, reaction is Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag(s). Here, each silver ion takes one electron.

The problem states that the same quantity of electricity is passed through both cells. I think that means the same amount of charge (in coulombs) is used in both cases. The question says 3.18 grams of copper were deposited in the first cell, and we need to find out how much silver was deposited in the second.

Wait, I remember Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The first law states that the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the quantity of electricity used. The second law says that the amount is also proportional to the equivalent weight of the substance. Oh right, equivalent weight is molar mass divided by the number of electrons involved (the valency).

So I think I should calculate the amount of charge used in the first cell and then apply it to the second cell to find the mass of silver deposited.

First, for copper: the molar mass of Cu is about 63.55 g/mol. The reaction shows that 2 moles of electrons are needed per mole of Cu²+ ions. So the equivalent weight for copper would be 63.55 g / 2 = 31.775 g per equivalent.

The mass deposited is 3.18g. Using Faraday's law, mass deposited equals (equivalent weight) × (charge passed in faradays). Wait, more precisely, the formula is:

mass = (equivalent weight) × (Q / F)

Wait no, wait, I think the formula is mass = (molar mass × Q) / (n × F), where n is the number of electrons, and F is Faraday's constant.

But maybe an easier approach is to compute the moles of electrons (charge) passed in the first cell, then use that same charge for the second.

Let me think again. The mass of copper is 3.18 grams. Moles of Cu deposited is 3.18g / 63.55 g/mol ≈ 0.05 mol.

Each mole of Cu deposits requires 2 moles of electrons. So the total electrons passed in the first cell is 0.05 mol × 2 = 0.1 mol of electrons.

Now, the charge Q is moles of electrons × Faraday's constant (which is 96485 C/mol). So Q = 0.1 × 96485 = 9648.5 C.

Wait wait, but wait. The same quantity of electricity is used in both cells. So the second cell will have the same charge, 9648.5 C.

Now, for the silver cell. The reaction is Ag⁺ + e⁻ → Ag. So each Ag⁺ needs 1 electron. So the moles of electrons needed per mole of Ag is 1.

So, the moles of electrons in the second cell is Q / F = 9648.5 / 96485 ≈ 0.1 mol of electrons.

Since each Ag requires 1 e⁻, the moles of Ag deposited will be equal to the moles of electrons. So moles of Ag is 0.1 mol.

The molar mass of Ag is about 107.87 g/mol. So mass of Ag is 0.1 × 107.87 = 10.787 grams.

Looking at the options, option D is 10.8g, which matches this. So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis, which relate the amount of substance deposited at an electrode to the quantity of electricity passed through the cell. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Copper Cell Analysis**:  
   - The cathode reaction is:  
     \[
     \text{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu(s)}
     \]  
     Here, 2 moles of electrons are required to deposit 1 mole of copper.  
   - The molar mass of copper is \( 63.55 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   - The mass of copper deposited is \( 3.18 \, \text{g} \), so the moles of copper deposited are:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of Cu} = \frac{3.18}{63.55} \approx 0.05 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
   - Since 2 moles of electrons are required per mole of copper, the total moles of electrons passed in the first cell are:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of electrons} = 0.05 \times 2 = 0.1 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
   - The charge passed is calculated using Faraday's constant (\( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \)):  
     \[
     Q = 0.1 \times 96485 = 9648.5 \, \text{C}
     \]

2. **Silver Cell Analysis**:  
   - The cathode reaction is:  
     \[
     \text{Ag}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag(s)}
     \]  
     Here, 1 mole of electrons deposits 1 mole of silver.  
   - The molar mass of silver is \( 107.87 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   - Since the same charge (\( Q = 9648.5 \, \text{C} \)) is passed through the second cell, the moles of electrons passed are:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of electrons} = \frac{9648.5}{96485} \approx 0.1 \, \text{mol}
     \]  
   - Because 1 mole of electrons deposits 1 mole of silver, the moles of silver deposited are also \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - The mass of silver deposited is:  
     \[
     \text{Mass of Ag} = 0.1 \times 107.87 = 10.787 \, \text{g}
     \]

3. **Final Answer**:  
   The mass of silver deposited is approximately \( 10.8 \, \text{g} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
