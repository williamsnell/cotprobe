Okay, so I've got this problem here about two curves intersecting and finding the area between them from x=0 to their next intersection point a. Hmm. Let's see what I can do.

The curves are y = (sin x + cos x)^4 and y = (sin x - cos x)^4. They intersect at x=0, and I need to find the next smallest positive x where they intersect again, which is a, and then compute the area between them from 0 to a.

First, I think I should find where they intersect. So set the two functions equal to each other:

(sin x + cos x)^4 = (sin x - cos x)^4.

Hmm, taking the fourth power of both sides. Maybe I can take the square roots to simplify, but since it's to the fourth power, perhaps expanding might help. Wait, alternatively, maybe it's easier to notice that both expressions squared would be (sin x + cos x)^2 and (sin x - cos x)^2. Let's compute those first.

I remember that (sin x + cos x)^2 = sin^2 x + 2 sin x cos x + cos^2 x = 1 + sin 2x, because sin^2 + cos^2 is 1 and 2 sin x cos x is sin 2x.

Similarly, (sin x - cos x)^2 = sin^2 x - 2 sin x cos x + cos^2 x = 1 - sin 2x.

So, (sin x + cos x)^4 is [(1 + sin 2x)]^2, and (sin x - cos x)^4 is [(1 - sin 2x)]^2.

Wait, no, because (a)^4 is (a^2)^2. So let me compute those:

Let me write y1 = (sin x + cos x)^4 = [ (sin x + cos x)^2 ]^2 = (1 + sin 2x)^2.

Similarly, y2 = (sin x - cos x)^4 = [ (sin x - cos x)^2 ]^2 = (1 - sin 2x)^2.

So setting y1 = y2:

(1 + sin 2x)^2 = (1 - sin 2x)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left side: 1 + 2 sin 2x + sin^2 2x.

Right side: 1 - 2 sin 2x + sin^2 2x.

Subtract right from left:

(1 + 2 sin 2x + sin^2 2x) - (1 - 2 sin 2x + sin^2 2x) = 4 sin 2x.

So 4 sin 2x = 0.

So 4 sin 2x = 0 → sin 2x = 0.

So 2x = nπ, where n is integer → x = nπ/2.

So the solutions are x = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, etc. But since the question says a is the smallest positive x after 0 where they intersect, that would be at x = π/2, I think. Because the next one after 0 is π/2.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me check that. Because x=0 is the first point. The next solution is when sin 2x is zero again. So 2x = π → x=π/2. So a=π/2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the functions are raised to the fourth power, could there be other solutions where the signs change but the fourth powers are the same?

Wait, no, because when you take the square of (1 + sin2x) and (1 - sin2x), their squares would be equal only when either 1 + sin2x = 1 - sin2x → sin2x =0, or 1 + sin2x = - (1 - sin2x) → 1 + sin2x = -1 + sin2x → 1 = -1, which is impossible. So the only solutions are where sin2x=0, so x = 0, π/2, π, etc. So a=π/2 is correct.

Now, I need to find the area between these two curves from x=0 to x=a=π/2.

So the area is the integral from 0 to a of |y1 - y2| dx.

Since both y1 and y2 are squares, which are positive, but which one is larger where?

Let me see. Let's compute y1 and y2.

We have y1 = (1 + sin2x)^2 = 1 + 2 sin2x + sin^2 2x.

y2 = (1 - sin2x)^2 = 1 - 2 sin2x + sin^2 2x.

So y1 - y2 = (1 + 2 sin2x + sin^2 2x) - (1 - 2 sin2x + sin^2 2x) = 4 sin2x.

So |y1 - y2| = |4 sin2x|.

But wait, from x=0 to x=π/2, 2x goes from 0 to π. So sin2x is positive in (0, π), so |4 sin2x|=4 sin2x.

So the area is the integral from 0 to π/2 of 4 sin2x dx.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, y1 and y2 can switch which is bigger. Let me check for x between 0 and a=π/2.

At x=0, sin2x=0, so y1 = (0 + 1)^4 = 1, y2 = (0 - 1)^4 = 1, so same.

At x=π/4, sin2x = sin(π/2)=1. So y1=(1+1)^4=16, y2=(1-1)^4=0. So y1 > y2.

Wait, but wait, at x=π/4, which is halfway to a=π/2, that's correct. So from 0 to a=π/2, y1 is greater than y2. So the area is the integral from 0 to π/2 of (y1 - y2) dx, which is the integral of 4 sin2x dx.

But let's compute that.

Integral of 4 sin2x dx from 0 to π/2.

The integral of sin(ax) dx is -(1/a) cos(ax).

So integral 4 sin2x dx = 4 * (-1/2) cos2x ) + C = -2 cos2x + C.

Evaluated from 0 to π/2:

At π/2: -2 cos(2*(π/2))= -2 cos(π) = -2*(-1) = 2.

At 0: -2 cos(0) = -2*(1) = -2.

So the difference is 2 - (-2) = 4.

So the area is 4. Wait, but 4 is one of the options, option I.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let's compute the integral again.

The integral of 4 sin2x dx from 0 to π/2.

The antiderivative of sin2x is (-1/2) cos2x, so 4 times that is -2 cos2x.

Evaluated at π/2:

-2 cos(2*(π/2)) = -2 cos(π) = -2*(-1) = 2.

Evaluated at 0:

-2 cos(0) = -2*(1) = -2.

So subtracting, 2 - (-2) = 4.

So the area is 4, which is option I.

To determine the area between the curves \( y = (\sin x + \cos x)^4 \) and \( y = (\sin x - \cos x)^4 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = a \), we first find the points of intersection by setting the two functions equal:

\[
(\sin x + \cos x)^4 = (\sin x - \cos x)^4.
\]

Expanding both sides, we compute:

\[
(\sin x + \cos x)^2 = 1 + \sin 2x, \quad (\sin x - \cos x)^2 = 1 - \sin 2x.
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
(1 + \sin 2x)^2 = (1 - \sin 2x)^2.
\]

Expanding further:

\[
1 + 2 \sin 2x + \sin^2 2x = 1 - 2 \sin 2x + \sin^2 2x.
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
4 \sin 2x = 0 \implies \sin 2x = 0.
\]

The solutions are \( 2x = n\pi \), or \( x = \frac{n\pi}{2} \), where \( n \) is an integer. The smallest positive value of \( x \) after \( x = 0 \) is \( a = \frac{\pi}{2} \).

Next, we compute the area between the curves from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \). The curves are given by:

\[
y_1 = (\sin x + \cos x)^4 = (1 + \sin 2x)^2, \quad y_2 = (\sin x - \cos x)^4 = (1 - \sin 2x)^2.
\]

The difference between the two functions is:

\[
y_1 - y_2 = (1 + \sin 2x)^2 - (1 - \sin 2x)^2 = 4 \sin 2x.
\]

The area is the integral of the absolute value of this difference:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} |4 \sin 2x| \, dx.
\]

Since \( \sin 2x \geq 0 \) for \( x \in [0, \frac{\pi}{2}] \), we can drop the absolute value:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} 4 \sin 2x \, dx.
\]

The antiderivative of \( \sin 2x \) is \( -\frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \), so:

\[
\text{Area} = 4 \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \cos 2x \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = -2 \left[ \cos 2x \right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}.
\]

Evaluating at the bounds:

\[
\cos \left( 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \cos \pi = -1, \quad \cos(2 \cdot 0) = \cos 0 = 1.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Area} = -2 \left[ -1 - 1 \right] = -2 \cdot (-2) = 4.
\]

The area between the curves from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \) is \( 4 \).

The correct answer is:

**I: 4**
