Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the interest rate George Mason is paying on his piano purchase. Let's see, the piano costs $8,650. He made a down payment of $1,000, so the remaining balance must be $8,650 minus $1,000, which is $7,650. He's paying this off in 20 equal monthly installments of $425 each. I need to find the interest rate he's paying, rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent.

Hmm, I think this is a problem involving the time value of money, specifically an installment loan. So I remember that the present value of an annuity can be calculated using the present value formula. The formula for the present value (PV) of an ordinary annuity is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where:
- PV is the present value (the amount he owes, $7,650)
- PMT is the monthly payment ($425)
- r is the monthly interest rate (which we'll need to find)
- n is the number of periods (20 months)

So plugging in the numbers we have:

7,650 = 425 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-20 ) / r ]

I need to solve for r. This equation doesn't have a straightforward algebraic solution because r is in both the numerator and the denominator, and it's also an exponent. So I think the best approach here is to use trial and error or some approximation method.

Alternatively, I remember there's something called the Rule of 78 or other methods, but I don't think that applies here. Maybe I should use the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots, but that might be a bit complicated.

Alternatively, I can use an iterative approach, plugging in different interest rates until I find the one that makes the equation hold true.

Let me try to rearrange the equation to make it easier. Let me denote:

(1 - (1 + r)^-20 ) / r = 7,650 / 425

Calculating the right side: 7,650 / 425 = 18. So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-20 ) / r = 18

So,

1 - (1/(1 + r)^20 ) = 18r

Or,

(1/(1 + r)^20 ) = 1 - 18r

Wait, that doesn't look right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in rearranging. Let me check again.

Wait, the left side is (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r = 18. So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-20 ) = 18r

So,

1 - 18r = (1 + r)^-20

Hmm, this still looks tricky. Maybe taking the natural logarithm on both sides.

But perhaps an easier way is to use the approximation method. Let me try plugging in some interest rates and see which one gets me close to the present value of $7,650.

The options given are in percentages, so the monthly rate would be that divided by 100 and then by 12. But wait, the options are annual rates. So, for example, if the answer is 12.7%, then the monthly rate would be approximately 0.0127 /12 ≈ 0.0010583.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the options are the annual rates. So when using the present value formula, the rate r is the periodic rate, which would be annual rate divided by 12.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of annual rates. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the effective annual rate.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the interest rate in an installment loan. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for calculating the interest rate on a loan, which is similar to the internal rate of return.

Another approach is to use the TVM (time value of money) formula. Let me think about it as a present value of an ordinary annuity.

So,

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

We have PV = $7,650, PMT = $425, n=20.

So,

7,650 = 425 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-20 ) / r ]

Divide both sides by 425:

18 = (1 - (1 + r)^-20 ) / r

So,

1 - (1 + r)^-20 = 18r

Let me denote x = r. So,

1 - (1 + x)^-20 = 18x

I can try plugging in different values of x to see which satisfies this equation.

Let me try x = 0.01 (1% per month):

1 - (1.01)^-20 ≈ 1 - 1/1.22019 ≈ 1 - 0.81954 ≈ 0.18046

18x = 18 * 0.01 = 0.18

So 0.18046 ≈ 0.18. That's very close. Wait, so x ≈ 0.01, meaning 1% per month. But wait, that would make the annual rate 12% (since 0.01 * 12 = 0.12 or 12%). But looking at the options, 12.7% is an option (option A). Hmm, wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake because in reality, the exact rate might be a bit higher.

Wait, let me check with x=0.01. So,

(1.01)^20 is approximately e^(20*0.01) ≈ e^0.2 ≈ 1.22140. So 1/(1.01)^20 ≈ 0.82270.

So 1 - 0.82270 = 0.1773. 0.1773 / x (0.01) is 17.73. But wait, earlier I thought 18, but wait, in the equation, 18 = (1 - (1 + x)^-20 ) / x.

Wait, when x=0.01, (1 - (1.01)^-20 ) / 0.01 → (0.1773)/0.01 = 17.73. But we need this to equal 18. So 17.73 is a bit less than 18, meaning the actual x is a bit higher than 0.01.

So let's try x=0.0105 (1.05% per month). Let's compute (1.0105)^20.

Let me compute (1.0105)^20:

I can approximate this using the formula for compound interest, but maybe it's easier to use logarithms.

ln(1.0105) ≈ 0.01044. Multiply by 20: 0.2088.

So e^0.2088 ≈ 1.232. So (1.0105)^20 ≈ 1.232. So 1/(1.0105)^20 ≈ 0.8077.

1 - 0.8077 = 0.1923.

Then, 0.1923 / 0.0105 ≈ 18.314. That's higher than 18, so at x=0.0105, the value is 18.314. We need to find x where (1 - (1 + x)^-20 ) / x = 18.

So when x=0.01, it's 17.73; when x=0.0105, it's 18.314. So the correct x is between 0.01 and 0.0105.

Let me do a linear approximation. Let me set up two points:

At x1=0.01, f(x1)=17.73.

At x2=0.0105, f(x2)=18.314.

We need to find x where f(x) =18.

The difference between x2 and x1 is 0.0005. The difference in f(x) is 18.314 -17.73= 0.584.

We need to cover 18 -17.73=0.27 from x1.

So fraction = 0.27 / 0.584 ≈ 0.462.

So x ≈ x1 + 0.462*(x2 -x1) → 0.01 + 0.462*(0.0005) → 0.01 + 0.000231 = 0.010231, or 1.0231% per month.

Wait, but that would be an annual rate of 12.31%. But the answer options don't have 12.3, but have 12.7% (A) and 13.5% (I), which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a better method, like the Newton-Raphson method, to find a more accurate x.

The function we're solving is:

f(x) = (1 - (1 + x)^-20 ) / x - 18 = 0.

We can compute the derivative f’(x) to apply Newton-Raphson.

f(x) = [1 - (1/(1+x)^20)] / x - 18.

Let me compute f(x) and f’(x) at x=0.01.

f(0.01) = (1 - 1/(1.01)^20 ) / 0.01 -18 ≈ (1 - 0.8227)/0.01 -18 ≈ 0.1773 /0.01 -18 =17.73 -18 = -0.27.

f'(x) is the derivative of [1 - (1+x)^-20 ]/x - 18. Since the derivative of a constant is zero, we can focus on the first part.

Let me denote g(x) = [1 - (1+x)^-20 ]/x.

Then, g'(x) = [ (0 + 20*(1+x)^-21 ) * x - (1 - (1+x)^-20 )*1 ] / x^2.

Simplify numerator:

20*(1+x)^-21 *x - (1 - (1+x)^-20 )

= 20x/(1+x)^21 - 1 + 1/(1+x)^20.

Let me compute this at x=0.01.

Compute each term:

20 * 0.01 / (1.01)^21 = 0.2 / (approx 1.01^20 *1.01) → we know 1.01^20≈1.22019, so 1.01^21≈1.232. So 0.2 /1.232 ≈0.1623.

Then, minus 1: 0.1623 -1 = -0.8377.

Plus 1/(1.01)^20 → approx 0.8227.

So total numerator: -0.8377 +0.8227= -0.015.

So g'(0.01) ≈ (-0.015) / (0.01)^2 → (-0.015)/(0.0001) = -150.

Wait, but that seems high. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the derivative.

Wait, let's compute g'(x) again. The derivative of [1 - (1+x)^-20]/x is:

Using quotient rule: [d/dx (numerator) * denominator - numerator * d/dx (denominator)] / (denominator^2)

Numerator: 1 - (1+x)^-20

Denominator: x

So, d/dx numerator: 20*(1+x)^-21

d/dx denominator: 1

Thus,

g'(x) = [20*(1+x)^-21 * x - (1 - (1+x)^-20 ) * 1 ] / x^2

So at x=0.01,

20*(1.01)^-21 *0.01 - (1 - (1.01)^-20 )

Compute each term:

First term: 20 * 0.01 * (1.01)^-21 ≈ 0.2 * (approx 0.8077) → 0.2*0.8077≈0.1615.

Second term: 1 - 0.8227=0.1773.

So numerator: 0.1615 - 0.1773= -0.0158.

Denominator: x^2 = 0.0001.

So g'(0.01)= (-0.0158)/(0.0001)= -158.

So f'(0.01) = -158.

Now, Newton-Raphson formula:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)

We have x1=0.01, f(x1)= -0.27, f'(x1)= -158.

So,

x2 = 0.01 - (-0.27)/(-158) → 0.01 - (0.27/158) ≈ 0.01 - 0.00171 ≈ 0.00829.

Wait, that can't be right, because when x decreases, the function value would be lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative computation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerator again for x=0.01.

20*(1.01)^-21 * 0.01 = 20 * 0.01 * (1.01)^-21.

Compute (1.01)^21: as before, approx 1.01^20=1.22019, so 1.22019*1.01≈1.232.

So (1.01)^-21=1/1.232≈0.8116.

So 20 * 0.01 * 0.8116= 0.2 *0.8116≈0.1623.

Then, subtract (1 - (1.01)^-20 )=1 - 0.8227=0.1773.

So 0.1623 - 0.1773= -0.015.

So numerator is -0.015, denominator x²=0.0001.

So g'(x)= -0.015 / 0.0001 = -150.

So f'(x1)=g'(x1)= -150.

So using Newton-Raphson:

x2 = x1 - f(x1)/f'(x1) → 0.01 - (-0.27)/(-150) → 0.01 - (0.27/150) → 0.01 - 0.0018=0.0082.

Wait, that's a problem because when I tried x=0.01, the function value was f(x)= -0.27, but when I plug in a lower x, like 0.008, let's see what happens.

At x=0.008, compute f(x):

(1 - (1.008)^-20 ) /0.008.

Compute (1.008)^20. Let me approximate:

ln(1.008)=approx 0.007968. Multiply by 20: 0.15936.

e^0.15936≈1.173. So (1.008)^20≈1.173. So (1.008)^-20≈0.852.

So 1 - 0.852=0.148.

0.148 /0.008=18.5.

So f(x)=18.5 -18=0.5.

So at x=0.008, f(x)=0.5.

Wait, earlier at x=0.01, f(x)=-0.27. So the root is between 0.008 and 0.01. Wait, but that can't be right because earlier when x=0.0105, f(x)=18.314, which is way higher than 18. Wait, perhaps I messed up the function.

Wait, no. Wait, f(x) is [ (1 - (1+x)^-20 )/x ] -18.

Wait, at x=0.008, [ (1 - (1.008)^-20 ) ] /0.008 = (1 - 0.852)/0.008 = 0.148/0.008 = 18.5. So 18.5 -18=0.5 → f(x)=0.5.

At x=0.01, f(x)=17.73 -18= -0.27.

So the function crosses zero between x=0.008 and x=0.01.

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=0.0105, I got f(x)=18.314, which would be 18.314 -18=0.314. Wait, that's inconsistent. Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier in the x=0.0105 calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate at x=0.0105:

(1.0105)^20. Let's compute:

ln(1.0105)=approx 0.01044. Multiply by 20: 0.2088. e^0.2088≈1.232.

So (1.0105)^20≈1.232, so (1.0105)^-20≈0.8077.

So 1 - 0.8077=0.1923.

0.1923 /0.0105≈18.314.

So f(x) at x=0.0105 is 18.314 -18=0.314.

So at x=0.008, f(x)=0.5; at x=0.01, f(x)=-0.27; at x=0.0105, f(x)=0.314.

Wait, that can't be because when x increases, the function value [ (1 - (1+x)^-20 )/x ] decreases. Because as x increases, (1+x)^-20 decreases, so 1 - that term increases, but divided by a larger x. So the overall trend is that as x increases, the value decreases.

Wait, let me check the values again.

At x=0.008:

(1.008)^20≈1.173 → 1/1.173≈0.852.

So 1 - 0.852=0.148.

0.148 /0.008=18.5.

So f(x)=18.5-18=0.5.

At x=0.01:

(1.01)^20≈1.22019 → 1/1.22019≈0.81954.

1 - 0.81954=0.1773.

0.1773/0.01=17.73.

f(x)=17.73-18=-0.27.

At x=0.0105:

As before, f(x)≈18.314-18=0.314.

Wait, but that's higher than at 0.008, which contradicts
