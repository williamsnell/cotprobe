Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about March's key streams in decision making. Let me think. So, the question is asking which option does NOT form part of March's streams. I remember March (1988) talked about several streams that come together in decision-making processes, especially in ambiguous environments.

From what I recall, March identified four main streams: Problems, Solutions, Choices, and Outcomes. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, I think the streams are Problems, Solutions, and Choices. Or was it more than that? Let me try to reconstruct.

March's model, as I remember, includes the idea that decisions result from the confluence of four streams: Problems, Solutions, Choices, and maybe another one. Or perhaps it's more about the interactions between these elements over time. Wait, no, another angle: I think the four streams are actually labeled differently. Maybe it's Problems, Solutions, Choices, and Outcomes. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms.

Wait, March's garbage can model? No, that's a different model where decisions happen when problems, solutions, choices, and participants come together. But this question isn't about the garbage can model, it's about March 1988's key streams in ambiguous environments. So perhaps it's a similar concept but structured differently.

Alternatively, I think March (1988) discussed how in ambiguous situations, decision making involves the interplay of several streams. These might include things like the flow of problems, the flow of solutions, the flow of choices, and perhaps expectations or other factors.

Wait, let's list the options again. The options are A to J, and the choices include Innovations, Goals, Outcomes, Choice opportunities, Problems, Expectations, Uncertainties, Solutions, Risks, Constraints.

I think March's streams include Problems, Solutions, Choices, and maybe Outcomes. So looking at the options, let's check which ones are in the streams.

Problems (E) is definitely one. Solutions (H) is another. Choices or Choice opportunities (D) is another. Outcomes (C) might be part of it, or maybe it's a result rather than a stream. Wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Alternatively, March might have identified streams such as Problems, Solutions, and Choices, and maybe another one like Participants or something else. Or perhaps it's the idea that these streams are: Problems, Solutions, and Choice opportunities. So that would be E, H, and D. Then, what's the fourth? Or maybe it's three streams.

Wait, maybe the four streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and Outcomes. So that would be E, H, D, and C. So the question is asking which option does NOT form part of these. So the correct answer would be the one that's not among these.

Looking at the options, the ones that are in would be E (Problems), H (Solutions), D (Choice opportunities), and C (Outcomes). So the other options are A (Innovations), B (Goals), F (Expectations), G (Uncertainties), I (Risks), J (Constraints). Which of these is not part of March's streams.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Could March have included Goals as a separate stream? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the key streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and maybe something else like Outcomes. So from the options, the ones that are included are E, H, D, C. So the ones not included would be the others. The question is, which option is not part of them. So the correct answer would be the one that's not in the four.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if Outcomes is considered a stream or a result. Maybe March's streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and something like Expectations. Alternatively, perhaps the four streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and another factor.

Alternatively, maybe the streams are Problems, Solutions, Choices, and maybe Participants. But Participants isn't an option here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. March's work in 1988, I think, focused on the streams as Problems, Solutions, and Choice opportunities. So three streams. So in that case, which of the options are not part of these.

Looking again, the options are:

A: Innovations
B: Goals
C: Outcomes
D: Choice opportunities
E: Problems
F: Expectations
G: Uncertainties
H: Solutions
I: Risks
J: Constraints

So, if the streams are Problems (E), Solutions (H), and Choice opportunities (D), then the other options (A, B, C, F, G, I, J) are not part of the streams. But the question is, which one does not form part of the key streams. So the correct answer would be one of these.

Wait, but the question says which does NOT form part of the key streams, so the correct answer is the one that's not in the streams.

So, looking at the options, the streams are E, H, D. So any option outside these three would be the correct answer.

But wait, perhaps the streams include more than three. Let me think again. March's model might have more streams. Alternatively, perhaps the streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and Outcomes. So that would include E, H, D, and C. So the question is, which of the options is not part of these four.

So the options not in the streams would be A, B, F, G, I, J.

Now, looking at the options, the question is which does not form part of the key streams. So the correct answer would be one of those.

But I'm a bit confused because I'm not 100% sure about which streams March exactly identified. Maybe I should recall: March's work on decision-making processes in ambiguous environments, as per 1988. He talked about the idea that decisions result from the intersection of four streams: problems, solutions, choices, and perhaps another. Wait, I think the four streams are:

1. Problems: The flow of problems that require attention.
2. Solutions: The flow of solutions looking for problems.
3. Choices: The points where decisions are made.
4. Participants: The people involved in the decision process.

Wait, but Participants isn't an option here. So perhaps the four streams are Problems, Solutions, Choices, and Outcomes. Or maybe it's three streams plus another factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and Outcomes, making four. So the ones included are E, H, D, and C.

So the question is, which of the options is not part of these streams. The options are A-J, so the correct answer would be one of the other options.

Looking at the options, the ones not included in the streams would be A (Innovations), B (Goals), F (Expectations), G (Uncertainties), I (Risks), J (Constraints).

Wait, but perhaps March's model includes Goals as part of the streams. Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the key streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and Expectations. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 'Innovations' because that's not one of the streams. Or maybe 'Goals' is not part of it. Alternatively, perhaps 'Outcomes' is not a stream but a result.

Wait, another approach: The question asks which does NOT form part of the key streams. So which of the options isn't one of March's streams.

If March's streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and Outcomes, then the streams would be E, H, D, C. So the ones not in the streams would be A, B, F, G, I, J.

Looking at the options, the question is which one is not part. So the correct answer would be one of these. But the question is which one is not included.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 'Innovations' as it's not part of the streams. Alternatively, perhaps 'Goals' are included as part of the problem stream, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the key streams are Problems, Solutions, Choice opportunities, and Outcomes. So the ones not included would be Innovations, Goals, Expectations, Uncertainties, Risks, Constraints.

The question asks which does not form part of the streams. So the correct answer is the one that's not in the list.

Wait, but the options are A to J. The question is, which is not part of the streams. So the answer would be the one that's not E, H, D, or C.

So from the options, the ones that are not are A, B, F, G, I, J.

Now, the question is, which of the options is not a stream. So the correct answer is the one that's not part of March's streams.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 'Innovations' (A), because that's not a stream. Or perhaps 'Goals' (B), or 'Expectations' (F).

Alternatively, perhaps 'Outcomes' is considered a stream, so C is part of it, and the others are not.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. I think the correct answer is 'Innovations' because March's streams are more about problems, solutions, choices, etc., not about innovations. Alternatively, maybe 'Expectations' is part of the streams, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps 'Outcomes' is not a stream but a result of the streams. So if the streams are Problems, Solutions, and Choice opportunities, then the answer would be C: Outcomes. Because outcomes are the result, not a stream.

Wait, that makes sense. So the streams are the flows that lead to decisions, and outcomes are what happen after. So perhaps in March's model, the streams are Problems, Solutions, and Choice opportunities. So the correct answer would be C: Outcomes, as it's not a stream but an outcome.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps March considered Outcomes as a stream, but I don't think so. I think outcomes are the results of the streams converging.

So, if the streams are Problems, Solutions, and Choice opportunities, then the options that are not part would include C: Outcomes. So the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, if the streams are four, including Outcomes, then the answer would be something else.

I'm a bit torn here, but I think the key streams are Problems, Solutions, and Choice opportunities. So the answer would be C: Outcomes, as it's not a stream but a result.
</think>

March (1988) identified key streams in decision making in highly ambiguous environments, which are typically understood to include Problems, Solutions, and Choice opportunities. These streams represent the flows of issues, potential resolutions, and decision points that interact to shape decisions. Outcomes, on the other hand, are the results of these streams converging, rather than being a stream themselves. Therefore, Outcomes (C) does not form part of the key streams identified by March.

Answer: C
