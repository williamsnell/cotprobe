Okay, so I have this problem about finding the volume of a swimming pool. The pool is circular with a 40-foot diameter. Hmm, so the radius would be half of that, which is 20 feet. I remember that the volume of a circular pool would involve the area of the circle and then integrating the depth over that area somehow.

Wait, the depth isn't constant. It says the depth is constant along east-west lines and increases linearly from 2 ft at the south end to 7 ft at the north end. Oh, right, so it's varying along the north-south direction. So imagine looking down at the pool from above, it's a circle, and as you move from south to north, the depth increases.

I think I should model this in a coordinate system. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the pool is at (0,0). Then, the south end would be at the bottom, which would be (0, -20) in y if the radius is 20. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the diameter is 40, so radius is 20. If the pool's circle is centered at (0,0), then the south end would be at (0, -20), and the north end at (0, 20). Or maybe I should flip that, because in some coordinate systems, the positive y is upwards. Hmm, but for the depth, maybe it's better to have the south end at y = -20 and the north at y = 20.

Wait, but the depth increases from south to north. So at the south end (y = -20), the depth is 2 ft. At the north end (y = 20), it's 7 ft. So the depth as a function of y would be linear. Let's see, the depth function d(y) can be expressed as d(y) = m*y + b. We need to find m and b.

At y = -20, d = 2. At y = 20, d =7. So plugging in:

2 = m*(-20) + b
7 = m*(20) + b

Subtracting the first equation from the second: 5 = 40m → m = 5/40 = 1/8.

Then, substitute m into the first equation: 2 = (-20)(1/8) + b → 2 = -2.5 + b → b = 4.5.

So the depth function is d(y) = (1/8)y + 4.5.

Now, to find the volume, I think I need to integrate this depth over the area of the circle. Since the depth varies only in the y-direction and is constant along east-west (which I'm taking as the x-direction), I can model this with a double integral in polar coordinates or maybe stick with Cartesian.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use slices. Because the depth varies with y, perhaps I can use thin horizontal slices (infinitesimal thickness dy) and each slice has an area of the circumference at that y multiplied by the depth. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of cylindrical shells? No, perhaps using the method where each horizontal strip at position y has a depth d(y), and its width is the length across the circle at that y.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the pool as a solid of revolution. If I revolve the depth around the central axis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for each y, the depth is d(y), and the width at that y (the x-dimension) is 2x, where x is sqrt(20² - y²). So the volume could be the integral from y = -20 to y =20 of d(y) * 2x dy. Because at each y, the width is 2x, and depth is d(y), so the volume element is d(y)*2x*dy.

So let's write that:

Volume = ∫ [from y=-20 to 20] d(y) * 2x dy.

But x is sqrt(400 - y²), because the equation of the circle is x² + y² = 20² → x = sqrt(400 - y²).

So substituting, Volume = ∫ [from -20 to 20] [(1/8)y + 4.5] * 2 * sqrt(400 - y²) dy.

Hmm, that integral looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify it.

First, factor out the constants:

2 * ∫ [from -20 to 20] [(1/8 y) + 4.5 ] * sqrt(400 - y²) dy.

I can split this into two integrals:

2 * [ (1/8) ∫ y * sqrt(400 - y²) dy + 4.5 ∫ sqrt(400 - y²) dy ] evaluated from -20 to 20.

Let's evaluate each integral separately.

First, the integral of y*sqrt(400 - y²) dy from -20 to 20.

Let me make a substitution u = 400 - y² → du/dy = -2y → y dy = -du/2.

When y = -20, u = 400 - (400) = 0. When y =20, u = 0 also. So the limits when y goes from -20 to 20, u goes from 0 to 0. Hmm, but the function is odd. Let's think:

The function y * sqrt(400 - y²) is an odd function because y is multiplied by an even function (sqrt(400 - y²) is even). So the integral from -a to a of an odd function is zero.

So the first integral is zero.

So the volume simplifies to 2 * [ 0 + 4.5 ∫ sqrt(400 - y²) dy from -20 to 20 ].

Now, the integral of sqrt(400 - y²) dy from -20 to 20 is the area of a semicircle with radius 20. Because sqrt(r² - y²) from -r to r is the area of a semicircle (since integrating it gives (1/2)π r²). Wait, no. Wait, the integral from -r to r of sqrt(r² - y²) dy is (1/2) π r², which is the area of a semicircle. Because when you plot sqrt(r² - y²), it's the upper half of the circle, and the integral from -r to r is the area under the curve, which is a semicircle.

Wait, but wait. The integral of sqrt(r² - y²) dy from -r to r is (1/2) π r². Because the full circle area is π r², and the integral gives half of that.

So in our case, r is 20. So the integral is (1/2) π (20)^2 = 200 π.

Therefore, 4.5 times that integral is 4.5 * 200 π = 900 π.

Now, multiply by 2 (from the initial factor):

Volume = 2 * 900 π = 1800 π cubic feet.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recheck:

The integral ∫ [from -20 to 20] sqrt(400 - y²) dy is the area of a semicircle with radius 20. So (1/2) π (20)^2 = 200 π.

Yes. So 4.5 * 200 π = 900 π.

Multiply by 2: 900 π * 2 = 1800 π.

Looking at the options, option A is 1800π ft³. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these setups, the depth could be modeled differently. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should model it as a cylinder with varying depth, but the approach I took seems correct. Because each horizontal strip at depth y has a width of 2x, depth d(y), so the volume element is 2x * d(y) * dy. Then integrating that from y=-20 to 20.

Yes, and since the first integral (with y term) was zero, we only have the second term. So 2 * 4.5 * (area of semicircle) = 9 * 200 π = 1800 π.

So I think A is correct.

To find the volume of the swimming pool, we start by noting that the pool is circular with a diameter of 40 ft, giving it a radius of 20 ft. The depth varies linearly from 2 ft at the south end to 7 ft at the north end. We model the pool in a coordinate system where the center is at (0,0), the south end is at \( y = -20 \), and the north end is at \( y = 20 \). The depth as a function of \( y \) is linear and given by:

\[
d(y) = \frac{1}{8}y + 4.5
\]

To calculate the volume, we integrate the depth \( d(y) \) over the circular area. At each \( y \), the width of the pool is \( 2x \), where \( x = \sqrt{400 - y^2} \) from the equation of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 20^2 \). The volume is expressed as:

\[
\text{Volume} = \int_{-20}^{20} d(y) \cdot 2x \, dy
\]

Substituting \( d(y) \) and \( x \), the integral becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = \int_{-20}^{20} \left( \frac{1}{8}y + 4.5 \right) \cdot 2\sqrt{400 - y^2} \, dy
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
\text{Volume} = 2 \left[ \frac{1}{8} \int_{-20}^{20} y \cdot \sqrt{400 - y^2} \, dy + 4.5 \int_{-20}^{20} \sqrt{400 - y^2} \, dy \right]
\]

1. **First Integral**: \( \int_{-20}^{20} y \cdot \sqrt{400 - y^2} \, dy \)  
   This is the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval \([-20, 20]\), so it evaluates to zero.

2. **Second Integral**: \( \int_{-20}^{20} \sqrt{400 - y^2} \, dy \)  
   This represents the area of a semicircle with radius 20. The area of a full circle is \( \pi r^2 \), so the area of a semicircle is:

\[
\int_{-20}^{20} \sqrt{400 - y^2} \, dy = \frac{1}{2} \pi (20)^2 = 200\pi
\]

Substituting these results back:

\[
\text{Volume} = 2 \left[ 0 + 4.5 \cdot 200\pi \right] = 2 \cdot 900\pi = 1800\pi \, \text{ft}^3
\]

Thus, the volume of the pool is \( 1800\pi \, \text{ft}^3 \), corresponding to option **A**.
