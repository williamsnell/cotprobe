Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about affective commitment in organizations. Hmm, I remember that affective commitment is one of the three components of organizational commitment, along with normative and continuance commitment. Affective commitment refers to how emotionally attached an employee is to the organization. They identify with the company's goals and values and feel a sense of belonging. 

The question is asking which of the following is least likely to be predicted by the level of affective commitment. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is the least related.

Let me go through each option one by one.

A: Productivity. I think higher affective commitment would mean employees are more engaged and willing to put in extra effort, so productivity should be positively correlated. So affective commitment would predict productivity.

B: Individual creativity. If someone is emotionally committed, they might be more motivated to contribute ideas and be creative. So affective commitment likely predicts higher creativity.

C: Job satisfaction. Definitely related. If you feel committed emotionally, you're more satisfied with your job. So yes, affective commitment predicts job satisfaction.

D: Company loyalty. This seems like a direct measure. Affective commitment is about loyalty and staying with the company because you want to, not just because you have to. So this is a strong predictor.

E: Work-life balance. Hmm, work-life balance is about how employees manage their personal and professional life. I'm not sure how directly affective commitment affects this. Maybe high commitment could lead to overwork, but does it predict work-life balance? Or is work-life balance more about individual choices or organizational policies? I'm not too sure, but maybe affective commitment isn't a strong predictor here.

F: Job motivation. Motivation is closely tied to emotional commitment. If you're committed, you're more motivated to perform well. So this is predictable.

G: Workplace morale. Morale is about the overall mood and attitude in the workplace. If employees are committed, morale is likely higher. So affective commitment predicts this.

H: Turnover. High affective commitment means employees are less likely to leave, so it's a strong predictor of lower turnover.

I: Leadership style. Leadership style is more about how leaders behave and manage. While a committed workforce might influence leadership, I'm not sure affective commitment directly predicts the style. Or maybe it's the other way aroundâ€”leadership affects commitment. So perhaps affective commitment doesn't predict leadership style much.

J: Team cohesion. If team members are committed, they might work better together, leading to higher cohesion. So affective commitment predicts this.

So the options that are least likely to be predicted are E, I, or maybe something else. Let me think again.

Work-life balance (E) is about how employees balance their work and personal life. Affective commitment might make someone more dedicated, possibly leading to longer hours, which could affect work-life balance. But does affective commitment predict the balance itself? Or is work-life balance influenced by other factors like company policies, personal choices, or job demands? Maybe affective commitment isn't a strong predictor here. Alternatively, it could be that high commitment leads to poor work-life balance, but the question is about how predictive affective commitment is of work-life balance.

Leadership style (I) is more about the leader's behavior. While committed employees might respond better to certain styles, the style itself isn't predicted by their commitment. So perhaps affective commitment doesn't predict leadership style.

Wait, the question is about what affective commitment is least likely to predict. So which of these options is least related.

Productivity, job satisfaction, company loyalty, job motivation, morale, turnover, creativity, and team cohesion all seem closely tied to affective commitment. Leadership style might not be directly predicted by affective commitment because it's more about the leader's approach. Work-life balance could be influenced, but perhaps not as strongly predicted by affective commitment as the others.

Alternatively, maybe leadership style is influenced by the leader's own commitment, but the question is about the employees' affective commitment predicting leadership style, which doesn't make much sense. So perhaps I is the least predicted.

Wait, but the question is about the level of affective commitment predicting which outcome. So for example, affective commitment among employees predicts their job satisfaction, but does it predict the leadership style of their leaders? Probably not directly. Leadership style is more about the leader's personality, training, etc.

Alternatively, work-life balance might be less directly tied because it's more about personal choices or organizational policies than emotional commitment to the company.

So between E and I. Which is less predictable?

I think leadership style is something that's not directly predicted by the employees' affective commitment. So the least predictive would be I: leadership style.

Wait, the question is: which is least predictive. So which outcome is least likely to be predicted by affective commitment.

So, the correct answer would be the option where affective commitment doesn't have much influence.

So perhaps the answer is E: work-life balance, or I: leadership style.

Another angle: affective commitment is about the employee's attachment to the organization. Work-life balance is more about how they manage their time, which may not be directly tied to their emotional commitment. So perhaps E is the least predicted.

Alternatively, I might be wrong. Maybe the answer is E.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think of it another way.

Affective commitment is known to correlate with outcomes like job satisfaction, loyalty, retention (lower turnover), motivation, etc. It's less likely to predict things outside of the employee's attitudes and behaviors related to their job and the organization.

Work-life balance is more about how employees manage their personal and work responsibilities. While an employee with high affective commitment might work longer hours, affecting their work-life balance, it's not necessarily a direct prediction. It's possible, but perhaps not as strong as other factors.

Leadership style is about how leaders lead, which is more influenced by the leader's own traits, training, and experiences rather than the employees' commitment levels. So affective commitment of employees doesn't predict the leadership style of their leaders.

So perhaps the least predictive is I: leadership style.

Wait, but the question is about which outcome is least likely to be predicted by affective commitment. So the options are possible outcomes. So, for example, if affective commitment is high, does it predict leadership style? Probably not, because leadership style is determined by the leader, not the followers' commitment.

So the correct answer would be I: leadership style.

Affective commitment refers to the emotional attachment employees feel towards their organization, influencing their attitudes and behaviors. The question asks which outcome is least likely to be predicted by affective commitment. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Productivity**: High affective commitment is likely to predict higher productivity, as emotionally committed employees are more engaged.
- **B: Individual creativity**: Affective commitment can predict creativity, as committed employees are more motivated to contribute ideas.
- **C: Job satisfaction**: Affective commitment is strongly correlated with job satisfaction, as emotional attachment to the organization enhances satisfaction.
- **D: Company loyalty**: Affective commitment directly predicts loyalty, as it reflects a desire to stay with the organization.
- **E: Work-life balance**: While affective commitment might influence work habits, work-life balance is more dependent on personal choices and organizational policies, making it less directly predictable.
- **F: Job motivation**: Affective commitment predicts job motivation, as emotional attachment drives employees to perform better.
- **G: Workplace morale**: Affective commitment predicts higher morale, as committed employees contribute to a positive work environment.
- **H: Turnover**: High affective commitment predicts lower turnover, as emotionally attached employees are less likely to leave.
- **I: Leadership style**: Leadership style is determined by the leader's traits, training, and experiences, not by employees' affective commitment, making it the least predictable.
- **J: Team cohesion**: Affective commitment predicts team cohesion, as committed employees are more likely to collaborate effectively.

Between options E (work-life balance) and I (leadership style), leadership style is the least likely to be predicted by affective commitment, as it is determined by the leader rather than the employees' emotional attachment to the organization.

**Answer: I**
