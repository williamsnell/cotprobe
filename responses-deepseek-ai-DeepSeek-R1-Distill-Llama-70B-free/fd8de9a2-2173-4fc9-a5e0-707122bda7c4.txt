Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm. So, the question is about a proton moving through electric and magnetic fields. Alright, I remember that when charged particles move through electric and magnetic fields, they experience forces. The main idea here is probably the Lorentz force.

So the setup: a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference V in the +z direction. Then it enters a region with an electric field E in the +x and a magnetic field B in the +y. And the key point is that the proton's trajectory isn't affected. So no deflection. Interesting.

Wait, if the trajectory isn't affected, that means the net force on the proton is zero. Because if there were a net force, it would change the path. So the electric force and the magnetic force must be balancing each other out. Oh right, the Lorentz force is F = q(E + v × B). Since the proton is moving, its velocity is in the +z direction. So the velocity vector is along z.

Let me break this down. The electric field is E in +x, so the electric force would be F_electric = qE in the +x direction. The magnetic field is B in +y. The velocity is v in +z. So the cross product v × B would be in the direction of z × y. Wait, let's think about that. The cross product order matters because of the right-hand rule. So z cross y... Let me remember: x cross y is +z. So z cross y would be -(y cross z). Wait, y cross z is x? No, wait, y cross z is x? No, no. Let me think in terms of unit vectors. i, j, k correspond to x, y, z. So i × j = k (z). j × k = i (x). So k × j = -i (because it's the opposite of j × k). So v × B is (v, direction z) × (B, y) → which is vB in the negative x direction? Wait, or positive x?

Wait, no. Let me get this right. For the cross product, the direction of v is +z, B is +y. So v × B would be in the direction of z × y. Using the right-hand rule: point fingers along z (up), then curl towards y (left). The thumb would point in the negative x direction. So v × B points in -x. So the magnetic force would be F_magnetic = q(v × B) → in the -x direction.

So the electric force is +x, magnetic is -x. Since the trajectory isn't deflected, these forces must cancel each other. So F_electric + F_magnetic = 0.

So qE = qvB. Oh, because E is in +x and B contributes to -x force. So setting them equal: E = vB. So the velocity v must be such that v = E/(B).

But wait, where does the velocity come from? The proton was accelerated through a potential difference V. So the kinetic energy gained is equal to qV. The proton starts from rest, so (1/2)mv² = qV → v = sqrt(2qV/m).

So substituting v into E = vB: E = (sqrt(2qV/m)) * B. Hmm, that's the condition for no deflection.

Now, the question says that if the potential difference is doubled to 2V, what happens? So the new velocity would be v' = sqrt(2q(2V)/m) = sqrt(4qV/m) = 2 * sqrt(qV/m). Because sqrt(4) is 2. So v' is twice the original velocity.

But wait, the original velocity was v = E/(B). So the new velocity is 2E/(B).

So the forces would be F_electric = qE (same as before, since E is same) and F_magnetic = q(v' × B). Let's compute v' × B. v' is along +z, B is +y. So same direction as before. So v' × B is in -x direction. So F_mag = q*(v' B) in -x. But v' is 2v, so F_mag is q*(2v B) * (-x direction) → which is 2 q v B in -x.

But wait, from earlier, qvB = qE. So F_mag becomes 2 qE in the -x direction.

Now, the electric force is qE in +x. So the net force is F_net = qE - 2 qE = - qE. So net force is in the -x direction.

Therefore, the proton would experience a force in the -x direction, causing it to deflect in that direction.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another approach: when the potential is doubled, the velocity doubles. So the original condition was E = vB. Now, the new speed is 2v, so the magnetic force becomes q*(2v)B = 2 q v B. But since E = vB, this is 2 q E. So F_mag = 2 q E in -x, while F_electric is q E in +x. So net force is F_net = qE - 2 qE = - qE → direction -x.

So the proton will be deflected in the -x direction. Looking at the options, option C is deflected in the -x direction.

When a proton is accelerated through a potential difference \( V \) in the \( +z \)-direction, it gains a velocity \( v \) determined by the relation \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV \), giving \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} \). Upon entering a region with a uniform electric field \( E \) in the \( +x \)-direction and a uniform magnetic field \( B \) in the \( +y \)-direction, the proton experiences forces due to both fields. The electric force is \( F_{\text{electric}} = qE \) in the \( +x \)-direction, and the magnetic force is \( F_{\text{magnetic}} = q(v \times B) \) in the \( -x \)-direction (using the right-hand rule for \( v \times B \)).

Since the proton’s trajectory is not affected, the net force must be zero. This implies \( qE = qvB \), or \( E = vB \). Substituting \( v = \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} \), the condition becomes \( E = B \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} \).

If the potential difference is doubled to \( 2V \), the new velocity becomes \( v' = \sqrt{\frac{2q(2V)}{m}} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{2qV}{m}} \), which is twice the original velocity. The magnetic force then becomes \( F_{\text{magnetic}} = q(v'B) = 2qvB \), while the electric force remains \( F_{\text{electric}} = qE \). Using \( E = vB \), the magnetic force is \( 2qE \), and the net force is \( F_{\text{net}} = qE - 2qE = -qE \), directed in the \( -x \)-direction.

Thus, when the potential difference is doubled, the proton is deflected in the \( -x \)-direction.
