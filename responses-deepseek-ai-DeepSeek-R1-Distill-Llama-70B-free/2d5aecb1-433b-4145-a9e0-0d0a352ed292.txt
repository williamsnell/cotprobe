Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a grindstone's rotational speed decreasing over time. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The problem says the motor is switched off when the grindstone is rotating at 240 revolutions per minute (rev/min). After 10 seconds, the speed drops to 180 rev/min. They tell us that the angular retardation is constant and ask how many additional revolutions it makes before coming to rest. The options are from A to J.

Wait, angular retardation is the same as angular deceleration, right? So it's the rate at which the angular velocity decreases. Since it's constant, the angular velocity decreases linearly over time.

I'm trying to remember the equations. The basic kinematic equation for angular motion when the angular acceleration is constant is:

ω_final = ω_initial + α * t

But wait, α is the angular acceleration. Since it's deceleration, α would be negative here. So let me note that down.

But wait, the units are in rev/min, and time is given in seconds. I might need to convert units to make them consistent. Oh, right, because standard SI units use radians per second for angular velocity, but maybe I can work in rev/min and seconds if I'm careful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert the speeds to radians per second. Let me think.

First, let's get the angular deceleration (α) using the data given.

The initial angular velocity, ω_initial, is 240 rev/min. After 10 seconds, ω_final is 180 rev/min.

Wait, but when we're dealing with time in seconds, and angular velocity in rev/min, I think I should convert rev/min to rev/second or maybe rad/s. Because the time is in seconds, so the units should match.

Wait, 1 rev is 2π radians. So 240 rev/min is (240 * 2π) radians per minute. To convert to per second, divide by 60.

So ω_initial = 240 * 2π /60 = (240/60)*2π = 4 * 2π = 8π rad/s.

Similarly, ω_final after 10s is 180 rev/min. So that's 180 * 2π /60 = (180/60)*2π = 3 * 2π = 6π rad/s.

Wait, wait, but I'm not sure if I'm doing that correctly. Let me double-check. Because 1 rev = 2π rad, so rev/min to rad/s: multiply by 2π and divide by 60.

Yes, that's correct. So 240 rev/min is 240 * (2π) /60 = 4 * 2π = 8π rad/s.

Similarly, 180 rev/min is 180*(2π)/60=3*2π=6π rad/s.

So the initial angular velocity is 8π rad/s, and after 10 seconds, it's 6π rad/s.

Wait, but the angular deceleration α is the change in angular velocity over time. So α = (ω_final - ω_initial) / t.

So α = (6π - 8π) / 10 = (-2π)/10 = (-π/5) rad/s².

Wait, but the problem says "angular retardation remains constant," which is the same as deceleration, so positive value in the opposite direction. But for calculation purposes, the sign is handled in the equations.

Now, the question is how many additional revolutions does it make before coming to rest. So from the moment it's turned off until it stops. But wait, the data given is after 10 seconds, it's at 180 rev/min. So we first need to find out the time it takes from 180 rev/min until it stops, or perhaps calculate from the initial 240, but wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, let me clarify. The motor is switched off at 240 rev/min. So from that point, it starts to slow down. After 10 seconds, the speed is 180 rev/min. So the next step is to find out how much more time it takes to come to rest from 180 rev/min, or perhaps calculate the total time from 240 until rest, and then find the number of revolutions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of revolutions made during the 10 seconds, and then the additional revolutions after that until stopping.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is asking how many additional revolutions before coming to rest after the 10 seconds. So after those 10 seconds, when it's at 180 rev/min, how many more revs does it do.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to model the entire motion from the start (when it's turned off) until it stops.

So let's think of it in two parts: the first 10 seconds, where it goes from 240 to 180 rev/min, and then the time after that until it stops. But I think it's easier to model the entire process.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to model the angular displacement (θ) as a function of time. The equation is:

θ = ω_initial * t + 0.5 * α * t²

But wait, that's only if α is constant. But since we're dealing with angular deceleration, and when the grindstone comes to rest, the final angular velocity ω_final is zero.

So, perhaps the better approach is to find the total time taken from when the motor is switched off until it comes to rest. Then calculate the total number of revolutions in that time.

Wait, but the initial data gives us the speed after 10 seconds. So let's first calculate the angular deceleration α, which we've done as -π/5 rad/s².

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So initial ω_initial = 8π rad/s, after 10s, ω_final = 6π rad/s.

So α = (6π -8π)/(10) = (-2π)/10 = -π/5 rad/s². Yes, correct.

Now, to find the total time taken until it comes to rest, we can set ω_final = 0.

So using ω_final = ω_initial + α * t_total.

0 = 8π + (-π/5) * t_total.

Solving for t_total: 8π = (π/5) * t_total → t_total = (8π) * (5/π) ) = 40 seconds.

So the total time from switch-off until rest is 40 seconds.

But the question is about the additional revolutions after the first 10 seconds. So the total time is 40s, and the initial 10s have already passed, so the remaining time is 30s.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the total number of revolutions in 40s, then subtract the revolutions made in the first 10s to get the additional revolutions.

So, let's compute θ_total for 40s.

θ_total = ω_initial * t_total + 0.5 * α * t_total².

Plugging in the values:

θ_total = (8π) *40 + 0.5*(-π/5)*(40)^2.

Compute each term:

First term: 8π *40 = 320π rad.

Second term: 0.5 * (-π/5) * 1600 → 0.5 is 800, so 800 * (-π/5) = -160π rad.

So θ_total = 320π -160π = 160π rad.

Convert radians to revolutions: since 1 rev = 2π rad, the total revolutions are θ_total / (2π) = (160π)/(2π)=80 rev.

So in total, the grindstone makes 80 revolutions from switch-off until rest.

Now, compute the revolutions made in the first 10s.

θ_10s = ω_initial *10 + 0.5 * α *10².

θ_10s = 8π *10 + 0.5*(-π/5)*100.

Compute each term:

First term: 80π rad.

Second term: 0.5*(-π/5)*100 → 0.5 is 50, 50*(-π/5)= -10π rad.

So θ_10s = 80π -10π =70π rad.

Convert to revolutions:70π/(2π)=35 rev.

So in the first 10s, it makes 35 revolutions.

Total until rest is 80 rev, so the additional revolutions after 10s would be 80 -35=45 rev.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 45 rev. So the answer would be E.

Alternatively, let me think again, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, total time is 40s, yes, because 8π = (π/5) * t → t=40 s.

Total revolutions:θ_total/(2π) = [8π*40 + 0.5*(-π/5)*40²]/(2π) → [320π -0.5*(π/5)*1600 ]/(2π).

Wait, 0.5*(π/5)*1600= (π/5)*800=160π.

So θ_total=320π -160π=160π rad → 160π/(2π)=80 rev.

In the first 10s, θ_10s=8π *10 + 0.5*(-π/5)*100=80π -10π=70π →70π/(2π)=35 rev.

So additional revolutions after 10s:80-35=45 rev. So answer E.

But wait, another approach: using the average angular velocity during the 40 seconds. Since the deceleration is constant, the average angular velocity is (initial + final)/2 → (8π +0)/2=4π rad/s.

Total time is 40s, so θ_total=4π *40=160π rad →80 rev. Yep, same as before.

Alternatively, the average speed during the first 10s is (240 +180)/2=210 rev/min. So revolutions in first 10s:210 rev/min *10s =2100 rev·s/min → but wait, min is 60s, so 210 rev per min, over 10s (which is 1/6 of a minute) so 210*(10/60)=35 rev. Same as before.

Then, after 10s, the speed is 180 rev/min. It will continue slowing down. So perhaps I can compute the time it takes from 180 rev/min to 0, and then find the revolutions in that time.

Wait, maybe that's another way. So after 10s, the angular speed is 6π rad/s (180 rev/min). Let's find the time to stop from here.

Using ω_final=0=6π + α * t.

We have α=-π/5 rad/s².

So 0=6π - (π/5) t → (π/5) t=6π → t=6π *5/π=30s.

So from this point, it takes 30s to stop.

Now, the average angular velocity during this period is (6π +0)/2=3π rad/s.

So θ= average * time=3π *30=90π rad.

Convert to rev:90π/(2π)=45 rev.

Which matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 45 rev, option E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the grindstone under constant angular retardation. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Convert angular velocities to radians per second**:  
   - Initial angular velocity: \( \omega_{\text{initial}} = 240 \, \text{rev/min} = \frac{240 \cdot 2\pi}{60} = 8\pi \, \text{rad/s} \).  
   - Angular velocity after 10 seconds: \( \omega_{\text{final}} = 180 \, \text{rev/min} = \frac{180 \cdot 2\pi}{60} = 6\pi \, \text{rad/s} \).

2. **Calculate angular deceleration**:  
   Using the equation \( \omega_{\text{final}} = \omega_{\text{initial}} + \alpha t \), where \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   \alpha = \frac{\omega_{\text{final}} - \omega_{\text{initial}}}{t} = \frac{6\pi - 8\pi}{10} = -\frac{\pi}{5} \, \text{rad/s}^2.
   \]

3. **Determine total time to come to rest**:  
   Using \( \omega_{\text{final}} = \omega_{\text{initial}} + \alpha t_{\text{total}} \), where \( \omega_{\text{final}} = 0 \):  
   \[
   0 = 8\pi + \left(-\frac{\pi}{5}\right) t_{\text{total}} \implies t_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{s}.
   \]

4. **Calculate total revolutions before coming to rest**:  
   Using the equation for angular displacement:  
   \[
   \theta_{\text{total}} = \omega_{\text{initial}} t_{\text{total}} + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t_{\text{total}}^2.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \theta_{\text{total}} = (8\pi)(40) + \frac{1}{2} \left(-\frac{\pi}{5}\right)(40)^2 = 320\pi - 160\pi = 160\pi \, \text{rad}.
   \]  
   Converting to revolutions:  
   \[
   \theta_{\text{total}} = \frac{160\pi}{2\pi} = 80 \, \text{rev}.
   \]

5. **Calculate revolutions in the first 10 seconds**:  
   Using the same angular displacement equation:  
   \[
   \theta_{10} = \omega_{\text{initial}} t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   \theta_{10} = (8\pi)(10) + \frac{1}{2} \left(-\frac{\pi}{5}\right)(10)^2 = 80\pi - 10\pi = 70\pi \, \text{rad}.
   \]  
   Converting to revolutions:  
   \[
   \theta_{10} = \frac{70\pi}{2\pi} = 35 \, \text{rev}.
   \]

6. **Determine additional revolutions after 10 seconds**:  
   Subtract the revolutions made in the first 10 seconds from the total revolutions:  
   \[
   \text{Additional revolutions} = 80 - 35 = 45 \, \text{rev}.
   \]

Thus, the grindstone makes **45 additional revolutions** before coming to rest. The correct answer is:

**E: 45 rev**
