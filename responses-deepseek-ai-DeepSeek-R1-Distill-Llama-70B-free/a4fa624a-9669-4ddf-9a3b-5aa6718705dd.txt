Question:

Mosquitoes resistant to the pesticide DDT first appeared in India in 1959 within 15 years of widespread spraying of the insecticide. Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?

Options:

A: The mosquitoes reproduced at such a fast rate that they evolved to become resistant to DDT.
B: Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.
C: Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.
D: The mosquitoes developed a resistance because the DDT used was of a lesser concentration.
E: The mosquitoes developed a resistance to DDT over time due to constant exposure.
F: DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.
G: The resistant mosquitoes were imported from a different area where DDT was not used.
H: All the mosquitoes were initially resistant to DDT, but the resistant ones were better at surviving.
I: Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.
J: The mosquitoes were initially resistant to DDT, but due to a mutation, they lost their resistance.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mosquitoes becoming resistant to DDT. Hmm, I remember that DDT was widely used as a pesticide, but over time some insects became resistant to it. The question says that in India, mosquitoes resistant to DDT appeared just 15 years after spraying started. I need to figure out which explanation is correct.

The options are from A to J. Let me think about each one.

Option A says mosquitoes reproduced quickly and evolved resistance. Well, rapid reproduction can lead to faster evolution because more generations mean more chances for mutations. But does that explain the resistance arising? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the best option.

Option B claims DDT isn't effective against mosquitoes. But that doesn't make sense because the question states that DDT was used and resistance appeared later, implying it was effective at first.

Option C suggests some mosquitoes mutated after exposure and then their population expanded. Wait, mutations usually occur randomly, not as a response to exposure. So if some already had the mutation, they survived and bred, causing the population to have more resistant individuals. But this option says they mutated after exposure, which might not be right.

Option D says lower concentration DDT caused resistance. I think lower doses might select for resistance, but I'm not certain if that's the reason they developed it in the first place.

Option E states that resistance developed over time due to constant exposure. That sounds like natural selectionâ€”where the pesticide selects for existing resistant traits. But does it mean that exposure causes the mutation? Or that it selects those who already have it?

Option F says DDT is effective, so maybe it was a manufacturing issue. But the question is about the mosquitoes becoming resistant, not about the pesticide's failure.

Option G suggests resistant mosquitoes were imported. That's a possibility, but the question doesn't mention anything about migration or import, so I don't think this is the right explanation.

Option H claims all mosquitoes were resistant, but that can't be right because if they were all resistant from the start, spraying wouldn't have worked initially. Plus, the question says resistance appeared after spraying, so they weren't all resistant before.

Option I says some were already resistant when DDT was first used. When DDT was sprayed, the susceptible ones died, leaving the resistant to multiply. This makes sense because it's about natural selection. The resistant individuals were a small part of the population, but after spraying, they became dominant.

Option J says mosquitoes lost resistance due to mutation. That doesn't fit because the question is about gaining resistance, not losing.

Wait, so the main idea is that resistance was present before DDT was used. When DDT was sprayed, the non-resistant died, and the resistant ones survived and reproduced, increasing their population. So the resistant trait became more common.

Looking back at the options, Option I fits this explanation. It says some were already resistant, and after spraying, their population expanded because others were killed.

So the correct answer should be I.

The development of DDT resistance in mosquitoes in India can be explained by the process of natural selection. When DDT was first sprayed, it likely killed the majority of mosquitoes that were susceptible to the pesticide. However, some individuals within the mosquito population may have already possessed a genetic mutation that conferred resistance to DDT. These resistant mosquitoes survived and reproduced, passing on their resistant trait to their offspring. Over time, as the susceptible mosquitoes were eliminated, the proportion of resistant mosquitoes in the population increased. This explanation aligns with Option I, which states that some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when it was first sprayed, and their population expanded after the susceptible ones were exterminated.

Answer: I
