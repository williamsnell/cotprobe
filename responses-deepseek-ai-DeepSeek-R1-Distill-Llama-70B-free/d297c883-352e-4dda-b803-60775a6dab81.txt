Okay, so I've got this question about Tay-Sachs disease and the enzyme deficiency that causes it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think this through.

I remember that Tay-Sachs is a genetic disorder, and it's one of those lysosomal storage diseases. Those are diseases where the lysosome can't break down certain substances, so they accumulate and cause problems. The lysosome needs specific enzymes to break down these molecules, and if an enzyme is deficient, the cell can't process them properly.

Tay-Sachs is related to hexosaminidase, I think. Wait, there's hexosaminidase A and B. Oh right, because I remember that in Tay-Sachs, it's the A variant that's deficient. Hexosaminidase A is an enzyme that breaks down certain fatty substances, maybe gangliosides? Yeah, I think ganglioside GM2 is involved. Without hex A, GM2 builds up in the lysosomes, especially in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration.

So the question is asking which enzyme's deficiency causes Tay-Sachs. Let me look at the options. Option F is Hexosaminidase A. Option C is Hex B, which I think is a different disease. Oh wait, Sandhoff disease is when both Hex A and Hex B are deficient. So Tay-Sachs is specifically Hex A.

Other options: Alpha-L-iduronidase is for Hurler syndrome, I think. Arylsulfatase A is related to Metachromatic Leukodystrophy. Glucose-6-phosphatase is for Glycogen storage disease type I. Lysosomal alpha-glucosidase is Pompe disease. Galactosidase Alpha is Fabry disease, maybe? Wait, no, Fabry is alpha-Gal A, which is option J. Oh, so option I is Galactosidase Alpha, but I'm not sure which disease that is. Oh, maybe that's another condition. 

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option F: Hexosaminidase A.

Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down ganglioside GM2, and its absence leads to the accumulation of this substance in the brain, resulting in neurodegeneration. Among the options provided, hexosaminidase A is the correct enzyme associated with Tay-Sachs disease. Other enzymes listed are related to different lysosomal storage diseases, such as Hurler syndrome (alpha-L-iduronidase), Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (arylsulfatase A), and Fabry disease (alpha-Gal A). Sandhoff disease, on the other hand, involves a deficiency of both hexosaminidase A and B. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: F
