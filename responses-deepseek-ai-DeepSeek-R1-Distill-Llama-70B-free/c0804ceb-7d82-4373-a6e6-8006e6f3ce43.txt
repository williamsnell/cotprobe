Question:

Given 3 Colors whose RGB representations are given as follows: Color 1: (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), Color 2: (0.4, 0.6, 0.5), Color 3: (0.3, 0.7, 0.5), Which Color does not carry chrominance (Color) Information? Answer with 1 or 2 or 3.

Options:

A: None of the above
B: Both 1 and 2
C: Both 2 and 3
D: All of the above
E: 3
F: 1
G: Only 1 and 2 carry chrominance information
H: 2
I: Only 2 and 3 carry chrominance information
J: Both 1 and 3

Okay, so I've got this question about colors and whether they carry chrominance information. Hmm, I remember chrominance has to do with the color part of a video signal, like the hue and saturation, as opposed to luminance, which is the brightness part. Right, so in RGB color space, each color is a combination of red, green, and blue.

The question gives me three colors with their RGB values. Color 1 is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Color 2 is (0.4, 0.6, 0.5). Color 3 is (0.3, 0.7, 0.5). The question is asking which color doesn't carry chrominance information. I think that if a color has no chrominance, it means it's a shade of gray because gray doesn't have any color information; it's just varying levels of brightness.

So, looking at Color 1: all the RGB values are the same, 0.5 each. That should be a medium gray. So it doesn't carry any chrominance info. Color 2: the red is 0.4, green 0.6, blue 0.5. These aren't all the same, so it has some color. Similarly, Color 3 has red 0.3, green 0.7, blue 0.5. Definitely not the same across all channels, so it has color (chrominance) too.

Wait, but what exactly determines if a color has chrominance? I think in YCbCr color space, the Y component is luminance, and Cb and Cr are chrominance. When converting RGB to YCbCr, if the Cb and Cr are zero, then there's no chrominance. For that to happen, the RGB values would have to be the same, like in Color 1. Because when R=G=B, it's a gray, so no color info.

So only Color 1 doesn't carry chrominance. The others have varying R, G, B, so they have color. So the question is which color does NOT carry chrominance. So the answer is Color 1. Looking at the options, option F is 1. So the correct answer is F.

The question asks which of the given colors does not carry chrominance information. Chrominance refers to the color information in a signal, distinct from luminance (brightness). A color lacks chrominance if it is a shade of gray, meaning all its RGB values are identical.

- **Color 1**: (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) has identical RGB values, making it a shade of gray with no chrominance.
- **Color 2**: (0.4, 0.6, 0.5) has varying RGB values, indicating it carries chrominance.
- **Color 3**: (0.3, 0.7, 0.5) also has varying RGB values, meaning it carries chrominance.

Thus, only Color 1 lacks chrominance. Among the options, the correct answer is **F: 1**.
