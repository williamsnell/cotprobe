Okay, so I have this problem where I need to approximate y(3) using the two-step Adams-Bashforth method. The differential equation given is y' = -y², and the initial conditions are y(0) = 1 and y(1) = 2. The step size h is 1. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Adams-Bashforth methods are multi-step methods, meaning they use previous solution points to extrapolate the next value. Since it's a two-step method, I think I'll need the last two values to compute the next one. The formula given is y_{i+2} = y_{i+1} - (1/2) h f(t_i, y_i) + (3/2) h f(t_{i+1}, y_{i+1}).

Wait, let me make sure I parse that correctly. The formula is y at i+2 equals y at i+1 minus half h times f at (t_i, y_i) plus three-halves h times f at (t_{i+1}, y_{i+1}). So each step uses the function evaluations at the two previous steps.

But wait, I'm given y(0) and y(1). So if I'm starting from t=0, the first step is to get y(2), and then the next step would get y(3), which is what we need.

Let me note down the given values:

t0=0, y0=1

t1=1, y1=2

h=1, so each step increases t by 1.

The function f(t,y) is y' = -y², so f(t,y) = -y².

So, f(t0, y0) = -(1)^2 = -1.

f(t1, y1) = -(2)^2 = -4.

Now, the first step is to compute y2, which is y at t=2. Using the Adams-Bashforth formula for i=0 (since i+2 would be 2):

y2 = y1 - (1/2)*h*f(t0, y0) + (3/2)*h*f(t1, y1)

Plugging in the numbers:

y2 = 2 - (0.5)(1)(-1) + (1.5)(1)(-4)

Let me compute each term:

- (0.5)(1)(-1) = 0.5 *1*1 = 0.5

(1.5)(1)(-4) = 1.5 * (-4) = -6

So y2 = 2 + 0.5 -6 = 2.5 -6 = -3.5

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: y1 is 2.

Second term: (1/2)*h*f(t0,y0) → (0.5)(1)(-1) = -0.5. But wait, the formula has a minus in front of that term. So the second term is - (-0.5) = +0.5.

Third term: (3/2)*h*f(t1,y1) → (1.5)(1)(-4) = -6. So the third term is + (-6) → -6.

So y2 = 2 + 0.5 -6 = (2.5) -6 → -3.5.

Hmm. So y2 is -3.5. That's an interesting result. Wait, but the function is y' = -y², which is a negative feedback. Starting from y=1, it would decrease. But with y(1)=2, which is higher, perhaps the approximation goes negative. So maybe that's okay.

Now, moving on to compute y3 using the same method. Now, i=1, so i+2=3.

The formula becomes:

y3 = y2 - (1/2) h f(t1, y1) + (3/2) h f(t2, y2)

We have t2=2, and we have y2=-3.5.

Compute each term:

f(t1, y1) is still -4 (since y1=2).

f(t2, y2) = -(y2)^2 = -(-3.5)^2 = -12.25.

So plug into the formula:

y3 = y2 - (0.5)(1)(-4) + (1.5)(1)(-12.25)

Compute each part:

y2 is -3.5.

Second term: - (0.5)*(-4) → 0.5*4 = 2. So +2.

Third term: (1.5)*(-12.25) = -18.375. So that's adding -18.375.

So y3 = (-3.5) + 2 + (-18.375) = (-3.5 + 2) = -1.5; then -1.5 -18.375 = -19.875.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck each step.

First, compute each term:

y3 = y2 [which is -3.5]

Second term: -(1/2)*h*f(t1,y1) → -(0.5)(1)(-4) → 0.5 *4 = 2 → so +2.

Third term: (3/2)*h*f(t2,y2) → (1.5)(1)(-12.25) → 1.5*(-12.25) = -18.375 → so + (-18.375) is -18.375.

So adding them up:

-3.5 +2 = -1.5 → then -1.5 -18.375 = -19.875.

So the approximation for y(3) is -19.875.

Looking at the options, option I is -19.875, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me make sure I applied the correct step.

Wait, in the first step, when I calculated y2, I used i=0, so i+1=1, i+2=2.

In the second step, I'm using i=1, so i+1=2, i+2=3.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculations seem correct. So the answer should be option I: -19.875.

To approximate \( y(3) \) using the two-step Adams-Bashforth method, we start with the given initial conditions \( y(0) = 1 \) and \( y(1) = 2 \), and the differential equation \( y' = -y^2 \). The step size is \( h = 1 \), and the formula for the Adams-Bashforth method is:

\[
y_{i+2} = y_{i+1} - \frac{1}{2} h f(t_i, y_i) + \frac{3}{2} h f(t_{i+1}, y_{i+1}),
\]

where \( f(t, y) = -y^2 \).

### Step 1: Compute \( y_2 \) (at \( t = 2 \))
Using \( i = 0 \), \( t_0 = 0 \), \( y_0 = 1 \), \( t_1 = 1 \), \( y_1 = 2 \):
\[
f(t_0, y_0) = -(1)^2 = -1, \quad f(t_1, y_1) = -(2)^2 = -4.
\]
Substitute into the formula:
\[
y_2 = y_1 - \frac{1}{2} h f(t_0, y_0) + \frac{3}{2} h f(t_1, y_1),
\]
\[
y_2 = 2 - \frac{1}{2}(1)(-1) + \frac{3}{2}(1)(-4),
\]
\[
y_2 = 2 + 0.5 - 6 = -3.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( y_3 \) (at \( t = 3 \))
Using \( i = 1 \), \( t_1 = 1 \), \( y_1 = 2 \), \( t_2 = 2 \), \( y_2 = -3.5 \):
\[
f(t_1, y_1) = -(2)^2 = -4, \quad f(t_2, y_2) = -(-3.5)^2 = -12.25.
\]
Substitute into the formula:
\[
y_3 = y_2 - \frac{1}{2} h f(t_1, y_1) + \frac{3}{2} h f(t_2, y_2),
\]
\[
y_3 = -3.5 - \frac{1}{2}(1)(-4) + \frac{3}{2}(1)(-12.25),
\]
\[
y_3 = -3.5 + 2 - 18.375 = -19.875.
\]

### Final Answer
The approximation for \( y(3) \) is \( -19.875 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
