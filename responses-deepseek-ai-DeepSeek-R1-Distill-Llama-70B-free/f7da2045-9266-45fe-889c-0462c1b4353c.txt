Okay, I have this problem where I need to find the orthogonal projection of 9e₁ onto a subspace of R⁴. The subspace is spanned by two vectors: [2, 2, 1, 0] and [-2, 2, 0, 1]. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on projections, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

So first, I remember that the orthogonal projection of a vector onto a subspace can be found using the formula involving the dot product. But wait, since the subspace is spanned by two vectors, I think I need to use the projection formula for a subspace spanned by multiple vectors. Maybe I should construct a matrix with these vectors as columns and then use the projection formula.

Let me write down the vectors. Let’s call the first vector v₁ = [2, 2, 1, 0], and the second one v₂ = [-2, 2, 0, 1]. The vector we're projecting is b = 9e₁, which in R⁴ is [9, 0, 0, 0].

I think the formula for the projection of b onto the subspace spanned by v₁ and v₂ is given by proj = A (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b, where A is the matrix whose columns are v₁ and v₂. But wait, is that right? Oh, right, that's when you have a subspace spanned by the columns of A, so yeah.

Wait, or is there another way? Maybe using Gram-Schmidt? But that might be more complicated. I think using the formula with A is the way to go.

So first, let me construct matrix A. A should have v₁ and v₂ as columns:

A = [
[2, -2],
[2, 2],
[1, 0],
[0, 1]
]

Wait, no, the columns are v₁ and v₂. So the first column is [2; 2; 1; 0], and the second is [-2; 2; 0; 1]. So yes, the matrix above is correct.

Next, compute A^T A. Let me calculate that. A^T is the transpose, so it's a 4x2 matrix. Multiplying A^T (4x2) by A (2x4) gives a 2x2 matrix.

A^T A = [ [2*2 + 2*2 + 1*1 + 0*0 , 2*(-2) + 2*2 + 1*0 + 0*1 ],
          [ (-2)*2 + 2*2 + 0*1 + 1*0 , (-2)^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 ] ]

Wait, no, I think I should compute each element properly.

Compute first element of A^T A: v₁ · v₁.

v₁ · v₁ = (2)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 + (0)^2 = 4 +4 +1 +0 = 9.

Second element, first row, second column: v₁ · v₂.

v₁ · v₂ = (2)(-2) + (2)(2) + (1)(0) + (0)(1) = -4 +4 +0+0=0.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck: 2*(-2)= -4, 2*2=4, 1*0=0, 0*1=0. So sum is (-4 +4) = 0. So yes, v₁ and v₂ are orthogonal? That's interesting.

Third element (second row, first column) is same as second element because A^T A is symmetric, so also 0.

Fourth element, v₂ · v₂: (-2)^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 +1^2 =4 +4 +0 +1=9.

So A^T A is [[9,0],[0,9]]. That's a diagonal matrix with 9 on the diagonal. So the inverse of that would be [[1/9, 0],[0,1/9]].

Now, the projection formula is proj = A (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b.

So let's compute A^T b first. Since b is [9,0,0,0], let's compute A^T multiplied by b.

A^T is:

[2, 2, 1, 0]
[-2, 2, 0, 1]

So A^T b is a 2x1 vector where each component is the dot product of each row of A^T with b.

First component: 2*9 + 2*0 +1*0 +0*0 = 18.

Second component: (-2)*9 + 2*0 +0*0 +1*0 = -18.

So A^T b = [18; -18].

Now, multiply (A^T A)^{-1} with this vector. Since (A^T A)^{-1} is [[1/9,0],[0,1/9]], each component is divided by 9.

So (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b = [18/9, -18/9]^T = [2, -2]^T.

Now, multiply this by A to get the projection vector. So A * [2; -2].

Let me compute that.

First column of A is [2;2;1;0], multiplied by 2: [4;4;2;0].

Second column is [-2;2;0;1], multiplied by -2: [4; -4; 0; -2].

Wait, no: Wait, when you do A * [2; -2], it's 2*v₁ + (-2)*v₂.

So v₁ is [2;2;1;0], multiplied by 2: [4,4,2,0].

v₂ is [-2;2;0;1], multiplied by (-2): [4, -4, 0, -2].

Now, sum these two vectors: [4+4, 4+(-4), 2+0, 0+(-2)] → [8, 0, 2, -2].

So the projection vector is [8, 0, 2, -2]. Let me check the options. Option D is [8, 0, 2, -2]. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I think I should double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in matrix multiplication.

Wait, the projection formula: proj = A (A^T A)^{-1} (A^T b). So let's go through each step again.

A^T A is [[9,0],[0,9]], inverse is [[1/9, 0],[0,1/9]].

A^T b: [18; -18].

Multiply (A^T A)^{-1} by A^T b: [2; -2].

Then, A * [2; -2] = 2*v₁ -2*v₂.

v₁ is [2,2,1,0], so 2*v₁ is [4,4,2,0].

v₂ is [-2,2,0,1], so -2*v₂ is [4, -4, 0, -2].

Adding these two: [4+4, 4-4, 2+0, 0-2] → [8,0,2,-2]. Yep, same as before.

Looking at the options, D matches this result. So I'm confident the correct answer is D.

To find the orthogonal projection of **9e₁** onto the subspace of **R⁴** spanned by the vectors **v₁ = [2, 2, 1, 0]** and **v₂ = [-2, 2, 0, 1]**, we use the projection formula:

\[
\text{proj} = A (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b
\]

Here, **A** is the matrix with **v₁** and **v₂** as columns:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -2 \\
2 & 2 \\
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
b = 9e_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
9 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( A^T A \)
\[
A^T A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
-2 & 2 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -2 \\
2 & 2 \\
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
9 & 0 \\
0 & 9
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( (A^T A)^{-1} \)
Since \( A^T A \) is diagonal, its inverse is:

\[
(A^T A)^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{9} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{9}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( A^T b \)
\[
A^T b = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
-2 & 2 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
9 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
18 \\
-18
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b \)
\[
(A^T A)^{-1} A^T b = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{9} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{9}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
18 \\
-18
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
-2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( A (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b \)
\[
A (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -2 \\
2 & 2 \\
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
-2
\end{bmatrix}
= 2 \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
2 \\
1 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
+ (-2) \begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\
2 \\
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
8 \\
0 \\
2 \\
-2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Final Answer
The orthogonal projection of **9e₁** onto the subspace is **[8, 0, 2, -2]**. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**D: [8, 0, 2, -2]**
