Okay, so I have this question about DiGeorge/Shprintzen syndrome and which chromosome deletion causes it. Hmm, I remember that this syndrome is related to some kind of chromosomal deletion, but I'm not exactly sure which one. Let me think.

I think DiGeorge syndrome is also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Wait, yeah, that rings a bell. So the deletion is on chromosome 22, specifically the q11.2 region. Shprintzen syndrome is another name for it, right? I've heard them used interchangeably.

So the options are A through J, each with a number. The question is asking which chromosome, so the number 22 is the key here. Looking at the options, option F is 22. So the answer should be F.

I don't remember all the other options off the top of my head, but I'm pretty confident about 22 being the correct chromosome for DiGeorge. The other syndromes I know, like Down is 21, Turner is X, but this one's definitely 22. So yeah, I'm going with F.
