Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric charges and forces. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup is that there are three particles on the x-axis. Particle 1 has a charge of -5.00 q, and particle 2 has +2.00 q. They're separated by a distance L. Now, particle 3, which has an unknown charge q3, needs to be placed somewhere such that the net electrostatic force on it from particles 1 and 2 is zero. I need to find the x-coordinate of particle 3.

Hmm, so the key here is that the forces from particles 1 and 2 on particle 3 must cancel each other out. Since force is a vector, their magnitudes must be equal and directions opposite.

Wait, but first, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Let's imagine the x-axis. Let's say particle 1 is at position x = 0, and particle 2 is at x = L. So the separation between them is L.

Now, particle 3 can be placed somewhere along the x-axis. The question is where? The net force on particle 3 from 1 and 2 should be zero. So the electric forces from 1 and 2 must balance each other.

I remember Coulomb's Law: the force between two charges is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². But since charges can be positive or negative, the direction of the force matters. So the sign of the charges will determine the direction of the force on particle 3.

Wait, but Coulomb's Law gives the magnitude, but the direction depends on whether the charges are attracting or repelling. So if the charges are opposite, the force is attractive; same sign, repulsive.

So, considering particle 3 is placed at some x-coordinate, say x, then the distances from particle 1 and particle 2 to particle 3 will determine the forces.

Wait, but the position of particle 3 could be either to the left of particle 1, between 1 and 2, or to the right of particle 2. I need to figure out where the forces would balance.

Let me think about possible regions where the net force could be zero.

Option 1: Particle 3 is placed between particles 1 and 2.

In this case, the force from particle 1 on 3 would be to the right (since particle 1 is negative, and if 3 is between, then the force would be repulsive or attractive depending on particle 3's charge). Similarly, the force from particle 2 on 3 would be to the left (since particle 2 is positive, and if 3 is between, the force direction depends on the charge of 3).

Wait, but the charge of particle 3 is unknown. So the direction of each force on 3 depends on the signs of 1, 2, and 3. Hmm, but I don't know q3's sign. Wait, but maybe I can figure it out.

Wait, the problem says that the net force on particle 3 is zero. So the forces from 1 and 2 on 3 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So the forces must be in opposite directions. So either:

- Force from 1 is to the left, force from 2 is to the right, and they balance.

Or,

- Force from 1 is to the right, force from 2 is to the left.

But the charges are given. Particle 1 is negative, particle 2 is positive.

So, for the forces to balance, let's consider where the directions would allow that.

Case 1: Particle 3 is to the left of particle 1 (x < 0). 

In this case, the distance from 1 to 3 is |x - 0| = |x|, and from 2 to 3 is |x - L|.

The force from 1 on 3 would be:

If particle 3 is negative, then the force from 1 (which is also negative) would be repulsive, pushing 3 to the left. If 3 is positive, the force from 1 would be attractive, pulling 3 to the right.

Wait, but Coulomb's law says that F = k * (q1 * q3) / r². So the sign of the force (direction) depends on the product q1 * q3.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Let me assign directions based on the positions.

Let me denote the position of particle 3 as x.

If x is between 0 and L, then:

- The distance from 1 to 3 is x.

- The distance from 2 to 3 is L - x.

The force from 1 on 3: F1. The direction depends on the product of q1 and q3.

Similarly, the force from 2 on 3: F2.

We need F1 + F2 = 0, so F1 = -F2.

Which means the magnitudes are equal and directions opposite.

So let's write the expressions.

F1 = k * (q1 * q3) / (x)^2

F2 = k * (q2 * q3) / (L - x)^2

But wait, the sign of F1 and F2 depends on q1*q3 and q2*q3 respectively. Because force is a vector pointing in the direction of the force.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the net force as a vector. So, the net force on 3 is the sum of F1 and F2, each being vectors.

But considering the positions, the directions of F1 and F2 would determine their signs.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the forces in terms of direction. Let's say that particle 3 is placed at x between 0 and L. Then:

- The force from particle 1 (q1=-5q) on 3: since q1 is negative, if q3 is positive, F1 would be attractive, pulling 3 towards q1 (to the left). If q3 is negative, F1 would be repulsive, pushing 3 to the right.

Similarly, the force from particle 2 (q2=+2q) on 3: if q3 is positive, F2 is attractive, pulling 3 to the right (since particle 2 is at x=L, pulling 3 towards L). If q3 is negative, F2 is repulsive, pushing 3 to the left.

Wait, but for the forces to balance, they must be in opposite directions. So, the direction of F1 and F2 must be opposite.

So for F1 to point left and F2 to point right, or vice versa.

Let me think: if q3 is positive, then F1 is leftwards (since q1 is negative, so opposite charges attract, so F1 pulls towards q1 at x=0, which is to the left). F2 is rightwards (since q2 is positive, same charge as q3? No, wait: if q3 is positive, then q2 is positive, so they would repel. Wait, no: Coulomb's law says like charges repel, opposites attract. So if q3 is positive, it's same as q2 (which is +2q), so F2 would be repulsive, pushing 3 to the left. Wait, that's in the case where 3 is between 1 and 2.

Wait wait, no: if 3 is at x, between 0 and L, and q3 is positive.

So, particle 2 is at x=L, positive. So the force on 3 from 2 would be repulsive, because same sign. So F2 would push 3 to the left, towards x=0.

Wait, but I thought for a moment that F2 would be right if q3 is positive, but no, same charges, so repulsion.

So, if q3 is positive, F1 is leftward (attraction to q1), F2 is leftward (repulsion from q2). So both forces would be in the same direction, adding up. So net force can't be zero in that case. So that can't be where the net force is zero.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try again.

If 3 is placed between 1 and 2 (x between 0 and L):

- F1 is the force from q1 (-5q) on q3.

If q3 is positive:

F1 is attractive, so 3 is pulled towards 1, meaning to the left (negative x direction).

F2 is the force from q2 (+2q) on q3. Since q3 is positive, same sign, so F2 is repulsive, pushing 3 to the left (negative x direction).

So both forces are to the left, so F_net is leftward. So net force can't be zero here.

If q3 is negative:

F1 is the force from q1 (-5q) on q3 (-). So same sign. So F1 is repulsive, pushing 3 to the right.

F2 is the force from q2 (+2q) on q3 (-). Opposite signs, so F2 is attractive, pulling 3 towards q2, which is to the right.

So both forces are to the right, so F_net is rightward. Again, can't be zero.

Hmm, that's a problem. So if I place 3 between 1 and 2, and q3 is either positive or negative, the forces are in the same direction. So net force can't be zero. So the only possibilities are when 3 is to the left of 1 or to the right of 2.

So let's consider placing 3 to the left of 1 (x < 0).

In this case, the distances are r1 = |x| (since x is negative, r1 = -x), and r2 = L - x (because x is to the left of 0, so the distance between 2 and 3 is L - x, which would be more than L).

So F1 is the force from q1 on q3. If q3 is positive, F1 would be attractive, pulling 3 to the right (towards q1 at x=0). F2 is the force from q2 on q3; if q3 is positive, F2 is repulsive, pushing 3 to the left (since q2 is positive, same sign).

So in this setup, F1 is to the right, F2 to the left. So their directions are opposite. So it's possible for these forces to balance.

Similarly, if q3 is negative, then F1 would be repulsive (since q1 is negative), pushing 3 to the left (away from q1). F2 would be attractive, pulling 3 towards q2 (to the right). So again, F1 is left, F2 is right: opposite directions.

So in either case (q3 positive or negative), placing 3 to the left of 1 can result in opposite forces. So the net force can be zero here.

Alternatively, placing 3 to the right of 2 (x > L). Let's see.

In that case, the distances are r1 = x, r2 = x - L.

F1 is the force from q1 on q3. If q3 is positive, F1 is attractive, pulling 3 to the left (towards q1). F2 is repulsive, pushing 3 to the right (since same sign as q2). So F1 is left, F2 is right: opposite directions.

If q3 is negative, F1 is repulsive, pushing 3 to the right. F2 is attractive, pulling 3 to the left (towards q2). Again, opposite directions.

So both regions (left of 1 and right of 2) are possible for the net force to be zero.

So now, I need to determine in which region the forces can balance and find the position.

Wait, but the problem is that the charges are q1 = -5q and q2 = +2q. So their magnitudes are different. So the point where the forces balance may be in one of these regions.

Let me formalize this.

Let me denote x as the position of particle 3.

Case 1: x < 0 (left of 1)

The forces on 3 are F1 (from 1) and F2 (from 2).

The net force is zero, so F1 = -F2.

Let's calculate the magnitudes.

The magnitude of F1 is k * |q1 * q3| / r1².

Similarly, F2's magnitude is k * |q2 * q3| / r2².

Since the directions are opposite, the signs would be opposite. But when considering magnitudes, we can set |F1| = |F2|.

So,

k * |q1 * q3| / r1² = k * |q2 * q3| / r2².

We can cancel k and |q3| from both sides (assuming q3 is not zero, which it isn't because then there would be no force).

So,

|q1| / r1² = |q2| / r2².

So,

(5 q) / (x)^2 = (2 q) / (L - x)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, in case x is left of 1, x is negative. So the distance from 1 is |x| = -x (since x is negative). Distance from 2 is |x - L| = L - x (since x is negative, L - x is larger than L).

So,

(5 q) / ( (-x) )² = (2 q) / (L - x)^2.

Because |x| is -x, since x is negative.

So,

5 / (x)^2 = 2 / (L - x)^2.

Wait, the q's cancel because both sides have q, and we're taking absolute values (so it's 5q and 2q, as I'm taking absolute values).

So,

5 / x² = 2 / (L - x)^2.

Take square roots on both sides:

sqrt(5)/x = sqrt(2)/(L -x).

Wait, but x is negative here, so maybe I should take absolute values into account. Hmm, perhaps it's better to square both sides after cross-multiplying.

Let me rearrange:

5 (L - x)^2 = 2 x^2.

Expand (L - x)^2: L² - 2 L x + x².

So,

5(L² - 2 L x + x²) = 2 x².

5 L² - 10 L x +5 x² = 2 x².

Bring all terms to one side:

5 L² -10 L x +5 x² -2 x² =0.

So,

5 L² -10 L x +3 x² =0.

This is a quadratic in x. Let me write it as:

3 x² -10 L x +5 L² =0.

Divide both sides by L² to make it dimensionless:

3 (x/L)^2 -10 (x/L) +5 =0.

Let me set y = x/L. Then the equation becomes:

3 y² -10 y +5=0.

Solving for y using quadratic formula:

y = [10 ± sqrt(100 - 60)] / (2 *3) = [10 ± sqrt(40)]/6 = [10 ± 2*sqrt(10)]/6 = [5 ± sqrt(10)]/3.

So,

y = [5 + sqrt(10)]/3  or y = [5 - sqrt(10)]/3.

Compute the numerical values.

sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623.

So,

y1 = (5 +3.1623)/3 ≈ (8.1623)/3 ≈ 2.7208.

y2 = (5 -3.1623)/3 ≈ (1.8377)/3 ≈ 0.6126.

But wait, in this case, x is supposed to be less than 0 (left of 1). So y = x/L would be negative.

But the solutions I got are positive. So that's a problem. It suggests that in the case where x is to the left of 1, the solutions for y are positive, which would mean x is positive, which contradicts our assumption that x is negative.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check the equation. So when x is to the left of 1 (x <0), then r1 = |x| = -x (since x is negative), and r2 = L -x (since x is negative, L -x is L + |x|, which is larger than L).

So the equation is:

5/(x)^2 = 2/(L -x)^2.

Wait, but in reality, x is negative, so (L -x) would be L + |x|, which is greater than L.

So when I set x as negative, let's say x = -a, where a is positive.

Then, the equation becomes:

5/(a)^2 = 2/(L +a)^2.

Which can be rewritten as:

5 (L +a)^2 = 2 a^2.

Expanding (L +a)^2: L² + 2 L a + a^2.

So,

5(L² + 2 L a + a²) = 2 a².

5 L² +10 L a +5 a² = 2 a².

Bring all terms to one side:

5 L² +10 L a +3 a² =0.

This is a quadratic in a:

3 a² +10 L a +5 L² =0.

Wait, but a is positive, so let's compute the discriminant:

D = (10 L)^2 -4 *3 *5 L^2 = 100 L² -60 L²=40 L².

So,

a = [ -10 L ± sqrt(40 L²) ]/(2 *3) = [ -10 L ± (2 L sqrt(10)) ]/(6).

Factor out L:

a = L [ -10 ± 2 sqrt(10) ] /6 = L [ (-10 ± 6.3246 ) ] /6.

Compute the two possibilities:

First solution:

[ -10 +6.3246 ] = -3.6754 → /6 → -0.6126 L → a is positive, but this gives a negative value. So invalid.

Second solution:

[ -10 -6.3246 ] = -16.3246 → /6 → -2.7208 L → negative a, which is invalid because a>0.

Wait, so no solution in this case. That suggests that when placing 3 to the left of 1, there's no solution. Hmm, that's odd
