Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to compute the area of a triangle whose altitudes are 10, 12, and 15. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that the area of a triangle can be found using the base and the corresponding altitude. The formula is Area = (1/2) * base * height. But wait, in this case, they're giving me all three altitudes, not the sides. So I'm a bit confused about how to approach this.

Let me think. Each altitude corresponds to a particular side. So for a triangle, each side has an altitude perpendicular to it. Let's denote the sides opposite to the altitudes of lengths 10, 12, and 15 as a, b, and c respectively. So, the area can be expressed in three different ways using each altitude and the corresponding base.

So, the area (A) would be (1/2)*a*10 = (1/2)*b*12 = (1/2)*c*15. That means a*10 = b*12 = c*15 = 2A. So from this, I can express the sides in terms of the area.

Let me write that down. So:

a = (2A)/10 = A/5,
b = (2A)/12 = A/6,
c = (2A)/15 = 2A/15.

So the sides a, b, c are proportional to 1/5, 1/6, and 2/15 times the same area A. Wait, but I'm trying to find A, so I need another equation that relates the sides a, b, c.

Oh right, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequalities, but that might not be directly helpful here. Instead, I should think about using Heron's formula, which relates the area to the sides of the triangle. Heron's formula says that A = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.

But wait, since I don't know A yet, but I have a, b, c in terms of A, maybe I can substitute them into Heron's formula and solve for A.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, express a, b, c in terms of A:

a = A/5,
b = A/6,
c = (2A)/15.

Now compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (a + b + c)/2 = [ (A/5) + (A/6) + (2A/15) ] / 2.

Let me compute the numerator first. Let's find a common denominator for the fractions. 5, 6, 15. The least common denominator is 30.

So:

A/5 = 6A/30,
A/6 = 5A/30,
2A/15 = 4A/30.

Adding them up: 6A +5A +4A =15A, over 30. So 15A/30 = A/2.

So the numerator is A/2, so s = (A/2)/2 = A/4.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recheck. Oh no, wait: a + b + c is (6A/30 +5A/30 +4A/30) = (15A/30) = A/2. So s is (A/2)/2 = A/4. So s = A/4.

Now, using Heron's formula, A = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

Let's plug in the values. s = A/4.

s - a = (A/4) - (A/5) = (5A -4A)/20 = A/20.

s - b = (A/4) - (A/6) = (3A -2A)/12 = A/12.

s - c = (A/4) - (2A/15) = Let's compute this. The denominator would be 60.

A/4 = 15A/60,
2A/15 = 8A/60.

So 15A/60 -8A/60 =7A/60. So s -c =7A/60.

Now, Heron's formula becomes:

A = sqrt[ s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c) ) ] 
= sqrt[ (A/4) * (A/20) * (A/12) * (7A/60) ) ]

Wait, but A is the area, so if we're squaring it, that's going to complicate things. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

A² = (A/4) * (A/20) * (A/12) * (7A/60)

Multiply the terms on the right:

Let me compute the coefficients and the A terms separately.

Coefficients: (1/4) * (1/20) * (1/12) * (7/60) = (1 * 1 * 1 *7) / (4 *20 *12 *60).

Compute denominator: 4 *20 =80; 80*12=960; 960*60=57,600.

So coefficients =7 / 57600.

Now the A terms: each term is A, and there are four A's multiplied, so A⁴.

So overall, A² = (7 /57600) * A⁴.

Let me write that as:

A² = (7 A⁴) /57600.

Now, rearrange to solve for A².

Multiply both sides by 57600:

57600 A² =7 A⁴.

Bring all terms to one side:

7 A⁴ -57600 A² =0.

Factor out A²:

A² (7 A² -57600) =0.

So the solutions are A²=0, which isn't possible for a triangle, or 7 A²=57600 → A²=57600/7 → A= sqrt(57600/7).

Compute sqrt(57600)=240, because 240²=57600. So A=240/sqrt(7).

But wait, we can rationalize the denominator: 240√7 /7.

So the area A is 240√7 /7.

Looking at the options, that's option C: 240√7 /7.

Wait, let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, when I calculated s -c, I think I made a mistake. Let me recheck that.

s = A/4.

c= 2A/15.

So s - c = (A/4) - (2A/15).

Let me compute this correctly.

The least common denominator for 4 and 15 is 60.

A/4 =15A/60,

2A/15=8A/60.

So 15A/60 -8A/60=7A/60. So that was correct.

Then, s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c) = (A/4)*(A/20)*(A/12)*(7A/60) → correct.

So the product is (7A⁴)/(4*20*12*60).

Compute denominator: 4*20=80; 80*12=960; 960*60=57600. So 7A⁴/57600.

So A²=7A⁴/(57600).

Yes, which leads to 57600 A²=7 A⁴ → A² (7A² -57600)=0 → A²=57600/7 → A=240/sqrt(7)=240√7/7.

Yes, so the correct answer is option C.

To compute the area of the triangle whose altitudes are 10, 12, and 15, we start by expressing the sides in terms of the area \( A \). Using the formula for the area of a triangle, \( A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height} \), we have:

\[
a \cdot 10 = b \cdot 12 = c \cdot 15 = 2A
\]

From this, the sides can be written as:

\[
a = \frac{A}{5}, \quad b = \frac{A}{6}, \quad c = \frac{2A}{15}
\]

Next, we calculate the semi-perimeter \( s \):

\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{\frac{A}{5} + \frac{A}{6} + \frac{2A}{15}}{2}
\]

Finding a common denominator for the fractions (30):

\[
\frac{A}{5} = \frac{6A}{30}, \quad \frac{A}{6} = \frac{5A}{30}, \quad \frac{2A}{15} = \frac{4A}{30}
\]

Adding these:

\[
a + b + c = \frac{6A}{30} + \frac{5A}{30} + \frac{4A}{30} = \frac{15A}{30} = \frac{A}{2}
\]

Thus:

\[
s = \frac{\frac{A}{2}}{2} = \frac{A}{4}
\]

Using Heron's formula, \( A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \), we substitute \( s \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[
s - a = \frac{A}{4} - \frac{A}{5} = \frac{5A - 4A}{20} = \frac{A}{20}, \quad s - b = \frac{A}{4} - \frac{A}{6} = \frac{3A - 2A}{12} = \frac{A}{12}
\]

\[
s - c = \frac{A}{4} - \frac{2A}{15} = \frac{15A}{60} - \frac{8A}{60} = \frac{7A}{60}
\]

Now, Heron's formula becomes:

\[
A = \sqrt{\frac{A}{4} \cdot \frac{A}{20} \cdot \frac{A}{12} \cdot \frac{7A}{60}}
\]

Simplify the terms:

\[
A^2 = \frac{A}{4} \cdot \frac{A}{20} \cdot \frac{A}{12} \cdot \frac{7A}{60} = \frac{7A^4}{57600}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
A^2 = \frac{7A^4}{57600} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 57600A^2 = 7A^4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A^2(7A^2 - 57600) = 0
\]

Since \( A \neq 0 \), we solve:

\[
7A^2 = 57600 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A^2 = \frac{57600}{7} \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = \frac{240\sqrt{7}}{7}
\]

Thus, the area of the triangle is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{240\sqrt{7}}{7}}
\]

The correct answer is **C**.
