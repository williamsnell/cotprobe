Question:

A lumber supplier and a fence company signed the following agreement on May 1:"The supplier promises to sell and the fence company promises to buy 7,000 sections of redwood stockade fence at $30 per section. Each section is to be made of good quality split redwood poles and is to be 7 feet long and 6 feet high; 1,000 sections are to be delivered by seller on or before June 1, and 1,000 sections by the first day in each of the following six months. Payment for the sections to be made within 10 days of delivery. "The first shipment of 1,000 sections arrived on May 27, and the fence company sent its payment on June5. The second shipment arrived on July 1, and the fence company made payment on July 5. The August shipment arrived on the afternoon of August 1. After the initial inspection, the redwood poles were found to be 7 feet long and 6. 25 feet high. The manager of the fence company then called the president of the lumber supplier. During their conversation, the president told the manager that the lumber supplier could not replace the August shipment but would allow a price adjustment. The manager refused the president's offer. The next day, the manager sent the president a fax stating that he was hereby canceling all future deliveries and returning the last shipment because of nonconformity. If the lumber supplier sues the fence company for breach of contract, the court will most likely hold that the lumber company will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the fence company has the right to refuse nonconforming goods.
B: not succeed, because the fence company has the right to cancel due to noncompliance with the agreed specifications.
C: succeed, because the agreement did not specify that the fence company could cancel for nonconformity.
D: succeed, because all deliveries to date have been timely.
E: not succeed, because the deviation impaired the value of the entire contract.
F: succeed, because the president offered to adjust the price for the August shipment.
G: succeed, because the difference in pole height did not significantly alter the value of the fence sections.
H: not succeed, because the president refused to replace the nonconforming poles.
I: succeed, because the fence company did not provide adequate notice of cancellation.
J: not succeed, because the fence company made all payments promptly as agreed.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it carefully. So, there's a lumber supplier and a fence company that signed an agreement on May 1st. The supplier agrees to sell 7,000 sections of redwood fence, and the fence company agrees to buy them at $30 each. Each section has specific requirements: made of good quality split redwood poles, 7 feet long, and 6 feet high. The delivery schedule is 1,000 sections each month for seven months, starting June 1. Payment is due within 10 days of delivery.

So, looking at the shipments: the first shipment arrived May 27, and the fence company paid on June 5. That's within 10 days, so that's okay. The second shipment arrived July 1, payment on July 5—again, within the timeframe. Then, the August shipment arrived on August 1 in the afternoon. Upon inspection, the poles were 7 feet long but 6.25 feet high. So, that's a quarter of a foot over the specified 6 feet.

The manager called the president, who said they couldn't replace the shipment but offered a price adjustment. The manager refused and then faxed the next day, canceling all future deliveries and returning the last shipment because of nonconformity.

The question is, if the supplier sues for breach, what would the court say? The options are from A to J.

I remember from my contracts class that when goods don't conform to the agreement, the buyer has certain rights. Under the UCC, which governs sales contracts, buyers can reject nonconforming goods. But there are specific procedures for that. Also, the right to revoke acceptance might apply if the defect substantially impairs the value.

So, in this case, the August shipment was 6.25 feet high instead of 6. That's a 0.25-foot deviation. Is that a material breach? Or is it a minor defect that doesn't substantially impair the value?

The manager rejected the offer of a price adjustment and instead canceled all future shipments and returned the last one. So, the fence company is treating this as a material breach, allowing them to cancel the entire contract.

I think about the perfect tender rule. Under UCC §2-601, a buyer can reject goods if they fail to conform in any respect, even if the nonconformity is minor. But the seller can cure defects within a reasonable time. However, in this case, the president said they couldn't replace the shipment, so they couldn't cure. But the buyer has to notify promptly of rejection.

Wait, here, the shipment arrived August 1. The manager called the same day, and the next day sent a fax canceling. So, that seems prompt.

But the issue is whether the deviation is significant enough to allow rejection. The height being a quarter foot taller—does that impair the value? Or is it a minor defect?

If the fence sections are 6.25 feet high instead of 6, perhaps that's a minor variation. But maybe in the context of fencing, height could be important. Maybe the customer had specific requirements, like matching existing fences or meeting local regulations. But the problem doesn't specify that, so we have to go on the facts given.

Under the UCC, even minor defects allow the buyer to reject, unless the contract specifies otherwise. So, regardless of whether the defect is material, the buyer can reject for nonconformity as long as they do so promptly.

But wait, if the nonconformity is immaterial, the seller can cure. But here, the seller offered a price adjustment but not a replacement. So, perhaps the buyer's rejection was proper.

Alternatively, if the deviation is so minor that it doesn't substantially impair the value, the buyer might not have the right to revoke acceptance. Because, under UCC §2-608, revocation of acceptance is only allowed if the defect is substantial.

Wait, but in this case, the buyer is rejecting the goods upon delivery, not accepting them and then revoking later. So, the initial rejection under §2-601 would apply. Because upon delivery, if the goods are nonconforming, the buyer can reject if done promptly.

So, the fence company received the shipment on August 1, inspected, found nonconformity, called the same day, and sent a fax the next day. That's prompt.

Moreover, the agreement didn't specify that minor deviations are acceptable. So, the fence company has the right to refuse nonconforming goods.

Wait, looking at the answer options:

Option A: not succeed, because the fence company has the right to refuse nonconforming goods.

Option B: not succeed, because they can cancel due to noncompliance.

Option G says the supplier would succeed because the difference didn't alter value significantly.

So, if the court finds that the nonconformity was minor, then the fence company's rejection would not be justified. But under the perfect tender rule, even minor defects allow rejection.

Hmm. Wait, but in practice, courts sometimes consider whether the nonconformity is material. The UCC allows for this. If the defect is so minor that it doesn't affect the value, the buyer can't just reject. But if it's a clear breach, even minor, the buyer can reject.

In this case, the height is 6.25 instead of 6. That's a 4% increase. Maybe that's not significant. But maybe in the context of the contract, the exact dimensions were important.

But the contract specified exact measurements, so any deviation would be a breach. So the fence company has the right to refuse.

Wait, but the president offered a price adjustment. The manager refused. So, the supplier was willing to adjust the price, which suggests that they acknowledged the nonconformity but didn't offer replacement.

So, the fence company's decision to cancel all future deliveries might be an overreach. Because each shipment is a separate delivery under the installment contract. So, perhaps the buyer can reject the nonconforming installment but can't cancel the entire contract unless the defect is so material that it breaches the entire agreement.

Wait, the contract is for 7,000 sections over seven months. Each delivery is an installment. Under UCC §2-612, if a delivery is nonconforming, the buyer can reject that installment. But to cancel the entire contract, the nonconformity must substantially impair the value of the entire contract.

In this case, the deviation is 0.25 feet in height. If that's not a significant issue, then the buyer can't treat the whole contract as breached. They can only reject that one installment.

So, the fence company canceled all future deliveries. If the nonconformity is not material to the entire contract, then the fence company's cancellation would be a breach, and the supplier could sue successfully.

So, the key is whether the nonconformity in the August shipment substantially impaired the entire contract. If it's just a minor defect in one installment, then the buyer can't cancel the whole contract.

In that case, the supplier would succeed because the fence company's cancellation was improper.

Looking back at the options:

Option G says the supplier would succeed because the difference in height didn't significantly alter the value.

Option B says the fence company can cancel due to noncompliance, but that's only if the noncompliance is material.

So, the correct answer depends on whether the 0.25-foot height is a material breach. If it's not, then the fence company can't cancel the whole contract.

Under the UCC, a buyer can reject goods for any nonconformity, even minor, but when it comes to canceling the entire contract, it requires a material breach.

In this scenario, the nonconformity is minor. So, the fence company could reject the August shipment but can't cancel the entire contract. Therefore, by canceling all future deliveries, the fence company breached the contract, allowing the supplier to sue successfully.

So, the correct answer would be G: succeed, because the difference in pole height did not significantly alter the value of the fence sections.

Another angle: the contract allows for cancellation if there's a breach, but only if it's a material breach. Since the deviation was minimal, the fence company overstepped by canceling all deliveries, making them the breaching party.

So, the court would likely hold that the supplier (lumber company) would succeed because the minor deviation didn't justify cancellation of the entire contract.
</think>

The agreement between the lumber supplier and the fence company specifies that each section of fence must be 7 feet long and 6 feet high. The August shipment arrived with poles that were 6.25 feet high, deviating from the agreed specifications. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), buyers have the right to reject nonconforming goods under the perfect tender rule (UCC §2-601). However, this right is subject to limitations, particularly when the nonconformity is minor and does not substantially impair the value of the goods.

In this case, the deviation in height (0.25 feet) is relatively minor and does not appear to significantly alter the value or functionality of the fence sections. While the fence company could reject the August shipment, canceling all future deliveries constitutes an overreach. Under UCC §2-612, cancellation of the entire contract is only justified if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of the entire agreement. Since the deviation is minor, the fence company's decision to cancel all future deliveries was improper, making them the breaching party.

The lumber supplier offered a price adjustment, acknowledging the nonconformity, but the fence company refused and proceeded to cancel the entire contract. Courts typically require material breaches to justify such actions, and the minor deviation here does not meet that threshold. Therefore, the lumber supplier would likely succeed in a breach of contract claim against the fence company.

The correct answer is:

G: succeed, because the difference in pole height did not significantly alter the value of the fence sections.

Answer: G
