Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the pressure exerted by 1.0 mole of xenon gas when it's confined to 1.0 dm³ at 25°C. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

I remember from my chemistry class that the ideal gas law is probably the way to go here. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, let me make sure I have all the values right. The problem gives me n = 1.0 mole, V = 1.0 dm³. Oh, but wait, I think the gas constant R is usually in terms of liters, right? Because 1 dm³ is the same as 1 liter. So that should make things easier.

The temperature is 25°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin because the gas law requires absolute temperature. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 25 + 273.15 equals 298.15 K. I'll just round that to 298 K for simplicity.

Now, the gas constant R... I think there are a few common values. Like, 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K is one of them. Yeah, that's the one I'll use here because the problem is asking for pressure in atmospheres.

Putting it all together: PV = nRT => P = (nRT)/V.

Plugging in the numbers: n = 1.0 mol, R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T = 298 K, V = 1.0 L.

So P = (1.0 * 0.0821 * 298) / 1.0. Let me calculate that. 0.0821 multiplied by 298. Let me do that step by step.

0.08 times 300 is 24, but wait, it's 298, which is 2 less than 300. So 0.0821 * 298. Let's compute 0.0821 * 300 first, which is 24.63. But since it's 298, that's 2 less, so 24.63 - (0.0821 * 2). 0.0821*2=0.1642. So subtracting that gives 24.63 - 0.1642 = 24.4658 atm.

Wait, that seems a bit high because looking at the options, the highest is 40 atm. But wait, let me double-check my calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait a second. 0.0821 * 298. Let me compute it more accurately:

0.0821 multiplied by 298.

Let me break it down: 298 is 200 + 90 + 8.

So 0.0821 * 200 = 16.42

0.0821 * 90 = 7.389

0.0821 * 8 = 0.6568

Adding them up: 16.42 + 7.389 = 23.809; plus 0.6568 is 24.4658. So yes, that's correct.

So P = 24.4658 atm. Let me look at the options. The options are A:21, B:28, C:30, D:12, E:18, F:35, G:25, H:15, I:40, J:10.

Hmm, the closest value to 24.47 atm is either option A (21) or G (25). Wait, 24.47 is closer to 25 than to 21. So why isn't 25 an option? Oh wait, G is 25 atm. So why is my calculation giving me approximately 24.47, which is about 24.5. So the options have G as 25, which is very close. But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of R. Let me double-check. Sometimes R is 0.08206 L·atm/mol·K, which is approximately 0.0821. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: Did I use the correct units for volume? The problem states 1.0 dm³, which is 1.0 liter, so that's correct. Moles are correct at 1.0, temperature in Kelvin is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is Xe an ideal gas under these conditions? Well, the problem doesn't specify anything about real gas behavior, so I think we're supposed to treat it as ideal.

So, my calculation gives about 24.47 atm. Looking at the options, G is 25 atm, which is the closest. But wait, another option is A:21, which is quite a bit lower. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.0821 * 298 exactly.

Compute 298 * 0.0821:

Let me do 298 * 0.08 = 23.84.

298 * 0.0021 = ?

0.0021 * 300 is 0.63, but it's 298, so 0.0021 * 2 = 0.0042, so subtract that from 0.63: 0.63 - 0.0042 = 0.6258.

So total is 23.84 + 0.6258 = 24.4658 atm.

So that's correct. So the pressure should be approximately 24.47 atm.

Looking back at the options, option G is 25 atm, which is the closest. So why is that not an option here? Wait, the options given are:

A:21 atm, B:28, C:30, D:12, E:18, F:35, G:25, H:15, I:40, J:10.

So G is 25 atm, which is the closest to our calculated 24.47 atm. So the correct answer should be G:25 atm.

Wait, but wait another thought. Maybe I should check if I used the right value of R. Because sometimes R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but that's when pressure is in Pascals. But in this case, since we're using atm, 0.0821 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me try another approach: using R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So, P = (nRT)/V = (1 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K) / 1 L.

So that's 0.0821 * 298 = ?

Another way: 298 * 0.08 = 23.84, 298 * 0.0021= 0.6258. Sum is 24.4658 atm.

So again, that's 24.47 atm. So the closest option is G:25 atm. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but why isn't there an option that's exactly 24.47? Hmm, perhaps the problem expects an approximate value. Or maybe I missed something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the volume is in dm³, but sometimes, people get confused between dm³ and liters. Wait, 1 dm³ is exactly 1 liter. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the units for R are correct. Because sometimes, R is 8.314 kPa·L/mol·K or something else. Wait, no, 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K is correct.

Another thought: Maybe the temperature is in Celsius and I forgot to convert it? Wait, no, I converted 25°C to 298 K. That's correct.

Another check: Let's compute it again.

n=1, R=0.0821, T=298, V=1.

So P = 1 * 0.0821 * 298 / 1 = 24.4658 ≈ 24.47 atm.

So the options given are A:21, B:28, C:30, D:12, E:18, F:35, G:25, H:15, I:40, J:10.

So the closest is G:25 atm. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but the options don't have 24, so I must choose between 25 and perhaps 28. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in R.

Wait, let me check R's value again. No, 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K is correct. So I think I did this right. So the answer is G:25 atm.

To calculate the pressure exerted by 1.0 mole of xenon gas (Xe) confined to 1.0 dm³ at 25°C, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad P = \frac{nRT}{V}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- **\(n = 1.0 \, \text{mol}\)** (number of moles of Xe)
- **\(V = 1.0 \, \text{dm}^3 = 1.0 \, \text{L}\)** (volume in liters)
- **\(T = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298 \, \text{K}\)** (temperature in Kelvin, converted by adding 273.15)
- **\(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\)** (ideal gas constant in appropriate units)

### Step 2: Plug values into the formula
\[
P = \frac{(1.0)(0.0821)(298)}{1.0}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
First, calculate \(0.0821 \times 298\):
\[
0.0821 \times 298 = 24.4658 \, \text{atm}
\]

Thus:
\[
P = 24.4658 \, \text{atm} \approx 24.47 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated pressure (\(24.47 \, \text{atm}\)) is closest to **25 atm**, which corresponds to option **G**.

### Final Answer
G
