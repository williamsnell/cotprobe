Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about jurisprudence, and I'm supposed to figure out who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that jurisprudence is the study of law, so the quote is probably from someone who made significant contributions to legal philosophy. I'm trying to recall famous legal scholars and their notable quotes or works.

The phrase "the eye of law" suggests that jurisprudence provides insight or perspective into the law. Now, I'm trying to remember which of these thinkers used such a metaphor. 

Looking at the options:

A: Pound - I know he was an American legal realist, but I'm not sure about this specific quote.

B: Austin - He was a utilitarian and wrote about the command theory of law. I don't recall him using this exact phrase.

C: Savigny - A German jurist, part of the historical school. I think he focused more on law as evolving from the spirit of the people over time.

D: Hart - A modern legal philosopher known for "The Concept of Law." I don't think he used this phrase.

E: Bentham - He was a utilitarian and talked about law as the command of the sovereign. Not sure about the quote.

F: Dworkin - He's known for "Law's Empire" and the concept of law as integrity. Doesn't ring a bell with this quote.

G: Blackstone - He wrote "Commentaries on the Laws of England." I think he had a very structured view of law, but I'm not certain about the quote.

H: Laski - A political theorist, more into pluralism and sovereignty. Not sure.

I: Kelsen - Created the pure theory of law. His work was more about hierarchy of norms, not this metaphor.

J: Maine - He was a legal historian, known for "Ancient Law" and the phrase "from status to contract." But I'm not sure if he said "eye of law."

Wait, I'm trying to think if any of these have quotes about the role of jurisprudence. Oh, I remember that Blackstone was a key figure in the classical tradition of common law. His Commentaries were influential. Did he refer to jurisprudence as the eye of the law? I'm not 100% certain, but I think the phrase might be associated with him.

Alternatively, I think Maine might have used a metaphor about the eye of the law. Or was it someone else? I'm a bit confused. Another thought: sometimes "eye of the law" is used to describe something that's all-seeing or that brings clarity. Maybe Blackstone used it to emphasize how jurisprudence provides insight into the legal system.

I'm leaning towards option G: Blackstone. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, could it be someone else? Maybe it's Bentham or Austin. Wait, I think I might have heard that Blackstone used the term "eye" in a significant way. So I'll go with G.

The question asks who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." After considering various legal philosophers and their contributions, the most plausible answer is G: Blackstone. He was a key figure in legal scholarship, and his influential work, "Commentaries on the Laws of England," suggests that jurisprudence provides insight into the law, aligning with the metaphor of being the "eye of law."

Answer: G
