Question:

 Thomson discusses a different version of the violinist case wherein the violinist only needs to use your kidneys for one hour to survive. Her own view about this case is that

Options:

A: because the violinist's life is in danger, you have an absolute moral obligation to let them use your kidneys, regardless of the duration.
B: you have no obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys, but if you choose to do so, the violinist has the right to use them for that hour.
C: you have the right to disconnect the violinist at any point, regardless of the consequences for the violinist.
D: because you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.
E: even though you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, we should not conclude that he or she has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.
F: you have no obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour.
G: you have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, but the violinist does not have a right to use your kidneys.
H: the violinist has an obligation to disconnect him- or herself before that hour is over.
I: you have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, and the violinist also has a right to use your kidneys.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Thomson violinist question. I remember that Thomson's original thought experiment involves a violinist who needs to use your body for nine months, and her point was that even if you have a duty to help, that doesn't necessarily mean the violinist has a right to use your body. So, in the original case, she argues that you can unplug the violinist because your obligation doesn't create a right for them.

Now the question is about a different version where the violinist only needs your kidneys for one hour. I need to recall what Thomson's view on this variation is. I think she uses this shorter time frame to make a point about obligations versus rights. 

In the original case, she says that you have an obligation to let the violinist use your body because it's a significant sacrifice on your part, but that obligation doesn't equate to the violinist having a right. So even if you should help, the violinist doesn't have a claim that you must. So, in the one-hour scenario, I think she would say the same thing. You should let them use your kidneys for the hour because it's not a big burden, but that doesn't mean they have a right to do so.

Looking at the options:

Option E says: even though you ought to let them use your kidneys for an hour, we shouldn't conclude that they have a right. That matches what I was thinking.

Option D is the opposite, saying that because you ought to, they have a right. But that's not Thomson's view. She separates obligation from rights.

Option F says you have no obligation, which doesn't fit because the obligation is about the minimal burden. So F is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be E.

Thomson's argument distinguishes between having an obligation to assist and the existence of a right on the part of the individual needing assistance. In the original violinist case, she contends that while one may have a moral obligation to help, this does not grant the violinist a right to use another's body. Extending this reasoning to the scenario where the violinist needs only one hour of kidney use, Thomson would likely maintain that the minimal burden imposes an obligation to help, but it does not confer a right upon the violinist. 

Analyzing the options, **E** aligns with this reasoning, as it states that although there is an obligation to let the violinist use the kidneys for an hour, this does not establish a right for the violinist. Other options, such as **D**, incorrectly conflate obligation with rights, while **F** denies the existence of any obligation, which contradicts Thomson's position.

Answer: E
