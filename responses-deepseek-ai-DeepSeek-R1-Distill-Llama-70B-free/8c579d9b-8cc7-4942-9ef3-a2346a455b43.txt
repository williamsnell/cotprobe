Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about government budgets and economic conditions. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about what happens to the federal government's budget during different economic states. Specifically, it's given as "For a given level of government spending, the federal government usually experiences a budget____during economic____and a budget ______during economic_______."

I remember from my economics classes that the government's budget can either be in surplus or deficit, and this relates to the state of the economy. So I think when the economy is doing well, the government might have a surplus, and when it's not, a deficit. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact relationship.

Let me break it down. During economic expansion, which is like a boom period, people have jobs, incomes are up. So the government collects more taxes because people are earning more. At the same time, spending on social programs like unemployment might decrease because fewer people are unemployed. So higher revenues and lower spending would lead to a budget surplus. So the first blank would be surplus during expansion.

Now, during a recession, the opposite happens. The economy isn't doing well, unemployment is high. So people earn less, so tax revenues go down. Plus, the government might spend more on social programs to support those who are unemployed. That increased spending and lower revenue would create a budget deficit. So the second part would be deficit during recession.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question says "for a given level of government spending." Oh, that's an important point. So government spending is fixed; it's not changing. So the only variable is the tax revenue. So during expansion, tax revenues go up because incomes are higher, so even if spending is fixed, higher revenues mean a surplus. During a recession, revenues drop because people are earning less, so with spending fixed, the government would run a deficit.

So putting it all together: the first blanks are surplus and expansion, the second are deficit and recession.

Looking at the options:

Option C: surplus expansion deficit recession â€” that's exactly what I thought. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are given as A to J. Let me read the choices again.

Option C says: surplus expansion deficit recession. So the sentence would be: budget surplus during economic expansion and budget deficit during economic recession. Yes, that's correct.

Other options don't fit. For example, option F is deficit recession surplus expansion, which reverses the two. Option I is deficit expansion surplus recession, which doesn't make sense because expansion should lead to surplus. So option C is the right choice.

The correct answer is based on understanding the relationship between economic conditions and government budgets. During economic expansion, tax revenues increase due to higher incomes, leading to a budget surplus, assuming government spending remains constant. Conversely, during a recession, tax revenues decrease while spending on social programs may increase, resulting in a budget deficit. Thus, the federal government experiences a surplus during expansion and a deficit during recession.

The correct option is **C: surplus expansion deficit recession**.

Answer: C
