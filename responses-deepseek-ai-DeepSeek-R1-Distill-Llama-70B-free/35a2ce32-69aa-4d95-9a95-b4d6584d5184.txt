Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with colligative properties, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says that the molal freezing point constant (Kf) for a certain liquid is 0.500°C. Then, 26.4 grams of a solute is dissolved in 250 grams of this liquid. The solution's freezing point is 0.125°C below the pure liquid's freezing point. I need to find the molecular weight of the solute.

Hmm, right, so I remember that the freezing point depression (ΔTf) is calculated using the formula ΔTf = Kf * m, where m is the molality of the solution. Molality is moles of solute divided by kilograms of solvent.

Wait, so I think I can rearrange this formula to solve for molality. Since I know ΔTf is 0.125°C and Kf is 0.500°C·kg/mol, I can find m.

Let me plug those numbers in. So m = ΔTf / Kf. That would be 0.125 / 0.500. Let me calculate that: 0.125 divided by 0.5 is 0.25. So the molality is 0.25 mol/kg.

Wait, wait, molality is moles per kilogram of solvent. So 0.25 moles in 1 kg, which is 1000 grams. But in this problem, the solvent is 250 grams, right? So I can find the moles of solute in 250 grams of solvent.

So moles = m * kg of solvent. The solvent is 250 grams, which is 0.250 kg. So 0.25 mol/kg * 0.250 kg = 0.0625 moles.

Wait, wait a second. No, wait. Because m is moles per kg, so if I have 0.250 kg, then the moles would be 0.25 * 0.250 = 0.0625 moles. That makes sense.

But wait, no! Wait, molality is moles per kg of solvent. So if m is 0.25, that means 0.25 moles are in 1 kg of solvent. But here, the solvent mass is 250 g, which is 0.25 kg. So the moles present would be 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 moles. Got it.

Now, I have 26.4 grams of solute, and that's 0.0625 moles. To find the molecular weight (M), I can use the formula: moles = mass / M. So rearranging, M = mass / moles.

Plugging in the numbers: M = 26.4 g / 0.0625 mol. Let me calculate that. 26.4 divided by 0.0625. Hmm, 0.0625 is 1/16, so dividing by 1/16 is the same as multiplying by 16. So 26.4 * 16.

Let me do that multiplication. 26 * 16 is 416, and 0.4 *16 is 6.4. So total is 416 +6.4 = 422.4. So M is 422.4 g/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 422.4 g. But wait, the options are labeled from A to J, so the answer must be A. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

So ΔTf is 0.125, Kf is 0.5. So m = 0.125 / 0.5 = 0.25 mol/kg. Then, moles of solute is m * kg of solvent: 0.25 * 0.25 kg = 0.0625 mol. Mass of solute is 26.4 g, so M = 26.4 / 0.0625 = 422.4 g/mol. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \(\Delta T_f = 0.125^\circ \text{C}\) (freezing point depression),
- \(K_f = 0.500^\circ \text{C·kg/mol}\) (molal freezing point constant),
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f} = \frac{0.125}{0.500} = 0.25 \, \text{mol/kg}.
\]

Next, we calculate the number of moles of solute. Molality is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The mass of the solvent is 250 g, which is equivalent to 0.250 kg. Thus:

\[
\text{moles of solute} = m \cdot \text{kg of solvent} = 0.25 \cdot 0.250 = 0.0625 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The mass of the solute is given as 26.4 g. To find the molecular weight (\(M\)), we use the relationship:

\[
M = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{moles of solute}} = \frac{26.4}{0.0625} = 422.4 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Thus, the molecular weight of the solute is 422.4 g/mol, which corresponds to option **A**.
