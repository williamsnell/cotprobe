Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the steady-state solution of a difference equation. The equation is y[n] + (1/√3) y[n-1] = cos(π/6 n). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that for linear difference equations like this, especially second-order ones, the steady-state solution usually involves finding the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. Oh wait, wait, no, this equation looks like a first-order difference equation because it's y[n] and y[n-1]. So maybe it's a first-order linear recurrence.

The general approach for such equations is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The steady-state would be the particular solution because, for first-order, the homogeneous solution typically dies out if the system is stable.

So the homogeneous equation here is y[n] + (1/√3) y[n-1] = 0. Let me rewrite that: y[n] = - (1/√3) y[n-1]. The characteristic equation for this would be r = -1/√3. The magnitude is 1/√3, which is less than 1, so the homogeneous solution will decay to zero as n increases. That means the steady-state is just the particular solution.

Now, the nonhomogeneous term is cos(π/6 n). So I need to find a particular solution for this. Since the input is a cosine function, I'll assume a particular solution of the form y_p[n] = A cos(π/6 n + φ), where A is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.

Let me plug y_p[n] into the original equation:

y_p[n] + (1/√3) y_p[n-1] = cos(π/6 n)

Substituting y_p[n] = A cos(π/6 n + φ), then y_p[n-1] = A cos(π/6 (n-1) + φ) = A cos(π/6 n - π/6 + φ).

So plugging in:

A cos(π/6 n + φ) + (1/√3) A cos(π/6 n - π/6 + φ) = cos(π/6 n)

Hmm, I can expand these cosines using trigonometric identities. Let me use the identity cos(a + b) = cos a cos b - sin a sin b. Wait, no, wait. Wait, another approach: express the sum as a single cosine function.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent both terms in terms of cos(π/6 n) and sin(π/6 n) and then equate coefficients.

Let me write each term:

First term: A cos(π/6 n + φ) = A [cos(π/6 n) cos φ - sin(π/6 n) sin φ]

Second term: (1/√3) A cos(π/6 n - π/6 + φ) = (A/√3) [cos(π/6 n) cos(-π/6 + φ) - sin(π/6 n) sin(-π/6 + φ) ]

Wait, cos is even, so cos(-x) = cos x, and sin is odd, so sin(-x) = -sin x. So cos(-π/6 + φ) = cos(π/6 - φ), and sin(-π/6 + φ) = -sin(π/6 - φ).

So putting it all together, the second term becomes:

(A/√3)[ cos(π/6 n) cos(π/6 - φ) + sin(π/6 n) sin(π/6 - φ) ]

Wait, no, because the expansion is [cos(π/6 n) cos(π/6 - φ) - sin(π/6 n) (-sin(π/6 - φ)) ] ?

Wait, I think I made a miscalculation there. Let me redo that part.

The second term is (1/√3) A cos(π/6 (n) - π/6 + φ). Let me write the argument as π/6 n + (φ - π/6).

So, expanding that:

cos(π/6 n + (φ - π/6)) = cos(π/6 n) cos(φ - π/6) - sin(π/6 n) sin(φ - π/6).

So when I multiply by (1/√3) A, it becomes:

( A / √3 ) [ cos(π/6 n) cos(φ - π/6) - sin(π/6 n) sin(φ - π/6) ) ]

Now, combining the two terms:

First term: A [ cos(π/6 n) cos φ - sin(π/6 n) sin φ ]

Second term: (A/√3) [ cos(π/6 n) cos(φ - π/6) - sin(π/6 n) sin(φ - π/6) ) ]

Adding them together:

Total = [A cos φ + (A/√3) cos(φ - π/6)] cos(π/6 n) 

+ [ - A sin φ - (A/√3) sin(φ - π/6) ) ] sin(π/6 n )

This total should equal cos(π/6 n), which is 1 * cos(π/6 n) + 0 * sin(π/6 n).

So we can set up equations for the coefficients:

1. Coefficient of cos(π/6 n):

A cos φ + (A/√3) cos(φ - π/6) = 1

2. Coefficient of sin(π/6 n):

- A sin φ - (A/√3) sin(φ - π/6) = 0

Hmm, so we have two equations:

Equation (1): A [ cos φ + (1/√3) cos(φ - π/6) ] = 1

Equation (2): A [ - sin φ - (1/√3) sin(φ - π/6) ] = 0

Let me try to solve equation (2) first.

Equation (2) implies that:

- sin φ - (1/√3) sin(φ - π/6) = 0

Let me write this as:

sin φ + (1/√3) sin(φ - π/6) = 0

Hmm, expand sin(φ - π/6): sin φ cos(π/6) - cos φ sin(π/6)

Which is sin φ (√3/2) - cos φ (1/2)

So equation (2) becomes:

sin φ + (1/√3) [ (√3/2) sin φ - (1/2) cos φ ) ] = 0

Simplify:

sin φ + [ (1/√3)(√3/2 sin φ) ) ] - [ (1/√3)(1/2 cos φ) ) ] = 0

Simplify each term:

(1/√3)(√3/2 sin φ) = (1/2) sin φ

(1/√3)(1/2 cos φ) = (1/(2√3)) cos φ

So equation (2) becomes:

sin φ + (1/2) sin φ - (1/(2√3)) cos φ = 0

Combine like terms:

(3/2) sin φ - (1/(2√3)) cos φ = 0

Multiply both sides by 2√3 to eliminate denominators:

3√3 sin φ - cos φ = 0

So:

3√3 sin φ = cos φ

Divide both sides by cos φ (assuming cos φ ≠ 0):

3√3 tan φ = 1

So tan φ = 1/(3√3) = 1/(3√3) = √3/(9) *Wait, no: 1/(3√3) is the same as (√3)/9? Wait, 3√3 is 3 times √3, so 1/(3√3) is (√3)/(3*3) )= √3/9.

Wait, no, alternatively, rationalizing the denominator:

1/(3√3) = √3/(3*3) )= √3/9.

So tan φ = √3/9, which can be written as 1/(3√3).

So φ = arctan(√3/9) = arctan(1/(3√3)).

Hmm, okay, now moving to equation (1):

A [ cos φ + (1/√3) cos(φ - π/6) ] = 1

Let me compute cos(φ - π/6) using the same expansion as before.

cos(φ - π/6) = cos φ cos(π/6) + sin φ sin(π/6)

Which is cos φ (√3/2) + sin φ (1/2)

So equation (1) becomes:

A [ cos φ + (1/√3)( (√3/2 cos φ) + (1/2) sin φ ) ) ] = 1

Simplify inside the brackets:

cos φ + (1/√3)( (√3/2 cos φ) + (1/2 sin φ) )

The term (1/√3)(√3/2 cos φ) is (1/2) cos φ.

Similarly, (1/√3)(1/2 sin φ) is (1/(2√3)) sin φ.

So the entire expression inside the brackets is:

cos φ + (1/2 cos φ) + (1/(2√3)) sin φ

Which is (3/2 cos φ) + (1/(2√3)) sin φ

So equation (1):

A [ (3/2) cos φ + (1/(2√3)) sin φ ] = 1

But from equation (2), we found that 3√3 sin φ = cos φ. So cos φ = 3√3 sin φ.

Let me substitute cos φ in terms of sin φ.

So cos φ = 3√3 sin φ

Then, let's substitute into equation (1):

A [ (3/2)(3√3 sin φ) + (1/(2√3)) sin φ ] = 1

Simplify each term:

(3/2)(3√3 sin φ) = (9√3 / 2) sin φ

(1/(2√3)) sin φ = (1/(2√3)) sin φ

Adding them together:

(9√3 / 2 + 1/(2√3)) sin φ

Combine the terms. To add them, find a common denominator, which would be 2√3.

So 9√3 / 2 = (9√3 * √3) / (2√3) ) = (9*3) / (2√3) )= 27/(2√3)

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Let me see: if I have 9√3 / 2, and I want to write it as (something)/(2√3), I can multiply numerator and denominator by √3:

(9√3 * √3) / (2 * √3) ) = (9*3) / (2√3) ) = 27/(2√3)

Similarly, the other term is 1/(2√3).

So adding them gives (27 + 1) / (2√3) ) = 28/(2√3) = 14/√3.

So equation (1) becomes:

A * (14/√3) sin φ = 1

So A = (√3) / (14 sin φ )

But from equation (2), we have tan φ = 1/(3√3), so sin φ = 1 / sqrt(1 + (3√3)^2 ) because tan φ = opposite/adjacent = 1/(3√3), so the hypotenuse is sqrt(1^2 + (3√3)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 27 )= sqrt(28)= 2√7.

So sin φ = opposite/hypotenuse = 1 / (2√7 )

Wait, wait, let me make sure. If tan φ = 1/(3√3), then the right triangle has opposite side 1, adjacent 3√3, hypotenuse sqrt(1 + (3√3)^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 27) = sqrt(28) = 2√7.

So sin φ = 1/(2√7 )

So substituting back into A:

A = (√3) / (14 * (1/(2√7)) ) )

Simplify denominator: 14 * (1/(2√7)) )= 7/√7 = √7.

Wait, 14 * 1/(2√7) = (14)/(2√7) )=7/√7 = √7.

So A = √3 / √7 = sqrt(3/7).

Wait, because √3 divided by √7 is sqrt(3/7).

So A = sqrt(3/7).

And the phase φ is arctan(1/(3√3)).

So putting it all together, the particular solution is:

y_p[n] = sqrt(3/7) cos( π/6 n + φ ), where φ = arctan(1/(3√3)).

But wait, in the equation, the particular solution is of the form A cos(π/6 n + φ), but when I plug in, I get the equation involving cos and sin terms. However, in the options, some are using cos with a phase shift, others have sin, or cos with a different argument.

Looking at the options, let me see:

Option G says y_ss[n] = sqrt(3/7) cos( (pi/6) n * tan^{-1} [1/(3 sqrt(3)) ] )

Wait, no, the phase is the argument inside the cos. Wait, no, the options have the phase as a shift. Let me look again.

Wait no, the options have the phase as a factor in the argument of the cosine or sine. For example, option G is sqrt(3/7) cos[ (pi/6) n + tan^{-1}(1/(3 sqrt(3))) ]

Wait, no, let me read option G correctly:

"G: y_ss[n] = sqrt(3/7) cos[(π/6)n tan^{-1}[1/(3√3)] ]"

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the argument of the cos would be (pi/6 n) multiplied by the arctangent. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are presented as LaTeX. Let me parse them correctly.

Option G: y_ss[n] = \surd(3/7)cos[(\pi/6)n tan^{-1}[{1} / {3\surd(3)}]

Wait, that's written as cos[ (pi/6 n) multiplied by arctangent term ], which would be (pi/6 n) * (1/(3√3))^{-1} ?

Wait, no, the LaTeX is cos[(\pi/6 n) tan^{-1}[1/(3√3)]]. That would mean the argument is (pi/6 n) times the arctangent of [1/(3√3)].

But that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Phase should be in radians, but (pi/6 n) is in radians times n, which would be a scaling of n. Wait, but that's not how phase shifts work. The phase shift is usually a constant in radians, not multiplied by n.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the options are written. Let me look again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the argument is (pi/6 n) plus the arctangent term, but written as a single argument. Like cos( (pi/6 n) + phi ), where phi is arctan(...).

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different notation. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option G: sqrt(3/7) cos[ (pi/6 n) tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

Wait, that would mean the argument is (pi/6 n) multiplied by the arctangent value. That doesn't make sense because the argument should be in terms of (wn + phi), where w is the frequency and phi is the phase shift. So perhaps the correct form is cos( (pi/6) n + phi ), where phi is the arctangent term.

Looking through the options:

Option A: cos[ (pi/6 n) tan^{-1}(1/(2√3)) ] — same issue.

Option B: sin[ (pi/6 n) + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ]

No, wait, option B is written as sin[ (pi/6 n) + tan^{-1}(1/(3√3)) ].

Wait, but the way the options are written in LaTeX, for example:

Option B: \surd(2/7)sin[(\pi/6)n + tan^{-1}[{1} / {3\surd(3)}]

So it's sin( (pi/6 n) + arctan(1/(3√3)) ), which is correct.

Similarly, option C: cos[ (pi/6 n) + arctan(...) ]

Option G: cos[ (pi/6 n) * arctan(...) ].

Wait, no, looking back, option G is written as:

\surd(3/7)cos[(\pi/6)n tan^{-1}[{1} / {3\surd(3)}]

Which would be (pi/6 n) multiplied by the arctangent. That can't be correct because, as I said, the phase should be a constant, not multiplied by n.

Wait, perhaps all the options have a typo, and the phase is added, not multiplied. Because otherwise, none of the options make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a different notation where (pi/6 n) is the frequency, and the phase is a separate term.

Wait, but in our solution, the particular solution is y_p[n] = A cos( (pi/6) n + phi ), where phi is arctan(1/(3√3)).

So looking for an option where the argument is (pi/6 n) plus arctan(1/(3√3)), and the amplitude is sqrt(3/7).

Looking through the options:

Option G: amplitude sqrt(3/7), cosine function, argument is (pi/6 n) multiplied by arctan(...). No, that's not correct.

Option I: amplitude sqrt(3/7), cosine, argument is (pi/6 n) plus arctan(...). Yes! Let me check option I.

Option I: y_ss[n]
