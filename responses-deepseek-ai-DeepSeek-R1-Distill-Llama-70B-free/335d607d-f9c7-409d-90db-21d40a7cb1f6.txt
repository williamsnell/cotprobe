Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the percentage increase in Victoria's population. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

First, I read that the current population is approximately 42,600, and ten years ago it was about 30,000. I need to find the percent increase over those ten years. 

Hmm, percentage increase. I think the formula for that is ((New Value - Original Value)/Original Value) * 100%. Yeah, that sounds right. So the original value here is the old population, which is 30,000, and the new value is 42,600.

Let me plug in the numbers. New minus original is 42,600 minus 30,000. That gives me 12,600. Then I divide that by the original value, so 12,600 divided by 30,000. 

Wait, let me do that division. 12,600 divided by 30,000. Hmm, 30,000 goes into 12,600... Well, 30,000 times 0.4 is 12,000, and 0.42 would be 12,600. Oh right, because 30,000 * 0.42 equals 12,600. So 12,600 divided by 30,000 is 0.42. 

Then I multiply by 100% to get the percentage. 0.42 times 100 is 42%. So the percent increase is 42%. 

Looking at the options, option I is 42%. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check my math to be sure. 

Original population: 30,000. Increase is 12,600. 12,600 divided by 30,000 equals 0.42, which is 42%. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be I.

The percent increase in Victoria's population is calculated using the formula ((New Value - Original Value)/Original Value) * 100%. 

- New Value = 42,600
- Original Value = 30,000
- Increase = 42,600 - 30,000 = 12,600
- Percentage Increase = (12,600 / 30,000) * 100% = 42%

The correct answer is I: 42%.
