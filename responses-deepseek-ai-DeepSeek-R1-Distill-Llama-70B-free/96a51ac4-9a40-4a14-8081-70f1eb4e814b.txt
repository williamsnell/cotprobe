Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking how many positive integers are factors of both 120 and 40. Hmm, I think that's about finding common factors, right? So maybe I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 120 and 40 first, and then count the number of factors of that GCD.

Wait, yeah, the number of common factors of two numbers is the same as the number of factors of their GCD. So that makes sense. So first step, find the GCD of 120 and 40.

How do I find the GCD? Well, one way is to list the factors of each and find the highest common one. But 40 is a factor of 120 because 40 times 3 is 120. Oh wait, so does that mean that the GCD is 40? Because 40 divides 120 exactly.

Yes, that's right. So GCD(120,40) is 40. Now I need to find how many positive integers are factors of 40.

To find the number of factors, I should prime factorize 40 first. Let's see, 40 breaks down into 2^3 * 5^1 because 2*2*2 is 8, and 5 is 5, and 8*5 is 40.

The formula for the number of factors is to take the exponents of the prime factors, add one to each, and multiply them together. So here, the exponents are 3 and 1. Adding one to each gives 4 and 2. Multiplying 4*2 equals 8. So 40 has 8 factors.

Wait, but let me double-check that. The factors of 40 would be 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40. That's 8 factors, right? Yep, that matches the calculation.

So the number of positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40 is 8. Looking back at the options, option D is 8. So the answer must be D.

To determine how many positive integers are factors of both 120 and 40, we first find their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since 40 is a factor of 120, the GCD of 120 and 40 is 40. 

Next, we calculate the number of factors of 40. The prime factorization of 40 is \( 2^3 \times 5^1 \). Using the formula for the number of factors, we add 1 to each exponent and multiply the results: \( (3+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 2 = 8 \). Thus, 40 has 8 factors.

The positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40 are the same as the factors of 40, which are 8 in total. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
