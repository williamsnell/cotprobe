Okay, so I have this question here about a biochemical process, and I need to figure out which one it is based on the products. The products are NADP+, ADP, and sugar. Hmm, let me think about what each of these processes does.

First, I'll list out the options: A through J, each a different process. The products mentioned are NADP+, ADP, and sugar. Wait, I remember that NADP+ is a coenzyme used in anabolic reactions, like the Calvin cycle, which is part of photosynthesis. ADP is related to energy transfer; when it gets phosphorylated, it becomes ATP. Sugar as a product... I think the Calvin cycle produces glucose.

So, thinking about each option:

A: Oxidative phosphorylation. That's in the mitochondria, produces a lot of ATP. Its products are ATP, water, and NAD+ or FAD. Doesn't produce sugar, so probably not.

B: Glycolysis. This breaks down glucose into pyruvate, generating a little ATP and NADH. It doesn't produce sugar, so not B.

C: Beta oxidation. That's the breakdown of fatty acids. Produces acetyl-CoA, NADH, FADH2. No sugar involved.

D: Chemiosmosis. This process is about using proton gradients to make ATP. It uses ADP and Pi to make ATP. So the product here would be ATP along with water. Doesn't produce sugar.

E: Light-dependent reactions. These happen in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. They produce ATP, NADPH, and oxygen. Wait, NADPH is similar to NADP+ when it's oxidized, right? Because NADP+ is the oxidized form, and NADPH is the reduced form. So the product here is NADPH, not NADP+. So maybe not the right fit.

Wait, the question says the products are NADP+... So that's the oxidized form. So maybe E is not it because E produces NADPH.

F: Pyruvate oxidation. This converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, producing NADH and CO2. No sugar here.

G: Fermentation. This process can produce various products like alcohol or lactic acid, but no sugar. Also, it produces ATP and NAD+.

H: Calvin cycle. This is the dark reaction in photosynthesis. It uses ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 into glucose. Wait, but the products would be sugar (like glucose), ADP (from using ATP), and NADP+ (since NADPH is oxidized back to NADP+ after donating electrons). So yes, the Calvin cycle produces NADP+, ADP, and sugar.

I: Krebs cycle. This produces CO2, NADH, FADH2, and ATP. No sugar involved.

J: Anaerobic respiration. This is like fermentation, producing some ATP, NADH maybe, but no sugar as a product.

So putting it all together, the process that produces NADP+, ADP, and sugar is the Calvin cycle, which is option H. The Calvin cycle takes in CO2 and uses ATP and NADPH to produce glucose and recycle the ADP and NADP+ for the light-dependent reactions to use again.

Wait, but in the Calvin cycle, the products are sugar (like glucose) and the byproducts are ADP and NADP+. Because the cycle consumes ATP and NADPH, converting them into ADP, NADP+, and produces sugar. So the products listed in the question are exactly those.

The question asks which biochemical process has NADP+, ADP, and sugar as its products. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options:

- **A: Oxidative phosphorylation** produces ATP, water, and NADH/FADH2, but no sugar.  
- **B: Glycolysis** breaks down glucose into pyruvate, generating ATP and NADH, but it does not produce sugar.  
- **C: Beta oxidation** involves the breakdown of fatty acids, producing acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2, without any sugar.  
- **D: Chemiosmosis** generates ATP from ADP and Pi using proton gradients, but it does not produce sugar.  
- **E: Light-dependent reactions** produce ATP, NADPH, and oxygen. While NADPH is related to NADP+, this process does not produce sugar.  
- **F: Pyruvate oxidation** converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, producing NADH and CO2, but no sugar.  
- **G: Fermentation** produces ATP, NAD+, and various end products like alcohol or lactic acid, but no sugar.  
- **H: Calvin cycle** is the dark reaction in photosynthesis, where CO2 is fixed into glucose using ATP and NADPH. The products are sugar (e.g., glucose), ADP, and NADP+ (as NADPH is oxidized back to NADP+).  
- **I: Krebs cycle** produces CO2, NADH, FADH2, and ATP, but no sugar.  
- **J: Anaerobic respiration** is similar to fermentation and does not produce sugar.  

The Calvin cycle (H) is the only process that matches the given products: NADP+, ADP, and sugar. It uses ATP and NADPH to synthesize glucose, recycling ADP and NADP+ in the process.

Answer: H
