Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The function f(x) is equal to 2 for all real numbers x. And the question is asking, what is the value of f(x + 2)?

Hmm, alright. So f(x) is a constant function because no matter what x is, the output is always 2. I remember that a constant function doesn't change based on the input. So whether x is 0, 5, -3, or anything else, f(x) is just 2.

So now, the function is evaluated at x + 2. Wait, so f(x + 2) means I plug in x + 2 into the function f. But f doesn't care what its input is; it always returns 2. Because f is defined as f(anything) = 2.

Let me think of an example. Suppose I have f(a) = 2, where a can be any real number. Then f(5) is 2, f(-3) is 2, f(Ï€) is 2, and so on. So in this case, a is x + 2. So f(x + 2) is 2. Oh, right, because the function f ignores its input and just gives 2 every time.

So looking at the options, option I is 2. That must be the correct answer. Let me just double-check. The options are A through J. Option I says 2, which matches what I thought.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The function doesn't depend on x at all. So even if I change the input from x to x + 2, the output remains the same. So yes, f(x + 2) is 2.

The function \( f(x) = 2 \) is a constant function, meaning it always returns 2 regardless of the input. When evaluating \( f(x + 2) \), the input becomes \( x + 2 \), but since \( f \) does not depend on its input, the result is still 2. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

I: 2

Answer: I
