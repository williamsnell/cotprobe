Question:

A purchaser orally agreed with the seller to buy seller's house for $100,000. The purchaser gave the seller a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the check served as a form of acceptance of the offer.
B: Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.
C: Yes, because the seller cannot revoke an offer once a down payment has been made.
D: No, because the oral agreement was not legally binding without the seller's signature on the offer form.
E: No, because the offer was not accepted  prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.
F: Yes, because the written offer and check constituted a legally binding contract.
G: Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.
H: No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.
I: No, because the seller had not yet cashed the check, indicating no formal acceptance of the offer.
J: No, because the post-dated check does not constitute a legally binding agreement.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with real estate transactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is: A purchaser orally agreed with a seller to buy the seller's house for $100,000. The purchaser then gave the seller a written offer along with a post-dated check for 5% of the price. But before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, the seller got another offer for the full asking price of $120,000. The seller called the purchaser and called off the deal. Now the purchaser is suing for specific performance, arguing that there was an enforceable agreement based on the oral understanding, written offer, and the check.

The question is whether the purchaser will likely prevail.

Hmm, I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. In real estate, typically the contract needs to be in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. So the Statute of Frauds requires that contracts for the sale of land be in writing and signed by the party to be charged.

In this case, the purchaser gave a written offer, but the seller didn't sign it yet. They only had an oral agreement. So the written offer was made by the purchaser, but without the seller's acceptance (like signing), it's not a valid contract yet.

Wait, but the purchaser also gave a post-dated check for 5% of the price. That sounds like earnest money. I think in some cases, when a buyer gives consideration, like a deposit, it can make the offer irrevocable for a certain period. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

So the options are A through J. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Yes, because the check served as a form of acceptance. Wait, no. The check is from the purchaser, so that's consideration, not acceptance. The seller's acceptance would be signing the offer or maybe cashing the check. But the seller didn't deposit the check, so probably not.

Option B: Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check was consideration. But again, the Statute of Frauds requires a writing for real estate contracts. So even if there's consideration, without the written agreement signed by both parties, it's not enforceable. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Yes, because the seller can't revoke after a down payment. I think this relates to the concept that once consideration is given, the offer can't be revoked. But I'm not sure if that applies here. Because the offer was revocable until accepted. Unless the consideration makes it an option contract, which would require separate consideration. A deposit might act as consideration for an option, making the offer irrevocable for a time. But the question is whether that applies here. Also, the Statute of Frauds might still require a written contract.

Option D: No, because the oral agreement isn't legally binding without the seller's signature. That makes sense because of the Statute of Frauds. Without the written signed agreement, there's no enforceable contract.

Option E: No, because the offer wasn't accepted before the seller sold to someone else. That sounds right. The seller can accept another offer until they accept the first one. So if the seller hasn't accepted (signed the offer or perhaps deposited the check), they're free to accept another offer.

Option F: Yes, because the written offer and check made a contract. But the seller didn't accept the written offer, so no.

Option G: Yes, because there was a meeting of the minds. But again, without the written agreement signed by the seller, it's not enforceable under the Statute of Frauds.

Option H: No, because specific performance doesn't apply in residential transactions. I don't think that's correct. Specific performance is often used in real estate because each piece of land is unique.

Option I: No, because the seller didn't cash the check. So perhaps the check wasn't accepted, meaning no consideration. But the check was given, so maybe it's consideration regardless. Not sure.

Option J: No, because the post-dated check doesn't bind. Maybe because it's not cashed, but I'm not certain.

So the key points are: Was there an enforceable contract? The Statute of Frauds requires a writing signed by the seller. The seller didn't sign the offer. So the oral agreement alone isn't enough. The written offer wasn't accepted yet.

Under the Statute of Frauds, the contract must be in writing and signed. So even if there was an oral understanding, without the written acceptance, there's no contract. The post-dated check might be seen as consideration, but that doesn't negate the requirement for a written agreement.

So the correct answer would be either D or E or I or J.

Option D says no because the oral agreement isn't binding without the seller's signature. That's correct because of the Statute of Frauds.

Option E says no because the offer wasn't accepted before the seller sold to another. That also makes sense because until acceptance, the offer can be revoked.

Wait, but in the scenario, the seller received another offer and called off the deal. That's a revocation of the offer. But once an offer is revoked, it can't be accepted anymore. So if the purchaser tried to accept after revocation, it's too late.

So in this case, the offer was revoked before the purchaser could accept. Wait, but the offer was already made. The seller's calling off would be a revocation. But the written offer was made by the purchaser; the seller hadn't accepted it yet. So the seller can revoke the offer before acceptance.

Wait, no. Wait, in this case, was the written offer from the purchaser or the seller? The purchaser gave a written offer, so the seller is the offeree. So the seller can revoke the offer at any time before acceptance.

So the purchaser's argument is that there was already an enforceable agreement, but without the seller's acceptance, there wasn't. So the seller could revoke.

So the correct answer is E: No, because the offer wasn't accepted before the seller had the right to sell to someone else.

Wait, but option D is about the oral agreement not being binding. So which is it?

The issue is whether the oral agreement plus the written offer and check create an enforceable contract. But the Statute of Frauds says that a contract for the sale of land must be in writing and signed. So without the seller's signature, it's unenforceable.

So the correct answer would be D: No, because the oral agreement was not legally binding without the seller's signature.

Alternatively, E is about the offer not being accepted yet, which is also correct. Because without acceptance, the seller can revoke.

So which applies here? Both D and E seem correct, but the question is about whether the purchaser can enforce specific performance based on an existing contract.

If there's no contract because the Statute of Frauds wasn't satisfied (no written agreement signed by seller), then D applies. If there was a contract, but the seller revoked before acceptance, then E applies.

Wait, but in this case, was the written offer by the purchaser sufficient? The seller didn't sign it, so it's not a written contract. So the contract isn't enforceable, so specific performance isn't available. So D is the reason.

Alternatively, the offer was made, but the seller revoked it before the purchaser could accept. So E is about the offer not being accepted yet.

But the purchaser is suing based on an oral understanding plus the written offer and the check. So they're arguing that there was already a contract, not just an offer.

So the issue is whether the written offer and the check, along with the oral agreement, form a contract. But without the seller's signature, the written offer isn't a contract. So D would be the correct reason.

Wait, but the written offer was given by the purchaser. So when the seller receives it, they can accept it. But until they do, it's just an offer.

So the oral agreement is not enough because of the Statute of Frauds. The written offer wasn't accepted yet, so no contract.

So the correct answer is D: No, because the oral agreement was not legally binding without the seller's signature.

But wait, another angle: The check as consideration. If the check is seen as consideration for the option to purchase, making the offer irrevocable. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

In some jurisdictions, parting with consideration (like a deposit) can make an offer irrevocable, creating an option contract. But in this case, the offer was revoked before the seller accepted, but after the consideration was given. So if the consideration creates an option, then the seller can't revoke. But that would require that the consideration was for the option, which might be the case.

But even if that's true, the Statute of Frauds would still require a written agreement signed by the seller for the sale of land. So even if the offer is irrevocable, without the written contract, there's no enforceable sale contract.

So the purchaser can't get specific performance because there's no enforceable contract. So D would still be correct.

So I think the answer is D.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the purchaser can enforce specific performance based on an oral understanding, a written offer, and a post-dated check for 5% of the purchase price in a real estate transaction. For a contract to be enforceable, it must meet the requirements of offer, acceptance, and consideration, and in the case of real estate, it must also satisfy the Statute of Frauds, which mandates a written agreement signed by the party to be charged (the seller in this case).

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The check serves as consideration, not acceptance. Acceptance would require the seller to sign the written offer or take action like depositing the check, which did not occur.

- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the check may constitute consideration, the Statute of Frauds requires a written agreement signed by the seller for real estate contracts. Without the seller's signature, the oral agreement and consideration alone are insufficient to create an enforceable contract.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. The seller can revoke the offer unless it is made irrevocable through consideration (e.g., an option contract). However, even if the check acted as consideration for an option, the Statute of Frauds would still require a written contract signed by the seller for specific performance.

- **Option D**: Correct. The oral agreement is not legally binding without the seller's signature on the written offer, as required by the Statute of Frauds. Without a signed written agreement, there is no enforceable contract, and specific performance cannot be granted.

- **Option E**: Plausible but secondary. While it is true that the seller can revoke an offer before acceptance, the primary issue here is the lack of a written contract signed by the seller, making D the more precise answer.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. The written offer and check do not constitute a legally binding contract because the seller did not sign the written offer, violating the Statute of Frauds.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. A "meeting of the minds" alone is insufficient for an enforceable contract in real estate without a written agreement signed by the seller.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. Specific performance is applicable in residential real estate transactions, so this option is factually inaccurate.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The seller's failure to cash the check does not negate the fact that the check could serve as consideration. The key issue remains the lack of a written contract signed by the seller.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. A post-dated check can constitute consideration, but the enforceability of the contract still depends on the Statute of Frauds, which requires a written agreement signed by the seller.

The critical issue is that the Statute of Frauds requires a written agreement signed by the seller for real estate contracts. Since the seller did not sign the written offer, there is no enforceable contract, and the purchaser cannot prevail in a claim for specific performance.
