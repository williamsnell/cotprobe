Okay, I'm trying to figure out what an outlier is. I remember from my statistics class that an outlier is a data point that's really different from the others. Let me think about each option.

Option A says it's the mode. The mode is the most common value, so that can't be an outlier. Outliers are rare, not frequent.

Option B is the mean. The mean is the average, but an outlier isn't necessarily the mean. Plus, the mean can be influenced by outliers, but that doesn't make it one.

Option C says it's seen more frequently. No, that's the opposite. Outliers are less frequent, so this isn't right.

Option D claims it's always larger. Well, an outlier could be smaller too, not just larger. So D is too specific.

Option E is always smaller, but same problem as D. Outliers can be on either end.

Option F says it's seen less frequently. That makes sense because outliers don't occur often, but the question is about how they differ, not just frequency. Maybe, but let's keep going.

Option G says it's significantly different. That sounds right because outliers are way outside the main data cluster.

Option H suggests it's an error. Sometimes outliers are errors, but not always. They can be legitimate data points that are just unusual.

Option I is the median. The median is the middle value, which wouldn't be an outlier.

Option J says it's exactly the same as others. That's the opposite of an outlier.

So putting it together, the best answer is G. Outliers are significantly different from other observations.

G: is significantly different from the other observations in the data set

Answer: G
