Question:

A wedding planner owned a summer cottage on the lake. In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, which is located on a knoll above the lake, the wedding planner entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notif'ing the neighbor, the wedding planner proceeded with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the wedding planner sold his lakefront property to an artist. Shortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the artist's property. The interest that the wedding planner acquired in the access road may best be described as

Options:

A: an easement by estoppel.
B: an easement of light and air.
C: a prescriptive easement.
D: an express easement.
E: a profit a prendre.
F: an easement by necessity.
G: an easement implied by prior use.
H: a license.
I: an easement of support.
J: an easement in gross.

Okay, so I have this question about easements in property law. I'm a bit rusty on my easement types, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is about a wedding planner who owns a summer cottage and wants easier access to it. The cottage is on a knoll above a lake, so access must be a bit tricky. To solve this, the wedding planner makes an agreement with a neighboring landowner. The neighbor grants, in writing, a right-of-way over a specific strip of land—30 feet wide and a quarter mile long along the eastern edge of the neighbor's property.

So, the key here is that the right-of-way was granted in writing. I remember that easements can be created in several ways: by express grant, implication, necessity, estoppel, etc. Since this was a written agreement, that points towards an express easement.

But wait, let me make sure. The other details: the wedding planner then improved the road by asphalting it without notifying the neighbor. Years later, the neighbor starts a sand business and the heavy hauling ruins the asphalt. Then, ten years after that, the wedding planner sells the property to an artist. The neighbor then blocks the road with barriers.

So the question is about the type of interest the wedding planner acquired. The main issue is the creation of the easement.

An easement by estoppel would arise when someone is induced by the behavior of the landowner to believe they have an easement, and they rely on that to their detriment. But here, it's a written agreement, so estoppel doesn't seem to apply.

A prescriptive easement is acquired through open, continuous, and adverse use for a certain period. But in this case, the use was permissive because there was an agreement, so prescription isn't it.

Easement by necessity usually comes into play when a landowner sells a part of the land that's landlocked. It's based on necessity. But here, the neighbor is a separate person, not a seller of adjacent land, so that's probably not it.

Easement implied by prior use happens when, at the time of a conveyance, the grantor and grantee intend an easement based on prior existing use. But again, the written agreement is the key here, so implication isn't the right category.

A license is revocable and doesn't create an interest in land, so that's not it. The right-of-way was a written grant, so it's more than a license.

Profit a prendre is about the right to take something from the land, like minerals or timber. Not relevant here.

So the most straightforward answer is that the wedding planner acquired an express easement because it was created by a written agreement granting the right-of-way.

Wait, but wait—when the wedding planner sold the property to the artist, does the easement transfer? Well, easements are appurtenant, meaning they attach to the land and pass with it. So the artist would have the easement. But the problem is about the interest the wedding planner acquired, so that's not affecting the type, just whether it's appurtenant.

So, the answer should be an express easement, which is option D.

The wedding planner acquired a right-of-way through a written agreement with the neighbor, which explicitly granted a 30-foot-wide strip of land for access. This written grant indicates the creation of an easement. Among the types of easements, this scenario aligns with an express easement, as it was intentionally and explicitly created through a written agreement. Other types of easements, such as easements by estoppel, prescription, necessity, or implication, do not apply here because the creation of the easement was straightforward and based on a written grant. The improvements made to the road and subsequent events do not alter the nature of the easement initially created. Therefore, the interest acquired by the wedding planner is best described as an express easement.
