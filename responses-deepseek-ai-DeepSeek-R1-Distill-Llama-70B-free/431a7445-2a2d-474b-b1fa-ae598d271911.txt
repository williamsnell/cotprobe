Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about corporate law, specifically dealing with the removal of directors. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about what happens when there's no specific provision in the articles of incorporation regarding the removal of directors. I remember that in corporate governance, the rules can vary depending on whether the corporation is governed by certain statutes, like the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), or other state laws.

So the question asks: If the directors are elected for a specified term and there's no contrary provision in the articles, what's the rule about their removal?

Looking at the options:

Option A says they can be removed with a two-thirds majority. I think that might be the case in some jurisdictions, but I'm not sure if it's the default without any provisions.

Option B mentions removal for missing three meetings without excuse. That rings a bell as a possible ground for removal, maybe under certain statutes, but again, I'm not certain if that's the default.

Option C states they can't be removed before their term ends. That would mean only removal for cause, but I think in some cases, shareholders can remove directors even without cause, depending on the law.

Option D says only the board can remove them, not shareholders. That doesn't sound right because typically shareholders have the power to remove directors, especially in the absence of specific provisions.

Option E says they can be removed with or without cause by shareholders. This seems familiar. I think under the MBCA, directors can be removed with or without cause unless the articles say otherwise.

Option F involves a court decree. That sounds more like a situation where it's difficult to remove directors, maybe when it's for cause and the court has to step in. But I don't think that's the default without provisions.

Option G requires a unanimous vote, which seems too strict. I don't think that's the usual case unless specified.

Option H says removal is only for cause and after a hearing. That would be in cases where cause is required, but again, I think the default might allow removal without cause.

Option I is removal for cause only. That might be the case in some states, but I'm trying to remember the MBCA's stance.

Option J requires a replacement to be identified. I haven't heard that as a general rule, so probably not.

So, thinking back, under the MBCA, which many states follow, if the articles don't specify, directors can be removed with or without cause by a majority shareholder vote. So that would point to option E: can be removed at a meeting of shareholders, with or without cause.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I also remember something about classified boards and staggered terms, but the question says the directors are elected for a specified term, which might imply a classified board, but I think the removal rules are separate from that.

Another thought: some states allow removal without cause unless the articles say otherwise. So if the articles don't have a provision, then it's possible.

Looking again, option E says they can be removed with or without cause. So yes, that seems correct.

I think the correct answer is E.

In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, the default rule under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), which many jurisdictions follow, allows shareholders to remove directors with or without cause. This means that unless the articles specify otherwise, directors elected for a specified term can be removed at a meeting of the shareholders by a majority vote, regardless of whether there is cause for removal.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. A two-thirds majority is not the default requirement unless specified in the articles.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Missing meetings without an excuse is a ground for removal in some cases but is not the default rule.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Directors can generally be removed before their term expires unless the articles restrict this.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Shareholders typically have the power to remove directors, not just the board.
- **Option E**: Correct. This aligns with the MBCA's default rule allowing removal with or without cause.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Court involvement is not the default for removal unless specified.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Unanimous vote is too strict and not the default.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Removal for cause with a hearing is not the default unless specified.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Removal for cause only is not the default under the MBCA.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Identifying a replacement is not a default requirement for removal.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
