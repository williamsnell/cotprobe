Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from 0 to π of [sin(123x/2) divided by sin(x/2)] squared dx. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.

Wait, I remember something about integrals involving sine functions and their properties. Oh right, there's this identity or maybe a series expansion that could help here. Let me think. Oh, right! The function sin(nx)/sin(x) can be expressed as a sum of cosines. Yeah, I think that's right.

So, for a general integer n, sin(nθ)/sin(θ) is equal to the sum from k=0 to n-1 of cos((2k+1 - n)θ/2). Or wait, maybe I got the exact terms wrong. Let me try to recall. Oh wait, I think it's something like the sum of cosines with specific arguments. I think the identity is sin(nθ)/sin(θ) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i(2k - n +1)θ/2} or something along those lines. But maybe I should think in terms of real functions.

Alternatively, another approach: The integral of [sin(a x)/sin(b x)]² dx from 0 to π. Wait, in this problem, a is 123/2 and b is 1/2. So a is much larger than b. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, another thought. The function [sin(n x/2)/sin(x/2)]² can be expressed using a sum of cosines squared. Or maybe, expanding it using the identity for sin^2. Let me try that.

I remember that sin^2 θ = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. So maybe I can write [sin(123x/2)]² as (1 - cos(123x))/2, and similarly for sin(x/2) squared. But wait, no, because the denominator is sin(x/2), so the entire fraction is squared. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, maybe I should first consider the square of the ratio: [sin(123x/2)/sin(x/2)]². Let's denote n = 123, so it's [sin(n x/2)/sin(x/2)]². I think there's a known integral for this. I seem to recall that the integral from 0 to π of [sin(n x)/sin(x)]² dx equals (n π)/2, but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Or was it n squared times something?

Wait, no, let me think again. The integral of [sin(n x)/sin(x)]^2 over 0 to π is known. I think it's n π. Or maybe (n^2)π? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact result. Alternatively, maybe it's (n π)/2.

Wait, no, perhaps I should consider expanding [sin(n x/2)/sin(x/2)]². Let me see. Let me write sin(n x/2) as the product of terms. Oh wait, using the identity for sin(nθ) as a product involving sin(θ) and some terms. Alternatively, I think there's a way to express sin(nθ)/sinθ as a sum of Chebyshev polynomials or something else, but maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that [sin(nθ)/sinθ]^2 = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (n - k) e^{i(2k -n +1)θ}, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Fourier series or orthogonality.

Wait, another approach: when you square the ratio, you get [sin(n x/2)]^2 / [sin(x/2)]^2. Let me split this into [sin(n x/2)]^2 * [1/[sin(x/2)]^2]. Hmm, but integrating that seems tricky. Maybe expanding [sin(n x/2)]^2 as (1 - cos(n x))/2. So the integrand becomes [ (1 - cos(n x)) / (2 [sin(x/2)]^2 ) ].

But then [sin(x/2)]^2 is (1 - cos x)/2. So the denominator becomes (1 - cos x)/2. Putting it all together, the integrand is [ (1 - cos(n x)) / (2 * ( (1 - cos x)/2 )) ] = [ (1 - cos(n x)) ] / (1 - cos x).

Hmm, that simplifies to (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x). Now, I can expand 1/(1 - cos x) as a series. Wait, but integrating from 0 to π, maybe I can find a way to represent this as a sum.

Wait, another idea: using the identity 1 - cos x = 2 sin²(x/2), so 1/(1 - cos x) = 1/(2 sin²(x/2)). So the integrand becomes [1 - cos(n x)] * [1/(2 sin²(x/2))] * 2, because the denominator after the substitution is 2 sin²(x/2). Wait, no, let me go through that again.

Wait, [sin(n x/2)]^2 = (1 - cos(n x))/2. And [sin(x/2)]^2 is (1 - cos x)/2. So the ratio [sin(n x/2)/sin(x/2)]^2 is [ (1 - cos(n x))/2 ] / [ (1 - cos x)/2 ] = (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x).

So the integrand is (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x). Now, I can write 1 - cos(n x) as 2 sin²(n x/2), but perhaps more useful is to express it as a sum.

Wait, maybe I can expand 1/(1 - cos x) as a Fourier series or some kind of expansion. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) is equal to sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i(2k - n +1)x}, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Ah, wait a better approach: I think that (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) can be written as a sum of cosines. Let me think about it.

Using the identity for summing a geometric series. Consider that 1 - cos(n x) = (1 - e^{i n x})(1 - e^{-i n x}) ) / ( -4 ), but perhaps that's getting too complex.

Wait, I think there's a way to write (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) as a sum. Let me see. Let's write 1 - cos(n x) as (1 - cos x)(something). So maybe I can factor it out.

So, 1 - cos(n x) = (1 - cos x) * [something]. Let me compute [1 - cos(n x)]/[1 - cos x].

I recall that 1 - cos(n x) can be expressed using multiple-angle identities. For example, 1 - cos(n x) = 2 sin²(n x/2), but perhaps there's a way to express it as a sum involving 1 - cos(k x), where k ranges up to n-1.

Wait another thought: The sum from k=1 to n of 2 cos((2k-1)x) equals (sin(2n x))/(sin x). Hmm, but that's a different identity.

Wait, perhaps the function (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) can be expressed as a sum of terms. Let me try expanding it for small n to see a pattern.

Let me try n=2. Then, (1 - cos(2x))/(1 - cos x) = [1 - (2 cos²x -1)]/(1 - cosx) = [2 - 2 cos²x]/(1 - cosx) = 2(1 - cos²x)/(1 - cosx) = 2(1 + cosx).

Similarly, for n=3, (1 - cos(3x))/(1 - cosx) = [1 - (4 cos³x - 3 cosx)]/(1 - cosx) = [1 -4 cos³x +3 cosx]/(1 - cosx) = [ (1 - cosx) (something) ].

Wait, perhaps n=3 gives 1 + 2 cosx. Let me compute: 1 - cos(3x) = 1 - [4 cos^3 x - 3 cos x] = 1 -4 cos^3 x +3 cos x = (1 - cos x)(1 + 4 cos^2 x + 2 cos x) ? Hmm, maybe not the easiest way.

Alternatively, perhaps (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) is equal to sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i(2k - n +1)x} or something similar, but I'm not confident about that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider expanding 1/(1 - cos x) as a sum. Let me recall that 1/(1 - cos x) can be written as sum_{m=0}^\infty (m+1) e^{i m x} for certain ranges of x, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) as sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{i(2k -n +1)x}, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think there's a way to express it as a sum of 1 + 2 cos(2x) + 2 cos(4x) + ... up to some terms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using orthogonality of cosine functions. If I can express the integrand as a sum of cosines, then integrating term by term over 0 to π would retain only certain terms.

Let me assume that (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) can be written as a sum of cos(k x) terms. Let's denote it as sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k cos(k x). Then, integrating from 0 to π, the integral becomes sum a_k times the integral of cos(k x) from 0 to π.

But wait, the integral of cos(k x) from 0 to π is (sin(k π) - sin(0))/(k) ) = sin(k π)/k. Since k is an integer, sin(k π) is zero, except when k=0. Wait, but for k=0, cos(0 x) is 1, and the integral from 0 to π is π.

Hmm, but wait, when I expand (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x) as a sum of cos(k x), perhaps the only term that survives upon integration is the constant term (k=0), which would contribute a_k * π. So the integral would be a_0 * π, where a_0 is the coefficient of the constant term in the sum.

So if I can find a_0, then multiply by π to get the integral.

So the question reduces to finding the constant term in the expansion of (1 - cos(n x))/(1 - cos x).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the integral I = ∫₀^π [sin(n x/2)/sin(x/2)]² dx. Let me make a substitution: let y = x/2. Then, when x goes from 0 to π, y goes from 0 to π/2. So, I = ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 * 2 dy. Wait, because dx = 2 dy, so the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 dy.

Hmm, maybe this substitution makes it easier. Now, I need to evaluate 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 dy.

Wait, I think I remember that ∫₀^{π} [sin(n x)/sin x]^2 dx = n π. So, if that's the case, then our integral I is ∫₀^π [sin(n x/2)/sin(x/2)]^2 dx = n π/2.

Wait, no, because in our substitution, the integral became 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 dy. So, if the integral from 0 to π of [sin(n x)/sin x]^2 dx is n π, then the integral from 0 to π/2 would be (n π)/2? Or maybe not exactly. Wait, let me check.

Suppose that ∫₀^π [sin(n x)/sin x]^2 dx = n π. Then, ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n x)/sin x]^2 dx would be (n π)/2. Then, our integral I is 2*(n π)/2) = n π.

Wait, but wait, this seems a bit circular. Let me confirm the known integral.

I think the integral ∫₀^π [sin(n x)/sin x]^2 dx = n π.

So if that's the case, then in our substitution, the integral I is 2 * ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 dy. But wait, ∫₀^{π} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 dy = n π, so ∫₀^{π/2} would be half of that, so (n π)/2. Then, I = 2 * (n π)/2 = n π.

Wait, but in our case, n is 123, so I = 123 * π ≈ 386.415... So looking at the options, option B is 386.4158898. So that would be the answer.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Because when I made the substitution y = x/2, the integral I becomes 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 dy. And if the integral over 0 to π is n π, then the integral over 0 to π/2 would be half of that, which is (n π)/2. So 2 times (n π)/2 is n π. So I = n π, which for n=123 is 123 π.

Ah, wait, so 123 * π is approximately 386.415... which matches option B.

Wait, but wait a second: when I did the substitution y = x/2, I think I made a mistake in the limits. Let me double-check.

Original integral I = ∫₀^π [sin(n x/2)/sin(x/2)]² dx, with n=123.

Let y = x/2 → x = 2y → dx = 2 dy.

When x=0 → y=0; x=π → y=π/2.

Thus, I = ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(n y)/sin y]^2 * 2 dy.

So I = 2 ∫₀^{π/2} [sin(123 y)/sin y]^2 dy.

Now, what is the integral of [sin(a y)/sin y]^2 from 0 to π/2?

I think the integral over 0 to π is a π, so over 0 to π/2, it would be a π/2.

Thus, I = 2 * (123 * π/2) ) = 123 π ≈ 386.415...

So the answer is 386.4158898, which is option B.

The integral to solve is:

\[
\int_{0}^\pi \left(\frac{\sin(123x/2)}{\sin(x/2)}\right)^2 dx
\]

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Substitution**: Let \( y = x/2 \), so \( x = 2y \) and \( dx = 2dy \). The limits of integration change as follows:
   - When \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \).
   - When \( x = \pi \), \( y = \pi/2 \).

   Substituting, the integral becomes:

   \[
   I = 2 \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \left(\frac{\sin(123y)}{\sin(y)}\right)^2 dy
   \]

2. **Known Integral**: It is known that:

   \[
   \int_{0}^\pi \left(\frac{\sin(n x)}{\sin(x)}\right)^2 dx = n \pi
   \]

   For this problem, \( n = 123 \). Therefore:

   \[
   \int_{0}^\pi \left(\frac{\sin(123x)}{\sin(x)}\right)^2 dx = 123 \pi
   \]

3. **Adjusting the Limits**: The integral in the problem is over \( [0, \pi/2] \), which is half of \( [0, \pi] \). Thus:

   \[
   \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \left(\frac{\sin(123y)}{\sin(y)}\right)^2 dy = \frac{123 \pi}{2}
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**: Substituting this result back into the expression for \( I \):

   \[
   I = 2 \cdot \frac{123 \pi}{2} = 123 \pi
   \]

   Numerically, \( 123 \pi \approx 386.4158898 \).

### Conclusion:

The value of the integral is approximately \( 386.4158898 \), which corresponds to **option B**.
