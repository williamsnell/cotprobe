Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contracts, specifically executory contracts. I'm a bit rusty on my contract law, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option is the least correct concerning executory contracts. The options are A through J. Let me try to understand each term.

First, I remember that contracts can be categorized based on how much each party has performed. The main terms I recall are executory, executed, and partially executed.

An executory contract is one where both parties still have obligations to perform. So neither has done anything yet. Wait, no, maybe one has started? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. An executory contract is where the parties have agreed to perform, but neither has started performing yet. So both are yet to perform. That makes it a wholly executory contract, I think. So option J says an executory contract is when both have yet to begin performance. That sounds right.

Then there's the executed contract. An executed contract is where both parties have fully performed their obligations. So once both have done what they promised, the contract is executed. So option D says an executed contract exists when both have fully performed and no obligations remain. That makes sense. Option G says a fully executed contract exists when neither has any obligations left, which is the same as D. So both D and G seem correct.

Now, what about partially executed or partially executory? Partially executed would mean that some performance has happened, but not all. So if one party has started or completed their part, but the other hasn't, it's partially executed.

Looking at the options, option B says a partially executed contract means both have begun but not completed. That doesn't sound quite right. Because partially executed could mean one has done something, and the other hasn't. For example, if I pay for a service, but the service hasn't been provided yet. So in that case, the contract is partially executed because one party has performed (payment) and the other hasn't (service delivery). So option B might be incorrect because it says both have begun, which isn't necessarily the case.

Option E says a partially executed contract means at least one party has begun performance. That makes sense. Because if even one has started, it's partially executed. So E is correct.

Option F: Partially executory when one has begun and the other completed. Wait, no. If one has completed, then that part is executed, but the other hasn't started. So maybe that's called partially executed, not partially executory. Or perhaps I'm mixing the terms. Maybe 'partially executory' isn't a standard term. I'm not sure about that.

Option H: Partially executed means one has completed while the other has only promised. That fits with my earlier example. So H is correct.

Option I: Wholly executory is when only promises have been exchanged, no performance. That matches with what I thought earlier, so I is correct.

Option C: Executory when one has performed and the other hasn't started. Wait, no. If one has performed, then the contract isn't executory anymore in that aspect. So an executory contract requires both to have obligations. So if one has already performed, then it's not executory as to that party. So C is incorrect because executory implies both have yet to perform. So C is wrong.

Wait, let me clarify. So an executory contract is when both parties still have obligations. Once one party has performed, their part is no longer executory. So option C says executory when one has performed and the other hasn't. That can't be right because once one has performed, the contract isn't executory as to that party. So C is incorrect.

But the question is which option is the least correct, meaning incorrect.

Looking again at option A: A fully executory contract is when both have completed. Wait, no. If both have completed, then the contract is fully executed, not executory. Executory means they still have to perform. So A is wrong. Because a fully executory would mean both are yet to perform, but A says they've completed, which would make it executed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's recap:

- Executed contract: both have performed. So options D and G are correct.

- Wholly executory: both have yet to perform. So option J is correct.

- Partially executed: at least one has started. So E and H are correct. B might be incorrect because it says both have begun, which isn't necessary.

Option C says executory when one has performed and the other hasn't. That's incorrect because if one has performed, that part is no longer executory. So the contract can't be executory in that case; it's partially executed.

Option A says fully executory when both have completed. That's wrong because that's an executed contract, not executory. So A is incorrect.

So the question is asking which is the least correct. The options are A through J.

Looking at all the options, the incorrect ones are A, B, C, F, and maybe others.

The question is which is the least correct, so the most wrong.

Option A: Fully executory is when both have completed. That's wrong because that's when the contract is executed, not executory. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Partially executed when both have begun. That's not necessarily correct because it could be that only one has begun. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Executory when one has performed. That's wrong because once one has performed, the contract isn't executory as to that party. So C is incorrect.

So the question is which is the least correct. So the most incorrect statement.

Looking again, the question is about executory contracts. The term 'executory' refers to contracts where performance is still due. So 'executed' is when performance is done.

So option A says a fully executory contract is when both have completed. That's wrong because that's an executed contract, not executory. So A is incorrect.

Option C says an executory contract is when one has performed and the other hasn't. That's wrong because once one has performed, the contract is no longer executory as to that party. So the contract as a whole would be partially executed, but not executory.

So between A and C, which is worse.

The question asks for the least correct, so the most incorrect.

Option C's description is incorrect because an executory contract requires both parties to have obligations. So if one has performed, the other's obligation remains, but the contract isn't executory anymore in that aspect. So C is wrong.

Option A is wrong because it confuses executory with executed. So both A and C are wrong, but which is more wrong?

The question is which is the least correct, so the most incorrect.

Looking at the answer options, perhaps the answer is A because it misdefines 'fully executory' as when both have completed, which is actually an executed contract.

Alternatively, another approach is to look for the most incorrect statement.

Another point: Option J says an executory contract is when both have yet to begin. That's correct.

Option I says wholly executory when only promises exchanged. Correct.

Option H: Partially executed when one completed and the other promised. Correct.

Option E: Partially executed when at least one began. Correct.

Option B: Partially executed when both began but not completed. That's more specific than the general case. So B is too narrow, but not necessarily wrong. Because if both have begun, it's still partially executed. So B is correct, but perhaps not the only scenario.

Wait, no. Partially executed can mean any performance has started, not necessarily both. So B is a possible scenario, but not the only one. So B's statement isn't incorrect, just incomplete. So B is correct in a specific case, but the option presents it as a general definition, which might not be correct.

Wait, the options are presented as definitions. So option B says a partially executed contract means both have begun. That's incorrect because partially executed could involve only one party having begun. So B is incorrect.

So, among the options, the incorrect ones are A, B, C, F.

The question is which is the least correct, the most wrong.

Option A: Fully executory when both have completed. That's wrong because that's executed, not executory. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Executory when one has performed. That's wrong because that's partially executed, not executory. So C is incorrect.

Between A and C, which is more wrong.

Well, in contract law, an executory contract is one where both parties are still to perform. Once one party performs, the contract is no longer executory as to that party. So option C is wrong because it describes a scenario where the contract is no longer executory for one party.

Option A is wrong because it describes an executed contract as fully executory, which is a contradiction.

So which is the least correct? The question is which is least correct, meaning the most incorrect.

I think option A is the least correct because it's a direct contradiction. A fully executory contract can't exist once both have completed; it's executed. So A is wrong.

But wait, let me check all options again.

Option F: Partially executory when one has begun and the other completed. That doesn't make sense because if one has completed, the contract is executed as to that party. So the contract would be partially executed, not partially executory. So F is incorrect.

So the incorrect options are A, B, C, F.

The question asks which is the least correct, so the most incorrect.

I think option A is the least correct because it defines a fully executory contract as when both have completed, which is the opposite of what it should be.

Alternatively, option C is also wrong, but perhaps less so than A.

Wait, let me think about the terminology again.

A fully executory contract would mean that both parties still have to perform all their obligations. So if both have completed, it's not executory anymore. So A is wrong.

Option C says executory when one has performed. That's wrong because the contract isn't executory once performance has happened on either side.

So both A and C are incorrect. But which is more incorrect.

The question is which is the least correct, so the most wrong.

I think the most incorrect is option A because it confuses the term 'executory' with 'executed.' So the answer would be A.

Wait, but looking at the options, the answer choices are A through J, and the question is about executory contracts.

Wait, another approach: Let's list each option and see if it's correct.

A: Fully executory when both completed. No, that's executed. So A is wrong.

B: Partially executed when both begun. Partially correct, but not necessarily the only scenario. So B is incorrect as a definition.

C: Executory when one performed. No, that's incorrect.

D: Executed when both performed. Correct.

E: Partially executed when at least one begun. Correct.

F: Partially executory when one begun and the other completed. No, that's not correct. If one completed, the other hasn't, then it's partially executed, not executory.

G: Fully executed when neither have obligations. Correct.

H: Partially executed when one completed and the other promised. Correct.

I: Wholly executory when no performance. Correct.

J: Executory when both not begun. Correct.

So the incorrect options are A, B, C, F.

The question is which is the least correct, so the most incorrect.

Option A says a fully executory contract is when both have completed. That's completely wrong because that's when the contract is executed. So A is the most incorrect.

Option C says executory when one has performed. That's also wrong, but perhaps less so than A because it's possible that the other party still has to perform, making the contract partially executed but not fully executory.

Wait, no. Once one has performed, the contract isn't executory as to that party. So the contract as a whole is no longer executory; it's partially executed. So C is incorrect.

So between A and C, which is more wrong.

I think A is more wrong because it's a direct contradiction in terms. A fully executory contract can't be when both have performed. So A is the least correct.

To determine the least correct statement regarding executory contracts, we analyze each option:

- **A**: A fully executory contract is when both parties have completed their performance.  
  This is incorrect because a contract where both parties have completed performance is an **executed contract**, not an executory one. Fully executory implies both parties still have obligations to perform.

- **B**: A partially executed contract means that both parties have begun but not completed performance.  
  This is too narrow and incorrect. A partially executed contract can involve only one party having begun performance, so the statement is not universally accurate.

- **C**: An executory contract is when one party has performed and the other has not yet begun performance.  
  This is incorrect because once one party has performed, the contract is no longer executory as to that party. It becomes partially executed.

- **D**: An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.  
  This is correct, as it accurately describes an executed contract.

- **E**: A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance.  
  This is correct, as it aligns with the definition of a partially executed contract.

- **F**: A partially executory contract is when one party has begun performance and the other has completed performance.  
  This is incorrect. If one party has completed performance, the contract is partially executed, not partially executory.

- **G**: A fully executed contract exists when neither party has any remaining obligations.  
  This is correct, as it describes a fully executed contract.

- **H**: A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.  
  This is correct, as it describes a partially executed contract.

- **I**: A wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party.  
  This is correct, as it describes a wholly executory contract.

- **J**: An executory contract is when both parties have yet to begin performance.  
  This is correct, as it describes a wholly executory contract.

The least correct statement is **A**, as it directly confuses the terms "executory" and "executed." A fully executory contract cannot exist when both parties have completed performance, as this describes an executed contract. This makes **A** the most incorrect option.

**Answer: A**
