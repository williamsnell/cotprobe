Okay, so I've got this question about children's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Hmm, I remember that when parents get divorced, it affects kids in different ways. The question is asking what's most related to how well the kids adjust. The options are from A to J.

I think I should go through each option one by one. Let's start with option A: the quality of the parent-child relationships before the divorce. That makes sense because if the relationship was strong, maybe the child feels more secure even after the divorce. But I'm not sure if that's the most important factor.

Option B is about the degree of post-divorce conflict between parents. I've heard that ongoing conflict can really stress kids out. Like, if the parents are always fighting even after the divorce, the child might feel anxious or sad. That sounds like a big factor.

Option C is the child's academic performance before the divorce. I don't think that's directly related. Maybe if they're doing well, they have better coping mechanisms, but I'm not sure if it's the main factor.

Option D is the frequency of contact with the noncustodial parent. Consistent contact probably helps, but maybe it's not the most critical aspect. It's more about the quality of that contact, I guess.

Option E is the child's gender. I don't recall any strong evidence that gender is a major factor in adjustment. More about individual personality, maybe.

Option F is the socio-economic status. Money can help provide stability, but I think emotional factors are more directly influential on adjustment.

Option G is the remarriage of the custodial parent. Remarriage can bring its own set of challenges, like adjusting to a step-parent, but I'm not certain if that's the top factor.

Option H is the number of siblings. Maybe having siblings provides support, but again, not the main thing.

Option I is the age of the child. Younger kids might adjust differently than teenagers, but does age determine successful adjustment overall? I'm not sure.

Option J is the child's understanding of the divorce causes. Understanding might help, but maybe not as crucial as the emotional environment.

So, putting it all together, I think the most important factors are the parent-child relationship before the divorce and the ongoing conflict after. But wait, I remember reading that the level of conflict between parents after the divorce is a big predictor. If the parents can get along and avoid fighting in front of the kids, the children adjust better. So B might be the answer.

But another thought: the quality of the parent-child relationship (A) could be the foundation. If the relationship was good before, maybe the child can handle the changes better. But I think the post-divorce conflict (B) is more directly related because it affects the child's daily environment.

I'm a bit confused. Some sources say that the quality of the relationships is important, while others emphasize the conflict. Wait, I think research suggests that the degree of conflict after the divorce is a stronger predictor. Because even if the prior relationship was good, if the parents keep fighting, it can really harm the child's adjustment.

So, I think the correct answer is B: the degree of post-divorce conflict between the parents.

The question asks what most influences children's successful adjustment to their parents' divorce. Among the options, the degree of post-divorce conflict between parents (B) stands out as the strongest predictor. Ongoing conflict creates a stressful environment, affecting the child's emotional well-being and adjustment. While the quality of parent-child relationships before the divorce (A) is important, post-divorce conflict has a more direct impact on daily life and adjustment. Other factors, like contact with the noncustodial parent (D) or socio-economic status (F), are less critical than the emotional environment shaped by parental conflict.

Answer: B
