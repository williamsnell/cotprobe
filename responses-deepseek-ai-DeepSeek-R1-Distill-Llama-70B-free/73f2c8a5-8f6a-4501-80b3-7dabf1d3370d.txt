Okay, so I've got this differential equation to solve: y' equals (t squared plus 3y squared) divided by (2t y), and the initial condition is y(1) equals 1. I need to find y(2), and then pick the correct option from A to J. 

Hmm, let me think. The equation is y' = (t² + 3y²)/(2t y). At first glance, this looks like a first-order ordinary differential equation. I remember that equations like these can sometimes be solved by separation of variables or maybe using integrating factors. I'm not sure which method applies here. 

Let me try to rearrange the equation to see if it can be made separable. So, y' is dy/dt, right? So I can write:

dy/dt = (t² + 3y²) / (2t y)

I want to get all the y terms on one side and the t terms on the other. Let me multiply both sides by 2t y dt to move the denominator to the left.

So, 2t y dy = (t² + 3y²) dt.

Now, expand both sides. On the left, it's 2t y dy. On the right, it's t² dt plus 3y² dt. Wait, no, more precisely, the right side is (t² + 3y²) dt. So:

2t y dy = t² dt + 3 y² dt.

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms. Let's see, perhaps group the t terms and y terms. Let me subtract t² dt from both sides:

2t y dy - 3 y² dt = t² dt.

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about substitution. Sometimes, when I see terms like t and y squared, maybe a substitution like v = y² or something similar could help.

Wait, another thought. Let me try dividing both sides of the equation by y². So:

(2t y dy) / y² = (t² + 3y²) dt / y².

Simplify that:

2t (dy/y) = (t²/y² + 3) dt.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write it as:

2t (dy/y) = (t²/y² +3 ) dt.

Wait, but t²/y² is (t/y)^2. Oh, maybe another substitution. Let me set u = t/y. Then, u = t/y, so y = t/u. Let's compute dy in terms of u and t.

So, y = t u^{-1}.

dy/dt = derivative of t u^{-1} with respect to t. Using product rule: derivative of t is 1 times u^{-1}, plus t times derivative of u^{-1}. The derivative of u^{-1} is -u^{-2} du/dt. So:

dy/dt = u^{-1} + t (-u^{-2} du/dt) = (1/u) - (t u^{-2}) du/dt.

Hmm, but from the original equation, dy/dt is (t² +3 y²)/(2 t y). Let me plug in y = t u^{-1} into that.

Compute numerator: t² +3 y² = t² + 3 (t² u^{-2}) = t² (1 + 3 u^{-2}).

Denominator: 2 t y = 2 t (t u^{-1}) )= 2 t² u^{-1}.

So dy/dt becomes [t² (1 + 3 u^{-2})] / [2 t² u^{-1}] ] = (1 + 3/u²) / (2 u^{-1}) ) 

Simplify denominator: 2 u^{-1} is 2/u. So the whole thing is (1 + 3/u²) * u/(2) )= [ (u² +3)/u² ] * u/2 = (u² +3) / (2 u).

Wait, but also, from substitution, dy/dt was (1/u) - (t u^{-2} ) du/dt.

So now, set the two expressions for dy/dt equal:

(1/u) - (t u^{-2} ) du/dt = (u² +3)/(2 u).

Let me rearrange terms. Let me collect terms involving du/dt on one side.

Multiply both sides by 2 u² to eliminate denominators. Let me see:

Multiply every term by 2 u²:

2 u² * (1/u) ) - 2 u² * (t u^{-2} ) du/dt = 2 u² * (u² +3)/(2 u).

Simplify each term:

First term: 2 u² * (1/u) = 2 u.

Second term: 2 u² * (t u^{-2} ) = 2 t.

So equation becomes: 2 u - 2 t du/dt = u (u² +3 ) / (1).

Wait, because the right-hand side: 2 u² * (u²+3)/(2 u) )= u (u² +3).

So:

2u - 2t du/dt = u (u² +3).

Let me bring all terms to one side:

2u - 2t du/dt - u^3 -3u =0.

Combine like terms:

2u -3u = -u.

So:

- u -2t du/dt -u^3 =0.

Let me write it as:

-2t du/dt = u + u^3.

Multiply both sides by -1:

2t du/dt = -u - u^3.

Hmm, this looks more manageable. Let's write it as:

du/dt = (-u - u^3)/(2 t).

I can separate variables here. So:

du/( -u - u^3 ) = dt/(2 t).

Hmm, factor the denominator on the left:

-u(1 + u^2 ) in the denominator. So:

du / [ -u (1 + u^2) ) ] = dt/(2t).

Which can be rewritten as:

- du / [ u (1 + u^2) ) ] = dt/(2t).

Now, integrate both sides. Let's handle the left integral first.

Integral of [ - du / (u (1 + u²)) ) ].

Hmm, let me make substitution for the integral. Let me set v = u², but wait, maybe partial fractions would work better.

Express 1/(u (1+u^2)) as A/u + (Bu + C)/(1+u^2).

Let me compute the partial fractions:

1 = A (1 + u^2) + (Bu + C) u.

Expand right side: A + A u^2 + B u^2 + C u.

Combine like terms:

(A + B) u^2 + C u + A.

Set equal to 1, which is 0 u^2 +0 u +1. So,

A + B = 0,

C = 0,

A = 1.

So A=1, B = -1, C=0.

Thus,

1/(u (1 + u^2)) = 1/u - u/(1 + u^2).

So the integral becomes:

Integral [ - (1/u - u/(1 + u^2) ) du ].

Which is:

- Integral [ (1/u - u/(1 + u²)) du ].

Which is:

- [ Integral (1/u) du - Integral u/(1 + u^2) du ].

Compute each integral:

Integral of 1/u du is ln |u|.

Integral of u/(1 + u²) du: Let me substitute w = 1 + u², dw = 2u du. So (1/2) dw = u du. So integral becomes (1/2) ∫ dw/w = (1/2) ln |w| + C = (1/2) ln(1 + u²) + C.

So putting it together:

- [ ln|u| - (1/2) ln(1 + u²) ) ] + C.

Simplify the negative sign:

- ln u + (1/2) ln(1 + u^2 ) + C.

Alternatively, this can be written as:

(1/2) ln(1 + u²) - ln u + C.

The right side integral is ∫ dt/(2t) = (1/2) ln t + C'.

So combining both sides:

(1/2) ln(1 + u²) - ln u = (1/2) ln t + C'.

I can multiply both sides by 2 to simplify:

ln(1 + u²) - 2 ln u = ln t + C''.

Using logarithm properties, ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), so:

ln( (1 + u²) / u² ) = ln t + C''.

Exponentiate both sides to remove the logs:

(1 + u²)/u² = C''' t.

Simplify left side: (1 + u²)/u² = 1/u² + 1.

So:

1/u² + 1 = C''' t.

Let me write this as:

1/u² = C''' t - 1.

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to write in terms of u. Let's see:

Wait, perhaps I should just combine the terms into a single fraction. Let me think.

Wait, from (1 + u²)/u² = C t.

So:

(1 + u²) = C t u².

Then, 1 + u² = C t u².

Let me rearrange:

1 = C t u² - u² = u² (C t - 1).

So:

u² = 1/(C t -1).

Hmm, but maybe I can write it as:

u² = 1/( (C t) -1 ).

Wait, perhaps I can write this as u squared equals 1/(k t -1), where k is a constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can leave it in the form:

(1 + u²)/(u^2) = C t.

Hmm. Now, recall that u = t/y. So, u = t/y.

Let me substitute u = t/y into the equation.

So:

(1 + (t/y)^2 ) / ( (t/y)^2 ) = C t.

Simplify numerator:

1 + t²/y² = (y² + t²)/y².

Denominator is t²/y².

So the left side becomes [ (y² + t²)/y² ] / [ t²/y² ] = (y² + t²)/t².

So:

(y² + t²)/t² = C t.

Multiply both sides by t²:

y² + t² = C t^3.

So,

y² = C t^3 - t^2.

Hmm, so y = sqrt( C t^3 - t^2 ).

Now, apply the initial condition y(1) =1.

So plug t=1, y=1 into the equation:

1^2 = C (1)^3 - (1)^2.

So 1 = C -1 → C=2.

So the equation becomes y = sqrt(2 t^3 - t^2).

So y(t) = sqrt(2 t^3 - t^2).

Now, we need to find y(2).

Compute y(2) = sqrt(2*(2)^3 - (2)^2) = sqrt(2*8 -4 ) = sqrt(16 -4 )= sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3) ≈ 3.464.

Looking at the options, option J is 3.464.

To solve the differential equation 

\[
y' = \frac{t^2 + 3y^2}{2ty}, \quad y(1) = 1,
\]

we start by rewriting it as:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{t^2 + 3y^2}{2ty}.
\]

Separating variables, we multiply through by \(2ty \, dt\):

\[
2ty \, dy = (t^2 + 3y^2) \, dt.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
2ty \, dy = t^2 \, dt + 3y^2 \, dt.
\]

Dividing through by \(y^2\):

\[
2t \frac{dy}{y} = \frac{t^2}{y^2} \, dt + 3 \, dt.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \frac{t}{y}\), so \(y = \frac{t}{u}\), we compute \(dy\) in terms of \(u\) and \(t\):

\[
dy = \frac{1}{u} \, dt - \frac{t}{u^2} \, du.
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{t}{u}\) into the original equation and simplifying, we find:

\[
\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{-u - u^3}{2t}.
\]

Separating variables:

\[
\frac{-du}{u(1 + u^2)} = \frac{dt}{2t}.
\]

Using partial fractions for the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{-1}{u(1 + u^2)} = \frac{-1}{u} + \frac{u}{1 + u^2}.
\]

Integrating both sides:

\[
-\ln|u| + \frac{1}{2} \ln(1 + u^2) = \frac{1}{2} \ln t + C.
\]

Exponentiating to remove logarithms:

\[
\frac{1 + u^2}{u^2} = C t,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
1 + u^2 = C t u^2.
\]

Rewriting in terms of \(y\) (\(u = \frac{t}{y}\)):

\[
y^2 + t^2 = C t^3.
\]

Applying the initial condition \(y(1) = 1\):

\[
1 + 1 = C \cdot 1^3 \implies C = 2.
\]

Thus, the solution is:

\[
y^2 = 2t^3 - t^2, \quad y(t) = \sqrt{2t^3 - t^2}.
\]

To find \(y(2)\):

\[
y(2) = \sqrt{2(2)^3 - (2)^2} = \sqrt{16 - 4} = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3} \approx 3.464.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 3.464**.
