Alright, so I have this question about heritability in a cloned population. Hmm, okay, I need to think through this step by step.

Heritability, as I remember from my genetics class, refers to the proportion of observable differences in a trait among individuals that can be attributed to genetic differences. So it's like how much of the variation in a trait is due to genetics versus the environment.

Now, the question is about a cloned population. Wait, clones are genetically identical, right? Because they're made from the same DNA, like identical twins but even more so. So if all individuals in the population are clones, that means their genetic makeup is exactly the same. 

If their genetics are identical, then the only differences between them must be due to environmental factors or maybe some random chance, but not their genes. Heritability is about the genetic contribution to variation. So in a cloned population, the genetic variation is zero because everyone's genes are the same. 

So heritability (which is the ratio of genetic variance to total variance) would be zero. Because there's no genetic variance; all the variance must be environmental. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing heritability with something else. Heritability is a population statistic, not an individual one. It tells us how much genetics contributes to differences in the trait in that specific population. So in a cloned population, since there are no genetic differences, any differences in the trait must be non-genetic. 

So the heritability would be 0%. Looking at the options, option J is 0%. 

I think that's correct. Unless I'm missing something. Are there any exceptions? Well, maybe if there are mutations occurring after cloning, but I don't think that's considered here. The question is about a cloned population, so we assume they're identical, and any variation is environmental.

The heritability of traits in a cloned population refers to the proportion of observable differences in a trait that can be attributed to genetic differences. In a cloned population, all individuals are genetically identical because they originate from the same DNA. This means there is no genetic variation among the clones. Any differences in traits must therefore be due to environmental factors or non-genetic influences.

Heritability is calculated as the ratio of genetic variance to total variance. Since there is no genetic variance in a cloned population, the heritability is 0%. This is because heritability specifically measures the contribution of genetic differences to trait variation, which is absent in this scenario.

Thus, the correct answer is:

J: 0%
