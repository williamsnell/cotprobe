Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration and concentrations. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says: There's a 50 ml solution of sulfuric acid with 0.490 grams of H2SO4. Then, this solution is titrated against sodium hydroxide of unknown concentration. The titration shows that 12.5 ml of the acid solution neutralizes 20.0 ml of the base solution. I need to find the concentration of the NaOH solution.

Wait, right, I remember that titration is about neutralization between an acid and a base. So the reaction here would involve H2SO4 and NaOH. Let me write that equation down.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons. So the reaction with NaOH, which is a strong base, should be something like:

H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O

Oh yeah, because each H2SO4 gives two H+ ions, so two NaOH are needed to neutralize it.

First, I think I need to find the concentration (molarity) of the sulfuric acid solution. Because once I have that, I can use the titration data to find the NaOH concentration.

The given data for the acid solution is 50 ml (which is 0.05 liters) containing 0.490 grams of H2SO4. So I can calculate the molarity of H2SO4.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So I need the moles of H2SO4. The molar mass of H2SO4 is (2*1) + (32.07) + (4*16) = 2 + 32.07 + 64 = 98.07 g/mol.

Moles of H2SO4 = mass / molar mass = 0.490 g / 98.07 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that. 0.490 divided by 98.07. Hmm, 98 is about 0.005 times 20, wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step.

98.07 times 0.005 is 0.49035. Oh wait, that's almost exactly 0.490 grams. So 0.490 /98.07 ≈ 0.005 moles. So about 0.005 mol in 0.05 liters.

Wait, that makes the concentration M = moles / volume (in L) = 0.005 mol / 0.05 L = 0.1 M. So the sulfuric acid solution is 0.1 M.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, 0.05 L is 50 ml. So 0.490 g / 98.07 g/mol = 0.005 mol exactly. So 0.005 / 0.05 = 0.1 M. Yep.

Now, the titration part. 12.5 ml of the 0.1 M H2SO4 solution is used to neutralize 20.0 ml of NaOH solution. I need to find the concentration of NaOH.

So in a titration, the moles of acid reacting with the base can be found using their respective volumes and concentrations.

But wait, the reaction equation is H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O. So for every mole of H2SO4, two moles of NaOH are needed.

So the moles of H2SO4 in 12.5 ml (0.0125 L) of 0.1 M solution: M = moles/volume, so moles = M * volume.

Moles of H2SO4 = 0.1 M * 0.0125 L = 0.00125 mol.

According to the reaction, each mole of H2SO4 requires 2 moles of NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed = 2 * 0.00125 = 0.0025 mol.

Now, the volume of NaOH solution used is 20.0 ml, which is 0.020 L.

Concentration of NaOH is moles / volume. So 0.0025 mol / 0.020 L = 0.125 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.125 M. So that's the answer. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait another thing: the problem says 12.5 ml of the acid solution neutralizes 20.0 ml of the base. Does that mean that the acid is in the burette and the base is in the flask, or vice versa? Wait, in titration, the solution in the burette is the titrant, which is usually the solution of known concentration. But in this case, the acid's concentration is known, and the base's is unknown. So the acid is the titrant, and the base is in the flask. So when 12.5 ml of acid (titrant) is added to 20.0 ml of base, which is in the flask, the volumes are as given.

Wait no, no, wait. The titration process: if you have an acid and a base, you can titrate either way. The burette usually holds the solution you're adding, regardless of acid or base. So if 12.5 ml of acid solution is added to 20.0 ml of base solution, that's correct. So the way I calculated it should be right.

Alternatively, another way to think about titration is using the equation:

M_acid * V_acid = M_base * V_base * (stoichiometric ratio)

Wait, but the stoichiometric ratio depends on the reaction. Since each H2SO4 reacts with 2 NaOH, the ratio is 1:2.

So M_acid * V_acid = 2 * M_base * V_base

Wait, actually, let me think again. The stoichiometric ratio is 1 mole H2SO4 : 2 moles NaOH. So for neutralization, the moles of acid (H2SO4) times 2 equals the moles of NaOH.

So, moles of H2SO4 = M_acid * V_acid (in L) → 0.1 M * 0.0125 L = 0.00125 mol.

Moles of NaOH needed = 2 * 0.00125 = 0.0025 mol.

The volume of NaOH is 0.020 L, so M_NaOH = 0.0025 / 0.020 = 0.125 M.

Yes, that confirms it. So the correct answer should be A: 0.125 M.

To determine the concentration of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, we start by calculating the molarity of the sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) solution. The problem states that a 50 mL (0.05 L) solution contains 0.490 g of H₂SO₄. The molar mass of H₂SO₄ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of H₂SO₄} = (2 \times 1) + (32.07) + (4 \times 16) = 98.07 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles of H₂SO₄ is:

\[
\text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{0.490 \, \text{g}}{98.07 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The molarity of the H₂SO₄ solution is:

\[
\text{Molarity of H₂SO₄} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.005 \, \text{mol}}{0.05 \, \text{L}} = 0.1 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we analyze the titration data. The reaction between H₂SO₄ and NaOH is:

\[
\text{H₂SO₄} + 2\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na₂SO₄} + 2\text{H₂O}.
\]

From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. During the titration, 12.5 mL (0.0125 L) of the 0.1 M H₂SO₄ solution is used to neutralize 20.0 mL (0.020 L) of the NaOH solution. The moles of H₂SO₄ in 12.5 mL are:

\[
\text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume (L)} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0125 \, \text{L} = 0.00125 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH, the moles of NaOH required are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 2 \times 0.00125 = 0.0025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The concentration of the NaOH solution is:

\[
\text{Molarity of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.0025 \, \text{mol}}{0.020 \, \text{L}} = 0.125 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution is **0.125 M**.
