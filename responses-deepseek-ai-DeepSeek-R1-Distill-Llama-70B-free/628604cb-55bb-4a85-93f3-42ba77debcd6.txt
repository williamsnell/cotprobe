Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem here. Let me read it again carefully. 

Keri spent 3 hours on her homework. She spent equal amounts of time on all subjects. If Keri spent 1 over 2 hour on science, how many subjects did she study?

Hmm, the question is about figuring out how many subjects Keri studied based on the time she spent. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that Keri spent a total of 3 hours on her homework. She divided her time equally among all her subjects. So each subject got the same amount of time. 

The problem says she spent 1 over 2 hour on science. Wait, 1 over 2 hour? That sounds a bit confusing. Oh, wait, probably it's 1/2 hour, which is 30 minutes. So she spent half an hour on science.

Wait, but that can't be right because if each subject took 30 minutes, and she has multiple subjects, I need to make sure the total adds up to 3 hours. Let me think.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says she spent equal amounts of time on all subjects. So, each subject got the same amount of time. So if she spent 1/2 hour on science, that's the time per subject. But wait, that doesn't make sense because 1/2 hour per subject multiplied by the number of subjects should give 3 hours.

Wait, wait a second. Let me clarify. If she spent 1/2 hour on science, and all subjects took the same time, then each subject is 1/2 hour. So to find the total number of subjects, I can divide the total time by the time per subject.

So total time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Time per subject is 1/2 hour, which is 30 minutes. So number of subjects would be 180 minutes divided by 30 minutes per subject, which is 6. So she studied 6 subjects. Let me check the options. Option G is 6 subjects. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me try another approach. If she spent 1/2 hour on science, and each subject is equal, then each subject is 0.5 hours. So total time is 3 hours divided by 0.5 hours per subject. 3 / 0.5 is 6. Yep, that's the same result. So the number of subjects is 6. So the correct answer is G.

Keri spent a total of 3 hours on her homework, dividing her time equally among all subjects. She spent 1/2 hour (30 minutes) on science, which represents the time spent per subject. To find the number of subjects, we divide the total time by the time per subject:

\[
\text{Number of subjects} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per subject}} = \frac{3 \, \text{hours}}{0.5 \, \text{hours/subject}} = 6 \, \text{subjects}.
\]

Thus, Keri studied 6 subjects.

Answer: G
