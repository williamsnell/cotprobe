Okay, so I've got this problem about a squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) and I need to find several parameters. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand each part.

First, the problem is divided into two parts, (i) and (ii). I'll start with part (i), which has three subparts: (a) breakdown slip s_b, (b) locked-rotor reactance X_lr, and (c) rotor frequency at maximum torque point f_r.

Given data for part (i):
- It's an eight-pole motor.
- Supply frequency f = 60 Hz.
- The motor stalls (pulls out) at 650 rpm.
- Rotor resistance per phase R2 = 0.3 ohms.

Part (i)(a): Breakdown slip s_b.

I remember that the breakdown slip occurs when the motor reaches its maximum torque, which is the point where it stalls. The slip s is calculated as (synchronous speed - rotor speed)/synchronous speed.

First, I need to find the synchronous speed. The formula is n_sync = (120 * f)/p, where p is the number of poles. So for 8 poles and 60 Hz:

n_sync = (120 * 60) / 8 = 7200 /8 = 900 rpm.

The rotor speed at stall is given as 650 rpm. So slip s is:

s = (n_sync - n)/n_sync = (900 - 650)/900 = 250/900 ≈ 0.2778. So approximately 0.278.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options and option G has s_b = 0.278. That's a possible candidate. Let me note that.

Part (i)(b): Locked-rotor reactance X_lr.

Locked rotor condition is when the rotor is stationary, so slip s = 1. At this point, the impedance of the rotor is mainly inductive. The locked rotor reactance can be found using the formula:

X_lr = (V_ph)^2 / (P_rotor) 

But wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, when the rotor is locked, the impedance Z2 is R2 + j X2, but at s=1, X2 = 2πf L2. Since in the locked rotor condition, the starting current is determined by the rotor resistance and reactance.

Wait, another approach: the breakdown occurs when the motor develops maximum torque, which is given by T_max = (3/2) * (V1^2 R2) / (ω_sync^2 (R2^2 + X2^2)). But maybe that's too complicated.

Alternatively, the maximum torque occurs when R2 = s * X2. Wait, that's when the rotor resistance equals the slip times the rotor reactance. Because at maximum torque, the condition is R2 = s_b * X2, so X2 = R2 / s_b.

Wait, but X2 is the locked rotor reactance? Or is it the rotor reactance under normal conditions. No, wait, the locked rotor reactance X_lr is typically the reactance when s=1, which is X2 = 2πf L2. So when s=1, X2 = 2πf L2 = X_lr.

So from the breakdown condition, R2 = s_b * X2. Wait, no, I think the correct condition for maximum torque is R2 = s_b * X2. So X2 = R2 / s_b.

Given R2 is 0.3 ohms, and s_b is approximately 0.278, so:

X2 = 0.3 / 0.278 ≈ 1.079 ohms. Let's say approximately 1.08 ohms.

Looking at the options, option G has X_lr = 1.08 Ω. That matches. So this supports that option G is the right choice.

Part (i)(c): Rotor frequency at maximum torque point f_r.

The rotor frequency is given by f_r = s_b * f. Since s_b is approximately 0.278, and f is 60 Hz:

f_r = 0.278 * 60 ≈ 16.7 Hz. So about 16.7 Hz.

Looking back at the options:

Option G says f_r = 16.7 Hz. So that's matching as well.

So for part (i), option G seems correct: s_b ≈0.278, X_lr=1.08, f_r=16.7.

Now moving to part (ii), using the data from part (i), we have:

Given: The induced voltage per phase in the rotor is 112 V.

We need to find:

(a) Added rotor resistance R_x

(b) Rotor power factor

(c) Starting current I_r.

Wait, the problem says "using the data of the part (i) induction motor, determine..." So I'll proceed with the data from part (i), which I've found using option G.

Wait, but let me make sure. So part (i) uses the given data (8-pole, 60Hz, etc.), and part (ii) is a separate scenario but using the same motor's data.

So for part (ii):

Induced voltage per phase in rotor is 112 V.

I need to find the added rotor resistance R_x that will produce the same starting torque as when the rotor is short-circuited (R_x=0), but now with R_x added, the starting torque is twice the rated torque.

Wait, the starting torque when short-circuited is the locked rotor torque. When the rotor is shorted, the resistance is R2. But when we add an external resistance R_x in the rotor circuit, the total resistance becomes R2 + R_x.

Wait, but normally, the starting torque is the torque when the rotor is at standstill, so s=1.

The starting torque with R_x added would be different. The problem says that the starting torque should be twice the rated torque. Wait, no, the problem says: "produce the same starting torque (twice the rated torque) as with the rotor short-circuited".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again:

"(a) The added rotor resistance R_x (b) The rotor power factor which will produce the same starting torque (twice the rated torque) as with the rotor short-circuited (c) The starting current."

Wait, so the starting torque when R_x is added should be the same as when the rotor is shorted, but that same torque is twice the rated torque. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe both conditions (with and without R_x) produce the same starting torque, which is twice the rated torque. Or perhaps the starting torque is to be twice the rated torque when R_x is added.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that when the rotor is short-circuited (R_x=0), the starting torque is some value, say T_sc. Now, when we add R_x, the starting torque should be the same as T_sc, but in this case, T_sc is twice the rated torque. Or perhaps the rated torque is under normal running conditions, and now both scenarios (with and without R_x) produce twice that torque. Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the starting torque with R_x should be twice the rated torque, and it's the same as the starting torque when the rotor is shorted. So, T_start = 2*T_rated.

But I'm not entirely clear, so I'll proceed with the assumption that the starting torque with R_x added is the same as when the rotor is shorted, and that torque is twice the rated torque. Alternatively, perhaps the starting torque is twice the rated torque, regardless of the condition. I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

But perhaps the approach is to calculate the starting torque with R_x added, set it equal to the starting torque when R_x=0, and find R_x such that the starting torque is the same, but the question says that this torque is twice the rated torque.

Wait, maybe the rated torque is the normal torque under rated conditions. So when the motor is running normally, it's delivering rated torque. The starting torque when shorted is higher, and we're adding resistance so that the starting torque is twice the rated torque.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting torque when shorted is the maximum torque, but that's not correct. The maximum torque occurs at a certain slip, not at start.

Wait, let's get back to the basics.

When the rotor is short-circuited (R_x=0), the starting torque T_sc can be calculated. Now, when R_x is added, the starting torque (at s=1) should be T_start = T_sc, but this T_start is twice the rated torque. Or is it that T_start = 2*T_rated? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that with R_x added, the starting torque is the same as when the rotor is short-circuited, and that this torque is twice the rated torque. So, T_start_with_Rx = T_start_without_Rx = 2*T_rated.

But I'm not entirely clear, so perhaps I should approach it differently.

The starting torque when s=1 is given by the formula:

T_start = (3 * V1^2 * R2_total) / (ω_sync^2 * (R1^2 + (X1 + X2)^2)) )

Wait, but V1 is the stator phase voltage. Wait, but in part (ii), the induced voltage per phase in the rotor is given as 112 V. Hmm, perhaps that's the rotor-induced voltage, which at s=1 would be E2 = V2 = s * E2_0. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

Wait, the induced voltage per phase in the rotor when the rotor is stationary (s=1) is E2 = s * E2_0, but E2_0 is the voltage when the rotor is at standstill relative to the rotating field. So E2 = V2 = (N2/N1) * V1. But when s=1, E2 = E2_0 = (N2/N1) * V1. So perhaps the given 112 V is E2_0, the voltage induced in the rotor at standstill.

Wait, but the problem says "the induced voltage per phase in the rotor of the induction motor is 112 V." I think that refers to when the rotor is stationary, so s=1, which is the locked-rotor condition. So E2 = 112 V.

Wait, but in part (i), we found X_lr as approximately 1.08 Ω. Let me see if that connects.

Wait, the locked rotor impedance Z2 is R2 + j X_lr. But when the rotor is locked, the impedance is Z2 = R2 + j X2, but X2 is X_lr, so at s=1, X2 = X_lr = 1.08 Ω.

Now, the starting current when locked rotor is I_r = E2 / Z2, where Z2 is the impedance.

But wait, E2 is the induced voltage, which is 112 V. So I_r = 112 / (R2 + j X_lr), but since in the locked condition, the current is determined by the rotor's resistance and reactance.

Wait, but in part (ii), the starting current is to be calculated with R_x added. Let me proceed step by step.

But perhaps it's better to approach each part.

Part (ii)(a): Added rotor resistance R_x.

We need to find R_x such that the starting torque with R_x added equals twice the rated torque.

Wait, but I need to find expressions for the torque. The starting torque T_start when R_x is added is given by:

T_start = (3 * E2^2 * R_total) / (ω_sync^2 * (R_total^2 + X_total^2)) )

Wait, E2 is the induced voltage in the rotor, which is 112 V.

Wait, but when the rotor is stationary, the slip s=1, so the rotor current is determined by the rotor resistance and reactance.

Alternatively, the starting torque when R_x is added is:

T_start = (3 * (E2)^2 * (R2 + R_x)) / ( (R2 + R_x)^2 + X_lr^2 ) )

Wait, because E2 is 112 V, R2 is 0.3 Ω, and X_lr is from part (i) as 1.08 Ω.

Wait, but the torque equation when s=1 (starting) is:

T = (3 * E2^2 * R2_total) / (R2_total^2 + X_lr^2 )

Where R2_total = R2 + R_x.

So the starting torque is T = [3*(112)^2 * (0.3 + R_x)] / [ (0.3 + R_x)^2 + (1.08)^2 ) ]

This T should equal twice the rated torque. But I don't know the rated torque. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the rated torque is the torque under normal running conditions, but without knowing the rated current or other parameters, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the rated torque is when the motor is running at its rated speed, which would be near synchronous speed. But without more information, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the starting torque with R_x added should be equal to the starting torque when R_x is zero (shorted), and that this torque is twice the rated torque.

So when R_x=0, T_start_shorted = [3*(112)^2 * 0.3 ] / [ (0.3)^2 + (1.08)^2 ) ]

Let me compute that:

Denominator: 0.09 + 1.1664 = 1.2564

Numerator: 3 * (12544) * 0.3 = 3 * 12544 * 0.3 = 11323.52

So T_start_shorted = 11323.52 / 1.2564 ≈ 11323.52 / 1.2564 ≈ 9004.5 Nm? That seems way too high. Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses different terms, perhaps in terms of phase values or something else. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: the starting torque T_start can also be expressed as:

T_start = (3 * V2^2 * R2_total) / ( (R1 + R2_total)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) )

But I don't know R1 or X1. Alternatively, perhaps we can ignore R1 and X1 because in the locked rotor condition, the stator impedance is much smaller than the rotor's, so Z1 can be neglected. But that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the simplified approach where the stator voltage is applied, and the rotor's induced voltage is 112 V, so the starting torque is calculated based on the rotor's parameters.

But perhaps there's another way. Since the starting torque with R_x is set to be equal to the starting torque without R_x (shorted), and that torque is twice the rated torque. So T_start_with_Rx = T_start_shorted = 2 * T_rated.

But I don't know T_rated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply that the starting torque when R_x is added should be equal to the starting torque when R_x=0, which is the condition when the rotor is shorted, and that torque is twice the rated torque. So, we can write:

T_start_with_Rx = T_start_shorted

Which would mean:

[ (3 * E2^2 * (R2 + R_x) ) / ( (R2 + R_x)^2 + X_lr^2 ) ) ] = [ (3 * E2^2 * R2 ) / ( R2^2 + X_lr^2 ) ) ]

Since E2 and the 3 are same on both sides, they cancel out:

(R2 + R_x) / [ (R2 + R_x)^2 + X_lr^2 ) ] = R2 / ( R2^2 + X_lr^2 )

Let me plug in the numbers:

R2 = 0.3 Ω, X_lr = 1.08 Ω.

So,

(0.3 + R_x) / [ (0.3 + R_x)^2 + (1.08)^2 ) ] = 0.3 / (0.3^2 + 1.08^2 )

Compute denominator on RHS: 0.09 + 1.1664 = 1.2564

So RHS = 0.3 / 1.2564 ≈ 0.2386.

So equation becomes:

(0.3 + R_x) / [ (0.3 + R_x)^2 + 1.1664 ) ] = 0.2386.

Let me let y = 0.3 + R_x. Then the equation becomes:

y / (y^2 + 1.1664) = 0.2386

Multiply both sides by denominator:

y = 0.2386 (y^2 + 1.1664)

Expand:

y = 0.2386 y^2 + 0.2386 * 1.1664

Calculate 0.2386 * 1.1664 ≈ 0.278.

So:

y = 0.2386 y^2 + 0.278

Rearranged:

0.2386 y^2 - y + 0.278 = 0

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

2386 y^2 - 10000 y + 2780 = 0

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to solve the quadratic equation.

Using quadratic formula:

y = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4 * 0.2386 * 0.278)] / (2 * 0.2386)

Compute discriminant:

D = 1 - 4 * 0.2386 * 0.278 ≈ 1 - (4 * 0.0663) ≈ 1 - 0.265 ≈ 0.735.

So sqrt(D) ≈ 0.8577.

So y = [1 ± 0.8577]/(0.4772)

First solution:

y = (1 + 0.8577)/0.4772 ≈ 1.8577/0.4772 ≈ 3.89

Second solution:

y = (1 - 0.8577)/0.4772 ≈ 0.1423/0.4772 ≈ 0.298.

So y can be 3.89 or 0.298.

But y = 0.3 + R_x. Since R_x is an added resistance, it must be positive, so y > 0.3.

Looking at the two solutions:
