Okay, so I've got this problem here where Paul is taking out a loan. The numbers are a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me see, the loan amount is $677.21, and it's for 90 days at a 4% interest rate. I need to find out how much interest he'll have to pay.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about whether this is simple interest or something else. Well, loans often use simple interest unless stated otherwise, especially for short terms like 90 days. So I think I should calculate simple interest here.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T. But I need to make sure about the time period. Since the rate is given as 4% annually, but the loan is for 90 days. Oh right, so I should convert 90 days into a fraction of a year.

I remember that there are 365 days in a year, so 90 days is 90/365 of a year. Let me calculate that. 90 divided by 365... Let me see, 90/365 is approximately 0.24658 years.

Wait, maybe I should keep it as a fraction to be precise. So 90/365 is the time in years.

Now, the principal P is $677.21, the rate R is 4% or 0.04, and time T is 90/365.

So putting it all into the formula: I = 677.21 * 0.04 * (90/365).

Let me compute that step by step. First, 677.21 multiplied by 0.04. Let's see, 677.21 * 0.04. 0.04 is 4 cents, so 10% of 677.21 is 67.721, so 4% is 27.0884? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 1% is 6.7721, so 4% is 4 times that, which is 27.0884 dollars.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Oh no, I think I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate 677.21 * 0.04.

Yes, 0.04 is 4%, so 677.21 * 0.04 is 27.0884. So that's if it was for a year. But since it's 90 days, I have to multiply by 90/365.

So now, 27.0884 multiplied by (90/365). Let me compute that.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as (677.21 * 0.04) * (90/365). Let me try that.

677.21 * 0.04 = 27.0884.

Now, 27.0884 multiplied by 90 = let's do 27.0884 * 90 first.

27.0884 * 90: 27 * 90 is 2430, and 0.0884 *90 is about 7.956, so total around 2437.956. Hmm, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 27.0884 * 90:

27 * 90 = 2430.

0.0884 * 90 = 7.956.

So 2430 +7.956 = 2437.956.

Now, divide that by 365.

2437.956 / 365 ≈ ?

Well, let's see: 365 * 6 = 2190. 365 * 6.6 is 365*6=2190, 365*0.6=219, so 2190+219=2409. So 6.6 times 365 is 2409.

2437.956 is 2409 plus 28.956.

So 6.6 plus (28.956 /365). 28.956/365 is approximately 0.0793.

So total is about 6.6793.

Wait, so the interest is approximately $6.68.

Looking at the options, option I is $6.77, which is close, but maybe I made a rounding error somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value using precise numbers.

Let me do the exact calculation:

I = 677.21 * 0.04 * (90/365).

First, 0.04 * 90 = 3.6.

Then, 3.6 / 365 = let's compute that. 3.6 divided by 365.

3.6 / 365 = 0.009863013...

Now, multiply by 677.21.

677.21 * 0.009863013.

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute 677.21 * 0.009863013.

I can approximate this as:

677.21 * 0.01 is 6.7721. Since 0.009863 is slightly less than 0.01, the result will be slightly less than 6.7721.

The difference is 0.000137 (0.01 - 0.009863013 = 0.000136987).

So 677.21 * 0.000136987 is approximately 677.21 * 0.000137 ≈ 0.0927.

So subtracting this from 6.7721: 6.7721 - 0.0927 ≈ 6.6794.

So the interest is approximately $6.68.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option I: $6.77. Hmm, but that's a bit higher than my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a slight error in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me try calculating 677.21 * (4% per annum) for 90 days.

Another approach: The interest can be calculated as (P * R * T)/100, where T is in years.

So P is 677.21, R is 4, T is 90 days.

So T in years is 90/365 = 0.2465759.

So I = (677.21 * 4 * 0.2465759)/100.

Wait, let me compute that.

677.21 *4 = 2708.84.

2708.84 * 0.2465759 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2708.84 * 0.2 = 541.768.

2708.84 * 0.04 = 108.3536.

2708.84 * 0.0065759 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.0065759 is approximately 0.006576.

2708.84 * 0.006 = 16.25304.

2708.84 * 0.000576 = approximately 1.559.

So adding 16.25304 +1.559 ≈ 17.812.

So total is 541.768 +108.3536 = 650.1216 +17.812 ≈ 667.9336.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial approach is wrong. Because 0.2465759 is 0.2 + 0.04 + 0.0065759, so when you break it down, you have to multiply 2708.84 by each part and sum.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 2708.84 * 0.2465759.

Let me try that. 2708.84 * 0.2465759.

Well, 2708.84 × 0.2 = 541.768.

2708.84 × 0.04 = 108.3536.

2708.84 × 0.0065759 ≈ Let's compute 2708.84 × 0.006 = 16.25304, and 2708.84 × 0.0005759 ≈ 1.559.

So adding them all together: 541.768 + 108.3536 = 650.1216, plus 16.25304 + 1.559 ≈ 17.812, so total is 650.1216 +17.812 = 667.9336.

Wait, but that's 2708.84 * 0.2465759 ≈ 667.9336.

Then, since the formula is (P*R*T)/100, so I think I might have messed up a step.

Wait, wait. No, the correct formula is I = (P * R * T) / 100, where T is in years.

So in this case, P is 677.21, R is 4, T is 90/365.

So I = (677.21 * 4 * (90/365)) / 100.

Which is the same as (677.21 * 4 * 90) / (365 * 100).

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 677.21 *4 = 2708.84. 2708.84 *90 = let's compute that.

2708.84 *90: 2708 *90 is 243,720, and 0.84*90 is 75.6, so total is 243,795.6.

Denominator: 365 *100 = 36,500.

So I = 243795.6 / 36500.

Compute that division: 243795.6 ÷ 36500 ≈ ?

Well, let's see: 36500 ×6 = 219000.

Subtract 219000 from 243795.6: 243795.6 - 219000 = 24,795.6.

Now, 36500 ×0.679 ≈ 24,783.5 (since 36500 ×0.6=21,900; 36500×0.07=2555; 36500×0.009=328.5. Adding: 21900+2555=24455 +328.5=24783.5).

So 0.679 gives us about 24,783.5, which is very close to 24,795.6.

So the total is approximately 6.679, so about 6.68.

Wait, so the interest is approximately $6.68. Looking back at the options, the closest is option I: $6.77, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should check if the interest is calculated differently, perhaps using 360 days a year instead of 365? Sometimes in finance, they use 360 days for simplicity.

If that's the case, let me recalculate using T=90/360 = 0.25 years.

So I = 677.21 * 0.04 * 0.25.

0.04 * 0.25 is 0.01. So 677.21 * 0.01 is 6.7721, so about $6.77, which is option I. That would make sense if the time was calculated based on a 360-day year.

But the question didn't specify, but in some loan calculations, especially shorter terms, 360 days might be used. That would make the interest exactly $6.77, which is option I. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses simple interest with 90 days as a quarter of a year, assuming 360 days (since 90 is a quarter of 360). So in that case, the interest would be 4% * 0.25 = 1% of the principal.

Yes, 1% of 677.21 is 6.7721, which is approximately $6.77. So that would match option I.

So I think the correct answer is I: $6.77.
</think>

To calculate the interest Paul will pay on a loan of $677.21 for 90 days at a 4% annual interest rate, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( P = 677.21 \) (the principal amount),
- \( R = 0.04 \) (the annual interest rate),
- \( T = \frac{90}{365} \) (the time in years, assuming a 365-day year).

### Step 1: Calculate \( T \)
\[
T = \frac{90}{365} \approx 0.24658 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply the formula
\[
I = 677.21 \cdot 0.04 \cdot 0.24658.
\]

First, calculate \( 677.21 \cdot 0.04 \):
\[
677.21 \cdot 0.04 = 27.0884.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 0.24658 \):
\[
27.0884 \cdot 0.24658 \approx 6.6794.
\]

Thus, the interest is approximately **$6.68**.

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option to $6.68 is **$6.77** (option I). This slight difference could arise if the calculation assumes a 360-day year instead of 365 days, which is common in some financial calculations. Using \( T = \frac{90}{360} = 0.25 \), the interest becomes:

\[
I = 677.21 \cdot 0.04 \cdot 0.25 = 6.7721.
\]

This matches **$6.77** exactly.

### Final Answer:
The correct answer is **I: $6.77**.
