Question:

How does the filter-amplitude theory account for selective attention in hearing?

Options:

A: The filter-amplitude theory proposes that attention functions as a spotlight that enhances the clarity of selected sounds without affecting their intensity.
B: The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention selectively focuses on sensory inputs based on their intensity.
C: The filter-amplitude theory states that attention is only given to the loudest sound in the environment, ignoring all other stimuli.
D: The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention completely blocks out unattended information.
E: The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention can selectively focus on multiple sounds simultaneously, without the need for filtering by intensity.
F: The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention amplifies all incoming information equally.
G: The filter-amplitude theory asserts that attention is distributed equally across all frequencies of sound, without any selective focus.
H: The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention operates on a first-come, first-served basis, prioritizing the earliest heard sound.
I: The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention works like a filter that attenuates rather than rejects information, allowing certain types of unattended information into the processing system.
J: The filter-amplitude theory claims that selective attention in hearing is determined by the emotional content of the sound, rather than its amplitude.

Okay, so I have this question about the filter-amplitude theory and how it accounts for selective attention in hearing. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that selective attention is about how we focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others. There are different theories explaining how this works. One of them is the filter theory, but I'm not exactly sure which specific model that is.

Wait, the question is about the filter-amplitude theory. Hmm. So, the term 'amplitude' relates to the intensity or loudness of a sound. So this theory probably has something to do with how the loudness of sounds affects what we pay attention to.

I think the filter theory in general suggests that there's a mechanism that filters out certain stimuli before they reach conscious awareness. But the amplitude part must mean it's about the strength or intensity of the sound. So maybe this theory says that we tend to pay attention to the loudest sounds because they're more intense.

Looking at the options:

Option A says attention enhances clarity without affecting intensity. That doesn't sound like amplitude theory because amplitude is about intensity.

Option B says attention focuses based on intensity. That fits with what I was thinking. It implies that the theory suggests we select sounds based on how loud they are.

Option C claims attention is only given to the loudest sound, ignoring others. That's more extreme. I don't think the theory says we can only focus on the single loudest sound; perhaps it's more nuanced.

Option D says attention completely blocks unattended info. I thought filter theories might allow some info through but attenuate it, not completely block.

Option E says we can focus on multiple sounds without filtering by intensity. That seems opposite to the idea of using amplitude as a filter.

Option I says attention attenuates rather than rejects info. Oh wait, maybe that's the case. Some theories propose that unattended info isn't completely blocked but is just less attended. So like a filter that reduces the volume but doesn't eliminate it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So the filter-amplitude theory could be about selecting based on intensity (so focusing on louder sounds) or about reducing the intensity of unattended sounds.

I think the filter theory, as I remember, like Broadbent's filter model, suggests that physical characteristics (like intensity) determine what gets through the filter. So in hearing, if a sound is louder (higher amplitude), it's more likely to be selected for attention.

So looking back at the options:

Option B says attention selectively focuses based on intensity. That sounds right because the theory would prioritize sounds with higher amplitude.

But wait, another thought: the amplitude could refer to how the filter works, not necessarily the selection criteria. Like, the filter might adjust the amplitude (loudness) of the sounds, making some louder (attended) and others softer (unattended), but not necessarily that selection is based on the original intensity.

Wait, the question is about how the theory accounts for selective attention. So maybe the theory is saying that attention works by adjusting the amplitude of the signals. So when you focus on a sound, its amplitude is increased in your perception, making it clearer, while others are dampened.

That would align with option A, which says attention enhances clarity without affecting their actual intensity. Or perhaps option I, which says the filter attenuates rather than rejects info, allowing some unattended info through.

But I'm a bit tangled here. Let me try to clarify.

The filter-amplitude theory might propose that attention acts as a filter that adjusts the amplitude (loudness) of the various auditory inputs. So when you focus on a particular sound, its amplitude is metaphorically increased, making it stand out, while other sounds are decreased in amplitude, making them less noticeable but not completely blocked.

So in this case, the theory isn't just about selecting based on the sound's original intensity but about adjusting the intensity through attention. So the filter is modulating the amplitude of the incoming signals based on what you're attending to.

Looking at the options again:

Option I says the filter attenuates rather than rejects, allowing some unattended info. So the unattended sounds are still there but less prominent. That fits with the idea of adjusting amplitude.

So which is it? Is the theory about selection based on intensity or about modulating the intensity of the signals?

Alternatively, maybe the theory suggests that we prioritize sounds with higher amplitude, so our attention is drawn to them because they're louder.

But I think I'm mixing up different theories. Broadbent's filter model was about selection based on certain characteristics, perhaps including intensity. So the filter allows certain stimuli to pass based on their intensity.

So perhaps the filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention selects stimuli based on their amplitude (loudness). So the answer would be option B: attention focuses based on intensity.

Wait, but another point: if the filter works by adjusting the amplitude of the signals, then it's not about selection based on intensity but about changing the intensity.

Alternatively, perhaps the theory explains that the filter's effect is to change the amplitude of the signals, making some louder and others softer. So attention doesn't just select; it modulates the strength of the signals.

In that case, option I would be correct because it says that the filter attenuates rather than rejects, allowing some unattended info in.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall. Broadbent's theory was an all-or-none filter, where unattended info is blocked. But later theories, like the attenuation model, suggested that the filter reduces the strength of unattended info rather than completely blocking it. So the attenuation theory is a version of the filter model where the unattended signals are weakened but not entirely excluded.

If the question is about the filter-amplitude theory, perhaps it's referring to the attenuation model. In that case, the theory suggests that unattended information is attenuated, which ties into option I.

So putting it together, the filter-amplitude theory implies that attention acts as a filter that reduces the amplitude (loudness) of unattended sounds, allowing some to still be processed but at a lower intensity. So the correct option would be I.

The filter-amplitude theory suggests that selective attention in hearing operates by modulating the intensity or amplitude of auditory signals. This theory implies that attention acts as a filter, adjusting the perceived loudness of sounds. When focusing on specific sounds, their amplitude is effectively increased, making them more prominent, while unattended sounds are attenuated, or reduced in intensity. Importantly, this theory does not completely block out unattended information but rather allows it to be processed at a lower intensity. This aligns with the idea that the filter attenuates rather than rejects information entirely.

Among the options provided:

- **Option A** suggests attention enhances clarity without affecting intensity, which does not align with the theory's focus on amplitude modulation.
- **Option B** implies selection based on intensity, which partially fits but does not capture the attenuation aspect.
- **Option C** claims attention is only given to the loudest sound, which is too extreme and not consistent with the theory.
- **Option D** states that unattended information is completely blocked, which contradicts the attenuation model.
- **Option E** suggests focusing on multiple sounds without filtering by intensity, which is inconsistent with the theory.
- **Option I** correctly describes the theory as allowing unattended information to be processed but at a reduced intensity.

Thus, the most accurate description is provided by **Option I**.
