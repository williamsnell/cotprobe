Question:

An investor owned a building in a city. This was the only piece of real estate that the investor owned. The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: "Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. "After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?

Options:

A: A joint tenancy was created.
B: The tenant became the freeholder of the property.
C: The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.
D: The tenant became a subtenant of the investor.
E: A tenancy at sufferance was created.
F: A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.
G: The tenant's three-year term became a periodic tenancy.
H: A tenancy at will was created.
I: A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about landlord-tenant relationships. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.

An investor owns a building, and this is his only real estate. The building has three stories: a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two. He leased the first floor to a tenant who wants to open a sporting goods store. The lease terms say it's for three years, with an annual rent of $12,000, paid monthly in advance at $1,000 each.

After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted the first rent payment, what's the legal relationship now?

So, the options are from A to I, each describing a different type of tenancy or ownership situation.

I remember that when a landlord leases property to a tenant, the type of tenancy created depends on the terms of the lease. The key here is the duration and how payments are made.

The lease is for three years, so that's a fixed term. The rent is paid monthly in advance, but the lease term is three years. So, the primary issue is whether this creates a tenancy for years, a periodic tenancy, or something else.

Wait, the options don't mention tenancy for years directly. Let me look at the options again.

Option C says the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term. Hmm, I'm not sure what that means. I think that when a lease is for a specific term, say three years, it's a tenancy for years, which is a type of leasehold estate. But what's the difference between equitable and legal here? Maybe when the lease is in writing, it's a legal term, but if it's not, it's equitable? Or perhaps when possession is taken, it changes from equitable to legal? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option I says a periodic tenancy from year-to-year. That usually happens when the lease doesn't specify a fixed term, but here the term is three years. So I don't think that's right.

Option F is a month-to-month periodic tenancy. That would happen if the lease was for a month, but here it's three years. So probably not.

Option A is joint tenancy, which is about ownership, not leasing, so that's out. Option B says tenant became freeholder, which would mean she owns the property, but the lease is only for the first floor, so that's not possible. Option D is subtenant, but there's no mention of another tenant, so that's unlikely. Option E is tenancy at sufferance, which is when someone is on the property without permission, so that's not the case here. Option H is tenancy at will, which can be terminated at any time, but here there's a fixed term.

So the main options seem to be C and I. Let me think about whether the lease creates a tenancy for years or a periodic tenancy.

The lease is for three years, so that's a fixed term. In that case, it's a tenancy for years, not periodic. So why is option C or I in play?

Wait, option C says the tenant's equitable term became a legal term. I think when a lease is agreed upon but not yet executed, the tenant has an equitable interest, like an option or a contract to lease. Once the lease is executed and the tenant takes possession, that equitable interest becomes a legal leasehold estate.

So in this case, after the lease agreement and taking possession, the tenant has a legal three-year term. So the correct answer would be C.

Alternatively, if the lease didn't specify the exact term but implied a term, it might become a periodic tenancy, but that's not the case here.

So I think the correct answer is C. The lease created a three-year term, and once the tenant took possession and rent was paid, it's a legal term.

The legal relationship between the investor (landlord) and the tenant is determined by the terms of the lease agreement. The lease specifies a fixed term of three years, with annual rent paid in monthly installments. This indicates the creation of a tenancy for years, as the lease has a defined duration. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I**: These options describe other types of tenancies or ownership situations that do not align with the fixed three-year term specified in the lease. For example, a periodic tenancy (F or I) would apply if there were no fixed term, but here the term is clearly defined as three years.

- **C**: This option correctly identifies that the tenant's equitable interest (the contract to lease) became a legal three-year term once the lease was executed, the tenant took possession, and the first rent payment was accepted. This reflects the creation of a tenancy for years.

Thus, the most accurate description of the legal relationship is that the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.
