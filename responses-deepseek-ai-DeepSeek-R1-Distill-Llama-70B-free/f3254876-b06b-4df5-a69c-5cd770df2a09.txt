Okay, so I've got this math problem here about group theory, specifically about the order of an element in a group U_8. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the order of the element 5 in U_8. Oh wait, U_8 must be the multiplicative group of integers modulo 8. So U_8 consists of the numbers that are relatively prime to 8. Let me recall, the elements are {1, 3, 5, 7} because those are the numbers less than 8 and coprime with it.

Now, the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer m such that a^m ≡ 1 mod n, where a is the element and n is the modulus. So in this case, a is 5 and n is 8.

So I need to find the smallest m where 5^m mod 8 equals 1. Let's compute the powers of 5 modulo 8.

First, m=1: 5^1 =5 mod8 is 5, not 1.

m=2: 5^2=25. 25 divided by 8 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So 25 mod8 is 1. Oh, so that's it! So the order of 5 is 2.

Wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me calculate 5^3: 5^3 = 125. 125 divided by 8 is 15*8=120, so 125-120=5. So 5^3 mod8 is 5 again. Hmm, so it alternates between 5 and 1.

So the pattern is: 
m=1:5
m=2:1
m=3:5
m=4:1
and so on.

So the smallest m where it equals 1 is indeed m=2. So the order is 2.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculations. Let me compute 5^2 again. 5*5=25. 25 mod8: 8*3=24, 25-24=1. Yep, that's correct.

So the order of 5 in U_8 is 2.

Looking at the options, the answer choices are A through J. The options are labeled with letters, and the possible orders are numbers from 0 to 9. Wait, the options are a bit unclear. Let me read them again.

Options:

A:3, B:4, C:1, D:5, E:9, F:2, G:8, H:0, I:6, J:7.

So the order is 2, which corresponds to option F.

I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, I'll think about the group structure. U_8 has φ(8)=4 elements, so it's a cyclic group of order 4. Wait, no, wait. U_8 is actually isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is not cyclic. Wait, is that right?

Wait, φ(8) is Euler's totient function. φ(8)=4 because the numbers coprime to 8 under 8 are 1,3,5,7. So U_8 has four elements. But U_8 isn't cyclic because there's no element of order 4. Let me check the orders of each element.

1 has order 1 since 1^1=1 mod8.

3: Let's compute 3^1=3, 3^2=9 mod8=1. So order 2.

5: As calculated, order 2.

7: 7^1=7, 7^2=49 mod8=1. So order 2.

Wait, so all elements except the identity have order 2. So U_8 is indeed the Klein four-group, which is not cyclic. So the maximum order of any element is 2.

So yes, 5 has order 2 in U_8.

The question asks for the order of the element 5 in the group \( U_8 \), which is the multiplicative group of integers modulo 8. The elements of \( U_8 \) are \(\{1, 3, 5, 7\}\), as these are the numbers less than 8 and coprime to it. The order of an element \( a \) in a group is the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( a^m \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).

To determine the order of 5 in \( U_8 \), we compute the powers of 5 modulo 8:

- \( 5^1 = 5 \mod 8 = 5 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \mod 8 = 1 \)

Since \( 5^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \), the smallest positive integer \( m \) that satisfies this condition is \( m = 2 \). Therefore, the order of 5 in \( U_8 \) is 2.

To confirm, \( U_8 \) is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, where all non-identity elements have order 2. This aligns with the calculation that 5 has order 2.

From the given options:

- A: 3
- B: 4
- C: 1
- D: 5
- E: 9
- F: 2
- G: 8
- H: 0
- I: 6
- J: 7

The correct answer is \( F: 2 \).
