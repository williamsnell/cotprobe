Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the doctrine of substantial performance. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with contract law, right? Let me think. Substantial performance means that one party has almost completed their part of the contract but might have missed some minor details. When that happens, the other party can't just say the contract isn't fulfilled; instead, they might have to pay for the work done, minus any damages for the incomplete parts.

Wait, so the key here is that the main requirements are met, but there are minor omissions. The idea is that the performance is so substantial that it doesn't justify the other party from walking away without paying. But if the omissions are major, then it's a material breach, and that's different.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: A contract required hair styling to be done to Toby's satisfaction, but Toby was in good faith dissatisfied. Oh, right, that's about satisfaction clauses. If it's subject to personal satisfaction and the person is genuinely not satisfied, the other party might not get paid if they didn't meet the condition. But this doesn't sound like substantial performance because it's a subjective judgment.

Option B: Leslie painted the entire room but didn't put back the outlet covers. That seems minor. Painting is done, but forgetting something small like outlet covers. I think this could be substantial performance because the main task (painting) is done, and the missing part is minor.

Option C: Blair ordered blue chairs but got red ones. That's a significant difference. Color might be a major aspect, especially if the chairs are for a specific decor. So this might be a material breach, not substantial performance.

Option D: Carpenter used pine instead of oak. Oak is more expensive and durable. If the contract specified oak, using pine is a breach. But does it count as substantial performance? Maybe not, because the materials are different. But sometimes, if the substitute is of equal quality, it's okay. If pine is cheaper, maybe it's a problem. So this might not qualify.

Option E: Dentist pulled the wrong tooth. That's a big mistake. It's a clear breach; he didn't perform as agreed. So this is more than just a minor issue.

Option F: Builder forgot to install the kitchen sink. That's a major component of a kitchen. Without a sink, the kitchen isn't functional. So this is probably a material breach, not substantial performance.

Option G: Chef used pepper instead of salt. That's a minor substitution in cooking. The meal is still edible, just seasoned differently. But depending on the context, like if someone has a specific request, this might matter. But I'm not sure if this is the best example of substantial performance.

Option H: Mechanic fixed the car but forgot to change the oil. Changing oil is a routine part of maintenance, but if the main repairs were done, maybe this is a minor omission. So this could be substantial performance.

Now, reviewing the options. The question is which transaction correctly illustrates substantial performance. So the key is that the majority of the work is done, and the omission is minor. Let's see.

Option B: Painting without outlet covers. The main task is done, and the missing part is minor. So the contractor is substantially performed, and the other party can't withhold all payment. They might deduct the cost of putting the covers back.

Option H: Forgetting to change the oil. If the main fix was done, then it's substantial. But maybe changing the oil is a significant part of the service. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another point: the doctrine allows the party to recover the contract price minus any damages for the defects. So in the case of Leslie painting, not putting the outlet covers back might be a minor thing. The owner can probably deduct the cost of replacing the covers. So B seems correct.

But let's think about other options. Option D: Using pine instead of oak. If the contract specified oak, and he used pine, it's a breach. But if the overall structure is sound, maybe it's a case where the performance is still substantial. But the materials are different, so it's a defect. I think in such cases, whether it's substantial depends on the impact. If the material difference is minor, perhaps. But oak is generally better, so maybe it's a material breach.

Option F: No kitchen sink. That's a big issue because a kitchen without a sink isn't functional. So that's more than a minor defect.

So, I think option B and H are the closest. Between them, which is more substantial? Forgetting to change the oil is a maintenance step. If the car was fixed but the oil wasn't changed, maybe that's a minor omission. But depending on the contract, perhaps the oil change was a specified part. So if the contract said "tune-up and oil change," and they did the tune-up but not the oil change, then it's a minor part. So H could also be substantial.

But comparing B and H, in B, the painting is done, but a minor step is missed. So B is a clearer example.

Alternatively, let me think about the substantial performance examples I remember. Like, in construction, if a builder builds a house but misses some minor details, that's substantial performance. So if a room is painted but outlet covers not put back, that's minor. So B fits.

Another example I've heard is a contractor who built a house but left out a plumbing fixture. The court allowed payment minus the cost of the missing item.

So, the correct answer would be B.

The doctrine of substantial performance applies when one party completes the majority of their contractual obligations but fails to fulfill a minor detail. In such cases, the party cannot withhold payment entirely but may deduct damages for the incomplete portion. Letâ€™s analyze the options:

- **Option A**: A contract requiring hair styling to Toby's satisfaction, but Toby was dissatisfied in good faith, relates to subjective satisfaction clauses. This does not illustrate substantial performance, as the issue is about personal satisfaction rather than minor omissions.

- **Option B**: Leslie painted an entire room but failed to put the electrical outlet covers back on. This is a strong example of substantial performance because the main task (painting the room) is completed, and the omission (not replacing outlet covers) is minor. The other party could deduct the cost of replacing the covers but must still pay for the painting.

- **Option C**: Delivering red chairs instead of blue chairs is a significant deviation, especially if color is a key aspect of the contract. This likely constitutes a material breach rather than substantial performance.

- **Option D**: Using pine instead of oak in a bookshelf could be a breach if oak was specified, but whether it qualifies as substantial performance depends on the impact of the substitution. If pine is of comparable quality, it might still be considered substantial performance, but this is less clear than Option B.

- **Option E**: A dentist pulling the wrong tooth is a clear breach and not an example of substantial performance, as the mistake is significant and goes to the heart of the contract.

- **Option F**: Forgetting to install a kitchen sink in a newly built house is a major omission that likely constitutes a material breach, as a functional kitchen requires a sink.

- **Option G**: A chef using pepper instead of salt is a minor substitution, but it depends on the context. If the meal was still edible and the substitution was inconsequential, it could illustrate substantial performance, but it is less directly relevant than Option B.

- **Option H**: A mechanic fixing a car but forgetting to change the oil could be an example of substantial performance if the main repairs were completed and the oil change was a minor omission. However, this depends on whether the oil change was a specified part of the contract.

Among the options, **Option B** is the clearest example of substantial performance because the main task (painting the room) is completed, and the omission (not replacing outlet covers) is minor. The other party can deduct the cost of the missing item but must still pay for the work done.

**Answer: B**
