Okay, so I've got this problem here about a motorcycle purchase. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the motorcycle has a cash price of $275. But there's an installment plan option. I remember that installment plans usually involve some down payment and then monthly payments. The question is asking for the finance charge and the percentage by which the installment price exceeds the cash price.

Alright, let's break it down. The installment plan requires 10% down. So first, I should calculate what that down payment is. 10% of $275. Let me do that math: 0.10 * 275 = $27.50. So the down payment is $27.50.

Now, the monthly payments are $18.20 per month for 18 months. I think I need to calculate the total amount paid in installments. So that's the monthly payment multiplied by the number of months. 18 * 18.20. Let me compute that. 18 * 18 is 324, and 18 * 0.20 is 3.6, so total is 324 + 3.6 = $327.60. So the total payments are $327.60.

Adding the down payment to that, the total installment price would be 27.50 + 327.60. Let's add those: 27.50 + 327.60 = $355.10. Wait, does that make sense? Because the cash price is $275, so the installment price is higher, which makes sense because of the finance charge.

Now, the finance charge is the difference between the installment price and the cash price. So finance charge = 355.10 - 275. Let me subtract: 355.10 - 275 = $80.10. So the finance charge is $80.10. Looking at the options, I see option J is $80.10, so that's part of the answer.

Next, I need to find the percentage by which the installment price exceeds the cash price. So the formula for this percentage, I think, is (finance charge / cash price) * 100. So that's (80.10 / 275) * 100.

Wait, let me compute that. 80.10 divided by 275. Let me do this division. 275 goes into 80.1 zero times, so let's think in terms of 80.10 / 275. I can simplify this by multiplying numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals, but maybe it's easier to just divide 80.1 by 275.

Let me see: 275 * 0.29 is 79.75. Because 275 * 0.3 is 82.5, which is a bit higher than 80.10. So 0.29 * 275 = 79.75. The actual value is 80.10, which is 0.35 more than 79.75. So 0.35 / 275 = approx 0.00127, so the total is approximately 0.29 + 0.00127 ≈ 0.29127, which is 29.13%. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, that's 29.1%.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation using a calculator approach. 80.10 divided by 275. Let me compute 80.10 / 275:

275 × 0.29 = 79.75
80.10 - 79.75 = 0.35

So 0.35 / 275 = 0.0012727... So adding that to 0.29 gives 0.2912727..., which is 29.12727...%. Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent is 29.1%. So that's the percentage.

So putting it all together, the finance charge is $80.10, and the percentage is 29.1%. Looking at the options, option J is $80.10, 29.1%. So that's the correct answer.

The motorcycle has a cash price of $275. Under the installment plan, the buyer pays 10% down, which is calculated as:

\[
0.10 \times 275 = 27.50
\]

The remaining amount is paid in monthly installments of $18.20 for 18 months. The total installment payments are:

\[
18 \times 18.20 = 327.60
\]

Adding the down payment, the total installment price is:

\[
27.50 + 327.60 = 355.10
\]

The finance charge is the difference between the installment price and the cash price:

\[
355.10 - 275 = 80.10
\]

To find the percentage by which the installment price exceeds the cash price, the formula used is:

\[
\left( \frac{\text{finance charge}}{\text{cash price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{80.10}{275} \right) \times 100
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{80.10}{275} \approx 0.29127 \quad \text{or} \quad 29.1\%
\]

Thus, the finance charge is $80.10, and the installment price exceeds the cash price by 29.1%. Comparing these results to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: $80.10, 29.1%**
