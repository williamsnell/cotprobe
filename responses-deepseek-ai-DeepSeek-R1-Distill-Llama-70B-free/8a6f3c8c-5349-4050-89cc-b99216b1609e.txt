Question:

A truck driver was assigned to drive a huge tractor- trailer loaded with logs. The logs were being sold by a lumber company, which had loaded the tractor- trailer. After four hours of steady driving, the truck driver stopped at a lounge and consumed five bottles of beer. He left the tavern in an intoxicated condition and then drove off to make his final delivery. As he came to the top of a steep incline in the highway and started his descent, an 11-year-old girl suddenly darted out into the road directly in front of him. The truck driver slammed on his powerful air brakes and swerved sharply to the left to avoid hitting her, but the girl was struck by the tractor- trailer and was seriously injured. The girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the lumber company to recover damages for the girl's injuries. At trial, which of the following is LEAST likely to be admissible?

Options:

A: Evidence that the truck driver completed a state-approved alcohol education program, if the driver claims that he was not intoxicated.
B: Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the lumber company and truck driver argue that the latter was not negligent.
C: Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.
D: Evidence that the girl had darted into the road in front of vehicles before, if the parents argue that she was frightened by the truck.
E: Evidence that the truck driver had a previous conviction for a DUI five years ago.
F: Evidence of the girl's school records, if her parents argue that she was a cautious child.
G: Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the lumber company argues that the truck driver was an independent contractor.
H: Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone at the time of the accident, if the lumber company argues that the driver was distracted.
I: Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of DUI arising from this incident.
J: Evidence that the lumber company had previously been fined for overloading their trucks, if the lumber company argues that the truck was not overloaded.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question for a law exam. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario involves a truck driver who was delivering logs loaded by a lumber company. After driving for four hours, he stops at a lounge and drinks five beers, then drives again while intoxicated. He ends up hitting an 11-year-old girl who ran into the road. The girl's parents are suing the lumber company for damages. The question is about which evidence is least likely to be admissible at trial.

The options are from A to J. I need to determine which one is least likely admissible.

First, I remember that evidence law has certain rules about what can be admitted. Things like hearsay, character evidence, and relevance are key points.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Evidence that the truck driver completed a state-approved alcohol education program, if the driver claims he wasn't intoxicated. Hmm. I think this might be admissible because it's relevant to his state of mind or his actual intoxication. If he claims he wasn't drunk, showing he took an alcohol education course could be relevant, but wait, maybe it's more about his character, which is generally not admissible. Or maybe under FRE 405, which allows evidence of specific acts if character evidence is already in play. But I'm not sure. I'll have to think more on this.

Option B: Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the company and driver argue he wasn't negligent. Reputation evidence is allowed for character under FRE 405(a), but only if character is an essential element. Here, the defense is arguing he wasn't negligent, so maybe his reputation as a driver is relevant. But wait, reputation is about character, and generally, in a negligence case, a person's character isn't admissible unless it's directly at issue. So maybe this evidence isn't admissible because it's character evidence being used to prove he acted negligently on this occasion, which is not allowed. So B might be inadmissible.

Option C: Evidence that the lumber company had liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the company's insurance investigator testified denying ownership. Insurance is usually inadmissible under FRE 411 because it can prejudice the jury. But there's an exception if the insurance is relevant for another purpose, like ownership. If the company is denying ownership, evidence that they have insurance on the truck could indicate ownership. So C might be admissible, making it not the correct answer.

Option D: Evidence that the girl had darted into the road before, if the parents argue she was frightened by the truck. This is about her propensity to dart into the road, which relates to her character. But in this case, the parents are arguing she was cautious, so the defense might offer specific instances of her darting before to contradict that. FRE 405(b) allows specific acts to prove conduct on a particular occasion. So D is probably admissible, so not the answer.

Option E: Evidence of a previous DUI conviction five years ago. Under FRE 609, prior convictions can be used to impeach a witness if the crime is a felony or a crime of dishonesty. DUI is typically a misdemeanor, so it might not be admissible unless it's relevant for some other reason. But if the driver is testifying and the conviction is more than 10 years old, it's inadmissible. Wait, the conviction is five years old, but the incident happened now. So if the driver is a witness, and the DUI is a misdemeanor, it's probably inadmissible to impeach his character. But maybe it's admissible under a different rule, like as evidence of his propensity to drive drunk. But wait, character evidence is generally not admissible except in specific cases. So E might be inadmissible, but I'm not sure yet.

Option F: Evidence of the girl's school records, if her parents argue she's cautious. School records might be hearsay, but under FRE 803(4), statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment are admissible. If the records are about her behavior, maybe they're not hearsay. Alternatively, if the school records contain statements about her being cautious, they might be hearsay unless an exception applies. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the parents are testifying she's cautious, the school records might be used to corroborate that. I'm not sure if F is admissible or not.

Option G: Evidence that the lumber company had liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if they argue the driver was an independent contractor. Again, under FRE 411, evidence of insurance is inadmissible to prove negligence or wrongful conduct. But if the issue is whether the company is responsible (like vicarious liability), then the insurance might be relevant. For example, if the company says the driver is an independent contractor, but having insurance on the tractor-trailer suggests they own it, which would imply the driver is an employee. So G might be admissible, making it not the correct answer.

Option H: Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone, if the company argues he was distracted. This seems relevant because if he was on the phone, it shows distraction, which supports negligence. So H is admissible, not the answer.

Option I: Evidence that the driver pleaded guilty to DUI arising from this incident. A guilty plea is an admission, and under FRE 801(d)(2), admissions are not hearsay. So this would be admissible. So I is admissible, not the answer.

Option J: Evidence that the lumber company was fined for overloading before, if they argue the truck wasn't overloaded. This is about the company's propensity to overload, which is a specific instance. Under FRE 406, evidence of a routine practice can be admissible. But wait, prior violations might be admissible to show a pattern. However, prior fines might be inadmissible as character evidence. Wait, no, because it's about the company's practice. So under FRE 406, it's admissible as evidence of a routine practice. So J is admissible.

Now, going back to each option. The question is which is least likely to be admissible.

Option B: The driver's reputation for driving being poor. Since reputation evidence is about character, and in a negligence case, a defendant's character isn't admissible unless it's directly at issue. The defense here is that the driver wasn't negligent, so they might argue that his poor reputation is relevant. But I think reputation evidence is only allowed when character is an essential element of the claim or defense. In a negligence case, it's not. So B is inadmissible.

Option E: Previous DUI conviction. As I thought, under FRE 609, a DUI misdemeanor conviction can be used to impeach a witness if it's within 10 years. But if the driver is a witness, then the DUI conviction could be used to impeach his credibility. But wait, the question is about whether the evidence is admissible in the trial, not necessarily for impeachment. If the plaintiff is trying to prove the driver was intoxicated, then the prior DUI might be inadmissible as character evidence. Unless it's being offered for another purpose, like showing a habit. But habit requires a regular response to a specific situation, which might not apply here. So E might be inadmissible because it's character evidence to show he's prone to driving under the influence, which is not allowed under FRE 404(a).

Wait, but the driver's intoxication is a key issue here. The plaintiff would argue that the driver was negligent because he was drunk. The prior DUI might be admissible under FRE 404(b) as evidence of a pattern or propensity, but generally, prior bad acts are inadmissible unless they're for a purpose other than showing propensity. However, in some jurisdictions, prior DUIs might be admissible to show a tendency to drive under the influence. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, if the driver is testifying, the conviction could be used to impeach his credibility, but that's a separate issue.

Now, comparing options B and E.

Option B is about reputation, which is a form of character evidence. Since the defense is that the driver wasn't negligent, the plaintiff might offer his reputation as a bad driver to show he's prone to negligence. But under FRE 405(a), in a civil case, when character is an essential element, you can use reputation or opinion. But in a negligence case, character isn't an essential element. So B would be inadmissible.

Option E: The prior DUI. If it's being offered to show that he was intoxicated on this occasion, it's character evidence and inadmissible under FRE 404(a). Unless it's for another purpose, like motive, but that doesn't apply here. So E is inadmissible.

So which is less likely to be admissible? The question is asking which is least likely to be admissible.

Wait, but the driver's prior DUI could be admissible under the "habit" rule. FRE 406 allows evidence of habit if it's a regular response to a specific situation. But driving under the influence isn't necessarily a habit; it's a repeated behavior, but not necessarily a regular response. So maybe E is inadmissible.

Alternatively, Option B is about reputation, which is about character. So both B and E are about character evidence, which is generally inadmissible in negligence cases.

But the question is which is least likely. Let me think again.

Option B: reputation for driving is poor. If the defense is that the driver wasn't negligent, can the plaintiff use his reputation to show he is a bad driver, implying he was negligent? I think reputation evidence is not admissible because character isn't in issue. So B is inadmissible.

Option E: prior DUI. If it's being offered to show he was intoxicated, it's character evidence and inadmissible. But if the plaintiff is offering it to show he was prone to driving under the influence, which led to the accident, it's still character evidence. So E is inadmissible.

Wait, but sometimes in civil cases, prior similar acts can be admissible under FRE 404(b) for purposes such as showing negligence or a pattern. But under 404(b), the evidence is admissible only if it's offered for a purpose other than showing propensity. So for example, to show the driver had a tendency to drive recklessly, which is what caused the accident. But I'm not sure if that's allowed. Some courts have held that prior DUIs are admissible to show a pattern of reckless driving, which is relevant to the claim of negligence. So E might be admissible, making B the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps B is the least likely to be admissible because reputation evidence is generally not allowed in negligence cases unless character is at issue. Since the driver's negligence is the issue, but his character isn't directly in question. So B is inadmissible.

Wait, but the defense is arguing that the driver wasn't negligent, so the plaintiff might argue that the driver's reputation as a bad driver is relevant to show he was likely negligent. But I think that's not allowed under the rules because character evidence is generally prohibited in proving the conduct on a particular occasion.

So I'm leaning towards option B being the least likely to be admissible. But I'm a bit confused between B and E.

Another angle: Option C's evidence about insurance might be inadmissible under FRE 411, but in C, the insurance company's investigator testified that they deny ownership. So the fact that the company has insurance on the truck could be relevant to show ownership, making the insurance evidence admissible for that purpose. So C is admissible.

Option E's prior DUI: If the driver is not testifying, then the prior conviction can't be used to impeach, but as substantive evidence, it's inadmissible under 404(a). So E is inadmissible.

So now I'm conflicted. Let me try to prioritize.

The question is which is least likely to be admissible.

Option B: Reputation evidence about the driver's poor driving. Not admissible because character evidence is generally not allowed in negligence cases. So B is inadmissible.

Option E: Prior DUI conviction. If it's being offered to show that he was drunk on this occasion, it's inadmissible as character evidence. Unless it's for another purpose, like showing a pattern, which I'm not sure applies here. So E is also inadmissible.

Wait, but the driver was convicted of DUI in this incident, right? Because the incident led to the DUI charge. So I is about him pleading guilty, which is admissible.

Wait, no, Option E is about a previous DUI, five years ago. So it's a prior conviction, not related to this incident.

So E is a prior conviction, which would be inadmissible under 404(a) to show he's a bad driver, but might be admissible under 404(b) for another purpose, like to show a pattern of reckless driving. But I'm not certain.

In any case, the question is which is least likely to be admissible. Between B and E.

Another thought: Reputation is about what others think of him, which is a broader character assessment. Prior convictions are specific acts. So perhaps B is more likely to be inadmissible because it's about reputation, which is a form of character evidence that's typically not allowed except when character is in issue.

So I think the answer is B.

Wait, but wait. The defense is arguing that the driver wasn't negligent. The plaintiff might offer evidence of the driver's poor reputation as a driver to contradict that. But under FRE 405(a), in a civil case, when character is an essential element, you can use reputation or opinion. But in a negligence case, character isn't an essential element, so reputation evidence isn't admissible. So B is inadmissible.

Thus, the least likely to be admissible is B.
</think>

To determine which evidence is least likely to be admissible, we analyze each option under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) and relevant legal principles:

### Option A:
Evidence that the truck driver completed a state-approved alcohol education program is relevant if the driver claims he was not intoxicated. This could be admissible to challenge his claim of sobriety. **Admissible.**

### Option B:
Evidence of the truck driver's poor reputation for driving is a form of character evidence. Under FRE 405(a), character evidence is generally inadmissible in negligence cases unless character is an essential element of the claim. Here, negligence is the issue, not the driver's character, so this evidence is **inadmissible**.

### Option C:
Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer is typically inadmissible under FRE 411 to prevent prejudice. However, if the insurance is relevant to ownership (e.g., to contradict the company's claim that the driver was an independent contractor), it may be admissible. **Admissible.**

### Option D:
Evidence that the girl had darted into the road before is relevant to contradict the claim that she was cautious. Under FRE 405(b), specific acts are admissible to prove conduct on a particular occasion. **Admissible.**

### Option E:
Evidence of the truck driver's previous DUI conviction is inadmissible under FRE 404(a) if offered solely to show propensity for reckless driving. However, it could be admissible under FRE 404(b) to show a pattern of reckless behavior, depending on the jurisdiction. **Potentially admissible.**

### Option F:
Evidence of the girl's school records could be hearsay, but if the records are relevant to her behavior and an exception applies (e.g., FRE 803(4)), they may be admissible. **Potentially admissible.**

### Option G:
Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer is admissible if it is relevant to ownership or vicarious liability, as opposed to proving negligence. **Admissible.**

### Option H:
Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone at the time of the accident is relevant to show distraction and negligence. **Admissible.**

### Option I:
Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a DUI arising from this incident is an admission under FRE 801(d)(2) and is admissible. **Admissible.**

### Option J:
Evidence that the lumber company had previously been fined for overloading trucks is admissible under FRE 406 to show a pattern or practice, which could be relevant if the company claims the truck was not overloaded. **Admissible.**

### Conclusion:
Option B, evidence of the truck driver's poor reputation for driving, is least likely to be admissible because character evidence is generally prohibited in negligence cases unless character is an essential element, which it is not here. 

**Answer: B**
