Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: x minus e^(-x) equals zero. I need to find the smallest positive root using the Regula-Falsi method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that the Regula-Falsi method is a root-finding technique that's similar to the false position method. It's used to find roots when you have two initial guesses that straddle the root. The method converges faster than the bisection method because it uses a weighted average based on function values.

So the equation is x - e^(-x) = 0. I can rewrite this as f(x) = x - e^(-x). To find the root, I need to find where f(x) crosses zero.

I think the first step is to find initial approximations where the function changes sign. Because if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, there's a root between a and b. So I need to test some values of x to find where f(x) is positive and where it's negative.

Let me try x=0. f(0) = 0 - e^0 = 0 -1 = -1. So f(0) is negative.

Now try x=1. f(1) = 1 - e^(-1) ≈ 1 - 0.3679 = 0.6321, which is positive. So between 0 and 1, the function goes from negative to positive, so there's a root there.

Wait, but the question is about the smallest positive root. So that's the one between 0 and 1.

Wait, but the options given are for initial approximations. So I need to choose two points where f(x) changes sign. Maybe I should pick a lower and upper bound.

Wait, but the Regula-Falsi method requires that the initial interval [a,b] has f(a) and f(b) of opposite signs. So I can start with a=0 and b=1. But perhaps the given options are suggesting other initial points.

Wait, looking at the options, I see numbers like 0.001 (option G), 0.1 (D), 0.35 (H), 0.456 (A), 0.567 (F), 0.654 (I), etc. So maybe the initial approximations are two of these.

Wait, but actually, the Regula-Falsi method doesn't require me to choose from the options for the initial interval. Wait, maybe the question is asking which two initial approximations to use. Or perhaps the options are possible values, and I need to choose the correct root from them after calculation.

Wait, the question says: determine the initial approximations for finding the smallest positive root. Then use these to find the root correct to three decimal places with Regula-Falsi.

So probably, the initial approximations are two values a and b where f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. Then, using Regula-Falsi, compute until convergence to three decimals.

Wait, but the options are single values, not pairs. So maybe the correct root is among the options, and the question is to find which one it is.

But the question is phrased as a multiple-choice question where the answer is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the initial step is to determine two initial points, and then apply the Regula-Falsi method. But maybe the initial points are given in the options, and I have to select the correct root.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximations refer to the first two guesses, but the options are possible roots.

Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the root after applying the method, and the options are possible answers, so I just need to compute it.

So perhaps I should proceed to compute the root using the Regula-Falsi method, starting with a=0 and b=1, and iterate until the root is accurate to three decimal places.

Let me outline the steps for the Regula-Falsi method.

The formula is:

x_{n+1} = (f(b) * x_a + f(a) * x_b) / (f(b) + f(a))

Wait, or is it:

x_{n+1} = x_a - f(x_a)*(x_b -x_a)/(f(x_b) -f(x_a))

Wait, that's the secant method formula. Regula-Falsi is similar but uses the same denominator each time, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, correction: The Regula-Falsi method is also called the method of false position. The formula is:

x_{n+1} = x_a - f(x_a)*(x_b - x_a)/(f(x_b) - f(x_a))

But unlike the secant method, in Regula-Falsi, if f(x_{n+1}) has the same sign as f(x_a), then in the next iteration, x_a remains the same, and x_b is updated. Otherwise, x_b remains, and x_a is updated.

Wait, actually, in Regula-Falsi, the interval is adjusted based on where the new point lies. So, I'll need to calculate iteratively, checking the sign each time.

So first, I'll take a=0, b=1.

f(a) = f(0) = -1, f(b) = f(1) ≈ 0.6321.

Now, compute x1 using the formula:

x1 = a - f(a)*(b -a)/(f(b) - f(a))

Plugging in:

x1 = 0 - (-1)*(1-0)/(0.6321 - (-1)) = 0 + (1) * 1/(1.6321) ≈ 0 + 0.6133 ≈ 0.6133

Now evaluate f(x1) at x≈0.6133.

f(0.6133) = 0.6133 - e^(-0.6133)

Compute e^(-0.6133): e^0.6133 is approximately, well, e^0.6 is about 1.8221, e^0.6133 is a bit more, maybe around 1.847. So e^-0.6133 is 1/1.847 ≈ 0.5415.

So f(x1) = 0.6133 - 0.5415 ≈ 0.0718, which is positive.

Since f(a)= -1 (negative) and f(x1)= positive, the root is between a=0 and x1=0.6133.

So for the next iteration, we set b = x1 (0.6133), since f(b) is positive, and a remains 0.

Wait, no, wait: in Regula-Falsi, if the new point x1 has f(x1) with the same sign as f(b), then the next interval becomes [a, x1]. Otherwise, if it's same as f(a), then [x1, b].

Wait, wait, perhaps I should structure the steps more clearly.

Iteration 1:

a0 = 0, f(a0) = -1
b0 = 1, f(b0) = 0.6321
Compute x1 = (f(b0)*a0 + f(a0)*b0)/(f(b0)+f(a0))
Which is (0.6321 * 0 + (-1)*1)/(0.6321 -1) → (-1)/( -0.3679) ≈ 2.718. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, I think I confused the formula. The correct formula for Regula-Falsi is:

x_{n+1} = x_a - [f(x_a) * (x_b - x_a)] / [f(x_b) - f(x_a)]

So let's compute that.

x1 = 0 - [(-1)*(1-0)] / [0.6321 - (-1)] → 0 - [(-1)(1)]/[1.6321] → 0 - (-1/1.6321) → 0 + 0.6133 ≈ 0.6133.

So f(x1) ≈ 0.0718 as before.

Since f(x1) is positive, same as f(b0)=0.6321, so the root is between a0 (0) and x1 (0.6133).

Thus, the next interval is a1 = a0 = 0, b1 = x1 = 0.6133.

Now compute x2:

x2 = a1 - [f(a1)*(b1 - a1)] / [f(b1) - f(a1)]

a1=0, f(a1)=-1; b1=0.6133, f(b1)=0.0718.

x2 = 0 - [ (-1)*(0.6133 - 0) ] / (0.0718 - (-1)) → 0 - [ (-1)(0.6133) ] / (1.0718) → 0 - (-0.6133/1.0718) → 0 + 0.572 ≈ 0.572.

Compute f(x2) = 0.572 - e^(-0.572).

e^-0.572: e^0.572 is about e^0.5 is 1.6487, e^0.572 ≈ 1.771, so e^-0.572 ≈ 1/1.771 ≈ 0.5646.

So f(x2)= 0.572 - 0.5646 ≈ 0.0074, positive.

Since f(x2)=0.0074 is positive, same as f(b1)=0.0718. So the root is between a1=0 and x2=0.572.

Update a2 = a1 = 0, b2 = x2 = 0.572.

Iteration 3:

x3 = a2 - [f(a2)*(b2 - a2)]/[f(b2) - f(a2)]

a2=0, f(a2)=-1; b2=0.572, f(b2)=0.0074.

x3=0 - [ (-1)*(0.572-0) ] / (0.0074 - (-1)) → 0 - [ (-1)(0.572) ] / (1.0074) → 0 - (-0.572/1.0074) → 0 + 0.568 ≈ 0.568.

Compute f(x3)=0.568 - e^(-0.568).

e^(-0.568) = 1/(e^0.568). e^0.568 ≈ e^0.5=1.6487, e^0.6=1.8221. Let's compute more accurately.

We can use a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I'll approximate.

Alternatively, using a Taylor series expansion around x=0. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that each step is getting closer, and the root is around 0.567 or so.

Wait, let's compute e^(-0.568):

We can write 0.568 is approximately 0.57. Let me compute e^-0.57:

e^0.57 ≈ 1.769, so e^-0.57 ≈ 0.565.

So f(x3)=0.568 - 0.565 ≈ 0.003, which is still positive.

Since f(x3)=0.003>0, same as f(b2)=0.0074.

So the next interval is a3=0, b3=x3=0.568.

Iteration 4:

x4 = a3 - [f(a3)*(b3 -a3)]/[f(b3)-f(a3)]

a3=0, f(a3)=-1; b3=0.568, f(b3)=0.003.

x4 = 0 - [ (-1)*(0.568-0) ] / (0.003 - (-1)) → 0 - [ (-1)(0.568) ] / (1.003) → 0 - (-0.568/1.003) → 0 + 0.566 ≈ 0.566.

Compute f(x4)=0.566 - e^(-0.566).

e^(-0.566)=1/(e^0.566). Let me compute e^0.566:

0.566 is close to 0.567, which is 1/√e (since √e≈1.6487; 1/√e≈0.6065). Wait, no, that's 0.6065.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute e^0.566 numerically.

But maybe I can use a calculator approach:

e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872
e^0.566 = e^(0.5 + 0.066) = e^0.5 * e^0.066 ≈ 1.64872 * (1 + 0.066 + 0.066²/2 + 0.066³/6 )

Compute e^0.066:

0.066^2 = 0.004356, so 0.004356/2=0.002178
0.066^3 = 0.000287496, divided by 6 is ~0.0000479

So e^0.066 ≈ 1 + 0.066 + 0.002178 + 0.0000479 ≈ 1.068226.

So e^0.566 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.068226 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.068226.

Let me compute that:

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872
1.64872 * 0.06 = 0.098923
1.64872 * 0.008 = 0.0131898
1.64872 * 0.000226 ≈ 0.000373.

Adding up: 1.64872 + 0.098923 = 1.747643; +0.0131898 = 1.760833; +0.000373 ≈ 1.761206.

So e^0.566 ≈ 1.7612, so e^(-0.566)≈1/1.7612≈0.568.

Wait, that would make f(x4)=0.566 - 0.568≈-0.002, which is negative.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought f(x3)=0.003 and f(x4) is now negative, implying the root is between x3 and x4.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, x4 is 0.566, right? So f(x4)=0.566 - e^(-0.566).

Wait, if e^(-0.566) is approximately 0.568, then 0.566 - 0.568 = -0.002.

So f(x4) is negative.

Now, in this iteration, we have:

a3=0, f(a3)=-1
b3=0.568, f(b3)=0.003
x4=0.566, f(x4)=-0.002

So since f(x4) is negative, and f(b3)=0.003 is positive. So the root is between x4 and b3, which is 0.566 and 0.568.

So now, the next interval becomes a4 = x4 = 0.566, and b4 = b3 = 0.568.

Wait, no. Wait, in the Regula-Falsi method, after computing x_{n+1}, we check the sign of f(x_{n+1}).

If f(x_{n+1}) has the same sign as f(a_n), then the new interval is [x_{n+1}, b_n], else [a_n, x_{n+1}].

So in iteration 3, we had a3=0, b3=0.568, x4=0.566, and f(x4)=-0.002.

Since f(x4) is negative, same as f(a3)=-1. So the new interval is [x4, b3], which is [0.566, 0.568].

So in iteration 4:

a4 = 0.566, f(a4)= -0.002
b4 = 0.568, f(b4)= 0.003

Compute x5 = a4 - [f(a4)*(b4 - a4)] / [f(b4) - f(a4)]

x5 = 0.566 - [ (-0.002)*(0.568 - 0.566) ] / (0.003 - (-0.002)) → 0.566 - [ (-0.002)*(0.002) ] / (0.005)

Compute numerator: (-0.002)*(0.002) = -0.000004

Denominator: 0.005

So x5 = 0.566 - ( -0.000004 / 0.005 ) → 0.566 + (0.000004/0.005) → 0.566 + 0.0008 → 0.5668.

Compute f(x5)=0.5668 - e^(-0.5668)

Compute e^(-0.5668)=1/(e^{0.5668})

Compute e^{0.5668}:

We can use the same approach as before, but perhaps using a calculator approach:

0.5668 is very close to 0.566, which we estimated as e^0.566≈1.7612.

So e^(-0.5668)=1/1.7612≈0.568.

Wait, but wait, perhaps more accurately, let's compute e^0.5668.

We can compute using Taylor series around x=0:

e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24.

x=0.5668.

Compute up to x^4:

x=0.5668
x²=0.5668^2 ≈ 0.3213
x³= x * x² ≈ 0.5668 * 0.3213 ≈ 0.1822
x^4= x * x³ ≈ 0.5668 * 0.1822 ≈ 0.1033

Now, terms:

1 =1
x=0.5668 → 0.5668
x²/2 ≈ 0.3213/2≈0.16065
x³/6 ≈ 0.1822/6≈0.03037
x^4/24 ≈0.1033/24≈0.0043

Adding up: 1 + 0.5668=
