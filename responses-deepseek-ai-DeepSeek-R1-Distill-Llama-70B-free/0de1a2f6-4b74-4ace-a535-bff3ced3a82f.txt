Question:

A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy, lower abdominal pain. The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep. She says she is frustrated by her symptoms and has stopped traveling because of her frequent, urgent need to use the bathroom. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The lower abdomen is mildly tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Antigliadin antibodies are not present. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Fluoxetine
B: Lorazepam
C: Nortriptyline
D: Paroxetine
E: Nefazodone
F: Venlafaxine
G: Zolpidem
H: Sertraline
I: Phenelzine
J: Trazodone

Okay, I need to tackle this multiple-choice question. Let's read it carefully.

So, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy lower abdominal pain. The pain is relieved by defecation and doesn't occur at night. She's frustrated and avoids traveling because of urgent bathroom needs. No serious illnesses, no medications. Her vital signs are normal. On exam, mild lower abdominal tenderness, no rebound or guarding. Labs are normal, stool occult blood negative, antigliadin antibodies negative.

Hmm. So, the symptoms she's experiencing—chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain relieved by defecation, urgency—these are classic signs of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), specifically the diarrhea-predominant type (IBS-D). The fact that the pain is relieved by defecation and doesn't occur at night makes me think it's more functional rather than an inflammatory or structural issue.

She doesn't have any alarm signs like weight loss, blood in stool, or nocturnal symptoms, which are more concerning for other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or infections. The lab tests support this—normal blood work, no occult blood, negative antigliadin (so probably not celiac disease).

So the question is about pharmacotherapy. The options are all medications, but many are antidepressants. Wait, right, because IBS is often managed with certain types of antidepressants even though it's not a psychiatric condition. They help with visceral pain and bowel habits.

Looking at the options: the options are A to J, each a different drug. Let's list what each one is.

A: Fluoxetine — SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
B: Lorazepam — benzodiazepine, anxiolytic
C: Nortriptyline — tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)
D: Paroxetine — SSRI
E: Nefazodone — atypical antidepressant, serotonin antagonist
F: Venlafaxine — SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor)
G: Zolpidem — nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, used for insomnia
H: Sertraline — SSRI
I: Phenelzine — MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor)
J: Trazodone — atypical antidepressant, serotonin antagonist/reuptake inhibitor

Wait, IBS is sometimes treated with low-dose tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs. But which ones are used for which symptoms?

So, for IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), the treatment might include medications that slow gut motility. TCAs, especially the ones with more anticholinergic effects, can help with both pain and diarrhea. Alternatively, some SSRIs are used, particularly those that affect serotonin in the gut, which can influence bowel habits.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think: I remember that in IBS, 5-HT (serotonin) plays a role. For diarrhea-predominant, 5-HT3 antagonists like alosetron can be used, but that's more severe cases. For more mild or moderate, TCAs like amitriptyline or nortriptyline are often used at low doses to help with abdominal pain and possibly slow down bowel movements.

But wait, nortriptyline is a TCA. So option C is nortriptyline. Fluoxetine is an SSRI; some SSRIs can actually cause diarrhea as a side effect, so maybe not the best choice if the patient already has diarrhea. Or wait, maybe it's about the effect on the gut. I think SSRIs can have both prokinetic and inhibitory effects depending on the receptor. 

Wait, the main treatment for IBS-D includes medications like loperamide for diarrhea, but that's more for symptom management and doesn't address pain. For the abdominal pain, antidepressants are often used. 

So, the options here are various antidepressants. The correct choice would be an antidepressant that is commonly used off-label for IBS. I've heard that TCAs are used for IBS, especially for pain. So nortriptyline (option C) is a TCA. But what about the other options? Are any of the other drugs used for IBS?

Wait, another thought: sometimes SSRIs like fluoxetine or sertraline are used, but I'm not sure if they're as commonly used as TCAs for IBS. Also, considering that the patient's symptoms include significant diarrhea, perhaps a TCA would be better because they can have constipation as a side effect, which might help.

Alternatively, if the primary symptom were pain, either could be an option, but since she has both pain and diarrhea, maybe the TCA would be better. 

Wait, but another point: the patient is frustrated and having a significant impact on her life, so maybe she's experiencing some depression or anxiety. Antidepressants could help both the mood and the GI symptoms. 

So, the options are between an SSRI and a TCA. But which is more appropriate for IBS-D?

From what I recall, both can be used but TCAs are more commonly used for IBS. Also, in the case where diarrhea is a major symptom, using an SSRI might not be ideal if it could worsen diarrhea. Some SSRIs can cause GI side effects like diarrhea.

Wait, let me think about this again. Fluoxetine, for example, is an SSRI, and it's more activating. It might increase bowel movements, which is not good for someone with IBS-D. So maybe using a TCA would be better because they can have a constipating effect, which might help the diarrhea.

So, the best option would be a TCA, like nortriptyline (option C). Alternatively, amitriptyline is another TCA, but it's not listed here. So among the options, C is nortriptyline.

Another angle: the other options include anxiolytics like lorazepam (B). But benzodiazepines are not a good long-term solution, especially in a young patient, due to dependence risk. So that's probably not the best choice.

Then, other antidepressants like nefazodone, trazodone, etc.—I think they're less commonly used for IBS. So the choice is likely between C and another option.

Wait, another thought: 5-HT3 antagonists like ondansetron are used for diarrhea, but none of the options here are that. So I have to choose from the given options.

So, nortriptyline is a TCA, which is commonly used for IBS, so option C.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea, intermittent crampy lower abdominal pain, and urgency. The pain is relieved by defecation and does not occur at night, which is consistent with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). The absence of alarm signs, normal laboratory results, and negative stool occult blood and antigliadin antibodies further support this diagnosis. The symptoms significantly impact her quality of life, suggesting the need for pharmacotherapy.

The treatment of IBS-D often involves medications that address both abdominal pain and bowel habits. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) like nortriptyline are commonly used off-label for IBS because they can help alleviate visceral pain and reduce diarrhea through their anticholinergic effects. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also used in IBS, some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, can exacerbate diarrhea as a side effect, making them less ideal in this case. Other options, such as benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam), are not appropriate for long-term management due to the risk of dependence.

Among the given options, nortriptyline (option C) is the most appropriate choice because it is a TCA with established use in managing IBS symptoms, particularly for patients with diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Answer: C
