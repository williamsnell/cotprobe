Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with equilibrium constants and all the related thermodynamics. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is about calculating the equilibrium constant for the reaction H2 + D2 ⇌ 2HD at 300 K. They've given me some data on vibrational frequencies and moments of inertia for each molecule. Hmm, I remember that when calculating equilibrium constants using statistical thermodynamics, we often use the partition functions of the reactants and products.

Wait, right, the equilibrium constant K can be found using the formula involving the partition functions of the products and reactants. The formula is K = (Q_products)/(Q_reactants), but considering the stoichiometry of the reaction. Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's the ratio of the partition functions each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. So for reaction aA + bB → cC + dD, K = (Q_C^c Q_D^d) / (Q_A^a Q_B^b).

In this case, the reaction is H2 + D2 ↔ 2 HD. So the stoichiometric coefficients are 1 for H2, 1 for D2, and 2 for HD. So K would be [Q(HD)^2] / [Q(H2) * Q(D2)].

But wait, each Q is the molecular partition function. For diatomic molecules, the partition function is often approximated by considering translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions. But at room temperature (like 300 K here), the electronic contribution is negligible because the energy levels are too high. So we can ignore electronic partition functions, assuming they're all in the ground state.

So the molecular partition function Q is the product of translational (Q_trans), rotational (Q_rot), and vibrational (Q_vib) partition functions. So Q = Q_trans * Q_rot * Q_vib.

Let me think about each part.

Translational partition function: Q_trans = (V / λ^3) * (2πmkT/h²)^(3/2). But wait, since the translational part is the same for diatomic molecules and the volume V is the same for all species, when we take the ratio for K, the V and some other terms might cancel out. Hmm, but let me think: for each substance, Q_trans is proportional to (T^(3/2) ) (M^(3/2)), where M is the molar mass. Because the translational partition function depends on the mass. So when I take the ratio for K, the translational parts won't cancel completely because H2, D2, and HD have different masses.

Rotational partition function for diatomic molecules: For a diatomic, if it's a heteronuclear molecule (like HD), the rotational partition function is Q_rot = (8π² (kT)/(h² c)) * I * T. Wait, no, the formula is Q_rot = (8π² I k T) / (h²) * (something). Wait, I think the rotational partition function for a diatomic is Q_rot = (8π² I k T)/(h²) * (σ), but for linear molecules, the high-temperature approximation is Q_rot ≈ (8π² I k T)/(h² σ), where σ is the symmetry number. Wait, but H2 and D2 are homonuclear diatomic, so their symmetry numbers are 2, because they can be rotated 180 degrees and look the same. For HD, it's heteronuclear, so σ =1.

Wait, but the problem gives the moments of inertia. Oh, the moment of inertia I is given in units of g·cm² ×10^40. So I need to convert that into kg·m² because SI units are kg, m, s. Wait, 1 g = 0.001 kg, 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 g cm² = (0.001 kg)(0.01 m)^2 = 1e-8 kg m². So the given I values are multiplied by 1e-40, so I for H2 is 0.458e-40 kg m², and similarly for the others.

But wait, for rotational partition function, the formula is Q_rot = (sqrt(π)} ) * ( (8 π² I k T )/(h²) )^(something). Wait, no, the rotational partition function for a diatomic is given by the high-temperature (classical) approximation: Q_rot = (8 π² I k T)/(h² σ) * something. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, if we consider the rigid rotor approximation, the rotational partition function is Q_rot = (8 π² I k T)/(h²) for each degree of freedom. Wait, actually, for diatomic molecules, the rotational energy levels are quantized, but at high temperatures, we can use the classical approximation where Q_rot is continuous. So the formula for the rotational partition function is Q_rot = (8 π² I k T)/(h²) * (T/(θ_rot)) ), but that seems off. Wait, perhaps I should recall that for a diatomic, the rotational partition function is (8 π² (I k T)/(h²))^{something}.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to remember that the rotational partition function for a diatomic molecule is given by Q_rot = (sqrt(π)/σ) * (kT/(hc B))^{something}, where B is the rotational constant. Alternatively, B is defined as ħ²/(2 I k), but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and I should just consider that the rotational partition function is proportional to I and T. Because the exact expression may involve constants that will cancel out when taking the ratio for K.

Similarly, for vibrational partition function, at room temperature, the molecules are mostly in the ground vibrational state, so the vibrational partition function Q_vib can be approximated as 1, but perhaps it's better to use the formula Q_vib ≈ 1 + e^(-h c ν / (k T)) ), but for higher temperatures, this might be a bit more than 1. Wait, but the vibrational frequency is given. So maybe the data provided is necessary for calculating the vibrational partition function.

Wait, the problem gives the vibrational frequencies (in cm^-1) for each molecule. So I think I need to calculate the vibrational partition function for each. The vibrational partition function is given by Q_vib = 1 / (1 - e^(-h c ν / (k T)) ), but actually, that's the quantum mechanical expression for a harmonic oscillator. Alternatively, at high temperatures, it's approximated as Q_vib ≈ kT/(h c ν), but that's when kT >> h c ν.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The vibrational partition function for one mode is Q_vib = sum_{n=0}^∞ e^(-n h c ν / (k T)) ) = 1/(1 - e^(-h c ν/(k T)) ). Alternatively, if h c ν << k T, this can be approximated as Q_vib ≈ (k T)/(h c ν) + 1/2. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to compute the exact expression.

So for each molecule, I can compute Q_vib as 1/(1 - e^(-h c ν / (k T)) ). But wait, all the molecules are diatomic, so each has one vibrational mode. So I'll need to calculate this for H2, D2, and HD.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the vibrational partition functions for H2, D2, and HD.

2. Calculate the rotational partition functions for each.

3. Calculate the translational partition functions for each.

4. Multiply these together to get the total partition function for each molecule.

5. Use these to compute K = [Q(HD)^2] / [Q(H2) * Q(D2)].

Now, let's start with the vibrational partition function.

Vibrational frequency (ν) is given in cm^-1. But to use it in calculations, I need to convert it to s^-1. Because the formula uses ν in s^-1.

The conversion is ν (s^-1) = c * ν (cm^-1), where c is speed of light in cm/s. c ≈ 3e10 cm/s.

So for H2, ν is 4371 cm^-1. So ν = 4371 * 3e10 s^-1 = 4371 * 3e10 = 1.3113e14 s^-1.

Same for others: D2 is 3092 cm^-1 → ν = 3092 *3e10 = 9.276e13 s^-1.

HD is 3785 cm^-1 → ν=3785 *3e10=1.1385e14 s^-1.

Now, the vibrational partition function Q_vib = 1/(1 - e^(-h ν/(k T)) ), where h is Planck's constant, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

We have h=6.626e-34 J·s, k=1.38e-23 J/K, T=300 K.

So let's compute h ν/(k T) for each molecule.

For H2: h ν =6.626e-34 * 1.3113e14 = let's calculate that:

6.626e-34 * 1.3113e14 = 6.626 * 1.3113 ≈ 8.69 → 8.69e-20 J.

k*T =1.38e-23 *300 =4.14e-21 J.

So h ν/(k T) =8.69e-20 /4.14e-21 ≈ 2.099.

So e^(-2.099) ≈ e^-2 ≈ 0.135, but more accurately, e^-2.099 ≈ 0.122.

So Q_vib for H2: 1/(1 - 0.122 )=1/0.878≈1.14.

Similarly for D2: ν=9.276e13 s^-1.

h ν=6.626e-34 *9.276e13 =6.626 *9.276≈61.47 → 61.47e-21 J.

h ν/(k T)=61.47e-21 /4.14e-21≈14.86.

e^-14.86 is a very small number, about 5.5e-7. So 1/(1-5.5e-7)≈1.00000055, which is approximately 1. So Q_vib for D2≈1.

For HD: ν=1.1385e14 s^-1.

h ν=6.626e-34 *1.1385e14=6.626 *1.1385≈7.55 →7.55e-20 J.

h ν/(k T)=7.55e-20 /4.14e-21≈18.25.

Wait, wait, no, because 7.55e-20 /4.14e-21 = (7.55 /4.14)*10^( -20 +21 )= ~1.823 *10^1 = 18.23.

So e^-18.23 is about 1.3e-8, very small. So Q_vib for HD is 1/(1-1.3e-8 )≈1.000000013, so approximately 1.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, for H2: ν =4371 cm^-1 =4371 *3e10 cm/s =1.3113e14 s^-1.

h ν =6.626e-34 *1.3113e14 = (6.626 *1.3113) *1e-34+14 →6.626*1.3113≈8.69 →8.69e-20 J.

k T =1.38e-23 *300=4.14e-21 J.

hν/(kT)=8.69e-20 /4.14e-21 = approx 2.099.

e^-2.099 ≈0.122.

So Q_vib =1/(1-0.122)=1/0.878≈1.14.

Wait, but for D2, ν is 3092 cm^-1 → 3092*3e10=9.276e13 s^-1.

h ν =6.626e-34 *9.276e13 =6.626*9.276≈61.47e-21 J.

h ν/(k T)=61.47e-21 /4.14e-21≈14.86.

e^-14.86 is about 5.5e-7, so Q_vib≈1/(1-5.5e-7)=≈1.0.

HD: ν=3785 cm^-1 → 3785*3e10=1.1385e14 s^-1.

h ν=6.626e-34 *1.1385e14=6.626 *1.1385≈7.55e-20 J.

h ν/(k T)=7.55e-20 /4.14e-21≈18.23.

e^-18.23≈1.3e-8, so Q_vib=1/(1-1.3e-8)=≈1.0.

Wait, but that's strange. H2 has a higher vibrational frequency than HD, but HD's hν/(kT) is higher? Because 18 is higher than 2.099.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating HD's ν. Let me check:

HD's ν is 3785 cm^-1 → 3785 *3e10 =1.1385e14 s^-1. Correct.

h ν =6.626e-34 *1.1385e14 =6.626*1.1385≈7.55 →7.55e-20 J.

kT=4.14e-21 J.

So h ν/(k T)=7.55e-20 /4.14e-21 = 18.23.

So yes, that's correct. So Q_vib for H2 is ~1.14, D2 and HD have Q_vib≈1.

So, now moving on to rotational partition functions.

The rotational partition function for a diatomic molecule is given by Q_rot = (8 π² I k T)/(h² σ), where I is the moment of inertia, σ is the symmetry number, and the other constants are physical constants.

Wait, but I think the formula is Q_rot = (sqrt(π)/σ) * (kT/(hc B))^{something}, but perhaps it's better to use the moment of inertia directly.

Alternatively, the formula for Q_rot is (8 π² I k T)/(h² σ). Let me confirm the dimensions. I has units of kg m², k is J/K (kg m²/s² K), T is K, h is J s (kg m²/s).

So let's put the units in:

( I (kg m²) ) * (k (kg m²/s² K) ) * T (K) ) / (h^2 (kg^2 m^4/s²)) ) → (kg m² * kg m²/s² K * K) ) / (kg² m^4 /s² ) ) → (kg^2 m^4 s^0 ) ) / (kg^2 m^4 ) ) → unitless, which is correct for a partition function.

So the formula is correct: Q_rot = (8 π² I k T) / (h² σ).

Now, I is given in units of g cm² ×10^40, so we need to convert that to kg m².

1 g = 0.001 kg, 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m².

So 1 g cm² = 0.001 kg * 1e-4 m² = 1e-7 kg m².

So the given I values are multiplied by 1e-40 g cm², but wait, the data says I is in g cm² ×10^40. So I think it's I = value ×1e-40 g cm². So to get I in kg m², it's value ×1e-40 g cm² * 1e-7 kg m²/g cm² = value ×1e-47 kg m².

Wait, let me make sure. If I is given as, say, 0.458 for H2, and the unit is g cm² ×10^40, then I =0.458 ×1e-40 g cm². To convert to kg m²:

0.458 ×1e-40 g cm² × (1 kg / 1000 g) × (1 m² /10000 cm²) ) = 0.458 ×1e-40 *1e-3 *1e-4 kg m².

1e-40 *1e-3=1e-43, *1e-4=1e-47.

So I in kg m² is 0.458e-47 kg m².

So for H2: I = 0.458e-47 kg m².

Similarly, HD: 0.613e-47 kg m².

D2: 0.919e-47 kg m².

Now, for each molecule, we compute Q_rot.

But first, let's get all the constants:

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

T=300 K.

σ for H2 and D2 is 2, because they are homonuclear diatomic. For HD, σ=1 because it's heteronuclear.

Let's compute Q_rot for each.

Starting with H2:

I_H2 =0.458e-47 kg m².

σ_H2=2.

Q_rot_H2 = (8 * π² * I_H2 * k * T) / (h² * σ_H2).

Plugging in numbers:

8 * π² ≈8*(9.8696)≈78.956.

Now, numerator: 78.956 * I_H2 *k*T.

I_H2=0.458e-47 kg m².

k*T=1.380649e-23 *300=4.141947e-21 J.

So numerator =78.956 *0.458e-47 *4.141947e
