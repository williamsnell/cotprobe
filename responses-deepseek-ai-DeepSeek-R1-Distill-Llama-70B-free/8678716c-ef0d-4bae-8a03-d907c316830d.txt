Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the tax shield in finance. Hmm, I remember that the tax shield is related to the benefits a company gets from using debt because interest payments are tax-deductible. But wait, I need to think carefully because there are different models here.

The question gives me the value of the firm when it's levered and unlevered. The levered firm is worth $5 million, and the unlevered would be $4.78 million. Oh wait, normally I think the levered value is higher than unlevered because of the tax shield. So the difference between levered and unlevered is the tax shield, right?

Wait, no, actually, the formula I recall is that the value of the levered firm equals the value of the unlevered firm plus the tax shield. So levered value = unlevered value + tax shield. But wait, in this case, the levered firm is $5 million and the unlevered is $4.78 million. So the tax shield would be 5 - 4.78 = $0.22 million which is $220,000. But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option G is $220,000. But wait, the question also mentions present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000. Oh right, I remember that the net tax shield isn't just the difference because sometimes other costs come into play. Oh wait, no, that's more in the context of the Trade-off theory where firms balance the tax shield against bankruptcy and agency costs.

Wait, but in the Modigliani-Miller theorem, with taxes, the value of the levered firm is Vu + Tc*D, where Tc is the corporate tax rate and D is debt. But wait, that's without considering financial distress costs. So in that case, the tax shield is Tc*D, but when you introduce financial distress, the levered value becomes Vu + Tc*D - costs.

But in this question, the levered value is given as $5 million, and unlevered is $4.78 million. So the difference is 5 -4.78 = 0.22 million, which would be the tax shield minus the distress costs. Wait, no, because the formula is Vlevered = Vunlevered + (tax shield) - (distress costs). So if Vlevered is 5, Vunlevered is 4.78, then 5 = 4.78 + tax shield - 0.36 (since the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000). So rearranging, tax shield = 5 -4.78 + 0.36.

Wait, let me compute that. 5 -4.78 is 0.22. 0.22 plus 0.36 is 0.58 million, which is $580,000. Looking at the options, option E is $580,000.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Is the question asking for the tax shield or the net effect? Because the tax shield itself would be the difference plus the costs, I think. Because the tax shield is the benefit from debt, but then the costs (bankruptcy and agency) reduce the firm's value. So the net gain is (tax shield - costs) = 5 -4.78 = 0.22 million. But the tax shield itself is Tc*D, which would be $580,000, with the net being $220,000 after subtracting the $360,000 in costs.

So the question is asking for the value of the tax shield, not the net gain. So the tax shield is $580,000, which is option E.

To determine the value of the tax shield, we start with the relationship between the value of a levered firm, an unlevered firm, the tax shield, and distress costs:

\[
V_{\text{levered}} = V_{\text{unlevered}} + \text{Tax Shield} - \text{Distress Costs}
\]

Given:
- \( V_{\text{levered}} = \$5 \, \text{million} \)
- \( V_{\text{unlevered}} = \$4.78 \, \text{million} \)
- Distress Costs = \$360,000

Rearranging the formula to solve for the tax shield:

\[
\text{Tax Shield} = V_{\text{levered}} - V_{\text{unlevered}} + \text{Distress Costs}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Tax Shield} = \$5 \, \text{million} - \$4.78 \, \text{million} + \$0.36 \, \text{million}
\]

\[
\text{Tax Shield} = \$0.22 \, \text{million} + \$0.36 \, \text{million} = \$0.58 \, \text{million} = \$580,000
\]

Thus, the value of the tax shield is \$580,000, which corresponds to option E.
