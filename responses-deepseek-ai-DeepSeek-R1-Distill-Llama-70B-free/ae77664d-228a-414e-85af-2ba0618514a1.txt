Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer between lead shot and ice. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says: 500 grams of lead shot at 100°C are poured into a hole in a large block of ice. The specific heat of lead is 0.03, and I need to find out how much ice is melted. The options are from A to J, and I guess I'll have to calculate it.

Wait, I remember that when two substances exchange heat, the heat lost by one equals the heat gained by the other. So the heat lost by the lead will be equal to the heat gained by the ice to melt it. Oh right, the formula is Q = mcΔT, right?

So for the lead, Q is the heat it loses. The mass is 500 grams, which I should convert to kilograms, but wait, the specific heat is given in cal/(g·°C), maybe? Or is it in another unit? Oh, specific heat capacity units can be tricky. Let me think. Oh right, specific heat of lead is 0.03 cal/(g·°C), I think. Because I remember that for water it's 1 cal/(g·°C), and lead is a metal with lower specific heat.

So the lead is cooling down from 100°C to... well, when it melts ice, the ice will be at 0°C, right? So the temperature change for the lead is 100 degrees.

So the heat lost by lead, Q_lead, is m * c * ΔT. That would be 500 g * 0.03 cal/(g·°C) * (100°C - 0°C). Let me compute that. 500 * 0.03 = 15, and then times 100 gives 1500 calories. So Q_lead is 1500 cal.

But wait, since the ice is melting, the heat gained by the ice is used to melt it. The heat of fusion for ice is the amount of heat needed to melt it. I think it's about 80 cal/g or something? Wait, no, wait—wait, no, I think it's 80 cal/g. Or was it 334 J/g? Wait, no, because that's in SI units. Wait, let me get this straight. Oh right, in calories, the heat of fusion for ice is about 80 cal/g. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Another thought: I remember that the latent heat of fusion for ice is about 334 J per gram, which is about 80 calories per gram because 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. So 334 J/g divided by 4.184 J/cal is approximately 80 cal/g. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So the heat required to melt the ice is Q_ice = m_ice * L, where L is 80 cal/g. So Q_ice = m_ice * 80.

Since heat lost by lead equals heat gained by ice, Q_lead = Q_ice. So 1500 cal = m_ice * 80 cal/g. Solving for m_ice: m_ice = 1500 / 80 = 18.75 grams. Oh, wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option B is 18.75g. So that's the answer, right? Hmm. That makes sense because the lead cools down, releasing heat, and that heat goes into melting the ice.

Wait, but let me double-check the specific heat of lead. I've heard that the specific heat of lead is around 0.03 cal/(g·°C). Is that correct? I think so, because metals typically have lower specific heat capacities. Yes, I think 0.03 is right. So the calculation should be correct.

So yeah, I think the answer is option B: 18.75 g.

To determine how much ice is melted when 500 g of lead shot at 100°C is poured into a hole in a large block of ice, we use the principle of conservation of energy: the heat lost by the lead equals the heat gained by the ice.

1. **Heat lost by the lead**:  
   The formula for heat transfer is \( Q = mc\Delta T \), where:  
   - \( m = 500 \, \text{g} \) (mass of lead),  
   - \( c = 0.03 \, \text{cal/(g·°C)} \) (specific heat of lead),  
   - \( \Delta T = 100 \, \text{°C} \) (temperature change from 100°C to 0°C).  

   Substituting:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{lead}} = 500 \cdot 0.03 \cdot 100 = 1500 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

2. **Heat gained by the ice**:  
   The heat required to melt ice is given by \( Q = mL \), where:  
   - \( L = 80 \, \text{cal/g} \) (latent heat of fusion for ice),  
   - \( m \) is the mass of ice melted.  

   Setting \( Q_{\text{lead}} = Q_{\text{ice}} \):  
   \[
   1500 = m \cdot 80.
   \]

   Solving for \( m \):  
   \[
   m = \frac{1500}{80} = 18.75 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The amount of ice melted is \( 18.75 \, \text{g} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
