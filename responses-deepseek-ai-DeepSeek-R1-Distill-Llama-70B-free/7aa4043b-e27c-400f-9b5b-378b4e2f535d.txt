Okay, so I've got this question about the differences between psychotic and neurotic depressions. Hmm, I remember that depression can manifest in different ways, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact distinctions between these two terms. Let me try to break it down.

First, I think I should recall what each term means. Neurotic depression, I believe, is a term sometimes used to describe what's now more commonly referred to as major depressive disorder without psychotic features. It's more about the emotional and psychological symptoms like sadness, guilt, and anxiety. On the other hand, psychotic depression involves psychotic symptoms, which I think includes things like hallucinations and delusions. So, in psychotic depression, the person might hear voices or have delusional thoughts that aren't based in reality.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says there's no difference. That doesn't seem right because I remember they are distinct in terms of symptoms.

Option B suggests neurotic can lead to psychotic breaks, but not the other way. I'm not sure about that. I think sometimes severe depression can lead to psychotic symptoms, but I'm not certain if it's a one-way street.

Option C claims psychotic is milder than neurotic. That doesn't make sense because having psychotic symptoms sounds more severe to me. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D talks about treatment responses. I think psychotic depression might require more intensive treatment, possibly medication or even ECT, while neurotic might respond to psychotherapy. So D says the opposite, so probably wrong.

Option E says neurotic have psychosis and psychotic have neurosis, which sounds backwards. So E is incorrect.

Option F states that psychotic have hallucinations, which aligns with what I thought. Neurotic don't, so F could be correct, but I need to check the other options.

Option G says neurotic is more severe. I don't think that's right. Psychotic symptoms usually indicate a more severe form.

Option H says the main difference is delusions in psychotic, and the quantitative aspect is more severe symptoms. That makes sense because the qualitative difference would be the presence of psychosis, and quantitatively, the typical depressive symptoms are worse.

Option I says psychotic are aware of their irrational thoughts. Wait, no, in psychosis, people often don't realize their thoughts are irrational. So I think I is wrong.

Option J talks about physical vs mental, which doesn't fit because both are mental disorders but might have physical symptoms. So J is incorrect.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be H. It correctly states that the qualitative difference is the presence of delusions in psychotic, and the quantitative aspect is that the common symptoms are more severe in psychotic depression.

The correct answer is H. Psychotic depression is distinguished from neurotic depression by the presence of psychotic symptoms such as delusions, which are absent in neurotic depression. Additionally, the severity of common depressive symptoms is greater in psychotic depression.
