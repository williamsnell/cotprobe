Question:

Describe shadowing. How is it used in studies ofattention ?

Options:

A: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to memorize a series of words.
B: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a series of words is read to the subject, and the subject is asked to repeat everything she hears out loud.
C: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to observe a person's behavior and mimic their actions.
D: 'Shadowing' is a process where a subject is exposed to visual stimuli and must identify the objects casting shadows.
E: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject hears two different conversations in each ear and must focus on one to report back.
F: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a series of words is read to the subject, and the subject is asked to write everything she hears.
G: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to translate a series of words.
H: 'Shadowing' is a cognitive task where a subject is presented with shapes and must draw the corresponding shadows.
I: 'Shadowing' is a method where a subject is asked to listen to a conversation and then provide a summary afterward.
J: 'Shadowing' is a technique where a subject is asked to recognize patterns in shadows to test perceptual abilities.

Okay, so I have this question about shadowing and its use in attention studies. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that shadowing is a technique used in psychological experiments, especially related to attention and perception. The key here is to recall what exactly shadowing entails.

I think shadowing involves some kind of auditory task. Maybe it's when a person repeats what they hear. Oh right, I've heard about dichotic listening tasks where two different messages are played in each ear. That rings a bell. So in such experiments, the participant is supposed to focus on one message and ignore the other. 

Wait, shadowing is when the participant repeats the message they're focusing on. So if each ear gets a different conversation, the person shadows (repeats) the one they're supposed to attend to. This helps researchers see how well they can focus on one task while ignoring distractions, which is a measure of selective attention.

Looking at the options, let me go through them. Option E says the subject hears two different conversations in each ear and must focus on one to report back. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. So E seems correct.

But let me check the other options to be sure. Option B is about repeating everything heard out loud, but it doesn't mention two conversations, so it's probably not the right context for attention studies. Option A is memorization, which doesn't fit. Option C is about observing behavior, which is more like mimicry, not shadowing in this context. Option D is visual with shadows, which is unrelated. Options F and G involve writing and translating, which don't align with the auditory task. Option H is about drawing shadows, again unrelated. I and J are about summarizing and perceiving patterns, which don't fit the shadowing technique in attention studies.

So yes, E is the correct answer. It accurately describes shadowing as hearing two conversations and focusing on one, which is used to study attention.

Shadowing is a technique used in psychological studies, particularly in the context of attention research. It involves presenting a participant with two different auditory stimuli, typically conversations, one in each ear. The participant is instructed to focus on one conversation and repeat it aloud, a process known as shadowing. This method is employed to assess selective attention, as it requires the participant to concentrate on one stimulus while ignoring the other. Among the given options, the correct description of shadowing in attention studies is provided by option E.

Answer: E
