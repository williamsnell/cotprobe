Okay, so I've got this question about grieving individuals and how many might need professional help. Hmm, I remember studying a bit about bereavement and grief reactions. Let me think.

I think most people can handle their grief with support from friends and family, right? But some might struggle more and need help. I recall something about a percentage. Was it around 10%? Or maybe 15%? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number.

Wait, I think the general idea is that a small minority of people experience complicated grief. Oh right, complicated grief is when the grieving process is prolonged and severe, interfering with daily life. Studies suggest that about 10-15% might fall into that category.

Looking at the options, D is less than 10%, E is about 15%. So maybe the answer is around 10-15%, but the options don't have 10-15 as a choice. Wait, the question says "seem to require some professional help." If it's about 10%, then D is less than 10%, but E is about 15%. Which is closer?

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the figures. I think the commonly cited statistic is that about 10% of bereaved individuals might need professional help. So that would make D the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the numbers can vary depending on the population. For example, if the loss was sudden or traumatic, maybe more people need help, but on average, it's lower. So I think the standard answer is around 10%, so D would be the choice.
