Alright, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

Okay, the problem says that saturated steam at 1.5 standard atmospheres is flowing through a porous flat plate. On the other side, air at 700°C and 1 standard atmosphere is flowing over the plate. The air-side heat transfer coefficient is 200 Btu/hr·ft²·°F when there's no steam flowing. The questions are (a) to find the steam flow rate needed to keep the surface at 300°C, and (b) what the flow rate would be if water at 30°C is used instead.

Hmm, I think this is about heat transfer involving phase change, maybe something to do with convection and evaporation or condensation. Since it's a porous plate, the steam is passing through while the air is flowing on the other side.

Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. Heat transfer can occur through conduction, convection, and radiation. But in this case, since we're dealing with a fluid (steam/air) on both sides, convection is probably the main mechanism.

Wait, but when a fluid flows through a porous medium, maybe it's a bit different. Oh right, the plate is porous, so the steam is flowing through it. So the steam is on one side, and the air is on the other, both contributing to the heat transfer.

The key here is probably the heat exchanger equation or something related to convective heat transfer with phase change. Oh, right, the effectiveness-NTU method comes to mind, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, no, maybe it's more about the heat flux. The heat lost by the air should equal the heat gained by the steam, considering any phase change if applicable.

Wait, but first, I think I should figure out the temperature differences and the heat transfer coefficients on both sides.

So the air is at 700°C, and the surface is at 300°C. So the air is hotter than the surface. So heat will flow from the air to the surface, and from the surface into the steam.

Wait, but the steam is flowing through the plate. So the surface is the boundary between the air and the steam. The plate is probably at 300°C.

Wait, but wait, the steam is saturated at 1.5 atm. What's the temperature of saturated steam at that pressure? I think I need to find that. Let me think: Standard atmospheric pressure is 1 atm, which is about 100°C for saturated steam. At higher pressures, the saturation temperature increases. So 1.5 atm would be higher than 100°C, maybe around 150°C? I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps I can look up or approximate the saturation temperature.

Wait, I should probably look up the exact saturation temperature for steam at 1.5 atm. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with an estimate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the steam is at 1.5 atm and is saturated, so when it passes through the plate, it might be condensing or something else. Wait, but if the plate is at 300°C, which is higher than the steam's saturation temperature, then the steam would actually vaporize more, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the steam is condensing because the surface is hotter than the steam's temperature.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the steam is at 1.5 atm, its saturation temperature is higher than 100°C. Let me see: At 1 atm, it's 100°C. At 1.5 atm, perhaps around 150°C? Maybe I should calculate it more accurately, but without exact tables, I'll proceed with T_sat = 111°C for 1.5 atm? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. At 1 atm, 100°C. At 2 atm, about 120°C. So 1.5 atm would be somewhere between 100 and 120, maybe around 112°C? I'm not certain, but perhaps I should proceed with that assumption for now.

Wait, but the surface is at 300°C, which is much higher than the steam's saturation temperature. So if the steam comes into contact with a surface at 300°C, it would actually cause the steam to superheat, right? Because the steam is at its boiling point at 1.5 atm, but the surface is hotter, so it would absorb heat and the steam would become superheated vapor. Alternatively, perhaps the steam is condensing? No, wait, when a vapor contacts a surface at a higher temperature than its saturation temperature, it would not condense; instead, it might heat up, but wait, no, that's not possible because the vapor would gain heat and become superheated.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the surface is at 300°C, and the steam is at a lower temperature (say, 120°C at 1.5 atm), then heat would flow from the surface to the steam, causing the steam to heat up beyond its saturation temperature, becoming superheated. But wait, that doesn't involve any phase change because the steam is already a gas. Unless the steam is in a liquid state, but the problem says it's saturated steam, which is a vapor. So perhaps the steam doesn't undergo phase change here but just heats up.

Wait, but the problem is about the flow rate of steam required to keep the surface at 300°C. So perhaps the heat from the air is being used to heat up the steam. Or maybe the steam is being cooled, but that depends on the temperatures.

Wait, the air is at 700°C, which is much hotter than the surface at 300°C. So the air will lose heat to the surface, which in turn transfers heat to the steam. So the heat lost by the air equals the heat gained by the steam. Or perhaps, when the steam flows through the plate, it's absorbing heat from the surface, which is being heated by the air.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to model this. Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the heat transfer from the air to the surface.
2. Determine the heat transfer from the surface to the steam.
3. Since the surface is at steady state, the heat from air to surface equals heat from surface to steam.

Wait, but the surface's heat transfer involves convection on both sides. So the heat flux from the air to the surface is Q_air = h_air * A * (T_air - T_surface), where h_air is the heat transfer coefficient on the air side.

Similarly, the heat flux from the surface to the steam is Q_steam = h_steam * A * (T_surface - T_steam_sat), where T_steam_sat is the saturation temperature of steam at 1.5 atm.

Wait, but if the steam is flowing through the plate, perhaps the heat transfer is not just convection. Wait, but when a fluid flows through a porous medium, the heat transfer might involve convection as well. Alternatively, perhaps the steam side is treated as another convection heat transfer, but maybe with a different coefficient.

Wait, but the problem gives the air-side heat transfer coefficient as 200 Btu/hr·ft²·°F when there's no steam flowing. So when steam is flowing, perhaps the overall heat transfer changes. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the steam side's heat transfer coefficient is determined by its flow properties.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of energy balance. The heat lost by the air is equal to the heat gained by the steam.

So:

Q_air = Q_steam

Where Q_air is the heat lost by the air, and Q_steam is the heat gained by the steam.

Wait, but the air is at 700°C, surface at 300°C, so heat flows from air to surface. Then, the surface transfers heat to the steam, which would be at a lower temperature than 300°C, so heat flows into the steam.

So Q_air = h_air * A * (T_air - T_surface) = h_steam * A * (T_surface - T_steam_sat) * m_steam * c_steam

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Let me think again. The heat flux from the air to the surface is per unit area, and similarly from the surface to the steam.

Wait, perhaps I should consider this using the overall heat transfer coefficient, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the heat transfer from the air to the surface is via convection, and the heat transfer from the surface to the steam is via convection as well. So:

Q = h_air * A * (T_air - T_surface) = h_steam * A * (T_surface - T_steam) * m_steam * c_p_steam

Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right. Wait, the heat transfer rate from the surface to the steam would involve the mass flow rate of the steam, its specific heat, and the temperature change.

Wait, let me clarify. The heat lost by the air is h_air * A * (T_air - T_surface). This heat is conducted through the plate and transferred to the steam. So the heat gained by the steam is the mass flow rate of the steam (m_dot) multiplied by the specific heat (c_p) and the temperature change (T_surface - T_steam_in). But wait, is the steam being heated from its initial temperature to the surface temperature?

But wait, if the steam is saturated at 1.5 atm, its temperature is T_sat. If the surface is at 300°C, which is higher than T_sat, then the steam will absorb heat, increasing its temperature beyond T_sat, becoming superheated steam. So the temperature change would be (T_surface - T_sat_steam).

But then the heat transfer rate would be m_dot * c_p_steam * (T_surface - T_sat_steam).

So putting it together:

h_air * A * (T_air - T_surface) = m_dot * c_p_steam * (T_surface - T_sat_steam)

Wait, but wait, the heat transfer from the air to the surface is h_air * (T_air - T_surface), and the heat transfer from the surface to the steam is h_steam * (T_surface - T_steam). But in this case, the steam's temperature is T_sat_steam, since it's saturated, and then it's being heated to T_surface. So the temperature difference on the steam side is (T_surface - T_sat_steam). But without knowing h_steam, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the heat transfer on the steam side is through convection as well, but the problem doesn't provide the steam-side heat transfer coefficient. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the flow of steam through the porous plate is such that the heat transfer is modeled differently. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the steam is condensing on the surface, but that doesn't make sense because the surface is at 300°C, which is higher than the steam's saturation temperature at 1.5 atm. So if the steam is at a lower temperature than the surface, it would gain heat and become superheated, not condense.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem might be about boiling or condensation. Wait, but it's a flat plate, and steam is flowing through it, so maybe it's a case of forced convection with phase change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the steam as it flows through the plate, causing a temperature drop on the surface. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is to use the heat transfer coefficients on both sides. The overall heat transfer coefficient U is given by 1/U = 1/h_air + 1/h_steam, but I'm not sure if that applies here because the plate is porous, and the steam is flowing through it. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the heat transfer from the surface to the steam is through convection, and the heat transfer coefficient on the steam side is determined by the flow rate.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach it step by step.

First, find the saturation temperature of steam at 1.5 atm. Let me look that up. Wait, I don't have exact values, but I can approximate. At 1 atm, it's 100°C. At 1.5 atm, it's higher. Let me see, maybe around 111°C? Or perhaps higher. Alternatively, I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to estimate it, but that might be too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the saturation temperature as 100°C, but that doesn't make sense because 1.5 atm would have a higher saturation temperature. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with T_sat = 120°C for 1.5 atm. That might be a better approximation. So T_surface is 300°C. So the steam, being at 120°C, will absorb heat from the surface, heating up to a higher temperature. Wait, but if the steam is at 120°C and the surface is 300°C, then the steam would gain heat, becoming superheated.

Wait, but maybe the steam is entering at a lower temperature than the surface, so it's absorbing heat. Thus, the heat gained by the steam is m_dot * c_p * (T_surface - T_sat).

But then, the heat lost by the air is h_air * (T_air - T_surface). So equating the two:

h_air * (T_air - T_surface) = m_dot * c_p * (T_surface - T_sat)

Rearranging to solve for m_dot:

m_dot = [h_air * (T_air - T_surface)] / [c_p * (T_surface - T_sat)]

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Because the heat transfer from the surface to the steam is via convection, so perhaps it's h_steam * (T_surface - T_sat_steam). But I don't know h_steam. Alternatively, perhaps the heat transfer from the surface to the steam is by conduction and then convection away by the steam.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the heat transfer from the air to the surface is via convection, and the heat transfer from the surface to the steam is also via convection. So the heat flux from air to surface is Q = h_air * (T_air - T_surface), and the heat flux from surface to steam is Q = h_steam * (T_surface - T_steam).

But since these are both steady-state heat fluxes, they should be equal. So:

h_air * (T_air - T_surface) = h_steam * (T_surface - T_steam)

But I don't know h_steam. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the steam is flowing such that the heat transfer is determined by its mass flow rate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the heat transfer on both sides as:

Q = (U * A * ΔT), where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient. But without knowing U, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of critical heat flux or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of energy balance. The heat lost by the air equals the heat gained by the steam. So:

m_air * c_p_air * (T_air - T_surface) = m_steam * (h_fg) 

Wait, but that would be the case if the steam is condensing. Wait, no, because if steam is condensing, it would release heat. But in our case, the surface is hotter than the steam's saturation temperature, so the steam would be absorbing heat and becoming superheated, not condensing.

Wait, perhaps I got it wrong. Maybe the steam is condensing, but that would require the surface temperature to be higher than the steam's saturation temperature. Wait no, if the steam is at a lower temperature than the surface, it would absorb heat, not release it. So, for condensation to occur, the surface would have to be at a higher temperature than the steam's saturation temperature, which is the opposite of what's needed. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the steam is flowing through the plate, and as it does so, it's absorbing heat from the plate, which is being heated by the air. So the heat from the air is making the plate hot, and the steam is cooling the plate by absorbing heat.

In that case, the heat lost by the air would equal the heat gained by the steam.

So, Q = h_air * A * (T_air - T_surface) = m_dot * c_p_steam * (T_surface - T_steam_in)

But T_steam_in would be the saturation temperature at 1.5 atm, which I'm approximating as T_sat. So T_surface is 300°C, and T_sat is, say, 120°C, so the temperature difference is 180°C.

Wait, but the problem gives the air-side heat transfer coefficient as 200 Btu/hr·ft²·°F when there's no steam flowing. So when steam is flowing, perhaps the overall heat transfer changes. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of steam doesn't affect the air-side coefficient, so we can use that value.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. First, convert temperatures to a consistent unit. Let's use °F for consistency with the given units.

Wait, 700°C is 700 + 273.15 = 973.15 K, but to convert to °F: 700°C is 700*(9/5) +32 = 1330°F. Similarly, 300°C is 300*(9/5)+32 = 572°F.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the conversion from °C to °F is (°C × 9/5) + 32. So yes, 700°C is (700 × 1.8) +32 = 1330°F, and 300°C is (300 × 1.8) +32 = 572°F.

Wait, but the problem is set in English units, so using °F makes sense.

Now, the saturation temperature of steam at 1.5 atm. Let me look up the exact value. Wait, I don't have a steam table here, but I can approximate. At 1 atm, it's 212°F. At 1.5 atm, higher. Let me see, I think at 1.5 atm, the saturation temperature is around 240°F. Maybe I can check that: 1 atm is 212°F, 2 atm is 240°F (I think), so 1.5 atm would be somewhere between, maybe 225°F? Wait, perhaps I should make a better estimation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for every atmosphere increase, the saturation temperature increases by about 30°F (this is a rough estimate). So 1 atm is 212°F, 1.5 atm would be about 212 + (0.5 * 30) = 212 +15 = 227°F
