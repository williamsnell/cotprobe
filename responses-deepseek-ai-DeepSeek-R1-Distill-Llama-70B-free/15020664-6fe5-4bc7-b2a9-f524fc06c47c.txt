Okay, so I've got this problem about natural convection heat transfer, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking me to compute the natural convective heat transfer coefficient for a vertical plate. Let me see what I remember.

First, natural convection happens when there's a temperature difference causing fluid movement due to density differences. So, the plate is heated on one side, and the other side is in contact with air. The setup is vertical, which probably affects the formula used.

The plate is 8 inches from the bottom, but wait, in natural convection for vertical plates, the characteristic length is usually the height, right? So maybe it's 8 inches, but I should convert that to feet because the answer options are in ft². 8 inches is 8/12 = 0.666... feet, approximately 0.6667 feet.

The temperatures are given: the plate is at 200°F, and the air is at 68°F. So the temperature difference is 200 - 68 = 132°F.

I remember that the heat transfer coefficient (h) for natural convection can be found using correlations, often the Grashof number and then relating to Nusselt number. The formula for the Nusselt number (Nu) is something like Nu = C * (Gr)^a * (Pr)^b, where C, a, b are constants depending on the geometry and flow regime.

Wait, for vertical plates, the correlation I think is Nu = 0.67 * (Gr * Pr)^1/4 for laminar flow, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: for vertical surfaces, the average Nu can be calculated as Nu = (4/3) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) * [1 + (Pr^(1/3)/9)]^(-1/4) or something like that. Or perhaps I should use the Churchill and Chu correlation, which I think covers a broader range.

Oh wait, the Churchill and Chu equation for a vertical plate is Nu = ( (Gr * Pr)^2 + (0.861 Pr)^2 )^(1/2)/( (Gr Pr)^0.5 )) ) Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Another approach: for vertical plates, the general formula is:

Nu = C * (Gr * Pr)^m

Where C and m depend on the Prandtl number. Alternatively, for air, which has a Pr around 0.7, I think the exponent for Gr is 1/4.

Wait, let me think. For vertical plates, the standard formula I remember is:

h = (k / L) * Nu

Where Nu = 0.67 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4), and this is for laminar flow, which for vertical plates typically occurs when Gr * Pr is less than 1e9 or something like that.

So first, I need to compute Gr, the Grashof number, which is Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν^2.

Wait, but what's β for air? Since β is the volume expansion coefficient, which is approximately 1/T for air when using absolute temperature. But wait, the temperatures here are in Fahrenheit, so I need to convert them to Rankine to compute β in consistent units.

Hmm, let's see. Air properties: at 68°F, which is 68 + 459.67 = 527.67 R. So β = 1 / T_abs (in Rankine).

Then, g is the acceleration due to gravity. In English units, g is 32.174 ft/s².

The kinematic viscosity ν for air at around 68°F. I think at 70°F, ν is about 0.000016 ft²/s. Wait, let me double-check. At 60°F, it's about 0.0000158, and at 70°F, maybe 0.0000166 ft²/s? I'm not certain. Maybe I should use an approximate value, say 0.0000165 ft²/s.

The thermal conductivity k of air at 68°F is around 0.014 Btu/hr-ft-°F. I think that's correct.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Convert temperatures to absolute (Rankine): T_plate = 200°F = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 R. T_air = 68°F = 68 + 459.67 = 527.67 R. ΔT = 200 - 68 = 132°F.

2. Compute β: β = 1 / T_air (since T is in Rankine), so β = 1 / 527.67 ≈ 0.001895 R^-1.

3. Compute L: given as 8 inches, which is 8/12 = 0.6667 feet.

4. Compute Grashof number: Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

Let me plug in the numbers.

g = 32.17 ft/s².

ΔT = 132°F, but wait, since ΔT is in the same units as T, which is Rankine, or does it? Wait, no, because in Gr, the ΔT is in absolute units. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of ΔT = T_s - T_inf, which for air, is 200 F to 68 F, so 132 F. But absolute is needed, so 132 F is 132 * 5/9 = 73.33 K? Wait, no, because in Rankine, it's 200 R to 68 R, so ΔT = 132 R.

Wait, not quite. Because ΔT is (T_surface - T_fluid) = (659.67 - 527.67) = 132 R. So that's correct.

So substituting:

Gr = (32.17) * (0.001895) * (132) * (0.6667)^3 / (ν)^2.

Wait, but let me compute each term step by step:

Calculate numerator: 32.17 * 0.001895 = let's see, 32 * 0.0019 is approximately 0.0608. But precise calculation: 32.17 * 0.001895.

32.17 * 0.001 = 0.03217. 32.17 * 0.000895 = ?

0.0008 * 32.17 = 0.025736. 0.000095 * 32.17 = approx 0.003057. So total 0.025736 + 0.003057 = 0.028793. So total numerator part: 0.03217 + 0.028793 = 0.060963.

Multiply by ΔT (132): 0.060963 * 132 ≈ let's compute 0.06 * 132 = 7.92, 0.000963*132≈0.127. So total ≈ 8.047.

Multiply by L^3: L is 0.6667 ft, so (0.6667)^3 ≈ (2/3)^3 = 8/27 ≈ 0.2963. So 8.047 * 0.2963 ≈ let's compute 8 *0.3=2.4, but precise: 8.047 * 0.2963.

≈ 8 * 0.2963 = 2.3704, and 0.047 * 0.2963 ≈ 0.01393. So total ≈ 2.384.

So numerator for Gr is approximately 2.384.

Denominator: ν^2. If ν is 0.0000165 ft²/s, then ν^2 = (0.0000165)^2 = 2.7225e-10.

So Gr = 2.384 / 2.7225e-10 ≈ let's compute 2.384 / 2.7225e-10.

First, 2.384 / 2.7225 ≈ 0.876. So Gr ≈ 0.876 / 1e-10 = 8.76e9.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2.384 divided by 2.7225e-10 is equal to 2.384 / 2.7225e-10 = (2.384 / 2.7225) ) * 1e10.

2.384 / 2.7225 ≈ 0.876, so 0.876e10 = 8.76e9.

So Gr ≈ 8.76e9.

Now, I need to compute the Prandtl number (Pr) for air at 68°F. Pr for air is around 0.7, but let me think. At room temperature, Pr is about 0.701, so we'll go with 0.7.

Now, the Nusselt number. For vertical plates, when Gr*Pr is in the laminar range, which is when Gr*Pr < 1e9? Or up to 1e12? Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think for vertical plates, the correlation is that Nu = 0.67*(Gr*Pr)^(1/4) for 1e9 < Gr*Pr < 1e13, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the Churchill and Chu correlation for vertical plates uses a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the general correlation for a vertical plate is:

Nu = ( (Gr Pr)^2 + (0.861 Pr)^2 )^(1/2) ) / (Gr Pr)^(1/2) * ... Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use the simplified formula for vertical plates.

Wait, the standard formula for vertical plates is:

Nu = 0.67 (Gr Pr)^(1/4) when Gr Pr is between 1e9 and 1e13, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, for air (Pr ~0.7), the exponent might be different.

Wait, alternatively, the formula is:

h = 0.0254 (ΔT/(L))^(1/4) * (Pr)^(1/3) * (k / L)

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the formula. Let me get this straight.

The Nusselt number for a vertical plate in natural convection is given by:

Nu = C (Gr Pr)^m

Where C and m depend on the Prandtl number. For air, which has Pr ≈ 0.7, the constants are often given as C = 0.67 and m = 1/4.

So, plugging in the values, Nu = 0.67 * (Gr Pr)^(1/4).

We have Gr = 8.76e9, Pr = 0.7, so Gr Pr = 8.76e9 * 0.7 = 6.132e9.

Then, Nu = 0.67 * (6.132e9)^(1/4).

Compute (6.132e9)^(1/4). Let's compute step by step.

First, 6.132e9 = 6.132 * 10^9.

Take the fourth root: (6.132)^(1/4) * (1e9)^(1/4).

1e9 is (1e3)^3, so 1e9^(1/4) = (1e3)^(3/4) = 10^(9/4) = 10^(2.25) = approx 177.8279.

Wait, wait, no. 1e9 is 10^9, so the fourth root is 10^(9/4) = 10^2.25.

10^2 = 100, 10^0.25 ≈ 1.778. So 100 * 1.778 ≈ 177.8.

Then, (6.132)^(1/4): Let's compute 6.132^(0.25). Let me think. Square root of 6 is about 2.449, square root of 2.449 is about 1.565. So approximately 1.565. But perhaps more accurately.

Alternatively, 6.132^(1/4) = e^( (1/4) * ln(6.132) )

ln(6.132) ≈ 1.813, so 1/4 *1.813 ≈ 0.453. e^0.453 ≈ 1.573.

So, 6.132^(1/4) ≈ 1.573.

So, (6.132e9)^(1/4) ≈ 1.573 * 177.8 ≈ 279.2.

So Nu ≈ 0.67 * 279.2 ≈ 0.67 * 280 ≈ 187.6.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, alternative approach: let me compute (6.132e9)^(1/4) using logarithms.

log10(6.132e9) = log10(6.132) + 9 ≈ 0.787 +9 = 9.787.

Divide by 4: 9.787 /4 ≈ 2.4468.

10^2.4468 = 10^0.4468 * 10^2 = 2.8 * 100 = 280. So yes, that's correct.

So Nu ≈ 0.67 * 280 ≈ 187.6.

Then, h = (k / L) * Nu.

We have k = 0.014 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

L = 0.6667 ft.

So h = (0.014 / 0.6667) * 187.6.

Compute 0.014 / 0.6667 ≈ 0.021.

Then, 0.021 * 187.6 ≈ 3.9396 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, that's way higher than the options given. The options are all below 1.08. So clearly, I've messed up somewhere.

Hmm. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe I should have used the correlation for a vertical plate differently. Let me think again.

Another possibility is that the formula for h is h = (k / (L)) * Nu.

But perhaps I should have used the formula correctly.

Wait, let's recalculate the Grashof number. Maybe my calculation was wrong there.

Wait, Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L³) / ν².

Wait, let's compute each term again.

g = 32.17 ft/s².

β = 1 / T_air (Rankine) = 1/527.67 ≈ 0.001895 R⁻¹.

ΔT = T_s - T_air = 200 F - 68 F = 132 F, which is 132 R.

L = 0.6667 ft.

ν for air at 68 F is approximately 0.0000165 ft²/s.

So:

g * β = 32.17 * 0.001895 ≈ 0.06096.

Multiply by ΔT (132 R): 0.06096 * 132 ≈ 8.047.

Multiply by L³ (0.6667)^3 ≈ 0.2963. So 8.047 * 0.2963 ≈ 2.384.

Divide by ν²: (0.0000165)^2 = 2.7225e-10.

So Gr = 2.384 / 2.7225e-10 ≈ 8.76e9.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Pr for air is 0.7.

So Gr * Pr = 8.76e9 * 0.7 = 6.132e9.

Now, Nu = 0.67 * (6.132e9)^(1/4).

Which we calculated as approximately 0.67 * 280 = 187.6.

Then, h = (k / L) * Nu = (0.014 / 0.6667) * 187.6.

0.014 / 0.6667 is approximately 0.021.

0.021 * 187.6 ≈ 3.94.

But the options are much lower. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula for Nu.

Wait, maybe the formula uses (Gr*Pr)^(1/4) but with a different coefficient. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong correlation.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should use a different correlation for vertical plates, such as the one that uses the Rayleigh number, which is Ra = Gr * Pr.

So Ra = 6.132e9.

Then, the correlation for vertical surfaces is:

Nu = 0.68 (Ra)^(1/4) for 1e9 < Ra < 1e13.

Wait, same as what I did before.

So that gives Nu ≈ 0.68 * (6.132e9)^(1/4).

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the fourth root. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute (6.132e9)^(1/4):

We can write 6.132e9 as 6.132 * 10^9.

Take the fourth root:

(6.132)^(1/4) = e^( (1/4)*ln(6.132) )

ln(6.132) ≈ 1.813.

So (1/4)*1.813 ≈ 0.453.

e^0.453 ≈ 1.574.

(10^9)^(1/4) = 10^(9/4) = 10^2.25 = about 177.8279.

So total is 1.574 * 177.8279 ≈ 280. So same as before.

So Nu = 0.68 * 280 ≈ 190.4.

h = 0.014 / 0.6667 * 190.4 ≈ 0.021 * 190.4 ≈ 4.0 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

But that's still way higher than the options given. Hmm. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe I should instead use the formula for a vertical plate with a different coefficient.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for Nu is Nu = 0.25*(Gr*Pr)^(1/4) for vertical plates? No, I don't think so. Because I recall that for horizontal cylinders, the coefficient is different, but for vertical plates, 0.67 is the correct coefficient for the laminar regime.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine for the temperature difference. Wait, ΔT is 132 F, but in absolute terms, it's 132 R. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Gr. Let me recheck.

Gr = g * β * ΔT * L³ / ν².

g = 32
