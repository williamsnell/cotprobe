Okay, so I've got this question about car insurance, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says. 

Tom Patrick ran a red light and his car hit another car, injuring five people. The court made him pay them different amounts: $27,000, $14,000, $6,000, $5,000, and $2,700. Now, the question is about his insurance. He has 50-and-100 bodily injury insurance. I need to figure out how much the insurance company paid.

Wait, I remember that in car insurance, the numbers like 50/100 refer to the coverage limits. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. So, I think the first number is the coverage per person, and the second is per accident. So 50 would be $50,000 per person, and 100 would be $100,000 per accident. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, no, I think it's per person and then per accident. So the first number is per person, and the second is the total per accident.

So each injured person can get up to $50,000, and the total for all in the accident can't exceed $100,000. But wait, the question says that Mr. Patrick has 50-and-100 bodily injury insurance. I think that's the same as 50/100, so $50k per person and $100k total per accident.

Now, let's look at the amounts he has to pay. The five people receive $27k, $14k, $6k, $5k, and $2.7k. So I need to add those up first to see the total. Let's calculate:

27,000 + 14,000 = 41,000
41,000 + 6,000 = 47,000
47,000 + 5,000 = 52,000
52,000 + 2,700 = 54,700

So the total is $54,700. But wait, the insurance coverage per accident is $100,000, which is higher than that. But each person's claim can't exceed $50,000. Let me check each individual amount.

Looking at the individual payouts: the first is $27,000, which is under $50k. The next is $14k, also under. Then $6k, $5k, and $2.7kâ€”all way below $50k. So each person's claim is within the per-person limit. 

So the insurance should cover all of these because each is under $50k, and the total is $54,700, which is under $100k. So the insurance company would pay the total amount, which is $54,700. 

But wait, let me make sure. Sometimes, the per-person limit is the maximum they'll pay for each person, but if the total is under the per-accident limit, they just pay each up to their limit. Since all individual claims are within the per-person limit and the total is within the per-accident limit, the insurance will cover the entire $54,700.

So looking at the options, option J is $54,700. That should be the correct answer.

The question involves determining how much Tom Patrick's insurance company will pay after he caused an accident, injuring five people. Mr. Patrick has 50-and-100 bodily injury insurance, which means the coverage limits are $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. 

The court-ordered payouts to the injured parties are $27,000, $14,000, $6,000, $5,000, and $2,700. Adding these amounts together gives a total of $54,700. 

Since each individual payout is below the $50,000 per-person limit and the total payout of $54,700 is below the $100,000 per-accident limit, the insurance company will cover the entire amount. Therefore, the insurance company pays $54,700.

The correct answer is J: $54,700.
