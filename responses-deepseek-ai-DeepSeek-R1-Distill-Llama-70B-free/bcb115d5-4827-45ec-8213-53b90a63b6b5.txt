Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the change in entropy when air is compressed polytropically. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that three kilograms of air are initially at 100 kPa and 300 K. They're then compressed polytropically with n = 2.56 to a final pressure of 500 kPa. I need to find the change in entropy using the three ideal gas equations. Oh wait, the question says to use the ideal gas equations, so I guess I can apply those along with the polytropic process relations.

First, I remember that entropy change for an ideal gas can be calculated using two different approaches: one involving temperature and volume, and another involving pressure and temperature. Since this is a polytropic process, the relation PV^n = constant should hold. So maybe I can find the final temperature first.

Wait, I also remember that for a polytropic process, the entropy change is zero only if the process is isentropic (which would be when n = γ, the heat capacity ratio). But since here n is 2.56, which I think is higher than γ for air. Air has γ around 1.4, right? So this process isn't isentropic, which means entropy does change.

But wait, no, maybe I should think again. In a polytropic process, whether entropy changes depends on the relation between n and γ. If n = γ, then the process is isentropic. Otherwise, there's a change in entropy. So since n is 2.56, which is greater than γ, this process will have an entropy increase or decrease? Hmm.

Well, maybe I should just calculate it step by step.

So the formula for entropy change when using the ideal gas law is ΔS = m [ Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ].

Wait, but I think another form is ΔS = m [ Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(V2/V1) ]. Hmm, which one should I use here? Maybe it's easier to go with the first one involving pressure and temperature.

But to use that, I need to find the final temperature T2. Because I know the initial state (P1, T1) and the final pressure P2. Also, since it's a polytropic process, the relation P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n holds.

Alternatively, another polytropic relation is (T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^((n-1)/n). Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, in a polytropic process, TV^(1-n) = constant. So T1 V1^(1-n) = T2 V2^(1-n).

Also, from the ideal gas law, PV = RT. So maybe I can express V in terms of T and P.

Let me try to find T2. From the polytropic equation, for the process:

P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n.

But from ideal gas, V1 = (m R T1)/P1, similarly V2 = (m R T2)/P2.

So substituting into the polytropic equation:

P1 [ (m R T1)/P1 ]^n = P2 [ (m R T2)/P2 ]^n.

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's see.

Let me write this as:

P1 * ( (m R T1) / P1 )^n = P2 * ( (m R T2) / P2 )^n.

Simplify each term:

Left side: (m R T1)^n * P1^(1 - n).

Right side: (m R T2)^n * P2^(1 - n).

Divide both sides by (m R)^n:

(T1)^n * P1^(1 - n) = (T2)^n * P2^(1 -n).

Let me rearrange terms to get T2 in terms of T1.

Divide both sides by P2^(1-n):

(T1^n)/(T2^n) = (P2^(1-n))/(P1^(1-n))).

Which can be written as (T1/T2)^n = (P2/P1)^(n-1).

Wait, maybe taking both sides to the 1/n power:

(T1/T2) = (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

So T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

Wait, no, let me do it again. Let's take the equation:

(T1^n)/(T2^n) = (P2^(n-1))/(P1^(n-1)) )

Which can be rearranged as:

(T1 / T2)^n = (P2 / P1)^(n-1)

Taking both sides to the 1/n power:

(T1/T2) = (P2/P1)^((n-1)/n )

So T2 = T1 * (P1/P2)^((n-1)/n )

Wait, because if (T1/T2) = (P2/P1)^(a), then T2 = T1 / (P2/P1)^a = T1 * (P1/P2)^a.

So yes. So substituting the values.

Given: P1 = 100 kPa, P2=500 kPa, n=2.56.

So (n-1)/n = (2.56-1)/2.56 = 1.56 / 2.56 ≈ 0.609375.

So T2 = 300 K * (100/500)^(0.609375)

Wait, 100/500 is 0.2.

So 0.2^0.609375. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 0.2^0.6 is approximately what? Let's see.

I can compute ln(0.2) ≈ -1.6094.

Multiply by 0.609375: -1.6094 * 0.609375 ≈ -0.9806.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.9806) ≈ 0.375.

So 0.2^0.609 ≈ 0.375.

So T2 ≈ 300 * 0.375 = 112.5 K.

Wait, that seems really low, but let me double-check.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you compress a gas, the temperature should increase, not decrease. Oh wait, wait, because when you increase pressure (from 100 to 500 kPa), for a polytropic process, if n > γ, then the temperature should increase, right? Because when n > γ, the process is like a compression with heat transfer out of the system, so maybe the temperature decreases. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. For an ideal gas, the relation between T and P in a polytropic process is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

So if (n-1)/n is positive, and since P2 > P1, then (P2/P1) >1, and raised to a positive exponent. So T2 would be higher than T1 if (n-1)/n is positive.

Wait, (n-1)/n is positive because n is 2.56, so yes.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me see:

(P2/P1) =5, since 500/100=5.

So (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n ) =5^(1.56/2.56)=5^(0.609375).

Wait a second! I think I made a mistake earlier. Because earlier, I thought (n-1)/n is 0.609, but I applied (P1/P2), which is 0.2. Oh! That's where the mistake is.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In the equation I derived: T2 = T1 * (P1/P2)^( (n-1)/n )

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Because when I took the equation:

(T1/T2)^n = (P2/P1)^(n−1)

So (T1/T2) = [ (P2/P1)^(n−1) ]^(1/n )

Which is (P2/P1)^( (n−1)/n )

So T2 = T1 / [ (P2/P1)^( (n−1)/n ) ] 

Which is T1 * (P1/P2)^( (n−1)/n )

So yes, correct.

So substituting, (n−1)/n =0.609375.

So (P1/P2) is 0.2.

So (0.2)^0.609375 ≈ 0.375, as before.

So T2=300 * 0.375=112.5 K.

Wait, but that would imply that the temperature is decreasing, which seems counterintuitive because when you compress a gas, usually the temperature increases. Hmm, perhaps it's because the process is with n=2.56, which is higher than gamma (~1.4). So when n>gamma, the process is like a compression where more heat is released, leading to lower temperatures? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the polytropic exponent and its relation to heat transfer. For n>gamma, the process is like isobaric? Or is it that when n>gamma, the process is like cooling during compression? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, let's recalculate (0.2) raised to 0.609375.

Wait, 0.2 is 1/5.

Take the natural log: ln(0.2) = -1.6094.

Multiply by 0.609375: -1.6094 * 0.609375 ≈ -0.9806.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.9806)= approximately 0.375.

Yes, so 0.2^0.609375 ≈ 0.375. So T2=112.5 K.

But that's a lower temperature than the initial 300 K. That seems odd because during compression, unless it's a very specific process, the temperature usually increases. Maybe with n>gamma, it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used (P2/P1) instead of (P1/P2) in the equation. Let me check the derivation again.

Wait, let's rederive the relation correctly.

From the polytropic process:

P1 V1^n = P2 V2^n.

From ideal gas: V1 = (m R T1)/P1, V2 = (m R T2)/P2.

Substituting:

P1 [ (m R T1)/P1 ]^n = P2 [ (m R T2)/P2 ]^n.

Simplify each side:

P1 * (m R T1)^n / P1^n = P2 * (m R T2)^n / P2^n.

So:

(m R T1)^n * P1^(1 -n) = (m R T2)^n * P2^(1 - n).

Divide both sides by (m R)^n:

T1^n P1^(1-n) = T2^n P2^(1-n).

Divide both sides by T2^n:

(T1/T2)^n = (P2^(1-n))/(P1^(1-n)) ) = (P1/P2)^(n-1).

Ah, okay, so (T1/T2)^n = (P1/P2)^(n-1).

Taking both sides to the 1/n power:

(T1/T2) = (P1/P2)^( (n-1)/n )

So T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify.

From (T1/T2)^n = (P1/P2)^(n-1).

Taking both sides to 1/n:

T1/T2 = (P1/P2)^( (n-1)/n )

So T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

Ah! I see my mistake. Earlier, I thought T2 = T1*(P1/P2)^(...), but it's actually (P2/P1) raised to that exponent.

So the correct expression is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^[(n−1)/n].

So substituting the values:

P2/P1 =500/100=5.

(n−1)/n= (2.56 -1)/2.56=1.56/2.56≈0.609375.

So 5^0.609375 ≈ ?

What is 5^0.6?

5^0.6 is e^(0.6 ln5). ln5≈1.6094.

So 0.6 *1.6094≈0.9656.

e^0.9656 ≈ 2.628.

Wait, but 5^0.609375 is slightly higher than 5^0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 5^(1.56/2.56) exactly.

Wait, 1.56/2.56=0.609375.

So 5^0.609375.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Compute ln(5^0.609375)=0.609375 * ln5 ≈0.609375 *1.6094≈0.609375 *1.6094.

Let me compute 0.6 *1.6094=0.96564.

0.009375 *1.6094≈0.01509.

So total is ≈0.96564+0.01509=0.98073.

So e^0.98073 ≈2.668.

So 5^0.609375≈2.668.

So T2=300 K *2.668≈800.4 K.

Ah, that makes more sense. So the temperature increases upon compression, as expected.

So now, T2 ≈800.4 K.

Now, knowing T1=300 K, T2≈800.4 K, P1=100 kPa, P2=500 kPa, and mass m=3 kg.

Now, to find the change in entropy, ΔS.

The formula for entropy change for an ideal gas is:

ΔS = m [ Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1) ]

Alternatively, it can also be written as:

ΔS = m [ Cv ln(T2/T1) + R ln(V2/V1) ]

But since I have T and P, the first form might be more convenient.

But wait, I need to make sure whether to use Cp or Cv. Let's go with the first formula, which uses Cp.

Now, what's the value of Cp for air? I think for air, at around room temperature, Cp is approximately 1.005 kJ/kg·K. But wait, specific gas constant R for air is about 0.287 kJ/kg·K.

Wait, but more precisely, R = 0.287 kJ/kg·K, and Cp = (γ/(γ-1)) R. Since γ for air is about 1.4, so Cp= (1.4/0.4)*0.287 = 3.5 *0.287 ≈1.0025 kJ/kg·K. So I can use 1.005 kJ/kg·K as an approximation.

So, Cp=1.005 kJ/kg·K, R=0.287 kJ/kg·K.

Now, let's compute each term.

First, ln(T2/T1) = ln(800.4/300) = ln(2.668) ≈0.980.

Wait, 800.4/300 is indeed 2.668. So ln(2.668)=0.980.

Then, ln(P2/P1)=ln(500/100)=ln(5)=1.6094.

So now,

ΔS = m [ Cp * ln(T2/T1) - R * ln(P2/P1) ]

Plugging in the values:

ΔS = 3 kg [ 1.005 kJ/kg·K * 0.98 - 0.287 kJ/kg·K * 1.6094 ]

Compute each part:

1.005 * 0.98 ≈0.985.

0.287 * 1.6094 ≈0.287 *1.6094.

Let me compute 0.287 *1.6 =0.4592.

0.287 *0.0094≈0.0027.

So total ≈0.4592 + 0.0027=0.4619.

So,

ΔS = 3 [ 0.985 - 0.4619 ] = 3 * (0.5231) ≈1.5693 kJ/K.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.57 kJ/°K.

Hmm, that's very close to this value.

So the correct answer should be option F:1.57 kJ/°K.

To calculate the change in entropy for the given polytropic compression process, we start by determining the final temperature \( T_2 \) using the polytropic relation:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{n-1}{n}}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( P_1 = 100 \, \text{kPa} \), \( P_2 = 500 \, \text{kPa} \)
- \( n = 2.56 \), \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \)

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{500}{100}\right)^{\frac{2.56-1}{2.56}} = 5^{0.609375}
\]

Using approximations:
\[
5^{0.609375} \approx 2.668 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_2 = 300 \times 2.668 \approx 800.4 \, \text{K}
\]

Next, the change in entropy for an ideal gas during a polytropic process is calculated using:

\[
\Delta S = m \left[ C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) \right]
\]

Where:
- \( m = 3 \, \text{kg} \)
- \( C_p \approx 1.005 \, \text{kJ/kg·K} \)
-
