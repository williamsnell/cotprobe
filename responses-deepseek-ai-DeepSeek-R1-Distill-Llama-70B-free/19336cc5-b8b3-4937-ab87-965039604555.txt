Question:

A resident of a state was the owner of a large tract of virgin forest. The resident conveyed the tract "to the people of the state in fee simple; provided, however, that if any portion of said tract shall ever be used or developed for any commercial purpose or otherwise converted from its natural state (with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes), then the grantor or his successors in interest may reenter as of the grantor's former estate. "Under state law, conveyances of real property to "the people" of the state are deemed to vest title in the state regarded as a legal entity, and custody over such property resides in an appointed official known as the director of environmental resources. The director granted a logging company the privilege to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract, together with incidental easements of way. The section that the logging company was to clear would be used for the development of a state recreational area. After the privilege was granted, the logging company proceeded to clear the timber, which he later sold for $10,000. When the resident learned that the logging company was cutting the timber and selling it, he notified the director to desist further exploitation of the land. In an ejectment action instituted by the resident against the state to recover the tract, what result would be expected?

Options:

A: The resident would succeed, because the logging company's selling of the timber would constitute an automatic termination of the state's fee interest.
B: The resident would not succeed, because the logging company was given permission by the state official to clear the timber.
C: The resident would not succeed, because the land was being used for recreational purposes, which was an exception in the original conveyance.
D: The resident would not succeed, as the tract was given to the people of the state without any restrictions.
E: The resident would succeed, because the logging company's actions amounted to commercial use of the land.
F: The resident would succeed, because the land was converted from its natural state for commercial purposes.
G: The resident would succeed, because the state did not have the right to grant the logging company the privilege to cut timber.
H: The resident would not succeed, because the reservation of the resident's right to terminate would be violative of the rule against perpetuities.
I: The resident would succeed, because the logging company's selling of the timber would entitle the resident to re-enter and terminate the grant to the state.
J: The resident would not succeed, because the director approved the clearing of the timber in order to develop the area for recreational purposes.

Okay, so I've got this question about property law, specifically dealing with future interests and conveyances. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that a resident conveyed a large tract of virgin forest "to the people of the state in fee simple." But there's a condition: if any part is used for commercial purposes or converted from its natural state, except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes, then the grantor (the resident) or his successors can reenter and take back the estate.

Under state law, when property is conveyed to "the people" of the state, the title vests in the state as a legal entity, and the director of environmental resources is in charge of it. So the director is the one managing the property.

Then, the director granted a logging company permission to cut timber on a remote part of the tract. They also got easements for access. The cleared area is for a state recreational area. The logging company sold the timber for $10,000. The resident found out and told the director to stop further exploitation. Now, the resident is suing the state in an ejectment action to get the tract back.

The question is what the outcome would be. The options are A through J.

First, I need to understand the type of estate created by the conveyance. The grant is to the people in fee simple, but with a condition that allows the grantor to reenter if certain conditions are met. That sounds like a fee simple determinable with a right of entry (or possibly a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent).

Wait, the language is "provided, however, that if..." which usually indicates a condition subsequent, giving the grantor the right to reenter. So it's a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

The condition is that if any portion is used or developed for any commercial purpose or converted from its natural state, except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. So the forbidden uses are commercial or conversion, except if it's for the three allowed purposes.

In this case, the logging company was allowed to cut timber, which they then sold for $10,000. So the question is whether this action triggers the condition.

The director allowed the logging for the purpose of developing a recreational area. So the end use is recreational, which is an exception. But wait, the logging itself is a commercial activity. The logging company is selling the timber, making a profit.

So the issue is whether the commercial activity (logging and selling timber) falls under the prohibited uses, even if the land is being developed for a recreational purpose.

The original conveyance's condition says that if the land is used for commercial purposes, the grantor can reenter. So the key is whether the logging and sale is a commercial use, regardless of the intended future use of the land.

Alternatively, is the commercial use a separate issue, or does the exception for recreational purposes cover the entire action?

Wait, the exception is for when the land is used for recreational, etc., purposes. So if the land is being converted from its natural state for a recreational purpose, that's allowed. But the act of logging (cutting timber) for profit might be considered a commercial use, even if the land's ultimate use is recreational.

So the condition is about the use or development for commercial purposes. The logging is for profit, so that's commercial. Even though the cleared land will be used for recreation, the act of logging is a commercial activity. So does that trigger the condition?

Another angle: the conveyance was to the state, so the state holds the fee. The director, as the custodian, granted the logging rights. But does the state have the authority to allow commercial use, or does the condition in the grant restrict that?

Wait, the grant's condition is a covenant that runs with the land. So any use that violates the condition would allow the grantor to exercise the right of entry.

So if the state allows a commercial use, like logging for profit, then the condition is breached. The fact that the land will later be used for recreation doesn't negate the commercial use that's happening now.

So the logging company is cutting timber and selling it, which is a commercial purpose. Therefore, the condition is triggered, and the grantor can reenter.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the resident would succeed because it's a commercial use. Option F says because the land was converted for commercial purposes. Option I says because the logging company's sale entitles the resident to reenter.

Option C says the resident wouldn't succeed because it's for recreational purposes. But the logging is commercial, even if the end use is recreational.

Option J says the resident wouldn't succeed because the director approved it for recreational development. But the commercial activity is separate.

So which is it? The key is whether the commercial use is a violation, regardless of the intended use.

I think the condition is breached because the logging is a commercial purpose. So the resident can reenter, so the ejectment action would succeed.

Looking at the options, option E says the company's actions were commercial use. Option F says the land was converted for commercial purposes. Option I says the sale allows reentry.

Wait, the condition is that if any portion is used or developed for any commercial purpose. So the act of logging (using the land) for commercial purposes is the breach.

So E is correct? Or F?

Wait, E says the logging's commercial use. F says the land was converted from natural state for commercial. The logging does both: using it for commercial and converting it (cutting trees) from natural state for commercial.

But the exception allows conversion for recreational, etc. So the conversion is allowed only if it's for those purposes. Here, the conversion is for recreational, but the use (logging) is commercial. So does the conversion fall under the exception, but the use does not?

Wait, the grant says "if any portion shall ever be used or developed for any commercial purpose or otherwise converted from its natural state (with exception for...)."

So the prohibited actions are either (1) use for commercial, or (2) conversion from natural state, except for the three purposes.

So the logging is both a use for commercial and a conversion. The conversion is for recreational, so it's allowed. But the use is commercial, which is prohibited.

So the condition is triggered because the land is being used for a commercial purpose, regardless of the conversion's purpose.

Thus, the resident can reenter. So the ejectment action would succeed.

Looking at the options, option E says the logging was commercial use. Option F says the land was converted for commercial. Hmm, but the conversion is for recreational, which is allowed. So the breach is the use, not the conversion.

So option E would be correct.

Wait, but option F says the land was converted from its natural state for commercial purposes. But in this case, the conversion (clearing) is for a recreational purpose. So the conversion is allowed. However, the use (logging) is commercial. So the condition is triggered by the use, not the conversion.

So the correct option is E.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option I says the logging company's selling entitles the resident to reenter. That's also correct, but the reasoning is the same as E.

Wait, let me re-read the options.

Option E: succeed because logging's commercial use.

Option F: succeed because converted for commercial.

Option I: succeed because sale entitles reentry.

Hmm, I think the condition is breached by the use for commercial purposes, regardless of the sale. The sale is evidence of the commercial use.

So option E is correct.

Wait, but looking again, option I says "selling... would entitle the resident to re-enter." That's more specific about the action (sale) triggering it. But the breach is the use for commercial purposes, which includes the logging and sale.

So either E or I could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the more precise answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps option F is incorrect because the conversion is for recreational. So F says the land was converted for commercial, which is not the case.

Wait, the question says the section was to be used for a recreational area. So the conversion (clearing) is for recreational, which is allowed. But the use (logging) is commercial. So the condition is triggered by the use, not the conversion.

Thus, the answer should be E.

Wait, but another thought: the state granted the logging company the right to cut timber, which was then sold. So the state allowed a commercial activity on the land. But the condition says that any commercial use triggers the right of reentry.

So yes, the condition is breached. Therefore, the resident can reenter.

So looking again, the options:

A: Automatic termination. But in a condition subsequent, the grantor must take action, so it's not automatic. So A is incorrect.

B: Permission by state official. But the condition is in the grant, so the state can't allow it without breaching. So B is incorrect.

C: Land being used for recreational, exception applies. No, because the logging is a commercial use. C is incorrect.

D: No restrictions. No, the grant had restrictions. D is incorrect.

E: Commercial use. Correct.

F: Converted for commercial. No, conversion was for recreational, so F is incorrect.

G: State lacks right to grant. Maybe, but the condition is about use, so even if the state granted it, the use itself is the problem. So G is a possible argument, but the main point is the use.

H: Rule against perpetuities. But the condition is a right of entry, which is valid. H is incorrect.

I: Sale entitles reentry. Similar to E, but perhaps E is broader.

J: Director approved for recreational. But the logging was commercial, so J is incorrect.

So the best answer is E or I. But wait, the condition is about use or development for commercial purposes. The logging (use) is commercial, even if the development is recreational.

So E is the correct option.
</think>

The resident conveyed a large tract of virgin forest "to the people of the state in fee simple" with a condition subsequent: if any portion of the land is used or developed for commercial purposes or converted from its natural state (except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes), the grantor retains the right to reenter and terminate the grant. Under state law, title vests in the state, and the director of environmental resources manages the property. The director allowed a logging company to cut timber on a remote portion of the tract, with the cleared land intended for a state recreational area. The logging company sold the timber for $10,000, prompting the resident to demand cessation of further exploitation and institute an ejectment action to recover the tract.

The key issue is whether the logging company's actions triggered the condition subsequent. The condition prohibits use or development for commercial purposes, regardless of whether the land is later used for an exempt purpose like recreation. Here, the logging and sale of timber constitute a commercial use, which violates the condition. The fact that the cleared land will be used for recreation does not negate the commercial nature of the logging activity. Therefore, the condition is breached, and the resident has the right to reenter and terminate the state's fee interest.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The termination is not automatic; it requires the grantor to exercise the right of entry.
- **B**: Incorrect. The state official's permission does not override the condition subsequent in the grant.
- **C**: Incorrect. While the land may ultimately be used for recreation, the logging itself is a commercial use that breaches the condition.
- **D**: Incorrect. The grant clearly includes restrictions on commercial use and conversion.
- **E**: Correct. The logging company's commercial use of the land (cutting and selling timber) triggers the condition subsequent.
- **F**: Incorrect. The conversion of the land is for recreational purposes, which is allowed under the exception.
- **G**: Incorrect. The issue is not the state's authority to grant the privilege but the commercial use of the land, which breaches the condition.
- **H**: Incorrect. The right of entry does not violate the rule against perpetuities.
- **I**: Incorrect. While the sale of timber is evidence of commercial use, the broader issue is the commercial use itself, not just the sale.
- **J**: Incorrect. The director's approval does not negate the commercial use, which violates the condition.

The best answer is **E**, as the logging company's commercial use of the land breaches the condition subsequent, allowing the resident to reenter and terminate the state's fee interest.

Answer: E
