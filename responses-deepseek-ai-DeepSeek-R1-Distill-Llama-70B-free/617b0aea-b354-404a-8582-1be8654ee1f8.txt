Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about monetarist viewpoints. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking which option represents a monetarist point of view. The options are A through J. I remember that monetarism is associated with Milton Friedman and his ideas about the money supply. So I need to think about what monetarists believe.

Monetarists focus on the money supply as a key factor in economic activity. One of their main arguments is that the money supply should grow steadily to accommodate economic growth, right? They believe in a steady, predictable increase to avoid inflation or deflation. So that might relate to option A, which says the money supply should be increased steadily. That sounds familiar.

Another key point is the velocity of money. Monetarists think that the velocity is stable. Velocity is how often money is spent, so if it's stable, changes in the money supply directly affect economic output. So if the velocity is unstable, that would contradict monetarist views. Looking at the options, option B says velocity is unstable. So B is probably not the correct answer.

Then there's the idea of crowding out. Crowding out happens when government borrowing increases interest rates, reducing private investment. Monetarists might have a view on this. Wait, I'm not too sure. I think monetarists might not see crowding out as a major issue because they focus more on monetary factors than fiscal. So option C says crowding out is not a problem, and H says it's the main problem. Hmm, I'm not certain, but maybe C is more aligned with monetarist views.

Inflation, according to monetarists, is caused by too much money chasing too few goods. So it's when the money supply increases too rapidly. That would mean inflation is primarily caused by an increase, not a decrease. Option D says it's caused by a decrease, so that's probably wrong. Option E says the money supply should be decreased to control inflation. That makes sense because reducing the money supply would lower inflation. But wait, monetarists might not necessarily advocate for decreasing the money supply, but rather keeping its growth steady. Or maybe they do support adjusting it when needed. I'm a bit confused here.

Option F says monetary policy has no impact. No, monetarists definitely believe monetary policy is important. So F is incorrect.

Option G claims fiscal policy is more effective. Monetarists usually argue that monetary policy is more effective, so G is probably wrong.

Option I suggests using monetary policy to fine-tune the economy. I think monetarists are skeptical of fine-tuning because they believe in the lags and uncertainties of policy. They prefer a steady, predictable policy instead of trying to adjust it frequently. So I might not be the correct answer.

Putting it all together, the main points I remember are that monetarists emphasize a steady increase in the money supply (A) and believe that the velocity is stable (so B is incorrect). They also think that inflation is caused by too much money, so they might support controlling it by adjusting the money supply, which could mean decreasing it if needed (E). But I'm not sure if E is a primary monetarist stance.

Wait, another thought. The monetarist view is often summarized as "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." So controlling inflation would involve monetary policy, specifically managing the money supply. So E says to decrease money supply to control inflation, which aligns with that.

But then the initial point about steady increase. Option A says the money supply should be increased steadily. Oh right, Friedman proposed a monetary rule where the money supply increases at a constant rate. So A is definitely a monetarist view.

Looking at the options again, the question is which is a monetarist point of view. So if the question is about what monetarists think, A is correct because they advocate for a steady increase. E is about controlling inflation, which is part of their approach, but the primary stance is the steady growth.

So the correct answer should be A.

The monetarist point of view is most closely associated with the idea that the money supply should be increased steadily to accommodate economic growth, as proposed by Milton Friedman. This approach emphasizes predictable monetary policy to avoid inflation or deflation. Among the options provided, option A aligns with this core monetarist belief. Other options, such as B (unstable velocity of money) and G (fiscal policy being more effective), contradict monetarist principles, while E (decreasing money supply to control inflation) is a potential monetarist approach but not the primary stance. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A
