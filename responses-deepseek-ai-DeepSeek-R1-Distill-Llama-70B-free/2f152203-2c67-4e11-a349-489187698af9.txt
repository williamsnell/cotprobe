Okay, so I have this question about the kidney structure, specifically about a cluster of blood capillaries in each nephron. I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking which part of the nephron is a cluster of blood capillaries. I remember that the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, responsible for filtering blood. So the main parts I can recall are the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, the loop of Henle, and the collecting duct.

Wait, the glomerulus... I think that's a tuft of capillaries. Yeah, right. When blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, it branches into smaller arteries, eventually leading to the afferent arteriole. This arteriole brings blood to the glomerulus, which is like a ball of capillaries. These capillaries are where the filtration happensâ€”water, ions, and small molecules pass through into the Bowman's capsule, starting the process of urine formation. 

So the glomerulus is the cluster of capillaries. Looking at the options, option B is Glomerulus. That must be the answer.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Let me think about the other options. Option A is afferent arteriole, which is the vessel bringing blood into the glomerulus. Option E is efferent arteriole, which takes blood away. So those are arterioles, not capillaries. Option I is Bowman's capsule, which is the cup-like structure surrounding the glomerulus, but it's not the capillaries themselves.

Other options like the proximal convoluted tubule (D), loop of Henle (F), and distal convoluted tubule (G) are parts of the nephron involved in reabsorption and secretion, but not the capillary clusters.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the correct answer is B: Glomerulus.

The question asks about the cluster of blood capillaries in each nephron. The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, and its key components include the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, proximal and distal convoluted tubules, and the loop of Henle. The glomerulus is specifically a tuft of capillaries responsible for filtering blood. Blood enters through the afferent arteriole and exits via the efferent arteriole, but the cluster of capillaries themselves is the glomerulus. Other structures like Bowman's capsule surround the glomerulus, while the tubules are involved in reabsorption and secretion. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: Glomerulus

Answer: B
