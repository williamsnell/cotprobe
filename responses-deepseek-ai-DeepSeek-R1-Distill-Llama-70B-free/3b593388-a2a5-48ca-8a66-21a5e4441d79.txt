Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's stages of cognitive development, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking about when children develop internal representational systems that allow them to verbally describe people, events, and feelings. Hmm, I remember that Piaget divided cognitive development into several stages, each with distinct characteristics.

First, I should probably list out the stages I remember. Piaget's stages are: 

1. Sensorimotor (0-2 years)
2. Preoperational (2-7 years)
3. Concrete operational (7-11 years)
4. Formal operational (11+ years)

Wait, but the options given include some other terms too, like Symbolic, Reflexive, etc. I think some of those might be less commonly used terms or perhaps different ways of referring to the stages.

The key part of the question is about internal representational systems. I remember that one of the major developments in Piaget's stages is the ability to use symbols and language. 

In the Sensorimotor stage, children learn by using their senses and motor activities. They don't have much in terms of verbal communication yet. So I don't think that's the stage where they develop these internal representations for verbal descriptions.

Then comes the Preoperational stage. I recall that during this stage, children start to use symbols and language. They begin to think with words and images. So this might be the stage where internal representational systems develop. But wait, I think the term "preoperational" comes into play here. Preoperational is when they can't perform operations yet, but they can use symbols.

Another thought: the development of language is a big milestone. I think it's around the Preoperational stage that egocentrism is prominent, and they start using language more effectively. So maybe the internal representations are part of this stage.

Wait, but I should make sure. The Sensorimotor stage is about sensory input and motor output. They understand the world through sensory experiences and motor activities. They don't have symbols yet. So internal representations probably start after that.

The Preoperational stage is when symbolic thinking begins. Children can use symbols and language to represent the world. So, they can describe things verbally because they have these internal symbols and representations.

So the question is about when they develop the ability to verbally describe things using these internal systems. That points to the Preoperational stage.

Looking at the options, option H is Preoperational. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check. Are there any other stages that involve this? The Concrete operational stage is more about logical operations with concrete objects, but not the initial development of internal representations. The Formal operational stage is about abstract and theoretical thinking.

So yes, the correct stage should be Preoperational.

The question asks during which of Piaget's stages children develop internal representational systems that allow them to verbally describe people, events, and feelings. Piaget's stages include Sensorimotor, Preoperational, Concrete operational, and Formal operational. The Sensorimotor stage involves sensory and motor activities but lacks symbolic thinking. The Preoperational stage is when children begin using symbols and language, enabling internal representations for verbal descriptions. This aligns with the development of symbolic thinking and language use. Therefore, the correct stage is Preoperational.

Answer: H
