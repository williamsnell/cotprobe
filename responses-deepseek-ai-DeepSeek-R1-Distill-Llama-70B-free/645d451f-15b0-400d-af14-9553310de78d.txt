Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The problem is an initial value problem, which is given by the equation:

9 y'' + 12 y' + 4 y = 0,

with initial conditions y(0) = a (and a is greater than 0) and y'(0) = -1. The question is asking for the critical value of a that separates solutions which become negative from those that are always positive. So, I guess I need to find the value of a where the solution just touches the x-axis, meaning it starts positive but doesn't go below zero again. That's probably the critical point.

First, I remember that this is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The general approach is to find the characteristic equation and solve for its roots. The characteristic equation is obtained by replacing y'' with r², y' with r, and y with 1. So, plugging that in, the equation becomes:

9r² + 12r + 4 = 0.

I can solve this quadratic equation for r. The quadratic formula is r = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a). Here, a is 9, b is 12, and c is 4. Plugging those values in:

r = [-12 ± sqrt( (12)^2 -4*9*4 ) ]/(2*9)
= [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 144)] / 18
= [-12 ± sqrt(0)] / 18
= -12/18
Simplify that: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 6. So, -12/18 = -2/3.

Wait, so both roots are the same? Because the square root of zero is zero, so both solutions are r = -2/3. That means this is a repeated root case. So the general solution will involve terms with e^(-2t/3) multiplied by (1 + t), but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, when the characteristic equation has a repeated root r, the general solution is y = (C1 + C2 t) e^{rt}. So in this case, r is -2/3, so the general solution is:

y(t) = (C1 + C2 t) e^(-2t/3).

Now I need to apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2.

The initial conditions are y(0) = a and y'(0) = -1.

First, y(0) = (C1 + C2 *0) e^(0) = C1 *1 = C1. So y(0) = C1 = a. So C1 is a.

Next, find y'(t). Let's compute the derivative of y(t):

y'(t) = d/dt [ (C1 + C2 t) e^(-2t/3) ]
= (C2) e^(-2t/3) + (C1 + C2 t)(-2/3) e^(-2t/3)
= e^(-2t/3) [ C2 - (2/3)(C1 + C2 t) ]

At t=0, y'(0) is given as -1. Plugging t=0 into y'(t):

y'(0) = e^(0) [ C2 - (2/3)(C1 + 0) ]
= 1 * [ C2 - (2/3) C1 ]
= C2 - (2/3) C1.

But we know C1 = a, so this becomes:

y'(0) = C2 - (2/3)a = -1.

So we can solve for C2:

C2 = (2/3)a -1.

So putting it all together, the solution is:

y(t) = [a + ( (2a/3) - 1 ) t ] e^(-2t/3).

I think that's correct. Now, the next step is to analyze when y(t) becomes negative. But the problem is to find the critical a where the solution just touches zero (i.e., has a minimum at zero). So I'm looking for the smallest a where y(t) is non-negative for all t >=0.

Alternatively, for a just below this critical value, y(t) will dip below zero at some point. So the critical a is the one where y(t) has a double root at some t, meaning y(t) and y'(t) are zero at the same point.

Wait, another approach is to find when the solution y(t) has a minimum of zero. So find the time t where y(t) is minimized, set y(t) =0, and solve for a, ensuring that this is the point where the minimum occurs.

Alternatively, since the solution tends to zero as t approaches infinity (because of the exponential decay term), the critical case is when the solution touches zero at some finite t, which would be the minimum point.

So to find this, I can set y(t) =0 and y'(t)=0 at the same t, which would give the condition for a double root. Let's denote this time as t = t0.

So, at t = t0, y(t0)=0 and y'(t0)=0.

But wait, if y(t0) is zero, then:

0 = [a + ( (2a/3) -1 ) t0 ] e^(-2t0/3).

Since the exponential is never zero, the term in brackets must be zero:

a + ( (2a/3) -1 ) t0 = 0.

Similarly, y'(t0) is zero, which is:

y'(t0) = [ (2a/3 -1) ] e^(-2t0/3) + [ a + (2a/3 -1) t0 ] * (-2/3) e^(-2t0/3) = 0.

Wait, but since [a + (2a/3 -1) t0 ] is zero (from y(t0)=0), the second term in y'(t0) is zero, so y'(t0) simplifies to:

y'(t0) = (2a/3 -1) e^(-2t0/3) = 0.

But e^(-2t0/3) is never zero, so 2a/3 -1 =0, which gives a= 3/2=1.5.

Wait, that can't be right because that's just for y'(t0) =0. But I thought there's another equation from y(t0)=0.

Wait, let's see. We have two equations:

1) a + ( (2a/3 -1) ) t0 = 0,

2) 2a/3 -1 =0.

From equation 2, a= 3/2=1.5.

Putting that into equation 1:

1.5 + ( (2*(1.5)/3 -1 ) ) t0 = 0.

Compute 2*(1.5)=3, 3/3=1. So (1 -1)=0. So equation 1 becomes 1.5 + 0 * t0 =0 → 1.5=0, which is impossible.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So that approach must be wrong. Maybe I made a mistake in setting both y(t0)=0 and y'(t0)=0.

Wait, perhaps because in reality, the minimum occurs where y'(t)=0, but at that point y(t) is zero. So if the solution just touches zero, then the minimum is zero, so at t0, y(t0) =0 and y'(t0)=0.

But in my previous calculation, that led to a=1.5, but that creates a contradiction in the first equation. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps instead I should think of the solution y(t) and find when it's always positive. Since y(0)=a>0, but if the solution dips below zero, that's bad. So I need to ensure that the solution never becomes negative. So the critical a is where the solution touches zero at some t>0, so that for a larger than that, the solution stays positive, and for a smaller, it dips below.

So another approach is to find the minimum of y(t) and set it to zero. To find the minimum, take derivative y'(t), set to zero, and find the corresponding t, then plug into y(t) and set to zero, solve for a.

So let's proceed step by step.

We have y(t) = [a + (2a/3 -1) t ] e^(-2t/3).

First, compute y'(t):

y'(t) = d/dt [ (a + (2a/3 -1) t ) e^(-2t/3) ]

Let me compute this derivative. Let me denote u = a + (2a/3 -1) t and v = e^(-2t/3).

Then y'(t) = u' v + u v',

where u' = (2a/3 -1), and v' = (-2/3) e^(-2t/3).

So,

y'(t) = (2a/3 -1) e^(-2t/3) + (a + (2a/3 -1) t) (-2/3) e^(-2t/3).

We can factor out e^(-2t/3):

y'(t) = e^(-2t/3) [ (2a/3 -1) - (2/3)(a + (2a/3 -1) t) ].

Let me simplify the expression inside the brackets:

= (2a/3 -1) - (2a/3 + 2*(2a/3 -1) t/3 )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute term by term.

Expanding:

(2a/3 -1) - (2/3)a - (2/3)*(2a/3 -1) t.

So,

= 2a/3 -1 - 2a/3 - (2/3)(2a/3 -1) t.

Simplify:

2a/3 -2a/3 cancels out, leaving (-1) - (2/3)(2a/3 -1) t.

So,

= -1 - [(4a/9 - 2/3) ] t.

So,

y'(t) = e^(-2t/3) [ -1 - (4a/9 - 2/3) t ].

We can set y'(t)=0 to find critical points.

Since e^(-2t/3) is never zero, set the bracket to zero:

-1 - (4a/9 - 2/3) t =0.

→ -1 = (4a/9 - 2/3) t.

Solve for t:

t = -1 / (4a/9 - 2/3) )

Let me compute the denominator:

4a/9 - 2/3 = (4a - 6)/9.

So,

t = -1 / [ (4a -6)/9 ] = -9/(4a -6) = 9/(6 -4a).

But since time t must be positive, the denominator (6-4a) must be positive, so 6-4a >0 → a <6/4=1.5.

So, the critical point is at t=9/(6 -4a).

Now, for a <1.5, there's a positive critical point where y'(t)=0. For a >=1.5, the denominator would be <=0, so no positive critical point, meaning y(t) is always decreasing (since y'(0) =-1 and no other critical points).

Wait, but wait, when a >=1.5, what happens? Let me check if for a=1.5, the denominator is zero, so t would be infinity. So for a>1.5, t would be negative, which is not in our domain (t>=0).

So for a >=1.5, y'(t) is always negative, because y'(t) starts at -1, and with no critical points where it could change, so y(t) is decreasing for all t>0. Since y(0)=a>0, and it's decreasing, y(t) might approach some limit, possibly zero, but never becoming negative.

Wait, but let's check when a=1.5: what's y(t)?

y(t) = [1.5 + ( (2*1.5)/3 -1 ) t ] e^(-2t/3 )

Compute 2*1.5=3, 3/3=1. So 1 -1 =0. So the term in brackets is 1.5 +0*t =1.5. So y(t)=1.5 e^(-2t/3), which is always positive, as expected.

But for a <1.5, there's a critical point at t=9/(6-4a), which is positive. So at that t, the function reaches a minimum. So whether the function dips below zero depends on the value of a. So for a just below 1.5, the minimum would be just above zero, and for a lower than that, the minimum would be negative.

Wait, so the critical a is the one where the minimum is exactly zero. So find a such that at t= t_c =9/(6-4a), y(t_c)=0.

So let's compute y(t_c) and set it to zero.

We have y(t) = [a + (2a/3 -1) t ] e^(-2t/3).

At t_c, y(t_c)=0, so:

a + (2a/3 -1) t_c =0.

Because the exponential is not zero.

So, a + (2a/3 -1) t_c =0.

We can substitute t_c =9/(6-4a) into this equation.

So,

a + (2a/3 -1) * [9/(6 -4a)] =0.

Let me compute this:

First, compute (2a/3 -1) *9/(6-4a):

= [ (2a -3)/3 ] * 9/(6-4a)
= (2a -3) * 3 / (6 -4a)
= 3(2a -3)/(6-4a).

So the equation becomes:

a + [3(2a -3)/(6-4a) ] =0.

Multiply both sides by (6-4a) to eliminate denominator:

a(6 -4a) +3(2a -3) =0.

Expand each term:

a*6 -4a² + 6a -9 =0.

6a -4a² +6a -9 =0.

Combine like terms:

(6a +6a) =12a.

So,

12a -4a² -9 =0.

Rearrange:

-4a² +12a -9=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

4a² -12a +9=0.

Now, solve for a using quadratic formula.

a = [12 ± sqrt(144 - 4*4*9)]/(2*4)
= [12 ± sqrt(144 -144)]/8
= [12 ± 0]/8
=12/8=3/2=1.5.

So a=1.5 is the solution. But earlier, when I tried a=1.5, I saw that y(t)=1.5 e^(-2t/3), which is always positive, and the critical point t_c would be t=9/(6-4a) =9/(6-6)=9/0, which is undefined. That suggests that at a=1.5, the function doesn't have a minimum except at infinity, and it's always positive.

Wait, but according to this calculation, a=1.5 is the critical value where the solution touches zero, but when a=1.5, the solution is always positive. So that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, when I set y(t_c)=0 and t_c=9/(6-4a), then I substituted and found a=1.5. But when a=1.5, the solution is y(t)=1.5 e^(-2t/3), which is always positive and doesn't touch zero except as t approaches infinity. So perhaps a=1.5 is the point where the solution stops having a minimum and instead just decreases to zero. So for a=1.5, y(t) is always positive, and for a <1.5, the solution dips below zero. Therefore, the critical a is 1.5, because any a above that will keep the solution positive, and any below will cause it to go negative.

Wait, but according to the calculation, a=1.5 is the point where the minimum of y(t) is zero. But in reality, when a=1.5, the solution doesn't have a minimum at any finite t; it's always decreasing. So perhaps the calculation is indicating that for a=1.5, the minimum occurs at infinity, which is zero. So for a just below 1.5, the minimum would be a very small negative number, making y(t) dip below zero. So the critical value is a=1.5, because above that, the solution is always positive, and below, it becomes negative.

So the answer should be B:1.5.

To solve the initial value problem 

$$
9 y'' + 12 y' + 4 y = 0, \quad y(0) = a > 0, \quad y'(0) = -1,
$$

we first find the general solution by solving the characteristic equation:

$$
9r^2 + 12r + 4 = 0.
$$

Using the quadratic formula, the roots are:

$$
r = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 144}}{18} = -\frac{2}{3}.
$$

Since the roots are repeated, the general solution is:

$$
y(t) = \left(C_1 + C_2 t\right) e^{-2t/3}.
$$

Applying the initial conditions:

1. At \( t = 0 \), \( y(0) = a \), so \( C_1 = a \).
2. The derivative is:

$$
y'(t) = \left(C_2\right) e^{-2t/3} + \left(a + C_2 t\right) \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right) e^{-2t/3}.
