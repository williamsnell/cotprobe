Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating molecular translational partition functions for different molecules. Hmm, I remember that the translational partition function is related to the thermal de Broglie wavelength and the volume. The formula, I think, is q_trans = (V / λ^3) * (2πmkT/(h²))^(3/2), but wait, maybe it's simplified when using certain units. Oh right, there's a standard formula for it under certain conditions.

Wait, the translational partition function is given by q = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³, where m is the mass of the molecule, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and V is the volume. Yeah, that sounds right.

So the problem gives me three molecules: H₂, CH₄, and C₈H₁₈. The volume is 1 cm³, which is 1e-6 m³? Wait, no. Wait, 1 m³ is (10^2 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³, so 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³. But wait, when calculating q, I think the units matter. Oh, wait, sometimes the formula is written with V in terms of cm³ and other constants adjusted accordingly. Let me think about the constants.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula q_trans = (2.686e+25) * V (in cm³) * sqrt(MW) * T^(3/2), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check the exact expression. Oh, right, the translational partition function can be approximated using the formula q_trans ≈ ( (2πmkT)^3/2 * V ) / h^3. But dealing with all those constants might get messy. Maybe it's easier to use a version where constants are precomputed.

Wait, another approach: I remember that the translational partition function can be expressed as (V / λ_th^3), where λ_th is the thermal wavelength. And λ_th is given by h / sqrt(2πmkT). So putting it together, q = V * (2πmkT/(h²))^(3/2).

Let me get the constants straight. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.380649e-23 J/K. Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. The temperature given is 298 K. The volume V is 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³.

Wait, but let me make sure about the units. Because when V is in m³, m is in kg, T in K, the units should work out. Alternatively, maybe I can find a simplified version where V is in cm³ and m is in g/mol. Because molecular weight (MW) is usually given in g/mol.

Oh right, another version of the formula is q_trans = ( (2πmkT)^(3/2) * V ) / h^3. But m needs to be in kg. So for each molecule, I'll calculate m as (MW) * 1e-3 kg/mol * per molecule? Wait, no. Wait, m is the mass of a single molecule, so m = (MW in g/mol) * (1e-3 kg/g) / (Avogadro's number).

So m = (MW * 1e-3) / (6.02214076e23) kg.

Putting it all together:

First, compute the translational partition function for each molecule.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate m for each molecule.
2. Plug into the formula for q_trans.
3. Compare the results with the given options.

Let's start with H₂.

Molecular weight (MW) of H₂: 2 g/mol.

m_H2 = (2e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 molecules/mol) = (2e-3) / (6.022e23) kg.

Similarly for CH₄: MW = 16 g/mol.

m_CH4 = (16e-3) / (6.022e23) kg.

For C₈H₁₈: MW is (8*12) + (18*1) = 96 +18=114 g/mol.

m_C8H18 = 114e-3 / 6.022e23 kg.

Now, the formula for q_trans is:

q = (V) * (2π m k T )^(3/2) / h^3.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, let's compute 2π m k T for each molecule.

Compute each part:

Constants:

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

T = 298 K

V = 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³.

Let me compute (2π m k T)^(3/2) for each molecule.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step.

Alternatively, I remember that sometimes the formula is expressed as:

q_trans = ( ( (k*T) / (h^2/(2π m)) )^(3/2) ) * V

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each part numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula with V in cm³ and MW in g/mol.

Wait, let me find a version of the formula that uses these units to make computation easier.

I think there's an expression where q_trans can be approximated as:

q_trans ≈ 1.03e25 * V (cm³) * sqrt(MW) * (T / 100)^1.5

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula with R, the gas constant.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Oh, but let me think differently.

The translational partition function can alternatively be written as:

q_trans = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h^3

But substituting m = (MW) * 1e-3 kg/mol / (6.022e23 molecules/mol).

So:

m = (MW) * 1e-3 / 6.022e23.

Let me compute 2π m k T:

For H₂: MW=2.

m = (2e-3) / (6.022e23) = approx 3.32e-27 kg.

2π m k T = 2 * π * 3.32e-27 kg * 1.38e-23 J/K * 298 K.

Compute that:

2 * π ≈6.283.

6.283 * 3.32e-27 = approx 2.085e-26.

Multiply by 1.38e-23: 2.085e-26 * 1.38e-23 = 2.88e-49.

Multiply by 298: 2.88e-49 * 3e2 ≈ 8.64e-46.

Wait, let me compute step by step more accurately.

Compute 2π * m:

m = (2e-3) / (6.022e23) = (2 / 6022) )e-26 kg.

Wait, 2e-3 / 6.022e23 = (2 / 6.022) * 1e-26 = approx 0.332 * 1e-26 = 3.32e-27 kg.

So 2πm = 2 * 3.1416 * 3.32e-27 = approx 20.95e-27 = 2.095e-26.

Then multiply by k T: 1.38e-23 * 298 = approx 4.112e-21.

So 2πm k T = (2.095e-26) * (4.112e-21) )= 8.62e-47.

Wait, 2.095e-26 * 4.112e-21 = (2.095 *4.112) * 1e-47.

2.095 *4.112 ≈ 8.62, so 8.62e-47.

Now, (2π m k T )^(3/2) = (8.62e-47 )^(3/2).

Compute the exponent: 3/2 is 1.5, so sqrt(8.62e-47) cubed.

sqrt(8.62e-47) = sqrt(8.62) * 1e-23.5 ≈ 2.936 * 1e-23.5.

Wait, 8.62e-47 is 8.62 x 10^-47.

The square root is sqrt(8.62) ≈2.936, and sqrt(1e-47) is 1e-23.5.

So 2.936e-23.5.

Now, raising to the 3rd power: (2.936e-23.5)^3 = (2.936)^3 * 1e-70.5.

2.936^3 ≈ 25.38, so 25.38e-70.5 = 2.538e-69.5.

Wait, but 70.5 is 70 +0.5, so 1e-70.5 is 3.16e-71.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of exponents.

Wait, 8.62e-47 to the 1.5 is same as (8.62)^(1.5) * (1e-47)^(1.5).

(8.62)^1.5 = sqrt(8.62^3) = sqrt(8.62 *8.62 *8.62).

Wait, 8^3 is 512, 8.62^3 is about 636. So sqrt(636) ≈ 25.22.

(1e-47)^(1.5) = 1e-70.5 = approx 3.16e-71.

So 25.22 *3.16e-71 ≈ 79.7e-71 = 7.97e-70.

Wait, but earlier I had 8.62e-47 to the 1.5 as 25.38 * 1e-70.5. Oh, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, (8.62e-47 )^(3/2) = (8.62)^(3/2) * (1e-47)^(3/2) ) = (8.62^1.5) * 1e-70.5.

Compute 8.62^1.5:

sqrt(8.62) is about 2.936, so 8.62 * 2.936 ≈ 25.34.

So 25.34 * 1e-70.5 = 25.34 * 3.16e-71 → 25.34 *3.16 ≈79.9, so 79.9e-71 → 7.99e-70.

So (2πmkT)^(3/2) ≈7.99e-70.

Now, the denominator is h^3.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, so h^3 is (6.626e-34)^3.

6.626^3 ≈ 290. So 290e-102 → 2.9e-100.

So h^3 ≈ 2.9e-100 (J^3 s^3).

Now, q_trans = V * (7.99e-70) / (2.9e-100) ) = V * (7.99e-70 / 2.9e-100) ) = V * (2.755e30).

But wait, V is 1 cm³, which is 1e-6 m³. Oh, but wait, in this calculation, the units might be in m³. So V is 1e-6 m³.

So q = (1e-6 m³) * (2.755e30) ) → 2.755e24.

Wait, that can't be right because I remember for H2, the value is around 1e24.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go through the steps again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Another approach is to use the formula in terms of V in cm³ and molecular weight.

I found a source stating that the translational partition function can be approximated as:

q_trans = (1.03 × 10^26 cm³) × (MW)^(3/2) × (T/298 K)^(3/2) )

Wait, perhaps that's a simplified version when V is in cm³, T is around 298 K, and MW is in g/mol.

Wait, if that's the case, then q = 1.03e26 * V (cm³) * (MW)^(3/2) * (T/298)^(3/2).

Since V is 1 cm³ and T is 298 K, the equation simplifies to q ≈ 1.03e26 * (MW)^(3/2).

So let's compute this for each molecule.

H2: MW=2.

q = 1.03e26 * (2)^(3/2).

2^(3/2) is sqrt(2^3) = sqrt(8) ≈2.828.

So 1.03e26 * 2.828 ≈ 2.916e26.

Wait, but looking at the options, the H2 values are around 2e24, not 2e26.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the 1.03e26 factor already includes the volume in cm³ and other constants.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is q_trans = ( (2π m k T)^(3/2) V ) / h^3.

But maybe an easier way is to use the formula with units where V is in cm³ and MW is in g/mol, and T in K.

I found a different approach where the formula is written as:

q_trans = ( (2π m (k T))^(3/2) V ) / h^3.

But m is in kg, V is in m³.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula with R, the gas constant. Let me think.

The translational partition function can also be written in terms of the thermal wavelength, as q = V / λ_th^3.

Where λ_th = h / sqrt(2π m k T).

So, for each molecule, compute m, then λ_th, then q = V / (λ_th)^3.

Let's try that approach.

Compute for H2.

MW = 2 g/mol = 0.002 kg/mol.

m = MW / (N_A) = 0.002 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ → 3.32e-27 kg.

λ_th = h / sqrt(2 π m k T).

Compute denominator: sqrt(2 * π * m * k * T).

m=3.32e-27 kg.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

T=298 K.

So 2 * π ≈6.283.

Multiply by m: 6.283 *3.32e-27 ≈2.086e-26.

Multiply by k: 2.086e-26 *1.38e-23 = 2.88e-49.

Multiply by T: 2.88e-49 *298 ≈8.59e-47.

Now, sqrt(8.59e-47) = sqrt(8.59) *1e-23.5.

sqrt(8.59) ≈2.93, so 2.93e-23.5.

Wait, 1e-23.5 is 3.16e-24. So 2.93 *3.16e-24 ≈9.26e-24.

So λ_th ≈6.626e-34 J·s / 9.26e-24 m → 6.626e-34 / 9.26e-24 → approx 7.16e-11 m.

Wait, 6.626e-34 /9.26e-24 = (6.626 /9.26) *1e-10 → approx 0.716 *1e-10 →7.16e-11 m.

Now, compute q = V / λ_th^3.

V is 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³.

λ_th^3 = (7.16e-11)^3 = approx 3.66e-33 m³.

So q = 1e-6 / 3.66e-33 = 2.73e26.

Hmm, but the options for H2 are around 1e24 to 4e24. So this result is way too high. I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of m. Let me recheck.

MW of H2 is 2 g/mol, which is 0.002 kg/mol.

m = 0.002 kg/mol divided by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules/mol) → 3.32e-27 kg/molecule. That's correct.

Wait, but when I calculated λ_th, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator calculation.

Let me recalculate the denominator inside the sqrt:

2 * π * m * k * T.

m=3.32e-27 kg.

So 2 * π = ~6.283.

6.283 *3.32e-27 = 6.283 *3.32 = ~20.88 → 20.88e-27 = 2.088e-26.

Multiply by k (1.38e-23): 2.088e-26 *1.38e-23 = 2.088 *1.38 = ~2.88 → 2.88e-49.

Multiply by T=298: 2.88e-49 *298 ≈ 8.58e-47.

So sqrt(8.58e-47) is sqrt(8.58)*1e-23.5.

sqrt(8.58)=2.93.

1e-23.5 is 1e-23 *1e-0.5 = 1e-23 *0.3162 → 3.162e-24.

So 2.93 *3.162e-24 ≈9.26e-24.

So λ_th = h / (9.26e-24) →6.626e-34 /9.26e-24 ≈7.16e-11 m.

So λ_th^3 = (7.16e-11)^3 = approx (7.16)^3 *1
