Question:

Police officers received an anonymous tip that two men were selling cocaine from the back of a restaurant. The tipster stated to the police that the two men were both tall white men who were wearing jeans and black shirts, the uniform of the restaurant. The tipster also said that one of the men had red hair and was wearing a tan ball cap and the other man had black hair and was wearing a red ball cap. The police set up surveillance on the back of the restaurant and saw the two men make several hand- to-hand transactions. Upon receiving authority to make the arrest from their commanding officer, they waited for the two men to come out again. About two hours later, the two men came out again, this time with a woman. The officers arrested the two men and detained the woman to determine her involvement. The officers took the woman's purse without her consent and searched it for illegal narcotics. In her purse they found three grams of crack cocaine, digital scales, a small glass pipe used for inhaling crack cocaine, and a balloon of black tar heroin. The woman was then arrested on the various drug charges. The woman was thereafter prosecuted and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. She filed a motion to exclude the drugs and the paraphernalia from evidence. Her motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that she was involved in the drug transactions.
B: denied, because the search was justified, since she was about to leave the scene of the crime.
C: granted, because the woman was not given a chance to refuse the search of her purse.
D: granted, because the police violated her right to privacy by searching her purse without her consent.
E: denied, because the woman was in a public place where she had a reduced expectation of privacy.
F: denied, because the police were acting in the interest of public safety.
G: denied, because she was sufficiently close or proximate to the crime scene to justifi the warrantless search.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before conducting the search.
I: granted, because the police should have asked for her consent before searching her purse.
J: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of her purse.

Okay, so I've got this law question here about police searching someone's purse without consent. I need to figure out whether the woman's motion to exclude the evidence will be granted or denied. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The police got an anonymous tip about two men selling cocaine. The tip included descriptions: both were tall white men in jeans and black shirts, which were the restaurant's uniforms. One had red hair and a tan cap, the other black hair and a red cap. The police set up surveillance and saw them making hand-to-hand transactions, which probably looked like drug deals. They got authority to arrest and waited. Two hours later, the two men came out with a woman. The police arrested the men and detained the woman to check her involvement. They took her purse without consent and searched it, finding crack cocaine, scales, a pipe, and heroin. She was charged with possession and paraphernalia. She's moving to exclude the evidence.

So the issue is whether the search of her purse was legal. The options are about whether the motion is granted or denied, based on various legal standards.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, searches and seizures need to be reasonable. Warrants are usually required, but there are exceptions. One key exception is a search incident to arrest. But wait, that applies when the person is arrested and the search is for weapons or evidence. Also, for a search incident to arrest, the area searched must be within the person's reach (like the Chimel rule). But wait, the woman wasn't immediately arrested, right? She was detained to determine her involvement. So maybe she wasn't under arrest when they searched her purse.

Wait, the police arrested the two men and detained the woman. So she was being held, maybe under investigative detention, like a Terry stop. But in Terry stops, the police can pat down for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion, but not conduct a full search. So if they took her purse and searched it without consent, does that require probable cause or a warrant?

Alternatively, if the woman was in the process of being arrested, but I think the question says they arrested the men and detained her. So perhaps she wasn't under arrest yet, just being detained. So the police can't just search her without a warrant or probable cause.

Another point: The police had probable cause to arrest the two men based on the surveillance of hand-to-hand transactions, which suggests drug sales. But what about the woman? Did they have probable cause to believe she was involved? The question says they detained her to determine her involvement. So maybe they were investigating whether she was involved in the drug transactions.

Now, when the police detain someone, like in a Terry stop, they can pat down for weapons if they have reasonable suspicion of danger. But searching a purse without consent goes beyond that. So unless they had probable cause to believe the purse contained evidence of a crime, the search would be unlawful.

In this scenario, did the police have probable cause regarding the woman? The question says they saw her come out with the two men, but that's not necessarily enough. They had been watching the men for two hours, but the woman was only with them when they came out again. Unless there was more, like she was participating in the transactions, but the question doesn't say that. The police just detained her to check her involvement, which suggests they didn't have enough yet to arrest her.

So when they took her purse and searched it, they didn't have her consent. They might argue that they had probable cause based on the circumstancesâ€”she was with two known drug dealers, and perhaps her presence suggested involvement. But without more specific evidence, like seeing her handle drugs or participate in the transactions, the probable cause might be lacking.

I think the key issue is whether the police had probable cause to search her purse. Without her consent, they need either a warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances, or another exception.

Alternatively, if she was in the vicinity of the crime scene, maybe under the 'exigent circumstances' exception, but I don't think that applies here. Exigent circumstances usually involve situations where evidence might be destroyed or there's a need to act quickly. But the scenario doesn't mention any such urgency here.

Another angle: maybe the search was part of the arrest of the two men, but the woman wasn't being arrested yet. So the search incident to arrest doesn't apply to her.

So in this case, the police searched her purse without consent, without a warrant, and without her being under arrest. They might have had reasonable suspicion to detain her for questioning (under Terry), but to search her purse, they'd need probable cause.

Wait, but if the police had probable cause to believe that the purse contained evidence of a crime, they could search it without a warrant under the automobile exception or other exceptions, but generally, for a purse, that's more personal and protected. So unless there's probable cause, the search is invalid.

In the case of United States v. Di Re, the court held that a search of a woman's purse during a Terry stop was invalid because the police didn't have probable cause to believe it contained evidence.

So applying that here, the police didn't have probable cause to search her purse. They had detained her based on being with the two men, but that alone might not be enough. Therefore, the search was unlawful, and the evidence should be excluded.

Looking at the options:

Option J says the motion is granted because the police didn't have probable cause to search her purse.

Option D says it's granted because the police violated her privacy without consent. But that's more about the general right, but without probable cause, the search is invalid.

Option I says granted because they should have asked for consent. But even if they ask, if she says no, they can't search without probable cause.

So the correct reasoning is that the police lacked probable cause to search her purse, so the evidence is excluded. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure. Did the police have any reason to believe she was involved? They saw her with the two men, but that's not necessarily enough. They were investigating her involvement, which suggests they didn't have enough yet. So probable cause is lacking, making the search unconstitutional.

The question revolves around whether the police's search of the woman's purse without her consent was lawful under the Fourth Amendment. The key issue is whether the police had probable cause to search her purse or if an exception to the warrant requirement applied.

The police detained the woman to investigate her involvement with the two men, who were under arrest for drug transactions. However, the woman was not under arrest at the time of the search, and the question does not provide evidence that she was actively involved in the drug transactions or that the police had probable cause to believe her purse contained evidence of a crime. Under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, a search incident to arrest does not apply here because the woman was not under arrest. Similarly, the Terry stop exception allows only a pat-down for weapons, not a full search of a purse, unless there is probable cause.

Without probable cause or another valid exception, the search of the woman's purse was unconstitutional. Therefore, the evidence obtained from the search should be excluded. The correct reasoning aligns with Option J, as the police lacked probable cause to conduct the search.
