Okay, so I have this accounting problem to solve. It's about calculating the value of inventory using the average cost method. Hmm, I remember that average cost method values inventory based on the average cost of all units purchased or available for sale during the period. Let me think through this step by step.

The company is Motor-Cade Auto Supply, and they're taking inventory as of June 30. They have 150 cans of Q-56 motor oil. The records show various transactions: an April 1 inventory, and purchases on April 15, May 23, and June 29. My task is to find the value of the 150 cans using the average cost method.

Wait, okay, average cost method. So I need to calculate the average cost per can and then multiply by the number of cans on hand. But wait, how do I handle the beginning inventory and the purchases? Let me list out the data:

- Beginning inventory on April 1: 130 cans at $0.36 each.
- Purchase on April 15: 100 cans at $0.365.
- Purchase on May 23: 180 cans at $0.40.
- Purchase on June 29: 120 cans at $0.425.

Wait, but the beginning inventory is part of the units available for sale, right? So I think I should include all the units purchased, including the beginning inventory, to compute the average cost. Or wait, no, beginning inventory is considered as part of the units available, so yes, we include it in the total cost and units.

Wait, another thought: the beginning inventory is from the previous period. So for the current period, the units started with are 130, then they made purchases. But wait, the total number of units available for sale would be the sum of beginning inventory plus all the purchases. Then, the units sold would be the total available minus the ending inventory. But wait, in this problem, I don't think we're given any sales data. Oh, wait, the problem is about valuing the ending inventory, which is 150 cans. So maybe we don't need to calculate cost of goods sold, just the average cost.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the beginning inventory is included in the average cost calculation. Let me think again. The average cost method averages the cost of all units available for sale. So the beginning inventory is included because they were available to sell during the period. So the total units available would be the sum of beginning inventory and all purchases. Then, the average cost is total cost of all units divided by total units available.

Wait, but wait—another approach: since the ending inventory is 150, perhaps the units sold would be the total available minus 150. But maybe I don't need that for average cost. Because average cost per unit would be the same regardless of how many were sold. So I just calculate the average cost per can across all the cans that were available, and then multiply by the ending inventory quantity.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cans available for sale.
   - Beginning inventory: 130
   - Purchases: 100 + 180 + 120 = 400
   - Total available = 130 + 400 = 530 cans.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the beginning inventory is 130, and then they bought 100, 180, and 120. So total available is 130 + 100 + 180 + 120 = 530.

2. Calculate the total cost of all these cans.
   - Beginning inventory cost: 130 * 0.36
   - April 15 purchase: 100 * 0.365
   - May 23 purchase: 180 * 0.40
   - June 29 purchase: 120 * 0.425

Let me compute each of these:

- 130 * 0.36 = let's see, 130 * 0.36. 100*0.36 is 36, 30*0.36 is 10.8, so total 46.8.

- 100 * 0.365 = 36.5.

- 180 * 0.40 = 72.

- 120 * 0.425 = let's compute 120 * 0.4 =48, 120*0.025=3, so 48+3=51.

So total cost is 46.8 + 36.5 +72 +51.

Adding these up:

46.8 + 36.5 is 83.3.

83.3 +72 = 155.3.

155.3 +51 = 206.3. So total cost is $206.30.

Wait, but wait, the beginning inventory is part of the prior period. Oh, I'm confusing myself. Actually, in the average cost method, the beginning inventory is part of the current period's cost of goods available for sale. So yes, include it.

So, total cost is $206.30.

Total units available: 530 cans.

So average cost per can is 206.30 / 530.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 206.30 ÷ 530.

Well, 530 × 0.39 = 206.7. Hmm, because 530 × 0.4 is 212, so 0.39 is 212 - 5.3 = 206.7.

Wait, 0.39 × 530 = 530 × 0.3 + 530 × 0.09.

530 × 0.3 is 159.

530 × 0.09 is 47.7.

159 +47.7=206.7.

So 206.30 is slightly less than 0.39. Because 206.7 is 0.39, so 206.30 is 0.39 minus (0.40 /530), which is 0.0007547.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should compute 206.3 /530.

Let me do that division properly.

206.3 divided by 530.

530 goes into 206.3 0. times.

Wait, 530 goes into 2063 (after adding a decimal) how many times? Let me do it step by step.

Let me write it as 206.30 ÷ 530.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 20630 ÷ 53000.

Now, 53000 goes into 20630 0.39 times because 53000 × 0.39 = 20670, which is a bit more than 20630.

So 20630 ÷53000 = approximately 0.389.

So approximately $0.389 per can.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

530 × 0.389 = ?

Let me compute 530 × 0.3 =159.

530 × 0.08 =42.4.

530 × 0.009 =4.77.

Adding these together: 159 +42.4=201.4, +4.77=206.17.

Hmm, 530 × 0.389 =206.17.

But our total cost is 206.30, which is 0.13 higher than 206.17.

So the average cost is 0.389 + (0.13 /530).

0.13 /530 = approximately 0.000245.

So 0.389 + 0.000245= 0.389245. So around $0.3892 per can.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 206.3 ÷530.

So 206.3 ÷530 = ?

Well, 530 ÷ 1000 is 0.53, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me compute 206.3 /530.

Let me compute 20630 ÷530.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 2063 ÷53.

53 × 38 is 2014 (since 50×38=1900, 3×38=114 → 2014).

2063 -2014=49.

So 38 with a remainder of 49.

So 38 and 49/53 ≈38.9245.

Wait, no. Wait, 2063 ÷53 = 38.9245...

Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should use decimal division.

Wait, 53 × 38 = 2014.

So 38. So subtract 2014 from 2063: 49.

Bring down a zero: 490.

53 ×9=477. So 9. 490-477=13.

Bring down another zero: 130.

53 ×2=106. 2. 130-106=24.

Bring down zero: 240.

53 ×4=212. 4. 240-212=28.

Bring down zero: 280.

53 ×5=265. 5. 280-265=15.

So it's approximately 38.9245... So 38.9245, but wait, this is 2063 ÷53 =38.9245. Wait, but we're computing 2063 ÷530, no, wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me try a different approach.

The average cost per can is total cost divided by total units. So 206.3 ÷530.

Let me compute 206.3 ÷530.

530 goes into 206.3 zero times. So we write 0. and see how many times 530 goes into 2063 (after moving the decimal).

So 530 ×3 is 1590, which is less than 2063.

530 ×3=1590. Subtract from 2063: 473.

Bring down next 0: 4730.

530 ×8=4240. 4730-4240=490.

Bring down a 0: 4900.

530 ×9=4770. 4900-4770=130.

Bring down a 0: 1300.

530 ×2=1060. 1300-1060=240.

Bring down a 0: 2400.

530 ×4=2120. 2400-2120=280.

Bring down a 0: 2800.

530 ×5=2650. 2800-2650=150.

So so far, we have 0.38924... approximately.

So average cost is approximately $0.38924 per can.

So now, the ending inventory is 150 cans. So total value is 150 × 0.38924.

Let me compute that.

0.38924 ×150.

0.3 ×150=45.

0.08 ×150=12.

0.00924 ×150=1.386.

So adding them: 45 +12=57, +1.386=58.386.

So approximately $58.39.

Looking at the options, the closest is I: $58.35. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute 0.38924 ×150 more accurately.

0.38924 ×150:

Let me compute 0.38924 ×100=38.924.

0.38924 ×50=19.462.

So total is 38.924 +19.462 =58.386.

So $58.386, which is approximately $58.39. The options given don't have that exact amount. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: $63.35

B: $64.35

C: $59.35

D: $60.35

E: $55.35

F: $56.35

G: $57.35

H: $61.35

I: $58.35

J: $62.35

So the closest is I: $58.35. But wait, I calculated approximately $58.39, so $58.39 rounds to $58.40, but the option is $58.35. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the total cost calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the total cost.

- April 1: 130 ×0.36=46.80.

- April 15:100 ×0.365=36.50.

- May 23:180 ×0.40=72.00.

- June 29:120 ×0.425=51.00.

Adding these: 46.80 +36.50=83.30; 83.30 +72=155.30; 155.30 +51=206.30. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the average cost calculation. Let me try a different approach.

Compute total cost: 206.30.

Total units: 530.

So 206.30 ÷530 = ?

Let me compute 206.30 ÷530.

Well, 530 × 0.389 = 206.17 as before. So the difference is 206.30 -206.17=0.13.

So 0.13 ÷530 = 0.00024528.

So average cost is 0.389 +0.00024528≈0.389245.

So 0.389245 ×150.

Compute 0.389245 ×150.

Let me compute 0.389245 ×100=38.9245.

0.389245 ×50=19.46225.

So total is 38.9245 +19.46225=58.38675, which is approximately $58.387.

Hmm, so approximately $58.39. But the option I is $58.35. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the average cost.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average cost more precisely.

Alternatively, maybe the beginning inventory is not supposed to be included in the average cost calculation. Wait, no, in average cost method, all units available are included, including the beginning inventory.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's using a periodic inventory system, and the average cost is calculated at each purchase, but I think that's not necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the cost in a different way. Let me try calculating the total cost as 206.30 and total units 530.

Wait, another approach: 206.30 ÷530 = ?

Let me compute 206.3 /530.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 41.26 / 106.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, 206.3 ÷530 = (approx) 0.3892.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use fractions.

Wait, 20630 ÷53000 = 0.38924.

Wait, but 0.38924 ×150=58.386.

Hmm. So the correct answer should be approximately $58.39, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the total units again.

Wait, beginning inventory is 130. Then purchases are 100 +180 +120=400. So total units available is 130 +400=530. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost. Let me recheck each cost.

April 1: 130 ×0.36=46.8. Correct.

April 15:100 ×0.365=36.5. Correct.

May 23:180 ×0.40=72. Correct.

June 29:120 ×0.425=51. Correct.

Total:46.8+36.5=83.3; +72=155.3; +51=206.3. Correct.

Hmm, maybe I should recheck the average cost calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 206.3 ÷530 = ?

Let me try this way: 530 ×0.38 = 201.4.

Subtract from 206.3: 4.9.

So 4.9 left. So 0.38 + (4.9/530).

4.9 ÷530 = approximately 0.00924.

So 0.38 +0.00924=0.38924. So same as before.

So 0.38924 ×150=58.386.

Hmm, so approximately $58.39. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is I: $58.35. Or maybe the question is using a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the beginning inventory is not included in the average cost. Wait, why would that be? Because in some cases, beginning inventory is considered as prior period's cost and not part of current purchases. But in average cost method, all units in the inventory during the period are included. So I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the FIFO method, but no, the question specifically says average cost method.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the total cost. Let me recheck.

Wait, 120 ×0.425: 120 ×0.4=48, 120 ×0.025=3. So total 51. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the ending inventory is 150, but perhaps I should calculate how many were sold and apply the average cost to ending inventory.

Wait, but no, in average cost, the average is computed across all units, and then applied to ending inventory. So regardless of how many were sold, the ending inventory is valued at the average cost.

Wait, perhaps I should try rounding the average cost to four decimal places, then multiply by 150.

Let me compute the average cost: 206.30 ÷530=0.389245... So 0.3892.

0.3892 ×150.

0.3 ×150=45.

0.08 ×150=12.

0.0092 ×150=1.38.

So total 45+12=57 +1.38=58.38. So $58.38.

Hmm, the closest option is I: $58.35. But my calculation gives $58.38. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to carry the average cost to more decimal places, or perhaps I made a mistake in the rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different approach. Wait, let me think about the units.

Wait, total units available: 130 +100 +180 +120=530. Correct.

Total cost: 46.8 +36.5 +72 +51=206.3. Correct.

So average cost is 206.3 /530 =0.389245...

So multiplying by 150 gives 58.38675, which is approximately $58.39.

Looking at the options, the closest is I: $58.35, but perhaps the options are rounded to the nearest cent, so $58.39 would be $58.39, but the option isn't there. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 206.3 ÷530 more accurately.

Wait, 206.3 ÷530.

Let me compute 530 × 0.389 = 206.17 as before.

So 0.389 gives 206.17, which is 0.13 less than 206.3.

So 0.13 ÷530= 0.00024528.

So
