Okay, so I've got this problem here where a group of 9 people is being split into 3 committees, each having 3 people. The question is asking how many ways this can be done. The committees are identical except for their members, which I think means that the order of the committees doesn't matter. Hmm, I remember that when the order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach here.

Let me try to break it down. So, I need to divide 9 people into 3 groups of 3. The first thing that comes to mind is combinations. I know that the number of ways to choose 3 people out of 9 is C(9,3), which is 84. But wait, since there are three committees, I might have to do this multiple times.

Wait, so after selecting the first committee of 3, there are 6 people left. So the next committee would be C(6,3) = 20 ways. And the last committee is just the remaining 3, so that's C(3,3)=1. So multiplying these together, 84 * 20 * 1 = 1680. But wait, that's a lot. But wait, the committees are identical, meaning that the order in which we select them doesn't matter. So I think I have to divide by the number of ways to arrange the committees, which is 3!. Because if I have three committees, say A, B, C, but they're indistinct, then each unique grouping is being counted 6 times (3! =6) in the 1680.

So the correct count should be 1680 divided by 6, which is 280. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. Let me think of it as multinomial coefficients. The multinomial coefficient for dividing into groups of sizes k1, k2, ..., km is n!/(k1! k2! ... km!). So here, n=9, and each k is 3. So the formula would be 9!/(3! 3! 3!) = 1680. But again, since the committees are indistinct, I have to divide by the number of ways to arrange the committees, which is 3!. So 1680 /6 = 280. So the answer should be 280, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I've seen similar problems, the formula is (n choose k) * (nâˆ’k choose k) ... divided by m! where m is the number of groups. So in this case, that would be (9 choose 3) * (6 choose 3) * (3 choose 3) / 3! = (84 * 20 *1)/6 = 280. Yeah, that makes sense.

So looking at the options, G is 280. So the answer should be G.

To determine the number of ways to split 9 people into 3 identical committees of 3 people each, we start by calculating the number of ways to form the committees without considering their indistinguishability. This involves selecting 3 people out of 9, then 3 out of the remaining 6, and finally 3 out of the remaining 3. Using combinations:

\[
\binom{9}{3} \cdot \binom{6}{3} \cdot \binom{3}{3} = 84 \cdot 20 \cdot 1 = 1680
\]

Since the committees are identical, the order in which they are selected does not matter. Therefore, we must divide by the number of ways to arrange the 3 committees, which is \(3!\):

\[
\frac{1680}{3!} = \frac{1680}{6} = 280
\]

Thus, the total number of ways to divide the 9 people into 3 identical committees is 280.

The correct answer is:

G: 280
