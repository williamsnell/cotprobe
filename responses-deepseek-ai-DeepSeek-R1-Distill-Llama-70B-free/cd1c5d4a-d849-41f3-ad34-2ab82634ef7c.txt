Okay, so I have this question about calculating the return on invested capital, ROIC. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I'll try to think it through.

The data given is: Net investments on Dec 31, 1966 is $250,000, and on Dec 31, 1967 it's $350,000. Net sales for 1967 are $600,000, and net income is $25,000. The options are from A to J with percentages.

Wait, ROIC usually measures how well a company uses invested capital to generate profits. I remember that ROIC is typically calculated as Net Income divided by Invested Capital. But wait, Invested Capital could be the average of the beginning and ending balances, right? Because investments can change during the year.

So, the formula might be ROIC = (Net Income) / (Average Invested Capital). Let me confirm. Yes, average invested capital is (Beginning + Ending)/2. So in this case, beginning is 250k, ending is 350k, so average is (250k + 350k)/2 = 300k.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, Invested Capital is calculated as total equity plus long-term debt, but in this problem, it's given as net investments. I think in this context, net investments refer to the total invested capital. So I can proceed with that.

So, Net Income is $25,000. Average Invested Capital is $300,000. So ROIC is 25,000 / 300,000. Let me compute that. 25 divided by 300 is... 25/300 is approximately 0.083333. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 8.333... So about 8.3%.

Looking at the options, option F is 8.3%. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait another thought. Could there be another way to calculate it? Like using ending invested capital instead of average? If I do that, 25,000 divided by 350,000 is about 7.14%, which would be around 7.1%, which is option B. But I think the correct approach is to use the average because the investment amount changes during the year, and using average gives a better representation.

Alternatively, maybe some people use the beginning or ending value. But in finance, when a balance sheet figure changes, the average is usually preferred for calculations like ROIC or ROCE. So I'm more confident that the correct calculation is 25k / 300k = 8.3%, so F.

The return on invested capital (ROIC) is calculated using the formula:

\[
ROIC = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Average Invested Capital}}
\]

From the data provided:
- Net Income for 1967 = $25,000
- Net Investments (Beginning) = $250,000
- Net Investments (Ending) = $350,000

The average invested capital is:

\[
\text{Average Invested Capital} = \frac{\text{Beginning Net Investments} + \text{Ending Net Investments}}{2} = \frac{250,000 + 350,000}{2} = 300,000
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
ROIC = \frac{25,000}{300,000} = 0.0833 \approx 8.3\%
\]

Thus, the return on invested capital is approximately **8.3%**, corresponding to option **F**.

Answer: F
