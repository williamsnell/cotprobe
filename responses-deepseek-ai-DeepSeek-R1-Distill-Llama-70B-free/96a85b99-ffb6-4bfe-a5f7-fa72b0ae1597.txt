Question:

On September 1, a buyer contracted to purchase10,000 widgets from a seller for $1 per widget, delivery to be made no later than September 30. On September 15, a worldwide shortage of widgets caused a steep increase in the market price for widgets, so the seller decided not to deliver the widgets to the buyer. The seller sent a letter to the buyer, stating that the widgets would not be delivered. The buyer received the seller's letter on September 20. On October 15, the buyer filed suit against the seller for breach of contract. In determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled, which of the following would be taken as the market price of widgets?

Options:

A: The market price on September 15.
B: The market price on the date of filing the lawsuit.
C: The highest market price recorded between September 1 and October 15.
D: The average market price between September 1 and September 30.
E: The market price on October 15.
F: The market price on September 1.
G: The market price on September 20.
H: The market price on September 30.
I: The market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.
J: The market price on the date the contract was signed.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question here about a buyer and a seller dealing with widgets. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the scenario is that on September 1, a buyer contracts to purchase 10,000 widgets at $1 each. The delivery is supposed to be by September 30. But then on September 15, there's a worldwide shortage, causing the market price to go up a lot. The seller decides not to deliver and sends a letter to the buyer on the 15th, which the buyer receives on the 20th. The buyer then sues on October 15.

The question is about determining the market price for damages. The options are A through J, each giving different dates. I need to figure out which date is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when a seller breaches a contract, the buyer can recover damages based on the market price at a certain time. I think it's either the time when the contract was supposed to be performed or when the buyer learned of the breach. Wait, which one is it? 

I recall something about the "market differential" approach. The general rule under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) for breach of sales contracts is that the measure of damages is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the contract price. So when is that time?

If the seller repudiates the contract, the time for determining the market price is when the buyer learns of the repudiation, or perhaps when the seller indicates they won't perform. Alternatively, if the seller fails to deliver on the due date, maybe the market price is assessed at that time.

Wait, let me think. Under UCC §2-708, which deals with seller's remedies, but since the question is about buyer's damages, maybe it's covered elsewhere. Oh, right, UCC §2-708(1) talks about when a buyer can get the difference between market price and contract price. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Another approach: when the contract is breached, the buyer can cover by purchasing substitute goods. The time of cover would be relevant, but that's when the buyer actually buys them, which might not be the case here. Alternatively, if the buyer doesn't cover, then the market price at the time of breach might be used.

Wait, in this case, the seller repudiated the contract by informing the buyer on September 15 (sent on 15th, received on 20th). So the repudiation is treated as a total breach. I think the market price would be determined as of the time the goods were supposed to be delivered, which is September 30. Because the seller's obligation was to deliver by then. So the buyer is entitled to the difference between the contract price and the market price on the due date.

Alternatively, maybe it's when the buyer learned of the breach. But I think the rule is that the market price is determined at the time the goods were supposed to be delivered, not when the buyer found out about the breach. Because the seller's obligation was to perform by that date. 

So looking at the options, the market price on September 30 is option H. Option I says the market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered, which is also September 30. So both H and I point to the same date. Wait, looking back, the options are:

H: The market price on September 30.

I: The market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.

Since the delivery was supposed to be by September 30, both H and I describe the same date. So the correct answer would be either H or I.

Wait, no, looking at the actual options again:

Option H is September 30.

Option I is the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered, which is September 30.

So H and I are the same. But looking back, the options are labeled from A to J. So in the given options, I think the correct answer is H or I.

Wait, but let me make sure. The UCC typically uses the time when the goods were due. So yes, the market price on the due date is the correct measure. So the answer would be H or I, but since both point to the same date, perhaps the correct option is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's phrased as the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered, which is more precise. But looking at the options, let me read again.

Options:

H: The market price on September 30.

I: The market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.

So both H and I are the same. But since September 30 is the due date, the correct choice is H or I. Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

The options are:

A: 9/15

B: date of filing (10/15)

C: highest between 9/1 and 10/15

D: average between 9/1 and 9/30

E: 10/15

F: 9/1

G:9/20

H:9/30

I: when supposed to be delivered (same as H)

J: contract signed (9/1)

So the correct choice is either H or I. But what does the question ask? It says which of the following would be taken as the market price. So it's possible that the answer is H, since that's the specific date. Alternatively, perhaps I is correct because it's expressed in terms of the contract terms.

Wait, the UCC §2-708(1) says that if the seller fails to deliver, the buyer can recover the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the contract price. The time for tender is when the goods were supposed to be delivered. So the market price is determined as of the time the seller was supposed to deliver, which is September 30.

So the answer should be H. Wait, but option I says the same thing. Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

Option I: the market price on the date the widgets were supposed to be delivered.

Which is September 30. So both H and I are correct. But in the options, only one can be correct. Wait, no, that can't be. Oh wait, no, H and I are the same, but perhaps the correct option is I. Because H is a specific date, and I is a description. So perhaps the intended answer is I.

Wait, but the question is about what's taken as the market price. The correct rule is to take the market price at the time the goods were supposed to be delivered. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but looking at the options again, H is the market price on September 30, which is the same as I. So both H and I are correct. But that's impossible. So perhaps the options are designed so that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the UCC again. The general rule under UCC §2-708(1) is that the measure of damages for non-delivery is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the contract price. The time for tender is when the seller was supposed to deliver, which is the 30th. So the market price on the 30th is the correct measure.

So the correct answer should be H. Because option I is the same as H, but perhaps the options list H and I as separate. Wait, perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, but the options are from A to J, each with a different description. So H and I are both correct? That can't be. So perhaps the correct answer is H, because September 30 is the due date.

Alternatively, another thought: when the seller repudiates the contract, the buyer can consider the contract breached as of that date. In such cases, the market price is determined as of the time the buyer learns of the repudiation, which would be September 20. But that would be G. But I don't think that's correct because the seller's obligation was to deliver by the 30th. So the buyer is entitled to the market price on the 30th.

Wait, another angle: When the seller anticipatorily repudiates the contract, the buyer can treat the contract as breached and immediately recover damages. In such cases, the market price is determined at the time of repudiation or when the buyer learns of it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the majority rule is that upon repudiation, the market price is determined as of the time the goods were to be delivered. So the due date is the key.

So in this case, the correct date is September 30, which is option H.

In this scenario, the buyer contracted to purchase 10,000 widgets at $1 each, with delivery due by September 30. The seller repudiated the contract on September 15, and the buyer received notice on September 20. The buyer filed suit on October 15, and the question is about determining the market price for calculating damages.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) §2-708(1), the measure of damages for a seller's breach is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the contract price. The "time for tender" is when the goods were supposed to be delivered, which in this case is September 30. Therefore, the market price on September 30 is the correct measure for damages.

Analyzing the options:

- **A (September 15):** This is the date of repudiation but not the time for tender. Incorrect.
- **B (October 15):** This is the date of filing the lawsuit, which is irrelevant to the time for tender. Incorrect.
- **C (Highest price between September 1 and October 15):** The market price at the time of tender is the relevant measure, not the highest price during this period. Incorrect.
- **D (Average price between September 1 and September 30):** The market price at the time of tender is the correct measure, not an average. Incorrect.
- **E (October 15):** Same as option B. Incorrect.
- **F (September 1):** This is the date of the contract signing, not the time for tender. Incorrect.
- **G (September 20):** This is when the buyer received notice of the repudiation, but damages are based on the time for tender, not the notice date. Incorrect.
- **H (September 30):** This is the date the goods were supposed to be delivered, aligning with the time for tender. Correct.
- **I (Date the widgets were supposed to be delivered):** This is the same as September 30, making it correct. However, since both H and I describe the same date, H is the most specific and appropriate choice.
- **J (September 1):** Same as option F. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **H**, as it directly corresponds to the market price on September 30, the time for tender.

Answer: H
