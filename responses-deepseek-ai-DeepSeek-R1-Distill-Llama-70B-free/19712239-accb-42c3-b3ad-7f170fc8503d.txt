Question:

Donny threw a knife at Sally, intending to injure her severely. However, Donny missed Sally. Sally saw the knife just as it whizzed by her head, missing it by about one inch. As a result, Sally was very scared. Sally sued Donny for assault and battery. Which of the following is most correct?

Options:

C: Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed Sally with the knife.
D: Donny will be liable for assault and for battery.
E: Donny will not be liable for either assault or battery because this is only a criminal matter.
F: Donny will not be liable for either assault or battery because Sally was not physically harmed.
G: Donny will be liable for assault and battery because he intended to cause harm.
H: Donny will be liable for both assault and battery because Sally was terrified.
I: Donny will be liable for battery, but not assault because Sally was able to dodge the knife.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with assault and battery. Hmm, I remember that assault and battery are two separate torts but they often go together. Let me try to break this down.

So the scenario is Donny threw a knife at Sally intending to injure her severely. He missed, but the knife came really close, like an inch from her head. Sally saw it and got scared. Now she's suing Donny for both assault and battery. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I should recall the definitions of assault and battery. From what I remember, battery is the intentional harmful or offensive touching of another person without consent. So for battery, there needs to be actual physical contact. Assault, on the other hand, is an intentional act that causes another person to fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. So assault doesn't require actual contact, just the apprehension of it.

In this case, Donny threw the knife, but missed. So there's no physical contact, right? So for battery, since there's no touching, I don't think battery applies here. So options that say Donny is liable for battery can probably be ruled out. Let me look at the options.

Option A says battery but not assault. Well, if there's no contact, battery isn't possible, so A is probably wrong.

Option B says he's not liable for either because he didn't hit her. That makes sense for battery, but what about assault? Because Sally did feel fear. So maybe B is incorrect because he could still be liable for assault.

Option C says he's liable for assault but not battery. That seems plausible because he created the apprehension without actual contact.

Option D says both, but if he missed, battery didn't happen, so D is probably wrong.

Option E says no liability because it's criminal. But torts are civil, so E is incorrect because this is a civil matter as well.

Option F says no liability because she wasn't physically harmed. But assault doesn't require physical harm, just the fear. So F is wrong.

Option G says liable for both because he intended harm. But intent is there, but battery needs contact, which didn't happen. So G is incorrect.

Option H says liable for both because Sally was terrified. Again, battery requires contact, so H is wrong.

Option I says battery but not assault because she dodged. But she didn't have contact, so battery is out. So I is wrong.

Option J says liable for assault but not battery. Wait, that's the same as option C. Wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option C: liable for assault, not battery. Option J says the same? Or maybe I misread. Let me check.

Wait, looking back: option C is "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed Sally with the knife." Option J is "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery." So both C and J are similar, but probably J is a duplicate, but I think in the options, each is unique. Wait no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the options are A-J, each with different reasoning. So in the given options, C and J are similar but perhaps worded differently. Wait, no, looking again: the options are from A to J, each a distinct choice. So, for this scenario, since Donny missed, battery isn't possible. But for assault, the act of throwing the knife and Sally's reasonable apprehension of contact would make assault applicable.

So the correct answer should be that Donny is liable for assault but not battery. Looking at the options, option C says exactly that. Option J says the same thing but the reasoning might differ. Wait, no. Let me read them carefully.

Option C: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed Sally with the knife." That makes sense because assault is about the act causing fear, and battery requires contact which didn't happen.

Option J: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery." So J is more general, but the reasoning is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is that Donny is liable for assault but not battery, which would be option C or J. Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: assault, not battery because he missed.

Option J: assault, not battery.

Wait, so both options C and J have the same outcome, but in the options, each is a choice. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Wait, maybe I should think again: in some jurisdictions, is a near miss enough for assault? Because the knife came very close, Sally saw it, and was scared. So that should be assault.

So the correct answer would be that Donny is liable for assault, but not battery. So looking at the options, both C and J say that, but wait, no, looking again, perhaps I misread the options.

Wait, let me read the options again:

Option C: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed Sally with the knife."

Option J: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery."

Wait, both options C and J suggest the same outcome, but perhaps the reasoning in C is incorrect. Wait, no, because the reasoning in C is because he missed, which is correct for battery, but assault is about the act, so the reasoning is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought only one option can be correct. Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the options. The options are:

A: Battery only.

B: Neither.

C: Assault only.

D: Both.

E: Neither, criminal matter.

F: Neither, no harm.

G: Both, intent.

H: Both, because scared.

I: Battery only.

J: Assault only.

So the correct answer is option C or J. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let me list them clearly.

Looking at the options:

A: Battery, not assault.

B: Neither.

C: Assault, not battery (reason: missed).

D: Both.

E: Neither, criminal.

F: Neither, no harm.

G: Both, intent.

H: Both, scared.

I: Battery, not assault.

J: Assault, not battery.

Wait, so both C and J have the same outcome. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question gives 10 options, from A to J. So perhaps C and J are different. Let me re-examine.

In the question, the options are:

Option C: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed Sally with the knife."

Option J: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery."

Wait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all options again.

The options are:

A: D liable for battery, not assault.

B: Not liable for either.

C: D liable for assault, not battery (because missed).

D: D liable for both.

E: Not liable, criminal matter.

F: Not liable, no physical harm.

G: Both, because intent.

H: Both, because scared.

I: D liable for battery, not assault.

J: D liable for assault, not battery.

Wait, so both options C and J have the same outcome: Donny liable for assault, not battery. But the difference is that option C gives a reason (because he missed), while J doesn't. So perhaps both C and J are correct in outcome, but only one is the right choice.

Wait, but that can't be. Each option is unique. So perhaps I made a mistake. No, perhaps in the options, only one has the correct outcome. Wait, but the options are A-J, each with distinct reasoning and outcome.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because he's liable for assault because he created the apprehension, and not liable for battery because he missed. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, maybe both C and J are the same, but perhaps the correct answer is C because it provides the correct reasoning.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because both C and J suggest the same outcome. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because the reasoning is explicit: because he missed, so no battery, but assault because of the act.

But I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another approach: in tort law, assault is about the reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. So when Donny threw the knife, and Sally saw it coming close, that's an assault. Battery requires actual contact, which didn't happen.

So Donny is liable for assault, but not battery. So the correct answer would be either C or J.

Looking back at the options, option C states that Donny is liable for assault but not battery because he missed. That makes sense. Option J also states the same outcome but without the reason. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but in some sources, the answer might be that both assault and battery can occur even without contact. Wait, no, battery requires contact. So no, battery isn't possible here.

Thus, the correct answer is that Donny is liable for assault but not battery, which is option C or J.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed Sally with the knife."

Option J: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery."

So both options C and J have the same outcome. But that's impossible because each option is unique. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let me double-check the original options.

Wait, the options provided in the question are:

A: D liable for battery, not assault.

B: Not liable for either.

C: D liable for assault, not battery (because missed).

D: Both.

E: Neither, criminal.

F: Neither, no harm.

G: Both because intent.

H: Both because scared.

I: D liable for battery, not assault.

J: D liable for assault, not battery.

So both options C and J have the same outcome, but different reasoning. But that can't be, as each option is a distinct choice. Therefore, perhaps I'm mistaken, and only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the reasoning is correct: no battery because he missed, but assault because of the act.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option J. But why? Because the outcome is correct regardless of the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C because it correctly states the reason for not being liable for battery. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, another thought: in some jurisdictions, does the mere intent and act suffice for assault even if the person couldn't have actually been hit? For example, if someone throws something but misses by a mile, maybe that's not assault. But here, the knife missed by an inch, so Sally was in imminent apprehension. So yes, assault applies.

Thus, the correct answer should be that Donny is liable for assault but not battery, which is option C or J. But looking again, perhaps option C is the correct choice because it provides the correct reasoning.

Wait, but maybe the options are structured so that only one is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option C.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze the scenario under the definitions of assault and battery in tort law:

1. **Battery**: Requires intentional, harmful, or offensive physical contact with the plaintiff. Since Donny missed Sally and there was no physical contact, battery does not apply.

2. **Assault**: Involves an intentional act that causes the plaintiff to reasonably fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. Here, Donny's act of throwing the knife, which came very close to Sally, created a reasonable apprehension of harm. Thus, assault applies.

Given this analysis, Donny is liable for assault but not battery. Among the options, both **C** and **J** state this outcome. However, **C** explicitly provides the correct reasoning: Donny is not liable for battery because he missed Sally, but he is liable for assault due to the act causing apprehension. Therefore, **C** is the most accurate choice.

**Answer: C**
