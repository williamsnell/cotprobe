Question:

A police officer carries out hundreds of traffic stops every year. When his supervisor is reviewing the officerâ€™s records for the past year, he notices that the officer is equally likely to stop people of various genders, ages, and races. However, he is significantly more likely to write tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When confronted with this fact, the officer truthfully states that he has no idea why that is, and that it must simply be a coincidence. Unbeknownst to the officer, this behavior is tied to the fact that these men look like his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. What psychological framework would directly address the unconscious bias in his behavior? 

Options:

A: Gestalt
B: Developmental
C: Biopsychological
D: Humanistic
E: Cognitive behavioral
F: Positive psychology
G: Evolutionary
H: Behaviorist
I: Social cognitive
J: Psychoanalytic

Okay, so I have this psychology question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a police officer who stops people of various genders, ages, and races equally, but he's more likely to give tickets to middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. When asked, he says it's just a coincidence and he doesn't know why. But the real reason is that these men resemble his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship as a child. The question is asking which psychological framework directly addresses this unconscious bias in his behavior.

Alright, so the key points here are the unconscious bias and the underlying reason being related to past experiences, specifically a childhood trauma involving his father. The officer isn't aware of why he's acting this way, so it's an unconscious process.

Let me think about the different psychological frameworks listed in the options. I'm a bit rusty on some of these, but I'll try to recall.

Option A: Gestalt psychology. I remember that Gestalt focuses on how we organize and perceive the world around us, like the idea that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. It's more about perception and cognitive organization, not so much about unconscious motivations or past experiences influencing behavior. So maybe not A.

Option B: Developmental psychology. This deals with human development across the lifespan, including cognitive, social, and emotional growth. It could relate since the issue is tied to his childhood, but the question is about the framework that addresses the unconscious bias in his behavior now. I'm not sure if developmental is the direct answer here.

Option C: Biopsychological. This is about the biological basis of behavior, like the brain and nervous system. It might look at how brain structures influence actions, but the scenario here seems more related to psychological processes rather than biological ones. So probably not C.

Option D: Humanistic. Humanistic psychology emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and individual potential. It's more about conscious experiences and the present moment, rather than unconscious drives from the past. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E: Cognitive behavioral. This framework focuses on how thoughts and behaviors influence each other. It's about identifying and changing negative thought patterns. While it deals with the cognitive aspects, the scenario here is about an unconscious process, which cognitive behavioral might touch on, but I'm not sure it's the best fit.

Option F: Positive psychology. This field looks at positive emotions and strengths, aiming to help people thrive. It doesn't really address unconscious biases or past traumas influencing behavior, so F is probably out.

Option G: Evolutionary psychology. This explains behavior in terms of evolutionary principles, like natural selection. It might address why certain traits exist, but again, the scenario here is about a specific unconscious bias linked to personal history, not evolutionary factors. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H: Behaviorist. Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and discounts the role of the unconscious mind. Since the officer's actions are influenced by unconscious factors, behaviorism might not be the framework that addresses this. So H is probably not the answer.

Option I: Social cognitive. This theory, developed by Albert Bandura, looks at how people learn through observing others and how cognitive processes affect behavior in social contexts. It does involve learning and observation, but the scenario here is about unconscious influences from past trauma. I'm not sure if social cognitive directly addresses this, though it might touch on observational learning.

Option J: Psychoanalytic. Psychoanalysis, founded by Freud, deals with unconscious thoughts, desires, and past experiences influencing behavior. The idea that unconscious memories or conflicts, like an abusive relationship with a father, would affect current behavior without the person being aware of it is a core concept here. The officer's actions are driven by unconscious associations, which aligns with the psychoanalytic perspective.

Putting it all together, the officer's behavior is influenced by an unconscious bias stemming from his past traumatic relationship with his father. The framework that directly addresses such unconscious influences is psychoanalytic theory. So the correct answer should be J.

The question involves a police officer whose unconscious bias leads him to disproportionately issue tickets to middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes. This behavior is linked to an unresolved childhood trauma involving an abusive relationship with his father, whom these men resemble. The task is to identify the psychological framework that directly addresses such unconscious influences.

Analyzing the options:

- **Gestalt (A):** Focuses on perception and cognitive organization, not unconscious motivations.
- **Developmental (B):** Examines lifespan development but doesn't directly address unconscious bias.
- **Biopsychological (C):** Explores biological bases of behavior, not psychological unconscious processes.
- **Humanistic (D):** Emphasizes self-actualization and conscious experiences, not unconscious drives.
- **Cognitive Behavioral (E):** Addresses thoughts and behaviors but doesn't focus on unconscious influences.
- **Positive Psychology (F):** Centers on well-being and strengths, unrelated to unconscious bias.
- **Evolutionary (G):** Explains behavior through evolutionary principles, not personal unconscious history.
- **Behaviorist (H):** Focuses on observable behaviors, dismissing unconscious factors.
- **Social Cognitive (I):** Involves learning and social contexts but doesn't directly address unconscious trauma.
- **Psychoanalytic (J):** Examines unconscious thoughts and past experiences influencing behavior, aligning with the scenario.

The psychoanalytic framework directly addresses how unconscious memories and past traumas, such as the officer's abusive relationship with his father, influence current behavior without conscious awareness.
