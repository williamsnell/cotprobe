Okay, so I've got this question in front of me about the average speeds of different gas molecules in a mixture. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that the speed of gas molecules is related to their molar mass, right? Let me think.

The question is asking which gas has the fastest molecules on average in a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen at a given temperature. The options are A through J, each giving different possibilities.

Wait, I recall something about Graham's Law, which deals with effusion rates. But wait, effusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So lighter molecules effuse faster. But does that same principle apply to their average speeds in a mixture?

Oh right, in a gas mixture at the same temperature, all gases have the same average kinetic energy. Because kinetic energy depends on temperature. So (1/2)mv² = (3/2)kT or something like that. So if KE is same, then lighter molecules must move faster because KE = ½ mv². So for lighter molecules, v has to be higher to keep KE same.

So for each gas, the average speed is higher when the molar mass is lower. Let's see, the molar masses: hydrogen is about 2 g/mol, oxygen is 32, nitrogen is 28. So hydrogen is the lightest, so it should have the highest average speed. 

Wait, but wait, the options. Let me look at the options again. Option C says hydrogen. Option C is the answer then. Because hydrogen has the lowest molar mass, so highest speed.

Wait, but another thought: the average speed is given by the root mean square speed, which is sqrt(3RT/M), where M is molar mass. So as M decreases, speed increases. So yeah, hydrogen would have the highest speed. So in the mixture, hydrogen's molecules are fastest on average.

So looking at the options: option C is hydrogen, which should be correct. Let me check the other options. Option A says Nitrogen and Hydrogen same, but O is slower. No, because Nitrogen is heavier than H, so H is faster. So A can't be right. Option B is Nitrogen, no. Option C is correct. Option D says depends on temp, but since temp is given, it's determined. So D is wrong. Option E: N and O same? No, O is heavier than N, so O is slower. E is wrong. Option F: O and H same? No, H is lighter, so faster. F is wrong. G: speed depends on density? No, because density is mass/volume. But speed is about molar mass. So G is incorrect. H: All same? No, because their masses differ. I: Speed depends on volume? No, speed is about mass and temp. J: Oxygen? No, oxygen is heavy, so slower. So the correct answer is C.

In a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases at a given temperature, the average speed of gas molecules is determined by their molar mass. According to the root mean square speed formula, \( v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} \), where \( M \) is the molar mass, lighter molecules move faster on average. 

Hydrogen has the lowest molar mass (\( \approx 2 \, \text{g/mol} \)), followed by nitrogen (\( \approx 28 \, \text{g/mol} \)), and then oxygen (\( \approx 32 \, \text{g/mol} \)). Therefore, hydrogen molecules have the highest average speed in the mixture. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J** are incorrect because they either misrepresent the relationship between molar mass and speed or fail to account for the correct ordering of speeds.
- **D** is incorrect because the speed can be determined at a given temperature.
- **C** is correct as it identifies hydrogen as having the fastest average speed.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: hydrogen**.
