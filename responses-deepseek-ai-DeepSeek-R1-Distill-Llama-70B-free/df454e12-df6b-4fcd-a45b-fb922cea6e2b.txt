Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a uniform circular disk oscillating. Hmm, I need to find the period of its small oscillations. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The disk is pivoted at a point 20 cm from its center. Wait, the radius of the disk is 25 cm, so the pivot is inside the disk but not at the center. That means it's like a physical pendulum, right? Because it's not a simple pendulum where the mass is a point at the end of a massless rod.

I remember that for a physical pendulum, the period is given by T = 2π√(I/(mgh)), where I is the moment of inertia about the pivot point, m is the mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the distance from the center of mass to the pivot.

So first, I need to find the moment of inertia of the disk about the pivot point. The disk is uniform, so its moment of inertia about its central axis (which is perpendicular to the disk and through its center) is (1/2)MR². But here, the pivot is offset from the center by 20 cm, so I should use the parallel axis theorem.

The parallel axis theorem says that I = I_cm + Md², where d is the distance between the two axes. So I_cm is (1/2)MR². The distance d here is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters.

Wait, but I also need to make sure about the units. The radius of the disk is 25 cm, so R is 0.25 meters. The pivot is 20 cm from the center, so d is 0.2 m.

So I = (1/2)MR² + MR² * (d)^2? Wait, no. Let me think: I_cm is (1/2)MR², and then the parallel axis adds Md². So I = (1/2)MR² + MR²d²? Wait no, the second term is M*(d)^2. So yes, I = (1/2)MR² + M d².

But wait, wait, that can't be right because the units for I would be kg m², which is correct. So that's the moment of inertia about the pivot.

Next, the distance h is the distance from the center of mass to the pivot. Since the disk's center of mass is at its geometric center, h is 0.2 m.

So putting it all together, T = 2π√(I/(m g h)).

Let me compute I first. I = (1/2) M R² + M d². Factor out M: I = M ( (1/2) R² + d² )

So I/(m g h) = [ M (0.5 R² + d²) ] / (M g h) ) → The Ms cancel out.

So I/(m g h) = (0.5 R² + d²) / (g h)

Substituting the values:

R = 0.25 m, so R² = 0.0625 m².
d = 0.2 m, so d² = 0.04 m².

So 0.5 * R² = 0.5 * 0.0625 = 0.03125 m².
Adding d²: 0.03125 + 0.04 = 0.07125 m².

Denominator is g h. Given that g is π² m/s², which is approximately 9.87 m/s². h is 0.2 m.

So denominator g h = π² * 0.2.

Putting it all together:

I/(m g h) = 0.07125 / (π² * 0.2) = 0.07125/(0.2 π² )

Calculate numerator: 0.07125 = 71.25e-3.

Wait, 0.07125 divided by 0.2 is 0.35625.

So 0.35625 / π² → let me compute that.

π² is about 9.8696. So 0.35625 / 9.8696 ≈ 0.03607.

So sqrt(0.03607) is approximately 0.1899 seconds.

Wait, no. Wait, T is 2π times sqrt(I/(m g h)), so let me re-express:

T = 2π * sqrt( I/(m g h) )

We have I/(m g h) = 0.07125 / (π² * 0.2) = 0.07125/(0.2 π²) → Wait, that's 0.07125/(0.2 * π²) = (0.07125 / 0.2) / π² → 0.35625 / π² → which is approximately 0.03607 as before.

So sqrt(0.03607) ≈ 0.1899, then multiply by 2π.

2π * 0.1899 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.1899 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.1899 ≈ 1.193 seconds.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.193 s.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, I think I might have messed up when calculating I. No, I think that's correct. Let me recheck the steps.

I = (1/2) M R² + M d² → correct.

I/(m g h) = (0.5 R² + d²) / (g h) → correct.

R=0.25 m → R²=0.0625, 0.5 R²=0.03125.

d=0.2 m → d²=0.04.

Sum is 0.07125.

Divide by g h: g is π², h is 0.2. So denominator is π² * 0.2.

So 0.07125 / (0.2 π²) → 0.35625 / π².

Then, T = 2π sqrt(0.35625/(π²)).

Wait, wait, no. The expression is sqrt( (0.07125) / (0.2 π²) ), which is sqrt(0.35625/(π²)).

Wait, sqrt(0.35625/(π²)) is sqrt(0.35625)/π.

Because sqrt(a²/b²) is a/b, but in this case, it's sqrt( (a)/(b) ), which would be sqrt(a)/sqrt(b) = sqrt(a)/b^(1/2).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as follows:

0.35625 = (0.5975)^2 ?

Wait, 0.6^2 is 0.36, so 0.5975^2 is approximately 0.356. So sqrt(0.35625) is 0.5975 approximately.

So sqrt(0.35625/(π²)) is 0.5975 / π.

Because π squared is denominator: sqrt(0.35625) is 0.5975, and sqrt(1/π²) is 1/π.

So 0.5975 / π ≈ 0.5975 /3.1416 ≈ 0.1902.

Then, T=2π * 0.1902 ≈ 2 *3.1416 *0.1902 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.1902 ≈ 1.194 seconds.

Which matches my earlier calculation, so T ≈ 1.193 s, which is option E.

Wait, but let me think again about the formula for the physical pendulum. The formula is correct, right? T=2π√(I/(mgh)), yes.

Another approach: compute I first. Let's compute the numbers again.

I = (1/2) MR² + Md².

But since it's a disk, I about center is (1/2) MR², then using parallel axis, adding M*(0.2)^2.

So I = (1/2)*M*(0.25)^2 + M*(0.2)^2

= 0.5*M*0.0625 + M*0.04

= M*(0.03125 + 0.04) → M*0.07125 kg m².

Then, I/(M g h) = 0.07125 / (g * 0.2 )

g is given as π², so:

I/(M g h) = 0.07125/( π² * 0.2 )

= 0.07125 / ( 0.2 π² )

= (0.07125 / 0.2 ) / π² → 0.35625 / π².

So sqrt(0.35625 / π² ) = sqrt(0.35625)/π → 0.5975 / π ≈ 0.1902.

Then T=2π * 0.1902 ≈ 1.193 s. So option E.

I think that's correct. So the answer is E.

To determine the period of small oscillations for a uniform circular disk pivoted at a point 20 cm from its center, we treat it as a physical pendulum. The period of a physical pendulum is given by:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{I}{mgh}}
\]

where \(I\) is the moment of inertia about the pivot, \(m\) is the mass, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(h\) is the distance from the center of mass to the pivot.

### Step 1: Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia of a uniform disk about its center is:

\[
I_{\text{cm}} = \frac{1}{2}MR^2
\]

Using the parallel axis theorem, the moment of inertia about the pivot (20 cm from the center) is:

\[
I = I_{\text{cm}} + Md^2 = \frac{1}{2}MR^2 + Md^2
\]

Substituting \(R = 0.25 \, \text{m}\) and \(d = 0.2 \, \text{m}\):

\[
I = \frac{1}{2}M(0.25)^2 + M(0.2)^2 = 0.03125M + 0.04M = 0.07125M \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Period Formula
The period becomes:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{I}{mgh}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.07125M}{Mg(0.2)}}
\]

The mass \(M\) cancels out:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.07125}{g(0.2)}}
\]

Given \(g = \pi^2 \, \text{m/s}^2\):

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.07125}{\pi^2(0.2)}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{0.07125}{0.2\pi^2}}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Numerical Value
First, calculate the numerator:

\[
\frac{0.07125}{0.2} = 0.35625
\]

Now divide by \(\pi^2\):

\[
\frac{0.35625}{\pi^2} \approx \frac{0.35625}{9.8696} \approx 0.03607
\]

Take the square root:

\[
\sqrt{0.03607} \approx 0.1899
\]

Finally, multiply by \(2\pi\):

\[
T = 2\pi(0.1899) \approx 2(3.1416)(0.1899) \approx 1.193 \, \text{s}
\]

### Final Answer
The period of small oscillations is approximately **1.193 seconds**, which corresponds to option **E**.
