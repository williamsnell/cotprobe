Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a trial where the plaintiff is suing for personal injuries from a traffic accident. The plaintiff first called the defendant as an adverse party, which means the defendant is being treated as a hostile witness, I think. Then, the plaintiff calls another witness who was a passenger in the plaintiff's car and also happens to be the defendant's former employer. On direct examination, this witness testified about how the accident happened and also gave his opinion that the defendant isn't a truthful person.

Now, the question is asking which area of questioning on cross-examination would be beyond the proper scope. The options are from A to J.

I remember that cross-examination is limited to the scope of direct examination, meaning the opposing counsel can ask about topics that were covered during direct. Also, if a witness's credibility has been attacked, the other side can offer rebuttal evidence. But there's also the idea that some topics are not permissible even on cross, especially if they're irrelevant or prejudicial without being probative.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The defendant recently filed an action against the witness for breach of contract. Hmm. If the witness and defendant have a prior dispute, this might show bias. But cross-examination can explore bias. So this might be allowed.

Option B: The witness has been involved in similar traffic accidents before. This could relate to the witness's credibility regarding their testimony about this accident. Maybe it's relevant to show they've had similar experiences, but I'm not sure if it's within the scope of direct. The witness testified about how this accident occurred, so perhaps prior similar accidents could be relevant to their credibility.

Option C: The witness and defendant have a personal dispute unrelated to the traffic accident. This could definitely show bias. If the witness has a grudge against the defendant, that's relevant to their credibility. So this would be a proper area for cross.

Option D: In letters to prospective employers, the witness described the defendant as very honest and dependable. Wait, during direct, the witness said the defendant isn't truthful. So on cross, the defense could confront the witness with prior inconsistent statements. That would be relevant to impeach his credibility. So this would be allowed, making it not the answer.

Option E: The witness has been falsifying his income tax returns. This is about the witness's general dishonesty. I think specific acts of conduct that show untruthfulness can be used to impeach a witness. But I remember that under the Federal Rules, specific instances of conduct can't be proved by extrinsic evidence, but can be asked about on cross. However, if the question is about something unrelated, like tax returns, maybe it's allowed. But wait, the scope of cross is limited to the direct. Since the witness testified about the defendant's honesty, perhaps this is relevant to the witness's own credibility.

Option F: The witness has previously perjured himself in court. This directly goes to the witness's credibility. Perjury is a felony and shows he's a liar. So this is definitely allowed on cross. So F is in scope.

Option G: The plaintiff's injuries were not as serious as claimed. Hmm. In the direct, the witness testified about the accident and the defendant's honesty. The plaintiff's injuries are a separate issue. So if the question is about the injuries, it might be beyond the scope. Wait, but the plaintiff is the one claiming injuries, and the witness's testimony here is about the accident and the defendant's truthfulness. So maybe this is outside the scope. But wait, the question is about cross-examining the witness who testified about the accident. So if the plaintiff's injuries are a main issue in the case, perhaps it's allowed. But wait, cross-examination is limited to the subject matter of direct. If the witness didn't testify about the plaintiff's injuries, then cross can't go into that. So G might be beyond the scope.

Option H: The defendant has a past record of traffic violations. The witness testified about the accident, so this could be relevant to show the defendant's propensity for reckless driving, but I'm not sure if it's within the scope. Wait, during direct, the witness talked about the accident and the defendant's honesty. The defendant's traffic record might not be directly tied to that, unless it's to show that the defendant is prone to accidents, which could relate to the accident in question. But if the plaintiff's counsel didn't ask about it, maybe it's allowed on cross as it relates to the accident's facts.

Option I: The witness was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. This is relevant because it could impair his perception or memory. So it's definitely a proper line of questioning.

Option J: The defendant is planning to sue the witness for defamation. This could show that the witness has a motive to bias against the defendant, fearing a lawsuit. So it's relevant to the witness's credibility. Therefore, it's within scope.

Wait, going back to the initial question: the witness's direct testimony included how the accident occurred and his opinion on the defendant's truthfulness. So cross-examination should be limited to those topics.

So the question is which option is beyond the proper scope. So any area not covered in direct is off-limits unless it's about credibility.

So let's check each option's relevance.

Option A: Breach of contract suit between defendant and witness. This could indicate a prior dispute, showing potential bias. So it's within the scope.

Option B: Witness's prior similar accidents. Could this relate to his credibility in describing this accident? Maybe, but if the direct didn't cover his history, perhaps this is beyond the scope. Alternatively, if prior accidents show he's prone to being in accidents, perhaps it's relevant to the case, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but cross-examination can't go into new areas beyond direct unless it's about credibility. So if the direct was about the accident and the defendant's honesty, then cross about prior similar accidents might be allowed as it relates to the witness's credibility in testifying about the accident.

Option G: Plaintiff's injuries. The witness didn't testify about the plaintiff's injuries on direct. So cross can't ask about that. Because the scope of cross is limited to the direct. So G is about the plaintiff's injuries, which the witness didn't address. So this would be beyond the scope.

Other options: Let's check.

Option E: Witness falsifying tax returns. This is about his honesty, which is relevant because he testified about the defendant's honesty. So it's allowed.

Option G seems like it's outside the scope because the witness didn't testify about the plaintiff's injuries. So the cross can't delve into that area.

So the answer should be G.
</think>

In this scenario, the plaintiff called a witness who testified about the traffic accident and expressed the opinion that the defendant is not a truthful person. The question asks which area of questioning on cross-examination would most likely be beyond the proper scope. 

Under the rules of evidence, cross-examination is generally limited to the scope of direct examination, unless it pertains to the witness's credibility. Here, the witness testified about the accident and the defendant's truthfulness, so cross-examination must be limited to those topics unless it directly relates to credibility.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **A:** The defendant filing a breach of contract action against the witness could show bias, which is relevant to credibility. This is within the scope of cross-examination.  
- **B:** The witness's involvement in similar traffic accidents could relate to their credibility in describing the accident. This is within the scope.  
- **C:** A personal dispute between the witness and the defendant could show bias, making it relevant to credibility. This is within the scope.  
- **D:** The witness describing the defendant as honest in letters to prospective employers contradicts their testimony. This is a prior inconsistent statement and is relevant to credibility, so it is within the scope.  
- **E:** The witness falsifying income tax returns reflects on their honesty, which is relevant to credibility. This is within the scope.  
- **F:** The witness having previously perjured himself directly impacts his credibility. This is within the scope.  
- **G:** The plaintiff's injuries were not addressed by the witness during direct examination. Since this topic is unrelated to the witness's testimony about the accident or the defendant's truthfulness, it is beyond the proper scope of cross-examination.  
- **H:** The defendant's past traffic violations could relate to their propensity for reckless driving, which is relevant to the accident. This is within the scope.  
- **I:** The witness being under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident could impair their perception or memory, making it relevant. This is within the scope.  
- **J:** The defendant planning to sue the witness for defamation could show motive, which is relevant to credibility. This is within the scope.  

The only option that is beyond the proper scope of cross-examination is **G**, as it introduces a topic (the plaintiff's injuries) that was not addressed during the witness's direct testimony and is unrelated to the witness's credibility.

**Answer: G**
