Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The problem says that there's an old car with worn-out shock absorbers. The car has a mass of 1000 kg. A person who weighs 980 N gets into the car slowly at its center of gravity. When the person gets in, the car sinks by 2.8 cm. Then, when the car with the person hits a bump, it starts oscillating up and down in simple harmonic motion (SHM). We need to model this as a single body on a spring and find the frequency of the oscillation in Hz.

Hmm. So this is a problem about SHM and springs. I remember that the frequency of a mass-spring system is given by f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass.

First, I think I need to find the spring constant k. But wait, the car and person are treated as a single mass. So the combined mass would be the mass of the car plus the mass of the person. But wait, I have the weight of the person, which is 980 N. Oh, right, because weight is mass times gravity. So the person's mass would be 980 N divided by g, which I'll take as 9.8 m/s².

Let me calculate that. 980 / 9.8 = 100 kg. Oh wait, that's interesting—the person's mass is 100 kg, and the car's mass is 1000 kg, so together they are 1100 kg.

Wait, but when the person gets into the car, the car sinks by 2.8 cm. That means the suspension (which we're modeling as a spring) is compressed by that amount when the person's weight is applied. So the spring is being compressed because of the added weight.

I think I can use Hooke's Law here. Hooke's Law says F = -kx, where F is the force applied, x is the displacement, and k is the spring constant. But since F is the applied force, which in this case is the person's weight, right?

Wait, the person's weight is 980 N. So when the person steps in, the spring compresses by 0.028 meters (since 2.8 cm is 0.028 m). So the force F is 980 N, and the displacement x is 0.028 m.

So according to Hooke's Law, F = kx. So k = F / x.

Plugging in the numbers: k = 980 N / 0.028 m. Let me compute that.

980 divided by 0.028. Let me see, 980 divided by 28 is 35, so 0.028 is 28 * 0.001, so 980 / 0.028 = 980 * (1/0.028) = 980 * (1000/28) = 35,000. So k is 35,000 N/m.

Wait, no, wait. Wait: 980 / 0.028. Let me compute that more accurately.

0.028 is 28 x 10^-3. So 980 divided by 28 is 35, so 980 / 0.028 is 35,000. So yes, k is 35,000 N/m.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total mass. Wait, when the person gets in, the system's mass is 1000 kg + 100 kg = 1100 kg. But when calculating the spring constant, the mass isn't directly involved because Hooke's Law is about the force and displacement. So I think my approach is correct.

Now, with k found, I can find the angular frequency ω, which is sqrt(k/m). But wait, what's m here? Since the car and person are treated as a single mass, m is 1100 kg.

So ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(35000 / 1100).

Let me compute that. 35000 divided by 1100 is 35000 / 1100. Let's see: 35000 ÷ 100 is 350, 350 ÷ 11 is approximately 31.818. So ω² would be 31.818, so ω is sqrt(31.818). Let's compute sqrt(31.818). Hmm, sqrt(25) is 5, sqrt(36) is 6. So sqrt(31.8) is approx 5.64 rad/s.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 5.6 squared is 31.36, 5.64 squared is approximately 31.8. Let me see: 5.64 * 5.64 = (5 + 0.64)^2 = 25 + 2*5*0.64 + 0.64^2 = 25 + 6.4 + 0.4096 = 31.8096. That's very close to 31.818, so ω is approximately 5.64 rad/s.

But wait, the question asks for the frequency f, which is ω/(2π). So f = 5.64 / (2π). Let's compute that. 2π is about 6.2832.

5.64 / 6.2832 ≈ 0.897 Hz, approximately 0.9 Hz.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.9 Hz. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Person's mass: 980 N / 9.8 m/s² = 100 kg. Correct.

2. Total mass: 1000 + 100 = 1100 kg. Correct.

3. Spring compression x = 0.028 m, F = 980 N. So k = 980 / 0.028 = 35000 N/m. Correct.

4. Angular frequency ω = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(35000 / 1100) = sqrt(31.818) ≈ 5.64 rad/s. Correct.

5. Frequency f = ω/(2π) ≈ 5.64 / 6.283 ≈ 0.897 Hz ≈ 0.9 Hz. So the answer is J: 0.9.

Wait, but another thought: when the person steps in, the car sinks by 2.8 cm. Is that displacement due to the person's weight only, or is it considering the entire system's weight? Hmm, because the car's weight would already have compressed the spring before the person got in, right? But in this problem, the 2.8 cm is the additional displacement caused by the person's weight. So I think my approach is correct because the 980 N is the force causing that displacement. So yes, it's valid to use F=mg=980 N and x=0.028 m to find k.

So I think I did everything correctly. The frequency is approximately 0.9 Hz, which is option J.

To solve the problem, we model the car and person as a single body on a spring and calculate the frequency of oscillation in SHM. The frequency of a mass-spring system is given by:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

where \(k\) is the spring constant and \(m\) is the total mass of the system.

### Step 1: Determine the spring constant (\(k\))
When the 980-N person climbs into the car, the car sinks by 2.8 cm (0.028 m). Using Hooke's Law, \(F = kx\), we solve for \(k\):

\[
k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{980}{0.028} = 35,000 \, \text{N/m}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total mass (\(m\))
The car has a mass of 1000 kg, and the person's mass is calculated from their weight:

\[
m_{\text{person}} = \frac{980}{9.8} = 100 \, \text{kg}
\]

The total mass of the system is:

\[
m_{\text{total}} = m_{\text{car}} + m_{\text{person}} = 1000 + 100 = 1100 \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the angular frequency (\(\omega\))
The angular frequency is given by:

\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{35,000}{1100}} \approx \sqrt{31.818} \approx 5.64 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the frequency (\(f\))
The frequency is related to the angular frequency by:

\[
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{5.64}{2\pi} \approx \frac{5.64}{6.283} \approx 0.897 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the frequency is approximately \(0.9 \, \text{Hz}\).

### Final Answer:
The frequency of the oscillation is approximately \(0.9 \, \text{Hz}\), which corresponds to option **J**.
