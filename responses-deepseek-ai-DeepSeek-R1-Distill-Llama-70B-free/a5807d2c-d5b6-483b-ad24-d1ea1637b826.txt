Okay, so I've got this question about a poll tax and whether it's regressive. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but let's try to work through it.

Alright, the question says there's a poll tax of $2 per head. I remember that a poll tax is a fixed amount that everyone has to pay, regardless of their income. So it's not based on how much you earn or own. 

Wait, regressive tax... what does that mean again? Oh right, a regressive tax is one where the tax rate decreases as the taxpayer's income increases. So, poorer people end up paying a larger percentage of their income in taxes compared to wealthier individuals. 

So the question is asking why a $2 per head tax is regressive. Let me think about the options. 

Option A says everyone pays the same amount regardless of income. That sounds correct because a poll tax is a flat fee. But how does that make it regressive? Well, if everyone pays $2, then for someone with a low income, $2 is a bigger chunk of their money. For a rich person, $2 is negligible. So it's about the percentage, not the absolute amount.

Looking at the options, option G says $2 would be a higher percentage of a poor man's income than a rich man's. That makes sense. Because if you're poor, say you make $100 a month, $2 is 2% of your income. But if you're rich and make $10,000 a month, $2 is just 0.02%. So the poor pay a higher percentage, making the tax regressive.

Option B is the opposite, saying $2 is a lower percentage for the poor, which can't be right. Option C says the tax increases as income decreases, but the tax amount is fixed, so that doesn't fit. Option D says it's progressive, which is the opposite of regressive. Option E is proportional, which would mean the tax rate is the same for everyone, but that's not the case here because the percentage varies. Option F talks about exemptions, which isn't mentioned here. Option H mentions a fixed rate, which is more like a proportional tax, not regressive.

So the correct answer should be G because it points out the higher percentage for the poor.

A poll tax is a fixed amount levied on every individual, regardless of their income. This makes it a regressive tax because the same amount paid by everyone represents a larger percentage of income for poorer individuals compared to wealthier ones. For example, $2 is a significant portion of a low-income person's earnings but a negligible part of a high-income person's earnings. Among the options, option G correctly identifies that the $2 tax constitutes a higher percentage of a poor person's income than a rich person's, which is the defining characteristic of a regressive tax.

Answer: G
