Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the atomic weight of electrons given their mass. Let me see what I remember about atomic weights and moles.

The problem states that the mass of an electron is 9.109 × 10^-28 grams. And the question is asking for the atomic weight of electrons. Hmm, wait, atomic weight is usually the average mass of an element's isotopes, but here it's asking about electrons. Oh, right, electrons are subatomic particles, not atoms, so maybe this is about finding the molar mass of electrons.

I remember that molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance. And one mole contains Avogadro's number of particles, which is approximately 6.022 × 10^23 particles/mol.

So if one electron has a mass of 9.109e-28 grams, then one mole of electrons would have a mass equal to 9.109e-28 grams multiplied by Avogadro's number. Let me write that down: 

Molar mass = mass of one electron × Avogadro's number.

Plugging in the numbers: 9.109e-28 g * 6.022e23 /mol. Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me compute the exponents first. 1e-28 times 1e23 is 1e-5, but wait, because 1e-28 * 1e23 = 1e(-28+23) = 1e-5. So the numbers are 9.109 * 6.022 = let's approximate that. 9 *6 is 54, and 0.109 *6 is about 0.654, so roughly 54.654. So 54.654e-5 g/mol. But wait, 54.654e-5 is the same as 5.4654e-4 g/mol.

Let me check that multiplication again. 9.109 × 6.022. Let me do it more accurately. 

9 * 6 is 54. 9 * 0.022 is 0.198. 0.109 *6 is 0.654. 0.109 * 0.022 is about 0.0024. So adding all together: 54 + 0.198 + 0.654 + 0.0024 = 54 + (0.198+0.654)=54+0.852=54.852, plus 0.0024 gives 54.8544. So approximately 54.8544e-5 g/mol.

Wait, 54.8544 ×1e-5 is 0.000548544 g/mol. So that's 5.48544 ×10^-4 g/mol. Looking at the answer options, option F is 5.48 ×10^-4 g/mol. That seems to match.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute 9.109e-28 grams * 6.022e23 mol^-1.

So 9.109 * 6.022 = let me compute that precisely. 9 *6 is 54. 9 *0.022 is 0.198. 0.109 *6 is 0.654. 0.109 *0.022 is approximately 0.002398. So adding up: 54 +0.198 =54.198, +0.654=54.852, +0.002398=54.8544. So yes, same as before.

So 54.8544e-5 g/mol is 5.48544e-4, which rounds to 5.48e-4. So option F is 5.48 ×10^-4 g/mole. That must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents. 9.109e-28 *6.022e23 = (9.109 *6.022) * 1e(-28+23) = ... as before, 1e-5. So yes, the calculation is correct.

Looking at the options again, option F is 5.48e-4 g/mole, which matches what I got. So I think F is the correct answer.

To determine the atomic weight of electrons, we need to calculate the molar mass of electrons. The mass of a single electron is given as \( 9.109 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{g} \), and one mole of electrons contains Avogadro's number of particles, approximately \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{particles/mol} \). The molar mass is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass} = \text{mass of one electron} \times \text{Avogadro's number}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Molar mass} = (9.109 \times 10^{-28}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23}) \, \text{g/mol}
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
9.109 \times 6.022 = 54.8544
\]

Next, add the exponents:

\[
10^{-28} \times 10^{23} = 10^{-5}
\]

Thus, the molar mass is:

\[
54.8544 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{g/mol} = 5.48544 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/mol}
\]

This value rounds to \( 5.48 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/mol} \), which matches option F. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: \( 5.48 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/mole} \)**.
