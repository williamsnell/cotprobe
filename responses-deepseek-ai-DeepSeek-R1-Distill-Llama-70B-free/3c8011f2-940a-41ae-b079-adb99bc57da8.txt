Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about psychology theories, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again carefully. The question is about the notion that there are three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. I need to identify which philosopher or psychologist this idea is most consistent with.

The options are A through J, each representing different psychologists. I remember that each of these psychologists has their own theories, so I should try to recall what each one focused on.

Starting with the options, let me list them out:

A: Perls – I think he was associated with Gestalt therapy. His work was more about the present moment and the organismic self, not sure about life tasks.

B: Maslow – He's known for the hierarchy of needs. The hierarchy includes physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. I don't remember him specifically talking about three major life tasks as friendship, occupation, and love.

C: Erikson – Erik Erikson developed the theory of psychosocial development, which includes eight stages. Each stage has a specific conflict, like trust vs. mistrust in infancy. I'm trying to recall if he mentioned three specific tasks. I think he did talk about tasks related to stages, but not exactly the three mentioned here.

D: Piaget – He was a developmental psychologist focusing on cognitive development in children, with stages like sensorimotor and formal operational. Doesn't seem related to life tasks in this context.

E: Rogers – Carl Rogers is known for person-centered therapy and concepts like the fully functioning person. His focus was on self-actualization and unconditional positive regard, not specific life tasks.

F: Berne – Eric Berne developed transactional analysis, which deals with the parent, adult, and child ego states. I don't think he focused on life tasks in this way.

G: Adler – Alfred Adler, the founder of individual psychology. He emphasized social interests and striving for superiority. I remember he talked about life tasks, perhaps three main ones. Specifically, I think they were work (occupation), love (relationships), and friendship. That sounds familiar. He believed that success in these areas was important for mental health.

H: Bandura – Albert Bandura is known for social learning theory and self-efficacy. His work is more about how behaviors are learned through observation and reinforcement, not about life tasks.

I: Freud – Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis deals with the unconscious mind, id, ego, superego, and defense mechanisms. He talked about the structure of personality but not about specific life tasks in this context.

J: Jung – Carl Jung focused on analytical psychology, archetypes, and the collective unconscious. He talked about concepts like the process of individuation but not three specific life tasks.

Putting this all together, Adler (option G) seems to fit. Adler's theory includes three main life tasks: work (occupation), love (including marriage and sexual relationships), and friendship (social relationships). He believed that how individuals approach these tasks affects their mental health and well-being. So the correct answer should be G: Adler.

The question asks which philosopher or psychologist is most associated with the idea of three major life tasks: friendship, occupation, and love. After analyzing each option, Alfred Adler (option G) is the correct choice. Adler's theory of individual psychology emphasizes three key life tasks: work, love, and friendship, which are essential for mental health and well-being. 

Answer: G
