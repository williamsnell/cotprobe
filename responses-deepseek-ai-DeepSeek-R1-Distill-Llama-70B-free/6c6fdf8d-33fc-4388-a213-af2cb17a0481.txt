Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about Jack's commission. He gets 5% commission on all his sales. His sales for the week were $1,200, and we need to find out how much commission he earns.

Hmm, commission is like a percentage of the sales he makes, right? So 5% of $1,200. I'm a bit rusty on percentages, but I think to find a percentage of a number, I can convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply.

So, 5% as a decimal is 0.05. Then I multiply that by $1,200. Let me do the math here. 0.05 times 1200. Let me write that out: 0.05 * 1200.

Wait, 0.05 is the same as 5/100, so 5/100 of 1200. Alternatively, I can think of it as 1200 divided by 20 because 5% is 1/20th. Oh wait, no, 5% is 1/20? Wait, 10% is 1/10, so 5% is half of that, so 1/20. Yeah, that makes sense.

So 1200 divided by 20 is... Let me calculate that. 1200 divided by 20. 20 times 60 is 1200, right? Because 20 times 60 is 1200. So 1200 divided by 20 is 60. So that would be $60.

Looking at the options, option J is $60. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. So 5% of 100 is 5, right? So 5% of 1000 is 50. So 5% of 1200 would be 50 plus another 5% of 200. 5% of 200 is 10, so 50 plus 10 is 60. Yeah, that checks out.

Alternatively, using the decimal method: 1200 * 0.05. Let's compute that. 1200 * 0.05. 1200 times 0.05 is the same as 1200 * 5 / 100. 1200 times 5 is 6000, divided by 100 is 60. Yep, same result.

So I think I'm confident that the answer is $60, which is option J.

To determine Jack's commission, we calculate 5% of his total sales for the week, which is $1,200. Converting 5% to a decimal gives 0.05. Multiplying this by $1,200 results in:

\[
0.05 \times 1200 = 60
\]

Thus, Jack earns a commission of $60. The correct answer is:

J: $60
