Question:

A home security protection company provided protection services to property owners in the immediate area. The owner of a summer cottage in the area hired the company to provide 24- hour protection during the winter months when his home was unoccupied. According to the security arrangement, the company's uniformed guards would periodically patrol the property and, if necessary, provide an "armed response" to any unauthorized individuals who were found trespassing on the property. The company provided security protection to the owner's property for two years. The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage. As a result, he requested that the company discontinue its home-protection service, effective immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was ransacking it. As the burglar was exiting from the owner's house carrying a portable television set, he was seen by a security guard working for the company. The security guard, who was driving past the home on security patrol, had not been informed that the owner had discontinued protection services. The security guard suddenly stopped his patrol vehicle and ran toward the burglar shouting, "Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot!" Startled, the burglar dropped the television set and began to flee. Believing that the suspected burglar was about to escape, the security guard pulled out his service revolver and fired a bullet at the burglar. The shot struck the burglar in the leg, seriously wounding him. If the burglar asserts a claim against the owner for negligently failing to supervise those providing security services for the owner's property, the burglar will probably

Options:

A: not prevail, because the security guard was acting in the course of his duties.
B: prevail, because the burglar was unarmed when he was shot.
C: prevail, because the security guard acted without proper authorization.
D: prevail, because the security guard used excessive force.
E: not prevail, because the owner was not present when the shooting occurred.
F: not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.
G: prevail, because the owner knew or had reason to know that the company provided an "armed response" to suspected trespassers.
H: not prevail, because the owner had no control over the actions of the security guard.
I: prevail, because the owner did not properly inform the company of the discontinued services.
J: not prevail, because the burglar was trespassing on private property.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about negligence and liability. Let me read through the problem again and break it down step by step.

So, there's a home security company that was hired by the owner of a summer cottage to provide 24-hour protection during the winter when the cottage was empty. The arrangement included uniformed guards patrolling the property and providing an armed response if they found trespassers. This service went on for two years. Then, the owner decided to sell the cottage and told the company to stop the protection services immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke in. A security guard from the company, who wasn't informed about the discontinuation, saw the burglar leaving with a TV. The guard yelled, the burglar dropped the TV and started running. The guard shot him in the leg, seriously wounding him.

Now, the burglar is suing the owner for negligently failing to supervise the security services. The question is whether the burglar will prevail.

I need to think about the legal principles here. The main issue is whether the owner is liable for the guard's actions. The claim is based on negligent supervision.

First, I should consider the concept of vicarious liability. But wait, vicarious liability usually applies when an employer is liable for the actions of an employee performed within the scope of their employment. However, in this case, the owner is the client, not the employer of the security company. So the security company's employees are not the owner's employees. Therefore, the owner isn't automatically liable for their actions under vicarious liability.

But the question is about negligent supervision. Did the owner fail to supervise the security services properly, leading to the guard's actions?

The owner had hired the security company, but when he decided to sell, he told the company to stop services immediately. But the guard wasn't informed, so he was still patrolling and responding as if the service was active.

So the issue is whether the owner had a duty to ensure that the security company's employees were properly informed about the termination. If the owner didn't inform the company, or the company didn't inform its guards, could that be a failure to supervise, making the owner liable?

Wait, the owner told the company to discontinue services. So the company should have informed their guards. But if they didn't, is that the owner's responsibility? The owner isn't the employer of the guards, so I'm not sure the owner has a duty to supervise the guards directly.

Alternatively, maybe the owner should have taken steps to ensure that the termination was communicated to all relevant parties, including the guards. If the guard was acting under the impression that he was still providing security, perhaps the owner's failure to notify the guards could be seen as negligent supervision.

But I'm not sure. The owner notified the company, which is the employer. Typically, the employer is responsible for informing their employees. The owner isn't in a position to directly inform the guards. So maybe the owner didn't have a duty to do so beyond notifying the company.

Another angle: the security arrangement included armed response. The owner knew that the guards were authorized to use force when they encountered trespassers. If the guard used excessive force, could the owner be liable for that?

But the question is about negligent supervision, not the use of excessive force. So the focus is on whether the owner failed to properly supervise the security services, leading to the guard's actions.

Wait, the owner told the company to stop services. But the guard was still patrolling and responded as if the service was ongoing. So the guard was acting beyond his authority because the service was discontinued. If the guard wasn't authorized to be there, then his actions might not be within the scope of his employment with the company. But the owner's connection here is whether he failed to supervise the security company's actions.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options given.

Option A: Not prevail because the guard was acting in the course of his duties. But if the services were discontinued, maybe he wasn't acting within his duties anymore. So this might not apply.

Option B: Prevail because the burglar was unarmed. I don't think that's the main issue here; the question is about the owner's negligence, not the guard's justification for shooting.

Option C: Prevail because the guard acted without authorization. But again, the owner's liability would depend on whether he was responsible for the guard's unauthorized actions.

Option D: Prevail because of excessive force. But again, the claim is about negligent supervision, not the guard's actions directly.

Option E: Not prevail because the owner wasn't present. Presence isn't the issue; it's about supervision.

Option F: Not prevail because the owner had discontinued services when the shooting happened. So if the services were discontinued, maybe the guard was no longer acting on behalf of the owner, so the owner isn't liable.

Option G: Prevail because the owner knew about the armed response. Maybe this is about the owner knowing that the guards were armed and might use force, leading to a duty to supervise.

Option H: Not prevail because the owner had no control over the guard. Since the guard isn't the owner's employee, the owner can't control the guard's actions.

Option I: Prevail because the owner didn't properly inform the company. So if the owner failed to inform the company properly, leading to the guard's mistake, that could be negligence.

Option J: Not prevail because the burglar was trespassing. But trespassing doesn't necessarily mean the owner isn't liable for the guard's actions.

So, considering these options, let's think about the key points.

The owner hired the company and then told them to stop. The guard, not knowing, continued to patrol and responded. The guard's actions were based on the initial arrangement but after the termination.

So, the question is whether the owner is liable for the guard's actions after the termination. If the owner had a duty to ensure that the guards were informed, perhaps. But typically, the employer (the security company) is responsible for informing their employees. The owner isn't the employer, so he doesn't have control over the guards. Therefore, the owner might not be liable because he had no control over the guard's actions.

Alternatively, the owner could be seen as having a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that the services were indeed terminated, which might include informing the guards. But I'm not sure that's the case. The owner informed the company, which should have taken care of it.

So, looking at the options, H says the owner isn't liable because he had no control over the guard. That seems plausible.

But wait, another angle: the owner had a duty to supervise the security company's performance. If the company failed to stop the patrols, maybe the owner is liable for not ensuring that the services were properly discontinued.

But the owner told the company to stop. If the company failed to do so, is that the owner's responsibility? Probably not, because the owner isn't the employer. The owner doesn't have the authority to control the company's day-to-day operations or inform individual guards.

So, the owner's only duty was to inform the company, which he did. The company's failure to inform the guard would be their own negligence, not the owner's.

Therefore, the owner isn't liable for the guard's actions because he had no control over the guard. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but option F says the owner had discontinued services when the shooting happened. So, if the services were discontinued, the guard wasn't acting on the owner's behalf anymore. So the owner isn't liable because the services were no longer in effect.

But the guard was still acting under the impression that the services were active, which might mean that the guard was still providing services the owner had requested, but after the termination.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that the owner didn't have control over the guard, so he can't be held responsible for the guard's actions. So the correct answer would be H: not prevail because the owner had no control over the guard.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, when you hire an independent contractor, you can be liable if you fail to supervise their activities. But generally, you're not liable for the contractor's employees' actions unless you have control over their work.

In this case, the owner hired the company, which is an independent contractor. The owner doesn't control how the company operates. So the owner isn't liable for the guard's actions because he doesn't have control.

So, the answer is H.

Wait, but another point: the owner had a duty to ensure that when he discontinued services, the guards wouldn't continue to patrol. Maybe by not ensuring that the guards were informed, the owner was negligent. So perhaps the owner is liable under negligent supervision because he didn't take steps to prevent the guards from continuing their patrols after termination.

But does the owner have that duty? The owner told the company, which is responsible for its own employees. Unless the owner had reason to know that the company wouldn't inform the guards, I don't think the owner has a duty to take further action.

So, I'm leaning towards H being the correct answer: the owner isn't liable because he had no control over the guard.

The question revolves around whether the owner of the cottage can be held liable for the security guard's actions under a theory of negligent supervision. The owner hired a security company to provide protection services, which included armed responses to trespassers. After deciding to sell the cottage, the owner informed the company to discontinue services immediately. However, the security guard was unaware of this discontinuation and continued patrolling, leading to the shooting of the burglar.

To determine liability, the key issue is whether the owner had a duty to supervise the security company or its employees. Generally, an owner who hires an independent contractor (in this case, the security company) is not liable for the contractor's employees' actions unless the owner had control over their work or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harm.

Here, the owner notified the company to stop services, which was sufficient under normal circumstances. The owner is not responsible for ensuring that the company informed its guards, as the company is an independent contractor. The guard's actions were beyond the owner's control, and the owner did not have a duty to directly supervise the guards. Therefore, the owner cannot be held liable for negligent supervision.

Option H correctly reflects this reasoning: the owner had no control over the security guard's actions, and thus the burglar will not prevail in a claim of negligent supervision.

ANSWER: H
