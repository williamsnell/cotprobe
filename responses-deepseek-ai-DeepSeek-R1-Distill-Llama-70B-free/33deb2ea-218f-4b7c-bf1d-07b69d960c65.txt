Question:

The board of a state university has adopted the following rule concerning residency requirements:"A student will be considered a legal resident of the state for the purpose of registering at the university if such person is over the age of 21 and has established a legal residence in the state for at least one year next preceding the last day of registration for credit. "A student moved to the state and immediately enrolled at the state university. Since he did not fulfill the university residency requirement, the student was required to pay $1,800 tuition each semester, which was $400 more than the tuition of state resident-students. In an action by the student challenging the constitutionality of the provision governing the determination of residency for the purpose of fixing a fee differential for out-of-state students in public college, the court will most likely declare the provision

Options:

A: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: constitutional, because the fee differential promotes a compelling state interest.
C: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.
D: constitutional, because it is within the university's rights to set tuition fees.
E: constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.
F: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
G: unconstitutional, because it discriminates against out-of-state students.
H: unconstitutional, because it infringes upon the student's right to education.
I: constitutional, because it serves a legitimate state interest in encouraging state residency.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about residency requirements for university tuition. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is that a state university has a rule where a student is considered a legal resident if they're over 21 and have lived in the state for at least a year before the last day of registration. A student moved to the state and enrolled immediately, so they didn't meet the requirement and had to pay higher tuitionâ€”$1,800 versus $1,400 for residents. The student is challenging this provision in court, arguing it's unconstitutional.

The question is asking what the court is most likely to decide. The options are from A to I, each dealing with different constitutional clauses and outcomes.

I remember that residency requirements for tuition often involve constitutional issues, particularly the Equal Protection Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Let me think about each relevant clause.

First, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. States can treat residents differently from non-residents, but only if there's a substantial reason and the law is closely related to that reason. In the case of tuition, I think the Supreme Court has dealt with this. I recall a case called Tober v. New York, but wait, more accurately, I think it was the case where a student was charged out-of-state tuition, and the court said that states have a legitimate interest in making residents pay lower tuition because they contribute to the state through taxes. So the differential is allowed because it's rationally related to the state's interest in serving its residents. So the university's rule might be constitutional under Equal Protection because it's based on a rational state interest.

But then there's the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, Section 2. That clause says that states can't discriminate against citizens of other states in terms of fundamental rights, like the right to work or access to courts. However, education isn't considered a fundamental right under this clause, or at least, distinctions in tuition have been upheld. Wait, I think in the Baldwin v. Fish and Game case, the court upheld higher fees for out-of-state elk hunters because elk were a state resource. Similarly, higher tuition for non-residents has been allowed under this clause. So maybe the Privileges and Immunities Clause doesn't make the rule unconstitutional here.

So looking at the options:

Option A says unconstitutional under Equal Protection. I'm not sure yet. Option C says unconstitutional under Privileges and Immunities. But I thought that clause allows for tuition differentials, so maybe C isn't correct.

Option I says constitutional because it serves a legitimate state interest. That sounds right because the state has an interest in residents paying lower fees since they're supported by state taxes.

Option E says constitutional because the provision doesn't trigger strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny is for things like race, religion, etc. Here, the classification is residency, which is probably under rational basis or maybe intermediate scrutiny, but I think the courts use a more lenient standard for residency-based tuition differentials.

So, putting it together, the court would find the provision constitutional because it's rationally related to a legitimate state interest, like ensuring that in-state students, who contribute via taxes, get lower tuition. So the correct answer would be either I or E. Option I says it's constitutional because it serves a legitimate state interest. Option E says it's constitutional because it doesn't trigger strict scrutiny, which is also true, but I think the reasoning would focus on the legitimate interest.

So looking at the options, option I is likely the correct answer.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a state university's residency requirement for tuition purposes. The rule mandates that a student must be over 21 and have established residency for at least one year to qualify for in-state tuition. A student who moved to the state and enrolled immediately was required to pay higher tuition, challenging the provision as unconstitutional.

The analysis focuses on two key constitutional clauses: the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2. Under the Equal Protection Clause, states may treat residents differently from non-residents if the distinction is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Courts have consistently upheld tuition differentials based on residency, as states have a legitimate interest in providing reduced tuition to residents who contribute to state revenues through taxes.

The Privileges and Immunities Clause prohibits states from discriminating against citizens of other states regarding fundamental rights. However, education is not considered a fundamental right under this clause, and courts have allowed tuition differentials as a reasonable distinction based on residency.

Given the legitimate state interest in offering lower tuition to residents, the provision is constitutional. The correct answer is:

**I: constitutional, because it serves a legitimate state interest in encouraging state residency.**
