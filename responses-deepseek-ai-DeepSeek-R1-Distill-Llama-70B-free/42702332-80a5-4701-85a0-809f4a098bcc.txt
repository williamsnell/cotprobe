Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. And then, it tells me that seven pens cost $9.24. I need to find the cost of one pencil in cents.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably figure out how much one pen costs. Because if I know the cost of a pen, I can relate it to pencils. So, seven pens cost $9.24. To get the cost of one pen, I can divide 9.24 by 7.

Wait, let me do that calculation. 9.24 divided by 7. Let me see, 7 goes into 9 once, that's 7, subtract, get 2. Bring down the 2, makes 22. 7 goes into 22 three times, that's 21, subtract, get 1. Bring down the 4, makes 14. 7 goes into 14 twice. So, 9.24 divided by 7 is 1.32. So each pen costs $1.32.

Now, the problem says that eleven pencils cost as much as three pens. So, if three pens cost, well, each pen is $1.32, so three pens would be 3 times 1.32. Let me compute that. 1.32 times 3. 1 times 3 is 3, 0.32 times 3 is 0.96, so total is 3 + 0.96 = 3.96. So three pens cost $3.96.

Since eleven pencils equal three pens in cost, that means eleven pencils also cost $3.96. So, to find the cost of one pencil, I should divide 3.96 by 11.

Let me do that division. 3.96 divided by 11. Hmm, 11 into 39. Let's see, 11 times 3 is 33, which is less than 39. So 3 goes in. 39 minus 33 is 6. Bring down the 6, making 66. 11 into 66 is exactly 6. So, the result is 0.36. Because 3.96 divided by 11 is 0.36 dollars.

Wait, but the question asks for the cost in cents, not dollars. So I need to convert dollars to cents. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, 0.36 dollars is 36 cents. So one pencil costs 36 cents.

Looking back at the options provided, option J is 36. So the answer should be J.

The cost of one pencil is 36 cents.
