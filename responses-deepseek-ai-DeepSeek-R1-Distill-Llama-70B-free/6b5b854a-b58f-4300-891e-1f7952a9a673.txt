Okay, so I've got this question about cycads and their unusual features. I'm a bit rusty on my botany, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what makes cycads remarkable among seed plants. The options are A to J, each with different features. I remember that cycads are a group of plants that have been around since the time of the dinosaurs, so they must have some unique characteristics.

Option A: They have flowers that bloom for several years before producing seeds. Hmm, I know that some plants take a long time to bloom, like bamboo, but I'm not sure about cycads. I think cycads do have cones, which are a type of flower structure, but I don't think their flowers take years to produce seeds. Maybe that's not it.

Option B: They have a unique leaf structure. I recall that cycads have tough, compound leaves that can be quite large. But I'm not sure if that's the most unusual feature. I mean, other plants have big leaves too.

Option C: They can survive in extremely cold climates. Cycads are usually found in subtropical or tropical regions, I think. So I don't believe they're known for surviving extreme cold. Maybe some can tolerate frost, but that's not their main claim to fame.

Option D: They produce large seeds. I remember that cycads do have relatively large seeds, some as big as golf balls or even larger. But is that the most unusual feature? I'm not sure. Maybe, but I feel like there's something else more unique.

Option E: Their seeds can remain dormant for up to a century before germinating. That's a long time! I think some plants have long dormancy periods, like certain cacti, but I'm not certain about cycads. I'll keep this in mind but need more info.

Option F: They possess the ability to move their leaves towards the sun. That's heliotropism, which I associate more with plants like sunflowers. I don't think cycads are known for moving their leaves much; their leaves are more rigid and don't move like that.

Option G: They form motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes. Wait, that sounds familiar. I remember that cycads, like ferns, have motile sperm. But wait, in seed plants (which cycads are part of), the typical process is that the sperm are delivered via pollen tubes and are non-motile. Oh, but cycads are a bit different. They are gymnosperms, and I think they have flagellated sperm that can swim. So this might be the correct answer.

Option H: They can photosynthesize at night. That's something like CAM plants, which include cacti and some succulents. They open their stomata at night to conserve water. But cycads aren't known for this, I think. They photosynthesize normally during the day.

Option I: They exhibit true secondary growth similar to woody trees. Secondary growth refers to the production of wood through the vascular cambium. I'm not sure about cycads. I think they have a more limited growth pattern, maybe not forming annual rings like trees. So this might not be it.

Option J: They are the only seed plants capable of asexual reproduction. I don't think that's right. Many plants can reproduce asexually, like through runners or offsets. So cycads wouldn't be unique in that.

So now, reviewing. The key point is that cycads are seed plants but have some primitive features. One unique thing I remember is that they're dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and their reproduction involves motile sperm. So when the pollen tube reaches the ovule, it releases sperm that swim to the egg. That's different from most other seed plants, which have non-motile sperm.

Looking back at the options, option G says they form motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes. So that's the unusual feature. Other seed plants, like conifers and flowering plants, don't have motile sperm; their sperm are delivered directly via the pollen tube without moving on their own. So cycads are unique in this aspect among seed plants.

I think that's the right answer. So the answer is G.

The question asks about the unusual feature of cycads that makes them remarkable among seed plants. Cycads are gymnosperms with several distinct characteristics, but the most notable one is their reproductive mechanism. Among seed plants, cycads are unique in that they produce motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes. This is a primitive feature reminiscent of more ancient plants like ferns, as most other seed plants, such as conifers and flowering plants, have non-motile sperm delivered directly via the pollen tube. This ability to form swimming sperm makes cycads stand out as a remarkable group.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **A**: Cycads do not have flowers that bloom for years before producing seeds.
- **B**: While cycads have unique, tough leaves, this is not their most unusual feature.
- **C**: Cycads are not known for surviving extreme cold.
- **D**: Though cycads produce relatively large seeds, this is not their most distinctive trait.
- **E**: There is no evidence that cycad seeds can remain dormant for up to a century.
- **F**: Cycads do not exhibit heliotropism or move their leaves toward the sun.
- **H**: Cycads do not photosynthesize at night like CAM plants.
- **I**: Cycads do not exhibit true secondary growth like woody trees.
- **J**: Cycads are not the only seed plants capable of asexual reproduction.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: They form motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes**.

Answer: G
