Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about when stranger anxiety begins in most children. I remember from my psychology class that stranger anxiety is a developmental milestone, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact age range. Let me think.

I think it's related to when babies start to show fear or wariness of strangers. I recall that infants go through different stages of development. Like, really young babies don't show much stranger anxiety, but as they get a bit older, around maybe six months or so, they start to feel uneasy around people they don't know. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember something about object permanence, which is when babies understand that objects continue to exist even when they're out of sight. That happens around 6 to 9 months. Maybe stranger anxiety is connected to that because the baby can now recognize familiar faces better and thus feels more anxious around strangers.

But I'm not totally sure. I also remember hearing that separation anxiety, which is similar but not exactly the same, starts around 9 months. So maybe stranger anxiety starts a bit earlier than that. 

Let me think of the options given. The options are A through J, each with different age ranges. The question is asking for when stranger anxiety begins for most children. 

Option C is 8 to 10 months. Option I is 7 to 9. Option J is 6 to 7. Option E is 3 to 5. Option A is 4 to 6. 

I think stranger anxiety starts around 6 to 9 months. So looking at the options, I is 7-9 and J is 6-7. So maybe it's around 6 months. But wait, another thought: I think stranger anxiety begins around 6 months, so J would be 6-7, which fits. But wait, sometimes sources say it's around 9 months. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember reading that stranger anxiety typically starts around 9 months, with some children showing it earlier. So maybe it's the 7 to 9 range. But I'm not certain. 

Wait, another approach: I think stranger anxiety is part of Erik Erikson's stages. He proposed that trust vs mistrust is the first stage, from birth to about 1 year. So maybe around 6 months, the infant starts to develop trust with familiar people and shows anxiety towards strangers. So that would align with 6 months.

Looking at the options, J is 6-7, and I is 7-9. So which is more accurate? I think the peak is around 9 months, but it can start earlier. So perhaps the correct answer is around 6-7 months as the beginning. 

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another angle: Jean Piaget's cognitive development stages. The sensorimotor stage is from 0-2 years. Sub-stages include object permanence around 6-12 months. Stranger anxiety might coincide with the beginning of object permanence, which is around 6 months. So that would point to J: 6-7 months.

Alternatively, some sources say that stranger anxiety starts as early as 6 months, peaks around 9 months, and diminishes by 12 months. So if the question is about when it begins, the answer would be 6-7 months, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I also remember that stranger anxiety sometimes is said to start around 9 months. Maybe I'm mixing it up with separation anxiety. Separation anxiety is when the child feels distress when separated from the primary caregiver, which can start around 9 months. Stranger anxiety is a bit different; it's about fear of strangers. So perhaps they occur around the same time.

Alternatively, I think stranger anxiety starts earlier, maybe around 6 months, and separation anxiety starts later. So the answer would be 6-7 months, which is option J.

Wait, but I need to make sure. Let me think about what I learned. In developmental psychology, stranger anxiety is a normal part of development, usually appearing around 6 to 9 months of age. So it starts at about 6 months, and continues through 9. So the beginning is 6 months, so the option that includes around 6 months would be J:6-7.

Alternatively, another possibility: the options might have 8-10 months as option C, but I think that might be when it's more pronounced, but the beginning is earlier.

So I think the correct answer is J: 6 to 7 months.

Stranger anxiety typically begins in children around 6 to 7 months of age. This developmental milestone is associated with the child's growing ability to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar faces, often coinciding with the development of object permanence. While stranger anxiety may peak around 9 months, it generally starts earlier, making the correct answer the range of 6 to 7 months.
