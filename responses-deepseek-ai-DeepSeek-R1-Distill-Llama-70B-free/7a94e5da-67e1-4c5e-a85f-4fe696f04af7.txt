Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about therapy types and the "miracle question." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which type of therapy uses the "miracle question" as an initial intervention. The options are A through J, each representing a different therapeutic approach.

First, I remember that the "miracle question" is something specific. I think it's used to help clients envision a positive future where their problems are solved. The question goes something like, "Imagine you woke up tomorrow, and a miracle happened. What would your life be like?" Or maybe, "What would you notice differently?" 

I'm trying to recall which therapy focuses on solutions rather than dwelling on the problem. Solution-focused therapy comes to mind. I remember that in solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT), the therapist helps the client identify what they want to achieve and then works towards those goals. They focus on the present and future rather than the past.

Wait, but I also need to make sure I'm not confusing this with other approaches. For example, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on changing thoughts and behaviors, but I'm not sure if they use the miracle question as an initial step. Psychodynamic therapy is more about unconscious feelings and past experiences. Family systems would look at family dynamics. REBT, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, is part of CBT and deals with irrational beliefs. 

So, putting it together: the miracle question is a tool used in the initial stages to set a positive direction for treatment. Solution-focused therapy is exactly about focusing on solutions and the future. So the correct answer should be option C: solution-focused.
