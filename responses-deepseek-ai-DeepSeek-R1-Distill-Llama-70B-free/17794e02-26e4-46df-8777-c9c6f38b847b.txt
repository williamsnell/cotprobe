Question:

The midterm scores for a statistics course were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. The final exam scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. One student had a score of 58 points on the midterm. If she had the same standardized score (z-score) on the final exam, what must her score have been?

Options:

A: 127 points
B: 58 points
C: 132 points
D: 102 points
E: 92 points
F: 122 points
G: 15 points
H: 118 points
I: 112 points
J: 142 points

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says that midterm scores are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 52 and a standard deviation of 4. The final exam scores are also normally distributed but with a mean of 112 and a standard deviation of 10. 

A student scored 58 on the midterm. The question is, if she had the same z-score on the final exam, what would her score have been? And then there are multiple choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that z-scores tell us how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean. The formula for z-score is (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

So, first, I think I need to calculate the z-score for the midterm. The student's midterm score is 58. The mean for the midterm is 52, and the standard deviation is 4.

Calculating that: z = (58 - 52) / 4. Let me compute that. 58 minus 52 is 6, divided by 4 gives 1.5. So her z-score is 1.5.

Now, this same z-score applies to the final exam. So I need to find out what score on the final would give a z-score of 1.5. The final's mean is 112, and the standard deviation is 10.

Using the same z-score formula, but this time solving for X, the final score. The formula can be rearranged as X = μ + (z * σ).

Plugging in the numbers: X = 112 + (1.5 * 10). Let's calculate that. 1.5 multiplied by 10 is 15. So 112 plus 15 is 127.

Looking at the options, option A is 127. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. Midterm z-score: (58-52)/4=6/4=1.5. Then final score X = 112 + (1.5)(10)=112+15=127. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the z-score for the student's midterm score. The z-score formula is:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

For the midterm:
- \(X = 58\) (the student's score),
- \(\mu = 52\) (mean of the midterm),
- \(\sigma = 4\) (standard deviation of the midterm).

\[
z = \frac{58 - 52}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5
\]

The student's z-score is 1.5. This same z-score applies to the final exam. To find the corresponding score on the final exam, we use the rearranged z-score formula:

\[
X = \mu + (z \cdot \sigma)
\]

For the final exam:
- \(\mu = 112\) (mean of the final exam),
- \(\sigma = 10\) (standard deviation of the final exam),
- \(z = 1.5\).

\[
X = 112 + (1.5 \cdot 10) = 112 + 15 = 127
\]

Thus, the student's score on the final exam would have been 127 points. The correct answer is:

A: 127 points
