Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the coefficient of x squared times y to the fifth power in the expansion of (x + 2y)^7. Hmm, I remember something about binomial expansions from algebra class. Let me think about how that works.

The binomial theorem says that (a + b)^n can be expanded into a sum where each term is of the form C(n, k) * a^(n-k) * b^k, right? Here, C(n, k) is the combination, which is n choose k. So in this case, a is x, b is 2y, and n is 7.

So the general term would be C(7, k) * x^(7 - k) * (2y)^k. But wait, I'm looking for the term where x is squared and y is to the fifth. So I need to find the value of k where x's exponent is 2 and y's is 5.

Let's see. The exponent of x in each term is (7 - k). I want that to be 2, so 7 - k = 2. Solving for k gives me k = 5. Oh wait, right! Because then the exponent on y would be 5, since (2y)^k would have y^k, and k is 5 here. So that's exactly the term I need.

So the coefficient would be C(7,5) multiplied by (2)^5. Let me calculate each part. 

First, C(7,5) is the same as 7 choose 5. I remember that 7 choose k is the same as 7 choose (7 - k), because of the symmetry in combinations. So 7 choose 5 is the same as 7 choose 2. Let me compute 7 choose 2. That's 7! / (2! * (7-2)!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) )= 21. Alternatively, 7 choose 5 is also 21.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. 7 choose 5 is 7!/(5! (7-5)! ) = 7!/(5! 2! ). Which is (7*6 *5! )/(5! * 2 *1) )= 7*6/(2) )= 42/2 =21. Yep, that's correct.

Next, (2)^5 is 2 multiplied five times. 2^5 is 32. So the coefficient is 21 * 32. Let me calculate that. 20 *32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so total is 672. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, wait, wait. The term is (2y)^5, so it's 2^5 times y^5. So when I multiply that by the combination, the coefficient for x squared y^5 is 21 * 32, which is indeed 672. So looking at the options, F is 672. So the correct answer should be F.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me go through the steps again. The term is (x)^{7 -k} (2y)^k. We want x^2, so 7 -k =2 â†’k=5. So the term is C(7,5) * x^2 * (2y)^5. The coefficient is C(7,5)*(2^5) =21*32=672. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is F.

To find the coefficient of \(x^2y^5\) in the expansion of \((x + 2y)^7\), we use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{k} \cdot a^{n-k} \cdot b^k
\]

Here, \(a = x\), \(b = 2y\), and \(n = 7\). The term we are interested in has \(x^2\) and \(y^5\), so we set the exponents accordingly:

\[
x^{7-k} = x^2 \implies 7 - k = 2 \implies k = 5
\]

For \(k = 5\), the term becomes:

\[
\binom{7}{5} \cdot x^2 \cdot (2y)^5
\]

The coefficient is:

\[
\binom{7}{5} \cdot 2^5
\]

First, calculate \(\binom{7}{5}\), which is equivalent to \(\binom{7}{2}\) due to the symmetry of combinations:

\[
\binom{7}{2} = \frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \frac{7 \cdot 6}{2 \cdot 1} = 21
\]

Next, calculate \(2^5\):

\[
2^5 = 32
\]

Now, multiply these results to find the coefficient:

\[
21 \cdot 32 = 672
\]

Thus, the coefficient of \(x^2y^5\) is 672. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 672**
