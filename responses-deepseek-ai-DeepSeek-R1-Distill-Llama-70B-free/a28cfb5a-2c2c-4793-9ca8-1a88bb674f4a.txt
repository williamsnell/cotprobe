Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the annual interest rate Ms. Chen paid for her used car. Let's see, she bought a car worth $1650. She paid $50 down and then $1840 in monthly installments over two years. Hmm, I need to find the interest rate she's paying annually.

Wait, so the total she's paying in installments is $1840 each month for 24 months, right? Let me calculate the total amount she paid in installments. 1840 multiplied by 24... Let me do that math. 1840 * 24, maybe break it down: 1840 * 20 is 36,800, and 1840 *4 is 7,360, so total is 36,800 +7,360 = 44,160. So she paid $44,160 in installments.

But she also paid a $50 down payment. So the total amount she paid is 44,160 +50 = 44,210. Oh wait, but the car was worth $1650. So she's paying way more than that. The extra must be the interest.

Wait, wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says the car is worth $1650, but she paid $50 down and then $1840 in monthly installments over two years. Wait, that doesn't make sense because $1840 a month for 24 months is way more than the car's value. Hmm, maybe I read that wrong. Let me read again.

Ah, maybe the total installment payments are $1840 over two years. So that would be 24 months, so each month she's paying 1840/24. Let me calculate that. 1840 divided by 24 is approximately 76.666... so about $76.67 per month. Oh, I see, I misread the problem. It's not $1840 per month, but $1840 total in monthly payments over two years. That makes more sense.

So the total amount paid is the down payment plus the installments. The down payment is $50, and the installments are $1,840. So total paid is 50 + 1840 = 1890. Wait, but the car's price is $1650, so she paid $1890 for a $1650 car. The difference is the interest: 1890 -1650 = 240. So she paid $240 in interest over two years.

Wait, but how do I calculate the annual interest rate from that. Hmm, I think I can model this as a simple interest problem, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an installment loan, so each payment includes principal and interest.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think about it. The total amount she needs to finance is the price minus the down payment. So the loan amount is 1650 -50 = 1600. She's paying this off over 24 months with monthly payments. Each payment is 1840 divided by 24, which is 76.666... So each month, she's paying about $76.67.

Wait, but that seems low. Let me check: 76.67 *24 = 1840.04, which matches the $1840 total in installments.

So she's paying $76.67 per month for 24 months. Now, to find the interest rate, I think I can use the present value of an annuity formula. The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) on an installment loan is:

PMT = (P * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where:
P = principal loan amount (1600)
r = monthly interest rate
n = number of payments (24)

We need to find r, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.

So we have PMT = 76.6667, P=1600, n=24.

Plugging in:
76.6667 = (1600 * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-24 )

This equation needs to be solved for r. Hmm, solving for r might require trial and error or using a financial calculator. Alternatively, I can use an approximate method or use the rule of 78 or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the simple interest formula. But wait, in simple interest, the total interest is principal * rate * time. But that's only for simple interest without compounding, and in this case, the payments are being made over time, so it's probably not simple interest.

Wait, but let me try the simple interest approach. The total interest paid is $240 over two years. So the rate would be (240)/(1600) over 2 years. So 240 / 1600 = 0.15, which is 15% over two years. So annual rate would be 7.5%, but that's not one of the options. So that's probably not correct because the payments are being made monthly, so it's not simple interest.

So I need to go back to the annuity formula. Let me rearrange the equation:

PMT = (P * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

So:

76.6667 = (1600 * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-24 )

Let me denote (1 + r)^24 as (1 + r)^n. So 1/(1 - (1/(1+r)^24)).

Hmm, solving for r is tricky without a calculator, but maybe I can estimate.

Let's try to approximate. Let's guess a rate and see if it works.

Let me try 14% annual rate. Then monthly r is 14% /12 = 0.0116667.

So compute denominator: 1 - (1/(1.0116667)^24 )

Calculate (1.0116667)^24. Let's approximate. Let me compute ln(1.0116667) = approx 0.01155. Multiply by 24: 0.2772. Exponentiate: e^0.2772 ≈ 1.319. So (1.0116667)^24 ≈ 1.319.

So denominator is 1 - 1/1.319 ≈ 1 - 0.758 ≈ 0.242.

So numerator is 1600 * 0.0116667 ≈ 18.6667.

So PMT ≈18.6667 / 0.242 ≈ 77.12.

But the actual PMT is about 76.67, which is a bit lower. So at 14%, the PMT is 77.12, which is higher than 76.67. So the actual rate is a bit lower than 14% annually.

Wait, but 14% is option J. Let me try a lower rate, say 13%.

r = 13%/12 ≈ 0.0108333.

Compute denominator: 1 - 1/(1.0108333)^24.

Let me compute (1.0108333)^24.

Compute ln(1.0108333)≈0.01079. Multiply by 24: 0.259. e^0.259≈1.296.

Denominator is 1 - 1/1.296 ≈ 1 - 0.772 ≈ 0.228.

Numerator:1600 * 0.0108333≈17.333.

So PMT ≈17.333 / 0.228 ≈75.97.

Hmm, the actual PMT is 76.67, which is higher than 75.97. So at 13%, the PMT is about 75.97, which is lower than 76.67. So the rate should be between 13% and 14%.

Wait, because when the rate is 13%, the PMT is lower than 76.67, and at 14%, it's higher. So the actual rate is between 13% and 14%.

Let me try 13.5%. So r=0.01125.

Compute (1.01125)^24.

ln(1.01125)=0.01118. 24*0.01118=0.2683. e^0.2683≈1.3078.

Denominator:1 -1/1.3078≈1-0.765≈0.235.

Numerator:1600 *0.01125=18.

PMT=18/0.235≈76.60.

That's very close to the actual PMT of 76.67. So the rate is approximately 13.5% annually.

Looking back at the options, option J is 14.4%, option D is 13.3%, option I is 12%, etc. Wait, but 13.5% isn't an option. Hmm, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me try 13.3% annual rate, which is option D. So r=13.3/12=0.0110833.

Compute (1.0110833)^24.

ln(1.0110833)= approx 0.011. 24 *0.011=0.264.

e^0.264≈1.301.

Denominator:1 -1/1.301≈1 -0.768=0.232.

Numerator:1600 *0.0110833≈17.733.

PMT=17.733 /0.232≈76.45.

The actual PMT is 76.67, so this is a bit lower. So the rate is a bit higher than 13.3%. Let's try 13.5% again, which gave PMT≈76.60, very close to 76.67.

Wait, but 13.5 isn't an option. The closest option is J:14.4%, but that's higher than our estimate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula is:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

We have PV=1600, PMT=76.6667, n=24.

We can rearrange this to solve for r.

But without a financial calculator, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 78 or another method, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the interest is calculated using the simple interest method on the initial principal, but with each payment reducing the principal. Let me think: each payment includes interest on the remaining principal plus some principal.

So for the first month, the interest would be 1600 * r, and the principal paid would be 76.6667 - (1600 * r). Then the next month's interest is on the reduced principal, and so on.

But calculating this manually for 24 periods would take a lot of time. Maybe I can use an approximate formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the N-ratio method or another approximation.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use an iterative approach. Let me try a few more rates.

Let's try 14% annual rate again. We saw that the PMT was approximately 77.12, which is higher than 76.67. So let's try 13.8%: r=0.0115.

Compute (1.0115)^24: ln(1.0115)=0.01146, 24 *0.01146=0.275, e^0.275≈1.316.

Denominator:1 -1/1.316≈1-0.760=0.240.

Numerator:1600 *0.0115=18.4.

PMT=18.4 /0.240≈76.67.

Oh wait, that's exactly the PMT we have. So at 13.8% annual rate, the PMT is approximately 76.67, which matches.

But looking at the options, the closest is option J:14.4%, option D:13.3%, option H:16%, etc. Wait, 13.8 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the 14% case.

At 14% annual rate, r=0.0116667.

Compute (1.0116667)^24: using more accurate calculation.

Let me compute 1.0116667^24 step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation. The exact value can be calculated as e^(24 * ln(1.0116667)).

ln(1.0116667)= approximately 0.011545.

24 * 0.011545=0.27708.

e^0.27708≈1.319.

So (1.0116667)^24≈1.319.

Denominator:1 - 1/1.319≈0.242.

Numerator:1600 *0.0116667≈18.6667.

PMT=18.6667 /0.242≈77.12.

Hmm, that's higher than 76.67.

Wait, earlier when I tried 13.8% (r=0.0115), I got PMT≈76.67.

So the correct rate is approximately 13.8%. But looking at the options, I don't see 13.8%. The options are:

A:10%, B:17.5%, C:15.2%, D:13.3%, E:20%, F:19.8%, G:18%, H:16%, I:12%, J:14.4%.

So the options are D:13.3%, J:14.4%. So 13.8 is not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me recheck the numbers.

The problem says she paid $50 down and $1840 in monthly installments over two years. So the total installments are 24 months, each of 1840 /24 =76.6667.

The principal is 1650 -50=1600.

So yes, the setup is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interest is calculated on the initial principal with simple interest, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated as (total paid - price) / (price) * (1/time). But that's not accurate because the time factor isn't properly considered.

Wait, the total paid is 50 + 1840 =1890. The car's price is 1650. So total interest is 1890 -1650=240.

If this was a simple interest loan over two years, the rate would be (240)/(1600) / 2= 0.075 or 7.5% annually. But that's not one of the options, and it's too low.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated using the average balance method. The average balance would be (1600 +0)/2=800. So interest is 240, over two years on 800 average balance.

So rate would be (240)/(800) /2= 0.15 or 15% annually. That's option C:15.2% is close, but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate it using the rule of 78 or another method, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the APR formula. The APR can be calculated using the formula:

APR = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n +1))

Where n is the number of payments, I is the total interest.

Wait, n=24, I=240, P=1600.

So APR=(2*24*240)/(1600*(24+1)).

Compute numerator: 2*24=48, 48*240=11520.

Denominator:1600*25=40,000.

APR=11520 /40000=0.288, which is 28.8%. That's way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe that formula isn't applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the formula.

Another approach: the effective annual rate can be calculated by finding the monthly rate and then compounding it.

Earlier, I found that the monthly rate is approximately 0.0115 (1.15%), which gives an annual rate of about 13.8%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J:14.4%, but that's a bit higher than our estimate.

Wait, maybe I should try option J:14.4% annual rate. Let's compute.

r=14.4%/12=0.012.

Compute (1.012)^24.

Let me compute ln(1.012)=0.0119. Multiply by 24: 0.2856. e^0.2856≈1.331.

Denominator:1 -1/1.331≈1 -0.751≈0.249.

Numerator:1600 *0.012=19.2.

PMT=19.2 /0.249≈77.11.

But the actual PMT is 76.67, which is lower. So 14.4% gives a higher PMT than needed. So the actual rate is a bit lower than 14.4%.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D:13.3%.

Wait, when I tried 13.3% earlier, the PMT was approximately 76.45, which is close to 76.67. Let me see the exact calculation.

r=13.3%/12=0.0110833.

Compute (1.0110833)^24.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

1.0110833^24.

Let me compute step by step:

1.0110833^2 = approx 1.022276.

^4= (1.022276)^2≈1.0451.

^8≈(1.0451)^2≈1.0923.

^16≈(1.0923)^2≈1.1923.

Now, to get to 24, we have 16 +8=24.

So 1.1923 *1.0923≈1.1923*1.0923.

1.1923 *1=1.1923.

1.1923 *0.0923≈0.1101.

Total≈1.1923+0.1101=1.3024.

So (1.0110833)^24≈1.3024.

Denominator:1 -1/1.3024≈1 -0.7677≈0.2323.

Numerator:1600 *0.0110833≈17.733.

PMT=17.733 /0.2323≈76.37.

That's close to 76.67, but still a bit lower.

The difference is about 0.3. So perhaps the exact rate is a bit higher than 13.3%.

Alternatively, maybe the
