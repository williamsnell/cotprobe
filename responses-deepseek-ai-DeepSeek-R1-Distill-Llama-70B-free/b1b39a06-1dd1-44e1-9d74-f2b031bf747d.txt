Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. Hmm, I remember that parametric tests have certain assumptions, like normal distribution, and are generally more powerful. Nonparametric tests don't require such assumptions and are used when data isn't normally distributed or when the data is ordinal/rank.

The question is asking which statement about parametric tests is incorrect. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: They are more robust and flexible. Wait, I thought parametric tests are less robust because they rely on assumptions like normality. Nonparametric tests are more robust since they don't rely on distribution assumptions. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: Based on homogeneity of variance. Parametric tests often assume that variances are equal across groups, like in ANOVA. So B is correct.

Option C: Used for ordinal and nominal data. No, wait. Parametric tests are usually for interval/ratio data. Nonparametric tests are for ordinal or nominal. So C might be incorrect.

Option D: Less sensitive to outliers. Parametric tests can be affected by outliers because they're based on means. Nonparametric tests, which use ranks, are less affected. So D is correct because parametric are more sensitive, so D would be incorrect if it says "less sensitive". Wait, the option says parametric tests are less sensitive, which would be incorrect. Because they are actually more sensitive. Hmm, so D is an incorrect statement about parametric tests.

Option E: Do not assume underlying distribution. No, parametric tests do assume a distribution, like normal. So E is incorrect if it's a statement about parametric tests. Because the question is which statement is NOT correct about parametric tests. So E would be incorrect.

Option F: Based on independence of observations. Yes, parametric tests require that observations are independent. So F is correct.

Option G: Based on normal distribution. Yes, many parametric tests assume normality, like t-tests. So G is correct.

Option H: Can be used when data isn't normally distributed. No, parametric tests require normality, so H is incorrect. But wait, sometimes transformations can help, but generally, if data isn't normal, you shouldn't use parametric. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Used when sample size is small. Wait, no, parametric tests often require larger sample sizes to meet assumptions. Nonparametric might be used for small samples. Or wait, sometimes small samples with normality can use parametric. But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think more.

Wait, let's go back. The question asks which statement is NOT correct about parametric tests.

So looking again:

Option A: Parametric are more robust? No, nonparametric are more robust. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Parametric used for ordinal/nominal? No, that's nonparametric. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Parametric less sensitive to outliers. No, they are more sensitive. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Parametric do not assume distribution? No, they do. So E is incorrect.

Option H: Parametric can be used when data isn't normal. No, they shouldn't. So H is incorrect.

So the question is which of these is NOT correct about parametric.

So the incorrect statements about parametric would be options A, C, D, E, H, and possibly I.

Wait, let me think about each option.

A: They are more robust and flexible. Parametric tests are less flexible because they have more assumptions. So A is incorrect.

B: Homogeneity of variance. Parametric tests like ANOVA do assume homogeneity. So B is correct.

C: Parametric used for ordinal/nominal? No, they are used for interval/ratio data. So C is incorrect.

D: Less sensitive to outliers. Parametric tests are more sensitive because they rely on the mean. So D is incorrect.

E: Do not assume underlying distribution. No, they do assume (like normal). So E is incorrect.

F: Independence. Yes, correct.

G: Normal distribution. Correct.

H: Used when data not normal. Incorrect.

I: Used when sample size small. Hmm, not necessarily. For small samples, if data is not normal, nonparametric is preferred. But if data is normal, parametric can be used even with small samples. So I is a possibility but not a strong incorrect.

Now, the question is which statement cannot be correct. So which one is definitely wrong about parametric tests.

Looking at the options, the question is which is NOT correct. So the incorrect statements about parametric tests (i.e., something that's false about them) would be the correct answer.

So for each option:

A is incorrect because parametric are not more robust.

C is incorrect because parametric are for interval, not ordinal/nominal.

D is incorrect because parametric are more sensitive.

E is incorrect because parametric do assume distribution.

H is incorrect because parametric shouldn't be used when data isn't normal.

I: Not sure, but I think small samples can use parametric if assumptions are met, but often it's harder, so I might not be incorrect.

So the question is which option is not correct about parametric.

The question is, which statement cannot be correct, i.e., is incorrect about parametric tests.

Looking at the options, E says parametric do not assume underlying distribution. That's wrong, parametric tests do assume.

So E is incorrect.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The question is asking which statement can NOT be correct, i.e., which is incorrect about parametric tests.

So the correct answer would be the statement that is false about parametric tests.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Parametric are more robust. No, they're less robust. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Used for ordinal/nominal. No, incorrect.

Option D: Less sensitive to outliers. No, incorrect.

Option E: Do not assume distribution. No, incorrect.

Option H: Can be used when data not normal. No, incorrect.

So the question is which of these is a false statement about parametric tests.

The question is, which statement can not be correct? So any of these would be the answer.

But wait, the options are about what is NOT correct. So the question is, which statement cannot be correct about parametric tests.

So the correct answer to the question is the option that is false.

I think option E is incorrect because parametric tests do assume an underlying distribution.

Option H is incorrect because parametric shouldn't be used when data isn't normal.

Option C is incorrect as parametric are for higher level data.

Option D is incorrect because parametric are more sensitive to outliers.

Option A is incorrect because they're less robust.

So the question is which of these is NOT correct about parametric.

So the possible incorrect statements are A, C, D, E, H.

But the options are from A to I, and the question is which is not correct.

Wait, the options are A to J, but the given options are A to I.

Looking again, the options are A to I, as per the question.

So, the incorrect statements about parametric tests are A, C, D, E, H.

The question is which of the options is NOT correct (i.e., which is false about parametric tests).

So the correct answer is the one that is false.

Looking again, the question is phrased: which statement can NOT be correct. So which is false about parametric tests.

Now, the options:

- E: They do not assume an underlying population distribution.

Parametric tests do assume a distribution (like normal), so E is incorrect.

So the answer would be E.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Option E: Do not assume underlying distribution. So that's incorrect because parametric tests do assume.

So the statement in E is incorrect, so E is the answer.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option H: They can be used when data is not normally distributed.

Parametric tests are typically not used when data isn't normal. So H is incorrect.

So the question is, which of these options is an incorrect statement about parametric tests.

So the correct answer is either E or H.

Wait, but the question is about which statement CANNOT be correct, i.e., which is false.

So both E and H are incorrect statements about parametric tests.

So how do I choose between them?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the question is phrased: 'which statement can not be correct'.

So all options are statements about parametric tests, and the incorrect statement is the one that is false.

So E says parametric tests do not assume underlying distribution. That's false, so E is incorrect.

H says parametric can be used when data isn't normally distributed. That's also incorrect.

So which one is the answer? Because the question gives only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial part of the question.

The question says: Nonparametric tests are less powerful. From your knowledge about parametric tests, which statement can not be correct?

So the question is, which statement about parametric tests is incorrect.

So looking back, E and H are incorrect. But the options may have more than one incorrect, but the question expects one.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I missed something.

Let me think: Parametric tests require data to be from a known distribution, usually normal.

So E is incorrect because they do assume.

H is incorrect because parametric can't be used when data isn't normal.

So which one is the answer.

Wait, the options are:

E: They do not assume an underlying population distribution.

Parametric tests do assume, so E is incorrect.

H: They can be used when data is not normally distributed. No, they shouldn't, so H is incorrect.

So both E and H are incorrect statements about parametric tests.

But the options are from A to I, so perhaps I should re-examine the other options.

Option C: They are used for ordinal and nominal data.

Parametric tests are not used for ordinal/nominal. So C is incorrect.

So then, which of these is the answer.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is NOT correct about parametric tests.

So all of E, H, C, etc., are incorrect.

Wait, but the options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, because parametric tests do assume a distribution, so E is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, the options are:

A: They are more robust and flexible. → Incorrect, parametric are less robust.

B: Homogeneity of variance → Correct.

C: Used for ordinal/nominal → Incorrect.

D: Less sensitive to outliers → Incorrect.

E: Do not assume underlying → Incorrect.

F: Independence → Correct.

G: Normal distribution → Correct.

H: Used when data not normal → Incorrect.

I: Used when sample size small → Not necessarily incorrect. For example, t-test with small sample but normal data.

So the options with incorrect statements are A, C, D, E, H.

But the question is which statement cannot be correct, so which is not a correct fact about parametric tests.

So the correct answer is any of these, but in the options, the letters are A to I.

Wait, the options are:

A: They are more robust and flexible → Incorrect.

B: Based on homogeneity → Correct.

C: Used for ordinal → Incorrect.

D: Less sensitive → Incorrect.

E: Do not assume → Incorrect.

F: Independence → Correct.

G: Normal → Correct.

H: Used when not normal → Incorrect.

I: Small sample → Maybe correct if data is normal.

So the possible incorrect statements are A, C, D, E, H.

The question is which one is not correct about parametric tests.

So the correct answer should be one of these.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options given in the question.

The options are from A to I, and the correct answer is one of them.

The question is phrased as: 'which statement can not be correct?'

So the incorrect statement about parametric tests is the answer.

Looking again, option E says parametric tests do not assume underlying distribution. That's wrong, so E is incorrect.

Option H says they can be used when data isn't normally distributed. That's also wrong.

So both E and H are incorrect. But the question asks for which statement can not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is E because it's about distribution assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, I think I need to find which of these is not a correct statement about parametric.

So the correct answer is E and H. But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each test assumes.

Parametric tests assume normality, so H is incorrect.

Parametric tests do assume a distribution, so E is incorrect.

So both E and H are incorrect, but the question only allows one answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in another option.

Wait, option C: They are used for ordinal and nominal data.

Parametric tests are not used for ordinal/nominal, so C is incorrect.

So C is incorrect as well.

So the options that are incorrect are A, C, D, E, H.

But the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H.

I'm a bit confused, but I think E is more directly incorrect because it's about the distribution assumption.

So the correct answer would be option E.
</think>

To determine which statement about parametric tests is incorrect, let us analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "They are more robust and flexible." This is incorrect because parametric tests are less robust and flexible due to their reliance on assumptions like normality and homogeneity of variance. Nonparametric tests are more robust.

- **Option B**: "They are based on homogeneity of variance." This is correct. Many parametric tests, such as ANOVA, assume homogeneity of variance across groups.

- **Option C**: "They are used for ordinal and nominal data." This is incorrect. Parametric tests are typically used for interval or ratio data, while nonparametric tests are used for ordinal or nominal data.

- **Option D**: "They are less sensitive to outliers." This is incorrect. Parametric tests, which rely on means, are more sensitive to outliers compared to nonparametric tests, which often rely on ranks.

- **Option E**: "They do not assume an underlying population distribution." This is incorrect. Parametric tests do assume an underlying distribution, such as normality.

- **Option F**: "They are based on independence of observations." This is correct. Parametric tests require independence of observations.

- **Option G**: "They are based on normal distribution." This is correct. Many parametric tests, such as t-tests, assume normality.

- **Option H**: "They can be used when data is not normally distributed." This is incorrect. Parametric tests are not appropriate when data is not normally distributed unless transformations or other adjustments are made.

- **Option I**: "They are used when the sample size is small." This is not necessarily incorrect. Parametric tests can be used with small sample sizes if assumptions like normality are met.

The question asks for the statement that "can not be correct," meaning the statement that is false about parametric tests. While multiple options (A, C, D, E, H) are incorrect, **Option E** is the most directly incorrect because it explicitly contradicts the fundamental assumption of parametric tests regarding an underlying population distribution.
