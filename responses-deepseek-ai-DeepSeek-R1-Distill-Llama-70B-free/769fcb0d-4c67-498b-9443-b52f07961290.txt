Okay, so I have this question here asking me to calculate the number of liters in one cubic meter. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my unit conversions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that cubic meters is a unit of volume, and liters is another volume unit. I think they're related, but I'm not exactly sure of the exact conversion factor. Wait, I think I learned somewhere that 1 liter is equal to 1 cubic decimeter. Oh right, because a liter is defined as the volume of a cube with sides of 10 centimeters, which is a decimeter. So 1 liter = 1 dm³.

Now, I need to relate cubic meters to cubic decimeters. Let me think about the metric system. I know that 1 meter is 10 decimeters because 'deci-' means ten. So 1 m = 10 dm. But since we're dealing with cubic meters, it's (10 dm)^3, which is 1000 cubic decimeters. So 1 m³ = 1000 dm³.

Since 1 dm³ is 1 liter, that means 1 m³ is 1000 liters. Oh wait, so that makes sense. So one cubic meter equals 1000 liters. 

Looking at the options, option E is 1,000 liters. That should be the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: 1,000 liters.
