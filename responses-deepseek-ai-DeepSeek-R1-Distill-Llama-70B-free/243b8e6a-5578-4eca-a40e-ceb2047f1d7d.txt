Okay, so I've got this question about decision making in highly ambiguous environments according to March 1988. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options isn't part of the key streams he identified. Let me think. 

From what I remember, March talked about the garbage can model, right? That model describes how decisions are made in organizations where there's a lot of ambiguity. In that model, there are several streams that come together in a kind of chaotic way. The main streams I remember are problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities. Oh wait, and maybe something about expectations too? Or was that part of another theory?

Wait, the question is asking which one does NOT form part of March's key streams. The options are A through J. Let me list the options again: Innovations, Goals, Outcomes, Choice opportunities, Problems, Expectations, Uncertainties, Solutions, Risks, Constraints.

So, March's streams are problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities. Wait, participants are people who come and go, affecting decisions. But looking at the options, I don't see participants listed here. So, maybe the answer relates to that. 

Wait, the options include 'Choice opportunities' as option D. So that's one of March's streams. 'Problems' is E, which is another stream. 'Solutions' is H, another stream. So those are part of it. What about the others?

Innovations (A) - I'm not sure if March specifically mentions innovations as a stream. Maybe it's related to solutions? Or perhaps it's a different concept. 

Goals (B) - I think goals might be part of another model, like the rational model where goals are clear, but in March's ambiguous model, goals might not be a primary stream. Or wait, in the garbage can model, do they talk about goals? Not sure. 

Outcomes (C) - Outcome is a result, so maybe not a stream but a result of the process. March's model is more about the inputs or elements that flow into the decision process.

Expectations (F) - I'm not certain. March does talk about how expectations influence decisions, especially in ambiguous situations where people might rely on their expectations. So maybe that's part of it.

Uncertainties (G) - Ambiguity implies uncertainty, so perhaps that's a key aspect. But is it a separate stream or just a characteristic of the environment?

Risks (I) - Risk is a factor in decisions, but I don't remember it being a specific stream in March's model.

Constraints (J) - Constraints could be part of the context, but again, not sure if it's a named stream.

Wait, the question is about the streams. March's four streams are problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities. So from the options, problems (E), solutions (H), and choice opportunities (D) are included. So the answer must be one of the other options.

The options not in March's streams would be Innovations, Goals, Outcomes, Expectations, Uncertainties, Risks, Constraints.

Wait, the options are A through J. The question is which does NOT form part of March's streams.

So, looking at the options, the ones that are not streams are Innovations (A), Goals (B), Outcomes (C), Expectations (F), Uncertainties (G), Risks (I), Constraints (J).

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether Expectations are part of it. I think March's model doesn't include Expectations as a separate stream. Because the four streams are Problems, Solutions, Participants, and Choice Opportunities. So the rest are not part of the key streams.

So the question is which of the options is NOT part of these streams. The options given are A to J, including all except Participants.

Wait, but the question says "key streams identified by March". So if the key streams are four: Problems, Solutions, Participants, Choice Opportunities.

Looking at the options, the ones that match are E (Problems), H (Solutions), D (Choice opportunities). Participants aren't in the options.

So the other options (A, B, C, F, G, I, J) are not part of March's streams.

The question is which one does not form part. So the correct answer would be one of these.

Wait the question is phrased as which does NOT form part. So the correct answer is the option that is not one of the four streams.

Looking at the options, the four streams are E, H, D, and Participants (which isn't an option here).

So the other options are not part of the streams. So for example, the question is asking which is NOT a stream. So the options A, B, C, F, G, I, J are all not streams.

But the question gives multiple options, and we have to pick one.

Wait, the options are A to J, each is a possible answer. So the question is which option is NOT part of the streams. So which of these is not a stream.

So perhaps the answer is B: Goals, because Goals are more part of a rational decision-making model, not the garbage can model where ambiguity is high.

Alternatively, maybe Innovations (A) isn't a stream. Or Outcomes (C) isn't a stream.

Wait, I think the key is that the four streams are Problems, Solutions, Participants, and Choice Opportunities. So any option not matching these would be correct.

Looking at the options:

A: Innovations - Not a stream.

B: Goals - Not a stream.

C: Outcomes - Not a stream.

E: Problems - Stream.

F: Expectations - Not a stream.

G: Uncertainties - Not a stream.

H: Solutions - Stream.

I: Risks - Not a stream.

J: Constraints - Not a stream.

So, the options that are streams are D, E, H.

The options that are not streams are A, B, C, F, G, I, J.

So the question is which one does NOT form part of the streams, so any of these would be correct. But the question provides a single answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the four streams, so the correct answer would be an option that is not one of the four.

Wait, the options given are from A to J, and the question is which does not form part.

So the correct answer is the one that is not a stream. So the answer is B: Goals.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps 'Innovations' is not a stream.

Wait, another approach: March's model includes four streams: problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities. So from the options, the ones that match are D (choice opportunities), E (problems), H (solutions). The others are not. So the correct answer is any of the other options.

So the question is which one is NOT part of the streams, so the answer is one of A, B, C, F, G, I, J.

Looking back at the question, the options are:

A: Innovations

B: Goals

C: Outcomes

D: Choice opportunities

E: Problems

F: Expectations

G: Uncertainties

H: Solutions

I: Risks

J: Constraints

So the answer must be one of these. Since the question asks for the one that does not form part, perhaps the correct answer is B: Goals, because Goals are not one of the four streams. Or maybe it's Innovations, but I think Goals are more likely not a stream in March's model.

Wait, March's model is about how decisions happen in ambiguous situations, where goals may not be clear. So the streams are more about problems, solutions, etc., rather than goals.

So the answer should be B: Goals.
</think>

March (1988) identified four key streams in decision making in highly ambiguous environments: problems, solutions, participants, and choice opportunities. These streams are central to the garbage can model, which describes how decisions emerge in chaotic and ambiguous contexts. 

Analyzing the options provided:

- **A: Innovations** - Not explicitly identified as one of March's key streams.
- **B: Goals** - Goals are more associated with rational decision-making models and are not part of March's four key streams.
- **C: Outcomes** - Outcomes are results of decisions, not part of the streams that shape the decision process.
- **D: Choice opportunities** - This is one of the four key streams identified by March.
- **E: Problems** - This is one of the four key streams identified by March.
- **F: Expectations** - Not explicitly identified as one of March's key streams.
- **G: Uncertainties** - While ambiguity implies uncertainty, it is not explicitly listed as a separate stream.
- **H: Solutions** - This is one of the four key streams identified by March.
- **I: Risks** - Not explicitly identified as one of March's key streams.
- **J: Constraints** - Constraints are part of the context but not explicitly listed as a stream.

From this analysis, **B: Goals** stands out as the option that does not form part of March's key streams, as goals are more relevant to rational decision-making models rather than the garbage can model.

Answer: B
