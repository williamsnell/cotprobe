Question:

Dari Inc. guaranteed the debt of a related party. In December Dari learned that it is probable it will be required to pay between $150000 and $200000 within the next six months in satisfaction of its guarantee but no amount within that range is more likely. What amount of contingent liability should Dari accrue in its December 31 balance sheet?

A: $170,000
B: $225,000

F: $250,000
G: $100,000
H: $175,000
I: $150,000

Okay, so I've got this accounting question here about contingent liabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about Dari Inc. guaranteeing the debt of a related party. In December, they learned that it's probable they'll have to pay between $150,000 and $200,000 within the next six months. But no amount in that range is more likely than another. They’re asking what amount of contingent liability Dari should accrue in their December 31 balance sheet.

Alright, I remember that contingent liabilities are recorded based on certain conditions. Let me think. Oh right, the four criteria for accrual are:

1. The liability must be probable (likely to occur).
2. The amount can be reasonably estimated.
3. The liability is based on a past event.
4. Payment is expected to be made.

So in this case, the first condition is met because it's probable they'll have to pay. The past event would be the guarantee they provided, so condition three is satisfied. They expect to pay, so condition four is also met. So that leaves the second condition—can the amount be reasonably estimated?

The question says they learned that it's probable they'll have to pay between $150k and $200k, but no amount within that range is more likely. So the range is from 150 to 200, with all amounts equally possible.

Wait, I think the accounting rules say that if the amount can't be estimated precisely, but a range is known, then you accrue the best estimate. But if all amounts are equally likely, then the best estimate is the midpoint. Wait no, wait. Actually, no—wait, in some cases, you have to look for the minimum, or perhaps the maximum.

Wait, no, let me think again. So, ASC 450 (or IAS 37) deals with provisions and contingent liabilities. For a contingent liability, if it's probable and can be estimated, you accrue it. If it's probable but the amount isn't known, you have to make the best estimate. So if it's a range, you take the best estimate within that range. But when no particular amount is more likely, you take the minimum amount in the range.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because if you have a range where any value is possible, and all are equally likely, the midpoint would be the average expected value. But I'm getting confused here.

Wait, I remember an example where when a company is involved in a lawsuit and the loss is probable but the exact amount isn't known. Suppose the loss is estimated to be between $100,000 and $200,000, with all amounts within the range equally likely. Then, the company would accrue the midpoint, which would be $150,000. Because that's the best estimate when all possibilities are equally likely.

But wait, another thought—what if it's impossible to determine the exact amount, but the minimum is known. Oh no, I think I might be mixing up different scenarios.

Wait, no, the correct approach is: when you have a range of possible outcomes, and all are equally likely, you take the midpoint as the best estimate. So in this case, the range is $150k to $200k. The midpoint would be ($150k + $200k)/2 = $175k. So the company should accrue $175,000.

But wait, wait another moment. Let me check the exact accounting rule. Under US GAAP, ASC 450-20-30-1 states that when a range of possible loss exists and some amount within the range is probable, the best estimate is the amount that the entity believes is the most likely. If all amounts are possible, the best estimate is the midpoint.

Wait, no, wait, let me think again. So, if the loss is probable and can be estimated, then the company must accrue the best estimate. If the best estimate is a range, then the company should use the best estimate within that range. But if all amounts are equally possible, then the best estimate is the average, which would be the midpoint.

So in this case, the range is $150k to $200k, midpoint is $175k. So the answer would be H: $175,000.

Wait, but I've heard that sometimes, for contingent liabilities, if the minimum is known, that's what's accrued. Or is that when it's a possible liability, not probable?

Wait, no. For contingent liabilities, it's probable, so you accrue the best estimate. If the best estimate is the midpoint, then that's what is used.

So in this question, the correct answer should be $175,000. Looking at the options, option H is $175,000.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. I remember that when a range is given and all amounts are equally likely, the midpoint is the best estimate. But if the minimum is the best estimate, that's different. For example, if the company will definitely pay at least $150k, but maybe up to $200k. Then, the best estimate would be $150k if the minimum is certain, but that's not the case here. Here, it's a flat range with no more likelihood on any point.

So yes, the midpoint is correct.

To determine the amount of contingent liability Dari Inc. should accrue, we analyze the situation under the accounting rules for contingent liabilities. A contingent liability is recognized if the loss is probable, the amount can be reasonably estimated, it is based on a past event, and payment is expected to be made. In this case, all four conditions are satisfied:

1. The loss is probable, as Dari learned it is likely they will have to pay.
2. The amount can be reasonably estimated within a range of $150,000 to $200,000.
3. The liability is based on the past event of guaranteeing the debt.
4. Payment is expected to be made within the next six months.

When no specific amount within the range is more likely, the best estimate is the midpoint of the range. The midpoint of $150,000 and $200,000 is calculated as:

\[
\frac{150,000 + 200,000}{2} = 175,000
\]

Thus, Dari Inc. should accrue $175,000 as the contingent liability in its December 31 balance sheet.
