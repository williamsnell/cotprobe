Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a function f(x, y) = x³ + y³ + 3xy. The question is about whether there are distinct points P and Q where f has certain features like local maxima, minima, or saddle points. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that to find extrema or saddle points for functions of two variables, I need to find the critical points first. Critical points occur where both partial derivatives are zero. So I'll start by computing the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y.

The function is f(x, y) = x³ + y³ + 3xy. Let's compute the partial derivatives. The partial derivative with respect to x is df/dx = 3x² + 3y. Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y is df/dy = 3y² + 3x.

So to find the critical points, I set both these partial derivatives equal to zero.

So the equations are:

3x² + 3y = 0 → x² + y = 0 → y = -x².

And,

3y² + 3x = 0 → y² + x = 0 → x = -y².

Wait, so substituting y from the first equation into the second. Since y = -x², substitute into x = -y². So x = -(-x²)². Let's compute that.

(-x²)² is x⁴, so x = -x⁴. So the equation becomes x + x⁴ = 0 → x(1 + x³) = 0.

So the solutions for x are x=0 or 1 + x³=0 → x³ = -1 → x = -1.

So when x=0, from y=-x², y=0. So one critical point is (0, 0).

When x=-1, y = -(-1)² = -1. So another critical point is (-1, -1).

So we have two critical points: (0,0) and (-1,-1). So now I need to determine the nature of these critical points—whether they are local maxima, minima, or saddle points.

To do that, I'll use the second derivative test for functions of two variables. The test involves computing the Hessian matrix, which consists of the second partial derivatives.

The Hessian H is:

[ f_xx  f_xy ]
[ f_xy  f_yy ]

So compute f_xx, f_xy, and f_yy.

f_xx is the second partial derivative with respect to x twice. From df/dx = 3x² + 3y, so f_xx is 6x.

Similarly, f_yy is the second partial of df/dy, which was 3y² +3x. So f_yy is 6y.

The mixed partials f_xy and f_yx. Let's compute f_xy: derivative of df/dx with respect to y. df/dx was 3x² + 3y, so derivative with respect to y is 3. Similarly, f_yx is the same, 3.

So Hessian matrix at any point (x,y) is:

[6x    3   ]
[3    6y   ]

Now, to evaluate this at each critical point.

First, at (0,0):

f_xx = 6*0 = 0,

f_yy =6*0 =0,

f_xy=3.

So the Hessian determinant D is (f_xx * f_yy) - (f_xy)^2.

D = (0)(0) - (3)^2 = -9.

Since D is negative, the point (0,0) is a saddle point.

Now, at (-1,-1):

Compute f_xx at x=-1: 6*(-1) = -6.

f_yy at y=-1: 6*(-1) = -6.

f_xy is 3.

So determinant D is (-6)*(-6) - (3)^2 = 36-9 =27.

D is positive, so we look at f_xx. Since f_xx is -6 (negative), this means the point is a local maximum.

So the critical points are:

(0,0): saddle point.

(-1,-1): local maximum.

Wait, but the question is about whether there exist distinct points P and Q such that f has certain features. The options are about what exists at P and Q.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: saddle point at P and local maximum at Q. So that's our case. Because P could be (0,0) (saddle) and Q is (-1,-1) (local max). So E would be correct.

But wait, let me double-check the other options. Let me see:

Option D: saddle at P and local min at Q. But (-1,-1) is a local max, not a min. So D is wrong.

Option I: local max at P and local min at Q. But we don't have a local min anywhere. So I is wrong.

Option E seems right. So the answer should be E.

To determine the nature of the critical points for the function \( f(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 + 3xy \), we first compute the partial derivatives:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y, \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3y^2 + 3x.
\]

Setting these equal to zero to find the critical points:

1. \( 3x^2 + 3y = 0 \implies y = -x^2 \),
2. \( 3y^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x = -y^2 \).

Substituting \( y = -x^2 \) into \( x = -y^2 \), we solve:

\[
x = -(-x^2)^2 \implies x = -x^4 \implies x(1 + x^3) = 0.
\]

This gives \( x = 0 \) or \( x = -1 \). Substituting back:

- For \( x = 0 \), \( y = -0^2 = 0 \), so one critical point is \( (0, 0) \).
- For \( x = -1 \), \( y = -(-1)^2 = -1 \), so the other critical point is \( (-1, -1) \).

Next, we classify these critical points using the second derivative test. The Hessian matrix is:

\[
H = \begin{bmatrix}
f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
f_{xy} & f_{yy}
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where \( f_{xx} = 6x \), \( f_{yy} = 6y \), and \( f_{xy} = 3 \). The Hessian determinant is:

\[
D = f_{xx}f_{yy} - (f_{xy})^2.
\]

1. At \( (0, 0) \):
   \[
   f_{xx} = 0, \quad f_{yy} = 0, \quad f_{xy} = 3,
   \]
   \[
   D = (0)(0) - (3)^2 = -9.
   \]
   Since \( D < 0 \), \( (0, 0) \) is a saddle point.

2. At \( (-1, -1) \):
   \[
   f_{xx} = -6, \quad f_{yy} = -6, \quad f_{xy} = 3,
   \]
   \[
   D = (-6)(-6) - (3)^2 = 36 - 9 = 27.
   \]
   Since \( D > 0 \) and \( f_{xx} < 0 \), \( (-1, -1) \) is a local maximum.

Thus, the function \( f(x, y) \) has a saddle point at \( (0, 0) \) and a local maximum at \( (-1, -1) \). This matches option **E**.
