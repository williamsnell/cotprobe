Okay, I have this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. So the question is about identifying an immediate one-step consequence from the given premises. Let me break it down.

First, let's look at the premises:

1. E ⊃ ~F
2. ~F ⊃ G
3. ~G

And the options are A through J, each a different logical statement. I need to find out which one follows directly from these premises in one step.

Hmm, so I remember that in propositional logic (PL), an immediate consequence is something that can be derived directly using a single inference rule like modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, etc. So each premise and the conclusion must be connected by one such rule.

Let me list out what each premise means:

Premise 1: If E is true, then F is false. So E implies not F.

Premise 2: If F is false, then G is true. So not F implies G.

Premise 3: G is false. So not G is true.

Wait, premise 3 is ~G. So G is false.

I think I should try to chain these together. Let's see.

From premise 2, ~F ⊃ G. But we know from premise 3 that ~G is true. So if G is false, then the antecedent of premise 2 must be false. Because in an implication, if the consequent is false, the antecedent must be false (modus tollens). So from ~F ⊃ G and ~G, we can infer ~ (~F), which is F. So F must be true.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. So, premise 2 is ~F → G. We have ~G (from premise 3). So applying modus tollens, which says that if we have A→B and ~B, then ~A. So here, A is ~F and B is G. So from ~F→G and ~G, we can conclude ~ (~F) which is F. So F is true.

So F is true. So that's a conclusion I can draw from premises 2 and 3.

Now, looking at premise 1: E → ~F. But we've just found out that F is true. So, the contrapositive of an implication is logically equivalent. The contrapositive of E → ~F is F → ~E. Because contrapositive exchanges and negates both parts. So if F is true, then ~E must be true. So E must be false.

Alternatively, using modus tollens again on premise 1. If E→~F, and we have F (which is ~ (~F)), then ~E. So E is false.

So from premises 1 and 2, and 3, we can conclude that E is false.

Wait, but the question is about an immediate one-step consequence. So perhaps I need to find which of the options is directly derivable without needing multiple steps.

Let me look at the options:

Option I: ~G ⊃ ~F. Wait, that's not correct because from ~G, we concluded F, which is the opposite. So ~G leads to F, not ~F.

Option A: ~~F. So that's F. We derived F from premises 2 and 3, so ~~F is F, which is true. But the options are about the form of the implication, not the truth values.

Wait, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence. So perhaps looking for something like E→G or similar.

Wait, another approach. Let's see if any of the options can be derived directly from the premises.

Let's look at the options:

Option D: E ⊃ G

Is E→G an immediate consequence? Let's see. From premise 1, E→~F. From premise 2, ~F→G. So, combining these two, we can get E→G by hypothetical syllogism. Because E→~F and ~F→G, so E→G. But that would be a two-step process, right? Using two premises. So it's not a one-step consequence. Or wait, can hypothetical syllogism be considered a one-step rule? Because it's a single rule application, even though it uses two premises.

Wait, but the question is about an immediate consequence. So sometimes, an immediate consequence refers to a conclusion derived from a single premise, but I think in some contexts, it can involve multiple premises as long as it's a single rule application.

Alternatively, maybe looking for a conclusion that comes directly from one of the premises plus another.

Wait, perhaps looking for the contrapositive of one of the premises.

Looking at premise 1: E → ~F. Its contrapositive is F → ~E. Which would be option J: F → E? No, wait, option J is F→E, which is the converse of F→~E. So that's not correct.

Wait, contrapositive of E→~F is F→~E, which is not among the options. Hmm.

Another approach: using modus tollens on premise 1. If E→~F, and if we have F, then ~E. So from E→~F and F, we get ~E.

But F comes from premises 2 and 3. So that's two steps, which might not be immediate.

Wait, but the question is about a one-step consequence. So perhaps combining two premises in one step.

Wait, let's think about the premises. So we have E→~F, ~F→G, and ~G.

We can use modus tollens on premise 2: ~F→G. Since we have ~G, we can conclude ~~F, which is F. So that's a one-step consequence from premises 2 and 3. So F is true.

So the proposition ~~F is F, which is option A. Wait, option A is ~~F. Which is equivalent to F. So does that count as a consequence? But option A is not an implication; it's a statement. Wait, no, looking back, the options are all implications except maybe A.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

A: ~~F

B: F ⊃ ~~G

C: ~E ⊃ F

D: E ⊃ G

E: G ⊃ F

F: E ⊃ F

G: F ⊃ G

H: G ⊃ E

I: ~G ⊃ ~F

J: F ⊃ E

So option A is ~~F, which is a formula, not an implication. So perhaps that's a possible answer, but the question asks for a proposition, which is a formula. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, but the question says which proposition is an immediate consequence of the premises. So perhaps it's a formula that follows, not necessarily an implication.

But looking at the options, most are implications. So perhaps the correct answer is F = E→F? Or another.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

From premise 2, ~F→G, and premise3, ~G. So using modus tollens on premise2 gives ~~F (which is F). So F is true. So ~~F is true. So option A is ~~F, but that's a formula, not an implication. So perhaps that's the answer, but I'm not sure because the other options are implications.

Alternatively, perhaps the immediate consequence is F. But F isn't listed as an option except in option A as ~~F.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let's see what each option represents and whether it follows directly.

Option D: E→G. As I thought earlier, that can be derived via hypothetical syllogism from E→~F and ~F→G. So E→G is a consequence, but is it immediate? Because it uses two premises. But sometimes, hypothetical syllogism is considered a one-step rule, even though it uses two premises. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, from premise1 and premise2, we can get E→G. So is that an immediate consequence? It would depend on whether the system allows using two premises in a single step. I think in some contexts, yes.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: Since we have ~G (premise3), and from premise2 ~F→G, so G is implied by ~F. But since G is false, ~F must be false, so F is true.

So F is true. Now, looking at premise1, E→~F. Since F is true, ~F is false, so E must be false (modus tollens). So ~E is true.

So we have E→G: Let's see, E implies ~F (premise1), and ~F implies G (premise2). So E implies G. So that's option D. So is that an immediate consequence? I think yes, via hypothetical syllogism, which is a one-step rule.

Wait, but is hypothetical syllogism considered a one-step rule? Because it's a single inference rule, even though it uses two premises. So yeah, I think that's the case.

So the answer would be D: E→G.

Wait, but let me check other options.

Option I: ~G→~F. That would mean if G is false, then F is false. But from our earlier reasoning, since G is false, F must be true. So ~G implies F, not ~F. So option I is incorrect.

Option B: F→~~G. Well, if F is true, then ~~G is G. But G is false, so F implies G, which is false. So F→G would be F→false, which is equivalent to ~F. But F is true, so F→G is false. So option B is incorrect.

Option C: ~E→F. So if E is false, then F is true. From our premises, when E is false, we don't necessarily have F being true. Wait, but we know F is true regardless of E. So ~E→F would be a true implication because F is true. But does it follow from the premises? Because from E→~F, the contrapositive is F→~E. So if F is true, then ~E is true. So E must be false, but that doesn't necessarily mean that ~E implies F. Wait, but since F is true, ~E→F is true, because in logic, if the consequent is true, the implication is true regardless of the antecedent. So ~E→F is true, but is it a consequence of the premises? Or is it a tautology? Hmm, perhaps not directly, but I'm not sure.

Option D: E→G. As discussed, this seems correct via hypothetical syllogism.

Option F: E→F. From our premises, E→~F. So E→F would be the opposite. So that's incorrect.

Option J: F→E. That would mean if F is true, then E is true. But from our premises, E implies ~F, so if E were true, F would be false. But we have F as true, so E must be false. So F→E would be false, because F is true and E is false. So option J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer seems to be option D: E→G.

To determine the immediate one-step consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL), we analyze the premises and apply appropriate inference rules:

1. **Premises**:
   - **E ⊃ ~F**: If E is true, then F is false.
   - **~F ⊃ G**: If F is false, then G is true.
   - **~G**: G is false.

2. **Analysis**:
   - From **~F ⊃ G** (premise 2) and **~G** (premise 3), we apply **modus tollens**. Since G is false, the antecedent ~F must also be false. Therefore, **F** is true.
   - With **F** being true, we analyze **E ⊃ ~F** (premise 1). Using **modus tollens** again, since F is true (and ~F is false), the antecedent E must be false. Thus, **~E** is true.

3. **Immediate Consequence**:
   - To find an immediate one-step consequence, we look for a proposition that follows directly from the premises. Using **hypothetical syllogism** on **E ⊃ ~F** and **~F ⊃ G**, we chain the implications: if E implies ~F, and ~F implies G, then E implies G. This makes **E ⊃ G** an immediate consequence.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A: ~~F**: This simplifies to F, which is true, but it is not an implication and does not directly follow as a one-step consequence.
   - **Option B: F ⊃ ~~G**: This is equivalent to F ⊃ G, but G is false, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option C: ~E ⊃ F**: While ~E is true, this implication does not directly follow from the premises.
   - **Option D: E ⊃ G**: This follows directly via hypothetical syllogism from premises 1 and 2.
   - **Option E: G ⊃ F**: This is incorrect because G is false, and F is true.
   - **Option F: E ⊃ F**: This contradicts premise 1, which states E ⊃ ~F.
   - **Option G: F ⊃ G**: This is incorrect because G is false.
   - **Option H: G ⊃ E**: This is incorrect because G is false, and E is false.
   - **Option I: ~G ⊃ ~F**: This is incorrect because ~G implies F, not ~F.
   - **Option J: F ⊃ E**: This is incorrect because F is true, and E is false.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: E ⊃ G**

Answer: D
