Question:

Differentiate between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

Options:

A: Descriptive statistics are for drawing conclusions, while inferential statistics are for describing data
B: Descriptive statistics use probability theory, while inferential statistics do not
C: Descriptive statistics test hypotheses, while inferential statistics describe situations
D: Descriptive statistics summarize data from a sample, while inferential statistics summarize data from the entire population
E: Descriptive statistics are used to describe situations, data such as measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions from the data, to make 'inferences,' to test hypotheses.
F: Descriptive statistics are based on qualitative data, while inferential statistics are based on quantitative data
G: Descriptive statistics allow predictions about future events, while inferential statistics only describe past events
H: Descriptive statistics use measures of sampling error, while inferential statistics use measures of central tendency
I: Descriptive statistics are used to determine the cause of a trend, while inferential statistics are used to report the existence of a trend
J: Descriptive statistics apply to a population, while inferential statistics apply to a sample

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about descriptive and inferential statistics. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that statistics is split into two main categories: descriptive and inferential. Descriptive is about summarizing data, right? Like, calculating averages, medians, modes, and things like that. So it's more about describing the basic features of the data you have. It doesn't really go beyond the data itself. For example, if I have a dataset of exam scores, descriptive stats would tell me the mean, standard deviation, etc.

Then there's inferential statistics, which I think is used to make inferences or draw conclusions beyond the data you have. So it's about using a sample to make predictions or conclusions about a larger population. Like, if I survey 100 people about their preferences, I can use inferential stats to infer what the entire population might prefer.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through each one.

Option A: "Descriptive statistics are for drawing conclusions, while inferential statistics are for describing data." Wait, that seems opposite. Descriptive is for summarizing, not conclusions. So A is wrong.

Option B: "Descriptive statistics use probability theory, while inferential statistics do not." Hmm. I think it's the other way around. Inferential stats uses probability, like p-values and confidence intervals. Descriptive doesn't really use probability. So B is incorrect.

Option C: "Descriptive statistics test hypotheses, while inferential statistics describe situations." No, I'm pretty sure inferential tests hypotheses. Descriptive doesn't. So C is wrong.

Option D: "Descriptive statistics summarize data from a sample, while inferential statistics summarize data from the entire population." Wait, no. I thought descriptive can be applied to both samples and populations. But inferential is about making inferences from samples to populations. So this might not be right. Or maybe the way it's phrased is off. Let me think again. Descriptive can apply to a sample or population, but inferential is about using a sample to infer about the population. So D's wording might be incorrect because descriptive can be for either, not just samples.

Option E: "Descriptive statistics are used to describe situations, data such as measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions from the data, to make 'inferences,' to test hypotheses." That sounds right. Descriptive uses mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., to summarize. Inferential uses that data to make broader conclusions, like hypothesis testing.

Option F: "Descriptive statistics are based on qualitative data, while inferential statistics are based on quantitative data." No, I don't think that's correct. Both can use quantitative data. Descriptive can involve quantitative data (like calculating means) and qualitative (like modes). But the main point is that F is making a distinction that doesn't fit the main difference.

Option G: "Descriptive statistics allow predictions about future events, while inferential statistics only describe past events." No, that's not right. Inferential can predict future trends to some extent, based on samples. Descriptive is about current data, not predictions.

Option H: "Descriptive statistics use measures of sampling error, while inferential statistics use measures of central tendency." No, sampling error is more inferential, like in confidence intervals. Central tendency is descriptive. So H is wrong.

Option I: "Descriptive statistics are used to determine the cause of a trend, while inferential statistics are used to report the existence of a trend." That doesn't sound right. Descriptive just shows the trend exists, while inferential can test if the trend is significant. Determining cause is more of causal inference, which is a bit beyond basic descriptive stats.

Option J: "Descriptive statistics apply to a population, while inferential statistics apply to a sample." No, I think the opposite is more accurate. Descriptive can apply to samples or populations, and inferential uses samples to infer about populations.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is E. It correctly states that descriptive is about summarizing data with measures like central tendency and dispersion, while inferential is about making inferences and testing hypotheses.

The correct answer is E. Descriptive statistics focus on summarizing data through measures such as central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance), while inferential statistics involve making inferences, drawing conclusions, and testing hypotheses about a population based on sample data.

Answer: E
