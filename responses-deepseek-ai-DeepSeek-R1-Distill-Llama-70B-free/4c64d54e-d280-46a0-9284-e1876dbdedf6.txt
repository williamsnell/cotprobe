Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their parts. Hmm, I remember that neurons have different structures, each with specific functions. The question is asking which part directs the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins. Let me think about each part.

First, the options are A to J, each a different part. I'll try to go through them one by one. 

Option A: Axon terminal. I think axon terminals are at the end of the axon, right? They're involved in releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. But do they make the neurotransmitters? I'm not sure. Maybe they release them but don't produce them.

Option B: Axon. The axon is like the long cable that carries signals away from the cell body. It transmits the action potential. I don't think it's where proteins are made. 

Option C: Synaptic cleft. That's the gap between two neurons, the space where neurotransmitters diffuse. Definitely not where synthesis happens.

Option D: Neuroglia. These are support cells, like glial cells, not part of the neuron itself. They help in various ways but don't produce neurotransmitters.

Option E: Myelin sheath. This is the insulation around the axon, made by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. It helps speed up signal transmission but isn't involved in synthesis.

Option F: Schwann cell. Wait, that's the cell that creates the myelin sheath. Not part of the neuron, so not the answer.

Option G: Cell body. Also called the soma. I remember that the cell body contains the nucleus and the machinery for protein synthesis, like ribosomes. So this is where proteins and neurotransmitters are made, as they need to be synthesized and then transported to other parts of the neuron. 

Option H: Axon hillock. This is the part where the axon emerges from the cell body. It's important for integrating signals and initiating the action potential, but not for making proteins.

Option I: Nodes of Ranvier. These are gaps in the myelin sheath where the action potential is propagated quickly. No synthesis here.

Option J: Dendrite. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons, so they're involved in collecting information, not in synthesizing chemicals.

Putting it all together, the cell body (option G) is where all the protein synthesis happens because it houses the nucleus and ribosomes. Neurotransmitters are also synthesized here before being sent to the axon terminals for release.

The part of the neuron responsible for directing the synthesis of neurotransmitters and proteins is the cell body, also known as the soma. This is because the cell body contains the nucleus and ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis. Neurotransmitters are also synthesized here before being transported to other parts of the neuron, such as the axon terminals, for release. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Axon terminal**: Releases neurotransmitters but does not synthesize them.  
- **B: Axon**: Transmits signals but does not produce proteins or neurotransmitters.  
- **C: Synaptic cleft**: The gap between neurons where neurotransmitters diffuse, not where synthesis occurs.  
- **D: Neuroglia**: Support cells, not part of the neuron, and do not synthesize neurotransmitters.  
- **E: Myelin sheath**: Insulates the axon for faster signal transmission, unrelated to synthesis.  
- **F: Schwann cell**: Creates the myelin sheath, not part of the neuron.  
- **G: Cell body**: Contains the nucleus and ribosomes, responsible for synthesizing proteins and neurotransmitters.  
- **H: Axon hillock**: Initiates action potentials but does not synthesize chemicals.  
- **I: Nodes of Ranvier**: Gaps in the myelin sheath for signal propagation, no synthesis here.  
- **J: Dendrite**: Receives signals, not involved in synthesis.  

Thus, the correct answer is the cell body. 

Answer: G
