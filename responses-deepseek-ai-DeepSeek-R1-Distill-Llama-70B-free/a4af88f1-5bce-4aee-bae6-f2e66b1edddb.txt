Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the entropy change when 1 mole of CO2 liquid is cooled from 273 K to 194.4 K. The process is carried out reversibly and irreversibly by placing the sample in liquid hydrogen at 13.96 K. Hmm, okay, wait, that might be a typo because 13.96 K is much lower than the initial and final temperatures given. Oh well, perhaps that's part of the problem.

The given data includes the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) as 23,175.2 J/mol at 194.4 K. And the specific heat capacity (Cp) is given by a polynomial: 32.22 + (22.18e-3)T + (-23.47e-6)T². So, I think I need to integrate this Cp over the temperature change to find the entropy change for the cooling process.

Wait, but the question says the process is carried out reversibly and irreversibly. Oh wait, but the entropy change of the system should be the same regardless of the path because entropy is a state function. So, whether the process is reversible or not, the entropy change for the system (CO2) would be the same. So maybe the question is just a bit of a trick, leading us to that conclusion.

But let me think again. The process is cooling CO2 from 273 K to 194.4 K. So, the system is the CO2. The surroundings are at 13.96 K? Wait, but that's colder than the CO2's final temperature. That doesn't make sense for cooling. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo and the surrounding is at a higher temperature? Or maybe it's liquid hydrogen, which is at 13.96 K, but that would be way too cold. I'm a bit confused here. But maybe it's just a distraction, and I should focus on the CO2 cooling.

So, for the entropy change, I can calculate it using the specific heat capacity. Since the process is cooling at constant pressure (I assume), the entropy change would be the integral of (Cp / T) dT from initial temperature to final temperature. But wait, in this case, the CO2 is liquid, so maybe it's not undergoing a phase change. Oh wait, no, because when you cool a liquid, you might reach a phase change, like freezing, but the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm, perhaps it just stays as a liquid.

Wait, wait. The initial state is CO2 liquid at 273 K, and it's cooled to CO2 liquid at 194.4 K. So, no phase change occurs here, just cooling of the liquid. So, the entropy change would be ΔS = integral from T1 to T2 of (Cp / T) dT.

But wait, the given ΔHvap is at 194.4 K. Does that play a role here? Maybe not, because vaporization would involve a phase change from liquid to gas, but in this problem, we're just cooling the liquid. So perhaps ΔHvap is a red herring.

So, the plan is: compute the integral of Cp(T)/T dT from 273 K to 194.4 K. The Cp is given as a function of T. So, let's write that out.

Cp(T) = 32.22 + (22.18e-3) T - (23.47e-6) T².

So, the integral becomes:

ΔS = ∫ (32.22 + 0.02218 T - 0.00002347 T²) / T dT, from T_initial = 273 K to T_final = 194.4 K.

Let me split this into three terms:

= ∫ [32.22/T + 0.02218 + (-0.00002347 T) ] dT

Because (32.22)/T + 0.02218 T / T is 0.02218, and (-0.00002347 T²)/T is -0.00002347 T.

So integrating each term from 273 to 194.4.

The integral of 32.22/T is 32.22 ln(T).

The integral of 0.02218 is 0.02218 T.

The integral of (-0.00002347 T) is (-0.00002347) * (T²)/2.

Putting it all together:

ΔS = [32.22 ln(T) + 0.02218 T - 0.00002347*(T²)/2 ] evaluated from 273 to 194.4.

Now, compute this at T_final and T_initial.

Let me calculate each term at both temperatures.

First, at T_final = 194.4 K:

Term1_final = 32.22 * ln(194.4)
Term2_final = 0.02218 * 194.4
Term3_final = 0.00002347 * (194.4)^2 / 2

Similarly, at T_initial = 273 K:

Term1_initial = 32.22 * ln(273)
Term2_initial = 0.02218 * 273
Term3_initial = 0.00002347 * (273)^2 / 2

Now, compute each term step by step.

Calculating each term:

Compute Term1_final: 32.22 * ln(194.4)
ln(194.4) is approximately, since ln(200)=5.298, but 194.4 is a bit less. Let me compute it precisely.

Using calculator:

ln(194.4) ≈ 5.2745.

So, Term1_final ≈ 32.22 * 5.2745 ≈ let's compute that.

32 *5=160, 0.22*5=1.1. 32*0.2745≈8.784. 0.22*0.2745≈0.0604. So total approximately 160 +1.1 +8.784 +0.0604 ≈ 169.9444. Wait, wait, perhaps let me compute 32.22 *5.2745 more accurately.

32.22 *5 =161.1, 32.22 *0.2745 = ?

0.2745 *32 = 8.784, 0.2745 *0.22≈0.0604. So 8.784 + 0.0604 =8.8444. So total 161.1 +8.8444=169.9444.

Term1_final ≈ 169.944 J/K.

Term2_final: 0.02218 *194.4.

0.02 *194.4 =3.888, 0.00218 *194.4≈0.4234. So total ≈4.3114 J/K.

Term3_final: -0.00002347 * (194.4)^2 / 2.

(194.4)^2 = (approx 200-5.6)^2 = 200² - 2*200*5.6 +5.6²=40,000 - 2240 +31.36= approx 37791.36. So 37791.36.

Multiply by 0.00002347: 37791.36 * 0.00002347 ≈ Let's compute that.

37791.36 * 2.347e-5 = (37791 * 2.347e-5) + (0.36 *2.347e-5). Let's compute 37791 *2.347e-5.

37791e-5 is 0.37791. 0.37791 * 2.347 ≈ 0.37791*2=0.75582, 0.37791*0.347≈0.1311. So total ≈0.8869. Then, 0.36 *2.347e-5= 0.000844. So total ≈0.8869 +0.000844≈0.8877. So 0.8877.

But since it's negative and divided by 2: Term3_final ≈ -0.8877 /2 ≈-0.44385 J/K.

So summing up the terms at T_final:

169.944 +4.3114 -0.44385 ≈ 173.8115 J/K.

Now, compute the initial terms at T_initial=273 K.

Term1_initial: 32.22 * ln(273).

ln(273) is approximately 5.605. So 32.22 *5.605 ≈ Let's compute that.

30 *5.605=168.15, 2.22*5.605≈12.45. So total ≈168.15 +12.45=180.6 J/K.

Term2_initial: 0.02218 *273 ≈0.02218 *270=5.9886, plus 0.02218*3=0.06654 → total ≈6.0551 J/K.

Term3_initial: -0.00002347*(273)^2 /2.

273 squared is 74529. So 74529 *0.00002347 ≈ Let's compute that.

74529 *2.347e-5 = (74529 *2.347) *1e-5.

Wait, 74529 *2.347 is approx:

74529 *2=149,058.

74529 *0.347= approx 74529 *0.3=22,358.7; 74529 *0.047≈3,500.

So total ≈22,358.7 +3,500=25,858.7.

So 149,058 +25,858.7=174,916.7. Multiply by 1e-5: 174,916.7e-5=17.49167.

So Term3_initial is -17.49167 /2 ≈-8.7458 J/K.

So summing the initial terms:

180.6 +6.0551 -8.7458 ≈ (180.6 +6.0551)=186.6551 -8.7458=177.9093 J/K.

Now, the total entropy change is [Final terms] - [Initial terms] = 173.8115 -177.9093 ≈-4.0978 J/K.

Wait, that's a negative entropy change, which makes sense because the system is being cooled, so its entropy decreases.

But wait, the question is about the entropy change of the system, which is CO2. So, the entropy change ΔS_system = -4.0978 J/K.

But wait, the options are all positive except option J which is zero. So that's confusing. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Because the process is cooling from 273K to 194.4K, so the entropy change would be negative, but the options don't have negative values.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are all positive except J. So maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total entropy change of the universe, but that's when considering both system and surroundings. But the problem states to calculate the values of the entropy changes for the process. So for the system, it's negative.

But let me double-check the calculations because maybe I made an error in the integration.

Wait, let me recompute the integral.

The integral is [32.22 ln(T) + 0.02218 T - (0.00002347/2) T² ] evaluated from 273 to 194.4.

At T_final=194.4:

32.22 ln(194.4) = 32.22 *5.2745≈169.94.

0.02218 *194.4≈4.311.

- (0.00002347/2) * (194.4)^2 = -0.000011735 * (194.4)^2.

Compute (194.4)^2: 194 *194 = 37636, but let me compute 194.4^2 precisely.

194.4 *194.4 = (200 -5.6)^2 = 200² - 2*200*5.6 +5.6²=40,000 - 2240 +31.36= 40,000 -2240=37,760 +31.36=37,791.36.

So, 0.000011735 *37,791.36 = approx 0.4428.

So the third term is -0.4428.

So sum is 169.94 +4.311 -0.4428 = 173.808 J/K.

At T_initial=273:

32.22 * ln(273) = 32.22 *5.605≈180.6.

0.02218 *273≈6.055.

-0.000011735*(273)^2.

273^2=74529.

0.000011735 *74529≈0.874.

So third term is -0.874.

Sum: 180.6 +6.055 -0.874 = 185.781 J/K.

So ΔS = 173.808 -185.781 = -11.973 J/K.

Wait, that's approximately -12 J/K. But none of the options are close to that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the integral more accurately.

Let me compute each term more precisely.

Compute the definite integral from 273 to 194.4.

The integral is:

32.22 * ln(T) + 0.02218*T - (0.00002347/2)*T².

So:

At T=194.4:

Term1: 32.22 * ln(194.4) = let me compute ln(194.4)=5.2745.

32.22 *5.2745= let's compute it as:

32 *5.2745= 168.774.

0.22 *5.2745=1.1604.

Total 168.774 +1.1604= 169.9344.

Term2: 0.02218 *194.4 = 0.02218 *194.4.

Compute 0.02 *194.4=3.888.

0.00218 *194.4= approx 0.4234.

So 3.888 +0.4234=4.3114.

Term3: -(0.00002347/2)* (194.4)^2.

(194.4)^2= 37,791.36.

Multiply by 0.00002347/2=0.000011735.

So 37791.36 *0.000011735 = let me compute 37791.36 *0.00001=0.3779136.

37791.36 *0.000001735= approx 37791.36 *0.000001=0.03779136, 37791.36 *0.000000735= approx 0.0278.

So total for this part: 0.3779136 +0.03779136 +0.0278 ≈0.4435.

So term3= -0.4435.

So total at T_final: 169.9344 +4.3114 -0.4435 ≈173.8023 J/K.

At T_initial=273:

Term1: 32.22 * ln(273)=32.22 *5.6051≈?

Compute 32 *5.6051=179.3632.

0.22 *5.6051≈1.2331.

Total 179.3632 +1.2331=180.5963 J/K.

Term2: 0.02218 *273=0.02218 *273.

Compute 0.02*273=5.46.

0.00218*273=approx 0.596.

So 5.46 +0.596=6.056 J/K.

Term3: -(0.00002347/2)*(273)^2.

273^2=74529.

Multiply by 0.000011735: 74529 *0.000011735.

Compute 74529 *0.00001=0.74529.

74529 *0.000001735= approx 0.1293.

So total: 0.74529 +0.1293=0.87459.

So term3= -0.87459.

Total at T_initial: 180.5963 +6.056 -0.87459 ≈185.6777 J/K.

So ΔS = 173.8023 -185.6777 = -11.8754 J/K.

Approximately -11.88 J/K.

Wait, that's about -12 J/K. But wait, the options don't have this. The options are all positive except J. So I'm confused. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the problem states that the process is carried out reversibly and irreversibly. So perhaps the entropy change of the surroundings is being considered. Because for an irreversible process, the entropy of the surroundings might be positive, leading to an overall increase in entropy of the universe, but the system's entropy would decrease.

Wait, but the question says "calculate the values of the entropy changes for the process". So, perhaps it's asking for the entropy change of the system plus surroundings. Or maybe it's just the system. But in that case, the system's entropy change is negative, but none of the options match.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the entropy change reversibly and irreversibly, but for the system, it's the same, so the answer would be the same in both cases. But the options don't have a negative value except J, which is zero.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign. Because when you cool a substance, its entropy decreases, so ΔS is negative. But the question might be asking for the magnitude. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the process involves phase change, but the problem states that the CO2 remains liquid, so no phase change occurs.

Wait, but wait, the given ΔHvap is 23,175.2 J/mol at 194.4 K. Hmm, that's the enthalpy of vaporization at 194.4 K. So perhaps the process involves condensation? Wait, but the initial and final states are both liquid. Wait, no, the initial is CO2 liquid at 273 K. When cooled to 194.4 K, it's still liquid. So no phase change, so ΔHvap doesn't come into play here. So that data is irrelevant for this calculation.

Wait, but maybe I should think about it again. Perhaps the process involves cooling the liquid CO2, which may involve some vaporization if the pressure is lower, but the problem states that the process is cooling, so perhaps it's just a simple cooling without phase change.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is being carried out by putting it in contact with liquid hydrogen, which is
