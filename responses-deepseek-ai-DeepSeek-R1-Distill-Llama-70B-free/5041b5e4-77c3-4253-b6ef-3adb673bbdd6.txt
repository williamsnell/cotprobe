Okay, so I've got this probability problem about a coin being tossed three times. I need to find the probability that all three are heads under different conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

The question has three parts: (a), (b), and (c). Each part gives a different condition, so I'll tackle each one separately.

Starting with part (a): If it's known that the first toss is heads, what's the probability all three are heads. Hmm. So, when the first toss is already heads, we don't need to worry about that anymore. We just need the next two tosses to be heads as well. 

Wait, the sample space when a coin is tossed three times is 2^3 = 8 possible outcomes. But since the first is heads, the possible relevant outcomes are only those where the first toss is H. So the possible outcomes are HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT. That's four outcomes. Now, out of these, only HHH is the case where all three are heads. So the probability would be 1 out of 4, which is 1/4. So (a) should be 1/4.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, since the first is given as H, the remaining two tosses each have a probability of 1/2 to be H. So the probability is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. Yeah, that makes sense. So (a) is 1/4.

Moving on to part (b): It's known that the first two are heads. So the first two tosses are H and H, and we need the third to be H as well. So the possible outcomes under this condition are HHH and HHT. Wait, no, actually, wait. If the first two are known to be heads, the only possible outcomes are HHH and HHT and HHT again? No, wait, the first two are fixed as H and H. So the third toss can be either H or T. So the possible outcomes are HHH and HHT. So two outcomes. But wait, the total possible outcomes under this condition are HHH and HHT. So only two possibilities. Now, how many of these have all three heads? Only HHH. So the probability is 1/2.

Wait, alternatively, the third toss is independent. The probability that it's H is 1/2. So yes, (b) is 1/2.

Wait, but wait another moment. Because when we're given that the first two are heads, the sample space is restricted to those cases. So the sample space is HHH and HHT. So two equally likely outcomes. Only one of them is all H's, so probability 1/2. So (b) is 1/2.

Wait wait, but wait again. Another approach: The probability that all three are heads given the first two are heads is equal to the probability that the third is heads. Since each toss is independent, it's 1/2. So same result.

So (b) is 1/2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in the problem statement, part (b) says it's known that the first two are heads. So the condition is that the first two are H, but the third could be anything. So the possible cases are HHH and HHT. So the probability that all three are H is 1/2.

Hmm, but wait, wait another thought. Let me think about the wording again. It says, "if it is known that the first two are heads." So the condition is that the first two are H. So the sample space is all outcomes where the first two are H. So the possible third toss is H or T. So the probability that the third is H is 1/2. So yes, (b) is 1/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Let's look at the options to see if any have (a) 1/4 and (b) 1/2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)1/4.

But wait, let's see what the options say. I'm getting (a) 1/4, (b) 1/2. Let me check the other parts too.

Now, part (c): It's known that two of them are heads. So we need the probability that all three are heads given that exactly two are heads. Wait no, the wording says "if it is known that 2 of them are heads." So the condition is that in the three tosses, exactly two are heads. So the sample space is all outcomes where exactly two are H.

Wait, so the sample space for condition (c) is all outcomes where exactly two are H. Let's list them. The possible outcomes with exactly two H are:

HHT, HTH, THH. So three outcomes.

Now, in these, how many have all three H's? Well, none. Because exactly two H's, so the third is T. So the probability that all three are H is zero? But wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait no, that can't be right. Because if you know that exactly two are H, then the event that all three are H is impossible. Because all three being H would mean that all three are H, which contradicts having exactly two H.

Wait, but wait no. Let me think again. No, the event is that all three are H, but the condition is that exactly two are H. So the event (all three H) is outside the condition. So the probability is zero.

But wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the condition is that two are H, so the event that all are H would have zero probability in this scenario. So the probability would be zero.

But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition. The condition is that two of them are H, but maybe it's at least two, not exactly two. Oh wait, the wording says "it is known that 2 of them are heads." So it's exactly two.

So the sample space for condition (c) is those outcomes where exactly two are H. So HHT, HTH, THH. So three outcomes. None of these have all three H's, so the probability is zero. So (c) would be 0.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option G is (a)1/4, (b)1, (c)0. Hmm, but according to my previous analysis, (b) is 1/2, not 1. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let me go back.

In part (b): If the first two are heads, what's the probability that all three are heads. So the first two are H, so the possible third is H or T. So the two possibilities are HHH and HHT.

Wait, but wait, when the first two are H, the third can be H or T, each with probability 1/2. So the probability that the third is H is 1/2. So (b) is 1/2.

Wait, but in option D, (b) is 1/2, and (c) is 1/4, but according to my analysis, (c) is 0.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating part (c). Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states "it is known that two of them are heads." So the condition is that exactly two are H, not at least two. So the sample space for condition (c) is those outcomes where exactly two are H. So HHT, HTH, THH.

The event we are interested in is that all three are H, which is HHH. But HHH is not in the condition's sample space, so the probability is zero.

Therefore, (c) is 0.

So now, looking at the options, which option has (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)0.

Looking at the options:

Option G: (a)1/4, (b)1, (c)0. So (b) is 1, which doesn't match. So that's not correct.

Wait, no other option has (c) 0 except G. Wait, let me check other options. Option G: (a)1/4, (b)1, (c)0.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let me reevaluate.

In part (b), the condition is that the first two are heads. So the possible outcomes are HHH and HHT. So the sample space size is 2. The event that all are H is HHH, so probability 1/2. So (b) is 1/2.

Therefore, the correct option should be (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)0.

Looking at the options, none have this combination. Let me check all options again.

Option D: (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)1/4 → (c) is 1/4, which doesn't match.

Option G: (a)1/4, (b)1, (c)0 → (b) is 1, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the condition is "at least two heads" instead of exactly two. Because in the question, part (c) says "it is known that 2 of them are heads." Hmm. So if it's at least two, that includes exactly two and exactly three.

In that case, the sample space for condition (c) would include all outcomes with two H's and the outcome with three H's.

So possible outcomes: HHT, HTH, THH, HHH. So four outcomes.

In this scenario, the event that all three are H is HHH, which is one outcome. So the probability is 1/4.

Wait, but the wording says "it is known that 2 of them are heads," which I think refers to exactly two, not at least two. But maybe it's ambiguous. Wait, in probability problems, when they say "it is known that two are heads," it usually means exactly two, not at least two.

But perhaps the problem is using "two of them are heads" in the sense that at least two are H. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the wording is ambiguous, but I think it refers to exactly two. So if that's the case, (c) is 0. But none of the options have (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)0.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me think again.

In part (a), the condition is the first toss is H. So the sample space is all outcomes where first is H: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT. So four possible outcomes. The event that all are H is HHH → 1 outcome. So 1/4.

Yes, that's correct.

In part (b), condition is first two are H → sample space is HHH and HHT. So two outcomes. The event is HHH → 1 outcome. So 1/2.

In part (c), condition is exactly two H's → sample space is HHT, HTH, THH. So three outcomes. The event is all H's → HHH, which is not in the sample space. So probability is 0.

Looking at the options, the only one that has (a)1/4, (c)0 is option G, but option G has (b)1, which is incorrect.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in (c). Let me think again. Maybe the problem is that the condition is that at least two are H. Let's explore that.

If condition (c) is that at least two are H, then the sample space includes outcomes with two H's and three H's.

So possible outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, THH. Four outcomes.

The event that all three are H is HHH → 1 outcome. So the probability is 1/4.

In that case, (c) would be 1/4.

So now, the answers would be:

(a) 1/4

(b) 1/2

(c) 1/4.

Looking at the options, option D is (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)1/4. So option D.

Wait, but the confusion is whether condition (c) is exactly two or at least two. The problem says "it is known that 2 of them are heads." So I think it's exactly two. So (c) should be 0. But none of the options fit that scenario except G, which has (b) wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach could be using conditional probability formula.

For (a):

P(all H | first is H) = P(all H and first H) / P(first H).

But all H includes first H, so P(all H) is 1/8. P(first H) is 4/8 = 1/2. So (1/8)/(1/2) = 1/4. So yes, (a) is 1/4.

For (b):

P(all H | first two H) = P(all H and first two H) / P(first two H).

But all H includes first two H, so P(all H) is 1/8. P(first two H) is the number of outcomes where first two are H: HHH and HHT → 2 outcomes → 2/8 = 1/4. So (1/8)/(2/8) = 1/2. So (b) is 1/2.

For (c):

Condition is exactly two H. So number of outcomes with exactly two H is 3 (HHT, HTH, THH). So P(exactly two H) is 3/8.

P(all H and exactly two H) is zero, since all H is three H, which isn't in exactly two.

So P(all H | exactly two H) = 0 / (3/8) )= 0.

So (c) is 0.

But looking at the options, no option has (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)0 except perhaps none. Wait, looking again at the options:

Option D: (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)1/4.

Option G: (a)1/4, (b)1, (c)0.

Hmm. Since I'm getting (c)=0, but the only option with (c)=0 is G, but G has (b)=1, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in (b). Let me think again.

In part (b), the condition is that the first two are H. So the sample space is HHH and HHT. So two outcomes. The probability that all three are H is 1/2. So (b)=1/2.

So the options must have (a)=1/4, (b)=1/2, (c)=0, but there's no such option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps part (c) is considering at least two H's. Let me recalculate (c) under that assumption.

For (c), if the condition is at least two H's, then the sample space includes HHH, HHT, HTH, THH. So four outcomes.

The event that all three are H is HHH, which is 1 outcome. So the probability is 1/4.

Therefore, (a)=1/4, (b)=1/2, (c)=1/4. So that's option D.

But wait, the original wording says "it is known that 2 of them are heads." That could be interpreted as exactly two, but perhaps the problem is using it as at least two. Maybe the wording is ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using "two of them are heads" to mean that exactly two are H.

In that case, (c) would be 0, but no option fits.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (c). Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that exactly two are H, but the event is all three H. So the probability is zero.

But none of the options have (c)=0 except G, which has (b)=1, which is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option E: (a)1/2, (b)1, (c)1/3.

Wait, part (a) probability 1/2 would mean that given the first is H, the chance of all three H is 1/2. That would be if the first is H, and the next two are H with probability (1/2)^2=1/4, but wait, that's 1/4. So E's (a) is 1/2, which is wrong.

Option H: All are 1/2. No, that can't be right.

Option D: (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)1/4.

If I accept that (c) is 1/4, assuming that the condition is at least two H's, then D would be the answer.

But the question says "it is known that 2 of them are heads." So probably exactly two.

Hmm. But then none of the options fit except G, which has (b) as 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it another way. Let me try to list all possible outcomes and see.

All possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times:

1. HHH

2. HHT

3. HTH

4. HTT

5. THH

6. THT

7. TTH

8. TTT.

Now, for (a): first is H. So possible outcomes 1,2,3,4.

We need all H's, which is outcome 1. So 1/4.

For (b): first two are H. So outcomes 1 and 2.

We need all three H's, which is outcome 1. So 1/2.

For (c): exactly two H's. So outcomes 2,3,5.

We need all three H's, which is outcome 1, which is not in the condition's sample space. So probability is 0.

But since no option matches (a)1/4, (b)1/2, (c)0, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the condition in (c) is at least two H's
