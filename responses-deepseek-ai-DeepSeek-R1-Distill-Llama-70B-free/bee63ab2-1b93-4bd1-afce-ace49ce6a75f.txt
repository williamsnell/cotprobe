Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 8y equals 56. I need to find out what y is. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equations like this are solved by getting y by itself on one side. 

Wait, the equation is 8 times y equals 56. So to solve for y, I should probably divide both sides by 8. That makes sense because division is the opposite of multiplication. So if I divide both sides by 8, the left side becomes just y, and the right side would be 56 divided by 8. 

Let me think about what 56 divided by 8 is. I know that 8 times 7 is 56 because 8 times 5 is 40, and 8 times 2 is 16. 40 plus 16 is 56. So 8 times 7 equals 56. That means 56 divided by 8 is 7. So y must be 7. 

Looking at the options, I see that option H is 7. So the correct answer should be H. But wait, let me double-check. If I plug 7 back into the original equation, 8 times 7 is 56. Yep, that works out. So I'm confident that y equals 7.

To solve \(8y = 56\), divide both sides by 8:

\[
y = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

Thus, the correct answer is H: 7.

Answer: H
