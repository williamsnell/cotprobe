Okay, so I've got this research methods question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking about a type of research where there's no manipulation of variables, and they're just measured, not changed. The options are from A to G, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that in research, there are different designs like experimental, quasi-experimental, correlational, etc. I think experimental research involves manipulating variables. Like, you have an independent variable that you change to see the effect on the dependent variable. So that's probably not the answer here because the question says no manipulation.

Wait, what about correlational research? I think in correlational studies, you don't manipulate variables. Instead, you observe them to see if there's a relationship. For example, you might measure how much people exercise and their weight to see if there's a correlation. But you're not changing anything, just observing and measuring. That sounds like it fits the description.

Looking at the options, option F is CORRELATIONAL RESEARCH. So that's a possibility. But let me think about the other options to be sure.

Option A is qualitative research. Qualitative studies are more about understanding experiences, like through interviews or observations. They don't involve variables or statistical analysis, so it's a different approach. But the question is more about whether variables are manipulated, which is more of a quantitative research aspect.

Option B is exploratory research. That's when you're trying to explore a topic, maybe in the early stages. It can involve various methods, both qualitative and quantitative. But I don't think it's specifically about not manipulating variables; it's more about the purpose of the research.

Option C is longitudinal research. That's when you study the same subjects over a long period. It could involve measuring variables at different times, but I don't think it's specifically about not manipulating variables. You could have longitudinal experimental studies, I suppose.

Option D is true experimental research. That definitely involves manipulation because you're assigning subjects to groups, like treatment and control, and applying the independent variable. So this is the opposite of what the question is asking.

Option E is quasi-experimental research. This is similar to experiments but without random assignment. You still manipulate variables because you're applying a treatment, but it's not as strict as a true experiment. So again, this involves manipulation, which isn't what we're looking for.

Option G is developmental research. I'm not as sure about this one. Developmental research might look at changes over time, perhaps across different age groups. But again, whether variables are manipulated depends on the specific study. It might not necessarily be non-manipulative.

So putting it all together, the question is about no manipulation and just measuring variables. That points to correlational research because in that method, you don't alter any variables; you just observe and measure to find relationships or correlations between them.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is F: CORRELATIONAL RESEARCH.

The question asks about a type of research where variables are measured without manipulation. Experimental and quasi-experimental designs involve manipulating variables, so they're not the answer. Qualitative research focuses on understanding experiences, not variable measurement. Exploratory research is about initial investigations, and longitudinal and developmental studies involve observing changes over time but don't necessarily preclude manipulation. Correlational research, however, specifically involves measuring variables to identify relationships without altering them.
