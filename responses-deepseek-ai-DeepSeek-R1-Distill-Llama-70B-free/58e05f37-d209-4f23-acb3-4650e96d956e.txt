Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says a metallic coating absorbs 88% of the incident light. Then there's a thin film with half the optical density of the coating. I need to find the transmittance of the film. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that optical density is related to absorbance, which is the logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted light. So, optical density (OD) is OD = -log(T), where T is transmittance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Maybe it's OD equals log(I_initial / I_transmitted). Oh right, because absorbance is log(I0 / I), which is the same as -log(I/I0), where I is transmitted. So OD is log(1/T), because T is I/I0.

Wait, so the coating has an absorbance of 88%? Or does it absorb 88%? Oh wait, the question says it absorbs 88% of the incident light. So the transmittance of the coating is 12%, because 100% - 88% = 12%. So T_coating is 0.12.

So the OD of the coating is log(1/0.12), since OD = log(1/T). Let me calculate that. 1/0.12 is approximately 8.333. The log (base 10) of 8.333 is about 0.921. So OD_coating ≈ 0.921.

The film has half the optical density of the coating. So OD_film = 0.921 / 2 ≈ 0.4605.

Now, to find the transmittance of the film. Since OD = log(1/T), then T = 1/(10^OD). So T_film = 1/(10^0.4605).

Calculating 10^0.4605. Let's think about it. 10^0.46 is about 2.88 approximately? Because 10^0.4771 is 3 (since log10(3)=0.4771), so 0.46 is a bit less than that. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 10^0.46 = e^(0.46 * ln(10)) ). Hmm, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, approximate it.

Another approach: 10^0.46 ≈ 2.89? Because 10^0.46 = 10^(0.4 + 0.06) = 10^0.4 * 10^0.06.

I remember that 10^0.3 ≈ 2, 10^0.4 ≈ 2.5119, 10^0.48 is about 3. So 10^0.46 is between 2.88 and 2.89.

But perhaps an exact calculation isn't necessary. Let me compute 10^0.4605.

Wait, another approach: log(2.8) is approximately 0.447, because 10^0.447 ≈ 2.8. Let me check: 10^0.447 → 10^0.4 is about 2.5119, 0.447 is 0.4 + 0.047. So 10^0.447 ≈ 2.5119 * (10^0.047). 10^0.047 is approximately 1.113 (since ln(1.113) ≈ 0.106, and 0.047 * ln10 ≈ 0.047*2.3026≈0.108, so e^(0.108)=1.114). So 2.5119 * 1.114 ≈ 2.8.

So 10^0.447 ≈ 2.8. So 10^(0.4605) is a bit higher. 0.4605 - 0.447 = 0.0135. So 10^0.0135 is approximately 1.0317 (since ln(1.0317)≈0.0312, and 0.0135*2.3026≈0.0311). So 10^0.0135 ≈ 1.0317.

So 10^0.4605 ≈ 2.8 * 1.0317 ≈ 2.89. So 10^0.4605 ≈ 2.89. Therefore, T_film = 1/2.89 ≈ 0.346.

So approximately 34.6% transmittance. Looking at the options, option C is 34.6%. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Another way to approach it: using the formula step by step.

OD_coating = log(1/T_coating) → T_coating = 0.12 → OD_coating = log(1/0.12) = log(8.333...) ≈ 0.921.

OD_film = OD_coating / 2 → 0.921 / 2 ≈ 0.4605.

T_film = 10^(-OD_film) → 10^(-0.4605) ≈ 0.346.

So 34.6%, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the metallic coating absorbs 88% of the incident light, meaning its transmittance is:

\[
T_{\text{coating}} = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12 \, \text{or} \, 12\%.
\]

Optical density (OD) is defined as:

\[
\text{OD} = -\log(T) = \log\left(\frac{1}{T}\right).
\]

For the coating, the OD is:

\[
\text{OD}_{\text{coating}} = \log\left(\frac{1}{0.12}\right) = \log(8.333) \approx 0.921.
\]

The thin film has half the optical density of the coating, so:

\[
\text{OD}_{\text{film}} = \frac{\text{OD}_{\text{coating}}}{2} = \frac{0.921}{2} \approx 0.4605.
\]

The transmittance of the film is calculated using the inverse of the OD formula:

\[
T_{\text{film}} = \frac{1}{10^{\text{OD}_{\text{film}}}} = \frac{1}{10^{0.4605}}.
\]

Approximating \(10^{0.4605}\), we find:

\[
10^{0.4605} \approx 2.89 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_{\text{film}} = \frac{1}{2.89} \approx 0.346 \, \text{or} \, 34.6\%.
\]

Thus, the transmittance of the film is approximately **34.6%**, which corresponds to option **C**.
