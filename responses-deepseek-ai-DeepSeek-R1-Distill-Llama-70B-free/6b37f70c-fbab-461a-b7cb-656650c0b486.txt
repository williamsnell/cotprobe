Okay, so I've got this problem here about the weights of carrot bags and probability. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the problem says that a 1-pound bag has a weight distribution that's normal with a mean of 1.18 and a variance of 0.07 squared. So that's N(1.18, 0.07²). And the 3-pound bag has a distribution of N(3.22, 0.09²). The question is asking for the probability that the sum of three 1-pound bags is heavier than one 3-pound bag. So, I need to find P(Y > W), where Y is the sum of three 1-pound bags and W is the weight of a 3-pound bag.

Wait, the hint says to first determine Y's distribution. Right, because Y is the sum of three independent normal variables. Oh wait, but are they independent? I think the problem says we're selecting bags at random, so I'll assume each bag's weight is independent of the others.

So, for Y, which is the sum of three 1-pound bags. Each has mean 1.18, so the mean of Y would be 3 * 1.18. Let me calculate that: 3 * 1.18 is 3.54. 

As for the variance, since each has a variance of 0.07², and they're independent, the variance of Y would be 3 times that. So variance Y = 3 * (0.07)². Let's compute that: 0.07 squared is 0.0049, multiplied by 3 is 0.0147. So the standard deviation of Y is the square root of 0.0147. Let me see, sqrt(0.0147) is approximately 0.121. 

So Y is N(3.54, 0.121²). 

Now, W is the weight of the 3-pound bag, which is N(3.22, 0.09²). So W has mean 3.22 and standard deviation 0.09.

I need to find P(Y > W). Hmm, when we have two normal variables, the probability that one is greater than the other can be found by considering their difference. Let me think: Y - W would be a new normal variable. Because the difference of two independent normals is also normal.

So, let me compute the distribution of Y - W. 

The mean of Y - W is mean(Y) - mean(W) = 3.54 - 3.22 = 0.32.

The variance of Y - W is var(Y) + var(W) because they are independent (variances add when you subtract independent variables). So var(Y) is 0.0147, var(W) is 0.09² = 0.0081. Adding them together: 0.0147 + 0.0081 = 0.0228. So the standard deviation is sqrt(0.0228), which is approximately 0.151.

So Y - W is N(0.32, 0.151²). Now, I need to find P(Y > W), which is the same as P(Y - W > 0). So this is the probability that a normal variable with mean 0.32 and standard deviation 0.151 is greater than zero.

To find this probability, I can convert it to the Z-score. The Z-score is (X - μ) / σ. Here, X is 0, so Z = (0 - 0.32) / 0.151. Let me calculate that: 0.32 divided by 0.151 is approximately 2.116. So Z ≈ -2.116. Wait, no, because (0 - 0.32) is negative. So Z = -2.116.

But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, Y - W has a mean of 0.32. So when I compute P(Y - W > 0), it's the same as 1 minus the probability that a N(0.32, 0.151²) is less than 0.

Alternatively, the Z-score is (0 - 0.32)/(0.151) = (-0.32)/(0.151) ≈ -2.116. So the probability that Y - W is less than 0 is the same as the probability that Z is less than -2.116. Then the probability we're looking for is 1 minus that.

Wait, no wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Y - W ~ N(0.32, 0.151²). So P(Y - W > 0) is the same as P(Z > (0 - 0.32)/0.151 ) = P(Z > (-0.32)/0.151) = P(Z > -2.116).

But wait, because the mean of Y - W is 0.32, so Y - W is centered around 0.32. So the probability that Y - W is greater than 0 is the same as the area under the normal curve from 0 to infinity. Since the mean is 0.32, which is greater than 0, this probability should be more than 0.5.

Wait, but I'm getting a Z value of (0 - 0.32)/0.151 ≈ -2.116. So the Z-score is -2.116. So the P(Y - W > 0) is the same as P(Z > -2.116). Because Y - W > 0 is the same as Z > (0 - mean)/std.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. 

The variable Y - W has a mean of 0.32 and a standard deviation of 0.151. So, to find P(Y > W) = P(Y - W > 0).

We can compute this as 1 - P(Y - W <= 0). 

To find P(Y - W <= 0), we can standardize it. So Z = (0 - 0.32) / 0.151 ≈ (-0.32)/0.151 ≈ -2.116. 

So P(Y - W <=0) = P(Z <= -2.116). 

Looking at the standard normal distribution table, the value for Z = -2.116 is the cumulative probability up to that point. Alternatively, since the Z-table might give the area to the left of Z. 

Wait, but let me think: for a Z of -2.116, the cumulative probability is the area to the left of -2.116. Let me check what that is. 

I remember that for Z=-2, it's about 0.0228, and Z=-2.12 is about 0.0174 (since Z=-2.1 is 0.0179). Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise approach. Alternatively, I can approximate using the standard normal distribution. 

Alternatively, using a calculator, for Z = -2.116, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.017. So P(Y - W <=0) is 0.017. Therefore, P(Y - W >0) is 1 - 0.017 = 0.983.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.9830. So the answer must be G.

Wait, but let me recheck my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the variance. Let's see:

Each 1-pound bag has variance 0.07². So three of them would have variance 3*(0.07²) = 3*0.0049 = 0.0147. Correct.

The 3-pound bag has variance 0.09² = 0.0081. Correct.

So when subtracting W from Y, the variance is 0.0147 + 0.0081 = 0.0228. Correct.

Standard deviation is sqrt(0.0228) ≈ 0.151. Correct.

Mean difference is 3.54 -3.22=0.32. Correct.

Z = (0 - 0.32)/0.151 ≈ -2.116. So the cumulative probability for Z=-2.116 is about 0.017, so 1 - 0.017 = 0.983. So option G is correct.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the weights of three 1-pound bags exceeds the weight of one 3-pound bag. 

### Step 1: Distribution of Y (sum of three 1-pound bags)
Each 1-pound bag has a weight distribution of \( N(1.18, 0.07^2) \). Since the bags are independent, the sum of three such bags, \( Y \), is also normally distributed. The mean and variance of \( Y \) are calculated as follows:
- Mean of \( Y \): \( 3 \times 1.18 = 3.54 \)
- Variance of \( Y \): \( 3 \times (0.07)^2 = 3 \times 0.0049 = 0.0147 \)
- Standard deviation of \( Y \): \( \sqrt{0.0147} \approx 0.121 \)

Thus, \( Y \sim N(3.54, 0.121^2) \).

### Step 2: Distribution of W (weight of one 3-pound bag)
The weight of the 3-pound bag is given as \( N(3.22, 0.09^2) \). Therefore:
- Mean of \( W \): \( 3.22 \)
- Variance of \( W \): \( (0.09)^2 = 0.0081 \)
- Standard deviation of \( W \): \( 0.09 \)

Thus, \( W \sim N(3.22, 0.09^2) \).

### Step 3: Distribution of \( Y - W \)
To find \( P(Y > W) \), we consider the difference \( Y - W \), which is also normally distributed. The mean and variance of \( Y - W \) are:
- Mean of \( Y - W \): \( 3.54 - 3.22 = 0.32 \)
- Variance of \( Y - W \): \( 0.0147 + 0.0081 = 0.0228 \) (since \( Y \) and \( W \) are independent)
- Standard deviation of \( Y - W \): \( \sqrt{0.0228} \approx 0.151 \)

Thus, \( Y - W \sim N(0.32, 0.151^2) \).

### Step 4: Calculate \( P(Y > W) \)
We need to find \( P(Y > W) = P(Y - W > 0) \). To do this, we standardize \( Y - W \) using the Z-score formula:
\[
Z = \frac{0 - 0.32}{0.151} \approx -2.116
\]
This means we are looking for \( P(Z > -2.116) \), which is equivalent to \( 1 - P(Z \leq -2.116) \). From the standard normal distribution table:
- \( P(Z \leq -2.116) \approx 0.017 \)
- Therefore, \( P(Y > W) = 1 - 0.017 = 0.983 \).

### Final Answer
The probability that the sum of three 1-pound bags exceeds the weight of one 3-pound bag is approximately **0.9830**, which corresponds to option **G**.
