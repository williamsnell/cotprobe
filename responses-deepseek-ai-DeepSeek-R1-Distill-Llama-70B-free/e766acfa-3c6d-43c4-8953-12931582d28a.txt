Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the open-to-buy for a shirt buyer at Wellington's Department Store. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on retail math, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that open-to-buy (OTB) is the amount a buyer can spend on purchasing new merchandise for the upcoming period. It's based on projected needs and ensures that the store doesn't overstock or understock. I think the formula involves several factors like planned sales, current inventory, commitments, and markdowns.

Let me list out the given data again to make it clear:

- Present inventory at retail (Jan 17): $12,000
- Inventory commitments (Jan 17): $3,000
- Planned end-of-month inventory (Jan 31): $15,000
- Planned sales: $6,000
- Actual sales: Hmm, wait, does that matter? Or is it the planned sales we use?
- Planned markdowns: $500
- Actual markdowns: $200

Wait, I think the formula is something like:

OTB = (Planned Sales / Sell-through rate) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Current Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's:

OTB = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdown - Actual Markdown) + Beginning Inventory - Ending Inventory

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Maybe the basic approach is to calculate the total needed and subtract what's already on hand or committed.

Oh right, I think the formula is:

Open-to-Buy = (Planned End-of-Month Inventory + Planned Sales) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

Wait, but markdowns... Oh, because markdowns reduce the inventory value, right? So maybe the formula adjusts for that.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Calculate the total available for sale, which would be the sum of present inventory and inventory commitments. But then, we have to account for markdowns because they reduce the selling price.

Wait, present inventory is already at retail, so maybe markdowns are subtracted to adjust the value. Or perhaps markdowns are considered when calculating the projected sales.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for the standard formula. From what I remember, the open-to-buy is calculated as:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Planned End Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments) + Markdown Adjustments

Wait, but I'm not certain about the markdown part. Alternatively, the formula might be:

OTB = (Planned Sales - Markdowns) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + On Order)

Wait, perhaps the markdowns are subtracted from the sales because markdowns are reductions in price, which affect the revenue but not the quantity. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me try another approach. The buyer wants to know how much more they can buy (open-to-buy) to meet their sales and inventory goals.

The steps might be:

1. Determine the total amount of goods needed to be on hand to meet planned sales and have the desired ending inventory.

2. Subtract the goods already available (present inventory plus commitments) to find out how much more needs to be purchased.

But I think I need to account for markdowns as well because they affect the value of the inventory.

Planned sales are $6,000. Let's see.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes is:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Planned Ending Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

But wait, do markdowns affect the beginning inventory? Because markdowns reduce the value, so perhaps the beginning inventory is adjusted for markdowns.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

OTB = (Planned Sales - Markdown Allowance) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + On Order)

But I'm not sure if that's right. Alternatively, the markdowns are considered in the calculation of the needed inventory.

Wait, maybe the markdowns are subtracted from the planned sales because they represent the loss from markdowns. So, the total funds needed would be planned sales minus markdowns.

Wait, let's try plugging in the numbers.

Planned Sales: $6,000
Planned Markdowns: $500
So, perhaps the adjusted planned sales would be $6,000 - $500 = $5,500.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the markdowns are subtracted from the beginning inventory because they reduce the value of the inventory on hand. So, the beginning inventory would be $12,000 - $200 (actual markdowns) = $11,800.

Wait, but the actual markdowns are $200, while planned were $500. Do I use actual or planned here? Hmm, the problem gives both, but I'm not sure which to use. Maybe the formula uses planned markdowns when calculating OTB because it's a plan.

So, perhaps:

OTB = (Planned Sales - Planned Markdowns) + Planned Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

Wait, but that would be:

(6,000 - 500) + 15,000 - (12,000 + 3,000) 

So that's (5,500) +15,000 = 20,500; minus (15,000) equals 5,500. But looking at the options, I don't see $5,500. Option C is $5,000, which is close but not exact. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the markdowns are added back because they are a reduction in value. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Planned Markdowns) + Planned Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

Wait, that would make more sense if markdowns are expected to reduce the value of inventory, so you need to account for that. Let me try that.

Planned Sales: $6,000
Planned Markdowns: $500
So, total would be 6,000 + 500 = 6,500.

Plus planned ending inventory: 6,500 +15,000 = 21,500.

Minus (present inventory + commitments) which is 12,000 +3,000 =15,000.

So 21,500 -15,000 =6,500. But that's not among the options either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try a different approach. I remember that the open-to-buy is the amount you can spend to reach the desired inventory level, considering what's already on hand and what's on order.

The basic formula is:

OTB = (Desired Ending Inventory) + (Planned Sales) - (Beginning Inventory) - (Inventory Commitments)

But wait, that's OTB = (Desired End + Planned Sales) - (Beginning + Commitments). Does that make sense?

Let me plug in the numbers:

Desired Ending Inventory: $15,000
Planned Sales: $6,000
Beginning Inventory: $12,000
Commitments: $3,000

So, OTB = (15,000 +6,000) - (12,000 +3,000) = 21,000 -15,000 =6,000.

Hmm, option H is $6,000. But wait, this doesn't account for markdowns. So maybe that's where I'm going wrong.

Because if the present inventory is at retail, and markdowns are planned, then the value of the present inventory should be adjusted for markdowns to find the actual amount available to sell.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Planned Markdowns) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

But that gives as before 6,000 +500 =6,500, plus 15,000=21,500. Minus 15,000=6,500. Hmm, not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the markdowns are subtracted from the beginning inventory. So:

Beginning Inventory after markdowns = $12,000 - $500 (planned) = $11,500

Then, OTB = (Planned Sales) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory after markdown + Commitments)

So, 6,000 +15,000 =21,000. Minus (11,500 +3,000)=14,500. 21,000-14,500=6,500. Again, not matching.

Wait, maybe the markdowns are actual, not planned. So, actual markdowns of $200. So beginning inventory after markdowns is 12,000 -200=11,800.

Then OTB = (6,000 +15,000) - (11,800 +3,000) =21,000 -14,800=6,200. Close to option B ($12,200?), no, that's 6,200. But options don't have that.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me check some notes. Oh wait, another approach: The open-to-buy is the amount needed to purchase to have enough stock to meet sales and end with desired inventory, considering what's already in stock and on order.

The formula might be:

OTB = (Planned Sales) + (Desired Ending Inventory) - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments) + (Markdown Allowance)

Wait, why plus markdown allowance? Because the markdowns are expected, so they might represent a reduction in the value of the goods sold. So to cover that, they are added back.

So, let's try that:

Planned Sales: 6,000

Desired Ending Inventory:15,000

Beginning Inventory:12,000

Commitments:3,000

Markdown Allowance:500 (planned)

So, OTB =6,000 +15,000 -12,000 -3,000 +500= (6k+15k)=21k; (12k+3k)=15k; 21k-15k=6k; 6k +500=6,500. Hmm, again 6,500 not in options.

Wait the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the present inventory is at retail, but when calculating OTB, we should consider the cost, but the data given is all in retail dollars. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

OTB = (Beginning Inventory + Commitments + OTB) - (Markdowns) = Planned Sales + Desired Ending Inventory

So rearranging:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Desired Ending Inventory + Markdowns) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

Wait, let's plug that in.

Planned Sales:6,000

Desired Ending Inventory:15,000

Markdowns:500

Beginning:12,000

Commitments:3,000

So OTB = (6k +15k +0.5k) - (12k +3k) =21.5k -15k=6.5k. Again, 6,500.

But none of the options match. What am I doing wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I should not be adding the markdowns but subtracting them. Let me try that.

OTB = (6k +15k -0.5k) - (12k +3k) = (20.5k) -15k=5.5k.

That's $5,500. Hmm, but the closest option is C: $5,000. Not exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the actual markdowns are used instead of planned. So actual markdowns are $200.

So, OTB = (6k +15k -0.2k) - (12k +3k) = (20.8k) -15k=5.8k, which is $5,800. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Wait, I found another formula: OTB = (Planned Sales + Planned Markdowns) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

So that would be 6k +0.5k +15k =21.5k. Minus 15k (12k+3k) gives 6.5k.

Still 6,500. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try the basic approach without considering markdowns first.

OTB = (Desired Ending Inventory + Planned Sales) - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

So 15k +6k=21k. 12k+3k=15k.

21k-15k=6k. So OTB is $6,000, which is option H.

But that doesn't consider markdowns. So why are markdowns given then? Maybe they're a red herring, or perhaps they're needed to adjust the beginning inventory.

Wait, perhaps the beginning inventory is reduced by the markdowns. So the adjusted beginning inventory is 12k - 0.2k (actual markdowns) =11.8k.

Then OTB would be (15k +6k) - (11.8k +3k)=21k -14.8k=6.2k, which is $6,200. But that's not an option either.

Hmm. Or perhaps the markdowns are subtracted from the planned sales. So planned sales are 6k, but with markdowns, the amount you can buy is less.

Wait, let me think differently. The total amount available to sell includes present inventory, minus markdowns, plus incoming commitments, plus any new purchases (OTB).

Wait, perhaps the total available is:

Beginning Inventory + Commitments + OTB - Markdowns = Planned Sales + Ending Inventory.

So, rearranged:

OTB = Planned Sales + Ending Inventory + Markdowns - Beginning Inventory - Commitments.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Planned Sales:6k

Ending Inventory:15k

Markdowns:0.5k (planned, since we're planning)

Beginning:12k

Commitments:3k

So OTB =6k +15k +0.5k -12k -3k = (21.5k) -15k=6.5k.

Again, $6,500. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses actual markdowns. So using $200.

OTB=6k+15k+0.2k -12k-3k=21.2k-15k=6.2k.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the formula. Let me check again.

I think the correct formula is:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Planned Markdowns) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Inventory Commitments)

So:

6,000 (sales) +500 (markdowns) +15,000 (ending)=21,500.

Minus (12,000 +3,000)=15,000.

21,500-15,000=6,500.

But this isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is $10,800. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

OTB = (Planned Sales - (Planned Markdowns / Sell-through Rate)) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

Wait, but I don't have the sell-through rate here. So maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, another approach: The total inventory needed is the sum of what's needed for sales and ending inventory. So, the total required is Planned Sales + Desired Ending Inventory. But the buyer already has some inventory and commitments, so subtract those.

But wait, that's similar to what I did before, giving 6,000. But that's option H.

But the presence of markdowns complicates things. Maybe the markdowns are considered as part of the planned sales adjustment. So, the buyer expects that some of the inventory will be sold at a markdown, thus reducing the total value.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

OTB = (Planned Sales - (Planned Markdowns)) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments)

So that would be 6,000 -500=5,500 +15,000=20,500.

Minus (12k +3k)=15k.

20,500-15,000=5,500. So $5,500, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the markdowns are added to the beginning inventory. Because the markdowns are expected to reduce the price, so the buyer needs to have more stock to meet the sales. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the markdowns are a separate line item. Let me try adding the markdowns to the beginning inventory.

So, adjusted beginning inventory would be 12,000 +500=12,500.

Then, OTB=6,000 +15,000 - (12,500 +3,000)=21,000 -15,500=5,500.

Again, same as before.

Wait, but the options have $10,800 as option D. How can I get that?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the terms. Let me clarify each term.

Present inventory at retail: This is the value of the goods currently in stock, priced at retail.

Inventory commitments: The value of goods that have been ordered but not yet received.

Planned end-of-month inventory: The desired level of inventory at the end of the period.

Planned sales: The expected sales for the period.

Planned markdowns: The expected amount of markdowns to be taken during the period.

Actual markdowns: The markdowns that have already been taken up to the point of calculation (Jan 17).

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

OTB = (Planned Sales + Planned Markdowns) + Desired Ending Inventory - (Beginning Inventory + Commitments + Actual Markdowns)

So:

6,000 +500=6,500; plus 15,000=21,500.

Minus (12,000 +3,000 +200)=15,200.

21,500 -15,200=6,300. Not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the markdowns are subtracted from the beginning inventory.

So, beginning inventory adjusted for markdowns:12,000 -200=11,800.

OTB= (6,000 +15,000) - (11,800 +3,000)=21,000 -14,800=6,200.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

OTB = (Planned Sales - Actual Sales) + (Planned Markdowns - Actual Markdowns) + (Desired Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory - Commitments)

Wait, but Actual Sales are given as 3,000. So:

Planned Sales 6k - Actual 3k=3k.

Planned Markdowns 0.5k - Actual 0.2k=0.3k.

Desired Ending 15k -12k -3k=0k.

So OTB=3k +0.3k +0=3.3k. That's $3,300, which is option E.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the buyer's OTB shouldn't be based on the
