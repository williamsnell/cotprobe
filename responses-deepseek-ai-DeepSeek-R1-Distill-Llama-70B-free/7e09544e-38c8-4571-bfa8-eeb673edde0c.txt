Okay, so I have this question about Donald Super and his theory. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which graph or model Super used to depict the correspondence between an individual's life roles and life stages.

I remember that Super was a prominent figure in career development theory. His main idea was that people go through different life stages and have various roles throughout their lives. I think he proposed something called the "Life-Span, Life-Space Approach." So, the model he used probably reflects that.

Wait, what's the name of his model? I'm trying to recall. I think it's something like a rainbow... Oh right, the Life Career Rainbow! That rings a bell. I remember seeing a diagram with different colors representing different roles, arranged in a rainbow shape. Each color stood for a different role, like work, family, community, etc., and the prominence of each role changes as a person goes through different life stages.

Let me double-check the options. The options are A through J. Option A is "life career rainbow," which sounds exactly like what I'm thinking of. So that's probably the correct answer.

Other options like "life cycle wheel" or "life stage map" don't sound familiar. The career ladder is more of a linear progression idea, which doesn't fit Super's model as much. The Life Career Rainbow is more about the various roles and how they evolve over time, not just a linear climb.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is A: life career rainbow.

The correct answer is A: life career rainbow. This model, developed by Donald Super, visually represents how different life roles correspond to various life stages, using a rainbow metaphor where each color signifies a different role.
