Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about paleoanthropology, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the consensus among paleoanthropologists regarding anatomically modern humans. The options are A through J, each describing different scenarios about where they evolved and their migration patterns.

I remember that anatomically modern humans, Homo sapiens, are believed to have originated in Africa. There's the "Out of Africa" theory which I think is the most widely accepted. So that would mean they evolved in Africa and then migrated to other parts of the world.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: They migrated out of Africa into Southwest Asia between 150k and 100k years ago, then spread elsewhere. Hmm, that sounds plausible. The timing seems a bit off though. I thought the migration was a bit later, maybe around 70,000 years ago or so, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Evolved in Asia between 100k and 50k years ago. Wait, that doesn't fit with the Out of Africa theory. This would imply they originated in Asia, which I don't think is correct. So probably not B.

Option C: Migrated out of Asia into Africa? No, that's the opposite of what I remember. Modern humans are thought to have come from Africa, not gone into Africa from elsewhere. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Evolved in Africa between 100k and 50k years ago, then migrated. This fits with the Out of Africa model. The evolution part in Africa and then migration. I think this is a strong candidate.

Option E: Migrated out of Africa into Asia between 100k and 50k. That's a bit conflicting because I think the major migration was a bit later, but the idea is correct. But wait, the initial evolution is not mentioned here. The option says "migrated out of Africa", which would mean they evolved before that. So the timing here might not be the main issue, but let's compare with D.

Option F: Migrated out of Africa into western Europe 150k-200k years ago. That seems too early because I thought early migrations might have happened but the main successful ones were later. Plus, the initial evolution in Africa is around 200k years ago, so this might not fit.

Option G: Evolved independently in Africa, Europe, and Asia. No, that would be the multiregional hypothesis, which isn't the consensus. The consensus is a single origin in Africa, so G is out.

Option H: Evolved in Europe? That's not right. Europe was populated by other hominins like Neanderthals before modern humans arrived. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Migrated to North America 150-100k years ago. I thought the peopling of the Americas happened much later, like around 15,000-20,000 years ago. So I is probably wrong.

Option J: Evolved independently in multiple regions. Again, that's the multiregional idea which is not the consensus. So J is incorrect.

Now back to options A, D, and E. D says they evolved in Africa between 100k-50k and then migrated. Wait, when did anatomically modern humans evolve? I think the earliest fossils of H. sapiens are from around 300,000 years ago in Africa, like Jebel Irhoud in Morocco. So the evolution happened earlier than 100k years ago. So if D says evolved between 100k and 50k, that might not be accurate because the process started earlier.

So maybe D's timing is off. Let me think again. The consensus is that modern humans evolved in Africa, with fossils showing up around 300k years ago. Then, much later, around 70,000 years ago, there was a major migration out of Africa. Wait, but some sources say that there were earlier migrations, maybe around 120,000 years ago, but those might have been smaller or less successful.

So looking back at the options, option A says migration between 150k-100k, which is earlier than the commonly cited 70k. But option D is about evolution, not migration. So D says they evolved in Africa between 100k and 50k, which would be later than the actual evolutionary time.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the evolution and migration. So the question is about the migration. The consensus is that anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa in a significant wave, which is when the Out of Africa migration occurred.

So the options: A is migration out of Africa into SW Asia 150k-100k. D is about evolution in Africa 100k-50k, then migration.

So the question is about what is the consensus regarding anatomically modern humans. Do they say that modern humans evolved in Africa (earlier) and then migrated, or that they migrated first and then evolved elsewhere?

I think the correct sequence is that they evolved in Africa around 300k years ago, and then migrated out much later, around 70k years ago. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match that. So I have to pick the best fit.

Option A is migration between 150k-100k. That's earlier than the 70k I remember. But some sources might group this as part of the early migrations. Option D is about evolution between 100k-50k, which is later than the actual time.

Wait, perhaps the consensus is that they evolved in Africa around 200-100k years ago, and then migrated. So looking at option D, it says evolved between 100k and 50k, which is a bit later than some estimates. But perhaps the consensus includes that range.

Alternatively, option A talks about migration, not evolution. The question is about what the consensus is regarding their origin and migration.

So the question is phrased: "There is general consensus among paleoanthropologists that anatomically modern humans: ..."

So the correct answer would be that they evolved in Africa and then migrated. So option D says they evolved in Africa between 100k-50k years ago, and then migrated. But wait, if the evolution was earlier, maybe the option is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the migration happened around 70k years ago, which isn't exactly in any of the options. So I might have to pick the closest one.

Wait, option E says they migrated out of Africa into Asia between 100k and 50k, then spread elsewhere. That's a possibility, but the initial evolution isn't mentioned in E, but the question is about the general consensus, which includes both evolution and migration.

So I think the correct answer is D: evolved in Africa between 100k and 50k years ago, then migrated. But wait, earlier I thought that the evolution was around 300k, so maybe D is incorrect in the timing.

Alternatively, perhaps the consensus is that the migration happened around 60k-70k years ago, which would make option A's timeframe too early.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should recall that the most widely accepted model is the "Recent Out-of-Africa" model, which suggests that modern humans evolved in Africa around 200-300k years ago and migrated out around 70k years ago. But none of the options exactly say that.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Migration between 150k-100k, then spread.

Option D: Evolved in Africa 100k-50k, then migrated.

So which aligns with the consensus. The consensus is that they evolved in Africa, then migrated out. So the answer should include both: evolved in Africa, then migrated.

So option D includes the evolution and migration. Although the timing for evolution may be a bit off, it's closer than the others.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but E doesn't mention evolution, only migration.

The question is about what the consensus says. So the consensus is that they evolved in Africa and then migrated from there.

So among the options, D says they evolved in Africa between 100k and 50k, then migrated. But if the actual evolution was earlier, like around 200k, then D's timing is off. But perhaps the consensus includes that they evolved in that timeframe.

Wait, maybe the consensus is that they evolved around 200k years ago, but the options don't have that. Let me see.

Looking again, option A is about migration, not evolution. The question is about the general consensus, which includes both origin and migration.

So if D is about evolution between 100k-50k, then migration, that's one possibility. But I'm not sure if that's the exact consensus.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A. Because the consensus includes that after evolving in Africa, they migrated out around 150k-100k years ago.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall some key points. The earliest fossils of anatomically modern humans are from Africa, such as Omo I and II, which are around 195,000-160,000 years old. So the evolution is earlier than 100k years.

So if D says they evolved between 100k and 50k, that's a bit later than the actual time. So perhaps D is not correct.

But the migration is thought to have happened around 70,000 years ago, but earlier migrations might have occurred.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is A: migrated out between 150k and 100k, then spread. But that doesn't mention evolution, only migration.

The question is about the consensus on both their origin and migration. So the correct answer would include both.

Wait, the question is phrased as "anatomically modern humans: ..." So perhaps the consensus is that they evolved in Africa, then migrated. So the option that says they evolved in Africa and then migrated would be correct.

Looking at the options, D says they evolved in Africa between 100k and 50k years ago, then migrated. So that's the only option that mentions both evolving in Africa and migrating out. The other options either have the wrong continent or wrong direction.

But the timing in D might be off. Because the evolution started earlier, but maybe the consensus includes that the evolution as a process happened up to 100k years ago.

Alternatively, perhaps the consensus is that they evolved around 200k years ago, but none of the options mention that.

Wait, looking back, option A is about migration, but doesn't mention evolution. So the question is about what the consensus says, which includes both. So the correct answer should include both evolution in Africa and migration.

So the only option that mentions both is D. Because D says they evolved in Africa between 100k-50k, then migrated. So perhaps that's the intended correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but E only talks about migration.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option D: evolved in Africa between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, and then migrated into Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas.

Option A: migrated out of Africa into Southwest Asia between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago and then spread into Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas.

So D includes both evolution and migration. The consensus is that they evolved in Africa and then migrated.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The question asks about the general consensus among paleoanthropologists regarding anatomically modern humans, focusing on their origin and migration. The analysis of the options is as follows:

- **Option A**: Suggests migration out of Africa into Southwest Asia between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago, then spreading elsewhere. While this aligns with the "Out of Africa" migration, the timing (150k-100k years ago) is earlier than the widely accepted major migration event, which occurred around 70,000 years ago. Additionally, this option does not mention evolution, which is a key part of the consensus.

- **Option B**: Proposes that modern humans evolved in Asia between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, then migrated into Africa and other regions. This contradicts the widely accepted "Out of Africa" theory, which places the origin of anatomically modern humans in Africa, not Asia.

- **Option C**: Suggests migration out of Asia into Africa between 200,000 and 150,000 years ago, then spreading elsewhere. This is incorrect because modern humans are thought to have originated in Africa, not Asia, and migration into Africa from Asia does not align with the consensus.

- **Option D**: States that modern humans evolved in Africa between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, then migrated into Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. While the timing of evolution is slightly later than some estimates (fossils of anatomically modern humans in Africa date back to around 300,000 years ago), this option aligns most closely with the consensus that modern humans evolved in Africa and later migrated. It also addresses both evolution and migration, making it a strong candidate.

- **Option E**: Suggests migration out of Africa into Asia between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, then spreading elsewhere. While this partially aligns with the "Out of Africa" migration, it does not mention evolution, which is a critical part of the consensus.

- **Option F**: Proposes migration out of Africa into western Europe between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago, then spreading elsewhere. This is inconsistent with the timing of major migrations and the fact that Europe was not a primary destination during the initial "Out of Africa" migration.

- **Option G**: Suggests independent evolution in Africa, Europe, and Asia, then migration into Australia and the Americas. This aligns with the multiregional hypothesis, which is not the consensus. The consensus supports a single origin in Africa.

- **Option H**: Suggests evolution in Europe between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago, then migration into Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. This is incorrect because modern humans are not thought to have evolved in Europe.

- **Option I**: Suggests migration out of Africa into North America between 150,000 and 100,000 years ago, then spreading elsewhere. This is incorrect because the peopling of the Americas occurred much later, around 15,000-20,000 years ago.

- **Option J**: Suggests independent and simultaneous evolution in Africa, Europe, and Asia, then migration into Australia and the Americas. This is inconsistent with the consensus, which supports a single origin in Africa.

The consensus among paleoanthropologists is that anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa and later migrated to other parts of the world. While the exact timing of evolution and migration is debated, **Option D** best captures the essence of the consensus by stating that modern humans evolved in Africa and then migrated, even if the evolutionary timing is slightly off.

**Answer: D**
