Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric charges and forces. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about two charged particles in an xy plane. The charges are q1 = +3.0 μC and q2 = -4.0 μC. Their coordinates are given too: q1 is at (3.5 cm, 0.50 cm) and q2 is at (-2.0 cm, 1.5 cm). I need to find the magnitude of the electrostatic force on particle 2 due to particle 1.

Wait, Coulomb's Law is probably what I need here. Coulomb's Law says that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r², where k is Coulomb's constant. Right, and I remember k is about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, the problem is asking for the magnitude, so I don't need to worry about the direction, just the size of the force. Also, since the charges have opposite signs, the force will be attractive, but again, since we're only looking for magnitude, the sign doesn't matter here.

First, I think I need to find the distance between the two charges. The coordinates are given in centimeters, so I'll probably convert them to meters for consistency with the units in Coulomb's constant.

So, the coordinates of q1 are (3.5 cm, 0.50 cm), which is (0.035 m, 0.005 m). And q2 is at (-2.0 cm, 1.5 cm), so that's (-0.02 m, 0.015 m).

To find the distance between them, I can use the distance formula in two dimensions. The distance r is the square root of [(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]. Let me calculate that.

Calculating the differences first:

x2 - x1 = (-0.02) - (0.035) = -0.055 m
y2 - y1 = 0.015 - 0.005 = 0.010 m

Now, square these differences:

(-0.055)^2 = 0.003025
(0.010)^2 = 0.0001

Add them together: 0.003025 + 0.0001 = 0.003125

Take the square root of that sum to get r. So r = sqrt(0.003125). Let me compute that.

Hmm, sqrt(0.003125) is the same as sqrt(3.125e-3). Let me think, sqrt(3.125) is about 1.7678, but since it's 3.125e-3, the square root is approximately 0.0559 m. Alternatively, precise calculation: 0.003125 = 1/320. The square root of 1/320 is 1/sqrt(320) ≈ 1/17.8885 ≈ 0.0559 meters, yes.

So r is approximately 0.0559 meters.

Now, plug this into Coulomb's Law. The charges are 3.0 μC and -4.0 μC. But since we're taking the magnitude, the signs don't matter, so it's 3e-6 C * 4e-6 C = 12e-12 C².

Wait, actually, wait. The product is 3 * 4 = 12, so 12 * (μC)^2. Since 1 μC is 1e-6 C, so (1e-6)^2 = 1e-12. So 12e-12 C².

So F = k * (12e-12) / (r²).

Wait, let me write that out numerically.

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

r is 0.0559 m, so r squared is (0.0559)^2 = approximately 0.003121 m².

So plugging in the numbers:

F = 8.988e9 * (3e-6 * 4e-6) / (0.0559)^2.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute q1*q2: 3e-6 * 4e-6 = 12e-12 C².

Then, compute r squared: (0.0559 m)^2 ≈ 0.003121 m².

So F = (8.988e9) * (12e-12) / 0.003121.

Let me compute the numerator first: 8.988e9 * 12e-12 = (8.988 * 12) * (1e9 * 1e-12) = let me compute that.

8.988 * 12 ≈ 107.856. And 1e9 * 1e-12 is 1e-3. So 107.856e-3 = 0.107856.

So the numerator is 0.107856 N·m²/C² * C², but wait, actually, I think I'm mixing units. Let me be precise. The units for Coulomb's law: k has units N·m²/C², q is in C, so when you multiply k * q1*q2, the units are N·m²/C² * C * C = N·m². Then divide by r² (m²), so overall units are N, which is correct.

So numerator is 8.988e9 * 12e-12 = let me compute that more accurately.

8.988e9 is 8,988,000,000.

Multiply by 12e-12: 8,988,000,000 * 12 = 107,856,000,000, and 1e-12. So 107,856,000,000e-12 = 107,856e-3 = 107.856. So yes, the numerator is 107.856.

Wait, no, wait: 8.988e9 * 12e-12 = (8.988 *12) * 1e(9-12) ) = 107.856 * 1e-3 = 0.107856.

Then divide by r², which is 0.003121.

So F = 0.107856 / 0.003121.

Let me compute that division. 0.107856 ÷ 0.003121.

Hmm, approximately, 0.003121 is about 3.121e-3.

So 0.107856 / 0.003121 ≈ let's see. 0.003121 * 34.6 = about 0.1079 (since 34 * 0.003121 is 0.106, and 0.6 * 0.003121 is ~0.0019, so 0.106 + 0.0019 = 0.1079). So 34.6 is approximately the value.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.003121 multiplied by 34 equals 0.106. 0.003121 * 34.6 = 0.003121*(34 + 0.6) = 0.106114 + 0.0018726 = approximately 0.1079866. Which is very close to 0.107856. So 34.6 would give about 0.1079866, which is a little higher than 0.107856. So perhaps 34.5?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator-like approach.

Compute 0.107856 / 0.003121.

Let me write this as (107856e-6) / (3121e-6) ) = 107856 / 3121 ≈ let's compute that.

3121 * 34 is 106,  3121 * 34 = let's compute: 3000*34=102,000, 121*34= 4114, so total 102,000 + 4,114 = 106,114. Hmm, but 3121 *34 = 106,114.

But our numerator is 107,856. So 107,856 - 106,114 = 1,742. So 34 + (1,742 / 3121) = 34 + ~0.5578.

So approximately 34.5578.

So F ≈ 34.56 N.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go back.

Wait, the product 8.988e9 * 12e-12 is 8.988 * 12 * 1e-3. Because 1e9 * 1e-12 = 1e-3. So 8.988 *12=107.856, times 1e-3 gives 0.107856.

Yes, that's correct.

r is 0.0559 m, so r squared is 0.003121.

So F = 0.107856 / 0.003121.

So 0.107856 divided by 0.003121.

Let me compute this division.

Compute 0.107856 / 0.003121:

Let me write this as 107856e-6 / 3121e-6 = 107856 / 3121.

3121 times 34 is 3121 *30=93,630; 3121*4=12,484. Sum 93,630 +12,484= 106,114.

So 3121*34=106,114.

Subtracting from 107,856: 107,856 -106,114= 1,742.

Now, 3121 * 0.5 is 1,560.5. So 1,742 is more than that.

So 0.5 gives 1,560.5. 1,742 -1,560.5 =181.5.

Now, 3121 * 0.06 is approx 187.26, which is a bit more than 181.5. So approximately 0.58.

So total is 34.58.

So F ≈ 34.58 Newtons.

Looking at the options, the closest option is D:35 N, or perhaps G:28 N, H:22, etc. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:25 N

B:20

C:50

D:35

E:45

F:40

G:28

H:22

I:30

J:55.

So 34.58 is closest to 35, which is option D.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check the distance calculation.

Wait, the coordinates:

q1: x=3.5 cm =0.035 m; y=0.50 cm=0.005 m.

q2: x=-2.0 cm=-0.02 m; y=1.5 cm=0.015 m.

So difference in x: (-0.02 - 0.035) = (-0.055) m.

Difference in y: 0.015 -0.005 =0.010 m.

So dx= -0.055 m, dy=0.010 m.

So distance squared: (0.055)^2 + (0.010)^2 = 0.003025 + 0.0001 =0.003125 m².

So r= sqrt(0.003125)= approximately 0.0559017 m.

So that's correct.

Then, F= k * |q1 q2| / r².

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

q1*q2=3e-6 *4e-6=12e-12 C².

So F= (8.988e9) * (12e-12) / (0.003125).

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait, because r squared is (0.0559)^2 which is 0.0031216 m², but I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier when I said 0.0559^2 is 0.003125. Let me check that.

0.0559 squared:

0.05^2 =0.0025.

0.0059^2≈0.0000348.

Then cross terms: 2 *0.05 *0.0059=0.00059.

So total: 0.0025 + 0.00059 + 0.0000348≈0.0031248 ≈0.003125. So yes, 0.0559^2 is approximately 0.003125, but more accurately, 0.0031248.

So when I compute F, it's 8.988e9 * 12e-12 / 0.0031248.

Wait, 12e-12 is correct. Let me compute 8.988e9 *12e-12.

8.988e9 =8,988,000,000.

12e-12 is 0.000000000012.

But 8,988,000,000 * 12 = 107,856,000,000.

Multiply by 1e-12: 107,856,000,000e-12 =107.856e-3 =0.107856.

So that's correct.

Then, 0.107856 divided by 0.0031248.

Let me compute that.

0.107856 / 0.0031248 ≈ let me see.

Compute 0.0031248 * 34 = 0.10626.

Subtract that from 0.107856: 0.107856 -0.10626 =0.001596.

Now, 0.0031248 * 0.5 =0.0015624.

So 0.001596 -0.0015624=0.0000336.

So that's 34.5 plus a little bit, since 34.5 *0.0031248≈0.107696.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, 34.5 *0.0031248=34 *0.0031248 + 0.5 *0.0031248.

34 *0.0031248=0.1064152.

0.5 *0.0031248=0.0015624.

Sum: 0.1064152 +0.0015624=0.1079776.

But our numerator is 0.107856, which is less than 0.1079776. So 34.5 would be a bit too high.

So 0.107856 is 0.107856/0.0031248= approx 34.5 - (0.1079776-0.107856)/(0.0031248).

Wait, perhaps another approach: using a calculator.

But perhaps I should accept that the approximate value is about 34.5 N.

Wait, 34.5 is close to 34.5 N, but let me compute 0.107856 /0.0031248.

Compute 31248e-7 (since 0.0031248 m² is 31248e-7 m²).

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.107856 /0.0031248.

Let me write both numerator and denominator in scientific notation.

0.107856 is 1.07856e-1.

0.0031248 is 3.1248e-3.

So F = (1.07856e-1) / (3.1248e-3) = (1.07856 /3.1248) * (1e-1 /1e-3) )= (1.07856 /3.1248)*100.

Compute 1.07856 /3.1248.

Well, 3.1248 * 0.345 = approx 1.078. Because 3 *0.345=1.035, 0.1248 *0.345≈0.043. So 1.035+0.043=1.078.

So 0.345 *3.1248≈1.078.

So 1.07856 /3.1248≈0.345.

So F≈0.345 *100=34.5 N.

So approximately 34.5 N.

Looking at the options, the closest is D:35 N.

But wait, let me check if I made any error in the calculation of the distance. Because sometimes a small mistake there can change the result a lot.

Wait, the coordinates again: q1 at (3.5 cm, 0.5 cm) and q2 at (-2 cm, 1.5 cm).

So the differences are x2-x1=-2-3.5=-5.5 cm, which is -0.055 m. And y2 - y1=1.5-0.5=1.0 cm=0.010 m.

So yes, dx=-0.055 m, dy=0.010 m.

So distance squared is (0.055)^2 + (0.010)^2 = 0.003025 + 0.0001 = 0.003125 m². So r= sqrt(0.003125)=0.0559017 m.

So that's correct.

Another way to compute the force is:

F = (8.988e9) * (3e-6) * (4e-6) / (0.0559)^2.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 8.988e9 *3e-6 *4e-6 =8.988e9 *12e-12 = (8.988 *12) *1e-3 = 107.856 *1e-3=0.107856.

Denominator: (0.0559)^2=0.0031216.

So F=0.107856 /0.0031216 ≈34.56 N.

Which is approximately 34.56 N. So the closest option is D:35 N.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 35 N, which is very close.

Wait, but wait another thing: did I get the charges right? The question asks for the force on particle 2 due to particle 1. But since both are point charges, the force on 2 is the same in magnitude as the force on 1, so the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer should be approximately 34.56 N, which is closest to option D:35 N.

To solve the
