Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that Harry gets a 4% commission on all his sales. He sold $2,100 worth of goods last week, and we need to find out what his commission was. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, first, I remember that commission is like a percentage of the sales he makes. So, if he sells something, he gets a percentage of that amount as his earnings. In this case, it's 4%. So the formula I think I should use is Commission = Total Sales × Commission Rate.

Wait, let me make sure I'm remembering that correctly. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right. So the total sales here are $2,100, and the rate is 4%. So I need to calculate 4% of $2,100.

Hmm, how do I calculate percentages again? Oh right, to find a percentage of a number, you convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. So 4% becomes 0.04. Then I multiply that by $2,100.

Let me write that out: 0.04 × 2100. Let me do the math. 0.04 times 2000 is 80, because 0.04 × 2000 = 80. Then 0.04 times 100 is 4, so 0.04 × 2100 is 80 + 4 = 84. So his commission should be $84.

Wait, but let me check the options to see if $84 is there. Looking back, option E is $84. So that should be the answer.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. 4% is 0.04. 2100 × 0.04. Let me compute 2100 × 0.04 another way. 2100 divided by 100 is 21, and 21 × 4 is 84. Yeah, that matches. So I'm confident that the correct answer is E, $84.

The commission is calculated by multiplying the total sales by the commission rate. Harry's sales were $2,100, and his commission rate is 4%, which is 0.04 in decimal. 

So, 0.04 × $2,100 = $84.

The correct answer is E: $84.
