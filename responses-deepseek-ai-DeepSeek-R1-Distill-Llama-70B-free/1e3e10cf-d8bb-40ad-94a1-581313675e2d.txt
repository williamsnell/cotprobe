Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. If it's consistent, I need to choose an option that provides a consistent valuation.

The propositions given are:
1. D ≡ E
2. F ∨ D
3. ~E · ~F

I need to check if these can all be true at the same time. If they can, the set is consistent, and I'll look for an option that shows such a valuation. Otherwise, the set is inconsistent.

First, let's understand each proposition.

1. D ≡ E means that D and E must have the same truth value. So, if D is true, E is true, and if D is false, E is false.
2. F ∨ D is true if either F is true or D is true, or both. The only time this is false is when both F and D are false.
3. ~E · ~F is true only when both E is false and F is false. So, if either E or F is true, this proposition is false.

Now, I need to see if there's a way to assign truth values to D, E, F such that all three propositions are true.

Let me consider each option given to see which one fits. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to try to find a model where all three are true.

Let me start by assuming that all three propositions are true and see if that's possible.

From proposition 1, D ≡ E. So, D and E must be the same.

Now, look at proposition 3: ~E · ~F. For this to be true, E must be false, and F must be false. So, E is false, which from proposition 1 means D is also false.

Wait, but if D is false, then looking at proposition 2: F ∨ D must be true. But F is false (from proposition 3) and D is false, so F ∨ D would be false ∨ false = false. That's a problem because proposition 2 requires F ∨ D to be true. So this leads to a contradiction.

So, if proposition 3 is true, then E and F are false, which makes D false. But then proposition 2 (F∨D) would be false, which can't happen because we're assuming all propositions are true. So that's impossible.

Hmm, so that suggests that the set is inconsistent because we can't have all three propositions being true at the same time. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try assigning different truth values.

Another approach is to construct an indirect truth table. Let's see.

We can represent the set as:

1. D ≡ E
2. F ∨ D
3. ~E ∧ ~F

We can combine these into a formula and check for consistency. Alternatively, perhaps to check if the conjunction of these three is satisfiable.

Let me try to express the three propositions as a single formula and see if it's possible for them to all be true.

Let me denote the propositions as:

P1: D ≡ E
P2: F ∨ D
P3: ~E ∧ ~F

So, the conjunction P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3 must be satisfiable.

Let me write down the conditions:

From P1: D = E

From P3: ~E and ~F → E = false, F = false.

So, substituting E = false into P1, D must also be false.

Now, substituting D = false and F = false into P2: F∨D = false ∨ false = false. But P2 requires it to be true, so this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there's no way to assign truth values to D, E, F such that all three propositions are true. So the set is inconsistent.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider if that's the case. Let me check each option to see if any of them actually satisfy all three propositions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: D and E are true, F is true.

Check each proposition:

P1: D ≡ E → True ≡ True → True.

P2: F∨D → True∨True → True.

P3: ~E · ~F → ~True · ~True → False · False → False. So P3 is false here. So this valuation doesn't satisfy all three propositions.

So option A's valuation makes P3 false, so it's not a consistent valuation for the set. Therefore, the set isn't consistent, but the option claims it's consistent, so perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option B: Inconsistent. So according to our earlier analysis, the set is inconsistent, so B would be correct.

But let's check other options to make sure.

Option C: D is true, E false, F false.

P1: D ≡ E → True ≡ False → False. So P1 is false. So this valuation doesn't satisfy P1, so it's not a consistent valuation. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: E true, D and F false.

P1: D ≡ E → False ≡ True → False. So P1 is false. So this valuation doesn't satisfy P1. So D is incorrect.

Option E: D and E true, F false.

Check:

P1: True ≡ True → True.

P2: F∨D → False∨True → True.

P3: ~E · ~F → ~True · ~False → False · True → False. So P3 is false here. So this valuation doesn't satisfy all, so E is incorrect.

Option F: D and E false, F true.

P1: False ≡ False → True.

P2: F∨D → True∨False → True.

P3: ~E · ~F → True · ~True → True · False → False. So P3 is false. So F's valuation doesn't satisfy P3.

Option G: D true, E false, F true.

P1: True ≡ False → False. So P1 is false. So G's valuation is invalid.

Option H: D, E, F all true.

P1: True ≡ True → True.

P2: True ∨ True → True.

P3: ~True · ~True → False · False → False. So P3 is false. So H's valuation is invalid.

Option I: F true, D and E false.

P1: False ≡ False → True.

P2: F∨D → True ∨ False → True.

P3: ~E · ~F → True · ~True → True · False → False. So P3 is false. So I's valuation doesn't work.

Option J: D, E, F all false.

P1: False ≡ False → True.

P2: F∨D → False ∨ False → False. So P2 is false. So J's valuation doesn't work.

So, from this, none of the options A through J provide a valuation where all three propositions are true. Because every option either makes P3 false or some other proposition false.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that the set is inconsistent. So the correct answer would be option B: Inconsistent.

But let me re-examine. I might have missed something.

Wait, another approach: Let's try to find a model where all three are true.

From P3: ~E ∧ ~F. So E must be false, F must be false.

From P1: D ≡ E → D must be false (since E is false).

From P2: F∨D → F is false, D is false → False ∨ False = False. So P2 is false. So in this scenario, P2 is false. So no model can satisfy all three propositions.

Thus, the set is inconsistent. So the correct answer is option B: Inconsistent.

To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we analyze the given propositions:

1. **D ≡ E**: This means D and E must have the same truth value.  
2. **F ∨ D**: This is true if either F or D is true, or both. It is false only when both F and D are false.  
3. **~E · ~F**: This is true only when both E and F are false. If either E or F is true, this proposition is false.

### Analysis:
- From **~E · ~F**, for this proposition to be true, both E and F must be false.  
- From **D ≡ E**, if E is false, then D must also be false.  
- Substituting D = false and F = false into **F ∨ D**, we get **false ∨ false = false**. This contradicts **F ∨ D**, which must be true.  

Thus, there is no truth valuation for D, E, and F that satisfies all three propositions simultaneously. The set is therefore **inconsistent**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: D and E are true, F is true.  
  - P1: True, P2: True, P3: False. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option B**: Inconsistent.  
  - This is correct, as shown by the analysis above.  
- **Option C**: D is true, E and F are false.  
  - P1: False, P2: True, P3: True. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option D**: E is true, D and F are false.  
  - P1: False, P2: False, P3: False. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option E**: D and E are true, F is false.  
  - P1: True, P2: True, P3: False. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option F**: D and E are false, F is true.  
  - P1: True, P2: True, P3: False. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option G**: D is true, E is false, F is true.  
  - P1: False, P2: True, P3: False. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option H**: D, E, and F are all true.  
  - P1: True, P2: True, P3: False. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option I**: F is true, D and E are false.  
  - P1: True, P2: True, P3: False. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  
- **Option J**: D, E, and F are all false.  
  - P1: True, P2: False, P3: True. (Does not satisfy all propositions.)  

### Conclusion:
The set of propositions is inconsistent, as no truth valuation satisfies all three propositions simultaneously. The correct answer is **Option B**.
