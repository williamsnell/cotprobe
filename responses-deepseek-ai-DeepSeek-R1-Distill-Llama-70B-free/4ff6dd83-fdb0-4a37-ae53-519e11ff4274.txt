Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about speech codes and the principles they violated. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about critics of speech codes adopted in the 80s and early 90s. These codes were probably related to regulating speech in some way. I remember from my history classes that speech codes were often implemented on college campuses. They were supposed to prevent offensive or harassing speech, right? Like, to create a more inclusive environment.

But critics argued against them. Why? Well, the options are freedom of speech, freedom of the press, right to bear arms, and right to privacy. Right to bear arms doesn't seem related here. Freedom of the press is about the media, not individual speech on campuses. Privacy is about personal information, not really about what you can say.

So that leaves freedom of speech. The First Amendment protects that. Critics probably said that these codes were too broad and restricted people's ability to express themselves, even if the speech was offensive. They might have argued that while the intent was good, it ended up limiting free expression, which is a fundamental right.

Wait, I should make sure. The right to bear arms is the Second Amendment, and that's about weapons. Not relevant here. Freedom of the press is for publishing, not personal speech. Privacy is more about personal info and maybe things like search and seizure.

Yes, so the critics were likely concerned about the First Amendment, freedom of speech. So the answer should be A.

The critics of speech codes adopted in the 1980s and early 1990s primarily argued that these codes violated the principle of freedom of speech. These codes, often implemented on college campuses to prevent offensive or harassing speech, were criticized for being overly broad and restricting individuals' ability to express themselves, even if the speech was offensive. Critics contended that such codes infringed upon the First Amendment rights, which protect free expression, even when the speech is controversial or unpopular.
