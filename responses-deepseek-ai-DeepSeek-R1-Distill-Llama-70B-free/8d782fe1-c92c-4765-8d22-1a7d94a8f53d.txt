Okay, so I've got this question about free abelian groups and whether their statements about the number of bases are true or not. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what a free abelian group is. From what I remember, a free abelian group is an abelian group that has a basis, which is a set of elements such that every element of the group can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of basis elements with integer coefficients. So, for example, the integers under addition are a free abelian group of rank 1.

Now, the question has two statements:

Statement 1: Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.
Statement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.

I need to determine if each is true or false.

Let's start with Statement 1. If the group is nonzero, that means it has a rank of at least 1. For a rank 1 group, like Z, what are the bases? The basis is any single element that generates the group. For Z, any nonzero integer would generate it, but wait, actually no—wait, in Z, the only elements are integers. But the group is under addition, so the basis is a set of elements that can generate the group through integer linear combinations. For Z, a basis is any set containing just one element that is a generator. But the only generators of Z are 1 and -1 because any other integer would require multiples beyond 1 to reach all elements. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in Z, any non-zero integer can be a generator. Wait, no, actually, no. Because in Z, the subgroup generated by 2 would only include even integers, not the entire group. So the only generators of Z are 1 and -1. Therefore, Z has only two possible bases, each consisting of either {1} or {-1}. So the number of bases is finite for a rank 1 group.

But wait, the question is about nonzero free abelian groups. So if the group has rank 1, the number of bases is finite. Therefore, Statement 1 claims that every nonzero group has an infinite number of bases, which would be false because rank 1 groups only have two bases.

Wait, so Statement 1 is false because for rank 1, the number of bases is finite, specifically two. So Statement 1 is not true for all nonzero free abelian groups.

Now, looking at Statement 2: Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases. Hmm, I think this is true. Let me think about why.

In a free abelian group of rank n ≥ 2, the automorphism group is GL(n,Z), which is the group of invertible n×n integer matrices. Each automorphism corresponds to a change of basis. Since GL(n,Z) is infinite for n ≥ 2, that suggests that there are infinitely many bases.

Wait, but does each automorphism necessarily give a different basis? Or could some automorphisms lead to the same basis? I think that each invertible matrix represents a distinct basis because the basis elements are determined by where the standard basis vectors are sent. So, for example, in rank 2, you can swap the two basis elements, which gives a different basis. Also, you can scale them by ±1, or perform other row operations. Since there are infinitely many such transformations, like adding multiples of one basis element to another, there must be infinitely many bases.

So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. For example, take the rank 2 free abelian group Z^2. Its bases are sets of two elements that are linearly independent over Z. The automorphism group is GL(2,Z), which is the set of 2x2 integer matrices with determinant ±1. GL(2,Z) is known to be infinite because, for example, you can have matrices with 1s on the diagonal and any integer in the upper right (or lower left) corner, as long as the determinant is ±1. So the number of such matrices is infinite, which implies that the number of bases is infinite.

So Statement 2 is definitely true.

Putting it together:

Statement 1 is false because rank 1 groups have only two bases.

Statement 2 is true because for rank ≥2, there are infinitely many bases.

So the options given are:

A: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is not applicable.

B: True, True.

C: False, False.

D: Statement 1 is not applicable, Statement 2 is true.

E: Both not applicable.

F: True, False.

G: False, True.

H: Sometimes true, Statement 2 false.

I: Both sometimes true.

J: Statement 1 false, Statement 2 sometimes true.

Wait, in the options, looking for Statement 1 False and Statement 2 True. So looking at the options, option G is False, True.

Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Option G: False, True.

Yes, that's correct because Statement 1 is false (since rank 1 has finite bases), and Statement 2 is true (rank ≥2 has infinite bases).

So the correct answer would be option G.

To determine the validity of the statements about free abelian groups, let us analyze each one carefully:

1. **Statement 1**: "Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases."  
   A nonzero free abelian group has a rank of at least 1. For a rank 1 group, such as $\mathbb{Z}$, the bases are limited to the sets $\{1\}$ and $\{-1\}$. This means there are only two possible bases, which is a finite number. Therefore, Statement 1 is false because it does not hold for rank 1 groups.

2. **Statement 2**: "Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases."  
   For a free abelian group of rank $n \geq 2$, the automorphism group is $GL(n, \mathbb{Z})$, which is infinite. Each automorphism corresponds to a distinct basis, as the basis elements are determined by the action of the automorphism on the group. Since $GL(n, \mathbb{Z})$ is infinite, there are infinitely many bases. Thus, Statement 2 is true.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, not true.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, so both cannot be true.  
- **C**: Incorrect. Statement 2 is true, so both cannot be false.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, not "not applicable."  
- **E**: Incorrect. Both statements are applicable, and Statement 2 is true.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, but Statement 2 is true, not false.  
- **G**: Correct. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, not "sometimes true," and Statement 2 is true, not false.  
- **I**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, not "sometimes true," and Statement 2 is true, not "sometimes true."  
- **J**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, but Statement 2 is true, not "sometimes true."

Thus, the correct answer is **G: False, True**.
