Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters. I have read…the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground…"

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Puritan emigration from England between 1649 and 1660. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking why Puritan emigration nearly stopped during those years. The options are from A to J. Let me start by recalling what I know about this period.

First, I remember that the Puritans were a group in England who wanted to reform the Church of England. They were active in the 17th century and many of them migrated to America, especially to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, in what's known as the Great Migration. That was mainly in the 1630s, I think.

The years 1649 to 1660—wait, what was happening in England then? Oh right, the English Civil War took place in the mid-17th century. The war was between the Royalists (Cavaliers) supporting King Charles I and the Parliamentarians (Roundheads), who were largely Puritans. I think the civil war ended with the execution of Charles I in 1649, and then Oliver Cromwell came to power. So from 1649 onwards, Cromwell's Commonwealth period began.

If the Puritans were in control of the government after 1649, why would they leave England? They were probably busy consolidating their power and implementing their religious reforms. So maybe during this time, they didn't feel the need to emigrate because they were in charge.

Looking at the options, option C says "the Puritans controlled the English government." That makes sense because after the civil war, the Commonwealth was led by Cromwell, a Puritan. So if they were in power, they wouldn't need to leave England. That would explain why emigration to New England slowed down.

Other options don't seem as likely. Option A: Puritans converting to Catholicism? That doesn't fit; they were Protestants, and the Church of England was Anglican, so I don't think they'd convert to Catholicism. Plus, that would be a big shift.

Option B suggests overcrowding and legislatures discouraging immigration. I'm not sure about the overcrowding part. The New England colonies were growing, but I don't recall any specific policies against immigration during this time. It was more about why people wouldn't leave England.

Option D is disease outbreak. There were diseases in the colonies, but I don't think there was a severe outbreak specifically in those years that would halt immigration. Maybe earlier or later, but not sure.

Option E: Puritans imprisoned for heresy. But if they were in control, they wouldn't be imprisoned. This might have happened before the civil war when they were opposing the monarchy and the Church.

Option F: Puritans fleeing to Europe. No, because they were in power in England, so they wouldn't need to flee. Plus, the question is about why emigration to America stopped, not why they went elsewhere.

Option G: English government banned emigration. But if the Puritans were in charge, would they ban their own emigration? That doesn't make sense. They might have encouraged it, but maybe not necessarily.

Option H: Puritans engaged in civil war. Well, the main civil war ended in 1646, but after that, there were some uprisings, but by 1649, the Commonwealth was established. So perhaps the initial civil war years were before 1649, and during 1649-1660 they were more in power.

Option I: Native American attacks. I don't think there were major destructions of settlements during those specific years. Maybe earlier, like the Pequot War in 1636-1638, but not in the late 1640s to 1660.

Option J: Incentives to stay in England. That could make sense, but if they controlled the government, the incentive would be that they were already in power and didn't need to leave.

So putting it all together, the most plausible answer is C: the Puritans controlled the English government. They were busy running the country, so emigration to New England slowed down because they didn't feel the need to escape persecution anymore.

The Puritan emigration from England to New England slowed significantly between 1649 and 1660 because the Puritans had gained control of the English government following the English Civil War. With Oliver Cromwell, a Puritan, leading the Commonwealth, they no longer felt the need to flee England for religious freedom. This control over the government aligns with option C as the correct answer.

Answer: C
