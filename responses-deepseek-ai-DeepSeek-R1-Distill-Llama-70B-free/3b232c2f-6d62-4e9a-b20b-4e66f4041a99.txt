Question:

As a legislative aide to a U. S. Senator you are called upon to provide an analysis of the constitutionality of a bill pending congressional approval. The bill imposes a 15% tax upon the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices. The bill has the strong support of conservative and pro-life organizations. The stated purpose of the proposed measure is to raise revenue and spur population growth across the country. In your learned opinion, the proposed tax is probably

Options:

A: constitutional, because the fact that the tax applies to all sales of every type of birth control device invalidates any possible objection to the tax on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: unconstitutional, because it infringes on the rights of businesses to operate freely in the market.
C: unconstitutional, because it unfairly targets a specific industry, which violates the principle of fair trade.
D: unconstitutional, because in inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases and sales of birth control devices affect interstate and foreign commerce.
E: unconstitutional, because it may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who rely on these devices for family planning.
F: constitutional, because the tax applies universally to all forms of birth control devices, and thus does not single out any particular group or entity for discrimination.
G: constitutional, because it is within the government's rights to levy taxes to generate revenue, regardless of the potential social implications.
H: unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.
I: constitutional, because the government has the power to tax as a means of controlling population growth.
J: constitutional, because the fact that controversial policy motives may have induced the enactment of an otherwise reasonable measure calculated to raise revenue does not ipso facto invalidate the tax.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this proposed tax on birth control devices is constitutional. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the bill imposes a 15% tax on the gross annual receipts from sales of all birth control devices. The supporters are conservative and pro-life groups, and the purpose is to raise revenue and increase population. Hmm, so the tax is on businesses that sell these devices, not directly on the users, but it might affect the users by increasing prices.

I remember that the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax for the general welfare. So, the government can levy taxes as long as they're within their authority. But I also know that taxes can't violate other constitutional principles, like equal protection or substantive due process.

Looking at the options, some say it's constitutional because it's a universal tax. Option F says it applies to all forms, so no discrimination. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Wait, there was a Supreme Court case about this. In the 1990s, there was a case called United States v. Lopez, but that was about the Commerce Clause and guns in schools. Then there's the more recent case about the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate. Oh, right, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the Court held that requiring certain businesses to cover contraception violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But this is a tax, not a mandate.

Another relevant case might be Griswold v. Connecticut, which established a right to privacy, including the use of contraceptives. So if the tax burdens this right, it might be problematic.

So the tax here is on the sales of all birth control devices. It's a broad tax, but does it infringe on a fundamental right? If the government is imposing a tax that makes it harder for people to afford birth control, that could be seen as burdening their right to privacy. Under the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment, the government can't place an undue burden on a fundamental right unless there's a compelling state interest.

The stated purpose here is to raise revenue and increase population. But if the effect is to make birth control less accessible, especially to low-income individuals, that might be an issue. The tax would likely increase the cost for consumers, which could disproportionately affect those with fewer resources.

Option H says it's unconstitutional because it burdens the fundamental right to privacy without a compelling interest. That sounds plausible. Also, Option E mentions it affects lower-income individuals, which relates to equal protection. But I think the right to privacy is a more direct issue here.

Wait, but the tax is on the businesses, not the individuals. Does that matter? The Court has held that taxing a business doesn't necessarily violate individual rights, but if the tax is intended to discourage the use of a protected service, it might. Like in the case of a tax on abortion services, which could be seen as infringing on the right to choose.

So, in this case, the tax is on all sales, which makes it more about the products rather than targeting a specific group. But the intent behind the tax is to influence population growth, which suggests it's targeting the use of birth control.

I'm also thinking about whether this tax would be considered a direct tax that needs to be apportioned, but I don't think that's the issue here. The main issue is probably the burden on a fundamental right.

So putting it together, the tax is likely unconstitutional because it burdens the fundamental right to privacy without a compelling state interest. So the correct answer would be H.

The proposed tax on birth control devices raises significant constitutional concerns, particularly regarding its impact on fundamental rights. The bill imposes a 15% tax on the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices, with the stated purpose of raising revenue and spurring population growth. While Congress has broad taxing authority under the Constitution, this tax may infringe on the fundamental right to privacy, as established in cases like *Griswold v. Connecticut*. This right protects individuals' access to contraceptives, and a tax that increases the cost of these devices could disproportionately affect low-income individuals and unduly burden their ability to exercise this right. Furthermore, the tax appears to target a specific industry and may not survive scrutiny under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it is seen as imposing an undue burden on a fundamental right without a compelling state interest. Therefore, the tax is likely unconstitutional because it burdens the fundamental right to privacy without establishing a compelling national interest.
