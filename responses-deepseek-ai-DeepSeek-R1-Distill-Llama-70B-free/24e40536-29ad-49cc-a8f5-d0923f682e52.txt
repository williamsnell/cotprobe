Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about translating the English sentence "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter" into predicate logic. The given symbols are e for Earth, j for Jupiter, and Bxy meaning "x is bigger than y". The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to understand the original statement clearly. The sentence is saying that Earth is not bigger than Jupiter. So, in terms of logic, this is a negation of the statement "Earth is bigger than Jupiter".

Let me recall how predicate logic works. The predicate Bxy is a binary predicate where x is the subject and y is the object. So Bxy would be read as "x is bigger than y". 

So, if I were to write "Earth is bigger than Jupiter", that would be Bej, because e is Earth, j is Jupiter, and B is the bigger than relation. So Bej means Earth (e) is bigger than Jupiter (j).

But the original statement is the negation of that. So I need to negate Bej. In logic, the negation of a predicate is done by putting a tilde (~) in front of it. So the negation would be ~Bej.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of the structure. The sentence is "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter", which is the same as "It is not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter". So in symbols, that's ¬(e > j), which in the given notation is ¬(Bej), so ~Bej.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches ~Bej. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: j~Be. Hmm, that looks like it's saying Jupiter is not bigger than Earth, but that's not what the original statement is saying. The original is about Earth not being bigger than Jupiter, so this might be the converse.

Option B: Be~j. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. The ~ is after B, so maybe it's saying B(e, ~j), but that would mean e is bigger than not j, which doesn't fit here. Plus, j is a constant, so I think this is incorrect.

Option C: Bej. That's just the positive statement, without any negation. So that's "Earth is bigger than Jupiter", which is the opposite of what we want.

Option D: ~eBj. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. It looks like e is negated, so maybe it's saying "not Earth is bigger than Jupiter". But in logic, the negation applies to the entire proposition. So I don't think this is correct because it's not clear how the negation is applied here. It might be misplacing the negation.

Option E: ~Bej. Oh, this looks right. The negation is applied to the entire B(e,j), so it's saying "it is not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter", which matches the original statement.

Option F: e~Bj. Wait, this would mean Earth is not bigger than Jupiter? No, wait, the way it's written is e~Bj. But in predicate logic, the predicate B takes two arguments, so it should be B(e,j). If there's a ~ before B, that would mean "Earth is ~Bigger than Jupiter", but that's not standard notation. So I think this is incorrect.

Option G: ~Bje. This would mean "it is not the case that B(j,e)", which is "Jupiter isn't bigger than Earth". But that's the opposite of what we want. The original statement is about Earth not being bigger than Jupiter, not Jupiter not being bigger than Earth.

Option H: B~ej. This seems to suggest that the bigger than relation holds between ~e and j, which doesn't make sense because ~e would mean "not Earth", which isn't an entity here. So this is incorrect.

Option I: ~jBe. This looks like it's saying "Jupiter is not bigger than Earth", which is the same as option A. Again, not what we're looking for.

Option J: Bje~. This seems like it's adding a tilde at the end, which doesn't make sense in this context. The syntax is incorrect here.

So after going through all the options, option E: ~Bej is the correct translation. It correctly negates the entire predicate B(e,j), which matches the original statement.

The question requires translating the sentence "Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter" into predicate logic using the given symbols: \( e \) for Earth, \( j \) for Jupiter, and \( Bxy \) for "x is bigger than y." 

The original statement is a negation of "Earth is bigger than Jupiter," which would be written as \( Bej \) in predicate logic. To negate this, the tilde (\( \sim \)) is placed before the predicate, resulting in \( \sim Bej \).

Analyzing the options:

- **A: \( j \sim Be \)**: This suggests "Jupiter is not bigger than Earth," which is not the intended meaning.
- **B: \( Be \sim j \)**: This is syntactically incorrect, as the negation is misplaced.
- **C: \( Bej \)**: This represents "Earth is bigger than Jupiter," the opposite of the intended statement.
- **D: \( \sim eBj \)**: This is unclear and does not correctly represent the negation of the entire predicate.
- **E: \( \sim Bej \)**: This correctly represents "Earth is not bigger than Jupiter," matching the original statement.
- **F: \( e \sim Bj \)**: This is syntactically incorrect, as the negation is misplaced.
- **G: \( \sim Bje \)**: This represents "Jupiter is not bigger than Earth," which is the converse of the intended statement.
- **H: \( B \sim ej \)**: This is syntactically incorrect, as it introduces an invalid negation.
- **I: \( \sim jBe \)**: This is equivalent to option A and does not match the intended meaning.
- **J: \( Bje \sim \)**: This is syntactically incorrect, as the tilde is misplaced.

The correct translation is **E: \( \sim Bej \)**, as it accurately negates the predicate "Earth is bigger than Jupiter."

Answer: E
