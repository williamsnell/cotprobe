Question:

A professional football player was seriously injured when the football helmet he was wearing shattered as he was being tackled during a game. The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.
B: admissible as an admission.
C: inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.
D: admissible as evidence that the manufacturer knew the helmet was defective.
E: admissible, because the former employee has firsthand knowledge of the manufacturer's actions.
F: inadmissible, because the testimony is prejudicial to the manufacturer.
G: admissible as direct evidence that the player's injury was caused by the defective design of the football helmet.
H: inadmissible, because the testimony is hearsay.
I: inadmissible, because the testimony is irrelevant to the case.
J: admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with admissibility of testimony in a civil trial. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a professional football player was seriously injured when his helmet shattered during a tackle. He's suing the manufacturer. At trial, his attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify about something that happened three weeks after the injury. The testimony is that the manufacturer came up with a new helmet design.

The question is whether this testimony is admissible and under what grounds.

First, I remember that evidence law has certain rules about subsequent remedial measures. Like, if someone takes a safety measure after an event, that can't be used to prove negligence. I think it's Federal Rule of Evidence 407 that deals with this. So, if the manufacturer changed the design after the injury, that might be considered a subsequent remedial measure.

Wait, but Rule 407 says that evidence of measures taken after an event isn't admissible to prove negligence or defect, but it can be used for other purposes. So, maybe the testimony isn't admissible to show that the helmet was defective, but perhaps for another reason, like to show ownership of the design or something else.

Looking at the options, option I says it's inadmissible because it's irrelevant. If the testimony is about a subsequent design change, under 407, it's inadmissible to prove the helmet was defective. But is it irrelevant? Or does it have some other relevance? Alternatively, maybe it's hearsay. Let me think about that.

The former employee is testifying about the manufacturer's action. If the employee is testifying based on their personal knowledge, it's not hearsay. But if they're recounting something someone else said, then it might be hearsay. But the question doesn't specify the exact testimony, just that they devised a new design. So if the former employee was part of the team that did it, then it's their personal knowledge and not hearsay. So H (inadmissible as hearsay) might not be correct.

Option D says admissible as evidence that the manufacturer knew the helmet was defective. But under 407, that's exactly the kind of thing that's prohibited. Because it's using the subsequent design change to show they knew it was defective. So D would be incorrect.

Option J says it's admissible as circumstantial evidence that the injury was due to the defective design. But again, if the rule prohibits using subsequent measures to prove defect or negligence, then J would be incorrect.

Option C says it's inadmissible because of public policy on safety precautions. I think that's the rationale behind Rule 407. The idea is that if you penalize people for taking safety measures after an incident, they might not do it. So the public policy is to encourage such measures without fear they'll be used against them in court.

So the correct reason for inadmissibility would be under Rule 407, making the evidence inadmissible to prove negligence or defect. So the testimony is irrelevant for that purpose, or perhaps excluded under the rule.

Wait, but the question is about whether the testimony is admissible at all. So the options are about the admissibility. So if the testimony is about a subsequent design change, it's not admissible to prove the helmet was defective, but maybe it's admissible for another purpose, like the manufacturer's ownership of the design or something else. But in this case, the player is trying to prove the helmet was defective, so the testimony's purpose is to show that the manufacturer knew it was defective and thus changed the design. That's the prohibited use under 407.

So the correct reasoning would be that the testimony is inadmissible because it's a subsequent remedial measure, making it irrelevant for the purpose of proving negligence or defect. So looking at the options, option I says it's inadmissible because it's irrelevant. Option C says it's inadmissible because of public policy. Hmm.

Wait, the options: option I is about irrelevance. Option C is about public policy. So under Rule 407, the evidence is inadmissible to prove negligence or defect, but it's not necessarily irrelevant. It's excluded under a specific rule, not because it's irrelevant. So the reasoning is more about the rule against using subsequent measures, which is a public policy consideration.

So option C: inadmissible because of public policy behind taking safety precautions. That makes sense because the rule is based on public policy to encourage remedial measures without fear of legal repercussions.

Alternatively, option I says it's irrelevant. But the testimony isn't irrelevant; it's relevant but inadmissible under the rule. So the correct reason is public policy, making option C correct.

Wait, but another thought: the testimony might be hearsay. If the former employee is testifying about the manufacturer's action, is that hearsay? Not if they have personal knowledge. So if the employee was involved in the design change, their testimony is not hearsay.

So the issue isn't hearsay, it's the subsequent remedial measure. So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony regarding a manufacturer's subsequent design change after a football player's injury. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible to prove the helmet was defective or if it is excluded under specific evidence rules.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 407, evidence of subsequent remedial measures (like a new design) is generally inadmissible to prove negligence, culpable conduct, or a defect. This rule is based on public policy, which encourages parties to take safety precautions without fear that such measures will be used against them in court. The testimony here seeks to link the design change to the manufacturer's alleged knowledge of a defect, which is the type of use prohibited by Rule 407.

Analyzing the options:
- **A, E, F, G, H, J**: These options are incorrect because they either misapply the rules of evidence or fail to address the central issue of subsequent remedial measures.
- **D**: Incorrect because the testimony cannot be used to prove the manufacturer knew the helmet was defective, as this is barred by Rule 407.
- **I**: Incorrect because the testimony is not irrelevant; it is relevant but inadmissible under Rule 407.
- **C**: Correct because the testimony is inadmissible due to the public policy underlying Rule 407, which prohibits using subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence or defect.

Thus, the testimony is inadmissible because of the public policy behind encouraging safety precautions without legal repercussions.

**Answer: C**
