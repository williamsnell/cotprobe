Okay, so I've got this problem here about designing a square key for a shaft. The shaft is 3 inches in diameter, and it needs to withstand a torque of 30,000 lbs.-in. The allowable stresses are 11,000 psi for shear and 22,000 psi for bearing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on machine design, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that keys are used to transmit torque between a shaft and a hub. The key is usually a square or rectangular piece that fits into a keyseat in both the shaft and the hub. The torque is transmitted through shear in the key and bearing pressure against the sides of the keyseat.

Wait, the formula for torque is related to the shear stress and the area. I think the torque is equal to the shear stress multiplied by the area of the key, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Oh right, the torque (T) is the shear stress (τ) multiplied by the area (A) divided by some factor. Or maybe I should think about the polar moment of inertia, but that's more for torsion in shafts. No, wait, for a key, the shear area is what's important.

Let me clarify. The key is held in place by friction and the shear strength of the key material. But maybe each face of the key contributes. Oh, right, when the torque is applied, one side of the key is sheared while the other is in bearing. So the shear stress would be on the area of the key's cross-section, and the bearing stress would be on the projected area against the shaft.

Wait, I think I need to calculate the required dimensions of the key. Let's start by considering the shear stress. The maximum shear stress in the key should not exceed the allowable stress. So the formula I remember is T = τ * A, where T is the torque, τ is the shear stress, and A is the area. Wait, but wait, no, maybe it's T = (τ) * (width × length). Because the key is a square key, so the width and length would be the same if it's square. Or wait, in a square key, the width is the same as the thickness? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the torque is transmitted by the key through two shear planes. So the area in shear would be twice the area of the key (since both sides are shearing), but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the approach is to calculate the required dimensions using both the shear and bearing stress conditions and then pick the most restrictive condition.

Let's define the variables:
- Shaft diameter (D) = 3 inches.
- The key is square, so its width (w) and thickness (t) are equal. Wait, no, wait. In a square key, the width and the thickness are the same? Or are they different? Wait no, for a square key, the cross-section is a square, so width (which is the length along the shaft) and thickness (the depth in the keyseat) are the same. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Wait, in a square key, the cross-section is square, so the width (which is the length along the shaft) and the thickness (the height of the key) are equal. Or perhaps not, maybe the key's width is the length along the shaft, and the thickness is the depth into the shaft.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. For a square key, the cross-sectional dimensions are width (w) and thickness (t). But in a square key, the width and thickness are equal, so w = t. Is that correct? Or is that for a square key, the key is square in cross-section, so perhaps the width would be the length along the shaft, and the thickness is the height. But maybe for a square key, width and thickness are the same. I think that's right because a square key has equal width and thickness, so w = t.

Wait no, perhaps not. The square key's cross-section is a square, so the width (which is the length along the shaft) and the height (thickness) are the same. So in that case, w = t. So for square key, the width and thickness are the same.

But wait, maybe the key's width is the length along the shaft, and the height is the thickness. So for a square key, the width and height are the same, so w = t.

So the area of the key in shear would be the width times the length, but wait, the length is how long the key is. Wait, maybe the key's length (L) is the other dimension. So a square key has a cross-section of w (width) x t (thickness), but since it's square, w = t. Then the length (L) is along the shaft. Wait, but in that case, perhaps I'm mixing terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is a rectangular prism with length L (along the shaft), width W (across the shaft), and thickness t (radially into the shaft). But if it's a square key, then W = t. So W and t are the same.

Wait, perhaps the key has a width and a length. The width being the dimension across the shaft's diameter, and the length being the dimension along the shaft. So for a square key, the width and the length are the same. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps in a square key, the cross-sectional dimensions are square, so the width (along the shaft) and the height (across the shaft) are equal. So for a 3-inch diameter shaft, the keyseat depth is such that the key's height (t) plus twice the radius equals the shaft diameter. Wait, not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, the torque is 30,000 lb-in. The allowable shear stress is 11,000 psi, and allowable bearing stress is 22,000 psi.

I think for a square key, the design should satisfy both the shear and bearing stress conditions.

Let me recall the formulas.

For shear stress:

The torque T is related to the shear stress τ by T = τ * A * n, where A is the area of the key's cross-section, and n is the number of shear planes. Wait, no, perhaps T = (τ * A) * 2, because for a key, the shear occurs on both the top and bottom, so two shear planes.

Wait, no, perhaps it's T = τ * (w * L), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the area in shear is the width times the length, and since the key is in double shear (both sides), the area would be 2 * w * L.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Alternatively, the shear stress in the key is given by τ = T / (A * n), where n is the number of shear planes. For a key, the shear occurs on both ends, so n=2. So τ = T / (2 * A). Wait, but A is the cross-sectional area of the key.

Wait, perhaps τ = T / (2 * (w * t)), where w is the width and t is the thickness of the key. But since it's a square key, w = t, so τ = T / (2 * w²).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that the key is in double shear, so the area is 2 * (w * L), where w is the width and L is the length. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the area in shear is the same as the cross-sectional area, but multiplied by the number of shear planes.

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Let's try to find the correct approach.

I found in some notes that for a square key, the shear stress is given by τ = (4T)/(π D³), but that might be for a shaft without a key. No, wait, that's the formula for the shear stress in a solid shaft. So that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps for a key, the shear area is the width of the key multiplied by the length. So τ = T / (A_shear), where A_shear is the area in shear. But for a key, the shear occurs on the two sides, so maybe A_shear = 2 * (w * t). But in a square key, w = t, so A_shear = 2 w². So τ = T / (2 w²).

But the allowable τ is 11,000 psi, so:

11,000 = 30,000 / (2 w²)

Solving for w:

w² = 30,000 / (2 * 11,000) = 30000 / 22000 ≈ 1.3636

w ≈ sqrt(1.3636) ≈ 1.17 inches.

Wait, that can't be right because the shaft is only 3 inches in diameter, and the key's width can't be larger than the shaft's radius, which is 1.5 inches. So 1.17 inches seems possible.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me redo that.

Rearranging the equation: w² = T / (2 τ) → 30,000 / (2 * 11,000) = 30000 / 22000 ≈ 1.3636. So w = sqrt(1.3636) ≈ 1.17 inches. That's about 1.1667 inches, which is 7/6 inches or approximately 1.1667 inches.

But wait, the key's width (w) is the same as its thickness in a square key. Wait, no, perhaps in a square key, the width (along the shaft) is the same as the length of the key. Or maybe I'm mixing terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is designed such that the width (w) is the same as the thickness (t), making it square. So the cross-section is a square of w by t, but since w = t, it's a square.

So perhaps the area in shear is 2 * w * t, but since w = t, that's 2 w². So the calculation I did gives w ≈ 1.17 inches.

But then, the bearing stress comes into play. The bearing stress (σ) is given by σ = T / (A_bearing), where A_bearing is the area in bearing. For a key, this area is the width of the key multiplied by the length of the key. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the bearing area is the projection of the key against the shaft. So the area is the width of the key (w) times the length of the key (L). So σ = T / (w * L).

But wait, the allowable bearing stress is 22,000 psi, so:

22,000 = 30,000 / (w * L)

So, w * L = 30,000 / 22,000 ≈ 1.3636 square inches.

But from the shear stress calculation, w ≈ 1.17 inches. Let's plug that in.

So L = 1.3636 / 1.17 ≈ 1.166 inches.

Wait, but that would make the length of the key about 1.166 inches, but that's shorter than the shaft's diameter. That seems possible, but let me check the math again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem by considering both the shear and bearing stress to find the minimum key dimensions.

Wait, let me think differently. The key must satisfy both the shear and bearing stress conditions. So we'll need to compute the necessary dimensions such that both stresses are within allowable limits.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Assume the key is square, so width (w) = thickness (t).

2. The shear stress is given by τ = T / (2 * w²) because the area in shear is 2 * w² (since there are two shear planes, each w × L, but wait, no. Wait, the area in shear is the cross-section area times the number of shear planes. But perhaps for a key, the shear area is 2 * (w * L), but since it's a square key, maybe L is the same as the shaft's length, but that doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should model this correctly. The key is a square, so width (w) and thickness (t) are equal. The key is fitted into a keyseat in the shaft and the hub. The torque is transmitted through the key.

In shear, the key is stressed on both the top and bottom faces, so the shear area is 2 * (w * L), where L is the length of the key along the shaft. So the shear stress τ = T / (2 * w * L).

Wait, but that would be the case if the shear area is 2 * w * L. So τ = T / (2 w L).

Similarly, the bearing stress is on the sides of the key. The bearing area is w * L, so σ = T / (w L).

Wait, but that would make τ = 2 σ, because τ = T/(2 w L) and σ = T/(w L), so τ would be half of σ.

But in the problem, the allowable shear stress is 11,000 psi and allowable bearing stress is 22,000 psi. So τ_max = 11,000 psi, σ_max = 22,000 psi.

So according to the formulas:

τ = T / (2 w L) = 30,000 / (2 w L) = 15,000 / (w L).

And this must be ≤ 11,000 psi.

Similarly, σ = T / (w L) = 30,000 / (w L) ≤ 22,000 psi.

Wait, but wait, if τ = 15,000/(w L) ≤ 11,000 → 15,000/(w L) ≤ 11,000 → w L ≥ 15,000/11,000 ≈ 1.3636 in².

And from bearing stress, 30,000/(w L) ≤ 22,000 → w L ≥ 30,000/22,000 ≈ 1.3636 in².

Wait a minute, both conditions give the same equation: w L ≥ approximately 1.3636 in².

So in this case, the two conditions give the same requirement. So the minimum area (w L) must be 1.3636 in².

But since the key is square, perhaps the width (w) is the same as the length (L)? Or wait, no, the key's length (L) is along the shaft, and the width (w) is the depth. But for a square key, the width and thickness are the same, but what about the length?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the key's dimensions. Let me think again. The key is a square in cross-section, so the width (w) and thickness (t) are the same. The length (L) is the dimension along the shaft. So the cross-section is a square with sides w = t, and the length L can be longer.

Wait, but in this problem, when they say 'square key', do they mean that the cross-section is square, so w = t, but the length L can vary? Or does 'square' refer to all three dimensions being equal, making it a cube? That can't be, because the key would have to fit in the shaft's keyseat, which is along the length.

So probably, 'square key' refers to a square cross-section, with w = t, but L is the length along the shaft and can be different.

So, in that case, the area for shear is 2 * w * L (since there are two shear planes, each of area w * L).

Wait, no, perhaps the shear area is the same as the cross-sectional area, which is w * t, but since w = t, it's w². But in shear, the stress is based on the area, and since the key is in double shear, the area is 2 * w².

So the shear stress τ = T / (2 w²) = 30,000 / (2 w²) = 15,000 / w².

This must be ≤ 11,000 psi:

15,000 / w² ≤ 11,000 → w² ≥ 15,000/11,000 ≈ 1.3636 → w ≥ sqrt(1.3636) ≈ 1.1667 inches.

Now, for the bearing stress, the area is w * L, so σ = T / (w L) = 30,000 / (w L).

This must be ≤ 22,000 psi:

30,000 / (w L) ≤ 22,000 → w L ≥ 30,000 / 22,000 ≈ 1.3636 in².

So now, from shear stress, w ≈ 1.1667 inches. Let's plug this into the bearing equation:

w L ≥ 1.3636 → 1.1667 * L ≥ 1.3636 → L ≥ 1.3636 / 1.1667 ≈ 1.169 inches.

So the length L must be at least approximately 1.169 inches.

But wait, the shaft is 3 inches in diameter, so the key must fit in the keyseat without making the overall length longer than the shaft. But the options given don't have a length that's too long, so perhaps this is okay.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: thickness 3/4 in., width 3/4 in., length 2.5 in.

If w=0.75 in, then from shear stress:

τ = 15,000 / (0.75)^2 = 15,000 / 0.5625 ≈ 26,666 psi, which is higher than the allowable 11,000 psi. So this option would fail in shear.

Wait, that can't be right because 26,666 exceeds 11,000. So option B is not suitable.

Option D: thickness 0.5 in, width 0.75 in. Wait, but if it's a square key, then width and thickness should be same, right? So perhaps D is not a square key, but a rectangular one. But the question says square key, so maybe D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the key as square. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says 'square key', so the cross-section is square, meaning width and thickness are equal. So in that case, the options must have width=thickness.

Looking at the options:

Option A: thickness=0.5, width=0.5. So that fits a square key.

Option B: 0.75 each, square.

Option C: 1.0 each, square.

Option D: 0.5 and 0.75, so not square. So D is not a square key.
