Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the roots of the equation x³ - 2x + 2 = 0 using Graeffe's root squaring method and then correct it to two decimals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this method, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that for any polynomial equation, the sum of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic equation like x³ + ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -a. Let me check the given equation: it's x³ - 2x + 2 = 0. So, comparing, the coefficient of x² is zero because it's missing. So the sum of the roots should be -0, which is zero. Wait, but the options don't have zero as the correct answer. Wait, looking again, option H is 0. So maybe that's the answer without even computing the roots numerically. But wait, the question says to apply Graeffe's method. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

But wait, the question is about applying Graeffe's method to find the roots and then sum them. But if I can get the sum directly from Vieta's, that would be quicker. Let me think again. Vieta's formula for a cubic equation x³ + a x² + b x + c = 0 gives the sum of roots as -a. In our equation, it's x³ + 0 x² -2x + 2 = 0, so a=0, so sum is 0. So the sum should be 0, which is option H. But wait, the user is asking to apply Graeffe's method. So maybe I'm supposed to find each root and sum them, but that seems redundant because Vieta's gives it immediately.

But perhaps the question is testing whether I know that Vieta's gives the sum without computing the roots. So the answer would be 0, option H. But the options given don't list H as correct in any of the initial thoughts. Wait, looking at the options, H is 0, so that would be the answer. But why then ask to apply Graeffe's method? Unless perhaps the user expects me to actually compute the roots and sum them, which should give 0, but if I make a mistake in computing the roots, maybe the sum would be different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "correct to two decimals." So maybe I'm supposed to compute each root numerically and sum them, but in reality, Vieta's formula gives the exact sum. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can just state that the sum is 0, regardless of the individual roots' approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to test if I know that Graeffe's method can be used to find the roots, but the sum can be found without computing all the roots. So the answer is 0, option H.

Wait, but looking back, the options include 0 as option H, so I think that's the correct choice.

The problem requires finding the sum of the roots of the equation \( x^3 - 2x + 2 = 0 \) using Graeffe's root squaring method, correct to two decimals. However, Vieta's formulas provide a direct way to determine the sum of the roots for any polynomial. For a cubic equation of the form \( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -a \). In the given equation, \( x^3 - 2x + 2 = 0 \), the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is zero (since the term is missing). Therefore, the sum of the roots is \( -0 = 0 \).

While the question mentions applying Graeffe's method, it is unnecessary in this case because Vieta's formula directly gives the sum of the roots as \( 0 \). Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: 0**
