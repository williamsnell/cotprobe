Question:

Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about computing the first differences of a one-dimensional array. 

So, the setup is that there's an array X with 50 elements. I need to create another array DX which has 49 elements. Each element in DX is calculated by subtracting X(I) from X(I+1) for I ranging from 1 to 49. So, DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). 

I remember that in programming, especially with arrays, the indices are crucial. Let me think about the loops and array dimensions here. 

Looking at the options provided, each option starts with some DIMENSION statements and then a loop. My goal is to find which option correctly initializes the arrays and computes DX correctly.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, the arrays. X has 50 elements, so it should be declared as DIMENSION X(50). DX should have 49 elements, so DIMENSION DX(49). So any option where X isn't 50 or DX isn't 49 can be eliminated. Let's check the options:

Option A: DIMENSION X(50), DX(49). That looks correct.
Option B: DX is 50, which is wrong. So B is out.
Option C: DX is 48, wrong.
Option D: It uses a FOR loop which might be correct, but let me check the rest.
Option E: X(50), DX(49) correct.
Option F: DX is 50, wrong.
Option G: Correct dimensions, but let's see the loop.
Option H: X is 49, wrong.
Option I: X is 51, wrong.
Option J: DX is 49, correct, but the loop might be wrong.

So from the dimensions alone, options A, D, E, G, J are possible.

Now the computation. The loop should run from I=1 to I=49. For each I, DX(I) should be X(I+1) - X(I).

Looking at the options:

Option A: The loop is DO 50 I=1,50. Wait, that's 50 iterations, but DX only has 49. So I=1 to 50 would run 50 times, but DX's indices go up to 49. So when I=50, trying to assign DX(50) which doesn't exist. That's an error. So option A is incorrect.

Option D: It's a FOR loop, which is more like in BASIC or some other language. Wait, but the question seems to be using a syntax similar to Fortran. Wait, the code in the options uses DO loops, but option D uses a FOR loop with NEXT. Hmm, but regardless of syntax, let's see what it does. It says DX(I) = X(I) - X(I+1). Oh wait, that's the reverse of what we need. Because DX(I) should be X(I+1) - X(I), not the other way around. So D computes negative of what's needed. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The loop is DO 50 I=1,49. So I runs from 1 to 49, which is correct. Then it computes DX(I) = X(I+1)-X(I). That's exactly what's needed. So E looks good.

Option G: The loop is I=2 to 50. So for I=2, it's DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1). Wait, so when I=2, DX(1) is X(2)-X(1). Then I=3, DX(2)=X(3)-X(2), and so on until I=50, which would set DX(49)=X(50)-X(49). So this is actually correct because it's just a different way of indexing. The loop runs 49 times (from 2 to 50 inclusive is 49 steps), and DX is filled properly. So G is also correct.

Wait, but the question says to write a program segment. So both E and G would work, but let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back: the question says to compute DX(I) for I=1 to 49. Option E does this directly, with I from 1-49, computing each DX(I). Option G uses I from 2-50, but each iteration sets DX(I-1). So when I is 2, DX(1) is set, and so on until I=50, which sets DX(49). So both approaches are correct. But I need to see if any of these options make a mistake in the loop or variables.

Wait, what about the loop in E? It's a DO loop with label 50, and the range is 1 to 49. That should run 49 times, correct. So E's code would correctly compute DX(1) to DX(49). So E is correct.

What about G's code? It runs from I=2 to 50, which is 49 times as well. So both E and G are correct in their approach. Hmm, but the question asks us to choose from the options. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the loop variables. Let me think about E's code:

Option E: DO 50 I=1,49. So the loop variable I goes from 1 to 49. Then, inside the loop, DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). So for I=1, it's X(2)-X(1), correct. And so on until I=49, which is X(50)-X(49). So yes, that's correct.

Option G: DO 50 I=2,50. So I starts at 2 and ends at 50. So the first iteration, I=2, sets DX(1) = X(2)-X(1). Then I=3, DX(2)=X(3)-X(2), etc. The last iteration is I=50, which sets DX(49)=X(50)-X(49). So that's correct as well.

So both E and G should work. But wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the code again.

Wait, in option G, the dimension is correct. X is 50, DX is 49.

So why are both E and G correct? Or is one of them incorrect? Let me read the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the difference is in the loop labels. No, in E the loop is labeled 50, runs I from 1 to 49. Inside, the code is DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I).

In G, loop runs I from 2 to 50, and assigns DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1). So both are correct.

Wait, but the question asks to compute DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I) for I=1 to 49. So E's code directly implements that. G's code does the same but shifts the index. So both should be correct, but perhaps the way the options are written, one is correct and the other has a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me check.

Option E is written as:

DIMENSIONX(50), DX(49) DO 50 I = 1, 49 50DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I) STOP END

Wait, the line after DO is 50DX(I)=..., but that might be a formatting issue. Assuming it's a typo, the correct line would be DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). So E is correct.

Option G is:

DIMENSION X(50), DX(49) DO 50 I = 2, 50 50 DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I - 1) STOP END

So for each I from 2 to 50, it's assigning to DX(I-1). So that's correct as well.

Wait, but then why are both E and G options? Because the question only expects one correct answer.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check other options.

Wait, option E's loop is written as DO 50 I=1,49 and inside, DX(I) = X(I+1)-X(I). That's correct.

Option G's loop is written as I=2 to 50, and each iteration sets DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1). That also correctly fills DX(1) to DX(49).

So both E and G seem correct. But the question provides them as separate options. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the question is in Fortran. In Fortran, the DO loop is structured as DO variable = start, end, step. So for option E, the loop would run I from 1 to 49, which is correct. Option G runs I from 2 to 50, which is also correct.

So why are both E and G present? Let me look again. The question asks to compute DX(I) for I=1 to 49. So both approaches are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the other options again, but I think E and G are correct. But the options don't have both as correct, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the loop ranges.

In option E, the loop runs from 1 to 49, correct. So 49 iterations.

In option G, the loop runs from 2 to 50, which is 49 iterations as well (since 50-2+1=49). So correct.

But wait, looking at the code in option G, it's written as DO 50 I=2,50. So I starts at 2 and goes to 50. So yes, 49 times.

So both E and G seem correct. But the options can't have two correct answers, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says that X has 50 elements, and DX has 49. So in option G, when I is 50, X(I) is X(50), which is valid because X has 50 elements. So that's fine.

Hmm. But the question is a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the options.

Wait, perhaps I should check the order of subtraction. Option D does X(I)-X(I+1), which is wrong. So D is incorrect.

Wait, the correct calculation is DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). So in option E, that's correctly done.

In option G, each iteration does X(I) - X(I-1), which is the same as X(I) - X(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1) = DX(I-1). So yes, correct.

Wait, but that's the same as E's approach, just shifted. So both E and G are correct. But the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possible errors. Let's see the syntax. In option E, the code inside the loop is written as 50DX(I) = X(I+1)-X(I). Oh wait, in Fortran, the statement after the DO must be labeled. So the structure is:

DO 50 I = 1,49
50 DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I)
STOP
END

Wait, that's correct. The label 50 is on the assignment statement, which is the loop body. So E's code is correct.

Option G's code is:

DO 50 I = 2,50
50 DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1)
STOP
END

This is also correct. So both E and G are correct. But that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options.

Wait, looking back, the question says that the first differences are formed by subtracting each element except the last from the next one. So for I=1 to 49, DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). So E does that correctly.

Option G computes for I from 2 to 50, and sets DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1). So when I=2, DX(1) = X(2)-X(1). Correct. When I=50, DX(49)=X(50)-X(49). Correct. So G also correctly computes the differences.

So both E and G are correct, but the options don't have two correct answers. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the other options again to see if any of them are correct. Let me see.

Option J: It has a loop from 1 to 48. So that would only compute 48 elements. So J is incorrect.

Option I's X dimension is 51, which is wrong.

So back to E and G. But in the given options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the question is written in a way that the loop index in E is 1 to 49, which is correct, and G's approach is also correct, but perhaps the initial problem statement uses a different index starting point. For example, if the arrays are 1-based, which Fortran is, then both are correct. But the question's code might have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps one of the options has an off-by-one error.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and E is the correct option because it's the straightforward approach, while G is just an alternative but less direct method.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the options. Let me think again.

The question says that the first differences are formed by subtracting each element except the last from the next. So for each I from 1 to 49, DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). So E's loop correctly does this. So E is correct.

G's loop does the same, but shifts the index. So it's also correct.

Wait, but the options are A to J. So perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the other options again.

Looking at option E, the code is:

DIMENSION X(50), DX(49)
DO 50 I = 1,49
50 DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I)
STOP
END

Yes, that's correct.

Option G's code is:

DIMENSION X(50), DX(49)
DO 50 I = 2,50
50 DX(I-1) = X(I) - X(I-1)
STOP
END

Which is also correct.

Hmm, so why are both E and G correct? Unless I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps in the question, the loop in option E runs from 1 to 49, but in code, the DO loop in Fortran is written as DO I = start, end. So E's loop would run 49 times, correct.

So the conundrum is that both E and G are correct. But in the options, each is a separate choice, so the intended correct answer must be E. Because it's the direct approach, and perhaps G is a different approach but also correct. But perhaps the question expects E as the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the loop in E is written as I=1,50, which would be 50 iterations, but the code in E says I=1,49. Wait, no, in option E it's I=1,49. So that's correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is E. But I'm a bit confused because G also seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the loop in option G has an off-by-one error. Let me see. For I from 2 to 50, which is 49 times. For each, DX(I-1) is set. So when I=2, DX(1) is set. When I=50, DX(49) is set. So that's correct.

So both E and G are correct. But the question has only one correct option. Hmm. So perhaps I should think about which one matches the question's code structure.

The question says that the first differences are formed by subtracting each element except the last (since nothing follows the last) from the element immediately following it. So for each I from 1 to 49, compute X(I+1)-X(I).

So E's code correctly does this, and G's code also does this but in a different way. So perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering G. Let me think again.

In option G, for each I from 2 to 50, compute X(I) - X(I-1), which is the same as X(I) - X(I-1) = DX(I-1). So yes, that's correct.

So both options E and G are correct. But the options list them as E and G, so perhaps the correct answer is both, but that's not possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in option G, the loop runs from 2 to 50, which is correct, but in the code, the label after DO is 50, and the assignment is labeled 50. So that's correct.

So perhaps both E and G are correct. But the options can't have two correct answers, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is written in a way that the first element of X is X(1), and the last is X(50). So in option G, when I=50, X(I) is X(50), which is correct, and X(I-1) is X(49). So that's correct.

So perhaps the answer is both E and G are correct. But since the options don't allow that, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps one of the options has a typo.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I'm confusing the loop variable in E. Oh wait, in E, the loop is I=1 to 49, and the assignment is DX(I) = X(I+1) - X(I). So for I=49, X(I+1) is X(50), which is correct.

In G, I runs up to 50, so X(I) is X(50), which is correct. So both are correct.

But the options provided don't have both E and G as correct. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, but the question asks to compute DX(I) for I=1 to 49, and option E directly does that. So perhaps E is the intended correct answer.

Therefore, I'll choose option E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to compute the first differences of an array `X` containing 50 elements and store these differences in another array `DX` with 49 elements. The first difference is defined as `DX(I) = X(I + 1) - X(I)` for `I = 1, 2, ...,
