Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking about the smallest number of standard deviations from the mean needed to ensure that at least 50% of the data is included. The options are given from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about the empirical rule and maybe the normal distribution.

Wait, the empirical rule, right? That's the one where data within one standard deviation is about 68%, two standard deviations is 95%, and three is 99.7%. But wait, this is for a normal distribution. But the question is about any distribution, not necessarily normal. Oh wait, no, the question says "a distribution", so maybe it's assuming normality here because otherwise, the answer could vary.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Maybe it's referring to the rule that in any distribution, at least a certain percentage lies within a certain number of standard deviations. Oh wait, I think Chebyshev's inequality comes into play here. Chebyshev's inequality gives a bound on the number of data points within a certain number of standard deviations from the mean, but it's for any distribution, not assuming normality.

Right, Chebyshev's theorem states that at least (1 - 1/k²) of the data lies within k standard deviations of the mean. So if we want at least 50% of the data, that's 0.5. So we set 1 - 1/k² = 0.5. Let me solve for k.

So 1 - 1/k² = 0.5 → 1/k² = 0.5 → k² = 2 → k = sqrt(2). Which is approximately 1.414. So the smallest k would be just over 1.414. So looking at the options, which one is closest to that.

Looking at the options: option J is 1.4. Option C is 1.9, which is larger. So the smallest number of standard deviations is 1.4, which is option J.

Wait a second, but wait. Wait, Chebyshev's gives a lower bound. So if we take k=1.414, then 50% is the minimum. So to ensure at least 50%, we need to go at least sqrt(2) standard deviations away. But the question is asking for the smallest number of standard deviations needed to ensure at least 50% of data. So that would be sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414. So the correct answer is J, 1.4.

Wait, but another thought: if it's the normal distribution, then 50% lies within about 0.67 standard deviations. Because in the normal distribution, the middle 50% is roughly within 0.67 sigma. But the question doesn't specify the distribution. So if it's a general distribution, then Chebyshev applies, giving 1.4. So the question is likely referring to Chebyshev's, so the answer is J.

Wait, but the options include G: 0.67, which is the normal distribution's 50% mark. So the confusion is whether the question is assuming a normal distribution or a general one.

The question says "a distribution", which could be any. So the safest approach is to use Chebyshev. Because without knowing the distribution, Chebyshev gives the guarantee. So with Chebyshev, you need at least sqrt(2) ≈1.414, so answer J, 1.4.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

Options:
A:3.1
B:2.1
C:1.9
D:2.0
E:0.5
F:2.5
G:0.67
H:3.5
I:1.0
J:1.4

So J is 1.4, which is the correct answer based on Chebyshev's inequality for any distribution.

Alternatively, if it's a normal distribution, the answer would be around 0.67 (option G), but the question doesn't specify, so I think the correct approach is to go with Chebyshev, hence 1.4, option J.

To determine the smallest number of standard deviations from the mean required to ensure that at least 50% of the data is included, we must consider the nature of the distribution. If the distribution is normal, approximately 50% of the data lies within about 0.67 standard deviations of the mean. However, the question does not specify the distribution, so we must assume it could be any distribution.

For any distribution, Chebyshev's inequality provides a general bound. It states that at least \(1 - \frac{1}{k^2}\) of the data lies within \(k\) standard deviations of the mean. To ensure at least 50% of the data, we set \(1 - \frac{1}{k^2} = 0.5\). Solving for \(k\):

\[
1 - \frac{1}{k^2} = 0.5 \implies \frac{1}{k^2} = 0.5 \implies k^2 = 2 \implies k = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414.
\]

Thus, the smallest number of standard deviations required is approximately 1.414. Among the given options, the closest value is 1.4 (option J). This ensures that at least 50% of the data is included, regardless of the distribution's shape.

Answer: J
