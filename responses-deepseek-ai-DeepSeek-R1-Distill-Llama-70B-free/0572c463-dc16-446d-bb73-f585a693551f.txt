Okay, I have this question about Leopold Pospisil's four elements of law. Hmm, I remember Pospisil was an anthropologist who studied legal systems, especially in stateless societies. So, the question is asking about the four elements he identified. The options given are A through J.

The question states that the first three elements are authority, universality, and obligatio. I need to find the fourth one. Let me think... I think Pospisil's four elements are: authority, universality, obligatio, and something else. Wait, I remember reading that he talked about sanctions or something similar. Oh right, the fourth element was sanctions. Because without some form of sanction or enforcement, laws wouldn't be effective.

Let me double-check the options. Option H is Sanction. So the answer should be H. Wait, but I also recall that another possible term might be 'punishment', but I think Pospisil specifically used 'sanction' as a broader term that can include both rewards and punishments. So yes, H is the correct choice.

The correct answer is H: Sanction. Leopold Pospisil's four elements of law include authority, universality, obligatio, and sanction. Sanctions are necessary for enforcing legal norms.

H
