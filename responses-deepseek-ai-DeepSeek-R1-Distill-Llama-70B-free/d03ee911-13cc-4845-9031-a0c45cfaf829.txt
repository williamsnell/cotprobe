Okay, I'm trying to figure out which option is not a form of interspecies interaction. The question lists four options: A is Commensalism, B is Succession, C is Mutualism, and D is Parasitism. 

First, I need to understand what each of these terms means. I remember that interspecies interactions refer to how different species interact with each other in an ecosystem. The main types I learned about are mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, and competition. 

So, mutualism (C) is when both species benefit. Like how clownfish and sea anemones help each other. Commensalism (A) is where one species benefits and the other isn't affected much, like barnacles on a whale. Parasitism (D) is when one species, the parasite, harms the host while benefiting itself, such as tapeworms in the intestines of a host.

Now, the tricky part is option B, which is Succession. I recall that succession refers to the process of change in the species composition of a community over time. It's about how ecosystems develop and replace one another. For example, after a fire, grasses and shrubs grow first, then trees. This process doesn't involve direct interactions between species; it's more about the community structure changing.

Wait, but isn't succession sometimes influenced by interactions between species? Like when one plant's growth might prepare the soil for another. Hmm, but the question is about the form of interspecies interaction. So mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism all describe specific interactions between two species. Succession is a broader ecological process involving the community as a whole, not a direct interaction between two species. 

So the answer should be B: Succession, because it's not a type of direct interaction between two species but rather a process of community change over time.

The question asks which of the listed options is not a form of interspecies interaction. 

- **Commensalism (A):** This is an interaction where one species benefits and the other is not significantly affected. It is a form of interspecies interaction.
- **Succession (B):** This refers to the process of change in species composition within a community over time. It is not a direct interaction between two species but rather a broader ecological process.
- **Mutualism (C):** This is an interaction where both species benefit. It is a form of interspecies interaction.
- **Parasitism (D):** This is an interaction where one species (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the host. It is a form of interspecies interaction.

Since succession describes a community-level process rather than a direct interaction between two species, it is the correct answer.

Answer: B
