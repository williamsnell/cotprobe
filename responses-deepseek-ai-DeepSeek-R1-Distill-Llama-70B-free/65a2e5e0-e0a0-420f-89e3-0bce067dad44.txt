Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking me to find the algebraic expression that matches the word phrase: "4 times as many cans as Tom collected." The options are A through J, which I need to look at.

First, I'll break down the phrase. The key part is "4 times as many cans as Tom collected." So, Tom's number of cans is a variable, right? Let's say Tom collected 't' cans. Then, the phrase is saying four times that amount.

So, if Tom has t cans, four times as many would be 4 multiplied by t. That sounds straightforward. So the expression should be 4t. Let me check the options. Option A is 4t, which seems to fit.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes these problems can be tricky. Let me think again. The phrase says "4 times as many cans as Tom." So it's directly proportional. So if Tom has t, then it's 4*t, which is 4t. Yeah, that makes sense.

Let me look at the other options to make sure I'm not choosing the wrong one. Option B is 4 minus t, which would be if it was saying four less than Tom's cans, but that's not the case here. Option C is 4 divided by t, which doesn't fit the phrase at all. Option D is t minus 4t, which is -3t, which is negative and doesn't match. Option E is 4 plus t, which would mean adding, not multiplying. Option F is t plus 4, same issue. G is t divided by 4, which is different. H is t over 4, same as G. I is t minus 4.

So none of the other options fit except A. So I think A is the correct answer.

The correct algebraic expression for "4 times as many cans as Tom collected" is **4t**, which corresponds to option A.
