Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about D-flip-flops. Hmm, I remember that flip-flops are basic components in digital electronics, used for storing data. But wait, what's a D-flip-flop specifically?

I think a D-flip-flop has two inputs: the data input (D) and the clock (CK). Oh right, and the outputs are Q and Q-bar, which are inverses of each other. The D stands for "data", so the flip-flop stores the data when the clock is triggered.

The question is about when the D-flip-flop is transparent. Transparent... I'm a bit fuzzy on that term. I think transparent mode means that the output follows the input as long as the clock is in a certain state. So, maybe when the clock is high, the flip-flop is transparent, meaning the output changes as the input changes.

So, when is the flip-flop transparent? I remember that flip-flops can be either edge-triggered or level-triggered. Oh wait, no—edge-triggered means the output changes on the rising or falling edge of the clock. But transparent mode sounds more like level-triggered behavior. So when the clock is in a certain level (like high), the output follows the input immediately.

Wait, but the D-flip-flop is typically edge-triggered. Because I recall that the D input is only sampled when the clock transitions—like on the rising edge. So during the time when the clock is high, the flip-flop isn't storing data; it's only at the edge that it captures the data.

So when does the flip-flop become transparent? Maybe when the clock is in a certain state. Oh, right! When the clock is high, the flip-flop is transparent. Because in some cases, like in a transparent latch, the output follows the input when the clock is high. Wait, but a D-flip-flop is a type of edge-triggered device, whereas a latch is level-triggered.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this confused. Let me think again. A D latch is level-triggered. So when the clock is high, the output follows the input (transparent), and when the clock is low, it holds the value. But a D flip-flop is edge-triggered, so it only updates on the rising edge.

But the question is about when the flip-flop is transparent. So if the flip-flop is transparent when it's allowing the input to affect the output, that would be when the clock is high, perhaps.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E says the output follows the input. So when the flip-flop is transparent, output follows input. So that would be when it's in transparent mode, which I think is when the clock is high for a level-triggered device.

Wait, but the question is about a D-flip-flop. So if it's a D-flip-flop, which is edge-triggered, then when is it transparent? Or maybe the term "transparent" applies to a D latch, not a flip-flop. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "A D-flip-flop is said to be transparent when". So perhaps in some contexts, a D-flip-flop can be in a mode where it's transparent. Or maybe the question is about the general behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps when the clock is high, the flip-flop is transparent. So the output follows the input.

Looking at the options, option E is "the output follows input." So if the flip-flop is transparent, then yes, output follows input.

Other options: Option A says output is independent of clock. That doesn't sound right. When transparent, the output would depend on the clock being in a certain state, perhaps.

Option C is about a rising edge trigger, which is how D-flip-flops usually work, but that's not about being transparent.

So I think the correct answer is E.

A D-flip-flop is a digital circuit that stores data and is typically edge-triggered, meaning it updates its output on the rising or falling edge of the clock signal. However, the term "transparent" refers to a mode where the output directly follows the input as long as the clock is in a specific state. This behavior is characteristic of level-triggered devices, such as a D latch, where the output follows the input when the clock is high.

In the context of the question, "transparent" implies that the output mirrors the input. Among the given options, the one that aligns with this definition is:

**E: the output follows input.**

This option correctly describes the condition when the D-flip-flop is transparent, as the output reflects the input without delay.

Answer: E
