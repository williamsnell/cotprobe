Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the curvature of the function f(x) = sqrt(4x - x²) at x = 2. Hmm, I remember that curvature is a measure of how much the curve deviates from being a straight line. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that? I think the formula for curvature involves the first and second derivatives of the function. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

Oh right, the formula for curvature κ (kappa) at a point x is given by:

κ = |f''(x)| / [1 + (f'(x))²]^(3/2)

So I need to compute the first and second derivatives of f(x) and then plug them into this formula at x=2.

Alright, let's start by finding f(x) which is sqrt(4x - x²). Maybe it's easier if I rewrite the square root as a power, so f(x) = (4x - x²)^(1/2). That might make taking derivatives simpler.

First, let's compute the first derivative f'(x). Using the chain rule: the derivative of u^(1/2) is (1/2)u^(-1/2) * du/dx. So here, u = 4x - x², so du/dx is 4 - 2x.

Putting that together, f'(x) = (1/2)(4x - x²)^(-1/2) * (4 - 2x). Let's simplify that. The 1/2 can be factored out, and I can factor a 2 out of (4-2x), making it 2(2 - x). So:

f'(x) = (1/2) * [2(2 - x)] / sqrt(4x - x²)
The 1/2 and 2 cancel out, so f'(x) = (2 - x) / sqrt(4x - x²)

Hmm, let me double-check that. Wait, wait, 4-2x is 2(2 -x), right. So yeah, 1/2 times 2 is 1, so (2 - x)/sqrt(...). Yep.

Now I need to evaluate f'(x) at x=2. Let's plug in x=2:

f'(2) = (2 - 2)/sqrt(4*2 - (2)^2) = 0/sqrt(8 - 4) = 0/sqrt(4) = 0/2 = 0. So f'(2) is 0. That's interesting; the slope is zero at that point, so it's a local maximum or minimum.

Next, I need the second derivative f''(x). Let's find that. Starting from f'(x) = (2 - x)/sqrt(4x - x²). Let me write it as (2 - x) * (4x - x²)^(-1/2).

So to find f''(x), I'll need to use the product rule. The product rule states that d/dx [u*v] = u'v + uv'.

Let me set u = (2 - x), so u' = -1.

And v = (4x - x²)^(-1/2). So the derivative of v would be (-1/2)(4x - x²)^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x).

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. The derivative of v with respect to x is:

v = (4x -x²)^(-1/2)
dv/dx = (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2) * (d/dx [4x -x²])
= (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2) * (4-2x)

So putting it all together, f''(x) is:

u' v + u v' 
= (-1) * (4x -x²)^(-1/2) + (2 - x) * [ (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x) ]

Let me simplify each term. The first term is (-1) * (4x -x²)^(-1/2). The second term is (2 - x) * (-1/2) * (4 - 2x) * (4x -x²)^(-3/2).

Wait, perhaps I can factor out some terms. Let's write both terms with denominator (4x -x²)^(3/2), so I can combine them.

First term: (-1) * (4x -x²)^(-1/2) = (-1) * (4x -x²)^( -1/2 ) = (-1) * (4x -x²)^( -1/2 ) * (4x -x²)^(-1) / (4x -x²)^(-1) ) Hmm, maybe a better approach is to write both terms over the same denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate f''(2) directly without simplifying f''(x) in general.

Wait, since we'll be evaluating at x=2, maybe plugging in x=2 early can simplify things.

Let me try that.

First, compute f'(2) which we already did as 0.

Now, let's find f''(2). Let's compute each part of f''(x) at x=2.

Compute u' v at x=2:

u' is -1. v is (4x -x²)^(-1/2) at x=2: 4*2=8, 2²=4, so 8-4=4. So (4)^( -1/2 )=1/2. So u' v = (-1) * (1/2) = -1/2.

Next, compute u v' at x=2:

u is (2 - x) = 0 at x=2. So the second term is (0) * [v'] which is zero. So the entire second term is zero.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because when x=2, 2 - x =0, so yes, the second term is zero regardless of what v' is. So f''(2) is just u' v at x=2, which is -1/2.

Wait, but wait a minute, no. Because f''(x) is u' v + u v'. So when x=2, it's (-1)*(1/2) + (0)*something. So yes, f''(2) = (-1)*(1/2) + 0 = -1/2.

Wait, but wait, when I computed the second term, I had:

(2 - x) * [ (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x) ]

At x=2, (2 - x) is zero, so the entire term is zero. So f''(2) is only the first term, which is (-1) * (1/2) = -0.5.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when I wrote f''(x) as u' v + u v', maybe I missed some factors. Let me recompute f''(x) step by step.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing v' correctly.

v = (4x -x²)^(-1/2)
v' = (-1/2)(4x -x^2)^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x)

So, f''(x) = u' v + u v'
= (-1) * (4x -x²)^(-1/2) + (2 - x) * [ (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2)(4 - 2x) ]

At x=2, let's compute each term.

First term: (-1) * (4*2 - 2^2)^(-1/2) = (-1) * (8-4)^(-1/2) = (-1) * (4)^(-1/2) = (-1) * (1/2) = -1/2.

Second term: (2 - 2) * [ ... anything ... ] = 0 * something = 0.

So f''(2) = -1/2 + 0 = -1/2.

Wait, but curvature formula uses the absolute value of f''(x). So κ = |f''(x)| / [1 + (f'(x))^2]^(3/2).

We have f''(2) = -1/2, so |f''(2)| is 1/2.

And f'(2) is 0, so (f'(2))^2 = 0. So denominator becomes [1 + 0]^(3/2) = 1^(3/2) =1.

So κ = (1/2) / 1 = 1/2.

Wait, wait, but wait a moment. When I computed f''(x), I thought f''(2) was -1/2, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the derivative. Let me recompute f''(x) more carefully.

Given f'(x) = (2 - x) / sqrt(4x - x^2).

So f'(x) = (2 - x) (4x - x^2)^(-1/2).

So f''(x) is the derivative of that.

Using the product rule: derivative of (u*v) = u'v + u v'.

u = (2 - x) → u' = -1.

v = (4x -x²)^(-1/2) → v' = (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x).

So f''(x) = (-1) * (4x -x²)^(-1/2) + (2 - x) * [ (-1/2)(4x -x²)^(-3/2) * (4 - 2x) ]

Now, let's evaluate this at x=2.

First term: (-1) * (4*(2) - (2)^2)^(-1/2) → (-1) * (8 -4)^(-1/2) → (-1) * (4)^(-1/2) → (-1) * (1/2) → -1/2.

Second term: (2-2) * [ ... ] → 0 * anything = 0.

So f''(2) = -1/2 + 0 = -1/2.

So |f''(2)| is 1/2.

And f'(2) is 0, so (f'(2))^2 is 0.

So denominator is (1 + 0)^(3/2) = 1.

Thus, κ = (1/2)/1 = 1/2.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.5, which is 1/2. So the curvature is 0.5, which is option C.

Wait, but wait another moment. The function f(x) = sqrt(4x -x²). Let me make sure that at x=2, the function is defined. Because sqrt(4*2 -2²) = sqrt(8-4) = sqrt(4)=2, which is real, so yes, it's defined.

Wait, but what's the graph of f(x) = sqrt(4x -x²)? Let me think. 4x -x² is a quadratic that opens downward, with roots at x=0 and x=4. So sqrt of that would be the upper half of the circle, since 4x -x² = -(x² -4x) = -(x² -4x +4 -4) = -(x-2)^2 +4. So 4x -x² = 4 - (x-2)^2. So f(x) = sqrt(4 - (x-2)^2), which is the equation of a semicircle centered at x=2, y=0, with radius 2. So the graph is the upper half of the circle (y ≥ 0) with center at (2,0) and radius 2.

Wait, so the point x=2 corresponds to the top of the semicircle. Because when x=2, y = sqrt(4*2 -2^2) = sqrt(8-4)=sqrt(4)=2. So the point is (2,2), which is the highest point on the semicircle. At that point, the curvature should be the same as the curvature of a circle with radius 2. The curvature of a circle is 1/r, so 1/2 here, which matches what I calculated earlier.

So that makes sense. So κ = 1/2, which is option C.

To find the curvature of the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{4x - x^2} \) at \( x = 2 \), we use the formula for curvature:

\[
\kappa = \frac{|f''(x)|}{\left(1 + (f'(x))^2\right)^{3/2}}
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( f'(x) \)
The function is \( f(x) = (4x - x^2)^{1/2} \). Using the chain rule, the first derivative is:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}(4x - x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (4 - 2x) = \frac{4 - 2x}{2\sqrt{4x - x^2}} = \frac{2 - x}{\sqrt{4x - x^2}}
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate \( f'(x) \) at \( x = 2 \)
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f'(x) \):

\[
f'(2) = \frac{2 - 2}{\sqrt{4(2) - (2)^2}} = \frac{0}{\sqrt{8 - 4}} = 0
\]

Thus, \( f'(2) = 0 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( f''(x) \)
Using the product rule on \( f'(x) = (2 - x)(4x - x^2)^{-1/2} \), we find:

\[
f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left[(2 - x)(4x - x^2)^{-1/2}\right]
\]

Let \( u = 2 - x \) and \( v = (4x - x^2)^{-1/2} \). Then:

\[
u' = -1, \quad v' = -\frac{1}{2}(4x - x^2)^{-3/2}(4 - 2x)
\]

Applying the product rule:

\[
f''(x) = u'v + uv' = (-1)(4x - x^2)^{-1/2} + (2 - x)\left(-\frac{1}{2}(4x - x^2)^{-3/2}(4 - 2x)\right)
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate \( f''(x) \) at \( x = 2 \)
Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f''(x) \):

1. First term: \( (-1)(4(2) - (2)^2)^{-1/2} = (-1)(8 - 4)^{-1/2} = (-1)(4)^{-1/2} = -\frac{1}{2} \)
2. Second term: \( (2 - 2)\left(-\frac{1}{2}(4(2) - (2)^2)^{-3/2}(4 - 2(2))\right) = 0 \)

Thus, \( f''(2) = -\frac{1}{2} + 0 = -\frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 5: Compute the curvature \( \kappa \)
Using \( \kappa = \frac{|f''(x)|}{\left(1 + (f'(x))^2\right)^{3/2}} \):

- \( |f''(2)| = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( f'(2) = 0 \), so \( \left(1 + (f'(2))^2\right)^{3/2} = 1^{3/2} = 1 \)

Thus:

\[
\kappa = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Final Answer
The curvature of \( f(x) = \sqrt{4x - x^2} \) at \( x = 2 \) is \( 0.5 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
