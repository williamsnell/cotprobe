Question:

Briefly describe motor development in the adolescent.

Options:

A: Adolescent's motor development is marked by a decrease in the length of limbs and slower motor performance.
B: Adolescent's motor development sees a reduction in rapid growth, a decrease in physical strength, and an increase in reaction time.
C: Adolescent's motor development includes a plateau in physical strength, no significant growth, and unchanging reaction times.
D: Adolescent's motor development leads to a decline in coordination and motor skills due to rapid limb growth.
E: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by a rapid increase in physical activity but no significant changes in strength or motor performance.
F: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by decreased physical strength and slower reaction time.
G: Adolescent's motor development involves a decrease in physical activity and longer reaction time.
H: Adolescent's motor development is defined by minimal changes in physical strength and limb length, with no improvement in motor performance.
I: Adolescent's motor development is marked by a steady decline in both growth and physical activity levels.
J: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by increased physical strength, rapid growth, increased length of limbs, accelerated speed of motor performance, and shorter reaction time.

Okay, so I've got this question about motor development in adolescents, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that adolescence is a period of significant growth and development. It's the phase between childhood and adulthood, roughly from ages 10 to 18. During this time, the body undergoes a lot of changes due to puberty.

Motor development refers to the progression of physical skills, like coordination, strength, and movement. So during adolescence, I think there's a lot happening here. I recall that during puberty, there's a growth spurt where both height and limb length increase rapidly. This can sometimes lead to a temporary awkwardness because the body is growing so fast, but overall, it's a time of improvement in physical abilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A says there's a decrease in limb length and slower motor performance. That doesn't sound right. I thought limb length increases, not decreases, during adolescence.

Option B mentions a reduction in rapid growth, decrease in strength, and increased reaction time. Wait, I thought growth spurts happen in adolescence, so if it's a reduction, that might be incorrect. Also, physical strength should be increasing, not decreasing, as muscles develop.

Option C suggests a plateau in strength, no growth, and same reaction times. That doesn't fit because I remember adolescence being a time of significant growth and strength gains.

Option D talks about declining coordination due to rapid limb growth. Hmm, I think during the growth spurt, coordination might be a bit off temporarily, but overall, motor skills improve as the teen matures. So maybe D isn't the best choice.

Option E says there's a rapid increase in physical activity without changes in strength or performance. I'm not sure about that. I think strength does increase, so E might not be correct.

Option F has decreased strength and slower reaction times. No, that seems opposite of what happens.

Option G is about decreased activity and longer reaction times. Doesn't fit with what I know about increased capabilities.

Option H says minimal changes in strength and limb length. No, I think there are significant changes.

Option I mentions a decline in growth and activity. That doesn't sound right either.

Option J states increased strength, rapid growth, longer limbs, accelerated motor performance, and shorter reaction times. This seems to align with what I remember. During adolescence, especially in the growth spurt, limbs get longer, strength increases, and motor skills improve. Reaction times also get shorter because the nervous system matures.

Wait, but could there be any exceptions? I think some teens might experience a temporary clumsiness as their limbs grow quickly, but overall, by late adolescence, motor skills have improved. So J sounds correct.

So I think the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J. Adolescent motor development is characterized by increased physical strength, rapid growth, increased limb length, accelerated motor performance, and shorter reaction times.

Answer: J
