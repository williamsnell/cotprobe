Alright, so I've got this problem here about the Redding Department Store and how they distribute administrative expenses. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that the store uses the sales ratio method to distribute administrative expenses. I remember that the sales ratio method probably means that each department's share of the expenses is based on their proportion of total sales. So, the idea is that departments with higher sales contribute more to the administrative costs.

The total sales for June were $408,000, and the administrative expense was $22,600. The lingerie department had sales of $10,200. I need to find out what share of the administrative expenses the lingerie department should bear.

Okay, so first, I think I should calculate the proportion of the lingerie department's sales relative to the total sales. That proportion would then be applied to the total administrative expenses to find their share.

Let me write that down. The formula would be: (Lingerie Sales / Total Sales) * Administrative Expenses.

Plugging in the numbers: (10,200 / 408,000) * 22,600.

Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, the lingerie's share is their sales over total sales, times the total admin expense. That makes sense because each department's contribution is proportional to their sales.

Let me calculate the ratio first. 10,200 divided by 408,000. Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can simplify this. 408,000 divided by 10,200. Wait, no, I think I should compute it as 10,200 / 408,000.

Alternatively, I can simplify the numbers by dividing numerator and denominator by 100, so 102 / 4080. Maybe that's easier. Wait, 102 divided by 4080. Let me compute that.

Wait, maybe I can simplify the fraction before doing the division. Both 102 and 4080 are divisible by 6, I think.

102 รท 6 is 17. 4080 รท6 is 680. So the ratio becomes 17/680. Hmm, that's still a bit messy. Maybe I can compute 17 divided by 680.

Wait, 17 divided by 680 is the same as 17/(680) = 0.025. Because 680 times 0.025 is 17. Let me check that: 680 * 0.025. 680 * 0.02 is 13.6, and 680 * 0.005 is 3.4. So 13.6 +3.4=17. Yes, correct. So that's 0.025.

So the ratio is 0.025, which is 2.5%. Okay, so that's the proportion of the total sales that the lingerie department contributed.

Now, I need to apply this proportion to the administrative expenses. So, 0.025 multiplied by $22,600.

Let me compute that. 22,600 * 0.025.

Hmm, 22,600 * 0.02 is 452. 22,600 * 0.005 is 113. So 452 + 113 = 565. So the lingerie department's share should be $565.

Looking at the options, option A is $565. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, 10,200 / 408,000 = 0.025. 22,600 * 0.025 = 565. Yep, that looks right. So I think A is correct.

To determine the lingerie department's share of the administrative expenses, we use the sales ratio method. The formula is:

\[
\text{Lingerie Share} = \left( \frac{\text{Lingerie Sales}}{\text{Total Sales}} \right) \times \text{Administrative Expenses}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
\text{Lingerie Share} = \left( \frac{10,200}{408,000} \right) \times 22,600
\]

First, calculate the ratio:
\[
\frac{10,200}{408,000} = 0.025
\]

Then, apply this ratio to the administrative expenses:
\[
0.025 \times 22,600 = 565
\]

Thus, the lingerie department's share of the administrative expenses is **$565**.

The correct answer is **A: $565**.
