Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the standard molar entropy of F₂⁻ at 298 K. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to the thermodynamic properties of a substance. Wait, the question gives me some spectroscopic data—ground state, vibrational wavenumber, and some excited states' energies. I think I need to use this information to find the entropy.

Wait, the entropy of a molecule can be broken down into translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions. Right, because each of these degrees of freedom contributes to the total entropy.

So the formula for the total entropy (S°) is the sum of S_translational, S_rotational, S_vibrational, and S_electronic.

I remember the translational entropy is calculated using the Sackur-Tetrode equation. Oh wait, but wait, that's for an ideal gas. I think F₂⁻ might be considered as a gas here, but I'm not entirely sure. But the problem doesn't specify the state, so I'll proceed under that assumption.

The Sackur-Tetrode equation is S_trans = R ln[(2πmkT)^(3/2)/(h³ n^(1/2))] ... wait, no, maybe I should recall the formula properly. Alternatively, S_trans is often given as (3/2 R) ln(T) plus some constants involving the mass and the Planck constant.

Wait, I think the translational entropy can be calculated using the equation:

S_trans = R [ (3/2) ln(M) + ln(P) - ln(n) ] + ... no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the Sackur-Tetrode equation for entropy is S = R ln[(V/(n)) (2πmkT/(h²))^(3/2)) ]^(1/γ?), no, maybe I should look it up but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I remember.

Wait, another approach: the translational entropy can be calculated using the formula:

S_trans = R ln[(kT/(hc))^(3/2) * (2πm c²)^(3/2) * V] / (n)

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the molar translational entropy. Oh wait, the formula for entropy from translational motion for an ideal gas is S_trans = (5/2) R ln(T) - R ln(P) + other terms involving molar mass. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should use the standard formulas for each contribution.

Starting with translational entropy (S_trans):

The formula for translational entropy is (for a monatomic gas, but F₂⁻ is diatomic, wait no—wait F₂⁻ is a diatomic ion, so maybe it's considered as a diatomic molecule here, but the translational part is same for all, I think.

The molar translational entropy can be calculated as:

S_trans = R ln( (2π m k T)^{3/2} / (h^3 P) ) + ... but wait, I'm getting confused, perhaps I should look for the standard formula.

Alternatively, the molar translational entropy is given by:

S_trans = R [ (3/2) ln(T) + ln(M) + C ]

Where M is the molar mass in kg/mol. Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe another approach: for a molecule, the translational entropy is given by the Sackur-Tetrode equation, which is:

S_trans = R ln [(V (2 π m k T)^{3/2}) / (h^3 n)] )

But since we're dealing with molar quantities, perhaps it's better to express it per mole.

Wait, another formula I remember is for the translational entropy as:

S_trans = R [ (3/2) ln(T) - ln(P) + ln(M) + (3/2) ln(2π k R / h²) + ... ]

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the molar entropy contributions. Let me think step by step.

1. Translational:
The translational entropy is calculated using the Sackur-Tetrode equation. The formula for molar translational entropy is:

S_trans = (3/2) R ln(T) - R ln(P) + R ln(M) + (3/2 R ln(2π k R / h²)) )

Wait, but for standard conditions, P is 1 atm, right? So if we're calculating standard molar entropy, P is 1 atm.

But wait, the problem states 'standard molar entropy', which would be at 1 bar, but I think in older textbooks it's sometimes 1 atm. I'll proceed with P=1 atm.

Wait, but wait, the standard molar entropy is the entropy at 298 K and 1 bar pressure. But the units here are in cm⁻¹ and pm, so perhaps the pressure is 1 atm. Hmm, but let's proceed.

Wait, the formula for S_trans (molar) is:

S_trans = (3/2) R ln(T) - R ln(P) + R ln(M) + C,

where C is a constant term involving the gas constant and Planck's constant.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find each contribution step by step.

So, for F₂⁻, let's find each part:

First, translational entropy.

Molar mass of F₂⁻: The atomic mass of F is about 19 g/mol, so F₂ is 38 g/mol. Since it's F₂⁻, the molar mass is approximately 38 g/mol (the mass of an electron is negligible compared to the nuclei).

M = 0.038 kg/mol.

T = 298 K.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J s.

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K.

R = 8.314 J/mol K.

P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

Now, the formula for molar translational entropy is:

S_trans = R ln [ (2 π m k T / h² )^(3/2) * (k T / P )^(1) ) ]

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The translational partition function q_trans is given by:

q_trans = (V / Λ³) * (2 π m k T / h² )^(3/2),

where Λ is the thermal de Broglie wavelength.

But for molar entropy, I think it's better to use the formula for S_trans:

S_trans = R ln(q_trans) + (3/2 R) T.

Wait no, S_trans is calculated using the partition function. The entropy from translation is given by:

S_trans = R ln(q_trans) + ( (3/2) R ) T / T ?

Wait, perhaps the expression is:

S_trans = R ( ln(q_trans) ) + ( (5/2) R ) T

Wait, no, maybe I should recall that the entropy is given by:

S = (U - F) / T,

where F is the Helmholtz free energy, but perhaps that's getting me away from the solution.

Alternatively, the translational entropy can be found using the formula:

S_trans = (5/2) R ln(T) - R ln(P) + R ln(M) + (3/2 R) ln(2 π k R / h²) )

Wait, perhaps that's the correct formula. Let me break it down.

Where M is the molar mass in kg/mol.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers:

M = 0.038 kg/mol.

T = 298 K.

P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So,

First term: (5/2) R ln(T)
= (5/2) * 8.314 * ln(298)
ln(298) ≈ 5.7004
= (2.5) * 8.314 * 5.7004 ≈ 2.5 * 8.314 ≈ 20.785 * 5.7004 ≈ 20.785 *5=103.925, 20.785 *0.7004≈14.549 → total ≈ 118.474 J/mol K.

Second term: - R ln(P)
= -8.314 * ln(101325)
ln(101325) ≈ 11.512 (since e^11 ≈ 59874, e^11.5 ≈ 98,000 approx)
So, 8.314 * 11.512 ≈ 95.64. So the term is -95.64 J/mol K.

Third term: R ln(M)
=8.314 * ln(0.038)
ln(0.038) is approximately -3.271 (since e^-3= ~0.05, so 0.038 is a bit less)
So, 8.314 * (-3.271) ≈ -27.22 J/mol K.

Fourth term: (3/2 R) ln(2 π k R / h²)
Let me compute this term.

Compute 2 π k R / h²:

k=1.38e-23 J/K

R=8.314 J/mol K

h=6.626e-34 J s

So,

2 π * 1.38e-23 * 8.314 / (6.626e-34)^2

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 * π ≈6.2832, *1.38e-23=6.2832 *1.38e-23 ≈ 8.66e-23.

Then multiply by 8.314: 8.66e-23 *8.314 ≈7.20e-22.

Denominator: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈4.39e-67.

So, 7.20e-22 /4.39e-67 ≈1.64e45.

Take ln(1.64e45) = ln(1.64) + 45 ln(10) ≈ 0.496 + 45 *2.3026 ≈ 0.496 + 103.617 ≈ 104.113.

So, (3/2 R) * 104.113 = (1.5 *8.314) *104.113 ≈12.471 *104.113 ≈1298.3 J/mol K.

Now, putting all terms together:

118.474 -95.64 -27.22 +1298.3.

Adding up:

118.474 -95.64 =22.834

22.834 -27.22 =-4.386

-4.386 +1298.3≈1293.914 J/mol K.

Wait, that seems high. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I did the formula correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

S_trans = (5/2 R) ln(T) - R ln(P) + R ln(M) + (3/2 R) ln( (h²)/(2 π m k T) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I inverted something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach. The formula for entropy from translational motion is:

S_trans = R ln( ( (2 π m k T)^(3/2) V ) / (n h^3) ) )

But for molar entropy, V is the molar volume. At standard conditions, for ideal gas, V = RT/P.

So, S_trans = R ln( ( (2 π m k T)^(3/2) * (RT/P) ) / (h^3) ) )

Simplify:

= R ln( (2 π m k T)^(3/2) RT / (P h^3) ) )

= R ln( (2 π m k T)^(3/2) ) + R ln( RT/(P h^3) )

= (3/2 R) ln(2 π m k T) + R ln(RT/(P h^3)) )

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula:

S_trans = (5/2) R ln(T) - R ln(P) + R ln(M) + (3/2 R) ln(2 π k R / h² )

Wait, but when I calculated that, I got a value around 1293 J/mol K, which seems too high because total entropy for F₂⁻ would be higher than that, but looking at the options, the highest is 250 J/K mol, so I must have made a mistake.

Ah, wait! Because F₂⁻ is a diatomic ion, the translational entropy is similar to a diatomic molecule, but I think I forgot to account for the fact that F₂⁻ is a diatomic. Wait, no, the translational entropy is just for the movement of the molecule as a whole, whether it's diatomic or not. So the translational entropy calculation I did above should still be valid.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me double-check the calculation for the last term, the (3/2 R) ln(...).

Wait, let me recompute 2 π k R / h².

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J s.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

R=8.314 J/mol K.

So,

2 π k R = 2 * π *1.38e-23 *8.314.

Let me compute that:

2 * π ≈6.2832.

6.2832 *1.38e-23 = approx 8.66e-23.

8.66e-23 *8.314 = approx 7.20e-22.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67.

So 2 π k R / h² =7.20e-22 /4.39e-67 ≈1.64e45.

Taking the natural log of 1.64e45: ln(1.64) is about 0.496, and ln(1e45)=ln(e^(45 ln10)) )=45 * ln(10)=45 *2.3026≈103.617. So ln(1.64e45)=0.496+103.617≈104.113.

So, (3/2 R) * 104.113 = (1.5 *8.314) *104.113.

1.5 *8.314≈12.471.

12.471 *104.113 ≈ 1300 J/mol K.

Wait, but this seems way too high because the other terms are in the hundreds. So when I add all the terms, I get around 1294 J/mol K, which is way higher than the options given. But the options are all around 160-250 J/mol K. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the formula. Maybe the correct formula for molar translational entropy is:

S_trans = (3/2 R) ln(T) + R ln(M) + (3/2 R) ln( (2 π k R)/h² ) - R ln(P)

Ah, maybe I misplaced the terms. Let me try that.

So,

(3/2 R) ln(T) =1.5 *8.314 * ln(298).

ln(298)=5.7004.

So 1.5 *8.314=12.471, 12.471 *5.7004≈71.09 J/mol K.

R ln(M) =8.314 * ln(0.038)=8.314*(-3.271)= -27.22 J/mol K.

(3/2 R) ln(2 π k R / h² )= (3/2)*8.314 * ln(1.64e45)=12.471 *104.113≈1298 J/mol K.

Then, - R ln(P)= -8.314 *11.512≈-95.64 J/mol K.

So adding these up:

71.09 -27.22 +1298 -95.64.

71.09 -27.22 =43.87.

43.87 +1298=1341.87.

1341.87 -95.64≈1246.23 J/mol K.

But again, this is over 1000, which doesn't match the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong units for pressure. Maybe I should use P in Pascals, but wait, I did. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses pressure in terms of concentration (n/V), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for molar translational entropy is simpler.

Wait, I found in my notes that the standard molar translational entropy can be calculated using:

S_trans° = (3/2) R ln(M) + (3/2 R) ln(T) + R ln(RT/(P h³ (2π)^{3/2} m^{3/2} )) )

Wait, I'm getting too confused. Maybe I should try another approach. Since the options are in the range of 160-250 J/mol K, perhaps the translational entropy is around 130, and the rotational and vibrational add up to around 70, giving a total of 200, but I'm just guessing.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard formula for the entropy contributions for diatomic molecules. The total entropy is the sum of translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions.

The formula for each contribution is as follows:

1. Translational (S_trans):

S_trans = (3/2) R ln(M) + (3/2 R) ln(T) + R ln( (2 π k R )/(h² P) )^{3/2} )

Wait, I'm not getting this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the value of S_trans for F₂ and adjust, but since F₂⁻ is an anion, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the partition functions for each mode.

The entropy is given by S = R ln(q) + ... for each mode.

Wait, the total entropy is the sum of the entropy contributions from translation, rotation, vibration, and electronic states.

So, let me calculate each contribution step by step.

1. Translational entropy (S_trans):

The translational partition function is q_trans = (V)(2πmkT/h²)^(3/2).

But for molar entropy, we can write:

S_trans = R ln( q_trans ) + (3/2 R) T.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the molar translational entropy is given by:

S_trans = (3/2 R) ln(M) + (5/2 R) ln(T) - R ln(P) + C,

where C is a constant involving R, h, and k.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

S_trans = R ln( (2 π m k T)^{3/
