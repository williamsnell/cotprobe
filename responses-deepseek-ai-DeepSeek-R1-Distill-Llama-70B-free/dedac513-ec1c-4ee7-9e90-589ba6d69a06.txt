Okay, so I've got this question about a mine hoist and selecting the right wire rope and sheave. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is in two parts: part (a) asks to select a 6x19 plow steel wire rope and specify the minimum sheave diameter. Part (b) is about calculating the number of bends to failure for that setup.

First, I remember that wire ropes are specified by their diameter, and the sheave diameter is related to that. I think there's a formula or standard ratio that determines the minimum sheave diameter based on the rope diameter. I think it's something like the sheave diameter being at least 40 times the rope diameter? Or wait, maybe it's 42 times? Not sure. Or perhaps it depends on the application. Mine hoists are pretty heavy-duty, so maybe the ratio is higher.

Then, for the number of bends to failure, I recall that the 6x19 classification refers to the number of wires. 6 strands with 19 wires each, right? But wait, 6x19 isn't the same as, say, 6x7. The 6x19 is more flexible, I think. The number of bends is related to the fatigue life of the rope. There's a formula for that too. I think it's based on the rope diameter and the sheave diameter. The formula I remember is N = (D/d)^3 * 100,000, where D is the sheave diameter and d is the rope diameter. Wait, no, maybe it's (D/d)^2. Or wait, the formula might be N = (D/d)^3 * k, where k is a factor. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me try to break it down. For part (a), selecting a 6x19 plow steel wire rope. Plow steel is a type of wire rope, probably with a specific tensile strength. The 6x19 indicates the construction: 6 strands with 19 wires each. So, the rope diameter is one of the options given. Looking at the options, the diameters vary between 1/2 in, 3/4 in, 7/8 in, and 1 in.

Next, the sheave diameter. The minimum sheave diameter is important because it affects the bending stress in the rope. A larger sheave reduces the stress, so the rope lasts longer. I think the rule of thumb is that the sheave diameter should be at least 40 times the rope diameter. So, for each rope diameter in the options, I can calculate the minimum sheave diameter.

Let's check each option:

Option A: Rope diameter 1 in. Sheave diameter 22 in. So 22 /1 =22. That's way less than 40. So this might not be acceptable. But wait, maybe the factor is different. Maybe it's 20 times? 1*20=20, which is less than 22. So 22 is acceptable if the factor is 20. Alternatively, perhaps for mine hoists, the factor is higher, like 30 or 40. So 22 would be insufficient for 40.

Option B: Rope is 0.5 in. Sheave is 18 in. 18/0.5 =36. So if the factor is 36, then minimum sheave is 18. But if the required factor is 40, then 0.5*40=20, which is less than 18? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.5 *40=20 inches. So sheave must be at least 20. But option B has sheave 18, which is less than 20, so that would not meet the requirement. So option B might be invalid.

Option C: Rope is 7/8 in. Sheave is 21 in. 7/8 is 0.875. 0.875 *40=35 inches. But sheave here is 21, which is less than 35. So that would not meet the 40 factor requirement. So this sheave diameter isn't enough. Unless the factor is lower, like 24 or something. 0.875 *24=21. So that would fit. So if the factor is 24, which I think is sometimes used, then 21 is okay. But I thought the standard was higher for mine applications.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard for sheave diameter in hoisting might require D/d ratio. I think for mine hoists, the ratio is about 40:1. So D must be at least 40 times the rope diameter. Let me check each option again with this ratio.

Option A: D=22, d=1 → 22/1=22 <40. Not enough. So sheave too small.

Option B: D=18, d=0.5 → 36. 36>40? No, 36 is less than 40. So sheave diameter would need to be 20 in (0.5*40=20). So 18 is too small. So option B is invalid.

Option C: D=21, d=0.875 → 21/0.875=24. So 24 <40. So sheave is too small. So sheave needs to be at least 35 inches. So option C isn't correct.

Option D: D=20, d=0.75 →20/0.75≈26.67. Hmm, that's still less than 40. So sheave is too small. So this can't be correct either.

Wait, but none of the options meet the 40:1 ratio. Hmm. Maybe I'm remembering the ratio wrong. Maybe it's 20:1, but that seems too low. Or perhaps it's 30:1. Let me see.

If the ratio is 30:1:

Option A: 22/1=22 <30. Not enough.

Option B: 18/0.5=36>30 → okay.

Option C: 21/0.875=24 <30. No.

Option D:20/0.75≈26.67 <30. No.

So only option B would satisfy a 30:1 ratio. But I thought the standard was higher. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up different applications. Maybe for mine hoists, the ratio is 42:1? Or is it based on the wire rope's classification?

Wait, another approach: Maybe the minimum sheave diameter is determined by the rope's diameter and the number of strands or wires. Alternatively, perhaps the 6x19 classification has a specific minimum sheave diameter. I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the selection is based on the safe working load and the strength of the rope.

Wait, the mine hoist can lift a maximum load of 5 tons. Wait, that's 10,000 lbs. So the rope must be able to handle that load, considering safety factors. So perhaps I should calculate the required rope diameter based on the breaking strength.

I think the formula for the rope strength is important here. The breaking strength for a wire rope is given by the formula:

Breaking Strength (lbs) = (d^2) * (factor) * (number of strands) * (number of wires per strand)

Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is:

Breaking Strength = (0.5 * d^2) * (number of strands) * (number of wires per strand) * (tensile strength of wire material)

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the breaking strength can be calculated using the formula:

Breaking Strength (BS) = (n * d^2) * (factor) 

Where n is the number of ropes or wires, and d is diameter. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the typical breaking strengths for 6x19 ropes. But since I can't, I have to rely on my memory. 6x19 plow steel ropes are commonly used in mining. The 6x19 indicates more wires, so more flexible but perhaps lower strength compared to a 6x7? Or maybe it's stronger? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the WLL (Working Load Limit) is usually 1/5 of the breaking strength. So if the hoist's maximum load is 5 tons (10,000 lbs), then the rope's breaking strength must be at least 50,000 lbs (since 10,000 *5 =50,000).

So I need to find a 6x19 plow steel rope with a breaking strength of at least 50,000 lbs. Let's think about the diameters.

Typically, a 1-inch diameter 6x19 plow steel rope might have a breaking strength of around 50,000 to 60,000 lbs. A 3/4 inch might be around 30,000. 7/8 inch maybe around 45,000. Let me see.

Wait, for example:

- 1/2 inch: Breaking strength could be about 20,000 lbs.

- 3/4 inch: Around 35,000 lbs.

- 7/8 inch: Approximately 45,000 lbs.

- 1 inch: About 55,000 lbs.

So, for a 5-ton (10,000 lbs) load, the rope's WLL must be at least 10,000 lbs, but the breaking strength needs to be five times that, so 50,000 lbs. So the minimum breaking strength required is 50,000 lbs. So the rope diameter must be such that its breaking strength is at least 50,000 lbs.

Looking at the options, let's check which ropes meet this:

Option A: 1 inch. Breaking strength around 55,000 → okay.

Option C: 7/8 inch. Breaking strength maybe 45,000 → just under. So not enough.

Option D: 3/4 inch. Breaking strength 35,000 → too low.

Option B: 1/2 inch → 20,000 → way too low.

So only options A and C and D may be close. Wait, option C is 7/8 inch. If the required breaking strength is 50,000, and 7/8 inch gives 45,000, that's not enough. So only option A has a 1-inch rope, which gives 55,000, meeting the requirement.

So part (a) would require selecting a 1-inch diameter rope. Now, the sheave diameter. If the minimum sheave diameter is 40 times the rope diameter, then 1 inch *40=40 inches. But none of the options have a 40-inch sheave. Wait, but the options are A: sheave 22, B:18, C:21, D:20.

Hmm. So none of the sheaves in the options meet 40 times. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ratio. Maybe it's 20 times? 1 inch *20=20 inches. So option D has 20 inches. But option D's rope is 3/4 inch, which as per earlier would have breaking strength maybe 35,000, which is less than the needed 50,000. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up rope strength. Alternatively, perhaps the 7/8 inch rope has a higher breaking strength. Let me think again. If 1 inch is 55,000, 7/8 is maybe 50,000. So 7/8 inch would meet the 50,000 requirement.

So if the rope is 7/8 inch, then the sheave diameter should be at least 40 * 7/8 =35 inches. But the option C has sheave diameter 21 inches, which is way below 35. So that can't be.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the sheave diameter is 20 times the rope diameter. So for 7/8 inch, 7/8*20=17.5 inches. So sheave would need to be at least 18 inches. Option C has 21, which is more than enough. But does the rope in C have enough breaking strength?

If 7/8 inch gives 45,000, which is less than the required 50,000. So that's not enough. So perhaps the correct rope is 1 inch, which gives 55,000. Then sheave needs to be at least 40 inches. But none of the options have that.

Wait, maybe the sheave is 24 times the rope diameter. So 1 inch *24=24. So sheave of 22 inches (option A) is less than 24. So again, doesn't meet.

I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the sheave diameter is 42 times the rope diameter, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the minimum sheave is determined by the rope construction. For a 6x19 rope, the sheave diameter is often 20 times the rope diameter. So 1 inch *20=20 inches. So sheave must be at least 20 inches. So option D has sheave 20, rope 3/4 inch. Let's see.

If the rope is 3/4 inch, then 3/4 *20=15. Sheave is 20, which is more than 15. So that's okay. But the breaking strength of 3/4 inch is 35,000, which is less than 50,000 needed. So that won't work.

Alternatively, if sheave is 20 inches, then the maximum rope diameter allowed would be 20/20=1 inch. So 1 inch rope, sheave 20. Then the breaking strength is 55,000, which is enough. But in the options, the only sheave 20 inch is option D, which uses a 3/4 inch rope. So that's not matching. 

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's reevaluate.

The problem says to select a 6x19 plow steel wire rope for the hoist. So we need to pick the correct diameter from the options. Considering the 5-ton load, the rope must have a breaking strength of at least 50,000 lbs. So which diameter in the options gives that?

Option A: 1 inch. Breaking strength, as I thought, around 55,000. So that's sufficient.

Option C: 7/8 inch. Maybe 45,000, which is not enough.

So the rope should be 1 inch, which is option A. Then the sheave must be at least 40 times the rope diameter, which is 40 inches, but the option A sheave is only 22 inches. That's way below. So none of the options fit this scenario. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the sheave diameter is chosen based on another factor. Maybe it's 24 times for 6x19 ropes. So 1 inch *24=24 inches. So option A's sheave is 22, which is less than 24. So sheave is insufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is 20, so 20 inches. So sheave needs to be 20 inches. So option D has sheave 20. But its rope is 3/4 inch. Let me check the breaking strength for 3/4 inch. If it's 35,000, which is less than 50,000, so it can't handle the load. So that's no good.

So perhaps the correct choice is option A, but the sheave is undersized. Alternatively, maybe the correct sheave is 24 inches, which is not in the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sheave is 42 times the rope diameter. So 1 inch *42=42. Not in the options. So this is getting me nowhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sheave diameter requirement. Maybe it's the other way around, that the sheave must be at least a certain multiple of the rope's diameter. Let's think differently: perhaps the minimum sheave diameter D is given by D = k * d, where k is a constant.

I think for a 6x19 rope, the minimum sheave diameter is 20 times the rope diameter. So D =20d.

So, let's compute D for each option's rope.

Option A: d=1, D=20*1=20. But the option has D=22, which is larger than 20. So that's acceptable.

Option B: d=0.5, D=10. But option B has D=18, which is larger.

Option C: d=0.875, D=17.5. Option C's D is 21, which is larger.

Option D: d=0.75, D=15. Option D's sheave is 20, which is larger.

So all options except B have sheaves larger than 20d. Wait, no. For option B, d=0.5, 20d=10. Sheave is 18, which is larger than 10. So sheave is acceptable.

Wait, but the problem is to select a 6x19 rope and specify the sheave. So perhaps the correct approach is to select the rope first, then calculate the minimum sheave.

So, the rope must have a breaking strength of at least 50,000 lbs, which requires a 1-inch rope. So sheave must be at least 20 inches. So looking for an option where rope is 1 inch and sheave is at least 20 inches.

Looking back at the options, option A has rope 1 inch, sheave 22 inches. So that fits. The sheave is 22, which is more than 20, so that's acceptable.

But earlier, I thought the sheave needed to be 40 times, but perhaps for 6x19, it's 20 times. So 20*1=20. So sheave 22 is acceptable.

So part (a) would select option A. Now, part (b) is to calculate the number of bends to failure for the selected rope and sheave.

The formula for the number of bends to failure is N = (D/d)^3 * 100,000. Or wait, perhaps it's (D/d)^2 * 100,000. I'm not sure, but I think it's (D/d)^3 multiplied by a constant.

Wait, I think the formula is N = (D/d)^3 * 100,000. Or is it another base number? Alternatively, I've heard that for each 6x19 rope, the approximate number of bends is (D/d)^3 * 100,000.

So for option A, D=22, d=1.

So (22/1)^3 = 10626. Multiply by 100,000 → 1,062,600,000. That's way higher than any of the options. Wait, but the options have numbers like 60,000, 30,000, etc.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Another approach: The number of bends to failure can be estimated using the formula N = (D/d)^2 * (number of
