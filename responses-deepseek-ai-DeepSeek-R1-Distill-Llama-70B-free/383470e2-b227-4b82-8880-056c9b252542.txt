Okay, so I've got this problem about pulleys and belt drives. Hmm, I remember that when two pulleys are connected by a belt, their speeds are related to their diameters. Let me think about how that works. Oh right, the bigger the pulley, the slower it turns, right? Because the smaller pulley has to spin faster to keep up with the larger one.

The problem says the driver pulley is 8 inches in diameter and rotates at 500 rpm. The driven pulley is 15 inches. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the driver is the one doing the work, so the 8-inch pulley is the driver, and it's connected to the 15-inch pulley, which is the driven. So the 15-inch one will rotate slower.

I think the formula is that the speed of the driver multiplied by its diameter equals the speed of the driven multiplied by its diameter. Or wait, is it the product of speed and diameter that's the same for both? Because the linear speed at the edge (the belt speed) should be the same if there's no slip.

So the formula should be: N1 * D1 = N2 * D2, where N is rpm and D is diameter. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no. Wait, the linear speed v = πDN, right? So v1 = v2 when there's no slip. So π D1 N1 = π D2 N2. Oh yeah, the π cancels out. So D1 N1 = D2 N2. So N2 = (D1/D2) * N1.

Wait, let me double-check that. If D1 is bigger than D2, then N2 would be smaller than N1, which makes sense because a bigger pulley would turn slower. So in our case, the driver is D1 =8 inches, N1=500 rpm. The driven is D2=15 inches. So N2 = (8 / 15) * 500.

Calculating that: 8/15 is about 0.5333... Multiply by 500 gives 266.666... So approximately 266.67 rpm.

But wait, the question has two parts: one for no slip, and then for a 2% loss. So the first part is straightforward, no slip, so the speed is about 266.67 rpm. Looking at the options, let's see. Option E is 265, option B is 261.4, option D is 275, option I is 290. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, the problem says "determine the speed of the driver pulley." Wait, wait. Wait, I thought the driver is the smaller pulley. So if the driver is 8 inches, then the driven is 15 inches. So in the no-slip condition, the driven pulley's speed is 266.67 rpm, which is slower than the driver. But the question is about the driver's speed. Wait, no, the driver's speed is given as 500 rpm. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question says "the speed of the driver pulley" when there's no slip and then with slip. Wait, wait, maybe I misread the question.

Wait, the problem states: "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip..." Wait, no, that can't be. Because the driver's speed is given as 500 rpm. So perhaps I misread. Let me look again.

"A pulley 8 in. in diameter rotates at 500 rpm and drives a 15 in. diameter pulley. Determine the speed of the driver pulley..."

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The driver's speed is given as 500 rpm. Unless I misread which pulley is which. Oh wait, maybe the 8-inch pulley is the driven, and the 15-inch is the driver? Because usually, the driver is the larger one, but no, it depends on the setup. Wait, no, the driver is the one that's connected to the motor, so it could be either.

Wait, the problem says the 8-inch pulley rotates at 500 rpm and drives the 15-inch. So the 8-inch is the driver, 500 rpm, drives the 15-inch (which is the driven). So in no slip, the driven's speed is (8/15)*500 = 266.666 rpm.

Wait, but the question is about the driver's speed. So if there's no slip, the driver's speed remains 500 rpm? That doesn't make sense. Unless I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the 8-inch pulley is the one being driven, and the 15-inch is the driver? No, because it says the 8-inch drives the 15-inch. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me read again. It says, "A pulley 8 in. in diameter rotates at 500 rpm and drives a 15 in. diameter pulley." So the 8-inch pulley is the driver, providing 500 rpm, and the 15-inch is driven. So the problem is asking for the speed of the driver pulley under two conditions. Wait, but the driver's speed is given as 500. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the speed of the driven pulley? Because the way the question is phrased: "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip..." No, the driver's speed is already given. Unless perhaps it's a typo, and it should be the driven. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the problem wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the speed of the driver when considering slip. Wait, but in no slip condition, the driver's speed is given as 500. But maybe the problem is saying that the driver's speed is what's to be found. No, that doesn't make sense. Because the driver's speed is given as 500 rpm. So perhaps the question is actually about the driven pulley's speed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should read the question again carefully. The question says: "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip between the pulley and the belt and then for a total loss (slip and creep) of 2%."

Wait, that doesn't make sense. The driver's speed is given as 500 rpm. So the question must be misphrased, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the speed of the driven pulley, but the wording is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the speed of the driver pulley when there's a loss, meaning considering that the belt slips, so the driver's speed changes? No, that doesn't make sense because the driver's speed is set by the motor. Wait, maybe the driver's speed is the one that's causing the driven to go at a certain speed, but with losses, the driven's speed is less than the no-slip case. So perhaps the question is asking, given the driver's speed, what is the driven's speed in no slip, and then with 2% loss.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the driver's speed in both cases. Hmm, that's confusing. Or perhaps the question is the other way around, and it's the driven pulley whose speed is to be found. So I'm a bit stuck on the wording.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 8-inch pulley is the driver, and the 15-inch is the driven, and the question is asking about the driven's speed. Let's proceed under that assumption because otherwise the question doesn't make sense.

So no slip: driven speed N2 = (D1/D2) * N1 = (8/15)*500 = 266.666... So approximately 266.67 rpm. The options are E:265, B:261.4, D:275, etc. So 266.67 is close to option E:265 or perhaps option not present. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 8 divided by 15 is 0.5333... Multiply by 500 gives 266.666... So 266 and two-thirds rpm. The options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options. The options are: A:280, B:261.4, C:250, D:275, E:265, F:225, G:240, H:300, I:290, J:315.

So the closest is E:265, but it's 266.67. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question says the 15-inch is the driver. Because if that's the case, then the driven would be 8 inches, and the speed would be higher.

Wait, maybe I got the driver and driven mixed up. Let me read the problem again. It says, "A pulley 8 in. in diameter rotates at 500 rpm and drives a 15 in. diameter pulley." So 8-inch pulley is doing the driving, 500 rpm, connected to 15-inch. So driven is 15-inch. So no slip, N2 = (8/15)*500 = approx 266.67 rpm. So in the options, the closest is E:265. But perhaps the exact calculation is (8*500)/15 = 4000/15 = 266.666... So 266.67, which isn't exactly an option, but E is 265.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is reversed, and the 15-inch pulley is the driver. Then N2 would be (15/8)*500 = 937.5 rpm, but that's not in the options either.

Wait, but the question is about the driver pulley's speed. So if in the first case, no slip, the driver is 500 rpm. Then with 2% loss, perhaps the driver's speed is adjusted? That doesn't make sense because the driver is typically the one connected to the motor, so its speed is fixed. Unless the loss is on the driver side, but that's unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the belt's speed is the same in both pulleys, but with some loss due to slip and creep, so the driven pulley's speed is less than the no-slip condition. So the question is about finding the driven pulley's speed in both cases. So perhaps the question has a typo, and it's the driven pulley's speed they're asking for, not the driver's.

Assuming that's the case, let's proceed. In the no-slip scenario, N2 = (8/15)*500 ≈ 266.67 rpm. So the answer would be approximately 266.67, but the options have E as 265, which is close. But perhaps I should check for exact value.

Wait, 8/15 is 0.533333..., 0.533333 *500 = 266.666... So 266.666... So the first part would be 266.67 rpm. Now, the second part is for a total loss of 2%. Hmm, how does that affect the speed?

Wait, when there's slip and creep, the driven pulley's speed decreases because the belt is moving faster relative to the pulley. So the effective speed of the driven pulley would be less than the no-slip case. So the loss is 2%, meaning the driven pulley's speed is 2% less than the no-slip value.

Wait, so with 2% loss, the speed would be 266.67 * (1 - 0.02) = 266.67 * 0.98 = let's calculate that.

266.67 *0.98: 266.67 *1 =266.67, 266.67 *0.02=5.333, so subtracting gives 261.33 rpm. So approximately 261.33 rpm.

Looking at the options, B is 261.4, which is very close. So the two answers would be approximately 266.67 (E:265 is close but not exact) and 261.33 (B:261.4). But wait, the options don't have both. Wait, but the question is phrased as two parts: the first part (no slip) and the second part (2% loss).

Wait, but the question says "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip...". Wait, I'm getting confused again. If the driver is the 8-inch pulley, then the no-slip speed would be 500 rpm, and with 2% loss, it would be... Wait, but the driver's speed is set by the motor, so losses wouldn't change that. Unless the loss is in the driver pulley's efficiency, which would mean that the belt's speed is less than the driver's surface speed.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the belt's linear speed. The linear speed v = π D N. In no slip, the belt speed is same on both pulleys. So v = π *8*500 = 4000 π. For the driven pulley, N2 = v/(π D2) )= (4000 π)/(15 π) )= 4000/15 ≈266.67 rpm.

In the case of 2% loss, perhaps the belt's speed relative to the pulley is reduced. But how does that translate into the driven pulley's speed? Alternatively, perhaps the loss refers to the overall efficiency, meaning that the driven pulley's speed is 2% less than the no-slip case. So N2 = 266.67 *0.98 ≈261.33 rpm.

So the two answers would be 266.67 rpm and 261.33 rpm. Now, looking at the options, the first is near E:265, but not exact. The second is near B:261.4.

But the question is asking for the driver pulley's speed, which doesn't make sense because the driver's speed is given as 500 rpm. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the driven pulley's speed under the two conditions. So the correct answers would be approximately 266.67 rpm (no slip) and 261.33 rpm (with loss). So looking for two answers, but the options only give one choice. Wait, but the problem is a multiple-choice with one correct answer, so perhaps I misread the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the speed of the driver pulley when including the losses, but that doesn't make sense because the driver's speed is set by the motor. Unless the driver is the larger pulley, but the problem says the driver is 8 inches.

Wait, maybe the question is to find the speed of the driven pulley, and the options include the correct values. So the first part (no slip) is ~266.67, but the closest option is E:265. The second part is ~261.33, which matches option B:261.4.

But the question is phrased as a single answer. Oh wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the driven pulley's speed in the two scenarios, but the options are given as separate choices.

Wait, the problem says "Determine the speed of the driver pulley for a condition of no slip and then for a total loss of 2%." But that doesn't make sense because the driver's speed is given. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the belt's speed, but the options don't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the speed of the driver pulley when the driven pulley has a loss. But the driver's speed shouldn't change, so that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the belt's speed. In no slip, the belt speed is 4000 π (from 8 inches at 500 rpm). But that's not relevant to the options given.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try an alternative approach. Maybe I should consider that the driver pulley's speed is 500 rpm, and the driven pulley's speed is 266.67 rpm in no slip, and 261.33 rpm with 2% loss. But the question is asking for the driver's speed, which is 500 in the first case and perhaps 500 adjusted in the second. That doesn't make sense because the driver's speed is set.

Wait, maybe the 2% loss is the efficiency, so the actual speed of the driven pulley is 2% less than the no-slip calculation. So the no-slip speed is 266.67, and with 2% loss, it's 261.33. So the answer would be approximately 261.33 rpm, which matches option B:261.4.

But the question is about the driver's speed. This is really confusing. Maybe the question has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the question is asking for the driven pulley's speed, and the correct answers are E and B. But since the options are single letters, perhaps the intended answers are E and B. But the question seems to present a single answer. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the driver's speed when the driven pulley has a 2% loss. But that doesn't change the driver's speed. So perhaps the intended answer is E:265 rpm as the no-slip case of the driven pulley, and B:261.4 for the loss case. But the question is phrased as a single answer, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when there is slip, the driver pulley's speed increases because the belt is moving faster than the pulley surface. But that's not how it works. The driver's speed is set by the motor. The driven pulley's speed would decrease due to losses.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the speed of the driver pulley when considering that the driven pulley has a certain speed. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the options that match the calculated values.

In the no-slip case, the driven pulley's speed is 266.67 rpm. The closest option is E:265. With a 2% loss, it's 261.33 rpm, which is option B:261.4.

So perhaps the answers are E and B, but the question is presented as two separate parts. However, the options are given as a single choice. So perhaps the intended answer for no slip is E (265), and for 2% loss it's B (261.4). But the question says "the speed of the driver pulley", which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the speed of the driver pulley when it's the larger one. Let me recalculate assuming the 15-inch pulley is the driver.

If the driver is 15 inches and N1 is 500 rpm, then the driven
