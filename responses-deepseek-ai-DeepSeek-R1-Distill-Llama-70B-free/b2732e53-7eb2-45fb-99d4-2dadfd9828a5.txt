Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the break-even points for different cost and revenue equations. Hmm, I remember that the break-even point is where the cost equals the revenue. So, I need to set C equal to R for each part and solve for x, which represents the number of units.

Let's start with part (a): C = $10x + $600 and R = $30x. So, I'll set them equal. 10x + 600 = 30x. Subtract 10x from both sides, that gives 600 = 20x. Divide both sides by 20, so x = 30. Wait, 30 units? Let me check. 30 times 30 is 900, and 10*30 is 300 plus 600 is 900. Yep, that works.

Moving on to part (b): C = $5x + $200 and R = $8x. Setting them equal: 5x + 200 = 8x. Subtract 5x to get 200 = 3x. So x is 200/3, which is approximately 66.666... So that's 66 and two-thirds units. Wait, I should write that as a fraction, maybe 66 2/3.

Next, part (c): C = $0.2x + $50, R = $0.3x. Setting equal: 0.2x +50 = 0.3x. Subtract 0.2x, so 50 = 0.1x. Hmm, 0.1x is 50, so x is 50 / 0.1 = 500. So 500 units.

Now part (d): C = $1800x + $3000, R = $2500x. Setting equal: 1800x + 3000 = 2500x. Subtract 1800x, 3000 = 700x. So x is 3000 /700. Let's compute that. 3000 divided by 700. 700*4 is 2800, so 3000-2800 is 200. 200/700 is 2/7. So that's 4 and 2/7 units. Wait, no, 3000/700 is 300/70, which simplifies to 30/7. Oh wait, 30 divided by 7 is 4 with a remainder of 2. So yes, 4 and 2/7 units.

Now I need to match these answers to the options provided. Let's list what I have:

(a) 30 units

(b) 66 2/3 units

(c) 500 units

(d) 4 2/7 units.

Looking at the options, each option gives four values in the order a, b, c, d.

Looking through the options:

Option I says: 30, 66(2/3), 500, 4(2/7). That matches exactly what I calculated.

Wait, let me double-check each part. For (a), yes, 30 units. (b) 66 2/3. (c) 500. (d) 4 2/7. So I think Option I is the correct one.

To determine the break-even point for each scenario, we set the cost (C) equal to the revenue (R) and solve for \( x \), the number of units. Here's the analysis:

1. **Part (a):**  
   \( C = 10x + 600 \), \( R = 30x \)  
   Setting \( C = R \):  
   \[
   10x + 600 = 30x \implies 600 = 20x \implies x = 30 \, \text{units}.
   \]

2. **Part (b):**  
   \( C = 5x + 200 \), \( R = 8x \)  
   Setting \( C = R \):  
   \[
   5x + 200 = 8x \implies 200 = 3x \implies x = \frac{200}{3} = 66 \frac{2}{3} \, \text{units}.
   \]

3. **Part (c):**  
   \( C = 0.2x + 50 \), \( R = 0.3x \)  
   Setting \( C = R \):  
   \[
   0.2x + 50 = 0.3x \implies 50 = 0.1x \implies x = \frac{50}{0.1} = 500 \, \text{units}.
   \]

4. **Part (d):**  
   \( C = 1800x + 3000 \), \( R = 2500x \)  
   Setting \( C = R \):  
   \[
   1800x + 3000 = 2500x \implies 3000 = 700x \implies x = \frac{3000}{700} = \frac{30}{7} = 4 \frac{2}{7} \, \text{units}.
   \]

The calculated break-even points are:  
- (a) 30 units  
- (b) \( 66 \frac{2}{3} \) units  
- (c) 500 units  
- (d) \( 4 \frac{2}{7} \) units  

Matching these results to the provided options, **Option I** corresponds exactly:  
- (a) 30 units  
- (b) \( 66 \frac{2}{3} \) units  
- (c) 500 units  
- (d) \( 4 \frac{2}{7} \) units
