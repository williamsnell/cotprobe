Question:

A model of a proposed low-speed crop-dusting plane is to be tested in a wind tunnel capable of maintaining velocities of 264 ft/s, using atmospheric air. The prototype plane has a design wing span of 27 ft and a proposed speed of 88 ft/s. In order to preserve dynamic similarity, what should be the wing span of the model if the wind tunnel is to operate at full speed? Assume the air at these low velocities to be essentially incompressible. In addition, assume that the temperature of atmospheric air and the temperature of the wind-tunnel air are the same.

Options:

A: 9 ft
B: 30 ft
C: 3 ft
D: 6 ft
E: 15 ft
F: 21 ft
G: 12 ft
H: 18 ft
I: 24 ft
J: 27 ft

Okay, so I've got this problem here about testing a model plane in a wind tunnel. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is about dynamic similarity, right? So I remember that dynamic similarity requires that the Reynolds numbers be the same for both the model and the prototype. Reynolds number is important because it determines whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, and it affects things like drag and lift.

Wait, the formula for Reynolds number is Re = (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity. Oh right, ν is kinematic viscosity. So Re_model should equal Re_prototype.

The wind tunnel uses atmospheric air, and the temperatures are the same, so the viscosity ν should be the same for both model and prototype. That simplifies things because ν cancels out in the equation.

So the equation becomes (V_model * L_model) = (V_prototype * L_prototype). Because the Re has to be the same, and ν is the same. So V_model * L_model = V_proto * L_proto.

Wait wait, no, wait. The model is in the wind tunnel. The wind tunnel is operating at 264 ft/s. The prototype's speed is 88 ft/s. So the model's speed is the wind tunnel speed, right? Because the model is placed in the tunnel, so the air flows over it at 264 ft/s.

So V_model is 264 ft/s. V_prototype is 88 ft/s.

We need to find L_model. We know the prototype's wing span is 27 ft. So substituting into the equation:

264 * L_model = 88 * 27.

Let me calculate 88 * 27. 80*27 is 2160, 8*27 is 216. So 2160+216=2376.

So 264 * L_model = 2376.

Then L_model = 2376 / 264. Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 24 maybe. 2376 /24 is 99, 264 /24 is 11. So 99/11 =9.

Wait, so L_model is 9 ft. Let me double-check the calculations. 264 divided by 88 is 3. So 264 is 3 times 88. So if the model's velocity is 3 times the prototype's, then the model's length should be the prototype's length divided by 3.

Because Re is proportional to V*L. So if V_model is 3 V_proto, then L_model should be L_proto / 3.

So 27 ft divided by 3 is 9 ft. So the model's wing span is 9 ft.

Looking at the options, option A is 9 ft. So the answer should be A.

To ensure dynamic similarity between the model and the prototype, the Reynolds numbers must be equal. The Reynolds number is given by:

\[
Re = \frac{V \cdot L}{\nu}
\]

where \(V\) is the velocity, \(L\) is the characteristic length (wing span in this case), and \(\nu\) is the kinematic viscosity of air. Since the temperature is the same for both the prototype and the model, \(\nu\) is constant and cancels out. This simplifies the condition for dynamic similarity to:

\[
V_{\text{model}} \cdot L_{\text{model}} = V_{\text{prototype}} \cdot L_{\text{prototype}}
\]

The wind tunnel operates at \(V_{\text{model}} = 264 \, \text{ft/s}\), and the prototype operates at \(V_{\text{prototype}} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}\). The prototype's wing span is \(L_{\text{prototype}} = 27 \, \text{ft}\). Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
264 \cdot L_{\text{model}} = 88 \cdot 27
\]

First, calculate \(88 \cdot 27\):

\[
88 \cdot 27 = 2376
\]

Now solve for \(L_{\text{model}}\):

\[
L_{\text{model}} = \frac{2376}{264} = 9 \, \text{ft}
\]

Thus, the wing span of the model should be 9 feet to preserve dynamic similarity. From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 9 ft**
