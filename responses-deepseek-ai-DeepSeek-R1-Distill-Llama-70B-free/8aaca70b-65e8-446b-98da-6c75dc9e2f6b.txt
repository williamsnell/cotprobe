Okay, so I have this question about when the first Jaina temples appeared. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that Jainism is one of the ancient religions of India, right? I think it's related to Hinduism but has its own set of beliefs. The founder, Mahavira, comes to mind. I believe he was a contemporary of the Buddha, who founded Buddhism. So if I can figure out when Mahavira lived, that might help.

Wait, when did Buddha live? I think he was around the 5th or 6th century BCE. So if Mahavira was his contemporary, he must have been around the same time. So that places Jainism's origins in the 6th or 5th century BCE. But the question is about the temples, not the founding of the religion itself.

Temples in ancient India, especially for religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, started appearing after the religions were established. So if Jainism began in the 5th or 6th century BCE, the temples probably came a bit later. But how much later?

I remember that in early Jainism, they might have used existing structures or natural sites for worship, like caves. Maybe the first built temples came a few centuries after the religion started. Let me think about the timeline of other religions' temples. For example, the first Buddhist stupas were built during the Mauryan Empire, around 3rd century BCE. So maybe Jaina temples started around the same time or a bit later.

Wait, another angle: I recall that some of the earliest Jaina temples are found in places like Dilwara in Rajasthan, but I think those are from the medieval period, like around the 11th to 13th centuries CE. But that's much later than the options given here. So perhaps the first temples were much earlier.

Looking at the options, let's see the choices. The options are spread across various centuries. Option D is 5th century BCE, which is around the time of Mahavira. But would temples have been built that early? Or did they take longer to develop.

Option H is 3rd century BCE. That's a century after Mahavira. Maybe the first temples started then. Alternatively, the 6th century BCE is too early because that's when Mahavira was alive, but the first temples might have been built by his followers after his death.

Wait, another thought: The Jains have a strong tradition of asceticism and might have initially focused more on monastic practices rather than building elaborate temples. So perhaps the construction of temples started after Jainism had established itself more firmly, maybe a few centuries after Mahavira.

So if Mahavira was in the 5th century BCE, the first temples could have been built a couple of centuries later. Looking at the options, let's see. Option H is 3rd century BCE, which is about two centuries after Mahavira. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe the first temples were even later. Let me think about the historical evidence. I remember that some of the earliest known Jaina temples are from the 1st century CE or so. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The first Jaina temples would have been simpler structures or perhaps rock-cut caves. The practice of building more elaborate temples might have developed over time. So maybe the first Jaina temples started around the time of the Mauryan Empire, which was in the 3rd century BCE. But I'm not certain.

Looking back at the options again, the choices for BCE are B (11th), F (10th), and D (5th), H (3rd). CE options include C (1st), E (2nd), G (6th), I (5th), J (8th), A (18th).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall any specific events or rulers associated with Jaina temples. I think that during the Gupta period (around 4th-6th century CE), a lot of temple building happened, including for Jains. But that's much later than some of the options.

Alternatively, the Satavahana dynasty, which was around 1st century BCE to 2nd century CE, might have patronized Jainism and built temples. So that would place the first temples in the 1st century CE or so.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember if there are any Jaina temples that are known to be from a very early period. I think the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha are Jaina, but I'm not sure of their dates. I believe they were built in the 1st or 2nd century CE.

So that would place the first Jaina temples around the 1st century CE. Looking at the options, that's option C.

But earlier I thought that maybe the first temples were in the 3rd century BCE, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the earliest Jaina temples were built in the 5th century BCE, right after Mahavira's time. But I'm not sure if there's evidence for that.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the timeline. Mahavira died around 527 BCE, and the Jains had a period of canon compilation and organization after that. Temple building as a significant practice might have started a bit later, perhaps a few centuries after.

So if the first Jaina temples appeared around the 3rd century BCE, that would be option H. Alternatively, if it's later, maybe 1st century CE, option C.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another angle: In Hinduism, the first temples started appearing around the Gupta period, which is 4th-5th century CE. But Jains and Buddhists had earlier structures. For example, the earliest Buddhist structures are from the Mauryan period, like Ashoka's pillars and stupas, around 3rd century BCE.

Jains might have started building their temples around the same time as the Buddhists. So perhaps the first Jaina temples were in the 3rd century BCE, making option H correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: The earliest Jaina images and temples are from the Kushan period, which is around 1st-3rd century CE. So that would make the first temples around the 1st century CE, which would be option C.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Let me try to recall any specific information or sources. I think that the first Jaina temples were built in the early centuries CE, so perhaps the 1st century CE.

Alternatively, some sources say that the earliest known Jaina temples date back to the 5th or 6th century CE, but that's later than the options given.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with the more famous ones. The earliest might have been much simpler and perhaps made of perishable materials, so they might not have survived. The stone temples probably started a bit later.

So putting it all together, I think the first Jaina temples appeared around the 1st century CE, which is option C. But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, perhaps the 3rd century BCE is correct, which is option H.

Wait, another way: If Mahavira was in the 5th century BCE, then the first structures would be after that. Let's say the first temples started 100-200 years after, which would be around 3rd century BCE. So option H.

But I'm not sure if that's accurate. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make a decision.

Based on the fact that Ashoka's period was 3rd century BCE, and he built Buddhist stupas, perhaps Jains started building their temples around the same time. So I'll go with option H: Third century BCE.

The question asks when the first Jaina temples appeared. To determine this, it is important to consider the historical context of Jainism and its development. Jainism was founded by Mahavira, who lived in the 5th or 6th century BCE. While the religion itself was established during this period, the construction of temples likely occurred later, as early Jains may have focused on ascetic practices and used natural or existing structures for worship.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D (5th century BCE):** This is around the time of Mahavira, but it is unlikely that temples were built immediately after the founding of Jainism. The early focus was likely on religious practices rather than constructing temples.
- **Option H (3rd century BCE):** This is a plausible timeframe, as it is a couple of centuries after Mahavira's time, allowing for the establishment of Jainism and the potential beginning of temple construction.
- **Option C (1st century CE):** This is also a reasonable possibility, as some early Jaina temples are known to have been built during this period, such as the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha.
- **Other options:** These are either too early (e.g., 10th or 11th century BCE) or too late (e.g., 18th century CE) to align with the known timeline of Jainism and temple construction.

Given the historical evidence and the likely progression of Jainism from its founding to the establishment of temples, the most plausible answer is that the first Jaina temples appeared in the **3rd century BCE**, making **Option H** the correct choice.

Answer: H
