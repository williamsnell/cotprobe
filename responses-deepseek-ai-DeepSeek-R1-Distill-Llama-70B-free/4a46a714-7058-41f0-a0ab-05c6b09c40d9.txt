Okay, so I've got this problem here about the heat of formation and isomerization of cyclopropane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. Part a) is about finding the heat of formation (ΔHf) of cyclopropane, (CH2)3. Part b) is the heat of isomerization from cyclopropane to propylene.

I remember that the heat of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for cyclopropane, which is (CH2)3, the formation reaction would be 3 C(s) + 3/2 H2(g) → (CH2)3(s or g?).

But wait, the data given includes the heat of combustion for cyclopropane, carbon, and H2. Oh, right, the heats of combustion are the enthalpy changes when one mole of a substance is completely burned in oxygen. So for cyclopropane, it's -500.0 kcal/mol. Carbon's is -94.0, and H2 is -68.0.

Wait, the given equation is the combustion of cyclopropane:

(CH2)3 + (9/2) O2 → 3 CO2 + 3 H2O(l)

The ΔH for combustion is -500.0 kcal/mol. So that's the enthalpy change when one mole of cyclopropane burns to CO2 and H2O.

I think I can use Hess's Law here. Hess's Law says that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same regardless of the pathway, so I can use the heats of formation of the reactants and products.

The combustion reaction can be broken down into the formation of CO2 and H2O from their elements, minus the formation of cyclopropane and O2. Because O2 is in its standard state, its ΔHf is zero.

So the combustion equation's ΔH is:

ΔH_combustion = [3 * ΔHf(CO2) + 3 * ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf((CH2)3) + (9/2)*ΔHf(O2)]

But O2 is zero, so it simplifies to:

-500.0 = 3*(ΔHf CO2) + 3*(ΔHf H2O) - ΔHf(cyclopropane)

Wait, but wait, the signs here. Because the combustion reaction is (CH2)3 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. So the products (CO2 and H2O) are being formed from the reactants (cyclopropane and O2).

The ΔH_combustion is the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus the reactants. So:

ΔH_combustion = [Σ ΔHf(products)] - [Σ ΔHf(reactants)]

Here, the reactant is (CH2)3 and O2. O2 is zero, so:

-500 = [3*(ΔHf CO2) + 3*(ΔHf H2O)] - [ΔHf (CH2)3 + 0 ]

I need to find ΔHf (CH2)3. Wait, but I don't have the values for ΔHf CO2 and H2O. Oh wait, I do know the standard heats of formation for CO2 and H2O. Wait, no, the problem gives the heats of combustion for C, H2, and cyclopropane. So maybe I should think differently.

Wait, the given data includes the heat of combustion for carbon (-94.0 kcal/mol), which is the ΔH for C(s) + O2 → CO2(g). So the heat of formation of CO2 can be calculated from that. Similarly for H2O.

Wait, the heat of combustion of carbon is the enthalpy change when one mole of carbon reacts with O2 to form CO2. So for C(s) + O2 → CO2(g), ΔH = -94.0 kcal/mol. But the standard heat of formation of CO2 is defined as the formation from C and O2, which is exactly this reaction. So ΔHf°(CO2) = -94.0 kcal/mol? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because the standard heat of formation of CO2 is the enthalpy change when one mole of CO2 is formed from its elements in their standard states. So yes, that's exactly the combustion of C. So ΔHf°(CO2) = -94.0 kcal/mol.

Similarly, the heat of combustion of H2 is -68.0 kcal/mol. The reaction is H2(g) + 1/2 O2 → H2O(l). So the ΔH for this is -68.0. Therefore, the heat of formation of H2O(l) is -68.0 kcal/mol. Because that's the formation from H2 and O2.

So now, plugging these into the equation:

-500.0 = 3*(-94.0) + 3*(-68.0) - ΔHf(cyclopropane)

Wait, let me compute that:

3*(-94) = -282

3*(-68) = -204

Sum is -282 -204 = -486

So: -500 = (-486) - ΔHf(cyclopropane)

Wait, let's write it:

-500 = [sum of products] - [reactants]

Which is:

-500 = (3*(-94) + 3*(-68)) - ΔHf(cyclopropane)

Because the reactants are (CH2)3 and O2, and O2 contributes zero.

So:

-500 = (-282 -204) - ΔHf(cyclo)

-500 = (-486) - ΔHf(cyclo)

Let me rearrange: 

ΔHf(cyclo) = (-486) - (-500) 

ΔHf(cyclo) = (-486) + 500 = 14 kcal/mol.

Wait, that would make the heat of formation of cyclopropane +14 kcal/mol? Hmm, but looking at the options, let's see. The options for part a) are numbers like 17, 15, 20, etc. So 14 isn't an option, but wait, let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, let me compute that again:

3*(-94) = -282

3*(-68) = -204

Total is -282 + (-204) = -486.

So equation:

ΔH_combustion = [products] - [reactants]

-500 = (-486) - ΔHf(cyclo)

So rearranging:

ΔHf(cyclo) = (-486) +500 = 14 kcal.

Hmm, but the options for part a) don't have 14 except for option G which is 14 for part a, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, looking at the options:

Options for part a) are:

A:17

B:15

C:20

D:13

E:12

F:18

G:14

H:22

I:10

J:8

So option G is 14 for part a). But I'm not sure if I made a mistake because the cyclopropane is in a ring structure, and maybe the sign is opposite?

Wait, wait, perhaps I inverted the equation. Let me think again. The combustion reaction is (CH2)3 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. The enthalpy change is -500 kcal/mol.

In terms of heats of formation:

ΔH_combustion = Σ ΔHf(products) - Σ ΔHf(reactants)

So products are 3 CO2 and 3 H2O. Reactants are 1 (CH2)3 and (9/2 O2). O2 is zero, so:

ΔH_combustion = 3(ΔHf CO2) +3(ΔHf H2O) - [ΔHf (CH2)3 + 0]

So:

-500 = 3*(-94) + 3*(-68) - ΔHf(cyclo)

Which is:

-500 = (-282) + (-204) - ΔHf(cyclo)

-500 = (-486) - ΔHf(cyclo)

Then:

-500 + 486 = -ΔHf(cyclo)

-14 = -ΔHf(cyclo)

So ΔHf(cyclo) = 14 kcal/mol.

Hmm, that's correct.

So part a) is 14 kcal/mol. Looking back at the options, option G is a) 14 kcal, and part b) is -9.1 kcal.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find part a and part b. So part a is 14, which is option G's a) value.

Now, part b) is the heat of isomerization of (CH2)3 to propylene. Propylene is CH2=CHCH3, or CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no, propylene is CH2=CHCH3.

Wait, the reaction would be cyclopropane → propylene. So the isomerization reaction is (CH2)3 → CH2=CHCH2?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, (CH2)3 is cyclopropane, which is a three-membered ring. Propylene is propene, which is CH2=CHCH3. So the isomerization is cyclopropane (C3H6) turning into propene (C3H6). So it's an isomerization reaction.

The heat of isomerization is the enthalpy change when cyclopropane is converted to propylene.

To find this, I can use the heats of formation of both compounds. The reaction is:

cyclopropane → propylene.

ΔH_isomerization = ΔHf(propylene) - ΔHf(cyclopropane)

Because the reaction is forming propylene from cyclopropane, so it's the ΔHf of products (propylene) minus reactants (cyclopropane).

We have ΔHf(cyclopropane) as 14 kcal/mol, from part a. The problem states that the heat of formation of CH3CH=CH2 (which is propylene) is 4.9 kcal/mol.

So ΔH_isomerization = 4.9 - 14 = -9.1 kcal/mol.

Wait, that would mean the reaction is exothermic, releasing heat. Because the products (propylene) have a lower enthalpy of formation than the reactant (cyclopropane). So the isomerization releases energy.

So part b) is -9.1 kcal/mol.

Looking back at the options, option G has a)14 and b)-9.1, which matches our calculations.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the sign can be tricky. The ΔH of isomerization is the enthalpy of the products minus reactants.

So if the products have lower ΔHf, then the ΔH is negative.

Yes, because for cyclopropane (reactant) to propylene (product), if the product's ΔHf is lower, the reaction is exothermic, so ΔH is negative.

So the heat of isomerization is -9.1 kcal/mol.

So the correct option is G: a)14 kcal, b)-9.1 kcal.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the heat of formation of cyclopropane (C₃H₆) and the heat of isomerization of cyclopropane to propylene (C₃H₆).

### Part (a): Heat of Formation of Cyclopropane (C₃H₆)
The combustion reaction of cyclopropane is:

\[
(CH_2)_3 + \frac{9}{2} O_2(g) \rightarrow 3 CO_2(g) + 3 H_2O(l)
\]

The enthalpy change for this reaction is given as:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{combustion}} = -500.0 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

Using Hess's Law, the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction can also be expressed as:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{combustion}} = \left[ 3 \Delta H_f(CO_2) + 3 \Delta H_f(H_2O) \right] - \Delta H_f((CH_2)_3),
\]

where:
- \(\Delta H_f(CO_2) = -94.0 \, \text{kcal/mol}\) (from the combustion of carbon),
- \(\Delta H_f(H_2O) = -68.0 \, \text{kcal/mol}\) (from the combustion of hydrogen),
- \(\Delta H_f((CH_2)_3)\) is the heat of formation of cyclopropane, which we need to find.

Substituting the values:

\[
-500.0 = \left[ 3(-94.0) + 3(-68.0) \right] - \Delta H_f((CH_2)_3),
\]

\[
-500.0 = \left[ -282.0 - 204.0 \right] - \Delta H_f((CH_2)_3),
\]

\[
-500.0 = -486.0 - \Delta H_f((CH_2)_3).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\Delta H_f((CH_2)_3) = -486.0 + 500.0 = 14.0 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

Thus, the heat of formation of cyclopropane is \(+14.0 \, \text{kcal/mol}\).

### Part (b): Heat of Isomerization of Cyclopropane to Propylene
The isomerization reaction is:

\[
(CH_2)_3 \rightarrow CH_3CH=CH_2.
\]

The heat of isomerization is the difference in the heats of formation of the products and reactants:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{isomerization}} = \Delta H_f(CH_3CH=CH_2) - \Delta H_f((CH_2)_3).
\]

From the problem:
- \(\Delta H_f(CH_3CH=CH_2) = +4.9 \, \text{kcal/mol}\),
- \(\Delta H_f((CH_2)_3) = +14.0 \, \text{kcal/mol}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{isomerization}} = 4.9 - 14.0 = -9.1 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

Thus, the heat of isomerization is \(-9.1 \, \text{kcal/mol}\).

### Final Answer
The heat of formation of cyclopropane is \(+14.0 \, \text{kcal/mol}\), and the heat of isomerization is \(-9.1 \, \text{kcal/mol}\). These values correspond to **option G**.
