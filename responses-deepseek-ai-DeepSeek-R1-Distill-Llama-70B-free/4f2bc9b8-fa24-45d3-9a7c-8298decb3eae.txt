Question:

In a prosecution of a defendant for receiving stolen property, an informer testified that the defendant sold him a stolen stereo, which the defendant knew had been stolen. During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the informer if he had recently filed an application to become a police officer. The informer responded affirmatively. The defendant's attorney then asked the informer the following question:"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?" The prosecuting attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule that the defendant's attorney's inquiry concerning the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is

Options:

A: improper, as it infringes on the informer's personal privacy.
B: improper, as it is unrelated to the crime being prosecuted.
C: proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.
D: improper, as it is speculative in nature.
E: proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.
F: proper, as it is a form of character evidence.
G: improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.
H: improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question about cross-examining an informer in a criminal trial. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a prosecution where the defendant is accused of receiving stolen property. The informer testified that the defendant sold him a stolen stereo and knew it was stolen. On direct, the informer said he's unemployed but sometimes works as a substitute teacher. Then, on cross, the defense attorney asked if he applied to be a police officer, and he said yes. Next, the attorney asked if he hoped that acting undercover would make the police overlook his two misdemeanor marijuana convictions. The prosecution objected, and we need to decide if the inquiry is proper.

So the issue is about the admissibility of that question on cross-examination. I remember that when cross-examining a witness, the opposing party can ask about certain things that might show bias or impeachment.

First, I think about what's allowed in cross. Generally, you can ask about a witness's bias, motive to lie, or prior convictions that affect their credibility. For misdemeanors, I believe that if the crime is punishable by more than a year, it can be used to impeach, but if it's less, maybe not. Wait, no, actually, under the Federal Rules, any felony conviction can be used, but for misdemeanors, only those involving dishonesty or false statement can be used, regardless of the punishment. So, for example, perjury or fraud would qualify, but maybe possession of marijuana wouldn't if it's a misdemeanor.

In this case, the informer has two misdemeanor convictions for possession. Possession isn't a crime of dishonesty, so maybe they can't be used to impeach his credibility. But wait, the question isn't about using the convictions to impeach truthfulness; it's about showing that the informer has a motive to lie because he wants to become a police officer and hopes his cooperation will help him.

So the question is about possible bias. If the informer is trying to get a job as a police officer and has these convictions, maybe he's trying to curry favor with the police. That could give him a reason to testify favorably for the prosecution, perhaps even to lie. So the defense is trying to show that he has a bias or motive to cooperate with the authorities, which could affect his credibility.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Improper because it invades privacy. I don't think that's right. The question is about his convictions and job application, which are relevant to his credibility, so privacy might not be the issue here.

B: Improper because unrelated to the crime. I don't agree. The question is about his credibility, which is directly related to his testimony in the case. So it's relevant.

C: Proper because it shows bad character for truthfulness. Well, the convictions are misdemeanors not involving dishonesty, so they might not be usable for that. But the question is more about his motive, not his character for truthfulness.

D: Improper because speculative. The question is about his hopes, which he can answer. It's not speculative in the sense that he can't know his own motivations.

E: Proper because relevant to possible bias. That seems right. The question is trying to show that he stands to gain (a job as a police officer) by helping the prosecution, thus having a bias.

F: Proper as character evidence. I don't think so, because character evidence is generally not allowed except in specific cases, like when the defendant's character is in issue. But this is about the witness's credibility, not character evidence per se.

G: Improper because the convictions aren't punishable by more than a year. Wait, but as I thought earlier, for impeachment, it's about whether the crime involves dishonesty, not the punishment. So if the crime doesn't involve dishonesty, the convictions can't be used to impeach credibility. But the question is about the witness's motive, not directly about his credibility. So maybe the convictions are relevant to show his motive, even if they can't be used to impeach his truthfulness.

H: Improper because the conduct isn't related to truthfulness. But the conduct here is about his convictions and job application, which relate to his motive, not directly his honesty. So maybe this is improper because it's about conduct not related to truthfulness. But wait, the question is about his hope to gain favor, which could show bias, a form of impeachment.

I'm a bit confused between options C, E, G, and H.

Wait, under FRE 608(b), specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence for the purpose of attacking the witness's credibility, but they can be inquired into on cross-examination if they're relevant to credibility. However, if the conduct is about a conviction, FRE 609 applies. FRE 609 says that evidence of a conviction can be used to impeach if the crime was a felony or a misdemeanor involving dishonesty or false statement. Possession of marijuana is a misdemeanor, but not a crime of dishonesty, so it can't be used under 609.

So the defense attorney's question is not about the convictions themselves to impeach credibility, but about the witness's motive. The witness is trying to become a police officer, and perhaps he's trying to get the convictions overlooked by cooperating. So the question is about possible bias, not about his credibility per se.

In that case, the question is proper because it's relevant to show the witness's bias or motive to lie. So the answer would be E: proper, as relevant to possible bias.

Looking back at the options:

E says it's proper because it's relevant to the informer's possible bias.

Yes, that makes sense. The defense is trying to show that the informer has a reason to help the prosecution, which could make him biased. So the trial judge should overrule the objection and allow the question.

Wait, but option G says improper because the convictions are for crimes not punishable by more than a year. But if the question isn't about using the convictions to impeach credibility, but about the motive, then G isn't the right reason. The question is allowed because it shows bias, not because it's about the convictions themselves for impeachment.

So the correct answer should be E.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a defense attorney's inquiry during cross-examination of an informer in a criminal trial. The informer testified that the defendant sold him a stolen stereo and knew it was stolen. On cross-examination, the defense attorney asked whether the informer hoped that his cooperation as an undercover agent would lead the police to overlook his two misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession. The prosecution objected, and the trial judge must decide whether the inquiry is proper.

Key considerations include:

1. **Relevance to Credibility and Bias**: The defense attorney's question aims to show the informer's potential bias or motive to lie. By highlighting the informer's desire to become a police officer and his hope that cooperation might overlook his convictions, the question seeks to demonstrate that the informer has a stake in the outcome of the case, which could impair his impartiality.

2. **Impeachment and Character Evidence**: Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, prior convictions can be used to impeach a witness's credibility if they involve dishonesty or false statement, regardless of punishment (FRE 608(b) and 609). However, possession of marijuana is not a crime of dishonesty, so the convictions themselves cannot be used to impeach the informer's truthfulness. The question, however, is not about the convictions themselves but rather the informer's motive, making it relevant to bias rather than truthfulness.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **A**: Incorrect. The inquiry does not improperly infringe on privacy, as it pertains to credibility and bias.
   - **B**: Incorrect. The question is relevant to the informer's credibility and potential bias, which are directly tied to the case.
   - **C**: Incorrect. The question is not about the informer's general character for truthfulness but rather his specific motive.
   - **D**: Incorrect. The question is not speculative; it directly addresses the informer's potential motivations.
   - **E**: Correct. The inquiry is proper because it is relevant to the informer's possible bias and motive to cooperate with the prosecution.
   - **F**: Incorrect. This is not character evidence but rather evidence of bias.
   - **G**: Incorrect. While the convictions are misdemeanors not involving dishonesty, the question is about motive, not impeachment based on the convictions themselves.
   - **H**: Incorrect. The question is relevant because it pertains to the informer's potential bias, even if not directly related to truthfulness.

The proper ruling is that the inquiry is allowed because it is relevant to the informer's possible bias.
