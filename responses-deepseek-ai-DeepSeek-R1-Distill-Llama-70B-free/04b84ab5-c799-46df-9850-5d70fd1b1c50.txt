Question:

Exactly one mole of gaseous methane is oxidized at fixed volume and at 25°C according to the reaction CH_4(g) + 2O_2 (g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l). If 212 Kcal is liberated, what is the change in enthalpy, ∆H?

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about the change in enthalpy when methane is oxidized. Hmm.

The reaction given is CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l). So methane is reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. I remember that when a reaction produces water in the liquid state, it's usually exothermic because forming bonds releases energy.

The problem states that exactly one mole of gaseous methane is oxidized, and the process happens at a fixed volume and at 25°C. Oh wait, fixed volume—so it's probably a constant volume process. But wait, enthalpy change (ΔH) is usually measured at constant pressure, right? Or wait, maybe not. I'm a bit fuzzy here.

The question says that 212 Kcal is liberated. So that means energy is released. So the reaction is exothermic, so ΔH should be negative because the system is losing heat. So the value of ΔH will be negative.

Wait, what's the unit here? The problem says 212 Kcal. Oh, kilocalories. So 212 Kcal is the heat released. So for the reaction as written, the enthalpy change is negative 212 Kcal, because the system is losing that much energy.

So looking at the options, option H is -212 Kcal. Option A is -213, which is close but not exact. Option G is -212 cal, which is a thousand times smaller. So I think H is the right answer.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The reaction is written as one mole of CH4. So the ΔH per mole of CH4 would be -212 Kcal. So yeah, that matches.

Another thing to consider: the state of water. Since it's liquid, the enthalpy change is more negative compared to if it were gas. Because when water condenses from gas to liquid, it releases more heat. So that makes the reaction more exothermic, which aligns with the negative value.

So putting it all together, the correct ΔH is -212 Kcal. So the answer should be H.
</think>

The reaction provided is CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l), where one mole of methane is oxidized. The problem states that 212 Kcal of energy is liberated, indicating that the reaction is exothermic. Since enthalpy change (ΔH) is negative for exothermic reactions, the value of ΔH will be -212 Kcal.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (-213 Kcal):** Close to the given value but not exact.
- **Option G (-212 cal):** This is 1,000 times smaller than the given value, so it is incorrect.
- **Option H (-212 Kcal):** Matches the given value exactly and is consistent with the exothermic nature of the reaction.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately represents the enthalpy change for the reaction.

Answer: H
