Okay, so I have this calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these volume of revolution problems. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking for the volume of the solid formed when a certain region is rotated around the y-axis. The region is bounded by the y-axis, y = e^x, and y = 2. Hmm, I need to visualize this.

Alright, let me sketch a rough graph in my mind. The y-axis is x=0. Then y = e^x is an exponential curve that passes through (0,1) and increases rapidly. The line y=2 is a horizontal line. So the region bounded by these should be where y ranges from 1 to 2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, when y=e^x, when y=2, x is ln(2). Because e^x=2 implies x=ln(2). Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the region is bounded by the y-axis (x=0), y=e^x, and y=2. So this region is between x=0 and x=ln(2), right? Because when y=2, x is ln(2), because e^x=2 → x=ln2. So from x=0 to x=ln2, and y goes from e^x up to 2. So the area is between these curves.

But wait, when rotating around the y-axis, I can use methods like disks or washers, or maybe cylindrical shells. Which method is better here? Since we're rotating around the y-axis and the functions are expressed in terms of x, maybe the shell method would be easier. Because for shells, we integrate with respect to x.

Wait, the shell method formula is 2π times the integral from a to b of x times the height of the shell. The height here would be the difference between the upper function and the lower function in terms of y. Wait, but in this case, the upper boundary is y=2, and the lower is y=e^x. So the height is (2 - e^x). And x goes from 0 to ln(2), because that's where y=e^x meets y=2.

So the volume V is 2π ∫ (from 0 to ln 2) x*(2 - e^x) dx.

Alternatively, I could use the washer method. But for that, I would have to express x in terms of y. So x = ln(y). Then, the outer radius would be the distance from the axis of rotation (y-axis) to the farthest point, which is x = ln(y). The inner radius is zero because the region is bounded by the y-axis. So the washer method would involve integrating π (outer radius)^2 - π (inner radius)^2. But since the inner radius is zero, it's just π (ln(y))^2 dy, integrated from y=1 to y=2. Wait, why y=1? Because at x=0, y=e^0=1. So the region starts at y=1 and goes up to y=2.

Wait, but using the washer method, the setup would be:

V = π ∫ (from y=1 to y=2) [x_right]^2 dy. Here, x_right is ln(y), so V = π ∫ ln(y)^2 dy from 1 to 2.

Alternatively, using shells, it's 2π ∫ x*(2 - e^x) dx from 0 to ln(2).

Hmm, either method should work. Maybe I should try both to see which is easier.

Let me try the shell method first. The integral becomes 2π ∫ x*(2 - e^x) dx from 0 to ln(2).

So let's expand that: 2π ∫ [2x - x e^x] dx from 0 to ln(2).

I can split this into two integrals: 2π [ ∫2x dx - ∫x e^x dx ] from 0 to ln(2).

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫2x dx from 0 to ln(2). The integral of 2x is x^2, so evaluating from 0 to ln(2), it's (ln(2))^2 - 0 = (ln(2))^2.

Second integral: ∫x e^x dx. This requires integration by parts. Let me set u = x → du = dx. dv = e^x dx → v = e^x.

So ∫x e^x dx = u v - ∫ v du = x e^x - ∫ e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C.

Evaluating from 0 to ln(2):

At ln(2): (ln(2)) e^{ln(2)} - e^{ln(2)} = (ln(2))(2) - 2 = 2 ln(2) - 2.

At 0: (0)e^0 - e^0 = 0 -1 = -1.

So the definite integral from 0 to ln(2) is [2 ln(2) - 2] - (-1) = 2 ln(2) - 2 +1 = 2 ln(2) -1.

Putting it all together:

V = 2π [ (ln(2))^2 - (2 ln(2) -1) ) ]

Simplify inside: (ln(2))^2 - 2 ln(2) +1.

So V = 2π [ (ln(2))^2 - 2 ln(2) +1 ]

Hmm, that's the expression. Now let's compute it numerically.

We know that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

Calculating each term:

(ln(2))^2 ≈ (0.6931)^2 ≈ 0.4804.

2 ln(2) ≈ 1.3862.

So (ln(2))^2 - 2 ln(2) +1 ≈ 0.4804 - 1.3862 +1 = (0.4804 +1) -1.3862 = 1.4804 -1.3862 ≈ 0.0942.

Multiply by 2π: 2π * 0.0942 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.0942 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.0942 ≈ Let me compute that.

6.2832 * 0.09 = 0.565488, and 6.2832 *0.0042≈0.0264. So total ≈ 0.5655 + 0.0264 ≈ 0.5919.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly that. The options are:

A:4.556, B:0.296, C:3.998, D:0.742, E:2.861, F:1.052, G:2.427, H:1.792, I:3.789, J:0.592.

Hmm, so the value I got is approximately 0.5919, which is very close to option J: 0.592.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the integral.

Wait, the shell method:

V = 2π ∫ (from 0 to ln2) x (2 - e^x) dx.

Yes, that's correct.

Breaking it into two integrals:

2π [ ∫2x dx - ∫x e^x dx ].

Yes.

First integral: [x²] from 0 to ln2 → (ln2)^2.

Second integral: ∫x e^x dx from 0 to ln2 → [x e^x - e^x] from 0 to ln2.

At ln2: (ln2)*2 - 2.

At 0: 0*e^0 -1 = -1.

So the definite integral is [2 ln2 -2] - (-1) = 2 ln2 -2 +1 = 2 ln2 -1.

So the entire expression becomes:

(ln2)^2 - (2 ln2 -1) → (ln2)^2 - 2 ln2 +1.

Which is (0.6931)^2 - 2*(0.6931) +1 = 0.4804 -1.3862 +1 = 0.4804 + (1 -1.3862) = 0.4804 -0.3862 = 0.0942.

Multiply by 2π: 2 * 3.1416 * 0.0942.

Wait, 0.0942 * 2 is 0.1884. Then 0.1884 * π ≈ 0.1884 *3.1416 ≈ 0.592. So yes, about 0.592, which is option J.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the integral. Alternatively, maybe I should try the washer method.

Let's try that.

Washer method: since we're rotating around the y-axis, and expressing x in terms of y, which is x=ln(y). The region is from y=1 to y=2 because at x=0, y=e^0=1, and the upper limit is y=2.

The volume is π ∫ [x_right]^2 dy from y=1 to y=2.

Here, x_right is ln(y), so V = π ∫ (ln y)^2 dy from 1 to 2.

Hmm, integrating (ln y)^2 dy. I think the integral of (ln y)^2 dy is y (ln y)^2 - 2 y ln y + 2 y + C. Let me verify.

Let me compute ∫ (ln y)^2 dy.

Integration by parts: Let u = (ln y)^2, dv = dy.

Then du = 2 (ln y) * (1/y) dy, and v = y.

So ∫ u dv = u v - ∫ v du = y (ln y)^2 - ∫ y * [2 (ln y)/y ] dy.

Simplify: y (ln y)^2 - 2 ∫ ln y dy.

Now, ∫ ln y dy is y ln y - y + C. So:

Putting it all together: y (ln y)^2 - 2 [y ln y - y] + C = y (ln y)^2 - 2 y ln y + 2 y + C.

So the integral from 1 to 2 is:

[2 (ln 2)^2 - 2*2 ln2 + 2*2] - [1*(ln1)^2 - 2*1*ln1 + 2*1].

Simplify each term:

At y=2:

2 (ln2)^2 - 4 ln2 +4.

At y=1: ln1=0, so (0) - 0 + 2*1=2.

So the definite integral is [2 (ln2)^2 -4 ln2 +4] - [2] = 2 (ln2)^2 -4 ln2 +2.

Multiply by π: V = π (2 (ln2)^2 -4 ln2 +2).

Let me compute this:

2*(0.6931)^2 ≈ 2 *0.4804 ≈ 0.9608.

-4*(0.6931) ≈ -2.7724.

+2 → 0.9608 -2.7724 +2 = (0.9608 +2) -2.7724 → 2.9608 -2.7724 = 0.1884.

So V= π * 0.1884 ≈ 3.1416 *0.1884 ≈ 0.592.

Same result as before. So 0.592, which is option J.

Hmm, but let me think again: the setup for the washer method was correct. We integrated from y=1 to 2 because the region starts at y=1 (x=0) and goes up to y=2. The radius is x=ln(y), so squaring that gives (ln y)^2.

Yes, both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the correct answer is J: 0.592.

To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the y-axis, \( y = e^x \), and \( y = 2 \) around the y-axis, we can use either the shell method or the washer method. Both methods yield the same result.

### Shell Method:
1. The region is bounded by \( x = 0 \) (the y-axis), \( y = e^x \), and \( y = 2 \). The height of the shell is \( 2 - e^x \), and the radius is \( x \).
2. The volume is given by:
   \[
   V = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\ln(2)} x \cdot (2 - e^x) \, dx
   \]
3. Expanding the integral:
   \[
   V = 2\pi \left[ \int_{0}^{\ln(2)} 2x \, dx - \int_{0}^{\ln(2)} x e^x \, dx \right]
   \]
4. Compute each term:
   - \( \int_{0}^{\ln(2)} 2x \, dx = \left[ x^2 \right]_{0}^{\ln(2)} = (\ln(2))^2 \)
   - \( \int_{0}^{\ln(2)} x e^x \, dx \) is computed using integration by parts:
     \[
     \int x e^x \, dx = x e^x - e^x + C
     \]
     Evaluating from \( 0 \) to \( \ln(2) \):
     \[
     \left[ x e^x - e^x \right]_{0}^{\ln(2)} = \left[ 2 \ln(2) - 2 \right] - \left[ -1 \right] = 2 \ln(2) - 1
     \]
5. Combine the results:
   \[
   V = 2\pi \left[ (\ln(2))^2 - (2 \ln(2) - 1) \right]
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   V = 2\pi \left[ (\ln(2))^2 - 2 \ln(2) + 1 \right]
   \]
6. Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
   \[
   (\ln(2))^2 \approx 0.4804, \quad 2 \ln(2) \approx 1.3862
   \]
   \[
   V \approx 2\pi \left[ 0.4804 - 1.3862 + 1 \right] = 2\pi (0.0942) \approx 0.592
   \]

### Washer Method:
1. Express \( x \) in terms of \( y \): \( x = \ln(y) \). The region is bounded by \( y = 1 \) (at \( x = 0 \)) and \( y = 2 \).
2. The volume is given by:
   \[
   V = \pi \int_{1}^{2} (\ln(y))^2 \, dy
   \]
3. Compute the integral:
   \[
   \int (\ln(y))^2 \, dy = y (\ln(y))^2 - 2 y \ln(y) + 2 y + C
   \]
4. Evaluate from \( y = 1 \) to \( y = 2 \):
   - At \( y = 2 \):
     \[
     2 (\ln(2))^2 - 4 \ln(2) + 4
     \]
   - At \( y = 1 \):
     \[
     1 (\ln(1))^2 - 2 \ln(1) + 2 = 2
     \]
   - Definite integral:
     \[
     \left[ 2 (\ln(2))^2 - 4 \ln(2) + 4 \right] - 2 = 2 (\ln(2))^2 - 4 \ln(2) + 2
     \]
5. Multiply by \( \pi \):
   \[
   V = \pi \left[ 2 (\ln(2))^2 - 4 \ln(2) + 2 \right]
   \]
6. Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):
   \[
   2 (\ln(2))^2 \approx 0.9608, \quad -4 \ln(2) \approx -2.7724
   \]
   \[
   V \approx \pi \left[ 0.9608 - 2.7724 + 2 \right] = \pi (0.1884) \approx 0.592
   \]

### Final Answer:
Both methods yield the same result: \( V \approx 0.592 \). The correct option is:

**J: 0.592**
