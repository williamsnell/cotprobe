Okay, so I've got this problem here about the van der Waals equation, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question gives me a gas that follows the van der Waals equation. The given parameters are a = 0.50 m^6 Pa mol^-2, volume V is 5.00e-4 m^3/mol at 273 K and 3.0 MPa pressure. I need to find the van der Waals constant b and then compute the compression factor.

Wait, right. The van der Waals equation is [P + a(n/V)^2] (V/n - b) = RT. Oh wait, but in this case, the volume is given per mole, so V is m^3/mol. So n would be 1 mole, I think.

So the equation becomes (P + a/(V^2)) (V - b) = RT.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. Because when n=1, then (n/V) is 1/V, so a (n/V)^2 is a/(V^2). And V/n is V. So yeah, substituting n=1, the equation is (P + a/(V²)) (V - b) = RT.

Given that, I can plug in the values to find b.

But wait, I don't know b yet. So I need to solve for b. Let's write the equation again:

P + a/(V²) = [RT]/(V - b) + [a/(V²)] = ?

Wait no, let me rearrange the equation correctly. Starting from [P + a/(V^2)] (V - b) = RT.

So, expand the left side: P(V - b) + a/(V^2) * (V - b) = RT.

Hmm, but that might complicate things. Maybe it's better to isolate terms. Let me rearrange the equation:

[P + (a)/(V^2)] = RT / (V - b)

So,

P = RT/(V - b) - a/(V^2)

I can rearrange this for b. Let's see, moving terms around:

RT/(V - b) = P + a/(V²)

Take reciprocal of both sides:

(V - b)/RT = 1/(P + a/V²)

So,

V - b = RT / (P + a/V²)

Then,

b = V - [RT / (P + a/V²)]

This gives me an expression to solve for b.

Now plug in the numbers.

Given:
a = 0.50 m^6 Pa / mol²
V = 5.00e-4 m³/mol
T = 273 K
P = 3.0 MPa = 3.0e6 Pa

R is the gas constant. Oh wait, what's R in these units? Because R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and since 1 J = 1 Pa·m³, so R = 8.314 Pa·m³/(mol·K).

So R = 8.314 Pa m³/(mol K)

So compute RT first. R*T = 8.314 * 273.

Let me calculate that:

8.314 * 273. Let's compute:

8 * 273 = 2184
0.314 *273: 0.3 *273=81.9; 0.014*273≈3.822 → total ≈85.722
So total is approx 2184 + 85.722 = 2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

Wait, let me do it more accurately:

273 * 8 = 2184.

273 * 0.314:

Break it down:

0.3 * 273 = 81.9

0.014 * 273: 273 *0.01=2.73, 0.004 *273=1.092 → 2.73+1.092=3.822

So 81.9 +3.822=85.722.

So 8.314*273=2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

So RT = 2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

Now, compute the denominator: P + a/(V²)

P is 3.0e6 Pa.

a/(V^2) = 0.50 / ( (5.00e-4)^2 )

Compute denominator: (5e-4)^2 = 25e-8 = 2.5e-7 m^6/mol²

So a/(V²) = 0.50 / (2.5e-7) → 0.5 / 2.5e-7 = (0.5 / 2.5) * 1e7 → 0.2 *1e7 = 2e6 Pa.

So a/(V^2) = 2e6 Pa.

So P + a/(V^2) = 3e6 + 2e6 =5e6 Pa.

Wait, that's a pretty high pressure, but okay.

So now, the denominator in the RT/(...) part is 5e6 Pa.

So RT/(P + a/V²) = 2269.722 / (5e6) → Let's compute that.

2269.722 / 5,000,000 = approximately 0.00045394 m³/mol.

So now, V is 5e-4 m³/mol.

So,

b = V - [RT/(P + a/V²)] = 5e-4 - 0.00045394.

Wait, wait, 5e-4 is 0.0005.

Wait, 0.0005 minus 0.00045394 is 0.00004606 m³/mol.

Wait, that seems very small. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, RT is about 2269.722 Pa m³/mol. Divided by 5e6 Pa.

2269.722 / 5e6 = 2269.722 / 5,000,000.

Well, 2269.722 / 5e6 → Let's compute 2269.722 /5 = 453.9446, so 453.9446e-6 → 4.539446e-4 m³/mol.

Wait wait, no, wait: 2269.722 divided by 5e6 is 0.0004539446 m³/mol.

Wait, no, 5e6 is 5 million. So 2269.722 divided by 5 million is 0.0004539446.

So V is 5e-4 = 0.0005 m³/mol.

So b = 0.0005 - 0.0004539446 = 0.0000460554 m³/mol.

Hmm, that's approximately 4.6055e-5 m³/mol.

Wait, that seems a bit small, but I guess that's possible.

So the van der Waals constant b is approximately 4.6055e-5 m³/mol.

Wait, but I'm supposed to calculate this for the problem, but the question also asks for the compression factor. So perhaps I should proceed to that.

The compression factor Z is given by PV/(RT). But wait, for real gases, PV = nRT Z, so Z = PV/(nRT). Since n=1 here, Z = PV/(RT).

Wait, but let's compute that.

P is 3.0e6 Pa, V is 5e-4 m³/mol.

RT is 2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

So Z = (3e6 * 5e-4 ) / 2269.722.

Compute numerator: 3e6 *5e-4 = 3e2 *5e-4 *1e4? Wait, 3e6 *5e-4 = (3 *5 ) * (1e6 * 1e-4) )= 15 * 1e2 = 1500.

So numerator is 1500.

Denominator is 2269.722.

So Z = 1500 /2269.722 ≈ 0.6615.

Looking at the options, F is 0.66, so that would be the compression factor.

But wait, I thought the question is to find b first, and then the compression factor. So perhaps I should confirm the steps.

Wait, let's recap:

Compute RT: 8.314 * 273 = ~2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

Compute a/(V^2) = 0.5 / ( (5e-4)^2 ) = 0.5 / 25e-8 = 0.5 / 2.5e-7 = 2e6 Pa.

So denominator for the RT division is 3e6 + 2e6 =5e6 Pa.

RT divided by denominator is 2269.722 /5e6 = 0.0004539446 m³/mol.

Subtract this from V: 0.0005 - 0.0004539446 = 0.0000460554 m³/mol.

So b is approximately 4.6055e-5 m³/mol.

But the question might be expecting more precise calculation for b. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let's compute a/V² more precisely.

a=0.50, V=5.00e-4 m^3/mol.

V^2 = (5.00e-4)^2 = 25e-8 = 2.5e-7 m^6/mol².

So a/V² = 0.50 / 2.5e-7 = 2e6 Pa.

Yes, that's correct.

So P + a/V² = 3e6 +2e6=5e6.

RT = 8.314 *273. Let's compute that more accurately.

8.314 * 273:

Let me compute 8 *273 = 2184.

0.314 *273: 0.3 *273=81.9, 0.014 *273=3.822. So 81.9+3.822=85.722.

Total RT =2184 +85.722=2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

So RT/(P + a/V²) =2269.722 /5e6 = 0.0004539446 m³/mol.

V is 5e-4 m³/mol, which is 0.0005 m³/mol.

So b = 0.0005 - 0.0004539446 = 0.0000460554 m³/mol.

So b is approximately 4.6055e-5 m³/mol.

But the question isn't asking for b; it's asking for the compression factor. So that's Z=PV/(RT). As calculated earlier, that comes out to approximately 0.6615, which is 0.66, option F.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in computing Z. Because the van der Waals equation isn't the ideal gas equation, so perhaps the compression factor calculation is a bit more involved. Hmm.

Wait, no, the compression factor Z is defined as Z = PV/(nRT), regardless of the equation of state. So for this gas, under given conditions, it's the same formula.

So with n=1, Z = PV/RT.

So P=3e6 Pa, V=5e-4 m³/mol.

RT is 2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

So PV =3e6 *5e-4 = 1500 Pa m³/mol.

RT is 2269.722 Pa m³/mol.

So Z=1500 /2269.722 ≈ 0.6615, so 0.66.

Looking at the options, F is 0.66.

So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we start with the van der Waals equation for one mole of gas:

\[
\left(P + \frac{a}{V^2}\right)(V - b) = RT
\]

Here, \(a = 0.50 \, \mathrm{m^6 \, Pa \, mol^{-2}}\), \(V = 5.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{m^3 \, mol^{-1}}\), \(T = 273 \, \mathrm{K}\), and \(P = 3.0 \, \mathrm{MPa} = 3.0 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{Pa}\). The gas constant \(R\) is \(8.314 \, \mathrm{Pa \, m^3 \, mol^{-1} \, K^{-1}}\). The goal is to calculate the van der Waals constant \(b\) and the compression factor \(Z\).

---

### Step 1: Calculate \(RT\)
\[
RT = 8.314 \times 273 = 2269.722 \, \mathrm{Pa \, m^3 \, mol^{-1}}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate \(\frac{a}{V^2}\)
\[
V^2 = (5.00 \times 10^{-4})^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m^6 \, mol^{-2}}
\]
\[
\frac{a}{V^2} = \frac{0.50}{2.5 \times 10^{-7}} = 2.0 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{Pa}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the denominator \(P + \frac{a}{V^2}\)
\[
P + \frac{a}{V^2} = 3.0 \times 10^6 + 2.0 \times 10^6 = 5.0 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{Pa}
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \(b\)
Rearranging the van der Waals equation:
\[
b = V - \frac{RT}{P + \frac{a}{V^2}}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
b = 5.00 \times 10^{-4} - \frac{2269.722}{5.0 \times 10^6}
\]
\[
b = 5.00 \times 10^{-4} - 0.0004539446 = 0.0000460554 \, \mathrm{m^3 \, mol^{-1}}
\]

Thus, \(b \approx 4.6055 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m^3 \, mol^{-1}}\).

---

### Step 5: Calculate the compression factor \(Z\)
The compression factor is defined as:
\[
Z = \frac{PV}{RT}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
Z = \frac{(3.0 \times 10^6)(5.00 \times 10^{-4})}{2269.722}
\]
\[
Z = \frac{1500}{2269.722} \approx 0.6615
\]

Thus, \(Z \approx 0.66\).

---

### Final Answer:
The compression factor for the gas under the given conditions is **0.66**, which corresponds to option **F**.

F
