Okay, so I've got this problem about the mass of carbon monoxide in a puff of cigarette smoke. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. I'm a bit rusty on gas calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a table with components and their mole fractions. The component I'm interested in is CO, which has a mole fraction of 0.036. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the table again. Oh right, the mole fraction for CO is 0.036. Oh wait, no, the table says CO2 is 0.079. So CO is 0.036, correct.

The problem is asking for the mass of CO in a 35.0 ml puff at STP. STP conditions are standard temperature and pressure, which I remember is 0 degrees Celsius (273.15 K) and 1 atmosphere pressure. At STP, one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters, right? But wait, wait—wait, no, that's at STP? Or is it 22.4 L/mol at STP? I thought so. So 22.4 liters per mole.

But the volume here is 35.0 ml, which is 0.035 liters. Hmm. So first, I think I need to find out how many moles of gas are in that volume, then use the mole fraction to find moles of CO, and then convert that to grams.

Wait, but wait a second. At STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L. So if I have 0.035 L, that's 0.035 / 22.4 moles of total gas. Let me compute that. 0.035 divided by 22.4 is approximately 0.0015625 moles. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

0.035 divided by 22.4 equals... Let's see:

22.4 liters is 1 mole. So 0.035 liters is 0.035 / 22.4 = 0.0015625 mol. So that's the total moles of all gases in the puff.

But the CO is only a fraction of that. The mole fraction is 0.036. So the moles of CO would be 0.0015625 mol * 0.036.

Let me compute that: 0.0015625 * 0.036. Hmm, 0.0015625 multiplied by 0.036.

Let me think: 0.0015625 is 1.5625e-3. Multiply by 3.6e-2.

1.5625e-3 * 3.6e-2 = (1.5625 * 3.6) * 1e-5.

1.5625 * 3.6: Let me compute that. 1.5 * 3.6 is 5.4, and 0.0625*3.6 is 0.225. So total is 5.4 + 0.225 = 5.625. So 5.625e-5. So moles of CO is 5.625e-5 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.0015625 is 1.5625e-3. 0.036 is 3.6e-2. So 1.5625e-3 * 3.6e-2 = (1.5625 * 3.6) * 1e-5. So yes, 5.625e-5, which is 5.625 × 10^-5 moles.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation because I might have made a mistake here. Let me compute 1.5625 * 3.6 again.

1.5 * 3.6 is 5.4. 0.0625 * 3.6 is 0.225. So 5.4 + 0.225 equals 5.625. So yes, 5.625e-5 moles.

Now, I need to find the mass of CO. Molar mass of CO: carbon is 12.01 g/mol, oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. So 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g/mol.

So mass is moles multiplied by molar mass. So 5.625e-5 mol × 28.01 g/mol.

Let me compute that: 5.625e-5 * 28.01.

First, multiply 5.625 by 28.01. 5 * 28 is 140, 0.625 *28 is 17.5. So 140 + 17.5 = 157.5. But wait, 5.625 is 5 and 5/8, so 5.625 *28 = ?

Let me compute 5.625 × 28.01.

Wait, 5 × 28.01 is 140.05.

0.625 ×28.01 is 17.50625.

So total is 140.05 + 17.50625 = 157.55625.

So 157.55625 grams per mole. Wait, no, wait, that's the molar mass. So the mass is 5.625e-5 mol × 28.01 g/mol.

So 5.625e-5 * 28.01 = (5.625 *28.01) * 1e-5.

Wait, 5.625 ×28.01 = as above, 157.55625.

So 157.55625e-5 grams. Which is 1.5755625e-3 grams. Because 157.55625 ×1e-5 is 0.0015755625 grams.

So that's approximately 0.0015756 grams, which is 1.5756 × 10^-3 grams.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.8e-3 → 0.0008

B: 1.6e-3 → 0.0016

C: 2.0e-3 →0.002

E: 3.2e-3 →0.0032

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 0.0015756 g, which is about 1.576e-3 grams. So the closest option is B:1.6e-3.

Wait, but wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have messed up a step.

Wait, alternative approach: maybe I should compute using PV = nRT, but at STP, we know that 1 mole is 22.4 L. So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but let me recalculate the moles of CO step.

Total volume is 35.0 mL = 0.035 L.

At STP, n_total = V /22.4 = 0.035 /22.4 ≈ 0.0015625 mol.

Mole fraction of CO is 0.036 → moles of CO = 0.0015625 * 0.036 = 5.625e-5 mol.

Molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol.

Mass = 5.625e-5 mol *28.01 g/mol = let me compute this again.

5.625e-5 *28.01 = ?

5e-5 is 0.00005. 28 ×0.00005 is 0.0014. But more accurately, 5.625 *28.01 is 157.55625 → 157.55625e-5 grams → 0.0015755625 grams.

Which is approximately 1.5756e-3 grams. So 0.0015756 g, which is about 1.58e-3 grams.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:1.6e-3 g.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps once more.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole fraction. Oh wait, looking back at the table, the mole fractions are:

H2O:0.016

O2:0.12

CO:0.036

CO2:0.079.

Wait, so CO is 0.036, correct.

Wait, another thought: is the mole fraction given as 0.036? Yes.

So the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using n=PV/(RT), but since it's at STP, using 22.4 L/mol is correct.

Another way: n_total = (P V) / (R T). At STP, P is 1 atm, T is 273.15 K, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So n = (1 atm * 0.035 L) / (0.0821 * 273.15) → let me compute that.

Compute denominator: 0.0821 *273.15 ≈ 0.0821 *273 ≈ 22.4 L·atm/mol.

So n ≈ 0.035 /22.4 ≈ 0.0015625 mol, same as before.

So yes, same result.

So moles of CO: 0.0015625 *0.036 = 5.625e-5.

Mass is 5.625e-5 *28.01 g/mol = 0.00157556 g → 1.5756e-3 g.

So the closest option is B:1.6e-3 g.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the volume is 35.0 mL at STP, but wait, sometimes people use 22.414 L/mol for STP. Let me see, 22.4 is an approximation. Let's use the exact value.

n = (1 atm * 0.035 L) / (0.082057 *273.15 K) → compute denominator:

0.082057 L·atm/mol·K *273.15 K ≈ 22.414 L·atm/mol.

So n = 0.035 /22.414 ≈ 0.0015618 mol.

Moles CO: 0.0015618 *0.036 = 5.6219e-5 mol.

Mass: 5.6219e-5 *28.01 → 5.6219e-5 *28.01.

Compute 5.6219e-5 *28.01:

5.6219 *28.01 = let's compute that.

5 *28.01 =140.05

0.6219 *28.01 ≈ let's compute 0.6 *28.01=16.806; 0.0219*28.01≈0.6132.

So 16.806 +0.6132≈17.4192.

Total 140.05 +17.4192=157.4692.

So 157.4692e-5 grams → 0.00157469 grams → 1.57469e-3 grams, which is about 0.0015747 grams, so 1.5747e-3 g.

So approximately 1.575e-3 grams, which is 0.001575 g.

Looking at the options:

B is 1.6e-3 → 0.0016 g.

I think my calculation is correct, so the answer would be B.

To determine the mass of carbon monoxide (CO) in a 35.0 mL puff of cigarette smoke at standard temperature and pressure (STP), we proceed as follows:

1. **Mole Fraction and Total Moles**:  
   The mole fraction of CO in the smoke is given as 0.036. At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L. The total moles of gas in 35.0 mL (0.035 L) of smoke are:  
   \[
   n_{\text{total}} = \frac{V}{22.4} = \frac{0.035}{22.4} \approx 0.0015625 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   The moles of CO are then:  
   \[
   n_{\text{CO}} = n_{\text{total}} \times \text{mole fraction of CO} = 0.0015625 \times 0.036 = 5.625 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Molar Mass of CO**:  
   The molar mass of CO is calculated as:  
   \[
   M_{\text{CO}} = 12.01 \, (\text{C}) + 16.00 \, (\text{O}) = 28.01 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

3. **Mass of CO**:  
   The mass of CO is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of CO} = n_{\text{CO}} \times M_{\text{CO}} = 5.625 \times 10^{-5} \times 28.01 \approx 1.5756 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated mass of CO is approximately \( 1.5756 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g} \), which is closest to option **B: \( 1.6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g} \)**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: \( 1.6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g} \)**.
