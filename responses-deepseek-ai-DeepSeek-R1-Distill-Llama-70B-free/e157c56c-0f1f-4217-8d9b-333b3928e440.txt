C: No, this was not robbery because the victim was not aware of the crime when it occurred.
D: Yes, robbery is the unlawful taking of property from another's person by intimidation or force.

F: No, this was not robbery because the man was a guest at the party.
G: Yes, robbery can occur in any location, including a private home.
H: No, this was not robbery because it occurred in a private home and not in a business establishment or on the street.
I: No, this was not robbery because the man didn't use a weapon.

Okay, so I have this question about whether a man can be convicted of robbery under certain circumstances. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that a man is at a party, sees a female guest who's passed out, unconscious and alone in a bedroom. He locks the door, takes her purse, empties the money into his pockets, and removes her jewelry. Then he gets caught and is charged with robbery. The question is whether he can be convicted.

Alright, I need to remember what robbery entails. From what I recall, robbery is a specific type of theft that involves force or the threat of force. It's different from burglary, which is more about breaking and entering with intent to commit a crime. So robbery usually requires that the victim is aware or that the act involves some level of force or intimidation.

Wait, but in this case, the victim is unconscious. She's not aware of what's happening. So does that affect whether it's robbery? Because if she's not awake, she can't really feel fear or intimidation, right? So maybe that's a key point.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because it's taking belongings without consent while unconscious. But I'm not sure if that's robbery or just theft. Because robbery requires more than just taking without consent; it requires force or intimidation.

Option B says yes, robbery doesn't require the victim to be subdued by force or fear. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I thought robbery does require some element of force or fear. So B might be incorrect.

Option C says no because the victim wasn't aware. That aligns with my initial thought. If she's unconscious, she can't be intimidated, so it might not be robbery.

Option D says yes, robbery is unlawful taking with intimidation or force. But if the victim is unconscious, there's no intimidation, right? Because she can't perceive it. So D might not apply here.

Option E says no, because no intimidation or force against an unconscious victim. That makes sense. Without the victim being aware, there's no intimidation, so it's not robbery. It might be larceny or theft instead.

Option F says no because he was a guest. I don't think that's relevant. The location or relationship might affect trespassing or burglary, but not robbery itself. So F is probably not the right reason.

Option G says yes, robbery can occur anywhere. While that's true, the issue is more about the elements of robbery, not the location. So G is probably incorrect as the deciding factor.

Option H says no because it's in a private home. I don't think the location changes whether it's robbery or not. Robbery can happen anywhere, so H might not be correct.

Option I says no because no weapon was used. But robbery doesn't necessarily require a weapon, just force or intimidation. So I is probably not the right reason.

Putting it together: The key elements are whether force or intimidation were present. Since the victim was unconscious, she couldn't feel fear or intimidation. So the act would be theft or larceny, but not robbery because the necessary elements aren't met.

So looking at the options, the correct answer should be E: No, because no intimidation or force against an unconscious victim.

The crime of robbery requires the unlawful taking of property from another's person through the use or threat of force or intimidation. In this scenario, the victim was unconscious and therefore unable to perceive any threat or intimidation. Without the element of force or intimidation, the act does not meet the legal definition of robbery. Instead, it would be classified as theft or larceny. 

Option E correctly identifies that robbery cannot occur in this situation because there was no intimidation or force exerted against an unconscious victim.
