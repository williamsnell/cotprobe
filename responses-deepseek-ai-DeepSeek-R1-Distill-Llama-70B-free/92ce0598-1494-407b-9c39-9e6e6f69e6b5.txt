Okay, so I have this question about why United States coins are called "token money." I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what do I know about token money? I remember that token money refers to coins where the face value is higher than the value of the metal they're made from. Like, for example, pennies used to be made of copper, but now they're mostly zinc. The actual metal isn't worth a cent, so their value is just what the government says they're worth.

Looking at the options:

A: Commemorative tokens for collectors. I don't think that's it. Regular coins aren't just for collectors.

B: Minted by private organizations. No, the US Mint is a government entity, so this doesn't fit.

C: Only accepted in certain states. That's not true. US coins are legal tender everywhere in the country.

D: Value of metal is less than monetary value. This sounds right because, like I thought earlier, the metal isn't worth the face value.

E: Historical significance. Maybe some coins, but not why they're called token money.

F: Used as barter. No, they're legal tender, not just for barter.

G: Backed by government promise. That's more about fiat currency, which applies to paper money, not coins. Coins are more about the token system.

H: Replicas for education. Doesn't make sense.

I: Made of cheap metal. This is related to D. The metal is cheaper, so the coin's value is more than the metal's worth, making it token money.

J: Used in games. That's not the reason they're called token money.

So between D and I. Wait, D says the value of the metal is far less than the coin's value. I says made of cheap metal. Both seem similar, but D is more precise. Because token money is about the discrepancy between metal value and face value, not just the metal being cheap. So D is the better answer.

The term "token money" refers to coins whose face value exceeds the value of the metal they are made from. This is the case with United States coins, as their monetary value is determined by government decree rather than the intrinsic value of their metal content. 

Analyzing the options:

- **D** correctly captures this concept, emphasizing the disparity between the metal's value and the coin's monetary value.
- **I**, while related, focuses on the cheapness of the metal, which is a characteristic but not the defining reason for the term "token money."

Thus, the best answer is **D**.

Answer: D
