Okay, so I've got this question here about body temperature regulation in different animals. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which of the listed animals maintain a constant body temperature despite changes in environmental temperature. The options are frog, robin, fish, dog, or lizard.

Hmm, I remember that animals are classified as either endothermic or ectothermic. Endotherms are warm-blooded, meaning they generate heat internally and maintain a constant body temperature. Ectotherms are cold-blooded, relying on external sources of heat, so their body temperature varies with the environment.

So, let's list each animal:

- Frog: They're amphibians. I think frogs are ectothermic because they often sit in the sun to warm up. Their body temp probably fluctuates with their surroundings.

- Robin: Bird, right? Birds are endotherms. They generate heat internally. So robins should maintain a constant body temp regardless of the environment.

- Fish: Aquatic, usually ectothermic. Their metabolism depends on water temperature. So their body temp changes as the environment does.

- Dog: Mammals are endothermic. Dogs definitely keep a constant body temperature. They regulate it through various means like sweating and panting.

- Lizard: Reptiles, which are ectothermic. They bask in the sun to get warm, so their body temp isn't constantâ€”it changes with the environment.

So the question is asking which ones maintain constant body temperature. That means looking for endotherms.

Looking at the options, the animals that are endotherms are robin and dog.

Now looking at the answer choices:

Option J is Robin and Dog. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check the options. The question gives options A to J, each pairing different animals. The correct pairing should be robin and dog, which is option J.

The correct answer is the option that includes animals capable of maintaining a constant body temperature regardless of environmental changes. These animals are endotherms (warm-blooded), which include robins (birds) and dogs (mammals). Among the given options, the pairing of robin and dog corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
