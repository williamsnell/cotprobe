Okay, so I've got this question here about American history, specifically regarding a president's third term and public approval. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my U.S. history, but I'll try to piece this together.

The question is asking: Before being reelected for a third term as president, how many Americans approved of running a third time? The options are from A to J, with percentages ranging from 10% to 100%.

First, I need to figure out which president ran for a third term. I remember that Franklin D. Roosevelt was the president who served more than two terms. Before him, there was an unwritten rule that presidents would only serve two terms, following George Washington's example. But FDR was the first to break that, right?

So FDR was elected to four terms, but this question is about the third term. So before his third term, what was the public opinion? I think that when he was considering a third term, there was some controversy because it was unprecedented. People were divided on whether it was a good idea.

I recall that FDR's approval ratings were pretty high during his presidency, especially during the New Deal era. But when it came to a third term, there might have been some opposition. However, I'm not sure about the exact percentage.

Wait, I think there was a Gallup poll around that time. Let me try to remember. I think his average approval rating was around 70% or so, but specifically about running for a third term, the approval might have been lower because it was a controversial idea.

Alternatively, I've heard that when FDR first considered a third term, a significant portion of the public was against it. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe the majority was in favor because they supported his policies, especially with the economic recovery and the start of World War II approaching.

Wait, another angle: The 22nd Amendment, which limits a president to two terms, was ratified in 1951, after FDR's time. So during his era, there was no law against it, but the tradition was strong. So when FDR ran for a third term in 1940, I think the public was somewhat divided, but he still won the election.

But the question is about approval before the third term. So maybe the approval rating was around 50%? Or perhaps higher. I'm a bit confused here.

Another approach: I remember that in 1939, when FDR was considering a third term, his popularity had dipped a bit compared to earlier years. I think his approval ratings were around 60% or so. But regarding the specific issue of a third term, I'm not sure if the approval was higher or lower than his overall approval.

Wait, I think there's a specific statistic. I recall reading that in 1940, just before his third term, about 60% of Americans approved of him running again. Or was it lower? Maybe around 50%? Alternatively, I might be mixing this up with his overall approval.

Alternatively, perhaps the number was higher, like 70%. Because FDR was quite popular, and many people supported him continuing, especially considering the economic progress and the looming war in Europe.

Wait, another thought: The question is about how many approved of him running a third time, not necessarily his overall job approval. So maybe the number was lower because the idea of a third term was controversial. So perhaps around 40% or 50% approved of him running again.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the options again. The options are 10, 30, 40, 60, 90, 50, 80, 20, 70, 100. So the plausible numbers are 40, 50, 60, 70, 80.

I think FDR's overall approval was around 70% during his second term, but the approval for a third term was lower. Maybe around 50% were for it, and the rest against. So perhaps option F:50%.

Alternatively, I've heard that a Gallup poll in 1939 showed that 43% of Americans favored a third term for FDR, while 54% were opposed. But that doesn't match any of the options exactly. Wait, the options don't have 43%, but option C is 40%, which is close. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to a different time.

Wait, but the question says "before being reelected for a third term". So perhaps just before the 1940 election, when he was running for the third term, his approval on the issue was higher. Maybe around 60%?

Alternatively, I might be conflating different polls. I think I've read that in 1940, a majority of Democrats supported him, but Republicans were opposed. But overall, maybe around 50% of the population approved.

Wait, another angle: the two-term tradition was so strong that even though FDR was popular, the public might have been hesitant about a third term. So perhaps the approval was around 40%, making option C the answer.

Alternatively, I'm probably overcomplicating this. I think the correct answer is around 60%, which would be option D. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think I remember that FDR's third term was approved by about 60% of the people. So the answer would be D:60%.

The question asks about the percentage of Americans who approved of a president running for a third term before Franklin D. Roosevelt's reelection. FDR was the first U.S. president to break the two-term tradition, and his decision to run for a third term was controversial. While his overall approval ratings were high during his presidency, the specific approval for a third term was lower due to the precedent it set.

Considering historical context and polls from the time, FDR's approval for a third term was significant but not overwhelmingly high. Some estimates suggest around 60% of Americans approved of him running for a third term, reflecting a balance between his popularity and the controversy surrounding the decision.
