Okay, so I've got this physics question here about a baseball being tossed and which component of its velocity can stay constant. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you throw something, like a ball, it follows a projectile motion. So, the key here is probably understanding projectile motion.

In projectile motion, the object's velocity has two components: horizontal and vertical. From what I learned, the horizontal component doesn't change if we neglect air resistance. Oh wait, but if there's no air resistance, right? Because in real life, air resistance would cause some drag, but maybe the question assumes it's negligible.

Wait, but the question is about what can remain constant. So, in projectile motion, the horizontal velocity is constant (assuming no air resistance) because there's no acceleration in that direction. The vertical velocity changes because gravity is acting downward, causing a constant acceleration (g, about 9.8 m/s²). So the vertical component changes over time, increasing as the ball goes up and then comes back down.

So the question is, which component remains constant? The horizontal component. So looking at the options, option C is "horizontal". So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check the options. The options are A through J, and option C is horizontal. So yes, that's the one.

I don't think the other options make sense. Diagonal velocity would be the resultant, which definitely changes because the vertical component changes. Vertical component is changing all the time due to gravity. Angular or rotational—those might relate to spin, but that's a different kind of motion, and the question is about the velocity components. So yeah, the horizontal component stays the same.

In projectile motion, the horizontal component of velocity remains constant when air resistance is negligible, while the vertical component changes due to gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: horizontal
