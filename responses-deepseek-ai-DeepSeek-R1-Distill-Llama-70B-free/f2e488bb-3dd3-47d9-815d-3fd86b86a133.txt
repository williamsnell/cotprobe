Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

An astronaut lands on a planet whose mass and radius are each twice that of Earth. If the astronaut weighs 800 N on Earth, how much will he weigh on this planet? The options are A to J.

Hmm. Alright, I remember that weight is related to gravity. On Earth, weight is the force of gravity acting on the person's mass. So the formula for weight is W = m * g, where m is the mass of the object and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Wait, right. So on Earth, the astronaut's weight is 800 N, which means 800 = m * g_earth. But I don't know the astronaut's mass yet. Maybe I can find that first. Oh wait, I don't need to find m explicitly. Because on the other planet, the weight will be W = m * g_planet. So I can find the ratio of W_planet to W_earth by comparing g_planet and g_earth.

Right. So I need to find the ratio of the acceleration due to gravity on the planet compared to Earth.

I remember the formula for gravitational acceleration on the surface of a planet is g = G * (M) / (R^2), where M is the planet's mass and R is its radius. G is the gravitational constant, which is the same everywhere.

So for Earth, g_earth = G * M_earth / R_earth^2.

And for the planet, g_planet = G * (2 M_earth) / (2 R_earth)^2. Because the planet's mass is twice that of Earth, and the radius is also twice.

Wait, let's compute that. Let me write it out:

g_planet = G * (2 M) / ( (2 R) )^2.

Simplifying the denominator: (2 R)^2 is 4 R^2. So,

g_planet = G * 2 M / (4 R^2) = (2 / 4) * (G M / R^2) ) = (1/2) * g_earth.

Wait, so g_planet is half of Earth's gravity? Because 2 divided by 4 is 0.5. So the astronaut's weight on the planet would be half of what it is on Earth.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the planet is more massive. Wait, no, because the radius also increased, which affects the gravity. So maybe the increased mass would make g stronger, but the larger radius makes it weaker. Let's see.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Mass is 2M, radius is 2R. So:

g_planet = G * (2M) / ( (2R)^2 ) = G * 2M / (4 R²) ) = (2/4) * (G M/R²) ) = 0.5 * g_earth.

Oh right, so the gravity on the planet is half that of Earth. So if on Earth, his weight is 800 N, on the planet it would be 800 * 0.5 = 400 N.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, because the planet's mass is twice, but radius is also twice. So the gravitational acceleration isn't just based on mass and radius. Let me think: when mass doubles, g increases proportionally. But when radius doubles, g decreases by a factor of 1/(2²) = 1/4. So combined, 2 * (1/4) = 1/2. So yes, g is half.

So the astronaut would weigh half as much. So 800 N on Earth becomes 400 N on the planet. Let's look at the options. Option F is 400 N. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, weight is mass times gravity. So if the astronaut's mass is m, then on Earth, 800 N is m * g_earth. On the planet, it's m * g_planet. Since g_planet is half, it's 800 * 0.5 = 400 N. So yes, F is correct.

I think that's right. So the answer is F.

To determine the astronaut's weight on the planet, we start by recalling that weight is given by \( W = m \cdot g \), where \( m \) is the astronaut's mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, the astronaut's weight is 800 N, so \( W_{\text{Earth}} = m \cdot g_{\text{Earth}} \). On the planet, the weight will be \( W_{\text{planet}} = m \cdot g_{\text{planet}} \). 

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a planet is given by \( g = \frac{G \cdot M}{R^2} \), where \( M \) is the planet's mass and \( R \) is its radius. For the planet in question, the mass is twice that of Earth (\( 2M_{\text{Earth}} \)) and the radius is also twice that of Earth (\( 2R_{\text{Earth}} \)).

Substituting these values into the formula for \( g_{\text{planet}} \), we get:

\[
g_{\text{planet}} = \frac{G \cdot (2M_{\text{Earth}})}{(2R_{\text{Earth}})^2} = \frac{2G \cdot M_{\text{Earth}}}{4R_{\text{Earth}}^2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{Earth}}}{R_{\text{Earth}}^2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_{\text{Earth}}.
\]

Thus, \( g_{\text{planet}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_{\text{Earth}} \). Since the astronaut's weight on the planet is proportional to \( g_{\text{planet}} \), we calculate:

\[
W_{\text{planet}} = m \cdot g_{\text{planet}} = m \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot g_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot W_{\text{Earth}}.
\]

Given \( W_{\text{Earth}} = 800 \, \text{N} \), the weight on the planet is:

\[
W_{\text{planet}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 800 = 400 \, \text{N}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **F: 400 N**.
