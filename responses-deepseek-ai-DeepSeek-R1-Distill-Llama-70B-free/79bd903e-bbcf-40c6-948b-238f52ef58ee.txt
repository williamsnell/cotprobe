Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let's read it carefully.

Shannon forgot her pillow while camping, so she had to sleep with her head flat on the ground. She didn't think to fold up her jeans and sweater to use as a substitute. The question is asking which psychological concept this illustrates.

The options are A to J, each a different cognitive bias or heuristic. I remember that heuristics are mental shortcuts that can sometimes lead to errors.

Let me think about each option:

A: Functional fixedness. I think this is when you can't see alternative uses for an object because you're fixated on its usual function. Like, if you only see a hammer as something to hit nails, not as a tool to open a can.

B: Availability heuristic. That's when you judge likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind. Like thinking plane crashes are more common than they are because they're more memorable.

C: Overconfidence effect. People are too confident in their judgments, even when they're not certain.

D: Representativeness heuristic. Judging probability based on how closely something matches a typical case, rather than the actual probabilities. Like thinking a taller person is more likely to be a basketball player.

E: Confirmation bias. Favoring information that confirms your existing beliefs.

F: Framing effect. How the presentation of information influences decisions, like "90% fat-free" vs "10% fat."

G: Hindsight bias. Believing, after an event, that you would have predicted it. Like "I knew that would happen."

H: Illusion of control. Thinking you can influence events that are actually random.

I: Cognitive dissonance. Discomfort when holding conflicting thoughts, leading to rationalization.

J: Anchoring effect. Relying too much on the first piece of information given when making decisions.

So the scenario is Shannon not using her clothes as a pillow substitute. Why didn't she think of that? It seems like she couldn't think outside the box. She probably saw her clothes only as clothing, not as something else. That sounds like functional fixedness. She was fixed on their usual function and couldn't see an alternative use.

Alternatively, maybe it's the availability heuristic if she didn't think of using clothes because she couldn't recall others doing it. But I think functional fixedness is more about not seeing alternative uses, which fits better here.

So the correct answer should be A: functional fixedness.

The scenario describes Shannon's inability to use her jeans and sweater as a pillow substitute, which suggests she couldn't see alternative uses for her clothing beyond their typical function. This aligns with the concept of functional fixedness, where one is fixated on the usual purpose of an object and fails to consider other potential uses. 

Answer: A
