Question:

At a bus station, buses begin their routes at 6:00 a.m. The schedule for two of the buses is based on the time intervals listed below.
* Bus A has a long route and leavesthe station every 75 minutes.
* Bus has a short route and leaves the station every 15 minutes.
What is the next time Bus A and BusB will leave the bus station at the same time?

Options:

A: 7:00 a.m.
B: 9:00 a.m.
C: 7:15 a.m.
D: 9:30 a.m.
E: 7:30 a.m.
F: 8:15 a.m.
G: 7:45 a.m.
H: 8:00 a.m.
I: 8:30 a.m.
J: 6:45 a.m.

Okay, so I've got this problem about two buses leaving a station at different intervals, and I need to find out when they'll both leave at the same time again. Hmm, let's break this down.

So Bus A leaves every 75 minutes, and Bus B every 15 minutes. The first time they both leave is at 6:00 a.m. because that's when they start. But the question is asking for the next time after that when both depart together.

I remember that when two things happen at regular intervals, the next time they coincide is the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. So I need to find the LCM of 75 and 15 minutes.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about that. Oh right, because 15 divides into 75 exactly five times. So the LCM of 75 and 15 is 75. Because 75 is a multiple of 15. So that means after 75 minutes, both buses will leave together again.

Wait, wait. Wait no. Because Bus B leaves every 15, so after 75 minutes, Bus B would have left five times (since 75/15=5). And Bus A would have left once. So yes, they both leave at 6:00 a.m. plus 75 minutes.

So adding 75 minutes to 6:00 a.m. Let's see. 60 minutes brings us to 7:00 a.m. Then 15 minutes more is 7:15. Oh wait, wait, no, 75 minutes is 1 hour and 15 minutes. So adding that to 6 a.m.:

6:00 a.m. + 1 hour is 7:00 a.m. Then +15 minutes is 7:15 a.m.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because Bus B leaves every 15 minutes, so it leaves at 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, etc. Bus A leaves at 6:00, then 7:15, 8:30, etc. So the next time they coincide is at 7:15 a.m.

Let me check the options. Option C is 7:15 a.m., which should be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should list the times each bus departs and see where they match again.

Bus A: 6:00, 7:15, 8:30, 9:45, etc.

Bus B: 6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, 7:30, etc.

Looking at this list, the next matching time after 6:00 is 7:15 a.m. So that's correct. So option C is the answer.

The next time Bus A and Bus B will leave the station together is at 7:15 a.m. 

This is determined by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals, which is 75 minutes. Adding this to 6:00 a.m. results in 7:15 a.m. 

Checking the departure times:
- Bus A: 6:00 a.m., 7:15 a.m., 8:30 a.m., etc.
- Bus B: 6:00 a.m., 6:15 a.m., 6:30 a.m., 6:45 a.m., 7:00 a.m., 7:15 a.m., etc.

The next matching departure time is 7:15 a.m.

Answer: C
