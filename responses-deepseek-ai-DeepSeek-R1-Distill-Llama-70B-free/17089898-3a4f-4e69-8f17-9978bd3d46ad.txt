Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about legal ethics, specifically dealing with attorney-client privilege. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a scenario where an attorney is subpoenaed to a deposition and is asked to provide confidential client information. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that attorney-client privilege is a fundamental concept in legal ethics. The basic idea is that communications between a client and their attorney are confidential and protected. This privilege exists to allow clients to speak freely with their attorneys without fear of their conversations being disclosed.

Now, the question is about a former client. I think the key here is whether the privilege continues even after the attorney-client relationship has ended. From what I recall, the privilege persists beyond the termination of the relationship. So even if the client is no longer active, the attorney is still bound by the duty of confidentiality.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Provide info if it puts the client in a favorable light. That doesn't seem right. The attorney's duty is to protect confidentiality regardless of whether it's favorable or not.

Option B: Provide if the client gave verbal permission. I think a client's consent can waive the privilege, but I'm not sure if verbal is enough. Sometimes written consent is preferred, but I'm not certain. This might be a possibility, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: Provide if it's pertinent. Pertinence doesn't override the privilege. Just because it's relevant doesn't mean the attorney can disclose it.

Option D: Provide if the opposing attorney insists. No, the opposing counsel's insistence doesn't negate the privilege. The attorney should stand their ground unless there's a legal basis to disclose.

Option E: Refuse unless the client is present. I don't think the client's presence is required for the attorney to assert the privilege. The attorney can claim it without the client being there.

Option F: Disclose if it's been a reasonable time since the relationship ended. Time doesn't affect the privilege. It's not about how long ago it was but whether the privilege still applies.

Option G: Provide since privilege is waived. Waiver usually happens if the client discloses the info themselves or in certain other situations, but the question doesn't mention any waiver. So this might not be correct.

Option H: Provide if it doesn't harm the client's case. The harm isn't the determining factor. The privilege is about confidentiality, not potential harm.

Option I: Assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver. This sounds right. The attorney should claim the privilege unless the client has waived it, typically through a signed document.

Option J: Refuse without a court order. I think the attorney can refuse based on the privilege without waiting for a court order. But sometimes, the court might compel the testimony, but the attorney's first step would be to assert the privilege.

Wait, but how does this work in practice? If the attorney is subpoenaed and asked to testify, they should assert the privilege. If the court then orders them to testify despite the privilege, they might have to comply, but that's not one of the options here.

So the correct approach is for the attorney to assert the privilege unless the client has waived it. That points to option I.

Wait, but what about option J? It says refuse without a court order. I think the attorney should first assert the privilege, which is option I. Because even if the court orders, the attorney can still challenge it, but the initial duty is to assert the privilege unless waived.

So the correct answer is I: assert the privilege unless the client has signed a waiver.

The correct answer is based on the principle that attorney-client privilege persists even after the attorney-client relationship ends. The attorney must assert this privilege unless the client has explicitly waived it, typically through a signed document. Among the options provided, option I correctly reflects this duty.

I

Answer: I
