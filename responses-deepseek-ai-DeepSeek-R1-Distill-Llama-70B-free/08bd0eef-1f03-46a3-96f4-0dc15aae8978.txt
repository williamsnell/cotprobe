Okay, so I've got this problem here about a gas sample and I'm supposed to find the pressure using the perfect gas law. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The perfect gas law is PV = nRT, right? So I need to find P, the pressure.

Alright, the given data: the mass of neon is 255 mg. Oh wait, mg is milligrams, so that's 0.255 grams. Neon is the gas here. The volume is 3.00 dm³. I remember that 1 dm³ is equal to 1 liter, so that's 3.00 L. The temperature is 122 K. 

Wait, the gas constant R is needed here. I think R has different values depending on the units. Since the pressure is to be in atm, I should probably use R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Yeah, that makes sense because then the units will work out.

First, I need to find the number of moles of neon. Molar mass of neon... Neon is Ne, right? Its atomic weight is about 20.18 g/mol. So moles n = mass / molar mass. The mass is 0.255 g. So n = 0.255 g / 20.18 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.255 divided by 20.18. Hmm, 20 times 0.0127 is about 0.254, so maybe approximately 0.0126 moles.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 20.18 times 0.0126 is around 0.25468 g, right? So 0.255 / 20.18 = approximately 0.01263 mol.

Now, plug into PV = nRT. I need to solve for P, so P = (nRT)/V.

n is 0.01263 mol, R is 0.0821, T is 122 K, V is 3.00 L.

Let me compute the numerator first: nRT = (0.01263) * (0.0821) * 122.

Calculating step by step:

0.01263 * 0.0821 = let's see. 0.01 * 0.0821 is 0.000821. 0.00263 * 0.0821 is approx 0.000216. So total is around 0.001037.

Wait, perhaps more accurately: 0.01263 * 0.0821.

0.01 * 0.0821 = 0.000821.

0.002 * 0.0821 = 0.0001642.

0.00063 * 0.0821 = 0.0000517.

Adding them together: 0.000821 + 0.0001642 = 0.0009852 + 0.0000517 = 0.0010369.

So nR is approximately 0.0010369, and then multiply by T=122.

0.0010369 * 122. Let's compute that.

0.001 * 122 = 0.122.

0.0000369 *122 ≈ 0.0045.

So total is approximately 0.1265.

So nRT ≈ 0.1265 L·atm.

Then, P = nRT / V = 0.1265 / 3.00 = 0.042166... atm.

Wait, but that gives me about 0.0422 atm, which is 4.22 x 10^-2 atm. Looking at the options, I see option A is 4.20e-2, option G is 4.90e-2, etc. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations. Let me recalculate n.

n = 0.255 g / 20.18 g/mol.

Let me compute that exactly. 20.18 into 0.255.

20.18 * 0.0126 is about 0.2547 (as before). So 0.255 / 20.18 ≈ 0.01263 mol.

So n=0.01263.

Then nRT = 0.01263 * 0.0821 * 122.

Let me compute 0.01263 * 0.0821 first.

0.01263 * 0.0821.

Compute 1263e-5 * 821e-4 = ?

Wait, maybe using calculator-like steps.

0.01 * 0.0821 = 0.000821.

0.002 * 0.0821 = 0.0001642.

0.0006 * 0.0821 = 0.00004926.

0.00003 * 0.0821 = 0.000002463.

Adding all these together: 0.000821 + 0.0001642 = 0.0009852; +0.00004926 = 0.00103446; +0.000002463 = 0.001036923.

So nR = 0.01263 * 0.0821 = approximately 0.0010369 L·atm/(mol·K) * mol = 0.0010369 L·atm/K.

Multiply by T=122 K: 0.0010369 * 122 = let me compute that.

0.0010369 * 100 = 0.10369.

0.0010369 * 22 = approx 0.02281.

Total is 0.10369 + 0.02281 = 0.1265 L·atm.

So P = 0.1265 / 3.00 = 0.0421666... atm.

So that's 4.21666e-2 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.20e-2, which is very close. But wait, perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, another approach: calculate n more accurately.

n = 0.255 g / 20.18 g/mol.

Let me compute 0.255 / 20.18.

20.18 × 0.0126 = 0.25468. So 0.255 is 0.00032 more than 0.25468. So 0.00032 / 20.18 = 0.00001583. So n=0.01261583 mol.

So n is approximately 0.0126158 mol.

Then, nRT: 0.0126158 * 0.0821 * 122.

Let me compute 0.0126158 * 0.0821 first.

0.0126158 * 0.08 = 0.001009264.

0.0126158 * 0.0021 = 0.0000264938.

Adding these gives 0.001009264 + 0.0000264938 = 0.0010357578.

Now multiply by 122:

0.0010357578 * 122.

Compute 0.0010357578 * 100 = 0.10357578.

0.0010357578 * 22 = ?

Compute 0.0010357578 * 20 = 0.020715158.

0.0010357578 * 2 = 0.0020715156.

Adding these: 0.020715158 + 0.0020715156 = 0.0227866736.

So total nRT = 0.10357578 + 0.0227866736 = 0.1263624536 L·atm.

Then P = 0.1263624536 / 3.00 L = 0.04212084 atm.

Which is approximately 4.21208e-2 atm. So 0.04212 atm.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.20e-2, which is 0.0420. Option I is 3.98e-2, which is 0.0398. So my calculation is closer to 4.21e-2, which is option A: 4.20e-2.

But wait, let me check if I made any miscalculations. Perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute n more accurately.

n = 0.255 g / 20.18 g/mol.

Let me compute 20.18 × 0.01263: 20 * 0.01263 = 0.2526; 0.18 *0.01263=0.0022714 → total 0.2526 + 0.0022714 = 0.2548714. So 20.18 * 0.01263 = 0.2548714 g.

But the mass is 0.255 g, so 0.255 - 0.2548714 = 0.0001286 g left.

So 0.0001286 g / 20.18 g/mol = 6.37e-6 mol.

So n = 0.01263 + 0.00000637 = 0.01263637 mol.

So n ≈ 0.012636 mol.

Now nRT = 0.012636 × 0.0821 × 122.

Calculating step by step.

First, 0.012636 × 0.0821:

0.01 × 0.0821 = 0.000821.

0.002 × 0.0821 = 0.0001642.

0.0006 × 0.0821 = 0.00004926.

0.00003 × 0.0821 = 0.000002463.

0.000006 × 0.0821 = 0.0000004926.

Adding all these:

0.000821 + 0.0001642 = 0.0009852.

+ 0.00004926 → 0.00103446.

+ 0.000002463 → 0.001036923.

+ 0.0000004926 → 0.0010374156.

So nR is approximately 0.0010374156.

Multiply by T=122:

0.0010374156 × 122.

Let me compute:

0.0010374156 × 100 = 0.10374156.

0.0010374156 × 22 = 0.02283. Let's compute more accurately.

0.0010374156 × 20 = 0.020748316.

0.0010374156 × 2 = 0.002074831.

Total for 22: 0.020748316 + 0.002074831 = 0.022823147.

So total nRT = 0.10374156 + 0.022823147 = 0.126564707 L·atm.

Then P = 0.126564707 / 3.00 = 0.04218823 atm.

So approximately 0.04219 atm, which is 4.219e-2 atm.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.20e-2, which is 0.0420. But my calculation gives 0.04219, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Wait, maybe the options are rounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the units earlier. Let me double-check the given values.

The volume is 3.00 dm³, which I correctly converted to 3.00 L. The temperature is 122 K, correct. Mass is 255 mg → 0.255 g, correct. Molar mass of Ne is approximately 20.18 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps the molar mass is 20.18 g/mol, but maybe I should use a more precise value. Let me check: Neon's molar mass is about 20.1797 g/mol. So 20.1797.

So n = 0.255 g / 20.1797 g/mol = ?

Compute 0.255 / 20.1797.

Hmm, 20.1797 × 0.0126 = 0.2545 approximately (20 * 0.0126 = 0.252; 0.1797 *0.0126 ≈ 0.00226 → total ≈ 0.25426 g). So 0.25426, but the mass is 0.255, so the remaining is 0.00074 g. So 0.00074 / 20.1797 ≈ 0.0000366 mol.

So n ≈ 0.0126 + 0.0000366 = 0.0126366 mol.

Wait, earlier I had 0.012636 mol, so same as before.

Hmm, so perhaps the calculation is correct, giving approximately 4.219e-2 atm, which is very close to option A: 4.20e-2. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me see the options again. Option A is 4.20e-2, which is 0.0420. But my calculation is 0.042188, which is about 4.219e-2. So 0.0422 is closer to 4.22e-2, but the options don't have that. The options jump from 4.20e-2 to 4.90e-2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute with more precise R? Wait, R is 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K), often approximated as 0.0821. But using precise R might change the result a little.

Let me recalculate with R = 0.082057.

So nRT = 0.0126366 mol * 0.082057 L·atm/mol·K * 122 K.

Compute 0.0126366 * 0.082057 first.

0.01 * 0.082057 = 0.00082057.

0.002 * 0.082057 = 0.000164114.

0.0006 * 0.082057 = 0.0000492342.

0.00003 * 0.082057 = 0.00000246171.

0.0000066 * 0.082057 ≈ 0.0000005415.

Adding all:

0.00082057 + 0.000164114 = 0.000984684.

+ 0.0000492342 → 0.001033918.

+ 0.00000246171 → 0.00103638.

+ 0.0000005415 → 0.0010369215.

So nR = 0.0010369215.

Multiply by T=122: 0.0010369215 * 122.

0.0010369215 * 100 = 0.10369215.

0.0010369215 * 22 = 0.02282. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.0010369215 * 20 = 0.02073843.

0.0010369215 * 2 = 0.002073843.

Adding: 0.02073843 + 0.002073843 = 0.022812273.

Total nRT = 0.10369215 + 0.022812273 = 0.126504423 L·atm.

Then P = 0.126504423 / 3.00 = 0.04216814 atm.

So 0.042168 atm, which is 4.2168e-2 atm. So approximately 4.217e-2 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 4.20e-2, but perhaps it's option I: 3.98e-2? No, that's lower. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of n. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the molar mass more precisely. Let me compute n more accurately.

n = 0.255 g / 20.1797 g/mol.

Let me compute 0.255 ÷ 20.1797.

Using a calculator approach:

20.1797 × 0.0126 = 0.25425 (approx).

0.255 - 0.25425 = 0.00075.

So 0.00075 / 20.1797 ≈ 0.00003716 mol.

So n = 0.0126 + 0.00003716 = 0.01263716 mol.

Hmm, same as before.

So perhaps my calculation is correct, but the options don't have the exact match. Wait, looking at the options, option A is 4.20e-2, which is 0.0420. My calculation gives 0.04217, which is 4.217e-2. So 4.22e-2, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for volume. The volume is 3.00 dm³, which is 3.00 liters, right? Yes.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the temperature was in Celsius instead of Kelvin. But no, the problem states 122 K, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted the pressure into a different unit, but the problem asks for atm, so that's correct.

Wait, could I have messed up the formula? PV = nRT → P = nRT/(V).

Yes, that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the given mass is 255 mg, which is 0.255 grams. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for n. Let me calculate n as 0.255 / 20.1797.

Using a calculator:

20.1797 × 0.0126 = 0.25425042.

0.255 - 0.25425042 = 0.00074958 grams.

0.00074958 / 20.1797 = approx 0.00003714 mol.

So n = 0.0126 + 0.00003714 = 0.01263714 mol.

So n ≈ 0.012637 mol.

So nRT = 0.012637 * 0.082057 * 122.

Wait, let me compute 0.012637 * 0.082057.

0.01 * 0.082057 = 0.00082057.

0.002 * 0.082057 = 0.000164114.

0.0006 * 0.082057 = 0.000049234.

0.00003 * 0.082057 = 0.0000024617.

0.000007 * 0.082057 = 0.0000005744.

Adding all:

0.00082057 + 0.000164114 = 0.000984684.

+ 0.000049234 →
