Okay, so I've got this differential equation to solve: x squared times y double prime minus 2y equals zero. The initial conditions are y(1) equals 1 and y prime at 1 equals gamma. I need to find gamma such that the solution is bounded as x approaches zero. Hmm, okay.

Wait, so the equation is x² y'' - 2y = 0. That looks like a second-order linear differential equation, but it's not constant coefficients because of the x squared term. I remember that equations with variable coefficients often require methods like substitution or maybe using known series solutions.

I think this is a Cauchy-Euler equation. Right, Cauchy-Euler equations have terms like x^n y^(n), so yeah, this fits. The standard form is x² y'' + a x y' + b y = 0. So in this case, comparing to the standard form, the equation becomes x² y'' - 2y = 0, so the coefficients for y' is zero, and b is -2.

For Cauchy-Euler equations, the solution method usually involves assuming a solution of the form y = x^r. Let's try that. Plugging y = x^r into the equation:

First, compute y'': the second derivative of x^r is r(r-1) x^{r-2}.

So substituting into the equation: x² * r(r-1)x^{r-2} - 2x^r = 0.

Simplify that: x² times x^{r-2} is x^r, so the first term becomes r(r-1) x^r. Then subtract 2 x^r.

So the equation becomes [r(r-1) - 2] x^r = 0. Since x^r isn't zero (except at x=0, but we're looking at x>0), the coefficient must be zero.

So the characteristic equation is r(r-1) - 2 = 0.

Let's solve that. r² - r - 2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula: r = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3]/2. So roots are (1+3)/2=2 and (1-3)/2=-1.

So the general solution is y = C1 x^2 + C2 x^{-1}.

Wait, but the problem is about the solution being bounded as x approaches zero. So I need to check the behavior of each term as x approaches zero.

x^2 as x approaches zero approaches zero, which is fine. But x^{-1} is 1/x, which goes to infinity as x approaches zero. So to keep y bounded near x=0, the coefficient C2 must be zero. Otherwise, y would blow up.

So the solution must be y = C1 x^2. But we have initial conditions at x=1. Let's apply those.

At x=1, y(1) = C1*(1)^2 + C2*(1)^{-1} = C1 + C2 = 1. But since C2 is zero for boundedness, this gives C1 = 1.

Wait no, wait: if C2 is zero, then y = C1 x^2, so y(1) = C1 =1, so C1 is 1.

But wait, I think I might have gotten ahead of myself. Let me write down the general solution again. y = C1 x² + C2 x^{-1}.

But for y to be bounded as x→0, the term with x^{-1} must vanish because that's the only term that blows up. So C2 must be zero. Therefore, the solution is y = C1 x².

Now apply initial conditions at x=1: y(1) = C1*(1)^2 = C1 =1, so C1=1. So y = x².

But what about the derivative? Let me compute y'. y = x², so y' = 2x. At x=1, y' is 2. So according to the initial condition y'(1)=gamma, that means gamma is 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the general solution is y = C1 x^2 + C2 x^{-1}, then the derivative is y' = 2 C1 x^{-1} - C2 x^{-2}.

Wait, no: wait, derivative of x^2 is 2x, and derivative of x^{-1} is -x^{-2}. So y' = 2 C1 x - C2 x^{-2}.

Wait, that's correct. So at x=1, y' = 2 C1 *1 - C2 *1^{-2} = 2 C1 - C2.

But from the initial condition y(1)=1, we have C1 + C2 =1.

So we have two equations:

1) C1 + C2 =1.

2) 2 C1 - C2 = gamma.

But we also require that y is bounded as x approaches zero. So in y, the term with x^{-1} must have C2=0. Therefore, equation 1 becomes C1 =1.

Then equation 2 becomes 2*(1) - 0 = gamma, so gamma is 2.

So the correct option should be G, which is 2.

To solve the initial value problem \( x^2 y'' - 2y = 0 \) with \( y(1) = 1 \) and \( y'(1) = \gamma \), we first recognize that this is a Cauchy-Euler equation. The general solution for such equations is typically of the form \( y = x^r \), where \( r \) is determined by the characteristic equation.

1. **Find the characteristic equation**: Substituting \( y = x^r \) into the differential equation gives:
   \[
   x^2 \cdot r(r-1)x^{r-2} - 2x^r = 0 \implies [r(r-1) - 2]x^r = 0.
   \]
   Since \( x^r \neq 0 \), the characteristic equation is:
   \[
   r(r-1) - 2 = 0 \implies r^2 - r - 2 = 0.
   \]

2. **Solve the characteristic equation**: Using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   r = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}.
   \]
   The roots are \( r = 2 \) and \( r = -1 \). Thus, the general solution is:
   \[
   y = C_1 x^2 + C_2 x^{-1}.
   \]

3. **Ensure boundedness as \( x \to 0 \)**: The term \( x^{-1} \) diverges as \( x \to 0 \), so for \( y \) to remain bounded, the coefficient \( C_2 \) must be zero. Therefore, the solution simplifies to:
   \[
   y = C_1 x^2.
   \]

4. **Apply initial conditions**: Using \( y(1) = 1 \):
   \[
   y(1) = C_1 \cdot 1^2 = C_1 \implies C_1 = 1.
   \]
   Thus, the solution is \( y = x^2 \).

5. **Compute \( y' \) and apply \( y'(1) = \gamma \)**: Differentiating \( y = x^2 \) gives:
   \[
   y' = 2x.
   \]
   At \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   y'(1) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \implies \gamma = 2.
   \]

Thus, the value of \( \gamma \) that ensures the solution is bounded as \( x \to 0 \) is \( 2 \).
