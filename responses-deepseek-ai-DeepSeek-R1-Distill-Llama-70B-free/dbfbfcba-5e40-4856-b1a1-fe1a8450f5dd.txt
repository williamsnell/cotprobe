Question:

Match Co. manufactures a product with the following costs per unit based on a maximum plant capacity of 400000 units per year: Direct materials $ 60 Direct labor 10 Variable overhead 40 Fixed overhead 30 Total $140 Match has a ready market for all 400000 units at a selling price of $200 each. Selling costs in this market consist of $10 per unit shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50000 per year. Reno Co. wishes to buy 5000 of these units on a special order. There would be no shipping costs on this special order. What is the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno?

Options:

A: $160
B: $110
C: $190
D: $180
E: $230
F: 200
G: $240
H: $220
I: $210
J: $140

Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I have this accounting problem here, and I need to figure out the lowest price Match Co. should sell 5000 units to Reno. Hmm, let me read it again.

Alright, so Match's product has several costs per unit when they're running at maximum capacity, which is 400,000 units a year. The breakdown is:

- Direct materials: $60
- Direct labor: $10
- Variable overhead: $40
- Fixed overhead: $30

So total cost per unit is $140. They can sell all 400,000 units at $200 each, which is good. Their selling costs include $10 per unit for shipping and a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 a year.

Now, Reno wants to buy 5000 units on a special order, and there's no shipping cost involved. I need to find the lowest price per unit Match should be willing to accept for this order.

Wait, so I think this is a special order decision problem. In such cases, we consider incremental costs. Because Reno's order is outside their regular sales, but they can produce these extra units without affecting regular sales, right?

Wait, but wait. Wait, their maximum capacity is 400,000. Are they already selling all 400,000 units? The question says they have a ready market for all 400k units. So they're selling all they can make. So if Reno wants 5000 more, does that mean they have to go beyond capacity? Oh, but wait, maybe they have some spare capacity. Hmm, the question doesn't specify if they're currently at full capacity. Wait, it says 'maximum plant capacity of 400,000 per year.' So if they're selling all 400k, they are at full capacity. So taking this order would require overtime or perhaps they can't produce extra. Or maybe they can adjust, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, maybe they have some unused capacity. Because it's maximum capacity, but perhaps they're not using all of it right now. Wait, the problem doesn't explicitly say, but I think I should assume they are at maximum capacity because they're selling all 400k units. So, if they take this order, they have to either forgo some regular sales or go into overtime.

Wait, but the question is about the special order. If they can produce more, but I think the key is that the fixed costs are allocated per unit based on 400k units. So the fixed overhead is part of the total cost when they are at that capacity.

But when considering a special order, the main thing is to calculate the incremental costs. So the variable costs plus any fixed costs that would be additional. But wait, fixed overhead is already allocated, so maybe in this case, the fixed overhead is a sunk cost.

Wait, so for the special order, what costs would be incurred? Direct materials, direct labor, variable overhead, and any additional fixed costs. But if they're already at capacity, producing 5000 more might require additional fixed costs like overtime, but the question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps they have no excess capacity, so they can't take the order without reducing regular sales. But I think the problem is assuming they can take the order, perhaps by using overtime or that the 5000 units don't exceed their capacity.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that they have the capacity to produce the extra 5000 units without affecting their regular sales. So maybe they're not at full capacity. Or perhaps the maximum capacity is a constraint, but since the question is about a special order, maybe the 5000 units are within their capacity.

Wait, the question doesn't specify whether they're currently at capacity, but since they can sell all 400k, I think it's safe to assume they are operating at capacity. So, if Reno wants 5000 units, perhaps Match has to give up some regular sales to produce these, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, they might have unused capacity, perhaps because they can produce more but aren't due to market constraints. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the 400,000 units is their maximum production, so any special order beyond that can't be accepted without cutting into regular sales. But the problem says Reno wants to buy 5000 units, so I think the assumption is that Match can produce these without affecting regular sales, perhaps by having some excess capacity or by producing in a way that doesn't interfere.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The key is to determine the minimum selling price for the special order. The minimum price would be based on the incremental costs of producing those 5000 units.

The incremental costs per unit would be the variable costs. So, variable costs are direct materials, direct labor, and variable overhead. Let me add those up: 60 +10 +40 = $110 per unit. So, the variable cost is $110 per unit.

Now, the fixed costs are $30 per unit, but those are already allocated based on 400k units. Since the fixed costs are allocated, and the special order doesn't increase fixed costs, perhaps those are sunk and not relevant here.

Additionally, the selling costs for the regular market include $10 per unit shipping, but for the special order, there are no shipping costs. So, the shipping cost per unit is saved. So, the shipping cost is $10, so in the special order, that's not an expense.

Wait, but the selling costs include a fixed licensing fee of $50,000 per year. Since this is a fixed cost, it's probably already accounted for in the fixed overhead. So, the fixed licensing fee is a fixed cost, so it doesn't change with the special order.

So, putting it all together, the cost to produce each unit for the special order is the variable cost of $110 per unit. Plus, any fixed costs that are incremental, but I don't think any are because the fixed licensing fee is already fixed.

Wait, but wait. The fixed overhead per unit is $30, but that's based on 400k units. So, if they produce 5000 more, the fixed overhead per unit would change, but since the fixed overhead is a total amount, not per unit. Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think: The fixed overhead is a total of $30 per unit * 400,000 units = $12,000,000 per year. So, the total fixed overhead is $12 million, regardless of how many units are produced beyond that. So, producing the 5000 units doesn't add to the fixed overhead; it's already spent.

So, the only costs that matter for the special order are the variable costs: $60 + $10 + $40 = $110 per unit. So, the minimum price they can accept is $110 per unit, which is option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because sometimes, in special orders, you also consider whether the order would affect regular sales. For example, if you have excess capacity, you might take the order at variable cost. But if you don't have excess capacity, you might have to compare the contribution margin of the special order to the regular sales. But in this case, since the regular sales are already at maximum capacity, if they take the special order, they would have to forgo some regular sales. So, that would be a different scenario.

Wait, but the question says they have a ready market for all 400k units, so I think they're selling all they can make. So, if they take the special order of 5000, they might have to reduce regular sales by 5000 units to produce for Reno. So, in that case, the decision would be whether the special order's price is higher than the regular price minus the costs saved on the regular units. But that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, no, if they're at full capacity, taking the special order would require them to either forgo regular sales or incur additional costs (like overtime). But the problem doesn't mention anything about overtime or additional fixed costs. So perhaps in this scenario, they can't take the order without reducing regular sales.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum price they should accept for the special order, so I think it's considering the scenario where they have excess capacity. Because otherwise, if they can't produce without cutting into regular sales, the calculation would involve comparing the regular price's contribution margin with the special order's.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5000 units don't require reducing regular sales because they have some slack. I'm a bit confused now.

Let me try to lay it out:

1. If they have excess capacity (i.e., they can produce 5000 more units without affecting regular sales):
   - The incremental cost is just the variable cost per unit: $110.
   - So, minimum price is $110.

2. If they don't have excess capacity (i.e., they have to forgo 5000 units of regular sales to make 5000 for Reno):
   - The incremental cost is the variable cost per unit ($110) plus the opportunity cost of losing the regular sales.
   - The regular sales contribute (Selling price - variable costs) per unit.
   - Selling price is $200, variable cost is $110, so contribution per unit is $90.
   - So, for 5000 units, the opportunity cost is 5000 * $90 = $450,000.
   - So, the minimum price would be variable cost + opportunity cost per unit.
   - Wait, but per unit, that would be $110 + $90 = $200, which is the same as regular price. So, they shouldn't sell below $200 unless the variable cost is covered, but since the opportunity cost is $90, perhaps the minimum is the variable cost plus the opportunity cost, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, in the without excess capacity scenario, the minimum selling price should at least cover the variable costs plus the opportunity cost of the lost sales. So, per unit, that would be variable cost ($110) plus the contribution margin from regular sales ($90). So total per unit is $200. So, they shouldn't sell below $200, which is their regular price.

But wait, the options don't have $200 as the correct answer. Let me check the options again. Option F is $200, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

So, the confusion is whether they have excess capacity or not. The problem states that their maximum plant capacity is 400k, and they have a market for all 400k units. So, I think they are producing at maximum capacity, so they can't take any more orders without cutting into regular sales.

So, in that case, the special order of 5000 units would require them to forgo 5000 units of regular sales. Therefore, the minimum price should be such that the total contribution from the special order is at least equal to the contribution from the regular sales.

So, let's compute the total contribution for 5000 units at the regular price: 5000 * ($200 - $110) = 5000 * $90 = $450,000.

If they sell to Reno, each unit would have variable costs of $110, but no shipping cost ($10). Wait, the shipping cost is part of selling expenses. So, in regular sales, they have selling expenses of $10 per unit plus fixed licensing fee. But for Reno, no shipping, so the selling expense per unit is $0 for shipping, but the fixed licensing fee remains.

Wait, but the fixed licensing fee is a fixed cost, so it's not per unit. So, perhaps I should consider that when calculating the minimum price for Reno.

Wait, the selling costs are $10 per unit shipping and $50,000 fixed. So, for Reno's order, there's no shipping, so variable selling cost is $0 instead of $10. Therefore, when calculating the minimum price, we should subtract that $10 from the variable cost.

Wait, so the variable costs for production are $110, and the variable selling cost is $10. So, total variable cost per unit is $120. But for Reno, the variable selling cost is $0, so total variable cost is $110.

So, the minimum price they can accept would be the variable production cost plus any avoided variable selling costs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me structure this.

When selling to Reno:

- Production variable costs: $60 + $10 + $40 = $110
- Selling variable costs: $0 (no shipping)
So, total incremental cost per unit is $110.

But if they have to forgo regular sales to make this, then they lose the contribution from those regular sales. So, the minimum price should be at least the variable cost plus the opportunity cost.

Each regular unit contributes ($200 selling price - $110 variable cost) = $90.

So, the minimum price per unit for Reno would be the variable cost of $110 plus the opportunity cost of $90, totaling $200. But that's the same as the regular selling price. But wait, that can't be right because they're incurring $110 in costs and getting $200, but if they don't take the Reno order, they could sell 5000 more at $200 each, making $1,000,000 in revenue, with variable costs of $550,000 (5000 * 110), so profit of $450,000.

If they take Reno's order, they get 5000 units * price P, with variable costs 5000 * 110. The profit would be 5000*(P - 110). But they lose the 5000 units * $90 contribution from regular sales. So, the total profit would be 5000*(P -110) - 5000*90 = 5000*(P - 200).

To make this at least equal to not taking the order, which would give 0 (since they can't take the order if they're at capacity), so the profit from taking the order should be >= 0. So, 5000*(P -200) >= 0 → P >= 200.

Wait, so the minimum price would be $200. But that's their regular price. So, they shouldn't sell below $200 because otherwise, they'd be losing money compared to not taking the order.

But wait, another approach: the special order's price should be at least equal to the incremental revenue after covering incremental costs. But if they can't produce the units without cutting regular sales, the price must cover the variable costs plus the opportunity cost.

So, the minimum price is variable cost plus the contribution margin per unit from regular sales.

Variable cost is $110, contribution margin is $90, so min price is $200.

But wait, looking back, in the problem statement, Reno is a special order, so perhaps the assumption is that they can take this without affecting regular sales, which would mean they have excess capacity. So, in that case, the minimum price would be the variable cost of $110.

But the problem says they have a ready market for all 400k units, implying they are selling all they can, so perhaps they're at maximum capacity, making the special order require cutting into regular sales.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to think of it another way.

If they have no excess capacity:

- Producing for Reno requires giving up 5000 regular units.
- So, the revenue from Reno should be at least equal to the revenue from regular sales for those 5000 units, minus any cost savings.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to compare the incremental revenue from Reno with the incremental costs and the opportunity cost of lost sales.

So, if they accept Reno's order:

- They get revenue R per unit * 5000.
- They incur incremental costs: variable production costs (5000 * 110) and variable selling costs (but Reno's order has no shipping, so selling variable cost is 0 instead of 5000*10.
Wait, but in regular sales, the variable selling cost is $10 per unit. So, for each unit sold to Reno instead of a regular customer, they save $10 in variable selling costs.

Wait, so the incremental cost for Reno's order is:

Variable production cost: 5000 * 110 = 550,000.

But, they save on variable selling costs: 5000 * 10 = 50,000.

So, net incremental cost is 550,000 - 50,000 = 500,000.

Additionally, they lose the contribution from 5000 regular units, which is 5000*(200 - 110) = 450,000.

So, the total amount they need to cover is the net incremental cost plus the lost contribution.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

The total cost to produce Reno's order is 5000*(60+10+40) = 5000*110 = 550,000.

But by not selling 5000 units regularly, they lose revenue of 5000*200 = 1,000,000, but save variable costs of 5000*110 = 550,000, and save variable selling costs of 5000*10=50,000.

So, the net loss from lost sales is 1,000,000 - (550,000 +50,000) = 1,000,000 - 600,000 = 400,000.

So, the total cost for Reno's order is 550,000 (production) but they lose 400,000 from lost sales.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, the total impact on profit would be:

Profit from Reno: 5000*R - 5000*110

Minus lost profit from regular sales: 5000*(200 - 110 -10) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of net gain.

If they accept Reno's order:

- They gain: 5000*R (revenue)
- They spend: 5000*110 (variable production) + 0 (shipping, since Reno doesn't require shipping)
- They lose: 5000*200 (revenue from regular sales) - 5000*(110 +10) (variable costs of regular sales)

So, the net effect on profit is:

Gain: 5000R - 5000*110
Loss: 5000*200 - 5000*(110+10) = 5000*(200 -120) = 5000*80 = 400,000

So, the total change in profit is (5000R - 550,000) - 400,000 >= 0

So, 5000R >= 950,000 → R >= 190.

So, the minimum price would be $190 per unit.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the calculation is:

To not lose profit overall, the revenue from Reno must cover the cost of producing those units plus the lost profit from regular sales.

So, the lost profit is 5000*(200 -110 -10) = 5000*(80) = 400,000.

The cost to produce Reno's order is 5000*110 = 550,000.

So, total required revenue from Reno is 550,000 + 400,000 = 950,000.

Divide by 5000 units: 950,000 /5000 = 190.

So, $190 per unit, which is option
