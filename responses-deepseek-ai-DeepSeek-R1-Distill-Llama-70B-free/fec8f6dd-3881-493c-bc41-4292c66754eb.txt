Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating how many rolls of paper are needed to paper a room. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with area calculations and all the conversions, but I'll take it slow.

First, I need to find the total area of the walls that need to be covered. The room has dimensions: 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high. Oh wait, right, because when you're papering walls, you're covering the area of each wall. But wait, there are four walls, right? Two walls of one dimension and two of another.

So, the room is a rectangle, so there are two walls that are 18 feet long and 10 feet high, and the other two are 12 feet wide and 10 feet high. So the area for each pair would be calculated and then added together.

Let me write that down. The area of the long walls: each is 18ft by 10ft, so 18*10 = 180 square feet. Since there are two of them, that's 2*180 = 360 sq ft. Then the area of the shorter walls: each is 12ft by 10ft, so 12*10=120. Two of them would be 2*120=240 sq ft. So total wall area is 360 + 240 = 600 sq ft? Hmm, wait, but wait, I remember that in such problems, the ceiling and floor aren't usually included, just the walls. So that makes sense.

But wait, the problem also mentions openingsâ€”like a window and a door. These areas wouldn't be covered by paper, so I need to subtract them from the total wall area. Oh right, because you don't paper over doors and windows.

The window is 3ft by 8ft. So the area of the window is 3*8=24 sq ft. The door is 4ft by 9ft, so 4*9=36 sq ft. So total openings area is 24 +36=60 sq ft. So I need to subtract that from the total wall area.

So total paperable area is 600 -60 = 540 sq ft. Oh wait, but the problem says to allow for 10% waste of paper. Hmm, so that means I need to calculate the total area needed including this extra 10% for waste.

Wait, how does that work? So if I have X area needed, and I have a 10% waste, I need to adjust. Let me think. If I have 540 sq ft needed, but I have to account for 10% more because of waste. So 540 * 1.10 = 594 sq ft total paper needed.

Wait, no, wait. Another way: the usable paper is 90% of what's available, because 10% is wasted. So the total paper required including waste would be 540 / 0.9 = 600. Oh wait, because 540 is 90% of the total paper used (including waste). So to get the total paper, you do 540 divided by 0.9. Let me check that. If 10% is wasted, then 90% is used. So 540 = 0.9 * total. So total paper needed is 540 / 0.9 = 600 sq ft. So that makes sense.

Each roll is 36 square feet. So how many rolls are needed? So total paper needed is 600. Each roll is 36. So 600 /36 = 16.666... rolls. Since you can't have a fraction of a roll, you round up to the next whole number. So 17 rolls.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check all the steps because sometimes I might make a mistake.

So wall area: 2*(18*10 + 12*10) = 2*(180+120)=2*(300)=600. Correct.

Subtract window and door: 3*8=24, 4*9=36. Sum 60. So 600-60=540. Correct.

Then, for 10% waste, so total paper is 540 / 0.9 = 600. Correct.

Each roll is 36. 600 /36 = 16.666..., which is 16 and 2/3 rolls. So need to round up to 17 rolls. So the answer would be 17 rolls.

Looking at the options, option A is 17. So the answer is A.

Wait a minute, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Oh, wait, does the 10% waste apply to the total paper used, including the openings? Hmm, no, because the openings are subtracted before considering the waste. Because you can't waste paper on the areas where you don't paper, like windows and doors. So yes, the way I calculated it was correct.

Alternatively, imagine that: the 540 is the exact area needed, but since you have 10% waste, you'd need 540 * 1.1 = 594. Then divide by 36, which is 16.5, which rounds up to 17. Wait, but that gives the same result. Because 540 *1.1=594. 594/36=16.5 rolls. So you need 17 rolls.

So both methods give the same answer, which is 17. So I think that's correct.

To determine the number of single rolls required to paper the room, we start by calculating the total area of the walls. The room has dimensions 18 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high. There are two walls of each dimension:

- Area of the two longer walls:  
  \( 2 \times (18 \, \text{ft} \times 10 \, \text{ft}) = 2 \times 180 = 360 \, \text{sq ft} \)

- Area of the two shorter walls:  
  \( 2 \times (12 \, \text{ft} \times 10 \, \text{ft}) = 2 \times 120 = 240 \, \text{sq ft} \)

- Total wall area:  
  \( 360 + 240 = 600 \, \text{sq ft} \)

Next, we account for the openings (window and door), which are not papered. The window is \( 3 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} \), and the door is \( 4 \, \text{ft} \times 9 \, \text{ft} \):

- Area of the window:  
  \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \, \text{sq ft} \)

- Area of the door:  
  \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \, \text{sq ft} \)

- Total area of openings:  
  \( 24 + 36 = 60 \, \text{sq ft} \)

- Total paperable area:  
  \( 600 - 60 = 540 \, \text{sq ft} \)

To account for 10% waste, we calculate the total paper required, including the waste:

\[
\text{Total paper required} = \frac{540}{0.9} = 600 \, \text{sq ft}
\]

Each roll of paper covers \( 36 \, \text{sq ft} \). The number of rolls needed is:

\[
\text{Number of rolls} = \frac{600}{36} = 16.666\ldots
\]

Since we cannot use a fraction of a roll, we round up to the next whole number, which is 17 rolls.

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 17 rolls**.
