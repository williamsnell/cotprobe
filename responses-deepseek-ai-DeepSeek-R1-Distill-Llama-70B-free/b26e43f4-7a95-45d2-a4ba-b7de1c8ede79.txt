Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this economics question about the relationship between average product (AP) and marginal product (MP) of labor. Hmm, I remember from my classes that AP and MP are related but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I recall that the average product of labor is the total product divided by the number of labor units used. So AP = TP / L. Marginal product is the addition to the total product from adding one more unit of labor, so MP is the change in TP when L increases by one.

I think the key here is understanding how AP and MP graphs behave. I remember that the MP curve is derived from the AP curve. When MP is above AP, AP increases, and when MP is below AP, AP decreases. Oh wait, that sounds familiar. So the AP curve is rising as long as MP is above it, and it starts falling when MP drops below it.

Wait, so when the MP crosses the AP curve, that's a turning point for AP. Let me visualize this. The MP starts high, then as more labor is added, MP decreases. The AP starts lower, rises as MP is above it, and then after a certain point, when MP falls below AP, AP starts to decrease. So the point where MP and AP meet must be where AP is at its maximum because that's where it stops rising and starts falling.

So looking at the options, I'm looking for something that says AP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below it. Or maybe something about where they intersect.

Option B says AP rises when MP is above and falls when below. That sounds right. Option E is the oppositeâ€”AP falls when MP is above and rises when below. That doesn't fit what I was thinking. So B seems correct.

Wait, what about the intersection point? I think MP intersects AP at the maximum point of AP. So if the MP curve starts above AP, and then crosses it at the peak, then when MP is above, AP is rising, and once MP goes below AP, AP starts to fall.

So looking at the options, option B correctly describes this relationship. Let me check the other options quickly.

Option A: MP intersects AP at the minimum of MP. I don't think so. The minimum of MP would be at the end, but intersection is at the maximum AP.

Option G: MP intersects AP at maximum MP. No, because the maximum MP is at the very beginning when the first worker is added. So when MP is highest, AP is just the same as MP. Wait, no, when labor is 1, AP and MP are the same. As more labor comes in, AP increases until the point where MP equals AP again. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's clarify. For one worker, AP and MP are the same. As you add workers, MP might initially increase (if there's increasing marginal returns), but eventually, MP starts to decrease. So AP continues to rise as long as MP is higher than the current AP. The point where AP is at its maximum is where MP equals AP. After that, AP starts to fall because each additional worker adds less than the average.

So the intersection point is where MP crosses the AP curve from above. So that's the maximum of AP. So the statement that MP intersects AP at the maximum of AP would be correct. Looking at the options, option G says MP intersects AP at the maximum of MP. That's not right because the maximum of MP is earlier. So G is wrong.

So the correct statement is that AP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below. That's option B.

Wait, another point: the question is about the relationship. So the correct answer should be B.

The relationship between average product (AP) and marginal product (MP) of labor can be understood by analyzing how they behave as the level of labor changes. The average product (AP) is the total product divided by the number of labor units, while the marginal product (MP) represents the additional output from adding one more unit of labor. 

When MP is above AP, AP rises because each additional worker contributes more to the average. Conversely, when MP falls below AP, AP decreases because each additional worker contributes less than the current average. The point where MP intersects AP is where AP reaches its maximum, as this is the point where MP transitions from being above AP to below AP.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that "AP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below it," which aligns with the described behavior.
- **Option E** is incorrect because it reverses this relationship, stating that AP falls when MP is above it and rises when MP is below it.
- **Option G** is incorrect because it claims that MP intersects AP at the maximum of MP, whereas the intersection actually occurs at the maximum of AP.
- Other options either mischaracterize the relationship or are inconsistent with the behavior of AP and MP.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: AP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below it.**
