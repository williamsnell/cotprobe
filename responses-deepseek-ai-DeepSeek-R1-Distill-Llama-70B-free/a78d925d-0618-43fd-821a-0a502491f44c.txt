Okay, so I've got this problem here about making salad dressing by mixing vinegar and oil in certain parts. The question says that the dressing is made by combining 2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil. And the question is asking how many ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that when things are mixed in parts, it's usually about ratios. So the ratio here is vinegar to oil as 2 to 5. That means for every 2 parts of vinegar, you use 5 parts of oil. So the ratio is 2:5.

Now, the problem gives me 9 ounces of vinegar. I need to find out how much oil corresponds to that. So I think I can set up a proportion here. If 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil, then 9 ounces vinegar (which is the actual amount given) corresponds to X ounces oil.

Let me write that out as a proportion:

2 parts vinegar / 5 parts oil = 9 ounces vinegar / X ounces oil

Wait, no, actually, since it's vinegar to oil, the ratio should be 2/5 = 9/X. Because 2 parts vinegar is to 5 parts oil, so 2 divided by 5 is the same as 9 divided by X.

So, 2/5 = 9/X.

To solve for X, I can cross-multiply. So 2 * X = 5 * 9.

Calculating that: 2X = 45.

Then, divide both sides by 2: X = 45/2 = 22.5 ounces.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Because sometimes ratios can be tricky depending on how they're set up. The ratio is 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil. So for each 2 parts of vinegar, you add 5 parts oil. So if I have more vinegar, I need more oil.

So in this case, 2 parts vinegar is 9 ounces. So each part is 9 divided by 2, which is 4.5 ounces per part. Then, since oil is 5 parts, that's 5 times 4.5.

Let me calculate that: 5 * 4.5 = 22.5 ounces.

So that checks out. So the correct amount of oil is 22.5 ounces.

Looking at the options, option B is 22.5. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves mixing vinegar and oil in a specific ratio of 2:5. Given 9 ounces of vinegar, we need to determine the corresponding amount of oil. 

1. The ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5, meaning 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil.
2. Setting up the proportion: \( \frac{2}{5} = \frac{9}{X} \), where \( X \) is the amount of oil in ounces.
3. Cross-multiplying gives \( 2X = 45 \), so \( X = \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \) ounces.
4. Verifying, each "part" equals \( \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \) ounces. For oil (5 parts): \( 5 \times 4.5 = 22.5 \) ounces.

Thus, the correct amount of oil is 22.5 ounces, which corresponds to option B.
