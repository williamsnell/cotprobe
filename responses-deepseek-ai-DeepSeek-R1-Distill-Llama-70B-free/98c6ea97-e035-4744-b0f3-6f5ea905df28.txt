Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an electron being shot toward a metal plate with a certain surface charge density. The electron stops just as it reaches the plate, and I need to find how far from the plate the launch point is. Hmm.

So, the given data: the surface charge density is -2.0e-6 C/m². The initial kinetic energy of the electron is 1.60e-17 J. I think I need to find the distance from the plate where the electron starts, right?

Wait, I remember that when charges are involved, electric fields and potentials come into play. Since the plate has a surface charge, it creates an electric field. Oh, right, the electric field near a charged plate is sigma/(2 epsilon_0), but wait, wait. No, wait—no, for a non-conducting plate, the field would be sigma / (2 epsilon_0), but for a conducting plate, the field just outside is sigma / epsilon_0. Wait, wait, no, the plate is a conductor, so the charges are on the surface, and the field just outside is sigma over epsilon_0. But wait, wait. Oh, wait, no, for an infinite conducting plate with surface charge sigma, the electric field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0) because the field inside the conductor is zero. Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The electric field due to a charged conducting plate. So, for a single charged conducting plate, the field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0). Because, imagine the plate has surface charge density sigma. Then, the field just outside the plate (on one side) is sigma/(2 epsilon_0), and on the other side, it's the same because the plate is a conductor and the charges reside on the surfaces. Wait, no, no, wait—no, that's for two plates. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. For a single charged conducting plate, the electric field on either side would be sigma/(2 epsilon_0). Because, in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the field inside is zero. So the charges are on the surface, and each side contributes, so each side has sigma/2, and thus the field is sigma/(2 epsilon_0). Oh, right, so each surface has sigma/2, so each contributes sigma/(2 epsilon_0) in the same direction when outside. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, no, no, actually, no. The correct formula is that the electric field just outside a conductor is sigma/epsilon_0. No, that's for a conductor with a cavity or something else. Wait, no.

Wait, I think I need to get this straight. Let's think about a single infinite conducting plate with surface charge density sigma. Because it's a conductor, the charges are on the two surfaces. Wait, no, a single plate—wait, no, a single plate can't have two surfaces with charge. Oh wait, no, the plate has two surfaces, but in reality, for a single plate, the charge would reside on both surfaces—so each surface would have sigma/2, but wait that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the entire charge is on both surfaces, each with sigma/2. Hmm, I'm getting myself confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula again in my mind. Oh right, the electric field near a charged conducting plate is E = sigma / epsilon_0. Because when you have a charged conductor, the charges reside on the surface, and the field just outside is sigma over epsilon_0. But wait, that's for a plate where the charge is on both sides, but perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: The electric field produced by a charged non-conducting plate is sigma/(2 epsilon_0). But for a conducting plate, since the charges can move, the field inside the conductor is zero, so the field just outside is sigma/epsilon_0. Because the conductor has two surfaces—each with surface charge density sigma/2. So each surface contributes sigma/(2 epsilon_0), and since the fields from each surface add up on the outside, the total is sigma/(epsilon_0). Wait, that makes sense.

So in this problem, the plate is a conductor, so the electric field just outside the plate is E = sigma / epsilon_0.

But wait, wait the surface charge is negative, sigma is -2.0e-6 C/m². So the electric field would point away from the plate because the charge is negative. Wait, no, wait. No, the electric field points in the direction of the force on a positive test charge. So for a negative surface charge, the field would point towards the plate. Wait, no—wait, no, the field points away from positive charges and towards negative charges. So if the plate has a negative charge, the electric field just outside would be pointing towards the plate. So the direction is towards the plate.

But wait, the electron is being shot toward the plate. And the plate has a negative charge. So the electron, which is negatively charged, will experience a repulsive force, hence decelerating as it approaches the plate. So the electron is moving towards the plate but slowing down due to this repulsion. It stops just as it reaches the plate, so all its kinetic energy is lost in doing work against the electric field.

So the initial kinetic energy is converted into electric potential energy as it moves from its starting point to the plate. So the work done by the electric field is equal to the change in potential energy, which equals the initial kinetic energy.

Wait, but I think the work done by the electric field is equal to the negative change in potential energy. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The work done by the field is W = q * ΔV, where ΔV is the potential difference. Alternatively, the potential energy change ΔU is q * ΔV. The work done by the field is equal to the negative change in potential energy: W = -ΔU.

Wait, but in this case, the electron is moving against the electric field, so the field does negative work. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the change in potential energy is equal to the negative work done by the electric field. So ΔU = -W.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the potential difference between the starting point and the plate, then set that equal to the initial kinetic energy.

Wait, the initial kinetic energy is 1.6e-17 J. So the work done against the field is equal to this, which would be the potential energy gained.

Wait, but the electron starts with kinetic energy K, and ends with zero K, so all of it goes into potential energy. So ΔU = K.

But wait, the potential energy of a charge q in a potential V is U = qV. So the change in potential energy is q times the change in potential.

So let's model this: the electron is moving from point A (launch point) to point B (the plate). The potential at A is lower than at B because the electric field is pointing towards the plate (since sigma is negative). Wait, no. Let me think: the electric field points towards the plate. So as the electron moves from A to B, which is towards the plate, it's moving in the same direction as the electric field. So the potential decreases in the direction of the electric field. Thus, moving from A to B (towards the plate), the potential decreases. So the potential at B is lower than at A.

Wait, but the electron is moving into a region of higher potential? No, wait, wait. Let me think about the direction. The electric field E is towards the plate because the plate is negatively charged. So the potential increases as you move in the opposite direction of E. So as you move away from the plate (opposite to E), the potential increases.

So the potential at the plate is lower than at a point a distance d away. So when the electron moves from A (at distance d) to B (at the plate), it's moving to a region of lower potential. So the potential difference V_B - V_A is negative. So the electron's potential energy at B is U_B = q V_B, and at A is U_A = q V_A. The change in potential energy is U_B - U_A = q (V_B - V_A). So since V_B < V_A, ΔU is negative.

But wait, the electron's initial kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. So the change in potential energy is equal to the initial kinetic energy. So ΔU = K_initial.

Wait, but ΔU = U_final - U_initial, and since the electron stops at the plate, its kinetic energy is zero. So the initial kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. So:

ΔU = U_B - U_A = q (V_B - V_A) = K_initial.

But K_initial is positive, so U_B - U_A is positive. So q(V_B - V_A) = positive.

Wait, the charge of the electron is negative, so q is -e. So:

(-e)(V_B - V_A) = K_initial.

So rearranging, (V_B - V_A) = -K_initial / e.

Wait, but what's V_B and V_A? Let me think about the potential as a function of distance. The electric field E is uniform because it's produced by an infinite charged plate. So the potential difference between two points a distance d apart is V = E * d, but we have to consider the direction.

Wait, the electric field E is pointing towards the plate. So moving from A (distance d from plate) to B (at plate), the potential decreases. So V_B = V_A - E * d.

Wait, because when you move in the direction of the electric field, the potential decreases. So from A to B, moving a distance d in the direction of E, the potential drops by E*d.

So V_B = V_A - E * d.

So V_B - V_A = - E * d.

But from earlier, we have (V_B - V_A) = - K_initial / e.

So substituting:

- E * d = - K_initial / e.

Multiply both sides by -1:

E * d = K_initial / e.

So d = (K_initial) / (e * E).

Wait, that makes sense. So we can plug in the numbers.

First, let's compute E. E is sigma / epsilon_0. Sigma is given as -2.0e-6 C/m², but since E is a magnitude in this context, we'll take the absolute value.

E = |sigma| / epsilon_0 = (2.0e-6 C/m²) / (8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²)).

Let me compute that. 2e-6 / 8.85e-12 = approx 2e6 /8.85e-6? Wait, no, wait—wait, 2e-6 divided by 8.85e-12 is (2/8.85) * 1e6.

2 / 8.85 is approximately 0.226. So 0.226 * 1e6 = 2.26e5 N/C.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately.

E = 2.0e-6 / 8.85e-12 = (2 / 8.85) * (1e-6 / 1e-12) ) = (approx 0.226) * 1e6 = 2.26e5 N/C.

So E ≈ 2.26e5 N/C.

Now, the initial kinetic energy K_initial is 1.6e-17 J.

e is the elementary charge, 1.6e-19 C.

So d = (1.6e-17 J) / (e * E).

Plugging in the numbers:

d = (1.6e-17) / ( (1.6e-19 C) * (2.26e5 N/C) ) )

Let me compute the denominator first: 1.6e-19 * 2.26e5.

1.6e-19 * 2.26e5 = (1.6 * 2.26) * 1e(-19 +5) = 3.616 * 1e-14 = 3.616e-14.

So denominator is 3.616e-14 N·m/C (since N/C * C is N·m, which is J).

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s². Hmm, but perhaps better to think in terms of units.

Wait, but in the denominator, we have e*E, which has units of (C)*(N/C) ) = N. So 1.6e-19 * 2.26e5 has units N.

So the numerator is J, which is N·m. So d has units (N·m) / (N) )= m. Correct.

So d = (1.6e-17) / (3.616e-14) ) meters.

Compute that:

1.6e-17 / 3.616e-14 = (1.6 / 3.616) * 1e(-17 +14) ) = (0.4427) * 1e-3 meters.

0.4427e-3 meters is 0.4427 mm.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 0.44 mm. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.

Sigma = 2.0e-6 C/m² (I took absolute value).

E = sigma / epsilon_0 = 2e-6 / 8.85e-12 = let's compute more accurately.

2e-6 /8.85e-12 = (2 /8.85 ) * 1e6 ≈ 0.226 * 1e6 = 2.26e5 N/C. Correct.

Kinetic energy K =1.6e-17 J.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

d = K/(e * E) = (1.6e-17) / (1.6e-19 *2.26e5 )

1.6e-19 * 2.26e5 = 1.6 *2.26 = 3.616; exponents: 1e-19 *1e5=1e-14. So 3.616e-14.

So 1.6e-17 /3.616e-14 = (1.6 /3.616 ) * 1e(-17 +14) = (approx 0.4427) *1e-3 = 0.4427 mm. So yes, 0.44 mm is option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the electron as it moves toward the negatively charged metal plate. The electron starts with an initial kinetic energy of \( K_{\text{initial}} = 1.60 \times 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{J} \) and comes to rest just as it reaches the plate. This means all the initial kinetic energy is converted into electrostatic potential energy.

### Step 1: Electric Field Near the Plate
The plate has a surface charge density \( \sigma = -2.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \). For a large conducting plate, the electric field just outside the plate is given by:

\[
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}
\]

where \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)} \). Taking the magnitude of \( \sigma \):

\[
E = \frac{2.0 \times 10^{-6}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 2.26 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

### Step 2: Potential Difference and Distance
The work done by the electric field on the electron as it moves from the launch point (distance \( d \) from the plate) to the plate is equal to the initial kinetic energy. The potential difference \( \Delta V \) between the launch point and the plate is related to the electric field by:

\[
\Delta V = E \cdot d
\]

The change in potential energy \( \Delta U \) is related to the charge of the electron \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) and the potential difference:

\[
\Delta U = e \cdot \Delta V
\]

Since the initial kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, we have:

\[
K_{\text{initial}} = \Delta U = e \cdot E \cdot d
\]

Rearranging for \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{K_{\text{initial}}}{e \cdot E}
\]

### Step 3: Substituting Values
Substitute \( K_{\text{initial}} = 1.60 \times 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{J} \), \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \), and \( E = 2.26 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{N/C} \):

\[
d = \frac{1.60 \times 10^{-17}}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (2.26 \times 10^5)}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
(1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (2.26 \times 10^5) = 3.616 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Now divide:

\[
d = \frac{1.60 \times 10^{-17}}{3.616 \times 10^{-14}} \approx 0.4427 \, \mathrm{mm}
\]

### Final Answer
The distance from the plate to the launch point is approximately \( 0.44 \, \mathrm{mm} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
