Okay, so I've got this problem about a punch press with a spherical roller bearing, number 308. The mainshaft runs at 1600 rpm, and there are both radial and thrust loads acting on the bearing. I need to find the bearing life for two different reliability levels: 90% and 96%. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct pair of lives.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on bearing life calculations, but I remember that the basic formula is something like L10 life, which is the life that 90% of the bearings will exceed. But wait, the problem mentions 90% reliability, which would be the B10 life. Oh right, B10 is the life where 90% of the bearings survive, so that's what I need for part (a). And for part (b), it's 96% reliability, so maybe a different factor comes into play there.

Wait, the formula for bearing life is generally L = (C / P) ^ (p) * (10^6) / (N), where C is the dynamic load capacity, P is the equivalent load, and N is the speed in rpm. But I'm not exactly sure about the exponents and the factors for reliability. Oh right, the basic formula is for L10 life (90% reliability) and uses the exponent 3. For higher reliability, like 96%, I think the exponent changes, maybe to 4 or something else. Or wait, maybe it's a different formula entirely.

Wait, I think the general formula for bearing life considering reliability is L = (C / P) ^ (1/3) * (10^6) / (N) * (1 / (1 - R)^ (1/3)) ), where R is the reliability. Or perhaps it's a different approach. Maybe I should look up the exact formula steps because I might be mixing things up.

But wait, I can't look things up right now. Let me try to think it through. The basic L10 life formula is L10 = (C/P)^3 * 10^6 / (N). That's for 90% reliability. For higher reliability, like 96%, there's a factor called the life adjustment factor, maybe a^3 or something. Alternatively, some sources mention that for each percentage increase in reliability beyond 90%, the life decreases by a certain factor because you're accounting for more bearings failing earlier.

Wait, perhaps the life formula can be adjusted with a factor for reliability. So, for a B-life, where B is the reliability percentage, the formula is L = L10 * ( ( ln(1/(1 - B/100)) )^(1/3) )^-1. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The Weibull distribution is used for bearing life, and the B10 life is when 10% have failed. So the formula involves the Weibull slope, which for bearings is around 1.5 typically, but I'm not certain. Wait, I think the Weibull slope (beta) for bearings is often taken as 1.5, but maybe more like 1.3 or 1.1? Or is it higher, like 2.3? I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is to use the basic L10 formula and then apply a correction factor for the reliability. So for 90% reliability (B10 life), it's the standard L10. For higher reliability, say 96%, the life would be shorter because more bearings would have failed by that point. So the formula would have a multiplier based on the new reliability.

Let me think about the formula again. The general formula for the B-life is:

L = (C/P)^3 * (10^6 / N) * ( (ln(1/(1 - B/100))) )^(1/ (beta * 3)) )

Wait, I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, the adjusted life for a given reliability R can be found by L = L10 * ( (ln(1/(1 - R))) / ln(1/(1 - 0.90)) )^(1/(beta * 3)) )

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. First, find the equivalent load on the bearing. The bearing is under both radial and thrust loads. Spherical roller bearings can handle both radial and axial loads. The equivalent load, P, is calculated using the formula P = (F_r + F_a), but I think it's more involved than that. Oh wait, for bearings that can take combined loads, the equivalent load is given by P = F_r + (F_a * K), where K is a factor that depends on the bearing type. But I'm not sure about the exact value of K for spherical roller bearings.

Wait, another approach is to use the formula for combined loading in spherical roller bearings. The equivalent radial load is calculated as P = F_r + (F_a * (tan β)), where β is the angle. But I don't know the angle of the bearing. Alternatively, the equivalent load is given by P = sqrt( F_r^2 + (F_a * K)^2 ), where K is a factor. Or perhaps for spherical roller bearings, the equivalent load is simply F_r + F_a because they can handle both types of loads without a specific ratio.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to find another approach. Assume that the equivalent load P is calculated by combining the radial and thrust loads. So perhaps P = F_r + F_a. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, some sources say that for a spherical roller bearing, the axial load is converted into an equivalent radial load using a factor. For example, F_a is multiplied by a factor, say 0.4, and added to F_r. But without knowing the exact bearing's factor, I can't proceed accurately.

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the given data. The bearing is a no. 308. I think that refers to a specific size. Maybe I can look up the dynamic load capacity, C, for a 308 bearing. Wait, I don't have access to that data right now, but perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the equivalent load is the sum of the radial and thrust, or perhaps treating the thrust as a portion of it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given radial and thrust loads as the equivalent load. Maybe the equivalent load P is just the radial load, F_r, because the thrust load is axial and might not contribute as much to the bearing life. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the thrust load is negligible compared to the radial, but 1400 lbs is a significant portion of 2000 lbs. So probably, I should consider both.

Wait, another thought. The formula for equivalent load (P) when both radial and axial loads are present is P = sqrt( (F_r)^2 + (F_a * tan θ)^2 ), but without knowing the contact angle θ, I can't compute it. Since it's a spherical roller bearing, the contact angle is typically small, maybe around 10-20 degrees. So tan θ would be around 0.176 to 0.364. Let's assume an average of 0.2 for this example. Then F_a * tan θ would be 1400 * 0.2 = 280 lbs. Then P = sqrt( (2000)^2 + (280)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(4,000,000 + 78,400) = sqrt(4,078,400) ≈ 2019.4 lbs. So P ≈ 2020 lbs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the radial load, but that doesn't seem right because the thrust is a significant load. So maybe the equivalent load is higher than the radial load alone.

Assuming I have P ≈ 2020 lbs, but wait, let me double-check. If F_a is 1400 lbs, and F_r is 2000 lbs, then perhaps the equivalent load is calculated differently. For example, in some cases, axial loads are considered as a function of the bearing's ability to handle them, which is usually lower than radial capacity. So maybe the equivalent load is F_r + (F_a * factor), where the factor is less than 1. For example, if the factor is 0.4, then F_aequiv = 1400 * 0.4 = 560 lbs. Then P = 2000 + 560 = 2560 lbs.

Wait, but I'm not sure about this factor. Maybe I should proceed with P = F_r + F_a, but that would make P = 3400 lbs, which seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the equivalent load is only the radial load, but that doesn't account for the thrust.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the thrust load is negligible compared to the radial, so P = 2000 lbs. But the presence of 1400 lbs thrust might not be negligible, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the equivalent load is calculated using the formula P = (F_r + F_a) * (speed factor). But I'm getting stuck here. Since I don't have the exact method, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the equivalent load is the radial load plus a proportion of the thrust load. Let's say F_a is 1400 lbs, and the bearing can handle a certain ratio, maybe F_a_max = 0.5 * F_r_max. Wait, but I don't know the bearing's maximum axial load capacity.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to use the combined load as the sum, so P = 2000 + 1400 = 3400 lbs. Then, using that in the bearing life formula.

Assuming that, let's proceed. The L10 life is given by L10 = (C/P)^3 * (10^6 / N), where C is the dynamic load capacity. But I don't know the value of C for a 308 bearing. Wait, perhaps the 308 refers to the bearing's size, and I can find C from a table. But since I don't have that data, maybe I can proceed with the information given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given P in the formula, but I'm stuck because I don't know C. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the given options can help me figure out the correct approach.

Looking at the options, they are all in the range of hundreds of hours. For example, option D is 650 to 325, option A is 625.8 to 315.9, etc. So the L10 life would be the higher value, and the L96 life would be the lower one, since higher reliability requires more capacity, thus shorter life.

Wait, no. Actually, higher reliability means that more bearings would survive beyond that life. So for a higher reliability, say 96%, the required life would be shorter because you're allowing fewer failures. So the L96 life would be lower than L10 life. So part (a) is 90% reliability (L10), part (b) is 96% (Lx), and the Lx would be shorter than L10.

Wait, no, that's not right. The L-life is the life at which a certain percentage of bearings have failed. So for 90% reliability, it's the life where 10% have failed (B10). For 96%, it's where 4% have failed (B4). So the B4 life would be longer than the B10 life because it's the life at which fewer bearings have failed. Wait, no, that's opposite. Let me think clearly: If 90% of bearings survive beyond B10, and 96% survive beyond B4, then B4 is a longer life than B10. Because for B4, 4% have failed, so 96% are still running. So the B4 life is longer than B10 life. Wait, that can't be right because higher reliability implies the life is shorter. Wait, no, because B-life is the point where a certain percentage have failed. So for higher reliability, you're looking for the point where fewer have failed, which would correspond to a longer life. So, for example, B10 is the life where 10% have failed, so 90% have survived. B4 is where 4% have failed, so 96% have survived. That would mean that the B4 life is longer than the B10 life because it takes longer for 4% to fail than for 10% to fail.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think with an example. Suppose a group of bearings: 

- After 1000 hours, 10% have failed (B10=1000 hours).
- After 2000 hours, 4% have failed (B4=2000 hours).

This would mean that at 1000 hours, 10% failed, so 90% are still running. At 2000 hours, 4% have failed, so 96% are running. So yes, B4 is longer than B10. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the test ran longer, more bearings would have failed. So perhaps I have it backwards.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again: If B10 is 1000 hours, that means that after 1000 hours, 10% have failed. For B4, it would take longer because fewer bearings have failed. So B4 would be higher than B10. So for higher reliability (96%), the life is longer, which means the B4 life is longer than B10. But that's not how the options are presented. The options have the first number higher than the second, implying that part (a) is higher and part (b) is lower. So perhaps I have this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says: evaluate (a) bearing life for 90% reliability and (b) bearing life for 96% reliability. So 90% reliability would be the B10 life, and 96% would be the B4 life. Since B4 life is longer than B10, the answer should have part (a) as a lower value and part (b) as a higher value? But looking at the options, they all have (a) higher than (b). So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I have the reliability definition mixed up. Maybe the 90% reliability refers to 90% of the bearings surviving, which would correspond to B10 life because 10% have failed. So the B10 life is the point where 90% survive. Similarly, 96% reliability would correspond to B4 life, which is the point where 4% have failed, so 96% survive. So B4 life is longer than B10, meaning that the answer for part (b) should be higher than part (a). But looking at the options, all have (a) higher than (b), so I must have misunderstood.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum life for each reliability level, so for 96% reliability, the life is shorter because it's a higher requirement on the bearing. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses a different exponent based on reliability, so for higher reliability, the exponent increases, thus reducing the life. For example, L10 uses an exponent of 3, while higher reliability uses a higher exponent, like 4 or 5, which would reduce the life.

Wait, I remember that the formula for bearing life when considering reliability is L = (C/P)^(1/3) * (10^6 / N) * (1 / (1 - R)^ (1/e)), where e is the Weibull slope. Oh wait, but I thought the Weibull slope for bearings is typically around 1.5 to 2.3. Let me think again. The Weibull distribution is used to model bearing life, and the B-life is given by L = L10 * ( (ln(1/(1 - B/100)) ) / ln(1/(1 - 0.90)) )^(1/(beta)), where beta is the Weibull slope. If beta is 1.5, then the exponent would be 1/1.5 = 2/3. So the formula would be L_B = L10 * ( (ln(1/(1 - B/100)) ) / ln(1/(1 - 0.90)) )^(2/3) ). 

Wait, let me compute this. For 90% reliability (B=90), the B10 life is L10. For 96% reliability, B=96, so L_B96 = L10 * ( (ln(1/(1 - 0.96)) ) / ln(1/(1 - 0.90)) )^(2/3) )

Calculating the terms inside:

ln(1/(1-0.96)) = ln(1/0.04) = ln(25) ≈ 3.2189

ln(1/(1-0.90)) = ln(1/0.10) ≈ 2.3026

So the ratio is 3.2189 / 2.3026 ≈ 1.398

Now, raising this to the power of 2/3: (1.398)^(2/3) ≈ e^( (2/3) * ln(1.398) )

ln(1.398) ≈ 0.334

So (2/3)*0.334 ≈ 0.223

e^0.223 ≈ 1.249

So L_B96 = L10 * 1.249

Wait, but this would mean that the life for 96% reliability is longer than L10, which contradicts the options where part (b) is lower than part (a). So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is inverted. If higher reliability requires a higher survival rate, then the life would be longer, but the options don't reflect that. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this problem using the basic L10 formula first. Let's assume that the equivalent load P is the radial load plus a portion of the axial load. Let's say the equivalent load P is calculated as P = F_r + (F_a * K), where K is a factor. But without knowing K, I can't proceed accurately. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the equivalent load is only the radial load, F_r = 2000 lbs.

So, using P = 2000 lbs.

The formula for L10 is L10 = (C/P)^3 * (10^6 / N) hours.

But I don't know C, the dynamic load capacity for the 308 bearing. Maybe I can look up the C value for a 308 bearing. I think a 308 bearing is a spherical roller bearing with a certain bore size. From memory, I think the dynamic load capacity C for a 308 bearing is around 31,000 lbs. Wait, that's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the given options.

If C is 31,000 lbs, then P is 2000 lbs.

Then, (C/P)^3 = (31,000
