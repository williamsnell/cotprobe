Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about greedy algorithms and which problems they can solve. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each point step by step.

The question is asking which of the problems I, II, III can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm. Let's break down each problem.

Problem I: Finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights. I remember that Krusky's algorithm and Prim's algorithm are used for this. Krusky's is definitely a greedy approach because it sorts all edges and picks the smallest one that doesn't form a cycle. Prim's might be a bit different, but I think it's also considered greedy because it builds the MST by adding the least-weight edge that connects a new vertex. So I think problem I can be solved with a greedy algorithm.

Problem II: Finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph. Wait, maximum clique is the largest complete subgraph. From what I remember, finding a maximum clique is an NP-hard problem. Greedy algorithms don't handle NP-hard problems efficiently because they can get stuck in local optima. So I don't think a standard greedy approach works here. Maybe some heuristic greedy methods can find approximate solutions, but the question is about solving the problem, which I think refers to the exact solution. So II can't be solved by a standard greedy.

Problem III: Finding a maximum flow from a source to sink in a directed graph with positive capacities. The standard approach here is the Ford-Fulkerson method, which uses a greedy approach by finding augmenting paths one by one. Or wait, isn't the Edmonds-Karp algorithm part of this, which is a specific implementation using BFS for shortest paths? Anyway, maximum flow problems are solved using algorithms that can be considered greedy because they iteratively find augmenting paths and increase flow until no more can be done. So III can be solved with a greedy algorithm.

So to recap:

I: Yes
II: No
III: Yes

So looking at the options, I need to find which options include I and III but not II. Looking at the choices:

Option J says I and III only. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. For problem III, is the algorithm always greedy? Because I remember that while the Ford-Fulkerson is a framework, some implementations like using BFS (Edmonds-Karp) are more efficient, but the choice of augmenting path can vary. But regardless, the overall approach is still based on a greedy strategy of increasing flow incrementally. So yes, problem III is solvable with a greedy algorithm.

So the correct answer should be J: I and III only.

To determine which problems can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm, let's analyze each one:

1. **Finding a minimum spanning tree (MST)**: This can be solved using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm, both of which are greedy. Kruskal's sorts edges and adds them one by one, avoiding cycles, while Prim's builds the MST by adding the smallest-weight edge connecting a new vertex. Thus, Problem I can be solved with a greedy algorithm.

2. **Finding a maximum clique**: This is an NP-hard problem, meaning it cannot be solved efficiently by a standard greedy algorithm. While heuristic greedy methods may provide approximate solutions, the question refers to solving the problem exactly. Therefore, Problem II cannot be solved by a standard greedy algorithm.

3. **Finding a maximum flow**: This problem can be solved using the Ford-Fulkerson method, which is a greedy approach. It iteratively finds augmenting paths to increase the flow until no more improvements can be made. The Edmonds-Karp algorithm, a specific implementation of Ford-Fulkerson, also uses a greedy strategy. Thus, Problem III can be solved with a greedy algorithm.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **J: I and III only**.
