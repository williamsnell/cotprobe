Alright, so I've got this math problem here about finding the range of the function f(x) = 1/(1 - x). Hmm, okay, I remember that the range is all the possible y-values that the function can take. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I think I should probably express the function in terms of y and then solve for x. So, let me set y equal to 1/(1 - x). That gives me the equation y = 1/(1 - x). Now, I need to solve this equation for x in terms of y to see what possible y-values are allowed.

Starting with y = 1/(1 - x), I can multiply both sides by (1 - x) to get rid of the denominator. That would give me y*(1 - x) = 1. Expanding the left side, I get y - yx = 1. Now, I want to solve for x, so I'll move the yx term to the other side. That leaves me with y = 1 + yx.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. Oh, wait, I should subtract yx from both sides to isolate the terms with x. So, y = 1 + yx? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me try again.

Starting over: y = 1/(1 - x). Multiply both sides by (1 - x), so y*(1 - x) = 1. Distribute y: y - yx = 1. Now, I want to get all terms involving x on one side. So, let's subtract y from both sides: -yx = 1 - y. Then, multiply both sides by -1 to make it positive: yx = y - 1.

Now, solve for x by dividing both sides by y: x = (y - 1)/y. Hmm, but wait, this leads to x being expressed in terms of y. However, the function f(x) is defined for all x except when the denominator is zero. So, 1 - x can't be zero. That means x can't be 1. So, the domain of f is all real numbers except x = 1.

But I'm looking for the range, which is the possible y values. So, from x = (y - 1)/y, I can see that y can't be zero because if y were zero, the denominator in x's expression would be zero, which is undefined. So y can't be zero. That suggests that y can be any real number except zero.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because when I solve for x, I have to make sure that x is a real number. So, for any y except y=0, there's a corresponding x. So, the range of f(x) is all real numbers except y = 0.

But let me double-check this. Let's pick a value for y and see if there's an x that gives it. Suppose y = 2. Then, from x = (2 - 1)/2 = 1/2. So f(1/2) = 1/(1 - 1/2) = 1/(1/2) = 2. That works. What about y = -1? Then x = (-1 - 1)/(-1) = (-2)/(-1) = 2. So f(2) = 1/(1 - 2) = 1/(-1) = -1. That works too.

What about y approaching infinity? If y is a very large positive number, x approaches (y)/(y) = 1 from below. So as x approaches 1 from the left, 1 - x approaches 0 from the positive side, so 1/(1 -x) approaches positive infinity. Similarly, if y is a very large negative number, then x approaches (y)/y = 1 from above, so 1 - x approaches 0 from the negative side, making 1/(1 -x) approach negative infinity.

Wait, but what about y = 0? If I set y = 0, then from x = (0 - 1)/0, which is (-1)/0, which is undefined. So y can't be zero because there's no x that makes f(x) = 0. So the range is all real numbers except zero.

Looking back at the options, option F is (-infty, 0) union (0, infty), which matches this conclusion. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but let me think again. When I solved for x, I got x = (y - 1)/y = 1 - 1/y. So as long as y is not zero, x is defined. So y can be any real except zero, so the range is all real numbers except zero. So in interval notation, that's (-infty, 0) U (0, infty).

Looking at the options, option F is exactly that: (-infty,0) U (0,infty). So that should be the correct choice.

To determine the range of the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x} \), we start by expressing the function in terms of \( y \):  
\[
y = \frac{1}{1-x}.
\]  
Next, solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \):  
\[
y(1-x) = 1 \implies y - yx = 1 \implies -yx = 1 - y \implies x = \frac{y-1}{y}.
\]  
This expression for \( x \) is valid as long as \( y \neq 0 \), because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, \( y = 0 \) is not allowed.  

To confirm, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \):  
- As \( x \to 1 \), \( 1-x \to 0 \), and \( f(x) \to \pm\infty \), depending on whether \( x \) approaches 1 from below or above.  
- For all other \( x \), \( f(x) \) produces real values except \( y = 0 \), as shown above.  

Thus, the range of \( f(x) \) is all real numbers except \( y = 0 \), which in interval notation is:  
\[
(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty).
\]  

The correct answer is **F**.
