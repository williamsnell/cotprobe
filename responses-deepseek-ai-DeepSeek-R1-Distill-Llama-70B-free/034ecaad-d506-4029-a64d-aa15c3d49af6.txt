Okay, so I've got this problem here about ACEPLUS SALES COMPANY wanting to pay their employees a bonus based on labor-cost savings. Hmm, I need to figure out two things: the total bonus amount for the employees and what percentage of their wages that bonus represents. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. So, the company has decided that 70% of the labor-cost savings will go to the employees as a bonus, and the employer keeps 30%. That means if there's a certain amount saved in labor costs, 70% of that is the bonus pool.

The quarterly data they gave is: Total Sales of $100,000 and Total Labor cost of $32,000. Oh wait, and the standard total cost of labor is 40% of the adjusted sales price. Hmm, so I think that means normally, labor costs are expected to be 40% of sales. But in this quarter, their actual labor cost was $32,000. So I guess we need to find out what the labor cost should have been according to the standard, and then see the difference—that's the savings.

Wait, let me think. The standard is 40% of adjusted sales. So the adjusted sales would be the same as total sales, I assume, unless there's something else adjusting them. The problem doesn't mention any adjustments, so I'll take total sales as $100,000.

So the standard labor cost should be 40% of $100,000. Let me calculate that. 40% of 100,000 is 0.4 * 100,000 = $40,000. But wait, the actual labor cost was only $32,000. Oh, so they saved money because their actual cost was lower than the standard. So the labor-cost savings would be the difference between standard and actual.

So savings = standard cost - actual cost. That's $40,000 - $32,000 = $8,000. So the company saved $8,000 in labor costs this quarter.

Now, of this $8,000, 70% goes to the employees as a bonus. Let me calculate 70% of 8,000. 0.7 * 8000 = $5,600. So that's the total bonus amount to be paid to the employees. So part (i) of the question is $5,600.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem says the employer retains 30%, so 30% of 8,000 is 2,400, and 70% is 5,600. Yeah, that looks right.

Now, part (ii) asks what percentage of wages earned in the quarter the workers will receive as a bonus. So the bonus is $5,600, and their total wages are the actual labor cost, which is $32,000. So the percentage would be (5,600 / 32,000) * 100%.

Let me compute that. 5,600 divided by 32,000. Let's see, 32,000 divided by 5,600 is 5.714... Wait, actually, let me compute 5,600 / 32,000. That's 5600 ÷ 32000. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 100: 56 / 320. Simplify that. 56 ÷ 56 is 1, 320 ÷56 is approximately 5.714. So 1/5.714 is approximately 0.175, which is 17.5%.

Wait, that's 17.5%. So the bonus is 17.5% of their wages. Let me check the options. Looking at option E: $5,600 and 17.5%. Yep, that's what I got.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. So standard labor is 40% of sales, which is 40k. Actual is 32k, so savings is 8k. 70% of 8k is 5.6k. Then, 5.6k divided by 32k is 0.175, which is 17.5%. So yes, E seems correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is $5,600 and 17.5%, which matches my calculations. So I think that's the right answer.

The problem involves calculating the bonus to be paid to employees based on labor-cost savings and determining what percentage of their wages this bonus represents.

1. **Labor-Cost Savings Calculation**:  
   - The standard labor cost is 40% of total sales. With total sales of $100,000, the standard labor cost is:  
     \[
     0.4 \times 100,000 = \$40,000
     \]  
   - The actual labor cost for the quarter is $32,000. Therefore, the labor-cost savings are:  
     \[
     \$40,000 - \$32,000 = \$8,000
     \]

2. **Bonus Amount for Employees**:  
   - 70% of the labor-cost savings is distributed to the employees as a bonus:  
     \[
     0.7 \times \$8,000 = \$5,600
     \]

3. **Percentage of Wages Earned as Bonus**:  
   - The bonus of $5,600 is calculated as a percentage of the actual labor cost ($32,000):  
     \[
     \frac{\$5,600}{\$32,000} \times 100\% = 17.5\%
     \]

Thus, the total bonus amount is $5,600, and the bonus represents 17.5% of the employees' wages. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: $5,600 and 17.5%**
