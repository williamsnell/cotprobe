Okay, so I have this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a group of patients with injuries. It says that 28% visit both a physical therapist and a chiropractor, and 8% visit neither. Then, it mentions that the probability of visiting a physical therapist exceeds that of visiting a chiropractor by 16%. I need to find the probability of a randomly selected person visiting a physical therapist.

Hmm, let's break this down. Let me assign some variables to make it clearer.

Let me denote:
- P(PT) as the probability of visiting a physical therapist.
- P(C) as the probability of visiting a chiropractor.
- P(PT ∩ C) is given as 28%, so 0.28.
- P(neither) is 8%, so 0.08.

The problem also states that P(PT) exceeds P(C) by 16%, so P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16.

I remember from probability that the formula for the probability of A or B happening is P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). So in this case, the probability of visiting either a physical therapist or a chiropractor (or both) would be P(PT) + P(C) - P(PT ∩ C).

But wait, also, the probability of visiting neither is 8%, which means the probability of visiting at least one of them is 1 - 0.08 = 0.92, or 92%.

So putting it all together, P(PT ∪ C) = 0.92.

Substituting the formula:
P(PT) + P(C) - P(PT ∩ C) = 0.92.

We know P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16, and P(PT ∩ C) = 0.28.

Let me substitute P(PT) in the equation. So:

(P(C) + 0.16) + P(C) - 0.28 = 0.92.

Combining like terms:

2 * P(C) + 0.16 - 0.28 = 0.92.

Calculating 0.16 - 0.28 gives me -0.12. So:

2 * P(C) - 0.12 = 0.92.

Adding 0.12 to both sides:

2 * P(C) = 1.04.

Divide both sides by 2:

P(C) = 0.52.

So the probability of visiting a chiropractor is 52%. Then, since P(PT) is 16% higher than P(C), I add 0.16 to 0.52.

Wait, wait, no. Wait a second. Because P(PT) exceeds P(C) by 16 percentage points, right? Or is it 16% of P(C)? Hmm, the wording says "exceeds by 16%", which can be ambiguous. Oh, but in probability terms, percentages can be tricky. Let me think.

If it's 16 percentage points, then yes, P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16. But if it's 16% more than P(C), then it would be P(PT) = P(C) * 1.16. The question says "exceeds by 16%", which usually refers to percentage points. But sometimes, people use percentage in a relative sense. Hmm, wait, let's re-examine the exact wording.

The question says, "the probability of visiting a physical therapist exceeds the probability of visiting a chiropractor by 16%." The phrasing "exceeds by 16%" could be a bit ambiguous. For example, does it mean 16 percentage points, or 16% of P(C)?

Wait, alternative approach: Let me consider both interpretations and see which gives a valid answer.

First, as I did before, assuming it's 16 percentage points.

So P(PT) = 0.52 + 0.16 = 0.68. So that would be 68%.

Let me see if that makes sense with the total. So P(PT) is 0.68, P(C) is 0.52.

Then P(PT ∪ C) = 0.68 + 0.52 - 0.28 = 0.92, which matches our earlier result. Because 0.68 + 0.52 is 1.20, minus 0.28 is 0.92. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if P(PT) is 16% higher than P(C), meaning P(PT) = P(C) * 1.16. Let's see if that approach works.

So let me set P(PT) = 1.16 * P(C).

Plug into the equation:

1.16 * P(C) + P(C) - 0.28 = 0.92.

So (2.16 * P(C)) - 0.28 = 0.92.

2.16 * P(C) = 1.20.

P(C) = 1.20 / 2.16 ≈ 0.5555... or 55.555...%.

Then P(PT) = 1.16 * 0.5555 ≈ 0.6444, or 64.44%.

Check P(PT ∪ C) = 0.6444 + 0.5555 - 0.28 = 0.9199, which is about 0.92. So that seems to work too.

Wait, but now I'm confused because there are two different possible interpretations leading to different answers. So how do I know which one is correct?

Looking back at the question's wording: "the probability of visiting a physical therapist exceeds the probability of visiting a chiropractor by 16%." The phrase "exceeds by" can be ambiguous. However, in probability questions, when it's about one probability exceeding another by a percentage, it's more commonly referring to percentage points rather than a relative percentage. Because if it were a relative increase, it would typically say "is 16% higher than" or "is 1.16 times." But the wording here is "exceeds by" which usually refers to the absolute difference.

So I think the first approach is correct: P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16, leading to P(PT) = 0.68, which is 68%, option J.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option J is 0.68, yes.

But wait another thought: Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Going back:

Using the first approach:

P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16.

Then, P(PT ∪ C) = P(PT) + P(C) - P(PT ∩ C) = (P(C)+0.16) + P(C) - 0.28 = 2 P(C) - 0.12 = 0.92.

So 2 P(C) = 1.04 → P(C) = 0.52 → P(PT) = 0.68.

Yes, that's correct. And that gives us 0.68.

So the answer should be J: 0.68.

To solve the problem, we start by defining the probabilities:

- Let \( P(PT) \) be the probability of visiting a physical therapist.
- Let \( P(C) \) be the probability of visiting a chiropractor.
- \( P(PT \cap C) = 0.28 \) (probability of visiting both).
- \( P(\text{neither}) = 0.08 \), so \( P(PT \cup C) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92 \) (probability of visiting at least one).

The problem states that \( P(PT) \) exceeds \( P(C) \) by 16%. This is interpreted as an absolute difference of 16 percentage points, so \( P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16 \).

Using the formula for the union of two events:

\[
P(PT \cup C) = P(PT) + P(C) - P(PT \cap C)
\]

Substituting \( P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16 \) and \( P(PT \cap C) = 0.28 \):

\[
0.92 = (P(C) + 0.16) + P(C) - 0.28
\]

Simplify:

\[
0.92 = 2P(C) - 0.12
\]

Add 0.12 to both sides:

\[
2P(C) = 1.04
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
P(C) = 0.52
\]

Now, substitute \( P(C) = 0.52 \) into \( P(PT) = P(C) + 0.16 \):

\[
P(PT) = 0.52 + 0.16 = 0.68
\]

Thus, the probability of a randomly selected person visiting a physical therapist is \( 0.68 \).
