Question:

A widow owned an apartment building. Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that

Options:

A: the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years.
B: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
C: the student had made improvements to the property, thus extending the leasehold.
D: the student had a verbal agreement with the widow to extend the lease.
E: the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.
F: the widow had accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended.
G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student.
H: the widow had not clearly communicated the end of the lease term.
I: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
J: the leasehold contract was void ab initio.

Okay, so I've got this question about landlord-tenant law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's a widow who owns an apartment building. A student signed a three-year lease with her, agreeing to pay $800 monthly. The three years have passed, but the student is still paying rent, and the widow is still accepting it. Now, the widow wants to evict the student immediately after the three-year period, before she accepts the next rent check. The question is, what's the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if his claim is true?

Hmm. So I remember that when a lease ends, if the tenant stays and the landlord accepts rent, it can create a new tenancy. I think after a fixed-term lease ends, if both parties continue as before, it usually becomes a month-to-month tenancy, which is a periodic tenancy. But I'm not entirely sure.

So the lease was for three years, and it's expired. The student continued to pay, and the widow accepted. So at the end of the three years, they didn't sign a new lease, but the payments kept coming. So the tenancy continues, but what type?

I think in most places, when a lease ends and the tenant stays with the landlord's consent, it becomes a periodic tenancy. The period is usually the same as the rent payment period. Since the rent is monthly, it's month-to-month.

Now, if the widow wants to evict, she needs to give proper notice. For a periodic tenancy, the notice required is typically one full period. So for month-to-month, it's usually one month's notice. If she didn't give that notice, the eviction might not hold.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years. I don't think that's right. The lease was three years, but that doesn't give a right beyond that unless there's a renewal.

Option B: Widow didn't give requisite notice for terminating a term of years. Wait, the term ended, so she doesn't need to terminate it; it's already over. So this might not apply. The issue is after the term ended, the tenancy continued as periodic.

Option C: Improvements extending the lease. No, I don't think improvements would extend a lease term; maybe that's about other issues like fixtures.

Option D: Verbal agreement to extend. If that's the case, then there's a new lease, but the question says the student's strongest argument if true. But the question doesn't mention any verbal agreement, so maybe it's not the best option unless D is considered, but the fact pattern doesn't state that. So perhaps not the best.

Option E: Lease terms binding. But the lease ended, so the terms wouldn't bind beyond the three years unless it was extended.

Option F: Widow accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended. Wait, if she accepted rent after the lease ended, that could create a new periodic tenancy. But the scenario says she's trying to evict immediately upon the end, before accepting the next rent check. So maybe F isn't applicable here because she hasn't accepted the next rent yet. So F might not be the case here.

Option G: Student status protects. I don't think being a student gives any special protection against eviction in general.

Option H: Widow didn't clearly communicate end of lease. Not sure about this. Maybe if the lease ended and she didn't tell him, but if he knew the term was up, maybe that's not the issue.

Option I: Widow didn't give notice for terminating a periodic tenancy. Oh, this seems relevant. Because after the lease ended, it became a periodic tenancy, so to terminate that, she needs to give proper notice, like one month's notice. If she didn't, then the eviction could be stopped.

Option J: Lease void ab initio. That would mean the lease was invalid from the start, but that's not relevant here because the student did live there and pay rent.

So the strongest argument would be that the widow didn't give the required notice for ending a periodic tenancy. So the answer should be I.

The question revolves around landlord-tenant law, specifically addressing what happens when a fixed-term lease ends, and the tenant continues to pay rent while the landlord accepts it. In this scenario, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction would hinge on the type of tenancy that arises after the fixed-term lease expires.

When the three-year lease ended, and both parties continued the arrangement without signing a new lease, the tenancy likely converted into a periodic tenancy. For a month-to-month tenancy, the landlord is required to provide proper notice (typically one month's notice) to terminate the agreement. If the widow failed to provide this notice, the eviction could be challenged on the grounds that the periodic tenancy was not properly terminated.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: The student's right to stay based on residing there for over three years is irrelevant, as the lease term had already expired.
- **B**: The widow does not need to give notice for terminating a term of years, as the lease term had already ended.
- **C**: Improvements to the property do not extend the lease term.
- **D**: A verbal agreement to extend the lease is not mentioned in the fact pattern, making it less relevant.
- **E**: The lease terms no longer bind after the three-year term ended.
- **F**: The widow had not yet accepted rent for the next period, so this is not applicable.
- **G**: The student's status as a student does not provide special protection.
- **H**: The lack of communication about the lease ending is not the central issue.
- **I**: This is the strongest argument, as the widow would need to provide proper notice to terminate a periodic tenancy.
- **J**: The lease being void ab initio is not relevant, as the student did occupy the property.

The correct answer is that the widow failed to provide the requisite notice for terminating a periodic tenancy.

**Answer: I**
