Okay, so I have this question about Mr. Hendricks borrowing money for his home, and I need to figure out how much interest he pays every six months. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says he borrowed $5,000 with a fixed mortgage at 5% yearly interest. He's paying in semiannual installments, so that's every six months, and the mortgage will be due in twenty years. The question is asking how much interest is due every six months.

Hmm, wait a minute. I'm a bit confused about whether the interest is simple or compound. Well, since it's a fixed mortgage, I think it's usually compound interest, but the way the question is phrased might mean they just want the simple calculation each period.

Wait, the interest is 5% yearly, but payments are made every six months. So maybe each payment includes half of the annual interest. Let me think about that.

So, the annual interest would be 5% of $5,000. Let me calculate that: 5% of 5000 is 0.05 * 5000 = $250 per year. Since he's paying semiannually, that's two payments a year. So each payment should cover half of the annual interest, which would be $250 / 2 = $125. So each six months, he pays $125 in interest.

Wait, but wait. Because it's a mortgage, the payments are usually made up of both principal and interest. But the question specifically asks for how much interest is due every six months. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, if the mortgage is being amortized over twenty years, each payment would include both principal and interest. But the question might just be asking for the interest portion each period, not the total payment. So perhaps it's just the simple interest each period.

So the annual interest is $250, so each semiannual payment would have $125 in interest. But wait, that doesn't seem right because as the principal decreases, the interest each period would decrease. Oh wait, but the question is about the interest due every six months, and at the beginning, the interest would be higher, but as the mortgage progresses, it would lower. Wait, but the question is asking for the amount due each time, not the total over the life.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the interest due every six months. So perhaps it's just each period's interest, which would be 5% annual rate divided by 2, so 2.5% each six months on the outstanding principal. But wait, the outstanding principal changes each period because part of the payment goes to principal.

Wait, but the question is about how much interest is due every six months. So at the beginning, the first payment would have the highest interest, and then it would decrease each time. But the question doesn't specify which payment it's asking about. It's just asking generally, so maybe the initial interest payment.

Wait, but the problem might be looking for the interest portion of each payment, which is calculated based on the current outstanding balance. However, since the payments are split between principal and interest, each payment's interest would decrease over time. But the question doesn't specify a particular period, so perhaps it's just the first payment's interest.

Alternatively, the question might be considering the interest as simple interest each period, without considering the amortization. So each six months, the interest would be 5% / 2 = 2.5% of the principal. So 2.5% of $5,000 is 0.025 * 5000 = $125. So each six months, $125 in interest.

Looking at the options, option I is $125. But wait, another approach: the monthly interest rate would be 5% divided by 2, which is 2.5% per six months. So 2.5% of 5000 is indeed $125.

Alternatively, if they were using compound interest, but since the payments are made every six months, maybe it's better to think in terms of simple interest for each period. So each payment's interest is $125, so the correct answer would be I: $125.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, it says it's a fixed mortgage. So maybe the interest is fixed, meaning each payment has the same amount of interest. That doesn't make sense because usually, fixed-rate mortgages have fixed payments that include both principal and interest, but the interest portion decreases each period.

Wait, but the question is not about the total payment, just the interest part each time. So if each payment has a fixed interest amount, that would only be the case if it's simple interest without amortization. But that's not typical. More likely, the interest is calculated each period based on the remaining principal.

But wait, maybe the problem is treating it as simple interest, so each period's interest is 2.5% of the initial principal. So 2.5% of 5000 is $125, so each six months, $125 in interest. So the answer is I: $125.

But I'm a bit confused because normally, in an amortizing loan, each payment's interest is based on the remaining principal, which decreases over time. So the first payment's interest would be higher, and subsequent ones lower. But the question isn't specifying a particular period, so perhaps it's just asking for the initial interest payment.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each payment's interest is 5% divided by 2, so 2.5%, applied to the initial principal each time, which would give $125 each time. But that's not how mortgages typically work because the principal is being paid down.

Wait, but the question is about a fixed mortgage. Fixed in what way? The payment is fixed, so maybe each payment is the same amount, but the split between principal and interest changes. So the interest part would decrease each period, but the total payment remains the same.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking how much interest is due every six months. So perhaps it's the interest portion of each payment, which varies each period. But without knowing the specific period, like first payment or last, I can't compute that.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any options for varying amounts, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's just 5% annual interest, so each six months, it's 2.5% of 5000, which is $125. So the answer is I: $125.

The problem involves Mr. Hendricks borrowing $5,000 at a fixed annual interest rate of 5%, with payments made semiannually over twenty years. The question asks how much interest is due every six months.

To calculate the interest due every six months, we start by determining the annual interest:

\[
\text{Annual Interest} = 5\% \times \$5,000 = 0.05 \times 5000 = \$250.
\]

Since payments are made semiannually, the annual interest is split into two equal parts:

\[
\text{Semiannual Interest} = \frac{\$250}{2} = \$125.
\]

Thus, the interest due every six months is \$125. This assumes that the interest is calculated based on the initial principal and does not account for the reduction in principal over time, as the question does not specify a particular payment period or amortization details.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: \$125**
