Okay, let's see. I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. So, Sanjay watched some TV shows and a movie last weekend. I need to find out the total time he spent watching TV.

Alright, the problem says he watched 3 television shows, each 30 minutes long. Hmm, so each show is half an hour. To find the total time for the shows, I should multiply the number of shows by the length of each. So that's 3 times 30. Let me do that calculation: 3 * 30 equals 90. Oh wait, no, that's right because 3 times 30 is 90 minutes. So the shows add up to 90 minutes total.

Then, he also watched a movie that was 90 minutes long. So that's straightforward— the movie is 90 minutes. Now, I need to add that to the time from the TV shows to get the total time he spent watching TV.

So adding the two together: 90 minutes from the shows plus 90 minutes from the movie. That would be 90 + 90, which equals 180 minutes. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. 3 shows at 30 each: 3*30=90. Movie is 90. So 90+90=180. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options provided, I need to find which one corresponds to 180 minutes. Let me glance through the options. Option D is 180, so that must be the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculations seem simple. Each show is 30 minutes, three shows so 90. Movie is 90. Total is 180. So yeah, the answer should be D.

The total time Sanjay spent watching television is calculated by adding the time spent on the TV shows and the movie. He watched 3 shows, each 30 minutes long, which totals 3 × 30 = 90 minutes. Additionally, he watched a 90-minute movie. Adding these together: 90 + 90 = 180 minutes. The correct answer is D: 180.
