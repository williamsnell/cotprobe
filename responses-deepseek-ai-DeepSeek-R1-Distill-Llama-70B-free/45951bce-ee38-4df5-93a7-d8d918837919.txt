Okay, so I need to figure out Jerry Kohen's federal income tax. Let's see what information I have here.

Jerry's annual income is $8,975. He's married and filing a joint return with his wife, and they have two dependent children. So that probably means they're claiming four exemptions in total—each person is an exemption, so two for him and his wife, and two for the kids. Wait, actually, two dependent children would add two more, making four in total. So that's why the table mentions "four exemptions".

Looking at the tax table provided, it's organized by adjusted gross income ranges. The columns show different filing statuses: single, not head of household, and married filing jointly. Since Jerry is married and filing jointly, I should focus on the "Married, filing joint return" column.

The table lists ranges from $4,950 up to $9,950 and beyond. Each range has a corresponding tax amount. I need to find where Jerry's $8,975 fits into this.

Let me scan the table. The first row is for income between $4,950 and $5,000, which is probably too low. Next, $5,950 to $6,000—still lower than $8k. Then $6,950 to $7,000, $7,950 to $8,000, and $8,950 to $9,000. Oh wait, Jerry's income is $8,975, which is between $8,950 and $9,000. So according to the table, the tax for that bracket for a married joint filer is $739.

Wait, let me double-check. The row for $8,950 to $9,000 shows $822 for single and $739 for married. So yes, Jerry's in that range.

Now, the options given are A through J. Looking for $739 in the options. Let me check:

Option D is $739. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that sometimes the standard deduction and exemptions might affect the taxable income. Oh, right, the table is based on adjusted gross income, so we have to subtract the standard deduction and exemptions to get taxable income.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, the table already accounts for four exemptions. So the amounts in the table are the taxes after considering those deductions. So no, I don't need to calculate anything else. The table is a quick lookup based on adjusted gross income.

So yes, Jerry's AGI is $8,975, which falls into the $8,950–$9,000 range for married filing jointly, so tax is $739. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

To determine Jerry Kohen's federal income tax, we use the provided tax table for married individuals filing a joint return with four exemptions. Jerry's adjusted gross income (AGI) is $8,975, which falls within the $8,950–$9,000 range. According to the table, the tax for this range is $739. 

The table already accounts for the standard deduction and exemptions, so no further calculations are needed. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: $739

Answer: D
