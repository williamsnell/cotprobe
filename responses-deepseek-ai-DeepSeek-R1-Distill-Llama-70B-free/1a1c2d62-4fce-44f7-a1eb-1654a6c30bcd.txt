Question:

A developer is the owner of a parcel of land in fee simple absolute (the record title is also in the developer). The parcel of land is and has been unpossessed land. Assume that each person listed below as the grantee in a deed paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it. The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions. The owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is

Options:

A: the artist.
B: the engineer.
C: the developer.
D: the dentist.
E: all of the above.
F: the developer and the artist jointly.
G: the bartender.
H: the counselor and the engineer jointly.
I: none of the above.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. Let me start by breaking down the facts given.

So, the developer owns a parcel of land in fee simple absolute. The record title is in the developer's name, and the land has been unpossessed. Now, there are several conveyances happening, each by a general warranty deed. The order of conveyances is:

1. Artist conveys to Bartender.
2. Developer conveys to Artist.
3. Artist conveys to Counselor.
4. Bartender conveys to Dentist.
5. Counselor conveys to Engineer.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing because the first conveyance is Artist to Bartender, but the developer hasn't conveyed to the Artist yet. Hmm, but in the second point, the developer conveys to the Artist, which would mean that the Artist gets the land from the developer. But before that, the Artist sold it to the Bartender? That doesn't make sense because the Artist wouldn't have the land yet. Oh wait, maybe the order is the sequence of events. Let me clarify:

The conveyances take place in the order listed. So:

First, Artist → Bartender.

Second, Developer → Artist.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the Developer owns the land. So if the first conveyance is Artist to Bartender, the Artist can't convey what they don't own. Unless maybe the Artist had some prior claim or perhaps it's a mistake in the order. Or perhaps the sequence is that the Developer conveys to the Artist after the Artist has already conveyed to the Bartender. That seems odd, but I guess it's possible.

Wait, perhaps the conveyances happen in this order:

1. Artist conveys to Bartender. But the Artist doesn't have title yet, so this must be a wild deed. So Bartender gets a deed from Artist, but since Artist doesn't own, it's a problem.

2. Then, Developer conveys to Artist. Now the Artist gets the title from the Developer.

3. Then Artist conveys to Counselor. So after getting the title from the Developer, the Artist sells to the Counselor.

4. Bartender then conveys to Dentist. But Bartender's deed was from the Artist before the Developer conveyed to the Artist, so perhaps Bartender's title is defective.

5. Counselor conveys to Engineer.

Now, regarding recording: None were recorded until after the Artist-to-Counselor deed, which was the third conveyance. Then, the order of recording was: Developer to Artist first, then Artist to Bartender, then Artist to Counselor. So the order of recording is as follows:

- After the third deed (Artist to Counselor), they start recording. So the first to be recorded is the Developer to Artist, then Artist to Bartender, then Artist to Counselor.

Then, the Bartender's conveyance to Dentist and the Counselor's to Engineer were each recorded immediately after their respective executions.

So the recording order is important because this is a notice jurisdiction. So in a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded deed and who records first will have priority.

Let's outline the timeline:

Conveyances in order:

1. Artist → Bartender (let's call this Deed 1)
2. Developer → Artist (Deed 2)
3. Artist → Counselor (Deed 3)
4. Bartender → Dentist (Deed 4)
5. Counselor → Engineer (Deed 5)

Recording happens after Deed 3. The order of recording is:

- Deed 2 (Developer → Artist) recorded first
- Then Deed 1 (Artist → Bartender)
- Then Deed 3 (Artist → Counselor)
- Then, after their execution, Deed 4 and Deed 5 are recorded immediately.

Wait, but when were the deeds executed? Let me think again. The conveyances happen in the order listed, so Deed 1 is first, then Deed 2, etc.

So the recording happens after Deed 3 is executed. So up to that point (after Deed 3), the deeds 1, 2, 3 have been executed but not yet recorded. Then, they record Deed 2, then Deed 1, then Deed 3. So the recording order is Deed 2 first, then 1, then 3.

After that, Deed 4 (Bartender → Dentist) is executed and recorded immediately. So Deed 4 is recorded after Deed 3's recording. Similarly, Deed 5 is executed and recorded immediately.

Now, the issue is to determine the current owner, considering the recording acts.

In a notice jurisdiction, the recording act protects a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of prior unrecorded deeds and records first. The priority is determined by the order of recording and the notice.

Let me map the chain of title:

The Developer (D) conveys to Artist (A) in Deed 2, which is recorded first. So when D conveys to A, A gets title, but since Deed 2 is recorded first, it's the first in the record.

But wait, before that, A had conveyed to Bartender (B) in Deed 1. But at the time of Deed 1, A didn't have title yet because Deed 2 hadn't been executed. So Deed 1 is a wild deed because A didn't own the land when they conveyed to B. Therefore, B's title is invalid unless the subsequent conveyances fix it.

Wait, but then Deed 2 is executed, where D conveys to A. Now, A has title. Then, A conveys to B (Deed 1) and to C (Deed 3). But wait, the conveyances are in the order: A→B, then D→A, so when A conveys to B, A had no title. So B's deed is from someone who didn't have title at the time. Then D conveys to A, giving A title. Then A conveys to C.

But after that, the recording happens. So when the recording happens, D→A is recorded first, then A→B, then A→C.

So at the time of recording, the order is D→A, then A→B, then A→C. So in the records, it would appear that A first got title from D, then A conveyed to B, then to C.

But in reality, A had conveyed to B before getting title, so B's deed is invalid unless it's somehow saved by estoppel or something. But in property law, generally, a wild deed is invalid. So B's deed is no good because A didn't have title when he conveyed to B.

Wait, but after A gets title from D, A could convey to B again, but in this case, the conveyance happened before A had title, so it's a problem.

But perhaps the subsequent recording affects this. Let me think about each party's rights.

When A conveys to B (Deed 1), B has a deed from A, but A didn't have title yet. So B has a deed, but it's wild. Then D conveys to A, giving A title. Now, A has title and conveys to C (Deed 3). Then, the recording happens: D→A, then A→B, then A→C.

So when D→A is recorded, it's in the records. Then A→B is recorded. But B's deed was from A when A didn't have title, so when A later gets title, does that make B's deed valid? I think not, because when A conveyed to B, A had nothing to give. It's a done deal; B's deed is invalid. So when A later gets title, B can't claim because the deed was from A when A had no title.

Wait, but perhaps the recording of the deeds affects the priority. Let's think about it step by step.

After all the conveyances, the recordings are as follows:

1. D→A recorded first.
2. Then A→B recorded.
3. Then A→C recorded.

Now, when B conveys to Dentist (Deed 4), and then records immediately. Similarly, C conveys to Engineer (Deed 5) and records immediately.

Let's consider the ownership after each conveyance and recording.

Starting with D owning the property.

After Deed 1 (A→B): B has a deed from A, but A has no title. So B has nothing.

After Deed 2 (D→A): Now A has title from D. So A owns.

After Deed 3 (A→C): Now C gets title from A. So C owns.

But wait, the recording hasn't happened yet. So at this point, the deeds are not recorded. So when the recording happens, D→A is recorded first. So now, anyone searching the records would see that D conveyed to A, and then A conveyed to B, then to C.

But in a notice jurisdiction, the key is whether a subsequent purchaser had notice.

Let's look at each grantee:

- B (from A in Deed 1): At the time B took the deed, A had no title. So B has a wild deed. B has no title, but when A later gets title, does B get anything? No, because B's deed was from A when A had nothing. So B's interest is invalid.

- A (from D in Deed 2): A now has title.

- C (from A in Deed 3): C gets title from A after A had title. So C is a bona fide purchaser, assuming C had no notice of B's deed.

Wait, but when C took the deed, had B's deed been recorded? No, because the recording happened after Deed 3. So when C took the deed from A, the records didn't show anything because none had been recorded yet. So C, when taking the deed, would have no notice of B's prior deed because it wasn't recorded yet. So C would be a BFP (bona fide purchaser) for value without notice, and when C records, would have priority over B's unrecorded deed.

Wait, but in this case, the recording happened after Deed 3. So when C took the deed, the records were still empty. So C had no notice of B's deed. Therefore, when the deeds are recorded, D→A is first, then A→B, then A→C. So in the records, it would appear that A first got title, then conveyed to B, then to C.

But in reality, A conveyed to B before A had title, making B's deed invalid. So when the records show A→B, but B's deed was invalid, does that affect C's title?

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to determine the chain of title and who has the best claim.

Let me consider the recording act. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice and records first will prevail over an earlier purchaser who didn't record.

So let's map out the timeline with recordings:

- Deed 1: A→B (unrecorded at the time)
- Deed 2: D→A (unrecorded until after Deed 3)
- Deed 3: A→C (unrecorded until after Deed 3)

Then, after Deed 3, the recording occurs in the order: Deed 2, then Deed 1, then Deed 3.

So when Deed 2 is recorded, it's the first in the records. Then Deed 1 is recorded, showing that A conveyed to B. Then Deed 3 is recorded, showing A conveyed to C.

But in reality, Deed 1 happened before Deed 2, so when A conveyed to B, A had no title. So B's deed is invalid. But after Deed 2, A has title, then conveys to C (Deed 3). So C's deed is valid.

Now, when the recording happens, Deed 2 is first. So the record shows D→A, then A→B, then A→C. But B's deed was from a time when A had no title, so B has no claim. C's deed is valid, and since C recorded after B's unrecorded deed, but in a notice jurisdiction, C would have priority if C had no notice.

Wait, but when C took the deed, the records were blank, so C had no notice of any prior deeds. So C is a BFP and would have priority over B.

But then, when the deeds are recorded, the order is D→A, then A→B, then A→C. So from the records, it appears that C's deed is after B's, but B's deed is invalid. So when C records, does that matter?

Alternatively, perhaps the recording of the deeds affects the chain. Let's think about each party's rights.

B's deed (Deed 1) is from A when A had no title, so B has no rights. So when B conveys to Dentist (Deed 4), the Dentist gets nothing because B had nothing to give. So Deed 4 is invalid.

C's deed (Deed 3) is valid because A had title when conveying to C. Then C conveys to Engineer (Deed 5), who would get title.

So the current owner would be the Engineer, right? Because C had valid title and conveyed to Engineer, who recorded immediately.

Wait, but let's check the recording. After Deed 3, the recording was done in the order: Deed 2, Deed 1, Deed 3. So Deed 3 is recorded after Deed 1. But Deed 1's recording shows A→B, but that's a wild deed. So when Deed 3 is recorded, it's after B's deed was recorded, but B's deed is invalid.

But in any case, C's deed was recorded after B's, but since B's deed is invalid, it doesn't affect C's title.

Wait, but in the records, it shows A→B, then A→C. So when someone searches the records, they would see that A conveyed to B and then to C. But B's deed is from a time when A had no title, so B's deed is invalid. So C's deed is valid, and since C recorded after B's deed was recorded, but B's deed is invalid, C's recording would still be valid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.

In this scenario, the key is to determine the priority of each conveyance considering the recording act.

Let's list all the deeds and their recording status:

1. Deed 1: A→B, executed first, recorded second.
2. Deed 2: D→A, executed second, recorded first.
3. Deed 3: A→C, executed third, recorded third.
4. Deed 4: B→Dentist, executed fourth, recorded immediately (so after Deed 3's recording? Or after Deed 4's execution?)
5. Deed 5: C→Engineer, executed fifth, recorded immediately.

Wait, the exact timing is:

- Deeds 1-3 are executed in order: 1, 2, 3.

- Then, the recording happens: Deed 2, then 1, then 3.

- Then, Deed 4 is executed and recorded immediately.

- Then, Deed 5 is executed and recorded immediately.

So the recording order is:

Deed 2 (recorded after Deed 3's execution), then Deed 1, then Deed 3, then Deed 4, then Deed 5.

Now, let's analyze each party's rights.

When A conveys to B (Deed 1), B has a deed from A, but A didn't have title yet. So B has no valid claim.

When D conveys to A (Deed 2), A now has title.

When A conveys to C (Deed 3), C gets title from A, who now has it. So C is a BFP, assuming C had no notice of B's deed. At the time of Deed 3, the records were blank because nothing had been recorded yet. So C has no notice and is a BFP, so C's deed is valid.

Now, when the recording happens, Deed 2 is recorded first. So the record shows D→A. Then Deed 1 is recorded, showing A→B, but that's a wild deed. Then Deed 3 is recorded, showing A→C.

So from the records, it appears that A got title from D, then A conveyed to B, and then to C. But B's deed is invalid because A had no title at the time. So C's deed is valid.

Now, when B conveys to Dentist (Deed 4), B has nothing to give, so Dentist gets nothing. Similarly, when C conveys to Engineer (Deed 5), Engineer gets title from C, who had valid title.

So the Engineer would be the current owner.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

A: artist.

B: engineer.

C: developer.

D: dentist.

E: all of the above.

F: developer and artist jointly.

G: bartender.

H: counselor and engineer jointly.

I: none of the above.

So according to my reasoning, the Engineer (option B) would be the owner. So the answer would be B.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

When Deed 3 (A→C) is recorded, it's after Deed 1 (A→B) was recorded. So in the records, it shows A conveyed to B first, then to C. But in reality, A conveyed to B before A had title, so B's deed is invalid. So when C records, does C's deed take priority over B's because B's deed is invalid?

Wait, no. The recording order doesn't matter if the prior deed is invalid. Because B's deed is invalid, it's as if it never existed. So when C records, there's no valid prior deed affecting the title. So C's deed is valid and recorded. So the Engineer, who gets from C, would be the owner.

Wait, but what about the fact that B's deed was recorded before C's? Since B's deed is invalid, it doesn't affect C's title. So the Engineer would take free of B's claim.

So the current owner is the Engineer, which is option B.

Wait, but another angle: When A conveys to C (Deed 3), C is a BFP without notice. So C's title is good. Then C conveys to Engineer, who records immediately. So Engineer has a valid title.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is B.
