Question:

A man with a long history of criminal violence who is a psychopathic personality, often enjoys the act of mercilessly brutalizing innocent elderly people by physical torture that is heinous and shocking. He decides to torture the victim's father for no good reason. After the beating, the father is hospitalized and in intensive care. The victim was not present but read about it in the newspaper and heard about it from the authorities. Victim suffered extreme emotional distress and required medical treatment. Can victim bring a successful action against perpetrator for intentional infliction of emotional distress? (IIED)

Options:

A: No, because the perpetrator did not directly inflict emotional distress on the victim.
B: Yes, because the perpetrator had a history of violent behavior.
C: No, because victim was not present at the time that the outrageous behavior occurred.
D: Yes, because in torture cases there is strict liability imposed on the perpetrator.
E: No, because perpetrator did not know that the father had immediate family members.
F: No, because the victim did not suffer any physical injuries.
G: Yes, because the father's hospitalization was a direct result of the perpetrator's actions.
H: No, because the victim learned about the incident through a third party.
I: Yes, because the victim had to seek medical treatment due to the emotional distress caused.

Okay, so I've got this question about intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what IIED entails. From what I remember, IIED requires four elements: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions caused emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe.

The scenario here is about a man with a history of criminal violence and psychopathic tendencies. He tortures the victim's father, hospitalizing him in intensive care. The victim wasn't present but found out through the newspaper and authorities. The victim suffered extreme emotional distress and needed medical treatment.

So, the question is whether the victim can sue for IIED. Let's break it down.

First, the defendant's actions: torturing someone is definitely extreme and outrageous. He intended to cause harm, so that's the intentional part. The father was severely injured, so there's a clear causation between the action and the physical harm to the father.

But wait, the victim is the father's child. The question is about the victim's emotional distress. The issue is whether the defendant's actions towards the father can be the basis for IIED for the victim.

I think there's a concept called the "impact rule" and "zone of danger" in some cases. Wait, no, the zone of danger is more about negligence and whether the plaintiff was in the zone of physical impact. IIED can sometimes be about being a bystander. Oh right, the bystander theory. That's where a person witnesses an injury to another and suffers emotional distress as a result.

But in this case, the victim wasn't present. They learned about it through third parties. So does that affect the claim?

I recall that for bystander IIED, the plaintiff usually must be physically present at the event or arrive soon after. Also, they must have a close relationship with the injured person, like a family member. The distress must result from directly observing the injury or its immediate aftermath.

Here, the victim wasn't present. They read about it in the newspaper and heard from authorities. So, under the bystander theory, they might not qualify because they weren't there to witness it.

But wait, I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might allow for it if the distress is caused by learning about the incident, but I think traditionally, courts require the plaintiff to have been present.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because the perpetrator didn't directly inflict emotional distress on the victim. That seems to align with the idea that IIED requires direct action causing distress. But wait, isn't the distress caused by the action towards the father? So maybe the directness is about the emotional impact, not the physical action.

Option C says no because the victim wasn't present. That matches with the bystander rule requiring presence.

Option E says no because the perpetrator didn't know about the family. I'm not sure if the defendant's knowledge of the victim's relationship matters. Maybe, but if the defendant intended to harm the father, the emotional distress to the child is a foreseeable consequence. But I'm not certain about that point.

Option H says no because the victim learned through a third party. That also relates to the bystander presence issue.

So, considering the bystander rule, the victim wasn't present, so they can't claim IIED under that theory. But wait, IIED doesn't necessarily require being a bystander. There's another aspect where the defendant's actions are directed at the plaintiff, causing distress. But here, the actions were directed at the father, not the victim.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant's actions were towards the father, so the victim's distress is a result of that. So maybe it's a secondary victim situation. But without being present, can they still claim?

I think in most jurisdictions, the bystander must be present. Since the victim wasn't present, the claim might fail.

Looking at the options again, option C and H are possible.

Option C: No, because victim wasn't present.

Option H: No, because learned through third party.

I think presence is a bigger factor than the source of knowledge. So option C might be the reason.

Alternatively, some cases allow for IIED when the plaintiff is a close family member and the distress is severe, even without presence, but I'm not sure about that. The traditional rule requires presence.

So the answer would be that the victim can't bring a successful IIED claim because they weren't present when the outrageous behavior occurred. So option C.

But wait, another thought: some jurisdictions have moved away from the bystander rule's physical presence requirement, especially with the advent of technology, etc. But I think for the bar exam, the traditional approach is expected.

So, the correct answer would be C: No, because the victim wasn't present.

To determine whether the victim can bring a successful action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), we must analyze the elements of IIED and the specific facts of the case. IIED requires: (1) intentional or reckless conduct, (2) extreme and outrageous behavior, (3) a causal connection between the conduct and the emotional distress, and (4) severe emotional distress.

In this scenario, the defendant's actions—torturing the victim's father—clearly meet the first two elements, as the behavior was intentional and extreme. The victim suffered severe emotional distress requiring medical treatment, satisfying the fourth element. The key issue is whether the victim can establish the causal connection required for IIED, given that they were not present during the incident and learned about it through third parties.

The "bystander theory" of IIED typically requires the plaintiff to be physically present at the time of the outrageous conduct or to arrive shortly thereafter. Courts generally require direct observation of the incident or its immediate aftermath to establish the necessary causal link. Since the victim in this case was not present and learned about the incident through third parties, they do not meet this requirement under the traditional bystander rule.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The perpetrator's actions caused emotional distress indirectly through harm to the father, but the lack of direct infliction on the victim does not necessarily bar the claim.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The perpetrator's history of violence is irrelevant to whether the victim can bring an IIED claim.
- **Option C**: Correct. The victim's absence at the time of the outrageous behavior is a critical factor under the bystander rule, which traditionally requires physical presence.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no strict liability for IIED in this context.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The perpetrator's knowledge of the father's family is not a determining factor in this case.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Physical injury to the victim is not required for IIED, as the focus is on severe emotional distress.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the father's hospitalization was a direct result of the perpetrator's actions, this does not establish the necessary causal link for the victim's IIED claim.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While learning about the incident through third parties may be relevant, the more significant issue is the victim's absence during the incident.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The victim's need for medical treatment demonstrates severe distress but does not overcome the requirement of physical presence.

The correct answer is **C**, as the victim's absence during the incident bars the claim under the traditional bystander rule.
