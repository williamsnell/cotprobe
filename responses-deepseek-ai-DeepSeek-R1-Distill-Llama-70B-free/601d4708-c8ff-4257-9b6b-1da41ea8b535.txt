Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about x-ray diffraction. Hmm, I remember that x-rays have something to do with wavelengths and crystals. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says the x-ray tube is operated at 50 kV. I think the first part is to find the short-wavelength limit of the spectrum. Oh right, the maximum voltage in an x-ray tube determines the shortest wavelength emitted. I remember the formula for the minimum wavelength (shortest) is lambda_min = hc/(eV), where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, e is the electron charge, and V is the voltage.

Wait, what are the values here? Let me jot them down. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The electron charge e is 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. The voltage V is 50 kV, which is 50,000 volts.

So plugging in the numbers: lambda_min = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.602e-19 * 5e4). Let me calculate the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. The denominator is 1.602e-19 *5e4 = 8.01e-15 C·V, but wait, since V is in volts, and eV would have units of energy (e * V is in joules, right? Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J).

So denominator is 8.01e-15 J. So lambda_min = 1.9878e-25 / 8.01e-15 = approximately 2.48e-11 meters. Wait, because 1e-10 meters is 1 angstrom, so 2.48e-11 m is 0.248 Å. Hmm. Oh wait, looking at the options, option B starts with 0.248, but let me check my calculation again because sometimes factors might be off.

Wait, maybe I should recompute. Let me do it more accurately.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1.602e-19 C * 50,000 V = 1.602e-19 *5e4 = (1.602 *5) * 1e-15 = 8.01e-15 J.

So 1.9878e-25 / 8.01e-15 = 2.479e-11 meters. Convert to angstroms: 1e-10 m is 1 Å. So 2.479e-11 m is 0.2479 Å, which is approximately 0.248 Å. So part (a) is 0.248 Å.

Now part (b) is about the glancing angle for first-order reflection using the principal planes of a KCl crystal. I remember Bragg's Law here: nλ = 2d sinθ, where n is the order (here n=1), λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the glancing angle.

Wait, but what's the interplanar spacing d for KCl? The crystal is cubic, so the principal planes are probably (100) or similar, and the d-spacing is related to the lattice constant a. For a cubic crystal, the interplanar distance d for the principal planes (like (100)) is equal to a, the lattice parameter.

So I need to find 'a' for KCl. To find 'a', I can use the density formula. The density ρ is given by (M * N_A) / (a^3 * 10^24), wait, let me think again. Oh right, the density formula for a cubic crystal is ρ = (Z * M) / (a^3 * N_A), where Z is the number of formula units per unit cell. For KCl, it's a face-centered cubic structure, so each unit cell has 4 KCl formula units. So Z=4.

M is the molar mass. The molecular mass is given as 74.6 g/mol. Oh wait, that's the molar mass. So M = 74.6 g/mol.

Density ρ is given as 1.99e3 kg/m³. Wait, that's 1990 kg/m³. But I need to convert that to g/cm³ because the standard units are grams per cubic centimeter for such calculations. 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 1990 kg/m³ is 1.99 g/cm³.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. 1 kg/m³ is 0.001 g/cm³. So 1990 kg/m³ is 1990 * 0.001 = 1.99 g/cm³. Right.

So the formula for density is:

ρ = (Z * M) / (a^3 * N_A) * 1e6, because a is in meters and we're converting it to cm. Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly.

Wait, the formula is:

ρ = (Z * M) / (N_A * a^3) ) * 1e6 kg/m³? Hmm, perhaps I should recast it. Let me think.

The molar mass M is in g/mol. Avogadro's number N_A is 6.022e23 mol⁻¹. The unit cell volume is a³, where a is in cm, right? Because 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, but wait, no, in terms of cm, 1 m is 100 cm, so 1 m³ is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So the volume in cm³ is a^3, where a is in cm.

Wait, density is mass/volume. So:

mass = (Z * M) / N_A → in grams.

volume = a^3 (cm³).

So density ρ = mass / volume = (Z * M) / (N_A a^3) → units are g/cm³.

So rearranging for a^3: a^3 = (Z * M) / (ρ * N_A)

So plugging in the numbers:

Z=4 for KCl (since each unit cell has 4 KCl formula units).

M=74.6 g/mol.

ρ=1.99 g/cm³.

N_A=6.022e23 /mol.

So a^3 = (4 *74.6) / (1.99 * 6.022e23) → compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 4 *74.6 = 298.4 g·mol⁻¹.

Denominator: 1.99 g/cm³ *6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = approx 1.99 *6.022e23 → let me compute that.

1.99 *6.022 is about 11.983. So 11.983e23 → 1.1983e24.

So a^3 = 298.4 / (1.1983e24) → 298.4 / 1.1983e24 = approx 2.49e-22 cm³.

Wait, 298.4 / 1.1983 is approx 248.9, so a^3 = 248.9e-24 cm³? Wait, 298.4 / 1.1983e24 is 298.4 / (1.1983 * 1e24) → let's compute 298.4 /1.1983 = approx 249. So a^3 ≈ 249 /1e24 cm³ → a^3 = 2.49e-22 cm³.

Wait, but 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, but better to work in cm for now.

So a is the cube root of (2.49e-22 cm³). Let's compute that.

Cube root of 2.49e-22 cm³. Let me express it in terms of 1e-24 (since (1e-8 cm)^3 = 1e-24 cm³). So 2.49e-22 cm³ is 249e-24 cm³, which is 249*(1e-8 cm)^3.

So the cube root is cube_root(249) * 1e-8 cm. Cube root of 249 is approx 6.28 (since 6^3=216, 7^3=343; 6.3^3=250 approx). Let's say 6.3.

So a ≈6.3e-8 cm. Convert that to meters because when using Bragg's law, the d-spacing is in meters. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 6.3e-8 cm is 6.3e-10 m. So d = a = 6.3e-10 m or 0.63 Å? Wait no, wait 6.3e-8 cm is 6.3e-10 meters because 1 cm is 1e-2 m, so 6.3e-8 cm = 6.3e-10 m. That's 0.63 Å, but wait, earlier I thought d was 0.248 Å? No, no, d is the interplanar spacing, which is in angstroms. Wait, 6.3e-10 m is 0.63 Å. Hmm. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the calculation for a^3: let me recompute the numbers.

a^3 = (4 *74.6) / (1.99 *6.022e23)

=> 298.4 / (1.99 *6.022e23) → 298.4 / (11.98e23) ≈ 24.9e-23 cm³? Or wait, 298.4 /11.98e23 = 24.9e0 /1e23 → 24.9e-23 cm³? Wait, no, 298.4 / (1.99 *6.022e23) → let me compute 1.99 *6.022e23 → 1.99*6.022 = 11.983, so 11.983e23.

So 298.4 / 11.983e23 = (298.4 /11.983) ) x 1e-23 → 298.4 /12 ≈24.866, so 24.866e-23 → 2.4866e-22 cm³.

Then a^3 = 2.4866e-22 cm³.

Cube root of that is (2.4866e-22)^(1/3). Let's compute 2.4866e-22 cm³.

Express 2.4866e-22 as 2.4866 x 10^-22 cm³.

Cube root of 2.4866 is approx 1.35, and cube root of 10^-22 is 10^(-22/3) ≈10^-7.333, which is 10^(-7) *10^(-0.333) → 1e-7 *0.464 = ~4.64e-8.

So a ≈ 1.35 *4.64e-8 cm → approximately 6.27e-8 cm → 6.27e-10 m → 0.627 Å. Hmm, that's about 0.63 Å.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating a^3.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

a^3 = (4 *74.6) / (1.99 *6.022e23) → 298.4 / (11.983e23) → 298.4 /1.1983e24 → 0.2489e-21 cm³.

Wait, 298.4 /1.1983e24 → let me compute 298.4 divided by 1.1983e24.

Wait, 298.4 /1.1983e24 → 298.4 /1.1983 = approximately 249 → so 249e-24 cm³, which is 2.49e-22 cm³. So, a^3 = 2.49e-22 cm³.

Cube root of 2.49e-22 cm³. Let me compute cube root of 2.49 first, that's about 1.35.

Cube root of 1e-22 is (1e-24)^(1/3) is 1e-8, but wait, 1e-22 is (1e-8)^3 *1e2, so cube root is 1e-8 * (1e2)^(1/3) → 1e-8 * ~4.64 → 4.64e-8 cm.

So a=1.35 *4.64e-8 cm → about 6.26e-8 cm → 6.26e-10 m → 0.626 Å.

Okay, so d-spacing is 0.626 Å.

Now, Bragg's Law: nλ=2d sinθ. Here, n=1, λ=0.248 Å, d=0.626 Å.

So sinθ = (nλ)/(2d) = (1 *0.248) / (2 *0.626) → 0.248/(1.252) → approx 0.198.

So θ = arcsin(0.198) → let's calculate that.

I remember that sin(11.5 degrees) is about 0.199, so θ is approximately 11.5 degrees. Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 2 degrees. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the d-spacing calculation. Because KCl has a face-centered cubic structure, the principal planes might not be (100). Wait, no, the principal planes are the (100) planes for simple cubic, but for face-centered cubic (fcc), the lowest-order reflection is from (111) planes, but wait no, the principal planes usually refer to the (100) planes, but the calculation of d-spacing would be different.

Wait no, wait, the (hkl) planes determine d-spacing. For a cubic crystal, d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²)}.

Wait, for the principal planes, perhaps the (100) planes. So h=1, k=0, l=0. So d = a /1 = a. So earlier calculation of d=0.626 Å was correct.

Wait, but when I plug into Bragg's Law, I get sinθ = 0.248/(2*0.626) = 0.248/(1.252) ≈ 0.198. So θ ≈11.5 degrees, but the options are way lower. So I must have made a mistake. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of d-spacing. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe the formula uses a in angstroms, not meters. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the unit in the density formula. Let me go back.

Density formula again: ρ = (Z*M)/(N_A * a^3), but the units have to be consistent. M is in g/mol, a is in cm, and ρ is in g/cm³.

Wait, let me verify the formula:

ρ (g/cm³) = [ (Z * M (g/mol)) / (N_A (mol⁻¹) * a^3 (cm³/unit cell)) ].

So yes, that gives g/cm³.

So plugging in the numbers again:

Z=4, M=74.6 g/mol, ρ=1.99 g/cm³, N_A=6.022e23.

a^3 = (Z*M) / (ρ*N_A) → (4 *74.6) / (1.99 *6.022e23) → 298.4/(1.99*6.022e23).

Compute denominator: 1.99 *6.022e23 = approx 11.98e23 → 1.198e24.

So a^3 = 298.4 /1.198e24 → 298.4 /1.198e24 = approximately 2.49e-22 cm³.

Cube root of 2.49e-22 cm³. Let's compute more accurately.

Cube root of 2.49e-22 = (2.49)^(1/3) * (1e-22)^(1/3).

2.49^(1/3) is about 1.35, because 1.35^3 = 2.46 approx.

(1e-22)^(1/3) = 1e-7.333, which is 1e-7 * 1e-0.333 → since 10^(-0.333) is about 0.464, so 4.64e-8 cm.

So a = 1.35 *4.64e-8 cm → approximately 6.26e-8 cm, which is 6.26e-10 m or 0.626 Å.

Wait, so d=0.626 Å. Then, using Bragg's Law with λ=0.248 Å.

n=1, so sinθ = (1*0.248)/(2*0.626) = 0.248/(1.252) ≈0.198.

So θ = sin⁻¹(0.198) ≈11.5 degrees. But wait, all the options for part (b) are around 2 degrees, like 2.1, 2.2, etc. So clearly I'm making a mistake here.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the d-spacing calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the principal planes are not (100), but another set.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I messed up the formula for the interplanar spacing when using different planes. Because the principal planes might be (200) or something else, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the principal planes for KCl are (200), which would make d-spacing smaller. Because if the planes are (200), then h=2, so d = a / sqrt(2² +0+0) )= a/2. That would make d=0.313 Å, which is half of the previous value.

Wait, but why would the principal planes be (200)? No, the principal planes are the (100) planes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the plane indices. Maybe the
