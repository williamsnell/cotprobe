Okay, so I've got this problem here about antennas and radiation resistance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the antenna radiates a power of 8 kW and draws a current of 20 A. I need to find the radiation resistance. Right, I remember that radiation resistance is the resistance an antenna presents to the current flowing through it, which is responsible for the power radiated as electromagnetic waves.

Wait, what's the formula for power in terms of current and resistance? Oh right, power P is equal to I squared times R, where I is current and R is resistance. So the formula should be P = I²R.

Let me plug in the values. The power P is 8 kW, which is 8000 watts. The current I is 20 A. So substituting into the formula, 8000 = (20)^2 * R.

Calculating 20 squared, that's 400. So the equation becomes 8000 = 400 * R. To solve for R, I divide both sides by 400. So R = 8000 / 400. Let me do that division. 8000 divided by 400 is 20. So R equals 20 ohms.

Looking at the options, option H is 20 ohms. So the answer should be H.

Wait, did I make any mistakes? Let me double-check. The power formula for radiation is indeed P = I²R. Yes, that's correct. The calculations: 20 squared is 400, 8000 divided by 400 is 20. Yep, that's right. So I think I'm confident with that.

The radiation resistance of an antenna can be calculated using the formula \( P = I^2 R \), where \( P \) is the power, \( I \) is the current, and \( R \) is the radiation resistance. Given \( P = 8 \, \text{kW} = 8000 \, \text{W} \) and \( I = 20 \, \text{A} \), we substitute these values into the formula:

\[
8000 = (20)^2 \cdot R
\]

\[
8000 = 400 \cdot R
\]

Solving for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{8000}{400} = 20 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the radiation resistance is \( 20 \, \Omega \), which corresponds to option H.
