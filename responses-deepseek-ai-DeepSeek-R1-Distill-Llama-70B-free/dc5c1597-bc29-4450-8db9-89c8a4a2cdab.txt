Okay, so I've got this question about spinal nerves and their dorsal roots. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my neuroanatomy, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is asking what the dorsal roots of all spinal nerves contain. The options are from A to J, each listing different combinations of neuronal processes.

First, I remember that spinal nerves have two main roots: the dorsal (or posterior) root and the ventral (or anterior) root. I think the ventral root is involved with motor functions because it carries signals from the central nervous system to muscles and glands. So the ventral root has motor neurons.

Now, the dorsal root. I recall that it's primarily sensory. The dorsal root contains the axons of sensory neurons, which bring information from sensory receptors towards the spinal cord and eventually the brain. These are afferent pathways because they're coming into the CNS.

Wait, but the question is about the content of the dorsal roots. So the key is whether there's anything else besides sensory. I thought the ventral root handles motor, including both somatic motor and autonomic (like sympathetic) fibers. But the dorsal root is just sensory, right?

Let me think about autonomic. Autonomic nervous system has both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. Sympathetic outflow originates from the thoracolumbar regions of the spinal cord. The preganglionic neurons are in the spinal cord, and their axons leave via the ventral roots. So the ventral root carries these motor (autonomic) fibers. So the autonomic processes are in the ventral root, not the dorsal.

So the dorsal root doesn't have autonomic or motor processes. It's purely sensory.

Looking at the options:

A: motor and autonomic - no, that's ventral.
B: both autonomic and motor - same as A.
C: sensory and motor - no, motor is ventral.
D: sensory and autonomic - no, autonomic is ventral.
E: motor only - no.
F: only autonomic - no.
G: no processes - no, definitely has some.
H: all three - no.
I: sensory only - yes, that's what I was thinking.
J: autonomic only - no.

So the correct answer should be I: sensory neuronal processes.

Wait, but I should double-check. Are there any exceptions or special cases? For example, could there be any autonomic fibers in the dorsal root? I don't think so. The autonomic is motor, so it's in the ventral root. Dorsal is purely incoming sensory.

Another way to remember: the mnemonic "Rexed laminae" or something about the spinal cord structure, but that's about the gray matter. Alternatively, the "dorsal root ganglion" contains the cell bodies of the sensory neurons whose axons make up the dorsal root. So that reinforces that it's sensory.

So yeah, the answer is I.

The dorsal roots of spinal nerves are responsible for transmitting sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. They contain the axons of sensory neurons, which are afferent (incoming) pathways. In contrast, motor and autonomic neuronal processes are found in the ventral roots, which carry efferent (outgoing) signals. Therefore, the dorsal roots specifically contain sensory neuronal processes.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, H**: Incorrect because they include motor or autonomic processes, which are not present in the dorsal roots.
- **C, E, F, G, J**: Incorrect because they either include motor or autonomic processes or suggest no processes, which is not the case.
- **I**: Correct, as it accurately states that the dorsal roots contain only sensory neuronal processes.

Answer: I
