Okay, I've got this problem about vapor pressure and boiling points. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about two substances A and B. Both have the same vapor pressure of 0.132 atm at 15°C. But their heats of vaporization are different: A is 25,000 J/mol and B is 35,000 J/mol. I need to find their normal boiling points. 

Wait, normal boiling point is when the vapor pressure equals 1 atm, right? So each substance will reach their boiling point at different temperatures where their vapor pressure hits 1 atm. 

I remember there's an equation related to vapor pressure and temperature. Oh, right! The Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It's used to relate the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature. The equation is usually written in the form:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Where:
- P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2.
- ΔHvap is the enthalpy (heat) of vaporization.
- R is the gas constant.

In this problem, for each substance, we have P1 = 0.132 atm at T1 = 15°C. We need to find T2 (the boiling point) where P2 = 1 atm. 

So for each substance, I'll plug in the values into the equation and solve for T2. Let me write down the variables.

First, convert temperature from Celsius to Kelvin because the equation requires absolute temperature. T1 = 15 + 273.15 = 288.15 K.

R is the gas constant. I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So the equation becomes:

ln(1 atm / 0.132 atm) = (ΔHvap / 8.314) * (1/288.15 - 1/T2)

Wait, let me compute the left side first. ln(1/0.132) is ln(7.5758). Let me calculate that. I remember ln(7) is about 1.9459, ln(8) is about 2.0794. 7.5758 is closer to 7.5, which is e^2 is 7.389, so ln(7.5)= about 2.015. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator. But since I'm just thinking, maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps I'll just keep it as ln(1/0.132) for now.

Wait, perhaps I'll compute the numerical values for each substance.

Starting with substance A: ΔHvap = 25,000 J/mol.

Let's rearrange the equation to solve for T2.

The equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

We can rearrange to solve for 1/T2:

1/T2 = 1/T1 - (ln(P2/P1) * R) / ΔHvap

Wait, wait, let me correct that. Let me write the steps.

Starting from:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Multiply both sides by R/(ΔHvap):

(R / ΔHvap) * ln(P2/P1) = (1/T1) - (1/T2)

Then, 1/T2 = (1/T1) - (R / ΔHvap) * ln(P2/P1)

Wait no, that's correct. So 1/T2 equals 1/T1 minus (R * ln(P2/P1))/(ΔHvap).

Wait, but wait, when P2 > P1, then ln(P2/P1) is positive. So for each substance, when it's going from lower P to higher P, which is when we're increasing the temperature to reach boiling point. So this should make sense.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, for substance A:

ΔHvap = 25,000 J/mol.

P1 = 0.132 atm; P2 = 1 atm.

So ln(P2/P1) = ln(1/0.132) ≈ ln(7.5758). Let me compute this. Let me see: ln(7) is about 1.9459, ln(8)=2.0794. 7.5758 is between 7 and 8. Let's compute it more accurately. 7.5758 is 7.5758.

I can compute ln(7.5758) as follows: Let me think of e^2 is about 7.389. So 7.5758 is a bit higher. Let's compute 2.02: e^2.02 ≈ e^2 * e^0.02 ≈ 7.389 * 1.0202 ≈ 7.53. Hmm, which is close to 7.53, but our value is 7.5758. So 2.02 gives about 7.53.

What about 2.025? Let's see: e^0.025 is about 1.0253. So e^2.025 = 7.389 * 1.0253 ≈ 7.576, which is our value. So ln(7.5758) ≈ 2.025.

So for substance A, ln(P2/P1) is approximately 2.025.

Now, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So let's plug in the numbers:

1/T2 = (1/288.15) - (8.314 * 2.025) / 25000

Compute each term.

First, 1/288.15 ≈ 0.003473 K^-1.

Next, numerator: 8.314 * 2.025 ≈ let's compute 8 * 2.025 =16.2, 0.314*2.025≈0.636. So total ≈16.2 + 0.636 =16.836.

Denominator: 25000.

So the second term is 16.836 / 25000 ≈ 0.00067344.

So 1/T2 = 0.003473 - 0.00067344 ≈ 0.00280 K^-1.

So T2 ≈ 1 / 0.00280 ≈ 357.14 K.

Convert back to Celsius: 357.14 - 273.15 ≈ 83.99°C. Approximately 84°C.

Wait, wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Let me check for substance A.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's compute (8.314 * 2.025) / 25000.

8.314 * 2.025: Let me compute accurately.

8 * 2.025 = 16.2.

0.314 * 2.025: 0.3 * 2.025 = 0.6075; 0.014 * 2.025=0.02835. So total 0.6075 +0.02835=0.63585.

So total is 16.2 + 0.63585 =16.83585.

So 16.83585 / 25000 = 0.00067343.

So 1/T2 = (1/288.15) - 0.00067343.

Compute 1/288.15: 288.15 is approximately 288, so 1/288 is about 0.00347222. Let's compute it more accurately.

288.15 K.

1/288.15 = 1 ÷ 288.15 = approximately 0.003473 K^-1.

So 0.003473 - 0.00067343 = 0.00279957 ≈ 0.0028 K^-1.

So T2 = 1/0.0028 ≈ 357.14 K. Which is 357.14 - 273.15 = 83.99°C, so 84°C.

Wait, but let me check if I messed up the equation. Because I thought that when the temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. So for substance A, which has a lower heat of vaporization, it should have a lower boiling point than a substance with a higher heat of vaporization. Because lower ΔHvap means it's easier to vaporize, so it reaches higher vapor pressure at lower temperatures. Wait, but wait, when you have higher ΔHvap, the substance has stronger intermolecular forces, so it requires more energy (higher temperature) to vaporize. So substance B has higher ΔHvap than A, so B should have a higher boiling point than A.

Wait wait, but according to the calculation for substance A, the boiling point is about 84°C. Let me check for substance B and see what I get.

Now, for substance B: ΔHvap =35,000 J/mol.

Same P1 =0.132 atm, T1=288.15 K.

So again, ln(P2/P1)=2.025 as before.

1/T2 = (1/288.15) - (8.314 * 2.025)/35,000.

Compute the second term:

8.314 * 2.025 =16.83585 as before.

So 16.83585 /35,000 = 0.00048097.

So 1/T2 = 0.003473 - 0.00048097 ≈ 0.002992 K^-1.

So T2 is 1/0.002992 ≈ 334.1 K.

Convert to Celsius: 334.1 -273.15 = 60.95°C, approximately 61°C.

Hmm, that would mean substance A boils at 84°C and substance B at 61°C. So A's boiling point is higher than B's. But wait, I thought that higher ΔHvap would require higher temperature to boil. Because higher ΔHvap means more energy needed to vaporize, so higher boiling point. But according to this calculation, B has higher ΔHvap but lower boiling point. That doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning or calculations.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Wait the calculation for B gives a lower temperature. Wait, no, because when you have higher ΔHvap, the denominator is larger, so the subtracted term is smaller.

Wait, in the equation, 1/T2 = (1/T1) - (R * ln(P2/P1)) / ΔHvap.

So for higher ΔHvap, the second term (R * ... /ΔHvap) is smaller. So 1/T2 is [something] minus a smaller number. So 1/T2 would be larger, meaning T2 is smaller. Because 1/T2 is larger → T2 is smaller.

Wait, that's opposite of what I thought. So, higher ΔHvap leads to lower 1/T2, so higher T2? Wait, no.

Wait, let's think: For the same change in pressure (from 0.132 atm to 1 atm), the substance with higher ΔHvap will require a higher temperature to reach 1 atm.

Wait, in the equation, if ΔHvap is higher, the term (R * ln(P2/P1))/ΔHvap is smaller because denominator is larger, so 1/T2 = (1/T1) - (smaller number). So 1/T2 is a larger number than if the term was bigger. So higher ΔHvap leads to a larger 1/T2, which is a smaller T2. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply that higher ΔHvap leads to lower boiling point, which contradicts what I know.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me think again. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

So when T2 is larger than T1, 1/T2 is smaller than 1/T1, so 1/T1 - 1/T2 is positive. So for a given increase in pressure (from P1 to P2), the equation says that with higher ΔHvap, you get a larger increase in temperature. Let me think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's consider that when ΔHvap is higher, the slope of the ln P vs 1/T curve is steeper. So for the same change in P, a substance with higher ΔHvap needs a smaller change in T to reach that P. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, perhaps an example would help. Let's say for two substances, X and Y. X has higher ΔHvap than Y. At a certain temperature T, both have the same vapor pressure. When we increase the temperature, which one reaches a higher vapor pressure faster? The one with lower ΔHvap, because substances with lower ΔHvap vaporize more easily, so their vapor pressure increases more rapidly with temperature. So at a higher temperature, substance Y (lower ΔHvap) would reach 1 atm vapor pressure before substance X (higher ΔHvap). So Y would have a lower boiling point than X. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

So according to this, the substance with lower ΔHvap has a lower boiling point. But wait, in my earlier calculation, for substance A (lower ΔHvap), I got a higher boiling point than substance B (higher ΔHvap). That's conflicting.

Wait, no. According to my earlier calculation, substance A (ΔHvap=25,000) had a boiling point of ~84°C, and substance B (ΔHvap=35,000) had ~61°C. So A with lower ΔHvap boils at a higher temperature. That's the opposite of what I just thought.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The boiling point is where the vapor pressure equals 1 atm. So if a substance can reach 1 atm vapor pressure at a lower temperature, that means it has a lower boiling point. So if a substance with lower ΔHvap can reach 1 atm at a lower temperature, then it has a lower boiling point. But according to my calculation, substance A (lower ΔHvap) boils at higher temperature (84°C) than B (higher ΔHvap) which boils at 61°C. Which would mean that B has a lower boiling point than A. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because B has a higher ΔHvap, it should have a higher boiling point, not lower.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's see, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for substance B.

Let me recalculate the numbers for substance B.

ΔHvap =35,000 J/mol.

P2=1 atm, P1=0.132 atm. So ln(1/0.132)=2.025 as before.

So the equation is:

1/T2 = (1/288.15) - (8.314 * 2.025)/35,000

Compute (8.314 * 2.025)= 16.83585.

Divide by 35,000: 16.83585 /35,000 = 0.000480997.

So 1/T2 = 0.003473 - 0.000480997 = 0.002992 K^-1.

So T2 = 1 / 0.002992 ≈ 334.1 K.

Which is 334.1 -273.15=60.95°C, so about 61°C.

Wait, but if substance B has a higher ΔHvap, why is it boiling at a lower temperature? That doesn't make sense. Because higher ΔHvap should mean higher boiling point because it's harder to vaporize. So I must have made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the equation. Let me double-check the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Which can be rearranged to:

1/T2 = 1/T1 - (R/ΔHvap) * ln(P2/P1)

Wait, no, correct rearrangement:

Starting from:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2)

Multiply both sides by R/ΔHvap:

(R/ΔHvap) * ln(P2/P1) = 1/T1 - 1/T2

Then, 1/T2 = 1/T1 - (R/ΔHvap) * ln(P2/P1)

Wait, that's correct as I did earlier. So perhaps my mistake is in assuming the direction of the change. Let me think: If ΔHvap is higher, then (R/ΔHvap) is smaller, so the term being subtracted is smaller, leading to a larger 1/T2, which is a smaller T2. So higher ΔHvap leads to lower T2, which is the boiling point. That can't be right because higher ΔHvap should require higher temperature to boil.

Wait, perhaps I have the equation backward. Let me check another source. Oh wait, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is often written as:

ln(P) = -ΔHvap/(R T) + C

So when T increases, P increases. But the slope is -ΔHvap/R. So the equation I used earlier is correct. So perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps my assumption about which way the temperature changes is incorrect. Let's think: when you increase the temperature, the vapor pressure increases. So if a substance has a higher ΔHvap, its vapor pressure doesn't increase as rapidly with temperature. So to reach the same vapor pressure (1 atm), a higher temperature is needed.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say two substances at the same T have same P. The one with higher ΔHvap will have a steeper slope in the ln(P) vs 1/T plot. Wait, no, wait: the slope is -ΔHvap/R. So higher ΔHvap means a more negative slope. So for a given change in 1/T, the change in ln(P) is more negative. So, to reach a higher P (like from 0.132 atm to 1 atm), you need a larger change in T for the higher ΔHvap substance. 

Wait, that makes sense. Let me try with an example. Suppose at T1, both substances have P=0.132 atm. To reach P=1 atm, substance A with lower ΔHvap will require a smaller increase in T than substance B with higher ΔHvap. So substance A will have a lower boiling point than substance B. Wait, no, because if you need a larger T to reach higher P for substance B, that means substance B has a higher boiling point. Because it's harder to vaporize, so you need to
