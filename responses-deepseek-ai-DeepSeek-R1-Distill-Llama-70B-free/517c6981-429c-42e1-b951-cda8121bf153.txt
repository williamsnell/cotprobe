Question:

Suppose a stock has the following information. It is listed on the London stock exchange and operates throughout Europe. The yield on a UK 10 year treasury is 2.8%. The stock in question will earn 8.6% as per historical data. The Beta for the stock is 1.4, i.e., it is 140% volatile to the changes in the general stock market. What is the expected rate of return?

Options:

A: 5.6
B: 2.8
C: 1.4
D: 10.92
E: 7.98
F: 6.2
G: 9.4
H: 8.6
I: 11.76
J: 12.34

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the expected rate of return for a stock. Hmm, I remember from my finance classes that this probably involves the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me some data points. The stock is listed on the London Stock Exchange and operates in Europe. The yield on a UK 10-year treasury is 2.8%, which I think is the risk-free rate. The stock's historical return is 8.6%, but I don't think that's directly used in the CAPM formula. Oh wait, no, the CAPM uses the risk-free rate, beta, and the expected market return.

Wait, right, the CAPM formula is: Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta*(Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). So I need the market return as well. But the question doesn't explicitly give the market return. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the market return here is the same as the stock's historical return? Or maybe I'm supposed to assume the market return is the risk-free rate plus some equity premium?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline the given data:

- Risk-free rate (Rf) = 2.8% (from UK 10-year treasury)
- Beta (β) = 1.4
- Stock's historical return = 8.6%, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the expected return we're calculating here.

Wait, the question is about the expected rate of return using the CAPM. So I don't use the stock's historical return directly. Instead, I need the expected market return. But the question doesn't provide the market return. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question states that the stock will earn 8.6% as per historical data. Oh, perhaps that's the expected market return? That would make sense if the market's expected return is given. Because the question is asking for the expected return of the stock, so the CAPM uses the market's expected return.

So the formula would be:

Expected Return (stock) = Rf + β*(Market Return - Rf)

Plugging in the numbers:

Rf = 2.8%
β = 1.4
Market Return (assuming it's the 8.6% given) = 8.6%

So substituting:

= 2.8% + 1.4*(8.6% - 2.8%)
= 2.8% + 1.4*(5.8%)
Now calculate 5.8 * 1.4. Let's see, 5 * 1.4 is 7, and 0.8*1.4 is 1.12, so total 8.12.

Adding that to 2.8% gives 2.8 + 8.12 = 10.92%.

Looking at the options, option D is 10.92, which would be the correct answer. Wait, but let me double-check if I assumed the market return correctly. The question says the stock's historical return is 8.6%, but the market's expected return isn't provided. Oh wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the historical return of the market as the expected return. But the question doesn't give the market's historical return. Hmm, maybe I misread the question.

Wait, the question says the stock is earning 8.6% as per historical data. Oh, perhaps that's the market's return because it's a general figure. Or maybe it's the stock's return, and the market's return is different. But since the market's return isn't given, I think the question is structured such that the 8.6% is the market's expected return.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables. Let me think again. The CAPM formula requires the expected market return. If the question doesn't provide it, perhaps I need to infer it. Wait, the only other return mentioned is the risk-free rate. Maybe I'm supposed to use another approach, but I don't think so. No, I think the 8.6% is intended as the market return.

So going back, the calculation gives 10.92%, which is option D.
</think>

To calculate the expected rate of return for the stock, we use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula:

\[
\text{Expected Return} = R_f + \beta \times (R_m - R_f)
\]

Where:
- \( R_f \) = Risk-free rate = 2.8% (from the UK 10-year treasury yield).
- \( \beta \) = Beta of the stock = 1.4.
- \( R_m \) = Expected market return. The question states that the stock's historical return is 8.6%, which is assumed to represent the market's expected return.

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Expected Return} = 2.8\% + 1.4 \times (8.6\% - 2.8\%)
\]

First, calculate the market risk premium:

\[
8.6\% - 2.8\% = 5.8\%
\]

Then multiply by the beta:

\[
1.4 \times 5.8\% = 8.12\%
\]

Finally, add the risk-free rate:

\[
2.8\% + 8.12\% = 10.92\%
\]

Thus, the expected rate of return for the stock is **10.92%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
