Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The problem is about an indicator, phenolphthalein. I remember that phenolphthalein is commonly used in acid-base titrations. The In^- form is red, and the HIn form is colorless. So the solution starts colorless, which means it's in the HIn form, I guess.

The question says that the dissociation constant, K_d, is 1e-9. Wait, wait. Wait, no, it says K_diss is 1e-9. Hmm, I think K_diss refers to the dissociation of the indicator. So the dissociation reaction is probably HIn ⇌ H+ + In^-. So K_diss would be [H+][In^-]/[HIn] = 1e-9.

The problem gives me a 50 ml solution of phenolphthalein. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the concentration of the phenolphthalein solution. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's assuming a certain concentration, but perhaps I can figure it out without it because maybe it's a 0.10 M solution as well? Or perhaps the initial concentration isn't needed because of how the problem is structured.

Wait, no, the solution is colorless, which is HIn. So when you add NaOH, it will deprotonate HIn to In^-.

The goal is to find how much 0.10 M NaOH solution needs to be added to make the solution red. The red color appears when In^- is present. So we need to add enough NaOH to convert enough HIn into In^- so that the concentration of In^- is sufficient for the solution to appear red.

Wait, but how much is enough? I think for the indicator to change color, the concentration of In^- should be significantly higher than HIn. Or perhaps when the pH is such that [In^-]/[HIn] is greater than 1. Because then In^- would dominate, making it red.

Alternatively, the color change happens when [In^-]/[HIn] is about 1, so when the pH is around the pKa of the indicator.

Wait, phenolphthalein has a pKa around 8.3, if I remember correctly. But I'm not sure if that's given here. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it.

Wait, the problem gives K_diss as 1e-9, so the pKa would be -log(1e-9) = 9. So the pKa is 9. So the color change happens around pH 9.

But wait, the solution is colorless at lower pH (HIn), and red when pH is above the pKa (In^-).

So, to make the solution red, the pH needs to be above 9.

So the problem is about adding NaOH to the solution until pH reaches ~9.

But wait, the solution is initially colorless, so HIn is predominant. When you add enough OH- to deprotonate HIn, the pH increases, and In^- forms, making it red.

So, how much NaOH should be added to reach pH 9?

Wait, but the solution is made of phenolphthalein, which is a weak acid (HIn). So when you add a strong base like NaOH, it will react with HIn.

The reaction is: HIn + OH- → In^- + H2O.

So, for every mole of NaOH added, one mole of HIn is converted into In^-.

The initial solution is 50 ml of phenolphthalein. But I don't know the concentration of phenolphthalein. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I can model this as a buffer solution?

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the initial solution is 0.10 M in HIn. But the problem doesn't say that. Hmm, maybe the solution is 0.10 M HIn, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't matter because the problem is designed in such a way that the concentration cancels out.

Wait, let's think in terms of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([In^-]/[HIn]).

We want the solution to be red, so [In^-] > [HIn], meaning pH > pKa. So, perhaps the point where [In^-] equals [HIn] is when pH = pKa = 9. But to make the solution red, we need to reach pH 9, but wait, phenolphthalein starts to change around pH 8.3. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with another indicator.

Wait, regardless, the K_diss is given as 1e-9, so pKa is 9.

So when the solution's pH is 9, [In^-] = [HIn]. To make the solution red, the pH needs to be higher than 9, but perhaps the transition happens around that point.

Alternatively, perhaps for the solution to appear red, the [In^-] needs to be about equal to or greater than [HIn]. So let's model the point where [In^-] = [HIn], which would occur at pH = pKa = 9.

So, how much OH- do we need to add to reach pH 9?

Wait, but the solution is initially HIn, which is a weak acid. So when you add OH-, it will neutralize HIn.

Let me think about the initial state. The solution is 50 ml of phenolphthalein, which I'll assume is a solution of HIn. But the concentration isn't given, which complicates things. Wait, perhaps the solution is 0.10 M HIn, but the problem doesn't say that. Hmm, maybe the initial concentration of HIn is 0.10 M? Or perhaps that's the NaOH solution's concentration.

Wait, the question says: "how much 0.10 M NaOH solution would one have to add". So the NaOH is 0.10 M. But the initial phenolphthalein solution's concentration isn't given. Maybe it's also 0.10 M? Or perhaps it's not needed because it's a dilute solution.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as the point where the OH- added is enough to deprotonate HIn to the point where the solution is In^- dominant.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the K_diss.

So, the equilibrium is HIn ⇌ H+ + In^-.

The K_diss is 1e-9. So,

K_diss = [H+][In^-]/[HIn] = 1e-9.

If I add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with H+ ions. But in this case, the solution is of HIn, which is a weak acid. So adding OH- will deprotonate HIn.

The reaction is: HIn + OH- → In^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- added converts a mole of HIn into In^-.

Let me denote the volume of NaOH added as V liters.

The moles of NaOH added would be 0.10 M * V = 0.10 V moles.

The initial solution has 0.05 L (50 ml) of HIn. Let me assume the initial concentration of HIn is C. But since it's not given, maybe C is irrelevant, or perhaps it's 0.10 M as well? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can model it without knowing the initial concentration.

Wait, but without knowing the initial concentration, I don't know how to calculate the moles of HIn. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the solution is 0.10 M in HIn. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, initial moles of HIn: 0.10 M * 0.05 L = 0.005 moles.

When we add V liters of 0.10 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.10 V.

Each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of HIn, producing In^-.

So, moles of HIn after reaction: 0.005 - 0.10 V.

Moles of In^- formed: 0.10 V.

Wait, but if V is larger than 0.05 L, then 0.10 V would be 0.005, which would mean all HIn is converted. But since we're aiming for the point where the solution becomes red, which occurs when enough In^- is present, perhaps V is small, so we can assume that 0.10 V << 0.005, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, if I add V liters of 0.10 M NaOH, the moles of OH- added are 0.10 V. These will react with HIn in a 1:1 ratio, producing In^-.

So after reaction, the moles of HIn = initial moles - moles OH- added.

Moles HIn = 0.10 * 0.05 - 0.10 V = 0.005 - 0.10 V.

Moles In^- = 0.10 V.

But wait, the solution's total volume is now 0.05 + V liters.

Wait, but when you mix the solutions, the volume increases, so concentrations are moles divided by total volume.

But maybe it's better to model the concentrations.

Let me define:

[HIn] = (0.005 - 0.10 V) / (0.05 + V)

[In^-] = (0.10 V) / (0.05 + V)

We can ignore the activity coefficients and assume concentrations are dilute.

Now, the pH of the solution is determined by the dissociation of HIn and the added OH-.

Wait, but when we add strong base, the solution's pH is primarily determined by the excess OH-.

Wait, but in this case, the NaOH is reacting with HIn. So the OH- is being consumed to deprotonate HIn. So perhaps the solution's pH isn't just from excess OH-, but from the resulting equilibrium.

Wait, but maybe we can approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([In^-]/[HIn]).

We want the solution to be red, which implies that [In^-] >> [HIn], so the pH should be higher than pKa. So when pH is 9, the ratio [In^-]/[HIn] is 1. To have red color, we need [In^-] > [HIn], so pH needs to be above 9.

Wait, but the solution's pH is also influenced by the strong base we're adding. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a buffer solution. After adding NaOH, the solution contains both HIn and In^-, so it's a buffer. The pH of a buffer is given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, using pH = pKa + log([In^-]/[HIn]).

We want pH = 9 (pKa is 9, as K_diss is 1e-9). So, when pH = pKa, the ratio [In^-]/[HIn] is 1. So that's the point where the solution is half red, perhaps the endpoint.

But to make the solution red, perhaps we need to reach this point, so that [In^-] equals [HIn].

Alternatively, perhaps the solution will start to appear red when [In^-] is about 10% of [HIn], but I'm not certain. Maybe the solution is considered red when [In^-]/[HIn] is greater than 1, so pH is above pKa.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can assume that the solution turns red when [In^-] = [HIn], i.e., at pH = pKa = 9.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the solution after adding NaOH. The solution contains HIn and In^- as a buffer. The pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations.

So, when [In^-] = [HIn], pH = pKa = 9.

If I can calculate the volume V of 0.10 M NaOH needed to make [In^-] = [HIn], that would be the point where the solution turns red.

Let me proceed with that.

So, [In^-] = [HIn].

So, substituting:

(0.10 V) / (0.05 + V) = (0.005 - 0.10 V) / (0.05 + V)

Wait, because [In^-] and [HIn] are both divided by the same total volume (0.05 + V), their ratios would be the same as their moles' ratios.

So, (0.10 V) = (0.005 - 0.10 V).

Solving for V:

0.10 V = 0.005 - 0.10 V.

Adding 0.10 V to both sides:

0.20 V = 0.005

V = 0.005 / 0.20 = 0.025 liters.

Wait, 0.025 liters is 25 ml. So the volume of NaOH needed is 25 ml.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 0.025 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 2.5e-5 L (0.000025 L)
B: 0.100 L
C: 5e-4 L
D:5e-6 L
E: 0.010 L
F: 0.050 L
G:1e-6 L
H:7.5e-5 L
I:1e-4 L
J:5e-5 L

So none of the options is 0.025 L. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the dilution properly. Let me re-examine the setup.

Alternative approach:

Let me assume that the initial solution is a certain concentration of HIn. Let's say [HIn]0 is the initial concentration.

The volume is 50 ml = 0.05 L.

When I add V liters of 0.10 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added are 0.10 V.

This NaOH will react with HIn in a 1:1 ratio, producing In^-.

So, after reaction, the moles of HIn are: initial moles - moles NaOH.

Initial moles of HIn: [HIn]0 * 0.05.

Moles after reaction: [HIn]0 * 0.05 - 0.10 V.

Moles of In^- formed: 0.10 V.

The total volume is now 0.05 + V liters.

So the concentrations are:

[HIn] = ([HIn]0 * 0.05 - 0.10 V) / (0.05 + V)

[In^-] = (0.10 V) / (0.05 + V)

We want the pH to be 9, so using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([In^-]/[HIn])

9 = 9 + log([In^-]/[HIn])

So log([In^-]/[HIn]) = 0 → [In^-]/[HIn] = 1 → [In^-] = [HIn]

Thus, substituting:

(0.10 V)/(0.05 + V) = ([HIn]0 * 0.05 - 0.10 V)/(0.05 + V)

Multiply both sides by (0.05 + V):

0.10 V = [HIn]0 * 0.05 - 0.10 V

Bring 0.10 V to the right:

0.20 V = [HIn]0 * 0.05

So, V = ([HIn]0 * 0.05) / 0.20 = [HIn]0 * 0.05 / 0.2 = [HIn]0 * 0.25.

But wait, I don't know [HIn]0. The problem doesn't specify the initial concentration of phenolphthalein. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the solution is using the K_w and the K_diss to find some relation.

Wait, K_diss is 1e-9. K_w is 1e-14.

Wait, perhaps if I think of the solution in terms of the pH and the dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is considering the buffer capacity and the point where In^- is present enough to make it red.

Wait, another approach: when you add NaOH to HIn, the OH- reacts with HIn to form In^-.

The reaction is HIn + OH- → In^- + H2O.

The equivalence point would be when all HIn is converted to In^-.

The volume needed to reach equivalence would be when moles of OH- added equal moles of HIn present.

So, initial moles of HIn = [HIn]0 * 0.05 L.

Moles of OH- needed = [HIn]0 * 0.05.

Volume of NaOH (0.10 M) needed: V = ([HIn]0 * 0.05) / 0.10 = [HIn]0 * 0.5.

But again, without knowing [HIn]0, I can't compute V.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration of HIn is such that when half of it is converted to In^-, the solution becomes red.

Wait, but without knowing [HIn]0, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem assumes that the solution is very dilute, and that the amount of NaOH added is small compared to the initial volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simplification where the concentration of HIn is 0.10 M, same as the NaOH. Let me try that.

Assume [HIn]0 = 0.10 M.

Then, initial moles HIn = 0.10 * 0.05 = 0.005 moles.

At equivalence point, V = 0.005 / 0.10 = 0.05 L (50 ml). So, option F is 0.050 L. But that's the equivalence point, which would make all HIn into In^-, but the solution might turn red before that.

But earlier, I thought that at half equivalence, when [In^-] = [HIn], the solution would be red, so V would be half of the equivalence volume.

So, V = 0.05 L / 2 = 0.025 L, which is
