Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the wavelength of a sound wave, specifically middle C. Hmm, I remember that middle C is a musical note, and its frequency is given as 256 Hz. Wait, yeah, the question says 256 sec^-1, which is the same as hertz. So the frequency f is 256 Hz.

The question is asking for the wavelength in air. I think I need to use the speed of sound in air to find the wavelength. Right, the formula that connects these is the wave equation: v = f * λ. Oh wait, v is the speed, f is frequency, and λ is wavelength. So if I rearrange that, λ = v / f.

But wait, what's the speed of sound in air? I remember it's something like 343 meters per second at room temperature, maybe 20 degrees Celsius. But wait, sometimes in problems, they use 340 m/s as an approximation. I think I should go with 340 m/s for this problem unless stated otherwise.

So plugging the numbers in: λ = 340 m/s divided by 256 Hz. Let me do that calculation. 340 divided by 256. Let me see, 256 times 1.3 is 332.8, which is close to 340. Wait, 256 * 1.328125 equals 340? Let me check: 256 * 1.3 = 332.8, and 256 * 0.028125 is about 7.2. So 332.8 +7.2 is 340. So λ is approximately 1.328125 meters.

Wait, but the options are in centimeters. So 1.328125 meters is 132.8125 centimeters. Oh wait, looking at the options, option B is 133 cm. That's really close. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I messed up the division. 340 divided by 256. Let me do it step by step. 256 goes into 340 once (256), subtracting leaves 84. Bring down a zero, making it 840. 256 goes into 840 three times (3 * 256 =768), subtracting gives 72. Bring down a zero: 720. 256 goes into 720 twice (512), leaving 208. Bring down zero: 2080. 256 * 8 is 2048, so 8 times. 2080-2048=32. Hmm, this is getting repetitive, but so far the division is 1.328125... So yeah, about 1.328 meters, which is 132.8 cm, so 133 cm when rounded. So option B is correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The formula is right, the speed of sound is 340, and the calculation checks out. So the answer should be B.

To determine the wavelength of middle C in air, we use the wave equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\]

Here:
- \(v\) is the speed of sound in air, approximately \(340 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(f\) is the frequency of middle C, given as \(256 \, \text{Hz}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{340}{256} \approx 1.328125 \, \text{meters}.
\]

Converting meters to centimeters (\(1 \, \text{meter} = 100 \, \text{centimeters}\)):

\[
\lambda \approx 132.8125 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the wavelength is approximately \(133 \, \text{cm}\). Among the given options, the closest match is:

**B: 133 cm.**
