Question:

What is meant when it is said that "the accelerator is asymmetric "?

Options:

A: The accelerator inversely affects the level of investment and capital creation
B: The accelerator is only operational during periods of economic boom
C: The acceleration principle applies only when the required capital for a certain level of output is greater than the available capital, but does not apply in the reverse situation
D: The accelerator is a term used to describe the fluctuating interest rates on capital loans
E: The acceleration principle applies only when the available capital for a certain level of output is greater than the required capital, but does not apply in the reverse situation
F: The accelerator affects only the service sector but not the manufacturing sector
G: The accelerator applies equally to capital surplus and deficit
H: The accelerator only applies when required capital is less than available capital
I: The accelerator applies to the rate of technological innovation in capital goods
J: The accelerator refers to the rate of capital depreciation

Okay, so I have this question about the accelerator being asymmetric. Hmm, I remember that the accelerator model is related to investment and capital in economics. The accelerator effect explains how changes in aggregate demand lead to changes in investment, which in turn affects the overall economy.

The question is asking what it means when the accelerator is asymmetric. I think the term "asymmetric" here refers to the accelerator's behavior not being the same in all situations. Like, maybe it works differently when things are going up versus when they're going down.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The accelerator inversely affects the level of investment and capital creation. Wait, I'm not sure about inverse. I thought the accelerator is about how increased output leads to more investment. So if output increases, investment increases, which would be a direct relationship, not inverse. So maybe A is not right.

Option B: The accelerator is only operational during booms. I don't think that's correct. The accelerator should work during both booms and recessions, just maybe asymmetrically. Like, it might amplify expansions and contractions, but not just during booms.

Option C: The acceleration applies only when required capital is greater than available, not the reverse. So if needed capital is more than available, the accelerator works, but if there's more capital than needed, it doesn't. That sounds like asymmetric because it behaves differently in opposite situations. So when there's a shortage, it's active, but when there's excess, it's inactive.

Option D: It's about fluctuating interest rates. No, the accelerator is more about the relationship between output and investment, not directly about interest rates.

Option E: The acceleration applies when available capital is greater than required, but not the reverse. Wait, that's the opposite of C. So E would mean when there's excess capital, the accelerator works, but when there's a shortage, it doesn't. Hmm, I'm not sure which is correct.

Option F: Only affects service sector. I don't think so. The accelerator is a general concept, not limited to a sector.

Option G: Applies equally to surplus and deficit. That would mean symmetric, so not asymmetric. So G is probably wrong.

Option H: Applies when required is less than available. That sounds similar to E, but I'm getting confused. Wait, H says it applies only when required is less than available. So if required capital is less than available, meaning there's more capital than needed, then the accelerator works. But in the opposite situation, when required is more, it doesn't? Or the other way around.

Wait, I think the accelerator works when there's a need for more capital. So when output increases, businesses need more capital, so they invest more. But if they have excess capital, maybe they don't decrease investment as much, leading to asymmetry.

So the accelerator might cause more investment when demand is rising but doesn't reduce investment as much when demand falls. So perhaps the effect is stronger in one direction than the other.

Looking back at the options, C says the principle applies when required capital is greater than available (so when you need more capital than you have), but doesn't apply when the reverse is true (when you have more than needed). So in that case, the accelerator only works in one direction, making it asymmetric.

So C would be the correct answer. E says the opposite, so it's incorrect.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another way to think: the standard accelerator model is symmetric, but in reality, it's asymmetric because businesses might not reduce capital as quickly during a downturn. So when demand is high, they build up capital, but when demand drops, they might hold onto excess capital rather than divest. So the accelerator would work when moving from low to high output but not as much when moving from high to low.

In terms of the options, that would mean the accelerator is active when required capital is greater than available (so during upswings), but inactive when available is greater (downswings). So option C is correct. Because when there's a shortage, businesses invest more, but when there's surplus, they don't disinvest as much.

So the answer should be C.

The accelerator effect in economics describes how changes in aggregate demand influence investment and, consequently, economic activity. When the accelerator is described as "asymmetric," it means that its behavior differs depending on the economic situationâ€”specifically, it behaves differently during periods of increasing demand versus decreasing demand.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests an inverse relationship between the accelerator and investment, which is incorrect because the accelerator typically has a direct relationship with investment.
- **Option B** claims the accelerator is only operational during booms, but this is inaccurate as the accelerator can operate during both booms and recessions, just asymmetrically.
- **Option C** states that the accelerator applies when required capital exceeds available capital but not in the reverse situation. This aligns with the concept of asymmetry, as the accelerator is more active during periods of capital shortages (e.g., when demand is rising) and less active during periods of capital surplus (e.g., when demand is falling).
- **Option D** refers to fluctuating interest rates, which is unrelated to the accelerator principle.
- **Option E** suggests the accelerator applies when available capital exceeds required capital, which is the opposite of asymmetry as described.
- **Option F** limits the accelerator to the service sector, which is incorrect as it applies broadly.
- **Option G** claims the accelerator applies equally to capital surplus and deficit, implying symmetry, which contradicts the concept of asymmetry.
- **Option H** is similar to E and does not correctly describe asymmetry.
- **Option I** and **Option J** are unrelated to the accelerator principle.

The correct interpretation is that the accelerator is asymmetric because it is more active when there is a need for additional capital (during upswings) and less active when there is excess capital (during downswings). This is best captured by **Option C**.
