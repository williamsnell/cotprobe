Okay, so I need to figure out what Hobbes meant by "animal motion." I remember that Hobbes was a philosopher, part of the social contract tradition, right? He wrote Leviathan, I think. His views were pretty mechanistic, I believe. He saw the world in terms of matter and motion, so maybe that applies here.

The question asks specifically about "animal motion." From what I recall, Hobbes was a materialist, so he probably didn't believe in anything beyond physical matter. So when he talks about motion, he's probably referring to physical movements rather than anything metaphysical.

Looking at the options:

A: Instinctive behavior like nursing young. Hmm, instinctive could be part of it, but I'm not sure if that's the primary meaning.

B: Irrational behavior. Wait, Hobbes might have thought humans have reason, but animals don't. But does "animal motion" refer to behavior being irrational, or just their physical movements?

C: Involuntary operations like heartbeat. That's more about physiology, but I'm not sure if that's what he meant by motion.

D: Physical actions and reactions of animals. This sounds plausible because Hobbes was into the physical aspects. Motion would relate to their movements and physical responses.

E: Human behavior driven by basic needs. No, the term is animal motion, so probably not just humans.

F: All non-human behavior. Maybe, but the term might be broader.

G: Moving from place to place. That's more like locomotion specifically, not the whole picture.

H: Driven by fear or survival. That's more about motivations, but the question is about the meaning of motion itself.

I: All voluntary behavior. But voluntary implies intention, which might not fit with Hobbes' mechanistic view.

J: Movement and behavior in the wild. That's more of an ecological description.

Wait, in Leviathan, Hobbes talks about humans as machines too, right? He believed in the idea of the mind as a series of motions caused by external stimuli leading to thoughts and actions. So for animals, their motions would be physical responses to stimuli—so their actions and reactions.

So looking back, option D says the physical actions and reactions of animals. That seems to fit because it's about their movements and responses, which are physical in nature.

Another thought: in the context of philosophy, when someone refers to motion, especially a materialist, they're talking about physical movement. So animal motion would be how animals move and react physically.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The term "animal motion" in Hobbes' philosophy refers to the physical actions and reactions of animals, reflecting his mechanistic view of the world where all phenomena, including living beings, can be explained through physical principles. 

Answer: D
