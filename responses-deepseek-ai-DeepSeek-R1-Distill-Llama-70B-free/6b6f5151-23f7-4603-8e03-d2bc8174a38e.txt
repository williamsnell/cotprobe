Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the tax rate for New City. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of calculations, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that New City has an annual budget of $4,221,890.49. Their property has a total assessed valuation of $150,781,803.21. And other estimated receipts are $385,000. I need to find the tax rate from the given options.

Wait, I remember that the tax rate is usually calculated based on the budget and the assessed value, but I think other revenues are subtracted first. So the formula must be something like (Budget - Other Receipts) divided by Assessed Valuation, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Let me write that down:

Tax Rate = [(Budget - Other Receipts) / Assessed Valuation] * 100

So plugging in the numbers:

Budget is $4,221,890.49
Other Receipts are $385,000.00
Assessed Valuation is $150,781,803.21

First, subtract the other receipts from the budget. Let me compute that:

4,221,890.49 minus 385,000.00 equals... Let me do the math. 4,221,890.49 minus 300,000 is 3,921,890.49. Then subtract 85,000 more. So 3,921,890.49 minus 85,000 is 3,836,890.49.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake there. Let me try again. 4,221,890.49 minus 385,000.00. 

Actually, 4,221,890.49 minus 385,000 is the same as 4,221,890.49 minus 300,000 minus 85,000. 4,221,890.49 minus 300k is 3,921,890.49. Then subtract 85k: 3,921,890.49 minus 85,000 equals 3,836,890.49. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, take that number and divide by the assessed valuation. So 3,836,890.49 divided by 150,781,803.21.

Hmm, maybe I should write that as a decimal. Let me compute that.

First, let me approximate to make it easier. Let's see, 3,836,890 is approximately 3.836 million, and 150.7818 million is the denominator.

So 3.836e6 / 150.7818e6 = 3.836 / 150.7818. Let me compute that.

Let me do the division: 3.836 ÷ 150.7818.

Well, 150 goes into 3.836 how many times? Since 150 times 0.025 is 3.75, because 150 * 0.02 is 3, and 150 * 0.005 is 0.75. So 3.75 is 150 * 0.025. Our numerator is 3.836, which is a bit more than 3.75. The difference is 0.086.

So 0.086 divided by 150 would be approximately 0.0005733. So total is approximately 0.025 + 0.0005733 = 0.0255733.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 150 * 0.025 is 3.75, and 150 * 0.0255733 would be 3.836, correct.

So the division result is approximately 0.0255733. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: approximately 2.55733%.

Looking at the options, let me check. The options are:

A: 2.24%
B: 3.24%
C: 4.54%
D: 1.84%
E: 3.84%
F: 1.54%
G: 2.54%
H: 2.84%
I: 1.24%
J: 3.54%

So my approximate calculation is 2.557%, which is about 2.56%. The closest option is G: 2.54% or H: 2.84%. Hmm, maybe I need to be more precise.

Wait, maybe I should do the calculation more accurately. Let's compute 3,836,890.49 / 150,781,803.21.

Let me write it as:

(3,836,890.49) / (150,781,803.21) = ?

Let me compute this more precisely.

I can set it up as 3,836,890.49 ÷ 150,781,803.21.

Alternatively, since both are in dollars, it's the same as 3.83689049e6 / 1.5078180321e8.

Which is 3.83689049 / 150.78180321.

Let me compute this division step by step.

First, 150.7818 goes into 383.689049 how many times?

Wait, 150.7818 * 2 = 301.5636

150.7818 * 2.5 = 376.9545

150.7818 * 2.55 = ?

Let me compute 2.55 * 150.7818.

2 * 150.7818 is 301.5636.

0.5 * 150.7818 is 75.3909.

0.05 * 150.7818 is 7.53909.

So 2.55 = 2 + 0.5 + 0.05.

So 301.5636 +75.3909 = 376.9545 +7.53909= 384.4936.

Wait, but our numerator is 383.689049.

So 2.55 times gives 384.4936, which is higher than 383.689049.

So let's try 2.54.

2.54 * 150.7818 = ?

Compute 2 *150.7818 is 301.5636.

0.5 *150.7818 =75.3909.

0.04 *150.7818=6.03127.

Adding up: 301.5636 +75.3909=376.9545 +6.03127=382.98577.

So 2.54 * 150.7818 = 382.98577.

Our numerator is 383.689049. So the difference is 383.689049 - 382.98577 = 0.703279.

So 0.703279 left. Now, how much more?

We can find how much 0.703279 is of 150.7818.

So 0.703279 /150.7818 = approximately 0.00466.

So total so far is 2.54 + 0.00466 ≈ 2.54466.

So approximately 2.5447.

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 254.47%.

Wait, no, wait. I think I messed up the decimal places. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the calculation I did was for 383.689049 divided by 150.78180321. So that's 2.54466.

Wait, but that would make the tax rate 2.54466%, which is approximately 2.54%. So that's option G: 2.54%.

Wait, but earlier I approximated as 2.557%, which is a bit higher. So maybe I should double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach more accurately.

Let me compute 3,836,890.49 divided by 150,781,803.21.

So 3,836,890.49 ÷ 150,781,803.21.

Let me do this division:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000 to simplify:

3,836.89049 ÷ 150,781.80321.

So 3836.89049 /150781.80321.

Wait, wait, that's 3,836,890.49 is 3836.89049 thousand.

Denominator is 150,781.80321 thousand.

So 3836.89049 /150,781.80321 = ?

Let me compute this as 3836.89049 ÷ 150,781.80321.

So let me write it as:

3836.89049 ÷ 150,781.80321 ≈ ?

Let me see, 150,781.80321 × 0.0254 = ?

Because 0.025 is 3,769.045075.

Wait, 150,781.80321 × 0.025 = 3,769.045075.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute 150,781.80321 × 0.025.

0.025 is 1/40, so 150,781.80321 ÷ 40 = ?

150,781.80321 ÷ 40 = approx 3,769.045075.

So 0.025 times 150 million is about 3,769,045. So our numerator is 3,836,890.49.

The difference is 3,836,890.49 - 3,769,045.08 = 67,845.41.

So 67,845.41 divided by 150,781,803.21 equals approximately 0.00045.

So total is 0.025 + 0.00045 = 0.02545, which is 2.545%.

So around 2.545%, which is approximately 2.54% or 2.55%. Looking back at the options, option G is 2.54% and option H is 2.84%.

Wait, but I thought 2.54% was the right calculation, which is option G.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I made an error in the initial step.

The formula is (Budget - Other Receipts) / Assessed Valuation.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So Budget is 4,221,890.49, minus 385,000 equals 3,836,890.49.

Yes, that's right.

So 3,836,890.49 divided by 150,781,803.21 equals approximately 0.02545, which is 2.545%.

Looking at the options, the closest is G: 2.54%.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 3,836,890.49 ÷ 150,781,803.21.

Well, 3,836,890.49 divided by 150,781,803.21.

Let me try this on a calculator step.

Alternatively, I can set it up as 3,836,890.49 / 150,781,803.21.

Dividing both by 1000: 3836.89049 / 150781.80321.

So 3836.89049 / 150781.80321 ≈ ?

Let me compute 150,781.80321 × 0.025 = 3,769.045075.

As before.

So 3,836.89049 - 3,769.045075 = 67.845415.

Now, 67.845415 / 150,781.80321 ≈ 0.00045.

So total is 0.025 + 0.00045 = 0.02545, which is 2.545%.

So again, 2.545%, which is approximately 2.54% or 2.55%.

Looking at the options, the closest is G:2.54% or H:2.84%.

Wait, but 2.545 is closer to 2.54% than 2.55%, but the options have G as 2.54 and H as 2.84. So 2.54% is correct.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe the initial numbers have more decimal points that affect the calculation.

Let me do the full calculation with more precision.

Compute 3,836,890.49 ÷ 150,781,803.21.

Let me write it as:

3,836,890.49 ÷ 150,781,803.21 = ?

Let me compute this using long division.

Approximating:

150,781,803.21 × 0.0254 = ?

Well, 150,781,803.21 × 0.02 = 3,015,636.0642

150,781,803.21 × 0.005 = 753,909.01605

150,781,803.21 × 0.0004 = 60,311.521284

Adding them up:

3,015,636.0642 +753,909.01605 = 3,769,545.08025 +60,311.521284= 3,829,856.60153.

So 0.0254 gives 3,829,856.60153.

But our numerator is 3,836,890.49, which is higher.

The difference is 3,836,890.49 -3,829,856.60153= 6,933.88847.

Now, how much is 6,933.88847 divided by 150,781,803.21?

That's 6,933.88847 /150,781,803.21 ≈ 0.000046.

So total tax rate is 0.0254 + 0.000046 = 0.025446, which is 2.5446%.

So approximately 2.5446%, which is 2.54% when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct answer would be G: 2.54%.

To calculate the tax rate for New City, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Budget} - \text{Other Receipts}}{\text{Assessed Valuation}} \right) \times 100
\]

### Given Data:
- **Budget**: $4,221,890.49  
- **Other Receipts**: $385,000  
- **Assessed Valuation**: $150,781,803.21  

### Step 1: Subtract Other Receipts from the Budget
\[
\text{Adjusted Budget} = 4,221,890.49 - 385,000 = 3,836,890.49
\]

### Step 2: Divide the Adjusted Budget by the Assessed Valuation
\[
\text{Tax Rate (in decimal)} = \frac{3,836,890.49}{150,781,803.21} \approx 0.02544
\]

### Step 3: Convert to Percentage
\[
\text{Tax Rate} = 0.02544 \times 100 \approx 2.544\%
\]

### Step 4: Match the Closest Option
The calculated tax rate of **2.544%** is closest to **2.54%**, which corresponds to **Option G**.

ANSWER: G
