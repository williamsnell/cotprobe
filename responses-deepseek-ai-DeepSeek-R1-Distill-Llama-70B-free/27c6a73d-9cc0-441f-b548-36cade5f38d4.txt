Options:

A: CO2 diffuses out of the leaf faster than H2O enters.

C: H2O exchanges with CO2 at equal rates.
D: CO2 diffuses out of the leaf slower than H2O enters.
E: H2O and CO2 do not exchange at all.
F: CO2 diffuses into the leaf faster than H2O exits.
G: There is no gas exchange under normal daytime conditions.
H: H2O diffuses out of the leaf slower than CO2 enters.
I: H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about stomata and gas exchange in plant leaves. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is: Under normal daytime conditions, what happens with the exchange of H2O and CO2 through the stomata? The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that stomata are pores on the surface of leaves. They're crucial for gas exchange—allowing CO2 to come in for photosynthesis and letting O2 (a byproduct) and water vapor out. But I'm a bit confused about the exact directions and rates.

Wait, during the day, plants undergo photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires CO2, so the plant takes in CO2 from the atmosphere through the stomata. At the same time, plants lose water vapor through transpiration, which happens mainly through the stomata as well. So water is exiting the leaf, and CO2 is entering.

Hmm, so in terms of movement, CO2 is coming into the leaf, and H2O is going out. But the question is about the rates. How do the rates of these two gases compare?

I think about the concentrations. The concentration of CO2 in the air is lower than that in the leaf for O2, but wait—no, actually, CO2 is being taken in, so the leaf's internal CO2 concentration must be lower than the atmosphere. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, during the day, the plant is using CO2 for photosynthesis, so the internal CO2 concentration is lower than the external. So CO2 diffuses into the leaf.

For H2O, the air outside is usually drier than the inside of the leaf, so water evaporates from the leaf cells and exits through the stomata. So H2O is moving out.

Now, the question is about the relative rates. Which moves faster? CO2 entering or H2O exiting?

I recall that water molecules are smaller and perhaps can diffuse faster than CO2. But wait, the stomata are the main pathway. But maybe the main point is about the direction, not the rate. But the question is about which diffuses faster.

Wait, another angle: during the day, when photosynthesis is active, the stomata are open to let CO2 in. But when they're open, both CO2 influx and water efflux happen. But the plant is losing more water relative to CO2 intake, which is why sometimes in dry conditions plants close stomata to conserve water, which in turn reduces CO2 intake and thus photosynthesis.

Wait, plants gain CO2 and lose H2O. So the movement is in opposite directions. So CO2 is entering, H2O is exiting. So the question is about the speed of these two processes.

Which one is faster? I think H2O evaporates and is lost much more rapidly than CO2 is absorbed. Because the concentration gradient for H2O is steeper—air is usually much drier than the leaf's internal environment. So H2O diffuses out faster than CO2 diffuses in.

Wait, but wait—another thought. The diffusion rate depends on the concentration gradient and the permeability. CO2 is entering because the plant needs it, but the movement rate might be slower because CO2 is a larger molecule compared to H2O. But wait, water is a smaller molecule, so it can move faster. So the rate of H2O exiting is higher than CO2 entering.

So looking at the options, I need to find which option says that H2O diffuses out faster than CO2 enters. Let's look at the options.

Option I says: H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters. That fits with what I was thinking.

Option H says H2O diffuses out slower than CO2 enters. That would be the opposite. So H is incorrect.

Option F: CO2 diffuses into the leaf faster than H2O exits. That's the opposite of I, so probably not.

Option D: CO2 diffuses out slower than H2O enters. Wait, no—CO2 is entering, H2O is exiting. So D is saying CO2 exits slowly, which isn't right because CO2 is entering, not exiting. So D doesn't fit.

So I think the correct answer is I.

Stomata are critical for gas exchange in plant leaves, allowing CO2 to enter for photosynthesis and H2O to exit through transpiration. Under normal daytime conditions, CO2 diffuses into the leaf to support photosynthesis, while H2O evaporates and diffuses out of the leaf. The rate of H2O exiting is faster than the rate of CO2 entering due to the steeper concentration gradient for H2O (the air is typically much drier than the leaf's internal environment) and the smaller size of water molecules, which allows for quicker diffusion.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I**: Correct. H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters, aligning with the explanation.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It states the opposite, that H2O diffuses out slower than CO2 enters.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It claims CO2 diffuses into the leaf faster than H2O exits, which is the reverse of what occurs.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It refers to CO2 diffusing out, which is not accurate since CO2 enters the leaf during the day.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.
