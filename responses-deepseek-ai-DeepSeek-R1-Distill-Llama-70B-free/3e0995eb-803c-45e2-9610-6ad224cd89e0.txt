Okay, so I've got this problem here about a man selling novelty items. I need to figure out how many items he must sell to break even and what his sales revenue would be at that point. Hmm, break-even point, right. I remember that's when the total revenue equals the total costs, so profit is zero.

Let me break down the information given. He sells each item for $1.25. His cost has two parts: a variable cost of $0.75 per item and a fixed cost of $140,000. So the total cost is variable costs plus fixed costs.

Wait, the formula for break-even point is usually where total revenue equals total costs. So TR = TC. 

Total Revenue (TR) is the price per unit times the number of units sold. So TR = 1.25 * Q, where Q is the quantity.

Total Cost (TC) is the fixed cost plus the variable cost per unit times Q. So TC = 140,000 + 0.75 * Q.

At break-even, TR = TC. So I can set up the equation:

1.25 Q = 140,000 + 0.75 Q.

I need to solve for Q. Let me subtract 0.75 Q from both sides to get the Q terms on one side.

1.25 Q - 0.75 Q = 140,000.

That simplifies to 0.5 Q = 140,000.

Now, divide both sides by 0.5 to solve for Q.

Q = 140,000 / 0.5.

Let me calculate that. 0.5 is the same as 1/2, so dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2. So 140,000 * 2 is 280,000. So Q is 280,000 units.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. 140,000 divided by 0.5 is definitely 280,000. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the second part is the sales revenue at that point. Revenue is price times quantity, so TR = 1.25 * 280,000. Let's compute that.

1.25 * 280,000. 1 times 280k is 280k, 0.25 times 280k is 70k. So 280k +70k = 350k. So the revenue would be $350,000.

Wait, let me make sure. 280,000 times 1.25. Another way to think: 1.25 is 5/4. So 280k multiplied by 5/4. 280k *5 is 1,400,000. Divided by 4 is 350,000. Yep, that's right.

Now looking back at the options, I need to find the option that says 280,000 units and $350,000 revenue.

Let me scan the options:

Option H is 280,000 units and $350,000. So that should be the correct choice.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let me quickly recalculate.

Break-even Q: (Fixed Cost)/(Price - Variable Cost) = 140,000 / (1.25 - 0.75) = 140,000 / 0.5 = 280,000. Correct.

Revenue is 1.25 * 280,000 = 350,000. Yep.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

To determine the break-even point, we set total revenue (TR) equal to total cost (TC). The formulas are:

- **TR** = Price × Quantity = $1.25 × Q  
- **TC** = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost × Quantity) = $140,000 + $0.75 × Q  

At the break-even point:  
\[
1.25Q = 140,000 + 0.75Q
\]  

Subtracting $0.75Q$ from both sides:  
\[
0.5Q = 140,000
\]  

Solving for \( Q \):  
\[
Q = \frac{140,000}{0.5} = 280,000 \, \text{units}
\]  

The sales revenue at this point is:  
\[
\text{Revenue} = 1.25 × 280,000 = 350,000
\]  

Thus, the man must sell **280,000 units**, and his sales revenue at that point will be **$350,000**. The correct answer is **H**.
