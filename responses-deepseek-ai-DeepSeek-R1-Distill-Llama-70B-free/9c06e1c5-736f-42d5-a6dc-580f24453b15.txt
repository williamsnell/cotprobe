Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to calculate the percentage difference between e^x and 1+x when x is 0.0050. Hmm, I remember that e^x can be approximated by a Taylor series, especially for small x. Let me think about that.

The Taylor series expansion of e^x around 0 is 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ... and so on. Since x is small here (0.005 seems small), maybe the higher-order terms beyond x² are negligible. So I can approximate e^x as 1 + x + x²/2.

Wait, but the question is comparing e^x to 1+x. So the difference between them would be e^x - (1+x), right? Which, using the approximation, would be (1 + x + x²/2) - (1 + x) = x²/2. So the difference is x squared over two.

But wait, the question asks for the percentage difference. Oh right, percentage difference is usually calculated as (difference / original value) * 100%. But wait, which original value do I use? Sometimes, people use the average of the two values, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes it's done relative to one of the values. In this case, perhaps the question is using (e^x - (1+x)) / (1+x) * 100% or maybe (e^x - (1+x))/(e^x) *100%. Or perhaps they take the absolute difference and divide by the average of the two. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. I need to think.

Wait, the problem says "percentage difference between e^x and 1+x". So the general formula for percentage difference between two quantities a and b is |(a - b)/b| * 100%, but sometimes it's |(a-b)| / ((a + b)/2) * 100%. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition here. Alternatively, perhaps it's simply |(e^x - (1+x))| / (1+x) * 100% because 1+x is the approximation, and we're seeing how much e^x differs from it, relative to 1+x.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the approximation error. Since e^x is approximated as 1+x, the error is e^x - (1+x), and the percentage error could be (error) / (1+x) *100. That makes sense because it's like saying what percentage error is made by using 1+x instead of e^x.

Let me proceed with that approach. So, e^x is approximately 1+x, and the actual value is e^x, so the error is e^x - (1+x) which is x²/2. So the percentage difference would be (x²/2) / (1+x) ) * 100%.

But since x is 0.005, which is small, maybe 1+x is approximately 1, so the denominator is about 1. So the percentage difference is approximately (x²/2) *100%. Let's calculate that.

x is 0.005, so x squared is 0.005^2 = 0.000025. Half of that is 0.0000125. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.0000125 * 100 = 0.00125, which is 1.25e-3 percent. Wait, no, 0.00125 is 0.125%, but wait, 0.0000125 *100 is 0.00125, which is 0.00125 *100 = 0.125%. Wait, wait, no, wait. 0.0000125 is 1.25e-5. Multiply by 100, that's 1.25e-3, which is 0.00125%. Wait, no, wait: 0.0000125 is 1.25e-5. So 1.25e-5 *100 is 1.25e-3, which is 0.00125 or 1.25e-3 percent.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 1.25e-3, which is 0.00125%. But wait, I thought the approximation was x²/2 divided by (1+x), which when x is 0.005, 1+x is 1.005. So perhaps I should be more precise and not approximate it as 1.

So let's compute it accurately. The error is e^x - (1+x) = x²/2 + higher terms. But maybe for x=0.005, the higher terms are negligible. So let's take error ≈ x²/2.

The percentage difference would be (x²/2) / (1+x) ) *100.

Plugging in x=0.005:

x squared is 0.005 * 0.005 = 0.000025.

Divide by 2: 0.0000125.

Divide by (1 + 0.005) = 1.005.

So 0.0000125 / 1.005 = ?

Let me compute that. 0.0000125 divided by 1.005.

Well, 1.005 is approximately 1, so 0.0000125 / 1.005 ≈ 0.0000125 * (1/1.005) ≈ 0.0000125 * 0.99502 ≈ 0.00001244.

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.00001244 *100 = 0.001244%, which is approximately 0.001244, which is 1.244e-3 percent.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.25e-3%, which is 0.00125%.

But wait, perhaps I should compute e^0.005 more accurately, not just rely on the approximation. Because the approximation e^x ≈1 +x +x²/2 may not capture all the terms, but perhaps for x=0.005, the x^3 term is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute e^0.005 accurately using a calculator.

Wait, but I don't have a calculator here. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using more terms of the Taylor series.

So e^x = 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + ... 

Let me compute each term up to x^4:

x = 0.005.

x^2 = 0.000025.

x^3 = 0.000000125.

x^4 = 0.000000000625.

So the terms are:

1: 1.

x: 0.005.

x²/2: 0.000025 / 2 = 0.0000125.

x^3/6: 0.000000125 /6 ≈ 0.0000000208333.

x^4/24: 0.000000000625 /24 ≈ 2.60416666667e-11.

So adding these up:

1 + 0.005 = 1.005.

+ 0.0000125 = 1.0050125.

+ 0.0000000208333 = 1.0050125208333.

The next term is 2.6e-11, which is negligible.

So e^0.005 ≈ 1.0050125208333.

Now, 1 + x is 1 + 0.005 = 1.005.

So the difference is e^x - (1+x) = 1.0050125208333 - 1.005 = 0.0000125208333.

So that's the exact difference using up to x^3 term.

Wait, but earlier approximation with x^2/2 is 0.0000125, which matches up to the 6th decimal place. So the difference is approximately 0.0000125208333.

Now, the percentage difference is (difference) / (1+x) *100%.

So 0.0000125208333 / 1.005 = ?

Let me compute that:

0.0000125208333 /1.005.

Well, 1.005 is 5/1000 more than 1, so 1/1.005 is approximately 0.995024876.

So 0.0000125208333 * 0.995024876 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.0000125208333 * 0.995024876.

Approximately, 0.0000125208333 * 1 is 0.0000125208333, so 0.0000125208333 *0.995 is about 0.00001244 (since 0.995 is 5/1000 less than 1).

So 0.00001244.

Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.001244%.

So approximately 0.001244%, which is 1.244e-3 %.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.25e-3 % which is 0.00125%. So maybe E is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another moment: perhaps the question is simply taking (e^x - (1+x))/ (1+x) *100, which is what I did. But let me make sure I'm not making any mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the percentage difference is calculated as |e^x - (1+x)| / |(e^x + 1+x)/2| *100%. But I think that's the formula when you're comparing two quantities without a reference. But in this case, since we're comparing the approximation (1+x) to the actual (e^x), the reference would be 1+x, so the percentage error is (error)/(1+x) *100.

So I'm confident that the correct approach is to compute (e^x - (1+x))/(1+x) *100%.

So using the accurate calculation, it's approximately 0.001244%, which is about 1.244e-3 percent. The closest option is E, which is 1.25e-3 percent.

Wait, but in the options, E is 1.25e-3%, which is 0.00125%. Our calculation is 0.001244%, which is very close. So the answer should be E.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact e^0.005 using a calculator, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the approximation.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the percentage difference is calculated differently, using (e^x - (1+x))/(e^x) *100%. Let me check what that would be.

So in that case, the percentage would be (0.0000125208333) / 1.0050125208333 *100%.

That's 0.0000125208333 / 1.0050125208333 = approximately 0.00001244.

Multiply by 100: 0.001244%, same as before. So same result.

Alternatively, if I compute it as (e^x - (1+x))/ ( (e^x + (1+x))/2 ) *100%, which is another formula for percentage difference.

So e^x is approximately 1.00501252, 1+x is 1.005. So the average is (1.00501252 + 1.005)/2 = (2.01001252)/2 = 1.00500626.

So the percentage difference is (0.0000125208333) / 1.00500626 *100% ≈ 0.0000125208333 / 1.00500626 ≈ 0.00001244, same as before. So same 0.001244%, which is 1.244e-3%.

So in any case, the closest option is E:1.25e-3%.

Looking back at the options:

E: 1.25e-3 %

Yes, that's the correct answer.

To calculate the percentage difference between \( e^x \) and \( 1+x \) for \( x = 0.0050 \), we start by approximating \( e^x \) using its Taylor series expansion:

\[
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots
\]

For small \( x \), higher-order terms (beyond \( x^2 \)) are negligible, so:

\[
e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2}.
\]

The difference between \( e^x \) and \( 1+x \) is:

\[
e^x - (1+x) \approx \frac{x^2}{2}.
\]

The percentage difference is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Reference Value}} \right) \times 100\%.
\]

Here, the reference value is \( 1+x \), so:

\[
\text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{\frac{x^2}{2}}{1+x} \right) \times 100\%.
\]

Substituting \( x = 0.005 \):

1. Compute \( x^2 \):
   \[
   x^2 = (0.005)^2 = 0.000025.
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{x^2}{2} \):
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{2} = \frac{0.000025}{2} = 0.0000125.
   \]

3. Compute \( 1+x \):
   \[
   1+x = 1+0.005 = 1.005.
   \]

4. Compute the percentage difference:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{0.0000125}{1.005} \right) \times 100\%.
   \]

   Dividing \( 0.0000125 \) by \( 1.005 \):
   \[
   \frac{0.0000125}{1.005} \approx 0.00001244.
   \]

   Multiplying by 100%:
   \[
   0.00001244 \times 100 = 0.001244\%.
   \]

Thus, the percentage difference is approximately \( 0.001244\% \), which is closest to \( 1.25 \times 10^{-3}\% \). 

The correct answer is:

**E: 1.25 \( 10^{-3} \% \)**
