Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the cost of some stock when the markup is a certain percentage. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the stock is worth $200,000 at retail, and the markup is 30% of the selling price. Wait, I need to find the cost, right?

Wait, markup can be a bit tricky because sometimes it's based on cost and sometimes on the selling price. Oh right, the problem specifies that the markup is 30% of the selling price. So that's important because it changes how I calculate things.

Let me think. So, if I remember correctly, the selling price (SP) is equal to the cost price (CP) plus the markup. But here, the markup is 30% of the SP, not the CP. So the formula would be: SP = CP + (Markup). Since the markup is 30% of SP, that would be 0.3 * SP.

So substituting that in, we get SP = CP + 0.3 SP. Wait, that seems a bit odd because SP is on both sides. Let me rearrange that equation. Subtract 0.3 SP from both sides: SP - 0.3 SP = CP. That simplifies to 0.7 SP = CP. So CP is 70% of the selling price.

Wait, the selling price given is $200,000. So if CP is 0.7 times SP, then CP = 0.7 * 200,000. Let me calculate that. 0.7 multiplied by 200,000 is 140,000. So the cost would be $140,000.

Looking at the options, option C is $140,000. So the answer should be C.

I think that's right. Let me just double-check. So if the cost is $140,000 and the markup is 30% of the selling price, what's the selling price? The markup is 0.3 * SP, so 0.3 * 200,000 is $60,000. So the cost plus markup is 140,000 + 60,000, which equals 200,000, matching the given SP. Yep, that makes sense.

To determine the cost of $200,000 worth of stock at retail when the markup is 30% of the selling price, we start by understanding the relationship between the selling price (SP), cost price (CP), and markup. 

The selling price is given as $200,000, and the markup is 30% of the selling price. This means:

\[
\text{Markup} = 0.3 \times \text{SP}
\]

The selling price can also be expressed as:

\[
\text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Markup}
\]

Substituting the expression for markup into the equation:

\[
\text{SP} = \text{CP} + 0.3 \times \text{SP}
\]

Rearranging to solve for CP:

\[
\text{SP} - 0.3 \times \text{SP} = \text{CP}
\]

\[
0.7 \times \text{SP} = \text{CP}
\]

Substituting the given SP of $200,000:

\[
\text{CP} = 0.7 \times 200,000 = 140,000
\]

Thus, the cost price is $140,000. This matches option C.
