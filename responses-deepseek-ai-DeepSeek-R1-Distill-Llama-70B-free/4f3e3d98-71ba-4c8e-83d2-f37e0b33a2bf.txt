Okay, so I've got this problem about the Nyquist criterion and sampling frequency. Hmm, I remember the Nyquist theorem is about determining the minimum sampling rate to accurately reconstruct a signal. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think this through.

The signal given is f(t) = 3sin(200πt) + 6sin(400πt) + sin(500πt). I think each sine term represents a frequency component. Oh right, the general form is sin(2πft), so the frequency f is the coefficient divided by 2π. Wait, in this case, the functions are sin(200πt), so the 200π must be the angular frequency, which is 2π times the actual frequency. So f = (angular frequency) / (2π).

Let me calculate each frequency component:

- For the first term, 200πt is the angular frequency. So f1 = 200π / (2π) = 100 Hz.
- Second term: 400πt → f2 = 400π/(2π) = 200 Hz.
- Third term: 500πt → f3 = 500π/(2π) = 250 Hz.

So the frequencies present in the signal are 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz.

The Nyquist criterion says that the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal. Otherwise, aliasing occurs, and the signal can't be accurately reconstructed.

So the highest frequency here is 250 Hz. The minimum sampling frequency (fs) is 2 * 250 Hz = 500 Hz.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh wait, the question asks for the sampling frequency in πHz. Hmm, what's πHz? Oh wait, that's just Hz multiplied by π, so the unit is a bit different. But wait, no, that can't be right. Because the units for angular frequency are in radians per second, which is π times Hz. So when the question says 'minimum sampling frequency in πHz', I think it's actually asking for the value when the sampling frequency is expressed in terms of π. Let me think.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a typo, and the intended unit is Hz. Because, the Nyquist rate is usually in Hz. Alternatively, if the options are in terms of πHz, then I need to adjust.

Wait, the options are given as numbers, like 550, 1000, etc. So perhaps the numbers are in Hz, but the question says πHz. Hmm, maybe I got confused.

Wait, the question states "minimum sampling frequency (in πHz)". So that's Hz multiplied by π. So for example, 500 Hz would be 500 * π πHz? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misprint and they mean to express the sampling frequency in terms of multiples of π. Or perhaps it's a mistake, and the correct unit is Hz.

Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back. The Nyquist rate is 2 times the highest frequency component in the signal. The highest here is 250 Hz, so Nyquist rate is 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz.

Looking at the options, option E is 500. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question asks for the minimum sampling frequency in πHz. So if the sampling frequency is 500 Hz, then in πHz units, it would be 500 / π πHz? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I got it wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually using the angular frequency as the measure. Because the signal is expressed in terms of πt. So perhaps the frequencies are already in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, no. Wait, in the expression sin(200πt), the coefficient is the angular frequency ω, which is 2πf. So ω = 200π, so f = ω / (2π) = 200π / (2π) = 100 Hz. So that's correct.

So the highest frequency is 250 Hz, so Nyquist is 500 Hz. So the minimum sampling frequency is 500 Hz, which is option E.

But wait, the options are given as numbers, without units except the question says in πHz. So perhaps the answer is 500 πHz. But 500 Hz is 500 Hz, which is 500/π πHz? No, that's not right. Because 1 Hz is (1/π) πHz. So if the Nyquist rate is 500 Hz, that's 500 * (π Hz) )? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the unit is a typo. Because the Nyquist rate is in Hz. So regardless, the numerical value is 500, which is option E.

So I think the correct answer is E: 500.

To determine the minimum sampling frequency satisfying the Nyquist criterion for the signal \( f(t) = 3\sin(200\pi t) + 6\sin(400\pi t) + \sin(500\pi t) \), we first identify the frequency components of the signal. Each sine term corresponds to a frequency, which can be calculated as:

- For \( \sin(200\pi t) \): \( f_1 = \frac{200\pi}{2\pi} = 100 \, \text{Hz} \),
- For \( \sin(400\pi t) \): \( f_2 = \frac{400\pi}{2\pi} = 200 \, \text{Hz} \),
- For \( \sin(500\pi t) \): \( f_3 = \frac{500\pi}{2\pi} = 250 \, \text{Hz} \).

The highest frequency present in the signal is \( 250 \, \text{Hz} \). According to the Nyquist criterion, the minimum sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency in the signal to avoid aliasing. Therefore, the minimum sampling frequency is:

\[
f_s = 2 \times 250 = 500 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

The question specifies the sampling frequency in \( \pi \, \text{Hz} \), but this appears to be a misprint since the Nyquist criterion is typically expressed in standard frequency units (Hz). Assuming the numerical value is what is required, the correct answer is \( 500 \, \text{Hz} \), which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: E
