Okay, so I've got this math problem here about BaskowToys Wholesalers and Albee Stores. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that BaskowToys is offering Albee Stores the Captain Kirk doll at 25-20% off the retail price. Wait, what does 25-20% off mean? Oh right, I think that's a trade discount series. So the first number is the first discount, and the second is the second discount. So it's like 25% off first, then 20% off the new price.

But wait, sometimes trade discounts are applied in a series, meaning you subtract each percentage one after the other. So the calculation would be the original price multiplied by (1 - first discount) and then by (1 - second discount). Or wait, maybe it's 25% off and then 20% off the reduced price? I think that's right.

So the formula would be: Retail Price × (1 - 0.25) × (1 - 0.20) = Cost Price. And the cost price here is $2.10, which is what Albee is paying per doll. But wait, the question is asking for the retail price, so I need to find that.

Let me write down the equation. Let R be the retail price. Then:

R × (1 - 0.25) × (1 - 0.20) = 2.10

Simplifying the discounts:

1 - 0.25 is 0.75, and 1 - 0.20 is 0.80. So:

R × 0.75 × 0.80 = 2.10

Let me calculate 0.75 × 0.80. 0.75 times 0.8 is 0.6. So R × 0.6 = 2.10.

To find R, I divide both sides by 0.6:

R = 2.10 / 0.6

Let me do that division. 2.1 divided by 0.6. Hmm, 0.6 × 3 is 1.8, and 0.6 × 3.5 is 2.1. So R is 3.5.

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. 0.6 times 3 is 1.8. 2.1 minus 1.8 is 0.3. 0.3 divided by 0.6 is 0.5. So 3 plus 0.5 is 3.5. Yep, so R is $3.50.

Looking at the options, option A is $3.50. So the answer should be A.

The problem involves calculating the retail price (R) of a Captain Kirk doll when it is sold at a series of discounts: 25% followed by 20%. The formula to find the cost price after discounts is:

\[
R \times (1 - 0.25) \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.10
\]

Simplifying the discounts:

\[
R \times 0.75 \times 0.80 = 2.10
\]

\[
R \times 0.6 = 2.10
\]

Solving for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{2.10}{0.6} = 3.50
\]

Thus, the retail price is **$3.50**, which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
