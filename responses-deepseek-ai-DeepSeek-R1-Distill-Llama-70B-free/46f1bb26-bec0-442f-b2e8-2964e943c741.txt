Okay, so I've got this problem about induction motors and synchronous speeds, slip, etc. Hmm, I remember that synchronous speed is an important concept here. Let me think.

The problem has four parts, a, b, c, d, each asking different calculations. I need to go through each one step by step.

Starting with part (a): Calculate the synchronous speed of an eight-pole induction motor when supplied with a 60-cycle source. Oh right, the formula for synchronous speed is n_sync = (120 * f) / p, where f is frequency and p is the number of poles. So f is 60 Hz here, p is 8. So 120 *60 = 7200, divided by 8 equals 900 rpm. Wait, but looking at the options, I see some options have 900 for part a, like option B and option H. So part (a) answer is 900 rpm.

Then part (b): four-pole motor, same frequency 60 cycles. So same formula, 120 *60 =7200, divided by 4 gives 1800 rpm. So part (b) is 1800 rpm. Now checking the options, for part (b), the correct ones should have 1800. Option H has 1800 for (b), and option D also has 1800 for (b). So possible options so far are H and D. Let me keep this in mind.

Part (c): the rotor speed is 960 rpm for a six-pole, 50-cycle motor. I need to find percent slip. The formula for slip is s = (n_sync - n_rotor)/n_sync * 100. First, calculate n_sync. Poles p=6, frequency f=50. So n_sync = (120 *50)/6. 120*50=6000, divided by 6 is 1000 rpm. So n_sync is 1000. Rotor speed is 960. So slip s is (1000-960)/1000 =40/1000=0.04, which is 4%. Wait, but looking at the options, part (c) in the options is the third number. So let's look at the options for part (c). Option H has 4 for part (c), which matches 4%. Option D has 3, which would be 3% slip. So if I'm right, part (c) should be 4%, so option H is looking good so far.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation. 120*50=6000/6=1000. 1000-960=40. 40/1000 is 0.04, which is 4%. Yep, correct.

Now part (d): 60-cycle, 14-pole motor, slip s is 0.05. Find the speed. So n = n_sync * (1 - s). First calculate n_sync. 120*60=7200/14. Let me compute that. 7200 divided by 14. 14 * 514 is 7186, because 14*500=7000, 14*14=196, so 7000+196=7196, which is 4 less than 7200. So 514.285... rpm. So about 514.2857 rpm. Now, slip is 0.05, so n = 514.2857 * (1 - 0.05) =514.2857 *0.95. Let me compute that. Let's see, 500 *0.95 is 475, 14.2857*0.95 is about 13.5714. So total is 475 +13.5714 â‰ˆ488.5714 rpm. Looking at the options, for part (d), the fourth number is the motor speed. So let's check the options:

Option H: the fourth number is 488. Option D's fourth number is 480. So with part (d) being approximately 488.57, which is closest to 488. So option H's part (d) is 488.

Putting it all together:

(a) 900 rpm (matches H and D)
(b) 1800 rpm (matches H and D)
(c) 4% (so H is correct)
(d) ~488 rpm (so H is correct)

Looking at the options:

Option H is: 900, 1800,4,488.

So the correct choice is option H.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### (a) Synchronous Speed of an 8-Pole Motor (60 Hz)
The synchronous speed is calculated using the formula:

\[
n_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot f}{p}
\]

Here, \( f = 60 \, \text{Hz} \) and \( p = 8 \). Substituting:

\[
n_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot 60}{8} = \frac{7200}{8} = 900 \, \text{rpm}
\]

Thus, the synchronous speed is **900 rpm**.

---

### (b) Synchronous Speed of a 4-Pole Motor (60 Hz)
Using the same formula:

\[
n_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot 60}{4} = \frac{7200}{4} = 1800 \, \text{rpm}
\]

Thus, the synchronous speed is **1800 rpm**.

---

### (c) Percent Slip of a 6-Pole Motor (50 Hz, Rotor Speed = 960 rpm)
First, calculate the synchronous speed:

\[
n_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot 50}{6} = \frac{6000}{6} = 1000 \, \text{rpm}
\]

The percent slip is given by:

\[
s = \frac{n_{\text{sync}} - n_{\text{rotor}}}{n_{\text{sync}}} \cdot 100
\]

Substituting \( n_{\text{sync}} = 1000 \, \text{rpm} \) and \( n_{\text{rotor}} = 960 \, \text{rpm} \):

\[
s = \frac{1000 - 960}{1000} \cdot 100 = \frac{40}{1000} \cdot 100 = 4\%
\]

Thus, the percent slip is **4%**.

---

### (d) Speed of a 14-Pole Motor (60 Hz, Slip \( s = 0.05 \))
First, calculate the synchronous speed:

\[
n_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot 60}{14} = \frac{7200}{14} \approx 514.29 \, \text{rpm}
\]

The rotor speed is:

\[
n = n_{\text{sync}} \cdot (1 - s)
\]

Substituting \( n_{\text{sync}} \approx 514.29 \, \text{rpm} \) and \( s = 0.05 \):

\[
n = 514.29 \cdot (1 - 0.05) = 514.29 \cdot 0.95 \approx 488.57 \, \text{rpm}
\]

Thus, the rotor speed is approximately **488 rpm**.

---

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- (a) 900 rpm
- (b) 1800 rpm
- (c) 4%
- (d) 488 rpm

The correct option is **H: 900, 1800, 4, 488**.
