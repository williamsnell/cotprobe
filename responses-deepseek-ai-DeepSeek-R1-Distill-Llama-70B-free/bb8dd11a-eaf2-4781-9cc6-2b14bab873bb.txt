Okay, so I've got this question about cycads, and I'm a bit rusty on my botany, but let's try to work through it. The question is asking about an unusual feature that makes cycads remarkable among seed plants.

First, I remember that cycads are a group of plants that have been around since the time of the dinosaurs. They're often referred to as living fossils. But what's so unusual about them? Let me think about what I know about their characteristics.

I know that cycads are gymnosperms, which means they have seeds but don't produce flowers like angiosperms do. They do have cones, though. Wait, but that's not unique because other gymnosperms like pines and cedars also have cones.

Oh, right! Cycads have something to do with their reproduction. I think it's about how they produce their gametes. In most plants, especially seed plants, the sperm are not motile. They usually rely on the pollen tube to deliver them to the egg. But wait, cycads are different. I remember something about them having motile sperm. So maybe they produce sperm that can swim, which is unusual in seed plants.

Let me think again. Seed plants, or spermatophytes, include gymnosperms and angiosperms. In angiosperms, the pollen tube delivers non-motile sperm. Gymnosperms also typically have non-motile sperm because they rely on the pollen tube as well. But cycads, which are gymnosperms, are an exception. They have motile sperm that use flagella to move towards the egg. This is more similar to what happens in ferns and mosses, which are not seed plants. So this would be an unusual feature because it's not common among seed plants.

Looking at the options now. Let me go through each one:

A: They have flowers that bloom for several years before producing seeds. No, cycads don't have flowers. They have cones, so this is wrong.

B: Unique leaf structure. I think some cycads do have interesting leaves, like being pinnate, but I'm not sure if that's the most unusual feature. Plus, other plants have unique leaves too.

C: Survive in extremely cold climates. I thought cycads are more tropical or subtropical, so probably not.

D: Produce large seeds. Yeah, cycads do have large seeds, but I'm not sure if that's the key feature here. Maybe, but I think the sperm thing is more unique.

E: Seeds remain dormant for a century. I don't recall that being a trait of cycads specifically. Maybe some other plants have that.

F: Move leaves towards the sun. That's phototropism, which many plants do, like sunflowers. Not unusual.

G: Motile sperm within pollen tubes. This rings a bell. So yes, they produce sperm that can swim, which is rare in seed plants.

H: Photosynthesize at night. That's something like CAM plants, such as cacti, but not cycads specifically.

I: True secondary growth like trees. Some cycads can get pretty big, but I'm not sure if they have secondary growth similar to woody trees. Maybe, but I don't think that's the point here.

J: Asexual reproduction only. No, cycads reproduce sexually with seeds, so this is incorrect.

So the answer should be G: They form motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes.

The unusual feature of cycads that makes them remarkable among seed plants is their ability to form motile, swimming sperm within their pollen tubes. This is unique because most seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) have non-motile sperm that rely on the pollen tube for delivery. Cycads, however, exhibit a primitive reproductive mechanism more akin to non-seed plants like ferns, where sperm are flagellated and capable of movement. This characteristic sets cycads apart as a distinctive group among seed plants.
