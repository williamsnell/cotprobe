Okay, so I have this problem here about a publisher's breakeven point. Hmm, I remember that breakeven is when the total revenue equals the total costs, right? So the point where the business neither makes a profit nor a loss. 

Alright, let me break this down. The publisher has fixed daily costs of $300. Fixed costs are expenses that don't change with the number of units produced or sold, like rent or salaries. So that's straightforward.

Now, the books sell for $1.00 each. So the selling price per unit is $1. But wait, the cost per book is 75 cents. Oh, right, that's the variable cost. Variable costs change with the number of units produced. So for each book sold, it costs the publisher 75 cents to produce it.

I think the formula for breakeven is where total revenue equals total costs. Total revenue is the selling price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold. Total costs are the sum of fixed costs and variable costs. So the formula should look something like this:

Breakeven Point (in units) = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)

Oh wait, right, because the contribution margin is the selling price minus variable cost. So each unit sold contributes that amount to covering the fixed costs.

Let me plug in the numbers. Fixed costs are $300. Selling price is $1.00, which is $1. Variable cost per book is $0.75.

Wait, let me make sure the units are correct. Fixed costs are in dollars, and the per-unit values are in dollars too. So that's consistent.

So the calculation would be:

Breakeven = $300 / ($1.00 - $0.75) = $300 / $0.25

What's 300 divided by 0.25? Hmm, 0.25 is a quarter, so how many quarters are in 300 dollars? Well, 1 dollar has 4 quarters, so 300 * 4 = 1200. So 300 / 0.25 equals 1200.

So that means the breakeven point is 1200 books. Let me check the options. Option A is 1,200 books. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check the math to be sure. Fixed costs are 300. Each book gives a contribution of 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 dollars. So to get 300, you divide 300 by 0.25. 300 divided by 0.25 is indeed 1200. Yep, that seems right.

Another way to think about it: For each book, after covering the variable cost, the publisher makes $0.25. So how many $0.25 contributions do you need to cover $300? 300 / 0.25 is 1200. That makes sense.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is A: 1,200 books.

The breakeven point is calculated by dividing the fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit. The fixed costs are $300, and the contribution margin per unit is the selling price ($1.00) minus the variable cost ($0.75), which equals $0.25. Dividing $300 by $0.25 gives 1,200 units. 

Thus, the breakeven point is 1,200 books.
