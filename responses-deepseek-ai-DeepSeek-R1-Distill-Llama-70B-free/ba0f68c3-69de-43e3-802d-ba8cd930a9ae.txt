Question:

A researcher grows a population of ferns in her laboratory. She notices, after a few generations, a new variant that has a distinct phenotype. When she tries to breed the original phenotype with the new one, no offspring are produced. When she breeds the new variants, however, offspring that look like the new variant result. Which of the following is likely to exhibit the process described earlier?

Options:

A: Goldfish
B: Spotted toads
C: Dalmatians
D: Grass
E: Orchids
F: Wheat
G: Garden snails
H: Fruit flies
I: Fallow deer
J: House cats

Okay, so I have this biology question here about ferns and some changes in their population. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a researcher is growing ferns in her lab. After a few generations, a new variant appears with a distinct phenotype. When she tries to breed the original with the new variant, there's no offspring. But when she breeds the new variants together, they produce offspring that look like the new variant.

Hmm, so I remember that when two organisms can't produce viable offspring, that's a sign of reproductive isolation. Reproductive isolation can lead to the formation of new species because the two groups can no longer interbreed. So this sounds like speciation is happening here.

Wait, the question is asking which of the options is likely to exhibit this process. The process described is likely a type of speciation. Specifically, when a new species emerges either through geographic or other isolating mechanisms.

In the case of the ferns, the original and new variants can't interbreed, so they must be separate species now. The new variant can only reproduce within themselves, which suggests that they've undergone some kind of speciation.

I think the key here is that the new variant is a different species. So we're looking for an example of a species that can undergo a similar process, probably via a mechanism like polyploidy, which is common in plants.

Polyploidy is when a plant has more than two sets of chromosomes. This can happen through errors in cell division. If a fern, say, undergoes polyploidy, the new plants can't mate successfully with the original diploid ones because their chromosomes don't pair up correctly during reproduction. So they end up being a new species.

Now, looking at the options, which of these are plants where polyploidy is a common occurrence? Let's go through them:

A: Goldfish – They are animals, and polyploidy is less common in animals. Also, I don't recall goldfish being an example for this kind of speciation.
B: Spotted toads – Again, animals. Same reasoning as above.
C: Dalmatians – Dogs. Not relevant here.
D: Grass – Grass is a plant. Many grass species have undergone polyploidy. Wheat and grasses are known for it.
E: Orchids – Some orchids are polyploid, but I'm not sure if they're the best fit here.
F: Wheat – Yes, wheat is a classic example. Bread wheat is hexaploid, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes. It can't interbreed with its diploid ancestors, so it's a separate species.
G: Garden snails – Animals, so probably not.
H: Fruit flies – Animals. They can speciate through other means, but polyploidy is rare.
I: Fallow deer – Animals again.
J: House cats – Also animals.

So the options narrow down to plants, specifically D (Grass) and F (Wheat), and maybe E (Orchids). But the most classic example I remember is wheat. Bread wheat is allohexaploid, formed from the hybridization of different grass species. This leads to reproductive isolation from the parent species.

Wait, the question says the new variant can't breed with the original. If wheat is the result of hybridization between different species, then maybe it's a case of allopolyploidy. In this case, the new species (wheat) can't interbreed with either parent species, which fits the scenario.

Alternatively, the original scenario could involve autopolyploidy, where a single species produces a polyploid. For example, if a diploid fern becomes tetraploid, it can't breed with diploids. So when the researcher tries to cross original (diploid) with the new (tetraploid), they can't produce viable spores or offspring. But when the new variants (tetraploid) are crossed with each other, they produce viable tetraploid offspring.

So the question is essentially describing speciation via polyploidy. Which plant among the options is known for this? Wheat is a strong candidate.

Looking back, the options are D: Grass and F: Wheat. Wheat is a type of grass, so both are possible. But wheat is more commonly cited as an example. For example, Triticale is a man-made hybrid of wheat and rye, which is hexaploid, but that's a human intervention.

Wait, but the question is about a natural process. So perhaps the example is wheat itself, which is a natural allopolyploid. Alternatively, another example could be grasses that have become polyploid.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F: Wheat.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In the given scenario, the original and new variant can't interbreed, but the new variant can breed among themselves. That's exactly what happens in polyploidy. So the correct example would be a plant species that can form polyploid individuals which then become a new species.

So which of the options is a plant? A lot are, but D and F are. Let me think of specific examples. I remember that some grasses like wheat, oats, and others are polyploid.

Wait, another approach: which of the options is a plant that can produce fertile offspring when mated with itself, but not with the original. Wheat is a good example because it's hexaploid and can't interbreed with diploid ancestors.

Alternatively, some ferns themselves undergo this, but the question is about which option fits.

So, of the options, F: Wheat is probably the correct answer.
</think>

The question describes a scenario where a new variant of ferns emerges and becomes reproductively isolated from the original population, producing no offspring when crossed with the original phenotype. However, the new variants can breed among themselves, resulting in viable offspring. This process is indicative of speciation, likely through a mechanism such as polyploidy, where a plant ends up with more than two sets of chromosomes. Polyploidy is a common mechanism of speciation in plants, as it leads to reproductive isolation from the original species.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Goldfish**, **B: Spotted toads**, **C: Dalmatians**, **G: Garden snails**, **H: Fruit flies**, **I: Fallow deer**, **J: House cats**: These are all animals, and polyploidy is rare in animals. Thus, they are unlikely to exhibit the described process.
- **D: Grass**: Grasses are plants, and some species are polyploid. However, wheat is a more classic and commonly cited example of polyploidy.
- **E: Orchids**: While some orchids are polyploid, they are not as widely recognized for this process as wheat.
- **F: Wheat**: Wheat is a well-known example of speciation via polyploidy. Bread wheat, for instance, is hexaploid (having six sets of chromosomes) and cannot interbreed with its diploid ancestors, making it a separate species. This aligns with the scenario described in the question.

Given that wheat is a classic example of speciation through polyploidy and fits the described process, the correct answer is:

**F: Wheat**

Answer: F
