Okay, so I have this problem about the maximum pressure exerted on an aircraft flying at 200 mph at sea level. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when an object moves through a fluid, like air, there's something called dynamic pressure involved. Oh right, Bernoulli's equation! I think that's what I need to use here.

So Bernoulli's principle relates the pressure, velocity, and height in a flowing fluid. The equation is usually written as p + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant. But since the question is about the maximum pressure, I guess we're looking at the point where the velocity is lowest because pressure and velocity are inversely related according to Bernoulli. Wait, wait, no, actually, the maximum pressure would occur where the velocity is lowest, right? Because when velocity decreases, pressure increases.

Wait, but wait another thing. At sea level, the altitude is zero, so the ρgh term might be negligible here. So the equation simplifies to p + ½ρv² = p_0, where p_0 is the static pressure. Oh, wait, no. Let me think again. When the aircraft is moving, the dynamic pressure is ½ρv². The total pressure would be the sum of static and dynamic pressure.

Wait, no, Bernoulli's equation says p_static + dynamic_pressure = p_total. So the maximum pressure exerted on the aircraft would be the static pressure plus the dynamic pressure. Because when the airflow is brought to a standstill, like at a stagnation point, the pressure is highest. So maximum pressure is p_0 + ½ρv².

Wait, but wait, the aircraft is moving, so the air is moving around it. The static pressure is p_0, which is 14.7 psi. The dynamic pressure is the ½ρv² term. So the maximum pressure would be p_0 plus the dynamic pressure.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The static pressure is the pressure when the fluid is not moving, while the dynamic pressure is due to the motion of the fluid. So at a stagnation point, the velocity is zero, and all the dynamic pressure is converted into pressure. So the total pressure is p_static + dynamic_pressure.

So the formula would be p_total = p_0 + ½ρv².

Yes, that makes sense. So I need to calculate ½ρv² and add that to p_0.

Given values: velocity v is 200 mph. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. The density rho is given in slug per cubic foot, and pressure is in psi. So I need to convert mph to feet per second.

How do I convert 200 mph to ft/s? I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So,

200 mph = 200 * 5280 ft / 3600 sec.

Let me calculate that. 200 * 5280 = 1,056,000. Divided by 3600: 1,056,000 / 3600 = 293.333... ft/s.

So v ≈ 293.333 ft/s.

Now plug into the dynamic pressure formula: ½ * rho * v².

Rho is 0.00238 slug/ft³.

So ½ * 0.00238 * (293.333)^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate v squared: 293.333^2.

Let me approximate 293.333 as 293.333. 293^2 is 85849. So 293.333^2 ≈ 85849 + (0.333^2 + 2*293*0.333). Wait, maybe it's easier to just compute 293.333 * 293.333.

293.333 * 293 = let's see, 293 * 293 = (300-7)^2 = 90000 - 2*300*7 + 7² = 90000 - 4200 +49= 85849.

But since it's 293.333, we can compute more accurately.

Alternatively, I'll use calculator-like steps:

293.333 * 293.333 = (293 + 1/3)^2 = 293^2 + 2*293*(1/3) + (1/3)^2 = 85849 + (586/3) + 1/9 ≈ 85849 + 195.333 + 0.111 ≈ 86044.444.

Wait, that's approximately 86044.444 ft²/s².

So ½ * rho * v² = 0.5 * 0.00238 * 86044.444.

Compute 0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119.

Multiply that by 86044.444.

So 0.00119 * 86044.444 ≈ let's compute 86044.444 * 0.001 =86.044444, then 0.00019 *86044.444.

0.0001 *86044.444=8.6044444. So 0.00019 is 0.0001 + 0.00009. So 8.6044444 + 0.00009*86044.444.

0.00009 *86044.444 ≈ 7.744. So total is 8.6044 +7.744=16.3484.

So the dynamic pressure is 86.044444 + 16.3484 ≈ 102.3928 psi? Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than the static pressure of 14.7 psi.

Wait that can't be right, because 200 mph is not that fast. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me recheck the units. The density is 0.00238 slugs per cubic foot. Velocity in ft/s. So ½ rho v² gives units of (slug/ft³)(ft²/s²) )= slug/(ft s²) * ft² → slug*ft/(s²). Hmm, but pressure in psi is lb per square inch. So I think there's a unit conversion missing here because the formula ½ rho v² gives the dynamic pressure in pound-force per square foot (psf), which needs to be converted to psi.

Oh wait, right! Because 1 slug is 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So to get pressure in lb/ft², or psf, then to convert to psi, which is lb/in², I need to divide by 144 (since 1 ft²=144 in²).

Wait no, let's think again. The dynamic pressure in psf is ½ rho v², but to get it in psi, which is per square inch, you have to adjust the units.

Wait, let me start over. The formula for dynamic pressure is q = ½ rho v². The units of rho is slug/ft³, velocity is ft/s. So:

rho (slug/ft³) * v² (ft²/s²) = (slug*ft)/(ft³ s²) )= slug/(ft² s²). 

Now, 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft, so:

slug/(ft² s²) )= (lb·s²/ft)/(ft² s²) )= lb/(ft³).

Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I should remember that 1 lb = 32.174 lb·ft/s² * slug, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, so let's compute the dynamic pressure correctly.

So q = ½ rho v² = (0.5)(0.00238 slug/ft³)(293.333 ft/s)^2.

Compute that:

0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119.

(293.333)^2 = 86044.444.

Multiply 0.00119 *86044.444 = let's compute 86044.444 * 0.001 =86.044444, and 0.00019*86044.444=16.348444.

So 86.044 +16.348= 102.392 lb/ft² (since 0.00119 *86044.444 is in lb/ft²?) Wait, no, because the units depend on rho and v.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the units. Let me think about it again.

So, 1 slug is equal to 1 lb·s²/ft. So rho is in slugs/ft³.

So, rho v² has units (slug/ft³)(ft²/s²) )= slug/(ft s²).

slug is lb·s²/ft, so substituting:

slug/(ft s²) = (lb·s²/ft)/(ft s²) )= lb/(ft²).

So, ½ rho v² is in lb/ft², which is psf (pounds per square foot).

So, to convert psf to psi, we divide by 144, since 1 ft² =144 in².

So, q = (0.5 * rho * v²) in psf = 102.392 lb/ft².

Convert to psi: 102.392 /144 ≈ ?

Let me compute 102.392 /144.

Well, 144 * 0.7 =100.8. So 0.7 psi is 100.8 lb/ft². Wait, no, 144 lb/ft² is 1 psi. So 102.392 lb/ft² is 102.392 /144 = approximately 0.710 psi.

Wait, that makes sense. So the dynamic pressure is about 0.71 psi.

So the maximum pressure is p_0 + dynamic pressure. p_0 is 14.7 psi.

14.7 + 0.71 = 15.41 psi.

Looking at the options, option E is 15.42 psia, which is very close. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the unit conversions.

Wait, another approach: Alternatively, maybe I can compute ½ rho v² in psi directly.

Given that rho is 0.00238 slug/ft³, and v is 293.333 ft/s.

Compute ½ * 0.00238 * (293.333)^2.

As before, ½ *0.00238 = 0.00119.

(293.333)^2 = approx 86044.44.

So 0.00119 *86044.44 = 0.00119 * 86044.44.

Let me compute 86044.44 * 0.001 =86.0444.

Then 86044.44 * 0.00019 = let's compute 0.0001 *86044.44=8.604444, and 0.00009 *86044.44=7.744.

So 8.604444 +7.744=16.348444.

So 86.0444 +16.348444=102.3928 lb/ft².

Convert that to psi: 102.3928 /144 = approx 0.7106 psi.

Adding to p_0:14.7 + 0.7106≈15.4106 psi, which rounds to 15.41, matching option E (15.42psia). Close enough considering rounding during calculations.

So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the maximum pressure exerted on an aircraft flying at 200 mph at sea level, we use Bernoulli's principle. The maximum pressure occurs at the stagnation point, where the total pressure is the sum of the static pressure (\(p_0\)) and the dynamic pressure (\(q = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2\)).

### Given Data:
- \(p_0 = 14.7 \, \text{psi}\)
- \(\rho = 0.00238 \, \text{slug/ft}^3\)
- Velocity (\(v\)) = 200 mph

### Step 1: Convert velocity to consistent units
Convert \(v\) from mph to ft/s:
\[
v = 200 \, \text{mph} \times \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{1 \, \text{mile}} \times \frac{1 \, \text{hour}}{3600 \, \text{seconds}} = 293.333 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate dynamic pressure
The dynamic pressure is given by:
\[
q = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2.
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
q = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.00238 \, \text{slug/ft}^3 \times (293.333 \, \text{ft/s})^2.
\]
First, calculate \(v^2\):
\[
v^2 = (293.333)^2 \approx 86044.444 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]
Now calculate \(q\):
\[
q = 0.5 \times 0.00238 \times 86044.444 \approx 102.392 \, \text{lb/ft}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Convert dynamic pressure to psi
Since \(1 \, \text{ft}^2 = 144 \, \text{in}^2\), divide by 144 to convert to psi:
\[
q \approx \frac{102.392}{144} \approx 0.710 \, \text{psi}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total pressure
The total pressure is the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_0 + q = 14.7 + 0.710 \approx 15.41 \, \text{psia}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The maximum pressure exerted on the aircraft is approximately **15.42 psia**, which corresponds to option **E**.
