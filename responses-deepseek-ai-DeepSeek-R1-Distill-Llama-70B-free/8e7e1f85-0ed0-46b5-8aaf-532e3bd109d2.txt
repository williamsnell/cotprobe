Okay, so I've got this problem here about Weiser Inc. offering a discount on dinette tables. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

The question says there's a discount of $21.90, and the discount rate is 12 and a half percent. Wait, 12(1/2)%, which I think is 12.5%. So I need to find both the list price and the net price of the tables. The options are given from A to J, each with different list and net prices.

Hmm, I remember that when something is discounted, the discount amount is calculated based on the list price. So the formula I think is something like:

Discount = List Price × (Discount Rate)

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the discount rate is the percentage, so in decimal that's 0.125 because 12.5% is 12.5/100 which is 0.125.

So if the discount is $21.90, that equals the list price multiplied by 0.125. So I can rearrange the formula to find the list price. 

List Price = Discount / Discount Rate

Putting in the numbers I have:

List Price = 21.90 / 0.125

Let me calculate that. 21.90 divided by 0.125. Hmm, 0.125 is 1/8, so dividing by 1/8 is the same as multiplying by 8. So 21.90 × 8 equals... let's see, 20×8 is 160, and 1.90×8 is 15.20, so 160+15.20 is 175.20. Oh wait, that gives me the list price as $175.20.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has list price $175.20. So that's one part.

Now, the net price is the list price minus the discount. So Net Price = List Price - Discount.

So that's 175.20 minus 21.90, which is 153.30. So the net price is $153.30.

Looking back at the options, option A says List price: $175.20 and Net price: $153.30. So that matches.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to be sure. Let me recalculate the list price.

21.90 divided by 0.125. So, 0.125 is 1/8, so 21.90 * 8. Let me do 21.90 * 8. 20 *8 is 160, 1.9 *8 is 15.2, so adding gives 175.20. Correct.

Then net price is 175.20 - 21.90. Let's subtract: 175.20 minus 20 is 155.20. Then subtract 1.90 more: 155.20 -1.90 is 153.30. Yep, that's right.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves calculating the list price and net price of dinette tables given a discount of $21.90 and a discount rate of 12.5%. 

First, the list price is determined using the formula:

\[
\text{List Price} = \frac{\text{Discount}}{\text{Discount Rate}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{List Price} = \frac{21.90}{0.125} = 175.20
\]

Next, the net price is calculated as:

\[
\text{Net Price} = \text{List Price} - \text{Discount}
\]

\[
\text{Net Price} = 175.20 - 21.90 = 153.30
\]

Comparing these results with the provided options, option A matches with a list price of $175.20 and a net price of $153.30.

Answer: A
