Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the voltage of a cell under non-standard conditions. Hmm, I remember that when concentrations aren't standard, the Nernst equation comes into play. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says the cell has an E° of 1.1 volts. Wait, but wait a second. I think E° is the standard cell potential when all the concentrations are at 1 M and everything's at standard conditions, right? But here, the copper half-cell is at standard conditions, which I guess means 1 M concentration for Cu^2+? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me read the question again.

Oh, wait, the copper half-cell is at standard conditions, so I think that means [Cu^2+] is 1 M. But the zinc ion concentration is only 0.001 M. Oh, right, so the Zn^2+ is at 0.001 M. And the reaction is Zn + Cu^2+ → Cu + Zn^2+. So that's the overall reaction.

I remember that the cell potential can be calculated using the Nernst equation, which is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q. Or wait, sometimes it's written with log instead of ln, like E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q at 25°C. Oh yeah, because at 25°C, which is 298 K, the conversion factor becomes approximately 0.0592 V per log unit.

So first, I need to figure out what the reaction quotient Q is. The reaction is Zn(s) + Cu^2+ (aq) → Cu(s) + Zn^2+ (aq). Since solids don't contribute to Q, Q should be [Zn^2+]/[Cu^2+]. Because the products are Zn²+ and Cu(s), and reactants are Cu²+ and Zn(s).

Wait, so in the reaction, the concentrations that matter are those of the ions. So for the cell reaction, the expression is E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode, right? Oh wait, no, maybe I should first determine the standard cell potential correctly, but the problem already gives E° as 1.1 V, so maybe I don't need to calculate that part.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should double-check if the given E° is correct based on the standard reduction potentials. Let me think. The standard reduction for Cu²+ + 2e^- → Cu(s) is about +0.34 V, and for Zn²+ + 2e^- → Zn(s) is about -0.76 V. So the cell potential E°cell would be E°cathode - E°anode. The cathode is where reduction happens, so Cu²+ is being reduced to Cu. The anode is where oxidation happens, so Zn is oxidized to Zn²+. So E°cell = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 1.10 V. Oh, that matches the given E°, so that's correct.

Now, since the concentrations aren't standard, I have to use the Nernst equation. So E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q. Wait, but wait, another version is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q at 25°C. Or is it (0.0592/n) times log Q, depending on whether the reaction is spontaneous? Let me make sure I get the sign right.

Wait, the Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q. But at 25°C, with R, T, F values, it's approximately E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q. But wait, another way to write it is E = E° + (0.0592/n) log ( [products]/[reactants] ), but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, the correct form is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q, where Q is [products]/[reactants]. Wait, no, the general form is E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q. But wait, another way to think about it is that for the cell reaction as written, if the reaction is written as reduction, then the Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q.

Alternatively, the cell potential can be calculated using E = E°cell - (0.0592/n) log Q, where Q is [Zn²+]/[Cu²+] because the reaction is Zn + Cu²+ → Cu + Zn²+.

Wait, so in the cell, the anode is Zn being oxidized to Zn²+, and the cathode is Cu²+ being reduced to Cu. So the cell reaction is Zn(s) + Cu²+ (aq) → Zn²+ (aq) + Cu(s).

So the reaction quotient Q is [Zn²+]/[Cu²+] because the products are Zn²+ and the reactants are Cu²+. So when concentrations are 1 M, Q is 1, and E = E°, which is 1.1 V as given.

But in this problem, [Cu²+] is 1 M (since it's at standard conditions), and [Zn²+] is 0.001 M. So Q = (0.001) / (1) = 0.001.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The Nernst equation for the cell is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q. So n is the number of electrons transferred. In this reaction, Zn goes from 0 to +2, so 2 electrons are transferred. So n=2.

So plugging in the numbers: E = 1.1 V - (0.0592/2) * log (0.001).

Wait, what's log(0.001)? That's log(10^-3), which is -3. So log Q is -3.

So E = 1.1 - (0.0296) * (-3). Because 0.0592 divided by 2 is approximately 0.0296.

So 0.0296 multiplied by (-3) is -0.0888. So subtracting that (because it's minus a negative) would be adding 0.0888.

So E = 1.1 + 0.0888 = 1.1888 volts. Hmm, that's approximately 1.19 volts.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.19 V. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute (0.0592/2)*log(Q). Q is 0.001, so log is -3. So 0.0296 * (-3) is -0.0888. So E = 1.1 - (-0.0888) = 1.1 + 0.0888 = 1.1888 V, which rounds to 1.19 V. So yes, option C.

To calculate the voltage (E) of the cell under non-standard conditions, the Nernst equation is used:

\[
E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q
\]

Here:
- \( E^\circ = 1.1 \, \text{V} \) (standard cell potential),
- \( n = 2 \) (number of electrons transferred, as zinc is oxidized from 0 to +2),
- \( Q = \frac{[\text{Zn}^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]} \), where \([\text{Zn}^{2+}] = 0.001 \, \text{M}\) and \([\text{Cu}^{2+}] = 1 \, \text{M}\) (standard condition for Cu).

### Step 1: Calculate \( Q \)
\[
Q = \frac{[\text{Zn}^{2+}]}{[\text{Cu}^{2+}]} = \frac{0.001}{1} = 0.001
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\log Q\)
\[
\log(0.001) = \log(10^{-3}) = -3
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into the Nernst equation
\[
E = 1.1 - \frac{0.0592}{2} \cdot (-3)
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{0.0592}{2}\):
\[
\frac{0.0592}{2} = 0.0296
\]

Then multiply by \(-3\):
\[
0.0296 \cdot (-3) = -0.0888
\]

Since the equation subtracts this value:
\[
E = 1.1 - (-0.0888) = 1.1 + 0.0888 = 1.1888 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 4: Round the result
\[
E \approx 1.19 \, \text{V}
\]

### Final Answer:
The voltage of the cell under the given conditions is approximately **1.19 volts**, which corresponds to option **C**.
