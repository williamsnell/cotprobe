Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Morris wanting to buy an MGB convertible. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says that the dealer quoted a price of £3500. Mr. Morris has a budget of $7500. There are two parts to the question. Part a asks if he can afford the car at an exchange rate of £1 = $2.20. Part b is about finding the exchange rate at which he can just afford it.

Let me start with part a. So, if I convert £3500 to dollars using the given rate. The exchange rate is pounds to dollars, so for each pound, he gets 2.20 dollars. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you're converting pounds to dollars, the exchange rate is how many dollars you get for one pound. So, to find out how many dollars £3500 is, I multiply 3500 by 2.20.

Let me calculate that. 3500 times 2.20. Let's see, 3500 * 2 is 7000, and 3500 * 0.20 is 700. So together that's 7700 dollars. Oh wait, but Mr. Morris only has $7500. So 7700 is more than 7500. That means he can't afford it at this exchange rate. So the answer to part a is no, he cannot afford the car.

Now, part b asks, what exchange rate would make the car affordable for him? So we need to find the exchange rate (let's call it ER) where £3500 equals exactly $7500. Because that's the maximum he's willing to spend.

So the equation would be: 3500 * ER = 7500. We can solve for ER by dividing both sides by 3500. So ER = 7500 / 3500. Let's compute that. 3500 goes into 7500 twice (3500*2=7000), with 500 left. 500 divided by 3500 is 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857. So 2 + 0.142857 is about 2.142857 dollars per pound.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because when the exchange rate goes up, each pound is worth more dollars. So if the exchange rate is higher than the current rate, the pounds are stronger, meaning each pound buys more dollars. Wait, but in this case, a higher exchange rate (more dollars per pound) would make the car more expensive in dollars. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, because if the pound is stronger, it's more valuable. So when you exchange pounds to dollars, more dollars per pound would mean the car is more expensive in dollars. But Mr. Morris wants the car to be cheaper in dollars so he can afford it.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify. Let's think: if ER increases, each pound is worth more dollars. So £3500 would cost more in dollars. Because, for example, at ER=2, £3500 is 7000. At ER=3, it's 10,500. So higher ER makes the price in dollars higher. So, for Mr. Morris to afford it, the ER needs to be lower than the current rate. Because a lower ER would make the car cheaper in dollars.

Wait, but the question is, he can't afford it at ER=2.20 because it's 7700. He needs the total to be 7500. So the required ER is 7500 / 3500, which is approximately 2.142857. Wait, no, that can't be, because 2.142857 is less than 2.20? No, wait, 2.1428 is less than 2.20. Wait, no, 2.1428 is less than 2.20? Wait 2.1428 is about 2.14, which is less than 2.20. So wait, if the exchange rate is 2.14, then the car would cost 3500 * 2.14 = 7500, which is exactly his budget.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me write this step by step.

We have:

£3500 = $X

We need X to be ≤ $7500.

So,

X = 3500 * ER ≤ 7500

Therefore,

ER ≤ 7500 / 3500

Calculate 7500 /3500.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 75/35.

75 divided by 35 is 15/7, because 75 is 15*5, 35 is 5*7. So 15/7 is approximately 2.142857.

So ER must be ≤ approximately 2.14286.

So the exchange rate needs to be at or below about 2.14286 for the car to cost exactly 7500. So if the current exchange rate is 2.20, which is higher than 2.14286, then the car is more expensive than he can afford.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because if the exchange rate is higher (more dollars per pound), then each pound is worth more, so the car's price in dollars would be higher. So to make the car's price in dollars lower, the exchange rate (dollars per pound) needs to be lower. So he needs the exchange rate to be lower than 2.20, specifically at or below 2.14286. 

Wait, but in the calculation, 7500/3500 is exactly 2.142857. So the exchange rate must be 2.142857 or lower for him to afford the car. So the question is, what must the exchange rate be for him to buy the car. So the exchange rate needs to be at 2.142857 or lower. 

But looking at the options, let's see. The options for part b are about what the exchange rate must be for him to buy. So in part a, he can't afford it because at 2.20, it's 7700. In part b, the required rate is 2.142857. So looking at the options, let's see.

Looking at the options, part a is that he can't afford, so any option where part a is 'cannot afford' is possible. 

Looking at the options:

Option I: He cannot afford; the pound must be $2.14.

Wait, let me list all options:

A: Cannot; pound must be $1.50

B: Can afford; must be $1.80

C: Can afford; must be $2.50

D: Can afford; must be $1.60

E: Cannot; must be $1.90

F: Cannot; must be $3.00

G: Can afford; must be $2.40

H: Can; must be $2.00

I: Cannot; must be $2.14

J: Cannot; must be $2.00

Wait, but our calculation for part b is that the exchange rate must be 2.142857. So that's approximately 2.14. So option I says that he can't afford, and the pound must be $2.14. So that fits.

Wait, but wait, the exchange rate is in pounds to dollars, so the question is phrased as "how low must the exchange rate be". Because a lower exchange rate would make the car cheaper in dollars. So the required exchange rate is 2.14, which is lower than the current 2.20. So the pound must weaken to that rate. 

So in the options, part a is whether he can afford at 2.20. He can't because 3500*2.20=7700>7500. So part a is 'cannot afford'. Then part b is the required rate is 2.14.

Looking at the options, the correct one would have part a as cannot afford, part b as 2.14. Option I matches that: I says cannot afford, pound must be $2.14.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option I says he cannot afford; the pound must be $2.14. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option I.

To determine whether Mr. Morris can afford the MGB convertible, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Part (a): Can Mr. Morris afford the car at an exchange rate of £1 = $2.20?
The car is priced at £3500. Using the exchange rate of £1 = $2.20, the cost in dollars is:

\[
\text{Cost in dollars} = 3500 \times 2.20 = 7700
\]

Mr. Morris has a budget of $7500. Since $7700 > $7500, he cannot afford the car at this exchange rate.

### Part (b): What exchange rate is required for Mr. Morris to afford the car?
To afford the car, the total cost in dollars must equal or be less than $7500. Let the required exchange rate be \( ER \). Then:

\[
3500 \times ER \leq 7500
\]

Solving for \( ER \):

\[
ER \leq \frac{7500}{3500} = 2.142857
\]

Thus, the exchange rate must be at or below approximately $2.14 for Mr. Morris to afford the car.

### Evaluating the Options:
- **Part (a):** Mr. Morris cannot afford the car at £1 = $2.20.
- **Part (b):** The required exchange rate is approximately $2.14.

The correct option is **I: He cannot afford the car; the pound must be $2.14**.
