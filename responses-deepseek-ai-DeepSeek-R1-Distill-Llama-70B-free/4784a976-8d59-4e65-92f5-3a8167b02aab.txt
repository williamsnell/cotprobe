Okay, so I've got this problem here about prime factors and figuring out which number must be a factor of the given number. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that the prime factors of a number are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. So, the number in question is the product of these primes. That means if I multiply them all together, I'll get the number. But I don't need to calculate the actual number, just figure out which of the options is a factor.

The options are A through H, each being a different number. I need to see which of these numbers can divide the original number without leaving a remainder. 

Let me recall that if a number is a factor of another, all of its prime factors must be included in the prime factors of the original number. So, I should check each option to see if their prime factors are a subset of the given primes.

Let's list the options and their prime factors:

A: 10. Prime factors are 2 and 5. Both are present in the given list, so 10 is a possible factor.

B: 25. Prime factors are 5 and 5 (since 25=5²). But the given primes only include one 5, so 25 might not be a factor. Wait, no, the given number has 5 as a prime factor, but does it include 5²? Because the given factors are just the primes; the number could have each prime only once. So if the original number is 2^1 *5^1 *7^1 *13^1 *31^1, then 25 (5^2) isn't a factor. So B is out.

C:6. Its prime factors are 2 and 3. Oh wait, the given primes don't include 3, so 6 can't be a factor. So C is not possible.

D:8. It's 2^3. The given number has 2^1. So 8 requires three 2s, but we only have one. So D isn't a factor.

E:15. Factors are 3 and 5. Again, 3 isn't in the given primes, so E is not a factor.

F:30. Let's break it down. 30 is 2 *3 *5. But 3 isn't a factor of the original number, so 30 can't be a factor either. So F is out.

G:20. 20 is 2^2 *5. The original number has 2^1 and 5^1. So 20 requires two 2s, but we only have one. So G is not a factor.

H:4. 4 is 2^2. Again, the original only has one 2, so 4 isn't a factor. So H is out.

Wait, so the only option that works is A:10, because both 2 and 5 are present, each at least once. So the correct answer must be A.

The number in question has prime factors 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. To determine which of the given options must be a factor, we check if the prime factors of each option are a subset of the given prime factors.

- **A: 10**  
  Prime factors: 2, 5. Both are present in the given list. Therefore, 10 is a factor.  

- **B: 25**  
  Prime factors: 5, 5 (5²). The given number only includes one 5, so 25 is not a factor.  

- **C: 6**  
  Prime factors: 2, 3. The given list does not include 3, so 6 is not a factor.  

- **D: 8**  
  Prime factors: 2, 2, 2 (2³). The given number only includes one 2, so 8 is not a factor.  

- **E: 15**  
  Prime factors: 3, 5. The given list does not include 3, so 15 is not a factor.  

- **F: 30**  
  Prime factors: 2, 3, 5. The given list does not include 3, so 30 is not a factor.  

- **G: 20**  
  Prime factors: 2, 2, 5 (2², 5). The given number only includes one 2, so 20 is not a factor.  

- **H: 4**  
  Prime factors: 2, 2 (2²). The given number only includes one 2, so 4 is not a factor.  

The only option that works is **A: 10**, as both 2 and 5 are present in the given prime factors.  

Answer: A
