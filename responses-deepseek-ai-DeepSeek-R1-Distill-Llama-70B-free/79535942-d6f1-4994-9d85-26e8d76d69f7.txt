Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It says: For how many positive integral values of x ≤ 100 is 3^x − x² divisible by 5? And then there are multiple-choice options. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that if something is divisible by 5, that means when you divide it by 5, there's no remainder. So, 3^x − x² ≡ 0 mod 5. Which can be rewritten as 3^x ≡ x² mod 5. So for each x, I need to check if 3^x mod 5 equals x² mod 5.

I think I should find patterns or cycles for both 3^x mod 5 and x² mod 5. Let's start with 3^x mod 5. I remember that powers of 3 mod 5 cycle in a pattern. Let's calculate:

3^1 = 3 mod5 →3
3^2=9→4
3^3=27→2 (since 25 is 0, 27-25=2)
3^4=81→1 (because 80 is 16*5=80, so 81 mod5=1)
3^5=3^4 *3=1*3=3 →3 again
So the cycle repeats every 4. So the exponents cycle every 4. So the pattern is 3,4,2,1,3,4,2,1,...

Now for x squared mod5. Let's see the possible squares mod5. Since x can be 0 to 4 mod5, let's compute each:

0²=0 →0 mod5
1²=1 →1
2²=4 →4
3²=9 →4 (since 9-5=4)
4²=16 →1 (16-15=1)

So the possible squares mod5 are 0,1,4.

Wait, but x can be any positive integer, so x mod5 can be 0,1,2,3,4. So x² mod5 is 0,1,4,4,1 respectively.

So x² mod5 is either 0,1, or 4.

Now, the problem is to find when 3^x ≡ x² mod5.

So for each x, check if 3^x mod5 equals x squared mod5.

But since x can be up to 100, I need a way to calculate this without checking each x. Let's find a pattern.

Let me consider x in terms of mod4 for 3^x, since the cycle is every 4. So 3^x mod5 depends on x mod4.

So let me make a table for x mod4 and the corresponding 3^x mod5:

x mod4 | 3^x mod5
0      |1
1      |3
2      |4
3      |2

So, depending on x mod4, 3^x is 1,3,4,2.

Now, for x² mod5, as earlier, it's 0,1,4.

So I need to find for each x, whether 3^x mod5 equals x² mod5.

Let me approach this by considering x's residues mod4 and mod5, but perhaps it's easier to break it down.

Wait, since 3^x mod5 repeats every 4, let's consider x in terms of mod4. Then for each x, based on mod4, 3^x mod5 is known. Then, for x² mod5, I can find it based on x mod5.

Wait, perhaps it's better to group x based on their mod20, since 4 and 5 are coprime, so the combined cycle length is 20. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can try to find for each x mod20, but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible x mod4, and x mod5, find when 3^x ≡x² mod5.

Wait, but x mod4 and x mod5 can be considered together because 4 and 5 are coprime, so x mod20 determines both. So perhaps we can find for each x mod20, whether the condition holds. Then, since 100 is 5*20, we can multiply the count per 20 by 5.

Let me try that approach.

So first, let's find all x in 1 to 20 that satisfy 3^x ≡x² mod5. Then, since the pattern repeats every 20, the total number up to 100 would be 5 times the count in each 20.

Wait, but does the condition really have a period of 20? Let's check.

3^x mod5 has a period of 4, as we saw earlier. x² mod5 depends on x mod5, which cycles every 5. So the combined period would be the least common multiple of 4 and 5, which is 20. So yes, the condition should repeat every 20 numbers.

So let's find how many x in 1-20 satisfy 3^x ≡x² mod5.

Let me make a table of x from 1 to 20, compute 3^x mod5 and x² mod5, and see when they are equal.

But that might take a while, but perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, for each possible residue r of x mod4, let's find x mod5 such that 3^x ≡x² mod5.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to loop through x from 1 to 20, but let's try to do it systematically.

Let me create a table for x from 1 to 20.

But perhaps I can find a pattern based on x mod4 and x mod5.

Wait, perhaps for each x mod4 (0,1,2,3), and for each x mod5 (0,1,2,3,4), find if 3^x ≡x² mod5.

Wait, but since 3^x mod5 depends on x mod4, and x² mod5 depends on x mod5, perhaps for each combination of x mod4 and x mod5, we can find if the condition holds.

But because x mod4 and x mod5 are independent, perhaps for each possible x mod4 and x mod5, we can see if 3^x ≡ x² mod5.

So for each possible a in 0,1,2,3 (x mod4), and each possible b in 0,1,2,3,4 (x mod5), we can see if 3^a ≡ (b)^2 mod5.

Wait, no. Because 3^x mod5 is determined by x mod4, and x^2 mod5 is determined by x mod5. So for each x, 3^x mod5 = [3^{x mod4} mod5], and x^2 mod5 = (x mod5)^2 mod5.

Wait, but 3^x mod5 is determined by x mod4, yes, because 3^4 ≡1 mod5, so 3^{4k + r} = (3^4)^k * 3^r ≡ 1^k *3^r mod5 →3^r mod5. So yes, depends on x mod4.

So, to rephrase, for each x, 3^x mod5 is equal to 3^{x mod4} mod5, but we have to be careful with x mod4 being 0, which would correspond to 3^4 ≡1 mod5.

So, 3^x mod5 is as follows based on x mod4:

x mod4 | 3^x mod5
0 → 1
1 →3
2 →4
3 →2

Now, x mod5 can be 0,1,2,3,4. So for each x, if x ≡a mod4 and x ≡b mod5, then 3^x mod5 is the value from the table above, and x² mod5 is (b)^2 mod5.

We need 3^x mod5 == x² mod5 → 3^{a} mod5 == (b)^2 mod5.

So, perhaps the best way is to find all pairs (a,b) where a is 0,1,2,3 and b is 0,1,2,3,4, and 3^a mod5 equals (b)^2 mod5.

Wait, but x must satisfy both x ≡a mod4 and x≡b mod5. So for each a and b, if 3^a ≡ b² mod5, then any x that ≡a mod4 and ≡b mod5 will satisfy the condition.

So let's find all such (a, b) pairs.

Let me make a table:

For each a from 0 to 3 (x mod4), compute 3^a mod5.

a | 3^a mod5
0 →1
1 →3
2 →4
3 →2

Now, for each a, find all b (0-4) such that b² ≡3^a mod5.

So for each a, check which b satisfy b² ≡ value.

Let me compute for each a:

a=0: 3^a=1 mod5. So we need b where b² ≡1 mod5.

Looking at squares mod5: 0²=0,1²=1,2²=4,3²=4,4²=1.

So b can be 1 or 4. Because 1²=1, 4²=1.

So for a=0, b can be 1 or 4. So x ≡0 mod4 and x ≡1 or 4 mod5 will satisfy the condition.

a=1: 3^a=3 mod5. So we need b where b² ≡3 mod5.

Looking at squares mod5, possible squares are 0,1,4. None of them equal 3. So no solutions for a=1.

a=2: 3^a=4 mod5. So we need b where b² ≡4 mod5.

Which b's satisfy this? Let's see:

b=2: 2²=4 → yes.

b=3: 3²=9≡4 mod5 → yes.

So for a=2, b can be 2 or 3.

a=3: 3^a=2 mod5. So we need b where b² ≡2 mod5.

Looking at squares mod5 again: 0,1,4. None equal 2, so no solutions.

So the possible (a,b) pairs are:

a=0, b=1

a=0, b=4

a=2, b=2

a=2, b=3

So now, for each of these (a, b) pairs, we can find x such that x ≡a mod4 and x≡b mod5.

Since 4 and 5 are coprime, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each pair (a, b) corresponds to a unique solution mod20.

So for each of these four (a,b) pairs, there's a unique x mod20 that satisfies both congruences.

Let me find the x mod20 for each pair.

First pair: a=0, b=1.

x ≡0 mod4 →x=4k.

x ≡1 mod5 →4k ≡1 mod5. Let's solve for k.

4k ≡1 mod5 → multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. The inverse of 4 mod5 is 4, since 4*4=16≡1 mod5.

So k ≡4*1 ≡4 mod5 →k=5m +4.

So x=4*(5m +4)=20m +16.

So x ≡16 mod20.

Second pair: a=0, b=4.

x ≡0 mod4.

x ≡4 mod5.

So x=4k.

4k ≡4 mod5 →k ≡1 mod5 (since 4k mod5=4 →k= (4 mod5)/4 → since 4 and 5 are coprime, 4 has inverse 4 again. So 4k≡4 →k≡1 mod5).

So k=5m +1.

x=4*(5m +1)=20m +4.

So x≡4 mod20.

Third pair: a=2, b=2.

x ≡2 mod4.

x ≡2 mod5.

Find x ≡2 mod4 and x≡2 mod5.

We can write x=4k+2.

Then, 4k+2 ≡2 mod5 →4k ≡0 mod5 →k≡0 mod5, since 4 and 5 are coprime.

So k=5m →x=4*(5m) +2=20m +2.

So x≡2 mod20.

Fourth pair: a=2, b=3.

x≡2 mod4 and x≡3 mod5.

x=4k+2.

4k+2 ≡3 mod5 →4k ≡1 mod5.

As before, 4k ≡1 mod5 →k≡4 mod5.

So k=5m+4 →x=4*(5m+4)+2=20m +16 +2=20m +18.

So x≡18 mod20.

So the four solutions mod20 are x≡2,4,16,18 mod20.

So in each 20 numbers, these four residues satisfy the condition.

Therefore, in each block of 20 numbers (like 1-20, 21-40, etc.), there are 4 numbers that satisfy the condition.

Now, since x is up to 100, which is 5 blocks of 20 (20*5=100). So the total number of solutions would be 4*5=20.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if x=0 is included. But the problem says positive integers, so x starts at 1. So x=0 isn't considered.

Wait, but in our mod20 solutions, some residues are 2,4,16,18, which are all within 1-20, so 20 is included as x=20. Wait, does x=20 satisfy the condition?

Let me check x=20.

3^20 mod5: since 3^4≡1 →3^20=(3^4)^5 ≡1^5=1 mod5.

x²=20²=400 →400 mod5=0.

So 1 ≡0 mod5? No, that's not true. So 1 is not equal to 0 mod5. So x=20 does not satisfy the condition.

Wait, that's a problem. Because earlier, when a=0, b=4, we found x≡4 mod20 as a solution. Let's test x=4.

3^4 mod5=81 mod5=1.

x²=16 mod5=1. So 1≡1: yes, correct. So x=4 works.

x=20: 3^20 mod5=1, x²=400 mod5=0. So 1≡0? No. So x=20 doesn't work.

Wait, that's confusing. Because according to our earlier approach, x≡4 mod20 includes x=4,24,44,64,84,104, etc. But x=24: let's check.

x=24: 3^24 mod5: 3^24=(3^4)^6 →1^6=1 mod5.

x²=24²=576 →576 mod5 is 576 - 5*115=576-575=1 →1 mod5. So 1≡1: yes.

So x=24 works. But x=20: 3^20= (3^4)^5=1^5=1 mod5. x²=400 mod5=0. So 1≡0: no. So x=20 doesn't work.

Wait, so our earlier assumption that each x≡4 mod20 would work is correct, except for x=20. Hmm. So what's wrong here?

Ah, because when we set x≡0 mod4 and x≡4 mod5, the solution is x≡4 mod20. So x=4,24,44,64,84, etc., all satisfy x≡4 mod20, and for those x, 3^x mod5 is 3^{x mod4}=3^0=1, and x² mod5 is (4)^2=16 mod5=1. So 1≡1, which works. But wait, in x=20, x=20 mod4 is 0, x mod5 is 0. So x=20 is x≡0 mod4 and x≡0 mod5, which would correspond to a different (a,b) pair, but in our earlier analysis, only (a=0,b=1) and (a=0,b=4) are considered, but (a=0, b=0) is not a solution because 3^0=1, and b²=0. So 1≡0? No, so x=20 is not a solution. So in our solution set, x=4,24,44,64,84 are all within x≤100, and these are 5 numbers. But earlier, when I thought each 20 numbers contribute 4 solutions, but perhaps for x=100, which is 5*20, maybe it's included or not.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, thinking that each 20-number block contributes 4 solutions, but in reality, x=20 doesn't satisfy, so in the first 20, x=4, 2,16,18: that's four numbers. Let me check each:

x=2:

3^2=9 mod5=4.

x²=4 mod5=4. So 4≡4: yes.

x=4: 3^4=81 mod5=1, x²=16 mod5=1: yes.

x=16: 3^16 mod5: since 16 mod4=0, so 3^16 mod5=1.

x=16 mod5=1. So x²=1 mod5=1. So 1≡1: yes.

x=18: 3^18 mod5: 18 mod4=2 →3^2=4 mod5.

x=18 mod5=3. So x²=9 mod5=4. So 4≡4: yes.

So yes, in 1-20, x=2,4,16,18: four numbers.

x=20: not included, as it's not a solution.

Similarly,
