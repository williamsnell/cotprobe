Okay, so I have this problem about determining the heat of vaporization of acetonitrile. The question gives me the normal boiling point, which is 80 degrees Celsius, and says that the vapor pressure is changing at a rate of 0.030 atm per degree Kelvin around that boiling point. I need to find the heat of vaporization from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that the heat of vaporization is related to the vapor pressure and the boiling point. There's an equation that connects these variables, probably the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Let me think about that.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually written as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2), where P is pressure, T is temperature in Kelvin, R is the gas constant, and ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization. But wait, this equation is for two different points, and here I have the rate of change around the boiling point.

Oh right, at the boiling point, the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atm. Because that's the definition of the normal boiling point. So at T = 80°C, which is 353.15 K, the vapor pressure is 1 atm.

The rate of change of vapor pressure with temperature is given as 0.030 atm/deg K. So dP/dT = 0.030 atm/K.

I think the Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be approximated in differential form. Let me recall. The differential form is dP/dT = (ΔHvap * P) / (R T²). Oh wait, is that right? Because I remember that the equation can be rearranged to dP/P = (ΔHvap/R) dT / T². So taking the derivative, dP/dT = (ΔHvap P) / (R T²). 

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The Clausius equation is d(ln P)/dT = ΔHvap/(R T²). So taking the derivative, ln P's derivative is (1/P) dP/dT. So yes, dP/dT = (ΔHvap P) / (R T²).

So I have dP/dT = 0.030 atm/K. At the boiling point, P is 1 atm, T is 353.15 K. So substituting:

0.030 = (ΔHvap * 1) / (R * (353.15)^2 )

I need to solve for ΔHvap. So rearranging, ΔHvap = (0.030 * R * T²) 

Wait, what's the value of R here? I think R is the gas constant. But wait, which units? Because the options are in kcal/mol. So R is typically 8.314 J/mol·K, but sometimes in some contexts, other units might be used. Alternatively, maybe R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, but that's for the ideal gas law. Hmm, but in the Clausius equation, I think R is in J/(mol·K) because ΔHvap is usually in J or kcal per mol.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Well, let's proceed with R as 8.314 J/mol·K.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔHvap = 0.030 atm/K * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (353.15 K)^2 

Wait, but wait, the units. Because the equation is in terms of pressure in atm and R in J/(mol·K), but J is kg·m²/s², and atm is in pascals which is kg/(m·s²). So perhaps the units will work out.

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute T squared: 353.15 K. So 353.15^2 = let's calculate that.

353.15 * 353.15. Let's approximate.

353^2 = (350 +3)^2 = 350² + 2*350*3 +3² = 122500 + 2100 +9= 124609. So 353.15^2 is approximately 124,609. Let's say 124600 for simplicity.

So then,

ΔHvap = 0.030 * 8.314 * 124600

Compute 0.030 * 8.314 = 0.24942

Then 0.24942 * 124600 = let's compute that.

0.24942 * 124600 = 124600 * 0.25 is 31150, but since it's 0.24942, which is 0.00058 less than 0.25, so 124600*0.00058 = approx 72.248. So 31150 -72.248 is about 31077.75 J/mol.

Wait, wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

0.24942 * 124600 = ?

Compute 0.2 * 124600 = 24,920.

0.04 * 124600 = 4,984.

0.00942 * 124600: Let's calculate 0.009 *124600=1,121.4, and 0.00042 *124600=52.362. So total 1,121.4 +52.362=1,173.762.

So adding all three: 24,920 +4,984=29,904. Then +1,173.762 gives 31,077.762 J/mol.

So approximately 31,078 J/mol.

Convert J to kcal: since 1 kcal is 4184 J.

So 31,078 / 4184 ≈ let's compute.

4184 *7 = 29,288. So 7*4184=29,288.

31,078 -29,288 = 1,790.

Now, 4184 * 0.4 ≈ 1,673.6.

So 7.4 would be 7 +0.4 =7.4, giving about 29,288 +1,673.6=30,961.6.

31,078 is 30,961.6 + 116.4. So 116.4 /4184 ≈ 0.0278.

So total is approximately 7.4 +0.0278 ≈7.4278 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait, the calculation I did earlier might have some approximation errors. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

First, T is 353.15 K.

So T squared is 353.15^2.

Let me compute 353^2 = 353 *353.

Calculating 350*350=122500.

Then 350 *3 *2=2100.

3^2=9.

So 353^2=122500+2100+9=124609.

So 353.15^2 is (353 +0.15)^2 =353^2 + 2*353*0.15 +0.15^2 =124609 + 105.9 +0.0225 =124714.9225 K².

So T² is approximately 124714.9225.

So now, ΔHvap = 0.030 * 8.314 * 124714.9225.

Compute 0.030 *8.314 = 0.24942.

Then 0.24942 *124714.9225.

Let me compute 0.24942 * 124714.9225.

First, 0.2 *124714.9225=24,942.9845.

Then 0.04*124714.9225=4,98.5969.

0.00942*124714.9225: Let's compute 0.009 *124714.9225=1,121.4343. 0.00042 *124714.9225=52.370. So 1,121.4343 +52.370=1,173.8043.

Adding all together: 24,942.9845 +4,988.5969=29,931.5814.

Then +1,173.8043= 31,105.3857 J/mol.

So about 31,105 J/mol.

Convert to kcal: 31,105 /4184 ≈ let's compute.

4184 *7=29,288.

31,105-29,288=1,817.

1,817 /4184 ≈ 0.4345.

So total is approx 7.4345 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option E is 7.4, option G is 7.2, and option C is 7.0, option J is 8.0.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the units? Because I used R as 8.314 J/mol·K, but perhaps the correct R to use here is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, because pressure is in atm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me think again. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the differential form is:

dP/dT = (ΔHvap * P) / (R T²)

Wait, but R has to be in terms that match the pressure units. If P is in atm, then R would be in L·atm/(mol·K). So R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

Ah, I think that's where I went wrong earlier. I used R in J, but perhaps it should be in L·atm. Because when using the equation dP/dT = (ΔHvap P)/(R T²), the units have to match. Since P is in atm, R should be in L·atm/(mol·K), and ΔHvap would then be in L·atm/mol.

Wait, but ΔHvap is usually expressed in J or kcal per mol, so perhaps I need to convert the units. Let me think through this again.

So the correct R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So let's recalculate with R=0.0821.

So ΔHvap = (dP/dT) * R * T² / P.

Wait, rearranging the equation:

ΔHvap = (dP/dT) * R * T² / P.

Because dP/dT = (ΔHvap P)/(R T²) → ΔHvap = (dP/dT) * R T² / P.

At the boiling point, P=1 atm, T=353.15 K.

So substituting the values:

ΔHvap = 0.030 atm/K * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * (353.15 K)^2 / 1 atm.

Let's compute this.

First, compute T squared: 353.15^2 = approx 124,714.92 K².

So,

ΔHvap = 0.030 * 0.0821 * 124714.92.

Let me compute the numbers step by step.

0.030 * 0.0821 = 0.002463.

Then 0.002463 * 124714.92.

Let me compute 0.002 *124714.92 = 249.42984.

0.000463 *124714.92 = let's compute:

0.0004 *124714.92 =49.885968.

0.000063 *124714.92 ≈7.846. So total from 0.000463 is approx 49.885968 +7.846 =57.731968.

So total ΔHvap ≈249.42984 +57.731968=307.1618 L·atm/mol.

Wait, but L·atm is a unit of energy. So 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J, because 1 atm is 101325 pascals and 1 L is 0.001 m³, so 101325 Pa * 0.001 m³ =101.325 J.

So 1 L·atm ≈101.325 J.

So to convert L·atm to J, multiply by 101.325.

So ΔHvap in J is 307.1618 L·atm/mol *101.325 J/(L·atm).

Compute 307.1618 *101.325.

Approximating, 300 *100=30,000. 7 *100=700 → 30,700. Then 300 *1.325= 397.5. 7 *1.325=9.275. So 30,700 +397.5 +9.275=31,106.775 J/mol.

Wait, that's similar to what I got earlier. So 31,106 J/mol.

Convert to kcal: 31,106 /4184 ≈7.43 kcal/mol.

But wait, earlier when I used R=8.314 I got approx 7.43, and now the same with R=0.0821, same result. Hmm, that seems contradictory because I thought changing R might change the result.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, let's think: R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) and 8.314 J/(mol·K). So when I used R=8.314 earlier, but didn't account for pressure units correctly, perhaps that was the mistake. But no, I think the correct approach is to use R=0.0821 when pressure is in atm, so that the units are consistent.

Wait, in any case, the result is about 7.43 kcal/mol, which matches option E (7.4) and maybe option G (7.2) is lower. Let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔHvap when using R=0.0821. Let me recompute.

So:

ΔHvap = (0.030 atm/K) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (353.15 K)^2 / (1 atm)

Atm units cancel out: (atm/K) * (L·atm/mol·K) * K² → L·atm/mol.

So,

0.030 * 0.0821 = 0.002463.

Multiply by (353.15)^2 =124714.92.

0.002463 *124714.92 = let me compute more accurately.

0.002 *124714.92 = 249.42984.

0.000463 *124714.92:

Compute 0.0004 *124714.92 =49.885968.

0.000063 *124714.92 = approx 7.846 (since 0.00006*124714.92=7.482. 0.000003*124714.92≈0.374). So 7.482 +0.374≈7.856.

So 49.885968 +7.856 =57.741968.

So total is 249.42984 +57.741968 =307.1718 L·atm/mol.

Convert to J: 307.1718 *101.325 ≈?

Calculate 300 *101.325 =30,397.5.

7.1718 *101.325: 7 *101.325=709.275. 0.1718 *101.325≈17.398.

So 709.275 +17.398=726.673.

Total ΔHvap =30,397.5 +726.673=31,124.173 J/mol.

Convert to kcal: 31,124 /4184 ≈7.43 kcal/mol.

So approximately 7.43 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option E is 7.4, which matches closely. Option G is 7.2, which is a bit lower. So the correct answer should be E:7.4 kcal/mol.

To determine the heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) of acetonitrile, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in its differential form:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}} \cdot P}{R \cdot T^2}
\]

Rearranging for ΔHvap:

\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{dP}{dT} \cdot R \cdot T^2 / P
\]

### Given Data:
- Normal boiling point: \( T = 80^\circ \text{C} = 353.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Rate of change of vapor pressure: \( \frac{dP}{dT} = 0.030 \, \text{atm/K} \)
- Vapor pressure at boiling point: \( P = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
- Gas constant: \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \( T^2 \)
\[
T^2 = (353.15)^2 = 124,714.92 \, \text{K}^2
\]

### Step 2: Substitute values into the equation
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{0.030 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 124,714.92}{1}
\]

First, calculate \( 0.030 \cdot 0.0821 \):
\[
0.030 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.002463
\]

Then, multiply by \( T^2 \):
\[
0.002463 \cdot 124,714.92 = 307.17 \, \text{L·atm/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Convert \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} \) to kcal/mol
1 L·atm = 101.325 J, so:
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 307.17 \cdot 101.325 = 31,124.17 \, \text{J/mol}
\]

Convert to kcal/mol (\( 1 \, \text{kcal} = 4184 \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\Delta H_{\text{vap}} = \frac{31,124.17}{4184} \approx 7.43 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated heat of vaporization is approximately \( 7.4 \, \text{kcal/mol} \), which corresponds to **option E**.
