Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about constructing a truth table for an argument and determining if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to choose a counterexample from the options given.

The argument given is:
I ≡ ~J
I ∨ J
And the conclusion is I.

Hmm, I think I remember that in logic, an argument is valid if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. So if there's any situation where the premises are all true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that situation is a counterexample.

Alright, first, let's break down the premises. The first premise is I ≡ ~J. That means I is equivalent to not J. So whenever I is true, J must be false, and vice versa. That's a biconditional statement, right? So it's true when both I and ~J are the same.

The second premise is I ∨ J, which is I or J. So at least one of them must be true.

The conclusion is I. So we're trying to see if I must be true whenever both premises are true.

I think the best way to approach this is to construct a truth table. Let's see, the variables are I and J, so there are four possible combinations: both true, I true and J false, I false and J true, both false.

Let me list them out:

1. I=True, J=True
2. I=True, J=False
3. I=False, J=True
4. I=False, J=False

Now, let's evaluate each premise and the conclusion in these scenarios.

Starting with the first row: I=True, J=True.

First premise: I ≡ ~J. So I is true, ~J is false. So true ≡ false is false. So premise 1 is false here.

Second premise: I ∨ J is true ∨ true = true.

But since the first premise is false, this row isn't a case where all premises are true. So we can ignore it for determining validity.

Second row: I=True, J=False.

First premise: I ≡ ~J. I is true, ~J is true (since J is false). So true ≡ true is true.

Second premise: I ∨ J is true ∨ false = true.

So both premises are true here. Now, the conclusion is I, which is true. So in this case, the conclusion holds.

Third row: I=False, J=True.

First premise: I ≡ ~J. I is false, ~J is false (since J is true). So false ≡ false is true.

Second premise: I ∨ J is false ∨ true = true.

So both premises are true. Now, the conclusion is I, which is false here. Oh, wait! Because the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. That means this is a counterexample. So the argument is invalid.

Wait, let me double-check that. In this case, when I is false and J is true, the first premise is I ≡ ~J. So I is false, ~J is false (because J is true). So I ≡ ~J is false ≡ false, which is true. So premise 1 is true. Then, I ∨ J is false ∨ true, which is true. So both premises are true. But the conclusion is I, which is false. So yes, that's a counterexample.

Fourth row: I=False, J=False.

First premise: I ≡ ~J. I is false, ~J is true (since J is false). So false ≡ true is false.

Second premise: I ∨ J is false ∨ false = false.

So both premises aren't true here (premise 1 is false, premise 2 is false). So this isn't a case where all premises are true, so it doesn't affect validity.

So from the truth table, the only case where both premises are true is when I is true and J is false, and another case when I is false and J is true. Wait, wait, no: in the third row, I is false, J is true, and both premises are true. Because I≡~J is true when I is false and J is true, since ~J is false, and I is false, so false ≡ false.

Wait no: Wait, if J is true, then ~J is false. So when I is false and J is true, I is false, ~J is false, so I ≡ ~J is true because both are false. So yes, premise 1 is true. And I ∨ J is false ∨ true, which is true. So both premises are true, but the conclusion I is false. So that's a counterexample.

So the argument is invalid because there's a case where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find an option that correctly states this and gives the counterexample.

The options are from A to J. Let me read them again.

Option A: Valid. The argument is a contradiction. Wait, no, because we have a counterexample, so it's invalid. So A is wrong.

Option B: Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true. Hmm, in the first row, when I and J are both true, the first premise is false, so that's not a case where all premises are true. So B is not correct.

Option C: Valid. No, because we found a counterexample, so C is wrong.

Option D: Invalid. Counterexample when both I and J are false. Let's check that case: when I is false and J is false. Then, premise 1: I ≡ ~J. I is false, ~J is true. So false ≡ true is false. Premise 2: I ∨ J is false. So both premises are not true here. So this isn't a counterexample. So D is wrong.

Option E: Valid. The argument is tautological. No, because we have a counterexample. So E is wrong.

Option F: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false. Wait, in that case, the premises are both true, and the conclusion is true. So that's not a counterexample. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true. Yes! That's exactly the case we found. So G is a possible correct answer.

Option H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false. Wait, that's the same as G. Because I is false and J is true. So H is the same situation as G. So H is also correct?

Wait, let me check the options. Option G says when I is false and J is true. Option H says when J is true and I is false. So they describe the same situation. But looking at the options, I think each option is unique, but perhaps the way they're worded varies. Wait, no, I think G and H might be the same. Let me recheck.

Wait, no: G says "I is false and J is true", which is the same as H: "J is true and I is false". So they're the same scenario. But in the options, I can only choose one. So perhaps the way the options are presented, both G and H are correct, but I think in the options, only one can be correct because each letter is unique.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Valid. The argument is a contradiction

B: Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true

C: Valid

D: Invalid. Counterexample when both I and J are false

E: Valid. The argument is tautological

F: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true

H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false

I: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is false

J: Valid. No counterexample exists

Wait, so G and H are two separate options. But they describe the same situation. So perhaps I should look at the letters. Which one is correct? Because in the problem statement, each option is unique, so maybe only one option corresponds to the correct counterexample.

Wait, in our analysis, when I is false and J is true, that's the counterexample. So that's option G: "Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true."

Alternatively, option H says "J is true and I is false", which is the same as G. So why are there two options? Maybe I made a mistake in reading the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true

H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false

Ah, no, G and H are the same in meaning, just phrased differently. So perhaps the correct answer is G or H. But I'm not sure why both are present.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the truth table again.

When I is false and J is true:

Premise 1: I ≡ ~J → False ≡ False (because J is true, so ~J is false). So I ≡ ~J is true.

Premise 2: I ∨ J → False ∨ True = True.

Conclusion: I → False. So the premises are true, conclusion is false. So this is a counterexample.

So the correct counterexample is when I is false and J is true. So in the options, that's option G.

Wait, but option H says when J is true and I is false, which is the same situation. So perhaps the correct answer is either G or H. But the options are A-J, each being unique.

Wait, perhaps I should check the actual letters again. Let me look:

Options:

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true

H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false

So G and H are the same scenario but worded differently. But in the options, they're separate. So how to choose between them? Well, perhaps I made a mistake and only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, and H is not an option. Or perhaps the intended answer is H. Wait, perhaps I should think about the order: in the option, G states I is false and J is true, which is the same as H's J is true and I is false.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is G, because that's the way I thought about it. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the answer options may have intended only one correct option. So perhaps I should look for the option that correctly describes the counterexample.

Wait, the correct counterexample is when I is false and J is true. So the option that states that is option G.

Alternatively, if the option says J is true and I is false, that's the same situation, so that's option H.

Wait, but the way the options are written, both G and H describe the same scenario. So perhaps the correct answer is either G or H, but in the provided options, perhaps only one is present.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true

H: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false

So both are correct, but perhaps only one is intended. Alternatively, perhaps I should check which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the conclusion. The conclusion is I, which is false in this scenario. So when I is false and J is true, that's the case.

So the correct option is G: Invalid. Counterexample when I is false and J is true.

Wait, but in the options given, option G is that. So I think the correct answer is G.

To determine the validity of the argument:

**Premises:**
1. \( I \equiv \neg J \)
2. \( I \lor J \)

**Conclusion:**
\( I \)

### Truth Table Analysis:
We evaluate the truth values of the premises and conclusion for all possible combinations of \( I \) and \( J \):

| \( I \) | \( J \) | \( \neg J \) | \( I \equiv \neg J \) | \( I \lor J \) | Conclusion (\( I \)) |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **T**  | **T**  | **F**      | **F**                 | **T**          | **T**              |
| **T**  | **F**  | **T**      | **T**                 | **T**          | **T**              |
| **F**  | **T**  | **F**      | **T**                 | **T**          | **F**              |
| **F**  | **F**  | **T**      | **F**                 | **F**          | **F**              |

### Key Observations:
1. An argument is **valid** if, in all rows where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
2. A **counterexample** exists if there is at least one row where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

### Evaluation:
- **Row 1 (\( I = T, J = T \)):** Premise 1 is false, so this row does not affect validity.
- **Row 2 (\( I = T, J = F \)):** Both premises are true, and the conclusion is true. This row supports validity.
- **Row 3 (\( I = F, J = T \)):** Both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This is a **counterexample**.
- **Row 4 (\( I = F, J = F \)):** Premise 1 is false, so this row does not affect validity.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **invalid** because there is a counterexample: when \( I \) is false and \( J \) is true.

### Correct Option:
The correct option is **G: Invalid. Counterexample when \( I \) is false and \( J \) is true**.
