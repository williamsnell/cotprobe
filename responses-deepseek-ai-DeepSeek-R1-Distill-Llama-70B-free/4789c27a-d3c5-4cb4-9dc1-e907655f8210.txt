Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: For every positive real number x, define g(x) as the limit when r approaches 0 of [(x+1)^(r+1) - x^(r+1)] raised to the power of 1/r. Then, we need to find the limit of g(x)/x as x approaches infinity.

Hmm, okay. So, the function g(x) is defined using a limit involving exponents with r approaching 0. And then we're looking at the ratio of g(x) to x as x becomes very large. My task is to find what this ratio tends to.

Let me break this down. First, I think I should try to compute g(x) by evaluating that limit. Once I have g(x), then I can analyze g(x)/x as x approaches infinity.

So, starting with g(x):

g(x) = lim_{r→0} [(x+1)^{r+1} - x^{r+1}]^{1/r}

This looks a bit intimidating, but maybe I can simplify the expression inside the limit. Since r is approaching 0, perhaps I can expand these terms using a Taylor series or logarithmic approximations.

Wait, when r is near 0, (x+1)^r is approximately 1 + r ln(x+1), right? Because a^b ≈ 1 + b ln a when b is small. Similarly, x^r ≈ 1 + r ln x. But here, the exponent is r+1, so maybe I should write (x+1)^{r+1} as (x+1) * (x+1)^r, and similarly for x^{r+1}.

So, let's try that:

(x+1)^{r+1} = (x+1) * (x+1)^r ≈ (x+1) [1 + r ln(x+1)]
Similarly, x^{r+1} = x * x^r ≈ x [1 + r ln x]

So substituting these into the expression inside the limit:

[(x+1)(1 + r ln(x+1)) - x(1 + r ln x)]^{1/r}

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

= (x+1)(1) + (x+1)(r ln(x+1)) - x(1) - x(r ln x)
= (x+1 - x) + r [ (x+1) ln(x+1) - x ln x ]
= 1 + r [ (x+1) ln(x+1) - x ln x ]

So the expression becomes:

[1 + r * { (x+1) ln(x+1) - x ln x } ]^{1/r}

Now, as r approaches 0, the term inside the brackets is of the form 1 + r * A, where A is some constant (with respect to r). So, the limit as r→0 of [1 + r A]^{1/r} is e^A. Because lim_{r→0} (1 + r A)^{1/r} = e^A.

So, g(x) becomes e^{A}, where A is (x+1) ln(x+1) - x ln x.

Wait, let me make sure. So:

A = (x+1) ln(x+1) - x ln x.

So, g(x) = e^{ (x+1) ln(x+1) - x ln x }.

Hmm, can I simplify this expression further?

Let me compute A:

A = (x+1) ln(x+1) - x ln x
= x ln(x+1) + ln(x+1) - x ln x
= x [ln(x+1) - ln x] + ln(x+1)
= x ln( (x+1)/x ) + ln(x+1)
= x ln(1 + 1/x) + ln(x+1)

As x becomes large, 1/x is small, so ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ 1/x - 1/(2x²) + ... So:

x ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ x [1/x - 1/(2x²)] = 1 - 1/(2x)

So, A ≈ [1 - 1/(2x)] + ln(x+1)

But ln(x+1) for large x is approximately ln x + ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ ln x + 1/x.

So putting it together:

A ≈ 1 - 1/(2x) + ln x + 1/x

= ln x + 1 + (1/x - 1/(2x)) 

= ln x + 1 + 1/(2x)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me retrace.

Wait, when x is large, ln(x+1) can be written as ln x + ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ ln x + 1/x - 1/(2x²) + ... So, approximately ln x + 1/x.

So, putting that into A:

A ≈ [x*(1/x - 1/(2x²))] + [ln x + 1/x]

= [1 - 1/(2x)] + [ln x + 1/x]

= ln x + 1 + (1/x - 1/(2x)) 

Wait, 1/x - 1/(2x) is 1/(2x). So, A ≈ ln x + 1 + 1/(2x).

But wait, when x is very large, the 1/(2x) term becomes negligible. So, A ≈ ln x + 1.

So, g(x) is e^{A} ≈ e^{ln x + 1} = e^{1} * e^{ln x} = e * x.

So, g(x) ≈ e x for large x.

Now, the question is about the limit as x approaches infinity of g(x)/x.

If g(x) ≈ e x, then g(x)/x ≈ e x /x = e.

So, the limit is e.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.7182818, which is approximately e (since e ≈ 2.718281828...).

So the answer should be option I.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the function \( g(x) \), which is defined as:

\[
g(x) = \lim_{r \to 0} \left[(x+1)^{r+1} - x^{r+1}\right]^{1/r}.
\]

For small \( r \), we approximate \( (x+1)^r \) and \( x^r \) using the expansion \( a^b \approx 1 + b \ln a \). Thus:

\[
(x+1)^{r+1} = (x+1)(x+1)^r \approx (x+1)\left[1 + r \ln(x+1)\right],
\]
\[
x^{r+1} = x \cdot x^r \approx x\left[1 + r \ln x\right].
\]

Substituting these into the expression inside the limit:

\[
(x+1)^{r+1} - x^{r+1} \approx (x+1)\left[1 + r \ln(x+1)\right] - x\left[1 + r \ln x\right].
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
= (x+1) + r(x+1)\ln(x+1) - x - r x \ln x,
\]
\[
= 1 + r\left[(x+1)\ln(x+1) - x \ln x\right].
\]

Let \( A = (x+1)\ln(x+1) - x \ln x \). Then:

\[
\left[(x+1)^{r+1} - x^{r+1}\right]^{1/r} \approx \left[1 + rA\right]^{1/r}.
\]

As \( r \to 0 \), \( \left[1 + rA\right]^{1/r} \to e^A \). Therefore:

\[
g(x) = e^A,
\]
where \( A = (x+1)\ln(x+1) - x \ln x \).

Simplifying \( A \):

\[
A = (x+1)\ln(x+1) - x \ln x = x \ln\left(\frac{x+1}{x}\right) + \ln(x+1).
\]

For large \( x \), \( \ln\left(\frac{x+1}{x}\right) \approx \frac{1}{x} \), so:

\[
A \approx x \cdot \frac{1}{x} + \ln(x+1) = 1 + \ln x.
\]

Thus, \( g(x) \approx e^{1 + \ln x} = e \cdot x \).

Finally, we compute the limit of \( \frac{g(x)}{x} \) as \( x \to \infty \):

\[
\frac{g(x)}{x} \approx \frac{e \cdot x}{x} = e.
\]

The value of \( e \) is approximately \( 2.7182818 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
