Okay, so I've got this question about the Holocene period in Africa. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which culture was replaced by another in Holocene Africa. The options are pairs of different cultures or tools. I remember that the Holocene started around 10,000 years ago and is the current geological epoch. So, I'm thinking about the transitions of cultures during that time.

I think the Capsian culture comes into play here. From what I remember, the Capsian culture was a significant one in North Africa, especially around the Sahara region. They were known for their microlithic tools, which are small stone tools. Microliths were used for various purposes, maybe in composite tools like arrows or knives.

Wait, there's also the Iberomaurusian culture. I'm trying to place them. Iberomaurusian, if I'm not mistaken, was a culture that existed before the Capsian. Oh right, the Iberomaurusian culture was in the Maghreb region of northwest Africa, and they were known for a different type of stone tool, perhaps more like backed blades. Backed blades are where one edge is blunted, probably for use in a haft or handle.

So the timeline would be that the Iberomaurusian came first, and then the Capsian replaced them. The Capsian started around 10,000 years ago, which fits the Holocene. So the first blank is Iberomaurusian, and the second is Capsian.

Looking at the options, option C says "Iberomaurusian culture; Capsian culture". That fits what I was thinking. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Option J is the reverse: Capsian replacing Iberomaurusian, which would be wrong because Capsian came after. Option I has Natufian and Capsian, but Natufian was in the Levant, not really in Africa where Capsian was. So yeah, I think C is correct.

The question asks about the cultural transition in Holocene Africa, specifically which culture was replaced by another. The Holocene epoch began around 10,000 years ago, and in North Africa, the Capsian culture became prominent during this period, known for its microlithic tools. The Iberomaurusian culture, which existed earlier in the Maghreb region, is associated with backed blades and predates the Capsian culture. The Capsian culture replaced the Iberomaurusian culture, making the correct sequence "Iberomaurusian culture" followed by "Capsian culture."

Option C correctly reflects this transition, while other options either reverse the order or involve unrelated cultures.

Answer: C
