Question:

A women feeds her new cat daily with canned cat food. As she opens the cans with a noisy electric can opener, she calls the cat. The cat comes in response, to its name, and the woman feeds it. Why does the cat eventually come running when it hears the electric can opener?

Options:

A: The cat believes that the can opener itself is a toy.
B: The cat has learned that the can opener noise means someone is in the kitchen.
C: The cat recognizes the can opener as a signal that its owner is nearby.
D: The cat enjoys the routine of the feeding process and the sound signifies the start.
E: The cat is trained to respond to the sound of the can opener.
F: The cat is attracted by the noise of the can opener.
G: The cat likes the sound of the can opener.
H: The cat has associated the sound of the can opener with the presentation of food.
I: The cat is curious about the source of the noise and comes to investigate.
J: The cat has been conditioned to come for a treat whenever it hears any electrical appliance.

Okay, so I have this question about a cat and an electric can opener. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is that a woman feeds her new cat daily with canned food. Every time she opens the can with a noisy electric opener, she calls the cat, and the cat comes. The question is why the cat eventually comes running when it hears the can opener.

Hmm, I remember from psychology that there's classical conditioning, which is when a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit an unconditioned response. Over time, the neutral stimulus alone can cause a conditioned response. So, maybe that's what's happening here.

So the can opener makes a noise, which is the neutral stimulus. Every time she uses it, she calls the cat and feeds it. The food is the unconditioned stimulus because it naturally makes the cat come. But over time, the sound of the can opener (the noise) becomes associated with the food. So the cat learns that the noise means food is coming, so it starts coming when it hears the noise, even before being called maybe.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The cat thinks the opener is a toy. I don't think so. The cat's response is about coming for food, not playing.

Option B: The cat learns the opener means someone's in the kitchen. Maybe, but it's more specific than that. The cat comes because it's about food, not just presence.

Option C: The cat recognizes the opener as a signal the owner is nearby. Similar to B, but again, it's about the food, not just presence.

Option D: The cat enjoys the routine, sound signifies start. This is about routine, which might be part of it, but the main reason is the association with food.

Option E: The cat is trained to respond to the sound. Training implies deliberate action, like maybe the owner taught it, but the scenario is just the natural process of feeding.

Option F: Attracted by the noise. Maybe, but why? The noise itself isn't attractive; it's the association with food.

Option G: Likes the sound. Unlikely, unless the sound is pleasing, but I think it's more about what follows the sound.

Option H: Associated the sound with food presentation. Yes, this aligns with classical conditioning. The sound becomes a conditioned stimulus leading to the response of coming for food.

Option I: Curious about the noise. Maybe at first, but after repeated instances, it's the food association, not just curiosity.

Option J: Conditioned to come for any electrical appliance. No, the question is specific to the can opener, not any appliance.

So the correct answer should be H. The cat has learned to associate the can opener's noise with food, so it comes running when it hears it.

The cat comes running when it hears the electric can opener because it has associated the noise with the presentation of food. This is an example of classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus (the can opener noise) becomes linked to an unconditioned stimulus (the food), leading to a conditioned response (the cat coming for food). The correct answer is:

H: The cat has associated the sound of the can opener with the presentation of food.

Answer: H
