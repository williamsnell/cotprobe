Okay, so I need to find the Laplace transform of f(t) = sin(kt), where t is greater than 0, and k is a real constant. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms are used to convert differential equations into algebraic ones, which makes them easier to solve. 

I think the Laplace transform of sin(at) is a standard result, so maybe I should recall that. Let me think... Oh right, the Laplace transform of sin(kt) is something like k divided by (s squared plus k squared). Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the denominator. Let me double-check.

The general formula for the Laplace transform of sin(at) is L{sin(at)} = a / (s² + a²). So in this case, a is k. That would make the Laplace transform of sin(kt) equal to k/(s² + k²). 

Looking at the options provided:

Option A is k/(s² +k²), which matches what I just thought. Option B is k/(s² -k²), which doesn't seem right because the denominator should have a plus sign, not a minus. Option F is s/(s² +k²), which is the Laplace transform of cos(kt), I think. Because I remember that L{cos(kt)} = s/(s² +k²). So F can't be the correct answer here.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. So for Laplace transforms, the sine and cosine have similar forms but differ in the numerator. For sine, it's the numerator that's the 'a' (here k), and the denominator is s squared plus a squared. Cosine has 's' in the numerator and the same denominator. So yeah, that confirms that Option A is the correct one.

Wait, did I get the signs right in the denominator? Oh yes, because the transform for sine is a/(s² + a²), so it's definitely a plus. So Option A is correct.

To find the Laplace transform of \( f(t) = \sin(kt) \) for \( t > 0 \), we use the standard result for the Laplace transform of \( \sin(at) \), which is:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{\sin(at)\} = \frac{a}{s^2 + a^2}.
\]

Here, \( a = k \), so substituting this into the formula gives:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{\sin(kt)\} = \frac{k}{s^2 + k^2}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{k}{s^2 + k^2} \) matches the derived result.
- **Option B**: \( \frac{k}{s^2 - k^2} \) is incorrect because the denominator should have a plus sign, not a minus sign.
- **Option F**: \( \frac{s}{s^2 + k^2} \) corresponds to the Laplace transform of \( \cos(kt) \), not \( \sin(kt) \).
- The other options (C, D, E, G, H, I, J) do not match the correct form of the Laplace transform of \( \sin(kt) \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
