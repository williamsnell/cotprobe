Okay, so I've got this question here about which country is least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry. The options are A through J, each representing a different country. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the least ability to provide the necessary resources on its own.

First, I should probably think about what natural resources are important for modern industry. I guess things like oil, natural gas, coal, minerals like iron, copper, maybe rare earth metals, and perhaps agricultural resources. Countries that are self-sufficient usually produce enough of these to meet their own needs without relying too much on imports.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Japan. From what I remember, Japan doesn't have a lot of natural resources. They import most of their oil, natural gas, and even coal. They do have some minerals, but not enough to be self-sufficient. So Japan might be a strong candidate for the answer.

Option B: Canada. Canada is known for its abundant natural resources. They have lots of oil, especially the tar sands in Alberta. They also have forests, minerals, and plenty of fresh water. So Canada is probably very self-sufficient.

Option C: Australia. Australia is rich in minerals and resources like coal, iron ore, gold, and uranium. They export a lot, so they must have enough for themselves. So Australia should be pretty self-sufficient.

Option D: France. I'm not too sure about France. They might have some resources, but I think they import a significant portion of their energy needs, like oil and natural gas. They do have some nuclear power, which reduces their need for fossil fuels, but in terms of raw materials for industry, maybe they're not as self-sufficient.

Option E: Brazil. Brazil has a lot of natural resources. They have large agricultural lands, plenty of water, and significant oil reserves. They also have minerals like iron ore. So Brazil is likely quite self-sufficient.

Option F: China. China is a big player in resources. They have large coal reserves and produce a lot of their own minerals. However, they do import some oil and certain minerals because their industries are so vast. But overall, they might still be relatively self-sufficient compared to others.

Option G: United Kingdom. The UK has some natural gas and oil, especially from the North Sea, but those reserves are declining. They might import more now, especially oil. They also have some coal but not as much as they used to. So maybe the UK isn't as self-sufficient as it once was.

Option H: Germany. Germany has some coal and minerals, but I think they import a lot of their energy, especially oil and natural gas. They're trying to transition to renewable energy, but for heavy industry, they might rely on imports for certain resources.

Option I: United States. The US is known for its abundant resources. They have plenty of oil, natural gas, coal, and various minerals. They're even a net exporter of some energy resources now, so they're quite self-sufficient.

Option J: Russia. Russia is extremely resource-rich. They have huge oil, natural gas, and mineral reserves. They export a lot, so they definitely have enough for their own needs.

So, looking back at the options, the ones that stand out as less self-sufficient are Japan (A), France (D), Germany (H), and the UK (G). Now, I need to decide which is the least among these.

Japan is known for importing almost all of its fossil fuels. They have very few natural resources, so they're heavily dependent on imports. France, while not as resource-poor as Japan, still imports a significant portion. The UK's situation has declined but maybe they still have more resources than Japan. Germany also imports a lot, especially for energy.

So between A (Japan) and maybe H (Germany), I think Japan is the least self-sufficient. They have very limited natural resources, so they must import most of what they need for industry.

The question asks which country is least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry. To determine this, we analyze the availability of key resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, minerals, and agricultural products in each country.

- **Japan (A)**: Japan has very limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports for oil, natural gas, and minerals, making it highly dependent on external sources.
- **Canada (B)**: Canada is rich in natural resources, including oil, minerals, and forests, making it highly self-sufficient.
- **Australia (C)**: Australia is abundant in minerals like coal, iron ore, and gold, and exports many of these resources, indicating strong self-sufficiency.
- **France (D)**: France imports a significant portion of its energy needs, such as oil and natural gas, though it has some nuclear capacity. It is less self-sufficient than some others but not the least.
- **Brazil (E)**: Brazil has ample natural resources, including oil, minerals, and agricultural land, making it relatively self-sufficient.
- **China (F)**: China has large reserves of coal and minerals but imports some oil and specific minerals to support its vast industries. It is still relatively self-sufficient overall.
- **United Kingdom (G)**: The UK has declining oil and gas reserves and imports more energy now, but it still has some resources.
- **Germany (H)**: Germany imports a significant portion of its energy, especially oil and natural gas, and relies on imports for certain minerals.
- **United States (I)**: The US is highly self-sufficient, with abundant oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals, and is even a net exporter of energy.
- **Russia (J)**: Russia is extremely resource-rich, with vast oil, natural gas, and mineral reserves, making it very self-sufficient.

Among these, **Japan (A)** stands out as the least self-sufficient due to its severe lack of natural resources and heavy reliance on imports for nearly all its industrial needs.
