Okay, so I have this question about antennas here. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned. The question is asking about the maximum effective aperture of an antenna given its directivity and wavelength.

Wait, I think the formula relates the effective aperture (A) to the directivity (D) and the wavelength (λ). Oh right, the formula is A = (D * λ²) / (4π). Or was it something else? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again. Oh, right, because directivity is a measure of how directional the antenna is, and the effective aperture is the area that effectively captures the power.

So the question gives D as 50 and λ as 4 meters. Plugging those into the formula should give me the answer. Let me write this out step by step.

First, D = 50. λ = 4 m. So A = (50 * (4)^2) / (4 * π). Let me compute that. 4 squared is 16. So 50 *16 is 800. Then divide by 4π. Oh wait, 4π is approximately 12.566. So 800 divided by 12.566 is about what? Let me calculate that.

Wait, 800 divided by 12.566. Let me see, 12.566 times 63 is around 12.566 *60 = 753.96, and 12.566 *63 is 753.96 + (12.566 *3)= 37.698 → total 791.658. Oh wait, 63 times 12.566 is about 791.66. 800 is a bit more than that. So 63.6? Let me check 63.6 *12.566. 63*12.566 is 791.658 as before. 0.6 *12.566 is 7.5396. So 791.658 +7.5396 is 799.1976. Oh, that's really close to 800. So A is approximately 63.6 m².

Looking back at the options, option H is 63.6 m². So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the formula right? Because I remember another formula sometimes involving the gain and impedance, but in this case, the question is about directivity, not gain. So the formula should definitely be A = (D * λ²)/(4π). Yeah, that's correct.

So plugging in D=50, λ=4, A=(50 *16)/(4π) → 800/(4π)=200/π. Since π is about 3.1416, 200/3.1416 is approximately 63.66, which is about 63.6. So yeah, option H is correct.

To determine the maximum effective aperture (\(A\)) of the antenna, we use the formula:

\[
A = \frac{D \cdot \lambda^2}{4\pi}
\]

where:
- \(D = 50\) (directivity),
- \(\lambda = 4 \, \text{m}\) (wavelength).

Substituting the values:
\[
A = \frac{50 \cdot (4)^2}{4\pi} = \frac{50 \cdot 16}{4\pi} = \frac{800}{4\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi}.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
\[
A \approx \frac{200}{3.1416} \approx 63.66 \, \text{m}^2.
\]

This value is closest to \(63.6 \, \text{m}^2\), which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
