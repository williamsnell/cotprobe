Okay, so I have this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about pea plants and their traits. I remember that in pea plants, certain traits are determined by genes, and these are usually inherited in a Mendelian fashion. The two traits given here are plant height (tall or dwarf) and cotyledon color (yellow or green). 

The problem states that tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) is dominant to green (g). So, for each trait, there are two alleles: one dominant and one recessive.

The setup is that a tall pea plant with yellow cotyledons was crossed with another tall plant with green cotyledons. Then, looking at their progeny, we have the following results: 6 tall green, 5 tall yellow, 2 dwarf yellow, and 2 dwarf green.

Wait, wait. So the parents are tall and yellow (so phenotype DD or Dd for height, and GG or Gg for cotyledon), but wait no, no, the parents are the ones being crossed. Let me correct that. Parent 1 is tall and yellow, parent 2 is tall and green.

The question is asking for the genotypes of these two parents.

So the possible genotypes for each parent need to be determined based on the phenotypic ratios of their offspring.

Let me think about the F1 generation. The parents have certain genotypes, and their cross produces the given phenotypic ratios.

First, let me recap the possible genotypes for each trait.

For height (D is dominant):

- DD: homozygous dominant, always tall.
- Dd: heterozygous, tall.
- dd: homozygous recessive, dwarf.

For cotyledon color (G is dominant):

- GG: yellow
- Gg: yellow
- gg: green.

So, the parents are both tall. So their possible genotypes for height are either DD or Dd.

Parent 1 has yellow cotyledons, so possible genotypes are GG or Gg.

Parent 2 has green cotyledons, so genotype must be gg because only gg shows green (since G is dominant, any G allele would make it yellow).

Wait, parent 2: phenotype is green, which means genotype is homozygous recessive gg. So for the cotyledon trait, one parent is yellow (either GG or Gg), and the other is green (gg).

So the cross for the cotyledon trait is either GG × gg or Gg × gg.

Let me think about the progeny. Looking at the offspring, for cotyledon color, the ratio is (tall green + dwarf green) to (tall yellow + dwarf yellow). The actual numbers are 6+2=8 green and 5+2=7 yellow. Wait, but wait, the counts are 6 tall green, 5 tall yellow, 2 dwarf yellow, 2 dwarf green. So that's 6+2=8 green and 5+2=7 yellow. So about a 8:7 ratio, which is roughly 8/15 green and 7/15 yellow, but that's probably approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio for each trait can be considered. Let me think about each trait separately.

First, the height trait. The parents are both tall, so possible genotypes are DD × something, or Dd × something.

Looking at the offspring, the ratio of tall to dwarf is (6+5) = 11 tall and (2+2)=4 dwarf. So 11:4. Hmm, 11:4 is not a typical Mendelian ratio. Wait, let me see. Wait, 11 tall and 4 dwarf in total.

Wait, 15 total? Because 6+5+2+2=15. So 11 tall and 4 dwarf.

Hmm, 11:4 is not a standard ratio. Let me think: 11 is 9 + 2, 4 is 3 + 1. Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe the parents are both Dd for height?

Because if both parents are Dd, then their cross would be Dd × Dd, which gives a 3:1 ratio of tall to dwarf. But wait, in this case, 11:4 is about 2.75:1, which is not 3:1. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the numbers: 6 tall green, 5 tall yellow, 2 dwarf yellow, 2 dwarf green. So for height:

Tall: 6 +5 = 11

Dwarf: 2 +2=4

So total 15 plants.

So 11 tall, 4 dwarf. 11/15 is approximately 0.73, which is about 3/4. Wait, 3/4 would be 3:1, but 11:4 is about 2.75:1.

Hmm, perhaps the parents are not both Dd. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps one of the parents is homozygous DD and the other is Dd.

Wait, if a DD (homozygous dominant) is crossed with a Dd (heterozygous), their offspring would be all Dd, which are tall. So the ratio would be 100% tall, which is not the case here. So that can't be.

Wait, the other option is that both parents are Dd. Then, their offspring would have 25% dd (dwarf), 50% Dd (tall), and 25% DD (tall). So the ratio is 3:1. But in this case, the actual ratio is 11:4, which is approximately 2.75:1, not exactly 3:1.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Wait, maybe the parents are Dd and dd? No, because both parents are tall. So both must have at least one D allele. So parents cannot be dd, as that would make them dwarf.

Wait, then maybe one parent is DD and the other is Dd. But as I thought earlier, that would result in all tall offspring, which is not the case here. So that can't be.

So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I should consider that each trait is being inherited independently, so I can look at each trait's ratio separately and then combine the genotypes.

Let's look at each trait separately.

First, the height (D/d). Parents are both tall. The offspring have 11 tall and 4 dwarf. So ratio of 11:4.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. 11 out of 15. 11/15 is about 0.733. If the expected ratio for tall is 3/4, then 3/4 of 15 is 11.25, which is close to 11. So perhaps the ratio is 3:1, but the numbers are a bit off due to small sample size.

Wait, 3:1 would mean 9 tall and 6 dwarf in 15. But here it's 11 tall and 4 dwarf. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is 9:6 (3:2), but that doesn't seem standard.

Wait, maybe the parents are Dd (hetero) × DD (homo). Then, all offspring would be Dd (tall) and DD (tall), so 100% tall. But that can't be, as there are dwarfs in the progeny.

So perhaps the parents are both Dd. Then, the cross is Dd × Dd. The expected ratio is 3 tall (DD, Dd) to 1 dwarf (dd). So in 15 plants, 9 tall and 6 dwarf. But in the data, it's 11 tall and 4 dwarf. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the cotyledon trait as well. Let's look at that.

Cotyledon color: Parent 1 is yellow (so G_ genotype), Parent 2 is green (so gg genotype).

So the cross is G_ × gg.

Possible genotypes:

If parent 1 is GG: then all offspring would be Gg (yellow).

If parent 1 is Gg: then 50% of offspring would be Gg (yellow), and 50% would be gg (green).

In the progeny, for cotyledon color, the total is 8 green and 7 yellow.

Wait, that's 8 green and 7 yellow, which is a ratio of 8:7.

Wait, but 8 +7 =15. So 8/15 green, 7/15 yellow.

If the cross is Gg × gg, then the expected ratio is 50% yellow (Gg) and 50% green (gg). Because Gg × gg gives 50% Gg and 50% gg.

But the observed ratio is approximately 53% green and 47% yellow. Hmm, that's pretty close to 50:50.

So perhaps the parents are Gg (yellow) and gg (green), leading to 50% yellow and 50% green.

So the observed data is close to that, so that makes sense.

So for the cotyledon trait, parent 1's genotype is Gg, and parent 2 is gg.

So that gives us the cross Gg × gg, which produces 50% Gg (yellow) and 50% gg (green). The observed data is 7 yellow and 8 green, which is close to 7/15 (approx 46.6%) and 8/15 (53.3%). So that fits.

So that part seems to make sense. So for the cotyledon, parent 1 is Gg and parent 2 is gg.

Now, back to the height trait.

The parents are both tall. So their genotypes are either DD or Dd.

The cross between them gives 11 tall and 4 dwarf.

Wait, 11 tall: 4 dwarf is a 11:4 ratio.

Wait, that's 11/15 (approx 73.3%) tall and 4/15 (26.6%) dwarf.

Hmm, what possible cross would give that?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the parents are both Dd. So Dd × Dd. Then, the expected ratio is 3:1 (tall:dwarf). In 15 offspring, 9 tall, 6 dwarf. But in our case, it's 11 tall and 4 dwarf.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps the parents are not both Dd.

Wait, another possibility: suppose one parent is Dd and the other is DD. Then, their cross would produce:

DD × Dd → all offspring would be either DD or Dd, which are both tall. So 100% tall. But we have some dwarfs, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps one parent is Dd and the other is Dd, making it Dd × Dd.

Wait, same as before, so 3:1 ratio. But observed is 11:4, which is 2.75:1. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the parents have different genotypes. Let me think: if one parent is DD and the other is Dd, as I thought earlier, but that gives all tall. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the parents are Dd (hetero) × dd (homo recessive). But wait, parent 2 is tall, so can't be dd. Because dd is dwarf. So parent 2 can't be dd; both parents are tall, so must be either DD or Dd.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the parents are Dd and Dd. Then, the F1 would have 3/4 tall and 1/4 dwarf.

Wait, 3/4 of 15 is 11.25, which is approx 11. So 11 tall and 4 dwarf. Oh wait, that fits exactly!

Wait, 3/4 *15=11.25, which rounds to 11 tall, and 1/4 *15=3.75, which rounds to 4 dwarf.

So that would explain the 11:4 ratio.

So, if both parents are Dd, their cross would produce 25% DD, 50% Dd, and 25% dd.

So 75% tall (11) and 25% dwarf (4), but wait 25% of 15 is 3.75, which would be 4 when rounded. So that makes sense.

So for the height trait, both parents are Dd.

Putting it all together:

Parent 1: tall (Dd) and yellow cotyledons (Gg).

Parent 2: tall (Dd) and green cotyledons (gg).

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that for the cotyledon, parent 2 is green, so gg. And parent 1 is yellow, so Gg.

So their genotypes would be:

Parent 1: Dd Gg

Parent 2: Dd gg

So looking at the options, let's see which option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option G: DdGg × Ddgg → Yes, that's exactly what I have here.

Option G is DdGg × Ddgg.

So that would be the correct choice.

Wait, let me double-check.

Parent 1: Dd (tall) and Gg (yellow). So genotype DdGg.

Parent 2: Dd (tall) and gg (green). So genotype Ddgg.

So the cross is DdGg × Ddgg.

Yes, that would produce the observed ratios.

So the correct option is G.

In peas, tall (D) is dominant to dwarf (d), and yellow cotyledons (G) are dominant to green (g). A tall pea plant with yellow cotyledons was crossed with a tall pea plant with green cotyledons, producing the following progeny: 6 tall, green; 5 tall, yellow; 2 dwarf, yellow; and 2 dwarf, green. The goal is to determine the genotypes of the parents.

### Analysis of the Height Trait (D/d)
Both parents are tall, so their possible genotypes are **DD** or **Dd**. The progeny show a ratio of 11 tall to 4 dwarf (11:4). This ratio is consistent with a 3:1 Mendelian ratio, which occurs when both parents are heterozygous (**Dd × Dd**). This cross produces 75% tall (11/15) and 25% dwarf (4/15) offspring.

### Analysis of the Cotyledon Color Trait (G/g)
Parent 1 has yellow cotyledons, so its genotype is either **GG** or **Gg**. Parent 2 has green cotyledons, so its genotype must be **gg** (homozygous recessive). The progeny show a ratio of 8 green to 7 yellow (8:7), which is close to the expected 1:1 ratio from a **Gg × gg** cross. This confirms that Parent 1 is **Gg** (heterozygous) and Parent 2 is **gg** (homozygous recessive).

### Combining the Results
- Parent 1: **Dd** (tall) and **Gg** (yellow cotyledons) → **DdGg**
- Parent 2: **Dd** (tall) and **gg** (green cotyledons) → **Ddgg**

### Matching with the Options
The correct genotypes of the parents are **DdGg × Ddgg**, which corresponds to **Option G**.
