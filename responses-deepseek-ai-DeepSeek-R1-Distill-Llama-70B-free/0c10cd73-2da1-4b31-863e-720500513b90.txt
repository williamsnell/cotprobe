Okay, I'm trying to figure out this problem about volume flux in laminar flow. So, I remember that when dealing with fluid mechanics, especially at low velocities, things like viscosity and pressure gradients are important. The question is about using the power-product method to rewrite the relationship Q = f(r, μ, dp/dx) in a dimensionless form.

First, I need to recall what the power-product method involves. From what I remember, it's a technique where you express the relationship between variables as a product of each variable raised to some exponent, and then you determine those exponents by ensuring the dimensions balance out.

So the variables given here are Q (volume flux), r (pipe radius), μ (viscosity), and dp/dx (pressure drop per unit length). I need to find a combination of these variables that makes the entire equation dimensionless.

I think I should start by writing each variable in terms of their dimensions. Let me refer to the table provided. 

Looking at the table:
- Volume flux Q has dimensions L^3 T^-1.
- Radius r is a length, so L.
- Viscosity μ is ML^-1 T^-1.
- Pressure drop per unit length, dp/dx, which is pressure divided by length. Pressure has dimensions ML^-1 T^-2, so dividing by L gives ML^-2 T^-2.

So now, I can write each variable in terms of M, L, T.

We want Q as a function of r, μ, and (dp/dx). So the general form would be something like:

Q = k * r^a * μ^b * (dp/dx)^c

Where k is a constant dimensionless factor, and a, b, c are exponents we need to find.

The exponents a, b, c must be chosen such that the entire right-hand side has the same dimensions as Q, which is L^3 T^-1.

Now, let's substitute the dimensions into the equation:

[Q] = [r]^a [μ]^b [dp/dx]^c

Substituting the dimensions:

L^3 T^-1 = (L)^a (ML^-1 T^-1)^b (ML^-2 T^-2)^c

Let's expand the right-hand side:

= L^a * (M^b L^{-b} T^{-b}) ) * (M^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c})

Multiply the terms together:

M^(b + c) L^{a - b - 2c} T^{-b - 2c}

So the dimensions on the right are M^(b+c) L^{a - b -2c} T^{-b -2c}

These must equal Q's dimensions, which are L^3 T^-1. So we can set up equations by equating the exponents for M, L, and T.

For M: b + c = 0 (since Q has no mass dimension)
For L: a - b - 2c = 3
For T: -b - 2c = -1

So now we have a system of three equations:

1. b + c = 0
2. a - b - 2c = 3
3. -b - 2c = -1

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 1: c = -b

Substitute c = -b into equation 3:

-b -2*(-b) = -1
-b + 2b = -1
b = -1

Wait, that would mean b is negative. Let me check that again.

Wait equation 3 is: -b -2c = -1

Substituting c = -b from equation 1 into equation 3:

-b -2*(-b) = -1
=> -b +2b = -1
=> b = -1

So b is -1.

Then from equation 1: c = -b = -(-1) = 1.

Now, substitute b and c into equation 2:

a - (-1) - 2*(1) =3
=> a +1 -2 =3
=> a -1 =3
=> a=4

So the exponents are a=4, b=-1, c=1.

So putting this into the equation:

Q = k * r^4 * μ^(-1) * (dp/dx)^1

Which simplifies to Q = k * (r^4 / μ) * (dp/dx)

Wait, but looking at the answer options, let me see which option matches this form.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Q = (const) (r^3/μ) (dp/dx)
Option H: (r^4/μ) (dp/dx)

Wait, according to our exponents, it's (r^4 / μ) * (dp/dx), because a=4, b=-1. So the term is r^4 * μ^(-1) * (dp/dx). So that's (r^4 / μ) * (dp/dx).

Looking at the options, let's scan each.

Option C: (r^3/μ) (dp/dx) → r^3, no.

Option H: (r^4/μ) (dp/dx) → yes, that's what we got.

Wait, but wait, what about the exponents? Let's double-check the equations.

Wait, initial substitution:

[Q] = [r]^a [μ]^b [dp/dx]^c.

Which gives:

L^3 T^-1 = L^a * (M^b L^{-b} T^{-b}) ) * (M^c L^{-2c} T^{-2c} )

So for M: b + c =0 → c = -b.

For L: a -b -2c =3.

For T: -b -2c =-1.

Wait, substituting c = -b into the T equation:

(-b) -2*(-b) = -1 → -b +2b = -1 → b = -1.

Then c = 1.

So a - (-1) - 2*(1) =3 → a +1 -2 =3 → a=4.

So yes, exponents are correct.

So the equation is Q = const * (r^4 / μ) * (dp/dx).

Looking at the options, option H is Q = (const) (r^4/μ) (dp/dx). So that's option H.

Wait, but looking again, I think I made a mistake because in the original problem, the volume flux Q is given, and the functional relationship is Q = f(r, μ, dp/dx). The actual formula I remember for laminar flow (Poiseuille's law) is Q = (π r^4 ΔP)/(8 μ L), where ΔP is the pressure drop over length L. So if dp/dx is ΔP/L, then Q = (π r^4 (dp/dx))/(8 μ). So that would be Q = (const) (r^4 / μ) (dp/dx). Which matches option H.

So the correct answer should be option C? Wait no, option C has r^3. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (μ/r^4)(dp/dx) → That's μ multiplied, which would make the dimensions wrong.

B: r/μ (dp/dx) → r^1.

C: r^3/μ (dp/dx) → r^3.

H: r^4/μ (dp/dx) → r^4.

So according to both the dimensional analysis and the physical formula, it's option C or H?

Wait, Poiseuille's formula: Q = (π r^4 ΔP)/(8 μ L). So when you write ΔP/L as (dp/dx), then Q = (π/8) (r^4 dp/dx) / μ. So that would be Q = const * (r^4/μ) (dp/dx). So that's option H.

So the correct answer is option C? No, option H.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is r^3, option H is r^4. So according to the calculation, the correct option is H.

To solve the problem, we use the power-product method to express the relationship \( Q = f(r, \mu, dp/dx) \) in dimensionless form. The variables and their dimensions are:

- \( Q \) (volume flux): \( L^3 T^{-1} \)
- \( r \) (pipe radius): \( L \)
- \( \mu \) (viscosity): \( ML^{-1}T^{-1} \)
- \( dp/dx \) (pressure drop per unit length): \( ML^{-2}T^{-2} \)

We assume the general form:

\[
Q = k \cdot r^a \cdot \mu^b \cdot (dp/dx)^c
\]

where \( k \) is a dimensionless constant, and \( a, b, c \) are exponents to be determined. Substituting the dimensions of each variable:

\[
L^3 T^{-1} = (L)^a \cdot (ML^{-1}T^{-1})^b \cdot (ML^{-2}T^{-2})^c
\]

Expanding and combining terms:

\[
L^3 T^{-1} = M^{b+c} \cdot L^{a - b - 2c} \cdot T^{-b - 2c}
\]

Equating the exponents for \( M \), \( L \), and \( T \), we get:

1. For \( M \): \( b + c = 0 \)
2. For \( L \): \( a - b - 2c = 3 \)
3. For \( T \): \( -b - 2c = -1 \)

From equation 1: \( c = -b \). Substituting \( c = -b \) into equation 3:

\[
-b - 2(-b) = -1 \implies -b + 2b = -1 \implies b = -1
\]

Then, \( c = -b = 1 \). Substituting \( b = -1 \) and \( c = 1 \) into equation 2:

\[
a - (-1) - 2(1) = 3 \implies a + 1 - 2 = 3 \implies a = 4
\]

Thus, the exponents are \( a = 4 \), \( b = -1 \), and \( c = 1 \). Substituting these into the general form:

\[
Q = k \cdot r^4 \cdot \mu^{-1} \cdot (dp/dx) \implies Q = k \cdot \frac{r^4}{\mu} \cdot (dp/dx)
\]

This matches the form \( Q = \text{const} \cdot \frac{r^4}{\mu} \cdot (dp/dx) \), which corresponds to **Option H**.
