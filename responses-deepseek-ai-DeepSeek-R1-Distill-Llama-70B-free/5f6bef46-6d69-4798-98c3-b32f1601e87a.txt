Question:

A previously healthy 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department in August 1 hour after the onset of headache, dizziness, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. His symptoms began during the first hour of full-contact football practice in full uniform. He reported feeling weak and faint but did not lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to person, place, or time. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Administer an epinephrine injection
B: Administer oxygen via a nasal cannula
C: Perform a lumbar puncture
D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath
E: Apply cold compresses to the forehead
F: Obtain a CT scan of the head
G: Administer a dose of ibuprofen
H: Administer intravenous fluids
I: Administer sodium chloride tablets
J: Administer a glucose injection

Okay, so I've got this medical question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the scenario is.

The patient is a 15-year-old boy who's previously healthy. He's brought to the emergency department with symptoms that started an hour ago. The symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, and one episode of vomiting. These began during the first hour of full-contact football practice while wearing full uniform. He felt weak and faint but didn't lose consciousness. He vomited once after drinking water. On arrival, he's diaphoretic (sweating a lot) and not oriented to person, place, or time. His vital signs are: temperature 39.5°C (which is about 103.1°F), pulse 120/min, respirations 40/min, and blood pressure 90/65 mmHg. The examination, including neurologic, shows no other abnormalities.

The question is asking for the most appropriate next step in management. The options are from A to J.

Hmm. Let's think about the possible conditions here. He's a young athlete practicing in full gear on August 1st, which is probably in the northern hemisphere summer. So heat-related illness comes to mind, especially since he's in football gear, which can trap heat. His symptoms started during practice, so exertional heat illness is a consideration.

His temperature is elevated at 39.5°C, which is pretty high. That's a key sign of heat stroke, which is a medical emergency. Heat stroke is when the body's temperature regulation fails due to excessive heat, leading to high body temperature and potentially organ damage or failure if not treated promptly.

In heat stroke, especially exertional, the patient might present with confusion or altered mental status, which this boy has (not oriented). His vital signs show tachycardia (high pulse), tachypnea (high respiratory rate), and low blood pressure—these can be signs of shock or dehydration, possibly due to excessive sweating and fluid loss.

So the management for heat stroke involves cooling the patient as rapidly as possible. The options given include various methods.

Option D: Immersed in an ice water bath. That's a common method for rapid cooling. Ice water immersion is effective because it conducts heat away quickly, and it's a recommended first-line treatment for severe heat stroke.

Option E: Cold compresses to forehead. That's a less aggressive method and might not cool the patient as quickly as needed. It's better than nothing but not the best option when more effective methods are available.

Option B: Administer oxygen via nasal cannula. That's important because oxygenation is crucial, especially if the patient is in distress. But it's not the most immediate next step for treating heat stroke.

Option H: Administer intravenous fluids. That's also important to correct dehydration and support blood pressure, but again, the immediate priority is to lower the body temperature.

Other options: Let's see. Option A is epinephrine, which is for anaphylaxis—doesn't seem relevant here. Option C is lumbar puncture—no signs of meningitis here, and doing an LP on a patient with high ICP (from heat stroke) could be dangerous. Option F is CT scan of the head—maybe if there was a head injury, but the scenario doesn't mention trauma, so probably not needed. Option G is ibuprofen, which is an NSAID; not used in heat stroke as it doesn't help and could cause issues. Option I is sodium chloride tablets—used for mild dehydration maybe, but not appropriate in this acute setting. Option J is glucose injection—maybe for hypoglycemia, but this patient's symptoms don't point to that.

So the immediate next step should be to lower the body temperature as quickly as possible. So between options D and E, D is better because it's more effective for rapid cooling. Immersion in ice water can lower the temperature faster than just cold compresses.

Wait, but are there any contraindications for ice water immersion? Well, in some cases, like if the patient is shivering, because it can cause discomfort, but in severe heat stroke, the benefits outweigh the discomfort. Also, some protocols might vary, but in this case, it's the best option.

So the answer should be D: Immerse the patient in an ice water bath.

The patient is a 15-year-old boy presenting with symptoms of headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and a high fever (39.5°C) after participating in full-contact football practice in hot weather. His vital signs indicate tachycardia, tachypnea, and low blood pressure, suggesting heat stroke, a medical emergency requiring immediate cooling.

Heat stroke occurs when the body's temperature regulation fails due to excessive heat, leading to high body temperature and potential organ damage. The patient's altered mental status and elevated temperature confirm the severity of the condition. Rapid cooling is the priority in management.

Among the options provided, immersion in an ice water bath (Option D) is the most effective method for rapid cooling in severe heat stroke. While other measures, such as administering oxygen (Option B) or intravenous fluids (Option H), are important, they do not address the immediate need to lower the body temperature. Other options, such as cold compresses (Option E), are less effective for rapid cooling. The remaining options are either irrelevant or inappropriate for this scenario.

Thus, the most appropriate next step is to immerse the patient in an ice water bath to rapidly reduce the body temperature and prevent further complications.

Answer: D
