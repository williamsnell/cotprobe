Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit new to economics, so I'll take it step by step. So, the question is about finding the current deficit and the full employment deficit, then comparing them and determining if the current budget is expansionary or contractionary.

First, let me list the given data:

- Households save 10% of their income.
- Current income tax burden is 25%.
- Planned investments are $60 billion.
- Trade deficit is $2.5 billion.
- Government expenditures are $270 billion.
- Full capacity GNP is $1,060 billion.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly each term means. Let me clarify.

I remember that in economics, the government's budget deficit (or surplus) is calculated as government spending minus tax revenues. If spending is higher than revenues, it's a deficit; if lower, a surplus.

But wait, the question mentions both the current deficit and the full employment deficit. I think the current deficit is the actual deficit right now, whereas the full employment deficit is what the deficit would be if the economy were at full employment (full capacity GNP). That makes sense because at full employment, certain variables like income, savings, and tax revenues might change.

So, to find the current deficit, I need to compute Government Expenditures (G) minus Tax Revenues (T). But wait, how do I find the tax revenues?

The problem gives the current income tax burden as 25%. I think that refers to the tax rate. So, the tax revenues would be 25% of the current income. But wait, what's the current income? Hmm, the problem doesn't directly give the current GNP or GDP. It gives the full capacity GNP as $1,060 billion, but I don't know the current GNP. Oh wait, maybe I can figure it out using the saving rate?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The tax burden is 25%, so T = 0.25 * Y, where Y is the current income (GNP). But without Y, how can I find T?

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to calculate Y using other given information. Let me think: we have planned investments, trade deficit, and the saving rate.

I recall the formula for the equilibrium level of income in an open economy. The formula is Y = C + I + G + (X - M), where X is exports and M is imports. But since the trade deficit is given as $2.5 billion, that's (M - X) = 2.5. So, net exports (X - M) would be -2.5.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the saving-investment equality. In a closed economy, S = I, but in an open economy, S = I + (X - M). Wait, but here the trade deficit is M - X = 2.5, so X - M = -2.5.

So, S = I + (X - M). Let's plug in the numbers.

Households save 10% of their income, so S = 0.10 * Y.

Planned investments I are $60 billion.

So, 0.10 Y = 60 + (-2.5) => 0.10 Y = 57.5 => Y = 57.5 / 0.10 = 575 billion.

Wait, that seems low because the full capacity GNP is $1,060 billion. So the current Y is 575 billion, which is way below full capacity. That makes sense, so the economy is not at full employment.

Now, with Y = 575 billion, the tax revenues T would be 25% of Y, so T = 0.25 * 575 = 143.75 billion.

Then, the current deficit is G - T. G is given as 270 billion.

So current deficit = 270 - 143.75 = 126.25 billion. Wait, that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach. Maybe the formula for the budget deficit is (G - T) = (S - I) + (M - X). I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The budget deficit is G - T. But how do I find T?

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the full employment deficit by adjusting the current revenues to what they would be at full employment.

Wait, let me try again.

First, find the current deficit. G is 270 billion. T is 0.25 * Y, but Y is not given. So I need to find Y first.

Wait, the saving rate is 10%, so S = 0.10 Y.

In an open economy, the equation is Y = C + I + G + (X - M).

But I can also relate S to I and the trade balance. So S = I + (X - M). Since (X - M) = -2.5, S = I - 2.5.

So, S = 60 - 2.5 = 57.5 billion.

But S is also 0.10 Y, so 0.10 Y = 57.5 => Y = 575 billion.

So current Y is 575 billion. Then, T = 0.25 * 575 = 143.75.

So current deficit is G - T = 270 - 143.75 = 126.25 billion. But none of the options are that high. The highest option is G, 35 billion. Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating Y. Let me think again. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium condition for Y is when Y = C + I + G + (X - M).

But C is consumption, which is Y - T - S. Because households receive income Y, pay taxes T, save S, and consume the rest.

So, C = Y - T - S.

But S = 0.10 Y, T = 0.25 Y.

So, C = Y - 0.25 Y - 0.10 Y = 0.65 Y.

Now, substituting into Y = C + I + G + (X - M):

Y = 0.65 Y + 60 + 270 + (-2.5)

Y = 0.65 Y + 60 + 270 -2.5

Calculate the constants: 60 + 270 = 330; 330 - 2.5 = 327.5.

So, Y = 0.65 Y + 327.5

Subtract 0.65 Y from both sides: Y - 0.65 Y = 327.5 => 0.35 Y = 327.5

So Y = 327.5 / 0.35 = let's calculate that. 327.5 divided by 0.35.

0.35 times 900 is 315. 327.5 - 315 is 12.5. 0.35 * 35.714 (approx) = 12.5. So Y ≈ 935.714 billion.

Wait, that's different from the 575 I got earlier. So where did I go wrong before?

Ah, I think I confused the formulas. The earlier approach where S = I + (X - M) was incorrect because that's only in a closed economy. Wait no, in an open economy, S = I + (X - M). So, let's check that.

If S = I + (X - M), then S = 60 + (-2.5) = 57.5 billion.

Which would mean 0.10 Y = 57.5 => Y = 575 billion.

But that contradicts the other approach where Y is 935.7 billion.

Hmm, so which one is correct?

I think the correct approach is using the full Y equation because the other approach might be missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, let's think again. In an open economy, Y = C + I + G + (X - M).

But C is Y - T - S.

So Y = (Y - T - S) + I + G + (X - M)

Substituting T = 0.25 Y and S = 0.10 Y:

Y = (Y - 0.25 Y - 0.10 Y) + I + G + (X - M)

Simplify: Y = 0.65 Y + I + G + (X - M)

Bring 0.65 Y to the left: Y - 0.65 Y = I + G + (X - M)

0.35 Y = I + G + (X - M)

We have I = 60, G = 270, (X - M) = -2.5.

So, 0.35 Y = 60 + 270 - 2.5 = 327.5

Thus, Y = 327.5 / 0.35 = 935.714 billion.

So Y is approximately 935.714 billion.

Wait, but earlier approach via S = I + (X - M) gave Y = 575. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the S = I + (X - M) approach is correct only under certain conditions. Wait, S is supposed to equal I + (X - M) in an open economy. So if S = 0.10 Y = I + (X - M), then 0.10 Y = 60 - 2.5 = 57.5, so Y = 575 billion.

But according to the other approach, Y is 935.7 billion. There's a conflict here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me check again.

In the S = I + (X - M) equation, this comes from the national income accounts: Y = C + I + G + X - M.

But also, Y = C + S + T. So, rearranging, S = Y - C - T.

But substituting C from Y = C + I + G + X - M:

C = Y - I - G - X + M

So S = Y - (Y - I - G - X + M) - T

Simplify: S = I + G + X - M - T.

Wait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should just stick with the Y equation I derived, which gives Y = 935.714 billion.

But then, using that Y, S would be 0.10 * 935.714 ≈ 93.571 billion.

But according to S = I + (X - M), S should be 57.5 billion. So that's inconsistent.

Wait, this means that perhaps the S = I + (X - M) approach is incorrect in this context. Maybe because we're including taxes and government expenditure, it's better to use the Y equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was wrong. Maybe I should proceed with Y = 935.714 billion.

So, tax revenues T = 0.25 * Y = 0.25 * 935.714 ≈ 233.928 billion.

Government expenditures G = 270 billion.

So current deficit is G - T = 270 - 233.928 ≈ 36.071 billion.

Hmm, looking at the options, option G is $35 billion, which is close. So maybe the current deficit is approximately $35 billion.

Wait, but let me calculate more precisely. Y = 327.5 / 0.35 = exactly 935.7142857 billion.

So T = 0.25 * 935.7142857 = 233.9285714 billion.

G is 270, so deficit is 270 - 233.9285714 ≈ 36.07142857 billion.

Which is about $36.07 billion. The closest option is G: $35 billion.

Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a miscalculation.

Wait, 0.35 Y = 327.5 → Y = 327.5 / 0.35.

Let me compute 327.5 ÷ 0.35:

0.35 × 935 = 327.5? Let's check:

0.35 × 900 = 315.

0.35 × 35 = 12.25.

So 0.35 × 935 = 315 + 12.25 = 327.25. Close to 327.5. So Y ≈ 935.714.

So T is 0.25 × 935.714 ≈ 233.9285.

Deficit: 270 - 233.9285 ≈ 36.0715.

So about $36.07 billion. The options don't have exactly that, but option G is $35 billion, which is the closest.

Now, moving on to the full employment deficit. The full employment GNP is given as $1,060 billion.

So, at full employment, Y = 1060 billion.

We need to find the deficit at this Y level, assuming that G remains the same, and T is 25% of Y.

So, T_full = 0.25 × 1060 = 265 billion.

G is still 270 billion.

So full employment deficit is 270 - 265 = 5 billion. But wait, that's a surplus of 5 billion, meaning a deficit of -5 billion. But none of the options are negative, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should calculate the full employment deficit using the same method as before but with Y = 1060.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the structural deficit, which is the deficit that would exist at full employment.

Alternatively, using the same tax rate, T_full = 0.25 × 1060 = 265.

G is 270, so deficit is 270 - 265 = 5 billion. So the full employment deficit is $5 billion.

Wait, but that's a surplus, not a deficit. Hmm.

Wait, but in the current situation, the deficit was $36.07 billion, and at full employment, it's $5 billion surplus. So the full employment deficit is a surplus of $5 billion.

Wait, but the options don't include a negative number or a small positive number. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the concept.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the cyclically adjusted deficit, which is the deficit that would exist at full employment, considering the automatic stabilizers. But that would involve knowing the full employment revenues and expenditures.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the current deficit is G - T_current, and the full employment deficit is G - T_full.

So, T_full = 0.25 × 1060 = 265.

Thus, deficit at full employment is 270 - 265 = 5 billion. That's a surplus, so the deficit would be negative, meaning the budget is in surplus by $5 billion.

Wait, but that doesn't fit any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the current deficit.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate the current deficit.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let's think of the deficit as (G - T). But T is 25% of Y. So, if I can find Y correctly, I can find T and then the deficit.

Earlier, I tried two approaches and got conflicting Y values. Let me think again.

Approach 1: S = I + (X - M)

S = 0.10 Y = 60 - 2.5 = 57.5 → Y = 575.

Approach 2: Y = C + I + G + (X - M)

C = 0.65 Y.

So Y = 0.65 Y + 60 + 270 -2.5 → Y = 0.65 Y + 327.5 → 0.35 Y = 327.5 → Y ≈ 935.71.

But these two can't both be correct. There's an inconsistency. So perhaps the mistake is in assuming that S = I + (X - M). Let me check the correct formula.

In national accounts, Y = C + I + G + X - M.

Also, Y = C + S + T, where T is taxes and S is savings.

So, rearranging, S = Y - C - T.

But substituting C from the first equation:

C = Y - I - G - X + M.

Thus, S = Y - (Y - I - G - X + M) - T → S = I + G + X - M - T.

Wait, that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is S = I + (X - M) when G = T, but that's only in a balanced budget scenario. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach where Y is 935.71 billion is correct because it includes all components.

In that case, the current deficit would be G - T = 270 - (0.25×935.71) ≈ 270 - 233.928 ≈ 36.072 billion.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: $35 billion.

Now, for the full employment deficit, Y is 1060 billion. So T_full = 0.25 × 1060 = 265.

Thus, deficit = 270 - 265 = 5 billion surplus. So the full employment deficit is a surplus of $5 billion.

But the options don't include a surplus, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the full employment deficit differently, perhaps using the same approach as the current deficit calculation, but with Y = 1060.

Wait, let's recalculate using the full Y.

At full employment, Y = 1060.

So, T_full = 0.25 × 1060 = 265 billion.

Thus, the deficit would be G - T_full = 270 - 265 = 5 billion surplus. So the full employment deficit is -5 billion.

But since the question asks for the deficit, perhaps it's a surplus, which is a negative deficit. But the options don't have negative numbers. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe I should compute the structural deficit, which is the deficit that would exist at full employment. That's what I just did, and it's a surplus of $5 billion.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the full employment deficit as a positive number, so it's a deficit of $5 billion, but that doesn't make sense because 270 - 265 is a surplus, not a deficit.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

G is 270 billion. At full employment, T is 0.25 × 1060 = 265. So G - T is 5 billion. Since G > T, it's a deficit, but wait, 270 - 265 is 5, which is a deficit of $5 billion. Wait, that's correct. So the full employment deficit is $5 billion.

Wait, but 270 is greater
