Question:

A defendant is on trial for attempted murder. The alleged victim is called by the prosecution to testify. During her testimony, the victim recounted the incident and described how the defendant savagely beat her with a baseball bat. She was not asked by the prosecution whether she made any statements during the attack. After the victim was excused and left the witness stand, the prosecution called another witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this. "Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's proffered testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a statement of then existing condition.
B: inadmissible, because it is a statement of opinion rather than fact.
C: inadmissible, because the victim did not make the statement under oath.
D: inadmissible, because the victim was not questioned about the statement before being excused.
E: admissible as a present sense impression.
F: inadmissible because the witness was not present during the attack.
G: admissible as an excited utterance.
H: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
I: admissible as a statement against interest.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is a trial for attempted murder. The prosecution called the victim to testify, and she described the incident where the defendant beat her with a baseball bat. However, the prosecution didn't ask her if she made any statements during the attack. After she left the stand, the prosecution called another witness who wants to testify that when the beating stopped, the victim screamed, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this." The defense objects, and we need to determine if this testimony is admissible.

Hmm, so the key issue here is whether the victim's statement is admissible under a hearsay exception. Because the witness is testifying about what the victim said, that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Let me recall the hearsay exceptions. There's the present sense impression, excited utterance, statement against interest, and statements about then-existing conditions, among others.

The statement in question is, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this." The first part, "I'm dying," seems like it could relate to her physical condition. The second part is more of a request or accusation.

So, the first part might qualify under the statement of then-existing condition (under FRE 803(3)), which allows statements about the declarant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. But wait, does that apply here? The statement "I'm dying" indicates her physical condition at the time, so that part could fit. But what about the second part, "Don't let the defendant get away with this"? That seems more like a statement about a past event or an accusation, which might not fit under the same exception.

Alternatively, could this be an excited utterance? Excited utterances (FRE 803(2)) are statements made under the stress of a startling event or condition. The victim was just beaten and is screaming, so that's a high-stress situation. So the entire statement could be admissible as an excited utterance because it was made immediately after the attack while she was under the stress of the event.

Wait, but the timing matters. The beating stopped, and then she made the statement. How much time passed? If it was right after, then it's probably under stress. But if there was a significant delay, maybe not. Since the question says when the beating stopped, implying it's immediately after, so the stress of the event is still present.

Another possibility is present sense impression, which is a statement describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter (FRE 803(1)). But in this case, the statement is not describing the event itself; it's more about her condition and a request. So maybe not present sense.

What about statement against interest (FRE 804(b)(3))? That applies when the declarant is unavailable, and the statement is against their interest. But here, the victim is available because she testified. So that exception doesn't apply.

So the main options are excited utterance or statement of existing condition. The statement has two parts: one about her condition, and another about the defendant. The "I'm dying" part could be a statement of existing condition, but the second part is more of an accusation.

But under the excited utterance exception, the entire statement can be admitted if it was made under stress. The idea is that statements made in the heat of the moment are reliable. So even if part of the statement is about her condition and the other is an accusation, as a whole, it's admissible as an excited utterance.

Wait, but in some cases, courts might split the statement. The part about dying could be admissible under a different exception, and the other part as excited utterance. But I think the entire statement can come in as an excited utterance because it's all part of the same utterance made under stress.

Looking at the answer options:

A: Admissible as a statement of then existing condition. That would only cover part of the statement, but maybe the whole is allowed? Or perhaps the second part isn't covered under this exception.

E: Admissible as a present sense impression. I don't think so because it's not describing the event as it's happening.

G: Admissible as an excited utterance. This seems likely because the statement was made right after the attack, under stress.

H: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. If no exception applies, then H would be correct, but I think an exception does apply.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but another thought: the second part of the statement, "Don't let the defendant get away with this," could be considered a non-hearsay statement if it's not being offered for the truth of the matter, but that's probably not the case here. The prosecution is likely offering it to prove that the defendant committed the crime, so it's for the truth, making it hearsay.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is a dying declaration, but that requires the declarant to believe their death was imminent. However, the victim in this case survived, as she testified, so that exception doesn't apply.

So the main applicable exception is excited utterance. Therefore, the answer should be G.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the victim, "I'm dying. Don't let the defendant get away with this," under a hearsay exception. The key analysis focuses on whether the statement qualifies as an excited utterance under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 803(2). 

The statement was made immediately after the beating stopped, indicating it was made while the victim was still under the stress of the attack. This satisfies the requirement for an excited utterance, as the statement was made in the heat of the moment without time for fabrication. The first part of the statement, "I'm dying," reflects her physical condition, and the second part, "Don't let the defendant get away with this," is an accusation made in the same context. Together, the entire statement is admissible as an excited utterance because it was made under the stress of the startling event.

Other potential exceptions, such as present sense impression or statement of then-existing condition, are less applicable. Present sense impression requires the statement to describe an event while it is happening or immediately thereafter, which does not fully capture the nature of the victim's statement. Similarly, the statement of then-existing condition would only cover the first part of the statement, not the entire utterance. The statement against interest exception does not apply because the victim is available to testify.

Given that the statement was made under the stress of the attack, the entire utterance qualifies as an excited utterance, making it admissible under FRE 803(2).
