Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, based on that, I'll choose the correct option from A to J. 

Statement 1 says: "A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian." Hmm, factor groups. I remember that a factor group (or quotient group) is formed by partitioning a group into cosets of a normal subgroup. The structure of the factor group depends on the original group and the normal subgroup.

So, if G is a non-Abelian group and N is a normal subgroup of G, then G/N is the factor group. The question is whether G/N must be non-Abelian. I'm trying to think of examples. For instance, take G as S3, the symmetric group on 3 elements. S3 is non-Abelian. Let's consider N as the subgroup generated by a 3-cycle, say (123). Since S3 has elements of order 3, and this subgroup is normal in S3 because it's of order 3 and S3's order is 6, so index 2, which should make it normal (since subgroups of index 2 are normal).

Now, what's S3/N? The order of S3 is 6, and N has order 3, so S3/N has order 2. A group of order 2 is cyclic and therefore Abelian. So here's a case where G is non-Abelian, and G/N is Abelian. So Statement 1 is false. Because the factor group can be Abelian even if the original group is non-Abelian.

Okay, so Statement 1 is false. That narrows down the options. Let's look at the possible answers. The options are A through J, and each is a combination of whether each statement is true, false, or not determinable.

Now onto Statement 2: "If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G." Hmm, this sounds familiar. I think this is about the transitivity of normal subgroups. Wait, isn't normality not necessarily transitive? Or is it? Let me think.

I remember that normality isn't generally transitive. So even if K is normal in H and H is normal in G, K isn't necessarily normal in G. Let me think of a counterexample. 

I remember that in S4 (the symmetric group on 4 elements), the group A4 (the alternating group) is a normal subgroup of S4. Now, consider a subgroup of A4, like the Klein 4-group V. V is normal in A4 because it's the unique subgroup of order 4, and A4 has no elements of order 4, so any automorphism of A4 would fix V. So V is normal in A4, and A4 is normal in S4. But is V normal in S4? I think not. Because in S4, there are elements that can conjugate elements of V into other subgroups, so V isn't normal in S4. So this would be a case where K=V is normal in H=A4, which is normal in G=S4, but K is not normal in G. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I should check if I got that right. Alternatively, another example: Let G be S3, H be the subgroup generated by a transposition (say, (12)), which is of order 2. H is normal in G? Wait, no, because in S3, a subgroup of order 2 is not normal. Because S3 has several subgroups of order 2, and they're not all conjugate, so they can't be normal. Hmm, perhaps that's not a good example.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. Let me think that in general, the statement is false. Here's another example: Take G as the dihedral group D4 (order 8), H as the cyclic subgroup of order 4, which is normal in D4. Then K is a subgroup of H of order 2. Now, is K normal in D4? Well, H is cyclic of order 4, so it has a unique subgroup of order 2, which is K. So K is normal in H. But in D4, is K normal? Because D4 has elements that can rotate the square in different ways. If we take an element of D4 not in H and conjugate K, does it stay the same? Well, in D4, the center is of order 2, which is K, but perhaps K is also normal in D4. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example.

Alternatively, let's go back to S4 and A4. A4 has a normal subgroup V (the Klein four-group). Since A4 is normal in S4, but V is not normal in S4 because, for example, conjugating by an odd permutation (like a transposition) would take elements of V to other elements outside V. So in S4, V is not normal.

So Statement 2 is false. Wait, wait, but I should think more carefully. Because for K to be normal in G, it must satisfy that for every g in G, gKg^{-1} is a subgroup of G, right? So if K is normal in H and H is normal in G, does that imply K is normal in G? I think not necessarily. Because an element of G not in H might not conjugate K into itself.

So Statement 2 is false. So both statements are false? Let's check.

Wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine each statement.

Statement 1: Factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian. No, as in the S3 example, the factor group was Abelian (order 2). So Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: If K is normal in H and H is normal in G, then K is normal in G. This is a classic result in group theory. I think the correct statement is that if K is normal in G and H is a subgroup of G, then K âˆ© H is normal in H. But the other way around, normality doesn't transit upwards beyond that. So yes, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but I think I remember that normality is not transitive. So, the statement is false. So both statements are false.

Looking back at the options, the options are about whether each statement is true or false. So Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 is false. So looking at the options, option A is "False, False". So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me think again about the second statement. I might have made a mistake. Because in some cases, if H is normal in G and K is characteristic in H, then K is normal in G. Because characteristic subgroups are preserved under automorphisms, including those induced by conjugation in G. So if K is a characteristic subgroup of H, and H is normal in G, then K is normal in G. But the statement doesn't say that K is characteristic in H, just that it's normal. So, in general, Statement 2 is false. Because K being normal in H doesn't imply K is normal in G unless K is characteristic in H.

So yes, Statement 2 is indeed false. So both statements are false. So the correct option is A: False, False.

To evaluate the two statements, we analyze each one carefully:

### Statement 1: "A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian."
A factor group (or quotient group) \( G/N \) is formed by partitioning a group \( G \) into cosets of a normal subgroup \( N \). The statement claims that if \( G \) is non-Abelian, then \( G/N \) must also be non-Abelian. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider \( G = S_3 \) (the symmetric group on 3 elements), which is non-Abelian, and let \( N \) be the subgroup generated by a 3-cycle, such as \( (123) \). The factor group \( S_3/N \) has order 2, which is cyclic and therefore Abelian. This counterexample shows that a factor group of a non-Abelian group can be Abelian. Hence, **Statement 1 is false**.

### Statement 2: "If \( K \) is a normal subgroup of \( H \) and \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \), then \( K \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \)."
This statement concerns the transitivity of normality. Normality is not generally transitive. Even if \( K \) is normal in \( H \) and \( H \) is normal in \( G \), \( K \) is not necessarily normal in \( G \). A classic counterexample involves \( G = S_4 \) (the symmetric group on 4 elements), \( H = A_4 \) (the alternating group on 4 elements), and \( K = V \) (the Klein 4-group). Here, \( V \) is normal in \( A_4 \), and \( A_4 \) is normal in \( S_4 \), but \( V \) is not normal in \( S_4 \). This demonstrates that **Statement 2 is false**.

### Conclusion:
Both statements are false. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: False, False**
