Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Poisson random variables. Hmm, I remember that Poisson distributions are used for events happening at a constant rate, like the number of emails I get in an hour or something. Anyway, the question is about two independent Poisson variables, X1 and X2, with means λ1=2 and λ2=3 respectively. I need to find the probability that X1 equals 3 and X2 equals 5, so P(X1=3, X2=5).

Wait, the hint says something about this event occurring if and only if {X1=1, X2=0} or {X1=0, X2=1}. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe that's about the difference or something else. Oh wait, maybe the hint is for a different part of the problem, not part (a). Because part (a) is straightforward, right? It's just the joint probability since they're independent.

Okay, so for Poisson distributions, the probability mass function is P(X=k) = (λ^k e^{-λ}) / k!. Since X1 and X2 are independent, the joint probability P(X1=3, X2=5) is just the product of their individual probabilities.

So I should calculate P(X1=3) and P(X2=5) separately and multiply them.

Let me compute P(X1=3) first. λ1 is 2. So that's (2^3 * e^{-2}) / 3!. 2^3 is 8, e^{-2} is about 0.1353, and 3! is 6. So 8 * 0.1353 is approximately 1.0824. Divide by 6 gives around 0.1804.

Wait, let me calculate it exactly. 8 divided by 6 is 4/3, so 4/3 * e^{-2}. Oh wait, but 8/6 is 4/3, so 4/3 * e^{-2} is (4/3) * 0.1353... Let me compute that. 4/3 is about 1.3333. 1.3333 * 0.1353 ≈ 0.1804. So P(X1=3) is approximately 0.1804.

Now P(X2=5). λ2 is 3. So (3^5 * e^{-3}) / 5!. 3^5 is 243. e^{-3} is about 0.0498. So 243 * 0.0498 is... let's see, 240 *0.0498 is about 11.952, and 3 *0.0498 is 0.1494, so total is about 12.1014. Then divide by 5! which is 120. So 12.1014 / 120 ≈ 0.1008.

Wait, let me check that calculation again because 3^5 is 243, yes. So 243 * e^{-3} is 243 * 0.049787, which is approximately 12.103. Then 12.103 divided by 120 is about 0.10086. So P(X2=5) is roughly 0.10086.

Now, since X1 and X2 are independent, the joint probability is the product of these two. So 0.1804 * 0.10086 ≈ 0.01821.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.0182, which is very close. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing the exact calculation without approximations. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute P(X1=3) exactly. Using the Poisson formula: (2^3 e^{-2}) / 3! = (8 e^{-2}) / 6 = (4 e^{-2}) / 3. e^{-2} is approximately 0.135335283. So 4 * 0.135335283 = 0.541341132. Divide by 3: 0.541341132 / 3 ≈ 0.18044704.

P(X2=5): (3^5 e^{-3}) / 5! = (243 e^{-3}) / 120. e^{-3} is about 0.049787068. 243 * 0.049787068 = Let's compute that. 200 * 0.049787 is 9.9574, 40 *0.049787 is 1.99148, 3 *0.049787 is 0.14936. Adding them: 9.9574 +1.99148=11.94888 + 0.14936=12.09824. Then divide by 120: 12.09824 / 120 ≈ 0.1008053.

Now multiply the two: 0.18044704 * 0.1008053. Let me compute that. 0.18 * 0.1 is 0.018, 0.00044704 * 0.1008 is about 0.000045, 0.18 * 0.0008053 is about 0.000145, and 0.00044704 * 0.0008053 is negligible. So adding up, 0.018 + 0.000045 + 0.000145 ≈ 0.01819. So approximately 0.01819, which rounds to 0.0182. So option E is correct.

To solve the problem, we need to find the joint probability \( P(X_1=3, X_2=5) \) where \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent Poisson random variables with means \( \lambda_1=2 \) and \( \lambda_2=3 \), respectively. Since the variables are independent, the joint probability is the product of their individual probabilities.

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(X_1=3) \)
The probability mass function for a Poisson random variable is given by:
\[
P(X=k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
\]
For \( X_1=3 \), we have:
\[
P(X_1=3) = \frac{2^3 e^{-2}}{3!} = \frac{8 e^{-2}}{6} = \frac{4 e^{-2}}{3}
\]
Using \( e^{-2} \approx 0.1353 \):
\[
P(X_1=3) \approx \frac{4 \cdot 0.1353}{3} \approx 0.1804
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(X_2=5) \)
For \( X_2=5 \), we have:
\[
P(X_2=5) = \frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} = \frac{243 e^{-3}}{120}
\]
Using \( e^{-3} \approx 0.0498 \):
\[
P(X_2=5) \approx \frac{243 \cdot 0.0498}{120} \approx 0.1008
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the joint probability
Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent, the joint probability is:
\[
P(X_1=3, X_2=5) = P(X_1=3) \cdot P(X_2=5)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(X_1=3, X_2=5) \approx 0.1804 \cdot 0.1008 \approx 0.0182
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated probability is **E: 0.0182**.
