Question:

Each year, the local boys' and girls' club sponsors a "Baseball Card Bonanza. " During the three- day event, collectors of baseball cards gather, exchanging and swapping old cards. A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.
B: Yes, because the collector used his knowledge of the card's value to exploit the boy.
C: Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.
D: Yes, because the collector took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge about the card's value.
E: No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.
F: No, because the boy willingly accepted the offer made by the collector.
G: Yes, because the collector was obligated to disclose the true value of the card.
H: No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.
I: No, because the boy had the opportunity to decline the collector's offer.
J: No, because the collector didn't force the boy to sell the card.

Okay, so I've got this question here about a legal scenario involving a boy, a girl, and a collector at a baseball card event. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.

Alright, the situation is that a 12-year-old boy and girl are at this Baseball Card Bonanza. A 32-year-old collector approaches them and asks to look through their cards. The boy and girl agree. The collector finds a 1948 Branch Rickey card in the boy's collection. Rickey was the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, not a player, so the boy doesn't think it's worth much. The collector knows it's worth over $500 but offers the boy 50 cents. The boy takes it, and the next day finds out it's worth $600. Now, the boy is suing the collector for deceit. The question is whether the boy will prevail.

Hmm, so I need to figure out if the collector's actions constitute deceit, which would make the contract voidable. Deceit involves misrepresentation of a material fact made with intent to deceive, and the victim relies on it to their detriment.

Wait, but did the collector make any false statements? From the facts, the collector offered 50 cents, and the boy accepted. But the collector didn't lie about the card's value. He just offered a low price. The boy thought it wasn't worth much because Rickey wasn't a player. So maybe the collector didn't make any false representations; he just took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge.

In contract law, both parties are expected to negotiate in their own interest. There's no general duty to disclose information unless it's about defects in the item or other specific circumstances. So if the collector didn't lie, just offered a low price, that might not be deceit.

I remember something about mutual mistake or undue influence, but here the boy willingly sold it. The collector didn't force him or make any false claims. So the collector's actions might not meet the criteria for deceit because there was no false representation.

Looking at the answer options:

Option E says no because the collector made no false representations. That seems to fit because the collector didn't lie; he just offered a price. The boy agreed without being forced. So the boy can't claim deceit because there was no misrepresentation.

Other options like B, D, etc., talk about taking advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge, but in law, that's more about undue influence or perhaps unconscionability. However, for deceit, the key is a false statement. Since the collector didn't make any, he didn't commit deceit.

So the correct answer should be E. The boy can't prevail because there were no false representations made by the collector.

The question revolves around whether the boy can successfully claim deceit against the collector. Deceit requires a misrepresentation of a material fact made with intent to deceive, upon which the victim justifiably relies to their detriment. In this scenario, the collector offered the boy 50 cents for a card worth $600, but there is no indication that the collector made any false statements about the card's value. The collector simply took advantage of the boy's lack of knowledge, which, under contract law, does not constitute deceit. There is no general duty to disclose the value of an item unless specific circumstances (e.g., defects) are involved, which is not the case here. Since the collector made no false representations, the boy cannot prevail on a claim of deceit.

The correct answer is:

E: No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.

Answer: E
