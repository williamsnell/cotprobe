Question:

Two brothers who were in need of money approached their wealthy uncle's housekeeper and asked her to poison him. The brothers would inherit the uncle's estate when he died. The housekeeper agreed, but on the condition that they would pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. After the brothers agreed to her demand, the housekeeper decided to place some cyanide in the uncle's tea one morning. As the housekeeper was preparing the tea, the uncle was visited by his personal physician. When the housekeeper was ready to serve the tea, the uncle asked her to fix some tea for his physician also. The housekeeper did so and then carefully set the tea on the table so that the uncle's cup was facing him. However, when the physician reached over to get some sugar, he inadvertently took the uncle's cup with the cyanide and drank it. Seconds later, the physician died from the poison. Which of the following crimes are the brothers guilty of?

Options:

A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
B: Murder of both their uncle and the physician.
C: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
D: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.
E: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle and the physician.
F: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the housekeeper.
G: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.
H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.
I: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle only.
J: Conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and involuntary manslaughter of the physician.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, and I need to figure out which option correctly identifies the crimes the two brothers are guilty of. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. So, there are two brothers in need of money. They approach their wealthy uncle's housekeeper and ask her to poison their uncle. The brothers would inherit the estate when the uncle dies. The housekeeper agrees but only if they pay her $10,000 from their inheritance. They agree, and then the housekeeper puts cyanide in the uncle's tea.

But here's a twist: when the housekeeper is about to serve the tea, the uncle's physician arrives. The uncle asks the housekeeper to make tea for the physician too. She does, and sets the cups out, with the uncle's cup (the one with cyanide) facing him. However, when the physician goes to get sugar, he accidentally takes the uncle's cup and drinks it, dying from the poison.

So, the question is, what crimes are the brothers guilty of?

The options are A through J, each listing different combinations of crimes. I need to determine which one is correct.

Let me think about the legal concepts involved here. The brothers approached the housekeeper to commit a crime—murder. So, they solicited her to murder their uncle. Solicitation is when someone asks another to commit a crime, with the intent that it be done.

Then, the brothers and the housekeeper agreed to work together to commit the murder. That sounds like conspiracy. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to achieve that goal.

Now, the housekeeper acted on that conspiracy by putting cyanide in the uncle's tea. But due to an accident, the physician drank the poisoned tea instead. So, the intended victim was the uncle, but the actual victim is the physician.

I remember that in criminal law, when you intend to kill one person but accidentally kill another, you can still be guilty of murder under the doctrine of transferred intent. But wait, how does that apply here?

Wait, transferred intent applies when the perpetrator intends to kill one person but the act results in the death of another. The intent transfers, so the perpetrator is guilty of murdering the unintended victim. But in this case, the person who actually put the poison was the housekeeper, not the brothers. So, the brothers' liability would depend on their role in the conspiracy.

The brothers conspired with the housekeeper to murder the uncle. So, their conspiracy was to kill the uncle. But the housekeeper's action led to the physician's death. So, how does that affect the brothers' liability?

In conspiracy, you're liable for the crimes you agreed to commit and any foreseeable crimes that are committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. So, if the brothers agreed to murder the uncle, and the housekeeper committed that murder (though the victim was different), the brothers could be liable for the murder under the conspiracy.

Wait, but the intended target was the uncle, but the victim was the physician. Does that matter? Or does the fact that murder was the intended crime mean that the brothers are guilty of murder regardless of who the victim is?

I think the key here is that the brothers entered into a conspiracy to murder their uncle. The housekeeper, acting in furtherance of that conspiracy, committed the act that led to the physician's death. So, under the felony murder rule or the natural and probable consequences doctrine, the brothers could be held liable for the physician's murder because it was a foreseeable result of their conspiracy.

Wait, but the brothers didn't personally commit the murder; they were part of the conspiracy. So, their liability is based on the conspiracy and any crimes committed in furtherance of it.

So, the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit the murder of their uncle. As for the death of the physician, since the housekeeper's act was in furtherance of the conspiracy, the brothers could be guilty of the physician's murder as well. But wait, did they intend to kill anyone else? Or was the physician's death a direct result of their plan?

Alternatively, could the brothers be guilty of attempted murder of the uncle because the housekeeper tried to poison him, but the attempt didn't succeed? But the uncle wasn't harmed, so maybe attempted murder isn't applicable. Wait, no, because the housekeeper did put the poison in the tea, which constitutes an attempt. But the brothers didn't actually carry out the attempt; the housekeeper did. So, as conspirators, they're liable for the attempt as well.

Wait, but the brothers didn't actually commit the act of putting the poison—they conspired with the housekeeper, who then acted. So, the brothers' crimes would include conspiracy to commit murder and perhaps solicitation because they asked the housekeeper to do it.

Let me list what I think the brothers are guilty of:

1. Solicitation: They asked the housekeeper to commit murder. Solicitation is the act of encouraging or requesting someone to commit a crime with the intent that it be committed.

2. Conspiracy: They agreed with the housekeeper to commit the murder of their uncle.

3. Now, for the result. Since the housekeeper acted in furtherance of the conspiracy and caused the death of the physician, the brothers could be guilty of the murder of the physician. Because the act was part of the conspiracy, even though the victim was unintended, the brothers are still liable for the murder.

So, the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder (of the uncle) and murder (of the physician). But wait, looking at the options, let me check.

Option A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.

Wait, but the physician was actually murdered, so attempted murder wouldn't apply. The housekeeper's act resulted in the physician's death, which is murder, not attempted.

Option C: Conspiracy to commit murder of uncle and murder of the physician.

Option H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and murder of the physician.

So, which is correct? Do the brothers get charged with both the conspiracy and the resulting murder?

Yes. Conspiracy is a separate crime from the completed offense. So, if the conspiracy leads to the murder, the conspirators can be guilty of both conspiracy and the murder.

Additionally, the brothers solicited the housekeeper, so they're guilty of solicitation as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H includes solicitation, conspiracy, and murder of the physician. Option C includes conspiracy and murder.

So, the brothers are guilty of solicitation (for asking the housekeeper), conspiracy (agreeing to commit the murder), and murder (because the conspiracy resulted in the physician's death).

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, solicitation merges with conspiracy when the conspiracy is formed. So, if the brothers successfully solicited the housekeeper and a conspiracy was formed, then the solicitation may not be a separate charge. But I'm not sure about that. Some jurisdictions treat solicitation as a separate offense even after a conspiracy is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer includes all three: solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and attempted murder of the physician.

Option H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and murder of the physician.

So, the issue is whether the brothers are guilty of the physician's murder or attempted murder.

The physician died, so it's murder, not attempted. So option A's third item is incorrect, making option H's third item correct.

Therefore, the brothers are guilty of solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.

Wait, but wait a second. The brothers intended to kill their uncle, not the physician. So, under transferred intent, the intent to kill the uncle transfers to the physician, making the housekeeper guilty of murdering the physician. But the brothers are part of the conspiracy, so they would be guilty as well.

So, the brothers are guilty of murder because the act of the housekeeper, done in furtherance of the conspiracy, resulted in murder. So, they're guilty of conspiracy and murder.

But what about solicitation? Do they get charged with that as a separate offense?

Solicitation is the act of asking someone to commit a crime. If the person they solicited agrees and a conspiracy is formed, then solicitation is a separate crime. So, the brothers would be guilty of solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.

Looking back at the options, option H is: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician. So that seems to fit.

Wait, but another angle: the brothers' plan was to murder their uncle. The housekeeper acted, but the victim was someone else. Does that mean the brothers are not guilty of the physician's murder because they didn't intend to kill him?

But in criminal law, when a co-conspirator commits a crime in furtherance of the conspiracy, all conspirators are liable for that crime, even if they didn't specifically intend it, as long as it was a foreseeable consequence.

So, the brothers didn't intend to kill the physician, but the act of putting poison in the tea was part of the conspiracy. The physician's death was a direct result of the housekeeper's action, which was in furtherance of the conspiracy. Therefore, the brothers are guilty of the physician's murder under the conspiracy doctrine.

So, putting it together, the brothers are guilty of solicitation (asking the housekeeper), conspiracy to murder the uncle, and the murder of the physician.

Looking at the options, option H matches that: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle, and murder of the physician.

Wait, but let me double-check. The brothers didn't personally kill anyone. They conspired with the housekeeper, who then committed the murder. So, the brothers are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and, because the conspiracy resulted in a murder, they're guilty of that murder as well. Additionally, they're guilty of solicitation for asking the housekeeper to commit the murder.

So, the correct answer should include all three: solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.

Looking at the options again:

Option H: Solicitation, conspiracy to commit murder of uncle, and murder of the physician.

Yes, that's the one.
</think>

The brothers approached the housekeeper and asked her to poison their uncle, offering her $10,000 from their inheritance. This constitutes **solicitation**, as they requested someone to commit a crime. The brothers and the housekeeper then agreed to work together to commit the murder, forming a **conspiracy to commit murder** of the uncle. 

The housekeeper acted in furtherance of this conspiracy by placing cyanide in the uncle's tea. However, due to an accident, the physician drank the poisoned tea and died. Under the doctrine of **transferred intent**, the housekeeper's intent to kill the uncle transfers to the unintended victim, the physician, making her guilty of murder. As co-conspirators, the brothers are also liable for the physician's murder under the principle that conspirators are guilty of crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, even if the victim was unintended.

Thus, the brothers are guilty of **solicitation**, **conspiracy to commit murder of their uncle**, and **murder of the physician**. Among the options provided, only **Option H** correctly reflects these crimes.

**Answer: H**
