Question:

Ann, Bea, and Carla were three friends who lived in the same neighborhood. While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement?

Options:

A: Since the agreement did not specify the consequences if Bea failed to make the payments, Bea is not liable to Ann.
B: Since Bea had already begun making payments to Ann, there was no valid contract between them.
C: Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.
D: Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
E: Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.
F: Since Ann did not take any legal action against Carla, Bea's promise to repay the debt was unnecessary and thus lacks consideration.
G: Since Ann returned Bea's golf clubs before the agreement was signed, Bea's promise to repay the $4,000 debt lacks consideration.
H: Since Bea had made no oral or written request for Ann's forbearance, Bea's promise to repay the debt lacks consideration.
I: Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
J: Since the statute of limitations on Ann's claim against Carla had expired, Bea's promise to repay the debt is not enforceable.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the situation is about Ann, Bea, and Carla. Ann had her golf clubs stolen, and then borrowed Bea's. She was supposed to return them but didn't. Later, Bea found out Carla owed Ann $4,000 but couldn't pay because she lost her job. So Bea offered to repay the debt on Carla's behalf. They made a written agreement where Bea would pay Ann $400 a month for the $4,000, and Ann would return the golf clubs. 

Now, the key points are that Ann didn't promise in writing or orally to forbear suing Carla. Bea also didn't ask for that. After the agreement, Ann returned the clubs, and Bea made six payments. Then Bea stopped, and Ann sued her. The statute of limitations on Ann's claim against Carla had just expired when Ann sued Bea.

The question is asking which argument is best to say Bea isn't liable under their agreement. The options are A to J.

Hmm, so I need to think about contract law principles here. The main issue is probably about consideration. For a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be considerationâ€”both parties must exchange something of value.

Looking at the agreement, Bea promised to pay $4,000 at $400 a month, and Ann promised to return the golf clubs. But wait, didn't Ann already have a duty to return the clubs? Because she borrowed them from Bea. So if Ann was already supposed to return them, that promise might not count as consideration because it's a pre-existing duty.

So in contract terms, if someone does something they're already legally obligated to do, that doesn't count as consideration. So here, Ann had to return the clubs anyway. So her promise to do so in the agreement with Bea wouldn't be valid consideration for Bea's promise to pay the debt.

Looking at the options, option I says: "Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann." That sounds right.

Wait, but what about the forbearance part? Ann didn't promise to forbear, but she did forbear for six months. But without a promise, does that count? Well, forbearance can be consideration if it's bargained for. But if there's no express or implied promise, maybe it doesn't count. So maybe the consideration was the return of the clubs, but if that's a pre-existing duty, then there's no consideration.

So the main issue is whether Ann's promise to return the clubs was sufficient consideration. Since she was already supposed to return them, that promise doesn't count. Therefore, Bea's promise to pay lacks consideration, making the contract unenforceable.

So the correct answer should be I.

The question revolves around the enforceability of a contract between Ann and Bea, focusing on the concept of consideration in contract law. For a contract to be valid, each party must provide something of legal value. In this case, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, and Bea promised to pay a debt Carla owed to Ann. 

Ann, however, had a pre-existing duty to return the golf clubs, as they were borrowed from Bea. Under contract law, a promise to perform a pre-existing duty does not constitute valid consideration. Therefore, Ann's promise to return the clubs cannot serve as consideration for Bea's promise to pay the debt. Without valid consideration, the contract lacks enforceability.

Option I correctly identifies this issue, stating that Ann's pre-existing duty to return the clubs means there was no consideration for Bea's promise. This makes Option I the most persuasive argument for why Bea is not liable under the agreement.
