Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. An electron is released from rest in a uniform electric field, and I need to calculate its acceleration. Oh, and I should ignore gravity. Alright.

Hmm, I remember that when a charge is placed in an electric field, it experiences a force. Oh right, the formula for the electric force is F = qE, where q is the charge and E is the electric field strength. But wait, since the electron is charged, this force will cause it to accelerate. Oh yeah, Newton's second law comes into play here. F equals mass times acceleration, so F = ma.

So putting these together, the electric force provides the acceleration. That means qE equals ma. So I can solve for acceleration a by rearranging it to a = (qE)/m. Oh, right, because a = F/m and F is qE.

Now, the charge of an electron is a known value. I think it's approximately 1.6 times 10^-19 coulombs. Wait, let me make sure. Yes, elementary charge is about 1.602 x 10^-19 C. So q is 1.6e-19 C.

The electric field E given here is 2.00e4 N/C. So plugging that in, E is 2e4 N/C.

Then the mass of the electron, m. Oh, right, the electron mass is about 9.11 x 10^-31 kilograms. So m is 9.11e-31 kg.

Putting it all together, a = (1.6e-19 C) * (2e4 N/C) / (9.11e-31 kg).

Wait, let me compute that step by step. First calculate the numerator: qE = (1.6e-19) * 2e4. So 1.6 times 2 is 3.2, and the exponents are 1e-19 * 1e4 = 1e-15. So the numerator is 3.2e-15.

Then the denominator is the mass, 9.11e-31 kg. So a = (3.2e-15) / (9.11e-31).

Dividing 3.2 by 9.11 gives approximately 0.351. But wait, let me compute it more accurately. 3.2 divided by 9.11. Let's see, 9.11 goes into 3.2 zero times. So 9.11 into 32 is about 3.5 times? Because 9.11 * 3 is 27.33, which is less than 32. 9.11 *3.5 is about 31.885, which is close to 32. So 3.2 /9.11 is approximately 0.351.

Then the exponents: 1e-15 divided by 1e-31 is 1e16. So putting it all together, 0.351e16, which is 3.51e15 m/s².

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Because 1e-15 divided by 1e-31 is 1e16, right? Because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them. So 10^(-15-(-31))=10^(16). So yeah, that's correct.

So the acceleration a is approximately 3.51e15 m/s².

Looking back at the options, let's see. Option D is 3.51e15 m/s². So that should be the correct answer. Let me just check the options again.

Option D says 3.51 ×10^15 m/s². Yes, that matches.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me recalculate the numbers.

qE: 1.6e-19 * 2e4 = 3.2e-15. Correct.

Mass: 9.11e-31 kg.

So 3.2e-15 / 9.11e-31 = (3.2 /9.11) * 1e( -15 +31 ) )= 0.351 *1e16 = 3.51e15. Yep, that's right.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To calculate the acceleration of an electron in a uniform electric field, we start with the relationship between electric force and acceleration. The electric force on a charge is given by:

\[
F = qE
\]

where \( q \) is the charge of the electron and \( E \) is the electric field strength. According to Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where \( m \) is the mass of the electron and \( a \) is its acceleration. Equating the two expressions for \( F \), we get:

\[
qE = ma \quad \implies \quad a = \frac{qE}{m}
\]

The charge of an electron is \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \), the electric field is \( E = 2.00 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{N/C} \), and the mass of the electron is \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \). Substituting these values into the equation for \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19}) (2.00 \times 10^4)}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
qE = (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) (2.00 \times 10^4) = 3.2 \times 10^{-15}
\]

Next, divide by the mass of the electron:

\[
a = \frac{3.2 \times 10^{-15}}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} = \left( \frac{3.2}{9.11} \right) \times 10^{-15 + 31} = 0.351 \times 10^{16} = 3.51 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{m/s^2}
\]

Thus, the acceleration of the electron is approximately \( 3.51 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{m/s^2} \), which corresponds to option D.
