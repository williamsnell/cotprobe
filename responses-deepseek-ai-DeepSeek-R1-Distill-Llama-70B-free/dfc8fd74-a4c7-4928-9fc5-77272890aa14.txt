Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the total earnings of an employee based on their hourly rate and overtime pay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the employee earns $2.40 per hour normally. But if they work more than 8 hours in a day, they get time and a half for those extra hours. Time and a half means they get 1.5 times their normal rate for the overtime hours.

So the employee worked five days: Monday to Friday. Let me list out the hours each day:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 7 hours
- Wednesday: 9 hours
- Thursday: 9 hours
- Friday: 10 hours

I need to calculate the pay for each day separately and then add them all up.

Starting with Monday: 8 hours. Since it's exactly 8 hours, there's no overtime. So their pay is simply 8 hours * $2.40. Let me calculate that: 8 * 2.40 is $19.20.

Tuesday: 7 hours. That's less than 8, so again, no overtime. 7 * 2.40 equals... let me do the math. 7*2 is 14, and 7*0.4 is 2.8, so 14+2.8 is $16.80.

Wednesday: 9 hours. Here, they worked more than 8, so the first 8 are regular pay, and the extra 1 hour is overtime. So regular pay is 8*2.40 = $19.20. Overtime is 1 * (2.40 * 1.5). Let me compute that: 2.40 * 1.5 is $3.60. So total for Wednesday is 19.20 + 3.60 = $22.80.

Thursday is the same as Wednesday: 9 hours. So same calculation: 8*2.40 = $19.20 and 1*3.60 = $3.60. Total is again $22.80.

Friday: 10 hours. So 8 hours regular and 2 hours overtime. Regular pay: 8*2.40 = $19.20. Overtime is 2 * 3.60 = $7.20. So Friday's total is 19.20 + 7.20 = $26.40.

Now, I'll add up all the daily totals:

Monday: $19.20  
Tuesday: $16.80  
Wednesday: $22.80  
Thursday: $22.80  
Friday: $26.40  

Adding them together step by step:

Start with Monday and Tuesday: 19.20 + 16.80 = $36.00.

Add Wednesday: 36 + 22.80 = $58.80.

Add Thursday: 58.80 + 22.80 = $81.60.

Add Friday: 81.60 + 26.40 = $108.00.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is $108.00. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me recalculate each day quickly:

Monday: 8 * 2.40 = 19.20 ✔️  
Tuesday: 7 * 2.40 = 16.80 ✔️  
Wednesday: 8*2.40=19.20, 1*(3.60)=3.60, total 22.80 ✔️  
Thursday same as Wednesday: 22.80 ✔️  
Friday: 8*2.40=19.20, 2*3.60=7.20, total 26.40 ✔️  
Adding all: 19.2+16.8=36, +22.8=58.8, +22.8=81.6, +26.4=108. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option I is $108.00. So the answer should be I.

To calculate the total earnings of the employee, we break down the pay for each day based on regular hours and overtime (time and a half for hours exceeding 8 per day). The employee earns $2.40 per hour for regular time and $3.60 per hour for overtime.

**Daily Calculations:**

- **Monday:** 8 hours (all regular)  
  Pay: \( 8 \times 2.40 = 19.20 \, \text{USD} \)

- **Tuesday:** 7 hours (all regular)  
  Pay: \( 7 \times 2.40 = 16.80 \, \text{USD} \)

- **Wednesday:** 9 hours (8 regular, 1 overtime)  
  Regular: \( 8 \times 2.40 = 19.20 \, \text{USD} \)  
  Overtime: \( 1 \times 3.60 = 3.60 \, \text{USD} \)  
  Total: \( 19.20 + 3.60 = 22.80 \, \text{USD} \)

- **Thursday:** 9 hours (8 regular, 1 overtime)  
  Regular: \( 8 \times 2.40 = 19.20 \, \text{USD} \)  
  Overtime: \( 1 \times 3.60 = 3.60 \, \text{USD} \)  
  Total: \( 19.20 + 3.60 = 22.80 \, \text{USD} \)

- **Friday:** 10 hours (8 regular, 2 overtime)  
  Regular: \( 8 \times 2.40 = 19.20 \, \text{USD} \)  
  Overtime: \( 2 \times 3.60 = 7.20 \, \text{USD} \)  
  Total: \( 19.20 + 7.20 = 26.40 \, \text{USD} \)

**Total Earnings:**

Adding up the daily totals:  
\( 19.20 + 16.80 + 22.80 + 22.80 + 26.40 = 108.00 \, \text{USD} \)

Thus, the total earnings of the employee are **$108.00**, which corresponds to option **I**.
