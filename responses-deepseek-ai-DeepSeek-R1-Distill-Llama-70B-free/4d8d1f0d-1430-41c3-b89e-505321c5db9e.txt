Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about expected value and variance of random variables. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that X and Y are random variables. Wait, I remember that E(X) is the expected value, like the mean, and var(X) is the variance. So, looking at the problem:

E(X) is given as 312, and var(X) is 6. Then E(Y) is 307, and var(Y) is 8. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again. Oh, wait, the user wrote E(X) twice. Let me see: Oh, the question says E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6. Then E(X) is given again as 307? No, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, I think I misread. Let me check again.

Oh, no, the question actually says: E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(Y) = 307, and var(Y) = 8. Wait, no, the way it's written might be a mistake. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(X) = 307, and var(Y) = 8. Wait, that can't be right. It lists E(X) twice, which would be a mistake. Oh, wait no, perhaps it's a typo in the question. Maybe it's supposed to be E(Y) = 307. Because otherwise, it's giving two different expected values for X, which doesn't make sense.

Assuming that's a typo, I think it's E(Y)=307, var(Y)=8. So, that's the setup.

The question is asking for the expected value and variance of X + Y.

I recall that for the expectation of the sum of two random variables, the expectation of X + Y is just E(X) + E(Y), regardless of whether X and Y are independent or not. So that part should be straightforward.

So let's calculate E(X + Y) first. E(X) is 312, E(Y) is 307. So 312 + 307 = 619. So the expected value is 619.

Now, for the variance of X + Y. I remember that the variance of the sum depends on whether X and Y are independent or not. The formula is var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2 * cov(X,Y), where cov(X,Y) is the covariance between X and Y.

But wait, if X and Y are independent, then the covariance is zero, so var(X + Y) is just var(X) + var(Y). But if they are not independent, then the covariance term comes into play.

The problem is, the question doesn't specify whether X and Y are independent or not. So, do we have enough information to compute var(X + Y)?

Hmm. Without knowing whether X and Y are independent, we can't determine the covariance. So, if the covariance is zero, then the variance would be 6 + 8 = 14. But if the covariance isn't zero, then it could be more or less than that.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, some of them have var(X+Y) as 14. Others have different values. So let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: E=307, var=10

B: E=307, var=6

C: E=619, var=14

D: E=619, var=7

E: E=312, var=14

F: E=312, var=8

G: Insufficient info

H: E=619, var=8

I: E=619, var=6

J: E=619, var=10

So, the expectation of 619 is in options C, D, H, I, J.

Now, the variance part. If we can assume that X and Y are independent, then var(X+Y) would be 6+8=14, which is option C. But the problem doesn't state whether they're independent. So, if we don't have that information, we can't compute the exact variance. So in that case, the answer would be G: insufficient information.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to assume independence. But in reality, unless stated, you can't assume that. So if the question doesn't specify, we can't compute the variance accurately.

Wait, but in the problem, are X and Y independent? The question doesn't say. So without knowing, we can't determine the covariance, so var(X+Y) can't be found. So G would be the correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is E=619, var=14. That would be the case if X and Y are independent. So if the problem assumes independence, then C is correct. But the problem doesn't state that. So in real exams, if it's not specified, you have to go with what's given. So unless independence is given, you can't compute var(X+Y), so the answer is G.

But wait, maybe in the question, perhaps X and Y are independent? Let me check the question again. No, the problem doesn't say they're independent. It just says they're random variables.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in problems like this, if you're not told about dependence, they might be assuming independence. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Wait, the expectation part is definitely 619, as we calculated. So any option with E=619 is a candidate. Now, variance: if X and Y are independent, var(X+Y)=14. If they are dependent, it could be higher or lower.

But without information about covariance, we can't compute it. So the correct answer would be G: insufficient information.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has E=619 and var=14, which is the case when independent. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intended answer is C, assuming independence. Alternatively, the options might not have G as an option. Wait, no, option G is present.

Hmm. So in that case, would the correct answer be G? Because without knowing independence, we can't compute the variance.

But wait, let me think again. The problem gives E(X) and E(Y), and var(X) and var(Y). But nothing about covariance. So the variance of X+Y can't be determined without knowing covariance. So the correct answer would be G.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C is E=619, var=14. So if the problem expects us to assume independence, then C is correct. Otherwise, G is correct.

I'm a bit confused here because the problem didn't specify independence. But in some textbooks, when they give variances and you're to find var(X+Y), they often assume independence unless stated otherwise.

Wait, but no, the general rule is that you can't assume independence unless stated. So unless specified, you can't know the covariance, so you can't find the exact variance.

Therefore, the correct answer would be G: insufficient information.

But wait, let me look at the options again. Option C is E=619, var=14, which would be the case if X and Y are independent.

So perhaps the intended answer is C. But as a student, I'm a bit torn. Because I know that without independence, we can't say. But maybe the problem expects me to assume independence.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the variance of X is 6, and the variance of Y is 8, making the sum's variance 14 when independent.

But without knowing, I can't be certain. So in an exam, if the question doesn't specify independence, I think the correct approach is to select G.

Wait, but the options have G as an option, so that's possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Let's recast the problem.

If X and Y are independent, then var(X + Y) = 6 + 8 = 14. So E(X + Y)=619, var=14. So option C.

If X and Y are dependent with some covariance, the variance could be different. But without knowing the covariance, we can't find the exact value. So the answer is G: insufficient info.

So the correct answer would be G.

But wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.

The question says: "What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?"

So, without any other information, the expectation is definitely 619. But the variance requires knowing covariance.

So the variance can't be determined, so we can't give a numerical value for it. So the correct answer is G.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is there, which gives E=619, var=14. So perhaps the intended answer is C, assuming independence. But technically, without being told, we can't assume that.

So as a student, I'm a bit torn. But in exams, sometimes they expect you to make that assumption if it's not stated otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant to say that X and Y are independent, but forgot to include that. So in that case, the answer would be C.

Wait, but the question as written doesn't specify independence, so I think the correct answer is G.

But wait, in the original problem, the user wrote: "E(X) = 312, var(X) = 6, E(X) = 307, and var(Y) = 8." Wait, that's probably a typo. It should be E(Y)=307. So that's why.

So, in summary:

E(X + Y) = 312 + 307 = 619.

Var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y) + 2cov(X,Y). Since we don't know cov(X,Y), we can't find var(X+Y).

So the answer is G: insufficient information.

To determine the expected value and variance of the random variable \( X + Y \), we analyze the given information:

1. **Expected Value of \( X + Y \):**  
   The expected value of the sum of two random variables is always the sum of their expected values, regardless of whether they are independent or dependent. Thus,  
   \[
   E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 312 + 307 = 619.
   \]  
   This part is straightforward and does not require additional assumptions.

2. **Variance of \( X + Y \):**  
   The variance of the sum of two random variables is given by:  
   \[
   \text{var}(X + Y) = \text{var}(X) + \text{var}(Y) + 2 \cdot \text{cov}(X, Y),
   \]  
   where \( \text{cov}(X, Y) \) is the covariance between \( X \) and \( Y \).  
   - If \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent, the covariance \( \text{cov}(X, Y) = 0 \), and:  
     \[
     \text{var}(X + Y) = \text{var}(X) + \text{var}(Y) = 6 + 8 = 14.
     \]  
   - However, the problem does not specify whether \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent. Without information about the covariance, the exact variance of \( X + Y \) cannot be determined.  

Given this, the expected value of \( X + Y \) is definitively 619, but the variance cannot be calculated without additional information about the relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \). Therefore, the correct answer is that there is insufficient information to determine the variance of \( X + Y \).

**Critical Analysis of Options:**  
- **Option C:** Assumes independence (\( \text{var}(X + Y) = 14 \)), but the problem does not specify independence.  
- **Option G:** Correctly states that there is insufficient information to determine the variance.  

Since the problem does not provide enough information to calculate the variance, the correct answer is:

**G: There is insufficient information to answer this question.**
