Question:

A man needed to have the oil changed on his car. On Friday, he decided to take his car to the local dealership to have the oil changed and asked his neighbor if she would give him a ride home from the dealership. The neighbor said, "Why pay the high prices a dealership will charge you? I can change the oil in your car for you. If you will agree to pay me $50, I'll change the oil in your car over the weekend. " The man readily agreed. On Sunday afternoon, the man noticed that his neighbor still had not started working on the car. He asked his neighbor if the car would be ready for him to drive to work Monday morning. The neighbor replied, "I thought about it and realized $50 is too low a price for the work involved. I don't think I'm going to change the oil in your car. " The man then said, "Look, I realize $50 is low for the work involved. If you can change the oil in my car by tomorrow morning, I'll pay you an additional $25. And I won't sue you in small claims court for your failure to perform your promise. " The neighbor then changed the oil late Sunday afternoon, but the man refused to pay to the neighbor anything more than $50. In a suit by the neighbor to recover the additional $25 promised by the man, the neighbor will

Options:

A: lose, because the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil in the car for $50.
B: win, because the second contract for $75 superseded the original $50 contract.
C: win, because the man willingly offered an additional $25 for the service.
D: win, because the man breached the verbal contract they had.
E: win, because she performed her part of the bargain.
F: win, because the man promised not to sue in small claims court.
G: lose, because the neighbor did not fulfill the initial agreement within the agreed timeframe.
H: lose, because the man's offer of an additional $25 was not legally binding.

Okay, so I have this legal question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's go through it step by step. 

The situation is about a man and his neighbor. The man needed an oil change and asked his neighbor to take him home from the dealership. The neighbor offered to do the oil change herself for $50. The man agreed. But then on Sunday, the neighbor said she wasn't going to do it because $50 was too low. The man offered an extra $25 if she would do it by Monday morning and not sue her for breaking the promise. She then did the oil change, but the man only paid $50, not the extra $25. Now the neighbor is suing for that extra $25.

Hmm, so the question is about contracts. I remember that contracts require offer, acceptance, consideration. Also, there's something about pre-existing duties and how that affects new agreements.

So initially, the neighbor agreed to change the oil for $50. That's the original contract. Then, when she backed out, the man offered an additional $25 as an incentive for her to go through with it. She agreed and did the work. But he didn't pay the extra.

Wait, but in contract law, if someone is already under a contractual duty to perform, promising more money to get them to perform doesn't create a new contract because there's no new consideration. Consideration must be something beyond what's already required. So if the neighbor was already supposed to do the work for $50, the man's promise of an extra $25 might not be binding because there's no new consideration from the neighbor. She was already obligated to perform under the first contract.

So when the man offered $25 more, the neighbor's performance was still under the original duty. Therefore, the additional $25 isn't enforceable because there's no consideration for it. It's like saying, "I'll pay you more if you do what you were already supposed to do." That doesn't count as a new contract because the neighbor isn't providing anything extra beyond her existing obligation.

Wait, but some might argue that the man's forbearance from suing could be consideration. Because he agreed not to sue her for breaching the original contract. So he's giving up his right to sue, which could be a form of consideration. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Because the original contract was that she would do the work, and when she refused, he could sue for breach. So offering not to sue might be a new consideration because he's giving up a legal right. 

But wait, in this case, the neighbor actually performed the service after the new agreement. So the original breach was when she said she wouldn't do it, but then she did. So maybe the new agreement was a settlement where he agreed not to sue, and she agreed to perform. So in that case, the consideration would be his forbearance of suing, and her performing the service. That could form a new contract.

But I'm a bit confused. Let's see. The initial contract was $50 for the oil change. She backed out, which is a breach. He then offers her an additional $25 if she'll do it, and he won't sue. She does it. Now, the question is whether the $25 is enforceable.

If the original contract is still in place, then the man's offer to pay more might be seen as a modification without consideration. Under the common law, modifying a contract needs new consideration unless under the Uniform Commercial Code (which applies to goods, not sure if oil change counts as a service here). But since this is a service, perhaps common law applies. So without new consideration, the modification isn't enforceable. So the neighbor can't enforce the extra $25 because there's no consideration for it. She was already supposed to do the work, so her doing it isn't new consideration.

Alternatively, the man's promise not to sue could be the consideration. Because he's giving up his right to pursue a claim. But wait, when she agreed to the new deal, she performed, so there was no actual breach anymore. Because she did the work after all. So perhaps there's no loss, so his forbearance of a suit that might not have succeeded could be an issue. Or maybe the forbearance is sufficient consideration regardless.

But I'm not too sure about this. Another angle: the initial contract was for $50, and the neighbor breached it by refusing to perform. The man then offers a new deal: $75 and no lawsuit. She accepts by performing. So is this a valid contract?

In some cases, when a breach has occurred, the non-breaching party can either terminate the contract or accept the breach and sue for damages. If the man instead offers a new agreement, and the neighbor accepts and performs, then maybe the new agreement replaces the old one. But this would require that the new agreement has consideration.

Wait, but if she's still performing the same service, what's the consideration for the extra $25? She's not doing anything extra beyond what she was already supposed to do. So the additional $25 isn't supported by consideration. Therefore, the neighbor can't enforce that extra $25.

So looking at the options:

Option A says the neighbor loses because she had a pre-existing duty. That would align with what I was thinking earlier. Because the additional $25 isn't supported by new consideration, so the contract can't be enforced.

Option B says she wins because the second contract superseded the first. But without consideration for the modification, that's not valid.

Option C says she wins because the man willingly offered the $25. But willingness doesn't make it a binding contract without consideration.

Option D says she wins because the man breached the verbal contract, but I'm not sure. The man didn't breach; he was the one offering more.

Option E says she wins because she performed, but the issue is about the payment, not her performance.

Option F says she wins because the man promised not to sue. That could be consideration, but I'm not certain.

Option G says she loses because she didn't fulfill the initial agreement on time, but she did perform after the new agreement.

Option H says she loses because the man's offer wasn't binding. That could be because there's no consideration.

Wait, but if the man's forbearance of suing is the consideration, then there's consideration. So maybe the $25 is enforceable. Let me think again.

In the case where a plaintiff agrees not to pursue a claim in exchange for performance, that could be sufficient consideration. So if the man had a legitimate claim for breach, and he agrees not to pursue it in exchange for her performing, that's bargained-for consideration. So in that case, the $25 would be enforceable as part of the new contract.

But wait, the original contract was for $50. She breached, so he could sue for damages. If he offers to settle for $75 and she performs, that might be a new contract supported by consideration: his forbearance of the lawsuit and her performance. So in that case, the $75 would be enforceable.

So then, the neighbor would win because the second contract was valid. Looking at the options, option B says the second contract superseded the original. Option F says she wins because the man promised not to sue, which is part of the consideration.

Wait, but in the scenario, the man said he wouldn't sue and would pay an extra $25 if she did the work. So she did the work, so the consideration is mutual: she performed, and he didn't sue. So the new contract has consideration on both sides.

Therefore, the neighbor should be able to recover the $75, but wait, the man only paid $50. So she's suing for the extra $25. But in the new agreement, the total is $75, so she should get the additional $25.

Wait, but the options don't mention $75. The options are about whether she can recover the additional $25. So looking at option C: win because the man offered $25. But I'm not sure. Option B says the second contract replaces the first. So the total would be $75, so the extra $25 is part of that. So she can recover it.

Alternatively, if the original contract was $50 and the new agreement adds $25, making it $75, then she should get the $25 extra. So the correct option would be B, because the second contract is valid.

But wait, earlier I thought that without new consideration, the modification isn't valid. But if the man's forbearance to sue is the consideration, then the new contract is valid. So the second contract is enforceable, so she can get the extra $25.

So which option aligns with that? Option B says the second contract superseded the original, so she can get the $75. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, option F says she wins because the man promised not to sue, which is the consideration. So that's also a possible angle.

Wait, but the question is about the additional $25. So the promise not to sue was part of the consideration for that extra amount. So in the second contract, the consideration is his forbearance and her performance.

So in that case, the second contract is enforceable, and she can collect the $25.

So looking at the options, option B says the second contract supersedes the first, which would make the total $75. So the correct answer would be B.

Alternatively, option F says she wins because the man promised not to sue. But the $25 is the additional payment, so perhaps option C is about the man offering the $25, but that doesn't address consideration.

I think the correct reasoning is that the second contract is enforceable because it has consideration. So the answer is B.

The situation involves a contract for an oil change between a man and his neighbor. Initially, the neighbor agreed to change the oil for $50, but later refused, prompting the man to offer an additional $25 if she would complete the job by Monday morning and not face a lawsuit. The neighbor performed the work but only received the original $50, leading her to sue for the extra $25.

Key legal principles here include the requirement of consideration for contract modifications and the concept of forbearance as consideration. The original contract obligated the neighbor to perform for $50, and her initial refusal constituted a breach. The man's offer of an additional $25, combined with his agreement not to sue, created a new contract. The consideration for this new contract was the man's forbearance of his right to sue for the breach and the neighbor's performance of the oil change. Since this new contract has valid consideration, it supersedes the original agreement, making the total payment of $75 enforceable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the pre-existing duty rule does not bar the enforceability of the new contract, as the man's forbearance provides new consideration.
- **Option B** is correct because the second contract, supported by consideration, supersedes the original $50 agreement.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the man's willingness to offer $25 alone does not create a binding contract without consideration.
- **Option D** is incorrect because the man did not breach the original contract.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the issue is about payment, not performance.
- **Option F** is plausible but less precise, as the key point is the enforceability of the second contract, not just the promise not to sue.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the neighbor ultimately performed the work.
- **Option H** is incorrect because the man's offer became legally binding when supported by consideration.

The correct answer is **B**, as the second contract supersedes the original and is enforceable.
