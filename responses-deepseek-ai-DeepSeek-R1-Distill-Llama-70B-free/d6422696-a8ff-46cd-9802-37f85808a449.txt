Question:

Hydrangea flowers have one gene for flower color. Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?

Options:

A: The flower color is a result of genetic drift within the population.
B: In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.
C: The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.
D: The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.
E: The flower color is a result of multiple alleles interacting.
F: The flower color is a result of the plant's age.
G: The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.
H: The flower color is determined by the type of pollinators in the area.
I: The flower color is determined by the amount of sunlight the plant receives.
J: The flower color changes due to genetic mutation over time.

Okay, so I've got this question about hydrangea flowers and their color variation. Hmm, I remember that hydrangeas can have different flower colors based on where they're grown. The question says that plants of the same genetic variety have flowers ranging from blue to pink because of the soil type. 

So, the key here is that the plants are the same genetically. That makes me think it's not about different genes or alleles causing the color change. If it were genetic, like different alleles, then they wouldn't be the same variety. But in this case, it's the environment affecting the trait.

I've heard that the color of hydrangea flowers is influenced by the soil pH. More acidic soil tends to produce blue flowers, while more alkaline soil results in pink flowers. So the environment—specifically the soil—is altering the expression of the flower color gene.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Genetic drift. No, that's a random change in allele frequencies, not about environment affecting traits.

Option B: Environment alters gene expression. That sounds right because the same genes are expressed differently based on soil conditions.

Option C: Polygenic inheritance. That would mean multiple genes control the trait, but the question says it's one gene. So probably not C.

Option D: Codominant alleles. Codominance is when both alleles show, like blood types. But here, the environment determines which trait is expressed, not both showing at once.

Option E: Multiple alleles interacting. I'm not sure, but the question says one gene, so maybe not multiple alleles.

Option F: Plant's age. The question doesn't mention anything about age affecting color, so probably not F.

Option G: Incomplete dominance. That's when the heterozygous condition shows a blending, like pink in snapdragons. But here, it's not about blending; it's about different colors based on environment.

Option H: Pollinators. I don't think the type of pollinators affects the flower color directly. They might influence evolution over time, but not the current color.

Option I: Sunlight. The question mentions soil, not sunlight, so I don't think I is correct.

Option J: Genetic mutation. These are changes in the DNA sequence, but the plants are the same variety, so mutations aren't the cause here.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be B, because the environment (soil) is altering how the gene is expressed. The same gene leads to different flower colors based on environmental factors.

The color variation in hydrangea flowers, ranging from blue to pink, is due to the same genetic variety being influenced by environmental factors, specifically soil type. The soil's pH alters the expression of the flower color gene, with acidic soils producing blue flowers and alkaline soils producing pink flowers. This phenomenon is best explained by the environment modifying the expression of a trait, rather than genetic changes or interactions.

- **A**: Incorrect. Genetic drift refers to random changes in allele frequencies, not environmental influence.
- **B**: Correct. The environment (soil pH) alters the expression of the flower color gene.
- **C**: Incorrect. Polygenic inheritance involves multiple genes, but the question specifies one gene.
- **D**: Incorrect. Codominance involves both alleles being expressed simultaneously, which is not the case here.
- **E**: Incorrect. The question specifies one gene, not multiple alleles interacting.
- **F**: Incorrect. Plant age is not mentioned as a factor.
- **G**: Incorrect. Incomplete dominance involves blending of traits, not environmental influence.
- **H**: Incorrect. Pollinators do not directly affect flower color.
- **I**: Incorrect. Sunlight is not mentioned as a factor.
- **J**: Incorrect. Genetic mutations are not involved, as the plants are the same genetic variety.

The correct answer is **B**.
