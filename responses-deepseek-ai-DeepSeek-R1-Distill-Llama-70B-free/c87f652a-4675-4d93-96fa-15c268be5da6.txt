Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about concave mirrors and image formation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

The problem says that an object is 1 meter in front of a concave mirror with a radius of curvature of 30 cm. Wait, the radius is 30 cm, so the focal length is half of that, which is 15 cm. Oh right, because focal length (f) is R/2. So f = 0.15 m.

Right, the object is initially at u = 1 m. I remember the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Let me plug in the numbers. So f is 0.15 m. u is 1 m. 

Calculating 1/u: 1/1 = 1. So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. That's 1/0.15 - 1 = (20/3) - 1 = 17/3 ≈ 5.6667. So v is 1/(17/3) = 3/17 ≈ 0.1765 meters, which is about 17.65 cm. So the image is formed about 17.65 cm in front of the mirror. Wait, concave mirrors always produce real images in front of the mirror, right? So that makes sense.

But the question says we need to move the image 15 cm farther away from the mirror. So currently, the image is at ~17.65 cm. Moving it 15 cm farther would place it at 17.65 + 15 = 32.65 cm from the mirror. So the new image position v' is 32.65 cm, which is 0.3265 meters.

Now I need to find where the object should be placed so that the image moves to this new position. Using the mirror formula again: 1/f = 1/u' + 1/v'. 

We have f = 0.15 m, v' = 0.3265 m. Plugging in, 1/0.15 = 1/u' + 1/0.3265.

Calculating each term: 1/0.15 is approximately 6.6667. 1/0.3265 is about 3.063. So 6.6667 = 1/u' + 3.063. That means 1/u' = 6.6667 - 3.063 = 3.6037. So u' is 1/3.6037 ≈ 0.2775 meters, which is 27.75 cm.

Wait, the original object was at 1 m (100 cm) in front. The new position is approximately 27.75 cm in front. So the object needs to move closer to the mirror. How much? 100 cm - 27.75 cm = 72.25 cm. So the object moves 72.25 cm closer to the mirror.

Looking at the options, option H is 72.25 cm closer. So I think the correct answer is H.

To solve the problem, we start by using the mirror formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
\]

Here:
- The radius of curvature \( R \) is 30 cm, so the focal length \( f = \frac{R}{2} = 15 \, \text{cm} = 0.15 \, \text{m} \).
- The initial object distance \( u = 1 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{0.15} - \frac{1}{1} = \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{17}{3}
\]

Thus, the initial image distance is:

\[
v = \frac{3}{17} \approx 0.1765 \, \text{m} \, (\text{or } 17.65 \, \text{cm}).
\]

The problem requires moving the image \( 15 \, \text{cm} \) farther away from the mirror. The new image distance is:

\[
v' = 17.65 \, \text{cm} + 15 \, \text{cm} = 32.65 \, \text{cm} = 0.3265 \, \text{m}.
\]

Using the mirror formula again to find the new object distance \( u' \):

\[
\frac{1}{u'} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{v'} = \frac{1}{0.15} - \frac{1}{0.3265} \approx 6.6667 - 3.063 = 3.6037
\]

Thus:

\[
u' = \frac{1}{3.6037} \approx 0.2775 \, \text{m} \, (\text{or } 27.75 \, \text{cm}).
\]

The object was initially \( 1 \, \text{m} \) (or \( 100 \, \text{cm} \)) in front of the mirror. The new object distance is \( 27.75 \, \text{cm} \), so the object must move:

\[
100 \, \text{cm} - 27.75 \, \text{cm} = 72.25 \, \text{cm} \, \text{closer to the mirror}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 72.25 cm closer to the mirror.**
