Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a drag race, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a dragster reaches the quarter-mile marker, which is 402 meters, with a speed of 80 m/s. We need to find the acceleration and the time it took for the run. The options are given from A to J, each with different acceleration and time values. I have to pick the correct pair.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that in kinematics, when you're dealing with acceleration and velocity, there are a few key equations. Let me think: one of the basic equations is v² = u² + 2as, where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and s is the distance. Since the dragster starts from rest, the initial velocity u is 0. So that equation might help here.

Wait, right. So if u = 0, then v² = 2as. So I can solve for acceleration a using that. Let's plug in the numbers.

Given that v is 80 m/s and s is 402 meters. So, 80 squared is 6400. Then 6400 equals 2 times a times 402. So, 2 * 402 is 804. So a = 6400 / 804. Let me calculate that.

Wait, what's 6400 divided by 804? Let me do this division step by step. 804 times 8 is 6432, which is a bit more than 6400. So 8 would give 6432, which is 32 more than 6400. So 8 minus (32/804). 32 divided by 804 is approximately 0.04. So a is about 7.96 m/s². Okay, so the acceleration is approximately 7.96 m/s².

Now, for the time. I think the best equation here is v = u + at, but since u is 0, it's just v = a t. So time t is v divided by a. So 80 divided by 7.96. Let me calculate that.

80 divided by 8 is exactly 10, but 7.96 is a little less than 8, so the time will be a bit more than 10 seconds. Let me do 80 /7.96. Well, 7.96 times 10 is 79.6. So 80 divided by 7.96 is 10.1 seconds approximately, because 79.6 is 0.4 less than 80. So 0.4 divided by 7.96 is about 0.05, so 10.05, roughly 10.1 seconds.

So the acceleration is approximately 7.96 m/s² and the time is around 10.1 seconds. Now let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B says 7.96 m/s² and 10.1 s. That matches exactly what I calculated. Option I has the same acceleration but a different time, 9.1 s, which doesn't fit. Option D has 7.46 and 10.5, which is not what I got.

So the correct answer should be option B: 7.96 m/s² and 10.1 s.

To solve the problem, we use the kinematic equation \( v^2 = u^2 + 2as \), where \( v \) is the final velocity, \( u \) is the initial velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( s \) is the distance. Since the dragster starts from rest (\( u = 0 \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
v^2 = 2as
\]

Given \( v = 80 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( s = 402 \, \text{m} \), we solve for \( a \):

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{2s} = \frac{80^2}{2 \times 402} = \frac{6400}{804} \approx 7.96 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Next, to find the time \( t \), we use the equation \( v = at \), since \( u = 0 \). Rearranging for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{80}{7.96} \approx 10.1 \, \text{s}
\]

Thus, the acceleration is approximately \( 7.96 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and the time is approximately \( 10.1 \, \text{s} \). Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 7.96 m/s² and 10.1 s**
