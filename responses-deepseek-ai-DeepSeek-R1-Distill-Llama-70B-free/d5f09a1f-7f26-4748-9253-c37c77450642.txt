Question:

One evening, an undercover narcotics agent, with the help of a confidential informant, met with a man. The man took the agent to the home of a drug dealer, who sold the agent four pounds of marijuana. At trial, the drug dealer claimed the defense of entrapment and demanded that the informant's identity be disclosed and that he be produced. At no time prior to trial did the drug dealer seek to subpoena the man. However, the man was a fugitive from justice the whole time, and no subpoena could have been served. The government claims a right to protect the informant's identity. Should the government's claim be honored?

Options:

A: No, because the drug dealer has a right to face his accuser.
B: Yes, because informants would not assist in crime prevention unless they were reasonably certain that their identities would be kept secret.
C: Yes, because revealing the identity of the informant could jeopardize ongoing investigations.
D: No, because under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be confronted by witnesses against him.
E: Yes, because an informant has a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
F: No, because the informant's testimony could be crucial for the defense's entrapment claim.
G: Yes, because the man was a fugitive and the government could not have served a subpoena.
H: Yes, because the informant's safety could be at risk if his identity is revealed.
I: No, because under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to a fair trial.
J: No, because the government does not have the right to protect an informant's identity.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the issue of informant identity disclosure and the entrapment defense. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is this: An undercover narcotics agent, helped by a confidential informant, meets a man who takes the agent to a drug dealer's home. The dealer sells four pounds of marijuana to the agent. At trial, the dealer claims entrapment and wants the informant's identity disclosed and the informant to testify. The dealer didn't subpoena the man before trial, but the man was a fugitive the whole time, so no subpoena could have been served. The government argues they have a right to protect the informant's identity.

The question is whether the government's claim should be honored. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall the relevant legal principles. I remember that the government has a privilege to withhold the identities of confidential informants, but this isn't absolute. There are exceptions, especially when the informant's testimony is crucial for the defendant's case.

The key case I think is Roviaro v. United States. In Roviaro, the Supreme Court held that the government can withhold an informant's identity unless the defendant shows that the informant's testimony is essential to their defense. The court balances the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual's right to prepare their defense.

In this case, the drug dealer is claiming entrapment. Entrapment is when the government induces someone to commit a crime they wouldn't have otherwise committed. To prove entrapment, the defendant needs to show that government agents or their informants/confidential informants induced the crime.

The informant here was crucial because he was the one who set up the meeting. If the dealer can't call the informant, maybe he can't establish that the informant induced him to sell the marijuana. So the informant's testimony might be essential for the entrapment defense.

But wait, the drug dealer didn't try to subpoena the man (maybe the middleman) who took the agent to the dealer. The man was a fugitive, so a subpoena couldn't have been served. But the dealer didn't try before trial, so maybe that's a procedural issue. Did the dealer make an effort to get the man's testimony?

Wait, the problem says the dealer demanded the informant's identity and that the informant be produced. He didn't subpoena the man, but the man was a fugitive anyway. So maybe the focus is on the informant's identity, not the man.

So the issue is whether the government must reveal the informant's identity because it's essential to the defense's case.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because the right to face the accuser. Confrontation Clause? But the Confrontation Clause generally applies to witnesses testifying against the defendant. The informant isn't testifying against, they're more of a participant. So maybe not directly a Confrontation Clause issue.

Option B: Yes, because informants need secrecy. This is the general rule, but Roviaro says it's not absolute.

Option C: Yes, because of ongoing investigations. The government often uses this reason, but if the informant's testimony is crucial, this might not override.

Option D: No, citing Fifth Amendment right to confrontation. Wait, Fifth Amendment is about self-incrimination. The Confrontation Clause is part of the Sixth Amendment. So D might be mixing up amendments.

Option E: Yes, informant's Fifth Amendment privilege. I don't think informants have a Fifth Amendment privilege in this context. The Fifth Amendment is against self-incrimination, but the government is asserting a privilege, not the informant asserting it.

Option F: No, because the informant's testimony is crucial for the defense. This aligns with Roviaro. If the defense can show that without the informant, their case is harmed, then the identity should be disclosed.

Option G: Yes, because the man was a fugitive. But the issue is about the informant, not the man. So G might not be relevant here.

Option H: Yes, because safety is at risk. Safety is a reason, but again, if the testimony is crucial, it might not suffice.

Option I: No, because of the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. The Sixth Amendment includes the right to compulsory process for witnesses. If the defense can show that the informant is a necessary witness, then they should be allowed.

Option J: No, because the government doesn't have the right to protect. That's incorrect because the government does have a qualified privilege.

So the main issue is whether the informant's identity must be disclosed because their testimony is essential for the defense's entrapment claim.

In Roviaro, the court said that the defendant must show that the informant's testimony would be helpful and that other evidence isn't available. Here, the dealer is claiming that without the informant's testimony, he can't prove entrapment. The man is a fugitive, so perhaps the defense can't get his testimony, but the government is opposing the informant's testimony.

So the correct answer would likely be F: No, because the informant's testimony could be crucial for the defense's entrapment claim.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says the dealer didn't seek to subpoena the man, who was a fugitive. So perhaps the dealer should have tried to get the man's testimony, but couldn't because he was a fugitive. But the dealer is trying to get the informant's identity. So maybe the dealer is trying to get the informant as a witness, which the government is opposing.

Alternatively, maybe the man is the informant? No, the setup was that the agent met with a man who took him to the dealer. The agent had a confidential informant who helped set it up. So the confidential informant is another person, not the man who was the middleman.

So the dealer wants the confidential informant's identity. The man can't be subpoenaed because he's a fugitive, but the dealer didn't try to subpoena him anyway. So maybe the dealer is focusing on the confidential informant.

So under Roviaro, the government's privilege must give way if the informant's testimony is essential. In this case, for the entrapment defense, the informant's role might be crucial. So the government's claim to protect the identity should not be honored, so the answer would be F.

Looking back at the options, F states that the government's claim shouldn't be honored because the informant's testimony is crucial for the entrapment defense.

The question revolves around whether the government can protect the identity of a confidential informant when the defendant claims entrapment and seeks the informant's testimony as crucial to their defense. The legal framework for this issue is primarily established by *Roviaro v. United States*, which holds that the government's privilege to withhold an informant's identity is not absolute. The court must balance the public interest in protecting informants against the defendant's right to a fair trial. If the defendant can show that the informant's testimony is essential to their defense, the government's privilege may be overridden.

In this case, the drug dealer claims entrapment, and the confidential informant's testimony could be crucial to establishing whether the crime was induced by government agents or informants. Although the dealer did not subpoena the man who facilitated the meeting (and who was a fugitive), the focus is on the confidential informant, not the man. The government's argument to protect the informant's identity must yield if the informant's testimony is essential to the defense's case.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, I**: These options incorrectly invoke constitutional rights (Confrontation Clause, Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment) in a manner that does not directly apply to the informant's identity privilege.
- **B, C, E, G, H**: These options prioritize the government's interest in protecting informants but fail to account for the potential necessity of the informant's testimony for the defense.
- **J**: This is incorrect because the government does have a qualified privilege to protect informant identities.
- **F**: This is correct because the informant's testimony could be crucial for the defense's entrapment claim, as required by *Roviaro*.

Thus, the government's claim to protect the informant's identity should not be honored if the informant's testimony is essential to the defense.
