Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about fixed points in a linear normed space. Hmm, I remember from my studies that fixed point theorems are important in various areas of math, especially in analysis. The question says that C is a compact convex set in a linear normed space, and T is a continuous mapping from C to C. We need to determine if there must exist a fixed point of T in C. The options are A through J, with the correct answer being 1 for yes and 0 for no.

Wait, I think the key here is to recall Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem. I remember that Brouwer's theorem applies to convex compact subsets of Euclidean space. Specifically, it states that any continuous function from a convex compact subset to itself has at least one fixed point. So if C is compact and convex in, say, R^n, then T must have a fixed point.

But wait, the question says a linear normed space. Oh right, Brouwer's theorem is usually stated in Euclidean spaces, which are finite-dimensional. But what about infinite-dimensional spaces? I'm trying to remember. I think there's a generalization called Schauder's Fixed Point Theorem. Oh right, Schauder's theorem says that if you have a convex compact subset in a Banach space (which is a type of normed linear space) and a continuous mapping into itself, then there's at least one fixed point. So Schauder's applies here because C is compact and convex, and the space is a linear normed space (assuming it's complete, but maybe the theorem doesn't require that? Or maybe in the context of the question, it's given as a Banach space.)

Wait, but the question doesn't specify that the space is complete. Oh, wait, in Schauder's theorem, the space needs to be a Banach space, right? Because it uses the Schauder basis and stuff. So if the space isn't complete, maybe it's different. Hmm. But the question says "linear normed space," which doesn't necessarily imply completeness. Banach spaces are complete normed spaces.

Wait, but the set C is compact. In normed spaces, compact sets are closed and bounded, and in a Banach space, by the Schauder theorem, we get the fixed point. But if the space isn't complete, I'm not sure. Wait, but the statement here is about a linear normed space, so maybe it's a Banach space. Or perhaps the question assumes it's a Banach space. Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes because of Schauder's theorem, assuming that C is compact and convex in a Banach space. So in that case, the answer would be yes, which is 1.0, option A.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the conditions. Let me think again. Brouwer is finite-dimensional. Schauder is for Banach spaces. So if C is compact and convex in a Banach space, then yes, T has a fixed point.

So the correct answer should be yes, which is 1.0, option A. So the correct choice is A.

The question asks whether a continuous mapping \( T: C \to C \) on a compact convex set \( C \) in a linear normed space guarantees the existence of a fixed point. To answer this, we rely on fixed point theorems. Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem applies to convex compact subsets in Euclidean spaces, ensuring a fixed point for continuous mappings. However, the question is set in a linear normed space, which may or may not be finite-dimensional or complete.

Schauder's Fixed Point Theorem generalizes Brouwer's theorem to infinite-dimensional spaces, specifically Banach spaces. It states that any continuous mapping from a convex compact subset of a Banach space into itself has at least one fixed point. Since the question specifies a linear normed space, and compactness implies completeness in certain contexts, it is reasonable to assume the space is a Banach space. Thus, Schauder's theorem applies, ensuring the existence of a fixed point.

Given this reasoning, the answer is yes, which corresponds to 1.0.
