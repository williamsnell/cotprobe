Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a turbine where superheated steam enters and exits as a liquid-vapor mixture. I need to calculate the turbine efficiency, effectiveness, and the loss of available energy. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

First, I should probably recall what each of these terms means. Turbine efficiency, I think, is the ratio of the actual work output to the ideal (isentropic) work output. Effectiveness, on the other hand, might be related to the second law of thermodynamics, perhaps comparing the actual exergy output to the ideal exergy change. The loss of available energy would probably involve exergy destruction, which is the loss due to irreversibilities.

So the given data: the steam enters at 400 lbf/in² (which is gauge pressure? Or absolute? I think in thermodynamics, pressures are usually absolute, but I might need to convert that to psia by adding atmospheric pressure. Wait, standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, so 400 lbf/in² gauge would be 414.7 psia. But wait, sometimes in these problems, they might already give it as absolute. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, no, in steam tables, the pressure is usually absolute, so 400 lbf/in² would be 400 psia because that's how steam tables are presented. I think that's right. So P1 is 400 psia, and temperature T1 is 600°F.

The exit pressure is 50 lbf/in². Again, same confusion. Since it's turbine exit, which is typically a lower pressure, and if it's a condenser, it's likely that it's 50 psia, but wait, wait, no. If the turbine is adiabatic, then perhaps the exit is at 50 psia because that's a common pressure. But I think in this problem, the exit pressure is given as 50 lbf/in² absolute, so I don't need to add atmospheric pressure.

At the exit, the steam has a quality of 99.5%. So that means it's mostly vapor, with a tiny bit of liquid. So I can find the enthalpy at the exit using the steam tables for saturated liquid and vapor at 50 psia.

The surroundings are at 60°F, which is important for exergy calculations because exergy depends on the reference environment temperature.

So first, I need to compute the turbine efficiency. To find efficiency, I'll need the actual work output and the ideal work output. But since the turbine is adiabatic, Q=0, so the first law (steady flow energy equation) gives h1 = h2 + (work)/m. Wait, but work is typically per unit mass, so the equation is h1 = h2 + w, where w is work per lbm. So the actual work would be w_actual = h1 - h2. But for the ideal case, assuming isentropic process, we can find h2s (the enthalpy at exit pressure, P2=50 psia, and s1 = s2s).

Wait, let me outline the steps:

1. Find h1 and s1 at P1=400 psia, T1=600°F.
2. At P2=50 psia, find s2s = s1 (isentropic), then find the corresponding state. Since P2 is low, and s1 is higher than s_g at P2, the state at P2s would be superheated vapor, so we can find T2s and h2s from the superheated tables at P2=50 psia and s=s1.
3. Calculate the ideal (isentropic) work: w_ideal = h1 - h2s.
4. The actual work is w_actual = h1 - h2, where h2 is the actual exit enthalpy (since quality is 99.5%, we can get h2 from the saturated tables at P2=50 psia).
5. Turbine efficiency η_turbine = (w_actual) / (w_ideal) * 100%.

Then, for effectiveness, which I think is the ratio of actual exergy output to the ideal exergy output. Exergy is the available energy to do work, so for a turbine, the exergy change would be the maximum possible work output. So effectiveness would be (actual exergy change) / (ideal exergy change). Alternatively, since exergy is h - h0 - T0(s - s0), where h0 and s0 are at ambient conditions. But perhaps the approach is to calculate the exergy at inlet and outlet, then find the actual exergy transfer as work, and compare it to the ideal.

Wait, perhaps effectiveness is the ratio of the actual work to the maximum possible work (which would be the exergy change). So effectiveness ε = w_actual / (h1 - h0 - T0(s1 - s0)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the actual exergy output to the ideal exergy output.

Wait, I think that for a turbine operating between two pressures, the effectiveness is the ratio of the actual work output to the maximum possible work output, which would be the isentropic work minus the exergy at the exit relative to the environment.

Alternatively, exergy efficiency (effectiveness) might be defined as the actual exergy extracted divided by the maximum possible exergy that could be extracted. So, maybe it's (w_actual) / (w_max), where w_max is the work output if the process were both isentropic and the exit state were in equilibrium with the surroundings (which would be at T0 and P0), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, I think that the exergetic efficiency (effectiveness) is defined as (Ex_out) / (Ex_in), where Ex is exergy. So Ex_out would be the actual work output, and Ex_in would be the exergy entering, which is h1 - h0 - T0(s1 - s0), where h0 and s0 are the properties of the dead state (T0=60°F, P0=maybe 14.7 psia, but since the problem states T0 as 60°F, perhaps P0 is 50 psia? Or perhaps it's standard atmospheric pressure? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the dead state is usually taken as the ambient conditions, which is typically 14.7 psia and 60°F. But in this problem, the exit pressure is 50 psia, which is lower than atmospheric. Hmm, perhaps I should consider P0 as 14.7 psia, regardless of the turbine exit pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dead state is taken at the exit pressure, but I'm not sure. I think the dead state is usually the ambient conditions, which is P0=14.7 psia and T0=60°F.

So first, I need to compute the exergy at the inlet and the exergy at the exit.

The exergy per unit mass is given by:

ex = h - h0 - T0 (s - s0)

Where h0 and s0 are evaluated at T0 and P0.

So for the inlet state, ex1 = h1 - h0 - T0 (s1 - s0)

For the exit state, ex2 = h2 - h0 - T0 (s2 - s0)

Then, the actual exergy change is ex1 - ex2, which should equal the work output, assuming adiabatic turbine (Q=0) and neglecting kinetic and potential energy changes.

Wait, but the turbine is adiabatic, so Q=0, and if we neglect kinetic and potential energy changes, then the work output is h1 - h2. But exergy is the maximum possible work obtainable from the fluid as it comes to equilibrium with the surroundings. So the maximum possible work would be ex1 - ex2s, where ex2s is the exergy at the isentropic exit state.

But perhaps I'm getting too tangled up. Let me think again.

The turbine's actual work is w_actual = h1 - h2.

The ideal (isentropic) work would be w_isen = h1 - h2s.

So turbine efficiency η = w_actual / w_isen.

Effectiveness, which I think refers to exergetic efficiency, would be the actual exergy extracted divided by the maximum possible exergy that could have been extracted.

So the maximum exergy output would be ex1 - ex2s, where ex2s is the exergy at the isentropic exit state (h2s, s2s = s1).

So effectiveness ε = w_actual / (ex1 - ex2s) * 100%.

Wait, but wait, because ex1 - ex2s would be the maximum possible work if the process were isentropic. So yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, effectiveness could be (w_actual) / (h1 - h2s - T0 (s1 - s2s)), but since s2s = s1, the T0 term disappears. So (h1 - h2s) is the isentropic work, which would be the maximum exergy. So effectiveness would be (h1 - h2) / (h1 - h2s) = η, which can't be right because the options have different values for efficiency and effectiveness. So perhaps I'm confusing the terms.

Wait, perhaps effectiveness is the ratio of actual exergy extracted to the ideal exergy extracted. So, in that case, effectiveness would be (ex1 - ex2) / (ex1 - ex2s), which is different from turbine efficiency.

Yes, that makes sense. So turbine efficiency is based on energy (first law), while effectiveness is based on exergy (second law).

So, the steps would be:

Compute turbine efficiency, which is (h1 - h2) / (h1 - h2s) * 100%.

Compute effectiveness as (ex1 - ex2) / (ex1 - ex2s) * 100%.

Compute the loss of available energy, which would be the exergy destroyed in the turbine. Exergy destruction is T0 * s_gen, where s_gen is the entropy generated. Since the turbine is adiabatic, s_gen = s2 - s1 + (s_surroundings * Q), but Q=0, so s_gen = s2 - s1.

But wait, for a turbine, s_gen would be positive if the process is irreversible, so s2 > s1 (since s is increasing). So exergy destruction is T0 * (s2 - s1). Then, the loss of available energy per lbm would be exergy destruction: I = T0 (s2 - s1). But wait, since T0 is in Fahrenheit, I need to convert it to absolute temperature (Rankine). So T0 = 60°F = 60 + 459.67 = 519.67 R.

So the loss of available energy would be I = 519.67 * (s2 - s1) Btu/lbm.

Wait, but let me confirm the units. Enthalpy h is in Btu/lbm, entropy s is in Btu/(lbm·R). So when I multiply T0 (in R) by s (in Btu/(lbm·R)), I get Btu/lbm.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, find h1 and s1 at 400 psia, 600°F.

Looking up steam tables: At 400 psia, 600°F is superheated. So I can use the superheated steam tables.

From the table, at 400 psia and 600°F:

h1 = 1290.1 Btu/lbm

s1 = 1.6357 Btu/(lbm·R)

Next, at P2 = 50 psia, with quality x2 = 99.5%.

From the saturated steam tables at 50 psia:

hf = 444.94 Btu/lbm

hg = 1177.5 Btu/lbm

sf = 0.3135 Btu/(lbm·R)

sg = 1.7564 Btu/(lbm·R)

So the actual enthalpy h2 = hf + x2*(hg - hf) = 444.94 + 0.995*(1177.5 - 444.94) = 444.94 + 0.995*(732.56) = 444.94 + 728.68 ≈ 1173.62 Btu/lbm.

Similarly, s2 = sf + x2*(sg - sf) = 0.3135 + 0.995*(1.7564 - 0.3135) = 0.3135 + 0.995*(1.4429) ≈ 0.3135 + 1.4355 ≈ 1.749 Btu/(lbm·R).

Now, compute the ideal isentropic exit enthalpy h2s. Since the process is isentropic, s2s = s1 = 1.6357 Btu/(lbm·R).

At P2=50 psia, we need to find the state where s = 1.6357. Since at 50 psia, the saturated vapor has s_g = 1.7564, which is higher than 1.6357, so the state is superheated. Therefore, I need to look up the superheated steam table at 50 psia to find the temperature T2s where s = 1.6357.

Looking at superheated steam at 50 psia:

At 50 psia, find s between which temperatures. Let's see:

At 50 psia, 500°F: s = 1.7666

At 450°F: s = 1.6930

We need s=1.6357, which is between 400°F and 450°F.

Wait, looking at 50 psia, 400°F: s=1.6432.

Hmm, 1.6432 is close to 1.6357, but a bit higher. So maybe the saturation temp at 50 psia is lower. Wait, the saturation temperature at 50 psia is 281.0°F. So at 50 psia, above 281°F is superheated.

Wait, perhaps I can interpolate between 400°F (s=1.6432) and 350°F (if data is available). Alternatively, let me see:

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the superheated tables for 50 psia.

Wait, in the superheated tables for 50 psia:

At 300°F, s=1.5679

At 350°F, s=1.6145

At 400°F, s=1.6432

At 450°F, s=1.6930

So s increases with temperature. We're looking for s=1.6357, which is between 350°F and 400°F.

Compute the exact temperature where s=1.6357 at 50 psia.

Between 350°F (1.6145) and 400°F (1.6432):

The difference in s is 1.6432 - 1.6145 = 0.0287.

We need s=1.6357, which is 1.6357 -1.6145 = 0.0212 above 350°F.

So fraction = 0.0212 / 0.0287 ≈ 0.738.

So temperature T2s ≈ 350 + 0.738*(400-350) ≈ 350 + 0.738*50 ≈ 350 + 36.9 ≈ 386.9°F.

Now, at 50 psia and 386.9°F, find h2s.

At 350°F: h=1198.5

At 400°F: h=1278.7

The difference in h is 1278.7 - 1198.5 = 80.2 Btu/lbm over 50°F.

So, per degree F, h increases by 80.2/50 ≈ 1.604 Btu/lbm/°F.

We have 36.9°F above 350°F, so h2s ≈ 1198.5 + 36.9*1.604 ≈ 1198.5 + 59.1 ≈ 1257.6 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but let me check if that's accurate. Alternatively, we can use linear interpolation between the two points.

So, h at T = 350 + x degrees, where x=36.9:

h = 1198.5 + (1278.7 - 1198.5)*(x)/(400-350) )

= 1198.5 + (80.2)*(36.9/50)

= 1198.5 + 80.2 * 0.738 ≈ 1198.5 + 59.2 ≈ 1257.7 Btu/lbm.

So h2s ≈ 1257.7 Btu/lbm.

Now, compute the actual work and the ideal work.

w_actual = h1 - h2 = 1290.1 - 1173.62 ≈ 116.48 Btu/lbm.

w_ideal = h1 - h2s = 1290.1 - 1257.7 ≈ 32.4 Btu/lbm.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. 32.4 seems too low for ideal work. Because actual work is higher than ideal? That would imply efficiency greater than 100%, which isn't possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second, no. Because in this case, h2s is higher than h2. Because the actual process is going to a higher enthalpy than the ideal. So perhaps I have the actual work being higher than the ideal, which would mean that the turbine is producing more work than the isentropic case, which doesn't make sense because in reality, the isentropic case gives the maximum work. So perhaps I made a mistake in h2s.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine. The isentropic process would have the same entropy as the inlet, s2s = s1 = 1.6357. At P2=50 psia, that's between 350°F and 400°F, as we found. So the ideal exit is superheated steam at 50 psia, 386.9°F, with h2s≈1257.7 Btu/lbm.

But the actual exit is at 50 psia, x=99.5%, h2≈1173.62 Btu/lbm.

So, the actual work w_actual = h1 - h2 = 1290.1 - 1173.62 ≈ 116.48 Btu/lbm.

The ideal work w_ideal
