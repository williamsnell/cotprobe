Alright, so I've got this differential equation problem here, and I'm supposed to find the time T when the solution reaches 3.99 given that y(0) is 2. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The equation is y' = t y (4 - y) / (1 + t). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it or find a way to integrate it. So, the problem is an initial value problem with y(0) = 2. I need to find when y(T) = 3.99.

First thought: Since this is a first-order differential equation, perhaps I can use separation of variables. Let's see if that's possible. The equation is dy/dt = [t y (4 - y)] / (1 + t). Hmm, can I separate the variables y and t?

Let me try to rearrange the equation. So, dy/dt = [t (4y - y²)] / (1 + t). To separate variables, I'd want all the y terms on one side and the t terms on the other. Let's see:

I can write this as dy / [y (4 - y)] = [t / (1 + t)] dt.

Wait, but the left side is integrating with respect to y, and the right side with respect to t. That seems manageable. So, let's set up the integrals:

∫ [1 / (y (4 - y))] dy = ∫ [t / (1 + t)] dt.

Now, the left integral looks like a rational function, which I can probably solve using partial fractions. Let's tackle that first.

For the left side: 1 / [y (4 - y)] can be expressed as A/y + B/(4 - y). Let's solve for A and B.

1 = A (4 - y) + B y.

Let me plug in y=0: 1 = A(4) → A = 1/4.

Plug in y=4: 1 = B(4) → B = 1/4.

So, the left integral becomes (1/4) ∫ [1/y + 1/(4 - y)] dy.

Integrating that, I get (1/4) [ln|y| - ln|4 - y|] + C. Which simplifies to (1/4) ln |y / (4 - y)| + C.

Now, the right integral: ∫ [t / (1 + t)] dt.

Hmm, perhaps substitution. Let me set u = 1 + t, then du = dt, and t = u - 1. So substituting:

∫ (u - 1)/u du = ∫ [1 - 1/u] du = u - ln|u| + C.

Substituting back, that gives (1 + t) - ln(1 + t) + C.

Putting both integrals together, I have:

(1/4) ln(y/(4 - y)) = (1 + t) - ln(1 + t) + C.

Now, apply the initial condition y(0) = 2 to find C.

At t=0, y=2. Plugging in:

(1/4) ln(2/(4-2)) = (1+0) - ln(1+0) + C.

Simplify:

(1/4) ln(2/2) → (1/4) ln(1) = 0.

On the right side: 1 - ln(1) + C → 1 - 0 + C = 1 + C.

So 0 = 1 + C → C = -1.

So the equation becomes:

(1/4) ln(y/(4 - y)) = (1 + t) - ln(1 + t) -1.

Simplify the right side: (1 + t) -1 = t, so:

(1/4) ln(y/(4 - y)) = t - ln(1 + t).

I can multiply both sides by 4 to make it cleaner:

ln(y/(4 - y)) = 4t - 4 ln(1 + t).

Hmm. Let me rewrite the right side using logarithm properties. So, 4t is just a term, but the -4 ln(1+t) can be written as ln( (1 + t)^-4 ).

Wait, but 4t is not a logarithm, so maybe I can exponentiate both sides to get rid of the ln.

Exponentiating both sides:

y/(4 - y) = e^{4t -4 ln(1 + t)}.

Let me simplify the exponent: 4t -4 ln(1 + t) = 4 [ t - ln(1 + t) ].

So, e^{4 [ t - ln(1 + t) ]} = [e^{t - ln(1 + t)}]^4.

Wait, e^{a*b} is (e^a)^b.

Now, e^{t - ln(1 + t)} can be written as e^t * e^{-ln(1 + t)} = e^t * [1/(1 + t)].

So, putting it all together:

e^{4 [ t - ln(1 + t) ]} = [ e^t / (1 + t) ]^4.

So, the equation becomes:

y/(4 - y) = [ e^t / (1 + t) ]^4.

Let me write that as:

y/(4 - y) = (e^t)/(1 + t))^4.

Hmm, solving for y here. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for y.

Multiply both sides by (4 - y):

y = (e^t/(1 + t))^4 * (4 - y).

Bring all y terms to one side:

y + (e^t/(1 + t))^4 y = 4 (e^t/(1 + t))^4.

Factor out y:

y [1 + (e^t/(1 + t))^4 ] = 4 (e^t/(1 + t))^4.

Thus,

y = [4 (e^t/(1 + t))^4 ] / [1 + (e^t/(1 + t))^4 ].

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps I can simplify it further. Let me let u = (e^t/(1 + t))^4. Then,

y = (4 u) / (1 + u).

Alternatively, this looks like a logistic function, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I need to find T where y(T) = 3.99.

So, set y = 3.99:

3.99 = [4 u ] / (1 + u), where u = (e^T/(1 + T))^4.

Let me solve for u:

Multiply both sides by (1 + u):

3.99 (1 + u) = 4 u.

3.99 + 3.99 u = 4 u.

3.99 = 4u -3.99 u.

3.99 = (0.01) u.

So, u = 3.99 / 0.01 = 399.

So, u = 399. But u = (e^T/(1 + T))^4.

So,

(e^T/(1 + T))^4 = 399.

Take the fourth root of both sides:

e^T/(1 + T) = (399)^(1/4).

Compute 399^(1/4). Let me calculate that.

I know that 4^4=256, and 5^4=625. So 399 is between 4^4 and 5^4. Let me compute 4.5^4.

4.5^4 = (9/2)^4 = (6561)/(16) ≈ 410. So 4.5^4 is about 410, which is larger than 399.

Hmm, so 4.5^4 is 410. So, 399 is a bit less than that. Let me approximate.

Let me compute (4.45)^4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take natural logs. Let's compute ln(399).

ln(399) ≈ ln(400) = ln(4e2) = ln(4) + 2 ln(10) ≈ 1.386 + 2*2.3026 ≈ 1.386 +4.605=5.991.

So, ln(399) ≈ 5.991. So, (1/4) ln(399) ≈ 1.4978.

So, e^{1.4978} ≈ e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

Wait, because e^(1.4978) ≈ e^(1.5) which is about 4.4817.

So, e^T/(1 + T) ≈ 4.4817.

So, e^T ≈ 4.4817 (1 + T).

Let me write that equation: e^T = 4.4817 (1 + T).

Hmm, solving for T. This seems tricky analytically, so perhaps I can use numerical methods or trial and error.

Let me try plugging in some values from the options given.

The options are A to J, with values ranging from about 1.98 to 4.56.

From earlier, I have e^T ≈4.4817 (1 + T).

Let me try T=3:

e^3 ≈ 20.0855. 4.4817*(1+3)=4.4817*4≈17.927.

20.0855 is higher than 17.927, so T=3 gives e^T >4.4817*(1+T).

Let me try T=3. Let me compute both sides:

Left: e^3 ≈20.0855.

Right:4.4817*(4)=17.9268.

So, 20.0855 >17.9268, so we need a T where e^T is less than that, which suggests a lower T?

Wait, but wait. Wait, when T increases, e^T increases exponentially, while 4.4817*(1+T) increases linearly. So, for T=3, e^T is bigger, but perhaps for higher T, e^T would be way bigger. Wait, actually, no, because at T=3, e^3 is already about 20, but let's try a higher T.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step. Let me recheck.

Wait, u = (e^T/(1 + T))^4 =399.

So, (e^T/(1+T))= 399^(1/4)= approximately 4.48.

Ah, so e^T =4.48*(1+T).

Wait, yes. So, e^T =4.48*(1+T).

I need to find T such that e^T/(1 + T) ≈4.48.

Let me try T=3. Let's compute e^3=20.0855, 1+T=4, so e^3/(1+3)=5.021. That's higher than 4.48.

So maybe T is less than 3? Let's try T=2.5.

e^2.5 ≈12.1825, 1+2.5=3.5, so 12.1825/3.5≈3.483. That's lower than 4.48, so T is between 2.5 and 3.

Let me try T=2.8.

e^2.8: Let's compute. 2.8 is 2 +0.8. e^2 ≈7.389, e^0.8≈2.2255, so e^2.8≈7.389 *2.2255≈16.45.

1 +2.8=3.8. So e^2.8/(3.8)≈16.45/3.8≈4.328.

That's very close to 4.48. Because 4.328 is just a bit below 4.48.

So, perhaps T is around 2.8?

Wait, let me compute T=2.85.

e^2.85: Let me approximate. 2.85 is near 2.8, which I had as ~16.45.

Wait, perhaps I can compute e^2.85 more accurately.

Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can use the Newton-Raphson method to solve e^T =4.48 (1 + T).

Let me denote f(T) = e^T -4.48(1+T). We're looking for f(T)=0.

Compute f(2.8) = e^2.8 -4.48*(3.8).

e^2.8: Let me compute using more precise steps.

e^2 =7.38905609893.

e^0.8: Let's compute e^0.8.

We can write e^0.8 = e^(4/5) ≈ 2.225540928492468.

So, e^2.8 =e^2 * e^0.8 ≈7.389056 *2.2255409 ≈16.4446.

So, f(2.8)=16.4446 -4.48*3.8.

4.48 *3.8: 4 *3.8=15.2, 0.48*3.8=1.824, so total 17.024.

So f(2.8)=16.4446 -17.024 ≈-0.5794.

Negative value. So, function is negative at T=2.8.

At T=2.9:

e^2.9: Let me compute. 2.9=2 +0.9.

e^0.9 ≈2.45960311115695.

e^2.9= e^2 * e^0.9 ≈7.389056 *2.459603 ≈18.1741.

f(2.9)=18.1741 -4.48*(3.9).

4.48 *3.9= 4 *3.9=15.6, 0.48*3.9=1.872 → total 17.472.

So f(2.9)=18.1741 -17.472≈0.7021.

So, f(2.9) is positive.

So, the root is between 2.8 and 2.9. Let's use linear approximation.

At T1=2.8, f= -0.5794.

At T2=2.9, f=0.7021.

The change in T is 0.1, and the change in f is 0.7021 - (-0.5794)=1.2815.

We need to find T where f=0. So, the fraction needed is 0.5794 /1.2815 ≈0.452.

So, T≈2.8 + 0.452*(0.1)=2.8+0.0452=2.8452.

So approximately T≈2.845.

Looking at the options, D is 2.84367, which is very close. So, the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me confirm with another iteration. Let's compute T=2.845.

Compute e^2.845 and 4.48*(1+2.845)=4.48*3.845.

Compute 4.48 *3.845: 4*3.845=15.38, 0.48*3.845≈1.8448. So total ≈15.38 +1.8448=17.2248.

Now compute e^2.845.

I can compute e^2.8=16.4446 as earlier.

e^0.045: Using the Taylor series, e^x ≈1 +x +x^2/2 +x^3/6.

x=0.045.

So, e^0.045≈1 +0.045 +0.0010125 +0.0000309 ≈1.0460434.

So, e^2.845= e^2.8 * e^0.045 ≈16.4446 *1.0460434≈16.4446 *1.04≈16.4446 +0.6578≈17.1024.

So, e^2.845≈17.1024.

Then f(T)=17.1024 -17.2248≈-0.1224.

So, f(2.845)≈-0.1224.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that at T=2.845, f would be closer to zero. Hmm, perhaps my initial approximation was off.

Wait, perhaps I should perform a Newton-Raphson step.

Let me take T0=2.9, where f(T0)=0.7021.

Compute f'(T) at T=2.9: f'(T)=e^T -4.48.

At T=2.9, e^2.9≈18.1741, so f'(2.9)=18.1741 -4.48≈13.6941.

Newton-Raphson step: T1 = T0 - f(T0)/f'(T0).

So, T1=2.9 - (0.7021)/(13.6941)≈2.9 -0.0513≈2.8487.

Compute f(2.8487):

e^2.8487: Let me compute. Let me compute e^2.84.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute e^2.8487.

Alternatively, use a calculator-like approach, but perhaps I can approximate.

e^2.84 is between e^2.8=16.4446 and e^2.9=18.1741.

The difference between 2.8 and 2.9 is 0.1, leading to e^2.9 being about 1.7295 higher than e^2.8.

Wait, 2.8487 is 2.8 + 0.0487.

So, e^(2.8+0.0487)=e^2.8 * e^0.0487.

e^0.0487≈1 +0.0487 + (0.0487^2)/2 + (0.0487^3)/6.

Compute:

0.0487^2≈0.002375.

0.0487^3≈0.0001156.

So, e^0.0487≈1 +0.0487 +0.0011875 +0.0000193≈1.0499068.

So, e^2.8487≈16.4446 *1.0499068
