Question:

Which of the following executive orders will most likely be found unconstitutional?

Options:

A: The President issued an executive order instructing all executive branch employees to refrain from using social media during working hours.
B: The President issued an executive order banning all forms of meat consumption within the premises of the executive building, citing health reasons and environmental concerns.
C: The President issued an executive order abolishing a federal agency that was established by an Act of Congress, citing redundancy and inefficiency.
D: In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits. Believing that the Commission is archaic, the President decides that any future funding will simply be a waste of money. He thus executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers.
E: Without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, the President issued an executive order to establish a new federal agency to oversee the operations of all other federal agencies.
F: The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. According to a study, the federal government could save in excess of $250,000 a year in office supply costs if all executive agencies were to use standardized pens and pencils.
G: The President issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in a city dealing with civil unrest, and authorizes the use of military force without the approval of Congress.
H: The President issued an executive order mandating all executive branch employees to take a mandatory vacation for a period of one month.
I: The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.
J: A devastating hurricane damages an island which is part of a foreign country. The storm destroys many homes, resulting in death and injury to thousands. In response to a request from the foreign government for emergency aid, the President, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about executive orders and their constitutionality. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is most likely to be found unconstitutional. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I should remember the basics of executive orders. The President has the authority to issue them under Article II of the Constitution, but they can't exceed the President's constitutional powers or violate existing laws. So any order that goes beyond what the President is allowed to do would be unconstitutional.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The President tells executive branch employees not to use social media during work. That sounds like a workplace policy. I think the President has the authority to manage the executive branch, so this is probably constitutional.

Option B: Bans meat consumption in the executive building for health and environmental reasons. That's about workplace rules again. The President can set policies for federal buildings, so this might be okay. Unless there's a specific law against it, which I don't think there is.

Option C: Abolishes a federal agency created by Congress. Wait, I remember that Congress creates agencies, and the President can't unilaterally abolish them. There's a case, maybe INS v. Chadha, or perhaps a more recent one, where the Supreme Court said the President can't abolish agencies without Congressional approval. So this order would likely be unconstitutional.

Option D: Abrogates the Commission of Birdwatchers, which was established by Congress. Similar to option C. Congress created it, so the President can't just get rid of it. But wait, the President didn't defund it; he just issued an order to abrogate it. That sounds like he's trying to eliminate it without Congress, which he can't do. So this is probably unconstitutional too.

Option E: Establishes a new federal agency without Senate approval. Agencies are usually created by Congress, but the President can create some through executive orders as long as Congress authorizes the funding. Wait, no, Congress has to create federal agencies. The President can't create a new agency on his own without Congressional approval. So this might be unconstitutional.

Option F: Mandates using one brand of pens and pencils to save money. That's a procurement decision. The executive branch can set standards for supplies, so this is probably within their authority. Constitutional.

Option G: Declares emergency and uses military force without Congress. The President can deploy troops in an emergency under certain conditions, but if it's a situation where Congress hasn't authorized it, like a war, that's problematic. But sometimes, the President can act first and then inform Congress. However, using military force without approval might be an overreach, especially if it's a prolonged action. So this could be unconstitutional.

Option H: Mandatory month-long vacation for employees. That's a personnel management issue. The President can set working conditions, but forcing a vacation might interfere with operations. However, I'm not sure if this is an overreach of power. Maybe it's within his authority as the head of the executive branch.

Option I: Dress code requiring white shirts. That's a workplace regulation. The President can set dress codes, so this is probably okay.

Option J: Sends troops abroad without Senate approval. This seems like a foreign policy issue. The President can deploy troops for humanitarian aid as a commander-in-chief, but if it's a military operation, Congress might need to approve it. However, humanitarian assistance is sometimes allowed under executive discretion without explicit Congressional approval, especially if it's temporary.

Now, evaluating which options are unconstitutional.

Option C and D: Both involve abolishing agencies created by Congress. The President generally can't do that. So both C and D are likely unconstitutional. But the question asks for the most likely.

Option E: Creating a new agency without Senate consent. The President can't create agencies without Congressional authority. So E is also unconstitutional.

So which is the correct answer?

Wait, the options are C, D, E, G, maybe.

In the past, the Supreme Court has held that the President cannot abolish an agency created by Congress. For example, in Buckley v. Valeo, the Court said that Congress can create independent agencies but the President can't remove commissioners without cause. But can the President abolish an agency entirely? I think that requires Congressional action. So options C and D involve abolishing agencies, which would be unconstitutional.

Similarly, creating a new agency (option E) without Congress is not allowed. So E is unconstitutional.

Now, looking at the options, the question is which is most likely to be found unconstitutional.

Another point: Option C says the President abolished a federal agency established by Congress. So that's definitely a problem. Similarly, option D does the same.

Which of these is more clearly unconstitutional? Both C and D are bad, but the question gives only one correct answer.

Wait, let me think about other possibilities.

Option G: Using military force without Congress. The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours and get authorization for actions beyond 60 days. But the President can act in emergencies without prior approval. However, deploying military without any Congressional input at all might be unconstitutional if it's a situation where Congress's approval is needed. But sometimes, the President can act first, especially in emergencies.

Option E: Creating a new agency without Senate approval. The President can't create agencies without Congress. So E is also unconstitutional.

Wait, but which of these is more clearly over the line.

In the case of the War Powers Act, the President can send troops for limited times without Congress, but not for extended periods. So G might be constitutional if it's a short-term deployment. But if it's a longer one, it's not.

Looking back, the question is which is most likely to be found unconstitutional.

Another angle: The President's ability to appoint and remove officers. Agencies created by Congress are part of the executive branch, but can the President abolish them? I think the answer is no, because Congress establishes them, and only Congress can abolish them. So options C and D are problematic.

Between C and D, which one is worse? Option C is about abolishing an agency established by Congress, which is a clear overreach. Option D is about the Commission of Birdwatchers, which was created by Congress, and the President is trying to abrogate it. So both are similar.

Wait, but option D says the President is abrogating the Commission, but he's not defunding it; he's just not funding it. Oh wait, no, the question says he's executing a decree abrogating the Commission. So he's eliminating it, not just defunding.

So options C and D are both about abolishing agencies, which is unconstitutional.

Now, looking at the options, the question asks which is most likely to be found unconstitutional. So perhaps option C is the answer.

Wait, but I thought that the President can't create or abolish agencies without Congress. So option C is clearly unconstitutional.

Another point: Option E is about creating a new agency without Senate consent. Can the President create agencies on his own? No, because under Article I, Congress has the authority to create agencies, and the President can't do that without Congressional approval. So option E is also unconstitutional.

So which one is the more direct violation? Creating an agency without Congress's approval is a big deal. Similarly, abolishing an agency is a big deal.

But I'm trying to remember specific cases. For example, in the case of the Federal Trade Commission, the President can't abolish it without Congress.

So which of the options is more clearly unconstitutional.

The question is which is most likely to be found unconstitutional.

Alternatively, perhaps option G is more clearly problematic because the President is deploying military force without Congressional approval. But the President does have some authority in emergencies.

Wait, but the question is about executive orders. So which of these executive orders would most likely be found unconstitutional.

Option C: Abolishing an agency created by Congress. That's a clear overstep because Congress creates agencies, and the President can't unilaterally abolish them.

Similarly, option D is the same situation, but the agency in D is the Commission of Birdwatchers, which was established by Congress in 1887. The President is trying to abrogate it, which he can't do.

So both C and D are unconstitutional.

Wait, but the options are C and D. How to choose between them.

Alternatively, let's think about what each option entails.

Option C: The agency was established by an Act of Congress, and the President abolishes it. That's a direct violation because the President can't undo a Congressional act. So the executive order would be unconstitutional.

Option D: Similar situation, but the agency is the Commission of Birdwatchers. The President is abrogating it via executive decree. Again, unconstitutional.

So perhaps either C or D is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the other options:

Option E: Creating a new agency without Senate consent. That's a violation because Congress must establish agencies.

So perhaps E is also unconstitutional.

Wait, but the President can create agencies through executive orders if Congress has authorized it. For example, through reorganization plans. But if there's no Congressional authorization, he can't create a new agency.

So option E is unconstitutional.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Another approach: which of these are clear violations of separation of powers.

Abolishing an agency created by Congress (C and D) and creating an agency without Congress (E) are all clear separation of powers issues.

The question is which is the most likely to be found unconstitutional.

In the case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court struck down the part of the law that allowed Congress to appoint members of the Federal Election Commission, but I don't think that's directly relevant here.

Wait, in the case of Bowsher v. Synar, the Court held that Congress cannot appoint an officer with executive functions because it violates separation of powers. So that's about appointments, not abolition.

In the case of INS v. Chadha, the Court invalidated the legislative veto, which allowed Congress to overturn executive actions. But that's about Congress overstepping, not the President.

Wait, but the case that comes to mind is the one where the President tried to abolish the Office of the Special Prosecutor, which was an independent counsel. I think that was in the case of Morrison v. Olson, but that's about appointments, not abolition.

Alternatively, in the case of the National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, the issue was recess appointments, but again, not about abolishing agencies.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C or D because the President can't abolish an agency created by Congress.

Alternatively, considering the options, maybe the answer is C or E.

Alternatively, perhaps option G is more clearly unconstitutional because the President can't use military force without Congressional approval beyond a certain point.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: Social media ban during work. That's a management decision. Constitutional.

Option B: No meat in the building. Workplace rule. Constitutional.

Option C: Abolish agency created by Congress. Unconstitutional.

Option D: Abrogate Commission created by Congress. Unconstitutional.

Option E: Create new agency without Senate. Unconstitutional.

Option F: Pens and pencils. Management. Constitutional.

Option G: Military force without Congress. Potentially unconstitutional, but depends on circumstances.

Option H: Mandatory vacation. Maybe an overreach, but not clearly unconstitutional.

Option I: Dress code. Management. Constitutional.

Option J: Humanitarian aid without Senate. Probably constitutional as it's a short-term aid mission.

So the options that are clearly unconstitutional are C, D, and E.

The question is which one is the most likely to be found unconstitutional.

Between C, D, and E.

Option E is about creating a new agency without the Senate's consent, which is a direct violation of Congress's authority to establish agencies. Article I gives Congress the power to create federal agencies, so the President can't do that on his own.

Option C and D are about abolishing agencies, which is also unconstitutional.

So which of these is more clearly a violation.

I think both C and D are equally problematic, but the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C because it's more direct. The President is abolishing an agency, which requires Congressional action.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option E is about creating an agency without advice and consent, which is also a clear violation.

Wait, the President can't create executive agencies without Congressional authorization. So option E is definitely unconstitutional.

So which is worse: creating an agency without Congress or abolishing one without Congress.

I think both are equally bad. But perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but the question is which is most likely to be found unconstitutional. So perhaps the answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in option C, the President is abolishing an agency, which he can't do. But in option D, the agency is archaic, but that doesn't change the fact that the President can't abolish it. So both are bad.

Wait, but the correct answer is probably option C.

Wait, no, another thought: The President can't create or abolish agencies without Congress. So both C and D are unconstitutional.

But the options are given, and the correct answer is among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps option E is the correct answer because creating an agency without Senate approval is a clear overreach.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the correct answer.

I think the correct answer is option C: The President issued an executive order abolishing a federal agency established by Congress. Because Congress creates agencies, and the President can't abolish them without Congressional approval.

So the answer is C.

To determine which executive order is most likely to be found unconstitutional, it is essential to evaluate each option against the President's constitutional powers and the principles of separation of powers. Executive orders must not exceed the President's authority under Article II or violate existing laws. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: The President banning social media use during work hours is a workplace policy within the President's authority to manage the executive branch. **Constitutional**.

- **Option B**: The President banning meat consumption in the executive building for health and environmental reasons is a workplace rule. The President has the authority to set policies for federal buildings. **Constitutional**.

- **Option C**: The President abolishing a federal agency created by Congress is a clear overreach. Congress establishes agencies, and the President cannot unilaterally abolish them without Congressional approval. This violates separation of powers. **Unconstitutional**.

- **Option D**: The President abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers, established by Congress, is similarly unconstitutional. The President cannot eliminate an agency created by Congress without its approval. **Unconstitutional**.

- **Option E**: The President creating a new federal agency without Senate approval violates Congress's authority under Article I to establish agencies. The President cannot create agencies without Congressional authorization. **Unconstitutional**.

- **Option F**: Mandating the use of specific pens and pencils is a procurement decision within the executive branch's authority. **Constitutional**.

- **Option G**: Declaring a state of emergency and deploying military force without Congressional approval may be unconstitutional if prolonged, but the President can act in emergencies under certain conditions. This is less clearly unconstitutional than options C, D, or E.

- **Option H**: Mandating a month-long vacation for employees is a personnel management issue. While it may seem unusual, it is within the President's authority as head of the executive branch. **Constitutional**.

- **Option I**: Requiring a dress code for executive branch employees is a workplace regulation within the President's authority. **Constitutional**.

- **Option J**: Deploying troops for humanitarian aid without Senate approval is likely constitutional, as the President has discretion in foreign policy for temporary, non-military operations.

Among the unconstitutional options (C, D, and E), **Option C** stands out as the most direct violation because it involves the President abolishing an agency explicitly established by Congress, which is a clear overreach of executive authority. While options D and E are also unconstitutional, option C is the most straightforward example of such a violation.

**Answer: C**
