Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the pressure in interplanetary space, which is given as 10^-16 torr. They also mention that this corresponds to a density of about 4 molecules per cubic centimeter. The task is to find the temperature that must be assigned to these molecules for this to be true.

Hmm, I remember that in physics, the ideal gas law relates pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of molecules. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

But wait, here we're dealing with molecules per cubic centimeter, not moles. Oh right, maybe I should think in terms of the number of molecules and use the Boltzmann constant instead of R. Because R is for moles, and here we're dealing with individual molecules.

So the ideal gas law can also be written as P = (N/V) * k_B * T, where N is the number of molecules, V is the volume, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Alright, let's break down the given data. The pressure P is 1e-16 torr. I need to convert that into Pascals because standard units are usually in SI. I remember that 1 torr is approximately 133.322 Pascals. So 1e-16 torr would be 1e-16 * 133.322 Pa. Let me calculate that: 1e-16 * 133.322 is 1.33322e-14 Pa.

Next, the number density N/V is given as 4 molecules per cubic centimeter. I should convert that to molecules per cubic meter since SI units are in meters. 1 cubic centimeter is 1e-6 cubic meters (because 1 cm is 0.01 m, so cube is 1e-6 m³). So 4 molecules/cm³ is 4 * 1e6 molecules/m³, which is 4e6 molecules/m³.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 cm³ is (0.01 m)^3 = 1e-6 m³. So 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³. So to get molecules per m³, I multiply by 1e6. So 4 molecules/cm³ = 4 * 1e6 molecules/m³ = 4e6 molecules/m³.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think. If I have 4 molecules in 1 cm³, which is 1e-6 m³, then the number per m³ would be 4 / (1e-6) ) = 4e6 molecules/m³. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, knowing that, I can plug into the equation P = (N/V) * k_B * T.

I need to solve for T. So rearranging the formula:

T = P / ( (N/V) * k_B )

I have all the values except for k_B. Let me remember the value of the Boltzmann constant. I think k_B is approximately 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So let's plug in the numbers.

P is 1.33322e-14 Pa.

N/V is 4e6 molecules/m³.

So T = (1.33322e-14 Pa) / (4e6 m^-3 * 1.380649e-23 J/K)

Let me compute the denominator first: 4e6 * 1.380649e-23 = 4 * 1.380649e-17 = 5.522596e-17 J·m^-3·K^-1.

Wait, Pa is equivalent to J/m³, right? Because 1 Pa = 1 N/m² = 1 (kg·m/s²)/m² = kg/(m·s²). And J is kg·m²/s², so J/m³ is kg/(m·s²), which is Pa. So yes, P is in J/m³.

So the denominator is 5.522596e-17 J/(m³·K).

So T = 1.33322e-14 / 5.522596e-17 = let's compute that.

1.33322e-14 / 5.522596e-17 = (1.33322 / 5.522596) * 1e3.

Calculating 1.33322 / 5.522596: Let me approximate. 1.333 is about a third of 5.522, so 0.241 approx. So 0.241 * 1e3 = 241 K.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

1.33322 divided by 5.522596. Let me compute:

5.522596 × 0.24 = approx 1.3257, because 5.522596 × 0.2 = 1.104519, and 5.522596 × 0.04=0.2209038, adding them gives 1.325423. So 0.24 gives about 1.3254.

The numerator is 1.33322, which is about 1.33322 - 1.32542 = 0.0078 higher. So how much more?

Each 0.001 in x adds roughly 5.522596 * 0.001 = 0.0055226 to the product. So 0.0078 / 0.0055226 ≈ 1.41. So x ≈ 0.24 + 0.00141 = 0.24141, so T ≈ 241.41 K.

Wait, but wait, I think I have an error. Because the initial calculation was 1.33322e-14 / 5.522596e-17. Let me compute the exponents first.

1e-14 / 1e-17 = 1e3. So 1.33322 / 5.522596 * 1e3.

1.33322 / 5.522596 = approximately 0.2413 (as I did earlier). So 0.2413 * 1e3 = 241.3 K.

So T is approximately 241 K.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, 1e-14 divided by 1e-17 is 1e3, yes. So 1.33322e-14 / 5.522596e-17 = (1.33322 /5.522596) * (1e-14 / 1e-17) ) = (0.2413) * 1e3 = 241.3 K.

So approximately 241 K.

Now, what's 241 K in Celsius? Because the options are given in Celsius.

Kelvin to Celsius is T°C = T(K) - 273.15.

So 241 K - 273.15 = -32.15°C.

Looking at the options, F is -31°C. That's the closest.

So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conversion of pressure.

Wait, 1 torr is 133.322368 pascals, correct. So 1e-16 torr is 1e-16 * 133.322368 Pa = 1.33322368e-14 Pa. So that part was correct.

N/V was 4 molecules/cm³ converted to m^-3. 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so 4 / 1e-6 = 4e6 m^-3. Correct.

Plugging into P = n k T => T = P/(n k).

Yes, that's right.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation again for any arithmetic errors.

Let me compute 1.33322e-14 divided by (4e6 * 1.380649e-23):

Denominator: 4e6 = 4,000,000 = 4e6.

4e6 * 1.380649e-23 = 4 * 1.380649e-17 = 5.522596e-17.

So T = 1.33322e-14 / 5.522596e-17 = (1.33322 /5.522596) * 1e3.

1.33322 /5.522596 ≈ 0.2413.

Multiply by 1e3: 241.3 K.

241.3 K is approximately 241 - 273 = -32°C.

Looking at the options, F is -31°C, which is the closest. So the answer is F.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should consider if the number of molecules is per cm³, and if that's the same as number density. Yes, number density is number per volume, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ideal gas law in terms of moles would have been better, but I think using the Boltzmann version is correct here since we're given molecules instead of moles.

Alternatively, let's try another approach. Let me compute using n as moles.

Wait, n would be number of moles. Number of molecules is 4 per cm³, so per m³ it's 4e6 molecules/m³.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So number of moles per m³ is 4e6 / 6.022e23 = approx 6.64e-18 mol/m³.

So then using PV = nRT.

P is 1.33322e-14 Pa.

n is 6.64e-18 mol/m³.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So T = P/(n R) = (1.33322e-14) / (6.64e-18 * 8.314).

Compute denominator: 6.64e-18 * 8.314 ≈ 5.523e-17.

So T = 1.33322e-14 / 5.523e-17 ≈ (1.33322 /5.523) * 1e3 ≈ 0.2415 * 1e3 = 241.5 K.

Same result as before, so 241.5 K → -31.65°C, which is approximately -32°C. The closest option is F: -31°C. So that's the answer.

The pressure in interplanetary space is given as \( P = 10^{-16} \, \text{torr} \), which corresponds to a density of \( 4 \, \text{molecules/cm}^3 \). To determine the temperature \( T \) of the molecules, we use the ideal gas law in the form:

\[
P = \frac{N}{V} k_B T
\]

where \( P \) is the pressure, \( \frac{N}{V} \) is the number density of molecules, \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin. Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{P}{\frac{N}{V} k_B}
\]

### Step 1: Convert pressure to SI units
The pressure in SI units is:

\[
P = 10^{-16} \, \text{torr} \times 133.322 \, \text{Pa/torr} = 1.33322 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{Pa}
\]

### Step 2: Convert number density to SI units
The number density is given as \( 4 \, \text{molecules/cm}^3 \). Since \( 1 \, \text{cm}^3 = 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3 \), the number density in SI units is:

\[
\frac{N}{V} = 4 \times 10^6 \, \text{molecules/m}^3
\]

### Step 3: Plug values into the equation
The Boltzmann constant is \( k_B = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Substituting the values:

\[
T = \frac{1.33322 \times 10^{-14}}{(4 \times 10^6)(1.380649 \times 10^{-23})}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
(4 \times 10^6)(1.380649 \times 10^{-23}) = 5.522596 \times 10^{-17}
\]

Now divide:

\[
T = \frac{1.33322 \times 10^{-14}}{5.522596 \times 10^{-17}} = (1.33322 / 5.522596) \times 10^3 \approx 0.2413 \times 10^3 = 241.3 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 4: Convert temperature to Celsius
To convert Kelvin to Celsius:

\[
T_{\text{Celsius}} = T_{\text{Kelvin}} - 273.15
\]

\[
T_{\text{Celsius}} = 241.3 - 273.15 = -31.85^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The closest option to \( -31.85^\circ \text{C} \) is \( -31^\circ \text{C} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
