Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the nutritional status of older people. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is correct. The options are from A to J. Let's go through each one step by step.

Option A: Consuming multivitamins can eliminate all nutritional deficiencies in older people. Hmm, I don't think that's true. Multivitamins can help, but they probably don't cover every possible deficiency. Plus, some people might have specific issues that require more targeted supplements. So A might not be correct.

Option B: High protein diet is harmful for older people. Wait, I remember that as people age, they might need more protein because of muscle loss. So a high protein diet being harmful doesn't sound right. Unless there's a specific condition, but generally, I think it's not harmful. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Older people are more prone to Vitamin A overdose. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin, so it can accumulate in the body. But do older people have a higher risk of overdose? I'm not sure. Maybe if they take a lot of supplements. But I'm not certain about this one. I'll keep it in mind.

Option D: All older people require dietary supplementation to maintain nutritional status. That doesn't sound right. Some might need it, but not all. It depends on their diet and health. So D is likely incorrect.

Option E: The risk of high iron stores is greater than the risk of iron deficiency in older people. Wait, I think older adults, especially men, are more at risk for iron overload because they don't lose iron as much, and with aging, the body's regulation might not work as well. Also, iron deficiency is more common in women of reproductive age. So maybe E is correct.

Option F: Older people should consume more sodium to maintain their health. No, that's not right. High sodium is linked to hypertension and other issues. Older people are usually advised to limit sodium intake. So F is incorrect.

Option G: All older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status. No, that's too absolute. Some might have adequate levels, especially if they take supplements or have sun exposure. So G is wrong.

Option H: Low dietary intake of vitamin B12 is the main cause of vitamin B12 deficiency in older people. Wait, I thought that in older adults, the main issue is absorption, not dietary intake. They might have pernicious anemia or issues with intrinsic factor which affects B12 absorption. So H is probably incorrect.

Option I: Calcium intake is not important for older people. Definitely not. Calcium is crucial for bone health, especially in preventing osteoporosis. So I is wrong.

Option J: There is strong evidence that vitamin C supplements lower the risk of cancer in older people. I don't recall any strong evidence linking vitamin C supplements to cancer risk reduction. Some studies might suggest benefits, but it's not definitive. So J is probably incorrect.

So going back, the correct answer seems to be E. The risk of high iron stores is greater than the risk of iron deficiency in older people. This makes sense because as people age, their ability to excrete iron decreases, and if they take iron supplements without needing them, it can build up. Also, conditions like hemochromatosis can cause iron overload, which is more common in older adults, especially men after they stop losing iron through blood donations or other means.

The correct answer is **E**. 

**Explanation:**
- **Option E** is correct because older people are at a higher risk of iron overload due to decreased iron excretion and potential accumulation from supplements. Iron deficiency is more common in younger populations, particularly women of reproductive age.
- **Option A** is incorrect because multivitamins cannot eliminate all deficiencies; they only supplement a balanced diet.
- **Option B** is incorrect as high protein is generally beneficial for older adults to combat muscle loss.
- **Option C** is incorrect because, while Vitamin A toxicity is possible, it's not specifically more prone in older people.
- **Option D** is incorrect because not all older people need supplements; it depends on their diet and health.
- **Option F** is incorrect as high sodium is harmful and typically advised against.
- **Option G** is incorrect because not all older people in Western countries have low vitamin D.
- **Option H** is incorrect because vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults is usually due to absorption issues, not low intake.
- **Option I** is incorrect because calcium is crucial for bone health.
- **Option J** is incorrect as there's no strong evidence vitamin C reduces cancer risk.

**Answer:** E
