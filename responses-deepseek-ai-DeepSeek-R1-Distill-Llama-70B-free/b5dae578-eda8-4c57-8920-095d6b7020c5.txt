Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about an isobar map. Hmm, I remember from my geography class that maps use different types of lines to represent various data. Let me think about what each term means.

The question is asking what an isobar map shows. The options are A through J, each representing different factors like wind speed, elevation, precipitation, etc. I think isobar relates to pressure, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I remember something about iso- meaning same and bar relating to pressure. So isobars must connect points with the same atmospheric pressure.

Let me go through each option. Option A is wind speed—that's anemometers and wind maps. B is elevation, which would be contour lines on a topographic map. C is precipitation, which I think is isohyets. D is population density, which uses different shading or colors. E is surface temperature, maybe isotherms? F is daylight hours, which I'm not too sure about. G is humidity levels, perhaps isohumes. H is cloud coverage, which doesn't ring a bell with isobar. I is atmospheric pressure—yes, that sounds right. J is air quality, which I don't think is related to isobars.

So putting it together, isobar maps connect points of equal atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I: atmospheric pressure.
