Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Describe briefly the characteristics of the ontogeny of a humanbeing from a zygote to a mature fetus. What is the significanceof this?

Options:

A: Ontogeny refers to the development of social behaviors in humans from infancy to adulthood.
B: Ontogeny is the study of morphological changes of an organism throughout its lifespan.
C: The ontogeny of a human begins with the birth and ends with the onset of puberty.
D: Ontogeny is the sequence of events involved in the evolutionary development of a species over time.
E: Ontogeny represents the individual development of an organism.
F: The ontogeny of the human embryo reveals to some extent the evolutionary history of man. The significance of this is that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
G: Ontogeny describes the genetic control of cell growth.
H: Ontogeny involves the maturation of the immune system from birth to the aging process.
I: The ontogeny of a human being starts at adolescence and continues until the individual reaches full emotional and intellectual maturity.
J: Ontogeny is the process of an individual organism growing organically.

Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the ontogeny of a human being from a zygote to a mature fetus. Let me think about what I know about this topic.

First, the question is asking for a brief description of the characteristics of ontogeny and its significance. I remember that ontogeny is the development of an organism from the fertilized egg (zygote) through all stages of its life. So, it's about the individual's development, not the species as a whole.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Ontogeny refers to the development of social behaviors from infancy to adulthood. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Social behaviors are more about psychology and sociology, not the biological development stages like zygote to fetus.

Option B: Study of morphological changes throughout lifespan. Well, that's closer. Ontogeny does involve changes in form and structure, but the option doesn't specifically mention the significance part, which the question asks for. Also, the significance part is crucial here.

Option C: Begins with birth and ends at puberty. No, that's not correct. Ontogeny starts much earlier, at the zygote stage, way before birth. So C is wrong.

Option D: Sequence of events in evolutionary development of a species over time. That's more about phylogeny, the evolutionary history of the species, not the individual's development. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Represents individual development of an organism. That sounds right. Ontogeny is indeed the individual's development, so E could be part of the correct answer, but the option doesn't address the significance part which the question asks for.

Option F: The ontogeny of the embryo reveals evolutionary history, significance is that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Wait, I remember something about the recapitulation theory. It's the idea that the stages of an embryo resemble the evolutionary ancestors. So the human embryo goes through stages similar to fish (gill slits) or other animals, which shows our evolutionary past. So F seems to cover both the description and the significance.

Option G: Genetic control of cell growth. That's more about specific aspects of development, like how genes regulate growth, but not the overall ontogeny or its significance.

Option H: Maturation of immune system from birth to aging. This is a specific system, not the overall development from zygote to fetus.

Option I: Starts at adolescence. No, ontogeny starts at the zygote, much earlier than adolescence.

Option J: Process of an organism growing organically. This is vague and doesn't address the significance. Plus, J doesn't mention the stages or the evolutionary aspect.

So looking back, the correct answer should be F. Because it correctly states that the human embryo's development reflects evolutionary history (phylogeny) and that the significance is that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. That's the Biogenetic Law or recapitulation theory proposed by Ernst Haeckel, I think.

The correct answer is:

**F: The ontogeny of the human embryo reveals to some extent the evolutionary history of man. The significance of this is that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.**

This option accurately describes how the development of a human from zygote to fetus reflects evolutionary history, with embryonic stages resembling ancestral forms, and explains the significance through the concept of recapitulation.

Answer: F
