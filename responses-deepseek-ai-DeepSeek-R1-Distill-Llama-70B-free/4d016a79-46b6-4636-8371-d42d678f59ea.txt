Okay, so I've got this problem here about pumping oil through a pipe, and I need to find the pressure drop and the horsepower for two different flow rates. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the pipe is horizontal, 4 inches in diameter, and 5280 feet long. The oil's density is 59.3 lb/ft³ and viscosity is 50 centipoise. Oh wait, centipoise... I remember that's 0.01 Poise, right? So 50 cp is 0.5 Poise. Or wait, no, 1 Poise = 100 cp, so 50 cp is 0.5 Poise. Right.

The flow rates are 10 lb/sec and 50 lb/sec. The question says to calculate the drop in pressure and the theoretical horsepower. Oh, and for turbulent flow, the Darcy friction factor is 10% higher than for a smooth pipe. So I guess I need to calculate the friction factor first, then adjust it if the flow is turbulent.

Wait, first I should probably determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number will tell me that. Reynolds number (Re) is (density * velocity * diameter) / viscosity. But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Since we're using imperial units here, let's think in terms of lb, ft, seconds.

Density is given as 59.3 lb/ft³. Viscosity is 50 cp, which is 0.5 Poise. Oh wait, Poise is in Pascals-seconds? No, wait, in the imperial system, 1 Poise is 1 lb·s/ft². So 50 cp is 0.5 lb·s/ft².

I need to find the velocity for each flow rate. The flow rate is mass per second, so 10 lb/sec and 50 lb/sec. The cross-sectional area of the pipe is needed to find velocity. The pipe is 4 inches diameter, so 4/12 ft = 1/3 ft. Radius is 1/6 ft. Area A = π r² = π*(1/6)^2 = π/36 ≈ 0.08727 ft².

So velocity v is mass flow rate divided by (density * area). Because flow rate (Q) in mass per time is density * area * velocity. So Q = ρ * A * v → v = Q/(ρ A).

Wait, let me think again. No, actually, mass flow rate (m_dot) is given as 10 lb/sec. Since density (ρ) is mass per volume, m_dot = ρ * Q_volumetric. So Q_volumetric (volume per second) is m_dot / ρ. Alternatively, Q_volume = A * v. So v = Q_volume / A = (m_dot / ρ) / A.

So for each flow rate, m_dot is given, so let's compute v for each.

First case: 10 lb/sec.

v1 = (10 lb/s) / (59.3 lb/ft³) / (π*(1/3 ft)^2 /4 )

Wait, wait, no. The area is A = π (d/2)^2. For 4 inch diameter, d=4/12 ft = 1/3 ft. So radius is 1/6 ft. So A = π*(1/6)^2 = π/36 ≈ 0.08727 ft².

So for m_dot =10 lb/s:

v1 = (10 lb/s) / (59.3 lb/ft³) ) / (π/36 ft²) )

Wait, no: m_dot = ρ * A * v → v = m_dot / (ρ * A)

So v1 = 10 / (59.3 * (π/36)) )

Calculate the denominator: 59.3 * (π/36) ≈ 59.3 * 0.08727 ≈ 5.177 lb/ft³ * ft² → Wait, units? Hmm, let me see. m_dot is lb/sec, ρ is lb/ft³, A is ft². So denominator is lb/ft³ * ft² = lb/ft. Hmm, but numerator is lb/sec. So the units for v would be (lb/sec) / (lb/ft) ) = ft/s. That makes sense.

So v1 = 10 / (59.3 * (π/36)) → Let's compute that.

Compute 59.3 * (π/36):

π ≈ 3.1416 → 3.1416 /36 ≈ 0.08727. So 59.3 * 0.08727 ≈ 5.177. So v1 ≈ 10 /5.177 ≈ 1.93 ft/s.

Similarly for m_dot2 =50 lb/s:

v2 =50/(59.3 * (π/36)) =50 /5.177 ≈9.65 ft/s.

Now, compute Reynolds number for each case.

Re = (density * velocity * diameter) / viscosity.

But wait, density is in lb/ft³, velocity in ft/s, diameter in ft, viscosity in lb·s/ft².

Wait, let me check the units for Re. It's dimensionless, so the units should cancel out.

Re = (ρ [lb/ft³]) * v [ft/s] * D [ft] / μ [lb·s/ft²]

Let's see: (lb/ft³) * (ft/s) * ft ) / (lb·s/ft²) )

Multiply numerator: lb * ft²/(s) * ft → lb·ft³/(s). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (lb/ft³) * (ft/s) * ft → (lb * ft/s * ft) ) / ft³ → (lb * ft²/s) / ft³ → lb/(ft s).

Denominator is lb·s/ft².

So Re = (lb/(ft s)) / (lb s/ft²) ) → (lb/(ft s)) * (ft²/(lb s)) → (ft/(s²)). Hmm, that doesn't make sense. I must be miscalculating the units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert viscosity from Poise to lb·s/ft² correctly. Because 1 Poise is 1 dyne·s/cm². In imperial units, 1 Poise = 0.0020886 lb·s/ft². Because 1 dyne is 2.2481e-6 lb, 1 cm is 0.03281 ft. So 1 Poise = (2.2481e-6 lb * s) / (0.03281 ft)^2 → let me calculate that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert the viscosity from cp to lb·s/ft² using the conversion factor. 1 cp = 0.000672 lb·s/ft². Because 1 cp = 0.01 Poise, and 1 Poise is approximately 0.0672 lb·s/ft². So 50 cp = 50 * 0.000672 lb·s/ft² = 0.0336 lb·s/ft².

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me double-check the conversion factors. 

Yes, 1 Poise (P) is equal to 0.0672 lb·s/ft². So 1 centiPoise (cP) is 0.01 Poise, so 0.01 * 0.0672 = 0.000672 lb·s/ft² per cP. So 50 cP is 50 * 0.000672 = 0.0336 lb·s/ft².

So μ = 0.0336 lb·s/ft².

Now, for the first case, v1 is 1.93 ft/s. D is 1/3 ft.

Re1 = (59.3 lb/ft³) * (1.93 ft/s) * (1/3 ft) / (0.0336 lb·s/ft²)

Let me calculate numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 59.3 * 1.93 * (1/3) → 59.3 * 1.93 ≈ 114.4 → 114.4 /3 ≈ 38.133 lb/ft²·s.

Denominator: 0.0336 lb·s/ft².

So Re1 = 38.133 /0.0336 → approximately 1135.9.

Wait, is that right? Wait, 38.133 divided by 0.0336.

38 / 0.0336 is around 1130. So Re1 is about 1136. That's in the transitional range, right? Because Re=2000 is typically turbulent, below 2000 is laminar or transitional. So 1136 is probably in the laminar or transitional flow. But wait, the problem says to assume turbulent flow and use a Darcy friction factor 10% higher than smooth pipe. Hmm, but maybe I should compute Re for each case.

Wait, for the second flow rate, m_dot=50 lb/s, v=9.65 ft/s.

Re2 = (59.3) * 9.65 * (1/3) / (0.0336)

Compute numerator: 59.3 *9.65 = 572.3 → 572.3 /3 ≈ 190.77 → 190.77 / 0.0336 ≈ 5680. So Re2 is about 5680, which is definitely turbulent.

So perhaps both cases are turbulent? Wait, no, because for the first case Re is 1135, which is below 2000, so probably laminar. But the problem says for the case of turbulent flow, f is 10% higher. So maybe each case could have different Re.

Wait, but the question says "for the case of turbulent flow", so I think they are both turbulent. Or perhaps the first isn't, but the problem says to calculate for both, perhaps each as per their flow.

Wait, the question says: "if the oil density is 59.3 lb/ft³ and the viscosity is 50 cp. For the case of turbulent flow, assume the Darcy friction factor to be 10 per cent higher than calculated for a smooth pipe."

So perhaps for each flow rate, if the flow is turbulent, we take f as 10% higher than smooth. But if it's not turbulent, maybe we don't.

Wait, but in the first case, Re is 1135, which is below 2000, so the flow is laminar. So for the first case, f would be 64/Re, perhaps, if it's smooth. But wait, if it's a smooth pipe, then for laminar flow, f=64/Re. But for turbulent, we use other correlations.

But the problem says, for the case of turbulent flow (so when Re>2000), f is 10% higher than smooth. So for the first case, since Re is 1135, which is below 2000, it's laminar, so f=64/Re.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The problem may be simplifying things, saying to assume that the flow is turbulent for both cases, but I don't think that's correct. Because the first flow rate may be in laminar or transitional flow.

Wait, but let me check the given options to see if they make sense. The options have varying pressure drops and power. For the 10 lb/s, the pressure drops are around 15-25 psi, and the power is around 0.8-1.2 hp. For 50 lb/s, the pressure drops are 355-400 psi, and power 75-95 hp.

Hmm, but let's proceed. So perhaps for each flow rate, compute whether it's laminar or turbulent, then compute f accordingly.

So first case:

m_dot=10 lb/s → Re=1135 → laminar. So f=64/Re.

Wait, but wait, for smooth pipes, in laminar flow f=64/Re. But for turbulent flow, in the smooth pipe, f is calculated using the appropriate correlation, like the Colebrook equation or the Moody diagram.

Wait, but the problem says, for turbulent flow, assume f is 10% higher than for a smooth pipe. So perhaps for the first case, since Re <2000, it's laminar, so f=64/Re. For the second case, Re=5680, turbulent, so f is 10% higher than smooth.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed.

First case: Re=1135 → laminar → f=64/Re.

So f1=64/1135≈0.0563.

Second case: Re=5680 → turbulent.

For a smooth pipe, the friction factor f can be found using the Moody diagram or the Colebrook-White equation. Alternatively, for fully turbulent flow in a smooth pipe, f is approximately 0.0034 when the pipe is smooth, but that's for very high Re. Alternatively, we can use the formula for f in the turbulent regime for smooth pipes: f = 0.25 / (log(ε/D) ... wait, but without the relative roughness ε/D, perhaps we can't compute it directly. Hmm, but the problem says to assume the pipe is smooth, except that when flow is turbulent, f is 10% higher than smooth. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says: "For the case of turbulent flow, assume the Darcy friction factor to be 10 per cent higher than calculated for a smooth pipe." So if the flow is turbulent, f = 1.1 * f_smooth.

But to compute f_smooth, perhaps we can use the Moody diagram. Since the pipe is smooth, perhaps we can approximate f_smooth for the given Re.

For the first case, Re=1135, which is laminar, so f=64/Re≈0.0563.

Second case, Re=5680, turbulent.

Looking up a Moody diagram for smooth pipes at Re=5680, the friction factor is around 0.020. Because for Re=4000, f is about 0.024 for smooth pipes, and as Re increases, f decreases. At Re=10,000, f is about 0.014. So at 5000, maybe around 0.018 to 0.020.

Wait, let me think of the formula for turbulent flow in smooth pipes. The formula is f = 0.25 / (log(Re/7))². Wait, no, perhaps it's the Prandtl formula: f = (1/(2* (log(Re/2.51) )² )).

Wait, no, another approach: perhaps for smooth pipes, the friction factor can be approximated by the Blasius formula for Re between 4000 and 100,000: f = 0.316 / Re^0.25.

At Re=5680, f = 0.316 / (5680)^0.25.

Compute 5680^0.25: let's see, square root of 5680 is about 75.36, then sqrt(75.36) is about 8.68. So f≈0.316/8.68≈0.0364.

Wait, but using Blasius formula gives higher f than what I thought earlier. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps for a smooth pipe at Re=5680, the friction factor f is about 0.020. Hmm, perhaps I should just proceed with an approximate value, say f_smooth=0.020, then f_turbulent=1.1 * 0.020=0.022.

Wait, but that seems a bit low. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact calculation.

Wait, using the formula for smooth pipes in turbulent flow, the friction factor can be calculated using the Colebrook equation, which is:

1/sqrt(f) = 2 log(Re sqrt(f)/2.51) - 2 log(ε/D /3.7)

But since the pipe is smooth, ε/D → 0, so the second term becomes log(1/3.7) → negative. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Alternatively, the Haaland equation approximates it as:

1/sqrt(f) = 2 log( (Re / (1 + 0.01 )) ) 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the Moody diagram values. For a smooth pipe at Re=5,680, the friction factor f is approximately 0.0205.

So f_smooth =0.0205, then f=1.1 * 0.0205=0.02255.

But perhaps I'm getting too detailed here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation with f calculated as per the flow regime.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the Hazen-Williams equation or another method, but I think Darcy-Weisbach is the way to go.

So, for each case, compute the pressure drop using the Darcy-Weisbach equation:

ΔP = f * (L/D) * (ρ v²)/2

Where f is the Darcy friction factor, L is the pipe length, D is diameter, ρ is density, and v is velocity.

Once I have ΔP, then the power required is (m_dot * g * ΔP) / (efficiency * ...), but wait, actually, the theoretical power is (flow rate * pressure drop) / (converters). Wait, because power is force times velocity. But m_dot is mass per second, and pressure is force per area, so perhaps:

Power in ft-lb/s: (ΔP * Q_volume) → because ΔP is force/area, Q_volume is volume per second (ft³/s), so ΔP * Q → (lb/ft²) * (ft³/s) )= lb·ft/s = 1 hp (since 1 hp=550 lb·ft/s).

Wait, let me think. The power (P) is equal to the pressure drop (ΔP) multiplied by the volumetric flow rate (Q).

So P = ΔP (lb/ft²) * Q (ft³/s) → (lb·ft²/ft²) * ft³/s → lb·ft/s.

Since 1 hp = 550 lb·ft/s, so P (hp) = (ΔP * Q) / 550.

Wait, but let's make sure of units.

ΔP is in psi, which is lb per square inch. So we need to convert that to lb per square foot to match units. 1 psi = 144 lb/ft².

So P in ft-lb/s is (ΔP * 144
