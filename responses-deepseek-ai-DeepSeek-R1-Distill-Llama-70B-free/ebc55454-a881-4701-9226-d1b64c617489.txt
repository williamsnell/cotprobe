Question:

If 200 computers with a retail value of $100000 are domestically produced in 2005 but not sold until 2006 then GDP in 2005 is

Options:

A: $100000 higher because of the computers.
B: unaffected because the computers were not sold.
C: adjusted in 2006 to reflect the sale of the computers.
D: 200 higher because of the computers.
E: $100000 lower because of the computers.
F: higher by the wholesale value of the computers.
G: higher by the retail value of the computers.
H: $200000 higher because of the computers.
I: unaffected until 2006 when the computers are sold and the figure for GDP in 2005 is revised.
J: lower because of the computers.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this GDP question. Let's see what the question is asking. 

Alright, the scenario is that there are 200 computers, each with a retail value of $100,000. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total retail value is $100,000, right? Because 200 computers at $100 each would be $20,000, but the question says the retail value is $100,000. Hmm, maybe each computer is $500, because 200 times 500 is 100,000. Yeah, that makes sense. So 200 computers, each worth $500, totaling $100,000.

These computers were domestically produced in 2005 but not sold until 2006. So the production happened in 2005, but the sale is in 2006. The question is about how this affects GDP in 2005.

I remember that GDP is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a specific period. So it's about production, not sales. But I need to be careful because there are different ways GDP can be calculated, like the expenditure approach and the income approach.

Wait, the production happened in 2005, so under the production approach, these computers should be included in 2005's GDP, right? Because GDP counts goods when they are produced, not when they are sold. So even if they're not sold in that year, as long as they're produced, they contribute to GDP.

But wait, wait. What if the computers are unsold? Do they count? Because sometimes, if goods are unsold, they're considered inventory. So the production would still count, but the goods would be added to inventory. So when the computers are made, the manufacturer's GDP contribution includes the value of the computers, even if they're just sitting in inventory.

So in 2005, the computers are produced, so they're part of GDP. Even if they're not sold until 2006, the production in 2005 means GDP for 2005 increases by the value of those computers.

So the options are:

A: $100000 higher because of the computers. That would make sense because the total value is $100,000.

B: unaffected because not sold. No, because production counts, so it's affected.

C: Adjusted in 2006 when sold. No, GDP is annual, so production in 2005 is counted in 2005.

D: 200 higher. That's only if each computer was $1, which isn't the case here.

E: $100k lower. No, it's higher.

F: Higher by wholesale. The question says retail value is $100k, but GDP uses production value, which could be wholesale. Hmm, maybe, but the question states the value, so maybe it's considered.

Wait, but GDP is based on the value added at each stage. So when the computers are produced, the manufacturer's value is added. But depending on whether it's counted as retail or production cost, maybe. But the question gives the retail value as $100k, but for GDP, it's the value when produced, which could be lower than retail. But the question says the retail value is $100k, but since they were produced in 2005, the value would be included in 2005's GDP regardless of when they're sold.

So the correct answer would be that GDP in 2005 is higher by the value of the computers when produced, which the question states as $100,000. So option A says $100,000 higher because of the computers, which would be correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes, when goods are unsold, they're included in the change in inventories component of GDP. So the production is counted, and any unsold goods go into inventory, which is part of investment (I think). So the value is still included in GDP.

Yes, so the answer should be A. The GDP in 2005 is $100,000 higher because the computers were produced that year, even though they were sold the next year.

The question involves determining how the production of 200 computers with a total retail value of $100,000 in 2005, but not sold until 2006, affects GDP in 2005. GDP measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a specific period. It is based on production, not sales. Even if the computers remain unsold in 2005 and are added to inventory, their production in 2005 means they contribute to GDP for that year.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The computers' production in 2005 adds $100,000 to GDP in 2005, regardless of when they are sold.
- **B**: Incorrect. GDP is affected because the computers were produced in 2005, even if not sold.
- **C**: Incorrect. GDP is calculated annually based on production, so 2005's GDP is not adjusted in 2006.
- **D**: Incorrect. The value of the computers is $100,000, not $200.
- **E**: Incorrect. GDP is higher, not lower, due to the production of the computers.
- **F**: Incorrect. The question specifies the retail value, which is used here to determine GDP impact.
- **G**: Incorrect. GDP includes the value of production, which aligns with the retail value provided.
- **H**: Incorrect. The total value is $100,000, not $200,000.
- **I**: Incorrect. GDP for 2005 is finalized based on 2005 production and is not revised in 2006.
- **J**: Incorrect. GDP is higher, not lower, due to the computers' production.

Thus, the correct answer is that GDP in 2005 is $100,000 higher because of the computers.
