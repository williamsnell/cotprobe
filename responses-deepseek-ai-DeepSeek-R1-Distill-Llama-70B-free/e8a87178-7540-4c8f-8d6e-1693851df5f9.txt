Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the sum of squares from 21 squared up to 40 squared. The formula given is for the sum of squares from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. Hmm, right, I remember that formula. So I think the approach here is to calculate the sum up to 40 and subtract the sum up to 20, since the sum from 21 to 40 would be the total up to 40 minus the total up to 20.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, the sum up to 40 is 40(41)(81)/6, because 2*40 is 80, plus 1 is 81. And the sum up to 20 would be 20(21)(41)/6, because 2*20 is 40 plus 1 is 41. So the idea is to compute each sum and then subtract.

Let me write this down step by step. So:

Sum from 1 to 40: S40 = 40 * 41 * 81 / 6.

Sum from 1 to 20: S20 = 20 * 21 * 41 / 6.

Then the desired sum S is S40 - S20.

Wait, let me compute S40 first. Let me calculate 40*41*81 divided by 6.

Breaking it down: 40/6 is, um, 40 divided by 6 is approximately 6.666, but maybe I should factor it better. Let's see, 40 can be written as 4*10, and 6 is 2*3. Maybe 40 and 6 share a common factor. 40 divided by 2 is 20, and 6 divided by 2 is 3. So 40/6 = 20/3. So S40 = (20/3) *41 *81.

Wait, maybe I should do the multiplication first before dividing. Let's compute 40 *41 first. 40*40 is 1600, plus 40 is 1640. So 40*41=1640. Then multiply by 81. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see: 1640 * 80 is 131200, and 1640 *1 is 1640, so total would be 131200 +1640 = 132840. Then divide by 6. 132840 /6: 6 goes into 132840.

Let me compute that. 6 * 20000 is 120000, subtract that from 132840 gives 12840. Now 6*2000 is 12000, so subtract that from 12840, leaves 840. 6 * 140 is 840. So total is 20000 + 2000 + 140 = 22140. So S40 is 22140.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 40*41 is 1640. 1640 *81: Let me double-check that. 1640 times 80 is 131200, and 1640 times 1 is 1640. So 131200 + 1640 = 132840. Divided by 6: 132840 ÷6. 6 * 22140 = 132840, right? So yes, 22140.

Now S20 is 20 *21 *41 /6.

Compute 20*21 first. 20*20 is 400, plus 20 is 420. So 420. Then 420 *41. Let's compute that. 400*41 is 16400, and 20*41 is 820. So 16400 +820=17220. Now divide by 6. 17220 ÷6. 6*2870 is 17220. So S20 is 2870.

Wait, wait. Because 20 *21 is 420, 420 *41 is 17220, and 17220 /6 is 2870. So S40 is 22140 and S20 is 2870.

So the sum from 21^2 to 40^2 is S40 - S20 = 22140 - 2870.

22140 minus 2870. Let's compute that. 22140 -2000 is 20140, then subtract 870 more: 20140 -870 = 19270.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 19270. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes. Let me recalculate S40 and S20.

S40: (40)(41)(81) /6.

Compute 40/6 first as 20/3. Then 20/3 *41 = (20*41)/3 = 820/3 ≈ 273.333. Then multiply by 81: 273.333 *81. Hmm, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, factor it better.

Wait, 40 *41 is 1640. 1640 *81 = 132840. 132840 /6: 132840 divided by 6 equals 22140. That's correct.

S20: (20)(21)(41)/6. 20/6 is (10/3). 10/3 *21 = 70. Then 70 *41=2870. Correct.

So 22140 -2870 = 19270. So the answer is J.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 19270. So that's the correct choice.

To find the value of \(21^2 + 22^2 + \cdots + 40^2\), we use the formula for the sum of squares:  
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
\]

First, calculate the sum of squares up to \(n = 40\):  
\[
S_{40} = \frac{40 \cdot 41 \cdot 81}{6}.
\]  
Breaking this down:  
\[
40 \cdot 41 = 1640, \quad 1640 \cdot 81 = 132840, \quad \frac{132840}{6} = 22140.
\]  
So, \(S_{40} = 22140\).

Next, calculate the sum of squares up to \(n = 20\):  
\[
S_{20} = \frac{20 \cdot 21 \cdot 41}{6}.
\]  
Breaking this down:  
\[
20 \cdot 21 = 420, \quad 420 \cdot 41 = 17220, \quad \frac{17220}{6} = 2870.
\]  
So, \(S_{20} = 2870\).

The desired sum is \(S_{40} - S_{20}\):  
\[
22140 - 2870 = 19270.
\]

Thus, the value of \(21^2 + 22^2 + \cdots + 40^2\) is **19270**, which corresponds to option **J**.
