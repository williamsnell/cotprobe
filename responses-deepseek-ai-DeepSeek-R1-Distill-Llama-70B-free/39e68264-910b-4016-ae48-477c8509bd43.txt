Okay, so I have this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about a mating between two individuals with the genotype AaBbCc. I'm supposed to find out the frequency of offspring that have the genotype AABBCC. The options are given from A to J, each a fraction with different denominators.

Hmm, I remember that when two parents mate, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Since each gene is independent, I can consider each gene separately and then multiply the probabilities.

Each parent is AaBbCc. So for each gene (A, B, C), the parent can produce gametes with either the dominant or recessive allele. Let's break it down gene by gene.

Starting with the A gene: each parent is Aa. So the possible gametes for the A gene are A and a, each with a probability of 50% or 1/2. For a child to have AA genotype, they must get an A from each parent. So the probability for the A part being AA is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Because each parent produces a gamete, and the child gets one from each. So for each gene, the chance that both gametes contribute the dominant allele (A) is (1/2) chance from each parent. So the probability that both parents give an A is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 for the AA genotype.

Wait, but wait again. No, wait, each parent can produce an A or a gamete. So the child's genotype for A would be A from dad and A from mom, which is AA. So the probability is 25% for AA.

Same logic applies to the B and C genes. So for each gene, the chance of the child being homozygous dominant (like AA for A gene, BB for B, CC for C) is (1/2 * 1/2) = 1/4 for each gene.

Wait, but wait a second. Because each parent is AaBbCc, right. So for each gene, the gamete has a 50% chance to give the dominant and 50% recessive.

So the probability that a child gets AABBCC is the product of the probabilities for each gene being homozygous dominant.

So for each gene: probability is (1/2 chance from each parent to give the dominant allele). So for each gene, the chance is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Since there are three genes, the total probability is (1/4)^3.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Each gene is independent, so the events are multiplied. So for A, B, C, each has a 1/4 chance. So 1/4 * 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/64?

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, because each parent produces a gamete with A, B, C alleles, but the combination has to be AABBCC. So for each gene, the probability that the child gets two dominant alleles is 1/4, as each parent gives one.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm confusing the total possibilities. Let me think of it another way. Each parent can produce 2^3 = 8 types of gametes, but since all are heterozygous, each gamete has a 50% chance for each allele.

Wait, no, each gene is independent, so the gamete types are combinations of A/a, B/b, C/c.

The total number of possible gametes for each parent is 2*2*2=8. But for the child to have AABBCC, they must receive A from each parent for the A gene, B from each for the B gene, and C from each for the C gene.

So the probability that a parent gives an A gamete is 1/2. Same for B and C. Since the gametes are independent, the chance of a parent producing a gamete with A, B, C is (1/2)^3 = 1/8. But wait, no, that's the chance of a particular combination (like ABC), but each gene is separate.

Wait, but for each gene, the probability that the gamete has the dominant allele is 1/2. So for each gene, the chance that the child gets the dominant from both parents is 1/2 (from dad) * 1/2 (from mom) = 1/4. And since each gene is independent, the combined probability is (1/4)^3 = 1/64.

So the chance would be 1/64. Looking at the options, option F is 1/64.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Oh wait, no, the parents are both AaBbCc. So each parent can produce gametes with A or a for the first gene, B or b for the second, and C or c for the third.

So the possible gametes for each parent are all combinations: ABc, ABc, AbC, etc. Wait, no, each gamete will have one allele for each gene. So for each gene, the gamete has a 50% chance of giving the dominant allele.

So for each gene, the probability that the offspring has two dominants is 25% (1/4). Since the three genes are independent, the probability for all three is (1/4)^3 = 1/64.

So the correct answer should be 1/64, which is option F.

To determine the frequency of AABBCC individuals resulting from a mating between two AaBbCc individuals, we analyze each gene separately and then combine the probabilities, as the genes are independent.

1. **For the A gene**:  
   Each parent (Aa) can produce gametes with either A (50% chance) or a (50% chance). For the offspring to have the genotype AA, they must inherit A from both parents. The probability of this happening is:  
   \[
   P(AA) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

2. **For the B gene**:  
   Similarly, each parent (Bb) can produce gametes with either B (50% chance) or b (50% chance). For the offspring to have the genotype BB, they must inherit B from both parents. The probability of this is:  
   \[
   P(BB) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

3. **For the C gene**:  
   Each parent (Cc) can produce gametes with either C (50% chance) or c (50% chance). For the offspring to have the genotype CC, they must inherit C from both parents. The probability of this is:  
   \[
   P(CC) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

4. **Combining the probabilities**:  
   Since the genes are independent, the probability of all three events (AA, BB, and CC) occurring together is the product of their individual probabilities:  
   \[
   P(AABBCC) = P(AA) \times P(BB) \times P(CC) = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{64}.
   \]

Thus, the frequency of AABBCC individuals is \( \frac{1}{64} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
