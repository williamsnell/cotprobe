Question:

Congress has recently enacted a statute requiring all males between the ages of 18 and 30 to take a physical examination each year. The results of the exam are sent to a government data information center for the purpose of keeping information about men who may be drafted into the military. A 25-year-old law school graduate has herpes. He has recently sent resumes to many governmental agencies. Fearful that the information about his herpes condition will become available, he seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid the government from requiring him to take a physical examination. Which of the following is the best constitutional basis in support of the federal law?

Options:

A: The full faith and credit clause.
B: The dormant commerce clause.
C: The necessary and proper clause.
D: The equal protection clause.
E: The commerce clause.
F: The supremacy clause.
G: To raise and support an army and navy.
H: The privileges and immunities clause.
I: To provide for the general welfare.
J: The due process clause.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step. 

Alright, the question is about a federal law that requires all males aged 18-30 to take a yearly physical exam. The results go to a government data center to track potential draftees. A 25-year-old law grad with herpes is worried his condition will be disclosed and is suing to stop the government from making him take the exam. The question is asking for the best constitutional basis supporting this federal law.

Hmm, so I need to think about which constitutional clause gives Congress the authority to enact such a law. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Full faith and credit clause. That's about states recognizing each other's laws and court judgments. Doesn't seem relevant here because the issue is about federal authority, not state-to-state relations.

Option B: Dormant commerce clause. That's when states can't impede interstate commerce, but the question is about a federal law, so dormant commerce isn't the issue. Congress is acting, not a state.

Option C: Necessary and proper clause. This allows Congress to make laws necessary for carrying out their enumerated powers. Like, if they have the power to raise an army, they can pass laws necessary to that. So maybe this is relevant, but I'm not sure yet.

Option D: Equal protection clause. That's about treating people equally under the law, preventing discrimination. The law applies to all males in that age group, so unless there's a discrimination aspect, equal protection might not be the basis for the law's enactment.

Option E: Commerce clause. Congress can regulate interstate commerce. But requiring physical exams for potential military service doesn't directly relate to commerce. Unless the data collection affects interstate commerce somehow, but that seems a stretch.

Option F: Supremacy clause. That's about federal law overriding state law. The question is about the basis for the federal law itself, not conflicts with state laws.

Option G: To raise and support an army and navy. Oh, that's one of Congress's enumerated powers under Article I, Section 8. The law is about preparing for the draft, which is directly related to maintaining an army. This seems like a strong candidate.

Option H: Privileges and immunities clause. This prevents states from discriminating against citizens of other states. Again, not directly related to the federal law's authority.

Option I: To provide for the general welfare. Congress has the power to tax and spend for the general welfare. While some laws are justified under this, the question is about physical exams for military purposes, which seems more tied to national defense than general welfare.

Option J: Due process clause. That's about fairness in procedures, especially regarding life, liberty, or property. The issue here isn't about procedure but the government's authority to require exams.

So, putting it together, the law is about the military draft. Congress's power to raise an army is an enumerated power. So the necessary and proper clause (option C) could be used to support laws that carry out that power. But wait, option G is specifically the power to raise an army. So does the law fall under that specific power?

Yes, the statute is directly related to the military draft. Congress has the authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 12, which gives them the power to raise and support armies. So requiring physical exams to assess who can be drafted would fall under that power. Therefore, the best constitutional basis is option G.

Wait a second, but the necessary and proper clause (option C) is also a possibility. Because even if the power isn't explicitly stated, Congress can pass laws necessary to execute their enumerated powers. In this case, though, the power to raise an army is explicit, so option G would be the direct basis without needing the necessary and proper clause. So option G is better than C here.

So the answer should be G.

The question concerns the constitutional basis for a federal law requiring males aged 18-30 to undergo annual physical examinations for potential military drafting. To determine the best constitutional support, we analyze the options:

- **Option A (Full faith and credit clause):** Irrelevant, as it pertains to state-to-state legal recognition, not federal authority.
- **Option B (Dormant commerce clause):** Not applicable, as it involves state interference with interstate commerce, not federal action.
- **Option C (Necessary and proper clause):** While this clause allows Congress to pass laws necessary to execute its powers, the specific power to raise an army is explicitly enumerated, making this less direct.
- **Option D (Equal protection clause):** Unrelated, as the law applies equally to all males in the specified age group.
- **Option E (Commerce clause):** Not relevant, as the law does not regulate interstate commerce.
- **Option F (Supremacy clause):** Pertains to federal law overriding state law, not the basis for enacting the federal law itself.
- **Option G (To raise and support an army and navy):** Directly applicable, as the law is tied to preparing for the military draft, an enumerated power under Article I, Section 8.
- **Option H (Privileges and immunities clause):** Irrelevant, as it concerns state discrimination against out-of-state citizens.
- **Option I (To provide for the general welfare):** While Congress can act for general welfare, this law is more specifically tied to national defense.
- **Option J (Due process clause):** Concerns procedural fairness, not the authority to enact the law.

The law's purpose is to assess fitness for military service, which falls under Congress's explicit power to "raise and support an army and navy" (Article I, Section 8). This makes **Option G** the best constitutional basis.

Answer: G
