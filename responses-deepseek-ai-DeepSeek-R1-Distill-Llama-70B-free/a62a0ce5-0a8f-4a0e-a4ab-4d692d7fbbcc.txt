Question:

Nitrogen's electronegativity value is between those of phosphorus and oxygen. Which of the following correctly describes the relationship between the three values?

Options:

A: The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has a smaller atomic mass, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a larger atomic number.
B: The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is smaller, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a smaller effective nuclear charge.
C: The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has a greater atomic number, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen has fewer valence electrons.
D: The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is larger, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a greater effective nuclear charge.
E: The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has less electrons, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen is smaller.
F: The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has a smaller atomic radius, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a greater atomic number.
G: The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has more valence electrons, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen is larger.
H: The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has fewer protons but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has less valence electrons.
I: The value for nitrogen is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has fewer neutrons, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has more protons.
J: The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen has a smaller atomic mass, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen has fewer protons.

Okay, so I've got this question about electronegativity values of nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen. Hmm, I remember electronegativity has to do with how strongly an atom can attract electrons in a chemical bond. From what I learned, electronegativity generally increases across a period and decreases down a group in the periodic table.

Nitrogen is in period 2, group 15. Phosphorus is right below it in period 3, same group. So, going down a group, the atomic size increases because each period adds another electron shell. Since electronegativity decreases with larger atomic size, nitrogen should be more electronegative than phosphorus. That makes sense because nitrogen is higher in the group.

Now, oxygen is in period 2 as well, but it's in group 16, which is to the right of group 15. So oxygen is in the same period as nitrogen but to the right. Since electronegativity increases across a period, oxygen should be more electronegative than nitrogen. So putting it all together, the order should be oxygen > nitrogen > phosphorus.

The question says that nitrogen's electronegativity is between those of phosphorus and oxygen. So the correct order is that nitrogen is higher than phosphorus but lower than oxygen. Now I need to look at the options to find which one correctly describes this relationship.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Nitrogen is less than phosphorus because of smaller atomic mass, but greater than oxygen. Wait, that can't be right because in the same group, N is above P, so N's EN should be higher. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Nitrogen's value is greater than phosphorus because it's smaller. That's correct because N is smaller and higher in the group. Then it says less than oxygen because N has smaller effective nuclear charge. Hmm. Wait, effective nuclear charge (Zeff) is the net positive charge experienced by electrons. Oxygen has a higher Zeff than nitrogen because it's further right. So oxygen's higher Zeff leads to higher EN. So the second part makes sense. So B says N > P and N < O. Which fits our initial thought. So B could be a contender.

Option C: N is greater than P because higher atomic number. Well, N has atomic number 7, P is 15, so that's correct. Then N less than O because fewer valence electrons. Wait, N has 5 valence electrons, O has 6. Does having more valence electrons mean higher EN? Not necessarily. Electronegativity is more about Zeff. So I'm not sure if that reasoning is correct. But the first part is correct, but the second part reasoning might be off.

Option D: N less than P because larger. No, N is smaller. So D is wrong.

Option E: N greater than P because less electrons. Wait, electrons? P has more electrons, but N is smaller. So E's reasoning is a bit unclear. Also, E says N less than O because smaller. But O is actually smaller than N. Wait, no, O is in the same period, so O is smaller than N? Wait no, O is to the right, so it's smaller. Oh wait, no, actually, atomic radius increases as you go left across a period. So O is smaller than N? Wait no, O is to the right, so it's smaller. So N is larger than O. So, E's second part says N is smaller than O, which is incorrect because N is larger. So E is wrong.

Option F: N less than P because smaller radius. No, N is smaller than P, but EN of N is higher. So F is incorrect.

Option G: N greater than P because more valence electrons. Wait, N has 5, P has 5 as well? Wait, no. Nitrogen is in group 15, so 5 valence electrons. Phosphorus is also in group 15, so same. So same number of valence electrons. So G's reasoning is wrong. So G is incorrect.

Option H: N less than P because fewer protons? No, N has 7 protons, P has 15. So N has fewer protons, but H says N is less than P, which is incorrect because N's EN is higher than P. So H is wrong.

Option I: N less than P because fewer neutrons. That's probably true, but the reasoning is wrong because EN isn't about neutrons. So I is incorrect.

Option J: N greater than P because smaller atomic mass. Well, atomic mass isn't the main factor here; it's atomic size. So J's reasoning is a bit off, but the first part is correct. Then J says N less than O because fewer protons. Wait, O has 8 protons, N has 7, so that's correct. But the reasoning is based on protons, which is part of Zeff. So the second part's reasoning is correct. But I'm not sure if that's the best way to explain it.

Wait, let's go back to option B. It says N's value is greater than P because it's smaller, which is correct. Then N's value is less than O because of smaller effective nuclear charge. Wait, does O have a higher Zeff than N? Yes, because O is to the right, so same period, higher atomic number. So O has higher Zeff, which leads to higher EN. So B's reasoning is correct on both points.

So the correct option is B.

To determine the relationship between the electronegativity values of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and oxygen (O), we analyze their positions in the periodic table and the factors influencing electronegativity. Electronegativity generally increases across a period and decreases down a group due to changes in atomic size and effective nuclear charge (Zeff).

1. **Nitrogen vs. Phosphorus**: Both are in group 15, but nitrogen is in period 2, while phosphorus is in period 3. As we move down a group, atomic size increases, and electronegativity decreases. Therefore, nitrogen is smaller and has a higher electronegativity than phosphorus.

2. **Nitrogen vs. Oxygen**: Both are in period 2, but oxygen is in group 16, to the right of nitrogen. As we move across a period, atomic size decreases, and Zeff increases, leading to higher electronegativity. Thus, oxygen has a higher electronegativity than nitrogen.

This gives the order: **oxygen > nitrogen > phosphorus**.

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. It states nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus, which contradicts the trend.
- **B**: Correct. It explains that nitrogen is more electronegative than phosphorus because it is smaller and less electronegative than oxygen due to smaller Zeff, which aligns with the trends.
- **C**: Incorrect. While the first part is correct, the second part attributes the difference between nitrogen and oxygen to valence electrons, which is not the primary factor.
- **D**: Incorrect. It claims nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus, which is false.
- **E**: Incorrect. It incorrectly states that nitrogen is smaller than oxygen.
- **F**: Incorrect. It claims nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus, which is false.
- **G**: Incorrect. It attributes the difference between nitrogen and phosphorus to valence electrons, which is not valid since both have the same number of valence electrons.
- **H**: Incorrect. It claims nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus, which is false.
- **I**: Incorrect. It attributes the difference to neutrons, which is irrelevant to electronegativity.
- **J**: Incorrect. While the first part is correct, the reasoning about atomic mass is not the primary factor.

The correct answer is **B**, as it accurately describes the relationship and reasoning.
