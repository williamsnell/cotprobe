Okay, so I have this problem about Mrs. Kaplan buying a coffee table on an installment plan, and I need to find the annual interest rate she paid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the coffee table costs $200. She paid $35 down and then has 9 monthly payments of $20 each. So first, I think I need to figure out how much she's paying in total, and then see how much of that is interest.

Wait, no, actually, I remember that when things are bought on installments, the total amount paid is the sum of the down payment and all the monthly payments. So the total she's paying is $35 plus 9 times $20. Let me calculate that.

9 times 20 is 180, right? So 35 + 180 is 215. So she's paying a total of $215 for a $200 table. That means the interest she's paying is 215 minus 200, which is $15. So she's paying $15 in interest over the period.

Now, to find the interest rate, I think I need to use the concept of simple interest or maybe something else like the present value of an annuity because she's making monthly payments. Oh wait, this is an installment plan, so I should probably model it as a loan where she's paying equal monthly installments, which include both principal and interest.

I remember there's something called the time value of money here, and the formula for calculating the present value of an annuity. The present value (PV) formula for an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ], where PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, the present value PV should be equal to the amount she's financing. She paid $35 down on a $200 table, so she's borrowing 200 - 35 = $165. So PV is $165.

Her monthly payments are $20 each, and she's making 9 payments. So PMT is 20, n is 9. We need to find r, the monthly interest rate, and then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.

So plugging into the formula: 165 = 20 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-9 ) / r ]

Hmm, I need to solve for r here. But I don't remember the exact formula off the top of my head, and solving for r algebraically is tricky because it's in the exponent and also outside. I think this might require trial and error or using a financial calculator.

Wait, but maybe I can approximate it. Let's see. Let me rearrange the equation to solve for the term inside.

Divide both sides by 20: 165/20 = 8.25 = [ (1 - (1 + r)^-9 ) / r ]

So 8.25 = (1 - (1 + r)^-9 ) / r

I can try plugging in different monthly rates and see which one gets me close to 8.25 on the right side.

Let me start with a guess. Let's say r is 1.5% per month. Let's compute the right side.

(1 - (1.015)^-9 ) / 0.015

First, calculate 1.015^-9. Let's see, 1.015^9 is about... Let me compute step by step.

1.015^1 = 1.015
^2 ≈ 1.030225
^3 ≈ 1.04571
^4 ≈ 1.06136
^5 ≈ 1.07708
^6 ≈ 1.09308
^7 ≈ 1.10927
^8 ≈ 1.12551
^9 ≈ 1.14168

So 1.015^-9 is about 1/1.14168 ≈ 0.8763

So 1 - 0.8763 = 0.1237. Then divide by 0.015: 0.1237 / 0.015 ≈ 8.247. Oh wait, that's really close to 8.25. So r is about 1.5% per month.

So the monthly rate is about 1.5%. Therefore, the annual rate is 12 times that, so 1.5 * 12 = 18%. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see 18%. The options are A:15%, B:21.8%, C:17.5%, D:19.2%, E:30%, F:25%, G:24%, H:27.3%, I:22.5%, J:20%.

Hmm, 18% isn't an option. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I should check my calculation again. Let me try r = 1.5% again.

Calculate denominator first: (1 - (1 + 0.015)^-9 ) / 0.015.

We have (1 - 1/(1.015)^9) / 0.015.

1.015^9: Let me compute more accurately.

Let me compute (1.015)^9.

1.015^1 = 1.015

2: 1.015 * 1.015 = 1.030225

3: 1.030225 *1.015 ≈ Let's compute 1.030225 * 1.015.

1.030225 * 1 = 1.030225

1.030225 * 0.015 = approx 0.015451. So total ≈ 1.045676.

4: 1.045676 *1.015.

1.045676 * 1 = 1.045676.

1.045676 *0.015 ≈ 0.0156836. So total ≈ 1.06136.

5: 1.06136 *1.015.

1.06136 *1 = 1.06136.

1.06136 *0.015 ≈ 0.015922. Total ≈ 1.07728.

6: 1.07728 *1.015.

1.07728 *1 = 1.07728.

1.07728 *0.015 ≈ 0.016159. So total ≈ 1.09344.

7: 1.09344 *1.015.

1.09344 *1 = 1.09344.

1.09344 *0.015 ≈ 0.0164016. Total ≈ 1.10984.

8: 1.10984 *1.015.

1.10984 *1 = 1.10984.

1.10984 *0.015 ≈ 0.0166476. Total ≈ 1.12649.

9: 1.12649 *1.015.

1.12649 *1 = 1.12649.

1.12649 *0.015 ≈ 0.016897. So total ≈ 1.14339.

So 1.015^9 ≈ 1.14339, so 1/(1.14339) ≈ 0.8745.

So 1 - 0.8745 = 0.1255. Divide by 0.015: 0.1255 / 0.015 = 8.3667.

Wait, earlier I thought that with r=1.5%, the value was 8.247, but now I got 8.3667. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, because I think earlier I approximated 1.015^9 as 1.14168, but the more accurate calculation gives 1.14339, so 1/1.14339 is about 0.8745. So 1-0.8745=0.1255, divided by 0.015 is approximately 8.3667.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1.5% gives 8.247, but now it's 8.3667. So my initial calculation was wrong. So maybe I need to adjust. Because the correct value with r=1.5% is 8.3667, which is higher than 8.25.

But our target is 8.25, so maybe the actual r is a bit less than 1.5%. Because when r increases, the denominator increases, so the overall value decreases.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The equation is 8.25 = (1 - (1 + r)^-9)/r.

When r increases, (1 + r)^-9 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-9 increases. But r is in the denominator, so overall, as r increases, the right-hand side decreases. So when I tried r=1.5%, I got about 8.3667, which is higher than 8.25. So to get a lower value, I need a higher r. Because higher r will make the right-hand side smaller.

So maybe try r=1.6%.

Let's compute (1 - (1.016)^-9 ) / 0.016.

First, compute 1.016^9.

But wait, this might take a while. Alternatively, maybe use a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula and set up an equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the rule of 78 or something else, but that's probably not necessary here.

Wait, another approach: the interest per period can be found by looking at the first payment. Let me think about the amortization schedule.

But that's complicated for 9 periods. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation formula for the interest rate.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake earlier in calculating the total amount paid. Let me recheck that.

She paid $35 down on a $200 table, so the amount financed is $165. Then she makes 9 payments of $20 each, totaling $180. So the total paid is $35 + $180 = $215. The cost is $200, so the interest is $15. So total interest is $15 over 9 months.

Wait, but that's just the simple interest, but the actual interest rate might be higher because she's paying off the principal over time, so the effective interest is more than 15/(200) * 100.

Wait, but that approach might be incorrect because it's not considering the time value of money. So the $15 in interest is spread over the 9 months, but the present value of that $15 is less.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the APR using the actuarial method.

Wait, the formula for the annual percentage rate (APR) when payments are made monthly is:

APR = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n + 1))

Where n is the number of payments, I is the total interest, and P is the principal.

Wait, let me confirm that formula. I think the formula for APR when you have equal monthly payments is:

APR = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n + 1))

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the formula might be:

APR = (2 * n * r) / (n + 1)

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the simple interest formula, but considering the average amount owed.

But given that the problem is about an installment plan, the correct approach is to find the interest rate that equates the present value of the payments to the amount financed.

So back to the original equation: 165 = 20 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-9 ) / r ]

We can rearrange this equation to solve for r numerically.

Alternatively, since this is multiple-choice, perhaps I can plug in the options and see which one gives the correct present value.

Let's take each option, convert it to a monthly rate, and compute the present value to see which one gives approximately $165.

The options given are annual rates, so I'll divide by 12 to get the monthly rate.

Option J: 20% annual rate. Monthly rate is 20/12 ≈1.6667%.

Let's compute the present value factor: [ (1 - (1 + 0.016667)^-9 ) / 0.016667 ]

First, compute (1 + 0.016667)^9 = (1.016667)^9.

Let me compute this step by step.

1.016667^1 = 1.016667

^2 = 1.016667 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.033789

^3 ≈ 1.033789 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.051328

^4 ≈ 1.051328 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.068920

^5 ≈ 1.068920 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.086800

^6 ≈ 1.086800 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.104845

^7 ≈ 1.104845 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.122999

^8 ≈ 1.122999 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.141692

^9 ≈ 1.141692 * 1.016667 ≈ 1.160334.

So (1.016667)^9 ≈ 1.160334. Therefore, 1/(1.160334) ≈ 0.8615.

So 1 - 0.8615 = 0.1385.

Then, 0.1385 / 0.016667 ≈ 8.31.

So the present value factor is approximately 8.31. Multiply by the monthly payment of 20: 20 * 8.31 ≈ 166.2.

Hmm, that's close to the $165 we're looking for. So with a monthly rate of ~1.6667% (20% annual), the present value is about $166.20, which is very close to $165.

So that suggests that the annual rate is approximately 20%, which is option J.

Wait, but earlier when I tried 1.5% monthly, I got a present value factor of around 8.3667, which would give a present value of 20 * 8.3667 ≈ 167.33, which is higher than 165, meaning the rate is slightly higher than 1.5% per month.

Wait, but when I used 1.6%, let's see what happens.

r = 1.6% per month.

Compute (1.016)^9.

1.016^1=1.016

^2=1.016*1.016≈1.032256

^3≈1.032256*1.016≈1.048592

^4≈1.048592*1.016≈1.065079

^5≈1.065079*1.016≈1.081802

^6≈1.081802*1.016≈1.098938

^7≈1.098938*1.016≈1.116502

^8≈1.116502*1.016≈1.134565

^9≈1.134565*1.016≈1.153095.

So 1.016^9≈1.153095. So 1/1.153095≈0.8673.

1 - 0.8673=0.1327.

0.1327 / 0.016 = 8.29375.

So present value factor is ~8.29375. Multiply by 20: 20 *8.29375≈165.875, which is very close to 165.

So at 1.6% monthly rate, the present value is approximately $165.875, which is very close to $165.

So the monthly rate is approximately 1.6%, so the annual rate is 1.6 * 12 = 19.2%.

Wait, 1.6 *12 is 19.2%, which is option D.

But earlier, when I tried option J (20% annual, 1.6667% monthly), the present value was about 166.20, which is a bit higher than 165.

So perhaps 1.6% is more accurate, leading to 19.2% annual rate, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier when I tried r=1.6%, the present value was ~165.875, which is very close to 165.

So that would make the annual rate 19.2%, which is option D.

But let me check option D: 19.2% annual rate.

So monthly rate is 19.2 /12 =1.6%.

Which gives us the present value factor of ~8.29375, leading to 20 *8.29375≈165.875, which is very close to 165.

So the correct answer should be D:19.2%.

Wait, but earlier when I tried with r=1.5%, I got a present value of about 167, which is higher than 165. So the rate must be higher than 1.5% to bring the present value down to 165.

So the correct answer is D:19.2%.

Wait, but let me check another option just to be thorough. Let's try option J:20% annual rate, which is 1.6667% monthly.

As I calculated before, that gives a present value of about 166.20, which is higher than 165, so the interest rate must be higher to make the present value lower.

Wait, no, wait. If the present value is higher than 165 when the rate is lower (1.6667% gives 166.2), that suggests that a higher rate would bring the present value down.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. If the discount rate (r) increases, the present value decreases. So when r increases, the denominator becomes larger, so each payment is worth less in present terms.

So when I tried r=1.6667%, the present value was 166.20, which is higher than 165. So to get a PV of 165, I need a slightly higher r than 1.6667%, because higher r would reduce the PV.

Wait, but earlier when I tried r=1.6%, the PV was 165.875, which is very close to 165. So perhaps the exact rate is approximately 1.6% per month.

Thus, the annual rate is 1.6% *12=19.2%, which is option D.
</think>

To determine the annual interest rate Mrs. Kaplan paid, we analyze the installment plan. The coffee table costs $200, with a $35 down payment and 9 monthly payments of $20 each. The total amount financed is $200 - $35 = $165. The total payments are $35 + (9 × $20) = $215, so the total interest paid is $215
