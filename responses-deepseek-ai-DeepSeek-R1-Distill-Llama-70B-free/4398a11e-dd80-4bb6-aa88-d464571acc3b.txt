Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. Concerns over the harmful effects of chlorofluorocarbons on stratospheric ozone have motivated a search for new refrigerants. One such alternative is 2,2-dichloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (refrigerant 123). Younglove and McLinden published a compendium of thermophysical properties of this substance (J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 23, 7 (1994)), from which properties such as the Joule-Thomson coefficient $\mu$ can be computed. Compute $\mu$ at 1.00 bar and $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ given that $(\partial H / \partial p)_T=-3.29 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ and $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}=110.0 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.

Options:

A: 26.7$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
B: 34.7$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
C:  29.9$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
D: 31.5$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
E: 32.2$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
F: 24.3$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
G: 35.0$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
H: 28.6$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
I: 27.5$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$
J: 33.1$\mathrm{K} \mathrm{MPa}^{-1}$

Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the Joule-Thomson coefficient, μ, for a refrigerant. Hmm, I remember that the Joule-Thomson coefficient is related to how the temperature of a gas changes when it undergoes expansion at constant enthalpy. The formula, I think, is μ = (∂T/∂p)_H. But wait, how do I compute that from the given data?

The problem gives me two pieces of information: the partial derivative of enthalpy with pressure at constant temperature, (∂H/∂p)_T, and the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, C_p,m. Oh right, I think there's a thermodynamic identity that connects these to find μ.

Let me think. The Joule-Thomson coefficient is defined as μ = (∂T/∂p)_H. There's an equation that relates this to other thermodynamic quantities. Oh yeah, I remember it's μ = - (1/C_p) * (∂H/∂p)_T. Wait, but wait, let me get the signs right. Because I think (∂H/∂p)_T is involved.

Wait, let me write down the exact formula. From thermodynamics, the Joule-Thomson coefficient can be expressed as μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = - ( (∂H/∂p)_T ) / C_p.

Wait no, is it divided by C_p or multiplied? Let me recall. The derivation comes from combining the differential of enthalpy and the total derivative for temperature.

The enthalpy H is a function of T and p. So dH = (∂H/∂T)_p dT + (∂H/∂p)_T dp. But since H is a state function, any path between two points gives the same change. For a process at constant enthalpy, dH = 0.

But wait, in the Joule-Thomson expansion, the process is isenthalpic (H is constant), and it's an expansion, so pressure decreases. So along this process, the change in temperature is related to the pressure change.

Alternatively, the formula I think I remember is μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = [ (∂H/∂p)_T ] / [ C_p ] multiplied by some factor. Wait, maybe I'm getting the sign wrong. Let me think carefully.

The exact expression is:

μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = - [ (∂H/∂p)_T ] / C_p.

Wait, no, actually, another approach. Starting from the total differential of T with respect to p at constant H.

Using cyclic relations, perhaps. Let me think of the thermodynamic identity.

Wait, another approach: The derivative (∂T/∂p)_H can be found using the thermodynamic equations.

We know that dH = T dS + V dp. But that's the differential of H as a function of S and p, which might not directly help. Alternatively, considering H as a function of T and p.

Wait, I think the correct formula is μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = - ( (∂H/∂p)_T ) / C_p.

Wait, let me double-check. The Joule-Thomson coefficient is given by:

μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = [ (∂H/∂p)_T - H ] / C_p * (something?)

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't right now, but I'll try to derive it.

We have the enthalpy H(T,p). The differential is dH = (∂H/∂T)_p dT + (∂H/∂p)_T dp.

At constant H, dH=0, so:

0 = (∂H/∂T)_p dT + (∂H/∂p)_T dp.

So, solving for dT/dp at constant H:

dT/dp = - (∂H/∂p)_T / (∂H/∂T)_p.

But (∂H/∂T)_p is the heat capacity at constant pressure, C_p.

So, μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = - (∂H/∂p)_T / C_p.

Wait, that makes sense. So the formula is μ = - ( (∂H/∂p)_T ) / C_p.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure about the sign. Because, in the equation, dT/dp is equal to - (∂H/∂p)_T / (∂H/∂T)_p.

But (∂H/∂T)_p is C_p, which is positive. So the sign comes in as negative.

So in this problem, (∂H/∂p)_T is given as -3.29e3 J·MPa⁻¹·mol⁻¹. Oh wait, that's a negative value. Let me plug it into the formula.

So, μ = [ - ( (∂H/∂p)_T ) ] / C_p.

Wait, no, because the formula is μ = - [ (∂H/∂p)_T / C_p ]

Wait, no, let me re-express.

Wait, in the equation, dT/dp = - (∂H/∂p)_T / (∂H/∂T)_p.

So (∂T/∂p)_H = - (∂H/∂p)_T / (C_p).

So, substituting the given values: (∂H/∂p)_T is -3.29e3 J/(MPa·mol), and C_p is 110 J/(K·mol).

So let's compute:

μ = [ - ( (-3.29e3) ) ] / (110 )

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, (∂H/∂p)_T is given as -3.29e3 J MPa⁻¹ mol⁻¹.

So, plugging into the equation:

μ = [ - ( (-3.29e3) ) ] / (110 )

So the negatives cancel, giving 3.29e3 / 110.

Let me compute that.

3.29e3 is 3290.

3290 divided by 110.

Let me compute 3290 ÷ 110.

110 × 29 = 3190.

3290 - 3190 = 100.

So 29 + (100/110) → 29 + 0.909 ≈ 29.909.

Wait no, wait, 3290 ÷ 110.

Alternatively, 110 × 30 = 3300, which is 10 more than 3290. So 30 - (10/110) → 30 - 0.0909 ≈ 29.909.

So approximately 29.909 K·MPa⁻¹?

Wait, but wait, let me think about the units.

Wait, the given (∂H/∂p)_T is in J/(MPa·mol). Let's make sure the units work out.

Because C_p is in J/(K·mol), so when we do (J/(MPa·mol)) / (J/(K·mol)) ), the J and mol cancel.

So units would be (1/(MPa)) * K, which is K/MPa.

So the units for μ are K·MPa⁻¹.

Looking at the options, all are in K·MPa⁻¹.

So my calculation gives approximately 29.909 K MPa⁻¹.

Looking at the options, option C is 29.9, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation to be sure.

3.29e3 = 3290 J/(MPa·mol)

C_p =110 J/(K·mol)

So 3290 / 110 = ?

Let me compute 3290 ÷ 110.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 329 / 11.

11 × 29 = 319.

329 - 319 = 10. So 29 and 10/11, which is approximately 29.909.

Yes, so 29.909 rounds to 29.9, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, the options include option C as 29.9, but I see option D is 31.5, E is 32.2, etc.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the sign? Let me check the formula again.

The formula is μ = - (∂H/∂p)_T / C_p.

Wait, no—earlier, I thought it's μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = - (∂H/∂p)_T / C_p.

Wait, let me make sure. Because the formula I derived was:

μ = (∂T/∂p)_H = - (∂H/∂p)_T / C_p.

So substituting the value:

∂H/∂p is -3.29e3, so:

μ = - ( (-3.29e3) ) / 110 = 3.29e3 / 110 ≈ 29.909 K·MPa⁻¹.

So that seems right. So the correct answer should be option C, 29.9.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 26.7

B:34.7

C:29.9

D:31.5

E:32.2

F:24.3

G:35.0

H:28.6

I:27.5

J:33.1

So option C is 29.9, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but another thought: Wait, the given (∂H/∂p)_T is -3.29e3 J/(MPa·mol). So in my calculation, I used that as a negative number, which made the numerator positive.

Wait, to recap:

μ = [ - ( ∂H/∂p )_T ] / C_p

So when (∂H/∂p)_T is negative, it becomes positive.

So yes, that's correct.

Wait another thing: The units. The given C_p is 110 J/(K·mol), and (∂H/∂p)_T is J/(MPa·mol), so when I divide them, the J and mol terms cancel, leaving 1/(MPa·K), but wait, no: Wait, the formula is (∂H/∂p)_T (J/(MPa·mol)) divided by C_p (J/(K·mol)).

So (J/(MPa·mol)) / (J/(K·mol)) ) = K/(MPa), which is K·MPa⁻¹.

Which matches the units given in the options.

So everything checks out. The correct answer is option C, 29.9 K·MPa⁻¹.
