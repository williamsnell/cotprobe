Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me about the Palace at Knossos. The question is asking about the number of rooms it had at its peak, with options ranging from 100 to 5,000. Hmm, I remember that Knossos was a significant Minoan palace on the island of Crete. I think it's famous for being the center of the Minoan civilization and also for the legend of the Minotaur and the labyrinth. But wait, how many rooms did it actually have?

I'm trying to recall my history classes. I remember that Minoan palaces were large and complex, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact number. Let's see, I think the palace at Knossos was one of the biggest, maybe even the largest in the Minoan world. So the options are A:100, B:500, C:1,000, D:5,000. 

I seem to remember that when archaeologists excavated Knossos, they found a lot of rooms. I think the number was in the hundreds, but I'm not sure if it was as high as 1,000. Wait, maybe it was even more. I've heard the term "labyrinth" associated with Knossos, which implies a very complex and large structure with many rooms. So maybe the number is higher, like around 1,000 or more.

I'm trying to think of any specific facts I've come across. I recall reading somewhere that the palace had over 1,000 rooms. Oh, but I'm not 100% certain. Some sources might say it's around 1,300 or so. So if the question says "over" a certain number, maybe 1,000 is the correct option because it's the closest to that figure.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes these numbers can be a bit exaggerated or vary based on how you count the rooms. Maybe some sources include storage areas, corridors, and smaller chambers, which would increase the count. So if it's over 1,000, the correct answer would be option C: 1,000.

Alternatively, I might be confusing Knossos with other ancient palaces. For example, I think the Palace of Versailles has over 700 rooms, but that's much later and a different culture. Knossos is much older, from around 1500 BCE, so it's impressive if it had that many rooms.

Another angle: I remember that the Minoans built multi-story buildings, so the number of rooms could be higher than just the ground floor. So maybe each floor had several hundred rooms, adding up to over 1,000 in total.

I'm pretty confident now that the number is around 1,000 or more. So the correct answer must be option C: 1,000.

The Palace at Knossos, a center of the Minoan civilization on Crete, was known for its complexity and size. While the exact number of rooms is debated, historical and archaeological sources suggest it had over 1,000 rooms, making option C the most accurate choice.
