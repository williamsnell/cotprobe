Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about ferromagnetic materials and how magnetization relates to the applied field. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that ferromagnetism is different from paramagnetism or diamagnetism. Let's think.

In paramagnetic materials, the magnetization is proportional to the applied field, right? So that would be a linear relationship. But ferromagnetic materials are different because they exhibit hysteresis. Oh wait, so the relationship isn't linear there.

Wait, when you apply a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic material, the magnetization increases, but after a certain point, it doesn't increase much more even if the field is increased. That's because the domains are already aligned. So the graph of magnetization versus applied field would show an initial rapid increase, then flatten out. That doesn't look linear. 

Also, I remember something about the hysteresis loop. When you plot magnetization (M) against the applied field (H), you get a loop shape, which definitely isn't a straight line. So the relationship isn't linear. 

Looking at the options, option A is linear, which I think is for paramagnets. So the answer can't be A. What about the others? Well, options like quadratic, cubic, etc., don't really fit because the curve isn't following a simple mathematical function like that. It's more of a complex, nonlinear curve.

So the correct answer must be that magnetization and applied field in ferromagnetic materials are related nonlinearly. That would be option H.

The magnetisation and applied field in ferromagnetic materials are related **nonlinearly**. This is because ferromagnetic materials exhibit hysteresis, where the relationship between magnetisation (M) and the applied magnetic field (H) does not follow a straight line. Instead, the graph of M versus H shows a complex, nonlinear curve due to the alignment of magnetic domains, which eventually saturate as the field increases. This behavior is distinct from linear relationships observed in other types of magnetic materials. 

H: non linearly.
