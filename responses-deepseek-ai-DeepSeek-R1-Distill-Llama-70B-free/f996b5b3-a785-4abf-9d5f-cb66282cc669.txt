Okay, so I need to figure out which singer appeared in the 1992 baseball film 'A League of Their Own'. I'm a bit rusty on my 90s movies, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that 'A League of Their Own' is about women's baseball during World War II. The main stars I recall are Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, and Madonna. Wait, Madonna was in that movie, right? She played one of the baseball players. I think her character was a bit of a wildcard or something.

Looking at the options, option B is Madonna. So that's probably the correct answer. But let me make sure I'm not mixing up movies. Other options include Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, etc., but I don't think they were in that film. I know Whitney was in 'The Bodyguard' around that time, and Mariah was just starting out in the early 90s, maybe not acting yet.

So, putting it all together, Madonna was definitely in 'A League of Their Own', so the answer should be B.
