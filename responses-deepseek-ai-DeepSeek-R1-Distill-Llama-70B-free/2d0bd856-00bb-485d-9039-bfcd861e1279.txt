Question:

A woman owned a 10-acre tract of rural farmland in fee simple absolute. The woman agreed to sell the farmland to a man, and each signed a writing stating that the farmland was beitig sold: ". . . for $10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged. " In actuality, the man had not yet paid the woman the $10,000. At the date set for closing, the woman transferred a deed to the farmland to the man, who gave the woman a check for $10,000. Howevei, a few days after the woman deposited the check, she received notice from her bank that the check had not cleared, due to insufficient funds in the account. The woman then brought suit against the man. At trial, the woman seeks to testify that the man did not in fact pay her the $10,000 as recited in their written instrument. The man objects to the woman's proposed testimony. Will the trial court judge be correct in sustaining the man's objection?

Options:

A: Yes, because the woman accepted the check as payment and the risk of the check not clearing falls on her.
B: No, because the woman can demonstrate that the man has breached the contract.
C: No, because the man's act of issuing a check that did not clear is evidence of fraudulent intent.
D: Yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
E: No, because the parol evidence rule does not operate to exclude evidence to show lack or want of consideration.
F: Yes, because the parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of oral agreements that contradict written agreements.
G: Yes, because the woman's acknowledgment of receipt in the written instrument is conclusive proof of payment.
H: No, because the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing.
I: Yes, because the doctrine of promissory estoppel will prevent the woman from denying her own signed acknowledgment that she received the $10,000.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with the parol evidence rule and what evidence is admissible in court when there's a written agreement. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The situation is that a woman owns a 10-acre farmland and agreed to sell it to a man. They both signed a written agreement stating the sale is for $10,000, and there's an acknowledgment of receipt. But in reality, the man hadn't paid the $10,000 yet. At closing, the woman transferred the deed, and the man gave her a check for $10,000. Later, the check bounces because there were insufficient funds. Now, the woman is suing the man, and at trial, she wants to testify that he didn't pay her the $10,000 as stated in their written agreement. The man objects to this testimony, and the question is whether the judge should sustain that objection.

I remember that the parol evidence rule generally says that when a written agreement is intended to be the final and complete expression of the parties' agreement, prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict it are inadmissible. But in this case, the issue is about events that happened after the written agreement was made. 

Wait, the written agreement says "receipt of which is acknowledged." So the woman is acknowledging in writing that she received the $10,000. But she's trying to testify that she didn't, because the check didn't clear. So she's trying to contradict the written statement.

The first thought is about whether the parol evidence rule applies here. The parol evidence rule is about prior or contemporaneous agreements, but here the issue is about subsequent eventsâ€”specifically, whether the payment was actually made. The written instrument here includes an acknowledgment of receipt, which might be considered part of the integrated agreement.

But wait, the parol evidence rule doesn't usually apply to events after the contract was made. It's more about what was agreed upon before or at the time of the writing. So if the woman is testifying about what happened after the contract (i.e., the check didn't clear), that might not be barred by the parol evidence rule.

Alternatively, there's the concept of consideration. The written agreement states that the $10,000 was received, which would typically mean that the consideration was present. If the check didn't clear, maybe there was a failure of consideration. But if the acknowledgment is part of the written agreement, can she contradict it with parol evidence?

Another angle is the concept of payment. If a check is given as payment, it's conditional until it clears. So if the check bounces, the payment wasn't actually made. But in the written agreement, they acknowledged receipt, which might be seen as the woman accepting the check as payment, but the question is whether she can later contradict that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because she accepted the check and the risk is on her. I'm not sure if that's a rule of law, though. The risk of a check not clearing might depend on other factors, like if it's a cashier's check or not. But I think that's more about the Uniform Commercial Code, not the parol evidence rule.

Option B says no, because she can show breach of contract. But the issue is whether she can testify to contradict the written agreement, not whether there's a breach.

Option C suggests the check not clearing shows fraud. That might be a different issue, but not directly about the admissibility of her testimony.

Option D says yes because the written instrument is a complete integration. That would mean the parol evidence rule applies, making prior agreements inadmissible, but again, the events here are after the writing.

Option E says no because the parol evidence rule doesn't apply to lack of consideration. Wait, the parol evidence rule is about prior agreements, but if consideration was lacking, that's a different matter. However, in this case, the written agreement includes an acknowledgment of receipt, which might be seen as the consideration being present.

Option F says yes because parol evidence can't contradict written agreements. But that's only for prior or contemporaneous agreements, not subsequent events.

Option G says yes because the acknowledgment is conclusive. That would mean the woman can't contradict it, but I'm not sure if that's the case. An acknowledgment might be a statement, but if it's false, maybe she can refute it.

Option H says no because parol evidence applies to events after the writing. Wait, no, parol evidence is about prior or contemporaneous, so if the events are after, maybe the rule doesn't apply. So she can testify about the check not clearing.

Option I says yes because of promissory estoppel. But that's when a party has relied on a promise to their detriment. Not sure if that applies here.

So, putting it together: The parol evidence rule doesn't bar evidence about events after the agreement was made. The woman's testimony is about the check not clearing, which happened after the written agreement. Therefore, the parol evidence rule wouldn't exclude her testimony, so the objection should be overruled. Wait, but the written agreement says she acknowledged receipt, which is part of the contract. So is she trying to contradict that?

Wait, the acknowledgment is part of the written agreement. So if the written agreement includes a term that she received the money, can she later introduce evidence that she didn't? That would be contradicting the written terms. But in contract law, a written agreement that includes such a term is generally binding unless there's evidence of fraud, duress, etc.

Alternatively, the acknowledgment might be a recital, and whether it's binding depends on whether the contract is fully integrated. But if the contract includes that acknowledgment, and she accepted the check, perhaps she's bound by that. But if the check didn't clear, maybe the consideration failed, so the contract could be rescinded.

Wait, but the parol evidence rule is about excluding evidence of prior agreements. Here, the woman is trying to testify about a subsequent event (the check not clearing). So the parol evidence rule wouldn't apply because it's not about prior agreements but about subsequent events affecting the contract.

So the judge should allow her to testify because the parol evidence rule doesn't apply to events after the contract was made. Therefore, the correct answer would be H: No, because the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing.

Wait, but another thought: the written agreement includes an acknowledgment of receipt, which is a present statement. If she testifies that she didn't receive the funds, isn't that contradicting the written agreement? But the parol evidence rule doesn't prevent that because it's not prior or contemporaneous. It's about a subsequent event affecting the validity of the payment.

Alternatively, maybe the written agreement is a complete integration, but the issue isn't about varying the terms but about whether the condition in the contract was met. So she can introduce evidence that the condition (payment) wasn't fulfilled, which wouldn't be barred by the parol evidence rule.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The question revolves around whether the trial court judge should sustain the man's objection to the woman's testimony that she did not receive the $10,000, despite the written agreement stating otherwise. The key issue is the applicability of the parol evidence rule and whether the woman can testify about events occurring after the written agreement was formed.

The parol evidence rule generally bars the introduction of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict a written agreement. However, in this case, the woman's testimony concerns a subsequent eventâ€”the check not clearingâ€”which occurred after the written agreement was executed. The parol evidence rule does not apply to events that occur after the formation of the written agreement. Therefore, the woman should be allowed to testify about the check not clearing, as this does not involve contradicting the terms of the written agreement but rather provides evidence of a subsequent failure of payment.

Option H correctly states that the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing, making it the correct answer.

**Answer: H**
