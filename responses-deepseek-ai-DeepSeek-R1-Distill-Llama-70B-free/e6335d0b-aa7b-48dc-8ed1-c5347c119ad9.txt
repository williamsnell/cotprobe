Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a cylindrical lens. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is asking about the focal length of a cylindrical lens formed by bending a glass sheet into a cylinder. The given data includes a glass thickness of 2 cm, a refractive index of 1.5, and a radius of 5 meters. The choices are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, wait. I remember that cylindrical lenses are a bit different from spherical ones. Cylindrical lenses have their curvature in one direction only, right? So they're like a cylinder bent along one axis. I think they're used to focus light in one plane, which is why they're called cylindrical because of their shape.

But how do I calculate the focal length? Oh right, the focal length of a lens is given by the lensmaker's formula. But wait, the usual lensmaker's equation is for spherical lenses, right? So 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but in this case, the lens is cylindrical, so maybe the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should think about the curvature. For a cylindrical lens, the radius is in one direction only. So perhaps the formula simplifies. Let me think: a cylindrical lens can be considered as having one surface flat and the other curved. Or maybe both surfaces are curved but in only one direction.

Wait, another approach: the problem says it's formed by bending a sheet of glass into a cylinder. So the lens is probably a single curved surface, and the other side is flat? Because when you bend a flat sheet into a cylinder, one side becomes curved, and the other remains flat. So that would make it a plano-convex lens, but in cylindrical form.

Wait, but what's the formula for a cylindrical lens's focal length? I think the formula might be similar to the spherical case but only considering one dimension. So maybe the focal length f is given by f = R/(n-1), where R is the radius of curvature.

Wait, let me think again. In the case of a spherical lens, the focal length is based on the radii of both surfaces. But for a cylindrical lens, since it's only curved in one direction, the focal length would depend on the radius in that direction. So probably, the formula is f = R/(n-1), but wait, R would be the radius of curvature of the lens surface.

Wait, but wait, the radius of the cylinder is given as 5 meters. So is that the radius of curvature of the lens? I think so. Because when you bend the sheet into a cylinder, the radius of the cylinder would be the radius of curvature of the lens's surface.

So substituting the values, R is 5 meters. But wait, the units are in centimeters. Let me make sure about the units. The radius is 5 meters, which is 500 cm. Because 1 meter is 100 cm. So 5 meters is 500 cm.

Wait, the glass thickness is 2 cm. Hmm, but how does that factor in? Oh wait, perhaps the glass thickness is the same as the diameter of the lens. But wait, no, the glass sheet is 2 cm thick, so when bent into a cylinder, the thickness becomes the height of the cylinder, perhaps. Or maybe it's the diameter in the direction perpendicular to the cylinder's length.

Wait, maybe the thickness isn't needed for calculating the focal length in this case. Because the focal length is determined by the curvature and the refractive index, not the thickness. Oh right, because the lensmaker's formula for spherical lenses doesn't involve thickness either; it's R1 and R2, which are the radii of the two surfaces.

So, going back, if the formula is f = R/(n-1), then substituting the values:

n is 1.5, so (n-1) is 0.5.

R is 500 cm.

So f = 500 cm / 0.5 = 1000 cm. Wait, that's 10 meters. But looking at the options, none of the choices are 1000 cm. Wait, the options are: A is 3e5 cm, B is 1e6, C is 1e4, etc.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing the formula. Another thought: for a cylindrical lens, the focal length would be calculated differently. Let me think about the lensmaker's equation for a cylindrical lens.

Wait, maybe the focal length is given by f = (n-1) * R. No, that doesn't make sense because in that case, with R being 500 cm, f would be 0.5 * 500 = 250 cm, but that's not among the options either.

Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. For a plano-convex lens, which is spherical, the focal length is f = R/(n-1), where R is the radius of the curved surface. So if that's the case for a cylindrical lens, which is like a plano-convex in one direction, then the same formula would apply.

So for the cylindrical lens, f = R/(n-1) = 500 cm / 0.5 = 1000 cm. But wait, none of the options are 1000 cm. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 3e5 cm

B: 1e6 cm

C: 1e4 cm

D: 2.5e5 cm

E: 5e6 cm

F:5e5 cm

G:1.25e5 cm

H:7.5e5 cm

I:5e4 cm

J:2e6 cm.

Wait, 1000 cm isn't among them. So perhaps I'm doing something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the radius given isn't the radius of curvature but the diameter. Because the problem says the radius of the cylinder is 5 m. So the radius is 5 m, which is 500 cm. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the cylindrical lens. Maybe because the cylindrical lens is a single surface, but I'm not accounting for the other surface.

Wait, another thought: the lensmaker's formula for a single surface would be 1/f = (n-1)(1/R), but that's for a spherical surface. Wait, but for a cylindrical lens, the curvature is in one direction only. So perhaps the focal length is determined by R/(n-1), as I thought earlier.

Wait, but maybe the focal length is for the other direction, like the direction perpendicular to the cylinder. Wait, no, the cylindrical lens only focuses in one plane, so the focal length would be in the direction of curvature.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake with the units. Let me double-check. The radius is 5 meters, which is 500 cm. So R = 500 cm.

n is 1.5, so n-1 is 0.5.

So f = R/(n-1) = 500 / 0.5 = 1000 cm, which is 10 meters.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the focal length of a cylindrical lens is f = (2R)/(n-1). Let me see why. Because in a spherical lens, when both surfaces are present, each contributes. But in a cylindrical lens, since it's only one curved surface, maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (n-1) * R. Wait, that would give 0.5 *500 =250 cm, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes the thickness. Wait, the glass is 2 cm thick, so when bent into a cylinder of radius 5 m, perhaps the relationship involves the thickness and radius.

Wait, the circumference of the cylinder would be 2πR. But if the glass is a sheet, then when bent into a cylinder, the length of the cylinder would be equal to the thickness of the glass?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the glass sheet's thickness becomes the diameter of the cylinder. No, that can't be because the radius is given as 5 m, which is much larger than 2 cm.

Wait, maybe the glass sheet is rolled along its length, so the thickness becomes the radius. No, that's not possible because 2 cm is much smaller than 5 m.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the focal length of a cylindrical lens is f = R * (n - 1), which would be 500 cm * 0.5 = 250 cm. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the focal length is given by (n)/(R), but that would be 1.5 /500 = 0.003 cm, which is way too small.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should look up the formula for a cylindrical lens's focal length. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to think through.

Wait, another approach: in a cylindrical lens, the focal length is determined similarly to a spherical lens, but only in one direction. So if the lens is plano-convex, then the focal length would be f = (R)/(n-1).

But again, that gives 1000 cm, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, maybe the radius in the formula is twice the given radius. Because sometimes R is the radius of curvature, which for a convex lens is considered positive. Wait, but in the case of bending a flat sheet into a cylinder, the radius of curvature would be the same as the cylinder's radius. So R is 500 cm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the diameter instead of the radius. So if I use R as 5 meters, which is 500 cm, but if I mistakenly use the diameter (which would be 1000 cm), then f would be 1000 cm / 0.5 = 2000 cm. But that's still not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the focal length is calculated using the formula f = (n * R)/(n-1). So that would be (1.5 *500)/0.5 = (750)/0.5 = 1500 cm, which is 15 meters. Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using centimeters and meters incorrectly. Let me recheck the units.

The radius is 5 meters, which is 500 centimeters. Correct.

So, substituting into f = R/(n-1) gives 500 / 0.5 = 1000 cm.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is 10,000 cm, which is 100 meters.

Option I is 50,000 cm, which is 500 meters.

Option A is 3e5 cm, which is 3000 meters.

Hmm. None of these match 1000 cm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = (R*(n-1)). So 500 *0.5=250 cm. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think again about the lensmaker's formula for a cylindrical lens.

Alternatively, think about the lens as a section of a cylinder. So when light passes through, it's focused in one direction. The focal length would be determined by the radius of curvature and the refractive index.

Another approach: perhaps the focal length is given by f = (2R)/(n-1). So 2*500/(0.5) = 2000 cm. But that's 20 meters, which is still not among the options.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 125,000 cm (1250 meters), option D is 250,000 cm (2500 meters), option F is 500,000 cm (5000 meters). Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, the formula for a plano-convex lens in the spherical case is f = R/(n-1). So for a cylindrical lens, perhaps it's the same, f = R/(n-1).

So R is 500 cm, n-1 is 0.5, so 500 / 0.5 = 1000 cm. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem isn't considering it as a plano-convex lens, but as a biconvex or something else.

Wait, the problem says it's formed by bending a sheet into a cylinder. So perhaps the lens has two curved surfaces, each with radius R. But wait, how? Because when you bend a flat sheet into a cylinder, you end up with one curved surface and the other flat. Unless it's bent in both directions, but that would make it a sphere, not a cylinder.

Wait, but a cylindrical lens is only curved in one direction, so maybe each of the two surfaces is a cylinder with radius R. But that's not possible because a sheet bent into a cylinder would have one curved and one flat side.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Let's think about the formula for a cylindrical lens.

Wait, I'm starting to think that perhaps the focal length is given by f = R/(n-1), which gives 1000 cm, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the glass thickness is 2 cm. Maybe that's the diameter of the lens. Wait, when you bend a sheet into a cylinder, the thickness could relate to the circumference. Because the length of the sheet would become the circumference of the cylinder.

Wait, the circumference C = 2πR. If the sheet's length is equal to the circumference, then the length would be 2πR. But how does that relate to the thickness?

Wait, perhaps the sheet's thickness becomes the height (or length) of the cylinder. So the cylinder's length is 2 cm. But I'm not sure how that affects the focal length.

Wait, maybe the radius is 5 m, and the circumference is 2π*5 m = 10π meters ≈31.4 meters. But the glass sheet's thickness is 2 cm, which would imply that the length of the sheet is 2 cm, but that doesn't make sense because the circumference is much larger. So perhaps that approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the glass sheet's thickness is the same as the radius? No, that can't be because 2 cm is much smaller than 5 meters.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the problem again.

We have a cylindrical lens made by bending a glass sheet into a cylinder. The glass is 2 cm thick, n=1.5, radius R=5 m.

The focal length is f = R/(n-1) = 500 cm / 0.5 = 1000 cm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the formula is different. Another possibility is that the focal length is f = (n * R)/(n - 1). So 1.5 *500 / 0.5 = 1500 cm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps because it's a cylindrical lens, the formula uses the diameter instead of the radius. So if R is 5 m, then diameter is 10 m =1000 cm. Then f =1000 cm /0.5 = 2000 cm. Still not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option I is 50,000 cm, which is 500 meters. Option G is 125,000 cm (1250 meters). Option D is 250,000 cm (2500 m). Option F is 500,000 cm (5000 m). Option C is 10,000 cm (100 m). Option A is 300,000 cm (3000 m). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the focal length for a cylindrical lens is f = (2R(n-1)). Let's try that: 2 *500 *0.5 =500 cm. Still not an option.

Alternatively, maybe f = (R*(n-1)) =500 *0.5 =250 cm. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the radius in meters instead of centimeters. Let me try that. R is 5 meters.

So f =5 m /0.5 =10 m, which is 1000 cm. Again, same result.

Wait, maybe the problem considers the lens as a diverging lens in one direction, so the focal length would be negative. But sign doesn't affect the magnitude, which is still 1000 cm.

Hmm. I'm not finding a match with the given options. Maybe I'm using the wrong formula altogether.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the lens is considered as a section of a cylinder, and the focal length is calculated based on the radius and the refractive index, but perhaps the formula is different. Let me think about how a cylindrical lens works.

A cylindrical lens has a focal line, not a focal point. The focal length is the distance from the lens to this focal line. For a plano-convex cylindrical lens, the focal length would be f = R/(n-1), similar to the spherical case.

So if R is 5 meters (500 cm), n is 1.5, then f =500 cm /0.5=1000 cm.

Wait, but the options don't have 1000 cm. So perhaps the problem is considering the lens as a double convex, meaning both surfaces are curved. But that would require a different formula.

Wait, for a biconvex lens, the lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). If both R1 and R2 are equal to R, then 1/f = (n-1)(2/R - 2/R) )=0, which can't be right. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe both surfaces are plano, but that would not make a lens.

Wait, perhaps the lens is formed by bending the glass sheet into a cylinder, so that the radius is 5 m, but the other surface is flat. So it's a plano-convex cylindrical lens. So the formula f = R/(n-1) applies.

Hmm, but then f is 1000 cm. None of the options match. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the focal length is calculated in meters instead of centimeters. Let me think: 1000 cm is 10 meters. But none of the options are 10 meters. The options are in centimeters, so 10,000 cm is 100 meters, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me check.

5 meters is 500 cm, correct. So R is 500 cm.

f = R/(n-1) =500 /0.5 =1000 cm.

But none of the options have 1000
