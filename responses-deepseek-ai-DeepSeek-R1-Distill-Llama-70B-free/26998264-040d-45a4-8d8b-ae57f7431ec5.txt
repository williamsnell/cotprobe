Okay, so I have this problem about the freezing point of blood and calculating osmotic pressure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, first part is about the effective molal concentration of the solute in the serum. I remember that the freezing point depression is related to the molality of the solution. The formula is ΔTf = Kf * m, right? Where ΔTf is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant for the solvent, and m is the molality.

Wait, for water, what's the Kf value? I think it's about 1.86°C·kg/mol. So the freezing point of pure water is 0°C, and the sample here is -0.560°C. So ΔTf is 0 - (-0.560) = 0.560°C.

So plugging into the formula: 0.560 = 1.86 * m. Solving for m would give m = 0.560 / 1.86. Let me calculate that. 0.560 divided by 1.86. Hmm, 1.86 times 0.3 is 0.558, which is very close to 0.560. So m is approximately 0.3 m. Wait, but wait, 0.3 *1.86 is 0.558, which is just a tiny bit less than 0.560. So maybe m is around 0.300 or 0.301. Let's say approximately 0.30 m. So the effective molal concentration is 0.30 m.

Now the second part is the osmotic pressure at body temperature, which is 37°C. Osmotic pressure is given by π = iMRT, where i is the van't Hoff factor, M is the molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait. The molality is 0.3 m. I can't directly use molality in osmotic pressure because osmotic pressure depends on molarity (moles per liter), or more accurately, the concentration in terms of particles. Oh wait, but for dilute aqueous solutions, sometimes molality and molarity are approximated, especially when density is considered. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the question is simplifying and using molality as a direct measure of concentration.

Wait, no, the formula π = iCRT, where C is the concentration in molarity. But wait, in the case where we have the molality, perhaps we can convert molality to molarity. Because molality is moles per kilogram of solvent, and molarity is moles per liter of solution. For dilute solutions, 1 kg of water is about a liter, so molality and molarity are roughly the same. But for precise calculation, I might need more info.

Wait, but the problem states "effective molal concentration" which I think refers to molality. So perhaps the question is using molality as the measure, but for osmotic pressure, which uses molarity. So maybe I need to convert molality to molarity.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the approximation that for blood serum, the density is such that molality and molarity are roughly the same. Or perhaps it's assuming that the solution is dilute enough that the molality equals the molarity. I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, blood is mostly water, but with solutes. When you have a molality m, you can find molarity by considering the mass of the solvent. One kg of water is 1 liter approximately, but when you add solutes, the volume increases a bit. But perhaps the question is simplifying and using molality as molarity for the purpose of calculating osmotic pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula π = i mRT, where m is molality. Wait, that might not be correct because R is in terms of molarity units. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall the formula correctly. The osmotic pressure is given by π = iMRT, where M is the molarity (moles per liter). But if we're given molality (m = moles per kg solvent), we can approximate M ≈ m * density of solvent in kg/L. For water, the density is 1 kg/L, so M ≈ m. So in this case, with m = 0.3 m, M is approximately 0.3 M.

Wait, but wait. The serum's density is probably close to that of water, maybe a bit higher. So M would be a bit higher than m. But without exact density, perhaps the question treats M as approximately equal to m.

So, assuming M is roughly 0.3 M. Now, what about the van't Hoff factor i? Blood serum contains various solutes, but the main contributor is NaCl, which dissociates into two ions. So if the main solute is like NaCl, then i would be 2. But wait, blood has other solutes too, like glucose, proteins, etc. But serum's osmotic pressure is primarily due to ions. Wait, but sometimes blood is considered to have an osmotic pressure equivalent to 0.3% NaCl solution, which is isotonic. Wait, 0.9% NaCl is isotonic. Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the question says the effective molal concentration is 0.3 m, implying that the total particles are considered. So perhaps i*m is the effective concentration. So if the solution has a molality m, and each molecule dissociates into i particles, then the total concentration for osmotic pressure is i*m, but in terms of molality. Wait, but earlier we decided to approximate M ≈ m. So perhaps the van't Hoff factor is considered as part of the molal concentration.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The effective molal concentration already accounts for the dissociation. So maybe the problem is considering that the freezing point depression already accounts for all particles, so the effective molal is the sum of all particles, so when calculating osmotic pressure, we can take that effective molal as the equivalent molarity, and multiply by RT.

Wait, the freezing point depression formula uses molality, but it's based on the total number of particles. So for example, if a solute dissociates into two ions, the molality for freezing point depression would be 2m. So the given m is already considering the dissociation, so when calculating osmotic pressure, which depends on total particles, the effective molal is the same as the effective molarity for osmotic pressure.

Wait, maybe that's the approach here. So the effective molal concentration is 0.3 m, which implies that each mole of solute contributes i moles of particles. So for osmotic pressure, π = i * m * R * T. But wait, no, the formula is π = (i * m) * R * T. But if the effective molal is already i * m, then π would be (effective m) * R * T.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula π = mRT, where m is the molality, assuming that each solute contributes fully to the osmotic pressure, so i is 1. But that can't be right because most solutes in blood dissociate.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the data given. So, the effective molal concentration is 0.3 m. Let's proceed with that.

So the temperature is 37°C, which is 310 K (37 + 273.15). R is the gas constant, 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

Wait, but if we're using molality and osmotic pressure, perhaps there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of molality in place of molarity, which is an approximation.

So, M = 0.3 m, but since for dilute solutions, M ≈ m (since 1 kg ≈ 1 L for water), so M is 0.3 M.

Then, π = MRT. Wait, but wait, if the solute dissociates into multiple particles, like NaCl into two ions, then the total concentration for osmotic pressure would be 2 * 0.3 M = 0.6 M. So π = 0.6 * R * T.

Wait, but that would assume that each mole of solute dissociates into two moles of ions. But the problem doesn't specify the solute, so perhaps the effective molal concentration already includes the van't Hoff factor. So if the freezing point depression is calculated using m_total = i * m, then for osmotic pressure, the concentration is also i * m. So, in that case, the effective molal is 0.3 m, which is the same as i * m. So when calculating osmotic pressure, we can just use that.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the freezing point depression gives the effective molality, which includes the dissociation. So when calculating osmotic pressure, the effective concentration is same as the effective molality. So perhaps π = (effective m) * R * T.

But I'm not entirely confident, but let's proceed.

So, given that, effective m is 0.3 m.

Wait, but the osmotic pressure formula uses molarity (M), not molality (m). So how to convert m to M?

Molarity M is moles per liter of solution. Molality m is moles per kilogram of solvent.

For a dilute solution, 1 kg of solvent is approximately 1 liter of solution, so M ≈ m. But for more accurate calculation, we can use the formula M = (m * 1000) / (1000 + m * Mw_solvent), where Mw_solvent is the molecular weight of the solvent (water is 18 g/mol).

But since m is 0.3, which is small, the denominator is approximately 1000 + 0.3*18 = 1000 + 5.4 = 1005.4.

So M ≈ (0.3 * 1000) / 1005.4 ≈ 300 / 1005.4 ≈ 0.298 M, which is roughly 0.3 M. So M is approximately 0.3 M.

Now, if we're considering the van't Hoff factor i, for example, if the solute is NaCl, i=2. But since the effective molal concentration already accounts for the dissociation (as freezing point depression depends on total particles), perhaps we don't need to multiply by i again.

Wait, no. The freezing point depression formula uses the total molality of all particles. So if a solute dissociates into i particles, then the total molality for freezing point is i * m. So the given m_eff is i * m_solute. So when calculating osmotic pressure, π = i * m_solute * R * T = m_eff * R * T.

Ah, that makes sense. So in the freezing point, the effective molality is m_eff = i * m. So when calculating osmotic pressure, the concentration is also m_eff, so π = m_eff * R * T.

So in this case, m_eff is 0.3 m, so π = 0.3 * R * T.

Wait, but wait. R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, and T is 310 K.

So π = 0.3 * 0.0821 * 310.

Calculating that: 0.3 * 0.0821 = 0.02463, then 0.02463 * 310 ≈ 7.64 atm.

Looking at the options, let's see. The first part was 0.3 m, so looking for that. Option D is 0.30 m, 7.6 atm. That matches our calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

0.3 * 0.0821 = 0.02463. Then 0.02463 * 310 = ?

Well, 0.02463 * 300 = 7.389, and 0.02463 * 10 = 0.2463, so total ≈ 7.6353 atm. So approximately 7.6 atm, which is option D.

So the correct answer would be D: 0.30 m, 7.6 atm.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by determining the effective molal concentration of the solute in the blood serum using the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m
\]

Here:
- \(\Delta T_f = 0.560^\circ \text{C}\) (freezing point depression),
- \(K_f = 1.86^\circ \text{C·kg/mol}\) (cryoscopic constant for water),
- \(m\) is the molality.

Rearranging for \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f} = \frac{0.560}{1.86} \approx 0.30 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the effective molal concentration of the solute is approximately \(0.30 \, \text{m}\).

Next, we calculate the osmotic pressure at body temperature (\(37^\circ \text{C}\) or \(310 \, \text{K}\)) using the formula:

\[
\pi = m \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Here:
- \(m = 0.30 \, \text{m}\),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/mol·K}\) (gas constant),
- \(T = 310 \, \text{K}\).

Substituting the values:

\[
\pi = 0.30 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 310 = 0.02463 \cdot 310 \approx 7.64 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the osmotic pressure is approximately \(7.6 \, \text{atm}\).

Finally, comparing the results with the given options, the correct choice is:

**D: 0.30 m, 7.6 atm.**
