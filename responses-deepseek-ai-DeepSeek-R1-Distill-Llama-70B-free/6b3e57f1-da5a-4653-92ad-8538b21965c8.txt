Question:

A husband and wife owned and operated a grocery store. The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store. The defendant picked up the package, which contained baked bread that had been delivered earlier in the evening, and the defendant then ran off. Which of the following crimes will the defendant most likely be convicted of?

Options:

A: Burglary and theft.
B: Larceny and burglary.
C: Larceny.
D: Attempted burglary and theft.
E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

The scenario involves a husband and wife who own and operate a grocery store. The store is on the first floor of a building where they live in a second-floor apartment. One evening, the defendant walks past the store and decides to steal money from a cigar box inside. He sneaks to the rear of the building, opens the gate to the fenced backyard, and tries to pry open the back window of the store. The husband's watchdog starts barking, so the husband goes out onto the second-floor porch and sees the defendant. He yells at him, startling the defendant who then runs. But before running, the defendant notices a large package near the rear door, which contains baked bread delivered earlier. He picks it up and runs off.

The question is asking which crimes the defendant will most likely be convicted of, with the options provided.

First, I need to identify the elements of the potential crimes here. Let's consider each possible crime one by one.

1. **Burglary**: Typically, burglary involves the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside. The key elements are breaking and entering, into a structure, with felonious intent.

   In this case, the defendant tried to pry open the back window. So, was there a breaking? Attempting to pry the window open could be seen as an attempt to break in, but did he actually break in? If the window was closed but he didn't successfully enter, does that count as burglary?

   Wait, but in some jurisdictions, just the act of attempting to break in with intent can be considered attempted burglary, not completed burglary. So maybe he didn't complete the burglary because he didn't actually enter the building. So maybe he's guilty of attempted burglary, not the completed crime.

2. **Larceny**: Larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it.

   The defendant picked up the package of bread. The package was outside the rear door, so it was already outside the store. So he took it from there. Since the store had already received the delivery, the package was their property. So when he took it, that's a trespassory taking. So that would be larceny.

3. **Attempted Burglary**: If he tried to break in but didn't succeed, he could be charged with attempted burglary. But in some places, the attempt to commit burglary is a separate offense.

4. **Theft**: Theft is a broader term that can include larceny, but sometimes theft is used to encompass different types of stealing, like by deception or embezzlement. But here, the defendant took the package, so that's larceny, which is a type of theft.

Now, let's look at the facts. He tried to break into the store through the back window. He was attempting to enter with the intent to steal money (as per his initial plan). So that's an intent to commit larceny inside, which would make it burglary if he had entered. But since he didn't get in, it's attempted burglary.

Then, when he saw the package outside, he took it. That's larceny because it's trespassory taking of property.

Wait, but does the initial act of opening the gate and trying to get in count as trespassing? Trespassing would be entering someone's property without permission. So he did trespass by entering the backyard through the gate. But trespassing is a separate offense, but maybe it's included in other charges.

Looking at the answer choices:

A: Burglary and theft. — But he didn't commit burglary because he didn't enter the building.

B: Larceny and burglary. — Same issue.

C: Larceny. — He did commit larceny, but what about the attempted burglary?

D: Attempted burglary and theft. — Theft is broader, but the specific crime here is larceny. So might be, but let me think.

E: Trespassing and attempted burglary. — He did trespass, but the question is whether that's a separate charge or rolled into another offense.

F: Trespassing and larceny. — He did both, but again, maybe the trespass is part of another offense.

G: Burglary. — No, because he didn't enter.

H: Attempted larceny. — Wait, he actually took the package, so it's completed larceny, not attempted.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary. — Yes, this seems to fit. He attempted to break in (so attempted burglary) and successfully took the package (larceny).

J: Trespassing, larceny, and attempted burglary. — He did trespass by entering the yard, but sometimes trespassing is a lesser included offense and might be merged. Or maybe it's charged as part of the burglary attempt.

So the main points: he attempted to break into the store, which is attempted burglary. He then took the package, which is larceny.

Looking at the options, option I is larceny and attempted burglary. That seems correct.

Wait, but some might argue that the initial trespass into the yard is a separate charge, but often in criminal law, when the trespass is part of a more serious offense, it's not charged separately. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

Let me double-check the elements.

Attempted burglary requires specific intent to commit a felony inside. He intended to steal money, so that's the intent. His act was attempting to break in through the window. So that's attempted burglary.

Larceny: He took the package, which was property of the store, without permission, with intent to deprive them of it. So that's larceny.

So the crimes would be attempted burglary and larceny. Looking at the options, option I is larceny and attempted burglary, which matches.

Alternatively, option D is attempted burglary and theft. But theft is a broader term, and the specific crime here is larceny. So option I is more precise.

So the answer should be I.

The defendant's actions involve two key crimes: attempted burglary and larceny. 

1. **Attempted Burglary**: The defendant attempted to break into the grocery store by trying to pry open the back window with the intent to steal money. Although he did not successfully enter the building, the intent and act of attempting to break in satisfy the elements of attempted burglary.

2. **Larceny**: After being startled, the defendant took a package containing baked bread that was outside the rear door of the store. This act constitutes larceny, as it involves the trespassory taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because the defendant did not complete the burglary.
- **Option B**: Incorrect for the same reason as A.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it does not account for the attempted burglary.
- **Option D**: While attempted burglary is correct, "theft" is a broader term, and the specific crime here is larceny.
- **Option E**: Trespassing is not a separate charge in this context, as it is encompassed by the attempted burglary.
- **Option F**: Similar to E, trespassing is not a separate charge.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because the defendant did not complete the burglary.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because the larceny was completed, not attempted.
- **Option I**: Correct, as it includes both larceny and attempted burglary.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because trespassing is not a separate charge.

The most accurate answer is **Option I: Larceny and attempted burglary**.
