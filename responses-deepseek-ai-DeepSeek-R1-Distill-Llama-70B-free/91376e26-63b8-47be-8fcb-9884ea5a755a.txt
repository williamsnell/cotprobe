A: 64
B: 408
C: 128
D: 320
E: 280
F: 96
G: 192

Okay, so I've got this math problem here about whales and their migration patterns. Hmm, let's see. The question is comparing humpback whales and gray whales. I need to figure out how many more miles the humpback whales would have traveled than the gray whales if they had both traveled for the same amount of time, specifically 32 days.

Wait, wait. Let me read the problem again. So, humpback whales went 2,240 miles in 28 days. Gray whales went 2,368 miles in 32 days. The question is, if the humpback whales had traveled at the same rate for 32 days, how many more miles than the gray whales would they have covered.

So, I think I need to find the rate at which each whale type travels and then calculate the distance for 32 days for both, then find the difference.

Wait, no, no. Because the gray whales already traveled for 32 days, and the humpback traveled for 28. So, the question is, if the humpback whales also went for 32 days at their usual rate, how much more would they have gone compared to the gray whales.

Wait, no, the gray whales went 2,368 miles in 32 days. So their distance is fixed at 2,368 for 32 days. The humpback's rate is 2,240 miles over 28 days. So I need to find the humpback's daily rate, then multiply by 32 days to get their total distance. Then subtract the gray whale's total to find the difference.

So first, let's calculate the humpback's rate. Rate is distance divided by time. So 2,240 miles / 28 days. Let me compute that. 2240 ÷ 28. Hmm, 28 times 80 is 2240, right? Because 28×80=2240. So their rate is 80 miles per day.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that division. 28 × 80 = 2240, yes. So the humpback's rate is 80 miles per day.

Now, if they traveled for 32 days at this rate, their total distance would be 80 * 32. 80 times 32 is 2560 miles.

Wait, wait. 80 × 30 is 2400, and 80 × 2 is 160. So 2400 +160 = 2560. Yes, that's right.

Now, the gray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days. So the humpback would have gone 2560, gray went 2368. The difference is 2560 - 2368 = ?

Let me subtract that. 2560 minus 2368. Hmm, 2560 minus 2300 is 260, and then subtract another 68. 260 -68 is 192. Oh wait, wait. Alternatively, 2368 + 192 = 2560. So the difference is 192 miles.

So the humpback whales would have traveled 192 miles more than the gray whales.

Looking at the options, option G is 192. So the answer should be G.

The humpback whales' migration rate is calculated by dividing the distance they traveled (2,240 miles) by the time (28 days), which equals 80 miles per day. If they traveled at this rate for 32 days, the total distance would be \( 80 \times 32 = 2560 \) miles. The gray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days. The difference between the two distances is \( 2560 - 2368 = 192 \) miles. 

Answer: G
