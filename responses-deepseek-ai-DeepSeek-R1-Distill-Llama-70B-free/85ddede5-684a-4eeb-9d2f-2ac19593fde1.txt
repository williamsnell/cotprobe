Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the housing construction industry and how it might be affected if commercial banks can compete freely with mutual savings banks. Hmm, I need to figure out what the correct answer is.

First, I should probably understand what each type of bank does. From what I remember, mutual savings banks are typically focused on savings and home mortgages. They're known for offering mortgages to individuals. On the other hand, commercial banks usually deal with a broader range of activities, including business loans, personal loans, and other financial services. They might not have focused as much on home mortgages before, or maybe they do, but perhaps mutual savings banks have a stronger presence there.

If commercial banks are allowed to compete freely, that means they can offer similar services as mutual savings banks, especially in the mortgage sector. So, more competition in the mortgage market. How would that affect housing construction?

Well, more competition usually leads to more options for consumers. If commercial banks start offering mortgages, maybe they'll try to attract customers by offering better rates or terms. That could make it easier for people to get mortgages, which would mean more people can buy houses. If more people are buying houses, the demand for housing increases. That would probably encourage more construction because builders would see higher demand and want to meet it. So, the housing industry might boom because of increased demand and more available financing options.

Wait, could there be any downsides? Maybe if commercial banks flood the market with mortgages, it could lead to lower quality loans if they're trying to compete too aggressively, but that's more related to the 2008 crisis, which was about subprime lending. But the question is general, so maybe that's not the point here. The question is about what might happen, not necessarily the risks involved.

Looking at the options, option B says more houses could be bought. That seems plausible because more financing options would make it easier for people to purchase homes. Option G says the housing industry would boom, which also makes sense because increased demand leads to more construction.

But wait, the question is about housing construction, so it's about supply. If more people are buying, then builders have incentive to build more, so the industry would boom. So G is a possible answer.

Option D says mutual savings banks would become obsolete. Maybe not, because mutual savings banks might still have their niche or find other ways to compete. They might not disappear entirely.

Option C is that the housing industry would slump. That doesn't seem right because more competition usually brings more activity, not less.

Option F mentions more volatile housing prices. I'm not sure about that. More competition could stabilize prices or make them more variable depending on how the market reacts, but I'm not certain.

So putting it together, if commercial banks compete more in mortgages, it's likely that more people can get loans, leading to more housing purchases. That would increase demand, prompting more construction. So the housing industry would boom, which is option G. Alternatively, option B says more houses could be bought, which is also a correct outcome, but the question is about the industry as a whole. If more houses are built, that's the boom.

So I think the answer is G.

The correct answer is G: The housing industry would boom.

When commercial banks are allowed to compete freely with mutual savings banks in the mortgage sector, they introduce more competition. This can lead to better mortgage rates and terms, making it easier for individuals to purchase homes. Increased demand for housing encourages construction to meet that demand, leading to a boom in the housing industry.

Answer: G
