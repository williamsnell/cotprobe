Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a steel ball bouncing off a steel plate. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, I remember that when objects collide, especially in cases of elastic or inelastic collisions, the concept of restitution comes into play.

The question says the ball is moving at 5 m/s and hits the plate at a 30-degree angle from the normal. Wait, the normal is perpendicular to the surface, right? So the angle here is 30 degrees from that perpendicular direction. That probably affects how the velocity components change upon collision.

I think the coefficient of restitution (e) is given as 0.8. I recall that the coefficient of restitution is the ratio of the relative speed after collision to the relative speed before collision. But wait, I need to be careful about which components I'm considering here. Since the plate is heavy and smooth, I can probably assume that the plate doesn't move, and the collision is in two dimensions, but only the normal component of the velocity changes.

So the ball's velocity before collision has two components: the normal (perpendicular) component and the tangential (parallel) component. The angle is 30 degrees from the normal, so the normal component would be v_initial * cos(theta), and the tangential component would be v_initial * sin(theta).

But wait, in collisions where the surface is smooth, the tangential component (parallel to the surface) doesn't change because there's no friction. Only the normal component changes. Oh right, because the impulse from the collision is along the normal direction.

So the initial normal velocity component is v_initial * cos(30°). Let's compute that. Cos(30°) is approximately √3/2, which is about 0.866. So 5 m/s * 0.866 is roughly 4.33 m/s. 

Now, the coefficient of restitution e is 0.8. So the final normal velocity component (after collision) would be e multiplied by the initial normal velocity. But wait, the direction changes. So if the initial normal was towards the plate (let's say negative direction), the final would be positive, so the magnitude is e * v_initial_normal.

So v_final_normal = e * v_initial_normal. Let's compute that: 0.8 * 4.33 ≈ 3.464 m/s. 

The tangential component, as I thought earlier, doesn't change because the collision is smooth. So v_tangential remains 5 * sin(30°). Sin(30°) is 0.5, so 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 m/s.

Now, the total velocity after the collision is the vector sum of the normal and tangential components. Since they're perpendicular, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude.

So v_final = sqrt( (3.464)^2 + (2.5)^2 ). Let's compute that:

3.464 squared is approximately 12 (since 3.464^2 is 12, because (2√3)^2 is 4*3=12). Wait, but 3.464 is approximately 2√3, which is about 3.464. So squaring that gives 12.

2.5 squared is 6.25. So adding them gives 12 + 6.25 = 18.25. The square root of 18.25 is approximately 4.27 m/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.3 m/s, which is very close to what I calculated. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check my steps. Did I handle the components correctly? Yes, only the normal component changes, and it's multiplied by e. The tangential stays the same. So the calculation seems right. Also, sqrt(18.25) is 4.272..., which rounds to 4.3. So yeah, option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision using the concept of restitution and the decomposition of velocity into components. The steel ball strikes the plate at an angle of $30^\circ$ from the normal with an initial velocity of $5 \, \mathrm{m/s}$. The coefficient of restitution is $e = 0.8$, and the plate is smooth, meaning the tangential velocity component remains unchanged.

1. **Decompose the initial velocity into components**:
   - The normal (perpendicular) component of the velocity is:
     \[
     v_{\text{initial, normal}} = v \cdot \cos(30^\circ) = 5 \cdot 0.866 \approx 4.33 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
     \]
   - The tangential (parallel) component of the velocity is:
     \[
     v_{\text{tangential}} = v \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 5 \cdot 0.5 = 2.5 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
     \]

2. **Apply the coefficient of restitution**:
   The normal component of the velocity after the collision is reversed in direction and reduced by the factor $e$:
   \[
   v_{\text{final, normal}} = e \cdot v_{\text{initial, normal}} = 0.8 \cdot 4.33 \approx 3.464 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
   \]
   The tangential component remains unchanged:
   \[
   v_{\text{tangential}} = 2.5 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the final velocity magnitude**:
   The final velocity is the vector sum of the normal and tangential components. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   v_{\text{final}} = \sqrt{v_{\text{final, normal}}^2 + v_{\text{tangential}}^2} = \sqrt{(3.464)^2 + (2.5)^2}.
   \]
   Compute each term:
   \[
   (3.464)^2 \approx 12, \quad (2.5)^2 = 6.25.
   \]
   Add them:
   \[
   v_{\text{final}} = \sqrt{12 + 6.25} = \sqrt{18.25} \approx 4.27 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
   \]

4. **Match the result to the closest option**:
   The closest option to $4.27 \, \mathrm{m/s}$ is $4.3 \, \mathrm{m/s}$, which corresponds to **option C**.
