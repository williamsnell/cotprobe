Question:

Which of the following is a correct statement about the cohesion-tension theory for the ascent of water in the xylem?

Options:

A: Living cells of the phloem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water.
B: Water moves from a sink region with high hydrostatic pressure to a source region with low hydrostatic pressure.
C: The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column.
D: The cohesion of water molecules prevents tension in the water column.
E: The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells prevents tension in the water column.
F: Living cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water.
G: The cohesion-tension theory states that water rises in the xylem due to the gravitational pull.
H: The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.

Okay, so I've got this question about the cohesion-tension theory and the ascent of water in plants. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with how water moves from the roots up to the leaves, especially against gravity. Let's break down the options and see which one fits.

The question asks which statement is correct about the cohesion-tension theory. I think the theory explains how water rises in the xylem. So first, I need to recall what each part of the theory entails.

Cohesion refers to the attraction between water molecules. This is important because it creates a sort of 'tension' or 'negative pressure' in the water column. Tension comes from the evaporation of water from the leaves, right? That's the transpiration stream. So as water evaporates from mesophyll cells into the air spaces, it creates a pull on the water column in the xylem.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Living cells of phloem... Wait, phloem is involved in transporting sugars, not water. The ascent of water is through the xylem, so this is probably wrong.

Option B: Water moves from high to low hydrostatic pressure. Wait, in plants, water moves from high to low pressure? Or is it the other way around? Wait, in the xylem, the tension is negative pressure. So if a sink has high hydrostatic pressure and source has low, then water would flow from sink to source. But I'm a bit confused. Maybe in this context, the sink is where water is being used, like in the leaves. So the leaves (sink) have lower pressure, pulling water from the source (roots, higher pressure). Not sure, need to think more.

Option C: Cohesion causes embolisms. No, I thought that embolisms are air bubbles that form when the water column breaks, which is a problem because it disrupts the flow. Cohesion helps prevent this, so cohesion would reduce embolisms, not cause them. So C is wrong.

Option D: Cohesion prevents tension. I don't think so. Cohesion actually helps create the tension. Without cohesion, the water couldn't withstand the negative pressure. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Evaporation prevents tension. No, evaporation creates the tension. So E is wrong.

Option F: Xylem cells are the main conduit. Yes, xylem vessels and tracheids are dead, rigid cells that form tubes for water to rise. So F sounds correct. But wait, the option says 'living cells' of xylem. Wait, no, xylem vessels are dead at maturity. So if F says living cells, that's wrong. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Cohesion-tension due to gravity. No, the theory isn't about gravity pulling the water up. It's about the tension created by transpiration. So G is wrong.

Option H: Evaporation generates tension. Yes, that matches what I was thinking. Evaporation from the mesophyll cells in the leaves leads to a decrease in pressure, creating a tension in the xylem, which pulls the water up.

So looking back, the correct statements are probably H and perhaps F, but F's incorrect because xylem cells are dead. So between H and another option, H seems correct.

Wait, the options again. Option H says the evaporation from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension. That's correct. So the answer should be H.

The cohesion-tension theory explains how water rises in the xylem, driven by the cohesion of water molecules and the tension created by transpiration. Cohesion allows water molecules to stick together, forming a continuous column, while transpiration (evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells) generates tension, pulling water upward against gravity. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The phloem transports sugars, not water; water ascends via the xylem.
- **B**: Incorrect. Water moves from regions of higher hydrostatic pressure (e.g., roots) to regions of lower pressure (e.g., leaves), but this is not the defining mechanism of the cohesion-tension theory.
- **C**: Incorrect. Cohesion helps prevent embolisms (air bubbles) rather than causing them.
- **D**: Incorrect. Cohesion does not prevent tension; it helps maintain the water column under tension.
- **E**: Incorrect. Evaporation creates tension, not prevents it.
- **F**: Incorrect. The xylem is the main conduit for water ascent, but it is composed of dead cells (vessels and tracheids), not living cells.
- **G**: Incorrect. The cohesion-tension theory is not based on gravity pulling water up but on tension generated by transpiration.
- **H**: Correct. Evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the xylem, which pulls water upward.

The correct answer is **H**.
