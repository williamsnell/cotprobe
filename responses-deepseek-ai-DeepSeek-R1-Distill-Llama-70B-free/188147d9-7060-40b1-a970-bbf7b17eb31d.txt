Question:

The President appointed a delegation to enter into negotiations with representatives of a foreign government to study the problem of preventing the extinction of certain species of rabbits. The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. Assume that after the treaty goes into effect, a state legislature enacts a statute that provides that "any licensed rabbit-hunter in the state and its surrounding environs may increase his monthly catch of rabbits from 10 to 15 in each of the specified months of the authorized rabbit-hunting season from the first day of October until the last day of February. " If challenged, the enactment of the aforementioned statute would most likely be declared

Options:

A: constitutional, because the enactment falls within the Tenth Amendment's reservedpowers.
B: unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.
C: unconstitutional, because it conflicts with federal law.
D: constitutional, because the treaty does not specifically prohibit the increase in hunting.
E: constitutional, because the treaty only applies to the federal government.
F: constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.
G: constitutional, because the state has the right to regulate its own natural resources.
H: unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.
I: unconstitutional, because it interferes with international relations.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with treaties and state legislation. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: The President appointed a delegation to negotiate with a foreign government about preventing the extinction of certain rabbit species. Their goal was to study the problem and create regulations in a bilateral agreement. They formed a treaty that includes a permanent commission to monitor enforcement. So, this is a treaty between the US and another country, right?

Then, after the treaty is in effect, a state legislature passes a statute that increases the monthly catch for rabbit hunters from 10 to 15 during specific months. The question is whether this statute would be declared constitutional or unconstitutional if challenged.

The options are A through J, but I'll focus on the reasoning first.

I remember that under the US Constitution, treaties are the supreme law of the land. Article VI says that treaties made under the authority of the United States are part of the supreme law, along with the Constitution and federal laws. So, if a state law conflicts with a treaty, the treaty should take precedence.

In this case, the treaty's purpose is to protect endangered rabbits by regulating hunting. The state statute seems to allow more hunting by increasing the catch limit. That sounds like it directly conflicts with the treaty's goal. So the state law would be in conflict with federal law (the treaty), making it unconstitutional.

Wait, but I should think about the Tenth Amendment too. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not given to the federal government to the states. But if the federal government has the authority to make treaties, which they do via Article II, then state laws can't contradict that. So even though states have some reserved powers, in areas where the federal government has acted, especially through a treaty, state laws must yield.

Looking at the options, option C says unconstitutional because it conflicts with federal law. That makes sense because the treaty is federal law, and the state statute goes against it.

Option A says it's constitutional under the Tenth Amendment, but I don't think that applies here because the treaty is a federal action that preempts state law.

Option B says all treaties are supreme law, which is true, but the issue is about conflict, so C is more specific.

Option E suggests the treaty only applies to the federal government, but treaties can affect state laws if they cover the same subject matter.

Options F and G talk about state regulation of hunting and natural resources, but again, when there's a conflicting federal treaty, those state powers are limited.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: unconstitutional because it conflicts with federal law.

The question revolves around whether a state statute increasing rabbit hunting limits conflicts with a federal treaty aimed at protecting endangered rabbit species. Under Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, treaties are part of the supreme law of the land, taking precedence over conflicting state laws. The treaty in question regulates rabbit hunting to prevent extinction, while the state statute allows increased hunting, creating a direct conflict. The Tenth Amendment does not apply here because the federal government's treaty-making power preempts state authority in this area. Therefore, the statute is unconstitutional as it conflicts with federal law.

The correct answer is **C: unconstitutional, because it conflicts with federal law.**

C
