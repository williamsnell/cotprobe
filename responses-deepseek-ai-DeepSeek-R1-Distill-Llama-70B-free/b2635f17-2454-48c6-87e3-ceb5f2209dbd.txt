Okay, so I've got this series to evaluate: the sum from k=1 to infinity of [(-1)^(k-1)/k] multiplied by another sum from n=0 to infinity of 1/(k*2^n +1). Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance. Let me try to break it down.

First, I'll write it out to visualize better. The series is S = Σ [(-1)^(k-1)/k ] * [Σ 1/(k*2^n +1) ] from k=1 to ∞ and n=0 to ∞. Wait, no, the inner sum is for each k, so for each k, I have to compute the sum over n first, and then multiply by (-1)^(k-1)/k, and sum all those terms.

Let me focus on the inner sum: for a fixed k, sum from n=0 to ∞ of 1/(k*2^n +1). That looks like a geometric-like series, but it's not immediately obvious how to sum it. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for this inner sum.

Let me denote the inner sum as S_k = Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(k*2^n +1). Let's see if I can manipulate this. Maybe I can write it as Σ_{n=0}^∞ 1/(k*(2^n) +1). Hmm, perhaps express this as an integral or use a known series formula.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can express 1/(k*2^n +1) as an integral. I remember that 1/a = ∫_0^1 x^{a-1} dx for a>0. So substituting, 1/(k*2^n +1) = ∫_0^1 x^{k*2^n} dx. Then, S_k would be the sum from n=0 to ∞ of ∫_0^1 x^{k*2^n} dx. Since the sum and integral are linear, I can interchange them (if convergence allows), so S_k = ∫_0^1 Σ_{n=0}^∞ x^{k*2^n} dx.

Hmm, but the sum Σ x^{k*2^n} for n=0 to ∞. That's a sum over terms like x^{k}, x^{2k}, x^{4k}, x^{8k}, etc. So it's a geometric series but with exponents doubling each time. Wait, that's similar to a geometric series with ratio x^{k}, but each term is squared. Wait, no, the exponents are k, 2k, 4k, 8k, etc. So it's x^k + x^{2k} + x^{4k} + x^{8k} + ... 

I'm not sure how to sum this. Wait, I remember something about binary exponents or something. Alternatively, maybe I can find a generating function or relate it to a known function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S_k as a sum that telescopes or relates to a logarithm. Wait, let's think differently. Maybe I can consider binary representations or binary exponents. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this sum in terms of a geometric series with a common ratio that's a function of x^k.

Wait, another approach: The sum S_k is 1/(k +1) + 1/(2k +1) + 1/(4k +1) + 1/(8k +1) + ... for n=0,1,2,...

Wait, that's 1/(k*(2^0) +1) + 1/(k*(2^1)+1) + 1/(k*(2^2)+1) + ... 

Hmm, maybe I can write this as Σ_{m=0}^∞ 1/(k*2^m +1), where m = n. Is there a known formula for this sum?

Wait, I think I remember that Σ_{m=0}^∞ 1/(a*2^m + b) can be expressed in terms of logarithms or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it to a telescoping product or some other series.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this sum as an integral. Let's think again. Since 1/(a) = ∫_0^1 x^{a-1} dx, then 1/(k*2^m +1) = ∫_0^1 x^{k*2^m} dx. So S_k becomes the sum over m of the integral from 0 to1 of x^{k*2^m} dx, which is the integral from 0 to1 of the sum over m of x^{k*2^m} dx.

Now, the sum inside the integral is sum_{m=0}^∞ x^{k*2^m} = x^k + x^{2k} + x^{4k} + x^{8k} + ... 

Wait a minute, this is a lacunary series, and I'm not sure if there's a closed form for it. Maybe I can think of it as a product or something else.

Wait, perhaps I can express this sum as the sum over binary digits. Let me think about binary representations. Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution. Let t = x^k, then the sum becomes t + t^2 + t^4 + t^8 + ... up to infinity. That's the same as t + t^2 + t^4 + t^8 + ... which is a geometric series with ratio t, but each term squares the previous exponent. Hmm, but that's not a standard geometric series. Wait, it's a geometric series with exponents that double each time. So the sum would be t/(1 - t) + t^2/(1 - t^2) + ... ? No, that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a generating function for this sum. Let me denote the sum as f(t) = t + t^2 + t^4 + t^8 + ... Then, f(t^2) = t^2 + t^4 + t^8 + t^16 + ... So, f(t) - f(t^2) = t. Hmm, but that's f(t) = t + f(t^2). That's a functional equation, but I'm not sure if that helps me find f(t) in terms of elementary functions.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the binary expansion. Since each term is t^(2^m), the sum f(t) = sum_{m=0}^\infty t^{2^m} is known as a lacunary function, and its closed form isn't straightforward. So perhaps I can't find a closed-form expression for S_k using this approach.

Hmm, maybe I can change variables. Let me consider that for each k, S_k = sum_{m=0}^\infty 1/(k*2^m + 1). Let me make a substitution: let u = 2^m, so du/dm = u ln 2, so dm = du/(u ln 2). But m starts at 0, so u starts at 1, and increases as powers of 2. But this substitution might not be helpful because u isn't continuous here.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can approximate the sum S_k for large k. But I'm not sure if that helps because k is varying in the outer sum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can switch the order of summation. Let me see: the original series is sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} /k ] * [ sum_{n=0}^\infty 1/(k*2^n +1) }.

If I switch the order, it would be sum_{n=0}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} /k ] * [1/(k*2^n +1) }.

Wait, maybe that's a better approach. So S = sum_{n=0}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} / (k (k*2^n +1)) }.

But I'm not sure if that's easier. Let's see, for each n, I have sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} ] / [k(k * 2^n + 1) }.

Hmm, maybe I can express this as an integral. Let's consider that 1/(k * 2^n + 1) = ∫_0^1 x^{k*2^n} dx.

So then, S becomes sum_{n=0}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} ] /k * ∫_0^1 x^{k*2^n} dx.

Interchanging sum and integral (assuming convergence), we get S = ∫_0^1 sum_{n=0}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} x^{k*2^n} ] /k dx.

Now, the inner sum over k is sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} x^{k*2^n} ] /k. That looks familiar. Let me consider the series sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} y^k ] /k, which is known to be ln(1 + y) for |y| <1. So in this case, y = x^{2^n}, so the sum becomes ln(1 + x^{2^n}).

Therefore, S = ∫_0^1 sum_{n=0}^\infty ln(1 + x^{2^n}) dx.

Hmm, that's interesting. So S = ∫_0^1 sum_{n=0}^\infty ln(1 + x^{2^n}) dx.

Wait, the sum inside the integral is sum_{n=0}^\infty ln(1 + x^{2^n}) = ln(product_{n=0}^\infty (1 + x^{2^n} )).

And I remember that product_{n=0}^\infty (1 + x^{2^n}) ) equals 1/(1 - x) for |x| <1. Because each term (1 + x^{2^n}) multiplies to give the binary expansion, and the product telescopes to 1/(1 - x). Let me check that.

Let me compute the product for a few terms. (1 + x)(1 + x^2)(1 + x^4)... up to (1 + x^{2^m}).

Multiplying (1 + x)(1 + x^2) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3.

Multiply by (1 + x^4): (1 + x + x^2 + x^3)(1 + x^4) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7.

So it's adding all exponents up to 7. Continuing this, each multiplication by (1 + x^{2^{n}}) fills in all the missing exponents up to 2^{n+1} -1. So as m approaches infinity, the product approaches 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = 1/(1 - x) for |x| <1.

Therefore, product_{n=0}^\infty (1 + x^{2^n}) ) = 1/(1 - x) for 0 < x <1.

So the sum inside the integral becomes ln(1/(1 - x)) ) = -ln(1 - x).

Wait, no: the product is 1/(1 - x), so the sum of the logs is ln(1/(1 - x)) ) = -ln(1 -x).

Wait, no: sum_{n=0}^\infty ln(1 + x^{2^n}) = ln( product (1 + x^{2^n}) ) = ln(1/(1 -x)) ) = -ln(1 -x).

So the integral becomes S = ∫_0^1 [ -ln(1 - x) ] dx.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because the product is 1/(1 - x), so the natural log is ln(1/(1 -x)) ) which is -ln(1 -x). So yes, the sum inside the integral is -ln(1 -x).

Wait, but in the integral, x is between 0 and 1, so 1 -x is between 0 and 1, so ln(1 -x) is negative, so -ln(1 -x) is positive. That makes sense.

So S = ∫_0^1 [ -ln(1 -x) ] dx. Wait, no, because the sum gives us ln(1/(1 -x)) ) which is -ln(1 -x), so the integral becomes ∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx.

Wait, but that can't be right because the original sum S was alternating, so maybe the integral is a positive value.

Wait, let me double-check. The product of (1 + x^{2^n}) equals 1/(1 - x), so the sum of the logs is ln(1/(1 - x)) = -ln(1 -x). So the integral is ∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx.

Wait, but that would be ∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx = ∫_0^1 -ln(1 -x) dx. Let me compute that integral.

Let u = 1 -x. Then, du = -dx. When x=0, u=1; x=1, u=0.

So integral becomes ∫_{u=1}^{u=0} (-ln u) (-du) ) = ∫_1^0 (-ln u) (-du) )

Wait, the substitution: the integral is ∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx. Let me change variable to u = 1 -x. Then, when x=0, u=1; x=1, u=0. dx = -du. So:

∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx = ∫_1^0 (-ln u) (-du) ) = ∫_1^0 (-ln u) (-du) )

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

The integral becomes:

∫ (from u=1 to u=0) [ -ln(u) ] * (-du) )

Which is ∫ (from 1 to 0) [ -ln u ] (-du) )

The (-du) comes from dx = -du, so the integral becomes:

∫_{1}^{0} (-ln u) * (-du) ) = ∫_{1}^{0} ln u du.

But ∫_{1}^{0} ln u du is the same as -∫_{0}^{1} ln u du.

And ∫ ln u du from 0 to1 is known. The integral of ln u is u ln u - u. Evaluated from 0 to1:

At u=1: 1*0 -1 = -1.

At u=0: the limit as u approaches 0 of u ln u - u. u ln u approaches 0, and -u approaches 0. So the lower limit is 0.

So ∫_{0}^{1} ln u du = (-1) - (0) = -1.

So ∫_{1}^{0} ln u du = - (-1) )= 1.

Thus, the integral S is equal to 1.

Wait, so S = 1. But looking back at the options, E is 1.0.

But wait, let me recap to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Wait, the original series S was sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1}/k ] * sum_{n=0}^\infty 1/(k*2^n +1). Then, by switching the order of summation, I expressed S as sum_{n=0}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1}/(k (k*2^n +1)) ].

Then, I converted the 1/(k*2^n +1) term into an integral, leading to S being expressed as an integral over x from 0 to1 of sum_{n=0}^\infty sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (-1)^{k-1} x^{k*2^n} /k ] dx.

The inner sum over k became ln(1 + x^{2^n}), so the sum over n of ln(1 + x^{2^n}) is ln( product (1 + x^{2^n} ) ), which equals ln(1/(1 -x)).

So the integral became ∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx, which evaluated to 1.

So the value of the series S is 1.0, which is option E.

But wait, let me check if I made any miscalculations in the integral. Let me compute ∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx again.

Let me make substitution t = 1 -x, so when x=0, t=1; x=1, t=0. Then, dx = -dt. So:

∫_0^1 (-ln(1 -x)) dx = ∫_{1}^{0} (-ln t) (-dt) ) = ∫_{1}^{0} (-ln t) (-dt) ) = ∫_{1}^{0} ln t dt.

But ∫ ln t dt = t ln t - t. Evaluated from 1 to 0:

At 1: 1*0 -1 = -1.

At 0: the limit as t approaches 0 from the positive side of (t ln t - t). t ln t approaches 0 (since t approaches 0 and ln t approaches -infty, but t approaches zero faster), and -t approaches 0. So the lower limit is 0.

So ∫_{1}^{0} ln t dt = [0] - [ -1 ] = 1.

So yes, the integral is 1. So the series S equals 1, which is option E.

The given series is:

\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k 2^n + 1}.
