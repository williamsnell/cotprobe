Okay, so I've got this question here about glucose-1-phosphate, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question says that glucose-1-phosphate has a molecular weight of 260 g/mole and a density of about 1.5 g/cm³. They're asking for the volume occupied by one molecule. Hmm, right, molecular volume.

Wait, I remember that molecular weight is in grams per mole, and density is mass per volume. So to find the volume of one molecule, I probably need to find the volume of one mole and then divide by Avogadro's number. Yeah, that sounds right.

So the steps I think are: 

1. Calculate the volume of one mole of glucose-1-phosphate. Since density is mass/volume, volume would be mass divided by density. The mass for one mole is the molecular weight, which is 260 grams.

So volume = mass / density = 260 g / 1.5 g/cm³. Let me compute that. 260 divided by 1.5 is... Let's see, 1.5 times 173 is 259.5, so approximately 173.3 cm³ per mole.

2. Then, to find the volume per molecule, divide that volume by Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules per mole.

So volume per molecule = 173.3 cm³/mole / 6.022e23 molecules/mole. Let me calculate that.

173.3 divided by 6.022e23 gives... Let me compute 173.3 / 6.022 first. 173.3 / 6 is about 28.88, but since 6.022 is a bit more than 6, maybe around 28.8? Let me do it more accurately.

6.022 times 28 is 168.616. 6.022 *28.8 = 6.022*(28 + 0.8) = 168.616 + 4.8176 = 173.4336. Oh wait, that's very close to 173.3. So 28.8 is roughly the value. So 28.8 cm³ per molecule times 1e-23, because we're dividing by 1e23. Wait, no, wait: 173.3 cm³ is per mole, and when you divide by 6e23, it's 173.3 / 6e23 = approx 2.89e-22 cm³ per molecule.

Wait, let me double-check. 260 / 1.5 = 173.333... cm³/mol. Then 173.333 / 6.022e23 = ?

Let me compute this more precisely. 173.333 divided by 6.022 is about 28.8. So 28.8 divided by 1e23 is 2.88e-22 cm³/molecule. So looking at the options, option A is 2.9e-22, which would be the right answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, the question says glucose-1-phosphate's molecular weight is 260 g/mol, right. So that's correct.

Another way: molar volume is Mw/density. 260 / 1.5 is about 173.33 cm³/mol. Then, per molecule, divide by Avogadro's number (6.022e23). So 173.33 / 6.022e23 = ?

Alternatively, 173.33 cm³ is 1.7333e2 cm³. So 1.7333e2 / 6.022e23 = (1.7333 / 6.022) * 1e-21. 1.7333/6.022 is approx 0.2878. So 0.2878e-21 is 2.878e-22 cm³, which is 2.88e-22. So option A is 2.9e-22, which matches.

Wait, but let me think again: is the molar volume correctly calculated as molecular weight divided by density? Yes, because density is mass/volume, so volume is mass/density. So for a given mass (molar mass, which is per mole), volume is (g/mol) / (g/cm³) )= cm³/mol. So that's correct.

Another check: typical molecular volumes are on the order of 1e-23 to 1e-22 cm³ per molecule. So 2.9e-22 is within that range. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the volume occupied by one molecule of glucose-1-phosphate, we start by calculating the molar volume. The molecular weight is given as 260 g/mol, and the density is 1.5 g/cm³. Using the relationship:

\[
\text{Volume (per mole)} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{260 \, \text{g/mol}}{1.5 \, \text{g/cm}^3} \approx 173.3 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}.
\]

Next, to find the volume per molecule, we divide the molar volume by Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}\)):

\[
\text{Volume (per molecule)} = \frac{173.3 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}} \approx 2.88 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{molecule}.
\]

This value is closest to option A (\(2.9 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3\)). The calculated result is consistent with typical molecular volumes, which are on the order of \(10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: \(2.9 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{cm}^3\).
