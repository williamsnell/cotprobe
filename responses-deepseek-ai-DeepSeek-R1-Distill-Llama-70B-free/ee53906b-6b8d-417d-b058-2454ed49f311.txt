Okay, so I've got this problem about airflow in a duct, and I need to find the pressure drop per 100 feet. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that pressure drop in ducts is usually calculated using some form of the Darcy-Weisbach equation or maybe the Hazen-Williams equation. But wait, which one applies here? Oh right, for airflow, especially in HVAC applications, I think we often use the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is more general.

The equation I recall is: h_f = (f * L * v^2) / (2 * g * D), where h_f is the head loss, f is the friction factor, L is the length, v is the velocity, g is gravity, and D is the duct diameter. But wait, this is for a circular duct. Our duct here is rectangular, 1x2 feet. Oh right, so we need to find the equivalent diameter for a rectangular duct.

The equivalent diameter (De) is calculated using the cross-sectional area and the perimeter. The formula is De = (4 * A) / P. Let me compute that. The area A is 1 ft * 2 ft = 2 sq ft. The perimeter for a rectangle is 2*(length + width), so 2*(1 + 2) = 6 ft. So De = (4 * 2) / 6 = 8/6 = 1.333... feet, approximately 1.333 ft.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the air. The flow rate is 4800 cfm. Since the cross-sectional area is 2 sq ft, velocity v is Q/A = 4800 / 2 = 2400 ft/min. Wait, but units might be tricky here. Because in the equation, velocity should be in ft/s. So I need to convert that. 2400 ft/min divided by 60 gives 40 ft/s. So v = 40 ft/s.

But wait, what about the air's properties? The problem gives temperature as 75°F and pressure as 14.6 psia. I think I need to calculate the air density. Oh right, because the friction factor might depend on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, but I think for ducts like this, it's usually turbulent.

Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But since we're dealing with air, maybe it's easier to use standard properties. At 75°F, which is about 24°C, and pressure of 14.6 psia. Wait, standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psia, so this is just slightly below atmospheric. So air density should be close to the standard density.

Standard air density at sea level is about 0.076 lbm/ft³, but let me calculate it properly. The specific volume (v) is RT/p, where R is the specific gas constant for air. R for air is about 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R). Wait, but units can get tricky here.

Let me think. The ideal gas equation in English units is PV = nRT, but sometimes it's expressed as P = (ρ R T)/M, where M is the molecular weight. Alternatively, specific volume (v) is given by v = (R T)/P, but R is specific to units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for air density: ρ = (P M) / (R T), where M is the molar mass of air. M for air is about 28.97 lbm/lbmol. R is the universal gas constant, which is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) when using certain units, but wait, I might get confused here.

Alternatively, I can use the density formula in a more straightforward way. At 14.6 psia and 75°F, let's calculate the density.

First, convert temperature to Rankine: 75°F + 459.67 = 534.67 R.

The specific gas constant R for air is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R). But wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me think—if I know that at standard conditions (14.7 psia, 60°F), the density is about 0.076 lbm/ft³. But our temperature is higher (75°F), so density should be lower than standard, and pressure is slightly lower (14.6 vs 14.7), so the effect is a bit lower.

Alternatively, I can compute it precisely. Let's try.

The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Rearranged, density ρ = (PM)/(RT), where M is molar mass, R is the specific gas constant.

Wait, in the correct units, R is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R), M is 28.97 lbm/lbmol. But pressure P is in psia, which is lbf per square inch. So we need to convert units accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

ρ = (P * M) / (R * T)

Where:
P is in psia,
M is molar mass in lbm/lbmol,
R is 10.7316 (ft·lbf)/(lbmol·R), wait no, maybe I'm mixing units here.

Wait, I think the correct value for R in English units is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R). So let's try:

ρ = (P [psia] * M [lbm/lbmol]) ) / (R [ft·lbf/(lbmol·R)] * T [R])

Plugging the numbers:

P = 14.6 psia
M = 28.97 lbm/lbmol
R = 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R)
T = 534.67 R

So ρ = (14.6 * 28.97) / (1716 * 534.67)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 14.6 * 28.97 ≈ 423.362

Denominator: 1716 * 534.67 ≈ Let's compute 1716 * 500 = 858,000, and 1716 * 34.67 ≈ 1716 * 35 is about 60,060. So total denominator ≈ 858,000 + 60,060 = 918,060. So approx 918,000.

So ρ ≈ 423.362 / 918,000 ≈ 0.000461 lbm/ft³. Wait, that can't be right because standard density is about 0.076 lbm/ft³. Hmm, I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should use a different value for R. Because in some sources, R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R). Let me double-check. Oh yes, I think I might have confused lbmol with lbm. Let me clarify.

The specific gas constant R for air is approximately 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R). Because 1716 is per lbmol, but since M is per lbmol, perhaps I should adjust.

Wait, the correct formula when using lbm is ρ = (P M) / (R T), where R is 1716 for lbmol, but since M is lbm per lbmol, perhaps it's better to use R as 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R). Because 1716 divided by 28.97 lbm/lbmol is approximately 1716 / 29 ≈ 59.2, close to 53.35. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for air density as:

Density (lbm/ft³) = (0.00344 * P) / T

Where P is in inches of Hg, but that might not help here. Alternatively, I've seen the formula:

Density = (P [psia] * 0.076) / (14.7) * (460 + temperature in F)/460 + temperature_in_F? Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

Density = (P [psia] * 0.076 lbm/ft³) * (T_std / T_actual)

Where T_std is standard temperature in Rankine, and T_actual is the given temperature.

Wait, let's try that approach. At standard conditions (P=14.7 psia, T=60°F=520 R), density is 0.076 lbm/ft³.

So, density at given conditions (P=14.6 psia, T=75°F=534.67 R) would be:

ρ = 0.076 lbm/ft³ * (14.6 / 14.7) * (520 / 534.67)

Compute each part:

14.6/14.7 ≈ 0.993

520/534.67 ≈ 0.972

Multiply: 0.993 * 0.972 ≈ 0.965

So ρ ≈ 0.076 * 0.965 ≈ 0.0734 lbm/ft³.

Wait, that seems more reasonable.

So air density is approximately 0.0734 lbm/ft³.

Next, I need to calculate the velocity, which I already have as 40 ft/s.

Now, the Darcy-Weisbach equation relates head loss to friction. But since we're dealing with pressure drop, I can write the pressure drop as h_f * specific weight of the fluid.

The specific weight (γ) is ρ * g, where g is 32.2 ft/s².

So γ = 0.0734 lbm/ft³ * 32.2 ft/s² ≈ 2.363 lb/ft²/s², which is 2.363 psf.

Wait, no, psf is pounds per square foot, and specific weight is indeed in lb/ft³ * ft/s² = (lb·s²)/(ft·s²) → lb/ft², which is psf.

So, to find the pressure drop (ΔP), we can compute h_f * γ.

h_f is the head loss, which is (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D), but L is the length.

Wait, but since we're looking for pressure drop per 100 ft, I can set L=100 ft.

So, h_f = (f * 100 * 40²) / (2 * 32.2 * 1.333)

Compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: f * 100 * 1600 = f * 160000

Denominator: 2 * 32.2 * 1.333 ≈ 64.4 * 1.333 ≈ 85.866

So h_f ≈ (f * 160000) / 85.866 ≈ f * 1863.5 ft of head.

Then, the pressure drop ΔP = h_f * γ = (1863.5 * f) * 2.363 psf.

Wait, no, wait. Because h_f is in feet of air, but when multiplied by specific weight (γ), which is psf, we get ΔP in psf.

So ΔP = h_f (ft) * γ (psf/ft) → psf.

So let's compute:

ΔP = (f * 160000 / 85.866) * 2.363

Wait, let me recompute the numbers accurately.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute h_f correctly.

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2 * g * D)

Plugging numbers:

f is the friction factor.

L = 100 ft.

v = 40 ft/s.

g = 32.2 ft/s².

D = 1.333 ft.

So h_f = (f * 100 * 40^2) / (2 * 32.2 * 1.333)

Calculate numerator: f * 100 * 1600 = f * 160,000.

Denominator: 2 * 32.2 = 64.4; 64.4 * 1.333 ≈ 85.866.

So h_f = (f * 160,000) / 85.866 ≈ f * 1863.5 ft.

Now, ΔP = h_f * γ = f * 1863.5 * 2.363 lb/ft².

Wait, 1863.5 ft * 2.363 psf/ft (since γ is 2.363 psf) → psf.

So:

ΔP ≈ f * 1863.5 * 2.363 ≈ f * 4407.3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the values in the options are around 2 psf. So I must have made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Let me double-check.

Flow rate Q is 4800 cfm. Duct area is 1ft * 2ft = 2 ft². So velocity v = Q/A = 4800 / 2 = 2400 ft/min. Oh wait, that's 2400 ft per minute, which is 40 ft/s (since 2400/60 = 40). That part seems right.

Wait, but in the Darcy equation, v is in ft/s, which I have correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the friction factor. Oh wait, the formula I'm using is correct for SI units, but no, in English units, the formula should be correct as is.

Wait, maybe I should compute the Reynolds number to find the friction factor. Because f depends on Re, which is (v * D) / ν.

What's the kinematic viscosity ν of air at 75°F? Let's see. At 60°F, ν is about 0.0000172 ft²/s. At 75°F, it's a bit higher. Let me approximate. Maybe ν ≈ 0.000018 ft²/s.

Reynolds number Re = (v * D) / ν = (40 ft/s * 1.333 ft) / 0.000018 ft²/s.

Compute numerator: 40 * 1.333 ≈ 53.333.

So Re = 53.333 / 0.000018 ≈ 53,333 / 0.18 ≈ approximately 296,296. So Re is around 296,300, which is turbulent flow.

So for a rectangular duct, the friction factor can be approximated using the Colebrook equation or using an approximate formula for turbulent flow. Alternatively, since the duct is rectangular, perhaps the equivalent roughness height is given as K_s = 0.00015 ft. Wait, the problem states that K_s is 0.00015 ft. So this is the roughness factor.

Wait, I think K_s is the roughness height in feet. So with that, I can use the Colebrook-White equation to find f.

The Colebrook equation is 1/√f = 2 log(e) ( (K_s / D) + (1/Re) * (7/(4 log Re - 1)) ) )

Wait, no, the Colebrook equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (K_s/(3.7 D)) + (1/Re) * (7/(4 log Re - 1)) )

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Alternatively, the Moody diagram relates friction factor to Re and relative roughness (K_s/D).

Given that K_s is 0.00015 ft, and D is 1.333 ft, so relative roughness ε = K_s/D = 0.00015 / 1.333 ≈ 0.0001125, which is 0.01125%. That's a very smooth pipe.

At Re around 296,300, and ε ≈ 0.0001125, we can look up f from the Moody diagram. For such a high Re and very low ε, f is in the fully turbulent region, and can be approximated with the formula:

f ≈ 0.0032 + (ε/(3.7 D)) * (1/(Re)^0.5)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the explicit formula for friction factor in turbulent flow:

f = (1/4) * log( (K_s/(3.7 D)) + (1/(Re)) * (7/(4 log Re - 1)) ) )^{-2}

Alternatively, for high Re, f can be approximated using the formula f = 0.25 / (log(Re) - log(ε/(3.7 D) + 5.74/Re))^2 )

But perhaps it's easier to use an approximate value. For very smooth pipes and high Re, f is about 0.016 to 0.02. But let me try to compute it.

Alternatively, use the Swamee-Jain equation, which is an explicit formula for friction factor in all flow regimes.

Swamee-Jain equation:

f = (1/4) * log( ( (ε/D) )^{1.1098} + ( (Re)^{-0.9} ) * 6.9474 ) )^{-2}

Plugging in the numbers:

ε/D = 0.0001125.

Re = 296,300.

Compute each term:

(ε/D)^1.1098 = (0.0001125)^1.1098 ≈ Let's compute ln(0.0001125) = ln(1.125e-4) ≈ -9.13. Multiply by 1.1098: -10.13. Exponentiate: e^-10.13 ≈ 4.24e-5.

(Re)^-0.9 = (296300)^-0.9. Let me compute log(296300)=5.472. Multiply by -0.9: -4.925. So 10^-4.925 ≈ 1.18e-5.

Multiply by 6.9474: 1.18e-5 * 6.9474 ≈ 8.2e-5.

Now, sum the two terms: 4.24e-5 + 8.2e-5 ≈ 1.244e-4.

Take the square root in the log: log(1.244e-4) ≈ log(1.244) + log(1e-4) = 0.0953 -4 = -3.9047.

Now, 1/4 of that is -3.9047 /4 ≈ -0.9762. Then, take the inverse and square it.

Wait, the equation is f = (1/4) * [log(term)]^{-2}.

Wait, more accurately:

f = (1/(4)) * [log( (ε/D)^1.1098 + 6.9474/(Re^0.9) )]^{-2}

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let
