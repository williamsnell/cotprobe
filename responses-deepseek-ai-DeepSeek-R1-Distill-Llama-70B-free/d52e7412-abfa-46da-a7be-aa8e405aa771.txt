Okay, so I have this question about Pence's article "Will Cloning Harm People?" and I need to figure out his main objective. Let's see. I remember that in ethics, there are different theories like Kantian, consequentialist, and virtue ethics. 

Pence's article, from what I recall, discusses cloning and its ethical implications. I think he uses Immanuel Kant's ideas, specifically the humanity formulation of the categorical imperative. Kant's humanity formulation says that we should treat people as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. So if Pence is using this, he's probably looking at whether cloning respects human dignity.

Wait, the question is about his main objective. So the options are about what he's trying to show. Option A says he uses Kant's formulation to show cloning is acceptable. Option E is the opposite, using Kant to show it's immoral.

I think Pence argues that cloning could lead to treating people as commodities or means to an end, which would violate Kant's principle. So that would mean he's against cloning on Kantian grounds. So his main objective would be to show cloning is immoral using Kant's humanity formulation. That points to option E.

Other options: B is about potential benefits, but I don't think that's his main point. C and F are about consequentialism, which is about outcomes. I don't recall Pence focusing on consequences but more on the inherent rightness or wrongness. D is virtue ethics, which I don't think he uses here. G and I are about objecting to certain arguments, but I think he's presenting his own argument rather than objecting. H is neutrality, which doesn't fit. J is consequentialist again but positive, so no.

So the answer should be E.

Pence's main objective in his article "Will Cloning Harm People?" is to use Kant's humanity formulation of the categorical imperative to argue that cloning is immoral. He focuses on the idea that cloning could lead to treating individuals as means to an end, thereby violating human dignity. This aligns with option E, which states that he uses Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is immoral.

Answer: E
