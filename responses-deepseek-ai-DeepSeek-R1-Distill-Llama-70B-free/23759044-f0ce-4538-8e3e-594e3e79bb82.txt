Okay, so I have this question about the Chord protocol, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question states that the identifier space size is 16. So that means each node's identifier is a 4-bit number because 2^4 = 16. The active nodes are N3, N6, N8, and N12. I need to find all the target keys for N6, ignoring its own identifier, and list them in ascending order. Then, pick the correct option from the given choices.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how Chord's routing works, especially regarding the target keys. From what I remember, in Chord, each node has a finger table that contains pointers to other nodes. The finger table for a node N contains entries for intervals that help in routing. The key idea is that each entry in the finger table of N points to the successor of N + 2^i mod 16, where i is the finger index.

So for a node N, the target keys are the next nodes after each power of two steps. But wait, the question is about target keys, which I think are the keys that this node is responsible for. Or maybe it's the keys that N6 would store pointers to in its finger table.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the finger table is structured. For each node, there are log2(m) fingers, where m is the size of the identifier space. Since m is 16, log2(16) is 4, so each node has 4 fingers. Each finger i points to the successor of N + 2^i mod 16.

So for N6, the target keys would be the nodes that N6's fingers point to. Let's compute each of these.

But wait, the active nodes are N3, N6, N8, and N12. So the nodes present in the ring are these four. The identifier space is 0-15, right?

Let me draw the ring. The nodes are arranged in a circle, with identifiers from 0 to 15. The active nodes are at 3,6,8,12.

So their positions on the ring are:
3,6,8,12, then 0,1,2,... up to 15.

Wait, no, 15 is just before 0. So wrapping around. So the order is 0,1,2,3, ...,15.

So the nodes are placed at their IDs. The active nodes are N3, N6, N8, N12. So in the ring, the nodes are at 3,6,8,12.

Now, the finger table for N6. Each finger i (i=0 to 3) points to the successor of N6 + 2^i mod 16.

So let's compute each one:

i=0: 2^0 =1. So N6+1=7. So find the successor of 7. The active nodes are 3,6,8,12. So the successor of 7 would be 8, since 8 is the next node after 7.

So finger 0 points to N8.

i=1: 2^1=2. N6+2=8. The successor of 8 is the next node after 8, which is N12, because after 8 comes 12 in the active nodes.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The nodes are ordered as 3,6,8,12, 0,1, etc., but the active nodes are only those four. So the ring would skip inactive nodes. So the order of active nodes is 3,6,8,12, then wrap around to 3 again.

Wait, no, the ring includes all possible IDs, but only some are active. So when looking for the successor of a key k, we look for the smallest node ID >=k in the active set. If none, then wrap around.

So for key 7: the active nodes are 3,6,8,12. The next node after 7 is 8. So successor is 8.

For key 8: the next node after 8 is 12.

i=2: 2^2=4. N6 +4 =10. So the key is 10. What's the successor of 10? Looking at active nodes, 12 is the next after 10. Because 12 is higher than 10, and the next node after 10 is 12. So finger points to N12.

i=3: 2^3=8. N6+8=14. So key is 14. The successor of 14 is the next node after 14 in the active set. The active nodes are 3,6,8,12. So after 14 comes 3 (since it's a circle). But wait, 14 is followed by 15, then 0,1, etc. But the active nodes are only at 3,6,8,12. So the successor of 14 is 3 because 3 is the first active node after 14 when wrapping around.

Wait, but let me check that. The nodes are ordered from 0 to 15. So the order is 0,1,2,3,...15, and then wraps to 0 again. So for key 14, the next active node after 14 would be 3, because 14 is followed by 15 (inactive), 0 (inactive), 1 (inactive), 2 (inactive), then 3 (active). So yes, the successor is 3, but wait, 3 is less than 14? Wait, no, because when wrapping, the successor is the first node with ID >= key in the circular sense. So for key 14, the nodes are 3,6,8,12,15 (but 15 is inactive?), wait, the active nodes are only 3,6,8,12. So after 14, going clockwise, the next active node is 3. So successor is N3.

But wait, 14 is between 12 and 3, right? Because after 12 comes 13,14,15,0,1,2,3. So in the active set, after 12 is 3. So yes, the successor of 14 is 3.

So for each finger i, the target keys would be:

i=0: 7 → N8
i=1: 8 → N12
i=2:10 → N12
i=3:14 → N3

Wait, but the target keys are the keys we're looking for, not the node IDs. Or wait, no. The target keys are the keys for which the node is responsible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the target keys could be the nodes that N6's fingers point to. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, the question says "target key (in ascending order, ignore the node's identifier itself)". So perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is responsible for, excluding N6's own key. But that doesn't seem to fit with the options.

Alternatively, the target keys could be the keys that N6's fingers point to. So each finger i points to a certain node, which is the target for that finger. So the target keys would be the identifiers of those nodes.

Wait, in Chord, each node's finger table contains pointers to other nodes. The 'target key' for a finger i would be the key that is 2^i steps ahead. But when a lookup is done, the node routes to the finger that is closest but not exceeding the target key.

Alternatively, each finger i represents the key N + 2^i mod 16, and the target is the node whose ID is the successor of that key.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The question is about the target keys for N6. The target keys would be the nodes that N6 routes to. So for each finger, the target is the node that is the successor of N6 + 2^i mod 16.

So N6's fingers would point to the nodes as follows:

Finger 0: successor of 7 → N8
Finger 1: successor of 8 → N12
Finger 2: successor of 10 → N12
Finger 3: successor of 14 → N3

So the target nodes are N8, N12, N12, N3.

Wait, but the target keys are the node identifiers, right? So N8 is 8, N12 is 12, N3 is 3.

So the target keys are 8,12,3.

But each finger has a target. So four fingers, four targets. But some might point to the same node. Let me list them in order.

Wait, the fingers are ordered from i=0 to i=3. So the targets are N8 (i=0), N12 (i=1), N12 (i=2), N3 (i=3).

So the target keys are 8,12,12,3.

But the question says "target key (in ascending order, ignore the node's identifier itself)". So excluding N6's own identifier, which is 6. So we're left with 3,8,12.

Wait, but wait, the finger table for N6 would have four entries, so four target keys. So if we have four targets: 8,12,12,3. But perhaps the question is considering the target keys as the keys that N6 is responsible for, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6's fingers cover. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 is responsible for, which would be the keys from N6's predecessor plus 1 up to N6 itself.

Wait, that's the concept of the keys that a node is responsible for. Each node is responsible for the keys from its predecessor's ID +1 up to its own ID. So for N6, we need to find its predecessor.

Looking at the active nodes in order: 3,6,8,12.

So N6's predecessor is N3. So the keys that N6 is responsible for are from N3 +1 =4 up to N6=6. So keys 4,5,6. But wait, the question is about target keys for N6, which might be a different concept.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try a different approach. The question asks for all the target keys for N6 in ascending order, excluding N6's own identifier.

Wait, perhaps the target keys are the keys that N6 would have in its finger table. Each finger points to a certain node, and the target key for that finger is the key that the finger is responsible for. So for each finger i, the target key is N6 + 2^i mod 16. So these would be the keys that N6 uses to find the next node.

Wait, but the target keys themselves are the keys that N6 uses to route messages. So each finger i's target key is (N6 + 2^i) mod 16. So for each i from 0 to 3, calculate N6 + 2^i mod 16.

So:

i=0: 6+1=7 mod16=7 → target key 7
i=1:6+2=8 →8
i=2:6+4=10 →10
i=3:6+8=14 →14

So the target keys are 7,8,10,14. But wait, the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself, which is 6, so these are the four target keys.

But the answer options don't include these numbers. Wait, the options are:

A: [7,10,13,14]

B: [7,9,12,15]

C: [7,8,10,14]

D: [7,8,12,14]

E: [7,9,11,13]

F: [6,8,10,14]

G: [6,7,9,11]

H: [8,9,11,13]

I: [3,6,8,12]

J: [8,10,12,14]

So option C is [7,8,10,14], which matches exactly the target keys I just calculated.

Wait, but the options are in the form of four numbers. So the correct answer would be option C.

But wait, the question says "target key (in ascending order, ignore the node's identifier itself)". So we list the target keys, sorted, and exclude 6. Since the target keys are 7,8,10,14, that's option C.

So the answer should be C.

In Chord, the identifier space size is 16, meaning node identifiers are 4-bit numbers (0-15). The active nodes are N3, N6, N8, and N12. The task is to determine the target keys for N6, sorted in ascending order, excluding N6's own identifier (6).

In Chord, each node has a finger table with entries corresponding to keys calculated as \( N + 2^i \mod 16 \), where \( i \) is the finger index (0 to 3). For N6:

- **Finger 0**: \( 6 + 2^0 = 7 \), target key is 7.
- **Finger 1**: \( 6 + 2^1 = 8 \), target key is 8.
- **Finger 2**: \( 6 + 2^2 = 10 \), target key is 10.
- **Finger 3**: \( 6 + 2^3 = 14 \), target key is 14.

Thus, the target keys for N6 are 7, 8, 10, and 14. These are already in ascending order, and N6's identifier (6) is excluded as per the question's instructions.

From the given options:

- **A**: [7, 10, 13, 14] → Incorrect, as it includes 13.
- **B**: [7, 9, 12, 15] → Incorrect, as it includes 9, 12, and 15.
- **C**: [7, 8, 10, 14] → Correct, matches the calculated target keys.
- **D**: [7, 8, 12, 14] → Incorrect, as it includes 12.
- **E**: [7, 9, 11, 13] → Incorrect, as it includes 9, 11, and 13.
- **F**: [6, 8, 10, 14] → Incorrect, as it includes 6 (N6's identifier).
- **G**: [6, 7, 9, 11] → Incorrect, as it includes 6, 9, and 11.
- **H**: [8, 9, 11, 13] → Incorrect, as it includes 8, 9, 11, and 13.
- **I**: [3, 6, 8, 12] → Incorrect, as it includes 3, 6, and 12.
- **J**: [8, 10, 12, 14] → Incorrect, as it includes 12.

The correct answer is **C: [7, 8, 10, 14]**.
