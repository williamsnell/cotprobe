Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a survey was done on eight households about how many times their toast was burned in a week. The data collected is: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0. Wait, wait, that's seven numbers. Oh, maybe I miscounted. Let me check: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0 — that's seven data points. But the question says eight households. Hmm, maybe there's a typo or I'm missing something. Oh, maybe the data is correct as given, but perhaps one of the numbers is actually two digits? Let me read it again: 2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0. That's definitely seven numbers. That's confusing. Wait, maybe I should double-check the original question.

Wait, the question says the survey was distributed to eight households, but the results are seven numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count each number: 2 (1), 3 (2), 0 (3), 4 (4), 1 (5), 3 (6), 0 (7). Oh, right, seven data points. So perhaps the question has a typo, but maybe it's correct, and the sample size is seven? Or maybe one of the numbers is a two-digit number that I'm not seeing correctly. No, the numbers are single digits. Hmm, maybe I should proceed, perhaps the question intended seven data points, but the problem states eight households. Well, maybe that's a mistake, but for now, I'll proceed with the given numbers because I can't change the question. So, assuming that the data is correct as given, even if the count doesn't match. So, I have seven data points: 0,0,1,2,3,3,4.

Wait, but the options given include ranges like 4 and 5, so perhaps I should check if I've missed a data point. Let me look again: the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. Oh, that's seven numbers. So the sample size is seven. But the question says eight households. Hmm, perhaps I should note that, but I'll proceed with the seven data points as given.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have a range of 4 and 5. So maybe I should check if I made a mistake. Let me list the data again: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. So the maximum value is 4, and the minimum is 0. So the range is 4 - 0 = 4. So the range is 4. So any option without range 4 can be eliminated. Looking at the options:

Option A: Range 3 → No, because 4-0=4.

Option B: Range 3 → No.

Option C: Range 4 → Possible.

Option D: Range 2 → No.

Option E: Range 4 → Possible.

Option F: Range 5 → No, because max is 4.

Option G: Range 5 → No.

Option H: Range 4 → Possible.

Option I: Range 4 → Possible.

Option J: Range 5 → No.

So now, possible options are C, E, H, I.

Now, moving on to variance and standard deviation.

First, I need to calculate the mean of the dataset.

The data points are: 0,0,1,2,3,3,4.

Wait, wait, the data is as given: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. So when ordered, it's 0,0,1,2,3,3,4.

So the sum is: 0 + 0 +1 +2 +3 +3 +4 = let's add them up.

0+0=0; +1=1; +2=3; +3=6; +3=9; +4=13.

So sum is 13. There are 7 data points, so mean (μ) = 13 / 7 ≈ 1.8571.

Now, to find the variance, I need to compute the average of the squared differences from the mean.

Variance formula for sample data is s² = Σ (x_i - μ)² / (n-1). Wait, but sometimes people calculate population variance, which divides by n. I need to see which one the question is using.

Wait, the question says the data is from a survey of eight households, but we have seven data points. Hmm, maybe it's sample data, so they'd use sample variance, which is divided by (n-1). So for us, n=7, so denominator is 6.

So let's compute each (x_i - μ)^2:

x_i: 0,0,1,2,3,3,4.

Calculations:

0: (0 - 1.8571)^2 ≈ (-1.8571)^2 ≈ 3.449

0: same as above → 3.449

1: (1 - 1.8571)^2 ≈ (-0.8571)^2 ≈ 0.7347

2: (2 - 1.8571)^2 ≈ (0.1429)^2 ≈ 0.0204

3: (3 - 1.8571)^2 ≈ (1.1429)^2 ≈ 1.306

3: same as above → 1.306

4: (4 - 1.8571)^2 ≈ (2.1429)^2 ≈ 4.5918

Now sum all these squared differences:

3.449 + 3.449 = 6.898

+0.7347 = 7.6327

+0.0204 = 7.6531

+1.306 = 8.9591

+1.306 = 10.2651

+4.5918 ≈14.8569

So sum of squares is approximately 14.8569.

Now, variance s² = 14.8569 / (7-1) = 14.8569 /6 ≈ 2.47615.

So variance is approximately 2.476, which is about 2.48.

Standard deviation is the square root of variance, so sqrt(2.476) ≈ 1.573.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Variance: 14.8569 /6 = 2.47615.

sqrt(2.47615) is about 1.573.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: Variance 2.2, SD ~1.483 → No, our variance is higher.

Option E: Variance 2, SD 1.414 → Our variance is ~2.48, so no.

Option H: Variance 1.5, SD 1.225 → No, lower.

Option I: Variance 3, SD 1.732 → Higher than ours.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match, but let me check my calculations again because perhaps I made an error.

Wait, perhaps the question treats the data as a population, not a sample. So maybe they're using population variance, which is sum of squares divided by n, not n-1.

In that case, for our data, sum of squares is 14.8569, divided by 7 → 2.1224. So variance would be approximately 2.1224. Then standard deviation is sqrt(2.1224) ≈ 1.456.

But looking at the options, none of the options with range 4 have variance around 2.12. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

C: Range 4, Variance 2.2, SD 1.483 → Maybe close to 2.1224.

E: Range 4, Variance 2, SD 1.414.

H: Range 4, Variance 1.5, SD 1.225.

I: Range 4, Variance 3, SD 1.732.

So if I consider that perhaps the question is using population variance (divided by n), then variance is ~2.12, which is closest to 2.2 in option C. But 2.12 is closer to 2 than 2.2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum of squares more accurately.

Compute each (x_i - μ)^2 precisely.

μ = 13/7 ≈ 1.857142857.

Compute each term:

x=0: (0 - 1.857142857)^2 = ( -1.857142857 )^2 = 3.449387755

x=0: same as above → 3.449387755

x=1: (1 - 1.857142857)^2 = (-0.857142857)^2 ≈ 0.734694579

x=2: (2 - 1.857142857)^2 = (0.142857143)^2 ≈ 0.020408163

x=3: (3 - 1.857142857)^2 = (1.142857143)^2 ≈ 1.306122449

x=3: same as above → 1.306122449

x=4: (4 - 1.857142857)^2 = (2.142857143)^2 ≈ 4.591836735

Now, adding all these up:

3.449387755 + 3.449387755 = 6.89877551

+0.734694579 = 7.63347009

+0.020408163 = 7.65387825

+1.306122449 = 8.9600007

+1.306122449 = 10.26612315

+4.591836735 = 14.85795988

So sum of squares is approximately 14.85796.

If using sample variance (divided by 6):

14.85796 /6 ≈ 2.476493.

Variance ≈ 2.4765, standard deviation ≈ sqrt(2.4765) ≈ 1.5735.

Looking at the options, none have variance around 2.476. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option B: Range 3, variance 2.5, SD 1.581.

But our range is 4, so option B is out.

Option J: Range 5, variance 2.5, SD 1.581. But range is 4, so not J.

Option E: Range 4, variance 2, SD 1.414.

Hmm, perhaps the question uses a different approach. Wait, maybe I should check if the data includes an 8th data point that I'm missing. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait, the data given is: 2, 3, 0,4,1,3,0. That's seven numbers. But the question says eight households. So perhaps the data was meant to have an 8th value, maybe a typo. Let me check the question again.

The question says: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. Let me count: 2 (1),3(2),0(3),4(4),1(5),3(6),0(7). So seven data points. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed as if n=7, even though the question says eight households. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a number.

Wait, perhaps the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0, and perhaps another number not listed. But the way it's written, it's seven numbers. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed with n=7.

Alternatively, perhaps the last number is 0, and the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0, making seven numbers. So n=7.

Wait, maybe I can try to see if any of the options fit with n=7.

Looking back, the possible options are C, E, H, I.

But none of them have variance around 2.476, which is what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial data. Let me recount the data points.

Wait, the data is given as: "2, 3, 0, 4, 1, 3, 0".

Wait, that's seven numbers. So n=7.

But in the options, option E has variance 2, which is close to our population variance of ~2.12.

Wait, perhaps the question considers this as a population, not a sample. So variance = sum of squares /n = 14.85796 /7 ≈2.1224.

Standard deviation is sqrt(2.1224) ≈1.456.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Variance 2, SD 1.414. Hmm, 1.414 is sqrt(2), so that's variance 2.

Our calculated population variance is ~2.12, which is closer to 2.2 than to 2. So option C has variance 2.2, SD ~1.483.

But none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I miscalculated the sum of squares.

Wait, let me recompute the sum of squares accurately.

Calculating each term:

x=0: (0 - 13/7)^2 = ( -13/7 )^2 = (169)/(49) ≈3.449.

x=0: same as above.

x=1: (1 -13/7)^2 = (-6/7)^2 = 36/49 ≈0.7347.

x=2: (2 -13/7)^2 = ( (14/7 -13/7) )^2 = (1/7)^2 = 1/49 ≈0.0204.

x=3: (3 -13/7)^2 = ( (21/7 -13/7) )^2 = (8/7)^2 =64/49≈1.3061.

x=3: same as above.

x=4: (4 -13/7)^2 = (28/7 -13/7)=15/7 → (15/7)^2=225/49≈4.5918.

Sum of squares: 3.449*2 +0.7347 +0.0204 +1.3061*2 +4.5918.

So:

3.449 *2 =6.898

0.7347 +0.0204 =0.7551

1.3061 *2=2.6122

Add all together: 6.898 + 0.7551=7.6531 +2.6122=10.2653 +4.5918=14.8571.

So sum of squares is 14.8571.

Population variance: 14.8571 /7 ≈2.1224.

Sample variance: 14.8571 /6 ≈2.4762.

So, if the question is treating this as a sample, variance is ~2.476, which is approximately 2.5. Looking back at the options:

Option B: Range 3, variance 2.5, SD 1.581. But our range is 4, so option B is invalid.

Wait, looking for options with range 4 and variance near 2.476. But looking at the options, the closest is option C: variance 2.2, but that's lower than our sample variance.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the range. Let me double-check.

The data points are 0,0,1,2,3,3,4. So maximum is 4, minimum is 0. Range is 4-0=4. So range is definitely 4.

So, looking again at the options, only options C, E, H, I have range 4.

Now, if the variance is approximately 2.476 (sample variance), none of the options have that value. The closest is option B which has 2.5 but wrong range.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using population variance, so 2.1224, which is closer to 2.2 in option C.

Option C says variance 2.2, SD 1.483.

But let me compute sqrt(2.2) → approximately 1.4832, which matches option C's SD.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the data might have an 8th value, which I'm missing. Because the question states eight households, but the data only shows seven numbers. Maybe I miscounted.

Let me look again: the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0. That's seven numbers. Maybe the intended data includes an 8th number, perhaps a 2, making the data: 2,3,0,4,1,3,0,2. Let me check if that's possible.

Wait, if the data is 2,3,0,4,1,3,0,2 → that's eight numbers. Let me recalculate with n=8.

So, the data points would be:0,0,1,2,2,3,3,4.

Sum: 0+0+1+2+2+3+3+4=15.

Mean μ=15/8=1.875.

Now, calculate the sum of squares:

Each (x_i -1.875)^2.

x=0: ( -1.875 )^2 =3.515625

x=0: same →3.515625

x=1: ( -0.875 )^2=0.765625

x=2: (0.125)^2=0.015625

x=2: same →0.015625

x=3: (1.125)^2=1.265625

x=3: same →1.265625

x=4: (2.125)^2=4.515625

Sum all these:

3.515625 *2 =7.03125

0.765625 

0.015625 *2=0.03125

1.265625 *2=2.53125

4.515625

Adding up:

7.03125 +0.765625 =7.796875

+0.03125 =7.828125

+2.53125 =10.359375

+4.515625 =14.875.

Sum of squares=14.875.

If n=8, population variance is 14.875/8=1.859375.

Sample variance would be 14.875/(8-1)=14.875/7≈2.125.

So, sample variance ~2.
