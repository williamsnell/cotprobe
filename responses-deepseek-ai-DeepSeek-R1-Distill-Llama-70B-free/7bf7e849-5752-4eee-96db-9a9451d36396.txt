Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question about future interests. It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. 

The problem says a grantor conveyed an apartment building for a dollar, and the deed has a specific structure. The conveyance is to the grantor's son for life, then to his uncle for life. But there's a condition: if the uncle moves to another state, it goes to the brother for the life of the uncle. After that, it goes to the uncle's heirs if he doesn't move, or the brother's heirs if he does move. The question is about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime.

First, I need to break down the deed's language. The son gets a life estate. Then, the uncle gets a life estate, but with a condition. If the uncle moves, it switches to the brother for the uncle's life. So, the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving. 

The key here is to figure out what kind of future interest the brother has. The brother's interest only comes into play if the uncle moves. So it's conditional. Also, the interest is measured by the uncle's life, which suggests it's a life estate pur autre vie.

Wait, future interests can be remainders or executory interests. Remainders take effect immediately upon the termination of the prior estate, while executory interests cut short a prior estate. Here, if the condition is met (uncle moves), it goes to the brother, which replaces the uncle's interest. So that sounds like an executory interest because it's cutting short the uncle's life estate.

So the brother has an executory interest. Now, is it contingent? Yes, because it only happens if the uncle moves. So it's a contingent executory interest. Also, it's pur autre vie because it's measured by the uncle's life, not the brother's.

Looking at the options, option G is a contingent executory interest pur autre vie. That seems to fit. Option D is a shifting executory interest pur autre vie, but shifting usually applies when the interest shifts between two parties, not necessarily contingent on an event. Here, it's contingent on the uncle moving, so it's a contingent, not shifting, executory interest.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Shifting executory interests occur when a prior interest is divested upon a contingency, and it's followed by another executory interest. Contingent means it's subject to a condition precedent. So in this case, the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving, which makes it a contingent executory interest, not shifting. So option G is correct.

Alternatively, maybe option D is shifting because if the condition happens, it shifts from uncle to brother. But no, shifting is more about when the interest automatically moves between two alternatives without a condition precedent. Here, it's a condition that must be met for it to happen. So it's contingent, not shifting.

So the brother's interest is a contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

The grantor's deed creates a life estate for the son, followed by a life estate for the uncle, with a condition that if the uncle moves to another state, the interest shifts to the brother for the uncle's life. The brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving, making it a contingent executory interest. Since the interest is measured by the uncle's life, it is pur autre vie. 

Analyzing the options, a shifting executory interest (option D) occurs when an interest automatically shifts between two parties without a condition precedent, which is not the case here. Instead, the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving, making it a contingent executory interest pur autre vie (option G). 

The correct answer is:

G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

Answer: G
