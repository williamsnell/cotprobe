Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here with two statements, and I need to figure out if each is true or false. Let's take it step by step.

First, Statement 1: "If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected." Hmm. I remember something about topology, specifically connectedness and closures. So, connectedness is a property where a space can't be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets. The closure of a set A is the smallest closed set containing A, which includes all the limit points of A.

Wait, does taking the closure preserve connectedness? I think so. Because if A is connected, adding limit points shouldn't make it disconnected. Like, imagine an open interval (0,1) in the real line. Its closure is [0,1], which is definitely connected. Or another example: consider a connected subset in a space. Adding the boundary points (which is what closure does) should keep it in one piece. So Statement 1 might be true.

Now, Statement 2: "Every continuous function f : (0, 1) → (0, 1) has a fixed point." Fixed point means there's some x where f(x) = x. I remember the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, which says that any continuous function from a convex compact subset of Euclidean space to itself has a fixed point. But wait, (0,1) is not compact—it's open. So Brouwer doesn't apply here. 

Oh wait, there's another theorem. The Intermediate Value Theorem might help here. Let me think. If f is continuous on (0,1), then consider the function g(x) = f(x) - x. If there's a point where g(x)=0, that's a fixed point. But since (0,1) is open, we can't directly apply IVT without considering the endpoints. 

Wait, but what if f is such that f(x) is always less than x? Like f(x) = x/2. Then g(x) = -x/2, which is always negative. So no fixed point. So such a function doesn't have a fixed point. Therefore, Statement 2 is false. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: consider the function f: (0,1) → (0,1) defined by f(x) = x + 1/2. Wait, no, that's not possible because if x is near 1, x + 1/2 would exceed 1. So maybe that function isn't valid. Let me pick a function that maps (0,1) into (0,1). Hmm, perhaps f(x) = x^2. Then for x in (0,1), f(x) is between 0 and 1. Does this have a fixed point? Let's see, x^2 = x → x=0 or x=1. But 0 and 1 are not in the open interval (0,1). So no fixed points. So this function also doesn't have a fixed point. Thus, Statement 2 is definitely false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Wait, looking back at the options, let me check.

Wait, the options are from A to J, each being a pair of truth values for the statements.

Looking at the options:

Option F is True, True. So that's not it.

Option G is True, False. That fits our conclusion.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement 1 is true. So the first part is true, the second is false. So the answer should be G.

Wait, let me double-check Statement 1. Is the closure of a connected set always connected? I think yes. Because the closure can be obtained by adding limit points, but the connectedness is preserved. For example, in a metric space, the closure of a connected set is connected. I've read that before. So yes, Statement 1 is true.

Statement 1: "If \( A \) is connected, the closure of \( A \) must be connected."  
This is true. Connectedness is preserved under closure because adding limit points to a connected set does not make it disconnected. For example, the closure of an open interval \((0, 1)\) is \([0, 1]\), which remains connected. Thus, Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: "Every continuous function \( f : (0, 1) \to (0, 1) \) has a fixed point."  
This is false. While the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem applies to compact spaces, \((0, 1)\) is not compact. Counterexamples exist, such as \( f(x) = x^2 \), which maps \((0, 1)\) into itself but has no fixed points in \((0, 1)\). Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Considering the options, the correct choice is **G: True, False**.
