Question:

Today Susan took a pill for her allergy that raised her blood pressure, caused her heart to beat faster, and raised her body temperature. Now caught in traffic, she feels angry. Yesterday, when she took the pill, she was with her husband. When her blood pressure rose, her heart speeded up, she got hotter, and she felt amorous. This description exemplifies

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about Susan taking a pill that affects her blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. Then, depending on her situation, she feels different emotions. Yesterday, when she took the pill and was with her husband, she felt amorous. Today, stuck in traffic, she feels angry. The question is asking which theory this exemplifies.

Hmm, I remember that various theories explain how emotions work. Let me think about the options given.

Option A is the two-factor theory. I think that's the one where both physiological arousal and a cognitive label are needed to experience emotion. So the same physical symptoms can lead to different emotions based on the context. That sounds relevant here because Susan's physical state is the same but her emotions differ based on where she is.

Option B is incentive theory, which is more about motivation being driven by rewards or incentives. Not sure it fits here.

Option C, opponent-process theory, deals with how emotions have opposing processes, like excitement vs. boredom. Maybe not directly related to the context determining emotion.

Option D, adaptation-level phenomenon, relates to how we adapt to stimuli and judge things relative to what we're used to. Doesn't seem to fit the scenario.

Option E is cognitive dissonance, which is about conflicting thoughts causing discomfort. Not directly about emotion from arousal.

Option F is arousal theory. I think that's part of theories about motivation, like how people have optimal arousal levels. Maybe not exactly this.

Option G is Cannon-Bard theory. If I recall, this theory suggests that emotions result from the simultaneous occurrence of physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal. Wait, so both the physical response and the cognitive interpretation happen at the same time. But in the scenario, Susan's physical responses are the same, but the emotion changes based on context, which is more about how she labels the arousal.

Option H is cognitive appraisal theory. This states that emotions are based on how we appraise or interpret a situation. So the same arousal can lead to different emotions based on how you think about it. That fits because Susan's environment changed her appraisal.

Option I is James-Lange theory, which says that emotions result from physiological responses. So you feel sorry because you cry, not cry because you feel sorry. But in this case, the same physiological response leads to different emotions, which might not be explained by just the physical response.

Option J is drive-reduction theory, which is about reducing physiological needs. Doesn't seem related here.

So the scenario shows that the same physiological arousal (from the pill) is interpreted differently depending on the context. Yesterday with her husband, she felt amorous; today in traffic, angry. So it's about how the cognitive label or appraisal of the same arousal leads to different emotions.

Two-factor theory (A) says that emotion is the result of both physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. So Susan's body state is the same, but her cognitive labeling depends on where she is and what's happening, leading to different emotions.

Wait, but cognitive appraisal theory (H) also involves how we interpret situations. So how are A and H different?

Two-factor theory (A) by Schachter says that when you're aroused, you look for a reason why you're feeling that way, and that's how you label the emotion. So the same arousal can lead to different emotions based on the context or available labels.

Cognitive appraisal theory (H), like Lazarus's, suggests that the appraisal of the situation determines the emotion. It's more about the evaluation of the situation as the primary factor.

In this case, Susan's arousal is the same, but her situation changes. So she appraises her internal state differently based on context. That sounds like both could fit, but I think two-factor theory specifically talks about the combination of arousal and labeling. So the question is about how the same physiological state leads to different emotions based on the cognitive context.

So the correct answer should be A: two-factor theory.

The question describes a scenario where Susan experiences the same physiological responses (increased blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) due to a pill, but her emotional response differs based on the context: feeling amorous when with her husband and angry while stuck in traffic. This illustrates how the same physiological arousal can lead to different emotions depending on cognitive labeling or appraisal.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Two-factor theory**: This theory posits that emotion arises from the combination of physiological arousal and cognitive labeling. Susanâ€™s physiological state is consistent, but her emotional experience changes based on her cognitive interpretation of the situation, making this theory highly relevant.  
- **H: Cognitive Appraisal theory**: This theory suggests that emotions are determined by how we appraise or interpret a situation. While related, it focuses more on the appraisal of the situation itself rather than the interaction between arousal and labeling.  

The scenario aligns most closely with the two-factor theory, as it emphasizes the role of cognitive labeling in determining the emotion experienced during physiological arousal.
