Okay, so I've got this question about a goddess called the Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach. I'm not too familiar with this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking where people believed in this specific goddess. The options are China, Silla, Goguryeo, or Joseon. Hmm, I remember that Silla, Goguryeo, and Joseon are all historical Korean kingdoms or dynasties. China is a country, so that's a bit broader.

I think the Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach might be related to Korean mythology. Wait, I've heard something about a mountain called Mount Geumgang, which is in Korea. Fairy Peach, or maybe something like that. Oh, right! I think there's a mountain called Geumgangsan, which is sometimes translated as "Mount Kumgang" or "Diamond Mountain." But the name Fairy Peach is new to me, so maybe it's a different translation or a specific term.

I recall that in Korean folklore, there are stories about mountain spirits and goddesses. One such figure is the Holy Mother of Mount Geumgang. So if the question mentions Fairy Peach, perhaps that's a different name for the same mountain or a nearby area. Or maybe it's a specific title for the goddess associated with that mountain.

Now, considering the historical periods. Silla was one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, along with Goguryeo and Baekje. Joseon was a later dynasty that came after the Goryeo period. So if the belief in this goddess was prevalent during the Silla period, that would point to option B.

Alternatively, Goguryeo was another kingdom, known for its military prowess, but I'm not sure if they specifically worshipped this particular goddess. Joseon was more Confucian, so maybe less focused on such deities, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the Holy Mother of Mount Geumgang is a figure from the Silla period. Mount Geumgang is in what's now North Korea, but during Silla times, it was part of their territory. So the people of Silla would have believed in her as a protector or a significant deity.

So putting it together, the answer is probably B: Silla.

The question asks about the origin of belief in the Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach. Considering the options—China, Silla, Goguryeo, and Joseon—it's important to note that Silla, Goguryeo, and Joseon are historical Korean kingdoms, while China is a broader entity. The Holy Mother of Mount Fairy Peach is likely associated with Korean mythology, specifically linked to Mount Geumgang (also known as Mount Kumgang), a significant site in Korean folklore. This figure is particularly connected to the Silla period, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, where the mountain was within Silla's territory. Therefore, the belief in this goddess is most closely tied to Silla.

Answer: B
