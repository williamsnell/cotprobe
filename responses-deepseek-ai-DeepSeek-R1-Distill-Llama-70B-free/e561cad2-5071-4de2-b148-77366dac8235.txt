Okay, so I've got this problem here about estimating the pressure exerted by carbon monoxide (CO) under certain conditions using three different equations of state: the ideal gas, van der Waals, and Redlich-Kwong. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The problem gives me 8.2 pounds of CO in a 1 cubic foot container at -78°F. I remember that in these kinds of problems, the first thing to do is convert all the units to SI units because the gas laws typically use those. Wait, but looking at the options, they're in psia and atm, so maybe it's okay to work in imperial units. Not sure, but I'll proceed carefully.

First, I need to find the pressure using each equation. Let's start with the ideal gas equation because that's the simplest.

Ideal Gas Equation: PV = nRT

I need to find the pressure P. So I'll rearrange the equation to P = nRT/V.

But wait, I need to make sure all the units are compatible. Let's think about the units involved.

The mass of CO is 8.2 lb. I need to find the number of moles, n. Molar mass of CO is about 28 g/mol because carbon is 12 and oxygen is 16, so 12+16=28. So 28 grams per mole.

Wait, 8.2 lb is the mass. Let me convert that to grams. 1 lb is 453.592 grams, so 8.2 lb * 453.592 g/lb = let's calculate that. 8 * 453.592 is 3628.736, and 0.2 * 453.592 is 90.7184, so total is approximately 3719.454 g.

Now moles n = mass / molar mass = 3719.454 g / 28 g/mol ≈ 132.82 moles.

Next, the volume V is 1 cubic foot. I need to convert that to cubic meters because R is usually in terms of m³. Wait, but if I use R in units that match, maybe I can avoid converting. Let me think: in imperial units, sometimes R is given as 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·R·mol). Or wait, another value I remember is R = 0.7302 atm·ft³/(mol·R). Wait, I'm not sure. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, I could convert the volume to liters. 1 cubic foot is about 28.3168 liters. Wait, but maybe it's easier to work in the unit system that matches the gas constant.

Wait, perhaps I should just convert all the units to SI. So V = 1 ft³ = 0.028317 m³.

The temperature is given as -78°F. I need to convert that to Kelvin. Let's see: first convert to Celsius. So, -78°F is equal to what in Celsius? I remember that the formula is (°F - 32) × 5/9 = °C. So (-78 -32) = -110, multiplied by 5/9: -110 * 5 = -550, /9 ≈ -61.11°C. Then, add 273.15 to get Kelvin: 273.15 -61.11 = 212.04 K.

Now, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So putting it all into the ideal gas equation:

P = nRT/V.

n is 132.82 mol, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is 212.04 K, V is 0.028317 m³.

So let's compute numerator first: 132.82 * 8.314 * 212.04.

Wait, let me compute step by step:

First, 132.82 * 8.314 = approximately 132.82 *8 is 1062.56, 132.82 *0.314≈41.71. So total ≈ 1062.56 +41.71=1104.27.

Then multiply by 212.04: 1104.27 * 200 = 220,854, and 1104.27 *12.04 ≈ 13,300. So total ≈ 220,854 +13,300 ≈ 234,154 J.

Wait, but J is N·m, so when we divide by volume in m³, P would be in N/m², which is pascals. So P = 234154 / 0.028317 ≈ let's compute that.

0.028317 is approximately 0.0283. So 234154 / 0.0283 ≈ 234154 * 35.3 ≈ Wait, 1/0.0283≈35.3.

So 234,154 * 35.3 ≈ Let me compute 234,154 *35 first: 234,154 * 30=7,024,620; 234,154 *5=1,170,770. So 7,024,620 +1,170,770 = 8,195,390. Then, 234,154 *0.3=70,246.2. So total ≈ 8,195,390 +70,246.2 ≈8,265,636 Pa.

Convert pascals to atmospheres because the options are in atm. 1 atm = 101325 Pa. So 8,265,636 /101325 ≈ let's compute that.

101325 * 81 = 8,202, 325. Hmm, 81 *101325= 8,207, 325? Wait, 100,000 *81=8,100,000, 1,325*81≈107,325, so total ≈8,207,325. Which is close to the computed 8,265,636. So 81.5 or so. Let's compute 8,265,636 /101325 ≈81.5 atm.

Wait, but that's in SI units. The pressure I'm getting is around 81.5 atm. Looking at the options, option H says 1200 psia = 81.7 atm. Oh wait, but wait. 81.5 is the value, so that would correspond to the ideal gas part.

Wait, but the options list each option as three values: the first is psia, the next two are atm. Like option A is 1500psia=102.0 atm, then 88.9 atm and 92.4 atm for the other equations.

So for part (a), the ideal gas, I'm getting about 81.5 atm. Looking at the options, which option's first atm value is near 81.5? Option H is 1200 psia →81.7 atm. That's very close. So for part (a), the value is ~81.5 atm, which aligns with option H's 81.7 atm.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with unit conversions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting the temperature. Let me recalculate that.

-78°F to Celsius: (-78 -32) = -110°F. Multiply by 5/9: (-110 *5)/9 = (-550)/9 ≈ -61.11°C. Then Kelvin is 273.15 + (-61.11) = 212.04 K. That's correct.

n = mass/molar mass. 8.2 lb is 8.2 *453.592 = 3719.45 g. Divided by 28 g/mol gives 132.82 mol. That seems right.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). V is 1 ft³ = 0.028317 m³. So nRT/V = 132.82 *8.314 *212.04 /0.028317.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator: 132.82 *8.314 is approx 132.82 *8=1062.56, 132.82 *0.314≈41.71. So total 1062.56 +41.71=1104.27 J/mol·K * K → J/mol.

Then multiply by 212.04 K: 1104.27 *212.04. Let me compute 1104 *212. Let's compute 1000*212=212,000. 104*212: 200*104=20,800; 12*104=1,248 → total 22,048. So 212,000 +22,048=234,048. Then plus 0.27 *212.04 ≈57.15, so total ≈234,105.15.

Divide by V=0.028317 m³: 234105.15 /0.028317 ≈8,270,000 Pa. Wait, 0.028317 *8,270,000 → 0.028317 *8e6=226,536. 0.028317*270,000≈7,645.6. So total about 234,181.6, which matches the numerator. So 8,270,000 Pa.

Convert to atm: 8270000 /101325 ≈81.5 atm. So yes, that's correct.

So part (a) is about 81.5 atm, which matches option H's first part: 1200 psia=81.7 atm. So for the ideal gas, option H would be the one. But wait, let's look at the other equations.

But the question is part (a), (b), (c), so each option gives three pressures: the first is psia, then the ideal atm, van der Waals atm, and Redlich-Kwong atm? Wait no, looking at the options, for example, option A says 1500psia=102.0 atm, 88.9 atm, 92.4 atm. So I think the first number is the pressure in psia, and the next two are the pressures according to van der Waals and Redlich-Kwong in atm.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, each option gives the three parts (a, b, c) as (psia, atm, atm). So for option A, (a) is 1500 psia which converts to 102.0 atm, (b) is 88.9 atm, (c) 92.4 atm.

Wait, perhaps I should process all the options, but perhaps it's easier to compute each part.

So for part (a), I have about 81.5 atm, which is very close to option H's (a) part: 1200 psia=81.7 atm.

So then, for the other parts, (b) van der Waals and (c) Redlich-Kwong, I need to compute their respective pressures.

Van der Waals equation is (P + a(n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT.

Redlich-Kwong equation is P = (RT)/(V-b) - a/(T^0.5 V(V+b)).

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact forms, but I think that's correct.

First, I need the van der Waals constants a and b for CO. I think for CO, a is 3.649 atm·L²/mol² and b is 0.04267 L/mol. Wait, but I should confirm.

Alternatively, I can look up the van der Waals constants. Let me recall: for CO, a = 3.649 L²·atm/mol² and b = 0.04267 L/mol.

Wait, but I'm working in SI units, so perhaps I need to convert a and b to m³ and m³·Pa.

Wait, 1 L = 0.001 m³. So b would be 0.04267 L/mol → 0.04267e-3 m³/mol.

Similarly, a is in (atm·L²)/mol². Since 1 atm = 101325 Pa, a =3.649 *101325 (Pa) * (0.001 m³)^2 / mol² → 3.649 *101325 *1e-6 m³²/(mol²·Pa). Wait, no, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, a in van der Waals equation in SI units would be in Pa·m^6/mol².

Because, the equation is (P + a (n²/V²)) (V/n - b) = RT. So the units of a would be (Pa)(m^6)/(mol²). So the conversion from L²·atm/(mol²) to Pa·m^6/mol² is:

a_SI = a * (1 atm) * (1 L)^2 / (1 m^3)^2 * (1 m^3)^2 / (1 L)^2) Hmm, perhaps better to compute the value.

Given a in L²·atm/mol² → to convert to m³·Pa/mol².

1 L = 0.001 m³ → 1 L² = 1e-6 m^6.

1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So a_SI = a *101325 Pa *1e-6 m^6 / mol².

So for a =3.649 L²·atm/mol²,

a_SI =3.649 *101325 *1e-6 = Let's compute that: 3.649 *101325 ≈369, 000? Wait, 3.649 *100,000 is 364,900, plus 3.649 *1325 ≈4,839. So total ≈369,739. Then multiply by 1e-6 → 0.369739 m³·Pa/mol².

Wait, that seems correct.

Similarly, b_SI = 0.04267 L/mol → 0.04267e-3 m³/mol.

So, n is 132.82 mol, V is 0.028317 m³.

Now, applying van der Waals equation:

P + a (n/V)^2 = [RT]/(V/n - b)

So let's compute each part.

Compute V/n: 0.028317 m³ /132.82 mol ≈ 0.00021315 m³/mol.

Then, V/n - b = 0.00021315 - 0.04267e-3 = 0.00021315 - 0.00004267 = 0.00017048 m³/mol.

Now RT: R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is 212.04 K.

RT =8.314 *212.04 ≈ 1764.3 J/mol → 1764.3 N·m/mol.

So [RT]/(V/n - b) =1764.3 /0.00017048 ≈1764.3 /0.00017048 → Let me compute 1764.3 / 0.00017048.

Hmm, 0.00017048 is 1.7048e-4. So 1764.3 / 1.7048e-4 ≈ (1764.3 /1.7048) *1e4 → approximately 1035 *1e4 → 1.035e7 Pa.

Wait, 1764.3 divided by 0.00017048 → same as 1764.3 * (1/0.00017048) → 1/0.00017048 ≈5882. So 1764.3 *5882 ≈10,395,000 Pa → about 1.0395e7 Pa.

Then, the term a (n/V)^2: a_SI is 0.369739 m³·Pa/mol², (n/V)^2 is (132.82 /0.028317)^2 = (approx 4688.7 mol/m³)^2 → (4688.7)^2 ≈2.196e7 mol²/m^6.

So a (n/V)^2 =0.369739 *2.196e7 → let's compute 0.369739 *2.196e7 → approximately 0.369739 *2.196 ≈0.811, so 0.811e7 Pa →8.11e6 Pa.

So P = [RT/(V/n -b)] - a(n/V)^2 → 1.0395e7 Pa -8.11e6 Pa ≈2.594e6 Pa.

Convert that to atm: 2,594,000 Pa /101325 ≈25.6 atm.

Wait, that's way lower than the ideal gas value. That can't be right because CO is a real gas, and at these conditions (low temperature), the van der Waals equation might predict lower pressure than ideal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should try to compute more accurately.

Wait, let me recompute [RT/(V/n - b)].

V/n =0.028317 m³ /132.82 mol → let me compute that:

0.028317 /132.82 → let's compute 132.82 goes into 0.028317 how many times. 0.028317 /132.82 ≈0.00021315 m³/mol.

V/n -b =0.00021315 -0.00004267 =0.00017048 m³/mol.

RT=8.314 *212.04 = let's compute it precisely.

8 *212.04=1696.32,

0.314 *212.04 ≈66.55.

Total RT≈1696.32+66.55≈1762.87 J/mol.

So [RT]/(V/n -b) =1762.87 /0.00017048 → compute this division.

1762.87 /0.00017048 → same as 1762.87 * (1/0.00017048) → 1/0.00017048≈5870. So 1762.87 *5870 ≈1.035e7 Pa.

Now, a(n/V)^2.

n/V =132.82 /0.028317 ≈4688.7 mol/m³.

So (n/V)^2≈(4688.7)^2 → compute that. 4000^2=16,000,000, 688.7^2≈473,000, and cross terms 2*4000*688.7≈5,509,600 → total ≈16e6 +5.5096e6 +0.473e6 ≈21.9826e6 mol²/m^6.

So a*(n/V)^2 =0.369739 *21.9826e6 →0.369739 *2.19826e7 → let's compute 0.369739*2.19826e7.

0.369739 *2.19826e7 = ?

0.369739 *21,982,600 → approximately 0.369739 *2.198e7
