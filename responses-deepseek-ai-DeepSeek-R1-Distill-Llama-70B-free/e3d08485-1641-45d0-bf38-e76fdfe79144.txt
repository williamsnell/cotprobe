Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a parallel-plate capacitor. Hmm, I remember that capacitors store electric charge and energy. Let me think about the formulas I'll need for this.

The problem has four parts: finding the capacitance, the charge, the energy stored, and the force between the plates. Let's tackle them one by one.

First, the capacitance. The formula for a parallel-plate capacitor is C = ε₀ * (A/d), where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, A is the area of the plates, and d is the separation between them. Oh right, ε₀ is approximately 8.85 × 10^-12 F/m. 

Wait, the plates are 20 cm square, so each plate is a square with sides 20 cm. Oh, I should convert that to meters. 20 cm is 0.2 meters. So the area A is 0.2 m * 0.2 m = 0.04 m². The separation d is 0.5 cm, which is 0.005 meters.

Plugging into the formula: C = (8.85e-12 F/m) * (0.04 m²) / 0.005 m. Let me calculate that. 0.04 divided by 0.005 is 8. So 8.85e-12 * 8 = 7.08e-11 Farads. Oh wait, because 8.85e-12 times 8 is 7.08e-11, right? Because 8.85 *8 is 70.8, so 70.8e-12 F which is 70.8 picoFarads. So the capacitance is 70.8 pF. So that would be part (a) done.

Next, part (b): the charge when it's charged to 1000 volts. The formula Q = C * V. So C is 70.8e-12 F, V is 1000 volts. So Q = 70.8e-12 * 1000 = 70.8e-9 Coulombs. Wait, 70.8e-9 is 7.08e-8 C. So part (b) is 7.08 × 10^-8 coulombs.

Part (c): the energy stored. The energy U is given by U = ½ C V². So plugging in the numbers: U = 0.5 * 70.8e-12 F * (1000)^2. Let's compute that. 1000 squared is a million, 1e6. So 0.5 * 70.8e-12 * 1e6 = 0.5 *70.8e-6. Because 1e6 cancels with 1e-12 to give 1e-6. 70.8e-6 is 7.08e-5. Multiply by 0.5 gives 3.54e-5 J. So part (c) is 3.54 × 10^-5 joules.

Now part (d): the force of attraction between the plates. Hmm, I think the force can be found using the formula F = (ε₀ * A * V²) / (2d²). Wait, or maybe another approach. Alternatively, the force can be calculated from the electric field. The electric field between the plates is E = V/d, and the force on one plate is F = (1/2) ε₀ E² A. Let me think which is correct.

Wait, another way: the force between the plates of a capacitor is given by F = (σ * E)/2, where σ is the surface charge density. Alternatively, I remember a formula F = (C V²) / (2d² ε₀ A) ), but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the electric field E is V/d. The surface charge density σ is Q/A, which is (C V)/A. So σ = (C V)/A. Then the force per unit area is (σ * E)/2. So F = (σ E A ) / 2. Wait, because E is V/d, and σ is C V / A. So substituting:

σ = (C V)/A = (ε₀ A/d * V)/A ) = ε₀ V / d.

So E = V/d. Then the force F is (σ * E * A ) / 2. So substituting σ and E:

F = [ (ε₀ V/d) * (V/d) * A ] / 2.

Simplify that: F = (ε₀ A V²) / (2 d²).

Yes, that seems right.

So plugging in the numbers:

ε₀ = 8.85e-12 F/m,
A = 0.04 m²,
V = 1000 V,
d = 0.005 m.

So F = (8.85e-12 * 0.04 * (1000)^2 ) / (2 * (0.005)^2 )

Let me compute step by step.

First, numerator: 8.85e-12 * 0.04 = 3.54e-13.

Multiply by (1000)^2 = 1e6: 3.54e-13 * 1e6 = 3.54e-7.

Denominator: 2 * (0.005)^2 = 2 * 0.000025 = 0.00005 = 5e-5.

So F = 3.54e-7 / 5e-5.

Divide 3.54e-7 by 5e-5. Let me compute exponents first: 1e-7 / 1e-5 is 1e-2. So 3.54 /5 is approx 0.708, and then multiply by 1e-2: 0.708e-2 = 7.08e-3 Newtons.

Oh wait, but wait, 3.54e-7 divided by 5e-5 is (3.54 /5) * 1e-2. 3.54 divided by 5 is 0.708. So 0.708e-2 N is 7.08e-3 N. Which is 708 dynes because 1 N is 10^5 dynes. So 7.08e-3 N * 1e5 dynes/N = 708 dynes. So the force is 7.08e-3 N or 708 dynes.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B lists (b) as 7.08e-8 C, (c) 3.54e-5 J, and (d) 7.08e-3 N. So that matches all the calculations for each part.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to avoid any mistakes.

For capacitance: C = ε₀ A/d. A is 0.2m * 0.2m = 0.04 m². d 0.005 m.

So 8.85e-12 * 0.04 / 0.005 = 8.85e-12 * 8 = 7.08e-11 F, which is 70.8 pF. Correct.

Charge Q: C * V = 70.8e-12 F * 1e3 V = 70.8e-9 C = 7.08e-8 C. Correct.

Energy: ½ C V² = 0.5 *70.8e-12 * (1e3)^2 = 0.5 *70.8e-12 *1e6= 0.5 *70.8e-6= 35.4e-6=3.54e-5 J. Correct.

Force: Using F = (ε₀ A V²)/(2 d²) = (8.85e-12 * 0.04 * (1e3)^2 ) / (2*(0.005)^2 )

Compute numerator: 8.85e-12 * 0.04 = 3.54e-13; 3.54e-13 *1e6=3.54e-7.

Denominator: 2 * (0.005)^2 = 2 *2.5e-5=5e-5.

So 3.54e-7 /5e-5 = 7.08e-3 N. Correct.

So the correct option should be option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically using the given formulas and data:

### (a) Capacitance
The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by:

\[
C = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A}{d}
\]

Where:
- \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \) (vacuum permittivity),
- \( A = 0.2 \, \text{m} \times 0.2 \, \text{m} = 0.04 \, \text{m}^2 \) (area of the plates),
- \( d = 0.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.005 \, \text{m} \) (separation between the plates).

Substituting the values:

\[
C = \frac{(8.85 \times 10^{-12}) (0.04)}{0.005} = 7.08 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{F} = 70.8 \, \text{pF}.
\]

Thus, the capacitance is **70.8 pF**.

---

### (b) Charge
The charge on the capacitor is given by:

\[
Q = C V
\]

Where:
- \( C = 70.8 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F} \),
- \( V = 1000 \, \text{V} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
Q = (70.8 \times 10^{-12}) (1000) = 7.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C}.
\]

Thus, the charge is **\( 7.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C} \)**.

---

### (c) Energy Stored
The energy stored in the capacitor is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]

Where:
- \( C = 70.8 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F} \),
- \( V = 1000 \, \text{V} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} (70.8 \times 10^{-12}) (1000)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (70.8 \times 10^{-12}) (10^6) = 3.54 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the energy stored is **\( 3.54 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{J} \)**.

---

### (d) Force of Attraction
The force of attraction between the plates is given by:

\[
F = \frac{\varepsilon_0 A V^2}{2 d^2}
\]

Where:
- \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \),
- \( A = 0.04 \, \text{m}^2 \),
- \( V = 1000 \, \text{V} \),
- \( d = 0.005 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
F = \frac{(8.85 \times 10^{-12}) (0.04) (1000)^2}{2 (0.005)^2} = \frac{(8.85 \times 10^{-12}) (0.04) (10^6)}{2 (2.5 \times 10^{-5})}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
F = \frac{3.54 \times 10^{-7}}{5 \times 10^{-5}} = 7.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{N} = 708 \, \text{dynes}.
\]

Thus, the force of attraction is **\( 7.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{N} \) (or 708 dynes)**.

---

### Final Answer
Comparing the results with the options, the correct choice is:

**B: 70.8 pF, \( 7.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{C} \), \( 3.54 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{J} \), \( 7.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{N} \) (708 dynes).**

**Answer: B**
