Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: If Mr. Hammer's disposable income last year was $5,000 and his total expenditures were $4,600, what was his propensity to save? The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, the propensity to save is the portion of disposable income that a person saves rather than spends. So it's like, how much of his income does he put into savings. 

Wait, disposable income is the amount of money you have after paying taxes and other mandatory payments, right? So Mr. Hammer has $5,000 available to spend or save.

His total expenditures were $4,600. So that's how much he spent. To find savings, I think I subtract the expenditures from the disposable income. Let me do that math: 5,000 minus 4,600 equals... uh, 400. So he saved $400.

Now, the propensity to save is usually expressed as a percentage. So I think the formula is (savings / disposable income) * 100. That makes sense because it shows what fraction of his income he's saving.

Plugging in the numbers: 400 divided by 5,000. Let me calculate that. 400 divided by 5000 is 0.08. To get the percentage, I multiply by 100, which gives me 8%.

Looking at the options, option F is 8%. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but I should double-check. Did I mix up savings and expenditures? No, because savings are income minus spending. So yes, 5000-4600=400. So 400/5000 is 8%. Yep, that's correct.

The propensity to save is calculated by dividing savings by disposable income and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Here, savings equal disposable income minus expenditures: $5,000 - $4,600 = $400. The propensity to save is ($400 / $5,000) * 100 = 8%. 

Answer: F
