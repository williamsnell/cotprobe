Okay, so I have this question about the Taylor series and its convergence. Hmm, let me think. The function f(x) is given as the sum from n=0 to infinity of x^n divided by n factorial. So, f(x) = Σ (x^n)/n! from n=0 to ∞.

Wait, I remember that this series looks familiar. Oh right, the Taylor series expansion of e^x is exactly this! Because e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ... So yes, f(x) is e^x.

The question is about the convergence of the Taylor series for f at x=5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Taylor series is being considered at x=5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, is the Taylor series for f at x=5 absolutely converging? Hmm, no, wait, more precisely, does the Taylor series for f at x=5 converge absolutely?

Wait, the function f(x) is e^x, which is entire, meaning it's analytic everywhere on the complex plane. So its Taylor series converges for all real (and complex) numbers. So for any x, the series should converge.

But wait, the question is about the Taylor series centered at x=5. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the function f(x) is given as the sum, which is itself a Taylor series. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the function f(x) is given as the sum f(x) = Σ (x^n)/n! from n=0 to ∞. So that's the expansion of e^x. So this series converges for all real x because the ratio test would show that the radius of convergence is infinite.

But the question is about the Taylor series of f at x=5. Wait, no, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read again. Oh wait, the question says: "Is the Taylor Series for f at x=5 where f(x)=sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n /n! absolutely converging?"

Wait, I think I might have misread. So f(x) is e^x, and we're considering its Taylor series expansion around x=5. So what's the radius of convergence for that series?

Wait, the Taylor series of a function expanded around a point a has a radius of convergence equal to the distance to the nearest singularity in the complex plane. But e^x is entire, so it has no singularities. So the radius of convergence should be infinite, meaning the series converges for all x.

Wait, but wait, the function f(x) is e^x, and its Taylor series around any point a will also have an infinite radius of convergence. So regardless of where you expand it, the series will converge everywhere.

So the Taylor series for f at x=5 will converge for all x, absolutely. So the radius of convergence is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the absolute convergence. Since the series converges for all x, then for any x, including x=5, it converges absolutely.

Wait, but the question is a bit confusing. Wait, are they asking about the convergence at x=5, or about the Taylor series expansion around x=5 and where it converges?

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as: when you take the Taylor series of f centered at x=5, does this series converge absolutely? But since e^x is entire, the Taylor series around any point (including 5) will have an infinite radius of convergence, so yes, it converges absolutely for all x.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: Is the Taylor Series for f at x=5 where f(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n /n! absolutely converging?

Wait, perhaps the function f(x) is given by that series, and they're asking about the Taylor series of f at x=5. Wait, but that's a bit circular because f(x) is already given by a Taylor series (that of e^x). So perhaps the question is about the convergence of f(x) itself, which is the Taylor series of e^x, and whether it's absolutely convergent at x=5.

Wait, but the series for e^x is always absolutely convergent for all real x. So at x=5, it's absolutely convergent.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about expanding f(x) as a Taylor series around x=5. But in any case, the series would converge.

Wait, but perhaps the question is more about the radius of convergence. Let me think about the general approach.

The function f(x) is e^x, which is sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n /n!.

The Taylor series for f at x=a is sum_{n=0}^∞ (f^{(n)}(a)/n!)(x-a)^n.

But since f(x)=e^x, all its derivatives at any point a are e^a. So f^{(n)}(a) = e^a.

Then the Taylor series becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ (e^a /n!)(x-a)^n.

Which is e^a * sum_{n=0}^∞ [(x-a)^n /n! ] = e^a * e^{x-a} } = e^{x}.

Which is the same as the original function, as expected.

But the radius of convergence for this series would be determined by the ratio test. Let me apply the ratio test to the series sum_{n=0}^∞ (e^a (x-a)^n ) /n!.

Wait, take the limit as n approaches infinity of |a_{n+1}/a_n|.

a_n = (x-a)^n /n! * e^a.

a_{n+1} = (x-a)^{n+1}/(n+1)! * e^a.

So a_{n+1}/a_n = (x-a) * (n!)/(n+1)! ) = (x-a)/(n+1).

The absolute value is |x-a|/(n+1). As n approaches infinity, this limit is 0, which is less than 1. So the series converges absolutely for all x. So the radius of convergence is infinite.

Therefore, the Taylor series for f at x=5 converges absolutely for all x.

Wait, but the question is whether it's absolutely converging. So the answer is yes, it's absolutely convergent. But looking at the options, they are numerical values, not yes or no. Oh wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the radius of convergence when expanded around x=5.

Wait, because the options are numbers, so perhaps the question is intended to ask for the radius of convergence of the Taylor series of f at x=5.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the question is: what's the radius of convergence of the Taylor series for f at x=5, where f(x) is given by that sum. Since f(x) is e^x, which is entire, the radius of convergence would be infinite, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the question is phrased a bit ambiguously. Let me read it again.

"Is the Taylor Series for f at x=5 where f(x)=sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n /n! absolutely converging?"

Wait, that seems to be a yes/no question, but the options are A-J with numerical values. Hmm, perhaps the question is actually about the radius of convergence. Because the options include numbers like 0.5, 1.0, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interval of convergence. So when you expand f(x)=e^x as a Taylor series around x=5, what is the radius of convergence.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, since e^x is entire, the radius would be infinite. But none of the options are 'infinite'. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about f(x) as given by the series, not knowing that it's e^x.

Wait, let's suppose that f(x) is defined as the sum from n=0 to ∞ of x^n /n! So what is the radius of convergence of this series?

Wait, the ratio test for the series sum x^n /n! would be limit as n→∞ of |x|^{n+1}/(n+1)! * n!/x^n | = |x| / (n+1) → 0 as n→∞. So the radius of convergence is infinite. So the series converges for all x.

So the Taylor series for f at x=5 would have the same radius of convergence as the original series, which is infinite. So it converges everywhere.

But the options don't have an option for infinite. So perhaps the question is actually about something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the question. Wait, no, the function f(x) is already given as the sum, which is e^x. So the question is about the Taylor series of f at x=5. So the Taylor series would be sum_{n=0}^\infty (f^{(n)}(5)/n!)(x-5)^n.

But since f(x)=e^x, all derivatives are e^x, so f^{(n)}(5)=e^5.

So the Taylor series is sum_{n=0}^\infty (e^5 /n!)(x-5)^n. Which is e^5 * sum_{n=0}^\infty (x-5)^n /n! = e^5 * e^{x-5} }=e^{x}.

So the Taylor series around x=5 is just the same as the original function, so it converges for all x.

Wait, but the options are numbers, so maybe the question is actually about the remainder term in the Taylor series, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about whether the Taylor series converges at x=5. But that can't be, because at x=5, the series is just sum (5^n)/n! which definitely converges.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the question is phrased as whether the Taylor series for f at x=5 is absolutely converging. But the Taylor series for f at x=5 is just the expansion around that point, but that expansion is also the same as the original series, which converges everywhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The function f(x) is given as the sum of x^n /n! from n=0 to ∞, which is e^x. So this series has an infinite radius of convergence.

Therefore, the Taylor series for f at any point, including x=5, will also have an infinite radius of convergence. So the series converges absolutely for all x.

But the options don't include 'infinite', so perhaps the intended question is different. Maybe it's asking about the convergence at a specific point, like x=5, but that's a single point, and any power series converges at the center point, so that's trivial.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the radius of convergence of the Taylor series of f at x=5, which would be the distance from x=5 to the nearest singularity. But f is entire, so there are no singularities, so the radius is infinite.

Wait, but perhaps the question is a trick, and the function f(x) is not e^x but something else. Wait, no, the series sum x^n /n! is e^x.

Wait, maybe the question is actually about the convergence of the Taylor series of f at a different point. Wait, no, the question is about x=5.

Hmm, perhaps the options are actually for a different question, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the radius of convergence when expanding around x=5, but in that case, the radius is infinite. Since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is not about expanding f(x)=e^x around x=5, but rather the function f(x) is given by the series sum x^n /n! and the question is whether the Taylor series of f at x=5 is convergent. But that doesn't make sense because the Taylor series of f at x=5 would be the same as the original series, just re-centered.

Wait, no, maybe the function f is defined as the sum from n=0 to ∞ of x^n /n! which is e^x, and the question is about whether the Taylor series of f at x=5 is absolutely convergent. But since the Taylor series is just another representation of e^x, which converges everywhere, the answer would be yes, it's absolutely convergent for all x, so the radius is infinite.

But the options don't have 'infinite', so perhaps the correct answer is that the radius is infinite, implying that the series converges everywhere, so the answer would be yes. But since the options are numerical, perhaps the intended answer is that the radius is infinite, but that's not present. So perhaps the question is wrong, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the problem again.

The Taylor series for f at x=5: f(x) is e^x, so the Taylor series around x=5 is sum_{n=0}^∞ (e^5 (x-5)^n ) /n! which is e^{x}. So the series converges for all x, so the radius of convergence is ∞.

But the options are numbers, and the question is phrased as whether the Taylor series is absolutely converging. So perhaps the intended answer is that it does converge, so the radius is ∞, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is about something else.

Wait, perhaps the function f(x) is not e^x. Wait, no, because the series sum x^n /n! is e^x.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking about the convergence of the given series at x=5. But the given series is the Taylor series of e^x, which converges everywhere, so at x=5, it certainly converges.

Wait, but the question is about the Taylor series for f at x=5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking whether the Taylor series converges at a specific point, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the radius of convergence of the Taylor series centered at x=5, which would be the distance to the nearest singularity. Since e^x is entire, the radius is infinite.

But again, the options don't include infinite. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the function is not e^x, but the problem states f(x) is sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n /n! So that's definitely e^x.

Wait, maybe the question is about the convergence of the Taylor series for f at x=5, but since f is entire, it's trivial. So perhaps the answer is that the series converges absolutely, so the correct option is 'yes', but the options are all numbers, so maybe the question is misworded.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking about the value of something else, like the radius of convergence, and the options are possible values. But if the radius is infinite, then perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the convergence at a specific point other than 5, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the standpoint of the ratio test for the Taylor series coefficients. The Taylor series for f at a point a has coefficients f^{(n)}(a)/n!.

The radius of convergence R can be found using the formula:

1/R = lim sup_{n→∞} |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n are the coefficients.

In this case, a_n = f^{(n)}(5)/n! = e^5 /n!.

So |a_n|^{1/n} = (e^5 /n!)^{1/n}.

But as n approaches infinity, n! grows faster than any exponential, so (n!)^{1/n} grows like n/e (by Stirling's approximation), so (e^5 /n! )^{1/n} → 0 as n→∞.

Thus, 1/R = 0 → R = ∞.

So the radius of convergence is infinite. So the series converges for all x.

Therefore, the Taylor series for f at x=5 is absolutely convergent for all x, so the radius is infinite. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is that the series converges, so the correct option is 'yes', but the options are numerical, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the sum of the series at x=5. Let's compute f(5): f(5) = sum_{n=0}^∞ 5^n /n! = e^5, which is finite, so the series converges.

But the question is about the Taylor series of f at x=5, which, as I determined, has an infinite radius of convergence.

But the options are all numbers, so perhaps the intended answer is that the radius is 5, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the remainder term, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. Oh wait, the question is: "Is the Taylor Series for f at x=5 where f(x)=sum_{n=0}^∞ x^n /n! absolutely converging?"

Wait, maybe the question is actually about whether the Taylor series for f at x=5 is the same as the given series. But that's a different question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded, and it's actually about whether the given series for f(x) converges at x=5. In that case, the answer would be yes, because the series for e^x converges everywhere.

But again, the options are numerical, so perhaps the intended answer is the radius of convergence, which is infinite, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a trick here.

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, and the function f(x) is not e^x, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the function f(x) is given by a different series, and the question is about the Taylor series at x=5. But no, the function is given as sum x^n /n!.

Wait, maybe the question is about the interval of convergence after expanding f(x) as a Taylor series around x=5. But in that case, the interval is from -∞ to +∞, so radius is infinite
