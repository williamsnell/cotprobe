Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about the mass rate of removal of ammonia from an air stream in a vertical pipe. Hmm, let me see what the question says.

So the pipe has an internal diameter of 60 mm, which is 0.06 meters. Its length is 1.6 meters. There's a water film of 0.2 mm thickness (so 0.0002 m) at 293 K running down the inside wall. The air stream contains ammonia, and the interfacial mole fraction of ammonia is 0.0372. The water at the inlet is pure, so I guess that means the ammonia is being absorbed into the water.

I need to find the mass rate of removal of ammonia, which I think means the rate at which ammonia is being transferred from the air to the water. The options are given in various units, so I have to make sure my answer's in the right unit.

Wait, what concepts do I remember about mass transfer in such situations? I think this is a problem involving convective mass transfer, maybe using the concept of mass transfer coefficients. Oh right, the film theory might apply here since there's a thin water film.

Film theory says that the mass transfer occurs through a thin film adjacent to the interface. So the mass transfer rate would depend on the concentration gradient across this film.

The formula I remember for mass transfer rate (N_A) is:

N_A = (D * A * (x_A1 - x_A2)) / (film thickness * (1 - x_A2)))

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the molar flux might be calculated using Fick's law for mass transfer. Oh right, Fick's first law is J = -D * (dc/dz), but in this case, maybe it's better to think in terms of the overall mass transfer coefficient.

Wait, another approach: the mass transfer rate can be calculated using the equation:

N = k * A * (x1 - x2)

Where k is the mass transfer coefficient, A is the interfacial area, and x1 and x2 are the mole fractions at the interface and in the bulk, respectively.

Wait, but in this problem, the water is pure at the inlet, so the mole fraction of ammonia in the water (bulk) is zero. Because the water is pure, so x2 is zero. So the equation simplifies.

Wait, but the interface is between the air and the water film. So x1 is the mole fraction of ammonia in the air at the interface, which is given as 0.0372. And x2 is in the bulk water, which is zero because the water is pure. So the concentration difference is x1 - x2 = 0.0372.

But wait, I'm not sure about the setup. The ammonia is in the air, and it's dissolving into the water film. So the mole fraction of ammonia in the air at the interface is 0.0372. The bulk water has zero ammonia because it's pure.

So the mass transfer rate (in moles per second) would be the product of the mass transfer coefficient (k), the area (A), and the concentration difference (x1 - x2).

But wait, I think I might be mixing the concepts. Because the film is on the inside of the pipe, and the pipe is vertical, so maybe the flow is affecting the mass transfer. But perhaps the problem simplifies it by giving the thickness of the film, so we can model it as a film with a certain thickness, and then use the appropriate equations.

Wait, another thought: the rate of mass transfer can be calculated using the formula:

m = (D * A * (C1 - C2)) / (film thickness)

Where D is the diffusion coefficient, A is the area, and C1 and C2 are the concentrations at the interface and in the bulk.

But wait, that's Fick's law for steady-state diffusion through a film. So in this case, the ammonia is diffusing through the water film. So the concentration in the air at the interface (C1) would be related to the mole fraction in the air, and the concentration in the bulk water (C2) is zero.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the units here. Because the mole fraction in the gas phase relates to partial pressure, and the concentration in the liquid is in mol/m³. So I might need Henry's law to relate the two.

Oh right, Henry's law states that the concentration of a gas in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase. So C = (P_A * H), where H is Henry's law constant for ammonia in water.

Wait, but I don't have the value of Henry's law constant here. Hmm, that might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the given mole fraction and calculate the mass transfer without needing H because the film thickness is given, perhaps through the concept of mass transfer coefficient.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the overall mass transfer coefficient, considering both the gas and liquid phases. But without knowing the individual coefficients, that might not be straightforward.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the film is 0.2 mm thick on the inside. So maybe the film is on the water side, and the ammonia is diffusing through that film from the gas to the liquid.

So if the film thickness δ is 0.0002 m, then the mass transfer rate would be (D * A * (C_gas - C_liquid)) / δ.

But I'm not sure what D is here. D would be the diffusion coefficient of ammonia in water. Hmm, but I don't have that value either. Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the diffusion coefficient and other necessary constants are already accounted for, or perhaps the given interfacial mole fraction is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think in terms of units. The answer options are in kg/hr, k moles/hr, etc. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the molar flux and then multiply by the area.

Wait, the pipe's internal diameter is 60 mm, so radius is 0.03 m. The area A is the surface area of the inside of the pipe, which for a vertical pipe would be the circumference times the length. So A = 2 * π * r * L.

Calculating that: 2 * π * 0.03 m * 1.6 m = 2 * 3.1416 * 0.03 * 1.6 ≈ 0.3016 m².

Wait, but if the film is 0.2 mm thick, maybe the area is the same as the internal surface area of the pipe, so 0.3016 m² as calculated.

But again, without the mass transfer coefficient or the diffusion coefficient, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives the interfacial mole fraction, which can be used to find the concentration in the liquid at the interface via Henry's law, and then the concentration difference is used in Fick's law.

But then I would need Henry's law constant for ammonia in water at 293 K. Do I know that? I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can look it up or recall that it's around 1e5 or something. Wait, but perhaps the problem simplifies it by giving the interfacial mole fraction directly, so perhaps we can model the concentration in the liquid as x_interfacial * H, but without H, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the mole fraction in the gas at the interface is 0.0372, and in the liquid, it's zero. So the mole fraction difference is 0.0372. But how do I convert that into a concentration difference?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the problem might be using the film thickness to calculate the Sherwood number, which relates to the mass transfer coefficient. But again, without knowing the flow velocity or other properties, that's tricky.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a key piece of information or equation here. Let me think again. The question is about the mass rate of removal of ammonia, so it's the amount in kg per hour or moles per hour.

Wait, perhaps the solution is found by using the formula for mass transfer in a wetted-wall column, where the mass transfer rate is given by:

N_A = (D * A * (x1 - x2)) / (δ * (1 - x2))

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, since x2 is zero (pure water), it simplifies to N_A = (D * A * x1) / δ.

But again, without D and the proper units, I can't compute it numerically.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use the given mole fraction and calculate the mass transfer based on the flow of the film. Wait, but the film is water, and the ammonia is diffusing into it. Maybe the rate is determined by how much water is flowing, but I don't have the flow rate of water.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass transfer coefficient is such that the rate is directly proportional to the mole fraction and the area, but without knowing k, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the mass transfer rate is given by the product of the interfacial mole fraction, the molar mass of ammonia, and the flow rate of the air. But again, without the flow rate of air, that's impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options. The options include kg/hr and k moles per hour. For ammonia, the molar mass is about 17 g/mol, so 0.6222 kg/hr would be 0.6222 kg/hr / 0.017 kg/mol = approx 36.6 mol/hr, which is 0.0366 k mol/hr. Looking at the options, option G is 0.0366 k mole/hr. Option C is 0.6222 kg/hr, which would be 3.65 kg/hr if I multiply by 17? Wait, no, 0.6222 kg/hr divided by 0.017 kg/mol is 36.588 mol/hr, which is 0.036588 k mol/hr, which matches option G.

Wait, that seems promising. So if the correct answer is 0.0366 k mole/hr, then the option is G. But why? How was that number calculated?

Wait, perhaps the calculation is based on the assumption that the mass transfer rate is (mole fraction) * (molar mass) * (flow rate). But without knowing the flow rate, I can't say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the log mean driving force, but that's more for when there are concentrations at both ends.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives the film thickness, which suggests that it's using the film theory. So the mass transfer rate would be (D * A * (C1 - C2)) / δ.

But without knowing D, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem expects me to know or find D for ammonia in water at 293 K. Or perhaps the problem is designed to use a simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the formula m = k * A * (x1 - x2), but without knowing k, I can't proceed. So maybe the problem provides the film thickness as a way to compute the mass transfer coefficient, but without knowing the velocity or other parameters, I can't.

Wait, but the pipe is vertical, and the water film is running down. So perhaps it's a falling film situation, and the film thickness relates to the flow rate of the water. But the problem doesn't give the flow rate of water, so that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass transfer is in the gas phase, and the film is the gas film. But the film is 0.2 mm in the water, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Stefan flow or something else, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply looking for the application of Fick's law with the given data. Let's try that.

Assuming that the molar flux J is given by J = D * (C1 - C2) / δ.

But C1 is the concentration of ammonia in the gas at the interface, and C2 is zero in the water. So J = D * C1 / δ.

But how to find C1? Using Henry's law, the concentration in the liquid is C = (P * x) / (H), where P is the pressure (which I assume is atmospheric, so 1 atm), x is the mole fraction, and H is Henry's constant.

Wait, but then I need H for ammonia in water at 293 K. I think Henry's law constant for ammonia is around 1e5 atm·L/mol, but I'm not sure. Let me think. At 293 K, the H for NH3 is approximately 1.99e5 atm·L/mol. Wait, that's a high value, meaning that ammonia doesn't dissolve much, but wait, I thought ammonia is highly soluble.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing with other gases. Let me double-check: I think Henry's law constant for NH3 at 25°C is about 1.99e5 atm·L/mol, but that's a high value. Wait, no, that can't be right because a higher H implies lower solubility. But ammonia is known to be very soluble in water. So perhaps I'm mistaken.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the Henry's law constant I'm thinking of is in terms of (pressure)/(concentration), so a lower H means higher solubility. So if H is small, the concentration in the liquid is higher for the same partial pressure.

But without the exact value, perhaps I should proceed hypothetically. Let's say H is given, but in this problem, I don't have it. So perhaps the problem is designed to not require it, and perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the mole fraction at the interface is given, and the mass transfer rate is simply based on that, perhaps assuming that all the ammonia at the interface is being transferred into the water. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mass transfer rate is proportional to the mole fraction, the area, and the molar mass. So N = x1 * A * M * something.

Wait, but without the mass transfer coefficient or the flow rate, I can't compute the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge of the formula for the mass transfer rate in a wetted wall column, where the rate is (kLa) * (x1 - x2). But again, without knowing k or a, I can't compute.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to calculate the mass transfer using the given data without additional constants. Let's try that.

The area A is 2 * π * r * L. The radius r is 0.03 m, length L is 1.6 m. So A = 2 * π * 0.03 * 1.6 ≈ 0.3016 m².

The mole fraction x1 is 0.0372, and x2 is 0. So the difference is 0.0372.

If I had the mass transfer coefficient (k), then the molar transfer rate would be N = k * A * (x1 - x2). But without k, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the question gives the film thickness, which can be used with the diffusion coefficient to find k as k = D / δ. But without D, I can't compute k.

Wait, if I assume that D for ammonia in water is, say, 1e-9 m²/s, then k would be D/δ = 1e-9 / 0.0002 = 5e-6 m/s. But using this, let's compute.

Molar flux N = k * A * (x1 - x2) = 5e-6 m/s * 0.3016 m² * 0.0372.

Wait, but x1 is mole fraction, so I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in the gas phase, the mole fraction relates to concentration via the ideal gas law.

Wait, maybe I need to convert the mole fraction to a concentration. The concentration C1 in the gas phase at the interface would be C1 = (P * x1) / (R T), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature.

Assuming atmospheric pressure, P = 101325 Pa, R = 8.314 J/mol·K, T = 293 K.

So C1 = (101325 * 0.0372) / (8.314 * 293).

Let me compute that: numerator is 101325 * 0.0372 ≈ 3767.  Denominator is 8.314 * 293 ≈ 2438. So C1 ≈ 3767 / 2438 ≈ 1.545 mol/m³.

Now, if I use Fick's law, the molar flux J = (C1 - C2) * D / δ. Since C2 is zero, J = 1.545 * D / 0.0002.

But again, without D, I can't compute J. If I take D for ammonia in water as 1.1e-9 m²/s (I'm not sure, but let's say 1e-9), then J = 1.545 * 1e-9 / 0.0002 = 7.725e-6 mol/(m²·s).

Then the total molar transfer rate N = J * A = 7.725e-6 * 0.3016 ≈ 2.33e-6 mol/s.

Multiply by 3600 to get per hour: 2.33e-6 * 3600 ≈ 0.0084 mol/hr. That's 8.4e-3 mol/hr, which is 0.0084 k mol/hr. But looking at the options, option E is 0.0783 k mole/hr, which is about ten times higher. So perhaps my D value is wrong.

If I take D as 1e-5 m²/s, which is higher than I thought, but perhaps ammonia diffuses faster. Then J = 1.545 * 1e-5 / 0.0002 = 0.00007725 mol/(m²·s).

N = 0.00007725 * 0.3016 ≈ 2.33e-5 mol/s. Multiply by 3600: 0.0839 mol/hr, which is 0.0839 k mol/hr. That's close to option E, which is 0.0783 k mole/hr. Hmm, but why the discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct D is such that when multiplied, it gives 0.078
