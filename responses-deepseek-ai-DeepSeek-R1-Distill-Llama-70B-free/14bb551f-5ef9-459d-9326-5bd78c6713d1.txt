Question:

A grantor conveyed her mansion and surrounding property to her nephew "for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs. " Two years later, the nephew entered into a real estate agreement for the sale of the property to his brother, whereby the nephew agreed to convey the premises to the brother in fee simple absolute. Prior to the settlement date, the brother contacted the nephew, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the nephew could not convey a fee simple. The Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished by statute in this jurisdiction. Thus, the nephew's prayer for specific performance would be

Options:

A: denied, because the remainder to the nephew's heirs is a contingent interest.
B: granted, because the nephew has the right to sell his life estate.
C: denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.
D: denied, because the nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer a fee simple absolute.
E: denied, because the Rule would not be triggered, thus creating only a life estate in the nephew.
F: granted, because the nephew's life estate combined with his vested remainder gives him a fee simple.
G: denied, because under the Doctrine of Worthier Title, at the termination of the nephew's life estate, the grantor has a reversionary interest.
H: granted, because the nephew's heirs receive a vested indefeasible interest in the property.
I: granted, because the nephew has a vested remainder in fee simple absolute.
J: granted, because the remainder in his heirs would become vested into a full fee in those heirs.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with estates and future interests. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a grantor who conveyed her mansion and property to her nephew "for life, remainder after (the nephew's) death to his heirs." Then, two years later, the nephew tries to sell the property to his brother in fee simple absolute. The brother backs out, saying the nephew can't convey a fee simple. The question is about whether the nephew's prayer for specific performance would be granted, considering that the Rule in Shelley's Case has been abolished in this jurisdiction.

First, I'll break down the conveyance. The grantor gave the property to the nephew for life, with a remainder to his heirs after his death. So, the nephew has a life estate, and the remainder is to his heirs. Wait, but heirs can sometimes mean different things. Normally, when a remainder is to someone's heirs, it could create a vested remainder or a contingent one, depending on how it's phrased.

But wait, typically, when you have a conveyance to A for life, then to A's heirs, that creates a vested remainder in A's heirs. Because "heirs" in this context usually refers to the class of people who would take under intestacy, and it's a present interest. So under common law, the nephew has a life estate, and the remainder is vested in his heirs. But wait, the Rule in Shelley's Case comes into play here, doesn't it?

The Rule in Shelley's Case says that if a conveyance is made to a life tenant with a remainder to the life tenant's heirs, the remainder is interpreted as a fee simple absolute in the life tenant. Because the rule says that the remainder is assumed to be as broad as possible. So in that case, the nephew would actually have a fee simple absolute, and the remainder to his heirs would merge into his life estate, giving him the fee.

But wait, the question says that the jurisdiction has abolished the Rule in Shelley's Case by statute. So that changes things. Without Shelley's Rule, the conveyance is read as written. So the grant is to the nephew for life, and then to his heirs. So the nephew has a life estate, and the remainder is to his heirs, which is a vested remainder.

Wait, but the nephew's heirs would take after his death. So the heirs have a vested remainder. But what kind of estate is that? If the remainder is to the nephew's heirs, then it's a remainder in fee simple absolute, because it's to a class that can take under intestacy. So the heirs have a vested remainder in fee simple.

Now, when the nephew tries to sell the property to his brother, he's agreeing to convey a fee simple absolute. But what can the nephew actually convey? He has a life estate, and the remainder is vested in his heirs. So when he sells, he can only convey what he owns. So he can convey his life estate, but cannot convey the fee simple absolute because that's owned by his heirs (or their estates, if he has any).

So when the nephew tries to convey a fee simple, he can't do that because he doesn't own the fee. His interest is just a life estate. So the brother is right, the nephew cannot convey a fee simple. Therefore, the specific performance would be denied because the nephew can't convey what he doesn't have.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Denied, because the remainder is a contingent interest. Wait, but in this case, without Shelley's Rule, the remainder to the nephew's heirs is vested, not contingent. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Granted, because the nephew can sell his life estate. But the nephew is trying to convey a fee simple. He can sell his life estate, but the brother wants a fee simple. So even if the nephew sells his life estate, the brother would only get that, not the fee. So specific performance to convey fee simple absolute would not be possible. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses. That seems correct. He only has a life estate, so he can't convey fee simple. So C is a possible correct answer.

Option D: Denied, because nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and cannot transfer fee. This is similar to C. It's also correct reasoning. So D is another possible answer.

Wait, what's the difference between C and D? C says he can't convey a larger estate than he has. D says he can't transfer fee because his interest is for life. Both seem correct, but perhaps the more accurate statement is D, because it's specifically about the fee.

But wait, the nephew's interest includes a life estate and possibly a vested remainder. Wait, no. Wait, the grant is to nephew for life, remainder to his heirs. So the nephew's interest is a life estate, and the remainder is in his heirs. So the nephew doesn't have the fee; he has a life estate, and the remainder is with others.

So when he tries to convey fee simple, he can't because he doesn't own it. So both C and D make sense, but perhaps D is more precise.

Option E: Denied, because Rule not triggered, creating only life estate. Well, without Shelley's Rule, the nephew has a life estate and a vested remainder in his heirs. So E says it's a life estate only, which isn't accurate. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Granted, because the nephew's life estate plus vested remainder gives fee. Wait, that would be the case under Shelley's Rule, but the Rule is abolished. So without the Rule, the nephew doesn't have the fee. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Denied, because Doctrine of Worthier Title applies, giving grantor a reversion. Hmm. The Doctrine of Worthier Title says that if a grantor conveys property to someone for life, then to that person's heirs, it's interpreted as the grantor keeping a reversion. But wait, that's only if the remainder is to the grantor's heirs. In this case, the remainder is to the nephew's heirs, so the Doctrine of Worthier Title doesn't apply. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Granted, because the nephew's heirs have a vested interest. No, the brother is trying to get fee simple, which the nephew can't convey, so specific performance wouldn't be granted. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Granted, because nephew has vested remainder in fee. No, without Shelley's Rule, the nephew only has a life estate; the remainder is to his heirs, so it's their vested remainder. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Granted, because the remainder becomes a full fee in heirs. Again, the nephew can't convey the fee, so specific performance wouldn't be granted. So J is incorrect.

So the correct options are between C and D. Let me read them again.

Option C: Denied, because cannot convey larger estate than he has.

Option D: Denied, because nephew's interest is limited to life and cannot transfer fee.

So which is correct? The nephew has a life estate. When he sells, he can convey his life estate, but the brother wants a fee simple. So the nephew cannot convey a fee because he doesn't have it.

So in the real estate contract, the nephew agreed to convey fee simple absolute. But he can't do that. Therefore, specific performance would be denied because he can't perform.

So the correct answer is either C or D. Let me see the options again.

Option C says "cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses." That's correct because the nephew only has a life estate, which is smaller than fee simple.

Option D says "because nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer a fee simple." That's also correct.

Wait, but the question is whether specific performance is granted. So the nephew is seeking specific performance, but he can't convey the fee. Therefore, the court would deny specific performance because he can't perform.

So both C and D seem correct, but perhaps the exact reasoning is that the nephew doesn't own the fee, so he can't convey it. So C: cannot convey a larger estate.

Alternatively, D's reasoning is correct, but perhaps C is a more general statement.

Wait, but another angle: the nephew's interest is a life estate. So when he tries to convey the fee, he's attempting to convey more than he has. Therefore, the contract cannot be specifically enforced because he can't perform.

So the correct answer is either C or D.

But looking at the options, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but let me think again. The nephew has a life estate, and the remainder is vested in his heirs. So when he conveys, he can only convey his life estate. So when he tries to convey fee simple, he can't. So the option that says he can't convey a larger estate than he possesses is correct. So that's option C.

Alternatively, D says his interest is limited to his lifetime, so he can't transfer fee. So both C and D seem correct. But perhaps C is the better answer because it directly addresses the issue of conveying a larger estate.

Wait, but let me think about the possible answers. The options are:

A: Denied because remainder is contingent. No, remainder is vested.

B: Granted, because can sell life estate. No, because the brother wants fee.

C: Denied, can't convey larger estate than he has.

D: Denied, because can't transfer fee, interest is for life.

So both C and D seem correct. But in terms of the specific reasoning, the nephew can't convey fee simple because he doesn't own it. So the option that states that is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the nephew's interest is only for life, so he can't convey a fee. So specific performance is denied for that reason.

But then, another thought: when a life tenant sells the property, they can convey their life estate, but the grantee would also take subject to any future interests. But in this case, the nephew is promising to convey fee simple, which he can't do. So the contract is to convey fee simple, which the nephew can't perform. Therefore, specific performance is denied.

So yes, the correct answer is either C or D. But perhaps the better option is D, because it directly addresses the inability to transfer fee simple.

Wait, but the original conveyance was to the nephew for life, remainder to his heirs. So his heirs have a vested remainder. So the nephew cannot convey the fee because it's already vested in others. So he can't convey more than he owns.

I think the correct answer is C: denied, because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.

Wait, but another angle: when the Rule in Shelley's Case is abolished, the conveyance is read as written. So the nephew has a life estate, and the remainder is to his heirs, which is a vested remainder. So the nephew doesn't have the fee, and thus can't convey it.

So the nephew's maximum interest is a life estate, meaning he can only convey that. So the brother is correct in refusing to perform because the nephew can't convey fee simple.

So in the options, the correct answer would be C or D.

Wait, looking at the options again, option C says "cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses." So that's correct. Option D says "because nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime and he cannot transfer a fee simple." Also correct.

Hmm. Maybe both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is.

Wait, no, in the given options, only one is correct. So which one is it?

I think the answer is C. Because the nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he has. Alternatively, D is also correct because his interest is for life.

Wait, but in the conveyance after Shelley's Rule is abolished, the nephew's interest is a life estate, and the remainder is vested in his heirs. So the nephew doesn't have the fee, so when he tries to convey fee, he can't. So the specific performance would be denied because he can't convey what he doesn't have.

So the correct answer is C or D.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct one because it's more specific about why he can't convey the fee.

Wait, but the more accurate reason is that the nephew doesn't own the fee. So the answer is C: cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D because the nephew's interest is for life, so he can't transfer fee.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is C.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the nephew can only transfer his own interest, which is a life estate. So he can't convey a fee simple. So the reason is that his interest is limited to his lifetime.

So the answer is D.

The question revolves around a grantor who conveyed property to her nephew "for life, remainder after his death to his heirs." The nephew later attempted to sell the property to his brother in fee simple absolute, but the brother refused, arguing that the nephew could not convey a fee simple. The jurisdiction has abolished the Rule in Shelley's Case, which is critical to analyzing the nephew's interest in the property.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Conveyance**: The grantor conveyed the property to the nephew for life, with a remainder to his heirs. Without the Rule in Shelley's Case, the conveyance is read as written. This means the nephew has a life estate, and the remainder to his heirs is a **vested remainder** in fee simple absolute.

2. **Nephew's Interest**: The nephew only holds a life estate. The remainder is vested in his heirs, meaning the fee simple absolute is not owned by the nephew but is held by his heirs. Therefore, the nephew cannot convey a fee simple absolute because he does not possess it.

3. **Real Estate Agreement**: The nephew agreed to convey fee simple absolute to his brother. However, since the nephew only has a life estate, he cannot fulfill this obligation. The brother is correct in refusing to perform because the nephew lacks the legal ability to convey a fee simple.

4. **Specific Performance**: Specific performance requires the party seeking it to be able to fulfill their obligations under the contract. Since the nephew cannot convey a fee simple absolute, specific performance would be denied.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The remainder to the nephew's heirs is not contingent; it is a vested remainder.
- **B**: Incorrect. While the nephew can sell his life estate, the brother is seeking a fee simple absolute, which the nephew cannot convey.
- **C**: Correct. The nephew cannot convey a larger estate than he possesses. He only has a life estate and cannot convey a fee simple absolute.
- **D**: Also correct. The nephew's interest is limited to his lifetime, and he cannot transfer a fee simple absolute.
- **E**: Incorrect. Without the Rule in Shelley's Case, the nephew has a life estate and a vested remainder in his heirs, not just a life estate.
- **F**: Incorrect. Without the Rule in Shelley's Case, the nephew does not have a fee simple absolute.
- **G**: Incorrect. The Doctrine of Worthier Title does not apply here because the remainder is to the nephew's heirs, not the grantor's heirs.
- **H**: Incorrect. The nephew's heirs have a vested remainder, but this does not allow the nephew to convey a fee simple absolute.
- **I**: Incorrect. The nephew does not have a vested remainder in fee simple absolute; the remainder is held by his heirs.
- **J**: Incorrect. The remainder in the heirs does not give the nephew the ability to convey a fee simple absolute.

### Conclusion:
Both **C** and **D** are correct, but **C** is the more precise answer because it directly addresses the nephew's inability to convey a larger estate than he possesses. The nephew cannot convey a fee simple absolute because he only has a life estate.
