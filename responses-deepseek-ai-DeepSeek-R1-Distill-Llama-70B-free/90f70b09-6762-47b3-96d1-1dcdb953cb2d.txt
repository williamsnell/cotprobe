Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the decomposition of carbon dioxide. The reaction given is CO₂ ⇌ CO + ½O₂. I need to find the equilibrium compositions and the extent of reaction at a certain temperature and pressure. The Kp given is 0.647.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what the extent of reaction (epsilon) means. It's the fraction of the reactant that has decomposed. So if epsilon is 1, the reaction goes to completion. But since Kp is less than 1 here, the reaction probably doesn't go very far.

Let's think about the initial setup. Since the problem is about partial pressures, I should probably consider using the ideal gas law or some relation between moles and partial pressures. Wait, but the reaction is in terms of moles, so maybe I can use mole fractions directly.

The reaction starts with only CO₂ present, right? Because it's decomposing into CO and O₂. So the initial moles are 1 mole of CO₂, and 0 of CO and O₂.

Let me define the extent of reaction as epsilon. So, as the reaction proceeds, the moles change. For every mole of CO₂ that reacts, it produces 1 mole of CO and ½ mole of O₂. 

So the change in moles:
CO₂: 1 - epsilon
CO: 0 + epsilon
O₂: 0 + (epsilon/2)

But wait, since we're dealing with partial pressures, maybe I should express each in terms of their mole fractions multiplied by the total pressure. Oh, but the total pressure might change, but since the problem is at 1 atm, I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, alternatively, let's consider the total pressure. Initially, we have 1 mole of CO₂, so the initial pressure is P_total_initial = 1 atm. But as the reaction proceeds, the number of moles increases because 1 mole of CO₂ becomes 1.5 moles (1 CO + 0.5 O₂) per mole reacted. So the total moles after reaction would be n_total = (1 - epsilon) + epsilon + (epsilon/2) = 1 + epsilon/2.

Wait, but the total pressure is fixed at 1 atm. Oh wait, no, the reaction is at constant pressure, so the volume adjusts. Hmm, that complicates things a bit. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this using mole fractions and the Kp expression.

Wait, another approach: Let’s assume that the initial amount is one mole of CO₂, and then express the changes in terms of epsilon.

So, initial moles:
CO₂: 1
CO: 0
O₂: 0

Change with reaction:
CO₂: -epsilon
CO: +epsilon
O₂: +epsilon/2

So, at equilibrium, the moles would be:
CO₂: 1 - epsilon
CO: epsilon
O₂: epsilon/2

The total moles at equilibrium is (1 - epsilon) + epsilon + (epsilon/2) = 1 + epsilon/2.

The mole fractions are then each component's moles divided by the total moles.

So, mole fractions:
x_CO2 = (1 - epsilon) / (1 + epsilon/2)
x_CO = epsilon / (1 + epsilon/2)
x_O2 = (epsilon/2) / (1 + epsilon/2)

Now, the Kp expression is based on partial pressures, which are the mole fractions multiplied by the total pressure. But since the total pressure is 1 atm, the partial pressures are just the mole fractions.

So the Kp expression is Kp = (P_CO * P_O2^½) / P_CO2.

Substituting the expressions:

Kp = [ (epsilon/(1+epsilon/2)) * ( (epsilon/2)/(1+epsilon/2) )^(1/2) ) ] / ( (1 - epsilon)/(1 + epsilon/2) )

Simplify this. Let me write it step by step.

First, numerator: (epsilon) * (epsilon/2)^(1/2) divided by (1 + epsilon/2)^ (1 + 1/2) ), because each is divided by (1 + epsilon/2), so when multiplied, it's (1 + epsilon/2)^(1 + ½) = (1 + e/2)^(3/2) in the denominator.

Denominator: (1 - epsilon) / (1 + epsilon/2)

So putting it together:

Kp = [ epsilon * sqrt(epsilon/2) / (1 + epsilon/2)^(3/2) ) ] / [ (1 - epsilon) / (1 + epsilon/2) ) ]

Simplify the denominators:

The numerator's denominator is (1 + e/2)^(3/2), and the denominator of the entire fraction is (1 - e) / (1 + e/2). So when you invert and multiply, it becomes:

[ epsilon * sqrt(epsilon/2) ] * (1 + e/2) ) / [ (1 - e) * (1 + e/2)^(3/2) ) ]

Wait, because:

[ a / b ] / [ c / d ] = (a/b) * (d/c) ) = a*d/(b*c)

So in this case, a is epsilon * sqrt(epsilon/2), b is (1 + e/2)^(3/2), c is (1 - e), and d is (1 + e/2).

So Kp = [epsilon * sqrt(epsilon/2) * (1 + e/2) ] / [ (1 - e) * (1 + e/2)^(3/2) ) ]

Simplify the denominator:

(1 + e/2)^(3/2) in the denominator and (1 + e/2) in the numerator. So the denominator becomes (1 + e/2)^(3/2 - 1) = (1 + e/2)^(1/2).

So Kp = [ epsilon * sqrt(epsilon/2) ] / [ (1 - e) * (1 + e/2)^(1/2) ) ]

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let x equal epsilon. So substituting x for epsilon.

So Kp = [ x * sqrt(x/2) ] / [ (1 - x) * sqrt(1 + x/2) ) ]

But Kp is given as 0.647. So,

0.647 = [ x * sqrt(x/2) ] / [ (1 - x) * sqrt(1 + x/2) ) ]

This seems complicated to solve algebraically. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

Squaring both sides:

(0.647)^2 = [ x^2 (x/2) ] / [ (1 - x)^2 (1 + x/2) ) ]

Compute 0.647^2: approximately 0.647 * 0.647. Let's compute 0.6^2 is 0.36, 0.04^2 is 0.0016, but more accurately, 0.647 * 0.647. Let me compute it:

647 * 647 = ?

Well, 600*600=360000, 600*47=28200, 47*600=28200, 47*47=2209. But wait, maybe a better way. Let me compute 0.647^2:

0.647 * 0.647 = (0.6 + 0.047)^2 = 0.6^2 + 2*0.6*0.047 + 0.047^2.

= 0.36 + 0.0564 + 0.002209 = 0.36 +0.0564=0.4164 +0.002209=0.418609.

So approximately 0.4186.

So,

0.4186 = [ x^3 / 2 ] / [ (1 - x)^2 (1 + x/2) ) ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

0.4186 * (1 - x)^2 (1 + x/2) ) = x^3 / 2

Multiply both sides by 2:

0.8372 * (1 - x)^2 (1 + x/2) ) = x^3

Hmm, this is a cubic equation in x. Solving this algebraically might be tough, but perhaps I can plug in the given options to see which epsilon value satisfies this equation.

Looking at the options, each gives an epsilon value. Let's compute for each option the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation 0.8372*(1-x)^2*(1 +x/2) = x^3.

Let's go through each option.

Option A: epsilon = 0.378

Compute LHS: 0.8372 * (1 - 0.378)^2 * (1 + 0.378/2)

1 - 0.378 = 0.622. Squared is 0.622^2 ≈ 0.3868.

0.378/2 = 0.189. So 1 + 0.189 = 1.189.

Multiply: 0.8372 * 0.3868 * 1.189.

Compute step by step:

0.8372 * 0.3868 = Let's approximate. 0.8 * 0.38 = 0.304. 0.0372 * 0.3868 ≈ 0.0144. So total ≈ 0.3184.

Then multiply by 1.189: 0.3184 * 1.189 ≈ 0.3184 *1.2 = 0.382, but subtract 0.3184 *0.089 ≈ 0.0283. So approx 0.382 - 0.0283 = 0.3537.

RHS: x^3 = 0.378^3 ≈ 0.378 * 0.378 = 0.1429, then *0.378 ≈ 0.054.

So LHS is ~0.3537, RHS ~0.054. So 0.3537 ≈ 0.8372*(...) is 0.8372*... which equals 0.3537. Wait, no, wait, in the equation, 0.8372 * ... = x^3, which is 0.054. So 0.3537 is not equal to 0.054. So option A is not correct.

Option B: epsilon=0.278

Compute LHS: 0.8372*(1-0.278)^2*(1+0.278/2)

1-0.278=0.722. Squared is 0.722^2 ≈ 0.521.

0.278/2=0.139. So 1+0.139=1.139.

Multiply: 0.8372 *0.521 *1.139.

First, 0.8372 *0.521: approx 0.8 *0.5=0.4, 0.0372*0.521≈0.0194. So ~0.4194.

Then multiply by 1.139: 0.4194 *1.139 ≈ 0.4194*1=0.4194, 0.4194*0.139≈0.0583. So total ~0.4777.

RHS: 0.278^3 ≈ 0.0215.

But 0.4777 ≈ 0.0215? No. So option B is not correct.

Option C: epsilon=0.178

Compute LHS: 0.8372*(1-0.178)^2*(1+0.178/2)

1-0.178=0.822. Squared is 0.822^2≈0.6757.

0.178/2=0.089. 1+0.089=1.089.

Multiply: 0.8372 *0.6757 *1.089.

0.8372 *0.6757 ≈ let's compute 0.8 *0.6757≈0.5406, plus 0.0372*0.6757≈0.0251. So ~0.5657.

Multiply by 1.089: 0.5657*1.089 ≈ 0.5657*1=0.5657, 0.5657*0.089≈0.0504. So total ~0.6161.

RHS: 0.178^3=0.178 *0.178=0.0317, *0.178≈0.00564.

So LHS is 0.6161, RHS 0.00564. Not matching. So C not correct.

Option D: epsilon=0.578

Compute LHS: 0.8372*(1-0.578)^2*(1+0.578/2)

1-0.578=0.422. Squared is 0.422^2≈0.178.

0.578/2=0.289. So 1+0.289=1.289.

Multiply: 0.8372 *0.178 *1.289.

0.8372 *0.178 ≈ 0.8 *0.178=0.1424, 0.0372*0.178≈0.00662. So ~0.149.

Multiply by 1.289: 0.149 *1.289 ≈ 0.149 *1=0.149, 0.149 *0.289≈0.0431. So total ≈0.192.

RHS: 0.578^3≈0.578 *0.578=0.334, *0.578≈0.193.

So LHS≈0.192, RHS≈0.193. Close! So this seems to match. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 0.8372 * (0.422)^2 * 1.289.

0.422 squared is 0.178.

0.8372 *0.178 = let me compute more accurately.

0.8 *0.178 = 0.1424.

0.0372 *0.178: 0.03 *0.178=0.00534; 0.0072 *0.178=0.00128. So total 0.00534+0.00128=0.00662.

So 0.1424 +0.00662=0.14902.

Multiply by 1.289:

0.14902 *1 =0.14902.

0.14902 *0.289: Let's compute 0.14902 *0.2 =0.029804; 0.14902 *0.08=0.0119216; 0.14902 *0.009=0.00134118. Sum: 0.029804 +0.0119216=0.0417256 +0.00134118≈0.04306. So total 0.14902 +0.04306≈0.19208.

RHS: 0.578^3: 0.578 *0.578= let's compute. 0.5 *0.5=0.25; 0.5*0.078=0.039; 0.078*0.5=0.039; 0.078^2≈0.006084. So 0.25 + 0.039 +0.039 +0.006084 ≈ 0.334084. Then multiply by 0.578:

0.334084 *0.5=0.167042; 0.334084 *0.078≈0.02608.

So sum is 0.167042 +0.02608≈0.19312.

So LHS≈0.192, RHS≈0.193. Very close. So this option seems correct. But let's check other options just to be sure.

Option E: epsilon=0.678

LHS=0.8372*(1-0.678)^2*(1+0.678/2)

1-0.678=0.322. Squared is 0.1036.

0.678/2=0.339. 1+0.339=1.339.

Multiply: 0.8372 *0.1036 *1.339.

0.8372 *0.1036≈0.0868. Multiply by 1.339≈0.1163.

RHS: 0.678^3≈0.678*0.678=0.459, *0.678≈0.311.

So 0.1163 vs 0.311. Not close. So E is not correct.

Option F: epsilon=0.778

LHS: 0.8372*(1-0.778)^2*(1+0.778/2)

1-0.778=0.222. Squared=0.049284.

0.778/2=0.389. 1+0.389=1.389.

Multiply: 0.8372 *0.049284 *1.389.

0.8372 *0.049284 ≈ approx 0.0412. Multiply by1.389≈0.0572.

RHS: 0.778^3≈0.778 *0.778=0.605, *0.778≈0.470.

So 0.0572 vs 0.470. Not close.

Option G: epsilon=0.678 (same as E, I think, but let me check)

Wait, option G's epsilon is same as E? But G's other values are different. But the Kp calculation would be same as E, which we saw didn't match, so G probably not correct.

Similarly, other options have different epsilons, but I think D is the correct one. Also, looking back at the options, option D says:

D: epsilon=0.578, x_CO2=0.327, x_CO=0.448, x_O2=0.225.

Wait, but earlier I computed for epsilon=0.578, and the LHS was 0.192, RHS 0.193, which is very close. But let me compute the mole fractions for this epsilon to see if they match.

At epsilon=0.578:

Mole of CO₂: 1 - 0.578=0.422.

Mole of CO:0.578.

Mole of O₂:0.578/2=0.289.

Total moles:
