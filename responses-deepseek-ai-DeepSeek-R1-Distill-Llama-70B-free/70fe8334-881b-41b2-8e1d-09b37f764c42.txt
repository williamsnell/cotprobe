Question:

A sexually active 23-year-old man with multiple sex partners has dysuria and a yellow urethral exudate. Gram stain of the exudate shows numerous neutrophils, many that contain intracellular gram-negative diplococci. He has had three similar episodes of urethritis over the past 2 years. Which of the following properties of the infecting organism best explains the reinfection?

Options:

A: Resistance to antibiotics
B: Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function
C: Catalase
D: Inhibition of neutrophil function
E: Suppression of host immune response
F: Production of exotoxins
G: High mutation rate
H: Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function
I: Ability to form biofilms
J: Antigenic variation

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a 23-year-old man who's sexually active with multiple partners. He has dysuria, which is painful urination, and a yellow urethral exudate. That sounds like some kind of infection, probably a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The Gram stain shows numerous neutrophils with intracellular gram-negative diplococci. Gram-negative diplococci usually point towards Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea.

He's had three similar episodes over two years, so he's getting this infection multiple times. The question is asking which property of the infecting organism explains the reinfection.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are about various organism properties. I remember that Neisseria gonorrhoeae is known for antigenic variation. Antigenic variation allows the bacteria to change their surface antigens, so the immune system can't effectively target them each time. So even after an infection, the person isn't immune because the next time the bacteria might have different antigens. That would explain why he keeps getting reinfected.

Let me think through the options. Option A is resistance to antibiotics. But that would affect treatment, not necessarily why he gets reinfected. Unless he's not treating it properly, but the question says he's had three episodes, implying he's getting it again each time, so maybe it's about the immune response.

Option B is inhibition of T-lymphocyte function. If the bacteria were somehow suppressing T-cells, that could impair the immune response, but I don't think that's a property of gonococcus.

Option C, catalase. I know some bacteria produce catalase, which breaks down hydrogen peroxide, helping them survive in the body. But does that explain reinfection? Maybe not directly, because it's more about surviving within the host rather than evading the immune memory.

Option D, inhibition of neutrophil function. Neutrophils are the ones in the Gram stain, so they're responding. If the bacteria inhibited neutrophils, maybe the infection would be worse, but again, not sure how that leads to multiple reinfections.

Option E, suppression of host immune response. That's a bit broad. Antigenic variation is a specific way to evade the immune system. Suppression could involve various methods, but the question is about explaining the reinfection, so antigenic variation fits better.

Option F, exotoxins. Those are toxic substances bacteria release. Exotoxins can cause symptoms but don't directly explain why the immune system doesn't recognize the bacteria each time.

Option G, high mutation rate. Mutation can lead to changes, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason for gonorrhea reinfection. Antigenic variation is more specific.

Option H, inhibition of B-lymphocytes. B-lymphocytes produce antibodies. If they're inhibited, the immune response would be weaker. But again, the key here is that the immune system can't recognize the bacteria each time because they change their antigens.

Option I, ability to form biofilms. Biofilms protect bacteria from antibiotics and the immune system. However, I'm not sure if Neisseria gonorrhoeae is known for forming biofilms as a main strategy. Some other bacteria, like Pseudomonas, are more known for that.

Option J, antigenic variation. This makes sense because each time the bacteria infect, they present different antigens. So the antibodies from the previous infection don't work, leading to repeated infections.

So putting it all together, the best answer is J: Antigenic variation.

The patient is a sexually active 23-year-old man with symptoms of urethritis, including dysuria and yellow urethral exudate. The Gram stain reveals intracellular gram-negative diplococci, which strongly suggests *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* as the causative organism. His history of three similar episodes over two years indicates repeated infections, likely due to a property of the bacteria that allows it to evade the host's immune response.

Among the options provided, **antigenic variation** (Option J) is the most plausible explanation. *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* is known for its ability to alter its surface antigens, such as pili proteins, which prevents the immune system from recognizing and effectively targeting the bacteria in subsequent infections. This mechanism allows the bacteria to repeatedly infect the same individual despite previous exposures.

Other options, such as resistance to antibiotics (A), inhibition of neutrophil function (D), or suppression of host immune response (E), do not specifically explain the recurring nature of the infection. Similarly, while biofilm formation (I) and high mutation rates (G) are properties of some pathogens, they are not the primary reason for *N. gonorrhoeae* reinfection.

Thus, the best explanation for the patient's repeated infections is the antigenic variation of the infecting organism.
