Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an electron and a proton separated by a certain distance, and I need to find their gravitational and electrostatic potential energies. Then, calculate the work required against each field when moving the electron closer. Hmm, right, potential energy and work done against fields.

First, I remember that potential energy comes in different forms depending on the force. For gravitational potential energy, the formula is U = - G * (m1 * m2) / r. And for electric potential energy, it's U = k_e * (q1 * q2) / r. Oh wait, and since both are inverse-square laws, the potential energies will change with distance.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the work required to move the electron from 10^-10 meters to 5e-10 meters. So that's moving from a larger separation to a smaller one. Wait, no, actually, the initial separation is 1e-10 m, and then moving to 5e-10 m. Wait, no, wait: 10^-10 m? No, the question says 10^10 m? Wait, no, wait, looking back: the separation is 10^10 m? That can't be right. Oh wait, no, 10^(-10) meters, because in the options the exponents are like 10^58 J, which is a huge number, suggesting a very small distance.

Wait, no, 1e-10 meters is 0.1 nanometers, which is a typical atomic scale. So yeah, that makes sense. So initial r is 1e-10 m, and then moving to 5e-10 m? No, wait, the question says moving to 5 × 10^-10 m? Wait, no, the problem says the initial separation is 1e-10 m, and then the work required to move the electron to a separation of 5e-10 m. Wait, no, wait the question says: moving from 10^10 m? No, wait no: the initial separation is 10^10 m? That seems way too big. Wait, the problem says 10^10 m?

Wait, wait, looking again: the problem states that the electron is separated from a proton by a distance of 10^10 m? That can't be right because 1e10 meters is like 6.7 million kilometers. That's way larger than typical atomic scales. Maybe I misread. Oh wait, no, the question says 10^10 m? Let me check.

Wait, no, the original question says 10^10 m? Let me read it again: "An electron is separated from a proton by a distance of 10^10 m." Oh, that's a huge distance. That's like 10 million kilometers. Wait, but that's way larger than anything in an atom. Okay, maybe it's 10^-10 m? Because that would make more sense for atomic scales. Let me check. The question says "10^10 m". So perhaps it's a typo, but I have to go with what's written.

Wait, no, 10^10 m is 10 billion meters. Hmm. So the initial separation is 1e10 m, and the new separation is 5e10 m? No, wait, the question says: moving to 5 × 10^10 m? Or wait, the problem says 5e-10 m? Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the question says: "move the electron to a position of separation 5 × 10^10 m." Okay, so from 1e10 to 5e10 meters. Hmm. Interesting. So now I need to compute the gravitational and electrostatic potential energies at the initial position, and then find the work done against each field when moving the electron.

Wait, but potential energy is a function of position. The work done against a field is the change in potential energy. So for each field (gravitational and electric), I need to compute the work done when moving from r_initial = 1e10 m to r_final =5e10 m.

Wait, but wait: gravitational potential energy is negative, because gravity is attractive. So when you move two masses further apart, you're doing work against gravity, increasing the potential energy (making it less negative). Similarly, for electric potential energy, since the proton and electron have opposite charges, the potential energy is negative. So moving them apart would require work, making the potential energy less negative.

So the work done against each field is the change in potential energy from initial to final. So W = U_final - U_initial.

Let me break this down into two parts: gravitational and electric.

First, gravitational potential energy.

Gravitational potential energy U_grav is given by U = - G * (m_e * m_p) / r, where G is the gravitational constant. m_e is the mass of the electron, m_p is the mass of the proton.

So the initial U_grav at r=1e10 m is U1 = -G*m_e*m_p/(1e10).

The final U_grav at r=5e10 m is U2 = -G*m_e*m_p/(5e10).

The work done against gravity is W_grav = U2 - U1.

Let me compute this:

W_grav = [ -G m_e m_p / (5e10) ] - [ -G m_e m_p / (1e10) ]

= G m_e m_p [ 1/(1e10) - 1/(5e10) ]

= G m_e m_p [ (5 -1) / (5e10) ) ]

= G m_e m_p (4)/(5e10)

= (4/5) * (G m_e m_p) / (1e10)

Wait, but let me compute the numbers.

G is approximately 6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg².

m_e is about 9.109e-31 kg.

m_p is about 1.673e-27 kg.

So let's compute G*m_e*m_p:

6.6743e-11 * 9.109e-31 * 1.673e-27.

Let me compute this step by step.

6.6743e-11 * 9.109e-31 = 

6.6743 *9.109 = approx 6.6743*9=60.0687, 6.6743*0.109≈0.726, so total approx 60.7947. Exponents: 1e-11 *1e-31 =1e-42. So 60.7947e-42.

Wait, wait, 6.6743e-11 is 6.6743 * 1e-11, 9.109e-31 is 9.109 * 1e-31. Multiply them: (6.6743 *9.109) *1e-42.

6.6743 *9.109: let's compute that more accurately.

6 *9=54, 0.6743*9≈6.0687, 6*0.109≈0.654, 0.6743*0.109≈0.0735. So adding all together: 54 +6.0687 +0.654 +0.0735 ≈60.7962.

So 60.7962e-42.

Now multiply this by 1.673e-27:

60.7962e-42 *1.673e-27 = (60.7962 *1.673) * 1e-69.

Compute 60.7962 *1.673.

60 *1.673 = 100.38.

0.7962 *1.673 ≈ approx 1.331.

So total ≈ 100.38 + 1.331 = 101.711.

So G m_e m_p ≈ 101.711e-69 kg·m³/s².

Wait, wait, but the units would be in joules when considering U, which is energy.

Wait, more accurately, let me compute G m_e m_p:

G = 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

m_p = 1.673e-27 kg.

So G * m_e * m_p = 6.6743e-11 * 9.109e-31 * 1.673e-27.

Compute exponents:

Multiply 1e-11 * 1e-31 = 1e-42, then 1e-42 *1e-27 =1e-69.

Now the coefficients:

6.6743 *9.109 = let's compute accurately.

6 *9 =54, 6*0.109=0.654; 0.6743*9= 6.0687, 0.6743*0.109≈0.0735.

So 6.6743 *9.109 = 6*(9 +0.109) +0.6743*(9 +0.109).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 6.6743 *9.109.

Let me compute 6.6743 *9:

6 *9 =54, 0.6743 *9=6.0687 → 54 +6.0687=60.0687.

6.6743 *0.109:

6 *0.109 =0.654, 0.6743 *0.109 ≈0.0735 → total 0.654 +0.0735=0.7275.

So total 60.0687 +0.7275=60.7962.

Now multiply by 1.673:

60.7962 * 1.673. Let me compute:

60 *1.673 =100.38.

0.7962 *1.673: 0.7 *1.673=1.1711, 0.0962*1.673≈0.1608 → 1.1711 +0.1608≈1.3319.

Total 100.38 +1.3319 =101.7119.

So G m_e m_p ≈101.7119e-69 =1.017119e-67 J·m.

Wait, no: the units would be m³/s² * kg * kg → (m³ kg)/s² → which is energy (joule) times meters? No, wait:

Wait, G has units N·m²/kg² → N is kg·m/s², so G is (kg·m/s²)·m²/kg² → (m³)/(kg·s²).

Then G m_e m_p has units (m³/(kg s²)) * kg * kg → (m³ kg)/s² → which is (kg m²/s²) * m → J·m. So the product G m_e m_p has units J·m.

So when you divide by r (meters), U is in J.

So U_grav = - G m_e m_p / r.

So, back to computing W_grav.

Earlier, I had W_grav = (4/5) * (G m_e m_p) / (1e10 m).

Wait, W_grav = [U2 - U1] = [ - G m_e m_p/(5e10) ) ] - [ - G m_e m_p/(1e10) ) ]

= G m_e m_p ( 1/(1e10) - 1/(5e10) )

= G m_e m_p ( (5 -1)/(5e10) )

= G m_e m_p (4/(5e10)).

So W_grav = (4 G m_e m_p)/(5e10).

Now, G m_e m_p is approximately 1.017e-67 J·m.

So (4 * 1.017e-67) / (5e10) → (4.068e-67) / (5e10) → 8.136e-78 J.

Wait wait, that can't be right, because the options are on the order of 1e58 J. Hmm. Wait, that suggests I made a mistake in calculation somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me redo the calculation.

Compute G m_e m_p:

G =6.6743e-11 m³/kg/s².

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

m_p=1.673e-27 kg.

So G*m_e =6.6743e-11 *9.109e-31 = let's compute the coefficients and exponents.

6.6743e-11 *9.109e-31 = (6.6743 * 9.109) )e-(11+31) = 60.796e-42.

Wait 6.6743e-11 *9.109e-31 = (6.6743 *9.109) )e^(-42).

Wait, 6e-11 *9e-31 is 54e-42, but let me get it accurate.

But then, when I multiply that by m_p=1.673e-27 kg:

So 60.796e-42 kg *1.673e-27 kg → (60.796 *1.673) )e^(-42-27) → 101.71e-69 → 1.0171e-67 kg²·m³/s².

Wait, wait, no: because G has units m³/(kg·s²), m_e and m_p are kg, so G*m_e*m_p would have units m³/(s²). Wait, that's not correct for energy.

Wait, no, potential energy U is in joules (J), which is kg·m²/s².

Wait, let's think in terms of units for G m_e m_p / r.

G has units m³/(kg·s²), m_e and m_p are kg each, r is meters.

So G m_e m_p / r → (m³/(kg·s²)) * kg * kg ) / m → (m³ * kg )/(s²) → kg·m²/s² → J. So that's correct.

So G m_e m_p has units (m³/s²), since (G [m³/(kg s²)]) * m_e [kg] * m_p [kg] ) → m³/(s²) * kg² → (kg² m³)/(s²). But when we divide by r (m), the units become (kg² m²)/(s²), which is kg*(m²/s²)*kg → that’s not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in unit analysis. 

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation numerically.

So G m_e m_p = 6.6743e-11 * 9.109e-31 * 1.673e-27.

Let me compute the exponents:

6.6743e-11 * 9.109e-31 = (6.6743 *9.109) )e-42.

6.6743 *9.109 = approximately 60.796 as before.

So 60.796e-42 → 6.0796e-41.

Then multiply by 1.673e-27:

6.0796e-41 *1.673e-27 = (6.0796 * 1.673) )e-68.

6 *1.673=10.038, 0.0796*1.673≈0.1329 → total ≈10.1709.

So 10.1709e-68 = 1.01709e-67 J·m.

So G m_e m_p ≈1.017e-67 J·m.

Now, W_grav = (4/5) * (G m_e m_p) / (1e10 m).

So (4/5) is 0.8. So 0.8 * (1.017e-67) / (1e10) = 0.8 * 1.017e-77 = 8.136e-78 J.

Wait, that's 8.136e-78 joules. But the options are on the order of 1e58 J for W_G. So this can’t be right. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait a minute, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute G m_e m_p.

Wait, G is 6.6743e-11, m_e is 9.109e-31, m_p is 1.673e-27.

So G * m_e =6.6743e-11 *9.109e-31 = (6.6743 *9.109) *1e-42.

6.6743 *9.109 =60.796.

So 60.796e-42 =6.0796e-41.

Then multiply by m_p=1.673e-27: 6.0796e-41 *1.673e-27 = (6.0796 *1.673) )e-68.

6.0796 *1.673: Let's compute 6 *1.673=10.038, 0.0796 *1.673≈0.1329 → 10.1709.

So 10.1709e-68 =1.01709e-67.

Wait, that's correct. So 1.017e-67 J·m.

So W_grav = (4/5) * (1.017e-67 J·m) / (1e10 m).

Wait, 1e10 m is 1e10 meters.

So 1e10 m is 1e10, so denominator is 1e10.

So (1.017e-67)/(1e10) = 1.017e-77 J.

Multiply by 4/5: 0.8 *1.017e-77 =8.136e-78 J.

That's W_grav. But the options are like 1e58 J. So why is my W_grav so small?

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial separation. Let me re-read the question.

The initial separation is 1e10 m. So 10^10 meters. That's 10 billion meters, which is 10 million kilometers. That's way larger than anything on Earth.

Wait, but in that case, the gravitational potential energy would be extremely small because it's inversely proportional to r. So perhaps the work done is very tiny, but the options suggest a huge number. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the initial separation is actually 1e-10 meters, not 1e10. Because 1e-10 is 0.1
