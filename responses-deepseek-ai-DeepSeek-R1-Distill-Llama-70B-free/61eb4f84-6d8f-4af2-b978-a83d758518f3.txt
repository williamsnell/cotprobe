Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the limit of an integral involving cosine squared as n approaches infinity. Hmm, I remember some concepts from calculus and measure theory that might help here.

Alright, the problem says that E is a measurable subset of (0, 2π), and the Lebesgue measure of E is 2. So E has a length of 2. Then there's this sequence {ξ_n} which is arbitrary, meaning it can be anything. The integral we're looking at is the integral over E of cos²(nx + ξ_n) dx, and we need to find the limit as n goes to infinity.

I remember that cos²(theta) can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Let me recall that. Oh right, cos²(theta) equals (1 + cos(2 theta))/2. So maybe I can rewrite the integrand that way. Let me try that.

So the integral becomes the integral from E of [1 + cos(2(nx + ξ_n))]/2 dx. That simplifies to (1/2) times the integral of 1 over E plus (1/2) times the integral of cos(2(nx + ξ_n)) dx over E.

The first part, (1/2) times the integral of 1 over E, is straightforward. Since the measure of E is 2, that integral is just 2, so (1/2)*2 = 1. So the first term is 1.

Now the tricky part is the second integral: (1/2) times the integral of cos(2(nx + ξ_n)) dx over E. Let me focus on that.

As n approaches infinity, the argument inside the cosine, 2nx + 2ξ_n, becomes very large. Because n is getting huge, the cosine term oscillates rapidly. I think this might relate to the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, which says that the integral of a rapidly oscillating function over an interval tends to zero as the frequency increases. But wait, does that apply here?

The Riemann-Lebesgue lemma states that if f is an integrable function on [a, b], then the limit as k approaches infinity of the integral from a to b of f(x) cos(kx) dx is zero. Similarly for sine. So in this case, our function inside the cosine is 2nx + 2ξ_n. Let me see.

Wait, the cosine function here is cos(2nx + 2ξ_n) which can be written as cos(2n(x + ξ_n)). So as n approaches infinity, for each x in E, the argument 2n(x + ξ_n) oscillates more and more rapidly. But does that mean the integral tends to zero?

Wait, but the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma applies when the function inside is multiplied by a rapidly oscillating term. So in our case, the function is 1 (since it's just the integral of cos(...) ), but multiplied by 1/(2) factor.

But wait, the lemma doesn't directly apply because the argument inside the cosine isn't just k x, but k times (x + ξ_n). Does that affect anything? Let me think. The frequency is determined by the coefficient in front of x. Here, the coefficient is 2n, so as n increases, the frequency goes to infinity. The phase shift ξ_n doesn't matter because cosine is periodic. So even with the ξ_n, the oscillations are still rapid as n increases.

So according to the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, the integral of cos(2n(x + ξ_n)) over E should tend to zero as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the second term, which is (1/2) times that integral, should also tend to zero.

Putting it all together, the limit of the original integral is 1 + 0 = 1.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The set E has measure 2, which is a finite measure. The function inside is bounded because cosine squared is between 0 and 1. So the integral is well-behaved.

Another approach could be to consider average values. The average value of cos²(theta) over a large interval is 1/2. But wait, that would suggest the integral is (1/2)*measure(E) = (1/2)*2 = 1. Which matches what I got earlier.

But wait, in this problem, the argument is nx + ξ_n, which for each n is varying rapidly as n increases. So the average over E should approach the average value of cos², which is 1/2. But wait, no, the average of cos² is 1/2, but when integrated over measure 2, the integral would be 1/2 * 2 = 1. That's consistent.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, cos²(theta) has average 1/2, so integrating over an interval of length L would give L*(1/2). But in our case, after the double angle formula, the integral becomes 1 plus a term that tends to zero. So yeah, the limit is 1.

So the answer should be 1.0, which is option E.

The problem involves finding the limit of the integral 

\[
\lim _{n \to \infty} \int_E \cos^2(nx + \xi_n) \, dx,
\]

where \(E \subset (0, 2\pi)\) is a measurable set with Lebesgue measure 2, and \(\{\xi_n\}\) is an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. To solve this, we use the trigonometric identity 

\[
\cos^2(\theta) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\theta)}{2}.
\]

Substituting this into the integral, we get:

\[
\int_E \cos^2(nx + \xi_n) \, dx = \int_E \frac{1 + \cos(2(nx + \xi_n))}{2} \, dx.
\]

This can be split into two terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_E 1 \, dx + \frac{1}{2} \int_E \cos(2(nx + \xi_n)) \, dx.
\]

The first term is straightforward:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_E 1 \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Lebesgue measure of } E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

For the second term, we note that as \(n \to \infty\), the argument \(2(nx + \xi_n)\) oscillates rapidly. By the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, the integral of a rapidly oscillating function like \(\cos(2(nx + \xi_n))\) over a finite measure set tends to zero. Therefore:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_E \cos(2(nx + \xi_n)) \, dx \to 0 \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
\]

Combining these results, the limit of the original integral is:

\[
\lim _{n \to \infty} \int_E \cos^2(nx + \xi_n) \, dx = 1 + 0 = 1.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

**E: 1.0**
