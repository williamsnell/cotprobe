Okay, so I've got this question about behavioral acts and their typical periods. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that behaviors can be broken down into different phases. Let me think.

I think it's something like this: when an organism is about to perform a behavioral act, it goes through a few stages. The first stage is probably the appetitive behavior. Appetitive, right, that's like the seeking phase. So the animal is looking for something, like food or a mate. They might be searching or exhibiting behaviors that lead them towards the goal.

Then, after the seeking, comes the consummatory act. That's when they actually perform the action that fulfills the need, like eating the food or completing the mate selection. So that's the second phase.

Finally, after that, there's a period of quiescence. Quiescence means a state of rest or inactivity, so after the goal is achieved, the organism stops that particular behavior and rests. 

Putting it all together, the order should be appetitive, then consummatory, then quiescence. Let me look at the options. 

Option C says appetitive, consummatory act, quiescence. That matches what I was thinking. 

Wait, are there any other options that might fit? Let me check. Option A has appetitive, exploratory, quiescence. But I thought exploratory was part of appetitive. Or maybe exploratory is a different term. Oh wait, sometimes appetitive might be called the exploratory phase because the organism is exploring the environment seeking the stimulus. But in the standard model, appetitive is the seeking, consummatory is the act, then quiescence. So option C seems correct.

The unfolding of a behavioral act typically follows three phases: appetitive behavior, consummatory act, and quiescence. Appetitive behavior refers to the seeking phase, where the organism searches for a goal, such as food or a mate. This is followed by the consummatory act, where the organism performs the action that fulfills the need, such as eating or completing the mate selection. Finally, quiescence occurs, a state of rest or inactivity after the goal is achieved. Among the options provided, option C correctly identifies this sequence: appetitive behavior, consummatory act, quiescence.

Answer: C
