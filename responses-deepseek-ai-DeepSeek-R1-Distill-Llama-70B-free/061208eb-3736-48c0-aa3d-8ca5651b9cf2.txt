Okay, so I've got this problem about Mercury orbiting the Sun, and I need to find out how long it takes using Newton's version of Kepler's third law. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

First, what's Newton's version of Kepler's third law? I remember it's an equation that relates the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the Sun. I think the formula is something like T squared equals (4π²/G(M+m)) times r cubed. But wait, since the Sun is so much more massive than Mercury, the mass of Mercury is negligible here. So the formula simplifies to T² = (4π² * r³) / (G * M), where M is the mass of the Sun.

Right, so I need to plug in the values. The given mean orbital radius r is 5.8e10 meters. The mass of the Sun M is 1.99e30 kg. Oh, and I need to find T in Earth days.

Let's list what I know:
- G is the gravitational constant, which I think is 6.674e-11 N·m²/kg².
- π is about 3.1416.
- The orbital period T is what I'm solving for, so I'll solve for T.

Putting the numbers into the formula:

T² = (4 * π² * (5.8e10)^3) / (6.674e-11 * 1.99e30)

Wait, let me calculate the numerator and the denominator separately to avoid mistakes.

First, compute the numerator: 4 * π² * (5.8e10)^3.

Calculating (5.8e10)^3:
5.8 cubed is 5.8 *5.8=33.64, then 33.64 *5.8. Let me compute that. 33.64 *5 is 168.2, 33.64*0.8 is 26.912, so total 195.112. So (5.8)^3 is 195.112. Then it's 195.112e30, but wait, no, 5.8e10 cubed is (5.8)^3 * (1e10)^3) = 195.112 * 1e30 = 1.95112e32 m³.

Then multiply by 4 * π². Let's compute 4 * (π²). π² is about 9.8696, so 4 *9.8696≈39.4784.

So numerator = 39.4784 * 1.95112e32 = let's compute that. 39.4784 *1.95112 is approximately... 39 *2 is 78, but let's be precise. 39.4784 *1.95112. Let me compute 39.4784 * 2 =78.9568, but since it's 1.95112, which is about 2 - 0.04888. So 39.4784 * 1.95112 = 39.4784*(2 - 0.04888) = 78.9568 - (39.4784 *0.04888). Let me compute 39.4784 *0.04888. 39.4784 *0.04 is 1.579, and 39.4784 *0.00888 is approx 0.3505. So total ≈1.579+0.3505=1.9295. So 78.9568 -1.9295=77.0273. So numerator ≈77.0273e32 m³, but wait actually, the calculation is 39.4784 *1.95112e32 = let me compute the exact number.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 5.8^3 is 5.8 *5.8 =33.64, then 33.64 *5.8. Let's compute 33.64 *5=168.2, 33.64 *0.8=26.912, sum 168.2+26.912=195.112. So (5.8e10)^3=195.112e30 m³. So 195.112e30 = 1.95112e32 m³.

Then 4π² is about 4*(9.8696) = 39.4784.

So 39.4784 * 1.95112e32 = 39.4784 * 1.95112 = approx 77.027e32? Let me compute 39.4784 * 1.95112.

Let me compute 39.4784 *1.95112:

39.4784 * 1 =39.4784
39.4784 *0.9=35.53056
39.4784 *0.05=1.97392
39.4784 *0.00112= approx 0.04422
Adding all together: 39.4784 +35.53056=75.00896 +1.97392=76.98288 +0.04422=77.0271.

So numerator is 77.0271e32 m³. Wait, no, because 1.95112e32 is 1.95112 times 1e32, so 77.0271 times 1e32 would be 7.70271e33? Wait, no, 39.4784 * 1.95112e32 = (39.4784 *1.95112) *1e32 = 77.0271 *1e32 =7.70271e33 m³.

Wait, no, wait. Because 1.95112e32 is 1.95112 *1e32. So when I multiply that by 39.4784, I get 39.4784 *1.95112 =77.0271, so 77.0271e32 =7.70271e33 m³. So numerator is 7.70271e33 m³.

Wait, no, wait another approach. 5.8e10^3 = (5.8)^3 *1e30. So 5.8^3 is 195.112, so 195.112e30 m³. Then 4π² is 39.478, so 39.478 *195.112e30 = let's compute 39.478 *195.112.

39 *195=7605, 0.478*195≈93.21, so 7605+93.21=7698.21. So approximately 7698.21e30 m³. So 7.69821e33 m³. Hmm, I think I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps exact calculation.

4π² = 39.4784176.

r^3 = (5.8e10)^3 = 195.112e30 m³ = 1.95112e32 m³.

So 4π² * r^3 = 39.4784176 * 1.95112e32.

39.4784176 * 1.95112 = let me compute that.

39 *1.95112 =76.0 (approx), 0.4784176 *1.95112≈0.934. So total approx 76.934.

So 4π² r^3 =76.934e32 m³ =7.6934e33 m³.

Wait, but 1e32 multiplied by 76.934 gives 7.6934e33. So numerator is 7.6934e33.

Denominator is G*M =6.674e-11 *1.99e30.

Let me compute that: 6.674e-11 *1.99e30 = (6.674 *1.99) *1e( -11 +30 )= (13.27) *1e19 =1.327e20.

Wait, 6.674 * 1.99. Let's compute that.

6 *1.99=11.94; 0.674 *1.99≈1.340 (because 0.6 *1.99=1.194; 0.074*1.99≈0.147; sum to 1.341). So total is approx 11.94 +1.341=13.281. So 6.674e-11 *1.99e30 =13.281e19 =1.3281e20.

So denominator is 1.3281e20.

Now, T² = numerator / denominator = (7.6934e33) / (1.3281e20) = (7.6934 /1.3281) *1e(33-20) = approximately 5.795 *1e13.

Wait, 7.6934 divided by 1.3281. Let's compute that.

1.3281 *5=6.6405. 7.6934-6.6405=1.0529 left. 1.3281 *0.79≈1.050. So approximately 5.79.

So T²=5.79e13 seconds squared.

Wait, but what's T? T is the square root of 5.79e13 seconds.

So compute sqrt(5.79e13) = sqrt(5.79)*1e6.5.

Wait, sqrt(5.79) is about 2.4055, because 2.4^2=5.76, 2.405^2= (2.4 +0.005)^2=5.76 + 2*2.4*0.005 + (0.005)^2 =5.76+0.024+0.000025=5.784025. Close enough.

So sqrt(5.79e13) =2.4055e6.5 seconds. Wait, 1e6.5 is 1e6 * sqrt(10) ≈3.1623e6. So 2.4055 *3.1623 ≈7.6e6 seconds.

Wait, alternatively, 1e13 is (1e6.5)^2, so sqrt(5.79e13)=sqrt(5.79)*1e6.5 = approx 2.4055 * 3.1623e6 = let's compute 2.4055 *3.1623.

2.4 *3=7.2, 0.0055 *3=0.0165, 2.4 *0.1623≈0.3895, 0.0055*0.1623≈0.00089. Adding up: 7.2 +0.0165=7.2165 +0.3895=7.606 +0.00089≈7.60689. So approximately 7.60689e6 seconds.

So T ≈7.60689e6 seconds.

Now, convert seconds to Earth days.

We know that 1 day is 86400 seconds (24*3600). So number of days is T / 86400.

Compute 7.60689e6 /86400.

Let me compute 7.60689e6 /8.64e4 = (7.60689 /8.64) *1e2.

Compute 7.60689 /8.64. Let's see, 8.64 goes into 7.60689 approximately 0.88 times. Because 8.64 *0.8=6.912, 8.64*0.88=7.6032. Oh, that's close to 7.60689.

So approximately 0.88 *1e2=88 days.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

7.60689e6 / 86400 =7606890 / 86400.

Let me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 760689 /8640.

Hmm, let me compute 8640 *88 = 8640*(80+8)= 8640*80=691200; 8640*8=69120 → 691200+69120=760320.

So 8640 *88=760320. The numerator is 760689, which is 760320 +369=760689.

So 760689 /8640 =88 + 369/8640.

369/8640 = approximately 0.0427 (since 8640 *0.04=345.6, 8640 *0.0427= approx 369).

So total is 88.0427 days.

Wait, that's about 88 days. Looking at the options, option I is 88.3, which is close.

But wait, let me recalculate the exact T².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Alternative approach: Compute T² = (4π² r³) / (G M)

Compute each part step by step.

r =5.8e10 m.

r³ = (5.8e10)^3 =5.8^3 *1e30 =195.112e30 =1.95112e32 m³.

4π² = 4*(π)^2 ≈4*(9.8696)≈39.4784.

So 4π² r³ =39.4784 *1.95112e32 = (39.4784 *1.95112) *1e32.

Compute 39.4784 *1.95112:

Ok, 39 *1.95112 = 76.03388.

0.4784 *1.95112 = let's compute 0.4 *1.95112=0.780448; 0.0784 *1.95112≈0.1528. So total 0.780448+0.1528≈0.933248.

So total 76.03388 +0.933248=76.967128.

So 4π² r³ =76.967128e32 =7.6967128e33 m³.

Denominator: G M =6.674e-11 *1.99e30 =6.674*1.99e19.

6.674 *1.99 = let's compute that.

6 *1.99=11.94; 0.674 *1.99.

0.674 *2=1.348 → minus 0.674 *0.01=0.00674 →1.348-0.00674=1.34126.

Total is 11.94 +1.34126=13.28126.

So denominator is 13.28126e19 =1.328126e20.

So T² =7.6967e33 /1.328126e20 = (7.6967 /1.328126) *1e13.

Compute 7.6967 /1.328126.

Let me do this division: 1.328126 *5=6.64063 → 7.6967-6.64063=1.05607 left.

Now, 1.328126 *0.8=1.0625008. Oh, that's just a bit over 1.05607. So 0.8 would give 1.0625, which is a little more than 1.05607. So perhaps 0.794.

So 5.794.

So T²=5.794e13 s².

T = sqrt(5.794e13) = sqrt(5.794)*1e6.5 s.

sqrt(5.794)=approx 2.4075.

1e6.5 is sqrt(1e13) =1e6.5=3.1623e6. So 2.4075 *3.1623e6 ≈7.617e6 seconds.

Convert 7.617e6 seconds to days.

7.617e6 s / (86400 s/day) =7617000 /86400 ≈ let's compute.

Compute 86400 *88 = 7,603,200.

7,617,000 -7,603,200 =13,800.

13,800 /86400 =0.16 days (since 86400 *0.16=13,824, which is a bit more than 13,800 → so approximately 0.16 days.

So total is 88.16 days.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:84.1

B:120.4

C:59.5

D:50.1

E:102.7

F:100.5

G:95.8

H:76.0

I:88.3

J:70.2

So option I is 88.3, which is close to our calculation of 88.16. So the answer should be I:88.3.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation because I remember that Mercury's orbital period is actually about 88 days. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps using another approach, like SI units, and then convert to days.

Wait, another approach: use the formula in astronomical units and years, but that might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute T² = (4π²/GM) * r³.

Wait, perhaps using more precise values.

Compute r³: (5.8e10)^3 = (5.8)^3 *1e30 =195.112e30 =1.95112e32 m³.

4π²=39.4784176.

Multiply 39.4784176 *1.95112e32:

=39.4784176 *1.95112 =76.9672 →76.9672e32 =7.69672e33.

Denominator: G*M=6.67430e-11 *1.9885e30 (wait, the mass is given as 1.99e30, but perhaps more accurately, the Sun's mass is 1.9885e30 kg. But the question says 1.99e30, so we'll stick with that.

So G*M=6.674e-11 *1.99e30 = as before, 1.328126e20.

So T^2 =7.69672e33 /1.328126e20 = (7.69672 /1.328126) *1e13.

7.69672 /1.328126 ≈5.8 seconds squared? Wait, no, 7.69672 /1.328126 is approximately 5.8?

Wait, 1.328126 *5=6.64063. Which is less than 7.69672.

Wait, 1.328126 *5.8= let's compute
