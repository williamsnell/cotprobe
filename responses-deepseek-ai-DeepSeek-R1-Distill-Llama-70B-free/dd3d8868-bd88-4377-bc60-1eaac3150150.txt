Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Mesopotamian civilization, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking which factor was NOT a deciding factor in the development of Mesopotamian civilization. The options are from A to J. I need to pick the one that didn't play a crucial role.

Hmm, I remember that Mesopotamia is considered one of the cradles of civilization. So what were the key factors there? Let me think. The Sumerians were one of the earliest civilizations there, right? They had city-states like Ur and Uruk. 

So, the first thing that comes to mind is irrigation. They relied heavily on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which were unpredictable. So they must have developed irrigation systems to manage water for agriculture. That would tie into option D, the use of irrigation to produce enough food. So D was definitely a factor, which means it's not the correct answer.

Then there's the development of a written language. Cuneiform, I think it's called. They used it for record-keeping, trade, and maybe even literature. So option J, the need to develop a written language, was important. So J is not the answer either.

Agriculture would require planning, so they needed a calendar system. Option B talks about that. Early calendars were based on lunar cycles, I believe, which helped in planning planting and harvesting. So B was a factor.

The construction of monumental works like ziggurats (which are step-pyramids) and temples would have required a complex social system. So option G was important for their development. And that relates to option C, which mentions canals. Oh wait, C says the need to develop a complex social system for constructing canals. Wait, canals are part of irrigation, so yes, that required organization and a social structure. So C was a factor.

The need for a centralized government, option I, makes sense too. City-states had governments, maybe with kings or priests. Law and order would be essential, so I is a factor.

What about a military force? Option E. They had armies for defense and sometimes conquest, especially as city-states competed. So E was a factor.

Domesticated animals, option F. They used animals for labor and transport, like oxen for plowing and donkeys or horses for moving goods. So F was important.

Now, looking at the options, the ones I haven't considered yet are A and H. Option A is the need to form alliances for trade and protection. I think early Mesopotamia was more about city-states that sometimes fought each other, but they did trade. Maybe alliances were formed, but were they a deciding factor in the initial development? Or was it more about managing internally?

Option H says the need to concentrate population away from arable lands near rivers. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Mesopotamia's population concentrated near the rivers because that's where the fertile land was. They relied on rivers for irrigation, so people settled there. If H is suggesting they moved away from arable lands, that seems incorrect. So H would be the factor that wasn't a deciding factor because they actually concentrated near the rivers, not away.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about what was NOT a factor. So if H says they concentrated population away from arable lands, that's the opposite of what actually happened. They built cities near the rivers because the land was productive. So H would be something that didn't influence their development because they did the opposite.

But wait, what's option H exactly? It says "the need to concentrate population away from arable lands near rivers." So if the need was to move people away, that wasn't a factor. But in reality, the population concentrated near the rivers because of the fertile land. So H would be incorrect as a factor, making it the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think of each option again. What was each factor about.

Option H: Concentrate population away from arable lands? That would be counterproductive. Why would they do that? They needed the land for farming, so people lived near the rivers where the soil was good. So the need to move away wasn't a factor; in fact, the opposite was true.

So the correct answer would be H because it's the opposite of what actually happened in Mesopotamia. The other options all played roles in their development.

To determine which factor was NOT a deciding factor in the development of Mesopotamian civilization, it is important to analyze each option in the context of Mesopotamian history and development:

- **Option A**: The need to form alliances with neighboring civilizations for trade and protection was relevant, as Mesopotamian city-states often traded and sometimes formed alliances, though they also frequently competed or conflicted.
- **Option B**: The need to develop a calendar system for agricultural planning was crucial, as agriculture relied on seasonal cycles and the management of the rivers.
- **Option C**: The need to develop a complex social system for constructing canals was essential, as irrigation systems required organization and labor.
- **Option D**: The use of irrigation to produce enough food was fundamental, as Mesopotamia's agriculture depended on managing the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
- **Option E**: The creation of a military force for defense and conquest was important, as city-states often had armies for protection and expansion.
- **Option F**: The use of domesticated animals for labor and transportation was significant, as animals like oxen and donkeys were vital for agriculture and trade.
- **Option G**: The need to construct monumental works, such as step-pyramids and temples, was a key factor, as these projects reflected the social and religious organization of the civilization.
- **Option H**: The need to concentrate population away from arable lands near rivers is incorrect, as the population concentrated near the rivers due to the fertile land and access to water for irrigation. This option describes the opposite of what actually occurred.
- **Option I**: The establishment of a centralized government for law and order was important, as city-states had governing structures to maintain order and manage resources.
- **Option J**: The need to develop a written language for record-keeping and communication was crucial, as cuneiform was central to administration, trade, and cultural expression.

The correct answer is **H**, as Mesopotamian civilization developed by concentrating populations near arable lands and rivers, not away from them. This makes H the factor that was NOT a deciding factor in their development.

Answer: H
