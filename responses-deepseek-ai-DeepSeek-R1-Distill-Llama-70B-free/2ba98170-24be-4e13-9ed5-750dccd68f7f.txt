Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this logic problem. The question is about translating an English statement into predicate logic. The statement is: "Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad." Hmm, I need to break this down.

First, I remember that "if and only if" in logic is represented by the biconditional symbol, which is like two arrows pointing at each other, or in symbols, ≡. So the structure here is an biconditional statement connecting two parts.

Now, I need to parse each part. The first part is "Caroline is sweet." Let's assign some variables here. Let's say that S(x) means "x is sweet," so Caroline being sweet would be S(C) or maybe S_c, depending on how the notation is set up. Wait, looking at the answer options, I see things like Sx, Jy, etc. So maybe the notation is using capital letters for predicates and lowercase for variables or constants? Or perhaps each letter represents a predicate with a single argument, like S for sweet, E for engaged, etc., and the lowercase letters represent the individuals—c for Caroline, j for Janet, b for Brad.

So, Caroline is sweet would be S(c), right? Or maybe in the options, it's written as Sc. Like, S followed by c. So Sc would mean Caroline is sweet.

Then the second part: "Janet is engaged to Brad." Let's assign E as the engaged predicate. But wait, being engaged to someone is a two-place predicate, right? So E(j, b) would mean Janet is engaged to Brad. But looking at the options, I don't see any with two letters after E, except maybe Ej or something. Wait, no, in the options, each predicate seems to have only one variable after it. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the notation is simplified. Maybe E is used as a one-place predicate, but that doesn't make sense because being engaged typically involves two people. Alternatively, maybe each letter combination represents a specific relationship. Like, Ej could mean Janet is engaged, but that doesn't specify to whom. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, the original statement is about Janet being engaged to Brad. So perhaps the predicate is E, and it's applied to both Janet and Brad, but in the options, maybe they're using a different notation. Like, Ej could represent Janet being engaged, but then how do we denote to whom she's engaged? Maybe in this context, it's assumed that E is a two-place predicate, but in the options, they're only showing one variable. Or perhaps the options are using a different notation style.

Alternatively, maybe each individual is represented by a letter, so Janet is j, Brad is b. So E(j, b) would mean Janet is engaged to Brad. But looking at the answer choices, I don't see any with two variables after a predicate. All the options have single letters after the predicates, like Ej, Cs, etc.

Wait, maybe the notation is such that each person is a constant, and the predicates are one-place. So S(c) would be Caroline is sweet, and E(j) would be Janet is engaged, but that doesn't capture the "to Brad" part. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps each predicate is unique to the pair. Like, Ej could stand for "Janet is engaged to Brad," where E is a specific predicate that already includes Brad as the second argument. But that might not be the standard way.

Wait, let me think again. The original statement is a biconditional: Caroline is sweet iff Janet is engaged to Brad. So in logic terms, that would be S(c) ≡ E(j, b). But looking at the answer choices, none seem to have two variables after E. So perhaps they're using a different notation, like E_j_b, but that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps each option is using a different notation where the second letter is the object. So Ej could mean Janet is engaged to Brad, assuming j is Janet and b is Brad, but it's written as E followed by j, and maybe implicitly to Brad. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Alternatively, maybe the options are using a different approach. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is Sc ≡ Ej. So Sc would be Caroline is sweet, and Ej would be Janet is engaged? But then where's Brad? That doesn't seem to include Brad.

Wait, maybe the options are using a different predicate for each relation. Like, E could be "engaged to Brad," so Ej would mean Janet is engaged to Brad. So E is a one-place predicate that means "engaged to Brad." That could make sense. So if E is a predicate that takes a person and means they are engaged to Brad, then Ej would mean Janet is engaged to Brad.

In that case, the statement would be S(c) ≡ E(j), which would translate to Sc ≡ Ej, assuming Sc is the notation for S(c). So looking at the options, that's option C: Sc ≡ Ej.

Wait, but in the options, Sc is written as Sc, which I'm interpreting as S(c). Similarly, Ej would be E(j). So yes, that makes sense.

Let me double-check. The original statement is "Caroline is sweet if and only if Janet is engaged to Brad." So S(c) is "Caroline is sweet," and "Janet is engaged to Brad" would be E(j), where E is the predicate that means "engaged to Brad." So the biconditional would be S(c) ≡ E(j), which in the options is written as Sc ≡ Ej, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the predicates are set up differently. Like, maybe E is a two-place predicate, but in the options, they're only showing one variable. But that's not matching any of the options, so I think the correct approach is to treat E as a one-place predicate meaning engaged to Brad. So option C seems correct.

The question asks for the best translation of the statement "Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad" into predicate logic. The phrase "if and only if" indicates a biconditional relationship, represented by the symbol ≡. 

The statement can be broken into two parts:
1. "Caroline is sweet" can be represented as \( S(c) \), where \( S \) is the predicate for "is sweet" and \( c \) stands for Caroline.
2. "Janet is engaged to Brad" can be represented as \( E(j) \), where \( E \) is a one-place predicate meaning "is engaged to Brad" and \( j \) stands for Janet.

Combining these, the biconditional statement becomes \( S(c) \equiv E(j) \). In the given options, this is represented as \( Sc \equiv Ej \), where \( Sc \) corresponds to \( S(c) \) and \( Ej \) corresponds to \( E(j) \).

Thus, the correct translation is option C: \( Sc \equiv Ej \).
