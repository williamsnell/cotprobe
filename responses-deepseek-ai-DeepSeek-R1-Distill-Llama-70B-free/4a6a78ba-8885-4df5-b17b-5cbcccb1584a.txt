Okay, so I have this question about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence is "Johnny came late." And I need to choose the correct translation from the given options.

Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I remember that in predicate logic, we usually have predicates and variables. So, first, I should break down the sentence.

"Johnny came late." The subject is Johnny, and the action is coming late. So, I think "came late" would be a predicate. Let me denote that. Maybe L(j) for "Johnny came late," where L is the predicate meaning "came late" and j represents Johnny.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see things like Lj, Cj, etc. Oh, right, sometimes predicates are written without parentheses, so Lj would mean L(j), and Cj would mean C(j). So the sentence would translate to Lj if L stands for "came late."

Wait, but let me check. The options are:

A: Lj ∨ Cj
B: Lj
C: L∧j
D: jC
E: j ∨ L
F: Lj ∧ Cj
G: Cj ∨ Lj
H: Lx
I: jL
J: Cx

So the options are using either L or C as predicates, and j as the subject.

Wait, in the question, the sentence is "Johnny came late." So "came late" is the predicate. So if L stands for "came late," then Lj would be "Johnny came late." That would make option B correct because it's Lj.

But wait, maybe C stands for "came" and then there's another predicate for "late." No, I don't think so because "came late" is a single predicate here. So the correct translation should be a single predicate applied to Johnny.

So looking at the options, option B is Lj, which would mean L(j), so that's correct. Option I is jL, but that's just switching the order, which might not be standard. I think predicates usually come first, so Lj makes more sense.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes in logic, the subject comes first, but in predicate logic, it's usually predicate followed by the argument. So Lj would mean L applied to j, which is correct.

So I think the answer is B: Lj.

The sentence "Johnny came late" is translated into predicate logic by treating "came late" as a predicate L and Johnny as the subject j. Thus, the correct translation is Lj, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
