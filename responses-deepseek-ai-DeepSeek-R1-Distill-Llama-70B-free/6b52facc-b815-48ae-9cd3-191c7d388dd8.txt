Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the hydronium ion concentration in a 0.1 M acetic acid solution. They give the Ka as 1.75 x 10^-5. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. That means I can't just take the concentration as 0.1 M for H3O+ ions.

Alright, let's think about the dissociation of acetic acid. The formula is HOAc ⇌ H+ + OAc^- (where OAc is the acetate ion). Since it's a weak acid, the concentration of H+ will be much less than 0.1 M. 

I think I should set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to model this. So initially, the concentration of HOAc is 0.1 M, and both H+ and OAc^- are 0 because it hasn't dissociated yet.

Let's denote the change as x. So at equilibrium, HOAc will decrease by x, and both H+ and OAc^- will increase by x. So the concentrations at equilibrium are [HOAc] = 0.1 - x, [H+] = x, and [OAc^-] = x.

The Ka expression is Ka = [H+][OAc^-] / [HOAc]. Plugging in the values, that becomes 1.75e-5 = (x)(x) / (0.1 - x). 

Wait, but since Ka is small (1.75e-5 is much less than 1), x should be much smaller than 0.1. So I can approximate 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. That should simplify the equation to 1.75e-5 ≈ x² / 0.1. 

Rearranging, x² ≈ 1.75e-5 * 0.1. Let me calculate that. 1.75e-5 times 0.1 is 1.75e-6. Taking the square root of that gives x ≈ sqrt(1.75e-6). 

What's the square root of 1.75e-6? Let's see, sqrt(1.75) is about 1.322, and sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3. So 1.322e-3, which is about 0.00132 M. 

So the hydronium ion concentration is approximately 0.00132 M. Looking at the options, option C is 0.0013 M, which is really close. So I'm guessing option C is the right answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any assumptions that might not hold? I assumed that x is much smaller than 0.1, but let me check the approximation. If x is 0.0013, then 0.1 - 0.0013 is 0.0987, which is approximately 0.0987. So the approximation holds because 0.0013 is about 1.3% of 0.1, which is probably acceptable. So the calculation should be accurate enough.

Alternatively, if I don't make the approximation, I can set up the quadratic equation. So, 1.75e-5 = x²/(0.1 - x). Multiply both sides by (0.1 - x):

x² = 1.75e-5 (0.1 - x)
x² = 1.75e-6 - 1.75e-5 x
Bring all terms to one side:
x² + 1.75e-5 x - 1.75e-6 = 0

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)] / 2a, where a=1, b=1.75e-5, c=-1.75e-6.

Discriminant D = (1.75e-5)^2 + 4 * 1 * 1.75e-6.

Calculating that: (3.0625e-10) + (7e-6) = approx 7.00030625e-6. The square root of D is about sqrt(7.0003e-6) ≈ 0.0026458.

So x = [-1.75e-5 ± 0.0026458]/2. Taking the positive root:

( -1.75e-5 + 0.0026458 ) / 2 ≈ (0.0026308) / 2 ≈ 0.0013154 M, which is about 0.001315 M. So the approximation was pretty good, and the exact value is about 0.001315 M, which is 0.0013 when rounded to three significant figures. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine the hydronium ion concentration \([H_3O^+]\) in a 0.1 M acetic acid (HOAc) solution, we start by recognizing that acetic acid is a weak acid with a given \(K_a = 1.75 \times 10^{-5}\). The dissociation of acetic acid can be represented as:

\[
\text{HOAc} \leftrightharpoons H^+ + \text{OAc}^-
\]

Using an ICE table, the initial concentrations are:
- \([HOAc] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\),
- \([H^+] = 0 \, \text{M}\),
- \([\text{OAc}^-] = 0 \, \text{M}\).

At equilibrium, let the change in concentration of \(H^+\) and \(\text{OAc}^-\) be \(x\). Then:
- \([HOAc] = 0.1 - x\),
- \([H^+] = x\),
- \([\text{OAc}^-] = x\).

The \(K_a\) expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][\text{OAc}^-]}{[HOAc]} = \frac{x^2}{0.1 - x}.
\]

Since \(K_a\) is small, \(x\) is expected to be much smaller than 0.1, so \(0.1 - x \approx 0.1\). Substituting this approximation:

\[
K_a \approx \frac{x^2}{0.1}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = K_a \cdot 0.1 = (1.75 \times 10^{-5})(0.1) = 1.75 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{1.75 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.00132 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the hydronium ion concentration is approximately \(0.00132 \, \text{M}\), which rounds to \(0.0013 \, \text{M}\).

To verify the approximation, solving the quadratic equation without simplification yields a value of \(x \approx 0.001315 \, \text{M}\), confirming that the approximation is valid. Therefore, the hydronium ion concentration is \(0.0013 \, \text{M}\), corresponding to option C.
