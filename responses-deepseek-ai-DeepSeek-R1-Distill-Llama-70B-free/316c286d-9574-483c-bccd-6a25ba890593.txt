Question:

A college student and her boyfriend lived together in a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, "not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, so there's a college student and her boyfriend living together. They bought a parcel of land. The deed says they're joint tenants with the right of survivorship. So, under joint tenancy, when one dies, the other gets the whole property, right? That's the key featureâ€”the right of survivorship.

Now, the boyfriend is having financial trouble and wants to sell the property. So he offers it to a coworker. But here's the catch: he does this without the student's knowledge. He executes a deed, forging the student's name, and delivers it to the coworker. The coworker pays $150k, which is the fair market value, and then records the deed right away.

The question is about who owns the property now. The options are various combinations: some say the coworker owns it outright, others say it's still with the original two, or maybe all three.

I remember that in joint tenancy, each has an undivided right to the whole property. So if one joint tenant sells their interest, it's supposed to sever the joint tenancy, turning it into a tenancy in common. But wait, does that apply here?

Wait, but the boyfriend forged the student's signature. So the deed from the boyfriend and the student (forged) to the coworker. So the issue is whether the coworker gets good title.

At common law, for a deed to be effective, it needs a proper execution. So if one of the grantors' signatures is forged, that's a problem. But if the grantee is a bona fide purchaser (BFP), they might be protected.

Wait, what's a BFP? They're someone who pays value without notice of any defects in the title. So here, the coworker paid the fair market value. Did they have any notice that the student didn't sign? The scenario doesn't say anything about that, so I assume the coworker had no knowledge and no reason to know.

But wait, the deed was forged. So the student didn't actually convey her interest. So does the coworker get the boyfriend's interest, but not the student's?

Because in joint tenancy, each owns the whole, but their interest is such that upon death, it goes to the survivor. So if the boyfriend tries to sell his interest, does that sever the joint tenancy? Or does it just mean the coworker gets whatever interest the boyfriend had?

Wait, when a joint tenant sells their interest, it's supposed to sever the joint tenancy as to that part, turning the ownership into a tenancy in common between the other joint tenant and the buyer. But in this case, the student's signature was forged. So the sale by the boyfriend, with a forged signature, would only convey his own interest, but not the student's.

But wait, the deed was executed by both the boyfriend and the student (forged). So if the coworker is a BFP, they might take the property free of any claims, even if the deed was forged. Because a BFP's rights are protected against forged deeds if they had no knowledge and paid value.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. If the boyfriend and the student are joint tenants, each has the right to the entire property. If the boyfriend forges the student's name and sells to the coworker, what happens?

In some jurisdictions, a forged deed can be treated as a wildcard. If the grantee (coworker) is a BFP, they might take the property, even though one signature was forged. Because the BFP rule protects them from prior defects if they had no knowledge.

But wait, I think the common law rule is that a deed requires delivery. But if the grantor (here, the boyfriend) delivers the deed, even if it's forged, the grantee might take it. But in this case, the boyfriend was only one of the joint tenants. So he couldn't convey the entire property without the student's consent. Or could he?

Wait, in joint tenancy, each has the right to the whole. So if the boyfriend sells his interest, he can only convey his own share, which upon sale would sever the joint tenancy. So the coworker would become a tenant in common with the student. But wait, the forged deed says that both are conveying as joint tenants. But since the student didn't actually sign, her interest isn't conveyed.

So the coworker would get whatever interest the boyfriend could convey. But the boyfriend, as a joint tenant, can only convey his own interest, which would sever the joint tenancy. So the student and the coworker would become tenants in common. But wait, the student didn't agree to this, so does the coworker get any interest?

Alternatively, if the coworker is a BFP, they might take the entire property because they had no notice of the forgery. But I'm not sure if that applies here. The common law has the rule that a purchaser for value without notice can take the property, even if the deed was forged, because the forger's authority binds the true owner in certain situations.

Wait, but in this case, the boyfriend didn't have authority to sign for the student. So the deed from the student is forged. So the student's interest isn't conveyed. The coworker would only get the boyfriend's interest. So the student's interest remains, and the coworker gets the boyfriend's. So now, the student and coworker are tenants in common.

But wait, the deed that the coworker received was from both the student and the boyfriend, but the student's signature was forged. So from the coworker's perspective, they think they're buying the entire property. But in reality, only the boyfriend's interest was conveyed.

So the title would now be the coworker and the student as tenants in common. Because the joint tenancy was severed when the boyfriend transferred his interest, even though the student's part was forged.

Wait, but the initial conveyance was as joint tenants. So when the boyfriend tried to sell the entire property, but only had the authority to sell his own share, the coworker gets his share, and the student's remains. So the title is now coworker and student as tenants in common.

Looking at the options, option G says the coworker and the student as tenants in common. Option J says the student owns it all, which can't be right because the boyfriend did convey something.

Wait, but wait another thing. At common law, the doctrine of estoppel by deed (sometimes called after-acquired title) doesn't apply here. Because the boyfriend didn't own the entire property, he only had a joint interest.

So the coworker would only get the interest that the boyfriend could convey. So the student remains as a joint tenant, but since the boyfriend's interest was sold, the joint tenancy would be severed, making them tenants in common. So the coworker owns half, and the student owns half.

Wait, no. Wait, in joint tenancy, each owns the entirety, but upon transfer, the joint tenancy is severed. So the boyfriend's interest is transferred, so the student and coworker would each have a 50% interest as tenants in common.

So the title is now with the student and the coworker as tenants in common. That's option G.

Wait, but some might think that the coworker gets the entire property because they're a BFP. But I think that's not the case because the boyfriend couldn't convey the student's interest. So the coworker can only get the boyfriend's interest, which is to sever the joint tenancy and become a tenant in common with the student.

So looking at the options, option G is the coworker and the student as tenants in common. That would be the correct answer.

The college student and her boyfriend purchased the property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. This means they each had an undivided right to the entire property, and upon the death of one, the other would inherit the whole property. However, when the boyfriend, facing financial difficulties, forged the student's name on a deed and sold the property to the co-worker, the situation changed.

Under common law, a joint tenant can only convey their own interest in the property. When the boyfriend sold his interest, it severed the joint tenancy, and the ownership became a tenancy in common between the student and the co-worker. The co-worker, as a bona fide purchaser (BFP) who paid fair market value and had no knowledge of the forgery, would take the boyfriend's interest. However, the student's interest was never validly conveyed due to the forgery, so she retains her share as a tenant in common.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The co-worker, student, and boyfriend cannot all be joint tenants with the right of survivorship because the joint tenancy was severed when the boyfriend sold his interest.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The co-worker does not own the property in fee simple because the student's interest was not validly conveyed.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The boyfriend and student are no longer joint tenants with the right of survivorship because the joint tenancy was severed.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The co-worker and boyfriend are not tenants in common because the boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property after the sale.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The co-worker and student are not joint tenants with the right of survivorship because the joint tenancy was severed.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The co-worker and boyfriend are not joint tenants with the right of survivorship because the boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property.
- **Option G**: Correct. The co-worker and student are tenants in common, each owning a 50% interest in the property.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The co-worker, student, and boyfriend are not all tenants in common because the boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The boyfriend does not own the property in fee simple because he only had a joint interest, which he conveyed to the co-worker.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The student does not own the property in fee simple because the boyfriend's interest was conveyed to the co-worker, severing the joint tenancy.

Thus, the correct answer is that the co-worker and the student are tenants in common.
