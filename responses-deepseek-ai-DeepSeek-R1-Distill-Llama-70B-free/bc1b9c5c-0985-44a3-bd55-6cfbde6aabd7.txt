Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: Pat bounces a basketball 25 times in 30 seconds. At that rate, approximately how many times will Pat bounce the ball in 150 seconds? The options are A through J.

Alright, so first, I think I need to find out the rate at which Pat is bouncing the ball. Rate usually means how many times something happens per unit of time. So in this case, it's the number of bounces per second.

So Pat bounces 25 times in 30 seconds. To find the rate, I can divide the number of bounces by the time. Let me do that: 25 divided by 30. Hmm, 25/30 is the same as 5/6 when I simplify it. So the rate is 5/6 bounces per second.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because 25 divided by 30 is actually 0.8333... So that's about 0.833 bounces per second. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of bounces per second or maybe per minute. Let me think about which makes more sense here.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to find out how many bounces per minute and then scale up to 150 seconds. Let me try that approach.

Wait, 30 seconds is half a minute, so if Pat bounces 25 times in 30 seconds, then in a full minute (60 seconds), he would bounce twice as many times, right? Because 30 seconds is half of 60. So 25 times 2 is 50. So that's 50 bounces per minute.

Now, the question asks for 150 seconds. Let me convert 150 seconds into minutes. Since 60 seconds make a minute, 150 divided by 60 is 2.5 minutes, or 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

So if Pat bounces 50 times each minute, then in 2.5 minutes, he would bounce 50 times 2.5. Let me calculate that: 50 * 2 is 100, and 50 * 0.5 is 25, so total is 125 times. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing this right. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of bounces per second and then multiply by 150 seconds. Let me try that method to cross-check.

So, 25 bounces in 30 seconds. So per second, it's 25/30 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333 bounces per second. Multiply that by 150 seconds: 0.8333 * 150. Let's see, 0.8333 times 100 is 83.33, and 0.8333 times 50 is 41.665. Adding them together, 83.33 + 41.665 is about 124.995, which is roughly 125.

So both methods give me around 125. Looking at the options, option I is 125. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's see:

25 bounces / 30 seconds = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333 per second.

0.8333 * 150 = ?

Breaking it down: 150 is 100 + 50.

0.8333 * 100 = 83.333...
0.8333 * 50 = 41.6665...

Adding them together: 83.333 + 41.6665 = 124.9995, which is approximately 125. Yeah, that makes sense.

Alternatively, using the unit rate method:

Find how many 30-second intervals are in 150 seconds. 150 divided by 30 is 5. So 5 intervals. Each interval has 25 bounces, so 25 * 5 equals 125. Yep, same result.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is 125, which is option I.

To determine how many times Pat will bounce the ball in 150 seconds, we first calculate the bouncing rate. Pat bounces the ball 25 times in 30 seconds, so the rate is:

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{25 \, \text{bounces}}{30 \, \text{seconds}} = \frac{5}{6} \, \text{bounces per second} \approx 0.8333 \, \text{bounces per second}.
\]

Next, we calculate the number of bounces in 150 seconds by multiplying the rate by 150:

\[
\text{Total bounces} = 0.8333 \times 150 \approx 124.995 \approx 125.
\]

This result can also be verified by recognizing that 150 seconds is 5 intervals of 30 seconds each. Since Pat bounces 25 times every 30 seconds, the total bounces are:

\[
\text{Total bounces} = 25 \times 5 = 125.
\]

Both methods confirm that the approximate number of bounces in 150 seconds is 125. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: 125
