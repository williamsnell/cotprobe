B: The cost of land refers to the taxes one has to pay for owning it.

D: The use of land also constitutes a cost, in this sense an implicit cost, that is the money payments which the land resource could have earned in their best alternative employments.

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is asking about how the use of land is a cost, but it's not counting the rent one has to pay. So, I guess the focus is on another type of cost besides rent.

The options are A through D. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says the cost is the price one pays to purchase the land. Hmm, but the question is about the use of land as a cost, not the purchase. So maybe A isn't the right answer.

Option B mentions taxes on owning land. Taxes are definitely a cost, but again, the question is about the use of land. I'm not sure if taxes are considered in this context, but maybe it's a possible answer.

Option C is about maintenance costs. That makes sense because maintaining land—like landscaping, repairs, etc.—is a direct cost of using it. But wait, the question is more about a concept in economics, perhaps implicit costs rather than explicit ones.

Option D talks about implicit cost, which is the money the land could have earned in its best alternative use. Oh right, I remember something about opportunity cost. So when you use land for one purpose, you can't use it for another, and the foregone earnings from the alternative use count as a cost. That's an implicit cost because you're not paying money out of pocket, but it's still a cost in economic terms.

The question is specifically about a cost that's not rent, so it's probably referring to this opportunity cost idea. So D would be the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Rent is an explicit cost when you pay someone to use their land. But if you own the land, the opportunity cost is what you could have earned by using it differently or renting it out. So yes, option D fits because it's the implicit cost related to the alternative uses.

The correct answer is D. The use of land as a cost, excluding rent, refers to the implicit cost, which is the opportunity cost of what the land could have earned in its best alternative employment.

Answer: D
