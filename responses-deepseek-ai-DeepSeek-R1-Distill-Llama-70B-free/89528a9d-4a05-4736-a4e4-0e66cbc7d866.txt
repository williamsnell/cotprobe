Question:

A collector owned a rare 16th-century tapestry. The collector contracted in writing to sell the tapestry to a tapestry dealer for $100,000. The contract stipulated that delivery would be "F. O. B. at the dealer's shop," with payment to be made one week after tender. When the dealer received the tapestry, he noticed that it had been damaged in transit. The dealer immediately contacted the collector and notified him that he was rejecting the tapestry because it had ripped apart and was becoming unwoven. The collector told the dealer that he would get back to him with re-shipping instructions. The collector did not make any further contact with the dealer. After four weeks, the dealer then sold the tapestry to a buyer for $120,000. If the collector sues the dealer for damages, the collector should recover

Options:

A: $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.
B: $110,000, which includes a 10% penalty on the resale.
C: $100,000, which is the contract price.
D: $120,000, which is the resale price.
E: Nothing, because the dealer acted within his rights after the collector failed to respond.
F: $100,000, because the dealer is entitled to the contract price.
G: $20,000, for the loss of potential profit due to the damaged tapestry.
H: $120,000, for conversion.
I: $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.
J: $130,000, including the contract price and a penalty for unauthorized resale.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about the collector and the dealer. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, the collector owns a rare 16th-century tapestry and contracts in writing to sell it to a dealer for $100,000. The contract says delivery is F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, and payment is to be made one week after tender. Then, when the dealer receives the tapestry, he notices it's damaged—ripped and unwoven. He contacts the collector immediately to reject it. The collector says he'll get back with shipping instructions but never does. After four weeks, the dealer sells it to another buyer for $120,000. Now, the collector is suing the dealer for damages. The question is how much the collector should recover.

Hmm. I remember that F.O.B. terms are important in contracts. F.O.B. stands for Free on Board, which typically indicates who bears the risk of loss during transit. If it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, that probably means the risk shifts to the dealer once the goods are delivered to the dealer's shop. Wait, no—wait, F.O.B. destination usually means the risk is on the seller until it reaches the buyer's place. But if it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, which is the buyer's location, then the risk would transfer upon delivery there. So if the goods are damaged in transit to the dealer's shop, the dealer owns the risk because the F.O.B. point is their shop.

Wait, but the contract says F.O.B. at the dealer's shop. So the seller (collector) is responsible for getting the tapestry to the dealer's shop, and once it arrives there, the risk shifts to the dealer. So if the tapestry was damaged in transit, that would be the dealer's problem, not the collector's. Because the collector has fulfilled their duty to deliver to the F.O.B. point.

But the dealer is rejecting the tapestry because it's damaged. So the question is, can the dealer just reject it, or does the collector have some obligation? Well, under the UCC, when goods are non-conforming, the buyer can reject them if the defects are material. But here, the risk of loss is on the dealer because it's F.O.B. at their shop. So if the goods are damaged in transit, the dealer can't reject them because the damage occurred while the risk was on them. Wait, but the damage occurred during transit before delivery, right? Because F.O.B. at dealer's shop implies that the seller is responsible for transportation to the dealer's shop. So the damage in transit would be the seller's responsibility because the risk was still on the seller until delivery.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. F.O.B. at the dealer's shop means that the seller bears the risk until the goods reach the dealer's shop. So any loss or damage during transit to the dealer's shop would be the seller's responsibility. So in this case, the tapestry was damaged in transit, so the collector (seller) is responsible. Therefore, the dealer can rightfully reject the goods because they are non-conforming.

Wait, but the seller (collector) is the one who bears the risk, so if the goods are damaged in transit, the seller has to deal with it. So when the dealer receives the damaged goods, they can rightfully reject them under the perfect tender rule, right? Because the goods don't conform to the contract.

So the dealer notifies the collector that they're rejecting the tapestry. The collector says he'll get back with re-shipping instructions but doesn't. Then, after four weeks, the dealer sells it for $120k.

So, what are the implications here? If the dealer rightfully rejected the goods, the collector is in breach. But if the dealer then sells the goods, they might be acting as a buyer in the ordinary course of business, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the dealer might have resold the goods, and the issue is whether the collector is entitled to the profit or not.

Wait, but the dealer resold it for a higher price. So the collector is suing the dealer for damages. What's the measure of damages here?

Under UCC §2-708, when a buyer resells goods, the seller can recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price, along with incidental damages, but not less than the contract price. Alternatively, if the seller is the one suing for non-acceptance, the measure is the contract price minus the market price at the time and place for tender, plus incidental damages.

Wait, but in this case, the seller (collector) is suing the dealer (buyer). So maybe the dealer is the buyer who wrongfully rejected the goods, and the seller is suing for damages. Alternatively, perhaps the dealer's resale was a conversion.

Wait, the collector delivered the goods, which were damaged, and the dealer rejected them. But if the risk was on the seller, then the dealer's rejection was justified. So the collector is in breach because the goods were damaged upon arrival. Wait, no—the F.O.B. point determines the risk. If F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, the risk is on the seller until the goods reach the dealer's shop. So if the goods were damaged in transit, the seller (collector) is responsible because the risk was still on them. Therefore, the dealer can rightfully reject the goods because they are non-conforming.

So when the dealer rejects, the collector has the right to cure the defect within the contract time, which is typically the time for performance. The contract says payment is to be made one week after tender, but the delivery is F.O.B. So the time for the seller to cure would be during the contract time, which I think is not specified but perhaps a reasonable time.

The collector was notified of the rejection and said he'd get back with shipping instructions but didn't. So the collector failed to cure within a reasonable time. Therefore, the dealer, as the buyer, can treat the contract as avoided and resell the goods. But wait, in this case, the dealer sold the tapestry to another buyer for a higher price. So the question is, does the dealer have the right to resell, and can the collector claim any damages from that sale?

Wait, but if the seller (collector) is in breach by delivering non-conforming goods, the buyer (dealer) can choose to reject the goods and perhaps sue for damages. But in this case, the dealer sold the goods and made a profit. So does the collector have any claim against the dealer for that profit?

I think that when the buyer (dealer) resells the goods in a commercially reasonable manner, they can recover any loss on resale but can't retain any profit. So under UCC §2-706, the seller can recover damages based on the resale, but that's when the seller is the one reselling after the buyer's breach. Alternatively, under §2-708, the seller can recover the contract price if the buyer has accepted the goods but then breaches.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The dealer is the buyer. The dealer rejected the goods because they were non-conforming, and the seller (collector) didn't cure the defect. So the dealer has the right to resell the goods. Under UCC §2-706, a buyer can resell and recover damages from the seller if the resale is done in a commercially reasonable manner.

Wait, but the collector is suing the dealer. So perhaps the collector is claiming that the dealer had no right to resell the goods, and thus the dealer's sale was a conversion, entitling the collector to the proceeds. Alternatively, the collector might argue that the dealer's resale was wrongful because the collector still held title.

Wait, but under F.O.B. terms, the title would typically pass when the goods are delivered to the carrier, but risk of loss is separate. If the goods were damaged in transit, and the contract is F.O.B. destination (dealer's shop), then the risk was on the seller until arrival. So the seller is responsible for the damage, and the buyer can reject.

So the collector is the seller, and the dealer is the buyer. The dealer rightfully rejected the goods because they were non-conforming. The collector failed to cure, so the dealer can treat the contract as avoided and resell the goods. When the dealer resells, they can do so, and if they make a profit, the profit would typically belong to them, but if they suffer a loss, they can claim against the seller.

Wait, but if the dealer resells for a higher price, the profit doesn't go to the seller (collector). So the collector can't claim the $20k profit. But wait, the collector is suing the dealer. So what's the dealer's liability here?

Alternatively, maybe the dealer's resale was wrongful. If the dealer didn't have the right to resell, then the sale might constitute conversion, and the collector could recover the resale price as damages for conversion.

Wait, but the dealer had the right to reject the goods because they were non-conforming, and the collector didn't cure. So the dealer can treat the contract as avoided and resell the goods. So the dealer's resale was proper, and the collector can't claim any damages from that resale, but the dealer can't be sued for the profit. Unless the dealer's resale was improper.

Wait, perhaps the issue is whether the dealer properly exercised their right to resell. Because the collector didn't respond, the dealer may have treated the goods as their own and sold them, which could be considered conversion if they didn't have the right to do so.

Alternatively, under the UCC, when a buyer justifiably rejects goods, the seller must take them back. If the seller doesn't, the buyer can resell them. So the dealer's resale would be permissible, and the collector can't claim any damages because the dealer was within their rights to resell after the collector failed to cure.

Wait, but the dealer sold it for $120k, which is higher than the contract price. So the collector might argue that the dealer made a profit and should account for it, but I think the UCC doesn't allow that. Because when the buyer resells after a justified rejection, any profit goes to the buyer, not the seller.

So the collector can't recover any damages because the dealer acted lawfully. Alternatively, the collector might be entitled to the contract price, but I don't think so because the dealer rightfully rejected the goods.

Wait, but the collector delivered non-conforming goods. So the dealer can choose to reject and sue for damages, but in this case, the dealer resold the goods and made a profit. So the collector isn't entitled to that profit, but the dealer isn't liable for any loss either.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the collector can't recover anything because the dealer acted within their rights. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Nothing, because the dealer acted within his rights after the collector failed to respond.

Option H: $120,000 for conversion.

Option A: $20k, the difference.

So, if the dealer's resale was lawful, then the collector can't recover anything. But if the dealer's resale was a conversion, then the collector could recover the resale price as damages for conversion.

Hmm. So if the dealer didn't have the right to sell the goods, then selling them would be conversion, and the collector could recover the resale price. But if the dealer had the right to resell, then the collector can't.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the F.O.B. terms again. Since it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, the risk of loss is on the collector until the goods reach the dealer. So when the goods arrived damaged, the collector bears the risk. So the dealer can reject them because they're non-conforming, and the collector has the right to cure within the contract time, which here is not specified, but typically a reasonable time.

The collector was notified and said they'd get back, but didn't. So after a reasonable time (four weeks), the dealer resold. So the dealer's resale was proper under UCC §2-706(2), which allows the buyer to resell in a commercially reasonable manner after the seller's breach.

In this case, the dealer sold it for a higher price. So any profit from the resale would belong to the dealer, and any loss would be recoverable from the seller. But since the resale was for a higher price, the dealer doesn't owe the collector anything, and the collector can't recover any damages.

So the collector can't recover anything from the dealer because the dealer acted within their rights. So the answer would be E: Nothing.

Alternatively, if the collector had title to the goods when the dealer sold them, then it's conversion. But under F.O.B. terms, title would pass upon delivery to the carrier, I think, but risk of loss is separate. So when the goods were damaged in transit, the risk was on the collector, but title might have passed to the dealer. So if the dealer sold the goods, they were selling their own goods, so no conversion. Therefore, the collector can't recover anything because the dealer was legally reselling their own goods after justifiably rejecting them.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about when title passes. Under UCC, title passes when the contract says so, and F.O.B. terms can affect that. If it's F.O.B. destination, title passes upon delivery to the destination. So in this case, title would pass when the goods reach the dealer's shop. But if the goods were lost or damaged in transit, and the risk was on the seller (collector), then the dealer might still have title, but the goods are damaged.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should consider this: since the dealer justifiably rejected the goods, they could resell them. The collector can't claim any damages because the dealer's actions were proper.

So the correct answer should be E: Nothing. So the collector recovers nothing.
</think>

The collector contracted to sell a rare tapestry to the dealer for $100,000, with delivery stipulated as "F.O.B. at the dealer's shop." Under F.O.B. terms, the risk of loss shifts to the buyer (dealer) once the goods reach the specified destination (the dealer's shop). However, the tapestry was damaged in transit, and the dealer rejected it as non-conforming. The collector was notified of the rejection but failed to respond or cure the defect within a reasonable time.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), when a buyer justifiably rejects non-conforming goods, the seller (collector) has the opportunity to cure the defect. If the seller fails to do so, the buyer (dealer) can treat the contract as avoided and resell the goods in a commercially reasonable manner. Here, the dealer resold the tapestry for $120,000 after the collector failed to respond, which was a lawful action under the circumstances.

The collector is not entitled to the profit from the resale because the dealer acted within their rights to resell the goods after the collector's breach. The collector cannot claim damages for conversion because the dealer had the right to resell the goods following the justified rejection. Therefore, the collector cannot recover any damages from the dealer.
