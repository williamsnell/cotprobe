Okay, so I've got this question about psychological tests and legal challenges, specifically regarding adverse impact on minority groups. Hmm, I need to figure out which type of test is most likely to withstand a legal challenge if there's an adverse impact.

First, I remember that adverse impact refers to a situation where a test or selection procedure disproportionately screens out a protected group, like minorities or women, even if the test is neutral on the surface. So companies have to ensure their tests are fair and valid to avoid legal issues.

The question is asking which test probably has the best chance of withstanding such a challenge. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Projective tests. These are like inkblot tests, right? They're used to assess personality by seeing what someone projects into ambiguous stimuli. I think they're more subjective and less standardized. Maybe they're not as empirically supported, so they might not hold up well in court if there's bias.

Option B: Empirically keyed. These are tests where the questions or items are selected based on empirical evidence showing they predict the desired outcome. Wait, I think empirically keyed tests are developed by testing items on a group and seeing which ones differentiate between successful and unsuccessful individuals. They might have a better chance because they're based on data, but I'm not sure how they fare regarding adverse impact.

Option C: Personality test. These assess traits like extraversion or conscientiousness. I've heard that personality tests are often used in hiring, but they can sometimes have issues with cultural bias. If a personality test shows adverse impact, the employer would need to prove it's job-related and consistent with business necessity, which might be harder.

Option D: Multiple-choice. This is a format rather than a type of test. It could apply to various kinds of tests, like cognitive ability or knowledge tests. I don't think the format itself determines the legal standing as much as the content does, so maybe this isn't the best option.

Option E: Computer adaptive test. These adjust the difficulty of questions based on the test-taker's responses. They can be efficient, but if the algorithm is biased, it could lead to adverse impact. I'm not sure if being adaptive inherently makes it more defensible.

Option F: Integrity test. These measure honesty and trustworthiness. I think they're often used in employment settings. They might be less likely to show adverse impact because they're more about behavior rather than cognitive ability, but I'm not certain if that's the case.

Option G: Work sample. These tests require the test-taker to perform tasks that are similar to the actual job. For example, if you're hiring a writer, you might ask them to write a sample. Work samples are often considered because they directly relate to the job, making them more content-valid. High content validity can make them more defensible in court because they clearly measure job-related skills.

Option H: Situational judgement test. These present hypothetical work situations and ask how the test-taker would respond. They're popular in selection because they can predict job performance. They're usually based on judgment and may have a mix of right and wrong answers. I think they can have good validity, but do they withstand legal challenges better than others?

Option I: Cognitive ability test. These measure general mental ability, like problem-solving and reasoning. I remember that cognitive tests often show adverse impact because some groups perform differently on average. If a test has high validity but results in adverse impact, employers need a strong justification. So maybe these are more likely to face legal challenges unless they're carefully constructed.

Option J: Polygraph test. These are lie detectors. I think their use is restricted by law in many places, like the Employee Polygraph Protection Act in the US. So they're probably not a good option here since they're already heavily regulated and might not be permissible in many cases.

Putting it all together, I think the key here is the type of validity. Tests with high content validity are often more defensible because they directly mirror the job's requirements. Work sample tests (Option G) are examples of content-valid tests because they assess performance on tasks identical or similar to the job. This direct relevance makes it easier to justify their use even if there's adverse impact, as they can demonstrate that the test is essential for the job.

On the other hand, cognitive ability tests (Option I) are often more likely to show adverse impact but are supported by criterion validity. However, in legal challenges, content validity might carry more weight because it's about the job's specific requirements.

So I'm leaning towards Option G: Work sample as the correct answer because it's the most directly related to job performance and thus can better withstand legal scrutiny when adverse impact is a concern.

When evaluating which type of test is most likely to withstand a legal challenge due to adverse impact on a minority group, it is essential to consider the validity and relevance of the test to the job. Adverse impact occurs when a test disproportionately screens out a protected group, and employers must demonstrate that the test is job-related and consistent with business necessity.

- **Projective tests (A):** These are subjective and less standardized, making them less likely to withstand legal scrutiny.  
- **Empirically keyed tests (B):** While based on data, they may still face challenges if they disproportionately affect minority groups.  
- **Personality tests (C):** These can have cultural biases and may struggle to demonstrate job relevance.  
- **Multiple-choice tests (D):** The format alone does not determine legal standing; content is more critical.  
- **Computer adaptive tests (E):** While efficient, their algorithms could introduce bias, making them less defensible.  
- **Integrity tests (F):** These focus on honesty but may not directly relate to job-specific skills.  
- **Work sample tests (G):** These directly assess job-related tasks, making them highly content-valid and more defensible in court.  
- **Situational judgement tests (H):** While valid, they may not have the same level of direct job relevance as work samples.  
- **Cognitive ability tests (I):** Often show adverse impact and require strong justification, making them more vulnerable to legal challenges.  
- **Polygraph tests (J):** Heavily regulated and restricted, making them unlikely to be used in most cases.  

Work sample tests (G) are the most likely to withstand legal challenges because they are directly tied to job performance, demonstrating clear content validity and relevance to the position. This makes them easier to justify even if adverse impact occurs.
