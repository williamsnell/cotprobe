Okay, so I've got this question about relativity and how clocks on a fast-moving spaceship appear to someone else. Hmm, I remember that relativity has something to do with time dilation. Let me think.

So the question is asking from where the clocks on the spaceship would appear to run slow. I think this is a classic example of special relativity. Einstein said that time moves slower for an object moving at a high speed relative to an observer. Wait, but wait—there's something about perspective here.

If the spaceship is moving fast relative to Earth, then someone on Earth would see the spaceship's clocks as running slow. But what about someone on the spaceship? They would think their own clocks are normal and that Earth's clocks are slow because they're moving relative to them.

So the question is from whose viewpoint? The options are about where the viewer is located. The options are A-J, but I need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the question again: "Clocks on a fast-moving spaceship ... appear to run slow when viewed from..." So the viewer is outside the spaceship. The spaceship is moving relative to the viewer.

So the correct answer would be Earth because the spaceship is moving relative to Earth. So the people on Earth see the spaceship's clocks as slow.

Wait, let me check the options. Option J is Earth. So the answer should be J.

But wait, option F says inside the spaceship. No, because from inside, their own clocks are normal. So the effect is only observed from the outside frame of reference.

Another thought: In the spaceship's frame, Earth is moving, so Earth's clocks would appear slow. But the question is about the spaceship's clocks being slow, so the observer must be in a frame where the spaceship is moving. That's Earth's frame.

So the answer should be J: Earth.

The question concerns how clocks on a fast-moving spaceship appear to an observer, which is a concept addressed by special relativity. According to Einstein's theory, time dilation occurs when an object moves at a high speed relative to an observer. Specifically, the observer in a stationary frame (in this case, Earth) will perceive the clocks on the moving spaceship as running slower. Conversely, an observer on the spaceship would see Earth's clocks as slow, but the question focuses on the spaceship's clocks appearing slow, which means the observer must be in a frame where the spaceship is moving—Earth's frame.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option J (Earth)** is correct because Earth is the stationary frame relative to the fast-moving spaceship, and observers on Earth would perceive the spaceship's clocks as running slow.
- Other options, such as **Option F (inside the spaceship)**, are incorrect because observers inside the spaceship would see their own clocks as normal.

Thus, the correct answer is:

J
