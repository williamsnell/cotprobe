Question:

What is involved in human discrimination learning?

Options:

A: It is a form of learning that occurs without any external stimuli, relying solely on internal thought processes.
B: Discrimination learning is primarily focused on the physical sensations rather than cognitive recognition of stimuli.
C: It involves the recognition of a single stimulus that changes over time, with rewards and punishments given for recognizing the changes.
D: It involves only the presence of a single stimulus.
E: The process depends on the presence of three or more stimuli, with all being rewarded in a variable manner.
F: The general characteristic involved in both situations is the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one of these stimuli is frequently rewarded or punished.
G: Human discrimination learning is the ability to discern between more than two stimuli, none of which are associated with rewards or punishments.
H: It involves a process where a single stimulus is both rewarded and punished at random intervals.
I: It is exclusively related to language acquisition.
J: It is only associated with punishment, not reward.

Okay, so I have this question about human discrimination learning, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options A to J. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, what do I remember about discrimination learning? I think it's a concept from psychology, particularly in learning theory. Discrimination learning is about how organisms learn to distinguish between different stimuli. I remember something about operant conditioning, where behavior is modified by its consequences, like rewards or punishments.

So in discrimination learning, the organism learns to respond differently to different stimuli. For example, in a classic experiment, a pigeon might learn to peck at a green light but not a red one because the green light is associated with a food reward. So the key here is that there are multiple stimuli, and the learner has to tell them apart based on the consequences.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Learning without external stimuli, relying on internal thought. That doesn't sound right. Discrimination involves external stimuli, so I can probably rule this out.

Option B: Focus on physical sensations rather than cognitive recognition. I'm not sure. I think discrimination involves cognitive processes because the individual has to recognize and differentiate the stimuli. So maybe B isn't correct.

Option C: Recognition of a single stimulus that changes over time with rewards and punishments. Wait, no. Discrimination learning involves multiple stimuli, not just one. So C might not be right.

Option D: Only a single stimulus is present. That doesn't sound right because discrimination requires comparing at least two stimuli. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Three or more stimuli, all rewarded variably. Hmm. I'm not sure about the number. I think discrimination can involve two stimuli. Maybe E isn't correct.

Option F: Presence of two stimuli, either at the same time or successively, with only one frequently rewarded or punished. That sounds familiar. Because in discrimination, you have two stimuli, and the learner learns to respond to one but not the other based on the reinforcement. So F seems like a strong candidate.

Option G: Discerning more than two stimuli without rewards. No, because rewards or punishments are a big part of discrimination learning. So G is likely incorrect.

Option H: Single stimulus being both rewarded and punished randomly. That doesn't fit. Discrimination involves different responses to different stimuli, not the same one being both rewarded and punished. So H isn't right.

Option I: Exclusively related to language acquisition. No, discrimination learning is a broader concept, not just language. So I can eliminate I.

Option J: Only associated with punishment. That's not correct because rewards are also a part of it. So J is wrong.

Putting it all together, option F makes the most sense. It mentions two stimuli, which aligns with what I remember about discrimination learning. The process involves the learner distinguishing between them based on whether they're rewarded or punished.

The correct answer is F.
