Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of acetaldehyde. Hmm, I remember that the rate constant k is related to temperature by the Arrhenius equation. The question gives me two rate constants at two different temperatures, and I need to find the activation energy. Then, using that, predict the rate constant at a higher temperature.

Wait, the Arrhenius equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(R T)). But when comparing two points, I should use the two-point form of the Arrhenius equation to find Ea. Oh right, the formula is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2). That's the one I need to use here.

So the given data is: at 759 K, k1 is 0.105 m^-1 sec^-1, and at 791 K, k2 is 0.343 m^-1 sec^-1. Let me write that down:

k1 = 0.105
T1 = 759 K
k2 = 0.343
T2 = 791 K

Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, actually, I think I might have mixed up the temperatures. Because when the temperature increases, the rate constant increases too, which is the case here. So T2 is higher than T1, which is correct.

So plugging into the equation: ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

I can compute each part step by step. First, let's calculate ln(k2/k1). Let me compute k2/k1 first.

k2/k1 = 0.343 / 0.105 ≈ 3.2667. Wait, let me calculate accurately: 0.343 divided by 0.105. 0.105 times 3 is 0.315, which leaves 0.028. 0.028 is about 0.2667 of 0.105, so 3.2667 approximately.

So ln(3.2667) is approximately 1.183. Wait, wait, let me check. Natural log of e is 1, e is about 2.718. So 3.2667 is a bit above e. So ln(3)=1.0986, ln(3.2)= about 1.163, ln(3.2667) maybe around 1.183. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, maybe I can use a calculator but since I'm just thinking, I'll proceed with approximate values.

Next, compute 1/T1 and 1/T2. Let's calculate those.

1/T1 = 1/759 ≈ 0.001317 (since 759 is about 760, 1/760 is approx 0.001316).
Similarly, 1/T2 = 1/791 ≈ let's see, 791 is about 800, 1/800 is 0.00125. But let's get more precise.

759 into 1 is approximately 0.001317 minutes. Let me compute 759 × 1.317 = approx 1 (since 759 × 1.3e-3 is 0.9867, so 759 × 0.001317 is about 1.)

Similarly, 791: 1/791 is approximately 0.001264. Let me compute 791 × 0.001264. 791 * 0.001 = 0.791. 791 * 0.000264 is approx 0.208. So 0.791 + 0.208 = 0.999, close to 1. So 1/791 ≈ 0.001264.

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = 0.001317 - 0.001264 = 0.000053.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, because 1/T1 is larger than 1/T2 since T2 > T1. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no! Wait, T1 is 759, which is lower than T2 of 791. So 1/T1 is larger than 1/T2, so subtracting 1/T2 from 1/T1 gives a positive number.

So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive, which matches with the fact that the rate increases with temperature, so Ea should be positive.

So the equation becomes ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So rearranging, Ea = [ ln(k2/k1) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, no, let me recheck: the formula is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

So solving for Ea: Ea = [ ln(k2/k1) * R ] / [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Wait, wait no. Let me compute it correctly.

The equation is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) * ( (1/T1) - (1/T2) )

So Ea = [ ln(k2/k1) * R ] / [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.

Yes, because the equation is:

ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) * [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

So, Ea = [ ln(k2/k1) * R ] / [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Wait, but wait, no. Let me double-check the formula. I think it's (1/T1 - 1/T2). So the denominator in Ea is (1/T1 - 1/T2), which is positive as we calculated.

So now, the gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Right.

So let's plug in the numbers.

ln(k2/k1) ≈ 1.183.

Then, R is 8.314.

Denominator: (1/T1 -1/T2) ≈ 0.000053.

So Ea = (1.183 * 8.314) / 0.000053.

Wait, let's compute numerator first: 1.183 * 8.314.

1.183 *8 = 9.464, 1.183 *0.314 ≈ 0.371. So total approx 9.464 + 0.371 = 9.835.

But more accurately, 8.314 * 1.183.

Compute 8 *1.183 = 9.464, 0.314 *1.183.

0.3 *1.183=0.3549, 0.014 *1.183≈0.0166. So 0.3549 +0.0166=0.3715. So 9.464 +0.3715=9.8355.

So numerator is approx 9.8355.

Denominator is 0.000053.

So Ea ≈ 9.8355 / 0.000053 = let's compute that.

9.8355 / 0.000053 = ?

Well, 1e5 is 100,000. 0.000053 is 5.3e-5.

Wait, 9.8355 / 5.3e-5 = (9.8355 / 5.3) ) * 1e5.

Compute 9.8355 /5.3 ≈ 1.856.

Because 5.3 * 1.8 = 9.54, and 5.3*1.856= let's see:

5.3 * 1 =5.3, 5.3*0.8=4.24, 5.3*0.05=0.265, 5.3*0.006=0.0318. So 5.3 +4.24=9.54, +0.265=9.805, +0.0318=9.8368. So 5.3 *1.856 ≈9.8368. So 9.8355/5.3≈1.856.

So Ea ≈1.856 *1e5 = 1.856e5 J/mol.

Which is 185600 J/mol, or 1.856e5 J/mol.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the Ea is in the range of 1.6e5 to about 2.8e5. Hmm. Let me check my calculations again because perhaps I made an error.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the (1/T1 -1/T2) calculation. Let me recalculate that.

T1 =759 K, T2=791 K.

Compute 1/759 and 1/791 accurately.

1/759 = approximately 0.00131756.

1/791 ≈ Let's compute 1/791. Let me see: 791 is 700 +91.

1/700 = 0.00142857.

1/791 is less than that. Let me compute it:

791 × 0.00126 = 791 × 126e-6.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1/791 = 1/(790+1) ≈ (1/790) * [1/(1 + 1/790)] ≈ (1/790) (1 - 1/790) using binomial approx.

1/790 ≈ 0.001267. So 1/791 ≈ 0.001267 * (1 - 0.001267) ≈ 0.001267 - (0.001267)^2.

(0.001267)^2 = approx 1.6e-6.

So 0.001267 - 0.0000016 ≈ 0.0012654.

So 1/791 ≈ 0.0012654.

So 1/T1 -1/T2 = 0.00131756 - 0.0012654 = 0.00005216, approximately 5.216e-5.

So Ea = (ln(k2/k1) * R ) / (5.216e-5 )

Wait, let me recalculate ln(k2/k1). k2=0.343, k1=0.105. So 0.343/0.105=3.266666...

ln(3.266666). Let me compute this more accurately. I know that ln(3)=1.0986, ln(e)=1, e≈2.718.

Let me compute ln(3.2667). Maybe I can use a calculator approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Taylor expansion, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, I'll use approximate known values.

Alternatively, I can compute it as ln(3.2667) = ln(3) + ln(1.0889) ≈ 1.0986 + 0.084.

Because 3.2667 = 3 * 1.0889. So ln(3) is 1.0986, ln(1.0889) is approx 0.084.

So ln(k2/k1)=1.0986 +0.084≈1.1826.

So that gives ln(k2/k1)=1.1826.

So Ea = (1.1826 * 8.314) / (5.216e-5 )

Compute numerator: 1.1826 *8.314.

Let me compute 1.1826 *8 =9.4608.

1.1826 *0.314= let's compute 1.1826 *0.3 =0.35478, 1.1826 *0.014=0.0165644. So 0.35478 +0.0165644=0.37134.

So total numerator ≈9.4608 +0.37134≈9.8321.

So Ea≈9.8321 / (5.216e-5) = Let's compute that.

Divide 9.8321 by 5.216e-5.

So 9.8321 / 0.00005216.

Hmm, let me compute this as (9.8321 / 5.216) ) * 1e5.

Because 5.216e-5 is 5.216 *1e-5, so when you divide by that, it's (dividing by 5.216) and multiplying by 1e5.

Compute 9.8321 /5.216.

Let me see: 5.216 *1.88 = ?

5 *1.88=9.4.

0.216 *1.88≈0.40608.

So 9.4 +0.40608=9.80608. That's very close to 9.8321.

So 5.216 *1.88 ≈9.806, and 9.8321 is 9.8321-9.806=0.0261 higher.

So how much more? Let's see: 5.216 * x =0.0261, so x=0.0261/5.216≈0.005.

So 1.88 +0.005=1.885.

So approximately 1.885.

So Ea=1.885 *1e5 = 1.885e5 J/mol.

Which is 188,500 J/mol, or 1.885e5 J/mol.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 2.2407e5
Option B: 2.5407e5
Option C:2.0407e5
Option D:1.9407e5
Option E:1.8407e5
Option F:1.6407e5
Option G:1.8407e5
Option H:2.8407e5
Option I:1.7407e5

Hmm, my calculation gives approximately 1.885e5 J/mol, which is 188,500. Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.9407e5, which is 194,070 J/mol. But wait, my calculation is 188,500. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ln(k2/k1) value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute ln(3.2667) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let's try using natural logarithms more precisely.

k2/k1 = 0.343 / 0.105 = 3.266666...

Let me compute ln(3.2666667). Let's use a calculator approach.

I know that ln(3) =1.098612289

ln(3.2) is approximately 1.163150927.

ln(3.2667) is higher than 3.2.

Compute using the Taylor series or another method.

Alternatively, using linear approximation between known points.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator function:

3.2667 → ln ≈ 1.1823.

Wait, I found a source that ln(3.2667)= approximately 1.1823.

So let's use 1.1823 as the value.

So Ea = (1.1823 *8.314) / 5.216e-5.

Compute numerator: 1.1823 *8.314.

1.1823 *8=9.4584.

1.1823 *0.314= let's compute:

0.3 *1.1823 =0.35469

0.014 *1.1823=0.0164922

So 0.35469 +0.0164922=0.3711822.

So numerator is 9.4584 +0.37118=9.82958.

Denominator is 5.216e-5 =0.00005216.

So Ea=9.82958 / 0.00005216.

Let me compute this division.

9.82958 / 0.00005216.

Let me write it in terms of 1e5:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e5 to get 982958 /52.16.

Compute 982958 ÷ 52.16.

Well, 52.16 ×18,800 = let's see:

52.16 ×18,000 = 938,880.

52.16 × 800 =41,728.

So 18,800 →938,880 +41,728=980,608.

Subtract from 982,958: 982,958 -980,608=2,350.

Now, how much more?

52.16 ×45 = 52.16*40=2,086.4; 52.16*5=260.8 → total 2,347.2.

So 45: 2,347.2 from 2,350 → remaining ≈2.8.

So 45 more gives 2,347.2, so 45.05 would give about 2,350.

So total is 18,800 +800 +45.05= 19,645.05.

So approximately 19,645.

Wait, but wait, 52.16 *19,645=?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because 52.16 × 18,845 =? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 982958 ÷52.16.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 982958 /52.16.

Let me note that 52.16 × 18,845 = ?

Wait, perhaps an easier approach: 52.16 × 18,845 = ?

Alternatively, perhaps I'll use approximate division.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me make it simpler.

We have 9.82958 / 0.00005216 = 9.82958 / 5.216e-5 = (9.82958 /5.216 ) × 1e5.

Compute 9.82958 /5.216.

Calculate 5.216 ×1.88 = as before, 9.806.

The difference is 9.82958 -9.806 =0.02358.

So 0.02358 /5.216 ≈0.00452.

So total is 1.88 +0.00452≈1.8845.

So Ea ≈1.8845 ×1e5 =188,450 J/mol.

So approximately 1.8845e5 J/mol.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option D:1.9407e5, but that's higher than my calculated value. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the (1/T1 -1/T2) calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the 1/T1 and 1/T2.

T1=759 K →1/759 ≈0.00131756.

T2=791 K →1/791≈0.0012647.

So 1/T1 -1/T2 =0
