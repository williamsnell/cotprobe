Question:

In the Tularosa Basin of New Mexico are black lava formations surrounded by light-colored sandy desert. Pocket mice inhabit both areas. Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?

Options:

A: The light-colored mice evolved from the dark-colored mice over time.
B: The color of the mice is determined by their diet in the lava formations and desert.
C: The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.
D: The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.
E: Selection favors some phenotypes over others.
F: The two varieties of mice have always existed separately and did not share a common ancestor.
G: Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.
H: The mice were originally light-colored, but some darkened over time to blend into the lava formations.

Okay, so I've got this biology question about pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, there are these black lava formations and light-colored sandy deserts. The pocket mice there have different colors depending on where they live: dark ones on lava and light on sand. The question is asking which statement about this scenario is correct.

The options are A through H. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says the light mice evolved from dark mice over time. Well, that's possible but I'm not sure. It depends on their ancestry. They might have a common ancestor and then diverged.

Option B suggests diet determines their color. I don't think diet affects fur color like that. More likely, it's about camouflage, so selection pressures from predators.

Option C states they descended from a recent common ancestor. That sounds right because they're in different environments but same area, so probably they split from one species into two.

Option D claims the original population split because of mutations. While mutations can cause variation, the main driver here is probably natural selection, not just mutations leading to speciation.

Option E says selection favors some phenotypes. That makes sense. Dark mice would blend into lava, light into sand, so selection would favor those traits.

Option F says the two varieties have always been separate and didn't share an ancestor. That seems unlikely because they're the same species, just different coloration, so they probably share a common ancestor.

Option G suggests mice were all dark, and as lava decomposed to sand, some changed color. Wait, lava decomposing into sand doesn't make sense because lava cools into rock, not sand. Plus, the mice's color change is more about adaptation, not the environment changing over time.

Option H says mice were light, some darkened. That's possible, but again, the key is that the color helps them blend in, so it's about selection.

So, looking for the correct statements. The question is about which is correct. So, E is definitely correct because natural selection is at play here. Also, C seems correct because the mice probably diverged from a common ancestor recently.

Wait, but the question says which statement is correct. So, looking at the options, E and C are both correct? Or is another better?

Wait, let's think again. E says selection favors some phenotypes. That's a general statement and applies here. The mice with colors that blend in are more likely to survive and reproduce, so their traits are favored.

C says they have a recent common ancestor. That's also correct because they're different populations of the same species, so they must have diverged recently.

But the question is which statement is correct. So both E and C could be correct, but let's look at the options. The options are separate, so I might have to pick the best one.

Wait, the question is about which is correct, and I think both E and C are correct statements. But the options are single choices, so maybe more than one is correct, but the answer expects only one.

Wait, the options are A to H, and the correct statements could be E and C. But I need to pick the best answer.

Alternatively, maybe the question is implying that the mice are an example of natural selection, so E would be correct.

Another angle: the scenario describes an example of adaptation through natural selection. So, E is correct because selection favors certain phenotypes.

But what about C? It's correct too. So, perhaps both E and C are correct, but the options don't have a choice that includes both. So which one is the better answer.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct, so multiple could be correct, but I have to choose from the options.

Looking again, the question is about which statement is correct. So, option E is a correct statement in general, and it's applicable here. Option C is also correct, but perhaps the question is testing for the concept of selection, making E the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the mice are the same species but in different environments, so C is correct because they have a recent common ancestor.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct, so perhaps both E and C are correct, but the provided options may have one correct.

Wait, the options are A through H, and I need to choose which is correct. So, looking back, the first option says light evolved from dark. That's a possibility, but it's not necessarily the case. They could have diverged from a common ancestor.

Option C says two varieties descended from recent common ancestor. That's likely correct because they're the same species but different populations.

Option E is correct because selection is favoring the traits.

So, if the question allows for multiple correct options, but the answer expects only one, perhaps both C and E are correct. But the options are separate, so maybe the answer is E or C.

Wait, the question is about which of the following is correct. So, both C and E could be correct. But perhaps only E is correct, because it's a general statement about selection, and the scenario is an example of it.

Alternatively, C is correct because it's about their ancestry, which is a specific case.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think about each option again.

Option E: Selection favors some phenotypes over others. Yes, because in each habitat, the mice that blend in have higher survival, so their color is favored.

Option C: Descended from a recent common ancestor. Yes, because they're in the same area but different environments, so likely they diverged recently.

So, both E and C seem correct. But I need to pick the answer from the given options. So looking at the options again, which is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's a fundamental concept of natural selection, and the scenario provides an example of it.

Alternatively, the question might be testing the concept of adaptive radiation or natural selection leading to divergence.

Wait, in the question, the mice are using their coloration to blend in, which is a clear case of natural selection. So E is correct.

But also, the two populations (dark and light) must have come from a common ancestor, so C is correct.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would include both, but the choices are separate, so perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, the options are each single statements, and the question is which is correct. So both E and C are correct.

But looking back, the options don't have both as correct, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and E, but since the options are separate, perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, the question gives the scenario as an example of natural selection, so E is correct.

Wait, but the initial question is about which statement is correct. So, I think E is correct, but C is also correct. But perhaps the answer is E because it's a more general correct statement, while C is specific but correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E and C. But in the options, I can only choose one. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is E. Because natural selection is the key process here.

But let me think, the question asks which statement is correct. So, looking for the correct statements:

A: Maybe, but not necessarily, because we don't know the direction of evolution.

B: Unlikely, diet doesn't determine color here.

C: Correct, recent common ancestor.

D: Unlikely, because it's selection, not mutations, causing divergence.

E: Correct, selection favors phenotypes.

F: Unlikely, they share a recent ancestor.

G: Unlikely, because lava doesn't decompose into sand, and the mice's color change is due to selection.

H: Possible, but the reasoning isn't as strong as C or E.

So, which is correct: C and E.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, but the scenario is an example of natural selection leading to adaptation, so E is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's about their descent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is from a biology textbook, perhaps about natural selection and speciation. So, the correct answer is likely E and C.

But the options don't allow for multiple answers, so perhaps the intended answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E and C are both correct, but only one is an option. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the options are A to H. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Wait, another approach: the question is about which statement is correct. So, looking for facts.

E is a true statement because selection does favor some phenotypes. So, E is correct.

C is also a true statement, as the mice share a recent ancestor.

So, in the options, both C and E are correct. But the question might have only one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C and E, but the options don't have that, so maybe the intended answer is E.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because the scenario is an example of natural selection, so E is correct.

Yes, I think E is the correct answer here.

The question describes pocket mice in the Tularosa Basin, where dark-colored mice inhabit black lava formations and light-colored mice inhabit light-colored sandy deserts. The task is to determine which statement about this scenario is correct. 

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A**: "The light-colored mice evolved from the dark-colored mice over time."  
  This is possible but not necessarily the case. The mice could have diverged from a common ancestor, so this statement is not definitively correct.  

- **B**: "The color of the mice is determined by their diet in the lava formations and desert."  
  This is unlikely because diet does not typically influence fur color in this way. The coloration is more likely due to natural selection for camouflage.  

- **C**: "The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor."  
  This is correct. The mice are likely the same species but have diverged into two populations adapted to different environments, implying a recent common ancestor.  

- **D**: "The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations."  
  While mutations can provide variation, the primary driver of divergence here is natural selection, not mutations alone.  

- **E**: "Selection favors some phenotypes over others."  
  This is correct. Natural selection is at play, as the dark-colored mice blend into the lava formations, and the light-colored mice blend into the sandy desert, giving them a survival advantage.  

- **F**: "The two varieties of mice have always existed separately and did not share a common ancestor."  
  This is incorrect. The mice are likely the same species and share a recent common ancestor.  

- **G**: "Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment."  
  This is unlikely because lava does not decompose into sand, and the color change is due to adaptation, not environmental decomposition.  

- **H**: "The mice were originally light-colored, but some darkened over time to blend into the lava formations."  
  This is possible but less supported than the explanation involving natural selection and a common ancestor.  

### Conclusion:
Both **C** and **E** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, **E** is the most appropriate choice because it directly addresses the mechanism of natural selection, which is the key concept illustrated in the scenario.  

Answer: E
