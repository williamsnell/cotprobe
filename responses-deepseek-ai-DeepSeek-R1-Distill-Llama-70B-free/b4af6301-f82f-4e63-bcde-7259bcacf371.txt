Okay, so I've got this question about a pure capitalist system and the role of government in the economy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on economics, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Alright, capitalism is an economic system where private individuals and businesses own the means of production. The main idea is that the market drives the economy, not the government. So, in a pure capitalist system, I guess the government doesn't control the economy much.

Wait, but what exactly does that mean? I remember that even in capitalist systems, the government does some things. Like, enforcing laws and protecting property rights. So maybe the government has a minor role, but not a major one.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the government plays a minor role by enforcing contracts and property rights. That sounds familiar. I think that's what happens in capitalism. The government doesn't run businesses or set prices but ensures that rules are followed.

Option C says no government intervention. That doesn't seem right. Even in pure capitalism, the government has to enforce some laws to protect property and contracts. So C might be incorrect.

Option E mentions limited intervention mainly in defense and public safety. That's also part of what governments do, but I think the role in enforcing contracts is more directly tied to the economy.

Option F talks about minimum wage and workplace safety. Wait, isn't that more of a mixed economy or a social democracy thing? Pure capitalism might not have such regulations because it's more laissez-faire.

Option G is about government controlling the economy, which is more like socialism or communism, not capitalism.

So, putting it together, pure capitalism would have the government's role limited to enforcing contracts and property rights without major intervention. So the correct answer should be B.

In a pure capitalist system, the government's role is limited to ensuring the functioning of the market by enforcing contracts and property rights, rather than actively intervening in the economy. This aligns with option B.

Answer: B
