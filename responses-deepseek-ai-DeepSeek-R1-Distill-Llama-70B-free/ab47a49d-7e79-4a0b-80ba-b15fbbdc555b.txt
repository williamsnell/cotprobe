Okay, so I have this problem here about maximizing receipts from selling telescopic lenses. The function given is R(x) = 140x[1 - {x / 10,000}]. I need to find out how many lenses, x, must be sold to get the maximum receipts. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, so I remember that in calculus, to find the maximum of a function, you take its derivative and set it equal to zero. That gives the critical points, which could be maxima or minima. Then you can test those points to see which one gives the maximum value.

So R(x) is given as 140x times (1 - x/10,000). Let me simplify that expression first. Let's expand the function. R(x) =140x*(1 - x/10000) which is 140x - (140x^2)/10000. That simplifies to R(x) =140x - 14x²/100. Wait, because 140 divided by 10000 is 0.014, but maybe I should write it as 140x - (140/10000)x². Oh right, 140/10000 is 0.014, so R(x)=140x -0.014x².

Wait, maybe I should just keep it in terms of x² for taking the derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's a quadratic function, and since the coefficient of x² is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

Quadratic functions are of the form ax² + bx + c, and their maximum (if a is negative) is at x=-b/(2a). So let me write R(x) in standard form. Let me calculate:

R(x) =140x [1 - x/10000]
=140x - (140 x^2)/10000
=140x - (14x²)/100
=140x - 0.14x²

So in standard form, a = -0.14, b=140.

The vertex x is at -b/(2a). Plugging the values in:

x = -140/(2*(-0.14)) 
= -140 / (-0.28) 
= 140 / 0.28

Hmm, let's calculate that. 140 divided by 0.28. Let me think: 0.28 times 500 is 140, because 0.28 * 500 = 140. So x=5000.

Wait, that's option J:5000 lenses. So the maximum receipts occur when 5000 lenses are sold.

Alternatively, I could have taken the derivative. Let's see, dR/dx = derivative of 140x is 140, and derivative of -0.14x² is -0.28x. So dR/dx=140 -0.28x. Setting this equal to zero: 140 -0.28x=0 → 0.28x=140 → x=140/0.28=5000. Same result.

So the correct answer should be J:5000 lenses.

To maximize the receipts from selling x telescopic lenses, we start with the revenue function:

\[
R(x) = 140x \left[1 - \frac{x}{10,000}\right]
\]

Expanding this, we get:

\[
R(x) = 140x - \frac{140x^2}{10,000} = 140x - 0.014x^2
\]

This is a quadratic function in the form \( R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -0.014 \), \( b = 140 \), and \( c = 0 \). Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative, the parabola opens downward, and the vertex represents the maximum point.

The x-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function is given by:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
x = -\frac{140}{2(-0.014)} = \frac{140}{0.028} = 5000
\]

Thus, the receipts are maximized when 5000 lenses are sold.

Answer: J: 5000 lenses
