Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A state has a statute generally prohibiting the installation and use of radar detection devices in any motor vehicle operating on the roadways within the state. This prohibition was enacted to prevent motorists from evading radar or speed checkpoints on county and state highways. A neighboring state has no such regulation in effect. By the same token, Congress has taken no action on the matter. A resident of the neighboring state has installed a radar detection device in his automobile. While driving to visit his mother he is arrested and charged with violating the aforementioned state statute. The resident files a complaint challenging the constitutionality of the state statute. As applied to the resident, the state prohibition against the use of radar detection devices is likely to be held

Options:

A: constitutional, because it can be considered a reasonable restriction on the right to privacy.
B: unconstitutional, because it unduly burdens interstate commerce.
C: unconstitutional, because the state statute fails to give credit to the law of a neighboring state.
D: constitutional, because the commerce clause does not invalidate a state regulation relating to interstate commerce unless Congress takes express action to do so.
E: constitutional, because states have the power to regulate their own roads and highways.
F: constitutional, because it protects a legitimate state interest.
G: unconstitutional, because it infringes on the rights of residents of other states.
H: unconstitutional, because the state statute is preempted by federal law.
I: unconstitutional, because it violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about the constitutionality of a state statute that prohibits the installation and use of radar detection devices in any motor vehicle on state roadways. A resident from a neighboring state, where such devices are allowed, is arrested while driving through this state. He challenges the statute.

Hmm. I remember that states have the authority to regulate their own roads and highways under their police powers. So states can pass laws related to traffic safety, right? But wait, there's also the Commerce Clause to consider, which deals with interstate commerce.

The Commerce Clause says that states can't unduly burden interstate commerce. But in this case, the law isn't directly regulating commerce; it's about the use of radar detectors. I think the Supreme Court has ruled on something similar before. Wasn't there a case about radar detectors and the Commerce Clause?

Oh right! I think it was the case where a state banned radar detectors, and the court said it was constitutional because it served a legitimate state interest—like highway safety—and didn't discriminate against interstate commerce. Wait, but another thought: does this law affect interstate commerce? Because the resident is just passing through, not engaging in commercial activity. So maybe the Commerce Clause isn't the main issue here.

Alternatively, could it be a violation of the right to travel? But I don't think that's the primary issue here. The question is more about the state's authority versus federal preemption or Commerce Clause issues.

Wait, the options include a few possibilities. Option B says it's unconstitutional because it unduly burdens interstate commerce. But in the case I'm thinking of, the Supreme Court upheld a similar law, finding that it didn't violate the Commerce Clause. Because the state's interest in traffic safety outweighed any minimal impact on interstate commerce.

Another angle: the Privileges and Immunities Clause. States can't discriminate against citizens of other states unless there's a substantial reason. But using radar detectors isn't a fundamental right, so maybe that's not the issue either.

So looking at the options, option E says it's constitutional because states can regulate their roads. That makes sense because states have the authority to make traffic laws. Option F says it's constitutional because it protects a legitimate state interest, which also sounds right.

Wait, but are there any cases where such a law was struck down? I think in the case of radar detectors, the court held that the state could ban them because the interest in public safety justified the intrusion on the driver's privacy. But privacy isn't one of the options here.

Looking back at the options, option B is about interstate commerce. But I thought the Commerce Clause wasn't the issue because the law applies equally to in-state and out-of-state drivers. So it doesn't discriminate against interstate commerce, just regulates the use of devices on state roads. Therefore, it's likely constitutional under the Commerce Clause.

So, putting it all together, the statute is probably constitutional because the state has the authority to regulate its roads for safety. So the correct answer is likely E or F.

Wait, option E says states have the power to regulate their own roads, which is correct. Option F talks about legitimate state interest, which is also correct. But which one is the better reason here?

In the Supreme Court case, the decision was based on the state's legitimate interest. So maybe F is the better answer. Alternatively, E might also be correct because it's about state regulation of roads.

Wait, the question is about the application to a non-resident. So does the Commerce Clause apply? If the law treats everyone the same, whether in-state or out-of-state, then it doesn't burden interstate commerce. So the answer wouldn't be B. So then, the correct reasoning is either E or F.

I think the statute is constitutional because the state has the authority to regulate its roads, so E. Alternatively, F because it's a legitimate interest. But I'm a bit confused about which option is more precise.

Wait, another thought: the Commerce Clause issue would be if the law impeded interstate commerce. But radar detectors are used by drivers, not commerce. So the state's law doesn't target or burden commerce, so B is incorrect. So E or F.

The correct answer is likely E: constitutional because states have the power to regulate their own roads.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a state statute prohibiting the use of radar detection devices in motor vehicles on state roadways. A resident from a neighboring state, where such devices are permitted, challenges the statute after being arrested while driving through the state. The analysis focuses on whether the statute violates the Commerce Clause or other constitutional principles.

The Commerce Clause prohibits states from unduly burdening interstate commerce. However, this statute does not directly regulate or discriminate against interstate commerce; it applies equally to all drivers, whether in-state or out-of-state residents. Therefore, it does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce, making option B unlikely.

The statute is more appropriately evaluated under the state's police power to regulate its roads and highways for public safety. States have broad authority to enact traffic laws that promote highway safety, and the use of radar detection devices can be restricted if it serves a legitimate state interest, such as preventing motorists from evading speed enforcement. This reasoning aligns with the Supreme Court's precedent upholding similar laws as constitutional.

Option E correctly identifies that states have the power to regulate their own roads and highways, which justifies the statute. While option F also mentions a legitimate state interest, option E is more precise in emphasizing the state's authority over its roadways.
