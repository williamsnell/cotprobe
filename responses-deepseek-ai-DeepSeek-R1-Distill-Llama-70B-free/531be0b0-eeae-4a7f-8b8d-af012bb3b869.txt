Okay, so I've got this question about circuits, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Let's see... The question has three statements, I, II, and III, and I have to determine which are correct.

First, I remember that there are two main types of digital circuits: combinational and sequential. Combinational circuits depend only on the current input, right? Their output is a function of the present inputs. They don't have any memory, which means they don't store any information about past inputs. So they're "memoryless." That makes sense for statement II, which says combinational circuits have a memoryless property. So II is true.

Now, what about sequential circuits? They do have memory. Their output depends not only on the current input but also on the previous inputs, which means they have some form of feedback. Oh wait, so statement I says that combinational circuits may have feedback, but sequential do not. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I think it's the opposite. Combinational circuits typically don't have feedback because their output is based solely on current inputs. Sequential circuits, on the other hand, do have feedback because they need to remember past states. So statement I is false. Because I says that combinational may have feedback, but I think that's not correct. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. Combinational circuits can't have feedback loops because that would create dependencies that could lead to oscillations or undefined states. So yes, combinational don't have feedback, while sequential do. So statement I is incorrect.

Then statement III says both must be controlled by an external clock. Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Combinational circuits don't need a clock because their outputs change as soon as the inputs change. They're event-driven. Sequential circuits, however, usually do require a clock to synchronize their state changes. So statement III is false because combinational don't need a clock. So III is incorrect.

Putting it all together: statement I is false, II is true, III is false. So which options are correct? The question asks which statements are true. So only statement II is correct. Looking at the options, option F says II only. So the answer should be F.

The question asks which statements about circuits are true. Let's analyze each statement:

1. **Statement I**: "Combinational circuits may have feedback; sequential circuits do not."  
   This is false. Combinational circuits do not have feedback because their output depends solely on current inputs. Sequential circuits, however, do have feedback as they rely on past inputs (memory) to determine their output.

2. **Statement II**: "Combinational circuits have a 'memoryless' property; sequential circuits do not."  
   This is true. Combinational circuits are memoryless because their output is determined entirely by current inputs. Sequential circuits, on the other hand, have memory as their output depends on both current and past inputs.

3. **Statement III**: "Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock."  
   This is false. Sequential circuits are typically controlled by a clock to synchronize state changes, but combinational circuits do not require a clock as their outputs change immediately with input changes.

Thus, only **Statement II** is true. The correct answer is **F: II only**.
