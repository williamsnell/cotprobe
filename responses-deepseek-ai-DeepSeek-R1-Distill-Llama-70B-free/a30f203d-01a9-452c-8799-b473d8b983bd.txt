Okay, so I have this problem where I need to maximize the entropy H(X) of a non-negative integer-valued random variable X. X can take values from 0 to infinity. The constraint given is that the expected value E(X) is 1. And I have to use the base 2 logarithm for evaluating the entropy. The options are from A to J, with various numerical values.

Hmm, I remember that entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness. For a discrete random variable, the entropy H(X) is calculated as the sum over all possible values x of P(x) log2(1/P(x)), which simplifies to - sum P(x) log2 P(x). So, H(X) = -Σ P(x) log2 P(x).

The goal is to maximize this entropy under the constraint that the expected value E(X) is 1. I think this is an optimization problem with a constraint, so maybe I should use Lagrange multipliers or something similar. Oh wait, I remember that for maximizing entropy with a given mean, the distribution that achieves this is called the maximum entropy distribution.

Oh right! For a random variable that takes non-negative integer values and has a finite expected value, the distribution that maximizes the entropy under the mean constraint is the geometric distribution. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. I might be mixing things up.

Wait, I think the correct distribution here is the geometric distribution, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be the Poisson distribution, but I think Poisson has a different setup. Or wait, perhaps it's the distribution where each outcome is as uniform as possible given the constraints.

Wait another thought: the maximum entropy distribution for a discrete variable with a given mean is the geometric distribution. Because the geometric distribution is the discrete analog of the exponential distribution, which is the maximum entropy distribution for a continuous variable with a given mean.

Wait, no, the maximum entropy distribution for a non-negative integer variable with E[X] = μ is the geometric distribution. Or wait: the geometric distribution models the number of trials until the first success, so its support is 1, 2, ... But here X is from 0 to infinity, so maybe including zero. So perhaps I need a shifted geometric distribution, or maybe a different parametrization.

Alternatively, I recall that the maximum entropy distribution on the non-negative integers with mean μ is a geometric distribution, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Wait, let me think again. The entropy-maximizing distribution under E[X]=μ is the one where the probabilities decrease exponentially with x. So, perhaps P(x) = k * r^x, where r is a parameter less than 1, and k is the normalization constant.

Wait, but the sum over x=0 to ∞ of P(x) must be 1. So P(x) = k r^x. The normalization condition would be sum_{x=0}^∞ k r^x = k * (1/(1 - r)) ) = 1. So k = 1 - r.

Then, the expectation E[X] is sum_{x=0}^∞ x P(x) = sum x k r^x. Hmm, I remember that sum_{x=0}^∞ x r^x = r/(1-r)^2. So E[X] = k * (r/(1 - r)^2 ). But k is 1 - r, so E[X] = (1 - r) * (r/(1 - r)^2 )) = r/(1 - r).

We are given that E[X] = 1. So 1 = r/(1 - r) → 1 - r = r → 1 = 2r → r = 1/2.

So the distribution is P(x) = (1 - r) r^x, with r = 1/2. So P(x) = (1/2) (1/2)^x = (1/2)^{x+1}.

Wait, but wait: if x starts at 0, then P(0) is (1/2)^(1) = 1/2, P(1)=1/4, etc. So the sum would be sum_{x=0}^∞ (1/2)^{x+1} = (1/2) sum (1/2)^x ) = (1/2) * 1/(1 - 1/2) ) = (1/2) * 2 = 1. So yes, that's correct.

So with r=1/2, we have P(x) = (1/2)^{x+1} for x = 0,1,2,...

Now, the entropy H(X) is H = - sum_{x=0}^∞ P(x) log2 P(x).

Substituting P(x):

H = - sum_{x=0}^∞ (1/2)^{x+1} log2( (1/2)^{x+1} )

Which simplifies to sum (1/2)^{x+1} * (x+1) log2(2) because log2( (1/2)^{x+1} ) = -(x+1) log2(2) = -(x+1)*1 = -(x+1).

So H = - sum (1/2)^{x+1} * ( - (x+1) )

Which is sum (x+1) (1/2)^{x+1}.

Wait, because the negative of P(x) log2 P(x) becomes positive.

So H = sum_{x=0}^\infty (x+1) (1/2)^{x+1}.

Let me compute this sum. Let's denote y = x + 1. So when x=0, y=1, and as x approaches infinity, y approaches infinity. So the sum becomes sum_{y=1}^\infty y (1/2)^y.

I remember that sum_{y=1}^\infty y r^y = r/(1 - r)^2, for |r| < 1. So here, r=1/2. So the sum is (1/2)/(1 - 1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/2)^2 = (1/2)/(1/4) ) = 2.

So H = 2.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.0. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. We have X as a non-negative integer (including zero) with E[X] = 1.

2. The maximum entropy distribution under this constraint is the geometric distribution with parameter r = 1/2, giving P(x) = (1/2)^{x+1}.

3. Then, the entropy H(X) is computed as sum (x+1)(1/2)^{x+1} which equals 2.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be B, which is 2.0.

To maximize the entropy \( H(X) \) of a non-negative integer-valued random variable \( X \), taking values from 0 to infinity, subject to the constraint \( E(X) = 1 \), we use the base 2 logarithm for the entropy calculation.

The entropy \( H(X) \) for a discrete random variable is given by:

\[
H(X) = -\sum_{x=0}^\infty P(x) \log_2 P(x),
\]

where \( P(x) \) is the probability distribution of \( X \). To maximize \( H(X) \) under the constraint \( E(X) = 1 \), the distribution that achieves this is the maximum entropy distribution. For a non-negative integer-valued random variable with a given mean, the maximum entropy distribution is the geometric distribution.

The geometric distribution is parametrized as:

\[
P(x) = k \cdot r^x,
\]

where \( r \) is a parameter (\( 0 < r < 1 \)) and \( k \) is the normalization constant. Using the normalization condition \( \sum_{x=0}^\infty P(x) = 1 \), we find:

\[
k = 1 - r.
\]

Thus, the distribution becomes:

\[
P(x) = (1 - r) \cdot r^x.
\]

The expected value \( E(X) \) for this distribution is:

\[
E(X) = \frac{r}{1 - r}.
\]

Given \( E(X) = 1 \), we solve for \( r \):

\[
1 = \frac{r}{1 - r} \implies 1 - r = r \implies r = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), the distribution becomes:

\[
P(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+1}.
\]

Now, the entropy \( H(X) \) is calculated as:

\[
H(X) = -\sum_{x=0}^\infty P(x) \log_2 P(x).
\]

Substituting \( P(x) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+1} \), we have:

\[
H(X) = -\sum_{x=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+1} \log_2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+1}.
\]

Using \( \log_2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+1} = -(x+1) \), this simplifies to:

\[
H(X) = \sum_{x=0}^\infty (x+1) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x+1}.
\]

Let \( y = x + 1 \). Then \( H(X) \) becomes:

\[
H(X) = \sum_{y=1}^\infty y \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^y.
\]

The sum \( \sum_{y=1}^\infty y r^y \) for \( |r| < 1 \) is known to be \( \frac{r}{(1 - r)^2} \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
H(X) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = 2.
\]

Thus, the maximum entropy \( H(X) \) is 2.0, which corresponds to option B.
