Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the measures of central tendency and the range for a given dataset. The family has eight children with ages: 9, 11, 8, 15, 14, 12, 17, 14. 

First, I need to remember what the measures of central tendency are. They include the mean, median, mode, and sometimes the range, but wait, I think the range is a measure of spread, not central tendency. Oh right, part (a) asks for central tendency, so that's mean, median, and mode. Part (b) is the range.

Let me start with part (a). 

1. **Mean**: The average of all the numbers. I'll add them up and divide by how many there are. Let's add the ages:

9 + 11 is 20, plus 8 is 28, +15=43, +14=57, +12=69, +17=86, +14=100. Wait, 8 numbers, so 100 divided by 8 equals 12.5. So the mean is 12.5 years.

2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is ordered. Since there are 8 numbers, which is even, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th numbers. Let me order the data:

8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17. So the 4th is 12, 5th is 14. The average is (12+14)/2 = 13. So median is 13.

Wait, wait, I thought earlier the median might be 12.5, but now I'm getting 13. Let me check that again. 

Looking at the ordered list: 8,9,11,12,14,14,15,17. Positions 4 and 5 are 12 and 14, so (12+14)/2 is indeed 13. So median is 13.

3. **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. Looking at the data:

14 appears twice, others once. So mode is 14.

Now part (b), the range. That's the difference between the highest and lowest values. The highest is 17, lowest is 8. So 17-8=9. Range is 9.

Now let me look at the options. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Mean 14, Median 12.5, Mode 13, Range 8. Hmm, mean is too high, I got 12.5. So A is wrong.

Option B: Mean 13? Wait, my mean was 12.5. So B's mean is 13, which doesn't match. So B is out.

Option C: Mean 13.5? No, that's higher than my 12.5. So C is wrong.

Option D: Mean 13. Again, my mean is 12.5. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Mean 12.5, median 12, mode 11. Wait, median I found was 13, mode is 14. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Mean 12? No, I have 12.5. So F wrong.

Option G: Mean 11.5, which is lower than I got, so no.

Option H: Mean 12.5, median 14. Oh wait, my median was 13. So H is wrong.

Option I: Mean 12.5, median 13, mode 14, range 9. That matches exactly what I calculated. 

Option J: Mean 15, which is way too high, so no.

So the correct answer is option I.

The ages of the eight children are 9, 11, 8, 15, 14, 12, 17, and 14. To solve the problem:

1. **Mean**: The average is calculated by summing all the ages and dividing by the number of children:  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{9 + 11 + 8 + 15 + 14 + 12 + 17 + 14}{8} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Median**: The data is ordered:  
   \[
   8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 14, 15, 17.
   \]  
   Since there are 8 values (even), the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values:  
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{12 + 14}{2} = 13 \, \text{years}.
   \]

3. **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently is 14, as it occurs twice. Thus, the mode is 14.

4. **Range**: The difference between the highest and lowest values:  
   \[
   \text{Range} = 17 - 8 = 9 \, \text{years}.
   \]

Now, comparing these results with the options provided:  
- Option I matches the calculated values: Mean = 12.5, Median = 13, Mode = 14, Range = 9.
