Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about brief crisis-oriented therapy, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Okay, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The question is asking about a characteristic of brief crisis-oriented therapy. I remember that in psychology, different therapies have different approaches. Crisis-oriented therapy, as the name suggests, is probably focused on addressing immediate issues or crises rather than long-term problems.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Avoid setting any specific goals to maintain flexibility. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think crisis therapy might set goals because they need to address the immediate problem quickly. If they don't set goals, how would they measure progress?

Option B: Focus on developing a deep understanding of the crisis before setting goals. Wait, that sounds more like a psychodynamic approach where they explore the issue in depth. But crisis therapy is usually short-term and focused on solving the problem, not necessarily deep exploration.

Option C: Try to ensure the client becomes calm and relaxed. That sounds more like relaxation techniques or maybe cognitive-behavioral approaches to manage anxiety. But is that the main focus of crisis therapy? I think the main goal is to resolve the crisis, which might involve more than just calming the client.

Option D: Agree upon clear-cut goals and keep sessions focused on these goals. This sounds plausible. Brief therapies often set specific goals because they have limited time. So in crisis therapy, they'd probably set clear goals to address the immediate problem efficiently.

Option E: Primarily use medication. No, I don't think that's right. Medication might be used in some cases, but crisis therapy is more about psychological intervention rather than relying mainly on drugs.

Option F: Encourage clients to disregard issues until later. That doesn't make sense. Crisis therapy is about addressing the issue now, not postponing it.

Option G: Focus on building long-term coping mechanisms. Brief therapy is usually short-term, so maybe they focus on immediate coping strategies rather than long-term ones. But I'm not certain.

Option H: Rely on group therapy. I don't think crisis therapy specifically relies on group settings. It's more about individual intervention in a crisis.

Option I: Explore early childhood experiences. That's more of a long-term psychodynamic approach, not brief crisis-oriented.

Option J: Be open and nondirective, allowing clients to explore all aspects. That sounds like a humanistic approach, maybe Rogerian therapy, which is more about self-exploration without direction. But crisis therapy is probably more directive to solve the immediate problem.

So, putting it together. Brief crisis-oriented therapy is short-term and focused on solving the immediate crisis. They would likely set clear goals to address the problem efficiently. So, the answer is probably D.

Wait, but let me think again. Option G says focus on long-term coping mechanisms, but since it's brief, maybe they focus on immediate strategies instead. But the question is about characteristics, so the main point is the goals. Crisis therapy is goal-oriented, so D makes sense.

The characteristic of brief crisis-oriented therapy is that it agrees upon clear-cut goals and keeps the sessions focused on these goals. This approach is efficient and directed toward resolving the immediate crisis.

Answer: D
