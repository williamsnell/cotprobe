Okay, so I've got this question about air velocity and temperature rise at a stagnation point. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking for the maximum air velocity that won't cause more than a 2°F temperature rise at the stagnation point. The air is at 70°F and 14.7 psia. Oh right, stagnation point is where the airflow comes to a stop, like the leading edge of an object in the airflow. So the kinetic energy of the air is converted into heat there, causing a temperature rise.

I remember that the stagnation temperature rise is related to the velocity of the air. There's probably an equation for this. Oh wait, the formula is something like (T2 - T1) = (V^2)/(2 * c_p * J), where J is the mechanical equivalent of heat. Or wait, maybe it's using the adiabatic index or something else. Let me think.

Wait, I think the formula for the stagnation temperature rise is ΔT = (V^2)/(2 * c_p * 1000) ??? No, maybe I'm mixing up units here. Alternatively, another approach: the temperature rise is due to the conversion of kinetic energy into internal energy. So the kinetic energy per unit mass is (V^2)/2, and since air is an ideal gas, the specific heat at constant pressure (c_p) would relate the energy to temperature change.

So the formula should be ΔT = (V^2)/(2 * c_p * 1000 * J), wait no, J is the conversion factor from mechanical work to heat, like 778 ft·lbf per BTU. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit tangled in the units here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to start from the basics. The stagnation temperature rise for air can be calculated using the relation:

ΔT = (V^2) / (2 * c_p * J)

Where:
- V is the velocity in ft/s
- c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure in BTU/(lb·°F)
- J is the mechanical equivalent of heat, which is 778 ft·lbf/BTU.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the units here. Let me check.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula as ΔT = (V²)/(2500) when using certain units. Wait, where does that 2500 come from? Let me think about the units.

Air's specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, is about 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F) or sometimes given as 0.24 in other units. Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the value. Oh wait, the problem provides a table with some constants. Let me check the table again.

Looking at the table for air, the specific weight is 0.0753 lb/ft³, and the gas constant R is 53.3 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful. Oh wait, the adiabatic constant k (gamma) is 1.40 for air. So specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, is (k/(k-1)) * R, where R is the specific gas constant. Wait, R for air is 53.3 ft·lbf/(slug·°R), right?

Wait, but specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, in units of BTU/(lb·°F) would be more convenient here. Let me think, 1 BTU is about 778 ft·lbf. So perhaps I can calculate c_p.

Wait, for air, the specific gas constant R is 53.3 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). The specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, is (gamma/(gamma-1)) * R. So gamma is 1.40, so (1.40)/(0.40) = 3.5. So 3.5 * 53.3 = 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

Wait, but 1 slug is 32.174 lbm. So to get c_p in BTU/(lb·°F), I need to convert the units.

Let me see: 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R) * (1 slug / 32.174 lbm) = 186.55 / 32.174 ≈ 5.8 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R).

Since 1 BTU is 778 ft·lbf, then 5.8 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R) divided by 778 ft·lbf/BTU gives (5.8/778) BTU/(lbm·°R). But since °R and °F are the same size, that's 5.8/778 ≈ 0.00746 BTU/(lbm·°F). Wait, but that seems really low. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, wait, I think I might be confusing specific heat per unit mass with per mole or something. Let me try a different approach.

I recall that the specific heat of air at constant pressure, c_p, is approximately 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). Let me just take that value as correct for this problem.

So if ΔT is 2°F, then we can set up the equation:

2 = (V^2) / (2 * 0.24 * J)

Wait, but what is J here? J is the mechanical equivalent of heat, 778 ft·lbf/BTU.

Wait, but the formula might be written differently. Another approach: the temperature rise is given by:

ΔT = (V^2) / (2 * c_p * J) * (1/1000) ?

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Alternatively, I've heard that the temperature rise can be calculated using the equation:

ΔT (°F) ≈ (V^2) / 2500

Where V is in ft/s. So if ΔT is 2°F, then:

2 = V² / 2500 → V² = 5000 → V ≈ 70.71 ft/s.

But wait, that would make the answer around 70 ft/s, which is option J. But looking at the options, J is 75 ft/s. Hmm, maybe I missed a factor.

Wait, maybe the formula is slightly different. Let me think again.

Another resource I recall says that the stagnation temperature rise is given by:

ΔT = (V^2)/(2500) → So V = sqrt(2500 * ΔT) → which would be sqrt(5000) ≈ 70.71 ft/s.

But that's not matching any of the options except perhaps J is 75, which is close. But looking at the options, option D is 200, E is 153, etc. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Maybe the formula uses a different specific heat value.

Let me try again. The formula for the stagnation temperature rise is:

ΔT = (V^2)/(2 * c_p * J) * (1 / 1000)

Wait, I'm getting confused with the units. Let me try to write the equation properly.

The kinetic energy per unit mass is (V^2)/2 in (ft²/s²). To convert this into a temperature rise, we use the relation:

ΔT = (V^2)/(2 * c_p * J)

Where:
- c_p is in BTU/(lb·°F)
- J is 778 ft·lbf/BTU
- V is in ft/s

So let's plug in the numbers. Let me get c_p right.

From the table, for air, the specific weight is 0.0753 lb/ft³. Wait, but I'm more interested in c_p in BTU units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate c_p using the gas constant R.

The gas constant R for air is given as 53.3 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). The specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, is (gamma/(gamma - 1)) * R.

Gamma for air is 1.40, so (1.40 / 0.40) = 3.5.

So c_p = 3.5 * 53.3 = 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

Now, to convert this into BTU/(lb·°F), let's go through the conversions.

1 slug = 32.174 lb mass.

1 BTU = 778 ft·lbf.

1 °R (Rankine) = 1 °F.

So, c_p in ft·lbf/(lb·°F) is 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R) * (1 slug / 32.174 lb) → 186.55 / 32.174 ≈ 5.8 ft·lbf/(lb·°F).

Now, to convert ft·lbf/(lb·°F) to BTU/(lb·°F): since 1 BTU = 778 ft·lbf,

c_p = 5.8 / 778 ≈ 0.00746 BTU/(lb·°F).

Wait, that seems really low. I thought c_p for air is around 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). Did I make a mistake?

Ah, wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me try again.

c_p = 3.5 * R, where R is 53.3 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

So 3.5 * 53.3 = 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

Now, 1 slug is 32.174 lb mass, so to get per lb mass:

186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R) * (1 slug / 32.174 lb) = 186.55 / 32.174 ≈ 5.8 ft·lbf/(lb·°R).

Since 1 BTU = 778 ft·lbf, then 5.8 ft·lbf = 5.8 / 778 BTU ≈ 0.00746 BTU.

So c_p is 0.00746 BTU/(lb·°F). Wait, but that's way too low. I must have done something wrong here. Because I know that the specific heat of air at constant pressure is about 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the units for R. Let me think again. The gas constant R is given as 53.3 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). So when I multiply by 3.5 (gamma/(gamma-1)), I get 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

But to get c_p in BTU/(lb·°F), I need to convert from ft·lbf/(slug·°R) to BTU/(lb·°F).

Wait, here's the step-by-step conversion:

1. 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R) = 186.55 ft·lbf/(32.174 lb·°R).

Because 1 slug = 32.174 lb.

So, 186.55 / 32.174 ≈ 5.8 ft·lbf/(lb·°R).

2. Now, convert ft·lbf to BTU:

Since 1 BTU = 778 ft·lbf, 5.8 ft·lbf = 5.8 / 778 BTU ≈ 0.00746 BTU.

So, c_p = 0.00746 BTU/(lb·°F).

Wait, but this is way lower than the 0.24 I remember. Did I miss a step? Because 0.00746 is about 1/30th of 0.24. Hmm, perhaps I should re-express R in different units.

Wait, maybe R is in ft·lbf/(slug·°R), but I need to find c_p in BTU/(lb·°F). Let me try to compute it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the relation between the temperature rise and velocity using the formula that ΔT = (V^2)/(2500) when ΔT is in °F and V in ft/s. Then, a 2°F rise would correspond to V = sqrt(2 * 2500) = sqrt(5000) ≈ 70.71 ft/s, which is about 71 ft/s. Looking at the options, J is 75 ft/s, which is close. But the options don't have 70, so perhaps 75 is the intended answer, but that would make the rise a bit more than 2°F. Alternatively, maybe the formula has a different denominator.

Wait, another possible formula I found in some references is ΔT = V² / (2 * 1000 * c_p * J). Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, let me use the correct formula:

The stagnation temperature rise is given by:

ΔT = (V²) / (2 * c_p * J)

Where:
- V is in ft/s
- J is 778 ft·lbf/BTU
- c_p is in BTU/(lb·°F)

So, let me plug in the numbers.

We need ΔT = 2°F.

So, 2 = V² / (2 * c_p * 778)

We need to find c_p in BTU/(lb·°F). From earlier calculations, I thought it's 0.24, but let me make sure.

Wait, the specific heat at constant pressure for air is indeed approximately 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). So let's use that.

So:

2 = V² / (2 * 0.24 * 778)

Calculate the denominator: 2 * 0.24 = 0.48; 0.48 * 778 ≈ 373.44.

So:

V² = 2 * 373.44 → 746.88

V = sqrt(746.88) ≈ 27.3 ft/s.

Wait, that's way lower than any of the options. So clearly, I'm using the wrong formula or the wrong value for c_p.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Another approach: the stagnation temperature rise is given by the conversion of kinetic energy to heat. So:

Kinetic energy per unit mass = V²/(2*gc), where gc is the gravitational constant in ft·lbf/(lb·s²).

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, the formula might be:

ΔT = (V²) / (2 * c_p * J) * (1/(2500)) ?

No, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, I found a reference that says the stagnation temperature rise is approximately ΔT (°F) = (V (ft/s))² / 2500. So for ΔT=2°F, V² = 2 * 2500 = 5000 → V ≈ 70.71 ft/s.

So the closest option would be J:75 ft/s. But wait, 70.71 isn't an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:225 ft/s

B:250 ft/s

C:100 ft/s

D:200 ft/s

E:153 ft/s

F:300 ft/s

G:50 ft/s

H:180 ft/s

I:125 ft/s

J:75 ft/s

So according to this, 70.71 is closest to J:75. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔT = V²/(2*1000). Then for ΔT=2, V²=4000 → V=63.25 ft/s. Still close to J.

Another thought, perhaps the formula is ΔT = V^2/(2 * 1000 * c_p). But without knowing the right formula, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe using the table's data. Let me look at the table for air again. The gas constant R is 53.3 ft·lbf/(slug·°R). The specific weight is 0.0753 lb/ft³. Hmm, perhaps I can calculate the specific heat.

Wait, for air, the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, is (gamma/(gamma-1)) * R. Gamma is 1.4, so (1.4/0.4)=3.5. So 3.5 * 53.3 = 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

Now, to convert this into BTU/(lb·°F):

1 slug = 32.174 lb.

So 186.55 ft·lbf/(slug·°R) = 186.55 / 32.174 ≈ 5.8 ft·lbf/(lb·°R).

Now, 1 BTU = 778 ft·lbf, so 5.8 ft·lbf = 5.8/778 ≈ 0.00746 BTU.

So c_p ≈ 0.00746 BTU/(lb·°F). Wait, that's way too low, as I thought earlier. Because I know c_p for air is about 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). So I must have made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should include the molecular weight. Let me think: R is specific gas constant, and it's equal to R_universal / molecular weight. The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·°R). Air has a molecular weight of about 28.97 lb/lbmol.

So R_specific = R_universal / M = 10.7316 * 778 / 28.97 ≈ let's see, wait, no, perhaps I should compute R in ft·lbf/(slug·°R).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to use the formula with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation:

ΔT = (V^2) / (2 * c_p * J) * (1 / 1000)

But I'm not making progress. Another approach: perhaps the temperature rise is given by ΔT = (V^2)/(2*cp*J), which would be in °F when V is in ft/s, cp in BTU/(lb·°F), and J=778.

So ΔT = V²/(2 * cp * 778)

We know ΔT is 2°F. So:

2 = V²/(2 * cp * 778)

If cp is 0.24, then:

V² = 2 * 0.24 * 778 * 2 → Wait, no. Let's compute:

V² = 2 * 2 * 0.24 * 778 → 2 * 2 is 4.
