Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. The problem is about a sequence of reactions that produce sodium sulfate, Na₂SO₄. The question has two parts: first, how many moles of Na₂SO₄ can be made starting with 1 mole of sulfur, and second, how many moles are possible with 4.5 grams of water. The options are given as A to J, each with two values.

Alright, let me look at the reactions provided:

1. S(s) + O₂(g) → SO₂(g)
2. 2 SO₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 SO₃(g)
3. SO₃(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₄(l)
4. 2 NaOH + H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄ + 2 H₂O

Hmm, okay. So the overall process starts with sulfur and goes through several steps to make sulfuric acid, which then reacts with sodium hydroxide to form sodium sulfate.

Let me break this down. The first step is the combustion of sulfur to form sulfur dioxide. Then, sulfur dioxide is oxidized to sulfur trioxide. The trioxide reacts with water to form sulfuric acid, which then neutralizes with NaOH to produce sodium sulfate.

I need to find out the mole production of Na₂SO₄ in two scenarios: when starting with 1 mole of S, and when 4.5 g of H₂O is available.

Starting with the first part: 1 mole of S.

Let me map out the stoichiometry.

Reaction 1: 1 mole S → 1 mole SO₂. So, 1:1 ratio.

Reaction 2: 2 moles SO₂ → 2 moles SO₃. So again, 1:1 ratio. So 1 mole SO₂ becomes 1 mole SO₃.

Reaction 3: 1 mole SO₃ + 1 mole H₂O → 1 mole H₂SO₄. So 1:1 again.

Reaction 4: 1 mole H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles NaOH to produce 1 mole Na₂SO₄ and 2 H₂O.

So, putting it all together, each mole of S produces 1 mole of H₂SO₄, which in turn produces 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. Because in the reactions, each step is 1:1, so 1 mole S → 1 mole SO₂ → 1 mole SO₃ → 1 mole H₂SO₄ → 1 mole Na₂SO₄. So yes, 1 mole S gives 1 mole Na₂SO₄. So the first part of the answer should be 1 mole.

Wait, but let me check the stoichiometry again in each step. For Reaction 2, 2 moles SO₂ produce 2 moles SO₃, so it's 1:1 per mole. So yes, 1 mole SO₂ becomes 1 mole SO₃.

Now for the second part: 4.5 grams of water. I need to find the maximum moles of Na₂SO₄ possible given this amount of water.

Wait, but water is only used in Reaction 3: SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄. So the amount of H₂O determines how much H₂SO₄ can be made, which in turn affects the amount of Na₂SO₄.

But wait, let me think about the stoichiometry. In Reaction 3, 1 mole SO₃ requires 1 mole H₂O to produce 1 mole H₂SO₄. So the amount of H₂O will limit the reaction.

So, let's find moles of H₂O in 4.5 grams.

Molar mass of H₂O is 18 g/mol. So 4.5 g / 18 g/mol = 0.25 moles H₂O.

So, 0.25 moles H₂O can produce 0.25 moles H₂SO₄. Then, each mole of H₂SO₄ makes 1 mole Na₂SO₄. So that's 0.25 moles Na₂SO₄.

Wait, but the question is about how many moles are possible, but wait, could there be a limiting factor elsewhere?

Wait, no, because in Reaction 3, it's 1 mole H₂O per mole of SO₃. So the H₂O is the limiting reagent here. So if you have only 0.25 moles of H₂O, you can only make 0.25 moles of H₂SO₄, which then makes 0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄.

Wait, but let me also consider the steps before. The H₂O comes into play only in Reaction 3, so prior steps don't affect the H₂O's availability. So from S to SO₂ to SO₃, you can make as much as you want, but the H₂O limits the H₂SO₄ production.

But wait, perhaps the prior steps could have their own limitations. For example, if in Reaction 2, the amount of O₂ is limited, but the problem doesn't specify any limitations on O₂ or NaOH. So I think the only limiting factors are the starting materials given: S and H₂O.

In the first part, starting with 1 mole S, there's enough O₂ and H₂O (assuming excess except what's specified). So 1 mole S → 1 mole Na₂SO₄.

In the second part, the only given mass is 4.5 g H₂O, which is 0.25 moles, so 0.25 moles Na₂SO₄.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how many moles could possibly be produced if you start with 1 mole of sulfur? How many moles are possible with 4.5 g of water?"

Wait, so when starting with 1 mole S, the maximum possible Na₂SO₄ is 1 mole. But when considering 4.5 g of H₂O, the maximum possible is 0.25 moles. So the two answers would be 1 and 0.25.

Looking at the options, let me see which option matches.

Option D says 1 mole and 0.25 moles. Option J says 2 and 0.25. Option A says 2 and 0.5. Hmm.

Wait, did I miss a step where the mole ratio is higher?

Wait, let me go back. Let me check the stoichiometry again for each reaction.

Reaction 1: 1 S → 1 SO₂.

Reaction 2: 2 SO₂ → 2 SO₃, so 1 mole SO₂ → 1 mole SO₃.

Reaction 3: 1 SO₃ + 1 H₂O → 1 H₂SO₄.

Reaction 4: 1 H₂SO₄ + 2 NaOH → 1 Na₂SO₄ + 2 H₂O.

So, correct, 1 mole of S gives 1 mole Na₂SO₄.

So the first answer is 1 mole.

The second part: 4.5 g H₂O is 0.25 moles, leading to 0.25 moles Na₂SO₄.

Looking at the options, the option that has 1 and 0.25 is option D: 1 and 0.25.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: let's map the entire process in terms of moles.

Starting with 1 mole S:

1 S → 1 SO₂ → 1 SO₃ → 1 H₂SO₄ → 1 Na₂SO₄.

So that's correct. So first part is 1 mole.

For the water part, 4.5 g H₂O is 0.25 moles. Since in Reaction 3, each mole of H₂O gives 1 mole H₂SO₄, and then 1 mole H₂SO₄ gives 1 mole Na₂SO₄, the maximum is 0.25 moles.

So the two answers are 1 and 0.25.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 1 mole and 0.25.

Yes, option D is the correct choice.

To determine how many moles of Na₂SO₄ can be produced, we analyze the sequence of reactions provided:

1. **Reaction 1**: \( S(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow SO_2(g) \)  
   1 mole of \( S \) produces 1 mole of \( SO_2 \).

2. **Reaction 2**: \( 2 SO_2(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2 SO_3(g) \)  
   1 mole of \( SO_2 \) produces 1 mole of \( SO_3 \).

3. **Reaction 3**: \( SO_3(g) + H_2O(l) \rightarrow H_2SO_4(l) \)  
   1 mole of \( SO_3 \) reacts with 1 mole of \( H_2O \) to produce 1 mole of \( H_2SO_4 \).

4. **Reaction 4**: \( 2 NaOH + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow Na_2SO_4 + 2 H_2O \)  
   1 mole of \( H_2SO_4 \) produces 1 mole of \( Na_2SO_4 \).

### Part 1: Starting with 1 mole of sulfur
From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of \( S \) produces 1 mole of \( Na_2SO_4 \). Therefore, the maximum amount of \( Na_2SO_4 \) that can be produced is **1 mole**.

### Part 2: Starting with 4.5 g of water
The molar mass of \( H_2O \) is 18 g/mol. Thus, 4.5 g of \( H_2O \) corresponds to:  
\[
\text{Moles of } H_2O = \frac{4.5}{18} = 0.25 \, \text{moles}.
\]  
From Reaction 3, 1 mole of \( H_2O \) produces 1 mole of \( H_2SO_4 \), which in turn produces 1 mole of \( Na_2SO_4 \). Therefore, 0.25 moles of \( H_2O \) can produce **0.25 moles of \( Na_2SO_4 \)**.

### Final Answer
The maximum amount of \( Na_2SO_4 \) that can be produced is **1 mole** when starting with 1 mole of sulfur and **0.25 moles** when starting with 4.5 g of water. Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: 1 mole of Na₂SO₄, 0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄**
