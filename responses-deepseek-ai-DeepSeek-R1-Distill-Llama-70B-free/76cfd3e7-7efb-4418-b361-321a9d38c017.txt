Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the gyrofrequency of an electron in a magnetic field. Hmm, I remember that the gyrofrequency is the frequency at which a charged particle, like an electron, spirals around a magnetic field. The formula must be something related to the charge, mass, and the magnetic field strength.

Wait, right, the formula for the gyrofrequency is f equals (qB)/(2πm), where q is the charge of the electron, B is the magnetic field, and m is the mass of the electron. Oh wait, or was it (eB)/(2πm_e)? Yeah, because the charge of the electron is e, and m_e is the electron mass.

So first, I need to plug in the values. Let's see, the magnetic field B here is 10 kilogauss. Oh, wait, kilogauss is 1e3 gauss, so 10 kilogauss is 10,000 gauss. But wait, in SI units, the magnetic field is measured in teslas. I remember that 1 tesla equals 10^4 gauss. So 1 gauss is 1e-4 tesla. So 10,000 gauss is 10,000 * 1e-4 T = 1 tesla. Wait, let me double-check that: 1 T = 10^4 gauss. So 10,000 gauss is 1 T. Got it.

So B is 1 T. That makes things easier. Now, the charge of an electron e is approximately 1.6e-19 coulombs. The mass of the electron m_e is about 9.1e-31 kilograms. Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 2π is about 6.2832.

Putting it all together: f = (e * B) / (2π m_e). Let's plug in the numbers.

So e is 1.6e-19 C, B is 1 T. So numerator is 1.6e-19 * 1 = 1.6e-19. Denominator is 2π times 9.1e-31 kg. Let me compute the denominator first.

2π is approximately 6.2832, and 6.2832 multiplied by 9.1e-31. Let me calculate that. 6.2832 * 9.1 is approx 57.2 (since 6 *9=54, 0.2832*9≈2.5488; 6*0.1=0.6, 0.2832*0.1≈0.02832. So 54 + 2.5488 + 0.6 + 0.02832 = about 57.177. So 57.177e-31? Wait, no, because 9.1e-31 is 9.1 times 1e-31, so 6.2832 * 9.1e-31 = (6.2832 *9.1) * 1e-31. So 6.2832 *9.1 is about 57.17, so denominator is 57.17e-31.

Wait, no, wait: 2π m_e is 6.2832 * 9.1e-31 kg. So that's 6.2832 *9.1 = let me compute that accurately. 6 *9.1 is 54.6, 0.2832 *9.1 is about 2.578. So 54.6 +2.578 is 57.178. So denominator is 57.178e-31 kg.

So now, f = (1.6e-19) / (57.178e-31). Let me compute that. Dividing the numerator and denominator:

1.6e-19 / 57.178e-31 = (1.6 /57.178) * 1e12 (since 1e-19 /1e-31 is 1e12).

1.6 /57.178 is approximately 0.028. So 0.028 *1e12 is 2.8e10 cycles per second (Hz). 

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise numbers. Maybe I approximated too much. Let me recalculate e*B/(2π m_e) with more precise values.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C (exact value as per current standards)
m_e = 9.1093837015e-31 kg
pi is about 3.1415926536.

So B is 1 T.

So f = (e*B)/(2*pi*m_e) = (1.602176634e-19 * 1) / (2 * 3.1415926536 * 9.1093837015e-31 )

Let me compute the denominator first: 2 * pi * m_e = 2 *3.1415926536 *9.1093837015e-31.

2 * pi is about 6.283185307. Multiply by 9.1093837015e-31.

6.283185307e0 * 9.1093837015e-31 = (6.283185307 *9.1093837015) * 1e-31.

Let me compute 6.283185307 *9.1093837015:

6 *9.10938 is about 54.65628. 0.283185307 *9.10938: 0.2 *9.10938 is 1.821876, 0.08*9.10938=0.728750, 0.003185307*9.10938≈0.02899. So total is 1.821876 +0.72875=2.550626 +0.02899≈2.579616. So total is 54.65628 +2.579616 = 57.235896.

So denominator is 57.235896e-31.

Now numerator is 1.602176634e-19.

So f = (1.602176634e-19) / (57.235896e-31) = (1.602176634 /57.235896 ) * 1e12.

Compute 1.602176634 /57.235896.

Let me compute this division. 1.602176634 ÷ 57.235896.

Well, 57.235896 * 0.028 is approximately 1.602. Let me see: 57.2359 *0.028 = 1.6026. Because 57.2359 *0.02 = 1.1447, 57.2359 *0.008=0.4579, so 1.1447 + 0.4579=1.6026. So 0.028 gives 1.6026, but our numerator is 1.6021766. So close enough. So 0.028 approx. So 0.028 *1e12 is 2.8e10 Hz.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.8e10 cps. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the division.

Alternatively, let me compute 1.602176634 /57.235896.

I can compute this as 1.602176634 ÷ 57.235896 ≈ 0.028. Let me see:

57.235896 * 0.028 = ?

57 * 0.028 = 1.596

0.235896 *0.028 ≈ 0.0066

So total is approximately 1.596 +0.0066=1.6026.

Which is just a bit higher than 1.602176634. So 0.028 gives 1.6026, which is a bit higher than 1.602176634. So maybe 0.028 - a little less. Let's find the exact value.

Let me compute 57.235896 * x = 1.602176634.

x=1.602176634/57.235896.

Let me do the division step by step.

57.235896 | 1.602176634

57.235896 goes into 160.2176634 how many times? Let me adjust the decimal.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute as:

57.235896 ) 1.602176634 ( 

We can think in terms of 1.602176634 ÷ 57.235896 ≈ 0.028.

But let me compute 57.235896 * 0.028 = 1.6026, as before. So 0.028 would give 1.6026, but the numerator is 1.6021766, which is 1.6021766. So 1.6021766 is 0.0004234 less than 1.6026.

So 0.0004234 / 57.235896 would be how much? 0.0004234 /57.235896 ≈ 7.4e-6. So subtracting that from 0.028, we get approximately 0.0279926.

So x ≈ 0.0279926. So 0.0279926 * 1e12 = 2.79926e10 Hz, which is approximately 2.8e10 cps.

So the closest option is J, which is 2.8 ×10^10 cps.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 2.1e10
B:1.2e10
C:1.5e10
D:1.8e10
E:3.5e10
F:5.5e10
G:3.2e10
H:4.0e10
I:2.5e10
J:2.8e10

So option J is 2.8e10, which is what I got. So the correct answer is J.

To determine the gyrofrequency of an electron in a magnetic field of 10 kilogauss (10,000 gauss), we use the formula:

\[
f = \frac{eB}{2\pi m_e}
\]

Where:
- \( e = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) (charge of the electron),
- \( B = 1 \, \mathrm{T} \) (magnetic field, converted from \( 10 \, \mathrm{kilogauss} = 10,000 \, \mathrm{gauss} = 1 \, \mathrm{T} \)),
- \( m_e = 9.1093837015 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( \pi \approx 3.1415926536 \).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
\[
2\pi m_e = 2 \times 3.1415926536 \times 9.1093837015 \times 10^{-31}
\]
\[
2\pi m_e = 6.283185307 \times 9.1093837015 \times 10^{-31} \approx 57.235896 \times 10^{-31}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the numerator
\[
eB = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \times 1 = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the frequency
\[
f = \frac{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}}{57.235896 \times 10^{-31}}
\]
\[
f = \frac{1.602176634}{57.235896} \times 10^{12}
\]
\[
f \approx 0.028 \times 10^{12} = 2.8 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{Hz}
\]

### Final Answer
The gyrofrequency of the electron is approximately \( 2.8 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cps} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
