Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two identical blocks of aluminum. One is at 1300 K and the other at 400 K. They're brought into thermal communication, meaning they can exchange heat, and eventually reach the same temperature. I'm supposed to calculate the irreversibility of the process. The specific heat of aluminum is given as 0.9 kJ/kg·°K, and each block has a mass of 5 kg. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that when two objects reach thermal equilibrium, the heat lost by the hotter one equals the heat gained by the cooler one. But wait, no, that's only if they're insulated from the surroundings. But in this case, since they're in communication, maybe they're isolated together? So the heat lost by the hotter block should equal the heat gained by the cooler one.

So, the formula for heat transfer is Q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass, c specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Let me denote the final temperature as Tf. The hot block (initial T1 =1300 K) will lose heat, so its temperature drops to Tf. The cold block (T2=400 K) gains heat, so its temp rises to Tf.

So, the heat lost by the hot block is Q1 = m * c * (T1 - Tf)
And the heat gained by the cold block is Q2 = m * c * (Tf - T2)

Since Q1 should equal Q2, because heat lost equals heat gained, right?

So, m * c * (1300 - Tf) = m * c * (Tf - 400)

Wait, but since m and c are the same for both blocks, they cancel out on both sides. So, 1300 - Tf = Tf - 400.

Let me solve for Tf.

1300 +400 = 2 Tf
1700 = 2 Tf
Tf=850 K.

Wait, that makes sense. Both blocks reach 850 K.

Now, the next part is about irreversibility. I remember that irreversibility in thermodynamics is related to entropy generation. Because irreversibility is a measure of how much entropy is generated during a process.

Oh right, the formula for irreversibility I is given by I = T0 * S_gen, where S_gen is the entropy generated, and T0 is the reference temperature, usually the ambient temperature. But wait, sometimes in these problems, if the process is considered to exchange heat with the environment, T0 might be the environmental temperature. But in this case, the two blocks are just exchanging heat between themselves, so maybe T0 is the final temperature? Or perhaps it's the temperature of the surroundings when the heat is transferred. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the total entropy change of the universe is the sum of the entropy changes of both blocks. Since they are isolated from the surroundings (they're just in contact with each other), the heat transfer is between them, so the entropy change of the universe would be S1 + S2, where S1 is the entropy change of the hot block and S2 that of the cold block.

Entropy change for each block would be ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial) if it's a temperature change. But wait, for a heating or cooling process, the formula is ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial) + (heat exchanged)/temperature if it's at a constant temperature. Wait, no, when the process is a change in temperature, the entropy change is m c ln(T_final / T_initial) only if it's a reversible process, which it's not necessarily here.

Wait, no, more accurately, for a process where the temperature changes, the entropy change is m c ln(T_final / T_initial) regardless of reversibility because entropy is a state function. So I can calculate the entropy change for each block as m c ln(T_final / T_initial) for the hot block and similarly for the cold block.

So let's compute the entropy change for each.

For the hot block: it's cooling down from 1300 K to 850 K. So its entropy change ΔS1 = m c ln(850/1300)
For the cold block: heating up from 400 K to 850 K. So ΔS2 = m c ln(850/400)

So total entropy change S_gen = ΔS1 + ΔS2.

Let me compute these.

First, compute each term.

m =5 kg, c=0.9 kJ/kg·K.

ΔS1 =5 * 0.9 * ln(850/1300)
ΔS2 =5 * 0.9 * ln(850/400)

Compute the ratios inside the logs.

850/1300 ≈ 0.6538
850/400 = 2.125

So ln(0.6538) is negative because it's less than 1, and ln(2.125) is positive.

Compute ln(0.6538): Approximately, ln(0.65) is about -0.4308 (I remember that ln(1/2) is -0.6931, and 0.65 is a bit higher than 1/2, so maybe around -0.43). Let me double-check using a calculator approach. Let me think: 0.6538 is about e^(-0.43) ≈ 1 -0.43 + 0.43²/2 - ... Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator function, but since I'm doing this in my head, perhaps I can remember that ln(2/3) is about -0.4055. Wait, 2/3 is 0.6667, which is higher than 0.6538. So ln(0.6538) is a bit lower than ln(2/3) → about -0.42 maybe.

Similarly, ln(2.125) is ln(2) + ln(1.0625) ≈ 0.6931 + 0.0606 ≈ 0.7537.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator approach for better approximation.

Compute ln(850/1300) = ln(17/26) ≈ let me compute 17/26 = 0.6538.

Compute ln(0.6538):

We know that e^(-0.43) = approx 1 -0.43 + 0.43²/2 - 0.43³/6 + 0.43^4/24...

But perhaps it's easier to use known ln values.

Wait, ln(0.5) = -0.6931, ln(0.6)= approx -0.5108, ln(0.7)= -0.3567, ln(0.75)= -0.2877, ln(0.8)= -0.2231, ln(0.85)= -0.1625.

Wait, 0.6538 is between 0.65 and 0.66.

Compute ln(0.65): Let me use linear approximation.

We know that ln(0.6) is -0.5108, ln(0.7) is -0.3567.

Wait, 0.65 is 0.05 above 0.6, and between 0.6 and 0.7, which is 0.1.

The change in ln from 0.6 to 0.7 is from -0.5108 to -0.3567, which is +0.1541 over 0.1 increase in x.

So per 0.01 increase in x, the change is 0.1541/10 = 0.01541 per 0.01.

So from x=0.6 to x=0.65, that's 0.05 increase.

So the change in ln is 0.05 * (0.1541 / 0.1) ) = 0.05 * 1.541 = 0.07705.

So ln(0.65) = ln(0.6) + 0.07705 = -0.5108 + 0.07705 ≈ -0.43375.

Similarly, for x=0.6538, which is 0.65 + 0.0038, so an additional 0.0038 beyond 0.65.

So the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x. At x=0.65, 1/x ≈ 1.5385.

So the change in ln for dx=0.0038 is approx 1.5385 * 0.0038 ≈ 0.00585.

So ln(0.6538) ≈ ln(0.65) + 0.00585 ≈ (-0.43375) + 0.00585 ≈ -0.4279.

So approximately, ln(850/1300) ≈ -0.4279.

Similarly, ln(850/400) = ln(2.125). Let's compute that.

We know that ln(2) = 0.6931, ln(e) = 1, and 2.125 is 2 + 0.125.

Alternatively, using known points: ln(2) = 0.6931, ln(2.1) ≈ 0.7419, ln(2.12) ≈ ?

Alternatively, I can use a Taylor expansion around a=2.

Let me compute ln(2.125) using the expansion around a=2.

f(x) = ln(x)
f'(x) = 1/x.

At x=2, f(x)=0.6931, f'(2)=0.5.

We can approximate ln(2 + 0.125) ≈ f(2) + 0.125 * f'(2) = 0.6931 + 0.125 * 0.5 = 0.6931 + 0.0625 = 0.7556.

But wait, the actual value of ln(2.125) is about 0.7542, so this approximation is pretty close.

So, ln(2.125) ≈ 0.7542.

So now, let's compute ΔS1 and ΔS2.

ΔS1 = 5 kg * 0.9 kJ/kg·K * (-0.4279) 
= 5 * 0.9 * (-0.4279)
= 4.5 * (-0.4279) ≈ -1.92555 kJ/K.

ΔS2 =5 kg * 0.9 kJ/kg·K * 0.7542 
=4.5 * 0.7542 ≈ 3.3939 kJ/K.

So total entropy change S_gen = ΔS1 + ΔS2 = (-1.92555) + 3.3939 ≈ 1.46835 kJ/K.

Now, irreversibility I is given by I = T0 * S_gen.

Wait, but what is T0 here? Because the formula I = T0 * ΔS_total, where T0 is the temperature of the surroundings when heat is transferred to or from them. But in this case, the heat transfer is between the two blocks. Since the system is isolated (only the two blocks), the surroundings aren't involved. So does that mean that T0 is the temperature at which the heat transfer occurs? Or perhaps, since the process is internal, the irreversibility would be calculated based on the final temperature.

Wait, I think when a system undergoes an internal process and the heat transfer is between parts of the system, the entropy generated is the sum of the entropy changes of each part. So the irreversibility would then be I = T_final * S_gen.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula where the irreversibility is the lost work, which is I = T0 * S_gen. But if the process is adiabatic and the system is isolated, then T0 would be the temperature of the surroundings. But in this case, the two blocks are isolated from the surroundings, so maybe T0 is the final temperature Tf.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the second law. The irreversibility (or the lost work) can be determined by the entropy generated multiplied by the temperature at which it's generated, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, I've also read that the irreversibility can be calculated as the difference between the heat transferred and the work done, but that's perhaps more in the context of heat engines.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entropy generated during the process is S_gen = 1.46835 kJ/K. The irreversibility I is given by I = T0 * S_gen, where T0 is the temperature of the reservoir if heat is being transferred. But in this case, the process is between two parts of the system, so perhaps T0 is the final temperature, as that's the only temperature present.

Alternatively, when two parts of a system interact, the entropy generated can be used with the final temperature to find the irreversibility.

So, perhaps I should use I = T_final * S_gen.

T_final is 850 K.

So I = 850 K * 1.46835 kJ/K = 850 * 1.46835.

Let me compute that.

Compute 1.46835 * 850.

First, 1 * 850 = 850.

0.46835 * 850: Let's compute 0.4 *850=340, 0.06*850=51, 0.00835*850≈7.0975.

So 340 +51=391, plus 7.0975= 398.0975.

So total I ≈850 + 398.0975 =1248.0975 kJ.

Wait, that can't be right, because looking at the answer options, the highest is 750 kJ (option B). So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the irreversibility is calculated as the difference in the heat transfer from the hot block and the cold block, but that doesn't seem right because for an isolated system, the heat lost by one equals the heat gained by the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific heat should be in J instead of kJ? No, I used kJ in the calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me go back to the problem. The question is about the irreversibility of the process. I think I might have confused the formula for irreversibility. Another approach I remember is that the irreversibility I is equal to the heat transfer multiplied by the temperature difference divided by the lower temperature. Hmm, no, perhaps that's for a different situation.

Alternatively, I've read that for two bodies exchanging heat without external interaction, the irreversibility can be calculated using I = Q_T (1 - T_L / T_H), where Q_T is the heat transferred from the hot body, T_L is the temperature of the cold body, and T_H the temperature of the hot body. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when they reach equilibrium, the heat transfer is Q = m c (Tf - T_initial) for each.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The formula for irreversibility I is given by:

I = Q_H (1 - T_L / T_H) 

where Q_H is the heat lost by the hot body, T_L is the temperature of the cold body (but in this case, it's the final temperature since heat is being transferred to the cold body which then warms up). Wait, perhaps that's not the correct formula.

Alternatively, I think that the irreversibility when heat Q is transferred from a reservoir at T_H to another at T_L is I = Q (1 - T_L / T_H). But in this problem, the two blocks are just brought into contact, so the heat Q is Q1 = m c (T1 - Tf), and Q2 = m c (Tf - T2).

Wait, perhaps the entropy generated S_gen is the sum of the two entropy changes, which I calculated as 1.46835 kJ/K. Then, the irreversibility would be I = T0 * S_gen. Now, what is T0 here? If the process is occurring in a system where the heat is transferred at the final temperature, perhaps T0 is Tf, 850 K.

So I = 850 K * 1.46835 kJ/K = around 1248 kJ, which isn't among the answer options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another formula I remember is that the irreversibility is the difference between the work output of a reversible process and the actual work output. But in this case, there's no work involved, just heat transfer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for irreversibility when two masses exchange heat is:

I = m c (T1 - T2) [ (T2)/(T1) )^{(m c)/(m c)} } ]

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think about the entropy generated.

Wait, the entropy generated is S_gen = S_hot + S_cold.

Which is what I calculated earlier as 1.46835 kJ/K.

So the irreversibility is I = T0 * S_gen.

But perhaps T0 is the average temperature or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat transfer and then the entropy. Let me think again.

The heat lost by the hot block is Q1 = m c (T1 - Tf) =5 *0.9*(1300-850)=5*0.9*450=5*405=2025 kJ.

Similarly, the heat gained by the cold block is Q2=5*0.9*(850-400)=5*0.9*450=2025 kJ.

So the heat exchanged is 2025 kJ from the hot to the cold.

Now, the entropy change for the hot block is Q1 / T_avg_hot, where T_avg_hot is some average temperature. Wait, no, the entropy change is integral of dQ/T. For a process where temperature changes, it's m c ln(Tf / T_initial). Which is what I did earlier.

So S_gen = m c ln(Tf/T1) + m c ln(Tf/T2) = m c [ln(Tf/T1) + ln(Tf/T2)].

Which can be written as m c ln( (Tf^2)/(T1 T2) ).

So, plugging in the numbers:

m=5, c=0.9, Tf=850, T1=1300, T2=400.

So,

S_gen =5 * 0.9 * ln( (850^2)/(1300 * 400) )

Compute 850^2 =722500.

Denominator:1300*400=520,
