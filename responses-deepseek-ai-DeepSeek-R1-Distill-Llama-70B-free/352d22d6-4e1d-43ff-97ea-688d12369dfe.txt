Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem says:

We have two independent random variables, X₁ and X₂. Their probability density functions (pdfs) are given as f₁(x₁) = 2x₁ for 0 < x₁ < 1, and f₂(x₂) = 4x₂³ for 0 < x₂ < 1. We need to compute the probability P(0.5 < X₁ < 1 and 0.4 < X₂ < 0.8).

Hmm, okay. Since X₁ and X₂ are independent, their joint probability density function is the product of their individual pdfs. So the joint pdf f(x₁, x₂) should be f₁(x₁) * f₂(x₂).

So the joint pdf is f(x₁,x₂) = (2x₁)(4x₂³) = 8x₁x₂³. But wait, that's only valid for 0 < x₁ <1 and 0 < x₂ <1, right? Because each pdf is defined in that interval.

Now, to find the probability P(0.5 < X₁ <1 and 0.4 < X₂ <0.8), since the variables are independent, this is the same as P(0.5 < X₁ <1) multiplied by P(0.4 < X₂ <0.8). Because for independent events, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, when variables are independent, the joint probability for two events (like A and B) is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). So yes, that's correct.

So I can compute each probability separately and then multiply them.

Let me compute P(0.5 < X₁ <1) first. Since X₁'s pdf is f₁(x₁)=2x₁, the probability is the integral of f₁ from 0.5 to 1.

So P1 = ∫ from 0.5 to 1 of 2x₁ dx₁.

Integrating 2x₁ gives x₁². Evaluated from 0.5 to 1:

At 1: (1)^2 =1.

At 0.5: (0.5)^2=0.25.

So P1 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75, which is 3/4.

Wait, 0.75 is 3/4 yes. So P1 is 3/4.

Now, compute P(0.4 < X₂ <0.8). X₂'s pdf is f₂(x₂)=4x₂³.

So P2 = ∫ from 0.4 to 0.8 of 4x₂³ dx₂.

The integral of 4x²³ is 4*(x₂^4)/4) evaluated from 0.4 to 0.8. Wait, integrating x²³ gives x^(4)/4, so 4 times that would be x^4.

So P2 = [x₂^4] from 0.4 to 0.8 = (0.8)^4 - (0.4)^4.

Let me compute each term.

0.8^4: 0.8 squared is 0.64. Squared again: 0.64^2 = 0.4096.

Similarly, 0.4^4: 0.4 squared is 0.16, squared again is 0.0256.

So P2 = 0.4096 - 0.0256 = 0.384.

Wait, 0.384 is the same as 384/1000. Let me convert it to a fraction.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in fractions. Let's see:

Wait, 0.8 is 4/5, so (4/5)^4 = (256)/(625) because 4^4=256 and 5^4=625.

Similarly, 0.4 is 2/5. So (2/5)^4=16/625.

So P2 = (256/625) - (16/625) = (240/625).

Simplify that fraction: 240 ÷ 5 =48, 625 ÷5=125. So 48/125.

So P2 is 48/125.

Wait, but wait, I thought P2 was 0.384, which is 384/1000, which reduces to 96/250, then 48/125. Yes, that's correct. So P2 is 48/125.

Now, since X₁ and X₂ are independent, the joint probability P is P1 * P2.

So P = (3/4) * (48/125).

Let me compute that. 3/4 *48/125.

Multiply numerators: 3 *48 = 144.

Multiply denominators:4 *125=500.

So P = 144/500.

Simplify this fraction. Let's see, both are divisible by 4: 144 ÷4=36, 500 ÷4=125.

So 36/125.

Wait, 36/125 is 0.288. Does that make sense? Let's check the calculations again.

Wait, P1 was 3/4, which is 0.75. P2 was 48/125, which is 0.384. 0.75 * 0.384 = ?

0.75 * 0.384: Let's compute 0.75 * 0.384.

0.75 is 3/4, so 3/4 * 0.384 = 0.75 * 0.384.

Well, 0.75 * 0.384: 0.75 * 0.3 is 0.225, 0.75 * 0.08 is 0.06, 0.75 *0.004=0.003.

Adding those: 0.225 +0.06=0.285 +0.003=0.288. So 0.288 is 36/125.

So the answer should be 36/125.

Looking at the options, option B is 36/125. So the correct answer is B.

To solve the problem, we need to compute the probability \( P(0.5 < X_1 < 1 \text{ and } 0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) \), where \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent random variables with given probability density functions (pdfs):

- \( f_1(x_1) = 2x_1 \) for \( 0 < x_1 < 1 \),
- \( f_2(x_2) = 4x_2^3 \) for \( 0 < x_2 < 1 \).

Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:

\[
P(0.5 < X_1 < 1 \text{ and } 0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) = P(0.5 < X_1 < 1) \cdot P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( P(0.5 < X_1 < 1) \)
The probability \( P(0.5 < X_1 < 1) \) is given by the integral of \( f_1(x_1) \) over the interval \( [0.5, 1] \):

\[
P(0.5 < X_1 < 1) = \int_{0.5}^1 f_1(x_1) \, dx_1 = \int_{0.5}^1 2x_1 \, dx_1.
\]

The integral of \( 2x_1 \) is \( x_1^2 \). Evaluating this from 0.5 to 1:

\[
P(0.5 < X_1 < 1) = \left[ x_1^2 \right]_{0.5}^1 = 1^2 - (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) \)
The probability \( P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) \) is given by the integral of \( f_2(x_2) \) over the interval \( [0.4, 0.8] \):

\[
P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) = \int_{0.4}^{0.8} f_2(x_2) \, dx_2 = \int_{0.4}^{0.8} 4x_2^3 \, dx_2.
\]

The integral of \( 4x_2^3 \) is \( x_2^4 \). Evaluating this from 0.4 to 0.8:

\[
P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) = \left[ x_2^4 \right]_{0.4}^{0.8} = (0.8)^4 - (0.4)^4.
\]

First, compute \( (0.8)^4 \) and \( (0.4)^4 \):

\[
(0.8)^4 = (4/5)^4 = 256/625, \quad (0.4)^4 = (2/5)^4 = 16/625.
\]

Thus:

\[
P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) = 256/625 - 16/625 = 240/625 = 48/125.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Joint Probability
Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent, the joint probability is:

\[
P(0.5 < X_1 < 1 \text{ and } 0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) = P(0.5 < X_1 < 1) \cdot P(0.4 < X_2 < 0.8).
\]

Substitute the results:

\[
P = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{48}{125} = \frac{144}{500}.
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{144}{500} = \frac{36}{125}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability \( P(0.5 < X_1 < 1 \text{ and } 0.4 < X_2 < 0.8) \) is \( \frac{36}{125} \). From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: \( \frac{36}{125} \)**.
