Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the radius of the circle formed by an electron beam when it's bent by the Earth's magnetic field. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when charged particles move through a magnetic field, they experience a force that makes them curve. Oh right, the Lorentz force.

Wait, the formula for this situation. I think it's something about the magnetic force providing the centripetal force. So the equation would be qvB = mv²/r. Oh right, because F = q(v × B) and for circular motion, F = mv²/r. So setting them equal, qvB = mv²/r. 

Let me write that down: qvB = (mv^2)/r. I can cancel out the v from both sides, so that gives qB = mv/r. Then, solving for r, I get r = mv/(qB). 

Okay, so I need to plug in the values. The speed v is 1e7 m/s. The magnetic field B is 5e-5 T. What about the mass and charge of an electron? Oh yeah, the charge q is 1.6e-19 C, and the mass m is 9.1e-31 kg. 

Putting it all together: r = (m*v) / (q*B). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately. 

Numerator: m*v = 9.1e-31 kg * 1e7 m/s. Let's calculate that. 9.1e-31 * 1e7 is 9.1e-24 kg·m/s.

Denominator: q*B = 1.6e-19 C * 5e-5 T. Let's see, 1.6e-19 *5e-5 = 8e-24 C·T. Oh wait, Tesla is kg/(s²·A), but units might not matter here as I'm just calculating the value.

So r = (9.1e-24) / (8e-24) = 9.1/8 = approximately 1.1375. 

Wait, 9.1 divided by 8 is about 1.14 meters? So looking at the options, that's not matching any of the first few I see. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate m*v. 9.1e-31 kg * 1e7 m/s. 1e7 is 10^7, so 9.1e-31 * 1e7 is 9.1e-24, that's correct. And q*B is 1.6e-19 *5e-5 = (1.6*5)e-(19+5) = 8e-24. So 9.1e-24 /8e-24 is 1.1375 meters. Hmm, the options are A to J, let me look again.

The options are:

A: 0.1 m

B:1 mm

C:1 μm

D:0.01 m

E:1 m

F:10 m

G:1 cm

H:1 km

I:1 nm

J:100 m

Wait, my calculation gave me about 1.14 meters, which is closest to option E:1 m. But wait, let me check my numbers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I forgot a power of ten somewhere.

Wait, the speed is 1e7, which is 10^7, correct. m is 9.1e-31, right. So m*v is 9.1e-31 *1e7=9.1e-24. q is 1.6e-19, B is 5e-5: so 1.6e-19*5e-5 = 8e-24. So yeah, 9.1e-24 /8e-24 is 1.1375. Hmm, that's about 1.14 meters. So the closest option is E:1 m, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, 9.1 divided by 8 is 1.1375. So approximately 1.14 m. Looking at the options, the available are 1 m (E) and 10 m (F), 0.1 m (A). So 1.14 is closer to 1 m than to 0.1 or 10. But let me think, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake with the charge. Electrons have a negative charge, but the magnitude is correct here. So that's not the issue. Oh, wait, the Earth's magnetic field might have a different orientation, but I don't think that affects the magnitude of the radius. So no, that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed was given in a different unit? No, it's 1e7 m/s, which is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 9.1e-31 *1e7 = 9.1e-24 kg·m/s. qB is 1.6e-19 *5e-5 = (1.6*5) =8, so 8e-24 (C·T). So when I divide, 9.1e-24/8e-24 equals 9.1/8, which is 1.1375. So that's 1.1375 meters, which is approximately 1.14 meters. So the closest option is E:1 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.01 m (1 cm), which is much smaller. So why isn't the radius smaller? Because electrons are light, but the speed is quite high. Wait, 1e7 m/s is a tenth the speed of light, which is pretty fast.

Wait, another thought: Earth's magnetic field is 5e-5 T, which is about 0.5 Gauss (since 1 Tesla is 10,000 Gauss, so 5e-5 T is 0.5 Gauss). So yeah, the calculation seems right.

I think I should go with E:1 m. But wait, looking back, the options list E as 1 m, which matches our calculation.

To determine the radius of the circle formed by the electron beam in the Earth's magnetic field, we use the relationship between the magnetic force and centripetal force:

\[
qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r}
\]

Rearranging for \( r \), the radius of the circular path:

\[
r = \frac{mv}{qB}
\]

### Given values:
- Speed of electrons: \( v = 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Magnetic field: \( B = 5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{T} \)
- Charge of an electron: \( q = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \)
- Mass of an electron: \( m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \)

### Calculation:
1. Numerator: \( m \cdot v = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 10^7 = 9.1 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
2. Denominator: \( q \cdot B = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \cdot 5 \times 10^{-5} = 8 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{C·T} \)
3. Radius: 
   \[
   r = \frac{9.1 \times 10^{-24}}{8 \times 10^{-24}} = \frac{9.1}{8} \approx 1.14 \, \text{m}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated radius is approximately \( 1.14 \, \text{m} \), which is closest to option **E: 1 m**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E**
