Okay, so I've got this multiple choice question about financial reporting for local governments. Hmm, I remember that local governments have specific requirements for their financial statements. The question is asking which of the options is part of the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting.

Let me think about what I learned. I think the main financial statements for a local government include things like the government-wide financial statements, fund financial statements, and the notes to the financial statements. But wait, supplementary information is different from the main statements, right? 

Supplementary information is additional data that supports the main financial statements but isn't part of them. I remember something about the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) being part of the supplementary info. Oh, and the combining statements for nonmajor funds might be supplementary too because they provide more detailed info about individual funds that aren't major, but they're not required to be presented in the main statements.

Wait, looking at the options: 

A: Statement of cash flows. I think this is part of the fund financial statements, so it's a main statement, not supplementary.

B: Internal control over financial reporting. Isn't that part of the audit process, maybe included in the audit report, but not the supplementary info.

C: Financial statement audit report. That's an auditor's report, which is separate and not part of the supplementary info.

D: Government-wide financial statement. That's one of the main statements, so not supplementary.

E: Comprehensive annual financial report. Wait, isn't that the whole report which includes the financial statements, MD&A, etc.? So the CAFR is the overarching document, but the question is about supplementary info within it.

F: Combining nonmajor fund statement. I think this is considered supplementary because it provides details that aren't in the main fund statements.

G: Fund financial statement. Main statement again.

H: Management discussion and analysis. I'm pretty sure this is supplementary.

I: Notes to the financial statements. These are part of the main financials, not supplementary.

So the question is which of these is required supplementary. I remember that MD&A is required as supplementary. Also, combining statements for nonmajor funds are required as supplementary. Wait, but the question is which is considered part of the required supplementary information. So looking at the options, both H and F might be correct, but the question is multiple choice with one answer.

Wait, the options are A through I, and the question is which is part of the required supplementary info. So let me think about the structure. The main financial statements are government-wide, fund, and notes. The supplementary info includes MD&A, combining statements, etc.

So the options given are F: Combining nonmajor fund statement. H: Management discussion and analysis. So both F and H are supplementary.

But the question is which of the following is considered part, so possible two correct options, but the choices don't allow that. Let me check the exact requirements.

Wait, I think the MD&A is part of the required supplementary information. Also, combining statements are required supplementary if the government has nonmajor funds. So if the question includes both, but the options are separate, which one is correct?

Wait, the question is phrased as "which of the following is considered part of the required supplementary information". So if both F and H are correct, but the options don't allow multiple choices, perhaps the correct answer is both. But the options are separate, so maybe I'm recalling incorrectly.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H: Management discussion and analysis. Because MD&A is a required supplementary. The combining statements are also required supplementary, but perhaps that's another option.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

F: Combining nonmajor fund statement.

H: Management discussion and analysis.

So both are supplementary. But the question is which one is part of the required supplementary. So perhaps both F and H are correct, but since the options are single choices, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the MD&A is required, but the combining statements are considered supplementary but perhaps not always required? Or maybe they are required only when certain conditions are met.

Alternatively, perhaps only the MD&A is considered required supplementary information, and the combining statements are part of the supplementary but not required? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think that the MD&A is required as supplementary. Also, the combining statements for nonmajor funds are required as supplementary. So both F and H are part of the required supplementary info.

But the options given are A to I, and the question is asking which one is considered part of the required supplementary. So perhaps both F and H are correct, but the options only allow one correct answer. Wait, maybe the question is designed to have only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: what is included in the Required Supplementary Information (RSI)? From what I remember, RSI includes:

- Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)
- Budgetary comparison schedules for the general fund and any other special revenue funds that have a legally adopted budget
- Information on infrastructure assets (if using the modified approach)
- Combining statements for nonmajor funds, if they are not presented as part of the fund financial statements.

Wait, but are combining statements required as supplementary? Or are they part of the fund statements?

Hmm, perhaps the combining statements are part of the supplementary info when they're not included in the main fund statements. So if the fund financial statements include major funds, the nonmajor funds are presented in combining statements as supplementary.

So in that case, F (Combining nonmajor fund statement) would be part of the required supplementary info.

But then, H (MD&A) is also required as supplementary. So if the question is which of the following is part of the required supplementary, then both F and H would be correct. But the options don't allow that.

Wait, looking back at the options, the options are from A to I, but the question is which one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is both F and H. But in the options given, perhaps both F and H are correct, but the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: Management discussion and analysis. Because MD&A is always required as RSI, regardless of other factors. The combining statements are required if the government has nonmajor funds, but perhaps not all governments do. So if the question is about what is considered part of the required supplementary info, the MD&A is always required.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F and H, but since we can only choose one, perhaps the correct choice is H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what's required. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) specifies that the MD&A is required supplementary information. Similarly, combining statements for nonmajor funds are also required as supplementary if they are not presented in the fund financial statements.

So both F and H are correct. But the options are separate, so perhaps the question expects one answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering.

Alternatively, perhaps the notes to the financial statements are part of the main financials, not supplementary. So I is not correct.

Wait, the question is about which is considered part of the required supplementary info. So the correct answer should be MD&A and combining nonmajor fund statements. But the options are single choices.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: Management discussion and analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps F is correct. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A: Statement of cash flows. - Part of fund financials, main statement.

B: Internal control... - Part of audit, not supplementary.

C: Financial statement audit report. - Separate, not supplementary info.

D: Government-wide financial statement. - Main.

E: Comprehensive annual financial report. - The whole report, not part of supplementary.

F: Combining nonmajor fund statement. - Supplementary.

G: Fund financial statement. - Main.

H: Management discussion and analysis. - Supplementary.

I: Notes to the financial statements. - Main.

So the question is which is part of required supplementary. So both F and H are correct. But the options are single choice. So perhaps the answer is both F and H, but since that's not possible, maybe only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the MD&A is part of the required supplementary, and the combining statements are supplementary but not required. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, according to GASB standards, MD&A is required supplementary. Combining statements are also required if the government hasn't presented them in the main fund statements.

So both F and H are required supplementary. But the options don't allow selecting both. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is both F and H, but since the options are single letters, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H. Because MD&A is definitely required as supplementary. The combining statements are also required, but perhaps they are considered part of the fund financials if presented, but if not, they are supplementary. So perhaps both F and H are correct, but the question expects only one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the combining statements are required supplementary, while MD&A is also required. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H and F. But since I can only choose one, perhaps I'm missing the exact GASB requirement.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that MD&A is part of the required supplementary, making H correct. The combining statements are also required, but perhaps only if the government has nonmajor funds.

Wait, but the question is about which is considered part of the required supplementary info, not which is sometimes included.

Hmm, I think I need to make a choice. I'll go with H: Management discussion and analysis, as it's definitely part of the required supplementary info.

The question asks which of the given options is considered part of the required supplementary information for general purpose external financial reporting of a local government. To determine the correct answer, it is important to distinguish between the main financial statements and the supplementary information. 

- **Option A (Statement of cash flows):** This is part of the fund financial statements, which are considered main financial statements, not supplementary information.  
- **Option B (Internal control over financial reporting):** This is related to the audit process and is not part of the supplementary information.  
- **Option C (Financial statement audit report):** This is an auditor's report and is separate from the supplementary information.  
- **Option D (Government-wide financial statement):** This is one of the main financial statements, not supplementary.  
- **Option E (Comprehensive annual financial report):** This refers to the entire report, which includes the financial statements, supplementary information, and other components. It is not itself part of the supplementary information.  
- **Option F (Combining nonmajor fund statement):** This is considered supplementary information because it provides details about nonmajor funds that are not included in the main fund financial statements.  
- **Option G (Fund financial statement):** This is a main financial statement, not supplementary.  
- **Option H (Management discussion and analysis):** This is explicitly required as part of the supplementary information.  
- **Option I (Notes to the financial statements):** These are part of the main financial statements, not supplementary.  

Both **Option F (Combining nonmajor fund statement)** and **Option H (Management discussion and analysis)** are part of the required supplementary information. However, since the question only allows for one correct answer, **Option H (Management discussion and analysis)** is the most definitive and universally required component of supplementary information.

Answer: H
