Okay, so I've got this problem here about Lebesgue measure, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The set E is defined as E = {(x, y) ∈ I : sin(x) < 1/2, cos(x+y) is irrational}, where I is the unit square [0,1]×[0,1]. I need to find the Lebesgue measure of E, and there are multiple-choice options given.

First, I remember that the Lebesgue measure in two dimensions basically corresponds to the area of the set. So I'm looking for the area of all points (x,y) in the unit square that satisfy two conditions: sin(x) < 1/2 and cos(x+y) is irrational.

Let me break this down into two parts. The first condition is sin(x) < 1/2. The second is that cos(x+y) is irrational.

Starting with the first condition: sin(x) < 1/2. I think about where the sine function is less than 1/2. The sine function equals 1/2 at x = π/6 (30 degrees) and x = 5π/6 (150 degrees) in the interval [0, 2π]. But since x is in [0,1], I need to see how much of this interval satisfies sin(x) < 1/2.

Wait, actually, π is approximately 3.1416, so π/6 is about 0.5236 and 5π/6 is about 2.618. But since our x is only up to 1, which is less than π/2 (approx 1.5708), so in the range [0,1], sin(x) increases from 0 to sin(1) ≈ 0.8415.

So when does sin(x) = 1/2? At x = π/6 ≈ 0.5236. So for x < π/6, sin(x) < 1/2, and for x > π/6 up to 1, sin(x) is greater than 1/2. So the set where sin(x) < 1/2 is the interval [0, π/6) in x. So the length of this interval is π/6 ≈ 0.5236.

Now, considering the unit square, the area where sin(x) < 1/2 is a rectangle from x=0 to x=π/6, and y from 0 to 1. So the area contributed by this condition alone would be (π/6)*1 = π/6 ≈ 0.5236.

But wait, that's just the first condition. The second condition is that cos(x+y) is irrational. Hmm. So I need to consider the set of (x,y) where cos(x+y) is irrational. Or, more precisely, the intersection of this set with the region where sin(x) < 1/2.

But wait, how does cos(x+y) being irrational affect the measure? I remember that the set of points where a continuous function takes rational values has measure zero. Because the rational numbers are countable, and for each rational q, the set where cos(x+y)=q is a 1-dimensional manifold (like a curve) in the 2D plane, which has Lebesgue measure zero. So the set where cos(x+y) is rational has measure zero. Therefore, the set where cos(x+y) is irrational should have full measure, i.e., measure equal to the area of the set where sin(x) < 1/2, which is π/6.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. The set where cos(x+y) is rational is a countable union of level sets of the function cos(x+y). Each level set where cos(x+y) = q for some rational q is a set of lines or curves in the square, each of which has measure zero. So the entire set where cos(x+y) is rational has measure zero. Therefore, the set where cos(x+y) is irrational should have measure equal to the entire space except for a set of measure zero. So within the region where sin(x) < 1/2, which has measure π/6, the subset where cos(x+y) is irrational would also have measure π/6, because removing a measure zero set doesn't change the measure.

Wait, but does that make sense? Let me think about it. So E is the intersection of two sets: A where sin(x) < 1/2, and B where cos(x+y) is irrational. Then, the measure of E is the measure of A intersected with B.

But if B has full measure in the entire unit square, except for a measure zero set, then in the region A, which has measure π/6, the set B would also have full measure, so E would have measure π/6.

Wait, but does B have full measure in the unit square? Let's confirm. The function cos(x+y) is continuous, and as I thought earlier, the preimage of the rationals under a continuous function is a countable union of closed sets (each being the preimage of a single rational), each of which has measure zero. So the set where cos(x+y) is irrational is the complement of a measure zero set, so it has full measure in the unit square.

Therefore, when we take the intersection of A (where sin(x) < 1/2) and B (cos(x+y) is irrational), the measure of E is just the measure of A, because B contributes no further reduction in measure beyond what A already imposes.

So the measure of E should be the length of the x-interval where sin(x) < 1/2, multiplied by the full y-interval, which is 1, so (π/6)*1 = π/6 ≈ 0.5235987756.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.5235987667, which is approximately π/6. So the correct answer should be H.

The problem involves finding the Lebesgue measure of the set \( E = \{(x, y) \in I : \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2}, \cos(x+y) \text{ is irrational}\} \), where \( I = [0,1] \times [0,1] \). The Lebesgue measure in two dimensions corresponds to the area of the set.

### Step 1: Analyze the condition \( \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2} \)
The sine function equals \( \frac{1}{2} \) at \( x = \frac{\pi}{6} \) and \( x = \frac{5\pi}{6} \) within the interval \([0, 2\pi]\). However, since \( x \in [0,1] \), we only consider \( x = \frac{\pi}{6} \approx 0.5236 \). For \( x < \frac{\pi}{6} \), \( \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2} \), and for \( x > \frac{\pi}{6} \), \( \sin(x) > \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the set where \( \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2} \) is the interval \([0, \frac{\pi}{6})\) in \( x \), with length \( \frac{\pi}{6} \).

Within the unit square, this corresponds to a rectangle with \( x \in [0, \frac{\pi}{6}) \) and \( y \in [0,1] \). The area of this region is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \times 1 = \frac{\pi}{6} \approx 0.5236 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the condition \( \cos(x+y) \text{ is irrational} \)
The function \( \cos(x+y) \) is continuous. The set of rational numbers is countable, and for each rational \( q \), the preimage \( \cos(x+y) = q \) is a 1-dimensional manifold (e.g., lines or curves) in the 2D plane, which has Lebesgue measure zero. Therefore, the set where \( \cos(x+y) \) is rational has measure zero, and the set where \( \cos(x+y) \) is irrational has full measure in the unit square.

### Step 3: Intersection of the two conditions
The set \( E \) is the intersection of the region where \( \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2} \) (with measure \( \frac{\pi}{6} \)) and the region where \( \cos(x+y) \) is irrational (which has full measure). Since the second condition does not reduce the measure further, the measure of \( E \) is equal to the measure of the region where \( \sin(x) < \frac{1}{2} \), which is \( \frac{\pi}{6} \approx 0.5236 \).

### Final Answer
From the given options, the value closest to \( \frac{\pi}{6} \) is \( 0.5235987667 \), which corresponds to option **H**.
