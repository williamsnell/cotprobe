Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about critical legal theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break this down step by step.

The question is asking which proposition would be rejected by critical legal theorists. The options are A through E, each making a statement about the law. 

First, I should recall what critical legal theory (CLT) is all about. From what I remember, CLT is a school of thought that critiques the notion of law as objective and neutral. They argue that law is not separate from politics or economics but is instead deeply influenced by these factors. CLT often emphasizes that legal decisions are shaped by the interests of the powerful, such as economic elites, and that the law can be indeterminate, meaning that outcomes aren't always predictable because of conflicting principles.

So, CLT's key points probably include that law is not determinate, it's shaped by economic power, it's a form of politics, and it's a social construct. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Law is unstable. Hmm, CLT might agree because they see law as indeterminate and subject to multiple interpretations, which could make it unstable. So they wouldn't reject this.

Option B: Law is determinate. Wait, determinate means that the law has clear, fixed meanings leading to predictable outcomes. CLT argues against this, saying the law is indeterminate because there are often conflicting principles. So CLT would reject the idea that law is determinate. That makes B a possible answer.

Option C: Law reflects economic power. CLT definitely supports this. They argue that law serves the interests of the economically powerful, so they wouldn't reject this. So C is not the answer.

Option D: Law is politics. CLT would agree because they see law as a continuation of politics, shaped by political forces and ideologies. So D is not something they would reject.

Option E: Law is a social construct. CLT also believes this, as they argue that law is constructed through social and political processes rather than being objective or natural. So E isn't the answer.

So the only proposition that CLT would reject is B: Law is determinate. Because CLT says the law isn't determinate, it's indeterminate, subject to multiple interpretations influenced by power dynamics.

The correct answer is B. Critical legal theorists reject the idea that law is determinate, as they argue that legal principles are often conflicting and subject to multiple interpretations influenced by power dynamics. 

Answer: B
