Okay, so I've got this question here about what makes a relationship last according to Sternberg. Hmm, I remember that Sternberg had a theory about love, right? Let me think. Wasn't he the one who talked about the different components of love?

Oh right, Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love. He broke it down into three main components: intimacy, passion, and commitment. So, intimacy is like the closeness and connection you feel with someone. Passion is the romantic and physical attraction part. And commitment is about deciding to maintain that love and stay together through the ups and downs.

The question is asking what makes a relationship last. So, I guess the key here is commitment. Because commitment is about the decision to stay in the relationship long-term. It's not just the initial attraction or the emotional bond, but the actual choice to keep going, even when things get tough.

Looking at the options, I see option D is commitment. So that must be the right answer. The other options like understanding, empathy, respect, communication, patience, decision, trustâ€”all of these are important for relationships, but according to Sternberg's theory, the specific factor he points out for lasting relationships is commitment.

Wait, but could it be decision instead? Because commitment does involve a decision. Let me check the options again. Option G is decision, and D is commitment. Sternberg's theory specifically mentions commitment as a component, so I think D is correct. Decision is part of commitment, but the term he uses is commitment.

The correct answer is D: commitment, as per Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love, which identifies commitment as a key component for a lasting relationship.
