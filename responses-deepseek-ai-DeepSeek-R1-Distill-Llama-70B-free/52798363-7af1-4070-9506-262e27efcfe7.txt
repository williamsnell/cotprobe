Okay, so I have this tax question here about AMT tax preference items for someone named West. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my AMT stuff, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, West is single, no dependents, and doesn't itemize. So he's probably taking the standard deduction. But the question is about his AMT tax preference items, right?

The question gives me three pieces of information:

1. Long-term capital gain of $15,000.
2. Percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis of $9,000.
3. Dividends from publicly-held companies of $10,000.

Wait, I remember that AMT preferences are items that are treated differently for AMT than for regular tax. These preferences can increase the AMT income, which might cause someone to owe AMT instead of regular tax.

Let me break down each item:

First, long-term capital gains. Normally, for regular tax, long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate, but for AMT, I think they are treated the same as regular income. Or wait, no, I think capital gains are not an AMT preference. Because AMT adjustments and preferences include things like certain deductions and exclusions. Capital gains, though, their treatment might not add to the AMT income as a preference. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think that long-term capital gains are included in the AMT calculation as an adjustment, but maybe not as a preference. Or perhaps they are treated as a preference. Wait, no, I think that under AMT, capital gains are still taxed at the same favorable rates, but they are included in the calculation of AMT income. So if West has $15k in long-term capital gains, I think that's included in his AMT income, but it's not an AMT preference item. Or is it?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The question is about tax preference items, not adjustments. So which of these are considered preferences.

I remember that certain items are classified as preferences for AMT. One of them is the percentage depletion in excess of the basis. Oh right, that's a tax preference item. So the $9,000 would be a preference.

What about the dividends? Dividends are usually not taxed under AMT, or wait, no. Wait, for regular tax, dividends are qualified and get a lower rate, but for AMT, are they treated as preferences? Or are they included in income without any preference?

Wait, I think that under AMT, certain dividends are taxable. Or maybe it's that dividends from certain corporations are considered a preference. I'm a bit unclear here. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that for AMT purposes, the dividend exclusion applies the same way as for regular tax. So if West has $10k in dividends, under regular tax, qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate. But for AMT, I think the treatment is the same, meaning that the dividends are included in income but without any preference. So they wouldn't be an AMT preference item.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: I seem to recall that for AMT, certain preferences include things like accelerated depreciation, percentage depletion beyond adjusted basis, and maybe some others. Also, I think that the long-term capital gains are not a preference but are included in the AMT base, but perhaps the difference between regular tax and AMT treatment is what matters.

Wait, let me get this straight. AMT preferences are specific items that are added back to regular taxable income when calculating AMT income. So for each item, I need to determine if it's a preference.

So, for each of the three items:

1. Long-term capital gain: I don't think this is a preference. Because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate in regular tax, but for AMT, they are included in income but not as a preference. Or wait, maybe they are treated as a preference if the rate difference causes a lower tax. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, I think that capital gains and dividends are not considered AMT preferences. Instead, the way they're taxed under regular tax (with lower rates) doesn't apply for AMT. But the actual income from them is included in AMT income. So perhaps they are not preferences.

Wait, but let me think about the AMT preferences. From what I remember, the main AMT preferences include:

- Medical expenses (but only in certain cases, but I think they're an adjustment)
- Mortgage interest on home equity loans (maybe an adjustment)
- Percentage depletion in excess of basis (definitely a preference)
- Accelerated depreciation (preference)
- Income from certain types of property (like oil and gas)
- The difference between fair market value and inside basis for certain stock options (maybe)
- Tax-exempt interest on private activity bonds (a preference)

Wait, so the percentage depletion is definitely a preference. What about the capital gains and dividends?

I think that for AMT, capital gains and dividends are still included in income but are not considered preferences. So they are part of the AMT base but do not add as preferences.

Wait, but in the regular tax, capital gains and dividends get preferential rates, but for AMT, they are taxed at the regular AMT rates. So does that mean that the amount by which they were taxed lower under regular tax becomes an AMT preference?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the AMT does not recognize the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends, so the difference is a preference. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose someone has $100 of long-term capital gain. Under regular tax, they might pay 15% on that, so $15. But under AMT, the gain is taxed at the higher AMT rates. So the difference ($85) would be a preference? Or is the entire $100 included as a preference?

No, I think that the capital gains are not a preference. Instead, the AMT just includes the gain in income but applies the AMT rates. So the gain itself isn't a preference, but could affect the AMT calculation by increasing the income.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that AMT preferences are specific items that must be added back to the regular taxable income when calculating AMT income. So let's go through each item again.

Long-term capital gains: Under regular tax, these are taxed at a lower rate. For AMT, they are included in taxable income, but the lower rate doesn't apply. So does that mean that the gain is a preference? Or is it just that the gain is part of the AMT income but without the preference.

Wait, I think that capital gains are not a preference, but they are included in the AMT income. So they don't count as a preference item; they're just part of the income.

Percentage depletion in excess of adjusted basis: This is definitely a preference. Because under regular tax, you can take percentage depletion even beyond the basis, but for AMT, you can't. So the excess over basis (the $9,000) is added back as a preference.

Dividends from publicly-held companies: Under regular tax, qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates. For AMT, I think they're treated the same way. So they are included in income but not as a preference. So the $10,000 in dividends isn't a preference.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong here. Let me recall: dividends are included in income for both regular and AMT, but under regular tax, they have a lower rate. For AMT, they are taxed at the higher AMT rates, so the difference might be a preference. But I don't think so. I think that the dividends themselves are not a preference. Instead, the rate difference affects the tax liability, but the dividends are just part of the income.

So putting this together: the only AMT preference item is the $9,000 from percentage depletion.

Wait, but earlier I thought the capital gains are not a preference. So the total AMT preferences would be $9,000, which is option D.

But wait, let me double-check. The question is asking for the amount of West's AMT tax preference items. So we're adding up all the preferences.

Wait, another thought: I think that long-term capital gains are not a preference, but an adjustment. Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps the capital gains are included in AMT income as a preference because they're taxed more favorably under regular tax.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find a different approach. The AMT preferences are specific items that are added to the taxable income for AMT purposes. These include:

- Percentage depletion over basis: yes, $9,000.
- Tax-exempt interest from private activity bonds: not applicable here.
- Accelerated depreciation: not given.
- Gain on small business stock: not given.
- Income from oil and gas properties: not given.
- Difference in gain on sale of depreciable assets: not given.

So the only applicable one is the $9,000.

Wait, but what about the long-term capital gains? I think they are not a preference. Because under AMT, the gains are still included in income but taxed at the same rate as regular income, without the lower rate. But the gain itself isn't a preference; it's just that the tax rate is higher. So the gain doesn't add to the preferences, but increases the AMT income.

Similarly, the dividends: in regular tax, they have a lower rate, but for AMT, they are taxed at the regular AMT rates. So the difference in tax treatment might mean that the dividends are a preference. Or does it?

Wait, no. I think the key is that AMT preferences are specific items that are not allowed or are added back. For example, percentage depletion beyond basis is a preference because it's allowed for regular tax but not for AMT. But dividends are allowed in both, just taxed at a higher rate in AMT. So they are not a preference; they are just included in the AMT income.

So, only the $9,000 is a preference. So the answer should be D: $9,000.

Wait, but wait another thing. I remember that certain capital gains might be a preference. For example, if you have gains that are taxed at a lower rate under regular tax, the difference could be a preference. But I think that's only when the AMT treats the gains more favorably. Hmm, no, that's not right.

Wait, no. For AMT, capital gains are taxed at the same rates as regular tax. Wait, no, that's not correct. I think that for AMT, the tax rates are higher, but the brackets are different. Wait, no, actually, the AMT has two brackets: 26% and 28%, I believe. So if you have capital gains that would be taxed at 15% or 20% under regular tax, under AMT, they might be taxed at 26% or 28%. So the difference in tax would be an addition to the AMT income.

But wait, the question is about the amount of the preference items, not the tax effect. So I think the capital gains themselves are not a preference, but their inclusion in AMT income is just part of the income.

So, the only preference is the $9,000. So the answer is D: $9,000.

West is single, has no dependents, and does not itemize deductions. The question asks for the amount of West's AMT tax preference items based on the following information:

1. **Long-term capital gain of $15,000**: Long-term capital gains are included in AMT income but are not considered AMT tax preference items. The favorable tax rates for capital gains under regular tax do not apply for AMT, but the gains themselves are not classified as preferences.

2. **Percentage depletion in excess of property's adjusted basis of $9,000**: This is a classic AMT tax preference item. Percentage depletion allows a taxpayer to deduct more than the property's adjusted basis under regular tax, but for AMT purposes, the excess must be added back to taxable income.

3. **Dividends from publicly-held companies of $10,000**: Dividends are included in AMT income, but they are not considered AMT tax preference items. While qualified dividends receive favorable tax treatment under regular tax, they are taxed at the same rates as other income for AMT purposes, and no specific preference adjustment is required.

Based on this analysis, the only AMT tax preference item is the $9,000 from percentage depletion in excess of the property's adjusted basis.

**Answer: D**
