Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about union methods to increase wages, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT a method unions use to increase wages. The options are A through J. I remember that unions use various strategies to negotiate better pay and benefits for their members. Let's break down each option to see which one doesn't fit.

Option A: Seeking to increase the demand for the union's labor. Hmm, if demand for labor increases, employers might have to pay more to attract workers. So unions might try to make their workers more desirable, maybe through training or marketing their skills. That sounds like a valid method.

Option B: Negotiations to obtain a wage floor. Wage floors are minimum wages set by the union, ensuring that no member earns below that. Negotiating for a wage floor is definitely a common union tactic. So B is a method they use.

Option C: Encouraging workers to increase their productivity. If workers are more productive, the employer might see the value in paying higher wages because their output is higher. Or the union can argue for raises based on increased productivity. That makes sense, so C is a method they use.

Option D: Lobbying for higher minimum wage laws. Unions often support legislation that raises the minimum wage because it benefits their members and can set a higher baseline for all workers. So D is a standard approach.

Option E: Promoting worker training and education. Better-trained workers are more valuable, which can justify higher wages. Unions often invest in training programs to upskill their members. So E is a method they use.

Option F: Restrictive membership policies. Restricting membership can reduce the supply of labor, which, according to basic economics, can increase wages when demand is constant. If fewer workers are available, employers might have to pay more to get the workers they need. So F seems like a method to increase wages.

Option G: Efforts to decrease the prices of substitute resources. Substitute resources are other inputs that could replace the union's labor. If a union can make substitutes cheaper, maybe they can reduce the threat of being replaced. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. If substitute resources are more expensive, then employers are less likely to switch, which might give the union more bargaining power. Alternatively, if substitutes are cheaper, employers might prefer them over higher-wage workers. So maybe the union would try to make substitutes more expensive, not cheaper. Hmm, not sure about G yet. I'll come back to it.

Option H: Featherbedding or make-work rules. Featherbedding refers to practices where workers are paid for unnecessary work or when there's no actual work needed. It's a way to ensure more jobs or hours, thus increasing wages or maintaining employment levels. So H is a method used by unions.

Option I: Encouraging government regulation of industries. Government regulations can sometimes favor workers, such as safety standards or limiting work hours, which might indirectly lead to higher wages or better conditions. So I think I is a method they use.

Option J: Instituting strike actions. Strikes are a classic union method to pressure employers for higher wages. By stopping work, they can negotiate better terms. So J is definitely a method used.

Now, going back to option G. If the union decreases the prices of substitute resources, that would make those substitutes more attractive to employers, right? Because cheaper substitutes mean employers can replace union workers with those alternatives more easily, which would hurt the union's negotiating power. So unions would probably not want to make substitutes cheaper. Instead, they'd try to make substitutes more expensive or less available. So G doesn't make sense as a method to increase wages. Therefore, G is the answer.

The question asks which method is NOT used by unions to increase wages. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **A:** Unions may increase demand for their labor by making workers more desirable, so this is a valid method.
- **B:** Negotiating a wage floor is a common union tactic to ensure minimum wages.
- **C:** Encouraging productivity growth can justify higher wages, making this a valid method.
- **D:** Lobbying for higher minimum wage laws benefits union members and is a standard approach.
- **E:** Promoting training and education increases worker value, justifying higher wages.
- **F:** Restrictive membership policies can reduce labor supply, increasing wages.
- **G:** Decreasing substitute resource prices makes substitutes more attractive, harming union bargaining power. This is not a method unions would use.
- **H:** Featherbedding or make-work rules are used to maintain employment and wages.
- **I:** Encouraging government regulation can favor workers and improve wages indirectly.
- **J:** Strikes are a classic method to pressure employers for higher wages.

The method that does NOT align with union strategies to increase wages is **G**, as decreasing substitute resource prices would weaken the union's position.

Answer: G
