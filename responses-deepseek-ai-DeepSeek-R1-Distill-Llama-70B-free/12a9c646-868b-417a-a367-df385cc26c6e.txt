Okay, so I've got this question about the Internal-External Control Scale. I'm not too familiar with it, but I remember it's something to do with personality and how people perceive control over their lives. Let me think.

The question is asking about someone who scores high on internality. I think high internality means that the person believes their outcomes are due to their own actions, like their own efforts or abilities. So they feel in control of their success or failures. On the other hand, external control would be believing that outcomes are due to luck or other external factors.

Looking at the options:

Option A says high internality believes success is due to external factors like fate. That doesn't sound right because internality is about internal control, so A is probably wrong.

Option B says they are dependent and influenced easily. That doesn't make sense because if they're internal, they're more likely to be independent, not dependent. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C says they are achievement-oriented, independent, resistant to influence, successful, and prefer tasks based on skills. That aligns with what I remember. Internal people take responsibility, work hard, and like tasks where their skills matter, not luck.

Option D says they're passive and wait for others. That's more external, so D is wrong.

Option E says they're unsuccessful and lack ambition. No, internal people are usually more driven, so E is incorrect.

Option F says they feel they have little influence over outcomes. That's external, so F is wrong.

Option G prefers tasks relying on luck. No, internal prefers skills, so G is incorrect.

Option H says they blame others for their mistakes. That's more external, so H is wrong.

Option I says they experience more anxiety due to uncontrollable events. Wait, actually, internal people might feel more stress because they think they can control things, but if they face things they can't control, they might get more stressed. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's a primary characteristic associated with high internality. The question is about characterizing them, so maybe I is not the main point.

So the best option seems to be C. It covers being achievement-oriented, independent, etc., which fits the internal locus of control.

The correct answer is C because a person with high internality believes their outcomes result from their own actions and efforts, making them achievement-oriented, independent, and preferring tasks based on skills rather than chance.

Answer: C
