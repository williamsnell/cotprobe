Question:

Under some circumstances, a star can collapse into an extremely dense object made mostly of neutrons and called a neutron star. The density of a neutron star is roughly $10^14$ times as great as that of ordinary solid matter. Suppose we represent the star as a uniform, solid, rigid sphere, both before and after the collapse. The star's initial radius was $7 \tims 10^5$ km (comparable to our sun); its final radius is 16 km. If the original star rotated once in 30 days, find the angular speed (in rad/s) of the neutron star.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a neutron star's angular speed after collapsing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the problem says a star collapses into a neutron star. The initial radius is 7e5 km, and the final is 16 km. The original rotation period was once every 30 days. I need to find the angular speed after the collapse.

Wait, I remember something about conservation of angular momentum here. Because when the star collapses, if there's no external torque, the angular momentum should stay the same. So L_initial equals L_final.

Angular momentum L is given by I times omega, where I is the moment of inertia and omega is the angular speed. Since the star is modeled as a uniform solid sphere, the moment of inertia for a solid sphere is (2/5)MR².

So the initial L is I_initial * omega_initial = (2/5) M R_initial² * omega_initial.

The final L is I_final * omega_final = (2/5) M R_final² * omega_final.

Since L_initial = L_final, set them equal: (2/5) M R_i^2 omega_i = (2/5) M R_f^2 omega_f.

Oh wait, the (2/5) and M cancel out on both sides. So R_i² omega_i = R_f² omega_f.

So omega_f = omega_i * (R_i / R_f)^2.

Wait, that makes sense because if the radius decreases, the angular speed increases, which is what happens when a figure skater pulls in their arms.

But wait, I need to find omega_f, so I'll need omega_i first.

The initial rotation period is 30 days. Let me convert that to seconds. One day is 24 hours, each hour 3600 seconds. So 30 days is 30 * 24 * 3600 seconds.

Let me calculate that: 30 * 24 = 720 hours. 720 * 3600 = let's see, 720 * 3.6e3 = 2,592,000 seconds. So T_initial = 2.592e6 s.

Angular speed omega is 2pi divided by the period. So omega_i = 2pi / T_initial = 2pi / (2.592e6) ≈ 2.424e-6 rad/s.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let's compute 2 pi over 2,592,000.

2.592e6 is 2,592,000. So 2pi / 2.592e6 = approximately 2.424e-6 rad/s.

Now, plug into omega_f:

omega_f = omega_i * (R_i / R_f)^2.

But wait, R_i is 7e5 km, and R_f is 16 km. So R_i/R_f = (7e5) /16.

Wait, 7e5 is 700,000. So 700,000 /16 ≈ 43750.

Then (R_i/R_f)^2 is (43750)^2. Let me compute that.

43750 squared: 4.375e4 squared is (4.375)^2 * 1e8. 4.375 squared is approx 19.140625. So 1.9140625e9.

Wait, no, 43750 is 4.375e4, so squared is (4.375e4)^2 = (4.375)^2 * 1e8.

4.375 squared is (4 + 0.375)^2. Let's compute that: 4^2 is 16, 2*(4)(0.375) is 3, and 0.375^2 is 0.140625. So 16 +3 +0.140625 = 19.140625. So 19.140625e8, which is 1.9140625e9.

So (R_i/R_f)^2 is about 1.9140625e9.

Then omega_f = (2.424e-6 rad/s) * 1.9140625e9.

Let me multiply them: 2.424e-6 * 1.914e9.

2.424 * 1.914 is about... let's compute 2*1.914=3.828, 0.424*1.914≈0.811. So total about 4.639.

So 4.639e3 rad/s. Wait, but 1e-6 * 1e9 is 1e3, so 2.424 * 1.914 = approx 4.638. So 4.638e3 rad/s. So about 4638 rad/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 4600, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximations were a bit rough.

Let me do more precise calculations.

First, compute R_i =7e5 km =7e8 meters (since 1 km=1e3 m). R_f=16 km=16e3 m.

So R_i/R_f = (7e8)/(16e3) = (7e5)/(16) ) = 700000 / 16.

700000 divided by 16: 16*43750=700000. So exactly 43750.

So (R_i/R_f)^2 = (43750)^2 = 1914062500.

So that's 1.9140625e9.

Now, the initial angular speed omega_i is 2pi/(30 days).

Compute 30 days in seconds: 30 * 86400 = 30 * 8.64e4 = 2.592e6 seconds.

So omega_i = 2pi / 2.592e6 = (2 * 3.14159265) / 2.592e6.

2pi is approximately 6.283185307. So 6.283185307 / 2.592e6 = approximately 2.42416e-6 rad/s.

Now compute omega_f: omega_i * (R_i/R_f)^2.

So 2.42416e-6 * 1.9140625e9 = ?

Let me calculate 2.42416e-6 * 1.9140625e9.

Multiply 2.42416 * 1.9140625:

2.42416 * 1.9140625 ≈ let's compute 2 *1.9140625=3.828125.

0.4 *1.9140625= 0.765625.

0.02416 *1.9140625 ≈ approx 0.0462.

Adding up: 3.828125 + 0.765625 = 4.59375 + 0.0462 = approx 4.63995.

So 4.63995e3 rad/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 4600. So 4639.95 is about 4640, which rounds to 4600 as the closest option.

Wait, but let me check if I missed any steps. Oh wait, perhaps the moment of inertia for a neutron star is different? No, the problem states to model it as a uniform solid sphere both before and after. So I_initial and I_final are both (2/5) MR^2, so when taking the ratio, they cancel out. So everything is correct.

Another thing: Did I mix up radius and diameter? No, the problem gives radii. So that's correct.

So the answer should be approximately 4640, which is closest to option C, 4600.0.

To determine the angular speed of the neutron star after collapse, we use the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The angular momentum before and after the collapse is given by:

\[
L = I \cdot \omega
\]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular speed. For a uniform solid sphere, the moment of inertia is:

\[
I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2
\]

Since the star's mass \( M \) remains constant and the factor \( \frac{2}{5} \) cancels out, the conservation of angular momentum simplifies to:

\[
R_i^2 \cdot \omega_i = R_f^2 \cdot \omega_f
\]

Rearranging for \( \omega_f \):

\[
\omega_f = \omega_i \cdot \left(\frac{R_i}{R_f}\right)^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \omega_i \)
The initial rotation period is 30 days. Converting this to seconds:

\[
T_i = 30 \cdot 24 \cdot 3600 = 2,592,000 \, \text{s}
\]

The angular speed \( \omega_i \) is:

\[
\omega_i = \frac{2\pi}{T_i} = \frac{2\pi}{2,592,000} \approx 2.424 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \frac{R_i}{R_f} \)
The initial radius is \( R_i = 7 \times 10^5 \, \text{km} = 7 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \), and the final radius is \( R_f = 16 \, \text{km} = 16,000 \, \text{m} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{R_i}{R_f} = \frac{7 \times 10^8}{16,000} = 43,750
\]

Squaring this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{R_i}{R_f}\right)^2 = (43,750)^2 = 1.914 \times 10^9
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \omega_f \)
Substitute into the equation for \( \omega_f \):

\[
\omega_f = \omega_i \cdot \left(\frac{R_i}{R_f}\right)^2 = (2.424 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (1.914 \times 10^9)
\]

\[
\omega_f \approx 4,639 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 4: Match to the closest option
The closest option to \( 4,639 \, \text{rad/s} \) is **4600.0**, which corresponds to option **C**.
