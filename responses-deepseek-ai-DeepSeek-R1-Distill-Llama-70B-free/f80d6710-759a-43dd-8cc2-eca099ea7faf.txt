Okay, I'm trying to solve this probability problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about finding the probability that the sample mean, X̄, of a random sample of size 12 from a uniform distribution on (0,1) is between 1/2 and 2/3. They want an approximate probability.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with sample means, especially from a uniform distribution, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) might come into play here. Since the sample size is 12, which isn't super large, but I think it's considered moderate, so CLT should give a decent approximation.

First, I need to recall some properties of the uniform distribution. The uniform distribution on (0,1) has a mean (μ) of 0.5 and a variance (σ²) of 1/12. I think that's right because for a uniform distribution on (a,b), the variance is (b-a)²/12. Here, a=0 and b=1, so variance is 1/12.

The sample mean X̄ is normally distributed as per CLT, especially for large n, but n=12 is probably acceptable. The mean of X̄ should be the same as the population mean, so μ_X̄ = μ = 0.5. The variance of X̄ would be σ²/n, which is (1/12)/12 = 1/(144). Therefore, the standard deviation (σ_X̄) is sqrt(1/144) = 1/12 ≈ 0.0833.

So, X̄ ~ N(0.5, (1/12)²), approximately.

Now, the problem asks for P(1/2 ≤ X̄ ≤ 2/3). Let's rewrite these in terms of Z-scores because that's easier to compute with the standard normal distribution.

The Z-score formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ. So for each bound, I'll compute the Z.

First, the lower bound: X = 0.5
Z1 = (0.5 - 0.5) / (1/12) = 0 / (1/12) = 0.

Second, the upper bound: X = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667
Z2 = (0.6667 - 0.5) / (1/12)
Let me calculate that. 0.6667 - 0.5 is approximately 0.1667. Dividing by 1/12 is the same as multiplying by 12. So 0.1667 * 12 = 2. So Z2 is 2.

So now, the probability is P(0 ≤ Z ≤ 2). I know that the standard normal distribution tables give the area from the left up to Z. So P(Z ≤ 2) is about 0.9772, and P(Z ≤ 0) is 0.5. So the area between 0 and 2 is 0.9772 - 0.5 = 0.4772.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.4772. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in calculations?

Z2 calculation: (2/3 - 0.5) = (0.666... - 0.5) = 0.1666..., which is 1/6. 1/6 divided by (1/12) is (1/6) * 12 = 2. So yes, Z=2 is correct. And the lower bound is exactly 0, so Z=0.

The standard normal table for Z=2 gives about 0.9772, and for Z=0, it's 0.5. Subtracting gives 0.4772, which is option G. That makes sense.

To approximate \( P\left(\frac{1}{2} \leq \bar{X} \leq \frac{2}{3}\right) \), we use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The sample mean \(\bar{X}\) of a random sample of size 12 from a uniform distribution on \((0,1)\) is approximately normally distributed with mean \(\mu_{\bar{X}} = 0.5\) and variance \(\sigma_{\bar{X}}^2 = \frac{1}{12 \cdot 12} = \frac{1}{144}\). Thus, \(\bar{X} \sim N\left(0.5, \frac{1}{144}\right)\).

To standardize \(\bar{X}\), we compute the Z-scores for the bounds:
- For the lower bound, \(X = \frac{1}{2}\):
  \[
  Z_1 = \frac{\frac{1}{2} - 0.5}{\frac{1}{12}} = 0.
  \]
- For the upper bound, \(X = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667\):
  \[
  Z_2 = \frac{\frac{2}{3} - 0.5}{\frac{1}{12}} = \frac{0.1667}{\frac{1}{12}} = 2.
  \]

The probability \( P\left(\frac{1}{2} \leq \bar{X} \leq \frac{2}{3}\right) \) corresponds to \( P(0 \leq Z \leq 2) \). Using the standard normal distribution table:
- \( P(Z \leq 2) \approx 0.9772 \),
- \( P(Z \leq 0) = 0.5 \).

Thus, \( P(0 \leq Z \leq 2) = 0.9772 - 0.5 = 0.4772 \).

From the given options, the closest match is **G: 0.4772**.
