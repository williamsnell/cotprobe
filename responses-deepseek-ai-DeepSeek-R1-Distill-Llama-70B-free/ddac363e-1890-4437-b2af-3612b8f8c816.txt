Question:

A homeowner was injured when an automatic cutoff switch failed to function on a snowblower he was using. The cutoff switch had functioned well for a year after he purchased the snowblower but failed after the machine had been improperly repaired by a mechanic. The snowblower's operating manual contained a clear and prominent warning against making the very alteration to the switch mechanism that was made by the mechanic. The mechanic, however, did not have a manual available when he repaired the snowblower. Does the homeowner have a viable claim against the manufacturer of the snowblower for damages?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel.
B: Yes, because the snowblower should have had a backup safety system in place.
C: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party. a third party.
D: No, because the mechanic is solely responsible for the improper repair.
E: No, because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in failing to furnish the snowblower's manual to the mechanic.
F: No, because the homeowner should have ensured the mechanic had access to the correct manual.
G: Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.
H: Yes, because the cutoff switch should not have failed regardless of the repair.
I: Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the switch mechanism more robust.
J: No, because the homeowner should have requested a professional repair from the manufacturer.

Okay, so I have this question about product liability, and I need to figure out whether the homeowner can sue the manufacturer for damages. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A homeowner was injured because the automatic cutoff switch on his snowblower failed. The switch had worked fine for a year after purchase but failed after a mechanic improperly repaired the machine. The operating manual clearly warned against the alteration the mechanic made, but the mechanic didn't have the manual when he did the repair.

So the question is whether the manufacturer is liable. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

I remember that product liability usually involves three main types of defects: manufacturing defects, design defects, and failure to warn. Here, the issue seems to be about failure to warn, but I need to think carefully.

The cutoff switch failed after a repair. The repair was done improperly by a mechanic who didn't have the manual. The manual did warn against making that specific alteration, so the manufacturer did provide a warning. But the mechanic didn't see it because he didn't have the manual.

Wait, so the manufacturer provided the manual with the product, right? The homeowner presumably received it. But the mechanic didn't have it when he did the repair. So the manufacturer's warning was in the manual, but the mechanic wasn't aware because he didn't have access to it.

Does the manufacturer have a duty to ensure that repair persons have the manual? Or is it the responsibility of the repair person to obtain the manual? Hmm.

I think that under product liability law, the manufacturer's duty is to provide adequate warnings with the product. If they do that, and a third party (like a repair person) doesn't follow those warnings because they didn't have the manual, then the manufacturer might not be liable. Because the failure was due to an alteration by a third party that the manufacturer warned against.

So in this case, the manufacturer warned against the alteration in the manual, which was provided to the homeowner. The mechanic, not having the manual, made the alteration anyway. So the injury resulted from a substantial change made by a third party, which the manufacturer had warned against.

That sounds like the "substantial alteration" defense. If a third party alters the product in a way that the manufacturer warned against, and that alteration causes the injury, then the manufacturer isn't liable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says: No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party. That fits with what I was thinking.

Option D says the mechanic is solely responsible. But the question is about the manufacturer's liability, so even if the mechanic is at fault, if the manufacturer is also liable, the answer would be yes. But in this case, the manufacturer provided the warning, so they might not be liable because the alteration was the cause.

Option A suggests the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel. But I don't think manufacturers are required to provide manuals to every possible repair person. It's the responsibility of the repair person to have the correct manual, perhaps.

Option E says the homeowner was contributorily negligent for not giving the manual to the mechanic. I'm not sure about that. Contributory negligence can be a factor, but in strict liability cases, it might not bar recovery entirely. Also, the question is about whether the manufacturer is liable, not about apportioning blame between the homeowner and the mechanic.

Option B suggests a backup safety system. Maybe, but the question doesn't mention whether such a system was feasible or if its absence was a design defect. So I'm not sure if that's the right angle here.

Option G says a defect in the snowblower caused the injury. But the switch had worked for a year, so it's more about the alteration causing the failure, not an inherent defect.

Option H says the switch shouldn't have failed regardless of repair. But if the repair was improper and contrary to warnings, the manufacturer isn't responsible for such misuse.

So putting it all together, the manufacturer provided a warning, the third party made an alteration despite that (though they didn't have the manual), which caused the failure. So the manufacturer isn't liable because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party. So the answer should be C.

The homeowner’s injury occurred due to the failure of an automatic cutoff switch on a snowblower after it was improperly repaired by a mechanic. The snowblower’s manual explicitly warned against the specific alteration made by the mechanic, but the mechanic did not have access to the manual during the repair. The key issue is whether the manufacturer can be held liable for the injury.

Under product liability law, manufacturers are required to provide adequate warnings with their products. In this case, the manufacturer fulfilled this duty by including a clear warning in the manual. The injury resulted from an improper alteration made by a third party (the mechanic) despite the manufacturer’s warning. This constitutes a "substantial alteration" defense, which protects the manufacturer from liability when a third party modifies the product in a way that the manufacturer explicitly warned against.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** correctly identifies that the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party, which the manufacturer had warned against. This aligns with the "substantial alteration" defense, making the manufacturer not liable.
- Other options, such as **A**, **D**, **E**, **B**, **G**, **H**, **I**, **F**, and **J**, either incorrectly assign liability to the manufacturer or misapply legal principles.

Thus, the manufacturer is not liable because the injury was caused by a substantial alteration made by a third party, contrary to the manufacturer’s warnings.

Answer: C
