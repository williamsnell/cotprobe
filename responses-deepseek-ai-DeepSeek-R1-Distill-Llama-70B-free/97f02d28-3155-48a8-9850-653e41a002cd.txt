Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the US who reported being in a physical fight at school in the past 12 months as of 2015. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts surveys related to youth behavior, including school violence. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBS) is one of them. The YRBS typically asks questions about various risk behaviors, including fighting.

I think the question is asking specifically about physical fights at school. So, I should focus on that. The age group is 13-15, which is roughly 8th to 10th grade. 

I'm trying to recall any statistics I've heard before. I think the percentage of students involved in fights at school has been declining over the past few decades. For example, in the early 2000s, it was higher, maybe around 30-40%, but I'm not sure about 2015 specifically.

Wait, I think in 2015, the YRBS found that about 20-25% of high school students reported being in a fight at school in the past year. But wait, the question is about 13-15, which would include some middle school students as well. Middle schoolers might have higher rates than high schoolers, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe it's lower. I've heard that school violence has decreased. So perhaps it's around 15-20%? Wait, but the options don't have 20% exactly. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A:65%, B:45%, C:50%, D:5%, E:55%, F:15%, G:35%, H:25%, I:75%, J:85%. So, 25% is option H, and 15% is F.

Wait, I think the exact number was around 22% or so. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the percentage of students who carried a weapon. Or maybe it's lower.

Another approach: I remember that in 2015, the YRBS reported that about 22.7% of students had been in a fight at school. But that's for all high school students, which are typically 14-18 years old. Since the question is about 13-15, which is a bit younger, maybe the percentage is a bit lower than that. So perhaps around 20%? But 22.7 is closer to 23%, which isn't an option.

Wait, the options don't have 23%. The closest is H:25%. Or maybe I'm mixing up the data. Alternatively, perhaps it's lower because the trend was decreasing.

Wait, another thought: the question specifies being in a physical fight one or more times. In 2015, the CDC reported that 22.7% of high school students (grades 9-12) had been in a fight on school property in the past 12 months. But the question is about 13-15, which would be younger. So maybe the percentage is a bit lower than 22.7%. But 22.7 is about 23%, which isn't an option. The closest higher is 25% (H), the closest lower is 20%, but 20 isn't an option either. Wait, looking back at the options, H is 25%, and F is 15%, which is lower.

Alternatively, maybe I'm remembering wrong. Perhaps in 2015, the percentage was around 25%. Or maybe it's lower. Another angle: perhaps the percentage for 13-15 is lower than the overall high school average. So if high school (14-18) is 22.7%, maybe 13-15 is lower, like 18-20%. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of another approach. Maybe looking for any other statistics I know. For example, I think that around 2015, about 1 in 5 students were in a fight at school. So 20% would be 1 in 5. But 20% isn't an option. Wait, option H is 25%, which is 1 in 4. So that's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is lower. Maybe 15%? That's option F. But I'm not sure. I think 15% seems low, considering that in 2015, the number was still in the 20s.

Wait, another point: the question is about "children aged 13-15". So that's 13, 14, 15 years old. In the US, that's typically 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. The YRBS includes 9th through 12th. So the 13-15 group would include 9th graders, but also younger ones. Maybe the fighting prevalence is higher among older teens, so younger ones might have lower rates.

If the overall high school (9-12) is 22.7%, perhaps the 9th graders (around 14-15) have a lower rate than the overall average. So maybe 20% or so. But again, the options don't have 20%.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. I think the correct answer is 25%, which is option H. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the number is lower, like 15% (F). Wait, I think 15% might be too low. I've heard that school violence rates have decreased, but 15% seems low for 2015. I think it's more likely around 20-25%.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 25%, which is option H.

The question asks for the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being in a physical fight at school one or more times during the past 12 months as of 2015. To determine the answer, the analysis considered data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBS), which tracks school-related violence. 

The YRBS for 2015 reported that approximately 22.7% of high school students (grades 9-12) had been in a fight on school property in the past year. Since the question focuses on 13-15-year-olds, who include younger students (7th and 8th grades) and 9th graders, it was reasoned that the prevalence might be slightly lower than the overall high school average. However, the exact percentage for this specific age group was unclear.

Given the options provided (A: 65%, B: 45%, C: 50%, D: 5%, E: 55%, F: 15%, G: 35%, H: 25%, I: 75%, J: 85%), the closest plausible answer based on the reasoning was 25% (option H), as it aligns with the general trend of school violence statistics around that time.

Answer: H
