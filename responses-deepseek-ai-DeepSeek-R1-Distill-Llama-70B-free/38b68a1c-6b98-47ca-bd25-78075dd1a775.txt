Okay, so I've got this group theory question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about homomorphisms, which I remember from my studies. A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures, like groups in this case.

The specific map given is x ↦ axa². So, for every element x in group G, the map takes x and gives back a multiplied by x multiplied by a squared. The question is asking under what condition this map is a homomorphism.

Hmm, I think to check if a map is a homomorphism, it needs to preserve the group operation. So, for any two elements x and y in G, the map of their product should equal the product of their maps. That is, f(xy) = f(x)f(y).

Let me write that out. So, f(xy) should equal f(x) * f(y). Let's compute each side.

f(xy) is a*(xy)*a². On the other hand, f(x) is a*x*a² and f(y) is a*y*a². So f(x)*f(y) would be (a x a²)(a y a²). Let me compute that product.

Multiplying those two, I get a x a² * a y a². Since group multiplication is associative, I can rearrange the parentheses: a x (a² a) y a². Wait, a² a is a³. So it becomes a x a³ y a².

Wait, maybe I should work it out more carefully. Let me think about the group operation as just multiplication. So, (a x a²) * (a y a²) = a x a² a y a². Now, group elements can be rearranged if we consider the associativity. So, a x a³ y a². Hmm, but wait, a² times a is a³, right? So, a x (a² * a) y a² = a x a³ y a².

But wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me try that again. Let's compute f(x)*f(y) as (a x a²)(a y a²). Multiplying these two elements, we have a x a² a y a². Now, group elements can be rearranged due to associativity, but not commutativity unless the group is abelian. So, given that, let's see: a x a² a y a² = a x (a² a) y a². Since a² a is a³, that's a x a³ y a².

Now, compare this to f(xy), which is a (xy) a². So, a (xy) a² = a x y a².

For the map to be a homomorphism, these two expressions must be equal for all x and y in G. That means:

a x y a² = a x a³ y a².

Wait, let me write that again. On the left, after expanding f(xy), it's a x y a². On the right, f(x)f(y) is a x a³ y a². So, setting them equal:

a x y a² = a x a³ y a².

Hmm, I can cancel out some elements. Let's see, if I multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by a^{-2}, but maybe a better approach is to manipulate the equation.

Subtracting the right side from the left (not literally subtracting, but seeing what needs to hold), perhaps I can rearrange terms. Let's simplify:

Start with a x y a² = a x a³ y a².

If I multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1}, I get x y a² = a^{-1} a x a³ y a². Wait, a^{-1} a is e, so that simplifies to x y a² = e x a³ y a². Which is x y a² = x a³ y a².

Now, I can cancel the x on both sides. Since in a group, every element has an inverse, so I can multiply both sides on the left by x^{-1}, resulting in y a² = a³ y a².

Wait, let me re-express that correctly. After canceling x, we have y a² = a³ y a².

Now, multiply both sides on the right by a^{-2} to get rid of a² on both sides:

y a² a^{-2} = a³ y a² a^{-2}.

Simplifying, a² a^{-2} is e, so left side is y e = y.

Right side: a³ y e = a³ y.

So now we have y = a³ y.

Hmm, that's interesting. So, y = a³ y for all y in G. Let's rearrange this equation. Subtract y from both sides (again, not subtraction, but group operation), so y * y^{-1} = a³ y * y^{-1}.

Wait, more accurately, y can be moved to the other side. Let me think. If y = a³ y, then multiplying both sides on the left by a^{-3} gives a^{-3} y = y.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write y = a³ y. Then, moving terms: y (a³)^{-1} = e. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, from y = a³ y, I can write y (a³)^{-1} = e. Because if I multiply both sides on the right by (a³)^{-1}, I get y (a³)^{-1} = a³ y (a³)^{-1} → y (a³)^{-1} = y e → y (a³)^{-1} = y.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me try that again.

If y = a³ y, then subtract y from both sides? No, in group terms, I can rearrange it as y (a³)^{-1} = e. Because y = a³ y → y = y a³ → multiplying both sides on the right by a^{-3}, we get y a^{-3} = e. Then, since in a group, for each y, this must hold. So, y a^{-3} = e, which implies that y = a³ for all y? But that can't be unless the group is trivial.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if y a^{-3} = e for all y in G, then every element y is equal to a³. So, the group would only have one element, a³ = y for all y, meaning G is trivial. But that's not the case unless G is trivial, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, let me backtrack. So, the condition we arrived at was y a² = a³ y a². Then, multiplying both sides on the right by a^{-2} gives y = a³ y. So, y = a³ y for all y in G.

Wait, that can be rewritten as y a^{-3} = e for all y. Because from y = a³ y, I can write y a^{-3} y^{-1} = e, but that might complicate things. Wait, no, perhaps better to consider that if y = a³ y, then a³ must commute with every element y in G. So, a³ is in the center of G.

Wait, but for this to hold for all y, then a³ must equal e, because if a³ is the identity, then y = y e, which is always true. So, if a³ = e, then the condition holds.

Alternatively, if a³ is not e, then y = a³ y implies that a³ is acting as the identity element on y, which would only be possible if a³ is the identity. Because otherwise, applying a³ to y would change it, unless a³ is e.

So, from y = a³ y for all y in G, it must be that a³ = e. That is, a cubed equals the identity element.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. If a³ = e, then substituting back, the condition y = a³ y becomes y = e y, which is always true. So, that's a valid condition.

So, the condition is that a³ = e. So, looking at the options, option H says a^3 = e. Option E says a^3 = a, which would mean a^2 = e. But wait, our conclusion is a^3 = e.

So, the correct condition is that a³ = e. So, the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

We started with f(xy) = a xy a² and f(x)f(y) = (a x a²)(a y a²) = a x a^3 y a².

So, setting f(xy) equal to f(x)f(y), we have a xy a² = a x a^3 y a².

Then, cancel a on the left and a² on the right, leading to xy = x a^3 y.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me try that.

We have a xy a² = a x a^3 y a².

Multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by a^{-2}.

Left side: a^{-1} (a xy a²) a^{-2} = xy.

Right side: a^{-1} (a x a^3 y a²) a^{-2}.

Simplify right side: (a^{-1} a) x a^3 y (a² a^{-2}) → x a^3 y e → x a^3 y.

So, after simplifying, we have xy = x a^3 y.

Now, let's rearrange this. Subtract xy from both sides, but group theoretically, perhaps we can move terms around.

xy = x a^3 y → xy (a^3)^{-1} y^{-1} x^{-1} = e? Hmm, maybe a better approach is to manipulate the equation.

Alternatively, let me write it as xy = x a³ y.

I can multiply both sides on the left by x^{-1} and on the right by y^{-1}, giving:

x^{-1} xy y^{-1} = x^{-1} x a³ y y^{-1}

Simplifying, y = a³.

Wait, that can't be right because y is any element in G. So, if y = a³ for all y, then G is trivial, which isn't necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should factor the equation differently.

From xy = x a³ y, let's subtract x a³ y from both sides, but again, in group terms, perhaps moving terms: xy (a³)^{-1} = x.

Wait, let's try to isolate terms. Starting from xy = x a³ y.

Multiply both sides on the right by (a³)^{-1}:

xy (a³)^{-1} = x a³ y (a³)^{-1} → xy a^{-3} = x e.

So, xy a^{-3} = x. Then, multiply both sides on the left by x^{-1}:

x^{-1} xy a^{-3} = x^{-1} x → y a^{-3} = e.

So, y a^{-3} = e → y = a³ for all y in G. But that implies that every element y is equal to a³, which is only possible if G is trivial, i.e., only has the identity element.

Wait, that's a problem because the initial assumption is that the map is a homomorphism for any group G. So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that a³ = e is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe I took a wrong turn. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the condition for f to be a homomorphism. So, for f(xy) = f(x)f(y).

So, f(xy) = a (xy) a² = a x y a².

f(x)f(y) = (a x a²)(a y a²) = a x a² a y a² = a x a³ y a².

So, setting them equal: a x y a² = a x a³ y a².

Now, I can cancel a from the left and a² from the right because in a group, every element has an inverse. So, I can multiply both sides on the left by a^{-1} and on the right by a^{-2}.

That would give: x y = x a³ y.

Then, moving terms: x y = x a³ y → multiply both sides on the left by x^{-1}: y = x^{-1} x a³ y → y = a³ y.

Wait, that brings us back to y = a³ y for all y, which as before, implies a³ must be the identity. Because otherwise, for any y, this would mean that a³ y = y, which is only possible if a³ is e.

So, from this, the condition is that a³ = e. So, looking at the options, that's option H.

But earlier, when I thought that if a³ = e, then y = a³ y becomes y = e y, which is always true, so the condition holds. So, the map is a homomorphism if and only if a³ = e.

Wait, but let me consider when a³ = e. Then, the map becomes x ↦ a x a². But given that a³ = e, a² is a^{-1} because a³ = e → a^{-1} = a².

So, the map becomes x ↦ a x a^{-1}, which is a similarity transformation, or an inner automorphism if a is in G. Wait, but if a is in G, then this map is indeed an inner automorphism, which is a homomorphism.

Ah, so that's correct. So, if a³ = e, the map x ↦ a x a² is an inner automorphism, hence a homomorphism.

So, the correct answer is option H: a³ = e.

To determine when the map \( f: x \mapsto axa^2 \) is a homomorphism, we need to verify that it preserves the group operation, i.e., \( f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \) for all \( x, y \in G \). Let us compute both sides of this equation:

1. **Compute \( f(xy) \):**
   \[
   f(xy) = a(xy)a^2
   \]

2. **Compute \( f(x)f(y) \):**
   \[
   f(x)f(y) = (axa^2)(aya^2) = axa^2 \cdot aya^2 = axa^3ya^2
   \]

3. **Set \( f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \):**
   \[
   a(xy)a^2 = axa^3ya^2
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Multiply both sides on the left by \( a^{-1} \) and on the right by \( a^{-2} \):
     \[
     xy = xa^3y
     \]
   - Rearrange terms:
     \[
     xy = xa^3y \implies y = a^3y
     \]

5. **Interpret the result:**
   The equation \( y = a^3y \) must hold for all \( y \in G \). This is only possible if \( a^3 = e \), where \( e \) is the identity element of the group. If \( a^3 = e \), then \( a^2 = a^{-1} \), and the map \( f(x) = axa^2 \) becomes \( f(x) = axa^{-1} \), which is an inner automorphism and thus a homomorphism.

6. **Verify the condition:**
   If \( a^3 = e \), the map \( f(x) = axa^2 \) preserves the group operation, making it a homomorphism. If \( a^3 \neq e \), the equation \( y = a^3y \) cannot hold for all \( y \in G \), so the map is not a homomorphism.

Thus, the map \( f: x \mapsto axa^2 \) is a homomorphism if and only if \( a^3 = e \).

**Correct Answer:** H
