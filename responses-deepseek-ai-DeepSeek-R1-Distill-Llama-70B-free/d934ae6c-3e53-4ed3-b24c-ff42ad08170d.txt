Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about solar radiation and electromagnetic waves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the intensity of solar radiation at Earth's mean distance is 1.35 × 10^3 J/(m²·s). It asks, if all the radiation were at one wavelength, what would be the amplitude of the electromagnetic waves from the sun at Earth's position. The options are A through D, each giving values for the electric and magnetic field amplitudes.

Wait, I remember that the intensity of an electromagnetic wave is related to the electric and magnetic field amplitudes. Oh right, the formula is I = (1/2) * c * ε₀ * E₀², where I is intensity, c is speed of light, ε₀ is vacuum permittivity, and E₀ is electric field amplitude. Similarly, the magnetic field B₀ can be found using B₀ = E₀ / c.

But wait, let me make sure. Oh yeah, the average intensity (or the Poynting vector) for an electromagnetic wave is given by (1/2)cε₀ E₀². So that should be the starting point.

So given I = 1.35e3 J/(m²·s), I can solve for E₀. Let me plug in the numbers.

I = (1/2) * c * ε₀ * E₀²

I need to solve for E₀. Rearranging:

E₀² = (2I) / (c * ε₀)
E₀ = sqrt( (2I) / (c * ε₀) )

Wait, what are the values for c and ε₀? Let me recall. The speed of light c is approximately 3.00e8 m/s. The vacuum permittivity ε₀ is about 8.85e-12 F/m (farads per meter).

So plugging the values in:

E₀ = sqrt( (2 * 1350) / (3e8 * 8.85e-12) )

Wait, 2*1350 is 2700. The denominator is 3e8 * 8.85e-12. Let me calculate that.

3e8 is 3 * 10^8, 8.85e-12 is 8.85 * 10^-12. Multiplying them: 3 * 8.85 = 26.55, and 1e8 * 1e-12 = 1e-4. So 26.55e-4. Wait, no, 3e8 * 8.85e-12 = 3 * 8.85 * 1e8 * 1e-12 = 26.55 * 1e-4 = 0.002655.

So denominator is 0.002655.

So (2I)/(c ε₀) = 2700 / 0.002655. Let me compute that. 2700 / 0.002655 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2700 / 0.002655. Let me write it as 2700 * (1 / 0.002655). 1/0.002655 is approximately 376.42. So 2700 * 376.42 = ?

Wait, 2700 * 300 is 810,000. 2700 * 76.42 is approx 2700 *70=189,000; 2700*6.42=17,334. So total is 189,000 +17,334=206,334. So total approx 810k +206k = 1,016,334. So (2I/(c ε₀)) is approx 1.016e6. So E₀ is square root of that.

Square root of 1.016e6 is about 1008 V/m. Wait, because 1008^2 is 1,016,064, which is close.

So E₀ ≈ 1008 V/m. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option C is 1.01e3 V/m, which is 1010, close to our calculation. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait another approach: 3e8 * 8.85e-12 = 26.55e-4 = 0.002655.

So 2I = 2 * 1350 = 2700.

2700 / 0.002655 = 2700 / 0.002655.

Let me calculate 2700 divided by 0.002655.

Let me write both in scientific notation: 2700 = 2.7e3; 0.002655=2.655e-3.

So (2.7e3) / (2.655e-3) )= (2.7 / 2.655) ) * 1e6.

2.7 / 2.655 ≈ 1.016. So 1.016e6.

So sqrt(1.016e6) = sqrt(1.016) * 1e3.

sqrt(1.016) is about 1.008, so 1.008e3 V/m, which is 1008 V/m. So about 1.01e3 V/m. So that matches option C, which says 1.01 ×10^3 V·m⁻¹.

Now, the magnetic field amplitude B₀ is E₀/c. So B₀ = E₀ / c.

c is 3e8 m/s. So 1008 / 3e8 = (1008 / 3) * 1e-8.

1008 /3 is 336. So 336e-8 = 3.36e-6 T·m⁻¹ or Wb/(m²) since 1 T = 1 Wb/m².

Wait, the unit for B is tesla, which is equivalent to Wb/m². So B₀ is 3.36e-6 Wb/m².

Looking at the options, option C has 3.37e-6 Wb·m⁻². Wait, our calculation is 3.36e-6, but option C is 3.37. Hmm, perhaps due to more precise calculation in the intermediate steps.

Wait, let me compute E₀ more accurately. Let's go back.

I = 1350 J/(m²·s).
E₀ = sqrt( (2 * I) / (c ε₀) )

Compute denominator: c ε₀ = (3e8 m/s) * (8.85e-12 F/m) = 3e8 * 8.85e-12 = (3 *8.85) * 1e8 * 1e-12 = 26.55 * 1e-4 = 0.002655.

Then 2I = 2700.

2700 / 0.002655 = let's compute this division more accurately.

Compute 2700 ÷ 0.002655.

Let me think of it as 2700 ÷ 0.002655 = 2700 * (1 / 0.002655).

1 / 0.002655 = approx 376.42. So 2700 * 376.42.

I can compute this as 2700 * 376 = 2700*300=810,000 + 2700*76=205,200 → 810,000 + 205,200 = 1,015,200.

Then 2700 * 0.42 = 1134. So total is 1,015,200 + 1,134 = 1,016,334.

So 2I/(c ε₀) = 1,016,334 (unit: (V/m)^2).

So E₀ = sqrt(1,016,334) ≈ 1008 V/m.

Wait, let me calculate sqrt(1,016,334). Let's see:

1008² = (1000 +8)² = 1000² + 2*1000*8 +8² = 1,000,000 +16,000 +64 = 1,016,064.

Which is close to 1,016,334. So the difference is 1,016,334 -1,016,064= 270.

So (1008 + x)² ≈ 1,016,334.

Expanding (1008 +x)^2 = 1008² + 2*1008*x +x².

Set equal to 1,016,334:

1,016,064 + 2016 x + x² = 1,016,334.

Subtract 1,016,064: 2016 x +x² = 270.

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible.

So 2016 x ≈ 270 → x ≈ 270 / 2016 ≈ 0.1339.

So E₀ ≈ 1008.1339 V/m.

So about 1008.13 V/m, which is approximately 1.008e3 V/m.

So in the options, the closest is 1.01e3 V/m (option C). So that's E₀.

Then B₀ = E₀ / c.

E₀ is 1008.13 V/m, c is 3e8 m/s.

So B₀ = 1008.13 / 3e8 = 336.71e-9 T.

Which is 3.3671e-6 Wb/m².

Looking at the options, option C's B is 3.37e-6 Wb/m², which matches our calculation.

So option C should be the correct answer.

To determine the amplitude of electromagnetic waves from the sun at Earth's position, we start with the given intensity of solar radiation, \( I = 1.35 \times 10^3 \, \text{J} \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{s}^{-1} \). The intensity of an electromagnetic wave is related to the electric field amplitude \( E_0 \) by the formula:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} c \varepsilon_0 E_0^2
\]

Rearranging for \( E_0 \):

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0}}
\]

Here, \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \) is the vacuum permittivity. Substituting the values:

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 1350}{(3.00 \times 10^8) \cdot (8.85 \times 10^{-12})}}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
c \varepsilon_0 = (3.00 \times 10^8) \cdot (8.85 \times 10^{-12}) = 2.655 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:

\[
2I = 2 \cdot 1350 = 2700
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{2I}{c \varepsilon_0} = \frac{2700}{2.655 \times 10^{-3}} = 1.016 \times 10^6
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
E_0 = \sqrt{1.016 \times 10^6} \approx 1008 \, \text{V/m}
\]

This matches the electric field amplitude given in option C, \( 1.01 \times 10^3 \, \text{V/m} \).

Next, the magnetic field amplitude \( B_0 \) is related to \( E_0 \) by:

\[
B_0 = \frac{E_0}{c}
\]

Substituting \( E_0 = 1008 \, \text{V/m} \) and \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
B_0 = \frac{1008}{3.00 \times 10^8} = 3.36 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{Wb/m}^2
\]

This matches the magnetic field amplitude given in option C, \( 3.37 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: \( 1.01 \times 10^3 \, \text{V} \cdot \text{m}^{-1} \) and \( 3.37 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{Wb} \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \)**.

Answer: C
