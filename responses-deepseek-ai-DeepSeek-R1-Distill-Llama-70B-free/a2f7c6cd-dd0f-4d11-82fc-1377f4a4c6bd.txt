Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistics problem here. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked. 

The problem says: A filling machine puts an average of four ounces of coffee in jars, with a standard deviation of 0.25 ounces. Forty jars filled by this machine are selected at random. We need to find the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, right. So I'm dealing with the sampling distribution of the sample mean here. Because the problem is about the mean of 40 jars, which is a sample from the population of all jars filled by this machine.

I remember that when dealing with the sampling distribution, if the sample size is large enough (usually n ≥ 30), the Central Limit Theorem applies, and the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal, even if the population distribution isn't normal. Here, the sample size is 40, which is more than 30, so that's good.

The mean of the population (μ) is 4 ounces. The standard deviation of the population (σ) is 0.25 ounces. The sample size (n) is 40.

We're looking for the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is less than 3.9 ounces. So, P(x̄ < 3.9).

I think I should use the standard error, which is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The formula for standard error (SE) is σ / sqrt(n). Let me compute that.

SE = 0.25 / sqrt(40). Let me calculate sqrt(40). Well, sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(40) is about 6.3246. So SE ≈ 0.25 / 6.3246 ≈ 0.0395 or so. Let me do it more accurately. 6.32456 squared is 40, so 0.25 divided by 6.32456 is approximately 0.0395 ounces.

Now, since the sampling distribution is approximately normal, I can convert the sample mean of 3.9 into a z-score. The formula for z-score is (x̄ - μ) / SE.

Plugging the numbers in: (3.9 - 4) / 0.0395. Let's calculate the numerator first: 3.9 -4 is -0.1. So the z-score is -0.1 / 0.0395 ≈ -2.5316.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 0.0395. Let me do 0.1 / 0.0395.

0.0395 times 2 is 0.079. So, 0.0395 * 2.5 is 0.0395 * 2 = 0.079, 0.0395 * 0.5 = 0.01975; total 0.09875. So 2.5 times 0.0395 is 0.09875. But I have 0.1 divided by 0.0395. So 0.1 is 0.00125 more than 0.09875. So 0.00125 / 0.0395 ≈ 0.0316. So total z ≈ 2.5 + 0.0316 ≈ 2.5316. But since the numerator is negative, the z is -2.5316.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is less than -2.5316. That's the area to the left of z = -2.5316 in the standard normal distribution.

I remember that standard normal tables typically give the area to the left of a positive z. So for negative z, I can look up the absolute value and subtract from 1 if needed, but wait, let me think. The area to the left of -2.53 is the same as P(Z < -2.53). 

Looking up z = 2.53 in the standard normal table gives the area to the left of 2.53, which is about 0.994. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard normal table (Z-table) gives the cumulative probability P(Z ≤ z). So for z=2.53, it's around 0.994. So for z=-2.53, it's 1 - 0.994 = 0.006, approximately. Wait, no, because for z=2.53, the area to the left is 0.994, so the area to the left of -2.53 is 0.006. Wait, but my z is approximately -2.5316, which is a little more negative than -2.53. So the area would be a little less than 0.006.

Alternatively, using a calculator, I can use the standard normal CDF function. But since I'm just estimating, let me think. For z=-2.53, the probability is about 0.0058. Wait, maybe I should be more precise. 

Alternatively, I can use the 68-95-99.7 rule, but that's more for approximating, but maybe not precise enough here. Another approach is to use the symmetry and the known values. For example, I know that for z= -2.5, the probability is about 0.0062, and for z=-2.6, it's about 0.0047. Since our z is -2.5316, which is between -2.53 and -2.54, but perhaps averaging.

Wait, let me think. Let me try to calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, I can use the standard normal table. Let's say z = -2.53. Looking up 2.53 in the table, the value for 2.53 is 0.9941, I think. So the area to the left of 2.53 is 0.9941, so the area to the left of -2.53 is 1 - 0.9941 = 0.0059. So approximately 0.0059.

But wait, my z is -2.5316, which is a bit beyond -2.53. So perhaps the area is slightly less than 0.0059, maybe around 0.0057 or so.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.0057, which is close. Another option is option G, which is 0.0225, but that's much higher. Option B is 0.025, which is higher than 0.0057. Option H is 0.001, which is lower. So perhaps 0.0057 is the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make a mistake in computing the z-score?

Let me recalculate. x̄ =3.9, μ=4, SE=0.25/sqrt(40).

Compute sqrt(40): 6.32455532. So SE=0.25/6.32455532 ≈ 0.0395395.

Z = (3.9 -4)/0.0395395 = (-0.1)/(0.0395395) ≈ -2.53105.

So the z-score is approximately -2.531. So in the standard normal distribution, the probability that Z is less than -2.531 is about 0.0057 (0.57%).

Looking at the options, option F is 0.0057. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I thought the area for z=-2.53 was 0.0059, and for z=-2.54, it's 0.0054 (as per standard tables). So with z=-2.531, it's about halfway between 2.53 and 2.54. So perhaps the exact value is around 0.0057, which would match option F.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator for more precision, but given the options, F seems the closest.

To solve the problem, we are dealing with the sampling distribution of the sample mean. The population mean (μ) is 4 ounces, the population standard deviation (σ) is 0.25 ounces, and the sample size (n) is 40. We need to find the probability that the sample mean (x̄) is less than 3.9 ounces, i.e., \( P(\bar{x} < 3.9) \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Standard Error (SE)
The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution and is given by:

\[
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
SE = \frac{0.25}{\sqrt{40}} \approx \frac{0.25}{6.3246} \approx 0.0395
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Z-Score
The z-score is used to standardize the sample mean and is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{SE}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
z = \frac{3.9 - 4}{0.0395} = \frac{-0.1}{0.0395} \approx -2.5316
\]

### Step 3: Find the Probability
We need to find the probability that the z-score is less than -2.5316, i.e., \( P(Z < -2.5316) \). Using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, the area to the left of \( z = -2.5316 \) is approximately 0.0057.

### Step 4: Match with the Options
Among the given options, the closest value to 0.0057 is option F.
