Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Charge-It revolving charge card. Let me read it again. The question says that each month, you have to pay one-sixth of the balance plus an interest charge of 1 and a half percent. The balance is $75, and I need to find out how much must be paid, the new unpaid balance, and the annual interest rate. Then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I should probably figure out each part step by step. So, the payment consists of two parts: the principal part and the interest.

Wait, but wait. The problem says payment is one-sixth of the balance each month. So does that mean that each payment is 1/6 of the current balance, and then on top of that, there's an interest charge of 1.5% per month? Or is the 1.5% included in the one-sixth payment?

Hmm, the wording says "payment of one-sixth of the balance each month, along with an interest charge of 1(1/2)%." So that suggests that the payment is 1/6 of the balance, and then there's an additional 1.5% interest charged. Or maybe the 1.5% is calculated on the balance before the payment is made. Not entirely sure, but I think that's the case.

Wait, actually, maybe I should think about how revolving credit cards typically work. Usually, you make a minimum payment each month, which might include some principal and interest. But in this case, the problem says you pay one-sixth of the balance each month along with an interest charge.

So perhaps the way it's structured is that the payment is the sum of 1/6 of the balance plus the interest. Or maybe the payment is 1/6, and the interest is calculated on the remaining balance after the payment is made.

Wait, no, that doesn't make much sense. Let me think again. Let's assume that each month, the payment is 1/6 of the balance, and on top of that, an interest charge of 1.5% is added to the unpaid balance. Or perhaps the interest is calculated on the balance before the payment is made.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the interest first and then subtract the payment. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the payment is equal to 1/6 of the balance plus the interest on the balance. Let me clarify.

Suppose the balance is $75. The payment is 1/6 of that, which is 75/6 = $12.50. Then, the interest is 1.5% of $75, which is 75 * 0.015 = $1.125. So the total payment would be 12.50 + 1.125 = $13.625, which is approximately $13.63. Then the new balance would be the original $75 minus the principal part of the payment. Wait, the principal paid is $12.50, so the new balance is 75 - 12.50 = $62.50. But wait, then the interest is $1.125, so is that added to the new balance or subtracted?

Wait, no, perhaps the way it works is that each month, the interest is added to the balance, and then you pay 1/6 of the new balance. Hmm, that could be another approach.

Wait, let's think carefully. Let me outline possible approaches.

Approach 1: Each month, you pay 1/6 of the current balance. Then, interest of 1.5% is charged on the remaining balance. So, the steps would be:

1. Calculate the payment as 1/6 of $75: 75/6 = $12.50.
2. Subtract that payment from the balance: 75 - 12.50 = $62.50.
3. Then, add 1.5% interest on the new balance: 62.50 * 0.015 = $0.9375.
4. So the new balance becomes 62.50 + 0.9375 = $63.4375, which is approximately $63.44.

But looking at the options, I don't see any that match this exactly, so maybe I'm doing it wrong.

Approach 2: The payment is 1/6 of the balance plus 1.5% interest on the balance. So:

1. Payment = (75/6) + (75 * 0.015) = 12.50 + 1.125 = $13.625 ≈ $13.63.
2. The amount paid is $13.63, so the new balance would be 75 - 12.50 (the principal part) = $62.50. But wait, the interest is $1.125, so perhaps the new balance is 75 - (12.50 - 1.125) = 75 - 11.375 = 63.625? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated on the unpaid balance after the payment. Let me think again.

Alternative Approach:

Each month, you pay 1/6 of the balance as principal, and then the interest is calculated on the remaining balance.

So:

1. Balance = $75.
2. Principal payment = 75/6 = $12.50. So the remaining balance after principal is 75 - 12.50 = $62.50.
3. Interest on this remaining balance: 62.50 * 0.015 = $0.9375.
4. So the new balance is 62.50 + 0.9375 = $63.4375 ≈ $63.44.

But looking at the options, none of them have a new balance of $63.44. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated on the original balance before the payment is made. So:

1. Interest = 75 * 0.015 = $1.125.
2. Payment is 1/6 of the balance: $12.50.
3. So total amount paid is 12.50 + 1.125 = $13.625 ≈ $13.63.
4. The new balance is 75 - 12.50 = $62.50, but then we add the interest, so 62.50 + 1.125 = $63.625, which is $63.63. Hmm, but this still doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the payment is 1/6 of the balance, which includes both principal and interest. Wait, that might not make sense because 1/6 is just the principal part, and the interest is separate. Or perhaps 1/6 is the total payment, including interest. Let me read the question again.

The question states: "payment of one-sixth of the balance each month, along with an interest charge of 1(1/2)%."

Ah, so the payment is one-sixth of the balance, and in addition, there's an interest charge. So the payment is 1/6 of the balance, and the interest is calculated on the remaining balance after the payment.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Payment = 75 / 6 = $12.50.
2. The remaining balance after payment is 75 - 12.50 = $62.50.
3. Interest is 1.5% of this remaining balance: 62.50 * 0.015 = $0.9375.
4. So the new balance is 62.50 + 0.9375 = $63.4375.

But this doesn't match any of the options, as the new balances in the options are either $60, $60.37, $62.25, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the interest is calculated on the original balance before the payment is made. So:

1. Interest = 75 * 0.015 = $1.125.
2. Payment is 1/6 of 75 = $12.50.
3. So the total amount paid is 12.50, which includes principal, and the interest is added to the remaining balance.
4. So the new balance would be 75 - 12.50 (principal) = $62.50, plus interest of $1.125, totaling $63.625.

But again, this doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is $13.63 paid, new balance $62.50, and annual rate 18%. That seems to align with Approach 2 where payment is $13.63, which is 12.50 + 1.125. Then the new balance is 75 - 12.50 = 62.50, but where does the 1.125 go? Because if the payment includes the interest, then the new balance would be 75 - 12.50 (principal) = 62.50. Wait, but the interest is part of the payment, so maybe the new balance is 75 - (12.50 + 1.125) = 61.375, which is $61.38. That's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Suppose the payment is 1/6 of the balance, which is $12.50. Then, the interest is 1.5% on the remaining balance after the payment. So:

- Payment: $12.50

Remaining balance: 75 - 12.50 = 62.50.

Interest on remaining: 62.50 * 0.015 = 0.9375.

So new balance: 62.50 + 0.9375 = 63.4375. So the new balance is $63.44.

Looking at the options, none have this exact figure. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated on the original balance before any payment. So:

Interest = 75 * 0.015 = $1.125.

Then, the payment is 1/6 of 75, which is $12.50. So total paid is $13.625 ($12.50 + $1.125). So the new balance is 75 - 12.50 = $62.50.

But that would mean the interest is $1.125, which is part of the payment. So the new balance is 62.50, because the interest has already been paid. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because interest is usually added to the balance, not paid as part of the payment.

Wait, maybe the payment is just the principal, and the interest is added to the balance.

So:

- Payment: $12.50 (principal)
- Interest: $1.125 added to the new balance.

So new balance = (75 - 12.50) + 1.125 = 62.50 + 1.125 = $63.625.

But again, none of the options have this. So I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: payment $13.63, new balance $62.50, annual 18%.

If payment is $13.63, then that's 75 - 62.50 = $12.50 paid towards principal, and the rest is interest.

Wait, no, because 75 - 62.50 = 12.50 is the principal paid. So the interest would be 13.63 -12.50 = $1.13.

Wait, but 1.5% of 75 is $1.125, which is approximately $1.13. So perhaps that's how it's calculated.

So in this case, the payment is $13.63, which includes $12.50 principal and $1.13 interest. Then the new balance is 75 - 12.50 = $62.50. Because the interest is already paid as part of the $13.63, so no more interest is added. That makes sense. So the new balance is $62.50.

Wait, but that approach would mean that the interest is part of the payment, so the balance doesn't accrue any interest beyond what's paid. But that's not how interest usually works; usually, interest is added to the balance.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

Each month, you pay 1/6 of the balance, which is $12.50, and then the interest is 1.5% on the remaining balance. So:

- Payment made: $12.50 (principal)
- Remaining balance: 75 -12.50 = $62.50
- Interest on remaining: 62.50 * 0.015 = $0.9375
- New balance: 62.50 + 0.9375 = $63.4375

But this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the interest is calculated on the original balance before the payment.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the total payment each month is 1/6 of the balance plus 1.5% interest on the balance.

So payment = (75/6) + (75 *0.015) = 12.50 +1.125 = $13.625 ≈ $13.63.

So the payment is $13.63. The principal part is 12.50, so the new balance is 75 -12.50 = 62.50. And since the interest was already paid as part of the payment, the new balance is just 62.50. That seems to fit option E.

So option E says payment $13.63, new balance $62.50, and annual rate 18%.

Wait, but the annual rate: the problem states 1.5% per month. So the annual rate would be 1.5% *12 = 18% per annum. So that's correct.

So the correct answer would be E: $13.63, $62.50, 18%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is: $13.63, $62.50, 18%. So that's matching.

Another option to check is option B: $14.63, $60.37, 20%. That would require a higher payment, so perhaps the interest is compounded differently.

Wait, but let's double-check the calculations.

If the payment is 1/6 of $75: 75 /6 =12.5.

Interest is 1.5% of 75: 1.125.

Total payment:12.5 +1.125=13.625, which is $13.63 when rounded to the nearest cent.

So the payment is $13.63.

Then, the new balance is 75 -12.5=62.5. But wait, because the interest was part of the payment, the new balance is 62.5. So no additional interest is added beyond what's already paid.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because usually, when you pay, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the payment is 1/6 of the balance, and then the interest is calculated on the remaining balance after the payment. So:

Payment = 75/6 =12.5.

Remaining balance =75 -12.5=62.5.

Interest on remaining:62.5 *0.015=0.9375.

So new balance=62.5 +0.9375=63.4375.

Which is approximately $63.44.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps the problem is structured differently.

Wait, perhaps the 1.5% interest is added to the balance before the payment is made. So:

New balance before payment:75 *1.015=75 +1.125=76.125.

Payment:76.125 /6=12.6875.

So payment is approximately $12.69.

But this approach doesn't seem to match any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.5% is a monthly interest rate, so the annual rate is 1.5% *12=18%, which matches option E's annual rate.

So given that, and the payment being $13.63, new balance $62.50, which is exactly 75 -12.50, perhaps the interest is considered as part of the payment, so the new balance doesn't include any additional interest beyond what's paid.

Wait, but that would mean the interest is being paid each month, so the balance decreases by the principal plus interest. So the new balance is 75 - (12.50 +1.125)=61.375, which is $61.38. But that's not one of the options either.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but option E seems to match the numbers I'm getting for payment and annual rate. So perhaps the correct answer is E.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the monthly payment, the new unpaid balance, and the annual interest rate for the Charge-It revolving charge card. The card requires a payment of one-sixth of the balance each month, along with an interest charge of 1.5%. The balance is $75.

### Step 1: Calculate the monthly payment
The payment consists of two parts:
1. **Principal payment**: One-sixth of the balance:  
   \[
   \text{Principal payment} = \frac{75}{6} = 12.50
   \]
2. **Interest charge**: 1.5% of the balance:  
   \[
   \text{Interest charge} = 75 \times 0.015 = 1.125
   \]
   Rounding to the nearest cent, the interest charge is approximately $1.13.

Thus, the total monthly payment is:  
\[
\text{Total payment} = 12.50 + 1.13 = 13.63
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new unpaid balance
The new balance is the original balance minus the principal payment. The interest charge is included in the payment, so it does not accrue on the new balance.  
\[
\text{New balance} = 75 - 12.50 = 62.50
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the annual interest rate
The monthly interest rate is 1.5%. To find the annual interest rate, multiply the monthly rate by 12:  
\[
\text{Annual interest rate} = 0.015 \times 12 = 0.18 \, \text{or} \, 18\%
\]

### Final Answer
The monthly payment is $13.63, the new unpaid balance is $62.50, and the annual interest rate is 18%. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: $13.63, $62.50, 18%**
