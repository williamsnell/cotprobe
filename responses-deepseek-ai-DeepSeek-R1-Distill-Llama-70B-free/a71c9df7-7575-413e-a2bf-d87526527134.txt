Question:

A woman was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?

Options:

A: No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.
B: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.
C: Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.
D: Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with damages for lost earning capacity. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The scenario is about a woman who was in a car accident and lost her right eye. She was an apprentice ballet dancer and couldn't return to work because of her injuries. She had several operations and suffered from loss of coordination, headaches, and disfigurement. The trial court allowed evidence about her lost earning capacity as a ballet dancer, and the jury awarded her $3 million. The defendant is appealing, arguing that it's too speculative whether she would have been successful.

I remember that when calculating damages for personal injuries, especially in cases of disability, courts consider both past and future lost earnings. But the thing is, the plaintiff was an apprentice, not yet an established professional. So the question is whether it's too speculative to award damages based on the potential earnings of a ballet dancer.

I think the general rule is that plaintiffs can recover for loss of earning capacity even if they're not currently employed, as long as there's a reasonable basis to show what their future earnings would have been. So, for example, if someone is in a promising position or has a clear trajectory towards higher earnings, the court can consider that.

In this case, she was an apprentice, which suggests she was in training and possibly on the path to becoming a professional. The trial court allowed evidence about a ballet dancer's earning capacity, which implies there was some evidence presented about her potential. But the defendant argues it's too speculative.

I recall that courts don't require absolute certainty. They allow for some degree of speculation as long as the evidence provides a reasonable basis for the calculation. So even if it's not a guarantee, if there's evidence that she had a good chance of success, that should be enough.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the jury's award is discretionary and can't be disturbed. But I don't think that's right because appellate courts can reverse if the trial court made an error in allowing certain evidence. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says some imprecision is expected and not grounds for excluding evidence. That sounds correct because the law allows for some uncertainty as long as there's a reasonable foundation.

Option C argues that the evidence didn't guarantee success. But the law doesn't require a guarantee, just a reasonable probability. So C might be a reason to reverse, but I think B is the better answer.

Option D says she can only collect for past work and future as an apprentice. But I think she can claim based on her potential career progression beyond being an apprentice, especially if she was on track to become a professional dancer.

So putting it together, the appellate court likely won't reverse because some imprecision is acceptable. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict. The trial court properly allowed evidence on the plaintiff's lost earning capacity as a ballet dancer, as the law permits some degree of speculation when calculating future damages. The plaintiff's status as an apprentice indicated a potential trajectory toward a professional career, providing a reasonable basis for the jury's consideration of her lost earning capacity. Therefore, the jury's award was not erroneous.

B
