Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about finding the entropy rate of a Markov chain for a king's random walk on a 3x3 chessboard. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that the entropy rate of a Markov chain is related to the uncertainty of the next state given the current state. It's calculated using the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another. The formula, if I recall correctly, involves the sum over all states of the entropy of the transition probabilities from each state, multiplied by the stationary distribution of those states.

So the formula should look something like H = Σ π_i H_i, where π_i is the stationary probability of being in state i, and H_i is the entropy of the transitions from state i. And each H_i is calculated as -Σ P_ij log2 P_ij, where P_ij is the transition probability from state i to j.

Alright, so the chessboard is 3x3. That means there are 9 squares. Each square is a state in the Markov chain. Now, a king in chess can move one square in any direction—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. So from any given position, how many possible moves does the king have?

Let me visualize the chessboard. The corners have fewer moves. For example, the top-left corner (let's say position (1,1)) can move right, down, or diagonally down-right. So that's 3 possible moves. Similarly, the edges that are not corners (like (1,2)) have 5 possible moves because the king can go in all directions except beyond the board. Wait, wait, no—wait. Let me count again for each position.

Actually, the number of possible moves depends on where the king is:

- Corner squares (4 in total): Each has 3 possible moves.
- Edge squares (non-corner, 4 in total, like (1,2), (2,1), etc.): Each has 5 possible moves.
- The center square (1 in total): Can move in 8 directions, so 8 possible moves.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the king on a 3x3 board. So for the corner, say (1,1), the king can go to (1,2), (2,1), or (2,2). So 3 moves. For an edge square like (1,2), the king can go to (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So 5 moves. The center square (2,2) can go to all 8 surrounding squares, but since the board is 3x3, those 8 are all within the board. So yes, 8 moves.

So the transition probabilities from each state depend on the number of possible moves. Assuming that the king moves uniformly at random to any adjacent square, each transition from a state i has equal probability. So the transition probabilities P_ij are 1/k, where k is the number of possible moves from state i.

Now, each state's entropy H_i is calculated as -sum (P_ij log2 P_ij). Since all P_ij are equal for a given state, this simplifies. Because for each i, all transitions from i have equal probability, so P_ij = 1/k_i, where k_i is the number of neighbors (including diagonally adjacent) for state i.

So H_i for a state with k_i neighbors is -k_i * (1/k_i) log2 (1/k_i) ) = - log2 (1/k_i) ) = log2(k_i).

So each H_i is log2(k_i), where k_i is the number of possible moves from state i.

Now, to compute the entropy rate H, we have to compute the sum over all states i of π_i * H_i, where π_i is the stationary distribution.

Assuming the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, which it is here because the king can return to any state from any other state, the stationary distribution π is uniform if the transition probabilities are symmetric in a certain way. Wait, but wait, is that the case here?

Hmm. Wait, in a symmetric random walk on a regular graph, the stationary distribution is uniform. But here, the graph isn't regular because each node has a different degree (k_i varies). So the stationary distribution π_i is proportional to the degree of node i. That is, π_i = degree(i) / (2 * |edges|) ), or more accurately, for a graph, the stationary distribution is given by π_i = degree(i) / (sum of all degrees).

Wait, no. For an undirected graph, the stationary distribution of a simple symmetric random walk is π_i = degree(i) / (2 * number of edges). Because for each edge, each end contributes 1 to the degree, so the sum of degrees is 2 * number of edges. So π_i = degree(i) / (2E).

But wait, in this case, the transition matrix isn't symmetric in the way that each edge is reciprocal. Because, for example, the king can move from a corner to an edge, and from edge to corner, but the transition probabilities differ because the number of neighbors is different.

Wait, actually, each transition probability P_ij is 1/k_i. So the transition matrix is not symmetric in general. Therefore, the stationary distribution may not be uniform, nor proportional to the degrees.

Hmm, so I need to compute the stationary distribution π. For a Markov chain, π is found by solving π P = π, and the normalization condition sum π_i = 1.

But since the chain is irreducible, the stationary distribution can be found. However, for a 3x3 grid, there are 9 states, which could make the calculations a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this as a symmetric graph, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Each state can transition to its neighbors with equal probability. So, for example, from a corner with 3 neighbors, each neighbor has a 1/3 chance. From an edge state with 5 neighbors, each has 1/5. From the center, each of 8 neighbors has 1/8.

Wait, but the transition matrix is such that P_ij = 1/k_i if j is a neighbor of i, else 0. Then, the detailed balance equations are π_i P_ij = π_j P_ji. So, for any two connected states i and j, π_i / π_j = P_ji / P_ij.

Because P_ji is 1/k_j if j is connected to i, and P_ij is 1/k_i. So π_i / π_j = (1/k_j) / (1/k_i) ) = k_i / k_j.

So rearranged, π_i / π_j = k_i / k_j. Which suggests that π_i is proportional to k_i, the number of neighbors of state i. Because for any i and j connected, the ratio of their stationary probabilities equals the ratio of their degrees.

Wait, but what if i and j are not connected? Hmm, but for a connected graph, I think this proportionality holds because the graph is connected and the transitions are determined by the neighbor counts. So in this case, each π_i is proportional to the degree of node i.

Wait, but let me test with two nodes i and j connected, then π_i/π_j = k_i/k_j. So if this holds for all connected pairs, then yes, the stationary distribution is proportional to the degrees.

So for our chessboard, each state's degree is:

- 4 corner states with degree 3 each.
- 4 edge (non-corner) states with degree 5 each.
- 1 center state with degree 8.

So the sum of degrees is 4*3 + 4*5 + 1*8 = 12 + 20 + 8 = 40.

Therefore, the stationary probabilities are:

π_corner = 3 / 40 for each corner.

π_edge = 5 / 40 for each edge.

π_center = 8 / 40 = 1/5.

So for each corner, π_i = 3/40.

Each edge has π_i = 5/40 = 1/8.

The center has π_i = 8/40 = 1/5.

Now, the entropy contribution from each state is H_i = log2(k_i) as we determined earlier because each transition is equally likely. So for each state i, H_i is log2(3) for corners, log2(5) for edges, and log2(8) for the center.

So now, the total entropy rate H is:

H = sum_i π_i H_i

So let's break it down:

There are 4 corners, each contributes (3/40) * log2(3)

4 edges, each contributes (5/40) * log2(5)

1 center, contributes (8/40) * log2(8)

So H = 4*(3/40)*log2(3) + 4*(5/40)*log2(5) + 1*(8/40)*log2(8)

Simplify the coefficients:

= (12/40)*log2(3) + (20/40)*log2(5) + (8/40)*log2(8)

Simplify fractions:

12/40 = 3/10

20/40 = 1/2

8/40 = 1/5

So,

H = (3/10) log2(3) + (1/2) log2(5) + (1/5) log2(8)

Now, compute each term numerically.

We can compute each logarithm and multiply by the coefficient.

Compute log2(3) ≈ 1.58496 bits

log2(5) ≈ 2.32193 bits

log2(8) = 3 bits.

So,

First term: (3/10) * 1.58496 ≈ 0.3 * 1.58496 ≈ 0.475488

Second term: (1/2) * 2.32193 ≈ 0.5 * 2.32193 ≈ 1.160965

Third term: (1/5)*3 = 0.6

Now sum them up:

0.475488 + 1.160965 = 1.636453; adding 0.6 gives 2.236453 bits.

Wait, that's approximately 2.236. Looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Let me check the options again. The options are A:2.70, B:2.45, C:3.21, D:2.00, E:2.98, F:1.75, G:3.00, H:1.50, I:2.24, J:1.95.

Hmm, 2.236 is close to 2.24, which is option I. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the coefficients or the logarithms.

Let me recalculate:

Compute each term step by step.

First term: (3/10) * log2(3)

log2(3) ≈ 1.58496

3/10 is 0.3

0.3 * 1.58496 = 0.475488

Second term: (1/2) * log2(5) = 0.5 * 2.321928 ≈ 1.160964

Third term: (8/40) is 0.2, but wait wait: 8/40 is 1/5, which is 0.2. So 0.2 * 3 = 0.6. So that's correct.

Adding them: 0.475488 + 1.160964 = 1.636452; plus 0.6 gives 2.236452.

So approximately 2.236 bits. Looking at the options, option I is 2.24, which is very close. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure that the stationary distribution is correctly calculated. Because I think I might have made a mistake there. Earlier, I assumed that π_i is proportional to the degree of each node. But let's think again.

In a Markov chain with transition probabilities P_ij = 1/k_i if j is a neighbor of i, the stationary distribution is indeed proportional to the number of neighbors (degree), because the detailed balance holds as π_i P_ij = π_j P_ji. So π_i / π_j = P_ji / P_ij. Since P_ji = 1/k_j and P_ij =1/k_i, we have π_i / π_j = (1/k_j)/(1/k_i) ) = k_i /k_j. Therefore, π_i = π_j * (k_i /k_j). So for connected i and j, the ratio is k_i/k_j. So for the entire graph, the stationary distribution is proportional to the degrees.

Thus, the calculation seems correct.

So the entropy rate is approximately 2.236, which is closest to option I: 2.24.
</think>

To calculate the entropy rate of the Markov chain associated with a king's random walk on a 3x3 chessboard, we proceed as follows:

1. **States and Transitions**:  
   The chessboard has 9 states (squares). The king can move to adjacent squares, including diagonally. The number of possible moves (and thus transitions) depends on the position:
   - Corner squares (4 total): 3 possible moves.
   - Edge squares (4 total): 5 possible moves.
   - Center square (1 total): 8 possible moves.

2. **Transition Probabilities**:  
   The king moves uniformly at random to any adjacent square. Thus, the transition probabilities are:
   - From a corner: \( P_{\text{corner} \to \text{neighbor}} = \frac{1}{3} \).
   - From an edge: \( P_{\text{edge} \to \text{neighbor}} = \frac{1}{5} \).
   - From the center: \( P_{\text{center} \to \text{neighbor}} = \frac{1}{8} \).

3. **Entropy of Transitions**:  
   The entropy \( H_i \) for transitions from state \( i \) is given by:
   \[
   H_i = -\sum_j P_{ij} \log_2 P_{ij}.
   \]
   Since all transitions from a state are equally likely, this simplifies to:
   \[
   H_i = \log_2(k_i),
   \]
   where \( k_i \) is the number of possible moves from state \( i \). Thus:
   - \( H_{\text{corner}} = \log_2(3) \),
   - \( H_{\text{edge}} = \log_2(5) \),
   - \( H_{\text{center}} = \log_2(8) \).

4. **Stationary Distribution**:  
   The stationary distribution \( \pi_i \) is proportional to the degree of each state (number of neighbors). The degrees are:
   - Corners: 3 neighbors each,
   - Edges: 5 neighbors each,
   - Center: 8 neighbors.
   The sum of degrees is:
   \[
   4 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 8 = 40.
   \]
   Thus:
   - \( \pi_{\text{corner}} = \frac{3}{40} \),
   - \( \pi_{\text{edge}} = \frac{5}{40} = \frac{1}{8} \),
   - \( \pi_{\text{center}} = \frac{8}{40} = \frac{1}{5} \).

5. **Entropy Rate Calculation**:  
   The entropy rate \( H \) is:
   \[
   H = \sum_i \pi_i H_i.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   H = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{40} \cdot \log_2(3) + 4 \cdot \frac{5}{40} \cdot \log_2(5) + 1 \cdot \frac{8}{40} \cdot \log_2(8).
   \]
   Simplify the coefficients:
   \[
   H = \frac{12}{40} \cdot \log_2(3) + \frac{20}{40} \cdot \log_2(5) + \frac{8}{40} \cdot \log_2(8).
   \]
   Using \( \log_2(3) \approx 1.585 \), \( \log_2(5) \approx 2.322 \), and \( \log_2(8) = 3 \):
   \[
   H = \frac{3}{10} \cdot 1.585 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2.322 + \frac{1}{5} \cdot 3.
   \]
   Compute each term:
   \[
   H = 0.3 \cdot 1.585 + 0.5 \cdot 2.322 + 0.2 \cdot 3.
   \]
   \[
   H \approx 0.4755 + 1.161 + 0.6 = 2.2365 \, \text{bits}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:  
   The entropy rate is approximately \( 2.24 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
