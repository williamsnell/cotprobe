Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A city imposes a municipal excise tax of $200 per year on commercial photographic studios in the city. It also imposes an excise tax of $100 per year on every itinerant commercial photographer for the privilege of using the streets and sidewalks. A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the photographer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of a photographic studio in the city. In an action by a studio located in the city challenging the constitutionality of the $200 per year excise tax, the court will most likely declare the tax

Options:

A: unconstitutional, as an undue burden on interstate commerce.
B: unconstitutional, as a discriminatory tax on the privilege of doing business within the state.
C: constitutional, as it is within the city's rights to tax local businesses.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the rights of local businesses.
E: constitutional, as it is a fair method of raising municipal revenue.
F: unconstitutional, as it is a form of double taxation.
G: constitutional, as within the powers of the state to tax the instruments of interstate commerce.
H: constitutional, as it is a reasonable exercise of the city's taxing power.
I: unconstitutional, as it unfairly targets a specific profession.
J: constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about municipal excise taxes and their constitutionality. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that a city imposes a $200 per year excise tax on commercial photographic studios. Additionally, there's a $100 tax on itinerant photographers using the streets and sidewalks, but they get a credit if they or their employer already paid the studio tax. Now, a studio is challenging the $200 tax as unconstitutional.

I remember that excise taxes are levied on certain activities or privileges, not on property directly. So the city is taxing the privilege of operating a studio or being an itinerant photographer. 

The issue here is likely whether the tax violates any constitutional principles, particularly the commerce clause or equal protection. The commerce clause is about not unduly burdening interstate commerce, but this seems to be a local business tax, so maybe that's not the main issue here.

Wait, the tax applies to all commercial photographic studios in the city, whether they're part of interstate commerce or not. So if a studio operates locally, the tax applies. But if a business is from out of state, does this tax affect them differently? Well, the tax is the same for all studios, regardless of origin. So it's not discriminatory against interstate commerce.

Another angle is whether the tax is a form of double taxation. The itinerant photographers pay $100, but if they're associated with a studio that already paid $200, they get a credit. So the total wouldn't exceed $200 in those cases. But the studio itself is paying $200 regardless. Is this double taxation? Well, the studio and the itinerant photographer might be considered separate entities, so maybe not. Or perhaps it's a way to ensure that the tax isn't applied twice when photographers are linked to a studio.

Wait, the challenge is from the studio, arguing the $200 tax is unconstitutional. So what grounds could they have? Maybe that it's an undue burden on interstate commerce if the studio serves interstate clients. But if the tax is applied equally to all studios, it doesn't favor local over interstate. So the commerce clause might not be the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the tax is considered a direct tax on income, but excise taxes are usually on privileges, so that might not be the problem either. Or perhaps it's a violation of equal protection if the tax is not evenly applied. But the question says the tax is on every commercial studio, so it's uniform in that sense.

Wait, I think I remember something about the Supreme Court upholding certain license taxes. Like in the case where a state taxed corporations for the privilege of doing business, which was upheld. Or maybe the case about the excise tax on machinery if it's part of interstate commerce. But here, the tax is on the privilege of operating a studio, which is a local business activity.

So, considering that, the city likely has the authority to impose such a tax as part of their taxing powers. The tax doesn't seem to discriminate against interstate commerce or any particular group beyond the specific activity being taxed.

Looking at the options, option C says it's constitutional as within the city's rights. Option H says it's a reasonable exercise of the city's taxing power. Option J says it's a nondiscriminatory license tax.

Wait, the tax is a flat $200 on each studio. So it's not based on income or receipts, just a flat fee. But that's permissible as a license tax. The Supreme Court has allowed such taxes as long as they're not discriminatory against interstate commerce. Since this applies equally to all studios, regardless of where their business comes from, it's likely constitutional.

So the correct answer would probably be either C, H, or J. Option C says it's within the city's rights, H says it's reasonable, and J says it's a nondiscriminatory license tax.

I think the best fit is J, because it's a license tax that's applied nondiscriminatorily. Alternatively, H is about the city's taxing power. But wait, the question is about the constitutionality, so J's point about being a nondiscriminatory license tax seems directly on point. Because if the tax is a license tax and it's applied the same to everyone in the business, it's constitutional.

So I think the answer is J: constitutional, as a nondiscriminatory license tax.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a municipal excise tax imposed on commercial photographic studios. The tax in question is a flat $200 per year on studios and $100 per year on itinerant photographers, with a credit available to the latter if they or their employer have already paid the studio tax. The studio challenging the tax argues it is unconstitutional.

The analysis focuses on whether the tax violates constitutional principles, particularly the commerce clause or equal protection. The commerce clause is not a strong argument here because the tax applies uniformly to all studios, regardless of whether they engage in interstate commerce. Similarly, the tax does not appear to discriminate against any specific group or activity, as it is applied equally to all commercial photographic studios.

The tax can be viewed as a valid exercise of the city's taxing authority, specifically as a nondiscriminatory license tax on the privilege of operating a commercial studio. Such taxes are generally upheld as constitutional when they are applied uniformly and do not unduly burden interstate commerce or violate equal protection principles.

Among the options provided, the most accurate conclusion is that the tax is constitutional as a nondiscriminatory license tax. This aligns with the principle that such taxes are permissible when applied equally and without favoring local businesses over interstate commerce.

Answer: J
