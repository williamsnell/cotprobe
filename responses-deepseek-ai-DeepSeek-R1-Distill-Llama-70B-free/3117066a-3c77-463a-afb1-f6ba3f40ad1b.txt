Okay, so I need to figure out the basic laws of Boolean algebra from the given options. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, I recall that Boolean algebra is a system used in logic and digital electronics. It involves operations like AND, OR, and NOT. The basic laws probably include things like commutative and associative laws because I remember these being fundamental.

Let me think about each option one by one. 

Option A says the laws include Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Law of Union, Intersection, Double Negative, Law of complement, and deMorgan's law. That sounds right. I remember Idempotent laws where A OR A is A, and same for AND. Commutative means the order doesn't matter, like A OR B is same as B OR A. Associative is about grouping, like (A OR B) OR C being the same as A OR (B OR C). Distributive laws are similar to regular algebra, where OR distributes over AND and vice versa. The Law of Union and Intersection might relate to set operations, which are similar to Boolean OR and AND. Double Negative is where NOT NOT A equals A. Law of complement would be A OR NOT A is 1, and A AND NOT A is 0. De Morgan's laws deal with the negation of AND and OR statements, like NOT (A AND B) equals NOT A OR NOT B. So option A seems to cover a lot of the key laws.

Option B only includes Addition, Multiplication, and Complement. That feels too limited. I know there are more laws than just these three categories.

Option C mentions Scalar Multiplication, Vector Addition, etc., which seem more related to vector algebra, not Boolean. So probably not C.

Option D lists Associative, Distributive, Commutative, and Identity. Identity laws are about elements that don't change the result when operated on, like A OR 0 is A. But I'm not sure if that's all the basic laws. It misses some like Idempotent or deMorgan's.

Option E talks about Excluded Middle, Non-Contradiction, and Identity. These are more philosophical logic laws, not the algebraic ones. So E is probably not the right choice.

Option F has Idempotent, Non-Commutative, Associative, and Exclusive OR. Wait, Boolean algebra is commutative for OR and AND, right? So Non-Commutative doesn't fit, making F incorrect.

Option G includes Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, and Inverse. Inverse might refer to complement, but I'm not sure if that's a primary basic law. It might be a part of it, but perhaps not all the main ones are covered here.

Option H mentions Transitive, Reflexive, Symmetric, and Inverse. These terms are more from relations in set theory or graph theory, not directly Boolean algebra laws.

Option I and J refer to calculus and arithmetic operations, which are irrelevant here.

Putting it all together, option A seems to list all the major laws I remember. It includes the main ones like commutative, associative, distributive, and others. So I think the correct answer is A.

The basic laws of Boolean algebra are fundamental principles that govern the operations of Boolean logic, including AND, OR, and NOT. These laws ensure consistency and provide the foundation for simplifying and manipulating Boolean expressions. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** lists Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Law of Union, Law of Intersection, Double Negative Law, Law of Complement, and De Morgan's Law. These are indeed the core laws of Boolean algebra, covering essential properties like the order of operations (Commutative, Associative), how operations interact (Distributive), and fundamental logical equivalences (Idempotent, Double Negative, Law of Complement, De Morgan's Law).

- **Option B** is too limited, as it only includes Addition, Multiplication, and Complement, omitting key laws.

- **Option C** refers to concepts from vector algebra, not Boolean algebra.

- **Option D** includes Associative, Distributive, Commutative, and Identity but misses other critical laws like Idempotent and De Morgan's.

- **Option E** pertains to philosophical logic rather than algebraic laws.

- **Option F** incorrectly includes Non-Commutative, which does not apply to Boolean algebra.

- **Options G, H, I, and J** either omit key laws or refer to unrelated mathematical concepts.

Thus, **Option A** comprehensively covers the basic laws of Boolean algebra.
