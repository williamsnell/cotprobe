Okay, so I've got this question here about the Medici family and the philosophy their schools favored. Let me read through the information again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The text is from Bertrand Russell's "History of Western Philosophy." It mentions that the substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle was hastened by contact with Byzantine scholarship. Then it talks about a council in Ferrera in 1438 where the Byzantines argued that Plato was superior to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were really into Plato. Cosimo founded the Florentine Academy, and Lorenzo continued it, and the academy was mostly about studying Plato. The humanists of the time were busy learning about antiquity and didn't produce much of value, according to Russell.

So the question is asking what philosophy the Medici-founded schools favored. The options are A through J, with various philosophical terms.

Let me break it down. The key points are the Medici family's support for Plato and the Florentine Academy focusing on his works. I know that during the Renaissance, there was a shift from the dominant Aristotelian scholasticism of the Middle Ages to a more Platonic approach, especially in places like Florence.

Wait, so the Medici were addicted to Plato. Their academy was for studying Plato. So the school they founded would favor Platonism. But looking at the options, I need to see which one aligns with that.

Looking at the options:

A: Renaissance humanism. Well, humanism was a broad movement focusing on human potential and classical studies, but not specifically tied to Plato.

B: Empiricism. That's more about knowledge through senses and experience, which doesn't directly relate here.

C: Aristotelianism. The text says they were moving away from Aristotle to Plato, so this is the opposite.

D: Byzantinism. Not a standard philosophical term, I think. More about the Byzantine Empire, perhaps.

E: Stoicism. Another ancient philosophy, but the text doesn't mention it.

F: Scholasticism. That's the medieval approach, which they're moving away from.

G: Existentialism. That's a much later philosophy, not relevant here.

H: Neoplatonism. Hmm, Neoplatonism is a later development influenced by Plato, but the academy was focused on Plato's original works. Wait, but sometimes the Florentine Academy is associated with Neoplatonism because they blended Plato with Christian theology. So maybe that's it.

I: Neoclassicism. That's more about art and literature, 18th-century movement.

J: Rationalism. That's a 17th-century philosophy emphasizing reason, not directly tied to Plato.

Wait, the text says they were substituting Plato for Aristotle. So the school favored Plato's philosophy. Now, Neoplatonism is a specific school that came after Plato, often incorporating mysticism and Christian elements. The Florentine Academy, as I recall, was indeed into Neoplatonism, led by people like Marsilio Ficino, who translated Plato's works and integrated them with Christian thought.

So the correct answer would be H: Neoplatonism. Because the Medici's academy wasn't just about Plato but about a revival or new interpretation of his ideas, hence Neoplatonism.

The Medici family, particularly Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici, were instrumental in founding and supporting the Florentine Academy, which focused on the study of Plato's works. This academy was part of a broader movement that emphasized a return to classical knowledge and a shift away from the dominant Aristotelian scholasticism of the time. The Florentine Academy, under the influence of figures like Marsilio Ficino, not only studied Plato but also developed a synthesis of his ideas with Christian theology, which is characteristic of Neoplatonism. Therefore, the philosophy most favored by the schools founded by the Medici family was Neoplatonism.

Answer: H
