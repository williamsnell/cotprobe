Question:

What results would you expect if the macronucleus were removed from a paramecium?

Options:

A: causes cell death
B: The paramecium would grow in size
C: The paramecium would undergo metamorphosis
D: increased cell activity
E: The paramecium would exhibit increased motility
F: cell multiplication
G: The paramecium would develop into a different species
H: The paramecium would display enhanced sensory perception
I: sexual reproduction
J: The paramecium would divide more rapidly

Okay, so I've got this question about paramecia and their macronucleus. Hmm, I remember that paramecia are single-celled organisms, part of the protozoa group. They have two nuclei, right? The macronucleus and the micronucleus. From what I recall, the micronucleus is involved in sexual reproduction or something like that, while the macronucleus is more about the day-to-day functions of the cell.

Wait, the question says if the macronucleus is removed. So what happens then? I think the macronucleus controls most of the cell's metabolic activities. It's like the control center for growth, reproduction, and other regular functions. So if it's removed, the paramecium might not be able to function properly.

I remember reading that when the macronucleus is removed, the paramecium eventually dies. Because without it, the cell can't carry out its normal processes. It can't divide or grow anymore. So the cell would probably stop functioning and die.

Looking at the options, option A says causes cell death. That makes sense. Other options like increased motility or reproduction don't fit because without the macronucleus, those functions would stop. So the correct answer should be A.

The macronucleus in paramecia is responsible for controlling the cell's metabolic and reproductive functions. If it is removed, the paramecium loses its ability to perform essential functions, leading to cell death. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: causes cell death

Answer: A
