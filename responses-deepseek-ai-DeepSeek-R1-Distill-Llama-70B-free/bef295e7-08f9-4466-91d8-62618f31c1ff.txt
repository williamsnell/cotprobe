Okay, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about age discrimination in employment. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking about when evidence of age discrimination exists in the firing of an employee. The options are A through J. I need to determine which one is correct based on my understanding of age discrimination laws.

From what I remember, age discrimination laws, like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) in the US, protect employees who are 40 years old or older. So, age discrimination occurs when an employer makes an employment decision based on age, specifically against older employees.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Only when the employee is over the retirement age. Hmm, I think retirement age is more about when someone can collect certain benefits, but age discrimination laws apply regardless of whether the person is at retirement age or not. So this might not be correct.

Option B: Whenever an older employee is fired, regardless of the reason. That doesn't sound right. Just because an older employee is fired doesn't automatically mean it's discrimination. There could be valid reasons like poor performance or layoffs unrelated to age.

Option C: Whenever the employee's age is considered in any employment decision. Wait, I think it's not just considering age, but using it as a basis for a negative decision. For example, if a company considers age in hiring but in a non-discriminatory way, maybe that's not illegal. But if they use age to make a decision against someone, that's the problem. So maybe C is too broad because it includes any consideration, not just when it's the basis for an adverse action.

Option D: Whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing. This sounds right. If the firing is because of age rather than job performance or other valid reasons, that's discrimination. So D seems like a strong candidate.

Option E: Only when company policy reflects adverse impact on older workers. Adverse impact can be a factor, but I think it's broader than that. Even if a policy doesn't have an adverse impact, individual discrimination can still occur. So E might not be the best answer.

Option F: Only when the employee has filed a formal complaint about age discrimination. No, discrimination exists regardless of whether a complaint is filed. Filing is just how it's reported, not when it exists.

Option G: Only when there are multiple cases of age discrimination in the same company. No, even a single instance can be discriminatory. It doesn't require multiple cases.

Option H: Whenever the affected employee can demonstrate substantial economic loss. Economic loss is a result of discrimination, but the existence of discrimination doesn't depend on how much loss occurred. So H might not be correct.

Option I: Whenever a younger employee is hired to replace an older one. That could be a sign of discrimination, but it's not conclusive. There could be other reasons, like the younger person being more qualified. So I might not be correct because it's not always the case.

Option J: Only when the majority of employees in a given age group are adversely affected economically. Similar to G, it's about a pattern. But individual cases can also be discrimination, so J might not be correct.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. Because evidence of age discrimination exists when the firing is based on age rather than work performance or other legitimate factors.

The correct answer is based on understanding that age discrimination occurs when an employment decision, such as firing, is made based on the employee's age rather than on valid factors like work performance. This aligns with laws protecting older employees from being unfairly targeted due to their age.

Answer: D
