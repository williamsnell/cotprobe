Okay, so I have this economics problem here about combining supply schedules from four firms. Hmm, I remember that in a competitive market, total supply is just the sum of all individual supplies. Right, because each firm's supply contributes to the market total.

Let me look at the equations again. The question gives four supply equations:

Q₁S = 16 + 4P  
Q₂S = 5 - 5P  
Q₃S = 32 + 8P  
Q₄S = 60 - 10P  

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait, supply equations are usually in the form Q = a + bP, where a is the intercept and b is the slope. But hold on, for a supply curve, the slope should be positive because as price increases, quantity supplied increases. So looking at these, Q₂S and Q₄S have negative coefficients. That seems odd because a negative slope would mean that as price goes up, they supply less, which contradicts the law of supply. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Oh wait, no, maybe the equations are correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If P increases, Q supplied should increase, so the coefficient should be positive. So maybe there's a typo in the question's equations? Because Q₂S is 5 -5P, which would mean when P goes up, Q goes down. That doesn't make sense for supply. Same with Q₄S: 60 -10P. That would imply that at a higher price, the firm supplies less, which is not how supply works. Maybe I misread the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the equations are written correctly. Perhaps Q₂S and Q₄S are in the form where higher P leads to higher Q, but the signs are different. Wait, no. Because in Q₂S, as P increases, Q decreases. That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe the equations are actually Q₂S=5 + (-5)P and Q₄S=60 + (-10)P? That's possible. So maybe the equations are correct, but some have negative coefficients. So I'll proceed with that, assuming that the equations are correct as given. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps in this problem, some firms are decreasing their supply when price increases, which is unusual. But since it's given, I have to work with it.

So the task is to find the combined supply, which is the sum of all four Q^S. So I need to add all four equations together.

Let's break it down:

Q_total^S = Q₁S + Q₂S + Q₃S + Q₄S  
= (16 + 4P) + (5 -5P) + (32 +8P) + (60 -10P)  

Now, let's compute the constants and the coefficients of P separately.

Constants: 16 +5 +32 +60. Let's add them one by one.

16 +5 =21  
21 +32=53  
53 +60=113. So the constant term is 113.

Now for the P terms. Let's add the coefficients:

4P (from Q₁S)  
-5P (from Q₂S)  
+8P (from Q₃S)  
-10P (from Q₄S)  

Adding these up: 4 -5 +8 -10.

4-5 is -1. -1 +8 is 7. 7-10 is -3. So the P term is -3P.

Putting it together, Q_total^S = 113 -3P.

Now I look at the options. Let me check each option:

Option A: 113 -5P → No, because our calculation gives -3P.

Option B: 108 -6P → Nope.

Option C: 120 +0P → No.

Option D: 116 +2P → No.

Option E:113 -3P → Yes, that's exactly what we got.

So the correct answer should be option E.

To determine the combined supply of the four firms, we sum their individual supply equations:

\[
Q_1^S = 16 + 4P, \quad Q_2^S = 5 - 5P, \quad Q_3^S = 32 + 8P, \quad Q_4^S = 60 - 10P
\]

The total supply is given by:

\[
Q^S_{\text{total}} = Q_1^S + Q_2^S + Q_3^S + Q_4^S
\]

First, we add the constant terms:

\[
16 + 5 + 32 + 60 = 113
\]

Next, we add the coefficients of \(P\):

\[
4P - 5P + 8P - 10P = (4 - 5 + 8 - 10)P = -3P
\]

Combining these results, the total supply equation is:

\[
Q^S_{\text{total}} = 113 - 3P
\]

Now, we compare this result with the given options:

- **A:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 113 - 5P\) → Incorrect, as the coefficient of \(P\) is \(-5\), not \(-3\).
- **B:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 108 - 6P\) → Incorrect, as the constant term is \(108\), not \(113\), and the coefficient of \(P\) is \(-6\), not \(-3\).
- **C:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 120 + 0P\) → Incorrect, as the constant term is \(120\), not \(113\), and the coefficient of \(P\) is \(0\), not \(-3\).
- **D:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 116 + 2P\) → Incorrect, as the constant term is \(116\), not \(113\), and the coefficient of \(P\) is \(2\), not \(-3\).
- **E:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 113 - 3P\) → Correct, as it matches the derived equation.
- **F:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 113 + 3P\) → Incorrect, as the coefficient of \(P\) is \(3\), not \(-3\).
- **G:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 115 - 7P\) → Incorrect, as the constant term is \(115\), not \(113\), and the coefficient of \(P\) is \(-7\), not \(-3\).
- **H:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 111 + 7P\) → Incorrect, as the constant term is \(111\), not \(113\), and the coefficient of \(P\) is \(7\), not \(-3\).
- **I:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 113 + 5P\) → Incorrect, as the coefficient of \(P\) is \(5\), not \(-3\).
- **J:** \(Q^S_{\text{total}} = 118 - 2P\) → Incorrect, as the constant term is \(118\), not \(113\), and the coefficient of \(P\) is \(-2\), not \(-3\).

The correct answer is **E**.
