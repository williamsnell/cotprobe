Okay, so I have this problem about an elliptically polarized wave, and I need to find the power per unit area it conveys. Hmm, I remember that the power in an electromagnetic wave is related to the electric and magnetic fields. Oh right, the Poynting vector gives the power per unit area, and its average value is important here.

Wait, the wave is in air, so the impedance should be the intrinsic impedance of free space, which is η0 = 377 ohms approximately. But wait, the exact value might be sqrt(μ0/ε0), but maybe I can just remember η0 as 377 Ω.

So, the Poynting vector's average value (which is the time-averaged power per unit area) is given by the formula S_avg = (E_x^2 + E_y^2) / (2η0). Or wait, is that right? No, wait, for circularly polarized waves, maybe. Or elliptically, perhaps it's similar.

Wait, another approach: for a plane wave in air, the average power is (|E_x|^2 + |E_y|^2)/(2η0). Because each component contributes to the power, considering their RMS values. Oh right! Because the electric field has two components, each squared, added, then divided by two times η0.

So the given E_x and E_y are peak values, right? So I need to find their RMS values. RMS is peak divided by sqrt(2). So each squared term would be (E_peak)^2 / 2.

Wait, let me think again. The average power <S> is (1/2) * (E_x^2/(η0)) + (1/2)*(E_y^2/(η0)) ), but only if the wave is linearly polarized or something. Wait, no, in elliptical polarization, the fields can have a phase difference, but when calculating average power, the cross terms might average out. So perhaps the average is (E_x^2 + E_y^2) / (2η0).

Wait, no, maybe that's not correct. Wait, the general formula for the average Poynting vector is (1/2μ0ω) * |E × H|, but H is related to E via H = E / η0 in the direction of propagation. Alternatively, since E and B are in phase, and B = E/(cμ0), but perhaps it's easier to stick with the formula S_avg = (E_rms_x)^2 / η0 + (E_rms_y)^2 / η0. Or wait, no, that's just for linear polarization. Wait no, let me think.

Wait, the Poynting vector S is E cross H. For a plane wave in the z direction, E is in x and y, H is in x and y as well, but perpendicular to E and direction of propagation. Wait, the standard plane wave has E and H in phase, and H is E divided by η0. So the Poynting vector S is E x H, which would be (E_x i + E_y j) cross (H_x i + H_y j - ... wait, no, actually H would be in the y and x directions? No, wait, no, for a wave propagating in the +z direction, E has x and y components, and H has x and y components perpendicular to E and z. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the average power is (1/2) ε0 c (E_x^2 + E_y^2), but wait, because for linear polarization, the average power is (E^2)/(2η0), where E is the peak value. Because η0 = sqrt(μ0/ε0) = μ0 c. So 1/(2η0) is (1/(2μ0 c)).

Wait, let's get this right. The instantaneous Poynting vector S is E cross H. For a plane wave, H = E/(η0) in the same direction as E but perpendicular to z (assuming propagation in z). So S would be (E_x i + E_y j) cross ( (E_x i + E_y j)/η0 ) × direction? Wait no, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, in a plane wave, E and H are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation (z). So E could be in x, H in y, for example, for linear polarization. So in that case, S = E_x H_y in the z direction. But in the case of elliptical polarization, E has x and y components. Hmm.

But in any case, the time-averaged Poynting vector is (1/2) Re(E × H*), where H* is the complex conjugate of H. For a plane wave in air, H = (E×n)/η0, where n is the unit vector in the direction of propagation. So for propagation in +z, H would be (E_y i - E_x j)/η0. Wait, maybe I should think of E and H as phasors.

Let me denote E as E_x i + E_y j, and H as H_x i + H_y j. Since the wave propagates in the +z direction, H must be related such that E × H is in +z. So using the right-hand rule, if E is in x and y, H must be such that E cross H is along z. So H would be (E_y, -E_x, 0) scaled by some factor. Oh wait, more accurately, H = (1/η0) (E × z_hat). Because for a wave propagating in +z, H is (E × z_hat)/η0. So E × z_hat would be E_y i - E_x j. So H = (E_y i - E_x j)/η0.

So the Poynting vector S is E cross H. Which would be (E_x i + E_y j) cross ( (E_y i - E_x j)/η0 ) = [E_x*(E_y/η0) - E_y*(-E_x/η0) ) ] k.

Wait, let me compute the cross product. The cross product of (a i + b j) and (c i + d j) is (a d - b c) k. So in this case:

E_x * (E_y / η0) - E_y * (-E_x / η0) ) = E_x E_y / η0 + E_x E_y / η0 = 2 E_x E_y / η0.

Wait, but that can't be right because when E_x and E_y are in phase, like in linear polarization, the average power should be (E^2)/(2η0). Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait no, perhaps I should consider the time-averaged value. Because when taking the average, the product E_x E_y might involve terms that depend on time. For example, if E_x = E0x sin(ωt), and E_y = E0y sin(ωt + φ), then E_x E_y would have terms in sin^2 and cosφ sin terms. But when averaged over a full cycle, the cross terms (the ones with cosφ) would average to zero if φ isn't zero. Wait, no, because when φ is a fixed phase shift, the average of E_x E_y over time is (E0x E0y cosφ)/2, because:

E_x(t) = E0x sin(ωt)
E_y(t) = E0y sin(ωt + φ) = E0y [sin(ωt) cosφ + cos(ωt) sinφ]

So E_x E_y = E0x E0y sin(ωt) [ sin(ωt) cosφ + cos(ωt) sinφ ]
= E0x E0y [ sin^2(ωt) cosφ + sin(ωt) cos(ωt) sinφ ]

The average over a full period of these terms:
The average of sin^2 is 1/2, so the first term averages to (E0x E0y cosφ)/2.
The second term is (sin(2ωt) sinφ)/2, which averages to zero.
So the average of E_x E_y is (E0x E0y cosφ)/2.

Wait, but in the Poynting vector, which is E cross H, which in this case gives 2 E_x E_y / η0. But that's the instantaneous value. So when we take the average, S_avg would be (2/η0) * <E_x E_y> = (2/η0) * (E0x E0y cosφ)/2 ) = (E0x E0y cosφ ) / η0.

Hmm. But I thought the average power for elliptical polarization should depend on both Ex and Ey squared, not just their product. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the average Poynting vector for an elliptically polarized wave is (Ex² + Ey²) / (2 η0). Because for linear polarization (φ=0, and say Ex = Ey, but wait, no, in linear it's either Ex or Ey, not both with a phase shift), but for circular polarization, the average would be (Ex² + Ey²)/(2 η0). Because when you have Ex and Ey equal in amplitude and 90 degrees out of phase, the average power would be sum of each component's contribution.

Wait, for circular polarization, the average power is indeed (E_x^2 + E_y^2)/(2 η0). Because in that case, the cross terms average out, and each component contributes (E^2)/(2 η0). So for any elliptical polarization, which is a combination of two orthogonal components with any phase difference, the average power should be the sum of each component's average power. Because the cross terms (like E_x E_y) average to something, but if the phase difference isn't 0 or 180, maybe it contributes. Wait, but from the earlier calculation, when there's a phase difference, the average of E_x E_y would be non-zero only if φ is 0 or 180. Otherwise, in cases where φ is 90 degrees, the average E_x E_y would be zero. Wait no, no, let me think again.

Wait, the average of E_x E_y is (E0x E0y cosφ)/2. So if the phase difference is 90 degrees, cos(90) is zero, so the average E_x E_y is zero, and thus the average Poynting vector would be (E0x^2 + E0y^2)/(2 η0).

But in our problem, the phase difference between Ex and Ey is 75 degrees. So cos(75) is about 0.2588. So the average E_x E_y would be (3 *6 * cos(75)) / 2. Wait, so when we have a phase difference, does that term contribute to the average power?

Wait, but earlier I thought that the average Poynting vector is (E_x^2 + E_y^2 + 2 E_x E_y cosφ) / (2 η0). Because from the cross product, the S instant is proportional to E_x E_y, so when we average it, we get terms from E_x squared, E_y squared, and cross terms. So perhaps the correct formula is S_avg = (E_x^2 + E_y^2 + 2 E_x E_y cosφ) / (2 η0).

Wait no, no. Wait, the time-averaged Poynting vector is (1/2) Re(E × H*). So perhaps I should think in terms of phasors.

Let me model E as a phasor. Let E_x = E0x e^{j0}, and E_y = E0y e^{jφ}, where φ is 75 degrees or 5π/12 radians. Then, H can be written as (E × z_hat)/η0, which would be (-E_y i + E_x j)/η0. Wait, wait, maybe H is ( (E × z_hat) )/η0. So E is in x and y, z_hat is unit z. E × z_hat is (E_y, -E_x, 0). So H = (E_y i - E_x j)/η0.

So H in phasor form is (E0y e^{jφ} i - E0x e^{j0} j ) / η0.

Now, the Poynting vector S is (E × H*) / (2), where * denotes the complex conjugate. Wait, no, the time-averaged Poynting vector is (1/2) Re( E × H* ).

So E × H* would be (E0x i + E0y e^{jφ} j) × [ (E0y e^{-jφ} i - E0x j ) / η0 ]^* ?

Wait, maybe I should compute E × H*. Let me write E as [E0x, E0y e^{jφ}, 0], and H* as [ (E0y e^{-jφ})^*, (-E0x)^* ] / η0. Since η0 is real, * just applies to the complex terms.

Assuming E0x and E0y are real (which they are, 3 and 6 respectively), then H* = [ E0y e^{jφ}, -E0x, 0 ] / η0.

So E × H* would be the determinant:

|i     j        k|
|E0x  E0y e^{jφ} 0|
|E0y e^{jφ}  -E0x   0|

Calculating the determinant: i*(E0y e^{jφ} * 0 - 0*(-E0x)) - j*(E0x * 0 - 0 * E0y e^{jφ}) + k*(E0x*(-E0x) - E0y e^{jφ} * E0y e^{jφ} )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recompute:

The cross product of E and H* is:

i [ E_y H*_z - E_z H*_y ] - j [ E_x H*_z - E_z H*_x ] + k [ E_x H*_y - E_y H*_x ]

But since E_z and H*_z are zero, this simplifies to:

i [ E_y * (-E0x) / η0 ] - j [ E_x * (E0y e^{jφ}) / η0 ] + k [ E_x * (-E0x) / η0 - E_y e^{jφ} * E0y e^{jφ} / η0 ]

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick to calculating the z-component, which is the direction of propagation.

So the z-component of E × H* is:

E_x H*_y - E_y H*_x.

H*_x is (E0y e^{jφ}) / η0,

H*_y is (-E0x) / η0.

So,

E_x H*_y = E0x * (-E0x) / η0,

E_y H*_x = E0y e^{jφ} * (E0y e^{jφ}) / η0.

So the z-component is [ -E0x^2 - E0y^2 e^{j2φ} ] / η0.

Taking the real part, Re( ... ), we get:

(-E0x^2 - E0y^2 cos(2φ) ) / η0.

Then, the time-averaged Poynting vector S_avg is (1/2) times this real part. So:

S_avg_z = (1/2) * [ (-E0x^2 - E0y^2 cos(2φ) ) / η0 ].

Wait, but that gives a negative value, which doesn't make sense because power should be positive in the direction of propagation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let me recheck the cross product. E is (E0x, E0y e^{jφ}, 0), H* is (H*_x, H*_y, 0) = ( (E0y e^{jφ}) / η0, (-E0x)/ η0, 0 )

So E × H* in z-component is E_x H*_y - E_y H*_x.

Which is E0x * (-E0x / η0) - (E0y e^{jφ}) * (E0y e^{jφ} / η0 )

So:

= (-E0x^2 / η0) - (E0y^2 e^{j2φ} ) / η0.

So Re of this is (-E0x^2 / η0) - (E0y^2 cos(2φ) ) / η0.

Then, S_avg_z is (1/2) times that, so:

S_avg_z = (1/(2 η0)) [ -E0x^2 - E0y^2 cos(2φ) ].

Wait, but this is negative, which would imply power is flowing in the negative z direction, which doesn't make sense unless the wave is propagating backward. But the problem states it's propagating in the +z direction. So perhaps I made a mistake in the H calculation. Maybe H should be (E × z_hat ) / η0, so H would be ( E_y, -E_x, 0 ) / η0. So H_x = E_y / η0, H_y = -E_x / η0.

Wait, in that case, the H* would be ( E_y^* , -E_x^* ) / η0.

So if E_y has a phase φ, then E_y^* = E0y e^{-jφ}, and E_x is E0x, real, so E_x^* = E0x.

So H*_x = E0y e^{-jφ} / η0,

H*_y = -E0x / η0.

So then, E × H* in z-component is E_x H*_y - E_y H*_x.

= E0x * (-E0x / η0 ) - E0y e^{jφ} * ( E0y e^{-jφ} / η0 )

= (-E0x^2 / η0 ) - (E0y^2 / η0 ) ( e^{jφ} e^{-jφ} )

= (-E0x^2 - E0y^2 ) / η0.

The real part is just (-E0x^2 - E0y^2 ) / η0.

Then, S
