Question:

In 1976 it was mistakenly believed that the first of the 'superheavy' elements had been discovered in a sample of mica. Its atomic number  was believed to be 126.

A: 0.12 $\mathrm{pm}$
B: 0.72 $\mathrm{pm}$
C: 0.82 $\mathrm{pm}$
D: 0.22 $\mathrm{pm}$
E: 0.02 $\mathrm{pm}$
F: 0.62 $\mathrm{pm}$

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the first of the superheavy elements, right? The question is about the most probable distance of the innermost electrons from the nucleus of an atom with atomic number 126. Hmm, I remember that the innermost electrons are the 1s electrons. 

Wait, the problem says to ignore relativistic effects, which is a bit of a relief because I'm not too familiar with how those work in detail. So I can stick to the basic quantum mechanical model, probably the Bohr model since that's simpler.

In the Bohr model, the radius of the nth orbit is given by the formula r = (n² * ε₀ * h²) / (π * m * e² * Z_eff), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the most probable radius. Oh right, for the 1s orbital, the most probable radius is when the electron is closest to the nucleus. I think the formula for the most probable radius in a hydrogen-like atom is (a₀ * n²) / Z, where a₀ is the Bohr radius, about 0.529 pm, n is the principal quantum number, and Z is the atomic number.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the most probable radius for the 1s orbital in a hydrogen-like atom is actually (a₀ * n²) / Z. So for the 1s orbital, n=1, so it's a₀ / Z. But wait, I thought the Bohr radius formula is a₀ = (n² * ε₀ * h²) / (π * m * e² * Z), or something like that. Wait, maybe I should clarify.

Alternatively, I think the formula is r_mp = (n² a₀) / Z. So for n=1, r_mp = a₀ / Z. Since Z is 126, then r_mp = 0.529 pm / 126.

Let me calculate that. 0.529 divided by 126. Hmm, 0.529 / 100 is 0.00529, so 0.529/126 would be a bit less than that. Let's see, 126 times 4 is 504, so 0.529 / 126 is approximately 0.0042 pm? Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have that. Wait, did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the radius of the orbit with something else. Another approach: the effective nuclear charge Z_eff for the 1s electrons in a multi-electron atom is approximately Z - σ, where σ is the screening constant. But the question says to ignore relativistic effects, but maybe it's assuming a hydrogen-like ion, so Z_eff is just Z, because all other electrons are ignored? Or wait, for hydrogen-like, yes, Z_eff is Z.

Wait, but when the atom is neutral, the 1s electrons would have other electrons shielding them. Oh wait, but the problem says it's an atom of this element, so the atom is neutral. So maybe I should account for shielding. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a bare nucleus, like a hydrogen-like ion, but that doesn't make sense because an atom would have electrons.

Wait, but the question is about the innermost electrons. So, in a multi-electron atom, the 1s electrons are the innermost. The effective nuclear charge they experience is Z_eff = Z - σ. For 1s electrons, the shielding (σ) is approximately (Z - 1) * 0.35? Or wait, maybe for each electron shell, the shielding is calculated. Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Slater's rules for estimating Z_eff. For the 1s orbital, the electrons in the same shell contribute 0.35 each, but wait, the 1s electrons shield each other. But in Slater's rules, all electrons in higher shells contribute differently. Wait, but for the 1s electrons, the shielding comes from electrons in the same n and l or lower.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think differently. The question is about the most probable distance of the innermost electrons, which are the 1s electrons. So if I were to model this as a hydrogen-like atom, the radius would be a₀ * n² / Z, but that's assuming that the nucleus has charge +Z e. But in a neutral atom, the 1s electrons are shielded by other electrons, so Z_eff would be less than Z. So maybe I should adjust for that.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore relativistic effects, but maybe I can proceed with the simple formula. Let me think: for a hydrogen-like atom (like a He+ ion), the 1s orbital's most probable radius is a₀ / Z. For Z=126, that's 0.529 pm / 126. Let me calculate that. 0.529 divided by 126. Let's see, 0.529 / 126:

0.529 ÷ 126 = ?

Well, 126 times 0.0042 is 0.5292. Oh wait, because 0.0042 * 126 = 0.5292. So that would make the radius approximately 0.0042 pm. Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest is E: 0.02 pm, which is 0.02 pm. My calculation gives 0.0042, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. I think I might have confused the most probable radius with the expectation value or something else. Let me think again. The most probable radius for the 1s orbital in a hydrogen-like atom is indeed a₀ * n² / Z. So for n=1, it's a₀ / Z.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the general formula for the radius of the nth shell, which is r = (n² * a₀) / Z. So for n=1, Z=126, r = a₀ / 126 = 0.529 / 126 pm. Which as I calculated is approximately 0.0042 pm. But none of the options are that small. The closest is E: 0.02 pm, but that's an order of magnitude larger.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting that the Bohr radius is actually about 0.529 Ångströms, not picometers. Oh wait, no, 1 Å is 100 pm. So 0.529 Å is 52.9 pm. So I think I made a mistake here. Oh no, I think I messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, wait, no. The Bohr radius, a₀, is 0.529 Å, which is 52.9 pm. Oh! So I think I was using 0.529 pm, which is wrong. It's actually 52.9 pm. That changes everything.

So the correct calculation is 52.9 pm divided by 126. Let me compute that: 52.9 / 126. Let's see, 52.9 ÷ 126 is approximately 0.42 pm. Because 126 * 0.4 is 50.4, and 0.42 * 126 is 52.92. So yeah, 0.42 pm.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.42 pm. So the answer should be G.
</think>

To determine the most probable distance of the innermost electrons from the nucleus of an atom with atomic number 126, we focus on the 1s electrons. Using the Bohr model, the most probable radius for the 1s orbital in a hydrogen-like atom is given by:

\[
r_{\text{mp}} = \frac{a_0}{Z}
\]

where \(a_0\) is the Bohr radius (\(0.529 \, \text{Å} = 52.9 \, \text{pm}\)) and \(Z\) is the atomic number. Substituting \(Z = 126\):

\[
r_{\text{mp}} = \frac{52.9}{126} \approx 0.42 \, \text{pm}
\]

This calculation assumes a hydrogen-like approximation, where the 1s electrons are considered to experience the full nuclear charge \(Z\). While shielding effects might reduce the effective nuclear charge (\(Z_{\text{eff}}\)), the problem does not explicitly require adjustments for these effects, so the simple formula is applied.

Among the given options, the closest value to the calculated result is \(0.42 \, \text{pm}\), which corresponds to option G.
