Okay, so I've got this problem here about a car's speed. Let me read it again. The question says the car covers 30 miles in half an hour, and I need to find its speed in miles per hour and feet per second. There are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, starting with miles per hour. I remember that speed is distance divided by time. So the car went 30 miles in 0.5 hours. Wait, half an hour is 0.5 hours. So I can calculate that as 30 divided by 0.5. Let me do that: 30 / 0.5 equals 60. Oh, so the speed is 60 miles per hour. That's the first part.

Now the second part is converting that speed into feet per second. I think I need to convert miles to feet and hours to seconds. Let me jot down the conversion factors I know. One mile is 5280 feet, right? And one hour is 3600 seconds. So, I need to take the speed in miles per hour and convert it.

So, the car is going 60 miles per hour. To get feet per second, I can multiply by the number of feet in a mile and divide by the number of seconds in an hour. So the formula would be:

Speed in ft/s = (60 miles/hour) * (5280 feet/mile) / (3600 seconds/hour)

Let me compute that. First, multiply 60 by 5280. Let me see, 60 * 5280. 5280 times 60... 5280 times 6 is 31680, so 60 times is 316800. Then divide by 3600. 

Wait, maybe I can simplify the numbers before multiplying to make it easier. 60 divided by 3600 is 1/60. So 5280 * (1/60) = 5280 / 60. 5280 divided by 60 is... let me calculate that. 60 times 88 is 5280, right? Because 60*80=4800 and 60*8=480, which adds up to 5280. So 5280/60 is 88. So the speed is 88 feet per second.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Another way: 60 mph is a common speed, and I think I've heard that 60 mph is about 88 feet per second. So that makes sense.

Looking back at the options, let's see which one has 60 mph and 88 ft/s. Option I says 60 mi per hr, 88 ft per sec. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recalculate 60 * 5280 = 316800. Then 316800 / 3600 = ?

Divide both numerator and denominator by 100: 3168 / 36. Let's divide 3168 by 36. 36 times 80 is 2880, so 3168-2880 is 288. 36 times 8 is 288, so total is 80 +8=88. Yep, same as before. So 60 mph is 88 ft/s.

So the correct answer should be option I.

To determine the car's speed, we start by calculating the speed in miles per hour. The car travels 30 miles in 0.5 hours, so:

\[
\text{Speed (mph)} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{30}{0.5} = 60 \, \text{mph}.
\]

Next, we convert this speed to feet per second. Using the conversion factors \(1 \, \text{mile} = 5280 \, \text{feet}\) and \(1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds}\), the formula becomes:

\[
\text{Speed (ft/s)} = \left(60 \, \text{mph}\right) \times \left(\frac{5280 \, \text{feet}}{1 \, \text{mile}}\right) \div \left(\frac{3600 \, \text{seconds}}{1 \, \text{hour}}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{Speed (ft/s)} = \frac{60 \times 5280}{3600} = \frac{316800}{3600} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

Thus, the car's speed is \(60 \, \text{mph}\) and \(88 \, \text{ft/s}\). Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is:

**I: 60 mi per hr, 88 ft per sec.**
