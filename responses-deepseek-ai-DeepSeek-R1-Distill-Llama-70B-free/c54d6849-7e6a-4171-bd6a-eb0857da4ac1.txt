Okay, so I need to solve this genetics problem about moths and allele frequencies. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a heavily polluted area, about 87% of the moths of the species Biston betularia are melanic, meaning dark-colored. The frequency of the recessive allele is given as 0.13. I'm supposed to find the frequency of the dominant allele leading to melanism and the proportion of dark-colored moths that are heterozygous.

Hmm, wait, I remember that melanism in moths is often a case of industrial melanism, where the dark coloration offers a selective advantage in polluted areas. But I'll focus on the genetics part.

First, let's clarify the alleles involved. Let's say the dominant allele is 'B' which causes melanism, and the recessive allele is 'b', which gives the light color. So the possible genotypes are BB (homozygous dominant), Bb (heterozygous), and bb (homozygous recessive). 

Since melanism is dominant, both BB and Bb will display the dark color. The problem states that 87% of the moths are dark, so that includes both BB and Bb. The remaining 13% are light-colored, which would be bb.

Wait, wait. The question says the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13. Wait, that's the frequency of 'b'? Because if it's recessive, then the frequency is q, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele. So q is 0.13.

In a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele (B), and q is 0.13.

The proportion of the population that's homozygous recessive (bb) is q^2. So q^2 = (0.13)^2 = 0.0169, which is about 1.69%. But wait, the light-colored moths are 13%? Wait, no, the question says dark-colored are 87%, so light is 13%? Because 100% -87%=13%. But according to the question, the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13. Hmm, perhaps I need to connect these.

Wait, I think I got confused. Let me restate:

The problem says 87% of the moths are dark (so 0.87), which are BB and Bb. The light ones are 13%, which are bb. So the frequency of bb is 0.13, right? Because the question says that the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13. Or wait, wait, the frequency of the recessive allele is q, which is 0.13, so q = 0.13. Therefore, the frequency of bb is q squared, which would be 0.0169, but that's 1.69%, not 13%. That doesn't match up. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the question again. Oh wait, the question says that the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13. So the recessive allele is 'b' and q = 0.13. So the frequency of bb is q^2 = 0.0169, which is about 1.7%. But the light-colored moths are 13% of the population, which would be 0.13. That's a problem because according to Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of bb is q², which is 0.0169, but the observed is 0.13. That would be if the population isn't in HWE, but the question doesn't say that. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the 87% refers to the frequency of the dominant phenotype, which includes both BB and Bb.

Wait, the question states: 87% are melanic (dark), so the frequency of the dominant phenotype is 0.87. So the frequency of the recessive phenotype (light) is 0.13. But the frequency of the recessive allele is given as 0.13. That can't be, because allele frequency and phenotype frequency are different.

Wait, no. Maybe the 0.13 is the allele frequency, not the phenotype. So q (frequency of recessive allele) is 0.13. Then, the frequency of the recessive phenotype (bb) would be q² = 0.0169, which is about 1.69%. But the problem says that 13% are light-colored. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The first sentence says that 87% are melanic, so 87% dark. So the frequency of the dominant phenotype is 87%, which includes both BB and Bb. The frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13. So q is 0.13.

Wait, the total allele frequencies must add up to 1, so p + q =1, so p=0.87.

Wait no, that's not right. Because p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the recessive. So p + q =1.

But if q is 0.13, then p is 0.87.

Wait, if q is 0.13, then the frequency of bb (recessive phenotype) is q²=0.0169, so about 1.7%. But in the population, the recessive phenotype is 13% (since 87% are dominant). That's conflicting.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

The dark-colored moths (melanic) are 87% of the population. So the frequency of the dominant phenotype is 0.87. The frequency of the recessive allele is given as 0.13. So q=0.13.

In HWE, the frequency of the recessive phenotype (bb) is q² = 0.0169, which is about 1.7%, but according to the problem, the recessive phenotype is 13% (since 13% are light). So this is a discrepancy. Therefore, perhaps the problem is not in HWE? Or perhaps the given q is the frequency of the recessive allele in the population.

Wait, but 13% are light-colored, so their genotype is bb. So the frequency of bb is 0.13. Therefore, q² = 0.13. So q = sqrt(0.13) ≈ 0.3606. But the question says the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.13. So this contradicts.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me reevaluate.

Let me define:

Let’s denote the dominant allele as B (melanistic, dark) and the recessive as b (light).

The frequency of the recessive allele (b) is given as 0.13, so q = 0.13.

In HWE, the frequencies of the genotypes are:

- BB: p²
- Bb: 2pq
- bb: q²

But the phenotype frequencies are:

- Dark (BB and Bb): p² + 2pq
- Light (bb): q²

The question states that 87% are dark, so p² + 2pq = 0.87.

We also know that q = 0.13, so p = 1 - q = 0.87.

So plug in the values:

p = 0.87, q=0.13.

Calculate p² + 2pq:

p² = (0.87)^2 ≈ 0.7569.

2pq = 2 * 0.87 * 0.13 ≈ 2 * 0.1131 ≈ 0.2262.

So p² + 2pq ≈ 0.7569 + 0.2262 ≈ 0.9831, which is about 98.31%. But the problem says dark-colored are 87%, which is 0.87. So this doesn't match. Therefore, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a minute, perhaps the given 0.13 is not the frequency of the recessive allele, but the frequency of the recessive phenotype. No, the question says the frequency of the recessive is 0.13.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the phenotype and genotype. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 87% is the frequency of the dominant phenotype, which is BB and Bb. So the sum p² + 2pq = 0.87.

Given that, and the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.13, can we find p?

Wait, no, because if q is 0.13, then p is 0.87 as before. So plugging into p² + 2pq, as I did earlier, gives about 0.9831, which is higher than the given 0.87. So that's not matching. Therefore, perhaps the given q is not the recessive allele frequency, but the recessive phenotype frequency. But the question says the frequency of the recessive is 0.13, which would be the allele. So there's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's let q be the frequency of the recessive allele. So q = 0.13.

The frequency of the recessive phenotype (bb) is q² = 0.0169, as before. But the question says that the recessive phenotype is 13%, which is 0.13. So 0.13 = q², which would mean q = sqrt(0.13) ≈ 0.3606. But the question says q is 0.13. So this doesn't add up. Therefore, perhaps I misinterpreted the question.

Wait, let me reread the question to make sure.

"In a heavily polluted industrialized area in England about 87 percent of the moths of the species Biston betularia are melanic (dark colored). If the frequency of recessives is 0.13, what is the frequency of the dominant allele leading to melanism? What proportion of the dark colored moths are heterozygous?"

Ah, maybe "frequency of recessives" refers to the frequency of the recessive phenotype, not the allele. So the frequency of the recessive phenotype is 13% (0.13), which is bb. So q² = 0.13 → q = sqrt(0.13) ≈ 0.3606. Then the frequency of the dominant allele p would be 1 - q ≈ 0.6394.

Wait, that makes more sense. So if the recessive phenotype is 13%, then q²=0.13 → q≈0.3606.

So p = 1 - 0.3606 ≈ 0.6394.

But the question says "the frequency of recessives is 0.13". Hmm, "recessives" could refer to the allele, but perhaps in this context, it refers to the phenotype.

Wait, let's clarify:

In genetics terminology, "recessive" can refer to either the allele or the phenotype. But generally, when the question says "frequency of recessives", it's more likely referring to the allele. So if the problem says the frequency of recessive allele is 0.13, then q=0.13. But that leads to a problem because the phenotype frequency for recessive would be q²=0.0169, but the question says that 13% are recessive (light), which is 0.13.

So perhaps the question is using "recessives" to refer to the phenotype, not the allele. So the frequency of the recessive phenotype (bb) is 0.13.

In that case, q²=0.13 → q≈0.3606. Then p=1 - q ≈0.6394.

Wait, but the first part of the question asks for the frequency of the dominant allele leading to melanism, which is p, so that would be approximately 0.64.

Now, the second part: what proportion of the dark-colored moths are heterozygous?

The dark-colored moths are BB and Bb. So their total frequency is 0.87 (since 13% are light). So the proportion of dark moths that are heterozygous is (number of Bb) / (number of BB + Bb).

Number of Bb is 2pq. Number of BB is p².

So proportion heterozygous = (2pq) / (p² + 2pq) ) × 100%.

We have p ≈ 0.6394, q ≈ 0.3606.

Calculate 2pq:

2 * 0.6394 * 0.3606 ≈ 2 * 0.2305 ≈ 0.461.

p² is (0.6394)^2 ≈ 0.4089.

p² + 2pq ≈ 0.4089 + 0.461 ≈ 0.8699, which is close to 0.87, which matches the given data.

So the proportion of dark moths that are heterozygous is 0.461 / 0.8699 ≈ 0.5297, approximately 53%.

So the dominant allele frequency is approximately 0.64, and the proportion of dark moths that are heterozygous is about 53%.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 0.64, 0.53 or 53%

That matches.

So the answer should be E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the allele and genotype frequencies of the moth population using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principles. The question specifies that 87% of the moths are melanic (dark-colored), which corresponds to the dominant phenotype (BB and Bb). The remaining 13% are light-colored, which corresponds to the recessive phenotype (bb). The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is given as 0.13.

### Step 1: Calculate the frequency of the dominant allele (p)
The relationship between allele frequencies is given by:

\[
p + q = 1
\]

Substituting \( q = 0.13 \):

\[
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.13 = 0.87
\]

Thus, the frequency of the dominant allele (B) is \( p = 0.87 \).

---

### Step 2: Verify the proportion of dark-colored moths
The frequency of the dominant phenotype (dark-colored moths) is the sum of the homozygous dominant (BB) and heterozygous (Bb) genotypes:

\[
\text{Frequency of dark-colored moths} = p^2 + 2pq
\]

Substituting \( p = 0.87 \) and \( q = 0.13 \):

\[
p^2 = (0.87)^2 = 0.7569, \quad 2pq = 2(0.87)(0.13) = 0.2262
\]

\[
p^2 + 2pq = 0.7569 + 0.2262 = 0.9831
\]

This result (98.31%) does not match the given 87% for dark-colored moths, indicating a potential misinterpretation of the question. Reassessing, if the frequency of the recessive phenotype (bb) is 13% (\( q^2 = 0.13 \)), then:

\[
q = \sqrt{0.13} \approx 0.3606
\]

Thus, the frequency of the dominant allele is:

\[
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.3606 = 0.6394
\]

---

### Step 3: Proportion of dark-colored moths that are heterozygous
The proportion of heterozygous (Bb) moths among all dark-colored moths is:

\[
\text{Proportion heterozygous} = \frac{2pq}{p^2 + 2pq}
\]

Substituting \( p = 0.6394 \) and \( q = 0.3606 \):

\[
2pq = 2(0.6394)(0.3606) = 0.461, \quad p^2 = (0.6394)^2 = 0.4089
\]

\[
p^2 + 2pq = 0.4089 + 0.461 = 0.8699
\]

\[
\text{Proportion heterozygous} = \frac{0.461}{0.8699} \approx 0.5297 \, \text{or} \, 53\%
\]

---

### Final Answer
The frequency of the dominant allele leading to melanism is approximately \( 0.64 \), and the proportion of dark-colored moths that are heterozygous is approximately \( 53\% \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**E: 0.64, 0.53 or 53%**
