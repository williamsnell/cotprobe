Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of propane at 25°C and 1 atm. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy changes are related to bond energies and maybe the heat of vaporization. Let me think through this step by step.

The question provides a table of bond energies and some other data. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants and products. Oh wait, the problem states that the enthalpy of solid carbon and hydrogen gas is zero at 25°C and 1 atm. So I'm guessing I need to calculate the enthalpy change when propane is formed from its elements.

Propane is C3H8. So the formation reaction would be:
3 C(s) + 4 H2(g) → C3H8(g)

Wait, but wait. The question is about the enthalpy of propane under these conditions. So perhaps I'm to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of propane. Right, because the standard enthalpy of formation is the change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

The bond energies are given in the table. So I need to calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the products form.

So for the reactants:
- Solid carbon (C(s)) has a certain structure. But I think in this context, since the enthalpy of C(s) is taken as zero, we're focusing on the bonds in the hydrogen molecules and the carbon atoms. Wait, no, solid carbon exists as a network of C-C bonds, like in graphite. Oh wait, but the problem says the enthalpy of solid carbon is zero. Hmm, maybe I don't need to break any bonds for the solid carbon because it's considered in its standard state. Wait, no, actually, when you form propane from solid carbon and H2, you have to break the bonds in the reactants to form the bonds in the products.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using bond dissociation energies. The method is: sum the bond energies of the reactants (which are broken, so energy is absorbed) and subtract the bond energies of the products (which are formed, releasing energy). So the enthalpy change is the sum of reactant bonds broken minus the sum of product bonds formed.

Wait, no, the formula is ΔH = sum(bond energies of reactants) - sum(bond energies of products). Because breaking bonds requires energy (positive) and forming bonds releases energy (negative). So the overall enthalpy change is the energy needed to break the reactant bonds minus the energy gained by forming product bonds.

But wait, in the reaction, the reactants are solid carbon and H2 gas. So the solid carbon is in a crystalline structure with C-C bonds. To form propane, each carbon atom in the solid has to break its bonds. But wait, the problem says we can assume the enthalpy of solid carbon is zero. Hmmm, maybe that means we don't have to account for the C(s) bonds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the bond energy for C(s) is the same as the C-C bond, which is given as 83.1 kcal/mol. Wait, but solid carbon is a network solid with each C bonded to four others, but I think for the purpose of this calculation, the bond energy for C(s) is considered as the energy per mole of C-C bonds.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the formation of propane from its elements.

The reaction is 3 C(s) + 4 H2(g) → C3H8(g)

The bonds in the reactants are the C-C bonds in solid carbon and the H-H bonds in H2. The bonds in the products are the C-C and C-H bonds in propane.

Wait, but solid carbon is in a different state. So, perhaps when we break up the solid carbon to form propane, we're breaking the C-C bonds in the solid. But wait, solid carbon's enthalpy is taken as zero, which might mean that the energy required to break those bonds is part of the enthalpy calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation ignores the C(s) bonds because their enthalpy is zero. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For elements, their standard state is their most stable form at 25°C and 1 atm. For carbon, that's solid graphite. So solid carbon is already in its standard state, and its ΔHf° is zero. Similarly, H2 gas is in its standard state, ΔHf° is zero.

So to form propane, we have to break the bonds in the reactants (which are the C-C in solid carbon and the H-H in H2) and form the bonds in propane.

Wait, but solid carbon is a network of C-C bonds. So to get individual C atoms, we need to break all those C-C bonds. But wait, for 3 moles of C(s), how many C-C bonds are broken?

Hmm, each mole of C(s) is a network, so each mole would involve multiple C-C bonds. Wait, perhaps the calculation uses the bond energy of C(s) as the energy needed per mole to convert solid carbon to gaseous carbon atoms. Because in the table, there's a line: "The heat of vaporization for carbon(s) to carbon(g) = 171.70 kcal/mole." Oh! So that's the energy required to turn solid carbon into gaseous carbon atoms. So that's the value we'll use for the C(s).

So the process is:

1. Take 3 moles of solid carbon (C(s)) and convert them to gaseous carbon atoms (C(g)). The energy required for this is 3 × 171.70 kcal/mol, because each mole of C(s) requires 171.70 kcal to become C(g).

2. Then, take 4 moles of H2(g) and break them into 8 moles of H(g). Each H2 has a bond energy of 104.2 kcal/mol, so for 4 moles, it's 4 × 104.2 kcal.

3. Now, we have 3 moles of C(g) and 8 moles of H(g). These will form propane (C3H8), which involves forming the bonds in propane.

Each molecule of C3H8 has:

- 2 C-C single bonds (so 2 × 83.1 kcal/mol per bond)
- 8 C-H single bonds (8 × 98.8 kcal/mol per bond)

Wait, wait. Let me check the structure of propane. Propane is CH3-CH2-CH3. So each molecule has two C-C single bonds (between the three carbons) and 8 C-H bonds (each CH3 has 3 H's, and the CH2 has 2 H's, but no, wait, each C in propane has 3 H's except the middle one, which has 2. Wait no, propane is C3H8: each of the two end carbons has 3 H's, and the middle has 2. So total of 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 H's. So each molecule has two C-C bonds and eight C-H bonds.

Wait, but when calculating the bond energies, each bond is counted per molecule. So for each molecule of propane, the bonds are:

- 2 C-C bonds (each at 83.1)
- 8 C-H bonds (each at 98.8)

So the total bond energy for one mole of propane is (2 × 83.1) + (8 × 98.8) kcal/mol.

But wait, the process of forming the bonds releases energy, so that's negative in the enthalpy calculation. Wait no, the formula is sum of reactant bond energies (broken, so positive) minus sum of product bond energies (formed, so negative). So the overall ΔH would be [energy for breaking bonds] - [energy for forming bonds].

Wait, let me structure this:

ΔH = [sum of bond energies in reactants] - [sum of bond energies in products]

But wait, no: the correct formula is:

ΔH (in kcal/mol) = (sum of bond energies of reactants broken) - (sum of bond energies of products formed)

Because breaking bonds requires energy (positive), and forming bonds releases energy (negative), so the overall enthalpy is the energy put in minus the energy released.

So let's calculate each part.

First, the reactants: 3 C(s) and 4 H2(g)

For C(s) → C(g): each mole requires 171.70 kcal, so 3 moles → 3 × 171.70 = 515.1 kcal.

For H2(g): each mole has a bond energy of 104.2 kcal/mol. So 4 moles → 4 × 104.2 = 416.8 kcal.

So the total energy needed to break the reactant bonds is 515.1 + 416.8 = 931.9 kcal.

Now the products: C3H8(g)

Each mole of propane has:

2 C-C bonds: 2 × 83.1 = 166.2 kcal
8 C-H bonds: 8 × 98.8 = 790.4 kcal
Total bond energy per mole: 166.2 + 790.4 = 956.6 kcal.

So the energy released when forming the bonds is 956.6 kcal.

Now, the overall ΔH is (931.9) - (956.6) = -24.7 kcal.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the enthalpy of propane at 25°C and 1 atm. So is this the standard enthalpy of formation of propane?

Yes, because the reaction is:

3 C(s) + 4 H2(g) → C3H8(g)

And the ΔHf° of propane is -24.7 kcal/mol according to this calculation.

Looking at the options, option G is -24.7 kcal. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating the reactant bond breaking:

3 C(s) → 3 C(g): 3 × 171.70 = 515.1 kcal.

4 H2 → 8 H: 4 × 104.2 = 416.8 kcal.

Total = 515.1 + 416.8 = 931.9 kcal.

Product bonds:

Propane has 2 C-C and 8 C-H bonds.

2 × 83.1 = 166.2

8 × 98.8 = 790.4

Total = 956.6 kcal.

ΔH = 931.9 - 956.6 = -24.7 kcal.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the correct answer is option G: -24.7 kcal.
</think>

To calculate the enthalpy of propane (C₃H₈) at 25°C and 1 atm, we use the bond energy data provided and the heat of vaporization for carbon(s) to carbon(g). The reaction for the formation of propane from its elements is:

\[
3 \, \text{C(s)} + 4 \, \text{H}_2\text{(g)} \rightarrow \text{C}_3\text{H}_8\text{(g)}
\]

### Step 1: Energy required to break bonds in reactants
1. **Solid carbon (C(s))**: To convert 3 moles of solid carbon to gaseous carbon atoms, the energy required is:
   \[
   3 \times 171.70 \, \text{kcal/mol} = 515.10 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

2. **Hydrogen gas (H₂)**: Breaking 4 moles of H-H bonds (1 bond per H₂ molecule) requires:
   \[
   4 \times 104.2 \, \text{kcal/mol} = 416.80 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

   Total energy required to break reactant bonds:
   \[
   515.10 + 416.80 = 931.90 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

### Step 2: Energy released from forming bonds in products
Propane (C₃H₈) has the following bonds:
1. **C-C bonds**: 2 bonds × 83.1 kcal/mol = 166.2 kcal.
2. **C-H bonds**: 8 bonds × 98.8 kcal/mol = 790.4 kcal.

   Total energy released from forming bonds in propane:
   \[
   166.2 + 790.4 = 956.6 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change
The enthalpy change (ΔH) is the energy required to break reactant bonds minus the energy released from forming product bonds:
\[
\Delta H = 931.90 - 956.60 = -24.70 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Final Answer
The enthalpy of propane at 25°C and 1 atm is **-24.7 kcal**, which corresponds to option **G**.
