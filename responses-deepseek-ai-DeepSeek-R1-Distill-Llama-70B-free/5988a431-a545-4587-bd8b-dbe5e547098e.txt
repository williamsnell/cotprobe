Okay, I have this economics problem here about a monopolist's profit with and without price discrimination. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

So, the problem says that the quantity and price are as follows:

Quantity: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Price: $109, $105, $100, $96, $91

And it's given that the total costs at the optimal output of 5 units are $405. 

Part a asks how much profit the monopolist will earn without price discrimination. Part b asks about the potential profit with price discrimination.

First, I think I need to find the total revenue and subtract the total costs to get the profit. But wait, for part a, it's about the optimal output, which is 5 units. So without price discrimination, the monopolist would produce where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, but here they're assuming the optimal output is 5 units, so maybe we don't have to calculate MR and MC.

Looking at the price at 5 units, which is $91. So if they sell 5 units at $91 each, total revenue would be 5 * 91. Let me calculate that: 5 * 90 is 450, and 5 *1 is 5, so total is $455. 

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Because the price for each unit isn't necessarily the same. Oh no, wait, in a monopoly without price discrimination, the firm charges a single price for all units. So the total revenue is the price times quantity. So at 5 units, the price is $91, so TR is 5 * 91 = $455.

Then, total cost is given as $405. So profit is TR - TC = 455 - 405 = $50. So the answer to part a is $50.

Now part b is about profit with price discrimination. I think this refers to first-degree price discrimination, where the monopolist can charge each consumer their maximum willingness to pay. So in that case, they would capture all consumer surplus.

Looking at the prices, maybe each unit is sold at a different price. So for each unit, the price is as listed. So for 1 unit, price is 109, for 2nd unit, 105, and so on up to 5 units.

If that's the case, then total revenue would be the sum of each price multiplied by the quantity. Wait, no, because with price discrimination, each unit can be sold at a different price. So for each unit, the revenue is the price for that unit. So total revenue would be 109 + 105 + 100 + 96 + 91.

Let me calculate that: 109 + 105 is 214, plus 100 is 314, plus 96 is 410, plus 91 is 501. So TR is $501.

Then, total cost is $405, so profit is 501 - 405 = $96. So part b is $96.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find an option where a is $50 and b is $96. Let's check the options:

Options:

A: $70 and $110 → No.
B: $40 and $85 → No.
C: $60 and $100 → No.
D: $50 and $96 → Yes.
E: $30 and $75 → No.
F: $45 and $90 → No.
G: $65 and $105 → No.
H: $55 and $95 → No.
I: $75 and $115 → No.
J: $80 and $120 → No.

So the correct option is D: $50 and $96.

To determine the monopolist's profit without and with price discrimination, we analyze the given data:

### Part (a): Profit without Price Discrimination
- The optimal output is 5 units, and the price at this quantity is $91.
- Total Revenue (TR) = Price × Quantity = $91 × 5 = $455.
- Total Cost (TC) is given as $405.
- Profit = TR - TC = $455 - $405 = **$50**.

### Part (b): Profit with Price Discrimination
- With first-degree price discrimination, the monopolist can charge the maximum willingness to pay for each unit.
- Total Revenue (TR) is the sum of the prices for each unit:  
  TR = $109 + $105 + $100 + $96 + $91 = **$501**.
- Profit = TR - TC = $501 - $405 = **$96**.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **D: $50 and $96**.
