Question:

Which one of the following is the most appropriate definition of a 99% confidence interval?

Options:

A: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the estimated value of the null hypothesis
B: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would be different from the estimated value of the parameter
C: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will not be rejected when it was false
D: 1% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would not contain the true value of the parameter
E: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the true value of the null hypothesis
F: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will be accepted when it was false
G: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will be rejected
H: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the estimated value of the parameter
I: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the true value of the parameter
J: 99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would not contain the true value of the null hypothesis

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about confidence intervals, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the definition of a 99% confidence interval. I remember that confidence intervals are related to how often, if we were to take multiple samples, the interval would contain the true parameter value. But wait, let me get this straight.

So, confidence intervals are constructed from sample statistics, and they give a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to lie. The percentage, in this case, 99%, is the confidence level. I think that means that if we took many samples and built a confidence interval each time, 99% of them would include the true parameter value. But I'm not entirely sure, so I need to go through the options carefully.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the estimated value of the null hypothesis." Hmm, the estimated value of the null hypothesis? Wait, the null hypothesis is about a specific value, not an estimate. Plus, confidence intervals are about containing the true parameter, not the null hypothesis estimate. So maybe A is mixing things up.

Option B: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would be different from the estimated value of the parameter." That doesn't sound right. The interval being different doesn't directly relate to the confidence level. It's more about whether the interval includes the true value, not whether it's different each time.

Option C: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will not be rejected when it was false." Wait, that's more about Type I errors and power, not confidence intervals. The confidence interval relates to estimation, not hypothesis testing directly. So maybe C is about something else, like statistical power.

Option D: "1% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would not contain the true value of the parameter." Oh, wait. A 99% confidence interval implies that 1% of the time, the interval doesn't contain the true value. Because 99% confidence means that 99% of intervals do contain it, so 1% don't. So D is a correct statement, but is it the definition? The question is about what the confidence interval is, not what is outside of it. So D describes the alpha level (since 1% is alpha for 99% confidence), but the definition of the CI is about the 99% part. So D is a consequence but not the definition.

Option E: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the true value of the null hypothesis." Again, this seems to mix up the null hypothesis with the parameter. The confidence interval is about the parameter, not the null hypothesis's value. Unless the null hypothesis is that the parameter equals a specific value. But I think E is incorrect because it's conflating concepts.

Option F: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will be accepted when it was false." That's about Type II errors and the power of a test, not confidence intervals. So F is not the right choice.

Option G: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the null hypothesis will be rejected." That's about the power again. If the null is false, how often you reject it. Doesn't relate to confidence intervals, which are about estimating the parameter, not testing hypotheses.

Option H: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the estimated value of the parameter." Wait, the estimated value is from the sample. The confidence interval is built around that estimate, so of course it contains the estimate. But that's not what a confidence interval is about. It's about containing the true value, not the estimate. So H seems incorrect because it's trivial—every interval includes the estimate used to build it.

Option I: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would contain the true value of the parameter." This sounds familiar. Yes, this matches what I was thinking earlier. The confidence interval's definition is that across many samples, 99% of the intervals would include the true parameter value. So I is looking correct.

Option J: "99% of the time in repeated samples, the interval would not contain the true value of the null hypothesis." Again, mixing up the null hypothesis and the parameter. Plus, 99% not containing doesn't make sense—it's the opposite of what a confidence interval is.

Putting it all together, the correct definition is option I: 99% of the time, the interval contains the true parameter value.

The question asks for the most appropriate definition of a 99% confidence interval. A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to lie, based on the sample data. The confidence level (99% in this case) indicates that if multiple samples were taken and a confidence interval constructed for each, 99% of these intervals would contain the true parameter value.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. It refers to containing the "estimated value of the null hypothesis," which is not relevant to the definition of a confidence interval.
- **B**: Incorrect. It focuses on the interval being "different from the estimated value of the parameter," which does not relate to the definition of a confidence interval.
- **C**: Incorrect. This describes a concept related to hypothesis testing (Type II errors), not confidence intervals.
- **D**: Partially correct but not the definition. It states that 1% of the time, the interval would not contain the true value, which is true but does not define the confidence interval.
- **E**: Incorrect. It conflates the null hypothesis with the parameter, which is not the focus of a confidence interval.
- **F**: Incorrect. This describes Type II errors in hypothesis testing, not confidence intervals.
- **G**: Incorrect. This refers to rejecting the null hypothesis, which is unrelated to confidence intervals.
- **H**: Incorrect. While the interval always contains the estimated value, this is trivial and not the definition of a confidence interval.
- **I**: Correct. This accurately describes the definition of a 99% confidence interval: 99% of the time, the interval contains the true value of the parameter.
- **J**: Incorrect. It incorrectly refers to the null hypothesis and states the opposite of what a confidence interval represents.

The correct answer is **I**, as it directly aligns with the definition of a 99% confidence interval.
