Question:

A lumber mill contracted to deliver one thousand8-foot sheets of plywood to a home improvement store on the first of each month for 10 consecutive months starting June 1. The June, July, and August shipments were delivered on time and duly paid for. Then, on August 16, the lumber mill informed the store that the mill would not be able to meet the September 1 delivery date, because its lumber reserve had been destroyed by a forest fire. The mill then asked the store to excuse the mill from further performance. The store refused and demanded that the remaining shipments be delivered on time. When the September shipment failed to arrive, the store immediately brought suit for breach of contract. How would the court hold?

Options:

A: Judgment for the store, because the mill failed to have a contingency plan in place.
B: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by impossibility.
C: Judgment for the store, because the mill should have foreseen such a contingency occurring.
D: Judgment for the store, because the mill's duties of performance would not be excused.
E: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire caused an unforeseeable hindrance in performance.
F: Judgment for the mill, because their performance would be discharged by frustration of purpose.
G: Judgment for the mill, because the forest fire was an act of God and beyond their control.
H: Judgment for the store, because the mill had a contractual obligation to deliver the goods.
I: Judgment for the mill, because they had informed the store about the issue in advance.
J: Judgment for the store, because the mill could have sourced lumber from another location.

Okay, so I have this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a lumber mill that contracted to deliver plywood to a home improvement store. The delivery is supposed to happen on the first of each month for 10 months starting June 1. So that's June, July, August, September, October, November, December, January, February, March. 

The first three months (June, July, August) went smoothly. But then on August 16, the mill tells the store that they can't meet the September 1 delivery because their lumber reserve was destroyed by a forest fire. They asked to be excused from further performance, but the store refused and demanded the shipments as scheduled. When September's shipment didn't arrive, the store sued for breach.

So the question is about whether the court will rule in favor of the store or the mill. The options are from A to J, each giving different reasons.

I remember that contract law has certain doctrines that can discharge a party's obligations. One of them is impossibility of performance. Another is frustration of purpose, and maybe act of God. Let me think about the differences.

Impossibility of performance typically applies when the subject matter of the contract is destroyed or becomes impossible to perform due to unforeseen circumstances. For example, if a house is destroyed before a sale, the seller can't deliver, so the contract is discharged. But this usually requires that the destruction wasn't the fault of the party and was unforeseeable.

Frustration of purpose is a bit different. It's when the purpose of the contract is frustrated by an event, but the performance itself isn't impossible. Like if you rent a space for a concert, and the performer dies, making the purpose of the contract (the concert) impossible. But the actual task (providing the space) is still possible.

In this case, the mill's lumber reserve was destroyed by a forest fire. That seems like it would make their performance impossible because they can't get the materials needed. So the question is whether the mill can claim impossibility.

Wait, but the contract is for delivering plywood. If their reserve is destroyed, can they get plywood from somewhere else? Like, maybe they could buy it from another supplier. If they could reasonably do that, then the impossibility defense might not hold because they could have sourced the materials elsewhere.

But if the forest fire destroyed their own reserve, but other sources are available, then it's not impossible. It might just be more expensive, but that's a different issue. Unless the contract specified that the plywood had to come from their own reserve, which I don't think it does. So the mill might be expected to find alternative sources.

So the key here is whether the event (forest fire destroying their reserve) makes it impossible for them to perform the contract. If they can get the plywood elsewhere, then it's not impossible, just perhaps more costly, which doesn't excuse performance. Impossibility requires that performance is truly impossible, not just more difficult or expensive.

Another angle: was the forest fire an act of God? Well, yes, forest fires are natural disasters, so it's an act of God. But in contract law, act of God is often tied to the impossibility doctrine. So if the event makes performance impossible, then it's a valid defense.

However, if the mill could have reasonably foreseen the possibility of a forest fire and had a contingency plan, like having alternative suppliers, then they might not be excused. Because if they could have planned for it, the impossibility defense might not apply.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Judgment for the mill because performance is discharged by impossibility. This would be correct if the fire made it impossible for them to deliver, but only if they couldn't get the plywood elsewhere.

Option E: Mill discharged because forest fire caused unforeseeable hindrance. This sounds like impossibility but depends on foreseeability.

Option G: Mill discharged because act of God. This is similar to B and E.

Option J: Store wins because mill could have sourced elsewhere. If the mill had other options, then impossibility doesn't apply.

So the question is whether the forest fire made it impossible for the mill to perform, considering whether they could obtain plywood from another source. If they could, then they can't claim impossibility. If they couldn't, then they can.

In real-life contracts, especially for goods, the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) applies. Under the UCC, a seller is excused if performance becomes impossible due to unforeseen events, but if they can get the goods from another source, they must do so. So here, if the mill's own supply is destroyed, but plywood is available elsewhere, the mill is expected to procure it from another source. So their failure to do so would be a breach.

So in this case, the court would likely rule for the store because the mill could have sourced plywood from another location. Therefore, the mill's duty wasn't excused.

Looking at the options, option J says exactly that: Judgment for the store because the mill could have sourced lumber from another location.

Wait, but what if the contract required the plywood to come from their specific reserve? Then they couldn't get it elsewhere, but the question doesn't specify that. So without such a term, the seller is expected to deliver the goods, even if it's from another source.

So the correct answer is J.

The question revolves around a contract where a lumber mill agreed to deliver plywood to a home improvement store for 10 consecutive months. The mill failed to deliver the September shipment due to a forest fire destroying its lumber reserve and sought to be excused from further performance. The store refused and sued for breach of contract. The key issue is whether the mill's performance is excused due to impossibility or whether the store is entitled to judgment.

Under contract law, the doctrine of impossibility applies when an unforeseen event destroys the subject matter of the contract or makes performance objectively impossible. However, if the party can reasonably obtain the goods from another source, they are expected to do so, and impossibility does not excuse performance. In this case, the forest fire destroyed the mill's reserve, but plywood is a fungible good that could likely be sourced from another supplier. Therefore, the mill's inability to deliver does not qualify as true impossibility, as it could have procured the plywood elsewhere.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the forest fire caused a hindrance, the mill could have sourced plywood from another location, so impossibility does not apply.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The forest fire was unforeseeable, but the mill's duty to perform was not excused because it could have obtained the goods elsewhere.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the forest fire was an act of God, this does not excuse performance if the mill could have sourced the plywood from another location.
- **Option J**: Correct. The mill could have sourced plywood from another location, so its performance was not excused, and the store is entitled to judgment.

Thus, the court would likely rule in favor of the store because the mill could have sourced lumber from another location, making its failure to perform a breach of contract.
