Okay, so I've got this question about the three-box model of information processing, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, I think the three-box model refers to the structure of memory, right? From what I remember in psychology, there are three main stages: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. 

The question is asking where memories are first stored. So the first place would probably be the initial stage where information comes in. I believe sensory memory is the very first storage. It's like when you see something, it's briefly stored in sensory memory before it's processed further.

Wait, let me think again. Sensory memory holds information from our senses for a very short time, like a fraction of a second. Then, if we pay attention to it, it moves to short-term memory. So yes, the first place should be sensory memory.

Looking at the options, option B is sensory memory. So the answer should be B.

The first place memories are stored in the three-box information processing model is **sensory memory**. This is where information from our senses is briefly held before being processed further.

Answer: B
