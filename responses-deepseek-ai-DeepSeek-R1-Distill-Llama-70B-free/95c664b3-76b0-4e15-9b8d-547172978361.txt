Okay, so I'm looking at this multiple-choice question about viruses and the cell theory. Hmm, the question is asking why viruses are considered an exception to the cell theory. I remember that the cell theory has a few main points, right? Like all organisms are made up of one or more cells, cells are the basic units of life, and new cells come from existing ones.

Wait, but viruses aren't considered cells. They're these tiny particles that can't reproduce on their own. So the cell theory says that all life is cellular, but viruses aren't cells. That must be why they're an exception.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one explains this. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Have evolved from ancestral protists. I don't think that's the main reason. Evolution from other organisms doesn't directly relate to the cell theory exception.

Option B: Are smaller than bacteria. Size isn't the key point here. It's more about structure than size.

Option C: Are not independent organisms. Well, viruses can't function on their own; they need a host. But why does that break the cell theory? Because the cell theory states that cells are the basic units. If viruses aren't cells and can't live alone, maybe this is the point.

Option D: Are immune to most antiviral drugs. That's about treatment, not their structure or classification.

Option E: Can reproduce without a host cell. Wait, no, viruses can't reproduce without a host. They need the host's machinery. So this option is incorrect.

Option F: Can photosynthesize. No, viruses don't do that. Only some bacteria and plants.

Option G: Have only a few genes. That's true, but how does that relate to the cell theory? The cell theory isn't about the number of genes.

Option H: Move about via their tails. Some viruses have tails, like bacteriophages, but that's about structure, not why they're exceptions.

Option I: Can be killed by antibiotics. Antibiotics target bacteria, not viruses, so this is incorrect.

Option J: Do not contain both DNA and RNA. Wait, viruses have either DNA or RNA, not both. But how does that affect the cell theory? I'm not sure.

Wait, the main point is that viruses aren't made of cells. So the cell theory says all life is cellular, but viruses aren't. So the reason is that they aren't cells and can't live on their own.

Looking back, option C says they are not independent organisms. Because they can't carry out life processes without a host cell. So the cell theory requires cells as the basic unit, and viruses don't fit because they aren't cells and can't exist independently. So option C is the correct answer.

The cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, cells are the basic units of life, and new cells arise from existing ones. Viruses are exceptions to this theory because they are not cellular organisms. They cannot function or reproduce independently and require a host cell to survive and replicate. Among the options provided, the most relevant reason is that viruses are not independent organisms, as they rely entirely on their host for essential life processes. This directly violates the cell theory's assertion that cells are the fundamental units of life.

Answer: C
