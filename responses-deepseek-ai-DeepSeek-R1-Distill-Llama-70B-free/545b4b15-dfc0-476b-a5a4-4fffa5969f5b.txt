Question:

Which of the following sequences of events is consistent with the presence of a layer of sandstone in bedrock just above a layer of shale?

Options:

A: One-celled organisms developed a colony on the seafloor. Shells made by these organisms accumulated and lithified, forming the sandstone.
B: A meteorite impact created a crater. The impact pulverized rock into sand-sized particles that later lithified into sandstone.
C: A forest grew, died, and decayed on top of a layer of shale. The organic material transformed into sandstone over time.
D: The water level of a large lake lowered. A beach then formed where previously there had been lake bottom.
E: Mud was deposited and lithified. Subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone.
F: A volcano erupted, sending lava out over a layer of shale. The lava cooled and hardened into sandstone.
G: A river carried silt and clay that settled over a layer of shale. Over time, this material compacted into sandstone.
H: Tectonic activity pushed sandstone rock from deep within the Earth's surface to just above a layer of shale.

Okay, so I've got this geology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it carefully. The question is about the sequence of events that leads to a layer of sandstone being on top of shale in bedrock. Alright, I remember that sandstone and shale are both sedimentary rocks, but they form from different materials.

Wait, what's the difference between sandstone and shale? Oh right, sandstone is made from sand-sized particles, like sand grains, whereas shale comes from silt and clay, which are much finer. So the question is about how sand ends up on top of shale.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: One-celled organisms forming a colony on the seafloor. Their shells accumulate and form sandstone. Hmm, shells would more likely form something like limestone, not sandstone. Unless these are siliceous shells, maybe from diatoms or something. But I'm not sure. Also, sandstone from shellsâ€”maybe, but I don't think that's the main way sandstone forms. Probably not the right answer.

Option B: A meteorite impact creating a crater and pulverizing rock into sand-sized particles. Oh, meteorites can definitely pulverize rock into fragments. Those fragments could then be compressed into sandstone. But does that explain the layering? I mean, meteorite impacts are rare, but if it happened, the debris could settle and lithify. So this could be a possibility. But I need to think more about the other options.

Option C: A forest growing, dying, and decaying on shale. The organic material turning into sandstone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Organic material usually forms coal or something, not sandstone. Sandstone is mineral-based, not organic. So this option doesn't seem right.

Option D: Water level lowering in a lake, forming a beach where there was lake bottom. That makes sense because when a lake dries up or the water level drops, the area that was underwater becomes a beach. On a beach, you get sand deposits. So the sand could then lithify into sandstone. But wait, the question is about the sandstone being above shale. So if the beach formed over a shale layer, maybe. But how does the beach form directly on top of the shale?

Hmm, perhaps the lake was over shale, and as the water level lowered, sand collected on the new beach area, which is now above the shale. That could work. I'll keep this in mind.

Option E: Mud deposited and lithified into shale, then contact metamorphism turns it into sandstone. Wait, contact metamorphism is when rocks are altered by heat from magma. But does that turn shale into sandstone? I thought metamorphism of shale would create something like slate, not sandstone. Sandstone is sedimentary, so maybe if the shale was metamorphosed, but I don't think it becomes sandstone. So probably E is incorrect.

Option F: Volcano erupting, lava over shale, cooling into sandstone. Wait, lava cools into igneous rock, like basalt or something, not sedimentary like sandstone. So F doesn't make sense. Sandstone is formed from sediments, not from lava.

Option G: River carrying silt and clay settling over shale, then compacting into sandstone. Oh wait, silt and clay would form shale, not sandstone. Because sandstone is from sand. So if the river carried silt and clay, that would make more layers of shale or maybe mudstone. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H: Tectonic activity pushing sandstone from deep Earth above shale. But sandstone is a sedimentary rock, so it's formed at the surface, not deep within. Tectonic activity can push rock layers up, but the sandstone would have formed first before being pushed. Wait, but if the sandstone is already a layer, tectonic forces could uplift it, placing it above another layer like shale. But is that a common process? I'm not too sure about this one. It seems possible, but I'm more certain about other options.

Wait, going back to option D, if the water level lowers, a beach forms where the lake bottom was. So the sand from the beach would be deposited on top of whatever was there before. If previously, the area had shale, maybe because it was a deeper lake or sea depositing finer particles (shale). Then when the water level drops, coarser sand is deposited on top, forming sandstone. That sounds plausible.

So comparing options D and B. Option B is about meteorite impacts, which do happen but are less common. Option D is a more typical sedimentary process. So probably D is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Sandstone is formed from sand-sized grains. When a lake's water level lowers, the beach area would have sand. The sand gets deposited there, and over time, it's compressed and cemented into sandstone. So the sandstone layer would be on top of the previous layer, which was maybe shale from when the lake was deeper and deposited finer particles.

Alternatively, what about option B? Meteorite impact creates sand, which then becomes sandstone. But would that create a layer just above shale? I suppose if the impact occurred and the sand was deposited on existing shale, but that's a more specific scenario. It's possible, but it's less likely than the usual sedimentary processes.

So between D and B, I think D is more likely because it's a standard process. The lowering of a lake's water level causing a beach to form, depositing sand which becomes sandstone. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait wait, what about the other options? Did I miss any?

Option H: Tectonic activity pushing sandstone. If the sandstone was formed elsewhere and then pushed on top of the shale, that's possible. But the question is about the presence of sandstone just above shale, implying that the sandstone was deposited on top of the shale in the same area. So tectonic activity would require that the sandstone layer was moved there, which is possible but perhaps not the primary explanation.

So I think D is the correct answer.

To determine which sequence of events is consistent with the presence of a layer of sandstone just above a layer of shale, we need to consider the formation processes of these sedimentary rocks. Sandstone forms from sand-sized particles, while shale forms from finer silt and clay particles. The question asks for a plausible explanation for sandstone being deposited on top of shale.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** This suggests that one-celled organisms formed a colony and their shells lithified into sandstone. However, shells typically form limestone, not sandstone, unless they are siliceous. This is unlikely to explain the formation of sandstone above shale.  
- **Option B:** A meteorite impact pulverizing rock into sand-sized particles that later lithify into sandstone is possible, but such events are rare and do not typically explain the layered sequence of sandstone above shale in most geological settings.  
- **Option C:** A forest growing, dying, and decaying on top of shale, with organic material transforming into sandstone, is incorrect because organic material usually forms coal, not sandstone. Sandstone is mineral-based, not organic.  
- **Option D:** A lake's water level lowering, forming a beach where sand accumulates and later lithifies into sandstone, is a plausible explanation. In this scenario, finer particles like silt and clay (which form shale) could have been deposited in deeper water, while coarser sand was deposited on the beach as the water level dropped. Over time, the sand could lithify into sandstone, forming a layer above the shale. This is a common sedimentary process.  
- **Option E:** Mud being deposited and lithified into shale, followed by contact metamorphism turning it into sandstone, is unlikely. Contact metamorphism typically alters shale into metamorphic rocks like slate, not sandstone.  
- **Option F:** Volcanic lava cooling and hardening into sandstone is incorrect because lava cools into igneous rocks like basalt, not sedimentary rocks like sandstone.  
- **Option G:** A river carrying silt and clay that settles over shale and compacts into sandstone is incorrect because silt and clay form shale, not sandstone. Sandstone requires sand-sized particles.  
- **Option H:** Tectonic activity pushing sandstone from deep within the Earth's surface to just above shale is possible but less likely. Sandstone forms at the surface, and the question implies a depositional origin rather than tectonic uplift.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is **Option D**, where a lake's water level lowers, forming a beach. Sand deposited on the beach lithifies into sandstone, creating a layer above the finer-grained shale deposited in deeper water. This aligns with typical sedimentary processes.
