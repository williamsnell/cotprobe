Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about tire pressure and temperature. Alright, let's see what it's asking. The problem is in two parts, (a) and (b). Let's read it carefully.

On a hot day, the pressure in an automobile tire increases. The initial condition is that the air in the tire at 59°F has a pressure of 28.0 lbs/in². Then, when it's hot, the pressure increases to 30.0 lbs/in². The question is, for part (a), what's the temperature when this happens, assuming the volume doesn't change. Then part (b) asks what the pressure would be if the temperature rises to 106°F.

Hmm, I remember that pressure and temperature are related by the ideal gas law, but since the volume isn't changing, maybe I can use Gay-Lussac's Law. Oh right, Gay-Lussac's Law states that pressure is directly proportional to temperature when volume is constant. The formula is P1/T1 = P2/T2, but wait, I have to use absolute temperatures. So I should convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin or Rankine.

Wait, which temperature scale to use? Since it's the ideal gas law, absolute temperature is needed. In the US, sometimes Rankine is used because it's like Kelvin but starting from Fahrenheit's absolute zero. Or wait, maybe it's easier to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin by first converting to Celsius and then adding 273.15. Oh wait, no, because Kelvin and Rankine have the same size degrees, but Rankine starts at absolute zero, which is -459.67°F. So for converting Fahrenheit to Rankine, it's °R = °F + 459.67.

Let me think: if I have two states, initial and final. For part (a), initial pressure P1 is 28.0 lbs/in² at T1 of 59°F. Final pressure P2 is 30.0 lbs/in², and we need to find T2 in °F.

Using Gay-Lussac's Law: P1 / T1 = P2 / T2. But T1 and T2 are in absolute temperatures, so I need to convert 59°F and the unknown T2 into Rankine.

So first, convert T1. 59°F to Rankine: T1 = 59 + 459.67 = 518.67 °R.

We can set up the equation: (28.0) / (518.67) = (30.0) / T2.

Wait, solving for T2: T2 = (30.0 * 518.67) / 28.0.

Let me compute that. 

Calculate numerator: 30 * 518.67 = 15,560.1.

Divide by 28: 15,560.1 /28 ≈ 556.43 °R.

Now, convert T2 back to Fahrenheit: T2 = 556.43 - 459.67 = 96.76°F. So approximately 97°F.

Looking at the options, part (a) of option B is 97°F. So (a) would be 97°F.

Now part (b): What's the pressure when the temperature rises to 106°F. Again, assuming volume is constant, so same approach.

Convert 106°F to Rankine: 106 + 459.67 = 565.67 °R.

Using P1 / T1 = P2 / T2. But wait, which P and T are we using as the initial state for part (b)? The problem says in (a) the pressure increases to 30.0, so part (b) starts from the same initial state as part (a), or after part (a)? Hmm, the wording isn't entirely clear, but I think each part is independent. Let me recheck.

The initial situation is that at 59°F, the pressure is 28.0. Then, when it's hot, the pressure goes to 30.0. So part (a) is about when it's hot, so that's the situation where pressure is 30 at T2. Then part (b) is when the temperature goes up even more, to 106°F, so we need to find the new pressure.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the initial state is 28.0 at 59°F, and then in part (a), when pressure is 30.0, what's T? Then in part (b), when T is 106°F, what's P?

Wait no, the question says: (a) what's the temperature when pressure increases to 30.0. So part (a) is the first scenario. Then (b) is a separate scenario, starting from the initial state (28.0 at 59°F) and going up to 106°F, what's the pressure.

So for part (b), the initial state is 28.0 lbs/in² at 59°F, and the new temperature is 106°F. So again, using P1 / T1 = P2 / T2.

Compute T1 and T2 in Rankine.

T1 =59 +459.67=518.67 R.

T2=106 +459.67=565.67 R.

So P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1) = 28.0 * (565.67 / 518.67).

Calculate that ratio: 565.67 /518.67 ≈ 1.0905.

Multiply by 28: 28 *1.0905≈30.5 lbs/in².

Looking at the options, option B has (a)97°F and (b)30.5. So option B would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

In part (a), 30.0 / 28.0 = T2 / T1. Wait no, P1/T1 = P2/T2 → T2 = (P2/P1) * T1.

Wait, yes, same as before.

Wait, 30/28 = T2 / T1 → T2 = (30/28)*T1.

Wait, I did that correctly before. So 30/28 is approximately 1.0714. So T2 =518.67 *1.0714≈556.43 R, which is 96.76°F ≈97°F.

Yes.

For part (b), the ratio is T2 =106°F →565.67 R.

So P2 =28.0 * (565.67/518.67)=28*(1.0905)≈30.5.

So the options with (a)97 and (b)30.5 is option B.

To solve the problem, we use Gay-Lussac's Law, which states that pressure is directly proportional to temperature when volume is constant. The formula is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

where \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are pressures, and \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are absolute temperatures in Rankine (°R). To convert Fahrenheit to Rankine:

\[
T_{\text{R}} = T_{\text{F}} + 459.67
\]

### Part (a)
The initial pressure is \(P_1 = 28.0 \, \text{lbs/in}^2\) at \(T_1 = 59^\circ \text{F}\), and the final pressure is \(P_2 = 30.0 \, \text{lbs/in}^2\). We need to find \(T_2\).

1. Convert \(T_1\) to Rankine:
   \[
   T_1 = 59 + 459.67 = 518.67 \, \text{°R}
   \]

2. Rearrange Gay-Lussac's Law to solve for \(T_2\):
   \[
   T_2 = \frac{P_2}{P_1} \cdot T_1
   \]

3. Substitute values:
   \[
   T_2 = \frac{30.0}{28.0} \cdot 518.67 \approx 556.43 \, \text{°R}
   \]

4. Convert \(T_2\) back to Fahrenheit:
   \[
   T_2 = 556.43 - 459.67 \approx 96.76 \, \text{°F} \approx 97 \, \text{°F}
   \]

Thus, the temperature in part (a) is approximately \(97^\circ \text{F}\).

### Part (b)
The initial pressure is \(P_1 = 28.0 \, \text{lbs/in}^2\) at \(T_1 = 59^\circ \text{F}\), and the temperature rises to \(T_2 = 106^\circ \text{F}\). We need to find \(P_2\).

1. Convert \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) to Rankine:
   \[
   T_1 = 59 + 459.67 = 518.67 \, \text{°R}, \quad T_2 = 106 + 459.67 = 565.67 \, \text{°R}
   \]

2. Rearrange Gay-Lussac's Law to solve for \(P_2\):
   \[
   P_2 = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \cdot P_1
   \]

3. Substitute values:
   \[
   P_2 = \frac{565.67}{518.67} \cdot 28.0 \approx 30.5 \, \text{lbs/in}^2
   \]

Thus, the pressure in part (b) is approximately \(30.5 \, \text{lbs/in}^2\).

### Final Answer
The correct option is **B: (a) 97°F, (b) 30.5 lbs/in²**.

B
