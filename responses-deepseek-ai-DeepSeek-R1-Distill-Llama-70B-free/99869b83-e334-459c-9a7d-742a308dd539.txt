Question:

In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
B: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
C: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.
D: the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this property law question. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the scenario involves a chain of conveyances starting from a landowner in 1888. Let me outline the timeline and the key events:

1. **1888**: Landowner owns a dairy farm.
2. **1938**: Landowner conveys the farm to his son.
3. **1953**: The son conveys it to his friend, but the deed isn't recorded until after the son's death in 1957.
4. **1956**: The son mortgages the farm to the bank. The mortgage is recorded in 1956 and notes that it's subordinate to a 1936 mortgage to an investor.
5. **1936**: The son grants a mortgage to the investor, which was recorded that year.
6. **1979**: The friend conveys the farm to a farmer. The deed is recorded but doesn't mention any mortgages.
7. **2008**: The farmer agrees to sell to a buyer for $75,000. The sale closes on Jan 15, 2009. The farmer gives a general warranty deed with covenants, including against encumbrances.
8. After the sale, the buyer discovers the 1936 mortgage (which wasn't satisfied) and sues for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

The question is about who wins the judgment—buyer or farmer.

I remember that covenants of title are promises in a deed. The covenant against encumbrances is one of them. So, the farmer is warranting that there are no encumbrances on the property except as noted.

But wait, the 1936 mortgage was recorded, right? The son gave a mortgage to the investor in 1936, and it was recorded then. So, when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, the friend would have taken the property subject to that existing mortgage because it was recorded. Unless the friend had notice, but under a notice-type recording statute, the friend would be bound by what's recorded.

Wait, no, the friend's deed wasn't recorded until after the son's death in 1957. So the timing here might matter. Let me think about the recording statute. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who has no notice of prior unrecorded conveyances is protected. But here, the 1936 mortgage was recorded, so the friend would have had constructive notice of it when they took the deed in 1953. So the friend would take the property subject to that mortgage.

Then, in 1956, the son mortgages to the bank, which is subordinate to the 1936 mortgage. So the bank's mortgage is junior to the investor's. But the son had already conveyed the property to the friend in 1953, so how could he mortgage it again? Unless the friend didn't record the deed until after the son's death, which is 1957. So, if the friend's deed was recorded after the son's death, but the 1956 mortgage was recorded in 1956, which is before the friend's deed was recorded.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me map out the chain of title and the recording.

- 1938: Landowner to son (recorded, I assume, as it's a conveyance).
- 1936: Son to investor mortgage (recorded in 1936).
- 1953: Son to friend deed. Not recorded until 1957.
- 1956: Son to bank mortgage, recorded in 1956, subordinate to the 1936 mortgage.
- 1957: Son dies, and friend's deed is recorded.
- 1979: Friend to farmer, deed recorded, no mention of mortgages.

So when the friend took the deed in 1953, the 1936 mortgage was already recorded. Therefore, the friend's deed was subject to that mortgage. But the friend's deed wasn't recorded until 1957, which is after the son's mortgage to the bank in 1956, which was recorded in 1956.

Wait, but the son had already conveyed the property to the friend in 1953, so the son didn't own it anymore. So when the son mortgaged it to the bank in 1956, was that a valid mortgage? Because the son no longer owned the property after 1953. So the bank's mortgage would be invalid because the son didn't have title anymore. Therefore, the bank's mortgage wouldn't encumber the property.

But the problem is that the friend's deed wasn't recorded until 1957, which is after the bank's mortgage was recorded in 1956. So, under the recording statute, when the bank took their mortgage in 1956, they would have checked the records and seen that the son was still the owner of record because the friend's deed wasn't recorded yet. So the bank might have thought the son still owned it. But in reality, the son had conveyed it to the friend in 1953, but that wasn't recorded yet. So, under a notice-type statute, the bank would have no notice of the friend's ownership, so their mortgage would be valid against the friend's interest. Wait, no, because the friend's deed was unrecorded, so the bank, without notice, would take free of the friend's claim. But wait, that's for conveyances. Here, the bank is taking a mortgage from the son, who is the record owner because the friend's deed isn't recorded yet. So the bank's mortgage would attach to the son's interest, but the son had already conveyed it to the friend. So does the bank's mortgage encumber the friend's ownership?

This is tricky. I think that because the son didn't own the property when he mortgaged it to the bank in 1956, the mortgage is invalid as to the true owner, the friend. Because the son had already parted with ownership. So the bank's mortgage wouldn't affect the friend, but since the friend's deed wasn't recorded until 1957, the bank's mortgage, recorded in 1956, would be a problem. Wait, but the friend's interest would be subject to any mortgages the son had before conveying. Wait, no—when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, any subsequent mortgages by the son wouldn't affect the friend because the son no longer had an interest to mortgage.

So, the 1936 mortgage from the son to the investor was recorded, so the friend's deed in 1953 would be subject to that mortgage. Then, the son tries to mortgage it again to the bank in 1956, but he can't because he no longer owns it. So the bank's mortgage is ineffective against the friend. Therefore, the only encumbrance is the 1936 mortgage.

Now, when the friend conveys to the farmer in 1979, the farmer's deed is recorded, and the deed doesn't mention any mortgages. But the 1936 mortgage is still on record. So the farmer would take the property subject to that mortgage, because it's a prior recorded encumbrance. But the farmer's deed from the friend is a general warranty deed. So the friend is warranting against encumbrances, but the 1936 mortgage was already there when the friend took it in 1953.

Wait, but when the friend took it in 1953, the 1936 mortgage was already an encumbrance. So when the friend conveys to the farmer in 1979, the friend's warranty would cover encumbrances that arose after the friend took ownership. Because the covenant against encumbrances typically warrants that there are no encumbrances except as noted. But if the encumbrance arose before the friend's ownership, then the friend's warranty wouldn't cover it. Because the covenant against encumbrances is that the property is free of encumbrances except as noted, but it doesn't warrant against prior encumbrances that the grantor didn't create.

Wait, but in this case, the friend didn't create the 1936 mortgage. So when the friend conveys to the farmer, the farmer would still be subject to that mortgage, and the friend's warranty deed's covenant against encumbrances would be breached because the property is still encumbered by the 1936 mortgage.

Wait, but the covenant against encumbrances is made by the grantor (in this case, the farmer when selling to the buyer in 2009). Wait, no, the farmer is conveying in 2009 with a general warranty deed that includes the covenant against encumbrances. So the question is whether the farmer's deed had an encumbrance (the 1936 mortgage) that the farmer didn't disclose.

But the farmer took the property from the friend in 1979. The friend's deed to the farmer was a general warranty deed, so the friend warranted against encumbrances. But the 1936 mortgage was an existing encumbrance when the friend took the property in 1953. So when the friend warranted against encumbrances to the farmer in 1979, that warranty would have been breached if there were any encumbrances that the friend was responsible for. But since the 1936 mortgage was from the son's time, the friend's warranty to the farmer would not cover that because it's a prior encumbrance. So the farmer's warranty to the buyer in 2009 would then be in question.

Wait, the farmer's warranty is against encumbrances. If the 1936 mortgage is still unsatisfied, then when the farmer conveys to the buyer in 2009, the property is still encumbered. So the farmer's covenant against encumbrances is breached because the property is subject to the 1936 mortgage.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the chain. Let me try to outline the warranties:

- Each time a general warranty deed is given, the grantor warrants against encumbrances that arose after the grantor's ownership began.

So, the son's 1936 mortgage was an encumbrance when the friend took the property in 1953. So the friend's warranty to the farmer in 1979 would not cover that, because it's a prior encumbrance. Therefore, the farmer would take the property subject to the 1936 mortgage, but the farmer's warranty to the buyer in 2009 would be that the property is free of encumbrances except as noted.

But wait, the 1936 mortgage was recorded, so when the farmer took the property in 1979, the farmer would have known about it (or should have known) because it's in the record. So when the farmer sold to the buyer in 2009, the buyer would have done a title search and found the 1936 mortgage. Unless the farmer's warranty deed covered it.

Wait, but the buyer is suing because the farmer's deed didn't mention any mortgages, and the covenant against encumbrances was breached. So the issue is whether the farmer's warranty deed's covenant against encumbrances covers the 1936 mortgage.

In a general warranty deed, the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it is breached if, at the time of the conveyance, there are encumbrances. It doesn't matter who created them; it's a warranty that the property is free and clear except as noted.

So if the farmer conveyed the property with a covenant against encumbrances, and the property was still subject to the 1936 mortgage, then the farmer breached that covenant. The fact that the mortgage was from before the farmer's time doesn't matter; the covenant is that the property is free of encumbrances when conveyed.

But wait, the 1936 mortgage was from the son to the investor, and it was recorded. So when the farmer took the property in 1979, the farmer would have known about it through a title search. But the farmer's deed from the friend didn't mention it. So the friend's warranty to the farmer would have been breached because of the 1936 mortgage. But the farmer then conveys with his own warranty deed, so the buyer is looking to the farmer for the breach.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1936 mortgage was an encumbrance that the son created, but when the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, the friend took subject to that mortgage. So the friend's warranty to the farmer in 1979 would have covered any encumbrances that arose during the friend's ownership, but not before.

Wait, but the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, which speaks as of the time of the conveyance. So when the farmer warranted against encumbrances in 2009, if the 1936 mortgage was still outstanding, that's a breach. It doesn't matter when the encumbrance arose; the covenant is that there are none at the time of the conveyance.

But I'm a bit confused because the 1936 mortgage would have been discovered in a title search, so the buyer might have known about it. But the buyer's deed from the farmer had a covenant against encumbrances, which would override any prior issues because it's a warranty.

Wait, but in this case, the buyer didn't know about the 1936 mortgage until after taking possession. The question is whether the farmer's covenant against encumbrances covers that.

In title theory states, mortgages are considered liens on the property. So the existence of an unsatisfied mortgage from 1936 would be an encumbrance.

So, when the farmer conveyed to the buyer in 2009 with a covenant against encumbrances, the buyer can sue for breach because the property was still encumbered by that mortgage.

But wait, the farmer might argue that the mortgage was from before his time, so he shouldn't be responsible. But the covenant against encumbrances doesn't care who created the encumbrance; it's a warranty that the property is free of any encumbrances at the time of conveyance, except as noted. So the farmer is on the hook regardless of when the encumbrance arose.

So the buyer would win because the covenant was breached when the deed was delivered, as the property was still encumbered.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the buyer wins because the covenant was breached at the time of the deed delivery. Option A says the buyer wins because the covenant is a guarantee against encumbrances, which is correct, but B is more specific about the timing of the breach.

So, the correct answer should be B.

The question revolves around a chain of conveyances and the breach of the covenant against encumbrances in a general warranty deed. The key issue is whether the farmer breached this covenant when conveying the dairy farm to the buyer in 2009, given the existence of an unsatisfied 1936 mortgage.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Chain of Title and Encumbrances**:
   - In 1936, the son granted a mortgage to the investor, which was recorded. This created an encumbrance on the property.
   - In 1953, the son conveyed the property to the friend, but the deed was not recorded until 1957. At this point, the friend took the property subject to the 1936 mortgage because it was already recorded.
   - In 1956, the son attempted to mortgage the property to the bank, but since the son had already conveyed the property to the friend in 1953, the son no longer had an interest to mortgage. Thus, the bank's mortgage was invalid and did not encumber the property.
   - In 1979, the friend conveyed the property to the farmer with a general warranty deed. The friend's warranty against encumbrances would not cover the 1936 mortgage because it predated the friend's ownership. However, the farmer would still take the property subject to the 1936 mortgage.
   - In 2009, the farmer conveyed the property to the buyer with a general warranty deed, including a covenant against encumbrances. The buyer later discovered the unsatisfied 1936 mortgage and sued for breach of this covenant.

2. **Covenant Against Encumbrances**:
   - The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it is breached if the property is encumbered at the time of conveyance, regardless of when the encumbrance arose.
   - The 1936 mortgage, though created before the farmer's ownership, remained an encumbrance on the property at the time of the 2009 conveyance. Therefore, the farmer's warranty against encumbrances was breached.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Correct in stating that the covenant against encumbrances guarantees the property is free of encumbrances. However, it is less specific about the timing of the breach.
   - **Option B**: Correct and more precise, as it emphasizes that the breach occurred at the time of the deed delivery in 2009, when the property was still encumbered by the 1936 mortgage.
   - **Option C** and **Option D**: Incorrect because they suggest the farmer is not liable, ignoring the fact that the covenant against encumbrances is breached if the property is encumbered at the time of conveyance.

### Conclusion:
The buyer is entitled to damages because the covenant against encumbrances was breached when the deed was delivered in 2009, as the property was still subject to the unsatisfied 1936 mortgage. The correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
