Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about a mass m moving in one dimension under a specific force. The force is +F0 when x is less than 0, and -F0 when x is greater than 0. I'm supposed to find the period of this motion in terms of m, F0, and the amplitude A. And then choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, first, I think I should visualize the force acting on the mass. So when the mass is on the left side of x=0, it's pushed to the right, and when it's on the right side of x=0, it's pushed to the left. That sounds like a restoring force, but only in two regions. Wait, actually, this is similar to a particle oscillating around the origin, but the force isn't proportional to x like in a spring. Instead, it's constant in each region.

Wait, so the force is piecewise constant. So the motion might be similar to a particle bouncing between two regions, each with a constant acceleration. Let me think about the potential energy here. Since the force is constant, the potential would be a linear function of x in each region. But wait, for x <0, F is +F0, so the potential V(x) would be -F0 x plus a constant. For x>0, F is -F0, so V(x) would be F0 x plus another constant. So the potential is V-shaped, forming a kind of 'V' with the vertex at x=0.

Wait, that makes the system similar to a particle in a symmetric potential well. So the motion would be oscillatory, moving back and forth across x=0. Hmm, but in this case, the force isn't Hooke's law (F proportional to x), but rather a constant in each region.

Let me model the motion. Suppose the mass starts at x = A, which is the amplitude. At x=A>0, the force is -F0, so the mass accelerates towards x=0. The acceleration a = F/m, so here a = -F0/m. So it's decelerating as it moves towards x=0.

Wait, no, because when x>0, F is -F0, so the acceleration is a = F/m = (-F0)/m. So when x>0, the mass experiences a negative acceleration, meaning it's slowing down as it approaches x=0 from the right. Similarly, when x<0, the acceleration is +F0/m, so it's moving to the right with positive acceleration until it hits x=0.

So the motion is like bouncing between x = A and x = -A, but the path in between isn't sinusoidal. Instead, the motion is made up of parabolic segments because the acceleration is constant in each region.

So to find the period, I need to calculate the time taken for one complete oscillation, which would be from x=A to x=0, then to x=-A, then back to x=0, and finally back to x=A. Hmm, wait no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, when the particle starts at x=A, it moves towards x=0 with a constant acceleration of -F0/m. Once it passes x=0 (if it has enough velocity), it enters the region x<0, where the force reverses direction, giving a positive acceleration. Wait, that's not right. Wait, when x <0, the force is +F0, so the acceleration is +F0/m. So when the particle is on the left side (x<0), it's being pushed to the right, which would slow it down as it approaches x=0 from the left.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to model each segment of the motion. Let's consider the particle moving from x=A to x=0. The force is -F0, so acceleration is a = -F0/m. The initial velocity when starting at A is zero because that's the amplitude—so the particle is released from rest. So using kinematic equations, I can find the time taken to reach x=0.

Wait, but wait, when the particle reaches x=0, it's moving into the x<0 region, so the force changes direction. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think: when x=0, the force switches, but the particle's direction of motion depends on its velocity at that point.

Let me break it down into parts.

First, the particle starts at x = A, v=0. The force is -F0, so acceleration a = -F0/m. It moves towards x=0. Let me find the time it takes to reach x=0.

Using the equation of motion:

x(t) = x0 + v0*t + (1/2) a t²

Here, x0 = A, v0=0, a = -F0/m.

We need to find t when x(t) = 0.

0 = A + 0*t + (1/2) (-F0/m) t².
So,

(1/2)(F0/m) t² = A

t² = (2 A m ) / F0

t = sqrt( (2 A m) / F0 )

Wait, but wait, that's the time to reach x=0 from x=A. But this assumes that the acceleration is constant for the entire movement. But wait, when the particle reaches x=0, the force changes direction. So perhaps this calculation is correct only up to x=0.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model the motion as the particle moving from A to 0, taking time t1, then from 0 to -A (due to the velocity it has at x=0), taking time t2, then from -A back to 0, time t3, and then from 0 back to A, time t4. But wait, maybe the motion is symmetric, so t1 equals t3, and t2 equals t4. So the period would be 2*(t1 + t2).

Wait, let me think again. When the particle is at A, it starts moving towards 0 with acceleration a=-F0/m. The time to reach x=0 is t1. At x=0, the velocity is v = v0 + a t. v0=0, so v = a t1 = (-F0/m) * t1.

Wait, but a is negative, so velocity is negative at x=0, meaning moving to the left. So now, from x=0, the particle moves into x<0 region, where the force is +F0, so acceleration is +F0/m.

Wait, so in the x<0 region, the acceleration is positive. So the particle is moving left (negative direction) but being accelerated to the right.

Hmm, so the particle will decelerate as it moves into the x<0 region until it comes to rest, then start moving back. Wait, but I'm trying to model the time taken for each part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each quarter of the motion.

From A to 0: time t1.

From 0 to -A: time t2.

From -A to 0: time t3.

From 0 to A: time t4.

But due to symmetry, t1 = t3 and t2 = t4.

So the period T would be 2*(t1 + t2).

Wait, but maybe not. Let me see.

Wait, when the particle reaches x=0 from the right (x>0), it's moving towards negative x with some velocity. Then, in the x<0 region, the acceleration is positive, so it's slowing down the particle until it stops, then accelerates it back towards x=0.

Hmm, perhaps the time taken to go from x=0 (with velocity -v) to x=-A is the same as the time to go from x=A to x=0, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's model the first part: from A to 0.

Using kinematic equations.

Initial position: x = A.

Initial velocity: v = 0.

Acceleration: a = -F0/m.

We can find the velocity when it reaches x=0.

Using v² = u² + 2 a s.

u=0, s = -A (since moving from A to 0, the displacement is -A).

So,

v² = 0 + 2*(-F0/m)*(-A) = 2 (F0 A)/m

Thus, v = sqrt( 2 F0 A / m )

Wait, but since the acceleration is negative, the velocity is in the negative direction, so v = - sqrt( 2 F0 A / m )

Wait, no, because when moving from A to 0, the displacement is -A. So the signs should be considered carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the magnitude. So the speed when reaching x=0 is sqrt( 2 F0 A / m ).

Now, moving into x <0 region, the force is +F0, so acceleration is a' = +F0/m.

The particle is moving left (negative direction) with speed sqrt(2 F0 A/m) at x=0.

Wait, no, x=0 is the point where it's entering the x<0 region. So the velocity at x=0 is negative (moving left) with magnitude sqrt(2 F0 A/m).

Now, in the x<0 region, the acceleration is positive, so it's decelerating the particle. So the particle will slow down, come to rest, and then start moving back towards x=0.

Wait, so the time taken to go from x=0 to x=-A is the same as the time from x=A to x=0? Or is it different?

Wait, let me think: when the particle is at x=0, moving left with speed v = sqrt(2 F0 A/m).

The acceleration is a' = F0/m (positive), which is opposite to the direction of velocity, so it's a deceleration.

We can model this as motion with initial position x=0, initial velocity v = -sqrt(2 F0 A/m), and acceleration a' = F0/m.

We want to find the time it takes for the particle to reach x = -A.

Using the equation:

x(t) = x0 + v0 t + (1/2) a t²

x0 = 0, v0 = -sqrt(2 F0 A/m), a = F0/m.

We set x(t) = -A.

So:

- A = 0 + (-sqrt(2 F0 A/m)) t + (1/2)(F0/m) t²

Multiply both sides by m to eliminate denominators:

- A m = - sqrt(2 F0 A m^2) t + (F0/2) m t²

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, let's use another kinematic equation: v² = u² + 2 a s.

At the point x=-A, the velocity will be zero, because that's the amplitude on the left side. So, u = -sqrt(2 F0 A/m), a = F0/m, s = -A -0 = -A.

So,

v² = u² + 2 a s

0 = [ (2 F0 A/m) ] + 2*(F0/m)*(-A)

Wait, that would be:

0 = 2 F0 A/m + 2*(F0/m)*(-A)

Which simplifies to 0 = 0. Hmm, that doesn't help me find time.

Wait, maybe I should use the time taken to go from x=0 to x=-A under constant acceleration a=F0/m and initial velocity v0 = -sqrt(2 F0 A/m).

So, equation:

x(t) = 0 + v0 t + 0.5 a t²

We set x(t) = -A:

- A = v0 t + 0.5 a t²

Substituting v0 and a:

- A = [ -sqrt(2 F0 A/m) ] t + 0.5*(F0/m) t²

This is a quadratic equation in terms of t.

Let me rearrange:

0.5 (F0/m) t² - sqrt(2 F0 A/m) t - A = 0

Multiply both sides by 2m/F0 to simplify:

t² - 2 sqrt(2 m A F0) / F0 * t - 2 A m / F0 = 0

Wait, let me compute each term.

Wait, 0.5*(F0/m) t² becomes (F0/(2m)) t². Multiply by 2m/F0: (F0/(2m)) * (2m/F0) ) t² = t².

Similarly, the second term: [ -sqrt(2 F0 A/m) ] t → when multiplied by 2m/F0, becomes:

- sqrt(2 F0 A/m) * 2m/F0 * t = - 2 m sqrt(2 F0 A) / (F0 sqrt(m)) ) t

Wait, perhaps I'm making it more complicated. Let me instead write the equation as:

( F0/(2m) ) t² - sqrt(2 F0 A/m ) t - A = 0

Multiply both sides by 2m/F0 to eliminate denominators:

t² - [ 2m sqrt(2 F0 A/m ) * sqrt(m) ) / F0 ] t - (2 m A)/F0 = 0

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, let's solve the quadratic equation.

The equation is:

0.5 (F0/m) t² - sqrt(2 F0 A/m) t - A = 0

Multiply all terms by 2m/F0:

t² - 2 sqrt(2 m A F0) / F0 * t - 2 A m / F0 = 0

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, more accurately:

0.5 (F0/m) t² = (F0 t²) / (2m)

Similarly, sqrt(2 F0 A/m) = sqrt(2 F0 A) / sqrt(m)

So when you multiply the equation by 2m/F0:

Each term:

( F0 t²/(2m) ) * (2m/F0) ) = t²

- sqrt(2 F0 A/m) * t * (2m/F0) ) = - 2 m sqrt(2 F0 A/m) t / F0

= - 2 m * sqrt(2 F0 A) / sqrt(m) * t / F0

Simplify sqrt(m) in denominator: sqrt(m) = m^(1/2), so m / sqrt(m) = m^(1/2) = sqrt(m).

So:

= -2 * sqrt(2 F0 A) * sqrt(m) * t / F0

Similarly, the third term:

(-A) * (2m/F0) )= -2 A m / F0

So the equation becomes:

t² - [ 2 sqrt(2 F0 A) * sqrt(m) / F0 ) ] t - (2 A m)/F0 = 0

Hmm, maybe this isn't the most efficient approach. Let me try solving the quadratic equation.

The original equation after substitution is:

( F0/(2m) ) t² - sqrt(2 F0 A/m) t - A = 0

Let me denote:

a_quad = F0/(2m)
b_quad = -sqrt(2 F0 A/m)
c_quad = -A

The quadratic solution is t = [ -b_quad ± sqrt( b_quad² - 4 a_quad c_quad ) ] / (2 a_quad )

Compute discriminant D:

D = b_quad² - 4 a_quad c_quad

= (2 F0 A/m) - 4*(F0/(2m))*(-A)

= 2 F0 A/m + 2 F0 A/m

= 4 F0 A/m

So,

t = [ sqrt(2 F0 A/m) ± sqrt(4 F0 A/m) ] * (2m)/(F0)

Wait, because the denominator is 2a_quad = 2*(F0/(2m)) )= F0/m.

Wait, wait, the denominator is 2 a_quad = 2*(F0/(2m)) )= F0/m.

So,

t = [ sqrt(2 F0 A/m) ± 2 sqrt(F0 A/m) ] * (m/F0 )

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, sqrt(D) = sqrt(4 F0 A/m) )= 2 sqrt(F0 A/m).

So,

t = [ sqrt(2 F0 A/m) ± 2 sqrt(F0 A/m) ] * (m/F0 )

We have two solutions:

t = [ sqrt(2 F0 A/m) + 2 sqrt(F0 A/m) ] * (m/F0 )

and

t = [ sqrt(2 F0 A/m) - 2 sqrt(F0 A/m) ] * (m/F0 )

The second solution would give a negative time, which isn't physical, so we take the first solution.

Factor out sqrt(F0 A/m):

t = [ sqrt(F0 A/m) ( sqrt(2) + 2 ) ] * (m/F0 )

Simplify:

= [ (sqrt(F0 A/m)) * (sqrt(2)+2) ) ] * (m/F0 )

= (sqrt(2)+2) * sqrt(A/m * F0 ) * (m/F0 )

Wait, let me compute sqrt(A/m F0):

sqrt( (A F0) / m )

So,

t = (sqrt(2) + 2) * sqrt( (A F0)/m ) * (m/F0 )

Simplify the terms:

sqrt( (A F0)/m ) = sqrt(A F0/m )

And (m/F0 ) = m/(F0 )

So,

t = (sqrt(2) + 2) * sqrt(A F0/m) * (m/F0 )

= (sqrt(2) + 2) * sqrt(A F0/m) * (m/F0 )

Let me compute sqrt(A F0/m) * m/F0:

= sqrt(A F0/m) * m/F0

= sqrt( A F0/m ) * m / F0

= sqrt( A F0/m ) * (m / F0 )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to square sqrt(A F0/m) * m/F0.

Wait, sqrt(a) * b = sqrt(a) * sqrt(b²) = sqrt(a b²) = b sqrt(a)

So,

sqrt(A F0/m) * m/F0 = (m/F0) * sqrt( A F0/m )

Let me square this term:

(m²/F0
