Okay, so I've got this integrodifferential equation to convert into state form. Hmm, let me think. The equation is (d²v/dt²) + a(dv/dt) + b v + C^t ∫₀^t v(t') dt' = sin t. Wait, wait, I think the integral is from zero to t, right? So it's the integral of v(t') multiplied by some function up to time t.

Wait, the integral term is C^t ∫₀^t v(t') dt'. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's C multiplied by the integral of t' from 0 to t? Or is it C^t times the integral? No, probably the first interpretation is correct. So the integral term is C multiplied by the integral of v(t') from 0 to t.

So I need to write this equation in state form, which typically involves choosing state variables and expressing their derivatives in terms of the states.

Let me recall that the state form usually involves variables like q1, q2, q3, where q1 is the output (v), q2 is the first derivative, and q3 is the integral term, or something like that. Or perhaps another combination.

Wait, no, more accurately, for a second-order system with an integral term, we might need three state variables. Because the integrodifferential equation introduces an integral, which is another state beyond the usual two for a second-order differential equation.

So let me define the state variables. Let's say:

q1 = v (the output)
q2 = dv/dt (the first derivative)
q3 = ∫₀^t v(t') dt' (the integral of v from 0 to t)

Wait, but then the integral term in the equation is C * q3, right?

So the original equation is:

d²v/dt² + a (dv/dt) + b v + C q3 = sin t

But d²v/dt² is the derivative of q2, so:

dq2/dt = -a q2 - b q1 - C q3 + sin t

Wait, because substituting, the equation becomes dq2/dt = - (a q2 + b q1 + C q3) + sin t.

Now, we need expressions for the derivatives of q1 and q3.

q1 is v, so dq1/dt is dv/dt, which is q2. So:

dq1/dt = q2

q3 is the integral of v from 0 to t, so dq3/dt is v(t), which is q1. So:

dq3/dt = q1

So now, the state equations are:

dq1/dt = q2

dq2/dt = -a q2 - b q1 - C q3 + sin t

dq3/dt = q1

Wait, but wait, I'm looking at the options, and they don't have three equations. Oh, wait, the options are about the third derivative, so perhaps the question is asking for the expression for q3 dot. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, each option is an expression for one of the state derivatives, like q3 dot. So the correct option would be the one that correctly represents dq3/dt.

Wait, according to my earlier definitions, dq3/dt is q1. So in the state form, q3_dot = q1.

But looking at the options, none of them seem to have just q1. Alternatively, perhaps I've misdefined the state variables.

Wait, maybe the state variables are different. Let me consider another approach. Perhaps the integral term is being treated as another state variable, so let me define:

q1 = v

q2 = dv/dt

q3 = ∫₀^t v(t') dt'

Then, as before, dq1/dt = q2

dq2/dt = -a q2 - b q1 - C q3 + sin t

dq3/dt = q1

So, the third equation is dq3/dt = q1. So in the options, which one has dq3/dt (which would be q3_dot) equal to q1?

Looking at the options, let's check each:

Option B: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t. Hmm, no, that's not matching.

Option C: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 +a q3 -sin t. No.

Option D: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 -cos t. No.

Option E: q̇3 = -c q1 +b q2 -a q3 + sin t. No.

Option F: q̇1 = ... Not relevant.

Option G: q̇3 = c q1 +b q2 +a q3 + cos t. No.

Option H: q̇3 = c q1 -b q2 +a q3 - sin t. No.

Option I: q̇1 = ... No.

Option J: q̇2 = ... No.

Wait, none of these options have q3_dot equal to just q1. So perhaps I made a mistake in my state variable definitions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included the integral term differently. Maybe I should have considered the integral as a separate state variable but with different coefficients.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, when there's an integral term, you can introduce a new state variable to represent it. Let me think again.

The original equation is:

v'' + a v' + b v + C ∫₀^t v(t') dt' = sin t

Let me define:

q1 = v

q2 = v' = dq1/dt

q3 = ∫₀^t v(t') dt' → dq3/dt = q1

So, the equation becomes:

q2' + a q2 + b q1 + C q3 = sin t → q2' = -a q2 - b q1 - C q3 + sin t

So the state equations are:

q1' = q2

q2' = -a q2 - b q1 - C q3 + sin t

q3' = q1

So when looking at the options, each option is one of these equations.

Wait, the question is to write the equation in state form, which would be a set of first-order equations. But the options seem to present individual equations, likely the third one (q3').

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct one is the equation for q3_dot. But according to my equations, q3' is q1, which is just q1.

But looking at the options, none of the q3_dot options match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the variables.

Wait, maybe the integral is not q3, but perhaps the state variables are defined differently. Alternatively, maybe the equation is rearranged.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the integral term as part of the state variables. Another approach is to define the state variables as:

x1 = v

x2 = v'

x3 = ∫₀^t v(t') dt'

Then, as before:

x1' = x2

x2' = -a x2 - b x1 - C x3 + sin t

x3' = x1

So, the equation for x3' is x3' = x1, which is the same as q3' = q1.

Looking at the options, none of the options directly match x3' = x1. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm miscounting the options.

Wait, looking again, the options are:

Option B: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t

Option C: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 +a q3 - sin t

Option D: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 -cos t

Option E: q̇3 = -c q1 +b q2 -a q3 + sin t

Option G: q̇3 = c q1 +b q2 +a q3 +cost

Option H: q̇3 = c q1 -b q2 +a q3 - sin t

Option J: q̇2 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, the original equation has +C^t ∫ ... dt. So when we move everything to the left, it's:

v'' + a v' + b v + C ∫ v dt = sin t → v'' = -a v' -b v - C ∫ v dt + sin t

So, x2' = -a x2 -b x1 - C x3 + sin t

So, in the equation for x2', it's correct.

But the equation for x3' is x1, which is q1. So in the options, the correct one would be where q3' = q1, but none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the equation is in terms of the integral up to t, but including t as a variable multiplier. Let me look again at the original equation.

Wait, the term is C^t ∫₀^t v(t') dt'. Oh wait, no, that can't be right. Because C^t would be C raised to the power t, which doesn't make much sense in this context. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the term is C * t * ∫₀^t v(t') dt'?

Wait, the original equation is written as C ^t ∫₀^t v(t') dt'. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. If it's C multiplied by t multiplied by the integral, then the term would be C t ∫₀^t v(t') dt' dt. But that seems complicated, perhaps another approach is needed.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and the term is C times the integral, so C ∫₀^t v(t') dt'.

Assuming that, then as before, the state variables are x1 = v, x2 = v', x3 = ∫ v dt.

So, x3' = v = x1.

But looking at the options, none have q3' = q1. So perhaps I've chosen the state variables incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps another choice of state variables.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the state variables are chosen as:

q1 = v

q2 = v'

q3 = ∫₀^t v(t') dt'

Then, as before:

q1' = q2

q2' = -a q2 -b q1 - C q3 + sin t

q3' = q1

So, the equation for q3' is q3' = q1.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the original equation. Let me re-express it.

Wait, the equation is:

v''(t) + a v'(t) + b v(t) + C^t ∫₀^t v(t') dt' = sin t

Wait, perhaps C^t is a typo, and it's meant to be C times t, making the term C t ∫₀^t v(t') dt'. Alternatively, perhaps it's C times the integral, and the t is a variable, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is C multiplied by the integral from 0 to t of v(t') dt', so C ∫ v(t') dt'. Then, I think my earlier approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that represents the equation for q3', which is q3' = q1, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-examine the original equation.

The equation is:

v'' + a v' + b v + C ∫ v dt = sin t

So, moving all terms to the left except sin t:

v'' = -a v' -b v - C ∫ v dt + sin t

So, the equation for q2' is as I wrote.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is the equation for q2', which is option J or B.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option J: q̇2 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t

Wait, no, because the equation for q2' is:

q2' = -a q2 -b q1 - C q3 + sin t

So, looking for an option where q2' equals -a q2 -b q1 - C q3 + sin t.

Looking at the options, none have sin t in the equation for q2'. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: q̇2 = cq1 + bq2 + aq3 - sin t → Not matching.

B: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t → No.

C: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 +a q3 - sin t → No.

D: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 - cos t → No.

E: q̇3 = -c q1 +b q2 -a q3 + sin t → No.

F: q̇1 = cq2 + bq3 + aq1 + sin t → No.

G: q̇3 = cq1 + bq2 + aq3 + cos t → No.

H: q̇3 = cq1 - bq2 + aq3 - sin t → No.

I: q̇1 = -cq2 - bq3 - aq1 + sin t → No.

J: q̇2 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t → Close but has cos t, not sin t.

Hmm, none of the options correctly represent q2' as per our equation. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I misread the original equation. Let me check again.

The original equation is:

(d²v/dt²) + a (dv/dt) + b v + C^t ∫₀^t v(t') dt' = sin t

Wait, perhaps the integral term is C multiplied by t multiplied by the integral, making it C t ∫ v(t') dt'. But that would complicate the state variables.

Alternatively, perhaps the C^t is a typo and should be C, so the term is C ∫ v(t') dt'.

In that case, the state equations are as I wrote, but the options don't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the integral is part of the state variables but with a different coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I should have included the integral as part of the state variables without considering it as a separate state, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the state form is written using a different set of variables. For example, perhaps the state variables are v, v', and the integral term. Let me try to write the system again.

So, the system is:

q1 = v

q2 = v'

q3 = ∫ v dt

Then:

q1' = q2

q2' = -a q2 -b q1 - C q3 + sin t

q3' = q1

So, the state equations in matrix form would be:

q1' = 0 q1 + 1 q2 + 0 q3

q2' = -b q1 -a q2 -C q3 + sin t

q3' = 1 q1 + 0 q2 + 0 q3

Looking at the options, each option gives one of these equations. The correct option would be the one that correctly represents one of these.

Option B: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t → No, because q3' should be q1, not involving q2 or q3.

Option C: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 +a q3 - sin t → No.

Option D: q̇3 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 - cos t → No.

Option E: q̇3 = -c q1 +b q2 -a q3 + sin t → No.

Option H: q̇3 = c q1 -b q2 +a q3 - sin t → No.

Option J: q̇2 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t → Close, but the forcing function is cos t, not sin t, and the signs may differ.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not present. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is for q3' being q1, but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the sign for the integral term. Let me re-examine the original equation.

The original equation is:

v'' + a v' + b v + C ∫ v dt = sin t

So, moving all terms except sin t to the left:

v'' = -a v' -b v - C ∫ v dt + sin t

So, q2' = -a q2 -b q1 - C q3 + sin t

But looking at the options, none have q2' with sin t.

Wait, looking at option J: q̇2 = -c q1 -b q2 -a q3 + cos t → Forcing function is cos t, but in our equation it's sin t. So this isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps the original equation had a typo, and the forcing function is cos t. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is written correctly, and I need to see which option aligns with the state equations.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is for q3', but again, none match.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the integral term is negative. Let me check again.

Wait, the original equation has a plus before the integral term, so when moving to the other side, it's negative.

Wait, perhaps it's better to double-check the state equations again.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral term is with a negative sign. So, the equation is:

v'' + a v' + b v - C ∫ v dt = sin t → then q2' would be -a q2 -b q1 + C q3 + sin t.

But the options don't seem to align with that either.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the state variables are defined differently. For example, perhaps q3 is the integral of v(t) multiplied by some function, or perhaps the
