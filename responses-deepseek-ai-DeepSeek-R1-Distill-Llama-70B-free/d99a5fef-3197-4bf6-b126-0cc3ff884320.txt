Okay, so I have this economics question about purchasing power and inflation. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking what happens to the purchasing power of money when there's inflation and what that means. The options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember from school that inflation has something to do with prices going up. But wait, how does that affect purchasing power? Purchasing power is about how much stuff you can buy with your money, right? So if inflation is rising, prices are increasing. That would mean each unit of money, like a dollar, can buy fewer things than before. So purchasing power must decrease because the same amount of money buys less.

Wait, let me think again. Inflation is when the general price level increases over time. So if your money doesn't grow, but prices do, you can't buy as much. Like, imagine you had $100 last year and could buy 10 burgers. Now, each burger costs more, say $12 each. So with $100, you can only buy 8 burgers. That means your purchasing power went down.

Looking at the options, option A says purchasing power increases, which doesn't make sense with inflation. So I can rule that out. Option B says it remains the same, but that's not right either because inflation changes things. Option C says purchasing power decreases, less goods can be boughtâ€”this aligns with my earlier thought. Option D says it fluctuates unpredictably, but inflation is more about a steady increase in prices, not random fluctuations.

So the correct answer should be option C. Purchasing power decreases, and you can buy fewer goods with the same amount of money.

The correct answer is C. When inflation occurs, the purchasing power of money decreases, meaning the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services.
