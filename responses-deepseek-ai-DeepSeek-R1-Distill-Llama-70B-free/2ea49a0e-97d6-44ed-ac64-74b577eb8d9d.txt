Okay, so I've got this problem here about a bookstore trying to maximize its profit per book. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the bookstore can buy 200 anthropology textbooks at $3 each. So the cost per book is $3. They plan to sell each for $15, but they know that for every 50 cent reduction in price, they can sell 10 more books. The question is asking for the price that maximizes the profit per book.

Hmm, profit per book, right. So profit per book would be the selling price minus the cost price. But wait, the number of books sold affects the total profit, but the question is specifically about per book profit. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are all different prices, so perhaps the idea is to find the optimal price point where each book's profit is maximized, considering that lowering the price increases the quantity sold, which in turn affects total revenue and costs. But wait, the problem says "maximizes its profit per book." So maybe it's about maximizing the profit per each book sold, not the total profit. Or is it about total profit? Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "What is the price that maximizes its profit per book?" So perhaps it's the price that gives the highest profit per individual book. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes in these problems, it's about total profit. Oh, but let's proceed.

So, the selling price starts at $15, and each $0.50 reduction increases the number sold by 10. Wait, but the initial number of books they have is 200. So selling more than 200 isn't possible, I guess, because they can't sell more than they have. Or wait, no, the way it's phrased is "the store believes it can sell these books at $15 each, but will be able to sell 10 more for every 50 cent reduction in the price." So maybe they start with selling all 200 at $15, but if they lower the price, they can sell more? But that doesn't make much sense because they have 200 books. Unless the initial 200 is the number they can get from the publisher, but they can perhaps sell more beyond 200 if they lower the price. But that might complicate things, and since the question is about per book profit, maybe it's better to think in terms of adjusting the price to sell a certain number of books, each contributing a certain profit.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with an equation. Let me think: Let’s define the price reduction as x times $0.50. So for every x, the price becomes 15 - 0.5x. And for each x, the number of books sold increases by 10x. Wait, but if x is the number of 50 cent reductions, then the price P = 15 - 0.5x, and the quantity sold Q = 200 + 10x.

Wait, but no, because selling more than 200 would require more books than the store has. The store only has 200 books. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe when they lower the price, they can sell more than 200? But that doesn't make sense because they only have 200. Alternatively, maybe the initial 200 is the maximum they can get from the publisher, so they can't sell more than 200. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the store can order as many as they want, but the cost is $3 each. So if they lower the price, they can sell more than 200, but they have to order more from the publisher at $3 each. But the problem says the bookstore can obtain 200 textbooks for $3 each. So maybe the initial 200 is what they have in stock, and they can't sell more than that. Or perhaps they can, but each additional book beyond 200 would cost them $3 each from the publisher. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the number of books they can sell is variable, but each book costs them $3, regardless of quantity.

Wait, but the problem says they can obtain 200 for $3 each. So maybe they have 200 books in stock, and if they lower the price, they can sell all 200. Alternatively, maybe they can sell more than 200 if they lower the price further, but that would require ordering more from the publisher. But I think the problem is considering that they can adjust the price to sell varying quantities, perhaps beyond 200 if needed. Let me try to model it.

So, let's let x be the number of 50-cent reductions. So the price per book would be P = 15 - 0.5x. The number of books sold would be Q = 200 + 10x. Wait, but that would mean that for each 50-cent reduction, they sell 10 more books. But if x is the number of such reductions, then Q increases by 10 per x. But wait, if x is 1, then P = 14.50, and Q = 210. But the store only has 200 books. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the store can order as many books as needed, so Q can go beyond 200. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on ordering more, so perhaps that's a possibility.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to clarify.

The problem states that the bookstore can obtain 200 textbooks for $3 each. So they have 200 books. So if they set a higher price, they might not sell all 200. But if they lower the price, they can sell more than 200, but they might have to order more from the publisher, each at $3. Or perhaps the problem is assuming that the number they can sell depends on the price, and they can sell up to 200 books, but beyond that, they can't. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the store can sell as many as they want, but their cost per book is $3 regardless of quantity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply that the store can sell Q books at a price of P = 15 - 0.5x, where x is the number of 50-cent reductions, and Q = 200 + 10x. But perhaps x can be any number, so Q could be more than 200, but the store can obtain those extra books from the publisher at $3 each.

But the problem is asking for the price that maximizes profit per book, so perhaps the profit per book is (P - 3), since each book costs $3. But if they adjust P, then the profit per book changes, and the number of books sold changes, which affects total profit, but the question is about per book.

Wait, but if they lower the price, the profit per book goes down, but they sell more books. So the total profit would be (P - 3) * Q. But the question is about maximizing profit per book, which would just be P - 3, so higher P would give higher profit per book. But that doesn't make sense because they can't sell all the books if the price is too high.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: "What is the price that maximizes its profit per book?" So perhaps it's the price per book that results in the maximum possible profit per book, considering that at higher prices, fewer books are sold, so maybe the profit per book isn't just P - 3, because if you can't sell all the books, perhaps the per-book profit is zero for unsold books. But the problem doesn't mention anything about unsold books, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the store can sell exactly Q books, where Q depends on the price, and each book sold contributes (P - 3) to profit. So the total profit is (P - 3) * Q. But the question is about maximizing profit per book, which would be (P - 3), but that would be maximized when P is as high as possible. But that can't be right because at higher prices, Q would be lower, but the per-book profit would be higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is about maximizing the total profit. But the question explicitly says "profit per book," so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the store can only sell the 200 books, so the number sold is fixed at 200, but by adjusting the price, they can affect how much they make per book. But that doesn't fit with the "sell 10 more for every 50 cent reduction." So perhaps the correct approach is to model the total profit as a function of x, the number of 50-cent reductions, and then find the x that maximizes total profit, and from that, find the optimal price. But then, the question is about profit per book, which would be (P - 3), where P is the selling price.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of total profit. Let's see.

Let x be the number of 50-cent reductions. So the price P = 15 - 0.5x.

The number of books sold Q = 200 + 10x.

Wait, but this would mean that for each 50-cent reduction, they sell 10 more books. But the store only has 200 books, unless they can order more. So perhaps, for the sake of this problem, we can assume that the store can sell up to 200 + 10x books, but the maximum they can have is 200 + 10x, but perhaps they can't sell more than that. Alternatively, perhaps the store can only sell 200 books, and lowering the price beyond a certain point doesn't increase sales beyond 200. Hmm, but the problem says they can sell 10 more for each 50-cent reduction, implying that they can sell more than 200 if they lower the price enough.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the store can sell all the books they have ordered, which is 200, but if they lower the price, they can sell more, but they have to order more from the publisher at $3 each. So for each 50-cent reduction, they can sell 10 more books, but each of those extra books costs $3. So the total cost would be 3*(200 + 10x), and revenue would be P*(200 + 10x), where P = 15 - 0.5x.

But the question is about maximizing profit per book, which would be (P - 3). So, if P increases, profit per book increases. But if P is higher, then Q is lower, but since the question is about per book, perhaps the maximum per book profit is when P is highest. But that can't be right, because when P is highest, they sell the fewest books, but the per-book profit is highest. But perhaps that's the case.

Wait, but if the store can only sell 200 books at $15 each, then the per-book profit is $12. If they lower the price by $0.50, they can sell 210 books, but their cost per book is $3, so profit per book would be (14.50 - 3) = $11.50. Wait, that's lower than $12. So the per-book profit is lower when the price is lower, even though they sell more books. So the maximum profit per book would be at the highest price point, which is $15, giving a per-book profit of $12. But that would mean the answer is E, $15. But let me check the options again. The options are A to J, and E is $15.

But wait, the problem says "the price that maximizes its profit per book." So if the per-book profit is (price - 3), then higher price gives higher per-book profit, regardless of how many you sell. So the maximum per-book profit would be when the price is highest, which is $15. So the answer would be E: $15.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive because in many business scenarios, the total profit is maximized at a certain price point where elasticities balance. But here, the question is specifically about per-book profit, not total profit.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. If the store sells each book for a higher price, each book's profit is higher. So even if they sell fewer books, each sold book contributes more to profit. So the maximum profit per book is when the price is highest possible. So the answer would be $15, option E.

But let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let's model the profit per book as a function of x, where x is the number of 50-cent reductions. So P = 15 - 0.5x. The profit per book is P - 3 = 12 - 0.5x. So as x increases, the profit per book decreases. Therefore, the maximum profit per book occurs when x is 0, so P = $15. So the answer is E.

Wait, but the options include E as $15, so that would be the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, the optimal price for maximum total profit isn't the highest price, but here it's about per-book profit, so it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider total profit, and the question is misworded. Let me try that approach just in case, to see if I get a different answer.

If I model total profit, then total revenue TR = P * Q = (15 - 0.5x) * (200 + 10x). The total cost TC is 3 * (200 + 10x). So total profit TP = TR - TC = (15 - 0.5x)(200 + 10x) - 3(200 + 10x).

Let me expand this:

TP = [15*200 + 15*10x - 0.5x*200 - 0.5x*10x] - [600 + 30x]

Calculating each term:

15*200 = 3000
15*10x = 150x
0.5x*200 = 100x
0.5x*10x = 5x²

So TR = 3000 + 150x - 100x -5x² = 3000 + 50x -5x²

TC = 600 + 30x

So TP = (3000 +50x -5x²) - (600 +30x) = 3000 -600 +50x -30x -5x² = 2400 +20x -5x²

Now, to find maximum profit, take derivative of TP with respect to x:

d(TP)/dx = 20 -10x

Set to zero: 20 -10x = 0 → x = 2.

So x=2. Then, P =15 -0.5*2 = 14 dollars. So the price would be $14, which is option G.

Wait, but this is under the assumption that the question is about total profit, not per-book profit. But the question specifically says "profit per book," so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about total profit, and the wording is a mistake. But I should stick to the question as written.

Wait, let me think again. If the question is about per-book profit, then it's (P - 3), which decreases as x increases. So maximum at x=0, P=15.

But in the total profit scenario, maximum occurs at x=2, P=14, which is option G.

But since the question is about per-book profit, the answer should be E: $15.

Wait, but let me check the options again. E is $15, which is the highest price. So that would make sense.

But I'm a bit confused because the problem mentions selling more books as the price decreases, which affects total profit, but not per-book profit.

Wait another thought: perhaps the per-book profit is calculated as total profit divided by the number of books sold. So in that case, per-book profit would be TP/Q.

So TP = (15 -0.5x -3) * (200 +10x) = (12 -0.5x)(200 +10x)

Which is 12*200 +12*10x -0.5x*200 -0.5x*10x = 2400 +120x -100x -5x² = 2400 +20x -5x².

So per-book profit would be TP/Q = (2400 +20x -5x²)/(200 +10x).

We can simplify this expression.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Denominator: 200 +10x = 10(20 +x)

Numerator: 2400 +20x -5x² = -5x² +20x +2400 = -5(x² -4x -480) = Not sure if it factors nicely.

Alternatively, let's write the per-book profit as:

( -5x² +20x +2400 ) / (10x +200 ) = ?

We can factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: Let's factor out -5: -5(x² -4x -480)

Denominator: 10(x +20)

Wait, maybe we can perform polynomial division or see if it simplifies.

Alternatively, let's take the derivative of this function to find its maximum.

Let f(x) = ( -5x² +20x +2400 ) / (10x +200 )

To find the maximum, take derivative f’(x) and set to zero.

Using quotient rule:

f’(x) = [ (denominator)(numerator derivative) - (numerator)(denominator derivative) ] / (denominator)^2

Numerator derivative: d/dx (-5x² +20x +2400) = -10x +20

Denominator derivative: d/dx (10x +200) =10

So,

f’(x) = [ (10x +200)(-10x +20) - (-5x² +20x +2400)(10) ] / (10x +200)^2

Let me compute numerator:

First term: (10x +200)(-10x +20) = 10x*(-10x) +10x*20 +200*(-10x) +200*20 = -100x² +200x -2000x +4000 = -100x² -1800x +4000

Second term: - (-5x² +20x +2400)*10 = 5x²*10 -20x*10 -2400*10 = 50x² -200x -24000

Wait, no: Wait the second term is subtracting the product, so it's:

- (numerator)(denominator derivative) = - [ (-5x² +20x +2400) *10 ] = - [ -50
