Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. "Rome the capital of Italy" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….
But the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department."
Edward A. Freeman, British historian and politician, The Chief Periods of European History, 1885

Okay, so I have this question about a passage by Edward A. Freeman, a British historian, from 1885. The question is asking about when Italy's connections to its history and traditions were most "fully snapped." The options are A through J, each referring to different events.

First, I'll try to understand the passage. Freeman is talking about the unification of Italy and how it affected the historical identity of places like Sicily and Rome. He mentions that while unification was a cause for rejoicing, it might have gone too far by erasing the distinct identities of regions like Sicily, which became just provinces instead of an independent kingdom.

The key part here is where he says that the ties with the past were "snapped" when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. That's a significant event because Rome, historically, had an "œcumenical position" and traditions, meaning it was a center of the church and had a broader, more universal role. By becoming the capital of a unified Italy, Rome's role changed from being a universal center to a national one, which Freeman seems to lament.

Looking at the options, the question is about when these connections were most fully snapped. So I need to find the event that symbolizes the breaking of these historical ties.

Option E says, "Italy's army entered Rome." That's exactly what the passage mentions. Freeman writes, "Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome." So that seems to be the answer.

Wait, but let me check other options to be sure. Option C is "Rome became the capital of Italy." That's also a major event, but the passage specifies the moment when the army entered Rome as the snapping point. Option I is "Italians liberated Rome," which is similar to E but phrased differently. The passage says "the army of Italy entered liberated Rome," so E is more precise.

Option A talks about Rome becoming the center of a dominion with metes and bounds, which refers to having defined borders, which is part of the change but not the exact snapping point. Option D is about Rome being a French department, which was under Napoleon, but Freeman is talking about the Italian unification, so that's a different event.

Option E is the direct cause mentioned in the text, so I think that's the correct answer.

The correct answer is E: Italy's army entered Rome.

Answer: E
