Question:

Although concurrent individual and group therapy may be necessary for some patients, many therapists do not support it. One of the major concerns is that

Options:

A: screening procedures for patients may be ignored because a therapist is recommending the group experience
B: patients beginning with a group, finding additional sources of support, tend to terminate the individual therapy prematurely
C: patients wait until they are in their individual sessions before reacting to what occurred in the group
D: patients become reliant on group therapy, ignoring individual therapy sessions
E: patients use their two therapists’ words to refute group members’ suggestions for behavior change
F: therapists find it hard to manage both individual and group sessions for the same patient

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychotherapy, specifically dealing with the concerns therapists have when a patient is undergoing both individual and group therapy at the same time. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about one of the major concerns therapists have regarding concurrent individual and group therapy. The options are A through F, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should understand what concurrent therapy means. Concurrent here implies that the patient is seeing one therapist for individual sessions and another (maybe) for group therapy, or perhaps the same therapist is handling both. But I think in many cases, especially in training or certain settings, a patient might have one therapist for individual and another leading the group. Either way, the concern is about how these two forms of therapy might interact.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Screening procedures may be ignored because a therapist is recommending group experience. Hmm, that suggests that therapists might skip the necessary screening steps when they think group therapy would be good. I'm not sure if that's the primary concern. Screening is more about selecting appropriate patients for group therapy, but I don't see a direct link to why concurrent therapy is problematic.

Option B: Patients start with a group, find support, and then stop individual therapy early. That could be a concern. If the group provides enough support, maybe the patient feels they don't need individual sessions anymore. But is that a major issue therapists worry about? I'm not certain. It seems possible, but I'm not sure if it's the main concern.

Option C: Patients wait until individual sessions to react to group events. So, maybe in group therapy, they don't express their feelings but save them for individual sessions. That could cause issues because the group setting is meant for processing there. If they don't engage in the group, the group's effectiveness might be reduced. But does this lead to a problem for the therapist? Maybe it's more about the patient's progress, but I'm not sure if this is the main concern regarding concurrent therapy.

Option D: Patients rely too much on group therapy and ignore individual sessions. Similar to B, but here it's about ignoring individual therapy entirely. This could be a problem because individual therapy often addresses personal issues in depth. If they neglect it, their progress might suffer. But again, is this the major concern therapists have about concurrent therapy?

Option E: Patients use their two therapists' words to refute group members' suggestions. Oh, this sounds like triangulation or playing one against the other. For example, a patient might say, "My individual therapist said I shouldn't do that," to dismiss advice from group members. That could hinder the group dynamic because it undermines peer feedback, which is a key component of group therapy. This seems like a significant issue because it can disrupt the group's effectiveness and the therapeutic relationship.

Option F: Therapists find it hard to manage both types of sessions. Managing both might be challenging, especially if the patient is seeing two different therapists. Coordination between individual and group therapists could be tough, but I'm not sure if this is the main concern. The question is about the patients' behavior or the therapy process rather than the therapist's workload or management.

Now, thinking about what I've learned before, one of the main issues with concurrent therapies is the potential for the patient to use one therapy to avoid issues in the other. For instance, in group therapy, a patient might not engage fully because they're processing everything in individual sessions. But wait, that's more like option C.

Alternatively, if a patient has two therapists, they might play them against each other. For example, if one therapist says something, the patient might use that to argue against what the group or the other therapist says. This can create confusion and undermine the therapy process.

Wait, but looking back, option E says patients use their two therapists' words to refute group members' suggestions. So, in a group setting, when other members suggest something, the patient might say, "But my individual therapist said something different," thus dismissing the group's input. This can be problematic because group therapy relies on peer interaction and support. If a patient is using their individual therapist's words to avoid taking the group's feedback seriously, it can hinder their progress and the group's dynamics.

So, putting it all together, option E seems to point out a specific issue where the patient uses the individual therapist's words against the group, which can impede the group therapy's effectiveness.

Alternatively, I'm trying to remember if there's a concept called "splitting" in psychotherapy, where a patient might idealize one therapist and devalue another, causing conflict. But I'm not sure if that's directly related here.

Wait, another thought: in group therapy, the idea is that the group members learn from each other and support each other. If a patient brings up their individual therapist's advice to counter the group's suggestions, it can create a power dynamic where the individual therapist's opinion is seen as more authoritative, thus undermining the group's collective input.

So, yes, option E seems to capture a significant concern. It's about the patient using the individual therapist's words to refute the group, which can disrupt the group process and make it less effective.

I think the other options, while possible, don't capture the essence of the main concern as directly as E does. So I'm leaning towards E as the correct answer.

The question asks about a major concern therapists have regarding concurrent individual and group therapy. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed:

- **Option A** suggests screening procedures might be ignored, but this is more about patient selection for group therapy and not directly related to the concerns of concurrent therapy.
- **Option B** and **Option D** both address patients potentially stopping or ignoring individual therapy, which could be issues but may not be the primary concern therapists have about concurrent therapy.
- **Option C** highlights patients processing group events in individual sessions, which could reduce the effectiveness of group therapy but may not be the main issue.
- **Option F** discusses therapists' difficulty managing both therapies, but the question focuses on patient behavior and therapeutic dynamics rather than therapist workload.

**Option E** stands out as it describes a scenario where patients use their individual therapist's words to refute group members' suggestions, undermining the group dynamic and hindering the therapeutic process. This is a significant concern because group therapy relies on peer interaction and feedback, and such behavior can disrupt its effectiveness.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E**
