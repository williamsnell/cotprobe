Okay, so I've got this question here about partners sharing profits. Let me read it again. Jim and Joe are partners and they share profits and losses equally. Last year, their firm's net profit was $28,400. The question is, how much does each partner get?

Hmm. Right, so I remember that when partners share profits equally, each one gets a 50% share. Because there are two of them, right? So the total profit is split down the middle.

Wait, so the total is $28,400. If they split it equally, each would get half of that. Let me do the math. Half of 28,400 is... let's see. 28,400 divided by 2. 28 divided by 2 is 14, and 400 divided by 2 is 200. So 14,200 each?

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is $16,800 each. No, that can't be. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: 28,400 divided by 2 is indeed 14,200. So each partner gets $14,200.

Looking back at the options, let me see. Option G is $14,200, and option H is $18,933. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I miss any other factors? Like, are there any other considerations, such as capital contributions or different ratios? The question says they share equally, so no, it's a 50-50 split. So yeah, each gets half.

The total net profit is $28,400, and since Jim and Joe share profits equally, each partner receives half of the total profit. 

$28,400 divided by 2 equals $14,200. Therefore, each partner's profit is $14,200.

The correct answer is G.
