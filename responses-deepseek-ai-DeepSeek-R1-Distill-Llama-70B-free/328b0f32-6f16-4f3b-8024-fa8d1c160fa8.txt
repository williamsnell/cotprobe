Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mrs. Kaplan buying a coffee table on an installment plan. I need to find the annual interest rate she paid. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the coffee table costs $200. She pays $35 down, which means she doesn't have to pay that part in installments. Then there are 9 monthly payments of $20 each. I think the first thing I should figure out is how much she's paying in total, including the down payment and the installments, and then determine how much of that is interest.

So the down payment is $35. The monthly payments are 9 times $20 each. Let me calculate that: 9 * 20 = 180. So the total amount she pays is 35 + 180 = $215. But the coffee table only costs $200, so the extra $15 must be the interest she's paying. 

Wait, but wait a minute. Is it that simple? Because she's paying over 9 months, so maybe I should think about the time value of money here. The interest isn't just a flat $15 because the payments are spread out. Oh right, this is an installment plan, so it's probably an installment loan, where each payment includes both principal and interest.

I remember that the interest rate in such cases can be calculated using the concept of present value of an annuity. The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r], where PV is the present value, PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this problem, the present value (PV) should be the amount financed. She paid $35 down, so the amount she's financing is $200 - $35 = $165. So PV is $165, and the monthly payment (PMT) is $20. The number of periods (n) is 9 months.

So I can set up the equation as:
165 = 20 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-9)/r]

I need to solve for r here. Hmm, solving this equation for r isn't straightforward algebraically because r is in both the numerator and the denominator in a way that makes it nonlinear. I think I'll need to use an iterative approach or maybe try plugging in the options to see which one fits.

Wait, the question asks for the annual interest rate. So whatever r I find, I'll have to multiply by 12 to get the annual rate, assuming it's a monthly rate.

Let me consider the options given. They range from 15% to 30%, so the monthly rate would be between 1.25% (15/12) to 2.5% (30/12). Let's list the options and their corresponding monthly rates:

Option A: 15% annual → 1.25% monthly
Option B: 21.8% → ~1.816% monthly
Option C: 17.5% → ~1.458% monthly
Option D: 19.2% → ~1.6% monthly
Option E: 30% → 2.5% monthly
Option F: 25% → ~2.083% monthly
Option G: 24% → 2% monthly
Option H: 27.3% → ~2.275% monthly
Option I: 22.5% → 1.875% monthly
Option J: 20% → 1.666...% monthly

I can try plugging these into the present value formula to see which one gives PV close to $165.

Let me pick a few options to test. Let's try option J first since 20% is a common rate. So monthly rate r = 20%/12 ≈ 0.0166667 or 1.66667%.

Plugging into the formula: PV = 20 * [(1 - (1 + 0.0166667)^-9 ) / 0.0166667 ]

First, calculate (1 + 0.0166667)^9. Let me compute that step by step.

0.0166667 is 1/60. So (61/60)^9. Let me compute that:

(61/60)^1 = 1.0166667
^2 ≈ 1.0337880
^3 ≈ 1.0511100
^4 ≈ 1.0687690
^5 ≈ 1.0866530
^6 ≈ 1.1051120
^7 ≈ 1.1240400
^8 ≈ 1.1434060
^9 ≈ 1.1631850

So (1 + r)^9 ≈ 1.163185.

Then (1 - 1/(1.163185)) = 1 - (1/1.163185) ≈ 1 - 0.8596 ≈ 0.1404.

Then 0.1404 / 0.0166667 ≈ 8.42.

So PV = 20 * 8.42 ≈ 168.4. But our PV should be $165. So 168.4 is higher than 165, meaning the rate is a bit higher than 1.6667% monthly (which is 20% annual). Because a higher rate would reduce the present value. Wait, because if the interest rate is higher, each payment's present value is lower, so the total PV would be less.

Wait, let me think. So when I tested 1.6667% (20% annual), I got a PV of ~168.4, which is higher than $165. So to get a lower PV, we need a higher rate. So the correct rate must be higher than 1.6667% per month.

So let's try the next higher option. Let's see, option D is 19.2% annual, which is 1.6% monthly. Let me plug that in.

r = 19.2%/12 = 0.016 or 1.6%.

Compute (1 + 0.016)^9.

Again, let's compute step by step:

(1.016)^1 = 1.016
^2 ≈ 1.032256
^3 ≈ 1.048596
^4 ≈ 1.065092
^5 ≈ 1.081992
^6 ≈ 1.099792
^7 ≈ 1.118476
^8 ≈ 1.137992
^9 ≈ 1.158112

So (1.016)^9 ≈ 1.158112.

Now, 1/(1.158112) ≈ 0.8633.

1 - 0.8633 ≈ 0.1367.

Divide by 0.016: 0.1367 / 0.016 ≈ 8.5375.

PV = 20 * 8.5375 ≈ 170.75.

Hmm, that's even higher than before, so this can't be right. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because a lower rate (1.6%) should give a higher PV. Wait wait no, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, the correct rate should be higher than 1.6667% (since when I tried 1.6667%, I got PV=168.4, which is higher than 165). So I need a higher rate than 1.6667% per month, which would make the PV lower.

Wait, perhaps I should try a higher rate. Let's try option D: 19.2% annual rate, which is 1.6% monthly. Wait, no, that's lower than 1.6667% (since 1.6% is less than 1.6667%). So that can't be. Wait, no, 19.2% is 1.6% per month, which is lower than 1.6667% (20% annual). So if I tried D, that's 1.6%, which would give a higher PV, which isn't what I want. Because I need a PV of 165, and at 20% (1.6667%), the PV was 168.4. I need a higher rate to bring the PV down to 165.

Wait, perhaps I should try a higher rate, like option H: annual rate 27.3%, which is 2.275% monthly. Let's compute that.

r = 27.3% / 12 = 0.02275.

Compute (1 + 0.02275)^9.

Let me compute step by step:

1.02275^1 = 1.02275
^2 ≈ 1.02275 * 1.02275 ≈ 1.04586
^3 ≈ 1.04586 * 1.02275 ≈ let's see:

1.04586 * 1.02275:

1.04586 * 1 = 1.04586
1.04586 * 0.02 = 0.020917
1.04586 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.002878. So total ≈ 1.04586 + 0.020917 + 0.002878 ≈ 1.06965.

^4: 1.06965 * 1.02275 ≈ Let's compute 1.06965 * 1.02275.

1.06965 * 1 = 1.06965
1.06965 * 0.02 = 0.021393
1.06965 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.002940. So total ≈ 1.06965 + 0.021393 + 0.00294 ≈ 1.094.

Wait, maybe it's quicker to use a calculator-like approach, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or another approximation, but maybe I should proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity correctly, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the amount financed is $165, and she's paying 9 monthly payments of $20. So the total payments are 9*20=180. So the interest is 180-165=15, which is 15/165= ~9.09% over 9 months, which would annualize to about (9.09% * 12/9)= 12.12%. But wait, that's not considering the timing of the payments. Because with an installment plan, each payment includes interest, so the simple interest approach might not work here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the simple interest formula for each period. But I think that's not the right approach since the payments are amortized.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a simple loan with each payment being $20, starting immediately (since it's an installment plan, perhaps the first payment is made at the end of the first month). So the present value of the 9 payments of $20 is $165.

Using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula again, I can write:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r

We have PV = $165, PMT = $20, n=9.

We can rearrange to solve for r.

But solving this equation algebraically is tough because r is in the denominator and exponent. So perhaps using trial and error with the options is the way to go.

Let me try option J: 20% annual rate. So r = 20% / 12 ≈ 0.0166667.

Compute the denominator [1 - (1 + 0.0166667)^-9 ] / 0.0166667.

(1.0166667)^9 ≈ 1.1632 (from earlier calculation). So 1/(1.1632) ≈ 0.8596.

1 - 0.8596 ≈ 0.1404.

0.1404 / 0.0166667 ≈ 8.42.

So PV = 20 * 8.42 ≈ 168.44, which is higher than 165. So the interest rate must be higher than 20% annually because a higher rate would lower the PV.

Wait, because when r increases, the denominator increases, making each term smaller, so the present value decreases. So if with 20% (monthly 1.6667%) the PV is 168.44, which is higher than 165, I need a higher rate to bring the PV down to 165.

Let me try option D: 19.2% annual rate. Wait no, 19.2% is 1.6% monthly, which is lower than 1.6667%, so that would give a higher PV, which is not what I want. So perhaps I should try a higher rate.

Looking back, option H is 27.3% annual, which is 2.275% monthly. Let's compute that.

r = 0.02275.

Compute (1 + 0.02275)^9:

I'll approximate this calculation step by step.

1.02275^1 = 1.02275
^2 ≈ 1.02275 * 1.02275 ≈ 1.04586
^3 ≈ 1.04586 * 1.02275 ≈ let's compute 1.04586 * 1.02275.

1.04586 * 1 = 1.04586
1.04586 * 0.02 = 0.0209172
1.04586 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.0028778
Adding them gives approximately 1.04586 + 0.0209172 + 0.0028778 ≈ 1.06965.

^4: 1.06965 * 1.02275 ≈ 1.06965 * 1 = 1.06965
1.06965 * 0.02 = 0.021393
1.06965 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.002940
Adding: 1.06965 + 0.021393 + 0.002940 ≈ 1.094.

^5: 1.094 * 1.02275 ≈ 1.094 * 1 = 1.094
1.094 * 0.02 = 0.02188
1.094 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.0030085
Total ≈ 1.094 + 0.02188 + 0.0030085 ≈ 1.119.

^6: 1.119 * 1.02275 ≈ 1.119 * 1 = 1.119
1.119 * 0.02 = 0.02238
1.119 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.003075
Total ≈ 1.119 + 0.02238 + 0.003075 ≈ 1.1445.

^7: 1.1445 * 1.02275 ≈ let's compute:
1.1445 * 1 = 1.1445
1.1445 * 0.02 = 0.02289
1.1445 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.003146
Total ≈ 1.1445 + 0.02289 + 0.003146 ≈ 1.1705.

^8: 1.1705 * 1.02275 ≈ 1.1705 * 1 = 1.1705
1.1705 * 0.02 = 0.02341
1.1705 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.003219
Total ≈ 1.1705 + 0.02341 + 0.003219 ≈ 1.1971.

^9: 1.1971 * 1.02275 ≈ 1.1971 * 1 = 1.1971
1.1971 * 0.02 = 0.023942
1.1971 * 0.00275 ≈ 0.003292
Total ≈ 1.1971 + 0.023942 + 0.003292 ≈ 1.2243.

So (1.02275)^9 ≈ 1.2243.

Now, 1/(1.2243) ≈ 0.8168.

1 - 0.8168 ≈ 0.1832.

Divide by 0.02275: 0.1832 / 0.02275 ≈ 8.05.

So PV = 20 * 8.05 ≈ 161. So that's $161, which is below $165. So this rate is too high.

Wait, so at 27.3% annual rate (2.275% monthly), the PV is $161, which is less than the $165 needed. So the correct rate must be between 20% and 27.3% annually.

Now, let's try option I: 22.5% annually. So r = 22.5% /12 = 0.01875 or 1.875% monthly.

Compute (1.01875)^9.

Let me compute step by step:

1.01875^1 = 1.01875
^2 = 1.01875 * 1.01875 ≈ 1.0378516
^3 ≈ 1.0378516 * 1.01875 ≈ let's compute:

1.0378516 * 1 = 1.0378516
1.0378516 * 0.01875 ≈ 0.019453
Total ≈ 1.057305.

^4: 1.057305 * 1.01875 ≈ 1.057305 * 1 = 1.057305
1.057305 * 0.01875 ≈ 0.019832
Total ≈ 1.077137.

^5: 1.077137 * 1.01875 ≈ 1.077137 + (1.077137 * 0.01875)
1.077137 * 0.01875 ≈ 0.020194
Total ≈ 1.097331.

^6: 1.097331 * 1.01875 ≈ 1.097331 + (1.097331 * 0.01875)
1.097331 * 0.01875 ≈ 0.020573
Total ≈ 1.117904.

^7: 1.117904 * 1.01875 ≈ 1.117904 + (1.117904 * 0.01875)
1.117904 * 0.01875 ≈ 0.02094
Total ≈ 1.138844.

^8: 1.138844 * 1.01875 ≈ 1.138844 + (1.138844 * 0.01875)
1.138844 * 0.01875 ≈ 0.02136
Total ≈ 1.160204.

^9: 1.160204 * 1.01875 ≈ let's compute:

1.160204 *
