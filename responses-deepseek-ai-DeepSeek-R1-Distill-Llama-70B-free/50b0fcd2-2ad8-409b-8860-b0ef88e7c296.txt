Alright, so I've got this inventory problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Okay, the Magic-Voice Radio Supply Company is taking inventory for their #84A tubes. They have various purchases throughout the year, and some inventory at the beginning. The question is asking me to calculate the value of the ending inventory using three different methods: Average Cost, FIFO, and LIFO. And then choose the option that matches all three values.

First, let me list out the data provided. The beginning inventory on January 1 is 800 tubes at $0.252 each. Then there are four purchases:

- March 3: 2000 tubes at $0.247
- June 5: 1500 tubes at $0.262
- October 13: 900 tubes at $0.27
- November 25: 600 tubes at $0.272

The total quantity on hand at the end is 1700 tubes. So I need to calculate the cost using each method.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right, the beginning inventory plus all the purchases minus what's sold equals the ending inventory. But here, I don't have sales data. Hmm, so perhaps the problem is structured so that all the purchases are part of the cost of goods available for sale, and the ending inventory is the remainder after some assumed sales.

Wait, the ending quantity is 1700. So let me calculate the total available for sale.

Total available = beginning inventory + all purchases.

So:

800 + 2000 = 2800

2800 + 1500 = 4300

4300 + 900 = 5200

5200 + 600 = 5800 tubes available.

But ending inventory is 1700, so the number of tubes sold must be 5800 - 1700 = 4100 tubes.

So, when calculating FIFO and LIFO, the cost of goods sold is based on the order in which the tubes were purchased, and the ending inventory is what's left.

But for the average cost method, it's the average of the entire cost.

Let me tackle each method one by one.

Starting with (a) Average Cost.

Average cost is calculated by taking the total cost of all tubes available for sale, divided by the number of tubes available. Then multiply by the ending inventory quantity.

So, total cost = (beginning inventory cost) + sum of all purchase costs.

Compute each:

- Beginning: 800 * $0.252 = let's calculate that. 800 * 0.252 = $201.60
- March 3: 2000 * 0.247 = 2000 * 0.247. Let me compute 2000 * 0.2 is 400, 0.04 is 80, 0.007 is 14. So 400 +80=480 +14=494. So $494.00
- June 5: 1500 * 0.262. Let's compute 1500 * 0.2 is 300, 0.06 is 90, 0.002 is 3. So 300+90=390 +3=393. So $393.00
- October 13: 900 * 0.27. 900 *0.2 is 180, 0.07 is 63. So 180+63=243. So $243.00
- November 25: 600 * 0.272. 600 *0.2=120, 0.07=42, 0.002=1.2. So 120+42=162 +1.2=163.2. So $163.20.

Now sum all these costs:

201.60 + 494.00 = 695.60

695.60 + 393.00 = 1088.60

1088.60 + 243.00 = 1331.60

1331.60 + 163.20 = 1494.80

So total cost is $1,494.80.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations because when I add the beginning cost and the four purchases, I get:

201.60 (beginning) 

+494 (March) = 695.60

+393 (June) = 1088.60

+243 (October) = 1331.60

+163.2 (November) = 1494.80. Yes, correct.

Total tubes available: 5800.

So average cost per tube is 1494.80 / 5800. Let me compute that.

1494.80 / 5800.

Hmm, let's see. 5800 is 5.8e3. Let me compute 1494.8 / 5800.

Let me compute 1494.8 ÷ 5800.

Alternatively, 1494.8 / 5800 = (approx) 0.2576 dollars per tube.

Wait, let's compute accurately:

5800 * 0.25 = 1450.

So 1494.8 is 44.8 above 1450.

So 44.8 /5800 = 0.00772 approximately.

So 0.25 + 0.00772 = 0.25772. So approximately 0.2577 per tube.

Now, ending inventory is 1700 tubes. So total cost is 1700 * 0.2577.

Compute 1700 * 0.25 = 425.

1700 * 0.0077 = let's see, 0.0077 * 1700.

0.007 *1700=11.9, 0.0007*1700=1.19, so total 13.09. So 425 +13.09 = 438.09.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 1494.80 /5800 = (149480 / 5800) cents.

Wait, 5800 goes into 149480 how many times.

5800 * 25 = 145000.

So 145000, subtract from 149480, gives 4480.

4480 /5800 = 448/580 = approx 0.7724.

So 25.7724 cents per tube, approximately $0.257724.

So 1700 * 0.257724 = ?

Let me compute 1700 * 0.25 = 425.

1700 * 0.007724 = ?

0.007724 *1700 = (0.007 *1700) + (0.000724 *1700).

0.007 *1700 = 11.9.

0.000724 *1700 = 1.2308.

So 11.9 +1.2308 = 13.1308.

So 425 +13.1308 = 438.1308. So approximately $438.13.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see the average cost for option B is 439.60, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the average cost more accurately.

Total cost is $1,494.80.

Total quantity = 5,800.

So average cost per unit is 1494.80 /5800.

Let me compute this division accurately.

5800 into 1494.80.

Wait, 5800 * 0.25 = 1450.

So 1494.80 -1450 = 44.80.

So 44.80 /5800 = 0.007725 (since 44.8 /5800 = 0.007725 approx).

So 0.25 +0.007725 = 0.257725 per tube.

Multiply by 1700:

1700 * 0.257725.

Let me compute this.

1700 *0.2 = 340.

1700 *0.05 = 85 → 340+85=425.

1700 *0.007725 = ?

0.007725 can be thought as 0.007 + 0.000725.

1700 *0.007 = 11.9.

1700 *0.000725 = 1.2325.

So 11.9 +1.2325 =13.1325.

So 425 +13.1325=438.1325. Approximately $438.13.

Looking at the options, I don't see exactly this. Let me check the options again.

Option B: (a) $439.60, (b) $459.60, (c) $424.90.

Option D: (a) $441.20, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total cost. Let me recheck the individual costs.

Compute each cost again:

Beginning inventory: 800 * 0.252.

0.252 *800: 0.25*800=200, 0.002*800=1.6. So 201.60.

March purchase: 2000 *0.247.

2000 *0.2=400, 0.04*2000=80, 0.007*2000=14. So 400+80+14=494.00. Correct.

June:1500 *0.262.

0.2*1500=300, 0.06*1500=90, 0.002*1500=3. So 393.00.

October:900 *0.27.

0.2*900=180, 0.07*900=63. So 243.00.

November:600 *0.272.

0.2*600=120, 0.07*600=42, 0.002*600=1.2. So 120+42+1.2=163.2.

Adding all of these: 201.6 +494=695.6; +393=1088.6; +243=1331.6; +163.2=1494.8. Correct.

So the average cost is 1494.8 /5800 = 0.2577 per unit. 1700 *0.2577=438.13.

But none of the options exactly have 438.13 for part (a). Let's look at the options:

Option B: (a) 439.60. Hmm, that's higher.

Option F: (a)436.40.

Option H: (a)437.60.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total cost.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, maybe the beginning inventory is part of the cost of goods available for sale, but the average cost method averages the total cost including beginning inventory.

Wait, no, that's correct. The average cost is total cost (including beginning inventory) divided by total quantity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the beginning inventory's cost is part of the average, along with the purchases.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So my calculation should be accurate.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the average cost more precisely.

1494.8 /5800 = ?

Let me compute 149480 /5800.

5800 * 25 = 145000.

149480-145000 =4480.

So 4480 /5800 = 0.7724.

So 25 + 0.7724 =25.7724 cents per tube, which is $0.257724 per tube.

1700 *0.257724 = ?

1700 *0.25 =425.

1700 *0.007724 =?

Let me compute 1700 *0.007724.

0.007724 *1700:

Compute 1700 * 0.007 =11.9.

1700 *0.000724 =1.2308.

So 11.9 +1.2308 =13.1308.

So total is 425 +13.1308=438.1308, which is $438.13.

Looking at the options, the closest to $438.13 is option B: (a) $439.60, which is higher, and option H: (a) $437.60, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total cost. Let me check again.

Wait, the beginning inventory is 800 units at 0.252, which is 201.6.

March:2000 *0.247=494.

June:1500 *0.262=393.

October:900 *0.27=243.

November:600 *0.272=163.2.

Sum:201.6 +494=695.6.

695.6 +393=1088.6.

1088.6 +243=1331.6.

1331.6 +163.2=1494.8. Correct.

Hmm. So maybe the options are rounded differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each part again, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the way the average is calculated is different. Wait, some methods use a simple average, but perhaps the average cost is computed as the total cost divided by total quantity, which is what I did.

So perhaps the correct value is approximately $438.13, but the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: a) 439.60

Option D: a)441.20

Option E: a)435.80

Option F: a)436.40

Option G: a)438.00

Wait, option G has (a) 438.00. That's very close. But my calculation is 438.13, which would round to 438.13, so approximately 438.13. So perhaps option G is correct for (a), but let's check the other parts.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to calculate FIFO and LIFO, and see which option matches when considering all three.

So moving on to (b) FIFO.

FIFO assumes that the first tubes purchased are the first ones sold.

So, to find the cost of the ending inventory, we need to determine which lots are left after selling 4100 tubes.

The order of purchases is:

1. Beginning inventory:800 @0.252

2. March 3:2000 @0.247

3. June 5:1500 @0.262

4. October 13:900 @0.27

5. November 25:600 @0.272.

So, total available:5800.

Sold:4100, so remaining:1700.

We'll take from the earliest lots first.

Start with the beginning inventory:800.

If we sell 4100, we first take all from the beginning (800), then March (2000), then June (1500), etc.

So, let's see:

Sold:

- All 800 from beginning.

- 2000 from March.

- Now, we've sold 800+2000=2800. We need to sell 4100, so we have 4100-2800=1300 more to sell.

Next is the June lot:1500. But we only need 1300 more, so we take 1300 from June.

Thus, the remaining inventory is:

June lot:1500 -1300=200 left.

October lot:900 all remaining.

November lot:600 all remaining.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the ending inventory is 1700, which is after selling 4100.

So, the remaining is 1700, which would be the last 1700 tubes in the order they were purchased.

Wait, FIFO says the earliest purchased are sold first. So the ending inventory would be the most recent purchases.

So, to find the cost of the ending inventory:

We need to see which lots are left. So:

Total available:5800.

We sell 4100, so the last 1700 purchased would be the ones remaining.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as layers.

After beginning, the layers are:

March:2000

June:1500

October:900

November:600.

So, when selling 4100, the first 800 are from beginning, then 2000 from March, then 1300 from June.

So, the remaining inventory would be:

June:1500-1300=200.

Plus October:900.

Plus November:600.

Wait, that's 200+900+600=1700. Correct.

So the ending inventory comes from:

200 from June @0.262,

900 from October @0.27,

600 from November @0.272.

Now, compute the total cost for each of these.

200 *0.262 =52.4

900 *0.27=243

600 *0.272=163.2

Total cost:52.4 +243=295.4 +163.2=458.6.

Wait, that's $458.60. So FIFO value is $458.60.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: (b)459.60

Option H: (b)457.60

Option J: (b)459.

Wait, my calculation is 458.60. But none of the options have exactly that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the remaining quantities.

Wait, let me recheck.

When you have 4100 sold:

- 800 from beginning.

- 2000 from March.

- 4100-800-2000=1300 from June.

So, June's remaining is 1500-1300=200.

Then, October and November are untouched. So 900 and 600.

So yes, the ending inventory is 200 +900 +600=1700.

So their costs are correct.

200 *0.262=52.4.

900 *0.27=243.

600 *0.272=163.2.

Total:52.4+243=295.4; 295.4+163.2=458.6.

So FIFO is $458.60.

Looking at the options, option B's FIFO is $459.60, which is higher.

Option J's FIFO is $459.00.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the math again.

200 *0.262: 0.2*200=40, 0.06*200=12, 0.002*200=0.4. So 40+12=52 +0.4=52.4. Correct.

900 *0.27: 0.2*900=180, 0.07*900=63. So 180+63=243. Correct.

600 *0.272: 0.2*600=120, 0.07*600=42, 0.002*600=1.2. So 120+42=162 +1.2=163.2. Correct.

So sum is 52.4+243=295.4 +163.2=458.6.

Thus, FIFO is $458.60.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B has (b)459.60.

Option J has (b)459.00.

Option F has (b)456.40.

Hmm, none
