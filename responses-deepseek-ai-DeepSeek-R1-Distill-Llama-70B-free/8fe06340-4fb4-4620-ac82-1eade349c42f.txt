Okay, so I've got this problem about average rate of change in cost for producing compasses. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that the cost function is K = F(i) = 3√i, where i is the number of items produced. I need to find the average rate of change from i=25 to i=100 (part a) and from i=25 to i=225 (part b).

Wait, what's average rate of change again? Oh right, it's like the slope between two points on the function. The formula is (F(i2) - F(i1))/(i2 - i1). So I need to calculate F at i2 and i1 for each part and then plug them into this formula.

Let me start with part (a), from i=25 to i=100.

First, compute F(25) and F(100). F(i) is 3 times the square root of i. So F(25) = 3 * sqrt(25). Sqrt of 25 is 5, so 3*5=15. Then F(100) is 3*sqrt(100). Sqrt of 100 is 10, so 3*10=30.

Now, the change in cost is F(100) - F(25) = 30 -15 =15. The change in the number of items is 100 -25 =75. So the average rate of change is 15/75. Let me compute that: 15 divided by 75 equals 0.2. So that's $0.20 per unit for part (a).

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, F(i) is 3√i, so yes, that's correct.

Now part (b), from i=25 to i=225.

Again, compute F(25) and F(225). I already have F(25)=15. F(225) is 3*sqrt(225). Sqrt of 225 is 15, so 3*15=45.

Change in cost is 45-15=30. Change in i is 225-25=200. So average rate is 30/200. Let's see, 30 divided by 200 is 0.15. So $0.15 per unit for part (b).

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake here. Oh no, wait, 30/200 is 0.15. Yeah, that's right.

So part (a) is 0.20, part (b) is 0.15.

Now looking at the options. Let me check each option.

Option A: 0.15 from 25-100, 0.20 from 25-225. No, that's the opposite of what I got.

Option B: 0.10 and 0.30. Doesn't fit.

Option C: 0.40 and 0.10. No.

Option D: 0.25 and 0.20. Not matching.

Option E: 0.30 and 0.05. No.

Option F: 0.22 and 0.18. Doesn't match.

Option G: 0.35 and 0.25. No.

Option H: 0.18 and 0.12. No.

Option I: 0.20 from 25-100, 0.15 from 25-225. Oh wait, that's exactly what I got.

Wait, no, I got part (a) as 0.20 and part (b) as 0.15. So option I is (a) 0.20, (b) 0.15. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking again, option I says (a) 0.20, (b) 0.15. So that's the right answer.

Wait, but I thought I had part (a) at 0.20 and part (b) at 0.15, so option I matches. But let me make sure I didn't get the options mixed up.

Looking back, the options are:

I: $.20 per unit from 25 to 100 items, $.15 per unit from 25 to 225 items.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be option I.

To solve the problem, we calculate the average rate of change in cost using the formula:

\[
\text{Average rate of change} = \frac{\Delta K}{\Delta i} = \frac{F(i_2) - F(i_1)}{i_2 - i_1}
\]

where \( F(i) = 3\sqrt{i} \). 

### Part (a): From \( i = 25 \) to \( i = 100 \)
1. Compute \( F(25) \):  
   \[
   F(25) = 3\sqrt{25} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
2. Compute \( F(100) \):  
   \[
   F(100) = 3\sqrt{100} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
3. Calculate the change in cost:  
   \[
   \Delta K = F(100) - F(25) = 30 - 15 = 15
   \]
4. Calculate the change in the number of items:  
   \[
   \Delta i = 100 - 25 = 75
   \]
5. Compute the average rate of change:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta K}{\Delta i} = \frac{15}{75} = 0.20 \, \text{per unit}
   \]

### Part (b): From \( i = 25 \) to \( i = 225 \)
1. Compute \( F(25) \):  
   \[
   F(25) = 3\sqrt{25} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
2. Compute \( F(225) \):  
   \[
   F(225) = 3\sqrt{225} = 3 \times 15 = 45
   \]
3. Calculate the change in cost:  
   \[
   \Delta K = F(225) - F(25) = 45 - 15 = 30
   \]
4. Calculate the change in the number of items:  
   \[
   \Delta i = 225 - 25 = 200
   \]
5. Compute the average rate of change:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta K}{\Delta i} = \frac{30}{200} = 0.15 \, \text{per unit}
   \]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The average rate of change from \( i = 25 \) to \( i = 100 \) is \( 0.20 \, \text{per unit} \).
- The average rate of change from \( i = 25 \) to \( i = 225 \) is \( 0.15 \, \text{per unit} \).

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**I: $.20 per unit from 25 to 100 items, $.15 per unit from 25 to 225 items.**
