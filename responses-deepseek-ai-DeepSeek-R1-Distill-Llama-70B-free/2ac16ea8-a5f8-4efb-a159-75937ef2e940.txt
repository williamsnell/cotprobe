Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay and half-lives. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. The question says the half-life is 8 years. They're asking how long it will take for two-thirds of the substance to decay.

Wait, so if two-thirds decay, that means one-third remains, right? Because initially, you have 100%, and if 2/3 decay, then 1/3 is left. So I need to find the time when the remaining substance is 1/3 of the original.

I think the formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / half-life). So N(t) is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial amount.

Let me set up the equation. N(t) is 1/3 of N0 because 2/3 decayed. So:

1/3 = (1/2)^(t / 8)

I need to solve for t. To solve for exponents, I should take the logarithm of both sides. Let me take natural log or log base 10? Either should work, but maybe natural log is easier since I can use ln.

Taking the natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = (t/8) * ln(1/2)

So I can solve for t.

Let me compute the values. ln(1/3) is negative, same with ln(1/2). Let's compute:

ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986
ln(1/2) ≈ -0.6931

So the equation becomes:

-1.0986 = (t/8) * (-0.6931)

Multiply both sides by 8 to get rid of the denominator:

-1.0986 * 8 = t * (-0.6931)

Calculate the left side: 1.0986 *8 is about 8.7888. So with the negative, it's -8.7888.

So:

-8.7888 = -0.6931 t

Divide both sides by -0.6931:

t = (-8.7888) / (-0.6931) ≈ 12.68 years.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 12.68. So I think that's the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check the steps. Did I make an error in the formula? Let's see: the formula is correct. N(t) = N0*(1/2)^(t/half-life). Yeah, that's right.

So when N(t) is 1/3 of N0, we plug that in. The logarithm steps seem correct. I took ln of both sides, substituted the values, and solved for t. The arithmetic seems right: 1.0986 *8 is about 8.7888, divided by 0.6931 gives approximately 12.68. Yeah, that makes sense.

Another way to think about it: each half-life reduces the quantity by half. So after one half-life (8 years), half remains. After two half-lives (16 years), a quarter remains. So 1/3 is somewhere between 8 and 16 years, but closer to 8. Because 1/3 is about 0.333, and 1/2 is 0.5, so it's less than one half-life beyond 8 years. So 8 + something. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/3 is less than 1/2, so the time should be more than 8 years but less than 16. Wait, no, because each half-life is the time to reduce by half. Wait, no, it's the opposite. Let me think differently.

Wait, the half-life is the time taken for the substance to reduce to half its initial quantity. So after 8 years, half is left. After another 8 years (total 16), a quarter is left. So the question is, when is the remaining quantity 1/3? That's after a bit more than one half-life, because 1/3 is less than 1/2. Wait, no, wait: 1/3 is about 0.333, which is less than 0.5, so it's more than one half-life. Hmm, but wait, when t is 8 years, remaining is 0.5. To get to 0.333, which is less than 0.5, it should take more than 8 years but less than 16. Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it's about 12.68 years, which is between 8 and 16. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think of it in terms of how much has decayed. The question says two-thirds have decayed, so one-third remains. So yes, 1/3 is correct.

Wait, another way: the decay constant lambda is ln(2)/half-life. So lambda is 0.6931/8 ≈ 0.0866 per year.

The formula can also be written as N(t) = N0 * e^(-lambda t). So 1/3 = e^(-0.0866 t). Taking natural logs: ln(1/3) = -0.0866 t. So t = ln(1/3)/(-0.0866) = ( -1.0986 ) / (-0.0866 ) ≈ 12.68. Yep, same result.

So I think I'm confident the correct answer is C: 12.68.

To determine how long it will take for two-thirds of a radioactive substance to decay, we start by noting that if two-thirds decay, one-third of the substance remains. The half-life of the substance is given as 8 years, and the decay follows the formula:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / \text{half-life}}
\]

Here, \(N(t)\) represents the remaining quantity of the substance, \(N_0\) is the initial quantity, and \(t\) is the time. Since two-thirds decay, \(N(t) = \frac{1}{3}N_0\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / 8}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{t}{8} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Using approximate values for the logarithms:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986, \quad \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx -0.6931
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
-1.0986 = \frac{t}{8} \cdot -0.6931
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{-1.0986}{-0.6931} \cdot 8 \approx 12.68 \, \text{years}
\]

Thus, the time required for two-thirds of the substance to decay is approximately 12.68 years. This corresponds to option **C**.
