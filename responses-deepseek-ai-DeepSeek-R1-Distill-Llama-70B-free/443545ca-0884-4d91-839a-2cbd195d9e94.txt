Okay, so I've got this Python question here, and I'm a bit new to the language, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is: In Python 3, what is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][-3]?

And then there are options from A to J. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

Hmm. I remember that in Python, lists can be accessed using indexes. The index starts from 0, but wait, there's also negative indexing, right? Oh right, negative indexes count from the end. So -1 is the last element, -2 the second last, and so on.

So the list given is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1]. Let me write that out. The elements are at indexes 0: 'a', 1: 'Chemistry', 2: 0, 3:1. So the length of the list is 4 elements.

Now, when we use [-3], that refers to the third element from the end. Because -1 is the last, so -2 is the third from the end if the list is longer, but wait, in this case, the list has four elements.

Wait, let's think. For a list [A, B, C, D], indexes are 0,1,2,3. The negative indexes would be: -1 is D, -2 is C, -3 is B, -4 is A.

So in this case, the list is ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1]. So index -1 is 1, -2 is 0, -3 is 'Chemistry', and -4 is 'a'.

So the element at index -3 is 'Chemistry', right? So the value should be 'Chemistry'.

Looking at the options, option A is Chemistry. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the indexes. Let me count again. The list has four elements:

Index 0: 'a'

Index 1: 'Chemistry'

Index 2: 0

Index 3:1

Negative indexes:

-1 → 1

-2 → 0

-3 → 'Chemistry'

-4 → 'a'

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option A.

The question asks for the value of `['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][-3]` in Python 3. 

In Python, list indexing starts at 0, and negative indexing counts from the end of the list, where `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` the second last, and so on. The given list `['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1]` has four elements:

- Index `0`: `'a'`
- Index `1`: `'Chemistry'`
- Index `2`: `0`
- Index `3`: `1`

Using negative indexing:
- `-1` corresponds to `1`
- `-2` corresponds to `0`
- `-3` corresponds to `'Chemistry'`
- `-4` corresponds to `'a'`

Thus, `['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][-3]` returns `'Chemistry'`. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **A: Chemistry**.
