Okay, so I have this math problem here: "Find the opposite of the number −7." And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out what the opposite of -7 is.

Wait, opposite in math terms usually means the additive inverse, right? So the opposite of a number is what you add to it to get zero. Like, the opposite of 5 is -5 because 5 + (-5) = 0. So applying that to -7, the opposite would be... let's think. If I add -7 and its opposite, the result should be zero. So, -7 + x = 0. Solving for x, I subtract -7 from both sides, which is the same as adding 7. So x is 7. 

Let me double-check. The opposite of a negative number is positive, and same absolute value. So yeah, -7's opposite is 7. So looking at the options, I need to find which one is 7. Let me scan the options.

Options are A: -0.77, B: -14, C: -7, D: 0.7, E:14, F:7, G:-0.07, H:-7.7, I:0.77, J:70.

So F is 7. That must be the correct answer. So the opposite of -7 is 7, which is option F.

The opposite of a number is its additive inverse, which means for −7, the opposite is 7. Among the given options, 7 corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
