Okay, so I've got this group theory question in front of me. It's about two statements, and I need to figure out if each is true or false. Let me take it step by step.

First, Statement 1 says, "Every group of order 159 is cyclic." Hmm. I remember that a group is cyclic if all its elements can be generated by a single element, right? And there's something about the order of the group being a prime or something related.

Wait, 159. Let me factor that number. 159 divided by 3 is 53. Oh wait, 3 times 53 is 159. Both 3 and 53 are prime numbers. So the order is a product of two distinct primes.

I think for groups of order p*q where p and q are primes, the group is cyclic if p doesn't equal q, right? Because when they're distinct, the group is abelian and hence cyclic. Oh wait, wait! No, wait. If the group has order p*q where p and q are primes, and p does not equal q, then the group is cyclic if one of them is 1 mod the other? Or is it that if the group is abelian, then it's cyclic, but non-abelian groups can exist if certain conditions are met.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. For the order being the product of two distinct primes, the group is solvable, but whether it's cyclic depends on more. Oh wait, no, actually, if the order is the product of two distinct primes p and q, with p < q, and if q is not congruent to 1 mod p, then the group is cyclic. Because if q ≡ 1 mod p, then there might be a non-abelian group of that order.

Wait, but 159 is 3*53. So p=3, q=53. Is 53 ≡ 1 mod 3? Let's check: 53 divided by 3 is 17 with a remainder of 2. So 53 mod 3 is 2, not 1. So according to that, the group would be cyclic because q isn't 1 mod p. So in this case, every group of order 159 must be cyclic. So Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but wait another point. Another way to think: if the order is a product of two primes, and one is not 1 mod the other, then the group is cyclic. If it is 1 mod, then a non-abelian group exists. So since 53 mod 3 is 2, not 1, so the group must be cyclic. So statement 1 is true.

Now, moving to Statement 2: "Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup." Hmm. Let's factor 102. 102 is 2 * 3 * 17. So it's a product of three distinct primes. 

I remember that for groups, if the order is such that it's not a prime, then every group of that order has a nontrivial proper subgroup. Wait, no. Wait, that's not right. For example, groups of prime order are cyclic and simple, meaning no nontrivial proper normal subgroups. But for composite orders, do they always have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup? Or does it depend?

Wait, I think the statement is about having a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. So, for example, in simple groups, they don't have nontrivial proper normal subgroups. So if a group is simple, then it doesn't have such subgroups. But for composite order groups, are all of them non-simple? Or can they be simple?

Wait, for example, the alternating group A5 has order 60, which is composite, but it's simple, meaning it has no nontrivial proper normal subgroups. So not every group of composite order has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. But wait, the statement is about order 102. Does a simple group of order 102 exist?

Wait, let's think. The order is 102. Let me check if 102 is one of the orders of the known simple groups. The simple groups include cyclic groups of prime order, alternating groups of degree at least 5, and the groups of Lie type, and the 26 sporadic groups.

Wait, 102 factors into 2 * 3 * 17. Let's see: the smallest non-abelian simple groups are A5 (order 60), A6 (360), A7 (5040), etc. So 102 isn't among these. What about the groups of Lie type? Maybe the projective special linear groups. For example, PSL(2, q) where q is a prime power. Let's see: PSL(2,7) has order (7^3 -1)/(7-1) = (343-1)/6= 342/6=57. No, that's 57, not 102. PSL(2, 17) would be way bigger. What about PSL(2, 2)? That's order 6. PSL(2,3) is 12, PSL(2,4)= 60, which is A5. PSL(2,5) is 60 as well. Wait, 102 isn't matching any of these.

Wait, but maybe there are other simple groups. Another thought: the order must satisfy certain conditions for a group to be simple. For a group to be non-abelian simple, its order must be such that it's not ruled out by the classification theorem.

Wait, let's see: according to the classification, all finite simple groups are either cyclic of prime order, or alternating groups, or groups of Lie type (like PSL), or the 26 sporadic groups.

So, let me check if 102 is the order of any of the known simple groups. The smallest sporadic group is the Mathieu group M11, which has order 7920, way bigger than 102. So none of the sporadic groups have order 102. 

So maybe 102 is not the order of any non-abelian simple group. So does that mean that every group of order 102 must have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup? Because if there are no simple groups of order 102, then every group of that order is not simple, meaning it must have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.

Wait, but wait. What about solvable groups? Because if a group is solvable, it has a subnormal series, and thus has normal subgroups. But is every group of order 102 solvable?

Wait, let me think about the solvability. The order is 102=2*3*17. All primes are distinct. By Burnside's theorem, a group with order p^a q^b is solvable, I think. Because for square-free orders, the group is solvable. Wait, Burnside's pq^2 theorem: if the order is p^a q^b, and it's not a Frobenius group, then it's solvable? Wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, I remember that groups of order pqr, where p, q, r are distinct primes, are solvable. Because their derived series eventually reaches trivial.

Wait, but let's think. For a group of order 102, which is 2*3*17. So it's a square-free order, with three primes. Now, I recall that any group whose order is square-free and has at least three distinct prime factors is solvable. Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct. Or maybe it is.

Wait, another approach: the group must have a normal Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p. For that, the number of Sylow p-subgroups must be congruent to 1 mod p and divide the order divided by p. 

Let me try for p=17. The number of Sylow 17-subgroups, n_17, must divide 2*3=6, and n_17 ≡1 mod 17. But possible divisors are 1,2,3,6. Which of these are 1 mod 17? Well, 1 mod 17 is 1. So n_17=1. So the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal. 

So the group has a normal Sylow 17-subgroup. Therefore, the group is not simple, because it has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. So every group of order 102 has a normal Sylow 17-subgroup, which is nontrivial and proper. Thus, statement 2 is true.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any exceptions? Suppose a group of order 102. Since n_17=1, the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal. So the group has a normal subgroup of order 17. That means the group isn't simple, so it must have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. So yes, statement 2 is true.

So putting it all together: Statement 1 is true, because every group of order 159 (which is 3*53, and 53 mod 3 is 2, so cyclic). Statement 2 is true, because every group of order 102 has a normal Sylow 17-subgroup, hence a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.

So the options are looking for the evaluation of Statement 1 and Statement 2. Looking at the options:

Option D: True, True.

So the correct answer should be D.
</think>

Statement 1: "Every group of order 159 is cyclic."  
The order 159 factors as \( 3 \times 53 \), where both 3 and 53 are distinct primes. For a group of order \( p \times q \) (where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct primes), the group is cyclic if \( q \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p} \). Here, \( 53 \mod 3 = 2 \), which is not congruent to 1. Therefore, every group of order 159 is cyclic. Hence, Statement 1 is **True**.

Statement 2: "Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup."  
The order 102 factors as \( 2 \times 3 \times 17 \). By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 17-subgroups, \( n_{17} \), must divide \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) and satisfy \( n_{17} \equiv 1 \pmod{17} \). The only divisor of 6 that satisfies this condition is \( n_{17} = 1 \), meaning the Sylow 17-subgroup is normal in the group. This implies that every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. Hence, Statement 2 is **True**.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is:

**D: True, True**
