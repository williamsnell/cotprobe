Okay, so I've got this question about determining the dew point of a mixture of benzene and n-pentane gases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

So the question says the mixture is 60 mole percent benzene and 40 mole percent n-pentane. The total pressure is 1 atm. I need to find the dew point from the options given.

Wait, what's the dew point again? Oh right, the dew point is the temperature at which the first liquid droplet forms when cooling a vapor mixture. Alternatively, it's the temperature where the vapor pressure equals the total pressure. Or wait, maybe it's the point where the sum of the partial pressures equals the total pressure. Yeah, I think that's right.

So for a mixture, each component contributes its partial pressure. The partial pressure is the mole fraction times the total pressure. And each component's partial pressure should equal its vapor pressure at the dew point temperature.

So for each component i, P_i = y_i * P_total = P_i^sat(T), where P_i^sat is the saturation (vapor) pressure of pure component i at temperature T.

So the dew point temperature is the temperature where the sum of (y_i * P_total) equals the sum of the pure component vapor pressures at that temperature. Wait, no, more accurately, each component's partial pressure must equal its vapor pressure at that T. So for each component, y_i * P_total = P_i^sat(T).

But wait, benzene and n-pentane might have different vapor pressures at the same temperature. So how do I find a temperature where both conditions are satisfied simultaneously?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because each component's partial pressure is y_i * P_total. At the dew point, the mixture is just about to condense, so each component's partial pressure equals its pure vapor pressure at that temperature.

So I think for each component, y_i * P_total = P_i^sat(T_dew). 

Given that, I can write two equations:

For benzene: 0.6 * 1 atm = P_benzene^sat(T)
For n-pentane: 0.4 * 1 atm = P_n-pentane^sat(T)

So I need to find a temperature T where both of these equations hold. That is, find T such that P_benzene^sat(T) = 0.6 atm and P_n-pentane^sat(T) = 0.4 atm.

Wait, but wait a second. If I have two equations and one unknown (T), there might not be a solution unless both conditions are satisfied at the same T. So I would need to find T where the vapor pressure of benzene is 0.6 atm and the vapor pressure of n-pentane is 0.4 atm, but I don't think that's possible because each component's vapor pressure is a function of T, and their curves might not intersect in such a way.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to find T where the sum of the partial pressures equals the total pressure, but I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, no. The dew point is when the vapor is saturated, so for each component, the partial pressure equals their vapor pressure at that T. So the sum of the partial pressures (each being y_i * P_total) should equal the sum of the pure component vapor pressures, but that's not right because each component's vapor pressure is at the same T.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. For a binary mixture, the dew point occurs when the sum of the partial pressures equals the total pressure, which is 1 atm here. But each partial pressure is y_i * P_total, which must equal P_i^sat(T). So:

y1 * P_total = P1^sat(T)
y2 * P_total = P2^sat(T)

Which can be rewritten as:

P1^sat(T) = y1 * P
P2^sat(T) = y2 * P

So for each component, I can find the T where their vapor pressure equals y_i * P.

So, if I can find the temperatures where:

P_benzene^sat(T) = 0.6 atm
P_n-pentane^sat(T) = 0.4 atm

Wait, but each component's vapor pressure is a function of T, and they probably don't have the same T where their P_sat equals 0.6 and 0.4 respectively. So maybe I need to find a T where the sum of the vapor pressures of benzene and n-pentane equals 1 atm. Wait, no, that's the bubble point, perhaps. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused between dew point and bubble point. Let me recall: The bubble point is the first point where a liquid begins to vaporize (boil), so it's the temperature where the sum of the mole fractions times their vapor pressures equals the total pressure. The dew point is the temperature where the sum of the partial pressures of the vapor equals each component's vapor pressure, leading to the first condensation.

Alternatively, for the bubble point, the sum of (y_i * P_i^sat) = P_total. For the dew point, the sum of (y_i / P_i^sat) = 1/P_total. Hmm, maybe that's the formula.

Wait, I think I remember that for the dew point, the total pressure P is the sum of the partial pressures of each component, each of which is (y_i) * P. But at the dew point, each partial pressure equals the pure component's vapor pressure at T_dew. So each y_i * P = P_i^sat(T_dew). So for all components, this must hold. So for each component, P_i^sat(T) = y_i * P.

So, for this problem, I need to find T such that:

P_benzene^sat(T) = 0.6 atm
P_n-pentane^sat(T) = 0.4 atm

But wait, that would require that T is such that both of these are true. But each component's vapor pressure is a function of T, so this would only be possible if the T where benzene's vapor pressure is 0.6 atm is the same T where n-pentane's vapor pressure is 0.4 atm. I'm not sure if that's the case, but let's proceed.

So I need to look up or calculate the saturation pressures of benzene and n-pentane at various temperatures and see where this condition holds.

But wait, I don't have any data tables here. Hmm, that complicates things. But maybe I can remember some approximate vapor pressures.

Wait, let's think about the normal boiling points. The normal boiling point is where the vapor pressure is 1 atm at 100°C (well, not exactly, but that's a rough point). Wait, for benzene, the boiling point is about 80°C. So at 80°C, benzene's vapor pressure is 1 atm. So if I lower the temperature, the vapor pressure would decrease.

So, for benzene at 80°C, P_sat is 1 atm. So if I want P_benzene = 0.6 atm, that would correspond to a lower temperature. Let me think. Let's say at 60°C, benzene's vapor pressure is lower. Maybe around 0.5 atm? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe higher.

Wait, no, wait. At lower temperatures, vapor pressure decreases. So if at 80°C, it's 1 atm, then at say, 70°C, it's maybe 0.8 atm. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

As for n-pentane, its boiling point is around 36°C. So at 36°C, its vapor pressure is 1 atm. So higher temperatures would have higher vapor pressures, lower temps lower. So if we're looking for n-pentane's vapor pressure to be 0.4 atm, what's the temperature?

Wait, perhaps I can use the Antoine equation, but I don't have the constants memorized. Alternatively, I can try to make educated guesses.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that each component's vapor pressure at the dew point temperature equals their mole fraction times the total pressure.

So for benzene: P_benzene = 0.6 atm. So what's the temperature where benzene's vapor pressure is 0.6 atm?

I think benzene's vapor pressure at 70°C is about 0.6 atm. Let me try to recall. At 20°C, it's around 0.1 atm. At 50°C, maybe 0.3 atm. At 80°C, it's 1 atm. So between 70 and 80, it increases from 0.6 to 1 atm. So perhaps at 70°C, benzene's vapor pressure is around 0.6 atm.

Similarly, for n-pentane, P_n-pentane = 0.4 atm. The boiling point of n-pentane is about 36°C, so at 36°C, P_sat is 1 atm. So at a lower temperature, say 20°C, it's 0.1 atm. So to get 0.4 atm, maybe the temperature is around 28-30°C? Because vapor pressure increases with temperature.

Wait, but wait. If the dew point temperature is the same for both components, then it must be a temperature where benzene's vapor pressure is 0.6 atm and pentane's is 0.4 atm. But from my rough estimates, benzene reaches 0.6 atm at around 70°C, while pentane would reach 0.4 atm at perhaps around 25°C. These are two different temperatures, so that's a problem. That suggests that I might be approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the concept. Maybe the dew point is when the sum of the partial pressures equals the total pressure. But each partial pressure is y_i * P_total. So for a total pressure of 1 atm, the sum of the partial pressures would be 1 atm as well. Wait, that's always true, so that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about it as the dew point being the temperature where the mixture's vapor is saturated, meaning that any cooling beyond that would cause condensation. So, perhaps the dew point is the temperature where the sum of the mole fractions times their vapor pressures at that temperature equals the total pressure.

Wait, that sounds more like the bubble point. Let me get this straight.

Bubble point: the temperature at which the first bubble of vapor forms when heating a liquid mixture. At this point, the sum of the mole fractions times their vapor pressures equals the total pressure: Σ(y_i * P_i^sat(T)) = P_total.

Dew point: the temperature at which the first drop of liquid forms when cooling a vapor. At this point, the sum of the mole fractions times the total pressure equals the sum of their vapor pressures: Σ(y_i * P_total) = Σ(P_i^sat(T)).

Wait, no, that can't be, because for the dew point, each component's partial pressure (y_i * P_total) must be equal to their vapor pressure at T_dew. So for each component, y_i * P_total = P_i^sat(T_dew). So both conditions must be satisfied.

But this would require that P_benzene^sat(T) = 0.6 atm and P_n-pentane^sat(T) = 0.4 atm at the same temperature T. Which seems unlikely because their individual vapor pressures vary with T differently.

Wait, but perhaps in this specific case, the temperature where benzene's P_sat is 0.6 atm is the same as where pentane's P_sat is 0.4 atm. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to set up the equations and find T such that both are satisfied.

But without actual data, it's hard to calculate. So perhaps the problem expects me to know that the dew point is determined by the component with the higher mole fraction, which is benzene here (60%). So the dew point would be closer to benzene's vapor pressure at 0.6 atm.

Earlier, I thought benzene's P_sat is 0.6 atm around 70°C. Looking at the options, D is 70°C, which is an option.

Wait, but what about n-pentane? If the temperature is 70°C, then n-pentane's vapor pressure would be higher than 0.4 atm because at 36°C it's 1 atm. At higher temps, its vapor pressure would be higher than 1 atm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, n-pentane's vapor pressure at 70°C would be much higher than 1 atm, which isn't possible because the total pressure is 1 atm. So that would mean that at 70°C, n-pentane's vapor pressure is higher than 1 atm, so 0.4 * 1 atm = 0.4 atm. But if n-pentane's P_sat at that T is higher than 0.4 atm, then the condition y_i * P_total = P_i^sat(T) would not hold. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about this as the temperature where the sum of the partial pressures equals the total pressure. Wait, but that's always true. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach. I've heard of Raoult's law for this. Raoult's law states that the partial pressure of a component is equal to its mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with the vapor phase, so maybe Dalton's law applies.

Wait, another approach: The dew point is the temperature at which the vapor becomes saturated. So, the vapor can be treated as an ideal gas, and for each component, its partial pressure is y_i * P_total. At the dew point, each partial pressure equals the pure component's vapor pressure at that temperature.

So, for each component:

y_1 * P_total = P_1^sat(T_dew)
y_2 * P_total = P_2^sat(T_dew)

So, for benzene: 0.6 * 1 atm = P_benzene^sat(T_dew)
For n-pentane: 0.4 * 1 atm = P_n-pentane^sat(T_dew)

So I need to find T where both conditions are satisfied.

Now, I need to find T such that P_benzene^sat(T) = 0.6 atm and P_n-pentane^sat(T) = 0.4 atm.

But without exact data, I can only make educated guesses.

Let me think about the vapor pressures of benzene and n-pentane at various temperatures.

Benzene:
- At 20°C: ~0.12 atm
- At 50°C: ~0.3 atm
- At 70°C: ~0.6 atm
- At 80°C: ~1 atm

n-Pentane:
- At 20°C: ~0.3 atm
- At 30°C: ~0.5 atm
- At 36°C: ~1 atm
- At higher temperatures, it's higher than 1 atm.

Wait, so for benzene, 0.6 atm occurs around 70°C. For n-pentane, 0.4 atm would be at a lower temperature than 36°C because at 36°C, it's 1 atm. So let's see, if at 30°C, n-pentane's vapor pressure is 0.5 atm. So to get 0.4 atm, it must be a bit below 30°C. Let's say around 25°C.

But the problem is that 70°C is where benzene reaches 0.6 atm, but at 70°C, n-pentane's vapor pressure would be higher than 1 atm, which is impossible because the total pressure is 1 atm. So that can't be.

Wait, but the partial pressure of n-pentane would be 0.4 atm only if P_n-pentane^sat(T) is 0.4 atm. But if at T=25°C, P_n-pentane is 0.4 atm, then what's benzene's P_sat at 25°C? Let's say it's around 0.12 atm. So 0.12 atm is less than 0.6 atm. So that doesn't satisfy the condition for benzene.

So this suggests that there's no temperature where both conditions are satisfied, which can't be right because the question expects an answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the dew point is determined by the component with the lowest volatility, which is benzene in this case because it has a higher boiling point. So the dew point would be where benzene's partial pressure equals its vapor pressure, and n-pentane's partial pressure would be higher than its vapor pressure, but that can't be because that would imply it's not condensing.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the dew point is the temperature where the sum of the partial pressures equals the sum of the pure component vapor pressures. Wait, that can't be right because that sum would vary with temperature.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think of it this way: the dew point occurs when the vapor can no longer hold all the components in the gas phase, so the first condensation happens. For each component, their partial pressure in the vapor must equal their vapor pressure at that temperature.

But perhaps there's a formula that relates the mole fractions and the vapor pressures. Let me try to recall.

For a binary mixture, the dew point can be found by solving:

1/(P_total) = (y1)/(P1^sat(T)) + (y2)/(P2^sat(T))

So, 1/P = y1/P1 + y2/P2

In this case, P = 1 atm, y1=0.6, y2=0.4.

So,

1 = 0.6 / P1^sat(T) + 0.4 / P2^sat(T)

We need to find T where this equation holds.

So, I need to find T where 0.6 / P_benzene(T) + 0.4 / P_n-pentane(T) = 1.

Hmm, but without knowing P_benzene and P_n-pentane as functions of T, I can't compute this exactly. But perhaps I can make an educated guess based on typical vapor pressures.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use approximation methods. Let's assume that at the dew point temperature, the vapor pressures of benzene and n-pentane are such that when you plug them into the equation, it equals 1.

Let me try plugging in some temperatures.

Option D is 70°C. Let's see what the vapor pressures are around that temp.

At 70°C:
- Benzene's P_sat ≈ 0.6
