Question:

For point-to-point communication at higher frequencies, the desiredradiation pattern is a single narrow lobe or beam. To obtainsuch a characteristic (at least approximately) a multi-elementlinear array is usually used. An array is linear whenthe elements of the ar-ray are spaced equally along a straightline. In a uniform linear array the elements are fed withcurrents of equal magnitude and having a uniform progressivephase shift along the line. The pattern of such anarray can be obtained by addingvectoriallythe field strengthsdue to each of the elements. For a uniform array of non-directionalelements the field strength would be E_T = E_0 \vert1 +e^J\psi+ e^J2\psi + e^J3\psi + ... +e^j^(^n-1)\psi \vert(1) where \psi =\betadcos\textphi + \alpha and\alpha is the progressive phase shift between elements, (\alpha is theangle by which the current in any element leads the currentin the preceding element.) Compute the pattern of such a linear array.

Options:

A: 0.512
B: 0.612
C: 0.212
D: 0.212 (with a different phase shift)
E: 0.412
F: 0.312
G: 0.112
H: 0.712
I: 0.912
J: 0.112 (with a different element spacing)

Okay, so I've got this question about antenna arrays, specifically a uniform linear array. Hmm, I remember from my studies that antenna arrays are used to direct the radiated energy in a specific direction, creating a beam. The question is about computing the pattern of such an array.

The given equation is E_T = E0 times the absolute value of the sum from 1 to n-1 of e^{j k ψ}, where ψ is β d cosφ + α. Wait, no, looking closer, the sum is 1 + e^{jψ} + e^{j2ψ} + ... up to e^{j(n-1)ψ}. So that's a geometric series. Oh right, that's the formula for a uniform linear array's electric field pattern.

I remember that the sum of a geometric series like this can be simplified. The sum S would be (1 - e^{j n ψ}) / (1 - e^{j ψ}) when you factor out the terms. So the magnitude squared would be the absolute value squared, which involves the sine terms. Wait, the formula I remember is something like |E_T| = E0 * |sin(n ψ / 2)| / |sin(ψ / 2)|.

Wait, no, actually, the magnitude is |E_T| = E0 * sqrt( [sin(n ψ / 2)]^2 / [sin(ψ / 2)]^2 ). Or maybe it's without the square root? Hmm, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

The sum S = 1 + e^{jψ} + ... + e^{j(n-1)ψ} is a geometric series with ratio e^{jψ}, so sum S = (1 - e^{j n ψ}) / (1 - e^{j ψ}). The magnitude |S| is |1 - e^{j n ψ}| / |1 - e^{j ψ}|. 

Each of these terms can be rewritten using Euler's formula. The numerator is |1 - e^{j n ψ}| which equals 2 |sin(n ψ / 2)|, and the denominator is 2 |sin(ψ / 2)|. So |S| = [2 sin(n ψ / 2)] / [2 sin(ψ / 2)] ] = sin(n ψ/2) / sin(ψ/2). So the magnitude of E_T is E0 times that ratio.

So the radiation pattern is proportional to this sinc-like function. The pattern has maxima when the denominator is zero, which is when ψ/2 is an integer multiple of π. But wait, when sin(ψ/2) is zero, ψ must be 2π m, where m is an integer. That would make the numerator sin(n * 2π m / 2) = sin(n π m). For integer m, this is zero except when n is even and m is a multiple that makes it non-zero? Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit stuck here.

But the main point is that the pattern is a function that has peaks and nulls, with the main beam when the phase shift α is such that all the elements are adding constructively in a particular direction. The question is asking to compute the pattern, which from the options given, must relate to the specific form of the radiation pattern.

Wait, the options are numbers like 0.512, 0.612, etc. Hmm, maybe the question is asking for the value of the pattern E_T at a certain angle or condition. But the question statement just says to compute the pattern, which is a general function, but the options are numerical values, which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of elements or the spacing, but I'm not seeing that.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the form of the pattern. The given options mention different values and sometimes include a different phase shift or spacing. So, for example, one of the options says 0.212 with a different phase shift. But I thought the pattern was determined by the formula involving the sine terms.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the directivity or the beamwidth. But the question states it's about the pattern, which is the E_T as given.

Wait, the question says, "Compute the pattern of such a linear array." So perhaps the answer is the formula E_T equals that sum. But the options are numerical, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the options are possible forms, but they're written as numbers, so I must be missing something.

Wait, looking again, the first part says the desired radiation is a single narrow beam, achieved with a multi-element linear array. So the pattern would show a main lobe and perhaps some side lobes. The formula for E_T is the sum, which when plotted gives the radiation pattern.

Wait, perhaps each option represents a particular value of the pattern, like the maximum value or a specific point. For example, when all the elements are in phase (α=0), the maximum occurs at φ where β d cosφ is zero, so φ=90 degrees. At that point, ψ=α=0, so each term in the sum is 1, and E_T = E0 * n, where n is the number of elements. So E_T would be maximum n. But the options are all less than 1, except some are 0.9, 0.7, etc. Wait, maybe n is 2 elements. Then the maximum would be 2 E0, but that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the first null in the pattern. Or maybe it's about the half-power beamwidth. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem statement gives the formula for E_T involving the sum. So the correct answer must be the formula expressed as the sum, but the options don't present formulas. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about recognizing the correct form from the options, but the options are unclear.

Wait, looking at the options, they are all numbers except D and J, which mention different phase shifts. So perhaps the question is pointing out that the pattern depends on the phase shift α or the element spacing d. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge about the radiation pattern's maximum value. For a uniform array, the maximum occurs when all elements are in phase, so E_T = n E0, assuming each element's E is E0. So the maximum is n times E0, and the pattern is normalized by that maximum. So at some other angles, the value would be lower. But the options don't have a value of 1, except perhaps option I is 0.912, which is close to 1, but that's the maximum. But the question is about the general pattern, not a specific value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the directivity, which is the ratio of the maximum radiation to the average. But again, that's a formula, not a numerical value.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question gives the formula for E_T and asks to compute the pattern. Looking at the options, perhaps the correct formula is the one where the pattern is given as the sum of the exponential terms, which would match the formula in the question. But the options are letters A-J, and the correct answer is the one that correctly represents the pattern.

Wait, perhaps the options are not about the numerical value of the pattern, but about the form of the equation. But the options are given as numbers, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a multiple-choice about the correct expression, but the options are presented as numbers, which is confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is a fill-in-the-blank, but the user just presented it as multiple-choice. Alternatively, perhaps the options are possible expressions, but the way it's written is unclear.

Wait, the question statement ends with "Compute the pattern of such a linear array." So the pattern is given by E_T as in equation (1), which is the sum of the exponential terms. So the correct answer is the formula E_T = E0 |sum|. But none of the options A-J present this. So perhaps the question is more about the shape of the pattern, like whether it's a single lobe, multiple lobes, etc.

Wait, the question says that the desired pattern is a single narrow lobe. So the correct answer's pattern should have a single narrow beam. So the correct formula is the one that produces such a pattern. But the options don't describe this; they are numerical.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: perhaps the options are the possible values of the radiation pattern at a certain angle, say when the angle is such that it's pointing in a specific direction. For example, when the array is steered, the maximum would be in a certain direction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the side lobe levels. For a uniform array, the first side lobe is about 13 dB below the main lobe. But the options don't have anything related to decibels.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is pointing out that the pattern depends on the number of elements or the phase shift. But without more details, it's hard to say.

Wait, looking back, the question says that the elements are fed with currents of equal magnitude and uniform progressive phase shift. So the phase shift α between elements affects the direction of the main beam. So the pattern's direction depends on α. But the options don't seem to describe that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer is the formula as given, which isn't among the options. But since the options are all letters with numbers, I'm probably misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the options are not all about E_T's value but about whether the pattern is correct. For example, option B might be 0.612, which could be a normalized value of the pattern at a certain point, but without knowing the exact parameters, it's impossible to compute. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the form of the radiation pattern. The correct pattern for a uniform linear array is a series of lobes, with a main lobe and side lobes. But the options don't describe this.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a typo, and the options are meant to represent the formula. For example, option B could be E_T = ... but it's written as 0.612. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is that the pattern is the sum given, which would correspond to option F: 0.312. But that's a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of elements. But the given formula is general for any n. Without knowing n, it's impossible to find a numerical value.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to a specific case, like n=2 elements. Then the sum would be 1 + e^{jψ}, and |E_T| = |1 + e^{jψ}| = 2 |cos(ψ/2)|. So the maximum is 2, the minimum is 0. So if n=2, the pattern would vary between 0 and 2. But the options don't have 2.

Alternatively, the question might be asking for the pattern maximum, which for n elements is n E0. But the options don't have that either.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about what each option represents. The only options that stand out are those mentioning different phase shifts or spacings, like D and J. So maybe the correct pattern depends on the phase shift α. If the phase shift is such that it scans the beam, the pattern would have a single lobe. So perhaps the correct answer is the option that includes a different phase shift, which would be D or J.

But the question is about computing the pattern when the array is uniform, so if the phase shift is changed, the pattern would change. So the correct pattern for a uniform array with a certain α would be a single narrow beam. But without knowing which option corresponds, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe the question is more about the formula, and the correct answer is the sum given in equation (1). But none of the options A-J represent that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking which of the options represents the correct form of the pattern, such as the sinc function. For example, the pattern is a sinc function squared, but the options don't describe that.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick, and the correct answer is that the pattern is as given by the sum, which would be option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the question says that the pattern is obtained by adding the field strengths vectorially. So the correct approach is to sum each element's contribution, leading to the formula in equation (1). So the pattern is given by that sum, which simplifies to the sinc function. So the correct answer is the formula, but the options are numbers. So perhaps the question is expecting the recognition that the pattern is a sum of phasors, leading to a specific form, but without the options matching, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of elements. For example, if the array has n elements, the maximum is n. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is incomplete, and the actual problem is missing. Because the given information doesn't directly lead to a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the student is supposed to derive the formula, which is given, making the correct answer the formula itself. But the options don't have that.

Hmm, I'm really not making progress here. I think I need to make a educated guess. Since the question is about the pattern, and the formula is given as a sum, perhaps the correct answer is option F: 0.312. But I can't be sure.

Wait, another angle: the pattern's maximum is when all elements add in phase. So the maximum value of |E_T| is n E0. The options don't have this as a value, but perhaps the question is about the value at a certain angle, say broadside. For a broadside array, when φ=90 degrees, cosφ=0, so ψ=α. So |E_T| is the same as the sum when the phase shift is α.

But without knowing α or n, it's impossible to calculate. So perhaps the correct answer is the formula as given, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G: 0.112. But I'm just guessing now.

Wait, perhaps I should just select the option that represents the correct formula. Since the options don't present that, maybe the intended answer is option F: 0.312. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the half-power beamwidth, but again, without parameters, I can't compute it.

Alright, I think I'm stuck. I'll go with the formula being the sum, which isn't directly represented in the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option F.

The question involves computing the radiation pattern of a uniform linear array. The pattern is determined by summing the vector contributions of the electric field strengths from each element, as given by the formula:

\[
E_T = E_0 \left| 1 + e^{j\psi} + e^{j2\psi} + \dots + e^{j(n-1)\psi} \right|
\]

where \(\psi = \beta d \cos\phi + \alpha\), \(\beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\), \(d\) is the element spacing, \(\phi\) is the angle, and \(\alpha\) is the progressive phase shift between elements. This sum represents a geometric series, which simplifies to:

\[
E_T = E_0 \frac{\sin\left(\frac{n\psi}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\psi}{2}\right)}
\]

This result describes a radiation pattern with a main lobe and side lobes, characteristic of a uniform linear array. The main lobe direction depends on the phase shift \(\alpha\), and the pattern's shape is influenced by the number of elements \(n\) and the spacing \(d\).

The question asks to compute the pattern, but the options provided are numerical values, which do not directly correspond to the formula or its interpretation. The analysis suggests that the pattern depends on the phase shift \(\alpha\), and options D and J mention "different phase shifts," which could imply variations in the pattern. However, without additional parameters or context, it is unclear how these numerical values relate to the pattern.

Given the lack of clarity in the options, the reasoning concludes that the correct pattern is described by the formula above, but none of the options explicitly match this result. Based on the structure of the question and the options, a tentative choice is made.
