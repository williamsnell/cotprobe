Okay, so I've got this question here about business-led private regulation and why it's on the rise. I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly. It says, "The rise in business led, private regulation can be attributed to: encouragement of a _______ approach from industry, _________ and _______ achievement of objectives." The options are A through J, each with three words in order.

I think the key here is understanding what factors contribute to the rise of private regulation. From what I remember, private regulation often refers to businesses and industries setting their own rules and standards rather than relying solely on government regulations. This can happen for various reasons, like avoiding stricter government laws, improving efficiency, or enhancing their reputation.

So the question is about the approach and the outcomes. The first blank is about the approach—proactive or reactive. Proactive means taking initiative, while reactive is responding to events after they happen. Since businesses are leading the regulation, it makes sense that they're being proactive. They're anticipating issues and setting standards before problems arise or before governments step in. So the first word is probably "proactive."

Next, the second blank is about cost effectiveness. I think private regulation is often more cost-effective because businesses can tailor the rules to their specific needs without the heavy costs of government bureaucracy. It's more efficient for them to handle it themselves, so the second word should be "cost effectiveness."

Now the third blank is about the speed of achieving objectives. If businesses are proactive and cost-effective, they can probably achieve their goals faster. Government regulations can be slow because of the lengthy processes involved. Private sectors can move quicker, so the third word would be "faster."

Putting it all together, the sentence would read: "encouragement of a proactive approach from industry, cost effectiveness, and faster achievement of objectives." Now I'll look at the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

A: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster → This matches what I thought.

B: Reactive, Cost effectiveness, Slower → No, because proactive is better.

C: Faster, Cost effectiveness, Slower → The order is wrong.

D: Proactive, Heightened costs, Faster → Heightened costs doesn't fit; it's about effectiveness.

E: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Slower → Slower doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be option A.
