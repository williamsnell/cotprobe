Okay, so I'm trying to solve this microscope magnification problem. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that the total magnification of a microscope is the product of the objective's magnification and the eyepiece's magnification. But wait, I should make sure I understand the details.

The problem says the objective has a focal length of 3 mm. Oh right, that's the objective lens. The eyepiece alone gives 20x magnification when focused at infinity, so I think that's the eyepiece's magnifying power.

Now, the objective forms an image 160 mm beyond the second focal plane. Wait, the second focal plane is the focal plane of the eyepiece, right? Or is it the second focal point of the objective? Hmm, I think the objective has two focal points, one on each side. Oh, right, the objective forms an image beyond its own second focal point. So the image is virtual and formed beyond the second focal point of the objective.

Wait, but wait. In a microscope setup, the objective focuses the image just inside its focal length, forming a real image, and then the eyepiece, which is like a magnifying glass, takes that image and magnifies it further. Oh, but wait, no—the image formed by the objective is actually a real image located at the focal point of the eyepiece. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Let me recall the formula for the magnification. The objective's lateral magnification (M_ob) is given by (image distance)/(object distance). But wait, in the case of a microscope, the object is placed just inside the focal point of the objective, so the image is formed beyond the objective's focal point on the other side. Wait, no, wait—when the object is within the focal length of the objective, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. Oh, but wait, no, that's for a simple lens. Wait, in a microscope, the objective is used in such a way that the object is placed just outside the focal point, so the image is real but formed at a distance beyond the focal point on the opposite side.

Wait, maybe I should think about the microscope formula. The total magnification M is given by M = M_ob * M_eyepiece. So I need to find the magnification of the objective.

But how do I find M_ob? Oh, right, the magnification of the objective is related to the image distance and object distance. But wait, in a microscope, the image formed by the objective is the object for the eyepiece. So the image distance for the objective is the distance between the objective and the eyepiece, which is beyond the second focal point of the objective.

Wait, the problem states that the image is formed 160 mm beyond the second focal plane of the objective. Wait, the second focal point is on the eyepiece side, right? So the image is formed at a distance of 160 mm beyond that point. So the image distance (v) for the objective is 160 mm plus the focal length of the objective. Wait, no, I think the second focal plane is at a distance of f from the objective. So when the image is formed beyond that, the image distance is v = 2f + 160 mm? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The objective has a focal length f_ob = 3 mm. The image is formed 160 mm beyond the second focal plane. The second focal plane is at a distance f_ob from the lens, on the image side. So the image distance v is f_ob + 160 mm. So v = 3 + 160 = 163 mm.

Wait, but wait, when the object is placed just inside the focal point of the objective, the image is formed at a distance v which is given by 1/f = 1/do + 1/di. But wait, in this case, the object is placed very close to the focal point, so do is approximately f. But if the image is formed beyond the second focal point, then di would be greater than 2f, perhaps?

Wait, no, wait. The second focal point is at distance f from the lens on the image side. So if the image is formed 160 mm beyond that, then di = f + 160 mm. So di = 3 + 160 = 163 mm.

Wait, but wait, that seems way too large. Because the object is very close to the focal point, so do is approximately f. So let me use the lens formula: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Assuming do is very close to f (since in a microscope, the object is placed just outside f of the objective), so do ≈ f. So 1/do ≈ 1/f. So 1/f = 1/f + 1/di → 1/di ≈ 0. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The object is placed just inside the focal point of the objective, so do is less than f_ob. Wait, no, in a microscope, the object is placed just outside the focal point, because if it's inside, the image would be virtual, but in a microscope, the objective forms a real image. So for a real image, the object must be beyond the focal point (do > f), so the image is formed beyond 2f. Wait, no—wait, no, because in a simple lens, when do > f, the image is real and inverted, and di > f if do > 2f. Wait, no, that's for a simple lens. For a microscope, the object is placed just outside the focal point of the objective, so do is slightly larger than f_ob. Then the image is formed at a di that's much larger than f_ob.

Wait, but the problem states that the image is 160 mm beyond the second focal plane, which is at f_ob from the lens. So di = 160 mm + f_ob.

Wait, the second focal plane would be at a distance of f_ob on the image side. So if the image is formed 160 mm beyond that, di = 3 mm + 160 mm = 163 mm.

Now, using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

We can solve for do. f is 3 mm, di is 163 mm.

So 1/do = 1/f - 1/di = (1/3) - (1/163) ≈ (0.3333) - (0.006134) ≈ 0.3272.

So do = 1 / 0.3272 ≈ 3.056 mm.

Wait, that makes sense because the object is just a bit beyond the focal point, so do ≈ 3.056 mm, which is just a little more than f.

But wait, the magnification of the objective is the ratio of the image height to the object height, which is (di/do). So M_ob = di/do.

So di is 163 mm, do is approximately 3.056 mm.

So M_ob = 163 / 3.056 ≈ let's calculate that.

163 divided by 3 is about 54.333. 3.056 is a bit more than 3, so the result would be a bit less than 54.333. Let me compute it more accurately.

3.056 * 53 = 3.056 *50=152.8, plus 3.056*3=9.168 → total 161.968, which is close to 163.

So 53 *3.056=161.968, so 163-161.968=1.032 left.

1.032 /3.056 ≈ 0.3376. So 53.3376.

So M_ob ≈ 53.34.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, in optics, the magnification of the objective in a microscope is given by M_ob = (image distance)/(object distance) = (di)/(do). So with di=163 mm and do≈3.056 mm, so M_ob=163/3.056≈53.34.

Alternatively, sometimes, the magnification is approximated as (L)/(f_ob), where L is the tube length. Wait, because in a microscope, the standard tube length is 160 mm, but sometimes it's 170 mm. But in this problem, I think it's given that the image is formed beyond the second focal point by 160 mm, so that would imply that the image distance is f_ob + 160 mm. So perhaps the tube length is 160 mm, which is the distance between the two focal points (the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, in a microscope, the tube length is the distance between the second focal plane of the objective and the first focal plane of the eyepiece. So when the image is formed at the eyepiece's first focal point, the image is at the near point, and the eyepiece forms it at infinity. So perhaps the image distance for the objective is the tube length plus the focal length of the eyepiece. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the image formed by the objective is at the focal point of the eyepiece. So if the tube length is L, then di = L + f_eyepiece. But I don't have the eyepiece's focal length given. Hmm, maybe I don't need it because the problem provides the image distance beyond the second focal point.

Wait, perhaps the image is formed 160 mm beyond the second focal point of the objective, so di = f_ob + 160 mm = 3 + 160 = 163 mm.

So using that, I calculated M_ob ≈53.34.

Now, the eyepiece provides 20x magnification. So total magnification M_total = M_ob * M_eyepiece.

So M_total ≈53.34 *20 = 1066.8.

Looking at the options, option G is 1066, which is the closest. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating M_ob. Because sometimes, in microscope formulas, the objective's magnification is approximated as (L)/(f_ob), where L is the tube length. So if the image is formed at L beyond the second focal point, then L is 160 mm. So M_ob = L / f_ob = 160 /3 ≈53.333. Which matches what I calculated earlier.

So yes, M_ob is 160/3 ≈53.333, and M_eyepiece is 20x. So M_total is 53.333 *20= 1066.666..., which rounds to 1066. So option G is correct.

To determine the total magnification of the compound microscope, we calculate the product of the objective's magnification and the eyepiece's magnification.

### Step 1: Objective Magnification
The objective has a focal length \( f_{\text{ob}} = 3 \, \text{mm} \). The problem states that the image is formed \( 160 \, \text{mm} \) beyond the second focal plane of the objective. Since the second focal plane is located at \( f_{\text{ob}} \) on the image side, the total image distance is:

\[
v = f_{\text{ob}} + 160 = 3 + 160 = 163 \, \text{mm}.
\]

The magnification of the objective is given by:

\[
M_{\text{ob}} = \frac{v}{f_{\text{ob}}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M_{\text{ob}} = \frac{163}{3} \approx 53.33.
\]

### Step 2: Eyepiece Magnification
The eyepiece provides a magnification of \( M_{\text{eyepiece}} = 20 \times \), as stated in the problem.

### Step 3: Total Magnification
The total magnification of the microscope is the product of the objective's magnification and the eyepiece's magnification:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = M_{\text{ob}} \cdot M_{\text{eyepiece}}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = 53.33 \cdot 20 \approx 1066.67.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated total magnification is **1066**, which corresponds to option **G**.
