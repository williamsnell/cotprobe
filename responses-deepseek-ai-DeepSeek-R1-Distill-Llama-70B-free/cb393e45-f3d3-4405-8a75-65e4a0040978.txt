Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about attentional load theory, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, so I'll have to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that attentional load theory is related to how we allocate attention when we're trying to focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others. It's about the idea that our attention has limits, so how we use it depends on how much processing different stimuli require.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the processing of an attended stimulus depends on the ignored one. Hmm, I think that's the opposite of what I remember. The theory suggests that the processing of the ignored stimulus depends on the attended one. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B talks about the number of tasks being performed. I think that's more about dual-task interference, not specifically load theory. Load theory is more about the difficulty or the processing demands.

Option C mentions the unity of actions limiting attentional resources. I'm not too sure about this one. Unity might relate to how we can't do multiple things at once, but I don't remember it being a core part of load theory.

Option D says the capacity of attentional resources is determined by the ignored stimulus's complexity. Wait, that sounds off. I thought the attended stimulus's complexity affects how much attention we allocate, thereby influencing the ignored stimulus's processing.

Option E suggests selective attention delays ignored processing. I'm not certain, but I think selective attention might not delay it but rather inhibit or limit the processing, depending on the load.

Option F claims attentional resources are limitless, which can't be right. That's contradicts the idea of limited resources, which is central to most attention theories, including load theory.

Option G states there's a general limit to attentional resources. That makes sense. Load theory does talk about limited capacity, so this seems plausible.

Option H says the ignored stimulus's processing depends on the attended's processing. Yes, that rings a bell. According to load theory, when the attended stimulus requires more processing (high load), there's less spare capacity to process ignored stimuli, so the ignored are processed less. So if the attended needs more, the ignored is processed less. So H would mean that the ignored's processing depends on the attended's load. That fits.

Option I says selective attention facilitates inhibition of return. Inhibition of return is a different concept, more about how we're slower to respond to stimuli that were previously attended. I don't think that's directly what load theory is about.

Option J suggests the ignored's processing affects the attended. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. The attended's load determines how much the ignored is processed, not vice versa. So J would be incorrect.

So, breaking it down. The question is about what attentional load theory posits. From what I remember, the theory states that when you have a high attentional load (the attended stimulus is complex or requires a lot of processing), you have fewer resources left to process ignored stimuli. So the processing of ignored stimuli depends on how much load the attended stimulus has. That would align with option H.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between H and J. Let me think again. The theory says that when the load is high (attended needs more processing), the ignored stimuli are processed less. So the extent to which the ignored is processed depends on the attended's processing needs. So H is correct because it says the ignored's processing depends on the attended's required processing.

Wait, but option H says the ignored's processing depends on the attended's extent. Yes, that's right. So H is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the options. Option A says the attended's processing depends on the ignored's. So that's the opposite. So H is correct.

Alternatively, I've heard the phrase that "perceptual load" affects how much the ignored is processed. High load means less processing of ignored, low load means more. So yes, H is correct.

So the correct answer should be H.

Attentional load theory posits that the extent to which an ignored stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus. This means that when the attended stimulus demands more processing (high load), fewer attentional resources are available to process the ignored stimulus. Conversely, when the attended stimulus requires less processing (low load), more resources are available for the ignored stimulus. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because it reverses the relationship, suggesting the attended stimulus's processing depends on the ignored stimulus, which is not what the theory states.
- **B** is incorrect as it refers to the number of tasks, which is more related to dual-task interference, not attentional load theory.
- **C** is incorrect because it mentions the unity of actions, which is not a core concept of attentional load theory.
- **D** is incorrect because it suggests the capacity of attentional resources is determined by the ignored stimulus, which is the opposite of the theory.
- **E** is incorrect because selective attention does not delay processing of the ignored stimulus; it limits or inhibits it based on load.
- **F** is incorrect because attentional resources are not limitless; they are limited, which is a central idea of the theory.
- **G** is correct in stating there is a general limit to attentional resources, but it does not specifically address the relationship between attended and ignored stimuli.
- **H** is correct because it accurately reflects the theory: the processing of the ignored stimulus depends on the processing demands of the attended stimulus.
- **I** is incorrect because inhibition of return is a separate concept unrelated to attentional load theory.
- **J** is incorrect because it suggests the ignored stimulus's processing affects the attended stimulus, which is the reverse of the theory.

The correct answer is **H**, as it directly aligns with the theory's explanation of how the processing of ignored stimuli is influenced by the processing demands of attended stimuli.

Answer: H
