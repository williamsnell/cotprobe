Okay, so I've got this question about DNA being the genetic material and how quantitative measurements support that. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that there were experiments showing DNA's role, like the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment and Hershey-Chase. But this question is about quantitative measurements, so maybe it's about the structure or amounts in cells.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Increase in DNA after cell division. Wait, during cell division, DNA replicates, so each daughter cell has the same amount. So maybe this is about DNA doubling before division. But does that directly show DNA is genetic? I'm not sure.

Option B: DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Oh, I remember that mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA. But the cell nucleus is where most DNA is. This might not directly support DNA as the genetic material because it's more about where DNA is found, not the measurement.

Option C: Constant DNA in body cells and half in germ cells. Oh, body cells are diploid, germ cells are haploid, so they have half the DNA. This is Mendel's laws related, but I'm not sure how that's evidence for DNA being genetic material. It shows DNA is involved in heredity, but maybe not direct evidence.

Option D: Varying RNA amounts. RNA varies because different cells produce different proteins. If DNA is constant and RNA varies, maybe that suggests DNA is the genetic material because it's the same across cells, while RNA changes. But wait, the question is about DNA measurements, so maybe not directly.

Option E: Adenine to thymine ratio varies. Wait, in DNA, adenine pairs with thymine, so their ratio should be 1, right? Unless it's talking about RNA, which would have uracil. So varying ratios would suggest maybe RNA is involved? Or maybe if the ratio is consistent, it supports DNA structure. Not sure how this ties to being genetic material.

Option F: Histones in cells. Histones are proteins around which DNA wraps. Their presence doesn't directly prove DNA is genetic; it's just part of the structure.

Option G: Complexity of organism and DNA amount. I think more complex organisms have more DNA, which makes sense if DNA carries genetic info. So this could be evidence because it correlates with the organism's complexity, implying DNA's role in genetics.

Option H: Synthesizing proteins from RNA without DNA. Wait, that sounds like mRNA translating to protein, which is part of the central dogma. But if DNA isn't involved, maybe it shows RNA can do it. But this would argue against DNA as the genetic material, so this option probably isn't correct.

Option I: Consistent DNA sequences across species. Like, similar sequences suggest common ancestry, which supports DNA as genetic material because it's passed down. But is this about quantitative measurements? Maybe not. It's more about the information in DNA.

Option J: Polyploid tissues having multiple chromosomes. Polyploid means more than two sets. So more DNA. But how does that show DNA is genetic? Maybe it's about gene dosage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about quantitative measurements supporting DNA as genetic material. So which options talk about measurements of DNA quantity?

Option C mentions constant DNA in body cells and half in germ cells. That's a quantitative measurement. If all body cells have the same DNA and germ cells have half, that's consistent with DNA being the genetic material because germ cells are haploid. This supports the idea that DNA is passed on during reproduction. But does this directly prove DNA is the genetic material? Or just support it?

Option G talks about the correlation between DNA amount and organism complexity. More complex organisms have more DNA, which suggests DNA's role in storing genetic information. That's a quantitative measure too.

So which option is better as evidence? The experiments that showed that DNA is the genetic material often involved transforming bacteria with purified DNA, but that's not a quantitative measure.

Wait, the question is about quantitative measurements. So perhaps looking for an option that discusses how much DNA is in cells and how it relates to function.

Option C says that in all body cells, the DNA is constant, and germ cells have half. This is about the quantity. It suggests that DNA is replicated when cells divide, and germ cells have half for sexual reproduction. This supports DNA's role in heredity, which is part of being genetic material.

Option G is about the amount correlating with complexity, which implies DNA's role in determining the organism. So when an organism is more complex, it has more DNA, suggesting more genetic information.

Now, which of these is evidence that DNA is the genetic material?

I think both C and G are quantitative, but in the context of the question, which is about how the measurement supports DNA as genetic material.

Wait, another angle. DNA's constancy in somatic cells and halving in germ cells relates to Mendel's laws and the transmission of genetic material. So it's about how DNA is passed on, which supports it as genetic material.

Option G is more about the amount correlating with complexity, which also suggests DNA's role in genetics.

So which one is correct?

Looking back, the Avery experiment showed that DNA is the transforming factor. But that's not quantitative.

Another thought: the fact that all cells in an organism have the same DNA (except germ cells) suggests that DNA is the genetic material because it's consistent across cells, which is necessary for genetic information.

So option C says: "The constant amount of DNA in all body cells and half the amount in germ cells is evidence that DNA is the genetic material."

Yes, because somatic cells are diploid, germ cells haploid. So the constancy supports DNA being the genetic blueprint for each cell.

Alternatively, option G says the correlation between complexity and DNA amount supports DNA as genetic material. That's also a valid point because more complex organisms have more genes, hence more DNA.

But which is a more direct evidence from quantitative measurements?

In textbooks, the evidence often cited includes the constancy of DNA in body cells and the halving in gametes. So that's option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another thought: the amount of DNA correlates with the number of genes, which points to DNA being genetic. So option G might also be a contender.

Hmm. Let me think. The question is about quantitative measurements of DNA content being evidence. So if an organism's cells have varying amounts of DNA, that would not support DNA as genetic. But the fact that DNA is consistent in body cells (same genotype) and half in germ cells (for reproduction) supports DNA's role.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine how quantitative measurements of DNA content support the conclusion that DNA is the genetic material, we analyze the options provided:

- **Option A** suggests that an increase in DNA following cell division indicates DNA is the genetic material. However, this does not directly link DNA quantity to its role as genetic material, as it merely reflects DNA replication during cell division.

- **Option B** mentions the presence of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts. While this is true, it does not directly use quantitative measurements to support DNA as the genetic material.

- **Option C** states that the constant amount of DNA in all body cells and half the amount in germ cells is evidence. This is a quantitative measurement that aligns with Mendel's laws of inheritance, as somatic cells are diploid and germ cells are haploid. This consistency supports DNA's role in heredity and as the genetic material.

- **Option D** discusses varying RNA amounts, but this is unrelated to DNA's role as genetic material and focuses on RNA instead.

- **Option E** refers to the adenine-to-thymine ratio. While this ratio is consistent in DNA, it does not directly tie to quantitative measurements supporting DNA as genetic material.

- **Option F** mentions histones, which are proteins associated with DNA structure, but their presence does not directly prove DNA is the genetic material.

- **Option G** highlights the correlation between an organism's complexity and its DNA content. This suggests that more complex organisms have more genetic information, implying DNA's role in storing genetic material. This is also a quantitative measurement supporting DNA as the genetic material.

- **Option H** discusses protein synthesis from RNA without DNA, which contradicts the idea of DNA as the genetic material.

- **Option I** refers to consistent DNA sequences across species, which supports DNA's role in heredity but is not a quantitative measurement.

- **Option J** mentions polyploid tissues having multiple chromosome sets, but this does not directly link to DNA being the genetic material.

Both **Option C** and **Option G** involve quantitative measurements of DNA. However, **Option C** provides more direct evidence by linking DNA constancy in somatic cells and halving in germ cells to its role in heredity, which is a fundamental aspect of genetic material. Therefore, **Option C** is the best answer.

Answer: C
