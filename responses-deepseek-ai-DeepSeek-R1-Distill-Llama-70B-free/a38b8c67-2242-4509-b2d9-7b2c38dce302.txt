Question:

A reliable police informant telephoned the police to report seeing two men in a blue car selling narcotics outside a local movie theater. The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana. The driver of the van was subsequently prosecuted and charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances. He filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. His motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, as to the cocaine only.
B: denied, but only as to the marijuana.
C: granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.
D: granted, because the police didn't have probable cause to search the vehicle.
E: denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.
F: denied, because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle.
G: denied, but only as to the cocaine.
H: granted, because the police didn't have a warrant to search the vehicle.
I: granted, as to the marijuana only.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about evidence suppression in a criminal case. Let me try to break it down step by step. The scenario involves a police informant tipping off the police about a drug deal, and then the police searching a car and finding drugs. The defendant is trying to get the evidence excluded, so I need to figure out if the search was legal and if the evidence should be suppressed.

First, the facts: A reliable informant calls the police and says two men in a blue car are selling narcotics outside a movie theater. The informant gives detailed descriptions of the men and the license number. The police dispatch a patrol car, and a few minutes later, they find a car matching the description parked two blocks away. They approach and see one man fitting the description. Then, the police open the car doors, pry open a locked tool case in the rear, find an envelope with cocaine, arrest the driver, and then search the glove compartment to find marijuana.

The defendant is charged with two counts of possession. He moves to exclude both the cocaine and marijuana. The question is whether his motion will be granted or denied.

I remember that in criminal procedure, the legality of a search and seizure is crucial. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. For a search to be valid, the police generally need a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement.

In this case, the police didn't have a warrant, so we need to look at exceptions. The main exceptions I can think of are probable cause with exigent circumstances, the automobile exception, consent, and search incident to arrest.

The automobile exception allows police to search a vehicle if they have probable cause to believe it contains contraband, without needing a warrant. But the automobile exception doesn't apply to all parts of the vehicle; for example, it doesn't cover closed containers if they're not within the passenger compartment unless the police have probable cause to search those specific containers.

In this case, the police found the car parked two blocks away. They saw one man fitting the description. They opened the doors and searched a locked tool case in the rear. Then, after arresting the driver, they opened the glove compartment.

Wait, so the tool case was in the rearâ€”probably the trunk or back area. The glove compartment is typically in the front, within the passenger compartment.

Let me think about the timeline. The police approached the car, saw one man fitting the description. Then they opened the doors and searched the tool case. Found cocaine, then arrested the driver. After that, they opened the glove compartment and found marijuana.

So, the search of the tool case happened before the arrest. The glove compartment search was after the arrest.

I think the key here is whether the police had probable cause to search the vehicle. The informant was reliable, gave detailed descriptions, and the license number matched. So when the police found the car matching the description, they had probable cause to believe it was involved in criminal activity.

Under the automobile exception, if the police have probable cause to search the entire vehicle, they can do so without a warrant. So, when they found the car, they could search the entire vehicle, including any containers that might hold the contraband, as long as the containers are in the vehicle.

Wait, but for the tool case in the rear: if it's locked, does that affect anything? In some cases, if the container is locked, the police might need a warrant unless they have probable cause to believe that specific container holds contraband. But in this case, the police had probable cause to search the entire vehicle because of the informant's tip. So they can search the entire car, including the trunk and any closed containers within it.

So when they opened the tool case, which was locked, they were within their rights because they had probable cause. The cocaine found would be admissible.

After arresting the driver, they searched the glove compartment. At that point, the arrest had been made, so the search could also be justified under the search incident to arrest exception. That exception allows police to search the arrestee and the area within their immediate control. In a car, the passenger compartment and any containers therein are within the arrestee's reach, so they can be searched. The glove compartment is part of the passenger compartment, so searching it after arrest would be valid. Hence, the marijuana would be admissible.

Wait, but the initial search of the tool case was before the arrest. So the automobile exception applies there. Then, after arrest, the glove compartment is searched, which is a valid search incident to arrest.

So both the cocaine and marijuana were found through legal searches. Therefore, the motion to exclude should be denied as to both, meaning the evidence is admissible.

Looking at the options:

A:Granted for cocaine only. Doesn't fit because both searches were valid.

B:Denied only for marijuana. No, both are admissible.

C:Granted for both. No, both should be admitted.

D:Granted because no probable cause. No, probable cause existed.

E:Denied as to both. Yes, because both searches were legal.

F:Denied because police had probable cause. Yes, but this option is about the reason. The reason is that they had probable cause for the vehicle, so it's a correct reason.

H:Granted because no warrant. No, because exceptions apply.

I:Granted for marijuana only. No, both are admissible.

So the correct answer would be E or F. The options are E: denied as to both, F: denied because they had probable cause.

Wait, option F says "denied, because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle." That's accurate because the automobile exception applies when there's probable cause.

So both E and F are 'denied', but E is more general. Let me read the options again.

Option E: Denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.

Option F: Denied, because the police had probable cause to search the vehicle.

In the scenario, the police had probable cause to search the vehicle based on the reliable informant's tip. So the reason the motion is denied is because the search was valid under the automobile exception, supported by probable cause.

So the correct answer would be option E, as it's the outcome, but F states the reason. Wait, but the question is about whether the motion is granted or denied. So the correct answer is that the motion is denied as to both, which is E.

Wait, but let me think again about the tool case. The police found the car, had probable cause to search it. So they can search the entire car, including the trunk and any containers. So opening the tool case was permissible. Hence, the cocaine is admissible. Then, after arrest, the glove compartment is searched, which is permissible under search incident to arrest. So both pieces of evidence are admissible, meaning the motion to suppress is denied as to both.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: denied as to both.

The question revolves around whether the police's search of the vehicle and subsequent discovery of cocaine and marijuana were legal under the Fourth Amendment. The key issue is whether the police had probable cause to search the vehicle and whether the search fell under any exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as the automobile exception or search incident to arrest.

The police acted on a tip from a reliable informant, which provided sufficient detail (e.g., descriptions of the men, license number, and location) to establish probable cause to search the vehicle. Under the automobile exception, police can search a vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe it contains contraband. This exception extends to closed containers within the vehicle, including the locked tool case in the rear, as long as the containers are part of the vehicle.

The police first searched the locked tool case in the rear of the vehicle and found cocaine. Since they had probable cause to search the entire vehicle, this search was lawful under the automobile exception. After arresting the driver, they searched the glove compartment, which is part of the passenger compartment. This search was lawful under the search incident to arrest exception, as the glove compartment was within the arrestee's immediate control.

Both the cocaine and marijuana were discovered through lawful searches, making the evidence admissible. Therefore, the defendant's motion to exclude the evidence will most likely be denied as to both substances.

Option E correctly states that the motion will be denied as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.
