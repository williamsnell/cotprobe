Question:

A 37-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after she was found unconscious on her apartment floor. Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?

Options:

A: Pulmonary embolism
B: Acute liver failure
C: Myocardial infarction
D: Septic shock
E: Acute respiratory distress syndrome
F: Cerebral edema
G: Cerebral hemorrhage
H: Pancreatitis
I: Acute renal failure
J: Acute tubular necrosis

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a 37-year-old woman who was found unconscious and brought to the emergency department. There's a lot of information here, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at her symptoms and lab results. She's got erythema, warmth, and induration on her upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. That makes me think of something like pressure sores or maybe rhabdomyolysis because those areas are under pressure when lying down. Her serum creatine kinase is really high—10,300 U/L. I remember that elevated CK levels are a sign of muscle damage, which is consistent with rhabdomyolysis. That condition can happen from prolonged pressure on muscles, like if she was lying on the floor unconscious for a while.

She was found unconscious, so maybe she was lying there for a long time, causing muscle breakdown. The urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine. Both can cause altered mental status. Opiates might make her drowsy or unresponsive, and cocaine can cause agitation or even heart issues, but in this case, she was found unconscious, so maybe the drugs contributed to her being immobile.

Looking at her urine tests, the dipstick is strongly positive for blood, but the microscopic exam shows rare erythrocytes and pigmented granular casts. Wait, so the dipstick says blood, but when they look under the microscope, there aren't many red blood cells. That makes me think it's not a urinary tract issue causing blood, like a kidney stone or infection. Instead, the blood could be from muscle breakdown. Myoglobin from damaged muscles can cause the urine dipstick to react as if there's blood, but under the microscope, you don't see RBCs—instead, you see pigmented casts. Pigmented granular casts are a sign of acute kidney injury, specifically acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which can happen from rhabdomyolysis because myoglobin is toxic to the kidneys.

So putting this together, she likely has rhabdomyolysis from prolonged pressure leading to muscle damage. This has probably caused acute kidney injury. Now, the question is asking which condition she's at increased risk for over the next 24 hours.

Looking at the options:

A: Pulmonary embolism—I don't see anything pointing to a PE here, like no mention of DVT symptoms or signs.

B: Acute liver failure—Her liver might be affected by the toxins, but without specific liver enzyme levels, I'm not sure. The question focuses more on the kidneys.

C: Myocardial infarction—Cocaine can cause heart issues, but she's 37, and the CK is more about muscles than the heart. Plus, MI usually presents with chest pain and ECG changes, which aren't mentioned.

D: Septic shock—No signs of infection mentioned, like fever or elevated WBCs. The erythema and warmth are localized, maybe from pressure, not infection.

E: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)—Could be possible, but usually follows severe injury or infection. I don't see triggers here.

F: Cerebral edema—Possible if there's head trauma or other causes, but no info here. Plus, the focus is on her muscles and kidneys.

G: Cerebral hemorrhage—No history of trauma or symptoms suggesting a stroke.

H: Pancreatitis—Would present with abdominal pain, elevated amylase/lipase, which isn't mentioned.

I: Acute renal failure—This is possible. Rhabdomyolysis leads to ATN, causing the kidneys to fail.

J: Acute tubular necrosis—This is a specific cause of acute renal failure. Since the CK is high and urine shows pigmented casts, this is pointing to ATN.

So the question is, which is the best answer: I or J? The options are about what she's at risk for in the next 24 hours. Acute renal failure (I) is a broader term, while acute tubular necrosis (J) is a specific type. Since the question provides evidence pointing directly to ATN (pigmented casts, rhabdomyolysis), I think J is the more precise answer. But wait, sometimes in these tests, they might phrase it as acute renal failure rather than the specific type. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the risk over the next 24 hours. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to ATN, which in turn causes acute renal failure. So the immediate risk would be developing ATN, which is a form of acute renal failure. So the options are I and J. Typically, the term acute tubular necrosis is the specific pathology, while acute renal failure is the clinical syndrome.

But in the options, J is 'acute tubular necrosis' and I is 'acute renal failure.' So the question is which one is she at increased risk for. The presence of pigmented casts is diagnostic for ATN, so J would be correct. But sometimes, in medical testing, they might use the broader term. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another angle: the patient's CK is very high, leading to myoglobinuria, which causes ATN. So the next 24 hours, she's at risk for ATN, which is a form of acute renal failure. So the answer could be J, but the question might be considering acute renal failure as the broader category. Alternatively, the presence of ATN would lead to acute renal failure, so the immediate risk is ATN.

Wait, the question is about which condition she is at increased risk for over the next 24 hours. So the development of ATN would be the specific condition, leading to acute renal failure. So the answer would be J: Acute tubular necrosis.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman found unconscious with signs of muscle damage, including elevated serum creatine kinase (10,300 U/L), erythema, warmth, and induration on her upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. These findings suggest rhabdomyolysis, likely caused by prolonged pressure on her muscles while unconscious. Urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine, which may have contributed to her immobility. The urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood, but microscopic examination shows rare erythrocytes and pigmented granular casts, indicating myoglobinuria rather than true hematuria. Pigmented granular casts are a hallmark of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), a complication of rhabdomyolysis due to myoglobin's toxic effects on renal tubules.

Over the next 24 hours, the patient is at increased risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN), as the clinical and laboratory findings (e.g., elevated CK, pigmented casts) directly point to this condition. While ATN can lead to acute renal failure, the question specifically asks for the condition she is at increased risk for, and the evidence provided aligns most precisely with ATN.
