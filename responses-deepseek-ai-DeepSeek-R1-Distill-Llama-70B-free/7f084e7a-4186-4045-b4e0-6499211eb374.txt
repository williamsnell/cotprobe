Question:

A 13-month-old child is brought to the emergency department because of urticaria, swelling of the lips, and difficulty breathing immediately after eating an egg. A potential risk for hypersensitivity reaction is posed by vaccination against which of the following illnesses?

Options:

A: Hepatitis
B: Influenza
C: Pertussis
D: Poliomyelitis

Answer:

Okay, so I have this question here about a child having an allergic reaction after eating an egg, and I need to figure out which vaccine might pose a risk for a hypersensitivity reaction. Hmm, let me think through this.

The child is 13 months old and had urticaria, swelling of the lips, and difficulty breathing right after eating an egg. That sounds like an anaphylactic reaction, which is a severe allergic response. So the child is likely allergic to eggs.

Now, the question is about vaccination. It's asking which vaccine's administration could be risky for someone with an egg allergy. I remember that some vaccines are made using chicken eggs, so if someone is allergic to eggs, there's a risk of an allergic reaction to the vaccine.

Let me go through the options:

A: Hepatitis. I'm not sure which type, but I think Hep A and Hep B. Hep A is usually made in cell cultures, maybe not eggs. Hep B vaccine is made using recombinant DNA technology, so probably no egg involvement. So maybe not A.

B: Influenza. Oh wait, I remember! The flu vaccine is often produced using chicken eggs. So if you're allergic to eggs, getting the flu shot could cause a reaction. I think there are some precautions or alternative vaccines now, but traditionally, the flu vaccine has egg proteins.

C: Pertussis. That's part of the DTaP vaccine, right? I think those are made using inactivated bacteria, not eggs. So probably not C.

D: Poliomyelitis. The polio vaccine is usually the inactivated (IPV) type these days, which is made from killed virus. I think IPV uses monkey kidney cells or something, not eggs. So D might not be the right answer.

Wait, what about the MMR vaccine? Oh, but that's not one of the options here. So back to the choices.

Influenza is B, and that's the one made with eggs. So the child with an egg allergy would have a risk when getting the flu vaccine. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The child in the scenario experienced an allergic reaction after consuming eggs, indicating an egg allergy. This raises concerns about potential hypersensitivity reactions to vaccines produced using egg-based manufacturing processes. Among the options provided:

- **A: Hepatitis**: Hepatitis A and B vaccines are not produced using eggs. Hepatitis A is made in cell cultures, and Hepatitis B uses recombinant DNA technology, so there is no risk related to egg allergy.  
- **B: Influenza**: The influenza vaccine is traditionally produced using chicken eggs, meaning it may contain trace amounts of egg proteins. This poses a risk for individuals with severe egg allergies.  
- **C: Pertussis**: The pertussis vaccine, typically part of the DTaP vaccine, is made from inactivated bacteria and does not involve eggs in its production.  
- **D: Poliomyelitis**: The inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is produced using monkey kidney cells, not eggs, so it does not pose a risk related to egg allergy.  

Given this analysis, the influenza vaccine (option B) is the correct answer due to its historical use of eggs in the manufacturing process.  

Answer: B
