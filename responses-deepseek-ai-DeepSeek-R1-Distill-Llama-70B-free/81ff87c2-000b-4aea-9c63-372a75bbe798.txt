Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about fluid particle motion and find the normal and tangential accelerations. Hmm, I remember that in kinematics, acceleration can be broken into two components: tangential and normal (or centripetal). The tangential acceleration is the rate of change of speed, and the normal acceleration is related to the change in direction, right?

The given equations are x = a t and y = b t - c t². So first, I think I need to find the velocity components because acceleration comes from the second derivative.

Let me start by finding the velocity. The velocity in the x-direction is dx/dt, which is just a, since x = a t. So vx = a.

For the y-direction, dy/dt is b - 2c t. So vy = b - 2c t.

Wait, so the velocity vector v is (a, b - 2c t). The speed would be the magnitude of this vector. The magnitude is sqrt(a² + (b - 2c t)²). 

Now, the tangential acceleration is the derivative of the speed with respect to time. So let's find ds/dt, where s is the speed.

s = sqrt(a² + (b - 2c t)²)
ds/dt = [1/(2*sqrt(a² + (b-2ct)^2))] * [2*(b - 2ct)*(-2c)] 
Wait, wait, let me correct that. The derivative of (b - 2ct) with respect to t is -2c. So chain rule applies.

So ds/dt = [ ( -2c (b - 2ct) ) ] / sqrt(a² + (b - 2ct)^2 )

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me recheck. The derivative of s with respect to t is (d/dt)[sqrt(a² + (b - 2ct)^2)].

Which is (1/(2*sqrt(...))) * 2*(b-2ct)*(-2c). The 2's cancel, so it's [ (b-2ct)*(-2c) ] / (2 * sqrt(...)) )? No, wait, more accurately:

Let me write s = [a² + (b - 2c t)^2 ]^(1/2)
Then, ds/dt = (1/2) [a² + (b-2c t)^2]^(-1/2) * 2*(b-2c t)*(-2c)
The 2's cancel, so it's (b-2c t)(-2c) / [sqrt(a² + (b-2c t)^2)].
So ds/dt = (-2c (b - 2c t)) / sqrt(...)

Wait, but the tangential acceleration a_t is ds/dt. So that's what I have here. But wait, in the answer options, the tangential acceleration is written as 2c(b - ct) or similar, but in my calculation, it's -2c times (b-2ct) over the sqrt term. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The speed s is sqrt(a² + vy²), where vy is b - 2c t. Then ds/dt is [2 a * 0 + 2 vy * d(vy)/dt ] / (2 s) ) ? Oh wait, perhaps I should approach it another way. The derivative of s is the dot product of velocity and acceleration divided by s.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe the tangential acceleration is (a · a_tangential) or something. Alternatively, I remember that the tangential acceleration a_t is dv/dt, where v is the speed. So yes, that's what I computed earlier: dv/dt.

But wait, in my calculation, dv/dt is (-2c (b-2ct)) / s. Let me see the options. Looking at the options, I see that option G has a_t as 2c(b-2ct) divided by the sqrt term. But wait, in my calculation, it's -2c times (b-2ct) over s. So maybe I have a sign error. Or perhaps I messed up the derivative.

Wait, let's compute the derivative again. s = sqrt(a² + (b - 2c t)^2 )
ds/dt = (1/(2*sqrt(...))) * (2*(b - 2c t)*(-2c)) )
So the numerator is 2*(b-2ct)*(-2c) = -4 c (b - 2c t)
Divided by 2 s, so it's (-2 c (b-2ct)) / s.

So a_t = (-2 c (b - 2c t)) / s.

But looking at the options, option G has a_t as 2c(b-2ct) / s. So the sign is different. Hmm, but in the problem, perhaps the direction isn't considered, so maybe the magnitude is taken. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Another formula I remember for normal and tangential acceleration is a_n = (v × a) / |v|, and a_t = (v · a) / |v|.

Wait, no, wait. The tangential acceleration is (v · a) / |v|, and the normal acceleration is (|v × a|) / |v|.

So let's compute a first. The acceleration is the second derivative of the position.

Position: x = a t, y = b t - c t².

First, vx = a, ax = 0.

vy = b - 2c t, so ay = -2c.

So acceleration vector a is (0, -2c).

Wait, that's interesting. So the acceleration is constant because a is not changing with time. So the acceleration vector is (0, -2c).

Now, the velocity vector v is (a, b - 2c t).

So the tangential acceleration a_t is (v · a) / |v|.

v · a = a*0 + (b - 2c t)*(-2c) = -2c (b - 2c t).

So a_t = [ -2c (b - 2c t) ] / |v|.

|v| is sqrt(a^2 + (b-2c t)^2).

So a_t is [ -2c (b - 2c t) ] / sqrt(a² + (b-2c t)^2 )

But in the answer options, I see various forms. Let me look at option G: a_t is [2c (b - 2c t)] / sqrt(...). So same magnitude but opposite sign. Hmm, but acceleration is a vector, but when decomposed into tangential and normal, the signs might matter. However, in most cases, tangential acceleration's sign depends on direction. But the question is giving options without considering the sign, perhaps, or I'm missing something.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The formula (v · a)/|v| gives the tangential acceleration. So the sign would indicate whether it's speeding up or slowing down along the tangent. But the options probably just give the magnitude. Or perhaps the acceleration's y-component is negative, making a_t negative. So the options might have negative signs, but perhaps the given options take the magnitude, so perhaps the negative is incorporated into the expression.

But looking at the options, let's see. Option G says a_t = [2c(b-2ct)] / sqrt(...). But according to the calculation, it's -2c (b-2ct) / sqrt(...). So that's the opposite sign. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the acceleration.

Wait, the acceleration a is (0, -2c). So its y-component is negative. So if the velocity in y is positive, the dot product could be negative, leading to negative a_t. But perhaps the problem is using the magnitude in the options, so the sign is ignored. Alternatively, maybe I should think that a_t is the magnitude, so I take the absolute value. But in that case, the expression would have the same numerator as in option G, except for the sign.

Wait, perhaps I should check the normal acceleration. The formula for a_n is |v × a| / |v|. Since in 2D, the cross product's magnitude is |v_x a_y - v_y a_x|. 

v_x is a, v_y is (b-2c t), a_x is 0, a_y is -2c.

So cross product magnitude: a*(-2c) - (b-2ct)*0 = -2 a c.

Wait, no, wait. The cross product in 2D is scalar and given by (v_x a_y - v_y a_x). So it's (a*(-2c) ) - ( (b-2ct)*0 ) = -2 a c.

So the magnitude is | -2 a c | = 2 a c.

So a_n is (2 a c) / |v|, which is 2 a c / sqrt(a² + (b-2c t)^2 )

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option G gives a_n as (2ca) / sqrt(a² + (b-2ct)^2 ), which matches exactly.

So according to this, a_n is correct in option G, and a_t would be [ -2c (b-2ct) ] / sqrt(...). But in option G, a_t is written as [2c (b-2ct) ] / sqrt(...). So the sign is opposite.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a_t. Let me think again: a_t is (v · a ) / |v|.

v is (a, b-2ct), a is (0, -2c).

v · a = a*0 + (b-2ct)*(-2c) = -2c (b - 2ct) = -2c b + 4 c² t.

So a_t is [ -2c (b - 2 c t) ] / sqrt(a² + (b-2 c t)^2 )

But in option G, the a_t is [2c (b - 2 c t) ] / sqrt(...). So it's positive, whereas my calculation gives negative. That's a problem. Unless the options have a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the direction of acceleration. The acceleration is (0, -2c), so it's pointing downward. If the velocity's y-component is positive, then the dot product would be negative, leading to negative a_t, which would indicate that the speed is decreasing. But the answer options may not account for the sign, or perhaps I should take absolute values.

Alternatively, maybe I should think that the tangential acceleration is the magnitude, so the sign doesn't matter, and the expression would be the same as in option G. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the formula gives a signed value.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option G has a_t as 2c(b-2ct)/sqrt(...). My calculation says it's negative of that. So perhaps none of the options match exactly. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me go back to the formula for a_t. Another way to compute a_t is dv/dt, where v is the speed, which is the magnitude of the velocity.

So v = sqrt( a² + (b - 2 c t)^2 )

dv/dt = [ ( 0 + 2 (b - 2 c t) (-2 c) ) ] / ( 2 sqrt(a² + (b-2ct)^2) ) )

So [ -4 c (b - 2ct) ] / [ 2 sqrt(...) ) ] = [ -2 c (b -2 ct) ] / sqrt(...)

Which is the same result as before. So a_t is negative. But in option G, a_t is positive. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, let me look at the other options. Let's see option D: a_n is c / sqrt(...), which doesn't match what I have. Option G has a_n correctly as 2ca over the sqrt.

Option B: a_n is 2cb over a different sqrt, which doesn't match. Option E: a_n is 2ca over sqrt(a² + (b+2ct)^2), but our a_n is over (b-2ct). So no.

Option G seems to have the correct a_n, but the a_t in G is positive. So if the problem gives the magnitude of a_t, then option G would be correct, but if it's considering the sign, then perhaps it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of acceleration. Let me double-check the acceleration.

Given y = bt - c t². So dy/dt = b - 2 c t. So acceleration is d²y/dt² = -2 c. So a_y is -2 c. So the acceleration vector is (0, -2c). So that's correct.

Another thought: Maybe the question is asking for the magnitude of the tangential acceleration. In that case, the sign wouldn't matter, and option G would be correct.

But in the options, the expressions have the variables as given, so perhaps the negative sign is part of the expression. So if the correct a_t is negative, but none of the options match that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option G: a_n is (2ca)/sqrt(a² + (b-2ct)^2 ), which matches. a_t is [2c(b-2ct)]/sqrt(...), which is positive but in our calculation it's negative. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the expression without considering the sign. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for a_t. Wait, I think another approach to find a_t is to compute it as (v · a) / |v|, which would give the same result as dv/dt.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the velocity vector and the acceleration vector. The tangential acceleration is the component of the acceleration in the direction of the velocity.

So if the acceleration is (0, -2c), and the velocity is (a, b-2ct), then the projection of a onto v is (v · a)/|v|² times v. But the magnitude of that projection is a_t.

So a_t is (v · a)/|v|. Which as we computed is [ -2c (b-2ct) ] / |v|.

So in the options, if G's a_t is positive, that would imply perhaps that it's taking the magnitude, but the actual expression is negative. So maybe the correct option is not present, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I got the velocity wrong. Wait, x is a t, so vx is a, correct. y is bt - c t², so vy is b - 2c t, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the acceleration is not constant. Oh wait, no, a is (0, -2c), which is constant. So the acceleration vector is indeed constant, pointing downward with magnitude 2c.

Wait, let me think of the formula for normal acceleration. I found a_n = (2 a c)/|v|.

Looking at the options, option G gives a_n as (2ca)/sqrt(a² + (b-2ct)^2 ), which is correct.

As for a_t, it's [ -2c (b-2ct) ] / |v|.

Looking at the options, option G's a_t is [2c (b-2ct) ] / |v|.

So the sign is opposite. Unless the problem expects the magnitude, in which case, the sign doesn't matter, but the options give it as positive.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the acceleration. Let me check again: the acceleration is (0, -2c), correct. So when I compute v · a, it's (a, b-2ct) · (0, -2c) = 0 + (b-2ct)(-2c) = -2c (b-2ct). So that's correct.

So the a_t is negative of option G's a_t.

Wait, looking at the other options, perhaps option B or E. Let me check option E's a_t: [2c (b + 2ct) ] / sqrt(a² + (b + 2ct)^2 ). No, that doesn't match.

Option B's a_t is [2c(a + 2ct) ] / sqrt(a² + (b + 2ct)^2 ). No, that's not matching.

Option G's a_t is [2c (b-2ct) ] / sqrt(...), which is same as my calculation except for the sign. So perhaps the correct answer is option G, assuming that the problem is taking the magnitude of a_t, or perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the magnitude of the acceleration vector, and then find the components.

The magnitude of acceleration is sqrt(0^2 + (-2c)^2 )= 2c.

Then, the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors can be found using the dot product.

The dot product v · a = |v||a| cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them.

So cos(theta) = (v · a) / (|v||a| ) 

Which is [ -2c (b-2ct) ] / [ |v| * 2c ] 

= [ - (b-2ct) ] / |v|.

So the angle's cosine is -(b-2ct)/|v|.

Then, the tangential acceleration is a_t = |a| cos(theta) = 2c * [ - (b-2ct) / |v| ]

Which is -2c (b-2ct) / |v|.

Which matches what I found earlier.

So the a_t is negative, but option G has it positive. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the magnitude of a_t, so the absolute value. Then, option G would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the expressions given in the options.

Option G has a_n = (2ca)/sqrt(a² + (b-2ct)^2 ), which is correct. a_t is (2c (b-2ct) ) / same denominator.

But according to our calculation, a_t is negative of that. So perhaps the correct option is not present, but
