Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the 'extension pattern' identified by Parker in 1976. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Parker studied work-leisure patterns, categorizing them into different types. The options provided are A through I, each describing a different pattern. The question is asking specifically about the 'extension pattern'.

From what I recall, Parker's work categorized people into different groups based on how they viewed work and leisure. The main types I remember are extension, opposition, neutrality, and probably a couple more.

The extension pattern, if I'm not mistaken, refers to people whose work and leisure activities are closely connected. They don't see a clear separation between the two. So their leisure time is an extension of their work interests. This would likely apply to people who are really passionate about their jobs or have jobs that naturally blend into their personal time.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Part-time employees integrating work and leisure. Not sure, but I thought extension was more about the type of worker, not necessarily part-time.

Option B: Neutral balance, semi-skilled manual and clerical. Neutral sounds like a different category, maybe where work and leisure are separate but not opposing.

Option C: Students doing academic work during leisure. That seems more like they're just working hard, not necessarily an extension.

Option D: Unskilled workers seeing work as escape. That sounds more like the opposition pattern, where work is something to get away from, so leisure is opposite.

Option E: Neutral balance, but connected and oppositional. Hmm, not sure, but the wording is confusing. Neutral might mean separate but not conflicting.

Option F: Clerical and unskilled seeing leisure as escape. Again, this sounds like opposition. If work is alienating, they escape into leisure, so opposition.

Option G: Homemakers with chores in leisure. Maybe this is a neutral or some other category where work and personal life blur, but I'm not certain if this is extension.

Option H: Students procrastinating. That doesn't seem related to the concept here.

Option I: Professionals and skilled workers with work spilling into leisure. This fits with what I was thinking earlier. If someone's work interests extend into their free time, that's the extension pattern.

Wait, let me think again. Parker's extension pattern is where work and leisure are not separate. So people in extension might take work home or pursue hobbies related to their job. For example, a teacher might enjoy educational activities in their free time.

So looking at the options, option I says professionals and skilled workers whose work interests spill into leisure. That sounds spot on. Option B says neutral balance, which I think is a different category, maybe where work and leisure are separate but not opposed. Option D and F seem to be opposition, where work is something to escape from.

So I think the correct answer is I.

The 'extension pattern' identified by Parker (1976) refers to individuals whose work and leisure activities are closely connected, with work interests often spilling over into their free time. This pattern is characteristic of professionals and skilled workers who view their work and leisure as intertwined rather than separate. Among the options provided, option I accurately describes this pattern.

Answer: I
