Question:

A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician 1 day after the sudden onset of pain and swelling of her right knee. She has had no injury. Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?

Options:

A: Sodium pyrophosphate
B: Sodium urate
C: Aluminum urate
D: Magnesium pyrophosphate
E: Calcium pyrophosphate
F: Potassium oxalate
G: Calcium urate
H: Ammonium urate
I: Calcium oxalate
J: Calcium sulfate

Okay, so I've got this question here about a woman with sudden knee pain and swelling. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The patient is 63 years old and came in a day after the symptoms started. No injury, so probably not traumatic. She takes ibuprofen occasionally for mild osteoarthritis in both knees. Her vitals are pretty normal except maybe a slightly elevated pulse and respirations, but nothing too bad. 

On exam, the right knee is warm, erythematous, and has an effusion. It's tender with any movement, which makes me think of something causing joint inflammation. They did a synovial fluid aspiration, and the fluid is clear. Under polarized light microscopy, they saw positively birefringent rhomboids. 

Hmm. So, what do I remember about synovial fluid analysis? I think the main things they look for are the appearance and the crystals. If the fluid is clear, that might mean it's not infectious because purulent fluid is usually cloudy or turbid. But wait, no, sometimes crystals can cause clear fluid too. 

The key here is the crystals. Positively birefringent under polarized light. Let me recall: urate crystals are negatively birefringent. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals are needle-shaped and negatively birefringent. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals are usually rhomboid or rod-shaped and positively birefringent. Oh wait, but what's the exact birefringence?

Wait, the question says positively birefringent rhomboids. So positive birefringence means when the crystal is viewed under polarized light, it's brighter when aligned with the slow axis. I think CPPD crystals are positively birefringent. Whereas urate crystals are negative, so they appear darker when the polarizer is aligned with their crystal. 

So in this case, the rhomboid shapes and positive birefringence point towards CPPD crystals. CPPD deposition disease is also known as pseudogout because the presentation can mimic gout, but it's caused by different crystals.

Looking back at the options, the substances are various salts. The question is about deposition of which substance. So in CPPD, the crystals are calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate. So the substance would be calcium pyrophosphate.

Looking at the options, option E is Calcium pyrophosphate. Option A is sodium pyrophosphate, which I don't think is involved here. Similarly, the urate options are B, C, G, H, which are different forms of urate salts. 

So the correct answer should be E: Calcium pyrophosphate.

The patient is a 63-year-old woman presenting with sudden onset of pain and swelling in her right knee, without a history of injury. She has mild osteoarthritis and takes ibuprofen occasionally. On examination, the knee shows warmth, erythema, effusion, and exquisite tenderness with minimal movement. Synovial fluid aspiration reveals clear fluid with positively birefringent rhomboids under polarized light microscopy.

The key findings are the positively birefringent rhomboid crystals, which are characteristic of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. CPPD crystals are associated with pseudogout, a condition that mimics gout but is caused by the deposition of CPPD crystals in the joint. The positive birefringence and rhomboid shape rule out urate crystals, which are negatively birefringent and needle-shaped. Among the options provided, calcium pyrophosphate (Option E) is the substance most likely responsible for the findings.

Answer: E
