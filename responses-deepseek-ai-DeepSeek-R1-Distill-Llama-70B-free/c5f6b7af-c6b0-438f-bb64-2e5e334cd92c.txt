Okay, so I've got this question about adjusting GNP for price level changes. Hmm, I remember that GNP can be adjusted using the price level index to get the real GNP. The formula, I think, is something like dividing the nominal GNP by the price index (expressed as a decimal) or maybe using some base year. 

Looking at the data provided, each row has the year, money (nominal GNP maybe?), the price level as a percent, and then the adjusted GNP. The adjusted GNP is what we're supposed to calculate.

Wait, the question says "adjusting GNP for changes in the price level," which I think means converting nominal GNP to real GNP. The usual method is to take the nominal GNP and divide it by the price index (after converting the percentage to a decimal), multiplied by 100, or perhaps using the base year as 100%.

Looking at the data, the base year must be 1972 because its price index is 100.00%. So for each year, the real GNP would be (Nominal GNP) * (1972 price level) / (Year's price level). Or wait, no. Wait, the formula is real GNP = nominal GNP / (price index / 100). Because price index is like 100 for the base year.

So for each year, the adjusted GNP is Nominal GNP divided by (price index / 100). Let me check that. For example, for 1946, the money is $209.6 billion, price index is 44.06. So real GNP would be 209.6 / (44.06/100) = 209.6 * (100/44.06) = let's calculate that. 100/44.06 is approximately 2.27. So 209.6 * 2.27 is around 475.7, maybe. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options, let's take option B for 1946. Option B says 1946 is $440.6. Wait that doesn't match. Option C: 1946 is $475.7, which is what I got. So that might be correct.

But wait, let me check another year. Let's take 1951. The nominal GNP is 330.2, price index is 57.27. So real GNP is 330.2 / (57.27/100) = 330.2 * (100/57.27). Let me compute that. 100/57.27 is approximately 1.747. 330.2 * 1.747 is about 576.6. Looking at option C, 1951 is $576.6. So that fits.

Another one: 1958. Nominal is 448.9, price index 66.06. So 448.9 / (66.06/100) = 448.9 * (100/66.06) ≈ 448.9 * 1.513 ≈ 679.5. Option C has 1958 as $679.5. So that's correct.

Wait, let me check option A. For 1958, it's 679.5 as well. Hmm. So A and C have the same value for 1958. So maybe I need to check another year. Let's try 1964. Nominal is 635.7, price index 72.71. 635.7 * (100/72.71) ≈ 635.7 * 1.376 ≈ 874.3. Option C has 1964 as $874.3. So that's correct.

Now, 1968: nominal is 868.5, price index 82.57. 868.5 / (82.57/100) → 868.5 * (1/0.8257) ≈ 868.5 * 1.210 ≈ 1,051.8. Option C says 1968 is $1,051.8. Correct.

1972: nominal is 1,171.1, price index 100. So real is same as nominal, $1,171.1. Option C lists 1972 as $1,171.1. But wait, looking at the options, let me check. Option C has 1972 as $1,171.1, which matches.

1974: nominal is 1,406.9, price index 116.20. So real GNP is 1,406.9 / (116.20/100) = 1,406.9 / 1.162 ≈ 1,210.8. Option C gives 1974 as $1,210.8. Correct.

1975: nominal is 1,498.9, price index 126.37. So real is 1,498.9 / (1.2637) ≈ 1,498.9 / 1.2637 ≈ around 1,186. Option C has 1975 as $1,186.1. That matches.

So all the calculated values for each year match option C. So the correct answer must be option C.

To determine the adjusted GNP for each year, the formula used is:

\[
\text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{\text{Nominal GNP}}{\text{Price Index} / 100}
\]

This formula converts nominal GNP into real GNP by accounting for changes in the price level, with 1972 as the base year (price index = 100.00). Applying this formula to the data provided:

- **1946**: Nominal GNP = $209.6, Price Index = 44.06  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{209.6}{44.06 / 100} = 475.7
  \]

- **1951**: Nominal GNP = $330.2, Price Index = 57.27  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{330.2}{57.27 / 100} = 576.6
  \]

- **1958**: Nominal GNP = $448.9, Price Index = 66.06  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{448.9}{66.06 / 100} = 679.5
  \]

- **1964**: Nominal GNP = $635.7, Price Index = 72.71  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{635.7}{72.71 / 100} = 874.3
  \]

- **1968**: Nominal GNP = $868.5, Price Index = 82.57  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{868.5}{82.57 / 100} = 1,051.8
  \]

- **1972**: Nominal GNP = $1,171.1, Price Index = 100.00  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{1,171.1}{100 / 100} = 1,171.1
  \]

- **1974**: Nominal GNP = $1,406.9, Price Index = 116.20  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{1,406.9}{116.20 / 100} = 1,210.8
  \]

- **1975**: Nominal GNP = $1,498.9, Price Index = 126.37  
  \[
  \text{Adjusted GNP} = \frac{1,498.9}{126.37 / 100} = 1,186.1
  \]

Comparing these calculations with the options provided, the values match **Option C** for all years. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 1946: $475.7, 1951: $576.6, 1958: $679.5, 1964: $874.3, 1968: $1,051.8, 1972: $1,171.1, 1974: $1,210.8, 1975: $1,186.1**
