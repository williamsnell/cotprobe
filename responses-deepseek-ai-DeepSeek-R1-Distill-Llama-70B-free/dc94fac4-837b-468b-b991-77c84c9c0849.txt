Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses and focal lengths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about three lenses placed one after another, each with specific focal lengths, and the light is coming in parallel. I need to find out where the light will focus behind the third lens.

Wait, the focal lengths given are +10 cm, -10 cm, and +10 cm. So the first lens is a converging lens because it's positive, right? The second is diverging, and the third is converging again. They're placed 2 cm apart each. So the distance between the first and second is 2 cm, and between the second and third is another 2 cm. So the total distance from the first to the third is 4 cm. But I don't know if that matters right away.

Since the light is incident parallel, that means it's coming from a source at infinity, so the first lens will focus it at its focal point, which is 10 cm away. But wait, after that, the light will go through the second lens, which is a diverging lens. So I need to track the light through each lens step by step.

Let me try to model this as a system. The first lens takes the parallel light and focuses it. So the first image is at 10 cm from the first lens. But wait, the second lens is only 2 cm away from the first. So the distance between the first and second lens is 2 cm. That means the image from the first lens is 10 cm behind it, which is way beyond the second lens. So the light coming into the second lens isn't parallel anymore—it's converging towards that first image.

Wait, for the second lens, the object is at a distance of (10 cm - 2 cm) = 8 cm in front of the second lens. Because the first lens is creating an image 10 cm from itself, and the second lens is 2 cm behind the first. So the object distance for the second lens (u) is 8 cm. But wait, wait—wait, the object distance is measured from the second lens. So if the image from the first is at 10 cm from the first, and the second lens is 2 cm after the first, then the object distance for the second lens is 10 cm minus 2 cm (the distance between the lenses) which is 8 cm. So u = 8 cm for the second lens.

The focal length of the second lens is -10 cm. So using the lens formula, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Plugging in the numbers: 1/(-10) = 1/8 + 1/v. Let me calculate that. 1/v = 1/f - 1/u → 1/v = [1/(-10) ] - [1/8] = (-1/10) - (1/8) = (-4/40 -5/40) = -9/40. So v = -40/9 ≈ -4.444 cm. So the image formed by the second lens is virtual, 4.444 cm behind the lens. Wait, no, because the sign convention says that if the image is on the same side as the object (which is the case for a diverging lens), it's virtual and the distance is negative. So the image from the second lens is 4.444 cm in front of the second lens, or 4.444 cm behind when considering the direction of light. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, for a diverging lens, when the object is beyond the focal length, the image is virtual and on the same side as the object. So in this case, the object is at 8 cm, which is beyond the focal length of -10 cm (since |f| is 10 cm). So using the formula, the image distance v is negative, which means it's on the same side as the object, which is the incoming side. So the image from the second lens is virtual and located 40/9 cm ≈4.444 cm in front of the second lens.

So now, this image becomes the object for the third lens. The third lens is another 2 cm after the second. So the distance between the second and third lens is 2 cm. The image from the second is 4.444 cm in front of the second lens. So the object distance for the third lens is (4.444 cm - 2 cm) = 2.444 cm. Wait, no, wait. The image from the second lens is 4.444 cm in front of the second lens, so the object for the third lens is 4.444 cm minus the 2 cm separation between second and third. So 4.444 - 2 = 2.444 cm in front of the third lens. So u = +2.444 cm for the third lens.

The focal length of the third lens is +10 cm. Using the lens formula again: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v → 1/10 = 1/2.444 + 1/v. Let's compute 1/v = 1/10 - (1/2.444). Calculating 1/2.444 ≈ 0.409. So 1/v = 0.1 - 0.409 ≈ -0.309. So v ≈ -3.236 cm. Hmm, but wait, that would mean the image is 3.236 cm in front of the third lens because v is negative. But the question is asking how far behind the third lens the light comes to a focus. So a negative v here would suggest that the image is on the same side as the object for the third lens, which is the incoming side, meaning it's virtual. But that doesn't make sense because the third lens is converging, so if the object is within the focal length (since u is 2.444 cm, which is less than 10 cm), then it should produce a virtual image. But wait, the question says the light is incident parallel, so the first lens focuses it, but after the second and third, perhaps the final image is real?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the object distance for the third lens. Let me re-examine. The image from the second lens is at 4.444 cm in front of the second lens (since v was negative, meaning on the same side as the object). The third lens is 2 cm behind the second. So the distance between the second lens and the third is 2 cm. So the object for the third lens is the image from the second, which is 4.444 cm in front of the second lens. So the object is at 4.444 cm minus 2 cm (the separation) = 2.444 cm in front of the third lens. So u is positive 2.444 cm.

Wait, but for the third lens, u is positive because the object is on the incoming side. So the calculation is correct: u=2.444 cm, f=10 cm. So 1/v = (1/10) - (1/2.444) ≈ 0.1 - 0.409 = -0.309 → v≈-3.236 cm. So the image is 3.236 cm in front of the third lens, which is virtual. So the light doesn't actually focus behind the third lens but appears to come from 3.236 cm in front. But the question is asking where the light comes to a focus. So would the light converge behind the third lens? Or is it a virtual image and doesn't actually focus there?

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I should consider the system as a whole, calculating the effective focal length. Alternatively, maybe the approach of tracking each lens step by step is correct, but I might have made a mistake in the calculations.

Let me redo the calculations more carefully.

First lens:

f1 = +10 cm, object at infinity (u1 = ∞). So image is at v1 = f1 = +10 cm. So image is real, 10 cm behind first lens.

Second lens:

The object for the second lens is the image from the first, which is 10 cm behind the first. Since the second lens is 2 cm behind the first, the object distance u2 is 10 cm - 2 cm = 8 cm in front of the second lens. So u2 = +8 cm. f2 is -10 cm.

Using the lens formula:

1/f2 = 1/u2 + 1/v2 → 1/(-10) = 1/8 + 1/v2 → 1/v2 = (-1/10) - (1/8) = (-4/40 -5/40) = -9/40 → v2 = -40/9 ≈ -4.444 cm.

So the image from the second lens is 4.444 cm in front of the second lens (since v2 is negative, same side as the object).

Third lens:

The object for the third lens is this image, which is 4.444 cm in front of the second lens. The third lens is 2 cm behind the second lens, so the object distance for the third lens is 4.444 cm (from second) minus 2 cm (distance between second and third) = 2.444 cm in front of the third lens. So u3 = +2.444 cm.

f3 is +10 cm.

Again, using the lens formula:

1/f3 = 1/u3 + 1/v3 → 1/10 = (1/2.444) + (1/v3).

Calculating 1/2.444 ≈ 0.409.

So 1/v3 = 0.1 - 0.409 = -0.309 → v3 ≈ -3.236 cm.

So the image is 3.236 cm in front of the third lens, which is a virtual image. So the light doesn't actually converge to a point behind the third lens. Hmm, but the options don't include a negative number except for options C, F, and I. The closest is option I, which is -7.91 cm, but that's not what I got.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let me check using exact fractions.

For the second lens:

u2 =8 cm, f2 =-10 cm.

1/v2 = 1/f2 - 1/u2 → = (-1/10) - (1/8) → common denominator 40: (-4/40 -5/40) = -9/40 → v2= -40/9 cm ≈-4.444 cm.

Third lens:

Object distance u3 is (40/9 cm) to the left of the second lens. So the distance between second and third is 2 cm, so u3 is (40/9) - 2 = (40/9 -18/9)=22/9 cm ≈2.444 cm.

So u3=22/9 cm, f3=10 cm.

1/v3 = 1/f3 - 1/u3 → = (1/10) - (9/22) → Let's calculate this exactly.

Convert to common denominator, which would be 110.

1/10 =11/110, 9/22=45/110.

So 11/110 -45/110 = -34/110 = -17/55 → v3= -55/17 cm ≈-3.235 cm.

Wait, that's approximately -3.235 cm. So about -3.24 cm. So the image is 3.24 cm in front of the third lens, virtual.

Wait, but the question is about where the light comes to a focus behind the third lens. If the image is virtual and in front, the light doesn't converge behind the third lens. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options, which is confusing.

Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe I should consider the system as a combination of lenses, calculating the equivalent focal length.

Wait, combining lenses in sequence. Normally, when lenses are in contact, the equivalent focal length is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 +1/f2 +1/f3. But in this case, the lenses are separated by 2 cm each. So using the method for separated lenses may be more accurate.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps I should model the system as each lens acting on the light, considering the positions.

Wait, another approach could be to track the light as it passes through each lens, considering the positions.

First, the incident light is parallel, so after the first lens, it converges at 10 cm behind the first lens. Since the second lens is 2 cm behind the first, the distance from the first image to the second lens is 8 cm (10 cm -2 cm). So the object for the second lens is 8 cm in front.

Second lens: f = -10 cm, u=8 cm.

Using the lens formula again: 1/v = 1/f - 1/u → 1/v = (-1/10) - (1/8) = (-0.1) -0.125 = -0.225 → v≈-4.444 cm.

So the image is 4.444 cm in front of the second lens, as before.

Third lens is 2 cm behind the second, so the object distance for the third lens is 4.444 cm (distance to image) minus 2 cm (distance between lenses) = 2.444 cm in front.

Third lens: f=10 cm, u=2.444 cm.

1/v = 1/10 - 1/2.444 → 0.1 - 0.409 ≈ -0.309 → v≈-3.236 cm.

So the image is 3.236 cm in front of the third lens. So the light doesn't focus behind the third lens but appears to come from 3.236 cm in front. So the focus is virtual, and there's no real focus behind the third lens. But the options don't include this value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the separation. Let me think again. The distance between the first and second is 2 cm, and between the second and third is another 2 cm. So the distance from the first to the third is 4 cm.

Wait, when considering the image from the second lens, which is at 4.444 cm in front of the second lens, then the object for the third lens is that image. The distance between the second and third is 2 cm, so the object is 4.444 cm in front of the second, so from the third lens, it's 4.444 cm - 2 cm = 2.444 cm in front. So u3=+2.444 cm.

Wait, maybe I should use exact fractions.

So u3= (40/9 cm) - 2 cm = (40/9 - 18/9) =22/9 cm = 2 4/9 cm ≈2.444 cm.

So using u3=22/9 cm and f3=10 cm.

1/v3 = (1/10) - (9/22) → (11/110 - 45/110) = (-34/110) → v3= -110/34 = -55/17 ≈-3.235 cm.

So the image is 55/17 cm in front of the third lens, which is approximately 3.235 cm, so about 3.24 cm in front. So the light doesn't converge behind the third lens. But the question is asking how far behind the third lens will the light come to a focus. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe the light does converge behind the third lens but I'm miscalculating the image distance. Wait, perhaps I should consider the positions more accurately.

Let me try to think about it differently. The first lens creates an image at 10 cm. The second lens is 2 cm behind the first, so 8 cm away from that image. The second lens, being diverging, will create a virtual image. Then the third lens, being converging, might create a real image.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the position using the distances correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the system's equivalent focal length. But since the lenses are not in contact, the separation affects the effective focal length. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach: the first lens focuses the parallel light at 10 cm. The second lens is 2 cm behind the first, so 8 cm away from the first image. The second lens is a diverging lens, so it will form a virtual image. The image distance from the second lens would be negative, meaning on the same side as the object, which is the same side as the incoming light. So the image from the second lens is 4.444 cm in front of it, which is 2 cm behind the first lens (since the second is 2 cm behind first). Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model each lens's effect on the beam.

Wait, considering that after the first lens, the light converges to a point 10 cm behind it. The second lens is 2 cm behind the first, so the light is coming from a point 8 cm in front of the second lens. The second lens is diverging, so the light will diverge as if coming from a point 4.444 cm in front of the second lens.

Now, the third lens is 2 cm behind the second. So the apparent source is 4.444 cm in front of the second, which is 4.444 cm - 2 cm = 2.444 cm in front of the third lens. So the third lens sees an object at 2.444 cm. Since the third lens is converging, and the object is within its focal length (2.444 <10 cm), it will produce a virtual image. So the image is on the same side as the object, meaning in front of the third lens, not behind.

So the light doesn't converge behind the third lens. But the question is about how far behind the third lens it comes to a focus. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the first and third lenses are converging, so the overall system might converge the light further. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the entire system as a combination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use the concept of the effective focal length for the combination of three lenses separated by small distances.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to track the light through each lens.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the first lens focuses at 10 cm, which is 8 cm beyond the second lens. So the second lens, being diverging, will cause the light to diverge, making the rays appear to come from a point 4.444 cm in front of the second lens.

Then the third lens, being 2 cm behind the second, will have the object at 4.444 cm
