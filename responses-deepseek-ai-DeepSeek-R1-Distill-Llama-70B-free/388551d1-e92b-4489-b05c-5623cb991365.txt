Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Arthur's beliefs regarding values more fundamental than rights and desert. The options are A: justice, B: fairness, C: respect for other persons, and D: all of the above. 

Hmm, I need to think about what I know regarding this topic. I remember that in some ethical theories, certain values are considered more fundamental than others. Rights and desert are concepts often discussed in moral philosophy. Desert refers to what someone deserves, usually based on their actions or qualities, while rights are entitlements that individuals have.

I think the question is pointing towards John Rawls' theory of justice, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, maybe it's about Immanuel Kant? Or perhaps it's another philosopher. Oh wait, maybe it's Arthur, as in the question, but I'm not certain. So I need to figure out what each option represents.

Option A is justice. Justice is a broad concept, often considered a fundamental value. It's about fairness and morality in the way people are treated. Option B is fairness, which sounds similar to justice but maybe a bit narrower. Fairness is about equity and impartial treatment. Option C is respect for other persons, which is a key principle in Kantian ethics. Kant emphasized treating people as ends in themselves, not means to an end, which ties into respect for persons.

Wait, the question is about what Arthur believes is more fundamental than rights and desert. So I'm trying to recall if there's a philosopher named Arthur who discussed these concepts. Alternatively, maybe it's a reference to a specific theory or lecture I've come across.

Oh, wait! I think this might be about Arthur Ripstein. Ripstein wrote "Force and Freedom: Kant's Legal and Political Philosophy." In that work, he discusses how respect for persons is a fundamental principle. He argues that respect for others is more basic than considerations of rights and desert. So in his view, respect for other persons (option C) is more fundamental.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to John Rawls, who in "A Theory of Justice" talks about justice as fairness. Rawls argues that justice is the first virtue of social institutions, and his theory of justice as fairness is more fundamental than other moral concepts. So in that case, justice (A) and fairness (B) would be candidates. But the question is about Arthur, so I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up different philosophers. Let me clarify. The question is about Arthur, so perhaps it's a different thinker. Alternatively, maybe it's a question from a textbook where Arthur is a character or a name used in the examples.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D, all of the above. But I need to think carefully. If Arthur believes that all these values are more fundamental than rights and desert, then D would be correct. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, going back to Ripstein, he focuses on respect for persons as a fundamental principle in Kant's philosophy. So for Ripstein, respect is more fundamental. So option C would be correct. But the question is about Arthur, and I'm not sure if Arthur here refers to Ripstein or someone else.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different thinker. Perhaps it's about Arthur Schopenhauer, but I don't think he focused on these concepts in that way. Or maybe it's about Arthur Danto, but I don't recall him discussing these particular values.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the context of the question. It says "Arthur believes is more fundamental than rights and desert." So it's looking for a value that Arthur considers more basic than these two.

If the correct answer is respect for other persons, then option C would be the choice. But if it's about justice or fairness, then A or B. Alternatively, if all of them are considered more fundamental, D would be correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Rights and desert are both concepts that are often secondary to more foundational principles. For example, in some theories, rights are derived from more basic principles like respect or justice.

If Arthur thinks that justice is more fundamental, then option A. If fairness is more fundamental, then B. If respect, then C. Or if he thinks all three are more fundamental, then D.

Wait, another angle: sometimes justice and fairness are used interchangeably, but they can have distinct meanings. Justice often refers to the overall moral rightness, while fairness is about evenhandedness. Respect for persons is about dignity and worth.

If Arthur's view is that respect for persons underpins both justice and fairness, then respect would be more fundamental. So in that case, option C would be correct.

Alternatively, if Arthur argues that justice (as a broader concept) is more fundamental than rights and desert, then A is correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure which philosopher the question is referring to. Since the question is about Arthur, perhaps it's a specific reference from a text or lecture I've studied.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D: all of the above. That is, Arthur believes that all three—justice, fairness, and respect—are more fundamental than rights and desert. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, I think that in some ethical theories, respect for persons is the foundation, and justice and fairness are built upon that. So respect would be more fundamental than justice and fairness, which in turn are more fundamental than rights and desert. So in that case, the most fundamental would be respect, making option C correct.

I'm going to go with option C: respect for other persons. So the answer is C.

The question asks which value Arthur believes is more fundamental than rights and desert. The options are justice (A), fairness (B), respect for other persons (C), and all of the above (D). 

To determine the correct answer, it's important to consider the philosophical context. The discussion revolves around whether justice, fairness, or respect for other persons is more fundamental. Arthur Ripstein, in his work on Kant's legal and political philosophy, emphasizes respect for persons as a foundational principle, arguing that it underpins other concepts like justice and fairness. This suggests that respect for other persons (C) is more fundamental than rights and desert.

On the other hand, John Rawls' theory of justice as fairness might suggest that justice (A) or fairness (B) could be the answer. However, the question specifically refers to Arthur, which aligns more closely with Ripstein's emphasis on respect for persons. While option D (all of the above) could be considered, the analysis leans toward respect for persons being the most fundamental value.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C
