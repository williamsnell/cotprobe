Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The reaction given is C(s) + 2 H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2(g). I need to find ΔH and ΔE at 25°C. The data provided includes heats of formation and a heat of combustion for methane.

Hmm, I remember that the heat of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for H2O(g), the ΔHf is -57.8 kcal/mol. Similarly, methane (CH4) has a ΔHf of -17.9 kcal/mol. The heat of combustion for CH4 is -192.2 kcal, which I think is the enthalpy change when methane burns completely to CO2 and H2O(g).

Wait, but the reaction in the problem doesn't involve methane. So maybe I need to relate it somehow using Hess's Law. I think Hess's Law allows us to calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction using other known reactions.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Write down the given reaction and the relevant thermochemical equations from the data.
2. Manipulate these equations to get the target reaction by adding or subtracting them, which will give me ΔH.
3. Then, I'll need to find ΔE, which is the change in energy. I remember that ΔH = ΔE + Δ(n gas) RT, but since we're dealing with calories and not joules, and temperature is in Celsius (25°C is 298 K), but wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Oh right, ΔH = ΔE + Δn_gas * R*T. But wait, since R is in different units here, I might need to convert it. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a simpler approach, considering that Δn_gas is small and perhaps using an approximation.

So first, let's get the target reaction. The given reaction is:

C(s) + 2 H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2(g)

I need to find ΔH for this. Let's think about the data. We have the heat of formation of H2O and CH4, and the combustion of CH4.

The combustion of methane is:
CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)     ΔH_comb = -192.2 kcal

But in the given data, the heat of combustion is given, which is exothermic (-), so it's releasing heat. So the products have lower enthalpy than reactants.

Wait, but how does that help with the target reaction? Maybe I should write the formation reactions.

The standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) reactions are:

1. H2O(g): H2(g) + ½ O2(g) → H2O(g)      ΔH = -57.8 kcal
2. CH4(g): C(s) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g)        ΔH = -17.9 kcal

Also, the combustion reaction of CH4 is:

CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)      ΔH = -192.2 kcal

I need to find the ΔH for the target reaction. Let me think about how to get there.

Let me try to break down the target reaction. The target reaction has C(s) as a reactant. So perhaps I can involve the formation of CH4 and then use the combustion.

Wait, let me think about each substance in the target reaction.

The products are CO2 and H2. So maybe I can write the formation reactions of these and subtract the reactants' formation.

Wait, the target reaction is:

C(s) + 2 H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2(g)

I can write each substance's formation:

C(s): by definition, ΔHf is zero because it's an element in its standard state.

H2O(g): ΔHf = -57.8 kcal/mol × 2 → since there are 2 moles in the reactants.

CO2(g): ΔHf is something I don't have directly, but I can get it from the combustion reaction.

Wait, the combustion reaction of CH4 gives CO2 and H2O. Let me write the ΔHf for CO2. Because the combustion of CH4 can be broken down into formation reactions.

Alternatively, I can consider the combustion reaction as:

CH4 → CO2 + 2 H2O (but actually, the balanced equation is CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O)

Wait, perhaps I should use the standard method of Hess's Law.

Let me outline the steps:

We need to find ΔH for the target reaction.

Let me write the target reaction as:

C(s) + 2 H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2(g)          (1)

I can think of this as the sum of other reactions.

First, let's write the formation reactions.

Reaction a: C(s) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g)          ΔH = -17.9 kcal (because CH4's ΔHf is -17.9)

Reaction b: CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(g)  ΔH = -192.2 kcal (combustion)

Now, if I reverse reaction a, I get:

Reaction a reversed: CH4(g) → C(s) + 2 H2(g)      ΔH = +17.9 kcal

Then, if I take reaction b, which is CH4 combustion.

So adding reaction a reversed and reaction b:

CH4 → C + 2 H2          ΔH = +17.9
CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O    ΔH = -192.2
--------------------------------------------
Add them: 2 CH4 + 2 O2 → C + 2 H2 + CO2 + 2 H2O

Wait, no, wait, let me sum them correctly. Let me write it:

From a reversed: CH4 → C + 2 H2
From b: CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O
Adding both equations:

CH4 + (CH4 + 2 O2) → C + 2 H2 + CO2 + 2 H2O

Wait, that's not correct because you can't add equations that way. Wait, each equation is:

Equation 1: CH4 → C + 2 H2       ΔH1 = +17.9
Equation 2: CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O   ΔH2 = -192.2

If I add these two equations:

CH4 + (CH4 + 2 O2) → C + 2 H2 + CO2 + 2 H2O

Which simplifies to:

2 CH4 + 2 O2 → C + CO2 + 2 H2 + 2 H2O

Hmm, but this doesn't seem to help me get the target reaction. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Let me think differently. The target reaction has C(s) as a reactant and produces CO2 and H2. So perhaps I can find the enthalpy change for C(s) reacting with water to form CO2 and H2.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the target reaction in terms of combustion and formation reactions.

Wait, another approach: Let's write the target reaction as:

C(s) + 2 H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2(g)

Let me split this into two steps.

Step 1: C(s) + H2O(g) → CO(g) + H2(g) (but that's not the reaction, I'm just thinking)

Wait, perhaps I should consider the standard enthalpies of formation for each substance in the reaction.

The standard enthalpy change of reaction ΔH° is calculated as:

ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)

So for reaction (1), the products are CO2 and H2, and the reactants are C and H2O.

So:

ΔH = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2*ΔHf(H2)] - [ΔHf(C) + 2*ΔHf(H2O)]

But I don't have ΔHf for CO2. However, I can find it using the combustion reaction of methane.

Wait, from the combustion reaction of CH4:

CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O   ΔH_comb = -192.2 kcal

This combustion can be broken into the sum of the enthalpies of formation of products minus reactants.

So ΔH_comb = [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2 ΔHf(O2)]

Since ΔHf for O2 is zero (element in standard state), this becomes:

ΔH_comb = ΔHf(CO2) + 2 ΔHf(H2O) - ΔHf(CH4)

We can solve for ΔHf(CO2):

ΔH_comb = ΔHf(CO2) + 2*(-57.8) - (-17.9) )
So ΔH_comb = ΔHf(CO2) - 115.6 + 17.9
ΔH_comb = ΔHf(CO2) - 97.7

We know ΔH_comb is -192.2, so:

-192.2 = ΔHf(CO2) - 97.7
=> ΔHf(CO2) = -192.2 + 97.7 = -94.5 kcal/mol

So now, I can plug back into the ΔH calculation for the target reaction.

ΔH for target reaction is:

[ΔHf(CO2) + 2*ΔHf(H2)] - [ΔHf(C) + 2*ΔHf(H2O)]

H2 is an element in its standard state, so ΔHf(H2) = 0.

C(s) is also an element, so ΔHf(C) = 0.

So:

ΔH = [(-94.5) + 0] - [0 + 2*(-57.8)] = (-94.5) - (-115.6) = (-94.5) + 115.6 = 21.1 kcal

Wait, that's positive 21.1 kcal. So ΔH is +21.1 kcal. Hmm, looking at the options, let me see. Option F is ΔH=21.3, ΔE=20.7. Close, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for ΔHf(CO2):

ΔH_comb = ΔHf(CO2) + 2*(-57.8) - (-17.9)
So:

ΔH_comb = ΔHf(CO2) - 115.6 +17.9 = ΔHf(CO2) - 97.7

So -192.2 = ΔHf(CO2) -97.7 → ΔHf(CO2) = -192.2 +97.7 → 97.7 is 192.2-97.7? Let me compute 192.2 minus 97.7.

192.2 - 97.7 = 94.5, but since it's -192.2, it's -94.5. So that part is correct.

So target ΔH is 21.1 kcal.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: ΔH=21.3 kcal, ΔE=20.7 kcal.

But wait, in my calculation, I got 21.1. So perhaps the options have rounded numbers. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the target reaction: C(s) + 2 H2O(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2(g)

ΔH = [CO2 + 2 H2] - [C + 2 H2O]

Which is [(-94.5) + 0] - [0 + 2*(-57.8)] = (-94.5) - (-115.6) )= 21.1 kcal.

So 21.1 is close to 21.3, so option F is ΔH=21.3, which is likely.

Now, the second part is to find ΔE.

I remember that ΔH = ΔE + Δn_gas * R*T.

Wait, ΔH = ΔE + Δn_g * (RT). But what's Δn_g?

Δn_g is the change in moles of gas.

In the reaction: C(s) is solid, so moles of gas in reactants: 2 H2O(g) → 2 moles.

Products: CO2(g) + 2 H2(g) → 1 + 2 = 3 moles.

So Δn_g = (3) - (2) = +1 mole.

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K, but wait, since we're dealing with kcal, let me convert units.

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 1 kcal = 4184 J. So R in cal units is approximately 1.987 cal/(mol·K) because 8.314 J/(mol·K) is about 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

Temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K.

So Δn_g * R*T = (1) * 1.987 cal/(mol·K) * 298 K ≈ 1.987 * 298 ≈ let's compute that.

1.987 * 300 would be about 596.1, but since it's 298, subtract 1.987 * 2 = 3.974 → 596.1 -3.974 ≈ 592.13 cal. Wait, but wait, no, wait, 1.987 * 298.

Alternatively, 298 * 2 = 596, minus 298 * 0.013 = approx 3.874. So 596 -3.874 ≈ 592.126 cal.

But wait, 1.987 * 298 = let me compute it properly.

298 * 1.987:

298 * 1 = 298

298 * 0.9 = 268.2

298 * 0.08 = 23.84

298 * 0.007= 2.086

Adding them up: 298 +268.2 =566.2 +23.84=590.04 +2.086≈592.126 cal.

So that's 592.126 cal, which is 0.592 kcal approximately (since 1 kcal = 1000 cal).

So ΔH = ΔE + 0.592 kcal

We have ΔH =21.1 kcal, so:

21.1 = ΔE + 0.592 → ΔE ≈ 21.1 -0.592 ≈ 20.508 kcal.

Looking at the options, option F has ΔE=20.7 kcal, which is close to 20.5. So that must be the correct option.

Wait, but let me double-check the sign. The formula is ΔH = ΔE + Δn_g R T.

Wait, wait, I think I might have gotten the formula wrong. Let me think about it again. Enthalpy (H) is equal to internal energy (E) plus PV. So the change in H is ΔE + Δ(PV). For ideal gases, Δ(PV) = Δ(n RT), since PV = nRT.

So ΔH = ΔE + Δn RT.

Wait, but in this case, since the reaction is at constant temperature, Δn is (moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants). So in the target reaction:

Reactants: 2 moles of H2O(g) → gas moles =2.

Products: 1 mole CO2 + 2 moles H2 → total 3 moles.

So Δn =3 -2=1 mole.

So ΔH = ΔE + (Δn) * R T.

So yes, that part is correct.

So plugging in, we have:

ΔE = ΔH - (Δn) RT.

So with ΔH=21.1 kcal, Δn=+1, R=1.987 cal/mol·K, T=298 K.

Calculating (Δn)*R*T =1 *1.987 *298 ≈592 cal ≈0.592 kcal.

So ΔE =21.1 -0.592=20.508 kcal, which is approximately 20.5 kcal. The closest option is F: ΔE=20.7 kcal.

So the correct option would be F: ΔH=21.3 kcal, ΔE=20.7 kcal.

But wait, let me check the ΔH calculation again. Because the options have ΔH=21.3, but my calculation gave 21.1. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔHf for CO2.

Wait, the combustion of CH4 is CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O, ΔH_comb=-192.2 kcal.

So using ΔH_comb = [CO2 + 2 H2O] - [CH4 + 2 O2].

Which is [ΔHf(CO2) + 2 ΔHf(H2O)] - [ΔHf(CH4) + 2*0] = ΔH_comb.

So:

ΔH_comb = ΔHf(CO2) + 2*(-57.8) - (-17.9) )

Which is:

-192.2 = ΔHf(CO2) -115.6 +17.9

So:

-192.2 = ΔHf(CO2) -97.7

So:

ΔHf(CO2) = -192.2 +97.7 = -94.5 kcal. That seems correct.

Then, for the target reaction, ΔH = sum products - sum reactants.

Products: CO2 (ΔHf=-94.5) and H2 (0).

Reactants: C(s) (0) and 2 H2O (2*(-57.8) = -115.6).

So ΔH = (-94.5 + 0) - (0 + (-115.6)) )= (-94.5) +115.6 =21.1 kcal.

Yes, that's correct.

So the options don't have 21.1, but F is 21.3. Maybe the calculation uses more precise values for R or T, but perhaps it's acceptable as an approximation.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option F.
