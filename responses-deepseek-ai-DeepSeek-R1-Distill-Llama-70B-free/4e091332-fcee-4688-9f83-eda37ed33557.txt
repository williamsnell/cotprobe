Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive material and dilution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The problem says that I added some radioactive material with an activity per unit mass of 45.5 s^-1 g^-1 to a liquid. Then I diluted it, and the activity per unit mass became 6.5 s^-1 g^-1. I need to find the dilution factor and the original amount of radioactive material added. Oh wait, the problem also says to assume that 100 mg was added. Hmm, but I'm a little confused about what exactly is being asked here. Let me think.

Wait, no, the question says "what is the dilution factor and the original amount of radioactive material?" So wait, they told me to assume 100 mg was added, but that's the original amount? Or is that the amount after dilution? Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear. Let me read again.

The first line says, "you add radioactive material whose activity... to a liquid and then dilute it." So the initial step is adding 100 mg, and then you dilute it. So the original amount of radioactive material is 100 mg, and then you dilute it. But the options are giving different original amounts. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting that. Let me reread.

Wait, the problem says "assume 100 mg of radioactive material was added." So the initial amount is 100 mg, and then it's diluted, leading to a lower activity per mass. So the question is about finding the dilution factor.

Wait, but the options give the original amount, which is given as 100 mg. So in the options, when they say "original amount," it's probably the amount before dilution, which is 100 mg. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but in any case, I'll proceed.

Wait, the problem asks for the dilution factor and the original amount. Wait, but the original amount was given as 100 mg. So perhaps I misread the problem. Let me reread.

Ah, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me read the problem again.

"You add radioactive material whose activity per unit mass was 45.5 s^-1 g^-1 to a liquid and then dilute it so the activity per unit mass was 6.5 s^-1 g^-1. What is the dilution factor and the original amount of radioactive material? Assume 100 mg of radioactive material was added."

Wait, so the original amount added was 100 mg. Then you dilute it, and the activity per mass becomes lower.

Wait, but the options are giving different original amounts, like 300, 800, etc. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about dilution in terms of volume, but since it's per unit mass, maybe it's a mass dilution.

Wait, activity per unit mass is given. So the initial activity per mass is higher, and after dilution, it's lower. So dilution factor is the ratio of the initial activity per mass to the final.

Wait, but I think the dilution factor is usually defined as the ratio of the concentration before to after dilution, but sometimes it's the other way around. I need to clarify.

Wait, dilution factor (DF) can sometimes be defined as the initial concentration divided by the final concentration. So if you go from higher concentration to lower, DF would be greater than 1.

In this problem, the initial activity per mass (A1) is 45.5 s^-1/g, and the final (A2) is 6.5 s^-1/g. So DF = A1 / A2 = 45.5 / 6.5.

Let me calculate that. 45.5 divided by 6.5 equals... Let's see, 6.5 times 7 is 45.5. So 6.5 * 7 = 45.5. So DF is 7.

So the dilution factor is 7. Now, what about the original amount of radioactive material? The problem says to assume 100 mg was added. Wait, but the options are giving different original amounts. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the original amount refers to the mass before dilution, but I think the 100 mg is the amount added before dilution. So the dilution process involves adding more liquid, which would increase the total mass, but the radioactive material mass remains the same.

Wait, but activity per mass is 45.5 before and 6.5 after. So the DF is 45.5/6.5 =7. So DF is 7.

So the dilution factor is 7. Now, looking at the options, let's see which options have DF 7.

Looking at the options:

Option F says DF is 7.0 and original amount is 600 mg.

Option I says DF is 7.5 and original amount 650 mg.

So in my calculation, DF is 7. So the correct answer would have DF 7.0.

But wait, the problem says the original amount is 100 mg, but the options don't have 100 mg. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the "original amount" refers to the mass before dilution in the solution. Wait, but if I added 100 mg and then diluted, the total mass increases. But the problem says "the activity per unit mass" â€“ that's specific activity. So the specific activity after dilution is lower because the same amount of radioactive material is now in a larger mass of solution.

Wait, specific activity (A) is in s^-1 per gram. So if you have m grams of radioactive material with specific activity A_initial, and you dilute it to a total mass M grams, the specific activity becomes (m * A_initial) / M.

Wait, so the formula would be A_final = (m * A_initial) / M.

So rearranging, M = (m * A_initial) / A_final.

So the dilution factor (DF) can be expressed as M/m, because M is the final mass, m is the initial mass of radioactive material.

Wait, but DF in terms of mass would be the factor by which the mass increases. So DF = M/m.

So M = m * DF.

From the formula, M = (m * A_initial) / A_final.

But DF is M/m = (A_initial / A_final).

So DF = A_initial / A_final.

Which in this case, 45.5 / 6.5 =7.

So the DF is 7.

So the dilution factor is 7.

Now, the original amount of radioactive material is given as 100 mg. But looking at the options, none of the options with DF 7 have the original amount as 100 mg. Wait, option F says original amount is 600 mg, which is 0.6 grams. That seems too much.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let's think again.

Wait, the problem says: "Assume 100 mg of radioactive material was added." So that would be m = 100 mg = 0.1 grams.

After dilution, the specific activity is 6.5 s^-1/g.

So the final mass M is:

M = (m * A_initial) / A_final.

Plugging in the numbers:

M = (0.1 g * 45.5 s^-1/g) / 6.5 s^-1/g.

Calculating that:

45.5 /6.5 =7.

So M = 0.1 g *7 = 0.7 grams, which is 700 mg.

Wait, so the total mass after dilution is 700 mg. But wait, the original mass was 100 mg, so the dilution is by 700 mg, which is a DF of 7.

But wait, the question is about the original amount. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the original amount of the radioactive material, which is 100 mg. But none of the options have the original amount as 100 mg. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read again.

The question says: "What is the dilution factor and the original amount of radioactive material? Assume 100 mg of radioactive material was added."

Wait, so the original amount is given as 100 mg. So perhaps the correct option is the one where DF is 7.0 and original amount is 100 mg, but looking at the options, none have that. So perhaps the question is misworded, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options: Option F says DF 7.0, original amount 600 mg. So that doesn't match. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the dilution factor is defined differently. Maybe DF is the ratio of final to initial activity.

Wait, no, because when you dilute, the activity per unit mass decreases. So initial is higher, final is lower. So DF would be initial over final, which is 7.

But another possibility is that the dilution factor is the volume or mass you add. Like, DF could be the factor by which you increase the mass.

Wait, in my calculation earlier, M = m * DF, where DF is 7. So M is 700 mg, if m is 100 mg. So the total mass after dilution is 700 mg, with 100 mg being the radioactive material.

But the options don't have 100 mg as the original amount. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the original amount of the solution, not the radioactive material. Hmm.

No, the question says "original amount of radioactive material," so that should be 100 mg as given. So the DF is 7.

Looking again at the options, the only one with DF 7 is option F. It says original amount is 600 mg, which doesn't match the given 100 mg. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 100 mg is the mass after dilution, not before. No, the problem says "100 mg was added," which implies before dilution.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem in variables.

Let me denote:

A_initial = 45.5 s^-1/g

A_final = 6.5 s^-1/g

m_radioactive = 100 mg = 0.1 g

We add this to a liquid, then dilute. Let the total mass after dilution be M grams.

The specific activity after dilution is A_final = (m_radioactive * A_initial) / M.

So solving for M:

M = (m_radioactive * A_initial) / A_final

Plugging in numbers:

M = (0.1 g * 45.5) / 6.5 = (4.55) /6.5 = 0.7 g = 700 mg.

So the total mass after dilution is 700 mg, and the DF is M/m_radioactive =700 mg /100 mg=7.

So the DF is 7, and the original amount of radioactive material is 100 mg. But in the options, the only option with DF 7 is F, which says original amount 600 mg. That doesn't match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the DF is defined as the ratio of the final activity to the initial. No, that would give 6.5/45.5 â‰ˆ 0.143, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the DF is the ratio of the initial mass to the final mass. So 100 mg to 700 mg, so DF is 100/700 = 1/7, which is 0.142. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps DF is the factor by which the concentration decreases, which is A_initial/A_final=7.

So DF is 7, which is option F.

But then the original amount is 100 mg, which isn't in the options. So perhaps the question intended to ask for something else.

Wait, perhaps the "original amount of radioactive material" is the quantity before any dilution, but when you dilute, you're adding more solvent, so the amount of radioactive material remains the same. So the original amount is 100 mg, and after dilution, it's still 100 mg. So the options must be incorrect. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the dilution factor in terms of volumes, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the solution's mass. So adding 100 mg of radioactive material to a certain mass of liquid, then diluting. But without knowing the initial mass of the liquid, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the original amount refers to the total mass of the solution before dilution, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the total mass before and after. But I think I've exhausted the possibilities. 

Given that the correct DF is 7, the only option with DF 7 is F, which says the original amount is 600 mg. But according to the problem, the original amount is 100 mg. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me recalculate.

A_initial =45.5, A_final=6.5.

DF=45.5/6.5.

45.5 divided by 6.5: 6.5*7=45.5, so yes, 7.

So DF is 7.

So the correct answer should have DF 7, original amount 100 mg, but that's not an option.

Looking back, perhaps I misread the question. Maybe the problem is considering the solution's mass before and after, but the original amount of radioactive is 100 mg.

Wait, the problem says "the original amount of radioactive material," which is 100 mg. So the options must have that. But none do, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the amount after dilution. No, the question is about the original amount before dilution, which is given as 100 mg.

Alternatively, perhaps the "original amount" refers to the mass before the dilution step, but that's the same as the 100 mg added.

I'm a bit stuck here. Perhaps the correct option is F, DF7, and original amount 600 mg, but that contradicts the given 100 mg. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, perhaps the specific activity is per gram of solution, not per gram of radioactive material. Oh wait, that's a different approach.

Wait, specific activity is typically per unit mass of the substance. So if you have 100 mg of radioactive material with specific activity 45.5 per gram, that means per gram of the material. But when you dilute it into a larger mass, say M grams of solution, the specific activity becomes 6.5 per gram of solution.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again.

Suppose the radioactive material is a solid with a specific activity of 45.5 s^-1 per gram. You add m grams of this solid to a solution, and then dilute to a total solution mass M grams. The specific activity of the solution becomes 6.5 s^-1 per gram of solution.

So the total activity in the solution is m * 45.5 s^-1.

The specific activity is (m *45.5)/M =6.5.

So M= (m *45.5)/6.5.

Given m=0.1 g, then M= (0.1 *45.5)/6.5= 4.55/6.5=0.7 grams=700 mg.

So the total mass after dilution is 700 mg. The dilution factor is M/m =700/100=7.

So the dilution factor is 7, and the original amount of radioactive material is 100 mg, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the options are considering the original amount as the total mass before dilution. Wait, when you add 100 mg of radioactive material to some liquid, the initial mass of the solution would be more than 100 mg, depending on the liquid's initial mass. But the problem doesn't give that information.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Looking at the options, the only one with DF7 is option F, which says original amount is 600 mg. But according to the problem, the original is 100 mg. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

45.5 /6.5 =7. Yes, correct.

M= m * DF =0.1 *7=0.7g=700mg.

So the total mass after dilution is 700 mg. But the question is about the original amount of radioactive material, which is 100 mg. So the options must be wrong, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the original amount as the total mass before dilution. But that would require knowing how much liquid was used, which isn't given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the solution's mass. So adding 100 mg of radioactive to, say, X grams of liquid. Then the initial solution mass is X +0.1 g. Then after dilution, it's Y grams, and the specific activity is 6.5.

But without knowing X, I can't compute Y in terms of X. So perhaps that's not the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the mass of the solution before and after. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the dilution factor is the ratio of the masses after and before. So DF= M/m_total_initial.

But without knowing m_total_initial, I can't proceed.

I think I'm stuck. According to my calculations, DF is7, and the original amount is100 mg, but no option has that. So perhaps the correct answer is F, DF7 and original amount600 mg, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach: the dilution factor is the ratio of the initial concentration to the final. So 45.5/6.5=7.

So DF=7.

Now, the original amount of radioactive material: problem says 100 mg was added.

So looking at the options, the only one with DF7 is F, which says original amount600 mg. But the problem says 100 mg. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the question is reversed, and the DF is final over initial. So 6.5/45.5= 1/7. But DF is usually initial over final, which gives a value greater than 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the DF is the factor by which the volume increases, but without knowing densities, I can't relate mass to volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition of DF, such as the ratio of the final activity to initial activity.

Wait, but 6.5/45.5=1/7. So DF
