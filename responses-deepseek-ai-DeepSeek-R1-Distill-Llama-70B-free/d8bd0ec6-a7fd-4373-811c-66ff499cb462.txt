Okay, so I've got this question about vitamin A and its functions. I'm a bit rusty on my vitamins, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which option is NOT a function of vitamin A. The options are A through D. I remember that vitamins have specific roles in the body, so I need to recall what each one does.

Option A says "Synthesis of the blood clotting proteins." Hmm. I know that vitamin K is really important for blood clotting. Like, if someone is on blood thinners, they're often advised to watch their vitamin K intake. So maybe vitamin A isn't directly involved in that. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll keep that in mind.

Option B is "Prevention of bone loss." I think vitamin A might have some role in bone health. Wait, calcium and vitamin D are the big ones for bones. But does vitamin A contribute? I remember something about too much vitamin A maybe being bad for bones, but I'm not sure about prevention of loss. Maybe it's more about maintenance. I'm not certain, so I'll hold onto that thought.

Option C is "Regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation." Oh right, vitamin A, specifically through its active form retinoic acid, plays a role in gene expression. It helps cells differentiate into their specific types. So this is definitely a function of vitamin A. So option C is a function, which means it's not the correct answer to the question.

Option D is "Boosting immune system function." I recall that vitamin A is important for the immune system. It helps with the integrity of epithelial cells, which act as barriers against pathogens. So a strong immune system support is a function of vitamin A. So D is a function, not the answer.

Going back to option A. Since vitamin K is for clotting, I think that's the one that's not a function of vitamin A. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, another thought: Are there any clotting proteins that vitamin A might influence? I'm trying to remember. Vitamin A is more about vision, immune function, skin health, and gene regulation. Blood clotting factors like prothrombin and others are dependent on vitamin K. So yes, A is the one that's not a function of vitamin A.

The question asks which option is NOT a function of vitamin A. Here's the analysis:

- **Option A:** "Synthesis of the blood clotting proteins" is primarily associated with vitamin K, not vitamin A. Vitamin K is essential for the production of clotting factors like prothrombin. Therefore, this is not a function of vitamin A.  
- **Option B:** "Prevention of bone loss" can be linked to vitamin A, as it plays a role in bone health, though excessive levels might have negative effects.  
- **Option C:** "Regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation" is a well-known function of vitamin A, particularly through its active form, retinoic acid.  
- **Option D:** "Boosting immune system function" is also a recognized role of vitamin A, as it supports epithelial barriers and immune cell function.  

Since vitamin A is not involved in the synthesis of blood clotting proteins, the correct answer is **A**.  

Answer: A
