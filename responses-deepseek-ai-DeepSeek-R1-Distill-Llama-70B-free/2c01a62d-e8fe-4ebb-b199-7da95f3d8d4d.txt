Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the major result of breastfeeding an infant. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what research suggests is the major result. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says stronger infant immunity solely based on the duration. Hmm, I know breast milk has antibodies that help immunity, but I'm not sure if it's just about the duration. Maybe other factors like the mother's health also play a role, so this might not be the right answer.

Option B is about the specific method used in feeding. I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe like the technique? I don't recall research emphasizing the method as the major result.

Option C mentions the attitude of parents during feeding. I think the bonding during breastfeeding is important, but is that the major result? Not sure, but maybe it's part of it.

Option D talks about predictable sleep patterns immediately. I don't think breastfeeding directly causes immediate sleep patterns. It might help with soothing, but I'm not certain this is the major result.

Option E suggests enhanced cognitive development exclusively due to nutrients. I remember reading that breastfed babies might have better cognitive outcomes, but is it only because of the nutrients? Maybe it's also about the physical closeness and stimulation.

Option F is oral stimulation and eating. Well, breastfeeding does involve oral stimulation, which is important for development, but I'm not sure if that's the major result they're pointing out here.

Option G: Long-term taste preferences based on breast milk flavor. I've heard that exposure to various flavors through breast milk can influence a baby's later food preferences. This sounds plausible, but is it the major result?

Option H: Development of a more diverse palate by one. This seems similar to G, but maybe more about the variety of foods they're willing to eat as they grow. I'm not sure if this is the primary outcome emphasized in research.

Option I: Intimate contact with the mother. Breastfeeding definitely promotes skin-to-skin contact and bonding. I think this is a major aspect, but is it the primary result according to research?

Option J: Increased physical growth compared to formula. I know breastfed infants might have different growth patterns, but I thought formula-fed can also grow well. Maybe breastfed have a slight edge, but I'm not sure if this is the major result.

Now, thinking about what I've learned before. Breastfeeding is known for providing antibodies that boost the immune system, but I'm not sure if that's the major result they're referring to here. Also, the physical closeness and skin contact are important for bonding and emotional development.

Wait, another thought: the World Health Organization and other health bodies often emphasize that breastfeeding promotes not just physical health but also cognitive and emotional development. So maybe it's about the intimacy and contact, which is option I.

But then I recall that breast milk contains nutrients that are optimal for brain development, which could tie into cognitive benefits. So option E talks about enhanced cognitive development, but it says "exclusively due to nutrient composition." I'm not sure if it's exclusive, as other factors like mother's interaction might play a role too.

Alternatively, option I, intimate contact, is a key aspect of breastfeeding. It's not just about the milk but the act itself, which fosters a close bond. So perhaps the major result is the intimate contact and the associated emotional and developmental benefits.

Wait, but looking at the options again, the question is about the "major result." I'm trying to remember if the primary benefit highlighted in research is the immune benefits, cognitive, or the bonding. I think the bonding is a significant social and emotional outcome, but physically, the immune factors and nutrients are crucial.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Another angle: what do most studies focus on when discussing breastfeeding outcomes? A lot of research points to the immunoglobulins in breast milk that protect infants from infections. So maybe option A is about immunity based on duration. But option A says "solely based on duration," which might not be accurate because other factors influence immunity, not just how long.

Alternatively, option I, intimate contact, is a major result because it's about the mother-infant relationship, which has long-term effects on the child's emotional well-being.

I'm a bit torn between options I and E, and maybe G. But I think the question is looking for the most direct result. Intimate contact during breastfeeding is a significant factor that contributes to the infant's development beyond just physical aspects.

So I'm leaning towards option I: intimate contact with the mother.

Research suggests that breastfeeding has several benefits for infants, including immune support, cognitive development, and emotional bonding. Among the options provided, the question asks for the "major result." While options like enhanced cognitive development (E) and immune benefits (A) are important, they may not encompass the full scope of breastfeeding's impact. Option I, "intimate contact with the mother," highlights the emotional and developmental benefits of the physical closeness during breastfeeding, which research emphasizes as a significant outcome. This intimate contact fosters a strong bond between the mother and infant, contributing to the child's emotional well-being and development. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

I: Intimate contact with the mother.

Answer: I
