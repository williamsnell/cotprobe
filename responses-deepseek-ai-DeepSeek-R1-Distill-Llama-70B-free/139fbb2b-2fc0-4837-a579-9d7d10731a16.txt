Question:

Bill purchased a can of Sipep from the Ajax Minimart. After he finished drinking the Sipep, Bill noticed that the can contained dead insects stuck on the inside bottom of the can. In a strict product liability tort action against Ajax, Bill must prove, among other things, that:

A: Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep.
B: Ajax knew or should have known of the defective condition
C: Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems with Sipep products.
D: Ajax actually placed the dead insects into the can.

Okay, so I've got this question about product liability, specifically strict liability. Hmm, I remember that strict product liability applies when a product is unreasonably dangerous, causing injury. But wait, the question is about what Bill must prove in such a case against Ajax.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. I think in strict liability, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant is a commercial supplier. So that makes sense because if Ajax is just a private seller, maybe strict liability wouldn't apply. So A seems important.

Option B is about Ajax knowing or should have known about the defect. Wait, strict liability doesn't require the seller to have knowledge of the defect. It's more about the product being defective, not about the seller's knowledge. So B might not be necessary.

Option C mentions prior notice of similar problems. I don't think prior incidents are a requirement for strict liability. It's more about the condition of the product at the time, not whether the seller had previous issues. So C probably isn't the right answer.

Option D claims Ajax actually put the insects in the can. That sounds like intent or negligence. Strict liability doesn't require intent; it's about the product being defective regardless of fault. So D isn't necessary either.

Putting it all together, the key here is that in a strict liability case, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant is a merchant or in the business of selling such products. So the answer should be A.

In a strict product liability tort action, Bill must prove that Ajax is a merchant selling Sipep. This is because strict liability applies to commercial suppliers, and proving Ajax's role as a merchant is essential. Other options, such as knowledge of the defect, prior incidents, or intentional acts, are not required for strict liability.

Answer: A
