Okay, I'm trying to figure out how Freudian theory accounts for homosexuality. I remember that Freud had some theories about psychosexual development, so I'll start there.

Freud talked about the Oedipus complex, where a child has unconscious sexual desires for the opposite-sex parent. If that's not resolved properly, it might lead to certain behaviors or fixations. I think unresolved Oedipal conflicts could play a role here. 

Wait, but how does that tie into homosexuality? Maybe if someone doesn't resolve their Oedipal issues, they might fear the opposite sex, leading them to be attracted to the same sex instead. That sounds plausible. 

I also recall that Freud didn't view homosexuality as a pathology in the way others did back then. He might have seen it as a result of developmental factors rather than a choice or a mental illness. 

Looking at the options, option D says unresolved Oedipal conflict and fear of sexual contact with the opposite sex. That aligns with what I was thinking. Another option, B, mentions latent desires from childhood, which could relate, but I'm not sure if that's the main point. 

Option E talks about lack of role models, which I think is more from other theories, maybe like social learning. Freud's approach is more about internal conflicts and the unconscious. 

So I'm leaning towards option D as the correct answer because it directly ties into the Oedipal conflict and fear, which are key Freudian concepts.
