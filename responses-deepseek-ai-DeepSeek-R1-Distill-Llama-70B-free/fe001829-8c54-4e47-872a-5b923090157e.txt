Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the solubility of magnesium hydroxide in water and in a NaOH solution. Hmm, I remember that solubility product, Ksp, is involved here. Let me think about how to approach this.

The compound in question is Mg(OH)₂. When it dissolves, it dissociates into Mg²+ and OH⁻ ions. The dissolution can be written as:

Mg(OH)₂(s) ⇌ Mg²+(aq) + 2 OH⁻(aq)

The solubility product expression for this would be Ksp = [Mg²+][OH⁻]^2. The given Ksp is 8.9 × 10^-12.

Part (a) is the solubility in water. Let's let the solubility be 's' mol/L. Then, [Mg²+] would be 's', and [OH⁻] would be '2s'. Plugging into the Ksp expression:

Ksp = s * (2s)^2 = s * 4s² = 4s³

So, 4s³ = 8.9 × 10^-12 → s³ = (8.9e-12)/4 → s³ ≈ 2.225e-12. Taking cube root:

s ≈ (2.225e-12)^(1/3). Let me compute that. The cube root of 2.225 is around 1.3 (since 1.3³ is about 2.197), and 10^-12^(1/3) is 10^-4. So s ≈ 1.3e-4 M. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Calculating cube root of 2.225e-12:
2.225e-12 = 2.225 × 10^-12.
Cube root of 2.225 is approx 1.3, cube root of 10^-12 is 10^(-4), so s ≈ 1.3e-4 M. Looking at the options, option J for part (a) is 1.3e-4, which matches.

Wait, but I should be precise. Let's compute it more accurately. Let me find s = (8.9e-12 /4)^(1/3).

8.9 /4 = 2.225, so 2.225e-12.

The cube root of 2.225 is about 1.3 because 1.3^3 is 2.197, which is close to 2.225. So s is approximately 1.3e-4.

So part (a) seems to be 1.3e-4 M.

Now part (b) is solubility in 0.05 M NaOH. NaOH is a strong base and will dissociate completely. So the OH⁻ concentration from NaOH is 0.05 M. But when Mg(OH)₂ dissolves, it contributes a little more OH⁻. Let me set 's' as the solubility here.

The total [OH⁻] = 0.05 + 2s. But since Ksp is very small, 2s might be negligible compared to 0.05. Let's check that assumption.

Assume 2s << 0.05, so [OH⁻] ≈ 0.05.

Then, Ksp = [Mg²+][OH⁻]^2 → 8.9e-12 = s * (0.05)^2 → s = (8.9e-12) / (0.0025) → 8.9e-12 / 2.5e-3 = (8.9 / 2.5) × 1e-9 = approx 3.56e-9 M.

Wait, but let me compute 8.9 /2.5. 2.5 ×3 =7.5, so 8.9-7.5=1.4, which is 0.56 of 2.5. So 8.9/2.5 = 3.56. So s ≈3.56e-9 M.

Looking back at the options, which option has (a) 1.3e-4 and (b) ~3.5e-9?

Looking at the options, option J is (a) 1.3e-4 and (b) 3.6e-9. So that's a match.

Wait, but let me double-check my assumption that 2s is negligible. If s is 3.56e-9, then 2s is 7.12e-9, which is way smaller than 0.05 (5e-2). So the assumption holds. So the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To solve the problem, we calculate the solubility of magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)₂, in (a) water and (b) 0.05 M NaOH using the solubility product constant \( K_{sp} = 8.9 \times 10^{-12} \).

---

### Part (a): Solubility in Water
The dissociation of Mg(OH)₂ in water is:

\[
\text{Mg(OH)}_2(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Mg}^{2+}(aq) + 2\text{OH}^-(aq)
\]

Let the solubility be \( s \) mol/L. Then, \([Mg^{2+}] = s\) and \([OH^-] = 2s\). The \( K_{sp} \) expression is:

\[
K_{sp} = [Mg^{2+}][OH^-]^2 = s(2s)^2 = 4s^3
\]

Substituting \( K_{sp} = 8.9 \times 10^{-12} \):

\[
4s^3 = 8.9 \times 10^{-12}
\]

\[
s^3 = \frac{8.9 \times 10^{-12}}{4} = 2.225 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
s = (2.225 \times 10^{-12})^{1/3} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L}
\]

Thus, the solubility in water is approximately \( 1.3 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L} \).

### Part (b): Solubility in 0.05 M NaOH
In 0.05 M NaOH, the hydroxide ion concentration is dominated by the strong base, so \([OH^-] \approx 0.05 \, \text{M}\). Let the solubility of Mg(OH)₂ be \( s \). Then, \([Mg^{2+}] = s\), and the \( K_{sp} \) expression becomes:

\[
K_{sp} = [Mg^{2+}][OH^-]^2 = s(0.05)^2
\]

Substituting \( K_{sp} = 8.9 \times 10^{-12} \):

\[
8.9 \times 10^{-12} = s(0.0025)
\]

\[
s = \frac{8.9 \times 10^{-12}}{0.0025} = 3.56 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol/L}
\]

Thus, the solubility in 0.05 M NaOH is approximately \( 3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol/L} \).

---

### Final Answer
The solubility of Mg(OH)₂ is \( 1.3 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L} \) in water and \( 3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol/L} \) in 0.05 M NaOH. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**J: \( 1.3 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{mol/L} \) and \( 3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{mol/L} \)**.
