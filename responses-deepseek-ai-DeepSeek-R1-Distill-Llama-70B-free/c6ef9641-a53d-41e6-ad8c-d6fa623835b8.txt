Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with thermodynamics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a vessel is completely filled with liquid water and sealed at 13.56 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 1.00 bar. Then, the temperature is raised to 82.0 degrees Celsius. I need to find the new pressure inside the vessel. They've given me the coefficients of volume expansion for water and the vessel, and the compressibility of water.

Hmm, coefficients of volume expansion... right, the volumetric expansion. I remember that when temperature increases, materials expand. But since the vessel is sealed, the volume of the system is fixed, right? So the expansion of the water and the vessel must be considered together.

Wait, the vessel is sealed, so the total volume doesn't change. But both the water and the vessel will expand when heated. So the net expansion would be the difference between the expansion of the water and the vessel. Because if the water expands more than the vessel, the pressure would increase. If the vessel expands more, maybe the pressure decreases? But in this case, I think the vessel is solid, so it's probably less expandable than the liquid. Or maybe the other way around. I'm not sure, but I'll work it out.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial temperature, T1 = 13.56°C
- Final temperature, T2 = 82.0°C
- Initial pressure, P1 = 1.00 bar
- β_water = 2.04e-4 K⁻¹
- β_vessel = 1.42e-4 K⁻¹
- κ_water = 4.59e-5 bar⁻¹

I think β is the coefficient of volume expansion, so for a temperature change ΔT, the volume change is β * V * ΔT. Since both the vessel and the water expand, but the vessel is rigid, the actual volume change of the water would be constrained by the vessel's expansion. So the effective expansion is (β_water - β_vessel) times V times ΔT.

Wait, because if the vessel expands, it allows a bit more volume for the water. So the net expansion would be (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT. If β_water is higher than β_vessel, then the water would try to expand more than the vessel can accommodate, leading to an increase in pressure.

So the change in volume of water relative to the vessel is ΔV = V0 * (β_water - β_vessel) * ΔT.

But since the vessel's volume increases by β_vessel * V0 * ΔT, the water's volume would want to increase more than that. So the excess is (β_water - β_vessel) * V0 * ΔT. But since the vessel can't expand enough, the water is compressed? Or maybe the water's expansion is constrained, leading to increased pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the expansion of water relative to the vessel. Let me think in terms of the equation.

The idea is that the volume of the system (vessel + water) is fixed. So the change in volume of the water is equal to the negative change in volume of the vessel? Wait, no. Wait, the vessel and the water are both expanding, but the total volume is fixed. So the vessel's expansion provides some room, so the water's expansion beyond that would cause pressure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the change in volume that the water would undergo, subtract the change in volume that the vessel undergoes, and use that to find the pressure change.

So, the total volume change of the water is β_water * V_water * ΔT. The volume change of the vessel is β_vessel * V_vessel * ΔT. But since the vessel is sealed, the volume can't change, which suggests that the expansion of the vessel is allowed, but since it's a sealed container, perhaps the vessel's expansion is irrelevant? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, the vessel itself is expanding, so the internal volume increases slightly as temperature rises. So the water's expansion is partly offset by the vessel's expansion.

But wait, the vessel's volume is fixed because it's sealed. Wait, no, the vessel's volume isn't fixed. Wait, the vessel is sealed, meaning that the mass of the water is fixed, but the vessel itself can expand or contract. So when the temperature increases, the vessel's volume increases by ΔV_vessel = β_vessel * V_vessel * ΔT. Similarly, the water's volume would want to increase by ΔV_water = β_water * V_water * ΔT. But since the vessel is sealed, the total volume available (V_vessel + ΔV_vessel) is fixed, but the water's volume can't exceed that.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire system. The vessel has an initial volume V0. When the temperature increases, the vessel's volume becomes V0*(1 + β_vessel * ΔT). Similarly, the water's volume would want to become V_water_initial * (1 + β_water * ΔT). But since the vessel's volume increases, the actual volume available for water is the new vessel volume. So the constraint is that the water's volume after expansion must fit into the vessel's expanded volume. If the water's expansion is greater than that of the vessel, then the pressure increases.

So, assuming that the vessel and water were initially in equilibrium at V0 and T1, then upon heating to T2, the vessel's volume increases by ΔV_vessel = V0 * β_vessel * ΔT. The water's volume would try to increase by ΔV_water = V0 * β_water * ΔT (assuming V_water_initial ≈ V_vessel_initial? Or wait, the vessel is completely filled with water, so V_water_initial = V_vessel_initial = V0. So yes, both have the same initial volume.

So the change for water is V0*(β_water * ΔT) and for vessel it's V0*(β_vessel * ΔT). The difference is V0*(β_water - β_vessel)*ΔT. If this is positive, the water's expansion is more than the vessel's, so it's constrained, leading to an increase in pressure.

So the excess volume that the water would have if unconstrained is ΔV_excess = V0*(β_water - β_vessel)*ΔT. But this excess can't expand, so it leads to a pressure increase, which compresses the water to fit into the available volume.

Wait, but how does that relate to the compressibility? Because water can be compressed, although not easily. The compressibility (κ) relates the change in volume to the change in pressure.

The formula I think is: ΔV = -V0 * κ * ΔP. Because κ is defined as the isothermal compressibility, κ = - (1/V) (dV/dP)_T. So for a pressure increase ΔP, the volume decreases by V0 κ ΔP.

But in this case, the water's volume would want to increase by ΔV_excess, but the vessel only allows for ΔV_vessel. So the actual change in volume of the water is ΔV_water_actual = ΔV_vessel. So the difference between the desired expansion and actual is the compression.

Wait, maybe it's better to set up the equation.

The volume of water at T2 without any pressure change would be V_water = V0 (1 + β_water ΔT). The vessel's volume at T2 is V_vessel = V0 (1 + β_vessel ΔT). The actual volume available for the water is V_vessel. So the water must be compressed to fit into V_vessel. So the change in volume of water is V_water_actual = V_vessel = V0 (1 + β_vessel ΔT). But the water would naturally expand to V0 (1 + β_water ΔT). So the difference is ΔV = V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT.

But this ΔV must be accommodated by the compressibility. So the change in volume due to pressure is ΔV = -V0 κ ΔP.

Wait, because the water is compressed, the volume decreases. So:

ΔV = V_water_initial - V_water_final = V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT = V0 κ (ΔP).

Wait, no, because the water's volume is forced to be V_vessel, which is less than it's natural expansion. So the required compression is (V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT). So this is the volume that the water is forced to lose, which is due to the pressure increase.

So ΔV = V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT = V0 κ ΔP.

Wait, but the formula for compressibility is:

ΔV = -V0 κ ΔP.

So, the change in volume is negative when pressure increases. So in this case, the water is compressed, so ΔV is negative.

So, the excess volume that the water would have is ΔV_excess = V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT. But because the vessel can't expand enough, this excess is the volume that must be 'lost' due to compression.

So, ΔV_excess = -ΔV_compression.

Which gives:

V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT = V0 κ ΔP.

Wait, no. Because the excess is the amount the water would expand beyond the vessel. So the water's volume without pressure would be V0(1 + β_water ΔT). The vessel's volume is V0(1 + β_vessel ΔT). The difference is V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT. This is the amount the water has to be compressed.

So the change in volume of the water is -ΔV = V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT.

But from the compressibility equation, ΔV = -V0 κ (ΔP).

So,

-ΔV = V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT → ΔV = -V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT.

But from compressibility:

ΔV = -V0 κ ΔP.

So,

- V0 κ ΔP = -V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT.

Simplify:

V0 κ ΔP = V0 (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT.

Cancel V0:

κ ΔP = (β_water - β_vessel) ΔT.

So,

ΔP = [ (β_water - β_vessel) / κ ] * ΔT.

Plugging in the numbers:

First, calculate ΔT. The initial temperature is 13.56°C, final is 82.0°C. So ΔT = 82.0 - 13.56 = 68.44 K (since it's a change, Celsius and Kelvin have the same ΔT).

β_water = 2.04e-4 K⁻¹.

β_vessel = 1.42e-4 K⁻¹.

So (β_water - β_vessel) = 2.04e-4 -1.42e-4 = 0.62e-4 K⁻¹ = 6.2e-5 K⁻¹.

κ = 4.59e-5 bar⁻¹.

So,

ΔP = (6.2e-5 K⁻¹) / (4.59e-5 bar⁻¹) ) * 68.44 K.

Let me compute that.

First, 6.2e-5 /4.59e-5 ≈ 6.2 /4.59 ≈ let's see, 6/4.5 is 1.333, and 0.2/4.5 is 0.044, so approximately 1.377.

Wait, more accurately:

6.2 ÷ 4.59 → 4.59 * 1.35 is 6.1965 (since 4.59 *1=4.59, 4.59*0.35=1.6065 → total 6.1965). So 1.35 is about the right factor.

So 6.2e-5 /4.59e-5 = approx 1.35.

Then, 1.35 * 68.44 K.

Compute 1.35 *68.44 → 1.3 *68.44 = 88.972, 0.05 *68.44=3.422 → total 92.394.

So ΔP ≈ 92.4 bar.

But wait, the initial pressure is 1.00 bar, so the final pressure is 1.00 + 92.4 ≈ 93.4 bar.

Looking at the options, option D is 93.4 bar.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations more accurately.

Compute (β_water - β_vessel):

2.04e-4 -1.42e-4 = (2.04 -1.42)e-4 = 0.62e-4 = 6.2e-5.

Then, (6.2e-5) / (4.59e-5) = 6.2 /4.59.

Compute 6.2 /4.59:

4.59 * 1 =4.59 → 6.2-4.59=1.61 left.

Bring down a zero: 16.1 left.

4.59 * 0.35 = approx 1.6065, as before.

So 0.35 → 1.35 total.

So 6.2/4.59 = 1.35 approximately.

Then 1.35 * 68.44.

Compute 1 *68.44 =68.44.

0.35 *68.44 = let's compute 68.44 * 0.3 =20.532; 68.44 *0.05=3.422. So 20.532 +3.422=23.954.

So total is 68.44 +23.954 =92.394 bar.

So ΔP is approximately 92.394 bar.

So the final pressure is P2 = P1 + ΔP = 1.00 +92.394 ≈93.394 bar.

Looking at the options, option D is 93.4 bar, which matches.

Wait, but let me make sure about the formula. The approach I took was that the excess expansion of water over vessel leads to a compression, so ΔP is positive and adds to the initial pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should account for the fact that the vessel's expansion reduces the required pressure. But in this case, the vessel is expanding, so the water's expansion is partially offset. So the excess is (β_water - β_vessel), which is positive, so the pressure increases.

Yes, that makes sense. So the calculation seems correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the pressure increase in a sealed vessel filled with water when the temperature rises. The vessel and water both expand with temperature, but since the vessel is sealed, the total volume is constrained. The pressure increases due to the differential expansion between the water and the vessel, which can be calculated using the given coefficients of volumetric expansion and the isothermal compressibility of water.

### Key Equations and Variables:
1. **Differential Volume Expansion**:
   \[
   \Delta V_{\text{excess}} = V_0 \cdot (\beta_{\text{water}} - \beta_{\text{vessel}}) \cdot \Delta T
   \]
   where \( \Delta V_{\text{excess}} \) is the excess volume expansion of water relative to the vessel.

2. **Compressibility Relation**:
   \[
   \Delta V = -V_0 \cdot \kappa_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta P
   \]
   where \( \Delta P \) is the pressure change.

3. **Relating Excess Volume to Pressure Change**:
   \[
   V_0 \cdot (\beta_{\text{water}} - \beta_{\text{vessel}}) \cdot \Delta T = V_0 \cdot \kappa_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta P
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \Delta P = \frac{(\beta_{\text{water}} - \beta_{\text{vessel}})}{\kappa_{\text{water}}} \cdot \Delta T
   \]

### Given Data:
- \( \beta_{\text{water}} = 2.04 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1} \)
- \( \beta_{\text{vessel}} = 1.42 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1} \)
- \( \kappa_{\text{water}} = 4.59 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{bar}^{-1} \)
- \( \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 82.0 - 13.56 = 68.44 \, \mathrm{K} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( \beta_{\text{water}} - \beta_{\text{vessel}} \):
   \[
   \beta_{\text{water}} - \beta_{\text{vessel}} = 2.04 \times 10^{-4} - 1.42 \times 10^{-4} = 0.62 \times 10^{-4} = 6.2 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}
   \]

2. Substitute into the pressure equation:
   \[
   \Delta P = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-5})}{(4.59 \times 10^{-5})} \cdot 68.44
   \]

3. Simplify the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{6.2 \times 10^{-5}}{4.59 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 1.35
   \]

4. Multiply by \( \Delta T \):
   \[
   \Delta P = 1.35 \cdot 68.44 \approx 92.4 \, \mathrm{bar}
   \]

5. Add the initial pressure:
   \[
   P_2 = P_1 + \Delta P = 1.00 + 92.4 = 93.4 \, \mathrm{bar}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final pressure in the vessel is **93.4 bar**, which corresponds to option **D**.
