Question:

One computer in a lab is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every five minutes. Another computer is programmed to back up data at the turn of the minute every two minutes. Find the number of times in twenty-four hours that the two computers back up data at the same time. (Assume that the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period.)

Options:

A: 144
B: 240
C: 36
D: 180
E: 72
F: 12
G: 6
H: 60
I: 120
J: 48

Okay, so I've got this problem here about two computers backing up data. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The first computer backs up every five minutes, right? And it does this at the turn of the minute. So, like, exactly at 0, 5, 10, 15 minutes past the hour, and so on. The second computer does the same but every two minutes. So it's at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. 

The question is asking how many times in 24 hours they both back up at the same time. And they don't back up at the very start, so the first possible overlap isn't at time zero.

Hmm, I think this is about finding the least common multiple (LCM) of their backup intervals. Because the LCM would give me the time interval after which both coincide. 

So the first computer's interval is 5 minutes, and the second's is 2 minutes. Let's find the LCM of 5 and 2. 

Wait, 5 and 2 are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor is 1. So the LCM should be 5 * 2 = 10 minutes. So every 10 minutes, both computers back up at the same time. 

Now, in 24 hours, how many 10-minute intervals are there? Well, a day has 24 hours, each with 60 minutes. So 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes total.

Dividing that by 10 gives 144. But wait, the problem says they don't back up at the start. So the first overlap is at 10 minutes, then 20, 30, etc. So how many times does this happen?

If there are 1440 / 10 = 144 intervals, but since the first overlap is at 10 minutes, maybe we subtract one? Or wait, maybe not. Because the initial backup times are at 5,10,15... and 2,4,6,8,10... So the first overlap is at 10 minutes, which is the first occurrence in the 24-hour period.

So in 1440 minutes, the number of overlaps would be 144 times. But wait, let me double-check. Each 10-minute mark counts as a common backup time. So from minute 10 to minute 1440 (which is 24*60=1440), how many multiples of 10 are there?

The number is 1440 / 10 = 144. So there are 144 such instances. But wait, the initial 0 minute is excluded, so the first is at 10, then 20, ..., up to 1440. But if 1440 is included, that's exactly the end of the period. So the count remains 144.

Wait, but when you have 1440 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is 144. Because 10*144 = 1440. So the number of times they coincide is 144.

But looking at the options, option A is 144. So that seems right. But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes when counting intervals, you have to be careful about whether the endpoint is included.

Wait, the problem says "in twenty-four hours", and the computers don't back up at the start. So the first time they would coincide is at 10 minutes. The next at 20, and so on, up to 1440 minutes (which is the end of the 24 hours). So that's 1440 / 10 = 144 times.

But let me think of a smaller example to check. Suppose we have a 10-minute window. Computer A does backups at 5 and 10 minutes. Computer B does every 2 minutes: 2,4,6,8,10. So they coincide at 10 minutes, which is the end. So in 10 minutes, they meet once.

Wait, but 10 / 10 = 1, which matches. So in 10 minutes, it's once. So in 20 minutes, it's 2 times (10 and 20). So yeah, the formula holds.

So in 1440 minutes, it's 144 times. So the answer is A:144.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The two computers' backup times are:

Computer 1: 5,10,15,20,...,1440 (if 1440 is a multiple of 5)
Computer 2: 2,4,6,8,10,...,1440 (if 1440 is a multiple of 2)

So the common times are at 10, 20, ..., up to 1440 if it's a multiple of 10.

Wait, 1440 divided by 10 is 144. So yes, 144 times.

So the correct answer is A:144.

To determine how many times the two computers back up data at the same time in a 24-hour period, we analyze their backup intervals. The first computer backs up every 5 minutes, and the second backs up every 2 minutes. The key is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals, which determines how often they coincide.

The LCM of 5 and 2 is 10 minutes. This means the computers will back up data simultaneously every 10 minutes. 

In a 24-hour period, there are \( 24 \times 60 = 1440 \) minutes. Dividing this by the 10-minute interval gives \( \frac{1440}{10} = 144 \). Since the first overlap occurs at 10 minutes (not at the start of the period), all 144 instances are valid within the 24-hour timeframe.

Thus, the two computers back up data at the same time 144 times in 24 hours.
