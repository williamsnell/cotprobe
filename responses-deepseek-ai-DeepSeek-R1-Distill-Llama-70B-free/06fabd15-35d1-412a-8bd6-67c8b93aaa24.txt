Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following excerpt.
Never were talents of the highest genius of the most exalted kind, more profusely bestowed upon a human being. The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Napoleon and the perspective of the author John S. C. Abbott. The question is asking which of Napoleon's actions the author seems to be ignoring the hypocrisy of when praising Napoleon's high-mindedness and worthiness.

Hmm, let me start by breaking down what the excerpt says. The author is really praising Napoleon's genius, saying he had talents of the highest kind, that his mind was gigantic, familiar with all branches of human knowledge. The author talks about Napoleon's conversations at St. Helena, which are full of interest and profound thoughts, and how they invigorate the mind. So the author is portraying Napoleon in a very positive light, focusing on his intellectual side and his discussions on morals, politics, and religion.

Now, the question is about which action's hypocrisy the author is ignoring. So I need to think about Napoleon's actions that might have a hypocritical aspect, especially in the context of the author's praise.

Looking at the options:

A: Manipulation of the press for political gain. That's a bit hypocritical if Napoleon was promoting freedom of press but actually controlled it. But the author is talking about his intellectual side, so maybe not directly related.

B: Conquest of Europe and Continental System. Napoleon's conquests were definitely controversial, but the author is more focused on his thoughts and conversations, not his military actions. So maybe the author is ignoring the hypocrisy of someone who preached liberty but conquered others.

C: Imposition of French culture. That's part of his conquests, similar to B. Again, the author might be overlooking the hypocrisy of imposing culture while maybe talking about freedom or self-determination.

D: Invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt. Oh, that's interesting. Napoleon sent troops to Haiti to suppress the slave revolt led by Toussaint Louverture. But earlier, the French Revolution had abolished slavery, so this action was contradictory. If the author is praising Napoleon's morals and discussions on freedom, but ignoring this hypocritical action, that could be it.

E: Establishment of the Bank of France. That's more of an economic move, not really hypocritical in the context of high-mindedness.

F: Self-appointment as Emperor. That's about power, but again, the author is focusing on his intellectual side, so maybe not the main point here.

G: Promoting based on merit. That's actually a positive action, promoting meritocracy, so it doesn't show hypocrisy.

H: Creation of the Napoleonic Code. That's a legal reform, which is often praised for its progressive aspects, so probably not the hypocritical one.

So, putting it together, the author is talking about Napoleon's high-mindedness and discussions on morals. If the author is ignoring the hypocrisy, it would be an action that contradicts those high morals. The invasion of Haiti (option D) was about stopping a slave revolt, which contradicts the ideals of liberty and equality that Napoleon's regime might have claimed. So the author might be ignoring this hypocritical action when praising Napoleon's moral discussions.

Wait, but the French Revolution did abolish slavery, but Napoleon reinstated it in some colonies. So sending troops to Haiti to quell the revolt would be hypocritical because he was going against the ideals of liberty that the Revolution stood for, which he supposedly supported.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is D.

The author's portrayal of Napoleon focuses on his intellectual genius, profound thoughts, and discussions on morals, politics, and religion, presenting him in a highly positive light. However, the question asks which of Napoleon's actions the author might be ignoring in terms of hypocrisy. 

Analyzing the options, the invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt (Option D) stands out as a deeply hypocritical act. Napoleon, who rose to power in the aftermath of the French Revolution, which championed liberty and equality, sent troops to suppress the Haitian slave revolt led by Toussaint Louverture. This action directly contradicts the ideals of freedom and equality that Napoleon's regime ostensibly supported, especially since the French Revolution had abolished slavery. The author, while praising Napoleon's moral and intellectual stature, seems to overlook this glaring contradiction.

Answer: D
