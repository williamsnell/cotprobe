Okay, so Mrs. Hilton wants to save $10,000 in 10 years, and she's getting a 5% annual interest rate compounded quarterly. She needs to figure out how much she should deposit each quarter. Hmm, I remember this has to do with compound interest formulas, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps.

Wait, I think there are two main formulas here. One is for compound interest where you have a lump sum, but since she's making regular deposits, it's more like an annuity problem. Oh right, the future value of a series of equal payments. So the formula should be something like FV = PMT * [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1]/(r/n), where FV is the future value, PMT is the payment per period, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times compounded per year, and t is the time in years.

Let me jot down the variables. She wants FV to be $10,000. The interest rate r is 5%, so that's 0.05. It's compounded quarterly, so n is 4. The time t is 10 years. So plugging these into the formula, FV = PMT * [(1 + 0.05/4)^(4*10) - 1]/(0.05/4).

Wait, wait, let me make sure I get the formula right. The formula is FV = PMT * [((1 + (r/n))^(n*t) - 1)/(r/n)]. So yes, that's correct.

Calculating step by step. First, r/n is 0.05/4, which is 0.0125. Then n*t is 4*10 = 40 periods. So (1 + 0.0125)^40. Hmm, I need to compute that. I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can approximate it or use logarithms. Alternatively, maybe I should just use the formula as is.

Wait, maybe I should rearrange the formula to solve for PMT since that's what's needed. So PMT = FV / [((1 + r/n)^(n*t) - 1)/(r/n)].

So PMT = 10000 / [((1 + 0.05/4)^40 - 1)/(0.05/4)].

Let me compute the denominator first. Let's compute (1 + 0.05/4)^40. So 0.05/4 is 0.0125, so 1.0125^40. I think 1.0125^40 is approximately... well, 1.0125^40. Let me think about how to calculate that without a calculator. Maybe using the rule of 72 or logarithms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest. Oh wait, but without a calculator, it's tricky. Maybe I can remember that (1 + 0.0125)^40 is roughly e^(40 * 0.0125) since for small r, ln(1+r) ≈ r. So e^(0.5) is about 1.6487, but wait, 40 *0.0125 is 0.5, so (1.0125)^40 ≈ e^0.5 ≈ 1.6487. But wait, that's an approximation. Alternatively, using a better method.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me see:

1.0125^40. Let's compute it step by step. Maybe compute it in parts. Alternatively, I can use logarithms. Let me compute ln(1.0125) first. ln(1.0125) is approximately 0.01238. So 40 * 0.01238 is approximately 0.4952. Then exponentiating e^0.4952 is approximately 1.640. So (1.0125)^40 ≈ 1.640.

So then, (1.640 - 1) = 0.640. Now, the denominator in the formula's big fraction is 0.05/4 which is 0.0125. So the denominator becomes 0.640 / 0.0125. Let me compute that: 0.640 / 0.0125. 0.0125 is 1/80, so 0.64 *80 = 51.2.

So the denominator is 51.2. Therefore, PMT = 10000 /51.2 ≈ 195.3125. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly $195.31. Let me check the options again. The options are A:230.40, B:215.60, C:187.50, D:172.45, E:205.10, F:158.30, G:194.21, H:200.50, I:180.75, J:210.30.

Hmm, 195 is closest to option G:194.21 or E:205.10, or H:200.50. But perhaps my approximation was rough. Maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use a better approximation for (1.0125)^40. Let me compute it using the binomial expansion or another method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for compound interest more accurately. Let me think, maybe I can use a step-by-step approach. For example, after each year, the amount would be multiplied by (1 + 0.0125)^4. But that's still 40 periods. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value of an annuity formula rearranged, but I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula again: FV of annuity = PMT * [ ( (1 + i)^n - 1 ) / i ], where i is the periodic interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

Wait, in this case, i is 0.05/4 = 0.0125, and n is 40. So FV = PMT * [ (1.0125^40 - 1 ) / 0.0125 ].

So I need to compute (1.0125)^40 more accurately. Let me try to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, since (1.0125)^40 = (1.0125)^4^10. So first compute (1.0125)^4. Let's compute that:

1.0125^1 = 1.0125

1.0125^2 = 1.0125 * 1.0125. Let's calculate that: 1.0125 * 1.0125.

1 *1 =1, 1*.0125=0.0125, 0.0125*1=0.0125, 0.0125*0.0125=0.00015625. So adding up:

1 + 0.0125 + 0.0125 + 0.00015625 = 1.02515625.

So 1.0125^2 = 1.02515625.

Now, 1.02515625^2 to get to the 4th power. Let me compute that.

1.02515625 * 1.02515625. Let me break it down:

1 * 1.02515625 = 1.02515625

0.02515625 *1.02515625 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as (a + b)^2 where a=1, b=0.02515625.

So (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

a² =1

2ab = 2 * 1 * 0.02515625 = 0.0503125

b² = (0.02515625)^2. Let's approximate that as (approx 0.025)^2 = 0.000625, but more accurately:

0.02515625 * 0.02515625:

Multiply 2515625 * 2515625, but perhaps it's easier to compute 0.025 *0.025 = 0.000625.

But exact value: 0.02515625^2 = ?

Let me compute 0.02515625 * 0.02515625.

First, 0.02 * 0.02 = 0.0004.

0.02 * 0.00515625 = 0.000103125.

0.00515625 * 0.02 = same as above, 0.000103125.

0.00515625 *0.00515625 = approx (5.15625e-3)^2 = approx 26.6e-6, or 0.0000266.

Adding all together: 0.0004 + 0.000103125 + 0.000103125 + 0.0000266 ≈ 0.00063285.

So, (1.02515625)^2 ≈ 1.02515625^2 ≈1 + 0.0503125 + 0.00063285 ≈ 1.05094535.

So 1.0125^4 is approximately 1.05094535.

Now, we need to raise this to the 10th power, because we have (1.0125^4)^10 = 1.0125^40.

So (1.05094535)^10.

Hmm, let's compute that. Maybe using logarithms.

Take natural log: ln(1.05094535) ≈ 0.04951 (since ln(1.05)≈0.04879, so 0.050945 is a bit higher, maybe 0.0495).

So ln(1.05094535) ≈ 0.0495.

Multiply by 10: 0.495.

Exponentiate: e^0.495 ≈ 1.640 (since e^0.5≈1.6487, so 0.495 is a bit less, like 1.640).

So 1.05094535^10 ≈1.640. So (1.0125)^40≈1.640.

Wait, that's the same as my initial approximation. So back to the formula: FV = PMT * (1.640 -1)/0.0125 = PMT * (0.640 / 0.0125) = PMT * 51.2.

So FV = 10000 = PMT *51.2 => PMT = 10000 /51.2 ≈ 195.3125.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option G:194.21, which is about $194.21. But wait, perhaps my approximation for (1.0125)^40 was a bit off. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach. Let me compute (1.0125)^40 more accurately.

I can use the formula for compound interest step by step. Let me compute (1.0125)^40.

But this would take a while. Let me try:

We have (1.0125)^40. Let me compute it in parts. Let's compute (1.0125)^4 first, which we already did as approximately 1.050945.

Then, (1.050945)^10. Let me compute this step by step.

Compute (1.050945)^2 = ?

1.050945 * 1.050945.

Let me compute 1 *1.050945 = 1.050945.

0.050945 *1.050945 ≈ 0.053494.

So adding 1.050945 + 0.053494 ≈ 1.104439. So (1.050945)^2 ≈1.104439.

Now, (1.104439)^5.

Wait, perhaps compute (1.104439)^3 first.

(1.104439)^2 = approximately 1.104439 *1.104439.

1*1.104439 =1.104439.

0.104439 *1.104439 ≈ approx 0.1154.

So adding 1.104439 + 0.1154 ≈1.2198. So (1.104439)^2 ≈1.2198.

Now, (1.2198) *1.104439 (to get to the 3rd power).

1.2198 *1=1.2198.

1.2198 *0.104439≈approx 0.1274.

So total ≈1.2198 +0.1274≈1.3472. So (1.104439)^3≈1.3472.

Now, (1.3472)^5. Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should accept that without a calculator, it's hard. Perhaps I should proceed with the initial approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a better method for (1.0125)^40. Let me compute it using logarithms more accurately.

Compute ln(1.0125)= 0.01238.

Multiply by 40: 0.01238 *40=0.4952.

e^0.4952 = ? Let me compute e^0.4952.

We know that e^0.4=1.49182, e^0.5=1.64872.

So 0.4952 is 0.5 -0.0048.

So e^(0.5 -0.0048) = e^0.5 * e^(-0.0048).

e^(-0.0048)≈1 -0.0048 + (0.0048^2)/2 - ... ≈ approximately 0.9952.

So e^0.4952 ≈1.64872 *0.9952≈1.640.

So (1.0125)^40≈1.640 as before.

So then, the denominator in the formula becomes (1.640 -1)/0.0125 = 0.64 /0.0125=51.2.

So PMT=10000/51.2≈195.3125. The closest option is G:194.21, but that's about $1 off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.0125)^40 more accurately. Maybe using a better approximation. Alternatively, use the formula for compound interest with more precise steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the future value formula with more accurate numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can compute 1.0125^40 using logarithms.

Another approach: Since 1.0125 = 1 + 0.0125.

Using the binomial expansion for (1 + x)^n, where x=0.0125, n=40.

So ln(1.0125) = 0.01238 as before.

But maybe a better approach is to use the formula for (1 + r)^n = e^{n*ln(1 + r)}.

So ln(1.0125) = 0.012383, so 40 * 0.012383 = 0.4953.

e^0.4953 ≈1.640.

Hmm, same result. So PMT=195.31.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula is FV = PMT * [ (1 + r/n)^(nt) -1 ] / (r/n).

So FV is 10000, r is 0.05, n=4, t=10.

So plugging in:

10000 = PMT * [ (1 + 0.05/4)^(40) -1 ] / (0.05/4).

So denominator is 0.0125, numerator is (1.0125^40 -1).

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.0125^40 -1) more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can look up the factor for 5% over 40 periods. Wait, perhaps I can compute it as follows:

(1.0125)^40 = e^(40 * ln(1.0125)).

Compute ln(1.0125) more accurately.

Using Taylor series: ln(1+x) = x - x²/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 +...

x=0.0125

ln(1.0125) = 0.0125 - (0.0125)^2/2 + (0.0125)^3/3 - (0.0125)^4/4 +...

Compute term by term:

First term: 0.0125 =0.0125

Second term: (0.00015625)/2=0.000078125

Third term: (0.000001953125)/3≈0.00000065104

Fourth term: (0.0000000244140625)/4≈6.1035e-9

So ln(1.0125) ≈0.0125 -0.000078125 +0.00000065104 -0.0000000061 ≈0.01242252.

So 40 * ln(1.0125)=40 * 0.01242252≈0.4969.

e^0.4969 = ?

We know e^0.49 = approx 1.633, e^0.5=1.6487.

Compute e^0.4969:

0.4969 is 0.5 -0.0031.

So e^0.4969 = e^(0.5 -0.0031) = e^0.5 * e^(-0.0031).

e^0.5=1.64872.

e^-0.0031≈1 -0.0031 + (0.0031^2)/2 - ... ≈approx 0.9969.

So 1.64872 *0.9969 ≈1.640.

So (1.0125)^40≈1.640.

So the same as before.

Thus, PMT=10000/( (1.640-1)/0.0125 )=10000/(0.64/0.0125)=10000/(51.2)=approx 195.3125.

Looking at the options again, the closest is G:194.21. But why is there a discrepancy? Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity (where payments are made at the end of each period) is FV = PMT * [((1 + i)^n -1)/i], where i is the periodic interest rate, n is the number of periods.

Yes, that's correct. So [ (1.0125^40 -1 ) / 0.0125 ].
