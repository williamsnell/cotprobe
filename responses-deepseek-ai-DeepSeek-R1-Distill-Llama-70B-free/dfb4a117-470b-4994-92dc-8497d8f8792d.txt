Question:

Research on explicit (intentional) and implicit (automatic) memory indicates that

Options:

A: both forms of memory fluctuate in capacity throughout the adult life span
B: neither forms of memory are affected by age, only by a disease process like Alzheimer’s
C: both forms of memory show a fairly consistent, gradual decline over the adult life span
D: both forms of memory remain stable, except when affected by a disease process like Alzheimer’s
E: explicit memory capacity remains stable, while implicit memory capacity declines with age
F: implicit memory capacity declines with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable
G: both forms of memory increase their capacity with age
H: implicit memory capacity increases with age, but explicit memory capacity remains stable
I: explicit memory capacity increases with age, while implicit memory capacity declines
J: explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable

Okay, so I've got this question about explicit and implicit memory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I remember that explicit memory is the intentional kind, like when you try to recall facts or past events. Implicit memory is more automatic, like skills or conditioned responses that you don't have to think about.

The question is asking about how these two types of memory change during adulthood. I think I've read somewhere that explicit memory tends to decline with age, while implicit memory stays more stable. Wait, let me think. Oh right, older adults might have trouble remembering things they studied or events, which are explicit. But their implicit memory, like riding a bike or playing a musical instrument, doesn't decline as much. So implicit remains stable, while explicit declines.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Option J says explicit declines and implicit remains stable. That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure. Option A says both fluctuate, which doesn't fit. B says neither is affected by age, only disease. No, that's not right because explicit does decline with normal aging. C says both decline, which I don't think is correct. D says both are stable except in disease, which again is wrong because explicit declines normally. E and F have it backward, E says explicit is stable and implicit declines, which is the opposite. F says the same. G and H suggest increases, which isn't the case. I says explicit increases, which is wrong. So J is the correct choice.

The correct answer is that explicit memory declines with age, while implicit memory remains stable.
