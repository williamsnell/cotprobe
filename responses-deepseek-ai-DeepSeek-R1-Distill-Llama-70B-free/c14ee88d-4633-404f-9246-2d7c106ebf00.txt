Okay, so I have this question about modern economies and their essential features. The question is asking for three features that aren't peculiar to capitalism. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that capitalism is characterized by private property, freedom of choice, and the pricing mechanism. But modern economies are more complex and have elements beyond just capitalism. So the question is about features that are present in modern economies but aren't exclusive to capitalism.

Looking at the options, I need to find one that lists three such features. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Advanced technology, extensive specialization, use of money. Well, advanced tech and specialization are definitely part of modern economies. Use of money is pretty standard too. But wait, does capitalism have these? I think so. Capitalist economies do use money and have advanced tech. So maybe these aren't unique to non-capitalist features. Not sure if this is the right choice.

Option B: Central planning, equal income distribution, state ownership. Central planning and state ownership sound more like socialist or communist features, but the question is about features not unique to capitalism. But are these essential in modern economies? Most modern economies are mixed, so maybe some elements like state ownership exist, but I'm not sure if all three are essential for a modern economy.

Option C: Government-regulated monopolies, planned obsolescence, compulsory consumption. This seems more like specific policies rather than essential features. I'm not sure these are necessarily present across all modern economies. Plus, some of these terms might be more associated with certain critiques of capitalism rather than being general features.

Option D: Market competition, free trade, consumerism. These are actually features more associated with capitalism. So this can't be the answer because the question is looking for features not peculiar to capitalism.

Option E: Communistic ideology, socialistic policies, barter system. These don't fit modern economies. Most modern economies aren't purely communist, and the barter system isn't widely used. So probably not the right choice.

Option F: Nationalized industries, welfare state, progressive taxation. Nationalized industries and welfare states are part of mixed economies, which many modern economies have. Progressive taxation is common too. These aren't unique to capitalism, so this could be a possible answer.

Option G: Universal basic income, cooperative business models, digital currency adoption. These are more recent or specific policies. Not all modern economies have these, so they might not be essential features yet.

Option H: Same as the question's initial features, which are peculiar to capitalism. So definitely not the answer.

Option I: Collective farming, absence of currency, shared ownership. This sounds more like a primitive or specific communal system, not typical of modern economies.

Option J: Public goods provision, mixed economic policies, environmental sustainability. Public goods are provided by governments in many economies, including capitalist ones. Mixed policies imply a combination of public and private sectors, which is true for many modern economies. Environmental sustainability is a growing concern and feature in policy-making. So these seem like essential features that aren't exclusive to capitalism.

Wait, let me compare F and J. Option F talks about nationalized industries, welfare, and progressive taxes. Option J is about public goods, mixed policies, and sustainability.

The question asks for three essential features. Public goods are a big part of modern economies, as governments provide things like roads and education. Mixed policies mean both public and private sectors play roles, which is true for most economies today. Environmental sustainability is increasingly integrated into economic policies, so that's a key feature now.

So I think option J is the correct answer because it lists features that are essential and present in modern economies but aren't exclusive to capitalism. They're more about the structure and policies of modern mixed economies.

The question asks for three essential features of modern economies that are not peculiar to capitalism. After analyzing the options:

- **Option J** stands out as the correct answer because it lists **public goods provision, mixed economic policies, and environmental sustainability**. These are essential features of modern economies. Public goods are provided by governments in many economies, mixed policies reflect the combination of public and private sectors common today, and environmental sustainability is a key focus in contemporary economic policies. These features are not exclusive to capitalism and are integral to the structure and functioning of modern economies.

Answer: J
