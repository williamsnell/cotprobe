Okay, so I've got this question about dipole antennas and their operating frequency. Hmm, I remember that the position of an antenna above the ground can affect its operating characteristics. The question says the dipole is placed a quarter wavelength above the earth's surface. Wait, what's a quarter wavelength mean in this context?

Oh right, the height of the antenna in terms of wavelength is important because it affects the radiation pattern and impedance. A quarter wavelength is like a specific height that might relate to the frequency somehow.

Wait, the problem states the antenna is placed 2 meters above the ground, and that's a quarter of a wavelength. So the height (h) is 2 meters, which is equal to λ/4. So I can write that as h = λ/4.

But I need to find the operating frequency. So I think I need to relate wavelength to frequency. Oh yeah, the formula c = λf, where c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Wait, but the wavelength here is in the denominator. Let me rearrange the first equation. If h = λ/4, then λ = 4h. Since h is 2 meters, λ would be 4 * 2 = 8 meters.

Now, using c = λf, I can solve for f. So f = c / λ. Plugging in the numbers: c is 3e8 m/s, λ is 8 meters. So f = 3e8 / 8.

Let me do that calculation. 3e8 is 300,000,000. Divided by 8. Let's see, 300 million divided by 8 is... 37.5 million. Oh wait, that's 37.5 MHz.

Looking at the options, option H is 37.5 MHz. So the answer should be H.

To determine the operating frequency of the dipole antenna, we start with the given information:

1. The antenna is placed 2 meters above the earth's surface, and this height corresponds to one-quarter of a wavelength (λ/4).
2. Using the relationship \( h = \frac{\lambda}{4} \), where \( h = 2 \, \text{m} \), we calculate the wavelength:
   \[
   \lambda = 4h = 4 \times 2 = 8 \, \text{m}.
   \]
3. The speed of light \( c \) is approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Using the formula \( c = \lambda f \), we solve for the frequency \( f \):
   \[
   f = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{8} = 37.5 \, \text{MHz}.
   \]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **H: 37.5 MHz**.
