Question:

What components of the plasma can affect the blood pressure? Explain how they affect it. What other solutes are present in the plasma?

Options:

A: The concentration of inorganic salts has no effect on blood pressure.
B: The presence of white blood cells is the main determinant of blood pressure.
C: Only red blood cells affect the blood pressure.
D: Only the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide in plasma affects blood pressure.
E: Plasma proteins have no influence on blood pressure; plasma is primarily composed of vitamins and minerals.
F: The viscosity of plasma, unrelated to its solute content, is the sole factor influencing blood pressure.
G: Plasma contains only water and no solutes.
H: The concentrations of inorganic salts and plasma proteins can affect the blood pressure. Plasma also contains organic nutrients, nitrogenous waste products, hormones and dissolved gases.
I: Blood pressure is unaffected by plasma composition; plasma contains only immune system factors.
J: The concentration of glucose in plasma is the only factor affecting blood pressure.

Okay, so I have this question about blood pressure and plasma components. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking what components in the plasma affect blood pressure and how. Also, it wants to know what other solutes are present in the plasma.

Hmm, I remember that blood is made up of plasma and the formed elements like red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Plasma is mostly water, but it has various solutes. 

I think blood pressure is influenced by a few factors. One is the blood volume. If there's more fluid, the pressure might increase. But wait, blood volume is part of what determines blood pressure, but the question is about the components in the plasma affecting it. Oh right, the concentration of solutes in the plasma can affect osmoregulation, which in turn affects blood volume. Like, if the plasma has high concentrations of salts, the body might retain more water, increasing blood volume and thus blood pressure.

Another thing I remember is that plasma proteins, especially albumin, play a role in maintaining blood osmotic pressure. This is part of the oncotic pressure, which helps keep fluid in the blood vessels and not leaking out. If there's less protein, maybe the blood can't hold as much fluid, so blood volume drops, affecting blood pressure.

So plasma proteins and inorganic salts (like sodium, potassium, chloride) can influence blood pressure. How? Well, inorganic salts contribute to the osmotic pressure. If their concentration is high, the blood might hold more water, increasing volume and pressure. Plasma proteins contribute to the colloid osmotic pressure, which also helps retain fluid in the blood vessels.

As for other solutes in plasma, I think they include organic nutrients like glucose, amino acids, and fats. There are also nitrogenous wastes such as urea. Hormones are transported in the plasma too, like insulin and adrenaline. Dissolved gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide are present, but I don't think they directly affect blood pressure in the same way salts and proteins do. Oh wait, CO2 levels can influence breathing rate, which in turn affects blood pressure, but that's more indirect.

Looking at the options:

Option H says the concentrations of inorganic salts and plasma proteins can affect blood pressure. It also mentions other solutes like organic nutrients, nitrogenous waste, hormones, and gases. That sounds correct based on what I thought.

Other options: Option A says inorganic salts have no effect, which is wrong because they do affect osmotic pressure. B says white blood cells are main determinants, but I don't think so because WBCs are not in plasma, they are cells. C says only red blood cells affect, but again, RBCs are in blood, not plasma. D says only O2 and CO2, which isn't right. E says plasma proteins have no influence, which is wrong. F says viscosity is the only factor, but I think solute concentration affects viscosity as well. G is wrong because plasma has many solutes. I says blood pressure is unaffected, which is false. J says glucose is the only factor, which isn't correct.

So the correct answer should be H.

The components of plasma that can affect blood pressure are the concentrations of inorganic salts and plasma proteins. Inorganic salts contribute to osmotic pressure, which influences blood volume and, consequently, blood pressure. Plasma proteins, such as albumin, contribute to oncotic pressure, helping retain fluid within blood vessels, which also affects blood pressure. Other solutes in plasma include organic nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids), nitrogenous waste products (e.g., urea), hormones, and dissolved gases (e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide).

Analyzing the options, only option H correctly identifies these components and their effects on blood pressure, as well as the other solutes present in plasma.

H: The concentrations of inorganic salts and plasma proteins can affect the blood pressure. Plasma also contains organic nutrients, nitrogenous waste products, hormones, and dissolved gases.

Answer: H
