The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

On June 1, an appliance manufacturer telephoned a supplier to determine whether the supplier could provide 300 washing machine motors of a particular model by October 1. The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, "Deal." The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, "I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order." The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer had not received any orders for the machines with the specified motors at the time of the supplier's refusal.
B: No, because the manufacturer's representative verbally agreed to the deal over the phone.
C: No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.
D: Yes, because the supplier was no longer carrying the model of the motor at the time of the call.
E: Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.
F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.
G: No, because the manufacturer's representative sent the note on company letterhead.
H: No, because the supplier did not inform the manufacturer about not being able to supply the motors in time.
I: Yes, because the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing.
J: No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contracts and the statute of frauds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about whether the supplier's statute of frauds defense will succeed. So, first, I need to remember what the statute of frauds requires. From what I recall, the statute of frauds says that certain contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. These include contracts for goods over a certain value, typically $500, under the UCC. The writing must include the quantity and be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

So the scenario here is that a manufacturer called a supplier on June 1 to ask for 300 washing machine motors at $300 each, totaling $90,000. The supplier agreed, and the manufacturer's rep said, "Deal." The next day, the manufacturer sent an unsigned note on company letterhead saying they're happy and will call about another order. Then, the manufacturer sent catalogs advertising washing machines with those motors. On July 1, the supplier said they couldn't supply because they stopped carrying that model. The manufacturer sued, and the supplier is using the statute of frauds as a defense.

I think the key points are whether there's a written memorandum that satisfies the statute of frauds. The verbal agreement was made, but the statute requires a writing. The manufacturer sent a note, but it was unsigned. So did that note count?

Wait, the note was on company letterhead and mentioned that they're going to supply the motors, but it didn't have a signature. So the question is whether an unsigned note is sufficient. I remember that the writing needs to be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought, which here would be the supplier. But in this case, the manufacturer sent the note, not the supplier. So the note is from the manufacturer, not the supplier. So the supplier didn't sign anything.

Also, the note didn't mention the quantity, I think. The phone call was about 300 motors, but the note just says they're happy to supply without specifying the quantity. Wait, the question says the note stated, "I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors." So it refers to the motors but not the quantity. So maybe the quantity isn't in the note.

So under the UCC, the writing needs to have the quantity. If the note doesn't specify the quantity, then that's a problem. But wait, the initial phone call did specify 300 motors. The note doesn't mention that. So the writing (the note) doesn't include the quantity term, which is required by the statute of frauds for goods contracts.

Alternatively, there might be an exception, like the merchant's exception under UCC 2-201(2), where a written confirmation between merchants is sufficient if the other party doesn't object within 10 days. But in this case, the supplier didn't send a confirmation; the manufacturer sent a note. So that might not apply.

Another angle: the manufacturer sent out catalogs. Could that be considered part of the writing? I don't think so. Catalogs are usually considered invitations to offer, not part of a contract.

So putting it together: the contract was for 300 motors at $300 each, totaling $90,000. The statute of frauds applies because it's a goods contract over $500. The writing (the note) lacks the supplier's signature and doesn't specify the quantity. Therefore, the contract isn't enforceable under the statute of frauds.

Looking at the options, option E says, "Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract." That seems to fit because the note didn't mention the quantity. Alternatively, option F says the note failed to contain a signature, which is also true because it's unsigned. But I think the bigger issue is the quantity not being in the writing.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The original agreement was verbal, and the note just acknowledged the supply without specifics. So the note doesn't have the quantity, which is a required term. So the writing doesn't satisfy the statute of frauds because it's missing the quantity. So E would be the right answer.

Alternatively, the note was on company letterhead and unsigned. So if the writing doesn't have the supplier's signature, but it's from the manufacturer, does that matter? Because the statute requires the party against whom enforcement is sought (the supplier) to have signed. But the note is from the manufacturer, so the supplier didn't sign anything. Therefore, the writing isn't sufficient because it's not signed by the supplier.

So perhaps both E and F are correct points, but which one is the primary reason?

Wait, the note doesn't have the quantity, so even if it was signed, it's missing the quantity. So the main issue is the lack of the quantity term in the writing. So E would be the reason the statute of frauds applies.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term.

Option F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.

Which is more critical? The statute requires a writing that includes the quantity. So if the writing exists but lacks quantity, it's insufficient. Alternatively, if there's no writing signed by the supplier, that's also a problem.

Wait, but in this case, is there any writing at all? The manufacturer sent a note, but the supplier didn't sign it. So the only writing is from the manufacturer, not signed by the supplier. So the note is from the manufacturer to the supplier, but the supplier didn't sign anything. Therefore, there's no memorandum signed by the supplier.

So the lack of signature is the issue. So option F would be the reason.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The statute requires that the contract be in a writing that is signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Here, the manufacturer is suing the supplier, so the writing needs to be signed by the supplier.

But the only writing is the note from the manufacturer, which is unsigned. So there's no signed writing from the supplier. Therefore, the statute of frauds hasn't been satisfied because there's no signed writing by the supplier. So the defense would succeed because there's no signed writing.

Wait, but the note was from the manufacturer, not the supplier. So the supplier didn't sign anything. So the only possible writing is the manufacturer's note, which isn't signed by the supplier. So the statute of frauds requires the supplier's signature, which isn't there.

So looking at the options, option F says, "Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature." Wait, but the note was unsigned, but whose signature is missing? The manufacturer's note is from the manufacturer, so it's their own letter. But the statute requires the supplier's signature, as they're the party being sued. So the note doesn't have the supplier's signature.

Wait, no. The writing needs to be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought, which is the supplier. So the writing must be signed by the supplier. The manufacturer's note isn't signed by the supplier, so there's no signed writing from the supplier. Therefore, the statute of frauds applies, making the contract unenforceable.

So the correct answer would be F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.

Wait, but another point: the note was on company letterhead, but unsigned. So does that count as a signature? No, because the representative's name wasn't signed. So it's just an unsigned letter.

Alternatively, is the quantity term missing from the writing? The note didn't mention the quantity, so even if it was signed, it would still lack the necessary term.

So perhaps E is better because the writing lacks the quantity.

Wait, but the initial phone call had the quantity. So the question is whether the note, which doesn't include the quantity, is sufficient. The note doesn't have the quantity, so even if it was signed, it's missing a required element. Therefore, the writing is insufficient because it lacks the quantity term.

So the answer is E.

I'm a bit torn between E and F. Let me check: the statute of frauds requires a writing that includes the quantity and is signed. If the writing doesn't include the quantity, even if it's signed, it's insufficient. So E points out that the quantity isn't present, making the writing insufficient.

But in this case, the note didn't have the quantity, and it's unsigned. So both E and F are correct points, but which one is more directly relevant?

Wait, the note is from the manufacturer, and it's unsigned. So there's no writing signed by the supplier. So the main issue is the lack of a signed writing by the supplier.

Alternatively, the writing (the note) exists but doesn't have the quantity. So both issues may apply, but which is the reason the defense succeeds.

I think the key is that the writing doesn't include the quantity. The note doesn't mention how many motors, just that they're supplying them. So the quantity term is missing, which is required. So E is correct.

Wait, but the quantity was discussed in the phone call, but not in the writing. So the writing must include the quantity. So E is the reason.

So the answer is E.
</think>

The statute of frauds requires that certain contracts, including those for the sale of goods over $500, be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. In this case, the manufacturer and supplier verbally agreed to a contract for 300 washing machine motors at $300 each, totaling $90,000. The manufacturer sent an unsigned note on company letterhead acknowledging the supply but did not include the quantity term (300 motors). The note also lacked the supplier's signature.

The statute of frauds is not satisfied because the writing (the note) fails to include the quantity term, which is a required element for enforceability. While the lack of the supplier's signature is also a deficiency, the absence of the quantity term in the writing is the more critical issue. Therefore, the supplier's statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed.
