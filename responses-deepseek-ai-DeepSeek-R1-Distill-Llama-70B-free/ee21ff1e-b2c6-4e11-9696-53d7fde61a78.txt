Okay, so I've got this question about gender differences in conversation styles. The question is asking what research indicates about how women's conversation styles compare to men's. I need to pick the correct option from A to J.

First, I'll try to remember what I know about this topic. I remember that there's been a lot of research on how men and women communicate differently. One thing I've heard is that women tend to use more verbal cues and perhaps more fillers. Fillers are like the "ums" and "likes" people use when they're thinking or hesitating. So maybe option J is correct.

But wait, let me think through the other options to make sure. Option A: use more technical language. I'm not sure about that. I think men might use more technical terms in certain contexts, but I don't recall that being a general rule. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B: ask more questions. I think women are often seen as more collaborative in conversations, so they might ask more questions to engage others. But I'm not certain if that's a widely supported finding. I'll have to consider this.

Option C: talk for longer periods. I think men might dominate conversations more, taking up more time. So women probably don't talk longer; maybe the opposite. So C might not be right.

Option D: speak in a higher pitch. That's more about biology than conversation style. Women's voices are generally higher pitched, so D is true, but the question is about conversation style, not physical characteristics. So D might not be the answer they're looking for.

Option E: speak less frequently. This ties into the idea that men might interrupt more or dominate discussions, so women might speak less. But I'm not sure if this is a general finding or varies by context.

Option F: make more eye contact. I think women are often seen as more emotionally expressive, so they might make more eye contact. But I'm not certain if this is a research-backed difference.

Option G: interrupt more often. I've heard that men tend to interrupt more, so women would do this less. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H: use more body language. Women might use more non-verbal cues, so H could be a possibility. But I'm not sure if this is specifically highlighted in the options.

Option I: make less eye contact. If F is correct, then I isn't. But if F isn't supported, maybe I is. But I think F is more likely because women are thought to be more attentive in this way.

Option J: use more fillers. This rings a bell. I remember reading that women use more fillers as part of their speech patterns. So J might be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I've also heard that men might use more fillers in certain situations. But I think research suggests that women use more verbal fillers as part of their conversational style to maintain rapport.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is J.

Research on gender differences in conversation style suggests that women tend to use more fillers, such as "um" or "like," compared to men. This aligns with findings that women often use these verbal cues to maintain rapport and engage in conversation. 

Answer: J
