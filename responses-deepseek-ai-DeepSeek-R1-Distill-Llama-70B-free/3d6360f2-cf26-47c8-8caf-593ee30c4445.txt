Question:

The color of a pixel can be represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model, which stores values for red, green, and blue, each ranging from 0 to 255. How many bits (binary digits) would be needed to represent a color in the RGB model?

Options:

A: 56
B: 16
C: 64
D: 24
E: 8
F: 48
G: 12
H: 128
I: 72
J: 32

Okay, so I've got this question about the RGB color model and how many bits are needed to represent a color. Hmm, I remember that RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. Each of these colors is a component of the pixel's color. But wait, how does that translate into bits?

I think each color component ranges from 0 to 255. Oh right, because 0 is the minimum intensity and 255 is the maximum. So each component is represented by a byte, right? Because a byte is 8 bits. So 0 to 255 is 256 possible values, which is exactly what 8 bits can represent since 2^8 is 256.

So if each color (Red, Green, Blue) uses 8 bits, then the total would be 8 bits for red, plus 8 for green, plus 8 for blue. Let me add that up: 8 + 8 + 8 equals 24 bits. Oh, so the total number of bits needed is 24.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes systems might use more bits, but the standard RGB model as described here uses 8 bits per channel. So yes, 24 bits in total. I don't think there's any compression or anything like that involved here; the question is straightforward.

Looking at the options provided: option D is 24. So the answer should be D.

To determine the number of bits needed to represent a color in the RGB model, we note that each color component (Red, Green, and Blue) ranges from 0 to 255. This range corresponds to 256 possible values, which can be represented using 8 bits (since \(2^8 = 256\)). 

Since there are three color components, the total number of bits required is:
\[
8 \, \text{bits (Red)} + 8 \, \text{bits (Green)} + 8 \, \text{bits (Blue)} = 24 \, \text{bits}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **D: 24**.
