Question:

Describe the McCollough Effect. How does it support, the theorythat there are colored-line detectors in the human system ?

Options:

A: The McCollough Effect suggests that color and line detection are processed in separate, independent areas of the brain
B: The McCollough Effect reveals that color detection is influenced by motion detectors, not colored-line detectors
C: The McCollough Effect has nothing to do with colored-line detectors
D: The McCollough Effect indicates that color perception is solely dependent on context and lighting
E: The McCollough Effect demonstrates the existence of two complementary systems sensitive to certain colors, providing evidence for the colored-line detectors theory.
F: The McCollough Effect shows a temporal change in color perception, unrelated to any detectors
G: The McCollough Effect is an auditory phenomenon that does not involve color or line detection
H: The McCollough Effect proves the existence of only one system sensitive to color
I: The McCollough Effect supports the theory that color perception is a learned response with no specific detectors involved
J: The McCollough Effect disproves the existence of colored-line detectors

Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about the McCollough Effect and how it relates to colored-line detectors in the human visual system. I remember that the McCollough Effect is some kind of visual illusion or phenomenon, but I'm not exactly sure what it entails. Let me think.

I think the McCollough Effect has to do with aftereffects in color perception. From what I recall, when you stare at a pattern of colored lines for a while, and then look at a similar pattern without colors, you see afterimages in complementary colors. For example, if you look at a grid of red vertical lines and green horizontal lines, switching your gaze to a white grid would make you see green lines where the red ones were and red where the green were. So it's about how color and line orientation are connected in perception.

The question is about how this supports the theory that there are colored-line detectors. I remember that the idea is that cells in the visual cortex are specialized. Some detect lines at specific orientations, and others might be tuned to certain colors. The McCollough Effect suggests that these detectors are linked. Like, after staring, the detectors for red lines get fatigued, so when you look at white lines, the opposite color is perceived because the red detectors are tired.

Looking at the options:

Option A says color and line detection are separate. But the effect shows they're connected, so A might not be right.

Option B says color detection is influenced by motion detectors. I don't think motion is the main factor here; it's more about color and line orientation.

Option C says it has nothing to do with colored-line detectors. That doesn't make sense because the effect is used to support their existence.

Option D: Color perception is solely dependent on context and lighting. No, the effect is more about internal processing, not just external factors.

Option E: It demonstrates two complementary systems sensitive to certain colors, supporting colored-line detectors. This sounds right because the effect shows that when you tire one set, the complementary shows up, implying specific detectors.

Option F: It's a temporal change unrelated to detectors. Well, the change is due to the detectors getting fatigued, so F is probably wrong.

Option G: It's auditory. No, it's visual.

Option H: Only one system. The effect shows two complementary systems, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Color perception is learned with no detectors. No, the effect suggests there are specific detectors.

Option J: Disproves colored-line detectors. No, the effect supports, not disproves.

So the correct answer should be E. It shows two systems, which aligns with the idea of colored-line detectors.

The McCollough Effect demonstrates that staring at a pattern of colored lines (e.g., red vertical and green horizontal lines) and then viewing a similar white pattern results in seeing afterimages in complementary colors. This phenomenon supports the theory of colored-line detectors by suggesting that the visual system has specialized detectors for specific colors and orientations. These detectors can become fatigued, leading to the perception of complementary colors when the stimulus is removed. This indicates that color perception is not solely dependent on external factors but involves internal processing by specific visual mechanisms.

The correct answer is:

E: The McCollough Effect demonstrates the existence of two complementary systems sensitive to certain colors, providing evidence for the colored-line detectors theory.

Answer: E
