Alright, so I've got this problem about mass transfer from a vertical naphthalene plate in air. Hmm, okay, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The plate is suspended vertically, and it's in pure air at 1 atm. No forced convection, so it's natural convection only. The temperature is 115°F. I remember that for natural convection, things like the Grashof number come into play. Oh, right, and mass transfer is analogous to heat transfer in some ways, so maybe I can use similar correlations.

The problem has several parts (a to f), each asking for different things: average mass transfer coefficient, mass transfer rate, local coefficient, concentration gradient, boundary layer thickness, and maximum velocity. I'll need to approach each part methodically.

Wait, but they've given me multiple-choice options, so maybe I can compute each part and match to the options. Let's start with part (a): the average coefficient of mass transfer over the first 1.5 ft down the plate.

I recall that for natural convection mass transfer, the average mass transfer coefficient can be found using a correlation similar to the Nusselt number for heat transfer. The formula I think is something like:

h_m = (2 * D * Sc^n) / (x * (Gr_x/Sc)^{1/2})^{1/4})} ??

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Sherwood number. Oh right, the Sherwood number (Sh) is the mass transfer analog of the Nusselt number. For natural convection, the correlation is often given as Sh = 0.67 * (Gr * Sc)^{1/4} for a vertical plate.

Wait, no, wait. I think another form is Sh = ( (Gr * Sc) )^{1/4}, with some coefficient. Let me double-check. Oh, right, for laminar flow, which is the case here because it's natural convection and the plate isn't too long, the average Sherwood number over a length L is Sh_avg = 0.67 (Gr_L Sc)^{1/4}.

So first, I need to compute Grashof number (Gr) and Schmidt number (Sc) for this scenario.

But wait, I need the properties of air and naphthalene. Hmm, the temperature is 115°F, which is about 46°C (because 115-32=83, 83*5/9 is around 46). Wait, but I might need precise values. Oh, but perhaps I can use standard temperature and pressure properties if I don't have specific data.

Wait, but I think I need to know the diffusion coefficient (D) of naphthalene in air at this temperature. Because Sc = μ/(ρ D), right? And Gr is (g β ΔC x^3)/ν^2, but wait, no, Gr for mass transfer is Gr = (g * β_conc * (C_s - C_inf) * x^3 ) / ν^2. Hmm, but in mass transfer, sometimes the Grashof number is expressed in terms of concentration difference. Alternatively, the Grashof number for mass transfer is Gr_m = (g * (ρ_inf - ρ) * x^3 ) / (ρ * ν^2 ), but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, for concentration-driven natural convection, Gr is Gr = (g * β_c * (C_s - C_∞) * x^3 ) / ν^2, where β_c is the expansion coefficient for concentration, which is 1/C average, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this by looking up the necessary properties. Let me list what I need:

- Diffusion coefficient (D) of naphthalene in air at 115°F.
- Kinematic viscosity (ν) of air at 115°F.
- Schmidt number (Sc) is μ/(ρ D), but since ν = μ/ρ, Sc = ν / D.
- Density of air (ρ) at 115°F and 1 atm.
- The solubility or concentration of naphthalene in air, but wait, since it's pure air, the concentration at infinity is zero. So C_infinity = 0, and C_surface is the saturation concentration, which I might need. Wait, but maybe that's not directly needed for the Grashof number when using Sh correlations.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of dealing with Gr and Sc separately, I can use the form of the Sherwood number directly. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the mass transfer coefficient can be found using the Chilton-Colburn analogy, but that's more for forced convection. Since this is natural convection, the analogy might not apply directly.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, find the properties:

At 115°F (which is 46.1°C), the air properties are approximately:

- Density (ρ) ≈ 0.076 lbm/ft³ (I remember that at 70°F, it's about 0.0749, so a bit higher temp would make it lower. Maybe 0.072 lbm/ft³? Alternatively, perhaps use the ideal gas law.)

Wait, actually, maybe I should calculate the air density at 115°F and 1 atm (14.696 psia). The ideal gas law: PV = nRT. For air, R is 1716 ft·lbf/lbmol·R. Let's compute.

T = 115°F = 460 + 115 = 575 R.

Pressure P = 14.696 psia.

So ρ = (P M) / (R T). M for air is approximately 28.97 lbm/lbmol.

So ρ = (14.696 lb/in² * 28.97 lbm/lbmol) / (1716 ft·lbf/lbmol·R * 575 R).

Wait, let's compute units carefully.

First, convert P to lbf/ft²: 14.696 psi * 144 in²/ft² = 14.696 *144 = approx 2116.7 lb/ft².

R is 1716 ft·lbf/lbmol·R.

So ρ = (2116.7 lb/ft² * 28.97 lbm/lbmol) / (1716 ft·lbf/lbmol·R * 575 R).

Wait, but lb/ft² is lb force per area, while R is in ft·lbf/(lbmol·R). Hmm, maybe I should compute it numerically.

Compute numerator: 2116.7 * 28.97 ≈ let's see, 2000 *28.97=57,940, and 116.7*28.97≈3,380, so total ≈ 61,320 lb·lbmol/(ft²).

Denominator: 1716 *575 ≈ 1716*500=858,000, 1716*75=128,700 → total 986,700 ft·lb/(lbmol·R) * R → Wait, the R units cancel. So denominator is 986,700 ft·lb/(lbmol).

Wait, but the numerator is (lb/ft²) * (lbm/lbmol) → (lb/(ft²)) * (lbm/lbmol) → (lb * lbm)/(ft² lbmol). But the denominator is (ft·lb)/(lbmol). Hmm, maybe I messed up the units, perhaps an alternative approach is better.

Alternatively, since I'm getting stuck, maybe I can use standard density values. At 70°F, density is about 0.0749 lbm/ft³. At higher temperatures, it's lower. Maybe at 115°F, it's around 0.068 lbm/ft³. Let's go with that for now.

Next, kinematic viscosity (ν) of air. At 70°F, ν is about 0.0000167 ft²/s. At higher temps, it's higher. Maybe at 115°F, ν ≈ 0.0000185 ft²/s. Let me confirm that. Hmm, I think ν increases with temperature. At 100°F, ν is around 0.0000172, so at 115°F, maybe 0.000018 ft²/s.

Now, the diffusion coefficient (D) of naphthalene in air. I'm not sure of the exact value, but I remember that D for many organic vapors in air is on the order of 0.05 to 0.1 ft²/s at room temperature. Since temperature is higher, D increases. Let's say D ≈ 0.07 ft²/s at 115°F. Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise approach.

Wait, I think the diffusion coefficient for naphthalene in air is around 0.05 ft²/s at 20°C, and increases with temperature. The temperature dependence can be estimated using D = D_0 (T/T_0)^(3/2}, where D_0 is at T_0. If D_0 is 0.05 at 293K (20°C), then at 575 R (which is 315 K, because 575 R is 575 - 460 = 115 F = 46 C, which is 319 K, wait, no: 115 F is 46.1 C, which is 319.26 K. So D at 319 K would be D = 0.05 * (319/293)^(3/2). Let me compute that.

Compute (319/293) = approx 1.088. 1.088^(3/2) is sqrt(1.088)^3. Sqrt(1.088) ≈ 1.043, so 1.043^3 ≈ 1.132. So D ≈ 0.05 * 1.132 ≈ 0.0566 ft²/s. So let's take D ≈ 0.057 ft²/s.

Now, Schmidt number Sc = ν/D. So ν is 0.000018 ft²/s, D is 0.057 ft²/s. So Sc = 0.000018 / 0.057 ≈ 0.0003158. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 0.000018 / 0.057 = approx 0.0003158? Wait, 0.057 is 5.7e-2, 0.000018 is 1.8e-5. 1.8e-5 / 5.7e-2 = (1.8/5.7) * 1e-3 = 0.3158e-3 = 0.0003158. But Sc is usually around 0.2 to 1 for gases, so this seems low. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I messed up ν and D. Let me double-check: ν is kinematic viscosity, which for air at 100°F (about 38°C) is about 0.0000172 ft²/s. At 115°F, maybe around 0.000018 ft²/s. D for naphthalene at 20°C is about 0.05 ft²/s, so at 46°C, as calculated before, D is about 0.057 ft²/s. So Sc = 0.000018 / 0.057 ≈ 3.16e-4, which is 0.000316. That's way lower than typical Sc for gases, which are usually around 0.2-2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the D value.

Wait, perhaps D for naphthalene in air is higher. I might have been thinking of a different substance. Let me think: for example, water vapor in air has D around 0.25 ft²/s at 20°C. Naphthalene is a larger molecule, so its D should be lower. So maybe D is around 0.05 ft²/s at 20°C, which would make it around 0.06 at 46°C. So Sc = ν/D = 0.000018 / 0.06 ≈ 0.0003, which is 0.0003, so Sc ≈ 0.0003. That seems very low, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Schmidt number for gases is typically low, like 0.5-1. Maybe my D is wrong. Let me think again: perhaps D for naphthalene in air is around 0.1 ft²/s at room temp. So if at 20°C, D is 0.1, then at 46°C, it's higher. Maybe D ≈ 0.12 ft²/s. Then Sc = ν/D = 0.000018 / 0.12 = 0.00015, which is even lower. That doesn't make sense because Sc for gases should be around 0.5-1. I must be making a mistake in my estimates.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the Schmidt number for naphthalene in air. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the units. Wait, D is in ft²/s, and ν is in ft²/s, so Sc is unitless. Let me think of another approach. Maybe using the fact that for air, Sc for naphthalene is around 2. So perhaps I should take Sc = 2. Maybe that's a standard value. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation using the properties I have, even if I'm unsure.

Wait, another way: the correlation for Sherwood number in natural convection is Sh = (Gr Sc)^{1/4} * some constant. Wait, the exact correlation might be Sh = 0.67 (Gr Sc)^{1/4} for a vertical plate. So if I can compute Gr and Sc, I can find Sh, and from Sh, get h_m.

Wait, but Gr is the Grashof number for mass transfer, which is Gr = (g * β_c * (C_s - C_inf) * x^3) / ν^2. But β_c is the concentration expansion coefficient, which is 1/C_avg. Since C_inf is zero (pure air), C_avg is C_s / 2, so β_c = 2 / C_s. So Gr becomes Gr = (g * (2/C_s) * C_s * x^3 ) / ν^2 = (2 g x^3) / ν^2.

Wait, that simplifies things! Because the C_s terms cancel out. So Gr = (2 g x^3) / ν^2. That's helpful.

Given that, let's compute Gr for x = 1.5 ft.

g is 32.2 ft/s².

So Gr = (2 * 32.2 * (1.5)^3 ) / (ν^2).

Let's compute numerator: 2 * 32.2 = 64.4. 1.5^3 = 3.375. So 64.4 * 3.375 ≈ 64.4 * 3 = 193.2, 64.4 * 0.375 ≈ 24.15 → total ≈ 217.35.

Denominator: ν^2. ν is 0.000018 ft²/s → (0.000018)^2 = 3.24e-10.

So Gr ≈ 217.35 / 3.24e-10 ≈ 6.7e+11. Wait, that's a huge Grashof number. But that can't be right because for natural convection, Gr is typically in the range of 1e8 to 1e12 for a 1m (3.28 ft) plate. So 1.5 ft (0.457 m) would have Gr around 1e10, perhaps. Wait, but my calculation gives 6.7e11, which is plausible. Let's proceed.

Now, with Gr = ~6.7e11 and Sc, which I'm not sure about. Let's say Sc is around 2, as a guess. Wait, but earlier estimates gave Sc as 0.0003, which is way too low. I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correct Sc by looking up the properties.

Wait, perhaps I should find the correct Sc. Sc = ν / D. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.

Given that ν = 0.000018 ft²/s (approximate for air at 115°F), and D for naphthalene in air is around 0.057 ft²/s (as calculated earlier), then Sc = 0.000018 / 0.057 ≈ 0.0003158. That's 3.158e-4, which is way too low. But that can't be right. Schmidt numbers for gases are typically around 0.5 to 1. So perhaps my D is wrong.

Wait, maybe I got the units wrong for D. Oh! Wait, in the US system, D is often expressed in ft²/s. Let me check: if D is 0.057 ft²/s, that's 0.057 sq.ft. per second. Wait, but that seems high. Because 1 ft²/s is quite large. Let me think about room temperature: for CO2 in air, D is about 0.13 ft²/s. So for naphthalene, which is larger, D should be lower, say 0.05 ft²/s at room temp, and higher at higher temps. So perhaps D at 115°F is 0.07 ft²/s. Then Sc = 0.000018 / 0.07 = 0.000257, which is 2.57e-4. That's even lower. Hmm.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Maybe the correct unit for D is cm²/s, not ft²/s. Because usually, D for gases is on the order of 0.1 to 1 cm²/s, which is 0.001 to 0.01 ft²/s. Oh! That's probably where I went wrong. So D in cm²/s is say, 0.2 cm²/s at room temp. So 0.2 cm²/s is 0.2e-4 ft²/s, because 1 cm² = 1e-4 ft², and 1 s is same. So D = 0.2e-4 ft²/s at room temp. At higher temp, say 115°F, D would be higher, maybe 0.3e-4 ft²/s.

So let's recalculate Sc. ν = 0.000018 ft²/s, D = 0.3e-4 ft²/s. So Sc = 0.000018 / 0.00003 = 0.6. That makes more sense. So Sc ≈ 0.6.

Wait, that's better. So Sc = 0.6. Now, let's recalculate
