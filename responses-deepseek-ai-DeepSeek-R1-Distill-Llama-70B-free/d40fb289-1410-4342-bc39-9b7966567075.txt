Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question with two statements, and I need to figure out if each is true or false. The options are from A to J, each combining the truth values of Statement 1 and Statement 2. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: It says that if the sum of the absolute values of a series diverges (∑|a_i| diverges) and the sum of the series itself ∑a_i equals 2, then there exists a rearrangement of the terms such that the sum is 4. Hmm, I remember something about Riemann rearrangement theorem. Oh right, that theorem says that if a series is conditionally convergent (meaning the series converges but the sum of absolute values diverges), then you can rearrange the terms to make the series converge to any real number, or even diverge. So in this case, since ∑|a_i| diverges, and ∑a_i converges to 2, the series is conditionally convergent. According to Riemann's theorem, we should be able to rearrange it to sum to 4. So Statement 1 seems to be true.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: It states that there exist metric spaces X and Y where X is closed and bounded, and there's a continuous mapping f: X → Y such that f(X) is not "closed and bounded." Wait, I remember the Heine-Borel theorem, which says that in Euclidean space, a set is compact if and only if it's closed and bounded. But here, the question is about a continuous function mapping a closed and bounded set X to Y. But wait, Heine-Borel applies to subsets of Euclidean spaces, right? So if X is a closed and bounded subset in, say, R^n, then it's compact. And since f is continuous, f(X) would be compact in Y. But in metric spaces, compact sets are closed and bounded (since in metric spaces, compact implies closed and bounded, but the converse isn't always true). Wait, no—actually, in general metric spaces, closed and bounded doesn't imply compact. But if X is compact (as it is closed and bounded in Euclidean space), then f(X) is compact in Y because continuous images of compact sets are compact. And in any metric space, compact sets are closed. But whether f(X) is bounded depends on the space Y. Wait, no, because in any metric space, compact subsets are closed and bounded. So f(X) would be compact, hence closed and bounded in Y. But wait, the statement says that f(X) is NOT closed and bounded. So this would require that in some metric space Y, a compact set isn't closed and bounded. But that doesn't make sense because in metric spaces, compact sets are closed and bounded. So maybe Statement 2 is false?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Heine-Borel says in Euclidean space, closed and bounded implies compact. But in other metric spaces, compact doesn't necessarily come from being closed and bounded. Also, even if X is compact, when you map it via f to Y, f(X) is compact in Y. And in Y, compact sets are closed, so f(X) is closed. And in a metric space, every compact set is bounded because for some epsilon, you can cover it with a finite number of epsilon-balls, and the diameter would be bounded by, say, epsilon times the number of balls. So f(X) should be closed and bounded in Y. Therefore, it's impossible for f(X) to not be closed and bounded if X is compact (i.e., closed and bounded in Euclidean space) and f is continuous. So Statement 2 is claiming that such spaces exist, but according to my reasoning, it's not possible. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Suppose Y is a metric space where not all closed and bounded sets are compact. But that's the other way around. The statement is about f(X) not being closed and bounded. But X is closed and bounded, so it's compact, and f(X) is compact in Y. Compact sets in metric spaces are closed and bounded, so f(X) must be closed and bounded. Therefore, Statement 2 is false because you can't have f(X) not closed and bounded in that scenario.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, let's see which option corresponds to Statement 1 being true and Statement 2 being false.

Looking at the options:

A: F, NS
B: F, F
C: NS, T
D: T, NS
E: NS, NS
F: T, F
G: F, T
H: T, Cannot determine
I: NS, F
J: T, T

From my analysis, Statement 1 is true (so options where first is T) and Statement 2 is false (so second is F). So only option F matches: T, F.

Statement 1: The statement claims that if ∑|a_i| diverges and ∑a_i converges to 2, then there exists a rearrangement of the terms such that the sum is 4. This is supported by the Riemann Rearrangement Theorem, which states that conditionally convergent series (where ∑a_i converges but ∑|a_i| diverges) can be rearranged to converge to any real number. Therefore, Statement 1 is **true**.

Statement 2: The statement suggests that there exist metric spaces X and Y, with X being closed and bounded, and a continuous mapping f: X → Y such that f(X) is not "closed and bounded." However, by the Heine-Borel theorem, closed and bounded sets in Euclidean spaces are compact, and continuous images of compact sets are compact. In metric spaces, compact sets are always closed and bounded. Thus, f(X) must be closed and bounded in Y, making it impossible for f(X) to not be closed and bounded. Therefore, Statement 2 is **false**.

Combining the evaluations, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. The correct option is:

F: True, False

Answer: F
