Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this bond cost problem. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about calculating the total cost of purchasing three $1,000 bonds. Each bond has a 6% interest rate, and the interest is payable on January 1 and July 1. The purchase date is August 30, and each bond is bought at 102. There's also a brokerage fee of $5 per bond. I need to include the accrued interest in the total cost.

Hmm, okay, so each bond has a face value of $1,000, but they're bought at 102, which I think means 102% of the face value. So that would be $1,020 per bond. But wait, that's the price I pay on the purchase date, but because interest is paid semi-annually, I need to calculate how much interest has accrued since the last payment date up to the purchase date.

The interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 each year. So the last payment before August 30 would have been on July 1. So the time between July 1 and August 30 is how much? Let's see, July has 31 days, so from July 1 to August 30 is 30 days in August plus the remaining 0 days in July after July 1. Wait, wait, from July 1 to August 30 is 59 days? Because July has 31 days, so July 2 to July 31 is 30 days, plus August 30 days, so 60 days? Wait, no, wait. If I count from July 1 to August 30, inclusive? Or exclusive? Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. From July 1 to August 1 is 31 days (July). Then from August 1 to August 30 is 29 days. So total is 31 + 29 = 60 days. Or wait, if I'm calculating the number of days between July 1 and August 30, it's actually 60 days because July 1 is day 1, and August 30 is day 60. Or is it 59 days? Wait, no, because when you count from day 1 to day 60, that's exactly 59 intervals, but 60 days. Wait, no, wait. Let's say July 1 is day 0, then August 30 is day 60, because July has 31 days. So from July 1 (day 0) to August 1 is 31 days (day 31), then August 30 is day 60. So the number of days since the last interest payment (July 1) is 60 days.

Wait, but wait, the interest is paid on January 1 and July 1. So when the bond is purchased on August 30, the next interest payment is coming up on January 1 next year. So the time since the last payment (July 1) is 60 days.

Since the interest is 6% annually, the bond pays 3% semi-annually. So each payment is $30 (since 6% of 1000 is 60, split into two, so 30 each). But when calculating accrued interest, it's the interest that has been earned but not yet paid. So from July 1 to August 30, which is 60 days, the bond has accrued some interest.

To calculate the accrued interest, I can think of it as a fraction of the semi-annual payment. So the semi-annual interest is $30. The number of days in the semi-annual period is 182 days (from July 1 to December 31 is 184 days? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the bond pays interest semi-annually on January 1 and July 1. So each period is six months. The exact days can vary, but for calculation purposes, it's usually assumed to be 180 days per period, or sometimes using 365 for daily calculations.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether to use 360 or 365 days. Hmm, maybe it's acceptable to calculate based on 180 days per semi-annual period.

So the period is from July 1 to December 31, which is 184 days (July 31 days, August 31, September 30, October 31, November 30, December 31). Wait, no, the next payment is January 1, so the period would be from July 1 to December 31, which is 184 days (July: 31, August:31, Sept:30, Oct:31, Nov:30, Dec:31: 31+31=62 +30=92 +31=123 +30=153 +31=184). But wait, in some systems, they might use 180 days for simplicity.

So for each semi-annual period, it's either 180 or 184 days. Since the question gives exact dates, perhaps using the actual days is better. So from July 1 to August 30 is 60 days.

So the accrued interest per bond would be (60 days / 184 days) * $30.

Wait, but wait, the payment dates are January 1 and July 1, so the periods are from Jan 1 to June 30 (182 days?) and July 1 to Dec 31 (another 184 days?), but perhaps for simplicity, each period is considered 180 days.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of each period as 180 days. So each semi-annual period is 180 days. So from July 1 to December 31 is 180 days.

So the time since the last payment is 60 days, so the accrued interest is (60 / 180) * 30.

60 divided by 180 is 1/3. So 1/3 of $30 is $10.

So each bond has $10 in accrued interest.

Therefore, the cost per bond is the purchase price plus accrued interest and brokerage fee.

Wait, no, the purchase price is 102, which is $1,020. Then, the accrued interest is $10, and the brokerage fee is $5.

Wait, but wait: when you buy a bond, the purchase price includes the accrued interest, or is it separate? Hmm, I think when you buy a bond between interest payment dates, the purchase price (the price quoted, like 102) is for the bond itself, and then you have to add the accrued interest, which the seller has earned but not yet received. So the total cost would be 102 (bond price) + accrued interest (the interest that's been accumulating since last payment) plus any fees.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps the quoted price (102) is the clean price, which doesn't include accrued interest. So the total cost per bond would be: 102 * 1000 = $1,020 (price) + accrued interest ($10) + brokerage fee ($5). So per bond, it's $1,020 + $10 + $5 = $1,035.

Wait, but wait, some sources say that the quoted price is the clean price, and the dirty price (total cost) is clean price plus accrued interest. So yes, the total cost per bond is 102 (clean price) + accrued interest.

Wait, but wait, what's the formula? Let me think.

The formula for the price of a bond including accrued interest is:

Dirty Price = Clean Price + Accrued Interest

So in this case, the clean price is 102% of face value, which is $1,020. The accrued interest is calculated as (days since last payment / days in period) * (semi-annual interest).

So for each bond:

Accrued Interest = (60 days / 180 days) * $30 = (1/3) * 30 = $10.

So Dirty Price per bond is $1,020 + $10 = $1,030.

Then, add the brokerage fee of $5 per bond. So per bond cost is $1,030 + $5 = $1,035.

Now, since we're buying three bonds, multiply by 3.

$1,035 * 3 = $3,105.

Looking at the options, option C is $3,105.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, the purchase date is August 30. The last interest payment was on July 1. So how many days between July 1 and August 30?

July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31 is 31 days.

August 1 to August 30 is 30 days. So total is 31 + 30 = 61 days? Wait, wait: from July 1 to August 30 is 60 days because July 1 is day 1.

Wait, no. Let me count: July 1 is day 1, July 2 is day 2, ..., July 31 is day 31. Then August 1 is day 32, August 2 is 33, up to August 30 which is day 61. So the total days are 61.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, from July 1 to August 30 is 60 days. Because July 1 to July 31 is 31 days, and August 1 to August 30 is 30 days, so 31 +30 =61 days? Or is it 60 days because July 1 to August 30 is 60 days inclusive?

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate using a 360-day year for simplicity, as is common in some bond calculations. So 6% annual interest, so semi-annual is 3%, which is $30 per period.

If the period is considered 180 days (from July 1 to Dec 31 as 180 days), then 60 days have passed.

So 60/180 = 1/3. So $10 as before.

But if using actual days, 61 days, then 61/184 would be approximately 0.331, so $30 * 0.331 ≈ $9.93, which is about $10.

In any case, the accrued interest is approximately $10 per bond.

So total per bond is 1020 +10 +5 =1035.

Three bonds: 3 * 1035 = 3105, which is option C.

But let me double-check the calculation.

Another approach: Compute the annual interest is 6% of 1000 = 60. So each semi-annual payment is 30.

The number of days since last payment is August 30 minus July 1. Let's compute the days.

July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31 is 31 days.

August 30 days: so from August 1 to August 30 is 30 days.

Total days since last payment: 31 (July) +30 (August up to 30th) =61 days.

Assuming a 360-day year, each semi-annual period is 180 days.

So the fraction is 61/180.

So the accrued interest is (61/180)*30 = (61*30)/180 = 61/6 ≈10.1667.

So approximately $10.17 per bond.

So per bond cost would be 1020 +10.17 +5 = 1035.17.

Three bonds would be 3105.50.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C: $3,105.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses 60 days, which would make the calculation exact: 60/180=1/3, so 10.00.

So that's why the answer is $3,105.

So the correct option is C.
</think>

To calculate the total cost of purchasing three $1,000 bonds with 6% annual interest (payable semi-annually on January 1 and July 1), purchased on August 30 at 102, including accrued interest and a brokerage fee of $5 per bond, proceed as follows:

1. **Bond Price (Clean Price):**  
   Each bond is purchased at 102, which means 102% of the face value ($1,000).  
   \[
   \text{Clean Price per bond} = 102 \times 1,000 = \$1,020
   \]

2. **Accrued Interest:**  
   The last interest payment was on July 1, and the purchase date is August 30. The number of days between July 1 and August 30 is 61 days.  
   The semi-annual interest payment is:  
   \[
   \text{Semi-annual interest} = \frac{6\%}{2} \times 1,000 = \$30
   \]  
   Assuming a 180-day period for simplicity, the accrued interest is:  
   \[
   \text{Accrued Interest per bond} = \left(\frac{61}{180}\right) \times 30 \approx \$10.17
   \]  
   For simplicity, this is approximated as \$10 per bond.

3. **Brokerage Fee:**  
   The brokerage fee is \$5 per bond.

4. **Total Cost per Bond:**  
   The total cost per bond includes the clean price, accrued interest, and brokerage fee:  
   \[
   \text{Total Cost per bond} = \$1,020 + \$10 + \$5 = \$1,035
   \]

5. **Total Cost for Three Bonds:**  
   For three bonds, the total cost is:  
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 3 \times \$1,035 = \$3,105
   \]

Thus, the total cost, including accrued interest and brokerage fees, is **\$3,105**.
