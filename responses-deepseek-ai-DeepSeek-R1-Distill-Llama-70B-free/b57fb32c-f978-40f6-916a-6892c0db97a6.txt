Alright, let's try to tackle this genetics problem. Okay, so the question is about the mutation of a gene and how many generations it takes for the frequency of the mutant allele to increase from 2% to 3%. Hmm, I remember that mutation rates can affect allele frequencies over time, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas.

So, the gene C is mutating to c at a frequency of 2e-6 per generation. And there are no other forces like selection or genetic drift, just mutation. Mating is random, so that probably means we can ignore things like assortative mating or inbreeding.

I think the key here is to model how the allele frequency changes over time due to mutation. I recall there's a formula for allele frequency change when mutation is the only force. Since only C is mutating to c, and not the other way around, this is a one-way mutation.

Wait, but wait—oh, no, actually, the problem doesn't mention back mutation, so we can assume that mutation is only from C to c. So each generation, some C alleles turn into c. 

The initial frequency of c is 2%, which is 0.02, and we want it to reach 3%, 0.03. So the change is 0.01 increase. How does mutation affect this?

I think the formula for the frequency of a mutant allele after t generations, when mutation is the only force, is something like q_t = q_0 + (u * t), but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe it's a bit different because each generation, a small fraction of C alleles mutate to c.

Let me think more carefully. Let's denote u as the mutation rate from C to c, which is 2e-6 per generation. Each generation, the number of new c alleles added is u multiplied by the number of C alleles present.

At any time t, the frequency of C is (1 - q_t), since q_t is the frequency of c. So the change in q each generation, delta_q, should be approximately u * (1 - q_t). But wait, because each C allele has a probability u of turning into c each generation.

So the recurrence relation would be q_{t+1} = q_t + u*(1 - q_t). Because each generation, the existing c alleles stay, and new c's are added from C's mutating.

But solving this recurrence exactly might be a bit tricky. Alternatively, if u is very small and q is small, maybe we can approximate this as a continuous process. Let me think of it as a differential equation.

Let’s model dq/dt = u * (1 - q). This is a differential equation where the rate of change of q is proportional to the remaining C alleles. We can solve this differential equation.

Separating variables: dq / (1 - q) = u dt.

Integrate both sides. The integral of dq/(1-q) is -ln(1-q) + C1. The integral of u dt is u t + C2.

So combining: -ln(1 - q) = u t + C.

At t=0, q = q0 (which is 0.02). Plugging in: -ln(1 - 0.02) = 0 + C → C = -ln(0.98).

So the equation becomes: -ln(1 - q) = u t - ln(0.98).

Let me rearrange this: ln(0.98) = u t + ln(1 - q).

Wait, maybe it's better to solve for t. Let's write:

-ln(1 - q) = u t + (-ln(0.98)).

Wait, no, let me correct. At t=0, q=0.02. So substituting into the integrated equation:

-ln(1 - 0.02) = 0 + C → C = -ln(0.98).

So the equation is: -ln(1 - q) = u t + (-ln(0.98)).

Wait, no: when I integrated, the equation was -ln(1 - q) = u t + C. At t=0, q=0.02, so:

-ln(1 - 0.02) = 0 + C → C = -ln(0.98) ≈ 0.02020 (since ln(0.98) is approximately -0.02020).

Wait, wait, let me compute ln(0.98). Since ln(1-x) ≈ -x for small x. So ln(0.98)=ln(1 - 0.02) ≈ -0.02 - (0.02)^2/2 - ... ≈ -0.02020.

So, C is approximately 0.02020.

So the equation is: -ln(1 - q) = u t + 0.02020.

Wait, but let me think again. The correct equation is:

After integration, we have:

-ln(1 - q) = u t + C.

At t=0, q = 0.02:

C = -ln(1 - 0.02) = -ln(0.98) ≈ 0.02020.

So the equation becomes:

-ln(1 - q) = u t + 0.02020.

We can rearrange for t:

t = [ -ln(1 - q) - 0.02020 ] / u.

Wait, but let's write it correctly. Let me write:

ln(1 - q) = - (u t + 0.02020 )

So 1 - q = e^(- u t - 0.02020 )

But maybe it's easier to stick with the equation:

t = [ -ln(1 - q) + ln(0.98) ] / u.

Because:

From the equation: -ln(1 - q) = u t + C, and C = -ln(0.98).

So substituting C:

-ln(1 - q) = u t - ln(0.98).

Multiplying both sides by -1:

ln(1 - q) = -u t + ln(0.98).

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's write the equation as:

u t = [ -ln(1 - q) + ln(0.98) ].

So t = [ ln(0.98) - ln(1 - q) ] / u.

Wait, because:

From the integrated equation:

-ln(1 - q) = u t + (-ln(0.98)).

So, bringing the -ln(0.98) to the left:

-ln(1 - q) + ln(0.98) = u t.

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln( (1 - q)^-1 ) - ln(0.98^-1 ) = u t.

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's compute the difference.

Wait, let's express it as:

t = (ln(0.98) - ln(1 - q)) / u.

Wait, let me plug in the values:

We want to find t when q goes from 0.02 to 0.03.

Wait, no, actually, the initial condition is q0=0.02, and we're looking for when q=0.03.

So, substituting into the equation:

t = [ ln(0.98) - ln(1 - 0.03) ] / (2e-6).

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute ln(0.98): As before, approximately -0.02020.

Compute ln(1 - 0.03) = ln(0.97) ≈ Let's calculate that. Using a calculator, ln(0.97) is approximately -0.030459.

So, ln(0.98) is approximately -0.02020, and ln(0.97) is approximately -0.030459.

So, substituting into the equation:

t = [ (-0.02020) - (-0.030459) ] / (2e-6).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, in the equation, it's ln(0.98) - ln(1 - q_final).

Wait, so q_final is 0.03. So 1 - q_final is 0.97.

So:

ln(0.98) = -0.02020,

ln(0.97) = -0.030459.

So the numerator is (-0.02020) - (-0.030459) = 0.010259.

So t = 0.010259 / (2e-6) = 0.010259 / 0.000002 = let's compute that.

Wait, 0.010259 divided by 0.000002 is the same as 0.010259 * 1e6 / 2 = 10259 * 1e-6 * 1e6 / 2 → 10259 / 2 ≈ 5129.5.

So approximately 5,130 generations.

Looking at the options, option J is 5,128, which is very close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps my approximation of the logarithms isn't precise enough.

Wait, maybe I should use more accurate values for the natural logs.

Let me compute ln(0.98) more accurately. Using a calculator:

ln(0.98) = approximately -0.020202706.

ln(0.97) = approximately -0.030459211.

So the numerator is (-0.020202706) - (-0.030459211) = 0.010256505.

So t = 0.010256505 / (2e-6) = 0.010256505 / 0.000002 = 5,128.2525.

So approximately 5,128 generations. Which matches option J: 5,128.

But wait, let me think again about the formula. Did I get the formula right?

The model I used assumes that each generation, the increase in q is u*(1 - q). So this is a model where C mutates to c at rate u, and there's no back mutation. So the formula dq/dt = u*(1 - q) is correct.

Yes, I think the approach is correct. So the answer should be approximately 5,128 generations, which is option J.

To determine how many generations are needed for the frequency of allele \( c \) to increase from 2% to 3% due to mutation, we model the change in allele frequency over time. The mutation rate \( u \) is given as \( 2 \times 10^{-6} \) per generation, and there are no other evolutionary forces acting on the alleles. The increase in \( q \), the frequency of \( c \), can be described by the differential equation:

\[
\frac{dq}{dt} = u(1 - q),
\]

where \( 1 - q \) represents the frequency of the wild-type allele \( C \). Solving this differential equation with the initial condition \( q_0 = 0.02 \), we integrate to find:

\[
-\ln(1 - q) = ut + C,
\]

where \( C \) is the constant of integration. Using the initial condition \( q = 0.02 \) at \( t = 0 \), we calculate \( C = -\ln(0.98) \). Substituting this back, the equation becomes:

\[
-\ln(1 - q) = ut - \ln(0.98).
\]

Rearranging for \( t \), we get:

\[
t = \frac{\ln(0.98) - \ln(1 - q)}{u}.
\]

Substituting \( q = 0.03 \) (the target frequency) and using \( u = 2 \times 10^{-6} \), we calculate:

\[
\ln(0.98) \approx -0.020202706, \quad \ln(0.97) \approx -0.030459211.
\]

The numerator becomes:

\[
\ln(0.98) - \ln(0.97) = -0.020202706 - (-0.030459211) = 0.010256505.
\]

Thus:

\[
t = \frac{0.010256505}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = 5128.2525.
\]

This rounds to approximately 5,128 generations. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**J: 5,128 generations.**
