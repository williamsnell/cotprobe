Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and charges on a wire and a cylindrical shell. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with electric fields around charged objects, Gauss's Law is super useful. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a long, straight wire with a fixed negative charge. The linear charge density is given as 3.6 nC/m. Linear charge density λ is the charge per unit length, right? So λ = 3.6 nC/m. But wait, nC is nanoCoulombs, which is 10^-9 C. So λ is 3.6e-9 C/m. Oh, and the charge is negative, so maybe the direction of the electric field will matter, but I think for the magnitude, the sign won't affect the calculation directly since we're looking for the surface charge density σ.

Then there's a coaxial, thin-walled nonconducting cylindrical shell enclosing the wire. The shell has a radius of 1.5 cm, which is 0.015 meters. The shell has positive charge on its outside surface, and the surface charge density σ is what we're supposed to find. The condition is that the net external electric field is zero. So I guess that means the electric field outside the shell is zero. Wait, no, the net electric field outside—so what's the setup here.

Wait, let me think. The wire has charge, and the shell is enclosing it. Since the shell is nonconducting, the charge on it can be considered as a surface charge. But wait, the shell is thin-walled, so the charge is only on the outer surface. Oh wait, no—the problem says the shell has positive charge on its outside surface. So the charge on the shell is on the outside, not the inside. Because in a conductor, the charges reside on the surface, but this is a nonconductor, so the charge is applied on the outer surface.

Now, the idea is that the electric field outside the entire system (wire plus shell) should be zero. So the electric fields from both the wire and the shell must cancel each other out in the region outside the shell. Wait, no, because if the shell is surrounding the wire, the field outside would be due to both charges. But the problem says the net external electric field is zero. So the fields from the wire and the shell must add to zero outside.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of Gauss's Law. The total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the shell would be the sum of the charge on the wire and the charge on the shell. Because the shell's charge is on its outside surface, which is inside the Gaussian surface if we draw it outside the shell.

Wait, no, the shell is a cylinder, so the charge on its outer surface is at radius 1.5 cm. So a Gaussian surface drawn at a radius larger than 1.5 cm would enclose both the wire's charge and the shell's charge.

So the electric field at a point outside the shell (r > 1.5 cm) would be due to the total charge enclosed. The problem states that this field is zero. So the total charge enclosed must be zero.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the electric field outside is zero, by Gauss's Law, the total enclosed charge must be zero. Because E * 2πrL = Q_enc / ε₀. If E is zero, then Q_enc must be zero.

So the total charge per unit length inside the Gaussian surface is the sum of the wire's charge and the shell's charge. Wait, but the shell is a cylindrical surface, so its charge per unit length would be the surface charge density σ times the circumference, right? Because surface charge density is charge per area. So for a cylinder, the area per unit length is 2πr (circumference) times the unit length. So the charge per unit length on the shell would be σ * (2πr), where r is 1.5 cm or 0.015 m.

So the total enclosed charge per unit length is λ (from the wire) plus σ * 2πr (from the shell). But since the electric field outside is zero, the net enclosed charge must be zero. So:

λ + σ * 2πr = 0

Wait, but the wire has a negative charge, right? Because the problem says the linear charge density is of magnitude 3.6nC/m, but the wire is negative. So λ is negative. So let me write that equation again.

λ_wire + λ_shell = 0

Because the sum of the charge per unit length should be zero.

Wait, the wire has charge per unit length λ = -3.6e-9 C/m (since it's negative).

The shell's charge per unit length would be σ * 2πr. Because for a cylinder, the area per unit length is the circumference (2πr) times the length L, so the charge is σ*(2πr L) → per unit length, it's σ*(2πr).

So, the sum is:

λ_wire + λ_shell = 0

Plugging in the values:

(-3.6e-9 C/m) + σ*(2π * 0.015 m) = 0

So solving for σ:

σ*(2π * 0.015) = 3.6e-9

So σ = (3.6e-9) / (2π * 0.015)

Let me compute that.

Compute denominator first: 2 * π * 0.015 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 0.015 ≈ 6.2832 * 0.015 ≈ 0.094245 m.

So denominator ≈ 0.094245 m.

So σ ≈ 3.6e-9 C/m / 0.094245 m

Wait, wait, no: 3.6e-9 is in C/m, and denominator is in meters, so the units would be (C/m) / m → C/m², which is correct for surface charge density.

So let's compute the numerical value.

3.6e-9 / 0.094245 ≈ ?

Well, 3.6e-9 is 3.6 * 1e-9.

0.094245 is approximately 0.0942.

So 3.6 / 0.0942 ≈ let's see. 0.0942 is about 0.094. 3.6 divided by 0.094 is approximately 38.297...

Wait, 0.0942 * 38 = 3.5796, which is close to 3.6. So approximately 38.3.

So 38.3 * 1e-9 → 3.83e-8 C/m².

Looking at the options, option A is 3.8e-8, which is close. But let me compute more accurately.

Wait, let's compute 3.6e-9 / (2 * π * 0.015) more accurately.

2 * π is approximately 6.283185307.

6.283185307 * 0.015 = 0.0942457786.

So 3.6e-9 / 0.0942457786 = ?

3.6e-9 / 0.0942457786 ≈ Let me compute 3.6 / 0.0942457786.

3.6 / 0.0942457786 = ?

Calculate 3.6 ÷ 0.0942457786:

Let me write it as 3.6 / 0.0942457786 ≈ 38.19.

So 38.19e-9 → 3.819e-8 C/m².

Looking at the options, option A is 3.8e-8, which is close. But wait, let me see the other options. Option B is 4.8e-8, which is larger. Option G is 4.2e-8. Option C is 5.0e-8. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the equation. The sum of the charge per unit length should be zero.

The wire's charge is negative, so λ_wire = -3.6e-9 C/m.

The shell's charge per unit length is σ * 2πr.

So, -3.6e-9 + σ * 2πr = 0 → σ = (3.6e-9) / (2πr)

Which is what I did. So the calculation seems right.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

3.6e-9 / (2 * π * 0.015) → 3.6e-9 / (0.0942477) → 3.6 / 0.0942477 = approx 38.19.

So 38.19e-9 → 3.819e-8 C/m².

So that's approximately 3.8e-8, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 3.2e-8, and others. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute 3.6 / 0.0942477 again.

Let me compute 3.6 divided by 0.0942477.

3.6 ÷ 0.0942477.

Let me compute this division:

0.0942477 × 38 = ?

0.0942477 * 38:

Calculate 0.0942477 * 30 = 2.82743

0.0942477 * 8 = 0.753982

Sum: 2.82743 + 0.753982 = 3.581412.

Which is close to 3.6. The difference is 3.6 - 3.581412 = 0.018588.

So how much more than 38 is needed? Let's find x where 0.0942477*(38 + x) = 3.6.

We have 3.581412 + 0.0942477 x = 3.6 → 0.0942477 x = 0.018588 → x ≈ 0.018588 / 0.0942477 ≈ 0.1973.

So 38.1973 → approx 38.2.

So 38.2e-9 is 3.82e-8 C/m².

Looking at the options, option A is 3.8e-8, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the radius as 1.5 cm but in Gauss's law, the radius is in meters, which I think I did correctly (0.015 m).

Wait, let me make sure about units. The radius is 1.5 cm → 0.015 m. Correct.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So σ is approximately 3.8e-8 C/m², which is option A.

To solve the problem, we use Gauss's Law and the condition that the net external electric field is zero. This implies that the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the cylindrical shell must be zero. The system consists of a long, straight wire with a linear charge density \( \lambda = -3.6 \, \mathrm{nC/m} \) (negative because the wire has a negative charge) and a coaxial, thin-walled nonconducting cylindrical shell of radius \( r = 1.5 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.015 \, \mathrm{m} \), with a surface charge density \( \sigma \) on its outer surface.

The total charge per unit length enclosed by a Gaussian surface outside the shell is the sum of the charge per unit length on the wire and the shell. For the shell, the charge per unit length is \( \sigma \cdot 2\pi r \), where \( 2\pi r \) is the circumference of the shell. Setting the total charge per unit length to zero (to ensure zero net external electric field), we have:

\[
\lambda_{\text{wire}} + \lambda_{\text{shell}} = 0
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
-3.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C/m} + \sigma \cdot (2\pi \cdot 0.015) = 0
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \sigma \):

\[
\sigma = \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-9}}{2\pi \cdot 0.015}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
2\pi \cdot 0.015 \approx 0.094245 \, \mathrm{m}
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\sigma = \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-9}}{0.094245} \approx 3.819 \times 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{C/m^2}
\]

This value is approximately \( 3.8 \times 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \), which corresponds to option A.
