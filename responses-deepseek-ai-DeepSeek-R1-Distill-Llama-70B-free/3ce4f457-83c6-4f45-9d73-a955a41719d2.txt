Okay, so I've got this question about a Mother Goose nursery rhyme, and I need to figure out which child is full of woe. Hmm, let me think. I remember there's a rhyme that goes through the days of the week, assigning different traits to each day's child. 

Wait, the rhyme starts with Monday's child being fair of face, right? Like, "Monday's child is fair of face." Then Tuesday's is full of grace, I think. Or was it the other way around? No, I think Tuesday's is full of grace. 

So the question is asking which child is full of woe. I need to remember the exact line. Oh right, the rhyme goes: 

"Monday's child is fair of face,
Tuesday's child is full of grace,
Wednesday's child is full of woe,
Thursday's child has far to go,
Friday's child is loving and giving,
Saturday's child works hard for a living,
And the child that is born on the Sabbath day,
Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay."

Wait, so according to that, Wednesday's child is full of woe. So the answer should be Wednesday's child, which is option A. 

Let me double-check the options. Option A is Wednesday's child. Yes, that matches what I remember. So the correct answer is A.
