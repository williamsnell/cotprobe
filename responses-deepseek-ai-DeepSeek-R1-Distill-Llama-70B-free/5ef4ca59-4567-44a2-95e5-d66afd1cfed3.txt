Okay, so I have this question about Peter Singer and the two versions of a principle he considers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Singer's work, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that Singer is known for his work in ethics, especially related to animal rights and utilitarianism. The question is about two versions of a principle he considers. I think one of them is the "principle of utility" or something similar. Wait, or maybe it's the "principle of equal consideration of interests"? Or perhaps it's the distinction between a stronger and a weaker version of a moral principle.

Wait, Singer's book "Practical Ethics" comes to mind. In it, he discusses ethical principles, and I recall a specific discussion about the principle of beneficence and its stronger vs weaker forms. Oh right, the stronger version might require us to prevent evil or promote good wherever we can, even at some cost to ourselves, while the weaker version is more about not actively causing harm but not necessarily intervening to prevent it.

So the question is asking which option correctly describes Singer's stance on these two versions. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says he considers the stronger version correct. Option B says he considers the weaker version correct. Option C is about a third principle, which I don't think is the case. Option D says he argues the weaker is stronger, which is a bit confusing. Option E claims equivalence, which I don't recall. Option F says he supports both, but that seems unlikely. G suggests they're contradictory, but I think he sees them as different in degree. H says he doesn't distinguish, which I don't think is true because he does discuss both. I says both are incorrect, which might not be right because he probably supports one. J says he rejects both, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, in Singer's discussions, I think he leans towards a more demanding ethical view, which would align with the stronger version. Or does he? Let me think. The stronger version might be more in line with utilitarianism, where you have to maximize overall happiness. But wait, the principle of beneficence in its stronger form requires you to help others even if it's a significant sacrifice. Singer does discuss that, but I'm trying to remember if he endorses the stronger or weaker version.

Alternatively, I think Singer might argue that the weaker version is more defensible because the stronger could be too demanding. Or perhaps he presents both and supports one.

Wait, no, I think in his discussions about our obligations to help others, like in the case of the drowning child and donating to charity, he seems to support a stronger obligation. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe he presents both versions and discusses their implications without necessarily endorsing one as correct.

Wait, the question is about which version he considers correct. If the stronger version is more demanding, perhaps he supports that, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, he might think the weaker version is more realistic, but I'm trying to remember.

I think in the context of effective altruism, which he supports, the idea is to do as much good as possible, even if it requires significant personal sacrifice, which aligns with the stronger version. So perhaps he supports the stronger version.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The question is about the two versions of a principle Singer considers. One is the stronger, the other weaker.

In his book, Singer discusses the principle of equal consideration of interests, but that's more about treating similar interests equally, not about beneficence. Oh wait, maybe the two principles in question are the principle of utility (maximizing overall happiness) versus a weaker version, like the negative utilitarianism (minimizing suffering), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two versions are about our moral obligations to help others. The stronger version might say that if you can help without sacrificing something significant, you must. The weaker version might say you should help but it's not as strongly obligatory.

Wait, I think Singer argues in favor of the stronger version. He believes that if you can help someone without significant loss, you should. So that would mean option A is correct, that he considers the stronger version to be correct.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. I recall that in some discussions, he presents both versions and perhaps doesn't fully endorse the stronger, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe he doesn't take a stance but presents both, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct answer is A: he considers the stronger version to be correct.

The question revolves around Peter Singer's stance on two versions of a principle, specifically whether he considers the stronger version, the weaker version, or another perspective to be correct. Singer, known for his work in ethics and utilitarianism, discusses principles related to beneficence and moral obligations. The stronger version of the principle likely requires individuals to actively prevent harm or promote good, even at personal cost, while the weaker version may involve not causing harm but not necessarily intervening to prevent it.

Singer's work, particularly in "Practical Ethics," often emphasizes more demanding ethical views, aligning with the stronger version. His support for effective altruism, which advocates for maximizing good even if it requires significant personal sacrifice, further suggests his endorsement of the stronger version. While he acknowledges the implications of both versions, his arguments often lean toward the stronger principle as morally correct.

Thus, the most accurate answer is that Singer considers the stronger version to be correct.
