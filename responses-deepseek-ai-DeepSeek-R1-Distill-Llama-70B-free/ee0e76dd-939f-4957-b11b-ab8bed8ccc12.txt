Question:

2.3 g of ethanol (C_2H_5OH, molecular weight = 46 g/mole) is added to 500 g of water. Determine the molality of the resulting solution.

B: 0.05 molal
C: 0.4 molal
D: 0.2 molal
E: 0.1 molal
F: 0.5 molal
G: 0.25 molal
H: 0.15 molal
I: 0.3 molal
J: 0.35 molal

Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the molality of an ethanol solution. Hmm, I remember that molality is a measure of concentration based on moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Right, the formula is molality (m) = moles of solute / kg of solvent.

Wait, the problem says 2.3 grams of ethanol is added to 500 grams of water. Ethanol's molecular weight is 46 g/mol. So first, I need to find the moles of ethanol. Oh right, moles = mass / molar mass. So that's 2.3 g divided by 46 g/mol.

Let me do that calculation. 2.3 divided by 46... Hmm, 46 goes into 2.3 how many times? Well, 46 times 0.05 is 2.3 because 46*0.05 is 2.3. So the moles are 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. Let me double-check that math. 46 times 0.05 is indeed 2.3, so that's correct. So 0.05 moles of ethanol.

Now, the solvent is water, which is 500 grams. Oh, but since molality uses kilograms, I need to convert grams to kg. 500 grams is 0.5 kg. Oh wait, no, wait. 500 grams is 0.5 kg? Wait, no. Wait, 1000 grams is 1 kg, so 500 grams is 0.5 kg. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 500 grams is half a kilogram, yes.

So then, the molality is moles of ethanol divided by kg of water. So that's 0.05 moles divided by 0.5 kg.

0.05 divided by 0.5 equals... Let's see. 0.05 /0.5 is 0.1. Because 0.5 goes into 0.05 0.1 times. So the molality is 0.1 molal.

Now, looking at the options, E is 0.1 molal. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing—am I considering the solution's total mass correctly? Oh, no, molality uses only the solvent's mass, not the total solution. So yes, using 0.5 kg of water is correct.

So I think E is the correct answer.

To determine the molality of the ethanol solution, we use the formula for molality:

\[
\text{Molality (m)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}}
\]

1. **Calculate moles of ethanol (solute):**  
   The mass of ethanol is 2.3 g, and its molecular weight is 46 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of ethanol} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{2.3}{46} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Convert the mass of the solvent (water) to kilograms:**  
   The mass of water is 500 g, which is equivalent to:  
   \[
   500 \, \text{g} = 0.5 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate molality:**  
   Using the formula for molality:  
   \[
   m = \frac{\text{moles of ethanol}}{\text{kilograms of water}} = \frac{0.05}{0.5} = 0.1 \, \text{molal}
   \]

4. **Match the result to the options:**  
   The calculated molality is 0.1 molal, which corresponds to option **E**.
