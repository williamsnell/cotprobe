Alright, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Stone taking a loan to buy a new car. Let's see what it's asking. Okay, he's borrowing $4,000 for ninety days at a 6 percent discount. I need to find out how much he'll actually receive. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of financial calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Wait, so when you take a loan with a discount, that's different from interest, right? I remember that sometimes loans are quoted with a discount rate instead of an interest rate. The discount is like the amount you pay upfront, so the borrower receives less than the face value. Oh right, so the discount is subtracted from the principal amount.

So the formula for the present value, which is what he actually receives, is the face value minus the discount. But I'm a bit confused about how the discount is calculated. Oh wait, discount is calculated as the principal multiplied by the rate multiplied by the time. But wait, time is in years usually for these formulas, isn't it? So I need to convert the ninety days into a fraction of a year.

Let me jot this down. The principal (P) is $4,000. The discount rate (r) is 6%, or 0.06. The time (t) is 90 days. Since the standard is 360 days a year for some calculations, right? So 90 days is 90/360, which simplifies to 1/4 of a year, or 0.25 years.

So the discount amount is P * r * t. Plugging in the numbers: 4000 * 0.06 * 0.25. Let me calculate that. 4000 times 0.06 is 240, right? Then 240 times 0.25 is 60. So the discount is $60.

Wait, so the present value (PV) that Mr. Stone actually receives is the principal minus the discount. So PV = 4000 - 60 = $3940. Let me check the options. Looking back, option J is $3,940. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, am I mixing up simple interest and discount? Oh wait, no, because the discount method is different. Sometimes, the interest is added to the principal, but in discount, it's subtracted upfront. So yes, the calculation seems right.

To determine how much Mr. Stone will actually receive from his loan, we need to calculate the present value of the loan after applying the discount. The loan terms are as follows:

- **Principal (P):** $4,000  
- **Discount Rate (r):** 6% (or 0.06)  
- **Time (t):** 90 days (which is 90/360 = 0.25 years).  

The discount amount is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{Discount} = P \times r \times t  
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Discount} = 4000 \times 0.06 \times 0.25 = 60  
\]  

The present value (PV), which is the amount Mr. Stone will actually receive, is the principal minus the discount:  
\[
PV = P - \text{Discount} = 4000 - 60 = 3940  
\]  

Thus, Mr. Stone will receive **$3,940**. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is **J: $3,940**.
