Okay, so I'm trying to solve this clock problem where John leaves home after 6 p.m. and returns before 7 p.m. The angle between the minute and hour hands is 110 degrees both when he leaves and returns. He was away for more than five minutes, and I need to find out exactly how many minutes he was gone. The options are A through J, which are numbers from 35 to 45 approximately.

Hmm, I remember that the angle between the clock hands can be calculated with a formula. Let me think. The formula for the angle between the hour and minute hands at a given time H:M is |30H - 5.5M| degrees. Right, because the hour hand moves at 0.5 degrees per minute (since 30 degrees per hour) and the minute hand at 6 degrees per minute. So the formula accounts for both movements.

So when John leaves, the time is between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. Let's denote the time he left as 6:M1 and the time he returned as 6:M2, where M1 and M2 are the minutes past 6 o'clock.

The angle when he leaves is 110 degrees. So plugging into the formula, |30*6 - 5.5*M1| = 110. 30*6 is 180, so |180 -5.5M1| =110.

This gives two possibilities because the absolute value can be positive or negative. So either 180 -5.5M1 =110 or 180 -5.5M1 =-110.

Let me solve the first case: 180 -5.5M1 =110 → 5.5M1=70 → M1=70/5.5 → let's calculate that. 70 divided by 5.5 is the same as 700/55, which is 12.7272... So approximately 12.73 minutes. So about 6:12 and 44 seconds.

Second case: 180 -5.5M1 =-110 → 5.5M1=290 → M1=290/5.5. Let's see, 290 divided by 5.5 is 52.7272... Wait, but that can't be right because M1 is the minutes past 6, and if it's 52 minutes, that would be almost 6:53. But wait, the problem says he returned before 7 p.m., so the departure could be at 6:12 something and the return at 6:52 something, but wait, how much time would that be?

Wait, but when he returns, the angle is also 110 degrees. So the same formula applies for M2. So maybe the times when the angle is 110 degrees are when the minute hand is ahead or behind the hour hand by 110 degrees.

Wait, but let's think about the possible times. Between 6:00 and 7:00, how many times does the angle between the hands equal 110 degrees? I think it happens twice. Once when the minute hand is moving away from the hour hand after 6:00, and then again when it's approaching from the other side.

Wait, actually, at 6:00, the hour hand is at 180 degrees, the minute at 0. As time passes, the minute hand moves faster than the hour. So the angle increases until the minute hand is ahead of the hour by 110 degrees. Then, as the minute hand continues moving, the angle between them starts to decrease. But later, the minute hand might lap the hour hand again, but wait, between 6 and 7, the minute hand can't lap the hour hand because that happens once every hour (roughly), so between 6 and 7, it's only moving from 0 to 360, but the hour hand is moving from 180 to 210 (30 degrees per hour). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the two instances when the angle is 110 degrees are when the minute hand is ahead of the hour hand by 110 degrees, and when it's behind by 110 degrees. Because the minute hand moves faster, so after 6:00, the minute hand catches up and overtakes the hour hand, creating angles on both sides.

So, for the first time after 6:00, the minute hand is ahead, causing the angle to be 110 degrees, and then later, perhaps when the minute hand is moving away in the other direction, the angle is again 110 degrees.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The formula gives the absolute angle, so the minute hand could be either ahead or behind by that angle. So for any given time, the angle is the minimum between the two possibilities, but in this problem, the angle is exactly 110 degrees, so it could be either case.

So, when John leaves, the angle is 110 degrees. Then when he returns, the angle is again 110 degrees, but it's a different time. So the departure and return times are two different times when the angle is 110 degrees between 6:00 and 7:00.

Wait, but wait, between 6:00 and 7:00, how many times does the angle between the hands equal 110 degrees? It should be twice, right? So the first time after 6:00 when the minute hand is ahead, and then again when it's behind, but wait, after 6:00, the minute hand is behind at 6:00 (since it's at 12, which is 0 degrees, and the hour is at 180). So the minute hand is behind the hour hand at 6:00. As time moves forward, the minute hand moves faster, so the angle between them decreases until they overlap (at some point after 6:00), and then the minute hand moves ahead, increasing the angle beyond that.

Wait, perhaps the times when the angle is 110 degrees are when the minute hand is approaching from behind and then when it's moving away ahead.

Wait, no, at 6:00, the angle is 180 degrees. Then as the minute hand moves, the angle decreases. It reaches 0 degrees when they overlap, then the minute hand moves ahead, and the angle increases again.

So the angle will be 110 degrees twice: once when the minute hand is approaching from behind (angle decreasing from 180 to 0), and once when it's moving away ahead (angle increasing from 0 to 180 again).

Wait, but that can't be, because after 6:00, the minute hand is behind. So the first time the angle is 110 degrees is when the minute hand is still behind, and the angle is 110 degrees (because it's decreased from 180). Then, after they overlap, the minute hand is ahead, and the angle increases to 110 degrees again.

So that's two times between 6:00 and 7:00 when the angle is 110 degrees. So John left at one of these times and returned at the other.

So the departure time is the first occurrence after 6:00, and the return time is the second occurrence.

Now, I need to calculate the times when the angle is 110 degrees.

So using the formula:

|180 -5.5M| =110.

So two cases:

Case 1: 180 -5.5M =110 → 5.5M=70 → M=70/5.5 = 12.7272... So 12 minutes and about 44 seconds (since 0.7272 *60 ≈43.636 seconds). So 6:12:44 approximately.

Case 2: 180 -5.5M =-110 → 5.5M=290 → M=290/5.5 = 52.7272... So 52 minutes and about 44 seconds. 6:52:44.

Wait, but between 6:00 and 7:00, the time can't be 6:52 because that's within the hour. So the two times when the angle is 110 degrees are approximately 6:12:44 and 6:52:44.

So John left home at 6:12:44 and returned at 6:52:44, or vice versa. Wait, but he left after 6 p.m. and returned before 7 p.m., so both times are valid.

Wait, but wait, the departure is when he leaves, so he left at the first occurrence, 6:12:44, and returned at the second occurrence, 6:52:44.

So the time he was away is the difference between these two times. Let's compute that.

From 6:12:44 to 6:52:44 is exactly 40 minutes. Wait, 52 minus 12 is 40 minutes. But wait, let me double-check. 52.7272 minus 12.7272 is 40 minutes exactly. So 40 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes when the times are on either side of the hour, it's easy to miscalculate.

Wait, 52.7272 minutes is 52 minutes and about 44 seconds. 12.7272 is 12 minutes and 44 seconds. So subtracting, 52.7272 -12.7272 =40 minutes exactly. So the time he was away is 40 minutes.

Looking at the options, option H is 40. So the answer should be H.

But wait, the question says he left home for more than five minutes, which is true as 40 is more than five. So the correct answer is H:40.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock at time \( H:M \):

\[
\text{Angle} = |30H - 5.5M|
\]

Here, \( H = 6 \) (since the events occur between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m.), and the angle is given as \( 110^\circ \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
|180 - 5.5M| = 110
\]

This gives two cases:

1. \( 180 - 5.5M = 110 \)
2. \( 180 - 5.5M = -110 \)

**Case 1:**  
\[
180 - 5.5M = 110 \implies 5.5M = 70 \implies M = \frac{70}{5.5} \approx 12.7272
\]  
This corresponds to approximately 6:12:44 (6 hours, 12 minutes, and 44 seconds).

**Case 2:**  
\[
180 - 5.5M = -110 \implies 5.5M = 290 \implies M = \frac{290}{5.5} \approx 52.7272
\]  
This corresponds to approximately 6:52:44 (6 hours, 52 minutes, and 44 seconds).

The two times when the angle is \( 110^\circ \) are approximately 6:12:44 and 6:52:44. John left home at the earlier time (6:12:44) and returned at the later time (6:52:44). The duration he was away is the difference between these two times:

\[
52.7272 - 12.7272 = 40 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Thus, John was away for **40 minutes**, which matches option **H**.
