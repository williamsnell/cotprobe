The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A woman owned land in fee simple absolute. The woman conveyed the land to a friend "for life," and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?

Options:

A: The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.
B: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.
C: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable and her will transferred her entire estate.
D: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because the quitclaim deed from the daughter transferred any interest she might have had in the land.
E: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a contingent remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
F: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
G: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor.
H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.
I: The friend has a life estate and the local charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will transferred her entire estate.
J: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will devised her entire estate to a local charity.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

Alright, the scenario is about a woman who owns land in fee simple absolute. She conveys this land to a friend "for life," and then when the friend dies, it's supposed to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." So, that's a bit about the initial conveyance.

Next, the neighbor dies. She had a will that left her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. So, the neighbor didn't have any other children, I guess, since the daughter is the only heir.

Then, a year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed, conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. So, the daughter is giving up any possible claim she had to the friend.

The question is about who has what interest in the land now. The options are A through J, each with different possible interests.

The jurisdiction follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities without any modifications, and no other statutes apply here.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

First, the initial conveyance by the woman: she gave the land to her friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So, in property terms, the friend has a life estate, and the neighbor has a remainder. The remainder would be a vested remainder because it's given to the neighbor and her heirs, meaning it's a fee simple. But wait, noâ€”wait, the wording is "to the neighbor and her heirs." So that's a fee simple absolute, right? Because "to A and her heirs" is fee simple. So the neighbor would have a vested remainder in fee simple.

But wait, the conveyance is from the woman to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So, the friend has a life estate, and the neighbor has a vested remainder in fee simple.

But then the neighbor dies. She dies and her will leaves everything to charity. So, the neighbor's property, including her interest in the land, goes to the charity. But what was her interest at the time of her death?

Wait, at the time the neighbor received the vested remainder, she had a future interest in the land. So, she had a vested remainder in fee simple, which is an interest that can be devised or inherited. So when she died, her will controls where that interest goes. So the charity would take her vested remainder.

But wait, the daughter, who would have been the heir if the neighbor died intestate, later executed a quitclaim deed to the friend. So, what's the effect of that?

Wait, but the neighbor died testate, leaving everything to the charity. So, the charity now holds the vested remainder. But the daughter, as the only heir, would have taken the neighbor's property if there was no will. But since there was a will, the charity gets it.

So, the daughter's interest would have been if the neighbor had died intestate, but since she died testate, the daughter doesn't inherit. So the daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend is probably irrelevant because she had no interest to convey. So she's conveying nothing.

Wait, but let's think again. The initial conveyance was "to friend for life, then to neighbor and her heirs." So, when the friend dies, the land goes to the neighbor's estate. But the neighbor predeceased the friend? Wait, no, the friend is still alive, I think. Because the question says that after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed a year later.

Wait, the timeline is: the woman conveys to the friend for life, then to neighbor and her heirs. Then, the neighbor dies, and then the friend is still alive because the daughter conveys to the friend a year after the neighbor's death.

Wait, so the friend is still alive, so the life estate is still in effect. The neighbor died, so her vested remainder would pass according to her will. So, the charity now holds the vested remainder in fee simple.

So, the current interests are: friend has a life estate, and upon his death, the land goes to the charity. So, the friend's life estate is followed by the charity's vested remainder.

But wait, what about the Rule Against Perpetuities? Because in the initial conveyance, the remainder to the neighbor and her heirs is vested, so it's okay. The Rule Against Perpetuities doesn't apply here because the vested remainder is certain to vest, if at all, within the lifetime of the relevant people. So, the neighbor's vested remainder is fine.

So, the options: looking at the choices, option H says the friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder because the neighbor's interest was devisable.

Option C says the friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder, but that's not right because the neighbor's interest was vested, so when she died, it went to the charity through the will, making the charity's interest vested.

Wait, but what about the daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend? The daughter had no interest because the neighbor died testate, so her interest went to the charity, not the daughter. Therefore, the daughter's quitclaim deed had nothing to convey, so it doesn't affect the ownership.

So, the correct situation is that the friend has a life estate, and the charity has a vested remainder in fee simple.

Looking back at the options:

Option H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: Friend has life estate, woman has reversion. No, because the woman's conveyance was to friend for life, then to neighbor and her heirs. So the woman's interest ended there; she doesn't have a reversion. The reversion would be after the remainder, but since the remainder is in fee, the woman doesn't have a reversion.

Option B: Friend has fee simple absolute because of the daughter's quitclaim. No, because the friend only has a life estate, and the daughter had nothing to convey.

Option C: Friend has life estate, charity has contingent remainder. No, because the remainder was vested in the neighbor, then passed to the charity, so it's vested.

Option D: Friend has fee simple because of quitclaim. No, same as B.

Option E: Friend has life estate, daughter has contingent. No, because daughter had no interest.

Option F: Friend has life estate, daughter has vested remainder. No, same as E.

Option G: Neighbor has vested remainder. But neighbor died, so her interest passed to charity.

Option I: Charity has contingent remainder. No, it's vested.

Option J: Neighbor has contingent. No, she had a vested remainder.

So yes, the correct answer is H.
</think>

The woman initially conveyed the land to her friend for life, giving the friend a life estate. The remainder was conveyed to the neighbor "and her heirs," creating a vested remainder in fee simple for the neighbor. When the neighbor died, her vested remainder passed according to her will, which devised her entire estate to the local charity. Therefore, the charity now holds the vested remainder in fee simple.

The daughter, who would have inherited the neighbor's interest if the neighbor had died intestate, had no interest to convey because the neighbor died testate. As a result, the daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend had no legal effect.

The Rule Against Perpetuities does not apply here because the remainder to the neighbor was vested and certain to vest within the relevant period. Thus, the current interests in the land are as follows: the friend has a life estate, and the charity has a vested remainder in fee simple.

Option H correctly reflects this outcome.
