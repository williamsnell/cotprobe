Okay, so I've got this question here about concave mirrors, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again. It says the image produced by a concave mirror is at -16.2 meters, and the magnification is 1.79. I need to find the object distance. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in optics, the sign conventions are important. For concave mirrors, the focal length is positive. Oh right, and the image distance (where the image is formed) is usually positive if it's real, but wait, wait. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think: for concave mirrors, when the image is in front of the mirror (real image), the image distance is positive. But wait, here the image distance is given as -16.2 m. That doesn't make sense because a concave mirror can't produce a virtual image unless the object is within the focal length. Oh wait, no, wait—if the image is virtual, it's behind the mirror, so the image distance would be negative. So if the image distance is -16.2 m, that means it's a virtual image located behind the mirror.

Wait, but concave mirrors can only form real images when the object is beyond the focal point, right? If the object is between the focal point and the mirror, the image is virtual and upright, and located behind the mirror. So in that case, the image distance (s') would be negative, which matches the given value here.

So I think the formula I need to use is the mirror equation, which is 1/f = 1/s' + 1/s, where s is the object distance. Also, magnification m is given by m = -s'/s.

Wait, let me get the signs straight. The mirror is concave, so f is positive. The image distance s' is given as -16.2 m, which is negative, meaning it's a virtual image. The magnification m is 1.79. Since m is positive, that suggests that the image is upright. Which aligns with the situation where the object is inside the focal length, producing a virtual, upright image.

So the magnification formula is m = -s'/s. I can plug in the values to find s.

Wait, m is 1.79. So:

m = -s' / s → 1.79 = -(-16.2) / s → 1.79 = 16.2 / s → solving for s: s = 16.2 / 1.79.

Let me compute that. 16.2 divided by 1.79. Hmm. Let me approximate. 1.79 times 9 is 16.11, because 1.79 *9 = (1*9)+(0.79*9)=9 +7.11=16.11. So 1.79 *9 = ~16.11. So 16.2 is a little more than 16.11. So 16.2 /1.79 is approximately 9.05. So s ≈9.05 meters.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option B is 9.05. So would that be the answer?

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me calculate it more accurately.

16.2 divided by 1.79:

Let me compute 1.79 × 9 = 16.11 as before. 16.2 -16.11=0.09. So 0.09 left. So 0.09 /1.79 is approximately 0.05. So total is 9.05. So s is approximately 9.05 meters, which is option B.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't flip any signs. The magnification formula is m = -s'/s. So s' is -16.2, so substituting:

m = -(s')/s → 1.79 = -(-16.2)/s → 1.79 = 16.2/s → s=16.2/1.79=9.05. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the mirror equation to verify. The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/s' + 1/s.

We have s' = -16.2 m, s = 9.05 m (from above). So 1/f = (1/(-16.2)) + (1/9.05).

Calculating that: 1/(-16.2) is approximately -0.0617, and 1/9.05 is approximately 0.1105. Adding them gives (-0.0617) + 0.1105 = 0.0488. So 1/f is about 0.0488, so f ≈ 20.51 m? Wait, wait, that seems really large for a mirror's focal length. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, that can't be right. Because a 20-meter focal length is way too long for typical concave mirrors. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/(-16.2) and 1/9.05 more accurately.

1/16.2 is approximately 0.061728. So 1/(-16.2) is -0.061728.

1/9.05: Let's compute 9 × 1 =9, 0.05 ×1=0.05. Wait, alternatively, 9.05 is 905/100, so 1/9.05 is 100/905. Let me compute 100 ÷ 905. 905 ×0.11 is 99.55, so 0.11 is 99.55. So 0.11 is 99.55. So 100 ÷ 905 is 0.1105.

So adding: -0.061728 + 0.1105 = 0.048772.

So 1/f ≈0.048772 → f≈20.5 meters? Hmm, but that's a very large focal length. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, but the mirror equation and magnification are correct. Maybe my assumption about the image distance is wrong. Wait, wait—no, the image distance is given as -16.2m, which according to the conventions, would mean it's a virtual image behind the mirror.

Wait, but if the object is placed beyond the focal point, the image is real, in front of the mirror, and s' is positive. If the object is between the focal point and the mirror, the image is virtual, behind, so s' is negative. So the magnification here is positive, which makes sense because the image is upright.

Wait, but if I get a focal length of 20.5 meters from this, that's really long. I wonder if I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the given image distance is correct, but let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should instead use the mirror equation in terms of the magnification. I think the magnification m is -s'/s, which we used. Then from that, s' = -m s. Alternatively, maybe I should express everything in terms of s and plug into the mirror equation.

So let's try that approach. So from magnification, m = -s'/s → s' = -m s.

Substituting into mirror equation:

1/f = 1/s' + 1/s = 1/(-m s) + 1/s = [ -1/(m s) ) + 1/s ] = [ ( -1/m + 1 ) / s ].

So 1/f = ( (1 - (1/m) ) / s ).

Hmm, maybe that's a better approach. Let's compute this.

Given m = 1.79, so 1/m is approximately 0.5587.

1 - (1/m) = 1 - 0.5587 = 0.4413.

So 1/f = 0.4413 / s → f = s / 0.4413.

Wait, but from earlier, we have s =9.05 m. So f would be 9.05 / 0.4413 ≈ 20.5 m, same as before. So that seems consistent. So maybe it's correct, even though the focal length is large.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps I can calculate the focal length using the given data and then find the object distance.

Wait, but I think the calculation is correct. So the object distance is approximately 9.05 m, which is option B. So I think that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we use the magnification formula for mirrors:

\[
m = -\frac{s'}{s}
\]

where \( m \) is the magnification, \( s' \) is the image distance, and \( s \) is the object distance. The problem states that \( m = 1.79 \) and \( s' = -16.2 \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
1.79 = -\frac{-16.2}{s}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
1.79 = \frac{16.2}{s} \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{16.2}{1.79}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
s \approx 9.05 \, \text{m}
\]

Thus, the object distance is approximately \( 9.05 \, \text{m} \). To verify, we can use the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{s'} + \frac{1}{s}
\]

Substituting \( s' = -16.2 \, \text{m} \) and \( s = 9.05 \, \text{m} \):

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{-16.2} + \frac{1}{9.05}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\frac{1}{-16.2} \approx -0.0617, \quad \frac{1}{9.05} \approx 0.1105
\]

Adding these:

\[
\frac{1}{f} \approx -0.0617 + 0.1105 = 0.0488 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f \approx 20.5 \, \text{m}
\]

This focal length is consistent with the given data. Therefore, the object distance is \( 9.05 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option B.
