Okay, so I've got this question here about the World Bank's findings in 1997. The question is asking about the fraction of the world’s population living in low and lower-middle income countries, which are defined as countries with per capita incomes of $1230 or less. The options are from A to J, with percentages ranging from 25% up to 80%.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure, but I remember that a significant portion of the world's population was in lower-income countries around that time. Let me think. I recall that terms like 'low-income' and 'lower-middle-income' are categories the World Bank uses. Low-income countries are typically those with a GNI per capita below a certain threshold, which I think was around $700 or so in the mid-90s. Lower-middle might be just a step above that.

So, adding low and lower-middle would include a lot of countries, especially in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of East Asia. I think in the 90s, a lot of the world's population was in these regions. For instance, countries like India, China were in lower-middle or maybe even low-income categories back then. Wait, China's economy was growing, but per capita income might still have been low in 1997.

I'm trying to remember any specific data points. I think in 2000, the World Bank reported that around 2.8 billion people lived in low-income countries, which was about 47% of the world's population. But wait, that was low-income only. The question is about low plus lower-middle. So the percentage would be higher than that.

Wait, but the question is from 1997, so maybe a bit earlier. Let me see. The world population in 1997 was roughly 5.9 billion. If 2.8 billion were in low-income countries, that's about 47%, but if lower-middle adds another, say, 20-30%, then the total could be around 70% or so.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the numbers. Maybe the combined percentage was around 75% or so. But I'm not sure. Another approach: considering the World Bank's classifications, low-income was below $700, lower-middle might be up to around $2000. But in 1997, the exact cutoff was $1230, as per the question.

So, the fraction would include all people in countries below that. But I'm not exactly certain about the exact percentage. I think in the mid-90s, around 80% of the world's population was in low and lower-middle income countries. That seems high, but considering that countries like China and India were still in those categories and had large populations, it's possible.

Wait, but if it's 80%, that's option I. But I'm not entirely confident. Another thought: the World Bank's data from around that time might have shown that about 57% of the world's population was in low-income countries, and adding lower-middle would bring it up. But I'm not sure about the exact split.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is around 75%, which would be option H. But I'm not certain. Wait, another angle: the question says "low and lower-middle income countries". In the World Bank's categories, low-income is below $700, lower-middle might be $700 to $1230. So the cutoff in the question is $1230, so it includes both low and lower-middle. 

I've heard that in the 90s, about 80% of the population lived in these countries. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 55%, which is option F. Or perhaps 60%, option G.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. In 1997, the world's population was about 5.9 billion. If the fraction was 75%, that's 4.4 billion people. Does that sound right? I think China and India alone accounted for around 2 billion people in the mid-90s. If other countries in similar categories add another billion, that brings it to 3 billion. Hmm, but 75% of 5.9 is 4.4, which would require more people.

Alternatively, maybe the number was around 60%. But I'm not certain. Another thought: I remember reading that in 2000, about 56% of the world's population lived in low-income countries, and including lower-middle would bring it to around 80%. But the question is for 1997.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 75%, which is option H. Or maybe 80%, option I. I'm a bit torn between these two. But I think 75% is more likely because including lower-middle might add a significant chunk beyond low-income's 47%.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 75%, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to make an educated guess based on what I remember.

The question asks about the fraction of the world’s population living in low and lower-middle income countries in 1997, defined as countries with per capita incomes of $1230 or less. These categories include regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and parts of East Asia, where countries like India and China were classified at the time. 

In the mid-1990s, the world population was approximately 5.9 billion. Low-income countries alone accounted for about 47% of the global population, or around 2.8 billion people. When including lower-middle-income countries, the percentage would be significantly higher. Considering the large populations of countries like China and India, which fell into these categories, it is reasonable to estimate that the combined fraction of the population in low and lower-middle-income countries was around 75%. 

Thus, the most plausible answer is **75%**, corresponding to option H.
