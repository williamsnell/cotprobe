Question:

A 57-year-old man receives radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?

Options:

A: Metaphase
B: G1
C: Prophase
D: G0
E: Prometaphase
F: S phase
G: Anaphase
H: M
I: Telophase
J: G2

Okay, so I've got this question about cell cycle phases and p53 gene mutations. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says a 57-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung received radiation therapy, but the tumor kept growing and he died six months later. The tumor cells have a point mutation in the p53 gene, making the product inactive. I need to figure out which cell cycle phase's arrest is defective here.

Wait, I remember that p53 is a tumor suppressor gene. When it's mutated, it can't function properly. Normally, p53 plays a big role in the cell cycle. Oh right, when there's DNA damage, p53 steps in to either repair it or, if it's too bad, trigger apoptosis.

So p53 is involved in the cell cycle checkpoints. Which checkpoint specifically? I think the G1 checkpoint. Because the G1 phase is where the cell decides whether to proceed with division or not. If DNA damage is detected, p53 causes the cell cycle to arrest at G1, giving time for repairs. If it can't repair, then apoptosis happens.

But in this case, the p53 is inactive. So the cell can't arrest at G1. That means even if there's DNA damage—like from radiation—the cell doesn't stop. It might proceed into S phase and beyond, even with damaged DNA. This would lead to uncontrolled cell division, hence the tumor growing despite therapy.

Radiation therapy causes DNA damage. Normally, that would trigger cell cycle arrest, allowing for repair or apoptosis. But if p53 is inactive, the cells can't arrest. So they keep dividing, leading to tumor progression.

So the defect is in the G1 phase arrest. Looking at the options, option B is G1, so that should be the answer.

The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in the cell cycle, particularly at the G1 checkpoint. When DNA damage is detected, p53 typically halts the cell cycle at the G1 phase to allow for repair or, if the damage is irreparable, to trigger apoptosis. In this case, the tumor cells have a mutation in the p53 gene, rendering it inactive. As a result, the cells cannot arrest at the G1 phase, even in the presence of DNA damage caused by radiation therapy. This inability to arrest leads to uncontrolled cell division and tumor progression, despite the treatment. Therefore, the defect lies in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

The correct answer is **B**.
