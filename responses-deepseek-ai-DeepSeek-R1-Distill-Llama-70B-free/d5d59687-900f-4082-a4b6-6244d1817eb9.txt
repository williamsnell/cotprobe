Okay, so I have this question about which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about what I know regarding organ energy use.

I remember that the brain is really energy-hungry. Like, it's a small organ but uses a lot of energy. So the brain probably has a high energy expenditure per kg. But the question is about the lowest, so the brain is probably not the answer.

Then there's the kidney. Kidneys are working all the time filtering blood, so they must use a decent amount of energy. But I'm not sure how they compare to others.

The liver does a lot of metabolic work, detoxification, and such. I think the liver is one of the heavier organs and has high energy needs, but again, not sure if it's the highest.

Skeletal muscle... Wait, when you're active, muscles use a lot of energy, but when at rest, maybe not so much. Oh wait, the question is about per unit of body mass. So even though muscles are a big part of body mass, their energy use per kg might be lower compared to organs like the brain or liver.

Wait, I think that the brain has the highest energy expenditure per kg. Then, organs like the liver, kidneys, and heart follow. Skeletal muscle, especially at rest, probably has a lower rate. But wait, when active, muscles use a lot, but the question is about per unit mass regardless of activity state. Or is it considering the resting metabolic rate?

I remember that at rest, organs like the liver, brain, kidneys, and heart have higher metabolic rates than muscles. So per kg, skeletal muscle doesn't use as much energy as these organs. So which of these options has the lowest?

Looking at the options, the choices are brain, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle.

So if I'm considering per kg energy expenditure:

Brain is very high. Kidneys and liver are also high. Skeletal muscle, which is a larger portion of the body, but each kg of it doesn't burn as much energy as the other organs.

So the organ with the lowest energy expenditure per kg would be skeletal muscle.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. I think the liver might actually have a higher rate than the kidneys. Let me think again. The liver is involved in a lot of processesâ€”detox, metabolism, production of bile, etc. So it's a busy organ. The kidneys are also filtering blood continuously.

But regarding their energy expenditure per unit mass, it's possible that skeletal muscle is lower than all of them. Because when you're resting, your muscles aren't active, so their energy use per kg is less.

So the question is asking which organ has the lowest. The options are the four I mentioned. So the answer should be D: Skeletal Muscle.

To determine which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass, we need to evaluate the metabolic activity of each option:

- **Brain**: The brain is highly energy-intensive, accounting for a significant portion of energy expenditure relative to its mass. It is unlikely to have the lowest energy expenditure per kg.
- **Kidney**: Kidneys are metabolically active, continuously filtering blood, which requires substantial energy. However, their energy expenditure per kg is likely higher than that of skeletal muscle.
- **Liver**: The liver performs numerous critical functions, including detoxification and metabolism, making it another high-energy organ. Its energy expenditure per kg is also likely higher than skeletal muscle.
- **Skeletal Muscle**: While skeletal muscle can use a lot of energy during activity, at rest, its energy expenditure per kg is relatively low compared to organs like the brain, liver, and kidneys.

Given this analysis, skeletal muscle has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass among the options provided.
