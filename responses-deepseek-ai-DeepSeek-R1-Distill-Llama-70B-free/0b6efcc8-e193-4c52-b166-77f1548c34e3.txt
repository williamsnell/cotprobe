Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the internal energy change for a reaction. Hmm.

The reaction given is Cl2(g) + (7/2)O2(g) → Cl2O7(g) at 25°C. They mentioned that the gases are ideal. Oh right, for ideal gases, the change in internal energy depends only on temperature, not pressure or volume. But wait, what's the formula again? I think the change in internal energy (ΔU) is related to the change in enthalpy (ΔH) by the equation ΔU = ΔH - ΔnRT, where Δn is the change in moles of gas.

Wait, let me make sure. Oh right, ΔH = q_p (heat at constant pressure), and for ideal gases, ΔU is ΔH minus the work done, which is ΔnRT. So yes, ΔU = ΔH - ΔnRT.

So first, I need to find Δn, the change in moles of gas in the reaction. Let's look at the reaction:

Cl2(g) + (7/2)O2(g) → Cl2O7(g)

On the reactant side, I have 1 mole of Cl2 and 7/2 moles of O2. So total moles of reactant gases = 1 + 3.5 = 4.5 moles.

On the product side, only 1 mole of Cl2O7(g). So the moles go from 4.5 to 1. So Δn is 1 - 4.5 = -3.5 moles.

Wait, wait, no. Δn is moles of gaseous products minus moles of gaseous reactants. Because in the reaction, the stoichiometric coefficients are for the moles. So in this case, moles of gas on product side is 1, reactant side is 1 + 3.5 =4.5. So Δn = 1 - 4.5 = -3.5.

But wait, wait. The reaction is: 1 Cl2 + 3.5 O2 → 1 Cl2O7.

So moles of gas before reaction: 1 + 3.5 =4.5.

Moles after: 1.

So Δn = (moles products) - (moles reactants) = 1 -4.5 = -3.5.

Okay, so Δn is -3.5 moles.

Now, the given ΔH is the enthalpy of formation of Cl2O7(g), which is 63.4 kcal/mol. Oh wait, but wait, the reaction is as written, so that's the ΔH for the reaction. Because enthalpy of formation is the ΔH when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So in this reaction, Cl2 and O2 are the elements, so the ΔH for the reaction is 63.4 kcal/mol.

Wait, the question says "enthalpy, ΔH, for the formation of Cl2O7(g) is 63.4 kcal mol^-1". So the reaction is just Cl2 + (7/2) O2 → Cl2O7, and ΔH is +63.4 kcal/mol. So ΔH is positive, meaning it's endothermic.

Wait, but wait, when they say ΔH is 63.4 kcal per mole, so for the reaction as written, the ΔH would be 63.4 kcal, because it's the formation of 1 mole of Cl2O7.

So now, I can compute ΔU as ΔH - ΔnRT. But wait, the units. The ΔH is in kcal, and R is usually in J or cal.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K, but sometimes 8.314 can be approximated as 8.31 for calculations. Alternatively, 8.314 J/(mol·K) is 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K). Or 8.314×10^3 cal/(mol·K) is 8314 cal/(mol·K), but wait, 1 cal is 4.184 J, so perhaps it's easier to convert units.

Wait, since the ΔH is in kcal, maybe I can use R in cal/(mol·K). Let me check. So R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is 8.314 / 4184 cal/(mol·K), because 1 cal is about 4.184 J. Let me compute that: 8.314 / 4184 ≈ 0.001987 cal/(mol·K). So approximately 1.987 cal/(mol·K) ×10^-3.

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 8.314 J/(mol·K) is 8.314 /4.184 cal/(mol·K) ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K). So yes, R ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

But wait, since ΔH is in kcal, perhaps it's better to convert R into kcal/(mol·K). Because 1 kcal is 1000 cal. So R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K) = 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K).

So now, the temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K.

So putting it all together:

ΔU = ΔH - Δn × R × T.

But wait, ΔH is given as 63.4 kcal/mol. So plug in the numbers.

Δn is -3.5, R is 0.001987 kcal/(mol·K), T is 298 K.

ΔU = 63.4 - (-3.5) * 0.001987 * 298.

Wait, no, because Δn is moles of gas produced minus reactant. So in this case, Δn = 1 -4.5 = -3.5.

Wait, no, that's correct. So the calculation would be:

ΔU = 63.4 kcal/mol - (Δn) * R * T.

Wait, wait, the formula is ΔU = ΔH - (Δn)RT. Or is it Δn multiplied by RT?

Wait, let me think. The formula is ΔU = ΔH - (Δn) RT.

But what is Δn again? It's the moles of gas products minus moles of gas reactants. So in this case, 1 - (1 + 7/2) = 1 - 4.5 = -3.5.

So that's correct.

So:

ΔU = 63.4 kcal/mol - (-3.5) * (0.001987 kcal/mol·K) * 298 K.

Wait, let's compute that term:

(-3.5) * 0.001987 * 298.

Wait, negatives can be tricky. Wait, -3.5 multiplied by 0.001987 is approximately:

-3.5 * 0.001987 ≈ -0.0069495. Then multiply by 298: 

-0.0069495 * 298 ≈ -2.072 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait: let me compute it step by step.

3.5 * 0.001987 = 0.0069495.

So 3.5 * 0.001987 * 298 = 0.0069495 * 298 ≈ 2.072.

But since it's -3.5, it's -0.0069495 * 298 = -2.072.

Wait, so the term is (Δn)*R*T = (-3.5)*0.001987*298 ≈ -2.072 kcal/mol.

So putting back into the equation:

ΔU = 63.4 - (-2.072) = 63.4 + 2.072 = 65.472 kcal/mol.

Wait, that would make ΔU positive. But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the formula is ΔU = ΔH - (Δn_gas) RT.

So Δn is -3.5. So substituting:

ΔU = 63.4 - (-3.5 * 0.001987 * 298)

Which is 63.4 + (3.5 * 0.001987 * 298)

Compute 3.5 * 0.001987 = 0.0069495.

Multiply by 298: 0.0069495 * 298 = approx 2.072.

So 63.4 + 2.072 = 65.472 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the internal energy change for the reaction. So that's 65.472 kcal per mole.

But wait, the options are in kJ. So I need to convert kcal to kJ.

Because 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 65.472 kcal * 4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

65.472 * 4.184 ≈ ?

Let me break it down:

65 *4 =260.

65 *0.184 = 11.96.

0.472 *4 =1.888.

0.472 *0.184 ≈ 0.0868.

So adding all:

260 +11.96 = 271.96.

1.888 +0.0868=1.9748.

Total ≈ 271.96 +1.9748 ≈ 273.9348 kJ.

Looking at the options, option J is 273.94 kJ. So that seems to match.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, Δn = -3.5.

So (Δn) * R * T = (-3.5) * 0.001987 *298 = let me compute it step by step.

3.5 * 0.001987 = 0.0069495.

Multiply by 298: 0.0069495 * 298.

Let me compute 0.0069495 * 300 = 2.08485. But since it's 298, subtract 2 *0.0069495 = 0.013899.

So 2.08485 - 0.013899 = approx 2.07095.

So (Δn)*RT = -3.5 * 0.001987 *298 = -2.07095 kcal/mol.

So ΔU = 63.4 - (-2.07095) = 63.4 +2.07095 = 65.47095 kcal/mol.

Convert to kJ: 65.47095 *4.184 ≈ ?

Let me compute 65 *4.184 = 271.96.

0.47095 *4.184 = approx 1.971.

So total 271.96 +1.971≈273.931 kJ, which is approximately 273.93 kJ.

Looking at the options, option J is 273.94 kJ, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option J: 273.94 kJ.

To calculate the internal energy change (ΔU) for the reaction:

\[
\text{Cl}_2(g) + \frac{7}{2} \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2\text{O}_7(g) \quad \text{at 25°C},
\]

we use the relationship between ΔU and ΔH for ideal gases:

\[
\Delta U = \Delta H - \Delta nRT,
\]

where:
- ΔH is the enthalpy change for the reaction,
- Δn is the change in moles of gas,
- R is the gas constant,
- T is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Determine Δn
The reaction is:

\[
\text{Cl}_2(g) + \frac{7}{2} \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{Cl}_2\text{O}_7(g).
\]

The moles of gaseous reactants are:

\[
1 \, \text{(Cl}_2\text{)} + \frac{7}{2} \, \text{(O}_2\text{)} = 4.5 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of gaseous products are:

\[
1 \, \text{(Cl}_2\text{O}_7\text{)}.
\]

Thus, the change in moles of gas is:

\[
\Delta n = \text{moles of products} - \text{moles of reactants} = 1 - 4.5 = -3.5.
\]

### Step 2: Convert ΔH to consistent units
The given ΔH for the formation of Cl\(_2\)O\(_7\)(g) is:

\[
\Delta H = 63.4 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

Since R is typically expressed in cal/(mol·K), we use:

\[
R = 1.987 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)} = 0.001987 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate ΔU
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta U = \Delta H - \Delta nRT.
\]

\[
\Delta U = 63.4 - (-3.5)(0.001987)(298).
\]

First, calculate the term \((-3.5)(0.001987)(298)\):

\[
-3.5 \times 0.001987 = -0.0069495,
\]

\[
-0.0069495 \times 298 = -2.072 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta U = 63.4 - (-2.072) = 63.4 + 2.072 = 65.472 \, \text{kcal/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert ΔU to kJ
Since \(1 \, \text{kcal} = 4.184 \, \text{kJ}\), we convert:

\[
\Delta U = 65.472 \times 4.184 = 273.94 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The internal energy change for the reaction is approximately **273.94 kJ**, which corresponds to option **J**.
