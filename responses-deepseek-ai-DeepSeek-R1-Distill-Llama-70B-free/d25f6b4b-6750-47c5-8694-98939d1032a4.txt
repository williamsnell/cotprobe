Question:

Options:

A: Artificial genetic modification through genetic engineering techniques
B: Spontaneous mutation
C: Recombination of traits through conjugation
D: Exposure to mutagenic chemicals that induce DNA changes
E: Genetic drift
F: Binary fission

Okay, so I've got this question about genetic variation in bacteria. Hmm, I need to think through this. The question says that genetic variation occurs due to mutations because bacteria reproduce by binary fission. So the main point is that the question is asking to design an experiment to support another process causing variation besides mutation.

Wait, bacteria reproduce asexually through binary fission, right? So normally, they don't do meiosis or anything like that. So variation usually comes from mutations, which are changes in their DNA. But the question says there's another process. Oh right, I remember that bacteria can undergo something called conjugation, where they transfer plasmids or parts of their DNA to each other. So maybe that's another source of variation.

So the experiment should show that bacteria can acquire new traits without mutation. How would I design that? Well, maybe take two strains of bacteria with different characteristics. Like one might be resistant to an antibiotic, and the other isn't. Or maybe one can metabolize a certain substance and the other can't.

Wait, but how to show that the variation isn't from mutation? I think the key is to show that the traits are being transferred between bacteria. So if you have a strain that's sensitive to an antibiotic and another that's resistant, and then you mix them, some of the sensitive ones might become resistant. If that happens, it's probably because they exchanged genetic material, not because of a mutation.

Alternatively, you could use something like the ability to grow on a certain medium. Suppose strain A can't grow on lactose (like lac-), and strain B can (lac+). If you mix them and then plate them on a medium with lactose as the only carbon source, any colonies that grow would indicate that the lac- bacteria acquired the lac+ gene from strain B.

But wait, there's another thing. Transformation is another process where bacteria take up DNA from the environment. So maybe that's another method. But the question is about another process besides mutation, so either conjugation or transformation.

Wait, the options given are A to F. Looking at the options: option C is recombination through conjugation. So I think the experiment should involve showing that bacteria can exchange genetic material, leading to variation.

So the experiment design would involve taking two bacterial strains with different traits, mixing them, and seeing if the offspring have a combination of traits that neither parent had alone. Or, more precisely, seeing if some of the bacteria gain a new trait that wasn't present before due to genetic exchange.

Wait, but how to ensure that it's not just mutation? Because if you have a mutation causing the new trait, that would interfere. So maybe using strains that are each deficient in a different way. Like, one lacks gene A and the other lacks gene B. Then, if they exchange DNA, some bacteria would have both genes restored. That way, it's clear that the variation comes from combining their genes, not new mutations.

So, for example, take two E. coli strains. Strain 1 is unable to synthesize leucine (leu-) and can't metabolize lactose (lac-). Strain 2 can't synthesize methionine (met-) but can metabolize lactose (lac+). If they undergo conjugation, some bacteria might end up with both leu and met genes, and possibly the lac gene. Then, when plated on a medium lacking leucine and methionine but with lactose, only those that received the necessary genes from each other would grow.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Alternatively, using antibiotic resistance. Suppose strain A is resistant to ampicillin but sensitive to tetracycline. Strain B is resistant to tetracycline but sensitive to ampicillin. If they conjugate, some bacteria might become resistant to both. Then, when plated on a medium with both antibiotics, only the ones that received the resistance genes from each other would grow.

So the steps would be:

1. Obtain two bacterial strains with different antibiotic resistances (or different metabolic abilities).

2. Grow each strain separately to ensure they don't have the other's trait.

3. Mix the two strains and allow them to conjugate. Maybe under conditions that promote conjugation, like incubating them together.

4. After incubation, plate them on a medium that selects for the combined traits. For example, medium with both antibiotics.

5. If colonies grow on this medium, it suggests that the bacteria transferred genetic material, leading to the new trait combination.

Wait, but what's the control? Maybe having each strain plated on the same medium without mixing. If they don't grow, it shows that the original strains couldn't. Then, when mixed and plated, growth indicates gene transfer.

So the experiment's result would support that there's another process beyond mutation causing variation. Because without conjugation, the only way for a bacterium to have both resistances would be through simultaneous mutations, which is extremely rare. So the appearance of colonies on the selective medium after mixing would indicate gene transfer.

Looking back at the options, option C is about recombination through conjugation. So the correct answer would be C.

To design an experiment supporting the existence of another process besides mutation that results in genetic variation in bacteria, we can focus on demonstrating genetic recombination through conjugation. Bacteria reproduce asexually via binary fission, and while mutations are a primary source of variation, conjugation—where bacteria transfer genetic material—provides another mechanism.

The experiment would involve the following steps:

1. **Select Two Bacterial Strains**: Use two bacterial strains with distinct traits, such as antibiotic resistance or metabolic abilities. For example:
   - Strain A: Resistant to ampicillin (amp⁺) but sensitive to tetracycline (tet⁻).
   - Strain B: Resistant to tetracycline (tet⁺) but sensitive to ampicillin (amp⁻).

2. **Grow Strains Separately**: Ensure each strain is grown separately to confirm they do not initially possess the other's trait.

3. **Mix the Strains**: Combine the two strains under conditions that promote conjugation, such as incubating them together.

4. **Plate on Selective Medium**: After incubation, plate the mixed culture on a medium containing both ampicillin and tetracycline. This medium will select for bacteria that have acquired both resistance genes.

5. **Analyze Results**: If colonies grow on the selective medium, it indicates that genetic material was transferred between the strains during conjugation, resulting in bacteria with both resistances. This demonstrates that recombination, not mutation, is responsible for the new trait combination.

6. **Control Experiment**: To confirm the results, plate each strain separately on the selective medium. Neither strain should grow, as they lack one of the required resistances.

This experiment supports the existence of recombination through conjugation as a process generating genetic variation in bacteria, distinct from mutation.

The correct answer is **C: Recombination of traits through conjugation**.
