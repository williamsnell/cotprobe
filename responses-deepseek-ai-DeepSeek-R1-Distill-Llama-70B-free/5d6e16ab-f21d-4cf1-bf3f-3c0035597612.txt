Question:

Carol Collector was a serious antique car buyer, and was always searching for Thunderbirds in good shape. She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address "to view a picture of the car," which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was "used and sold as is." When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for

Options:

A: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.
B: Carol, because the "as is" disclosure was not totally effective.
C: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.
D: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
E: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."
F: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.
G: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.
H: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.
I: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically related to a car sale. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, Carol Collector is into antique cars, especially Thunderbirds. She saw an ad for a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe priced at $25,000. The ad also had a website with a picture showing a T-Bird in perfect condition. She paid the money, signed a contract that said the car was "used and sold as is." But when she went to pick it up, it was a 1968 model, which isn't rare and is worth less. Now she's suing the seller. The question is about the likely outcome.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out if Carol can get her money back or if the seller is off the hook. Let's think about the key points here.

First, the ad specified a 1964 model. The contract said "as is," which usually means the buyer takes the car in its current condition without warranties. But wait, the car wasn't even the right model year. That's a significant misrepresentation, right?

In contract law, there's something about mutual mistakes and misrepresentation. If one party makes a false statement that the other relies on, it can make the contract voidable. So here, the seller advertised a '64, but it's a '68. That's a clear mistake in the subject matter.

The "as is" clause typically covers the condition of the car, not the identity or basic specs like the model year. So even if the car is sold as is, if the seller lies about what the car actually is, that's a different issue. Like, if you sell me a Ford but give me a Chevy, the as-is doesn't cover that because it's a fundamental mistake about the item itself.

So the contract's "as is" clause probably doesn't protect the seller here because the car wasn't as described in the ad. The ad was part of the contract, or at least the basis on which Carol agreed to buy. She relied on that information, including the model year, to make her decision.

Looking at the answer options:

Option B says Carol wins because the as-is disclosure wasn't effective. That makes sense because the as-is doesn't cover misrepresentation about the car's identity.

Option D says the seller loses because the car was misrepresented in the ad. That also seems right because the ad was false regarding the model.

Option F says Carol wins unless the seller can prove equal value. But the question says the '68 is worth much less, so that's not the case.

Option H says the seller loses if Carol relied on the picture. The picture showed a '64, but the actual car was '68. So she definitely relied on that.

Wait, but the contract said "used and sold as is." Could that prevent her from getting relief? I think not because the as-is typically doesn't cover fraudulent misrepresentation. The seller can't use as-is to escape liability for lying about the car.

So the key points are: the ad was false about the model year, which is a material fact. The as-is clause doesn't protect against that. So Carol can likely get the contract rescinded or get damages.

Looking at the options again, option B and D seem relevant. Option B is about the as-is not being effective, and D is about misrepresentation in the ad.

Wait, the contract said "sold as is," but the ad was part of the negotiation. In contract terms, if the seller makes a material misrepresentation in the advertisement, that can be grounds for rescission even if the contract has an as-is clause.

So the likely outcome is that Carol would win because the seller misrepresented the car's model year, and the as-is clause doesn't cover that. Therefore, the correct answer would be either B or D.

Option B says the as-is wasn't effective. Option D says the seller misrepresented in the ad.

Another angle: in some jurisdictions, when a seller uses an advertisement that contains false information, and the buyer relies on it, that's a basis for rescission. The as-is clause usually doesn't bar claims based on false representations made before the contract.

So the outcome is likely that Carol wins because the seller misrepresented the car in the ad, making option D correct.

Alternatively, option B focuses on the as-is not being effective. So which is it?

Wait, the contract included an as-is clause, but the ad (which may be considered part of the contract terms) was false. So the as-is doesn't negate the misrepresentation in the ad. So the seller is liable for the false ad.

So I think the correct answer is D: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.

Yes, that makes sense. Because the advertisement was false regarding the model year, which is a material fact. The as-is clause doesn't protect against that.

The case revolves around Carol Collector's purchase of a car that was advertised as a 1964 Thunderbird but turned out to be a 1968 model. The sales contract included an "as is" clause, but the advertisement misrepresented the car's model year, a material fact. Under contract law, an "as is" clause typically covers the condition of the item but does not protect sellers from liability for fraudulent or material misrepresentation. The advertisement, which Carol relied on, falsely stated the car's model year, making the seller liable for misrepresentation. The "as is" clause does not negate this liability because it does not cover fundamental misrepresentations about the item's identity or specifications.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** suggests Carol wins because the "as is" disclosure was not effective. While the "as is" clause does not protect the seller in this case, the primary issue is the misrepresentation in the advertisement, not just the ineffectiveness of the "as is" clause.
- **Option D** states the seller loses because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement. This directly addresses the core issue: the false advertising about the model year, which is a material fact. The "as is" clause does not shield the seller from this misrepresentation.

Given the facts, the most accurate outcome is that the seller is liable due to the misrepresentation in the advertisement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.**

Answer: D
