Question:

Describe briefly the characteristics of the ontogeny of a humanbeing from a zygote to a mature fetus. What is the significanceof this?

Options:

A: Ontogeny refers to the development of social behaviors in humans from infancy to adulthood.
B: Ontogeny is the study of morphological changes of an organism throughout its lifespan.
C: The ontogeny of a human begins with the birth and ends with the onset of puberty.
D: Ontogeny is the sequence of events involved in the evolutionary development of a species over time.
E: Ontogeny represents the individual development of an organism.
F: The ontogeny of the human embryo reveals to some extent the evolutionary history of man. The significance of this is that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.
G: Ontogeny describes the genetic control of cell growth.
H: Ontogeny involves the maturation of the immune system from birth to the aging process.
I: The ontogeny of a human being starts at adolescence and continues until the individual reaches full emotional and intellectual maturity.
J: Ontogeny is the process of an individual organism growing organically.

Okay, so I've got this question about ontogeny in human beings. I'm a bit rusty on my biology terms, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking about the characteristics of ontogeny from a zygote to a mature fetus and its significance. The options are A to J. Let me unpack what I remember.

First, I think ontogeny refers to the development of an individual organism from the earliest stage (like a zygote) through to maturity. It's about the growth and development steps an organism undergoes. So it's not about evolution of species over time, but rather the individual's life stages.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Talks about social behaviors. That doesn't fit because ontogeny is more about physical development, not just social behaviors.

Option B: Says it's the study of morphological changes throughout lifespan. That sounds closer. Morphological changes mean changes in form and structure. So this could be a contender.

Option C: Starts at birth and ends at puberty. Wait, no, because the question starts at zygote, which is before birth. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Refers to evolutionary development of a species over time. Oh wait, that's phylogeny, not ontogeny. So D is wrong.

Option E: Individual development of an organism. That's a good definition for ontogeny. So E is a possible correct answer.

Option F: Says ontogeny reveals evolutionary history because it recapitulates phylogeny. I remember something about the "biogenetic law" where the embryonic stages resemble ancestral forms. So this connects ontogeny to phylogeny. So F seems to explain the significance.

Option G: Genetic control of cell growth. That's more about molecular biology or genetics, not the broader development stages.

Option H: Maturation of the immune system. That's a specific system, not the entire development.

Option I: Starts at adolescence. No, because the question starts at zygote, so I is wrong.

Option J: Process of growing organically. That's too vague and doesn't capture the full scope.

So the question is asking two parts: characteristics (which E and B partially describe) and the significance (which F covers).

Wait, the question asks for characteristics and significance. Looking at the options, E is a definition but doesn't mention significance. F adds that significance part, tying it to evolutionary history.

So the correct answer would be E and F? But the options are separate. The question is "what is the significance of this?" So the correct option needs to address both the process and the significance.

Wait, the options are each separate answers. Let me re-read the question.

The question is: "Describe briefly the characteristics... What is the significance of this?" So the answer should cover both aspects.

Looking again, option E is a definition but doesn't explain significance. Option F explains the significance but not the characteristics. Hmm, but the question is looking for an option that answers both parts.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The options are each possible answers, not pairs. So the correct option would describe the characteristics and the significance.

Option E says "ontogeny is the individual development of an organism." That's the definition. But the significance would be elsewhere.

Option F says that the embryo's stages reveal evolutionary history because ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. So F is about the significance part. But the question is asking for both the characteristics and the significance.

Wait, perhaps the question is framed as two parts, but the options are each possible answers. So the correct answer must include both aspects. Looking again, perhaps option E describes the characteristics, and F adds the significance. But the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option E for the characteristics and F for the significance, but the options are separate. So each option is a possible answer, not a combination.

Alternatively, perhaps option F is the correct answer because it answers both: the ontogeny (development stages) and the significance (relation to evolutionary history).

Wait, the question is a two-part question. But each option is a statement. So the correct answer would be the one that correctly states both.

Alternatively, perhaps the first part is the definition, and the second part is the significance. So for the first part, E is correct (individual development), but the significance is F.

But looking at the options, each option is a standalone statement. So the correct answer must be the one that accurately answers the entire question.

Option E: Correctly defines ontogeny. But the significance isn't addressed here.

Option F: Talks about the significance, implying that the ontogeny shows evolutionary stages.

Wait, the question asks for both the characteristics and the significance. So perhaps option F is the best fit because it explains that the ontogeny reveals evolutionary history, which is the significance.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E because it's the definition, and the significance is a separate point. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is phrased as "Describe briefly the characteristics... What is the significance of this?" So each option needs to cover both aspects. But looking at the options, F does that. It says that the ontogeny reveals evolutionary history, which is the significance.

So F would be the correct answer because it explains both: the process (ontogeny) and the significance (relation to phylogeny).

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, but that doesn't address significance. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The term "ontogeny" refers to the development of an individual. So the first part is E. The significance is that it shows evolutionary stages, which is F. But the options are separate.

Wait, the question is a single question. So perhaps the correct answer is option F because it answers the significance part, and the characteristics are implied.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is about the characteristics (process) and significance.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to recall: the biogenetic law says that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which is what option F says. So F is about the significance.

The first part, the characteristics, is the development from zygote to fetus, which is individual development. So the correct answer would be E for the first part, but since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is E for the characteristics and F for the significance. But the question is looking for a single answer that covers both.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because it's the only option that connects the process to its significance. The question asks what the significance is, so the correct answer would explain that.

So I think the correct answer is F.

The question asks about the characteristics of human ontogeny from zygote to mature fetus and its significance. Ontogeny refers to the individual development of an organism, encompassing the stages from zygote through embryonic and fetal development. The significance lies in the idea that ontogeny reflects evolutionary history, as embryonic stages often resemble ancestral formsâ€”a concept known as "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny."

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, G, H, I**: These options are incorrect because they either misdefine ontogeny or focus on unrelated aspects like social behaviors, immune system maturation, or adolescence.
- **B**: While it mentions morphological changes, it does not address the significance of ontogeny.
- **E**: Correctly defines ontogeny as the individual development of an organism but does not explain the significance.
- **F**: Accurately describes both the process of ontogeny and its significance, linking it to evolutionary history through the concept of "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny."
- **J**: Too vague and does not capture the full scope of ontogeny or its significance.

Option **F** is the best answer because it comprehensively addresses both the characteristics of ontogeny and its evolutionary significance.

Answer: F
