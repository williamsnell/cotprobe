Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about protons used in cancer therapy. Hmm, let me think. The question says the protons are accelerated to about 0.6c, and we need to find out how much work must be done on a particle of mass m to reach that speed, starting from rest. The options are from A to J, with various multiples of mc².

Wait, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, it's the total energy minus the rest mass energy. So the formula should be K = (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So v here is 0.6c. Let me plug that in. So γ equals 1 divided by sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2). Because (0.6c)^2 is 0.36c², so 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8, which is 1.25.

So K equals (1.25 - 1) times mc squared. That's 0.25 mc². Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the kinetic energy is the work done, right? Because work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy. Starting from rest, so initial KE is zero, so the work done is just K.

Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 0.25 mc². That seems right. But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes it's easy to get mixed up with the numbers.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c. v² is 0.36c². 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So 1/0.8 is 1.25. So gamma is 1.25. So (gamma -1) is 0.25. So indeed, K is 0.25 mc². Therefore, the answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait, another thought. Is the work done the same as the kinetic energy in this context? Oh yes, because when the particle starts from rest, all the work done goes into its kinetic energy. So yes, the work done is equal to K, which is 0.25 mc². So the correct option is B.
</think>

To determine the work required to accelerate a proton of mass \( m \) to a speed of \( 0.6c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The kinetic energy \( K \) of a particle is given by:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

Here, \( v = 0.6c \). Substituting this into the formula for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy is:

\[
K = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2
\]

Since the particle starts from rest, the work done on it is equal to its kinetic energy. Therefore, the work required is \( 0.25mc^2 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
