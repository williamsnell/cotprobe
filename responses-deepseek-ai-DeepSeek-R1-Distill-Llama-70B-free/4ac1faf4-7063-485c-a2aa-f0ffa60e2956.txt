Question:

What are the difficulties in the classification of tissuesof higherplants?

Options:

A: Plant tissues can be fully characterized based on their evolutionary heritage
B: Plant tissues are distinguished only by their cellular composition without considering their function
C: All plant tissues are meristematic and capable of continuous division
D: Plant tissues can be classified with ease as they do not exhibit any plasticity or change in response to environmental conditions
E: Plant tissues are identical in angiosperms and gymnosperms, making classification simple
F: The classification of plant tissues is uncomplicated due to the uniformity of cells within a given tissue type
G: Plant tissues cannot be fully characterized or distinguished on the basis of any one single factor such as location, function, structure or evolutionary heritage. Some permanent tissues may change to meristematic activity under certain conditions.
H: Plant tissues can be classified solely on the basis of the type of cell wall they possess
I: Plant tissues can be easily distinguished based on their location and function
J: All plant tissues remain constant throughout their life cycle

Alright, so I've got this question about the classification of plant tissues, and I need to figure it out. Okay, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is about the difficulties in classifying tissues of higher plants. Hmm.

I remember from my biology class that plant tissues can be a bit tricky to classify because they have various characteristics. The options given are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one that points out the difficulty.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A says tissues can be fully characterized by their evolutionary heritage. Wait, I don't think that's right. Evolutionary history is one factor, but tissues also vary based on structure, function, and development. So A might not be the correct answer.

Option B claims tissues are distinguished only by their cells without considering function. No, that doesn't sound right. Function definitely plays a role in classification. For example, xylem and phloem have different functions, so B is probably incorrect.

Option C: All plant tissues are meristematic. No, that's not true. Most plant tissues are permanent, like parenchyma or sclerenchyma, and don't divide continuously. Only specific tissues like apical meristems are meristematic. So C is wrong.

Option D says tissues are easy to classify because they don't change with environment. Oh wait, I remember something about plasticity. Plants can show plasticity, meaning their tissues can change in response to the environment. So D is incorrect because it's the opposite of what's true.

Option E: Tissues are identical in angiosperms and gymnosperms. That doesn't make sense. They have different structures, like xylem in angiosperms has vessels, while gymnosperms have tracheids. So E is wrong.

Option F: Classification is easy because cells are uniform in a tissue. Hmm, some tissues are uniform, but others might have various cell types. Plus, the main issue is more about different factors influencing classification, not uniformity. So F might not be the right choice.

Option G: Tissues can't be fully characterized by a single factor like location, function, etc., and some permanent tissues can become meristematic. Oh, this rings a bell. I think this is correct because plant tissues are classified based on multiple factors, and sometimes they can revert or change their activity. For example, wounded tissues might start dividing again, showing meristematic activity. So G seems like a solid option.

Option H: Classification based solely on cell wall type. No, that's too narrow. There are other factors like cell arrangement and function. So H is wrong.

Option I: Tissues easily distinguished by location and function. While location and function are factors, it's not that straightforward because other factors like structure and development also play roles. So I is incorrect.

Option J: All tissues remain constant. No, some tissues can change as mentioned in G, so J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G. It points out that classification isn't based on a single factor and that tissues can change their activity under certain conditions, which makes classification challenging.

The classification of plant tissues is challenging because it cannot be based on a single factor such as location, function, structure, or evolutionary heritage. Additionally, some permanent tissues may revert to meristematic activity under specific conditions, further complicating the process. This makes option G the correct answer.

Answer: G
