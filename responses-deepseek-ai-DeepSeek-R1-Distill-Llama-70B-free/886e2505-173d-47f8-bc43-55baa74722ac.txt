Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about a convex polygon with a certain number of faces and edges, and I need to find the number of vertices. Hmm, wait a second, polygons are 2D shapes, right? So when they mention 'faces', that might be a bit confusing because faces are more of a 3D concept. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo. Let me think again.

Polygons have edges and vertices, not faces. Faces are for polyhedrons, like cubes or pyramids. So perhaps the question actually meant edges and vertices. Let me read the question again. It says, "a convex polygon has 26 faces and 39 edges." That doesn't make much sense because a polygon doesn't have faces. So maybe it's a typo, and they meant edges and vertices. Or maybe it's a translation issue, like in some languages 'face' might be used differently.

Alternatively, maybe the question is talking about a polyhedron, not a polygon. Because polyhedrons have faces, edges, and vertices. Wait, but the question says "convex polygon", which is definitely 2D. So I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to process this.

Wait, maybe it's a mistake, and it's supposed to be a polyhedron. Because a polygon can't have 26 faces. So perhaps the correct question should be about a convex polyhedron with 26 faces and 39 edges, and we're to find the number of vertices.

If that's the case, then I can use Euler's formula. Euler's formula relates the number of vertices (V), edges (E), and faces (F) in a convex polyhedron. The formula is V - E + F = 2. Oh wait, or is it F + V - E = 2? Let me make sure. Yeah, I think it's V - E + F = 2. So F is the number of faces, E the edges, V the vertices.

Let's plug in the numbers. F is 26, E is 39. So substituting into Euler's formula: V - 39 + 26 = 2. That simplifies to V - 13 = 2. So V would be 15. Wait, but let me check the calculation again. 26 (faces) minus 39 (edges) plus V equals 2? No, wait, Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2. So V = 2 + E - F.

Wait, let me clarify. Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2. So solving for V, it's V = 2 + E - F. So E is 39, F is 26.

So V = 2 + 39 - 26. Let's compute that. 39 minus 26 is 13, plus 2 is 15. So V equals 15.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 15. So the answer would be D. But wait, earlier I thought the question was about a polygon, but polygons don't have faces. So perhaps the question has a typo, and it's supposed to be a polyhedron, not a polygon. So in that case, using Euler's formula, the answer would be 15, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the question is correct as a polygon, then the information must be wrong because polygons don't have faces. So maybe the question intended edges and something else. Wait, but the question says "has 26 faces and 39 edges." That can't apply to a polygon, so I think it's a mistake and it's a polyhedron.

So I'll proceed with that assumption. So the answer should be 15, which is option D.

The question appears to have a typo, as a convex polygon, being a 2D shape, does not have faces. It is likely referring to a convex polyhedron instead. For a polyhedron, Euler's formula applies: 

\[
V - E + F = 2
\]

where \( V \) is the number of vertices, \( E \) is the number of edges, and \( F \) is the number of faces. Substituting the given values (\( F = 26 \), \( E = 39 \)):

\[
V - 39 + 26 = 2
\]

Simplifying:

\[
V - 13 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad V = 15
\]

Thus, the number of vertices is 15, corresponding to option D.
