Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of fluid mechanics. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about oil drops settling in air. The setup is that there's a mixture of oil and air, and the oil drops have a certain diameter. We need to find the maximum height of the chamber required for these drops to settle in a given time. The options are from A to J, and the answer is one of those.

Let me read the problem again carefully. The specific gravity of the oil is 0.88. Specific gravity is the ratio of the density of the substance to the density of water. So since water has a density of about 62.4 lb/ft³, the oil's density should be 0.88 times that. Let me calculate that. 0.88 * 62.4 is... let's see, 60 would be 55.2, and 2.4 is about 2.112, so total around 57.312 lb/ft³? Hmm, wait, wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, specific gravity is unitless, right? So oil's density is 0.88 * density of water. So density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³, so oil is 0.88 * 62.4. Let me compute that: 62.4 * 0.88. 60*0.88 is 52.8, and 2.4 *0.88 is 2.112. So 52.8 + 2.112 equals 54.912 lb/ft³. So oil density, rho_oil = 54.912 lb/ft³.

The diameter of the oil drops is 3.5e-5 ft. So radius is half of that, so 1.75e-5 ft. That's a very small drop, which makes sense because in air, they'd settle slowly.

The settling time allowed is 90 seconds. So the question is asking for the maximum height the chamber needs to be so that the oil drops can settle in that time. I think this relates to the terminal velocity of the oil drops. Because the drops will reach a terminal velocity, and then settle at that speed. So the distance they cover in 90 seconds at that velocity will determine the height needed.

So the first thing I need to find is the terminal velocity of the oil drops. Once I have that, I can multiply by the time (90 seconds) to get the distance, which is the height of the chamber.

Terminal velocity is when the forces on the drop balance each other. The forces acting on the drop are gravity pulling it down, buoyancy pushing it up, and drag opposing the motion.

So the forces:

- Gravitational force (weight): F_gravity = volume * rho_oil * g.

But wait, the buoyant force is the weight of the air displaced, which is F_buoyancy = volume * rho_air * g.

And the drag force, F_drag, depends on the velocity. For low Reynolds numbers (creeping flow), drag is given by Stokes' law: F_drag = 6 * pi * mu * r * v, where mu is the viscosity of the fluid (air in this case), r is the radius of the drop, and v is the velocity.

At terminal velocity, the net force is zero. So:

F_gravity - F_buoyancy - F_drag = 0.

Wait, no, because the direction: gravity is pulling down, buoyancy is up, drag is also opposing the motion (which is downward, so drag is upward). So the equation should be:

F_gravity = F_buoyancy + F_drag.

So substituting:

volume * rho_oil * g = volume * rho_air * g + 6 * pi * mu * r * v.

We can cancel the volume on both sides:

rho_oil * g = rho_air * g + (6 * pi * mu * r * v) / volume.

Wait, volume is (4/3) pi r^3, right? So substituting that in:

rho_oil * g = rho_air * g + [6 * pi * mu * r * v] / [(4/3) pi r^3)].

Simplify the denominator: (4/3) pi r³. So the denominator is (4/3) pi r³, so the whole term becomes [6 pi mu r v] * [3/(4 pi r³)] )= [18 pi mu r v ] / [4 pi r^3 ].

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

The [6 pi mu r v] divided by [ (4/3) pi r³ ] is equal to (6 pi mu r v) * (3)/(4 pi r³) )= (18 pi mu r v) ) / (4 pi r³).

The pi cancels out, and r in the numerator cancels with r³ in the denominator, leaving r².

So 18 mu v / (4 r²) )= (9/2) (mu v) / r².

Wait, 18 divided by 4 is 4.5, which is 9/2. So yeah.

So the equation becomes:

rho_oil * g = rho_air * g + (9/2) * (mu * v) / r².

We can rearrange this to solve for v (the terminal velocity).

Subtract rho_air *g from both sides:

(rho_oil - rho_air) * g = (9/2) (mu v) / r².

Then, solve for v:

v = [2 (rho_oil - rho_air) g r² ] / (9 mu )

That's the terminal velocity.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. I've heard that the terminal velocity for a particle in a fluid is given by v = (2 r² (rho_p - rho_f) g )/(9 mu), where rho_p is the particle density and rho_f the fluid density. Yeah, that seems right. So that's the formula I'll use.

So plugging in the numbers.

Given:

rho_oil = 54.912 lb/ft³ (from specific gravity 0.88 and water's density being 62.4 lb/ft³).

rho_air = 0.075 lb/ft³.

g is acceleration due to gravity. In English units, g is 32.2 ft/s².

mu (viscosity of air) is given as 1.2e-5 lb/ft-s.

r is the radius of the oil drop. The diameter is 3.5e-5 ft, so radius is 1.75e-5 ft.

So let's compute each part.

First, compute (rho_oil - rho_air) = 54.912 - 0.075 = 54.837 lb/ft³.

Then, multiply by g: 54.837 lb/ft³ * 32.2 ft/s² = let's compute that.

Wait, lb/ft³ multiplied by ft/s² gives lb/(ft² s²) because:

ft³ = ft * ft * ft. So lb/ft³ * ft/s² = (lb * ft) )/( ft³ s² ) * ft = lb/(ft² s²) * ft = lb/(ft s²).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to just compute the value numerically.

54.837 * 32.2. Let me compute 54 *32=1728, 54 *0.2=10.8, 0.837 *32=26.784, 0.837 *0.2=0.1674. So total is 1728 +10.8 +26.784 +0.1674= 1728+10.8=1738.8, plus 26.784 is 1765.584, plus 0.1674 is 1765.7514. So approximately 1765.75 lb/(ft² s²).

Wait, but that might not be the right way. Alternatively, 54.837 *32.2.

Let me compute 54.837 × 32.2.

54.837 × 30 = 1,645.11

54.837 ×2.2= approx 54.837 ×2=109.674, 54.837 ×0.2=10.9674 → total 109.674 +10.9674=120.6414.

So total 1,645.11 +120.6414=1,765.7514 lb/(ft² s²).

Then, multiply by r squared. r is 1.75e-5 ft. So r squared is (1.75e-5)^2 = (3.0625e-10) ft².

So 1,765.7514 * 3.0625e-10 = let's compute that.

1,765.7514 * 3.0625e-10 = ?

Wait, 1,765.7514 * 3.0625 = ?

Let me compute 1,765.75 ×3=5,297.25, 1,765.75 ×0.0625=110.359375. So total ≈5,297.25 +110.359 =5,407.609.

So 5,407.609e-10 → 5.407609e-7.

But wait, let's double-check: 1.75e-5 squared is 3.0625e-10, correct.

So 1,765.7514 lb/(ft² s²) * 3.0625e-10 ft² = 1,765.7514 *3.0625e-10. Let me compute 1,765.7514 * 3.0625 first.

Wait, 1,765.7514 *3 =5,297.2542.

1,765.7514 *0.0625= 110.3594625.

So total: 5,297.2542 +110.3594625=5,407.61366.

So 5,407.61366e-10 → 5.40761366e-7 lb/(s²).

Wait, but the units here: since (rho_oil - rho_air) is lb/ft³, multiplied by g (ft/s²) gives lb/(ft² s²), then multiplied by r² (ft²) gives lb/(s²). Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm tracking the units correctly. Maybe better to proceed with the calculation.

So now, the numerator is 2 * (rho_oil - rho_air) g r² → which is 2 * (1,765.7514) * 3.0625e-10 → but wait, I think I already included the 2 in the formula earlier. Wait no:

Wait, in the formula, v = [2 (rho_oil - rho_air) g r² ] / (9 mu )

So the numerator is 2*(rho_oil - rho_air)*g*r². So the product we just computed was (rho_oil - rho_air)*g*r² =1,765.7514 *3.0625e-10 =5.407e-7 lb/s².

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-examine. We have (rho_oil - rho_air) is 54.837 lb/ft³. Multiply by g (32.2 ft/s²) → gives 54.837 *32.2 lb/(ft² s²) → which is 1,765.75 lb/(ft² s²). Then, multiplied by r^2 (3.0625e-10 ft²) → gives 1,765.75 *3.0625e-10 lb/(s²). Which is 5.4076e-7 lb/(s²).

Then, multiply by 2 to get the numerator: 2 * 5.4076e-7 → 1.0815e-6 lb/(s²).

Denominator is 9 * mu. mu is 1.2e-5 lb/ft-s.

So denominator is 9 * 1.2e-5 = 1.08e-4 lb/ft-s.

So v = numerator / denominator → (1.0815e-6) / (1.08e-4) ) → let's compute that.

1.0815e-6 / 1.08e-4 = approx 0.01 (since 1e-6 /1e-4 is 0.01). But more accurately:

1.0815e-6 / 1.08e-4 = (1.0815 /1.08 ) * (1e-6 /1e-4 ) → (approx 1.00138) * (0.01) )= 0.0100138 ft/s.

Wait, that seems low. Let me double-check the calculations, because that seems like a very slow speed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the computation.

Wait, let's recompute the numerator and denominator again.

Numerator: 2*(rho_oil - rho_air)*g*r².

rho_oil - rho_air =54.837 lb/ft³.

g=32.2 ft/s².

r=1.75e-5 ft → r²=3.0625e-10 ft².

So the term is 2 *54.837 *32.2 *3.0625e-10.

Wait, let me calculate this step by step.

First, 2 *54.837 = 109.674.

Then, 109.674 *32.2 = let's compute that.

100 *32.2=3220,

9.674 *32.2 → 9*32.2=289.8, 0.674*32.2≈21.7 → total 289.8+21.7=311.5.

So total is 3220 + 311.5 =3531.5.

Then, 3531.5 *3.0625e-10 = ?

3531.5 *3.0625 = let's compute that.

3531.5 *3 =10,594.5

3531.5 *0.0625=220.96875

So total is 10,594.5 +220.96875 =10,815.46875.

So 10,815.46875e-10 → 1.081546875e-6 lb/(s²).

Denominator: 9 * mu =9 *1.2e-5 lb/ft-s → 1.08e-4 lb/ft-s.

So v = (1.081546875e-6 lb/s²) / (1.08e-4 lb/ft-s)).

Wait, the units: lb/(s²) divided by lb/(ft·s) → (lb/(s²)) * (ft·s/lb) )= ft/(s).

So the calculation is 1.081546875e-6 / 1.08e-4.

Which is (1.081546875 /1.08 ) * (1e-6 /1e-4 ) → approx 1.00138 *0.01 → 0.0100138 ft/s.

Wait, but 0.0100138 ft/s is about 0.12 inches per second. That seems very slow. But considering the oil drops are extremely small and in air, maybe it's correct.

So the terminal velocity is approximately 0.0100138 ft/s.

Now, the settling time allowed is 90 seconds, so the maximum height H is v * t.

H = 0.0100138 ft/s *90 s = 0.90125 ft.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.9 ft, which is very close to 0.90125. So the answer should be A: 0.9 ft.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps for any possible error.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of the formula. Let me go back to the equation.

The formula is v = [2 (rho_oil - rho_air) g r² ] / [9 mu ]

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated the exponents. Let me compute the numerator again.

rho_oil - rho_air =54.837 lb/ft³.

r is 1.75e-5 ft, so r squared is (1.75e-5)^2 =3.0625e-10 ft².

So 2 *54.837 *32.2 *3.0625e-10.

Let me compute that:

2 *54.837 =109.674.

109.674 *32.2 = let's compute 100*32.2=3220, 9.674*32.2= approx 311.5 → total 3531.5.

3531.5 *3.0625e-10 = ?

3531.5 *3.0625 =10,815.46875 → so 10,815.46875e-10 → 1.081546875e-6.

Divide by denominator 9 * mu =9 *1.2e-5 =1.08e-4.

So 1.081546875e-6 /1.08e-4 → approximately 0.0100138 ft/s.

Multiply by 90 → ~0.90125 ft → 0.901 ft, which is 0.9 ft when rounded. So option A.

Wait, but another way to think: if the velocity is 0.0100138 ft/s, in 90 seconds, H=0.0100138 *90=0.90125 ft.

Yes, that looks correct. So the answer should be A: 0.9 ft.

To determine the maximum height of the chamber required for the oil drops to settle, we need to calculate the terminal velocity of the oil drops and then use this velocity to find the height they settle in 90 seconds.
