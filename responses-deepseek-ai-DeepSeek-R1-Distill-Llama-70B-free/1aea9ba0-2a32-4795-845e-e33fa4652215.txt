Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a neutral solution at 50°C. Hmm, I remember that pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions, but the tricky part is the temperature because I know that the pH of neutral water changes with temperature.

Wait, at standard temperature, which is 25°C, neutral water has a pH of 7. But when the temperature increases, does the pH go up or down? Oh right, because water can ionize more as temperature increases. So at higher temps, water autoionizes more, producing more H+ and OH- ions.

The problem gives the pKw as 13.26 at 50°C. I recall that Kw is the ion product of water, which is [H+][OH-]. At 25°C, Kw is 1e-14, so pKw is 14. But here, it's 13.26 because the temperature is higher.

For a neutral solution, the concentration of H+ and OH- are equal. So in pure water, [H+] = [OH-] = sqrt(Kw). But how does that translate to pH?

At 25°C, pH = 7 because Kw is 1e-14, so sqrt(1e-14) is 1e-7, so pH is 7. But at 50°C, Kw must be higher because pKw is lower. So let me think, pKw is the negative log of Kw. So Kw = 10^(-pKw) = 10^(-13.26). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 10^-13 is 1e-13, and 10^-0.26 is about 0.55. So 1e-13 * 0.55 is roughly 5.5e-14. So Kw is around 5.5e-14. Then [H+] would be sqrt(5.5e-14). Let me calculate that. The square root of 5.5 is about 2.34, so sqrt(5.5e-14) is 2.34e-7. So [H+] is roughly 2.34e-7 M.

Then pH is -log(2.34e-7). Let's see, log(2.34) is about 0.37, so log(2.34e-7) is 7 - 0.37, which is 6.63. Wait, no, wait. Because 1e-7 is pH 7, but here it's 2.34e-7, which is higher than 1e-7. So the pH should be lower than 7, right? Because higher H+ concentration means lower pH.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, [H+] is 2.34e-7, which is larger than 1e-7. So since pH is -log[H+], a larger [H+] would make the pH lower. So 2.34e-7 is 10^(-6.63), because 10^(-6) is 1e-6, and 10^(-7) is 1e-7. So 10^(-6.63) is roughly 2.34e-7. So the pH would be 6.63.

Wait, but wait, I thought that at higher temperatures, the pH of neutral water decreases. So at 50°C, neutral solution is slightly acidic. So pH should be less than 7, like around 6.6 something. Looking at the options, option G is 6.63, which matches my calculation.

Alternatively, another approach: for pure water, pH + pOH = pKw. So if the solution is neutral, pH = pOH. So 2*pH = pKw. So pH = pKw / 2. Given that pKw is 13.26, pH would be 13.26 / 2 = 6.63.

Yes, that makes sense. So the pH is 6.63, which is option G.

To determine the pH of a neutral solution at 50°C, we use the relationship between pH, pOH, and pKw. For pure water, the concentrations of [H⁺] and [OH⁻] are equal, meaning pH = pOH. Additionally, the ion product of water, Kw, is related to pH and pOH by the equation:

\[
\text{pH} + \text{pOH} = \text{pKw}
\]

Since pH = pOH for a neutral solution, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
2 \cdot \text{pH} = \text{pKw}
\]

Given that pKw at 50°C is 13.26, we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = \frac{\text{pKw}}{2} = \frac{13.26}{2} = 6.63
\]

Thus, the pH of a neutral solution at 50°C is 6.63. This value is consistent with the fact that as temperature increases, the pH of neutral water decreases slightly due to increased autoionization of water.

The correct answer is:

G: 6.63
