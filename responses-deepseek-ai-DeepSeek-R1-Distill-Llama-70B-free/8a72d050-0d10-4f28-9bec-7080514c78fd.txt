Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this ethics question. Let me read the problem carefully.

The scenario is that I receive an email from Dr. Brenda Browne, a licensed psychologist. She's currently seeing one of my former clients for a substance abuse disorder. She's asking me to forward the client's file and mentions that the client has signed a release authorizing me to do so. The question is, what should I do?

The options are A through J. I remember that in such situations, client confidentiality and proper procedures are key. Let me think through each option.

Option A says to refuse because it violates patient privacy laws. But wait, the client has already signed a release, so that shouldn't be a violation. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B suggests waiting until I hear from the client. But the psychologist already says the client signed a release, so maybe I don't need to wait. Hmm, but maybe I should confirm the release.

Option C is sending the original file without any prior discussion. That doesn't seem right because I should verify the release first, maybe. Sending the original might not be necessary; a copy is usually sufficient.

Option D is forwarding a photocopy. That could be appropriate if the release is valid, but I might need to confirm the release's authenticity first.

Option E is deleting substance abuse records. That sounds like altering medical records, which is unethical and possibly illegal. So E is out.

Option F is sending only parts created during my treatment. That might be correct if the release specifies only certain information, but the question doesn't say that. The psychologist might need the entire file.

Option G is sending a summary. That might not be sufficient if the psychologist needs detailed info. Plus, the release probably covers the entire file.

Option H suggests asking Dr. Browne for a copy of the signed release. That makes sense because I should verify the release exists before sending anything. It's about protecting client confidentiality and ensuring everything is done properly.

Option I is forwarding the entire file digitally without checking. That might be risky without confirming the release, so I shouldn't do that without verification.

Option J is contacting the client to discuss. Well, the client has already signed a release, so maybe that's unnecessary. But sometimes, it's good to confirm, but the question doesn't indicate any doubts about the release's validity.

So, putting this together. The correct approach is to make sure the release is valid. The psychologist says the client signed it, but I should still verify. So the best step is to ask Dr. Browne for a copy of the signed release before sending the file. That way, I'm ensuring that I'm complying with legal requirements and maintaining confidentiality.

Looking at the options, that's option H.

The correct approach is to verify the validity of the release before sending the client's file. By requesting a copy of the signed release from Dr. Browne, you ensure compliance with confidentiality laws and ethical standards. 

Answer: H
