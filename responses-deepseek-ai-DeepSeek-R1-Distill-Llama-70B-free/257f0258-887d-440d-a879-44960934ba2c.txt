Question:

Discuss Fiedler's contingency model of leadership.

Options:

A: The model posits that leadership effectiveness arises from the leader's intelligence and experience, rather than the situation or their style.

C: Fiedler's contingency model suggests that a leader's effectiveness is fixed and cannot be changed by understanding situational factors.
D: Fiedler's contingency model of leadership suggests that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent on the interaction between their style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations and the leader's power.
E: Fiedler's model suggests the effectiveness of a leader is determined solely by their personality.
F: According to the model, the only factor that determines a leader's effectiveness is their ability to communicate clearly and effectively with their team.
G: According to Fiedler, a leader's effectiveness is contingent upon the organization's culture.
H: Fiedler's model implies that a leader's effectiveness is determined by their ability to adapt their style to every situation.

Okay, so I've got this question about Fiedler's contingency model of leadership. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that there are various leadership theories, and contingency models are one type. I think contingency models suggest that the effectiveness of a leader depends on the situation they're in, rather than just their traits or style. So Fiedler's model must fit into that category.

I recall that Fiedler's model talks about different leadership styles being effective in different situations. Oh right, he categorized leaders as either task-oriented or relationship-oriented. Task-oriented leaders focus on getting the job done, while relationship-oriented leaders focus more on their team's well-being and relationships.

Wait, but the question is about the model's specifics. The options mention various factors. So I think Fiedler's model includes three situational factors. Let me try to remember them. I think they are task structure, leader-member relations, and the leader's position power. 

Task structure refers to how clear and defined the tasks are. If tasks are structured, it's easier for a task-oriented leader to succeed. Leader-member relations are about how well the leader gets along with the team; good relations mean the team is more supportive. Position power is the authority the leader has, like their ability to reward or punish.

So the model says that a leader's effectiveness depends on how their style matches these situational factors. For example, a task-oriented leader might do better in situations where tasks are highly structured and the leader has strong positional power, whereas a relationship-oriented leader might excel in situations with good team relations but less clear tasks.

Looking at the options now. Option D says the effectiveness depends on the interaction between the leader's style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations, and the leader's power. That sounds exactly right.

Option A says effectiveness is due to intelligence and experience, which doesn't fit because Fiedler's model is about style and situation, not individual traits. Option B focuses on motivation, which I don't think is the main point here. Option C claims effectiveness is fixed, but I remember that the model actually suggests that effectiveness can change based on the situation. So C is incorrect.

Option E says it's determined by personality, which again isn't what Fiedler's model is about. F is about communication, which doesn't seem right. G mentions organizational culture, which I don't think is part of Fiedler's original model. H talks about adapting style, which I think is more like situational leadership theory, not Fiedler. I says it's about economic status, which doesn't fit at all.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D. Fiedler's contingency model of leadership suggests that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent on the interaction between their style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations, and the leader's power.

Answer: D
