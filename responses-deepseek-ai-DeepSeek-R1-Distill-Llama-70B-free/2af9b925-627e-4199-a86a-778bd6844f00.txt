Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing when a client uses a service organization. Hmm, I remember that service organizations provide services to other companies, like payroll or data processing. So the user auditor has to consider how this affects their audit plan.

The question is asking which procedure the user auditor should include to make the audit most efficient. The options are A to J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says to rely solely on the service auditor's report without any review or testing. Wait, isn't that risky? I think the user auditor can't just rely blindly because they have to understand the controls at the service organization. Plus, sometimes they might do some testing to make sure everything is okay. So A doesn't sound right.

Option B suggests reviewing the service organization's controls and auditing the client's internal controls. That makes sense because the user auditor needs to check both the client's controls and how they interact with the service organization. But I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way. Maybe there's a more efficient approach.

Option C says to ignore the service organization's processes. That can't be correct because the service organization's controls could affect the client's financial statements. Ignoring them would leave a big gap in the audit.

Option D is about auditing the client's internal controls without considering the service auditor's report. That doesn't seem efficient because the service auditor's report could provide useful information, reducing the need for the user auditor to do more work.

Option E suggests directly auditing the service organization's operations without reviewing their report. That might be time-consuming and less efficient. It's better to use existing reports if possible.

Option F says to review the service auditor’s report on controls placed in operations. Wait, so if the service auditor has already done a report, the user auditor should review it. That could save time because they don't have to audit everything themselves. But what about their own procedures? Maybe they should do some testing too.

Option G is reviewing the service organization's controls without considering the service auditor's report. That would be redundant because the service auditor has already done some work. It's better to use their report to make the process more efficient.

Option H is auditing the service organization’s controls to test the service auditor. That sounds like duplicating efforts. The user auditor's goal is to assess the client's controls, not to audit the service auditor's work.

Option I says to review the service auditor’s report and outline the accounting system in a memo. That seems like a basic step but maybe not the most comprehensive approach. It's part of the process but perhaps not the whole solution.

Option J is auditing the service organization’s controls, assessing risk, and preparing the audit plan. That sounds thorough but maybe not the most efficient. It could involve more work than necessary.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The question is about making the audit most efficient. So the auditor should use the service auditor's report to avoid duplicating work. So they would review that report and then maybe do some testing if needed.

I think the correct approach is to review the service auditor's report to understand the controls at the service organization. Then, the user auditor can assess the risks and decide what, if any, additional procedures are needed. This way, they're using existing information efficiently without redoing the work.

Looking back at the options, F says to review the service auditor’s report on controls. That seems right because it uses the existing report, making the audit more efficient.

Alternatively, option B talks about reviewing the service organization's controls and auditing the client's internal controls. But if there's a service auditor's report, maybe the user auditor doesn't need to review the service organization's controls as thoroughly.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each option means. Option B says the user auditor would review the service organization's controls themselves and also audit the client's internal controls. That could be more work than necessary if the service auditor's report is available.

So the most efficient would be to rely on the service auditor's report, perhaps with some review or testing. But option A says to rely solely without any additional steps, which might not be sufficient. So the correct approach is probably somewhere between A and B.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is F because it involves reviewing the service auditor's report, which is efficient, but does that cover all necessary steps? Or is there another option that includes using the report and doing some additional steps?

Another thought: when a service organization is involved, the user auditor should obtain an understanding of the service organization's controls that are relevant to the client. They can use the service auditor's report for this. So the procedure would include reviewing that report.

So option F says to review the service auditor’s report on controls placed in operations. That aligns with what I was thinking. So the answer should be F.

When a user auditor is dealing with a client that relies on a service organization for certain processes, the goal is to create an efficient audit plan. The most efficient approach involves leveraging existing work, such as the service auditor's report, to avoid duplicating efforts. 

- **Option A** suggests relying solely on the service auditor's report without additional review or testing, which is risky because the user auditor must still assess the relevance and reliability of the report.
- **Option B** involves reviewing the service organization's controls and auditing the client's internal controls, which may be thorough but could be inefficient if the service auditor's report is already available.
- **Option C** ignores the service organization's processes, which is incorrect because the service organization's controls can directly impact the client's financial statements.
- **Option D** focuses solely on the client's internal controls without considering the service auditor's report, which is inefficient because the report could provide valuable insights.
- **Option E** suggests directly auditing the service organization's operations without reviewing the service auditor's report, which is time-consuming and redundant.
- **Option F** involves reviewing the service auditor’s report on controls placed in operations, which is efficient because it leverages the existing report to gain an understanding of the service organization's controls.
- **Option G** involves reviewing the service organization's controls without considering the service auditor's report, which is redundant and inefficient.
- **Option H** focuses on auditing the service organization’s controls to test the service auditor, which is unnecessary and duplicative.
- **Option I** involves reviewing the service auditor’s report and outlining the accounting system in a memo, which is a basic step but not comprehensive.
- **Option J** involves auditing the service organization’s controls, assessing risk, and preparing the audit plan, which is thorough but may involve more work than necessary.

The most efficient approach is to review the service auditor’s report on controls placed in operations, as this leverages existing information and avoids unnecessary duplication of effort. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F**

F
