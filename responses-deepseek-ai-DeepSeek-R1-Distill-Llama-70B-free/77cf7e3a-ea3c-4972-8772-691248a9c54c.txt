Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says that X is uniformly distributed over the set {1, 2, ..., m}, and m is equal to 2^n. So m is a power of two. Then, we're asking random questions like "Is X in S1?", "Is X in S2?", and so on, until only one integer remains. Each subset of {1,2,...,m} is equally likely, meaning each question is about a randomly chosen subset.

The task is to find the probability of error when we ask n + sqrt(n) random questions as n goes to infinity. The error here is defined as having one or more wrong objects remaining, meaning we haven't narrowed it down to just X.

Hmm, okay. So we're using Markov's inequality here. I remember that Markov's inequality is used to bound the probability that a non-negative random variable is greater than or equal to a certain value. The formula is P(Y ≥ a) ≤ E[Y]/a.

So I think the plan is to model the number of remaining elements after asking these questions and find the probability that this number is greater than 1. Because if it's greater than 1, that means we have an error.

Wait, so let me think: each question is a subset S_i. For each element k in {1,2,...,m}, let's define an indicator random variable I_k which is 1 if k is not excluded by any of the questions, and 0 otherwise. Then, the number of remaining elements Y is the sum of I_k from k=1 to m.

So Y = sum_{k=1}^m I_k.

We want P(Y ≥ 2) as the error probability. But using Markov's inequality, P(Y ≥ 2) ≤ E[Y]/2.

Wait, wait. Actually, Markov's inequality says that for any a>0, P(Y ≥ a) ≤ E[Y]/a. So if we set a=2, which is the threshold where we have two or more elements remaining, then P(Y ≥ 2) ≤ E[Y]/2.

But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute E[Y] and then apply Markov's inequality to it.

So let's compute E[Y]. Since Y is the sum of I_k, E[Y] is sum of E[I_k]. Because expectation is linear.

E[I_k] is the probability that the element k is not excluded by any of the questions. Each question is a random subset S_i. For each question, the probability that k is not in S_i is 1/2 because each subset is equally likely, so each element has a 50% chance of being in any subset.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Wait, the way the questions are asked is: each question is a random subset S_i, and if we ask "Is X in S_i?", then if the answer is yes, we keep all elements in S_i, and if the answer is no, we exclude all elements not in S_i. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, no. When you ask a question "Is X in S_i?", and the answer is yes, then you know that X is in S_i, so you can eliminate all elements not in S_i. If the answer is no, you eliminate all elements in S_i. So each question effectively narrows down the possible candidates.

But wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose S_i is a subset. If X is in S_i, then after the question, we know X is in S_i, so the remaining possible elements are the intersection of all the S_i's where the answer was yes and the complement where the answer was no. Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps each question partitions the current set of possible candidates. Each question S_i is a subset, but the way it's applied is that if the answer is yes, then X is in S_i, so we keep S_i. If the answer is no, then X is not in S_i, so we keep the complement of S_i. So each question reduces the possible candidates to either S_i or its complement, each of size m/2 on average.

Wait, but in our setup, all subsets are equally likely. So each question is a random subset S_i, but the process of elimination might depend on the answer.

But perhaps a better approach is to model how each question affects the possible candidates. For each element k, the probability that it remains after each question depends on whether it's consistent with the answers given so far.

Wait, maybe instead of thinking about the process, I should model each I_k as the indicator that element k is not eliminated after all the questions. So for k to remain, it must not have been eliminated by any of the questions.

Wait, no, because each question could either include or exclude the element, depending on the answer. So perhaps for each question S_i, given that the true X is some value, say x, then S_i is a random subset. So for the question "Is X in S_i?", the answer is yes if x is in S_i, and no otherwise.

But for another element k != x, the probability that it's not excluded depends on whether it's in the same S_i as x.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the process for each element k. For each question S_i, if k is in S_i, then if the answer is "yes" (i.e., x is in S_i), then k remains if it's in S_i. If the answer is "no", then since x is not in S_i, but k is in S_i, so k gets eliminated.

Alternatively, if k is not in S_i, then if the answer is "yes", x is in S_i, so since k is not in S_i, it gets excluded. If the answer is "no", then x is not in S_i, so k is not in S_i, so it remains.

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Let me try a different approach. For each question S_i, the probability that element k is not excluded after this question depends on whether k is in S_i and whether the answer was yes or no.

Wait, but perhaps for each question, the probability that k is not excluded is 1/2, because for each question S_i, the answer being yes or no is equally likely, but wait, no. The answer is determined by whether x is in S_i, and x is fixed but unknown. But from the perspective of element k, which is not x, whether it's included or excluded depends on S_i and the answer.

Wait, perhaps each question S_i is a random subset, and for each element k, the probability that k is not excluded by S_i is 1/2. Because for each S_i, the probability that k is in S_i is 1/2, and the answer depends on x. Wait, no, because x is fixed, but we don't know it. So for a given S_i and x, the probability that the answer is yes is 1 if x is in S_i, and 0 otherwise. But since S_i is random, the probability that the answer is yes is 1/2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. For each element k != x, what's the probability that after t questions, it hasn't been excluded? Each question S_i is a random subset, and the answer is yes if x is in S_i, no otherwise.

For k != x, in each question S_i, whether k is in S_i or not is independent of whether x is in S_i, since all subsets are equally likely. So for each question S_i, the probability that k is in S_i is 1/2, and similarly for x.

So for each question, the probability that k is in S_i is 1/2, and the answer being yes or no depends on whether x is in S_i.

Wait, perhaps for each question S_i:

- If x is in S_i, then the answer is yes, so we keep S_i. So any element in S_i remains, others are eliminated.

- If x is not in S_i, the answer is no, so we keep the complement of S_i, which is all elements not in S_i.

So for element k != x, in each question S_i:

- If k is in S_i, then whether it's kept depends on whether x is in S_i. If x is in S_i, then yes, so k remains. If x is not in S_i, then no, so k is excluded.

Similarly, if k is not in S_i, then if the answer is yes, it's excluded, and if no, it's kept.

So the probability that k remains after this question is:

P(k remains) = P( (k in S_i and x in S_i) ) + P( (k not in S_i and x not in S_i) )

Since S_i is a random subset, each element is included with probability 1/2, independent of others. So:

P(k in S_i and x in S_i) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly, P(k not in S_i and x not in S_i) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

So total P(k remains) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

So for each question, the probability that k remains is 1/2. Since the questions are independent, after t questions, the probability that k remains is (1/2)^t.

Wait, but that's for each individual k. So for each k != x, the probability that it hasn't been excluded after t questions is (1/2)^t.

Therefore, the expected number of remaining elements Y is 1 (for x) plus sum_{k != x} (1/2)^t. Since there are m-1 such elements.

So E[Y] = 1 + (m-1)(1/2)^t.

Now, m = 2^n, and t = n + sqrt(n).

So E[Y] = 1 + (2^n - 1) * (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)}.

We can approximate 2^n * (1/2)^{n + sqrt(n)} } = 2^{-sqrt(n)}.

So E[Y] ≈ 1 + 2^{-sqrt(n)}.

But as n approaches infinity, 2^{-sqrt(n)} approaches zero, so E[Y] approaches 1.

Now, we want to find the probability that Y >= 2, which is the same as P(Y >= 2). Using Markov's inequality, P(Y >= 2) <= E[Y]/2.

So E[Y] is approximately 1, so P(Y >= 2) <= 1/2.

Wait, but that's a very loose bound. And as n approaches infinity, E[Y] approaches 1, so the bound approaches 1/2. But that can't be right because the probability of error is actually approaching zero. Because with n + sqrt(n) questions, which is more than enough to narrow down to X.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating E[Y]. Let me re-examine.

Wait, each question reduces the number of possible candidates by half on average, right? Because each question gives a yes/no answer that splits the remaining elements in half. So after t questions, the expected number of remaining elements would be m / 2^t.

Wait, but m is 2^n, so m / 2^t = 2^{n - t}.

In our case, t = n + sqrt(n), so n - t = -sqrt(n).

Thus, E[Y] = 2^{-sqrt(n)}.

Wait, that's different from what I had before. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I confused the approach. Let me think again. Each question partitions the current set into two equal parts, so the expected number of elements after t questions is m / 2^t.

Since m = 2^n, that's 2^{n - t} = 2^{n - (n + sqrt(n))} = 2^{-sqrt(n)}.

So E[Y] = 2^{-sqrt(n)}.

Wait, but earlier I considered that Y includes X, but that might not be the case. Because in each step, X is always in the correct subset, so it's never excluded. So the number of remaining elements after t questions is the size of the intersection of all subsets S_i (if the answer was yes) or their complements (if no). But perhaps the expectation is m / 2^t.

So E[Y] = 2^{n} / 2^{t} = 2^{n - t}.

So with t = n + sqrt(n), E[Y] = 2^{-sqrt(n)}.

So as n approaches infinity, E[Y] approaches zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because when t is n, E[Y] would be 1, as 2^{n - n} = 1. So for t > n, it's less than 1.

Wait, but that would mean that E[Y] is 2^{-sqrt(n)}, which approaches zero as n increases.

Wait, but then when applying Markov's inequality, P(Y >= 1) <= E[Y], but that's not helpful because we want P(Y >= 2).

Wait, perhaps I should think of Y as the number of wrong elements remaining, so Y = Y' - 1, where Y' includes X. Or maybe Y is the number of elements remaining, including X, so Y >= 2 means at least one wrong element remains.

Hmm, perhaps I should model Y as the number of elements remaining, which includes X. Then, the error is Y >= 2, so P(Y >= 2) = P(Y > 1).

But using Markov, P(Y >= 2) <= E[Y]/2.

So E[Y] is 2^{-sqrt(n)} as n approaches infinity, which tends to zero. So P(Y >= 2) <= something that tends to zero. Therefore, the probability of error tends to zero.

Wait, but wait, when t = n, E[Y] = 1, so P(Y >= 2) <= 1/2. But when t is larger, like n + sqrt(n), E[Y] becomes 2^{-sqrt(n)}, which goes to zero. So P(Y >= 2) <= 2^{-sqrt(n)} / 2 = 2^{-sqrt(n) -1}, which tends to zero as n grows.

So as n approaches infinity, the probability of error tends to zero.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.0.

But wait, the question says to use Markov's inequality to find the probability. So I think the answer is that the probability tends to zero, so the correct option is D.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the number of remaining elements after asking \( t = n + \sqrt{n} \) random questions. Let \( Y \) represent the number of elements remaining, including the true value \( X \). The goal is to find the probability of error, defined as \( P(Y \geq 2) \), which corresponds to having one or more wrong objects remaining.

### Key Steps:
1. **Expected Number of Remaining Elements**:  
   Each question reduces the number of possible candidates by half on average. Thus, the expected number of remaining elements after \( t \) questions is:  
   \[
   E[Y] = \frac{m}{2^t}
   \]  
   where \( m = 2^n \). Substituting \( t = n + \sqrt{n} \), we get:  
   \[
   E[Y] = \frac{2^n}{2^{n + \sqrt{n}}} = 2^{-\sqrt{n}}
   \]  
   As \( n \to \infty \), \( 2^{-\sqrt{n}} \to 0 \).

2. **Applying Markov's Inequality**:  
   Markov's inequality states that for any non-negative random variable \( Y \) and \( a > 0 \):  
   \[
   P(Y \geq a) \leq \frac{E[Y]}{a}
   \]  
   Setting \( a = 2 \) to bound \( P(Y \geq 2) \), we have:  
   \[
   P(Y \geq 2) \leq \frac{E[Y]}{2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( E[Y] = 2^{-\sqrt{n}} \), we get:  
   \[
   P(Y \geq 2) \leq \frac{2^{-\sqrt{n}}}{2} = 2^{-(\sqrt{n} + 1)}
   \]  
   As \( n \to \infty \), \( 2^{-(\sqrt{n} + 1)} \to 0 \).

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The probability of error, \( P(Y \geq 2) \), approaches zero as \( n \to \infty \). This means that the probability of having one or more wrong objects remaining becomes negligible.

### Final Answer:
The probability of error tends to zero as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, the correct option is:

**D: 0.0**
