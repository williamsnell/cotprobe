Okay, I'm trying to solve this geology problem about dating a rock sample using radioactive testing. So, the sample contains a lot of ^40Ar, and I need to find out the age of the sample. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with radiometric dating, probably the potassium-argon method. 

Let me read the problem again. The sample has 3% potassium (K) by weight, and there's a certain amount of ^40Ar. The data given is 95.0 × 10^-7 m^3/kg of ^40Ar at STP. Also, the ratio of ^40Ar to ^36Ar is 75,200. Oh, and the percent abundance of ^40K is 0.0118. 

First, I think I should recall the decay process. Potassium-40 (^40K) decays into argon-40 (^40Ar) with a half-life of about 1.25 billion years. The formula I remember for radioactive decay is N = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But since it's a decay chain, maybe I should use the formula that relates the amount of daughter product to the parent. 

Wait, right! The formula for the amount of ^40Ar produced from ^40K decay is:

[^40Ar] = ([^40K]_initial) * (1 - e^(-λt)) * (ratio of isotopes)

But wait, maybe I should think differently. Since the sample has both ^40Ar and ^36Ar, perhaps I can use the ratio to find the amount of ^40K that has decayed.

Alternatively, another approach: the ratio of ^40Ar to ^36Ar can help determine the amount of radiogenic argon. Because ^36Ar is a stable isotope and its abundance is primordial, while the high ^40Ar/^36Ar ratio suggests that most of the ^40Ar comes from decay, not the atmosphere.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think step by step.

1. Calculate the amount of potassium in the sample.
The sample is 3% K by weight. But wait, the sample's mass isn't given, but the ^40Ar is given per kg of sample. So perhaps I should consider the sample as 1 kg for simplicity. That would make calculations easier. So, 3% K means 0.03 kg of K per kg of sample.

2. Find the moles of K in the sample.
The molar mass of K is about 39.1 g/mol. So for 0.03 kg (30 grams), moles of K would be 30 / 39.1 ≈ 0.767 moles.

3. Determine the moles of ^40K.
The abundance of ^40K is 0.0118 (1.18%), so moles of ^40K = 0.767 * 0.0118 ≈ 0.00906 moles.

4. Calculate the amount of ^40Ar produced.
I know that ^40K decays into ^40Ar. The decay equation is ^40K → ^40Ar + e^- (beta decay). So each mole of ^40K that decays produces one mole of ^40Ar.

But first, I need to find out how much ^40Ar is present. The sample has 95.0 × 10^-7 m^3/kg of ^40Ar at STP. Wait, m^3 per kg? That's a bit odd. Oh, right, STP volume.

Wait, at STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters, which is 0.0224 m^3. So to find moles, I can use the volume.

So for 1 kg of sample, volume of ^40Ar is 95e-7 m³. Molar volume at STP is 0.0224 m³/mol. So moles of Ar = 95e-7 / 0.0224 ≈ let me compute that. 

Wait, 95e-7 is 9.5e-6 m³. So 9.5e-6 / 0.0224 = approximately 4.24e-4 moles of ^40Ar.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately. 95e-7 is 0.00000095 m³. So 0.00000095 / 0.0224 ≈ 4.2373e-5 mol? Wait, wait, wait. No, 95e-7 m³ is 9.5e-6 m³. So 9.5e-6 / 0.0224 ≈ (9.5 / 0.0224) ) * 1e-6 → 424.11 * 1e-6 → 4.24e-4 moles.

Wait, 0.0224 m³ is per mole. So 9.5e-6 m³ is 9.5e-6 / 0.0224 = (9.5 / 22400) ≈ 0.000424 mol, which is 4.24e-4 moles of Ar-40.

But wait, the ratio of ^40Ar to ^36Ar is 75,200. So the amount of ^40Ar is 75200 times the ^36Ar. So, the total Ar is ^40Ar + ^36Ar. Let me denote ^36Ar as x, so ^40Ar = 75,200 x.

So total Ar is 75,200x + x = 75,201 x.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet. Alternatively, since the ^40Ar/^36Ar ratio is so high, maybe the ^36Ar is negligible compared to ^40Ar, but perhaps it's better to account for it.

Wait, but the problem states that the sample contains a substantial quantity of ^40Ar, so maybe the atmospheric contamination is minimal, but I'm not entirely sure. But perhaps, in this case, the ^40Ar measured is all radiogenic, but I think that's a simplification. Alternatively, perhaps the ^36Ar is the atmospheric component. Because in the atmosphere, the ratio of ^40Ar to ^36Ar is about 295:1. So if the sample has a ratio much higher than that, it indicates that most of the ^40Ar is from decay, not atmospheric contamination.

Wait, the ratio given is 75,200, which is way higher than the atmospheric ratio of ~295. So the ^36Ar is probably from the atmosphere, and the ^40Ar is mostly radiogenic.

So, to find the amount of radiogenic ^40Ar, perhaps we can subtract the atmospheric component. But another approach is to use the known ratio to find the amount of ^40Ar produced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ^36Ar in the sample is from the atmosphere, and the ^40Ar is a mix of atmospheric and radiogenic. But considering the high ratio, the atmospheric contribution to ^40Ar is negligible. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that all the ^40Ar measured is radiogenic, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but to be precise, let's think: the sample would have some atmospheric argon trapped when it formed. So the ^40Ar in the sample is the sum of the atmospheric ^40Ar and the radiogenic ^40Ar. Similarly, the ^36Ar is all from the atmosphere, assuming no primordial ^36Ar from the sample. So, the ratio of (^40Ar_total) / (^36Ar) = 75,200. 

Atmospheric argon has a ^40Ar/^36Ar ratio of about 295. So, let me model it.

Let’s say the sample has some trapped Ar with atmospheric composition, so:

Let’s denote:

- [^40Ar_total] = [^40Ar_r] + [^40Ar_atm]

- [^36Ar] = [^36Ar_atm]

Given that, the ratio [^40Ar_total]/[^36Ar] = 75200.

But the atmospheric ratio is [^40Ar_atm]/[^36Ar_atm] = 295. So [^40Ar_atm] = 295 * [^36Ar_atm].

So substituting into the first equation:

[^40Ar_r] + 295 [^36Ar_atm] = 75200 [^36Ar_atm]

Which gives:

[^40Ar_r] = (75200 - 295) [^36Ar_atm] = 74905 [^36Ar_atm]

So [^40Ar_r] = 74905 [^36Ar_atm]

But [^36Ar] is all atmospheric, so [^36Ar] = [^36Ar_atm] = x.

So [^40Ar_r] = 74905 x.

But wait, the amount of ^40Ar in the sample is [^40Ar_total] = 75200 x.

But we measured [^40Ar_total] as 4.24e-4 moles (from earlier calculation). So:

4.24e-4 mol = 75200 x → x = 4.24e-4 / 75200 ≈ 5.63e-9 mol.

So [^40Ar_r] = 74905 x = 74905 * 5.63e-9 ≈ let's compute that.

74905 *5.63e-9 → 74905 *5.63 is approx 422,400, so 422,400e-9 → 4.224e-4 mol. Wait, but that's the same as the [^40Ar_total], which can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Let's calculate more carefully.

x = [^36Ar] = 4.24e-4 / 75200 → 4.24e-4 / 7.52e4 → approximately 5.63e-9 mol.

Then [^40Ar_r] = 74905 * x → 74905 *5.63e-9 = let's compute that.

74905 *5.63e-9 = (70000 *5.63e-9) + (4905 *5.63e-9) 

70000 *5.63e-9 = 3.941e-4

4905 *5.63e-9 ≈ approx 4905*5.63 ≈ 27650 → 27650e-9 = 2.765e-5.

Adding together: 3.941e-4 + 2.765e-5 = 4.2175e-4 mol.

Hmm, so the radiogenic ^40Ar is about 4.2175e-4 moles.

Wait, but earlier I thought the total ^40Ar is 4.24e-4 moles, so that makes sense because the atmospheric contribution is only a tiny fraction. So perhaps it's a small correction, but for precise calculation, I should include it.

But maybe for the purpose of this problem, they assume that all the ^40Ar is radiogenic. Or perhaps there's a simpler way. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to ignore the ^36Ar and just use the given ^40Ar.

Wait, let me think: in K-Ar dating, the formula used is:

t = (1/λ) * ln( [^40Ar*/( ^40K) ] + 1 )

Where ^40Ar* is the radiogenic argon.

So I need to find the amount of ^40Ar* produced, which is the amount of ^40K that has decayed.

But first, I need to calculate the moles of ^40K present initially.

Wait, but wait: the sample has 3% K, so 0.03 kg per kg sample. Molar mass K is 39.1 g/mol → 30 g /39.1 g/mol ≈0.767 mol K.

But the abundance of ^40K is 0.0118 (1.18%), so initial moles of ^40K is 0.767 * 0.0118 ≈0.00906 mol.

Now, over time t, some of this ^40K decays into ^40Ar. Let N be the moles of ^40K remaining, and N0 is initial moles.

N = N0 * e^(-λt)

The moles of ^40Ar produced is N0 - N = N0 (1 - e^(-λt)).

But wait, the moles of ^40Ar found is 4.24e-4 (but wait, I thought that was the total, but perhaps after correction, it's 4.2175e-4, but maybe I can proceed with the initial number for approximation).

Wait, but let me clarify:

The moles of ^40Ar* (radiogenic) is 4.2175e-4 mol.

So:

4.2175e-4 = 0.00906 * (1 - e^(-λt))

I need to solve for t.

But λ is the decay constant, which is ln(2)/half-life.

The half-life of ^40K is 1.25e9 years.

So λ = 0.693 / 1.25e9 → approx 5.544e-10 yr^-1.

So plugging into the equation:

4.2175e-4 = 0.00906 (1 - e^(-5.544e-10 * t))

Let me compute 0.00906 * (1 - e^(-λ t)) ≈ 4.2175e-4.

Divide both sides by 0.00906:

(1 - e^(-λ t)) ≈ (4.2175e-4) / 0.00906 → approx 0.0465.

So 1 - e^(-λ t) ≈ 0.0465 → e^(-λ t) ≈ 1 - 0.0465 = 0.9535.

Take natural log of both sides:

-λ t = ln(0.9535) → approx -0.0475.

So t = 0.0475 / λ → 0.0475 / (5.544e-10) → approx 8.57e8 years. Wait, that's 857 million years. But the options are all around 6-10 billion years. Hmm, something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, I have 4.2175e-4 mol of ^40Ar*, and 0.00906 mol of ^40K initially.

So:

^40Ar* = 0.00906 * (1 - e^{-λ t} )

So 4.2175e-4 = 0.00906 (1 - e^{-λ t})

Divide both sides by 0.00906:

(4.2175e-4) / 0.00906 ≈ 0.0465 → so 1 - e^{-λ t} = 0.0465 → e^{-λ t} = 0.9535.

Take ln: -λ t = ln(0.9535) ≈ -0.0475 → t = 0.0475 / λ.

Compute λ: 0.693 / 1.25e9 → 5.544e-10 per year.

t = 0.0475 / 5.544e-10 → 0.0475 / 5.544 ≈ 8.57 → 8.57e9 years? Wait, wait, 0.0475 / 5.544e-10 → 0.0475 / 5.544 * 1e10 → (0.0475/5.544)= approx 0.00857 → 0.00857 *1e10 → 8.57e8 years, which is 857 million years.

But the options are in 6-10 billion years. So clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moles of ^40Ar. Let me go back.

The volume of ^40Ar is given as 95.0 × 10^-7 m^3/kg. So per kg of sample, it's 95e-7 m³.

Convert that to moles: at STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L → 0.0224 m³.

So moles = volume / molar volume → 95e-7 m³ / 0.0224 m³/mol → 95e-7 / 0.0224 → let's compute that.

95e-7 = 9.5e-6 m³.

9.5e-6 / 0.0224 = approx 4.2373e-4 moles.

Wait, so 4.2373e-4 mol. But earlier I considered that this was the total ^40Ar, but with the ratio, I calculated that the radiogenic ^40Ar is about 4.2175e-4 mol. So the difference is negligible. So perhaps I can proceed with 4.2373e-4 as the amount of ^40Ar*.

Wait, but that would change the calculation slightly.

So:

4.2373e-4 = 0.00906 * (1 - e^{-λ t})

Then (1 - e^{-λ t}) = 4.2373e-4 / 0.00906 ≈ 0.0468 → e^{-λ t} = 0.9532.

ln(0.9532)= approx -0.0477 → t=0.0477/λ.

λ is 0.693/(1.25e9) ≈5.544e-10 per year.

So t=0.0477 /5.544e-10 → 0.0477 /5.544 ≈0.00861 → 0.00861e10 → 8.61e8 years → 861 million years.

Still, that's way off from the options given, which are in the billions.

Hmm, what's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles of K.

Wait, the sample is 3% K by weight. So per kg sample, 0.03 kg of K. K's molar mass is 39.1 g/mol, so 30g is 30/39.1 ≈0.767 mol.

But the abundance of ^40K is 0.0118, so moles of ^40K is 0.767 * 0.0118 ≈ 0.00906 mol. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the ^40Ar is not all from ^40K decay. Oh, wait, but that's the point of K-Ar dating. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe I should use the decay equation correctly.

The formula for the age is:

t = (1/λ) * ln( ([^40Ar*]/[^40K]) + 1 )

Because [^40Ar*] = ^40K_initial
