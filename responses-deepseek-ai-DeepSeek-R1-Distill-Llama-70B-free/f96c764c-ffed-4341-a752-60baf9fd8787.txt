Okay, so I have this problem about setting up a scholarship fund, and I need to find out how much money is needed to establish it. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says there are twenty scholarships, each worth $1,000. The fund is supposed to last for twenty years, and the annual interest rate is 5%. Hmm, so I think this is a present value problem where I need to calculate the initial amount needed so that it can provide those scholarships each year without running out.

Wait, right, the scholarships are probably paid annually. That means each year, the fund gives out $1,000. But since there are twenty scholarships each year, is it $1,000 per scholarship or in total? Oh, wait the wording says twenty scholarships of $1,000 each, so I think that's $20,000 each year. So each year, $20,000 is needed.

Wait, no. Wait, let me read it again. "twenty scholarships of $1,000 each." Oh, wait, does that mean 20 scholarships a year, each for $1,000? If so, that's 20 * 1,000 = $20,000 per year. So the fund needs to pay out $20,000 annually for twenty years.

So the problem is: find the present value (PV) of an annuity that pays $20,000 each year for 20 years, with an annual interest rate of 5%. 

I remember there's a formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity. The formula is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where PMT is the annual payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

So plugging in the numbers: PMT is $20,000, r is 5% or 0.05, and n is 20 years.

Let me calculate the present value factor first. The factor is (1 - (1 + 0.05)^-20) / 0.05.

Calculating (1.05)^-20. Hmm, 1.05^20 is about e^(20 * ln(1.05)) ). Let me approximate that. Or maybe I should remember that 1.05^20 is approximately 2.6533. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 1.05^20 is 2.6533? No, that's 1.05^20 is about 2.6533? Wait, no, that's not right. Because 1.05^10 is about 1.6289, so 1.05^20 would be (1.6289)^2, which is about 2.6533. So 1/(1.05^20) is about 1/2.6533, which is approximately 0.3769.

So, 1 - 0.3769 = 0.6231. Then, divide by 0.05: 0.6231 / 0.05 = 12.462. So the present value factor is 12.462.

Then, multiply by the annual payment, which is 20,000. So 20,000 * 12.462 = 249,240. Wait, that can't be right because the options are way lower. Oh wait, wait a second! Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, wait. The PMT in the formula is the annual payment. So I said PMT is 20,000, so 20,000 * 12.462 is indeed 249,240. But looking at the answer options, the highest is E:30,000, which is way lower than 249k. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read it. The Argo Scholarship Fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each. Oh wait, maybe it's $1,000 per year for each of the twenty years? So each year, they give out twenty scholarships, each of $1,000. So each year, the payout is 1,000 * 20 = 20,000. So that's correct.

But that would require a present value of 20,000 * 12.462 = 249,240. But none of the options are near that. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the 5% is the annual interest rate, but maybe the problem is considering simple interest, not compound. Hmm, but the standard approach for such problems is to use compound interest, especially over a period as long as 20 years. 

Alternatively, perhaps I got the PMT wrong. Maybe each year, only one scholarship is given, but that's 20 scholarships over 20 years. No, the problem says twenty scholarships of $1,000 each. So each year, they give 20 scholarships of $1k. So 20k per year.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that it's an annuity due, but that's a different calculation. No, the problem doesn't specify when the payments are made, so I think ordinary annuity is correct.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me check the present value of an ordinary annuity (PVOA) formula. Yes, it's correct: PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r].

Wait, but maybe I'm using the wrong interest rate. The rate is 5%, so 0.05. Hmm.

Wait another possibility: the present value factor is 12.462, and the PMT is 20,000, so 20,000 * 12.462 is indeed 249,240. But no option is close. So perhaps the problem is that each year, the payment is $1,000, not $20,000. Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement.

"The Argo Scholarship Fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each." Hmm, maybe that's twenty scholarships in total, each $1,000, spread over 20 years. So each year, they give one scholarship of $1,000. So that's 1,000 per year for 20 years.

Oh! Oh, I think I made a mistake there. Because if it's twenty scholarships, each $1,000, but spread over twenty years, that would be one per year. So the annual payment is $1,000, not $20,000.

That makes more sense. Because then the present value would be 1,000 * 12.462 = 12,462, which is option A.

Wait, but does the problem state that the twenty scholarships are given each year? Or are they given over the twenty years? Let me read the problem again.

It says the fund consists of twenty scholarships of $1,000 each. It's to last for twenty years. So it's twenty scholarships over twenty years, implying one per year. So each year, the fund pays $1,000. So PMT is 1,000, not 20,000.

Ah, that's where I went wrong. So the correct PMT is $1,000 per year.

So let's recalculate. PMT = 1,000. The present value factor is 12.462 as before. So PV = 1,000 * 12.462 = 12,462.

Looking at the options, option A is $12,462.

So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the amount needed to establish the Argo Scholarship Fund, we calculate the present value of an ordinary annuity. The fund must provide 20 scholarships of $1,000 each, spread over 20 years, with an annual interest rate of 5%. This implies an annual payment (PMT) of $1,000.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

\[
PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( PMT = 1,000 \) (annual payment),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 20 \) (number of years).

First, calculate the present value factor:

\[
\frac{1 - (1 + 0.05)^{-20}}{0.05} = \frac{1 - 0.3769}{0.05} = \frac{0.6231}{0.05} \approx 12.462
\]

Now, multiply the present value factor by the annual payment:

\[
PV = 1,000 \times 12.462 = 12,462
\]

Thus, the amount needed to establish the fund is $12,462. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**A: $12,462**
