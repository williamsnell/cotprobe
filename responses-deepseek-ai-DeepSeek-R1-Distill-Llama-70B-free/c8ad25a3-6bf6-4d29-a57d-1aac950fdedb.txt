Okay, so I'm trying to solve this equation using the Birge-Vieta method. The equation is x^5 - x + 1 = 0, and I'm given p = -1.5. Hmm, I remember that the Birge-Vieta method is used to find real roots, probably by some kind of iterative process. Wait, I think it's similar to the Newton-Raphson method but maybe with a different approach.

First, I should probably recall how the Birge-Vieta method works. From what I remember, it's a method that uses a sequence of functions to approximate the root. It starts with an initial guess and then iteratively improves the approximation. The formula might involve the function and its derivative, or perhaps it's a different setup.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another method. Oh right, I think the Birge-Vieta method is also known as the Vieta method, where you rewrite the equation into a form that can be iteratively solved. Let me think. For example, for an equation like f(x) = 0, you express x in terms of the other terms and then iterate.

So, the given equation is x^5 - x + 1 = 0. Let me rearrange this to express x in terms of itself. Hmm, maybe I can write x^5 = x - 1, so x would be the fifth root of (x - 1). But that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can factor it or find a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the method involves taking the nth root of the function. Oh wait, maybe it's similar to the method of false position or the secant method, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should check the initial guess. The given p is -1.5, so that's our starting point. Let's compute f(p) first. f(-1.5) is (-1.5)^5 - (-1.5) +1. Let me calculate that.

(-1.5)^5: 1.5^5 is 7.59375, but with a negative sign because it's odd power, so -7.59375. Then subtract (-1.5) which is +1.5, and add 1. So total f(-1.5) = -7.59375 +1.5 +1 = (-7.59375 + 2.5) = -5.09375. So f(-1.5) is negative.

Now I need another point to apply the method. Wait, perhaps I should choose another x value to see where the function crosses zero. Let me try x=0: f(0)=0^5 -0 +1=1, which is positive. So between x=-1.5 and x=0, the function goes from negative to positive, meaning there's a root in that interval.

So our initial interval is [-1.5, 0]. The Birge-Vieta method, I think, uses the function values at the endpoints to compute the next approximation. Let me recall the formula. I think it's something like the next point is calculated as x_new = (f(a)*b - f(b)*a)/(f(a)-f(b)), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, that sounds more like the secant method. Or maybe it's x_new = (a f(b) - b f(a))/(f(b) - f(a)).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is x1 = a - f(a)*(b - a)/(f(b)-f(a)), which is the secant method. So maybe I'm mixing up the methods. But given that the question specifies the Birge-Vieta method, I think I should proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps the Birge-Vieta method is the same as the method of chords or the secant method. Alternatively, maybe it's another name for the same thing. Let me proceed with the assumption that it's similar to the secant method.

So, using the secant method, the next approximation is given by x_new = x1 - f(x1)*(x1 - x0)/(f(x1)-f(x0)). Wait, no, the standard secant formula is x_new = x1 - f(x1)*(x1 -x0)/(f(x1)-f(x0)).

But wait, I'm getting f(x0) and f(x1) to compute the next point. So given that we have a=-1.5 and b=0, f(a)= -5.09375, f(b)=1.

So applying the secant formula, x2 = b - f(b)*(b - a)/(f(b)-f(a)).

Plugging the numbers: x2 = 0 - 1*(0 - (-1.5))/(1 - (-5.09375)).

Wait, wait. The formula is x2 = a - f(a)*(b - a)/(f(b)-f(a)).

So using a=-1.5, f(a)=-5.09375, b=0, f(b)=1.

So x2 = (-1.5) - (-5.09375)*(0 - (-1.5))/(1 - (-5.09375)).

Calculating denominator: 1 +5.09375 = 6.09375.

Numerator for the fraction: (0 - (-1.5))=1.5, so 1.5 * (-5.09375) would be -7.640625. But since f(a) is negative, the formula becomes:

x2 = a - (f(a) * (b -a )) / (f(b) -f(a)).

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

x2 = a - [f(a)*(b -a)] / (f(b) - f(a)).

So substituting:

a = -1.5, f(a)=-5.09375, b=0, f(b)=1.

So x2 = (-1.5) - [ (-5.09375) * (0 - (-1.5)) ] / (1 - (-5.09375)).

Let's compute numerator: (-5.09375) * (1.5) = -7.640625.

Denominator: 1 +5.09375=6.09375.

So [ (-5.09375) * 1.5 ] / 6.09375 = (-7.640625)/6.09375 ≈ -1.25390625.

So x2 = -1.5 - (-1.25390625) = -1.5 +1.25390625 = -0.24609375.

Wait, that's a positive value? Wait, no, wait: 1.2539 is less than 1.5, so subtracting a negative would be adding.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, the formula: x2 = a - [f(a)*(b -a)] / (f(b)-f(a)).

So a is -1.5, and [f(a)*(b -a)] is (-5.09375)*(0 - (-1.5))= (-5.09375)*(1.5)= -7.640625.

Denominator is (f(b)-f(a)) = 1 - (-5.09375) = 6.09375.

So [f(a)*(b -a)] / (f(b)-f(a)) = (-7.640625)/(6.09375) ≈ -1.25390625.

So x2 = a - (-1.2539) = (-1.5) + 1.2539 ≈ -0.2461.

So x2 is approximately -0.2461.

Wait, but that would be the next approximation. Now I need to check f(x2) to see if it's closer to zero.

Compute f(-0.2461): (-0.2461)^5 - (-0.2461) +1.

Let me compute each term:

(-0.2461)^5: since it's an odd power, it'll be negative. Let's approximate:

0.2461 ≈ 0.25.

0.25^5 = 1/(4^5) )= 1/1024 ≈ 0.0009765625, but negative: -0.0009766.

Then, - (-0.2461) is +0.2461.

So adding up: (-0.0009766) + 0.2461 +1 = approximately 1.2451234.

Wait, that's still positive. But f(-0.2461)=~1.245, which is positive. So now our interval is from x=-1.5 (f=-5.09) to x=-0.2461 (f=1.245), so the root lies between -1.5 and -0.2461, since f changes sign there.

Wait, no: wait, f(-1.5)= -5.09 and f(-0.2461)=1.245, so the root is between them. So next step, we take a=-1.5, b=-0.2461.

Wait, no, in the secant method, the new interval is [x1, x2], but I think I'm using the secant method here instead of Birge-Vieta. Maybe I should proceed correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute the next iteration.

So now, a=-1.5, f(a)=-5.09375.

x2=-0.2461, f(x2)=~1.245.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Because earlier, when I computed f(-0.2461), I got approximately 1.245, which is positive.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation because that seems high. Let me compute f(-0.2461) more accurately.

Compute each term:

x = -0.2461.

x^5: (-0.2461)^5 = (-0.2461) * (-0.2461)^4.

First, (-0.2461)^2 = 0.0605, approximately.

Then, (-0.2461)^4 = (0.0605)^2 ≈ 0.00366.

So (-0.2461)^5 = (-0.2461) * 0.00366 ≈ -0.000900.

Then, -x = 0.2461.

So f(x) = x^5 - x +1 ≈ (-0.0009) - (-0.2461) +1 = (-0.0009 +0.2461) +1 = 0.2452 +1 = 1.2452.

So yes, f(x2)=1.2452, which is positive.

So the next step is to take x2 as the new point, and since f(x2) is positive, our new interval is from a=-1.5 (f=-5.09) to b=x2=-0.2461 (f=1.2452).

Wait, but in the secant method, the next iteration uses the last two points. So in this case, the two points are x0=-1.5 and x1=x2=-0.2461. But f(x0)=-5.09, f(x1)=1.2452.

Wait, no, actually, in the secant method, each new x is computed based on the last two points. So perhaps x2 is the new x, and the next step would compute x3 based on x1 and x2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First iteration: x0 = -1.5, f(x0)=-5.09375.

We take x1=0, f(x1)=1. But f(x0) and f(x1) have opposite signs, so the root is between x0 and x1. Using the secant method, the next point is x2 = x1 - f(x1)*(x1 -x0)/(f(x1)-f(x0)).

Plugging the numbers: x2=0 - 1*(0 - (-1.5))/(1 - (-5.09375)).

So denominator is 6.09375, numerator of the fraction is 1.5.

So x2=0 - (1 * 1.5)/6.09375 = - (1.5/6.09375) ≈ -0.24609375.

Which is what I did earlier. Now, f(x2)=1.2452.

So the next iteration would be using x1=x2=-0.24609375 and x0=0, f(x0)=1. Wait, but that can't be right because f(x0) is 1 and f(x1)=1.2452, which are both positive, so the root isn't between them. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in choosing the next interval.

Wait, no. The root is between x=-1.5 and x=x2, because f(-1.5)=-5.09 and f(x2)=1.2452. So the next interval should be x=-1.5 and x=x2=-0.2461.

Wait, but in the secant method, you only need the two most recent points. So the next step would be to take x2 and x1 (which is 0), but that's not correct because the function values at x1 and x2 are both positive, so the root isn't between them. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the intervals.

Alternatively, maybe I should take x2=-0.2461 as the new point, and since f(x2) is positive, the next interval is between x=-1.5 (negative) and x=x2 (positive). So the next iteration would use a=-1.5 and b=x2=-0.2461.

So now, a=-1.5, f(a)=-5.09375.

b=-0.2461, f(b)=1.2452.

Now compute x3 using the secant formula again.

x3 = b - f(b)*(b - a)/(f(b)-f(a)).

So substituting:

x3 = (-0.2461) - (1.2452)*( (-0.2461) - (-1.5) ) / (1.2452 - (-5.09375)).

Simplify numerator: (-0.2461 +1.5) =1.2539. So (1.2452)*(1.2539)= approx 1.2452*1.2539≈1.561.

Denominator: 1.2452 +5.09375≈6.33895.

So (1.2452*1.2539)/(6.33895) ≈1.561 /6.33895≈0.2464.

So x3= (-0.2461) - 0.2464 ≈-0.4925.

Wait, that's x3≈-0.4925. Now compute f(x3).

f(-0.4925)= (-0.4925)^5 - (-0.4925) +1.

Compute each term:

(-0.4925)^5: Let's approximate.

0.4925 is about 0.5, so 0.5^5=0.03125. So (-0.4925)^5≈-0.0311 (since 0.4925 is slightly less than 0.5, so the fifth power would be a bit less than 0.03125).

Then, -(-0.4925)=0.4925.

So f(x3)= (-0.0311) +0.4925 +1 ≈ 1.4614.

Wait, that's still positive. So f(x3)=1.4614.

Wait, that can't be right. Because between a=-1.5 (f=-5.09) and x3=-0.4925 (f=1.46), the function changes sign, so the root is between them.

So the next iteration would take a=-1.5 and b=x3=-0.4925.

Compute x4 using the secant method.

x4 = b - f(b)*(b -a)/(f(b)-f(a)).

So substituting:

b=-0.4925, f(b)=1.4614.

a=-1.5, f(a)=-5.09375.

So numerator: (b -a)= (-0.4925 +1.5)=1.0075.

f(b)=1.4614.

So (f(b)*(b -a))=1.4614 *1.0075≈1.4714.

Denominator: f(b)-f(a)=1.4614 - (-5.09375)=6.55515.

So x4 = (-0.4925) - (1.4714 /6.55515) ≈-0.4925 - 0.2245 ≈-0.717.

Wait, wait, let me compute 1.4714/6.55515.

1.4714 ÷6.55515 ≈0.2245.

So x4= -0.4925 - 0.2245= -0.717.

Now compute f(-0.717).

f(-0.717)= (-0.717)^5 - (-0.717) +1.

Compute each term:

(-0.717)^5: Let's approximate.

0.7^5=0.16807, so 0.717^5 is a bit higher. Let's say approximately 0.717^2≈0.514, then 0.514*(0.717)^3. 0.717^3≈0.717*0.514≈0.368. So 0.514*0.368≈0.189. Then 0.189*0.717≈0.1356, but since it's the fifth power, wait, perhaps better to compute step by step.

Alternatively, let me compute 0.717^2=0.514.

0.717^3=0.514 *0.717≈0.3689.

0.717^4=0.3689 *0.717≈0.2653.

0.717^5=0.2653 *0.717≈0.1905.

So (-0.717)^5≈-0.1905.

Then, -(-0.717)=0.717.

So f(-0.717)= -0.1905 +0.717 +1≈1.5265.

Wait, that's positive again. So f(x4)=1.5265.

Hmm, so between a=-1.5 (f=-5.09) and x4=-0.717 (f=1.5265), the function changes sign. So the root is in this interval.

So compute x5 using the secant method.

x5 = x4 - f(x4)*(x4 - a)/(f(x4)-f(a)).

Substituting:

x4=-0.717, f
