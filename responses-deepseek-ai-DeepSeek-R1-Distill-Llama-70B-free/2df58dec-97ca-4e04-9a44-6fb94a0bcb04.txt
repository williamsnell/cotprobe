Question:

A business started last year with an inventory of 90,000 items which cost $60,000 and had a selling price of $80,000, At the end of the year, the inventory consisted of 70,000 items which cost $90,000 and had a selling price of $120,000.

Okay, so I've got this question about stock turnover rates, and I need to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can break it down.

The question gives me data about a business's inventory over a year. Let me list out the information:

- Starting inventory: 90,000 items costing $60,000. So the cost per item is $60,000 / 90,000 = $0.6667 each. Selling price was $80,000, so selling per item is $80,000 /90,000 ≈ $0.8889.

Wait, but maybe I don't need per item costs; perhaps I should think in terms of total costs and sales.

At the end of the year, the inventory is 70,000 items costing $90,000. So their cost per item is $90,000 /70,000 ≈ $1.2857. Selling price is $120,000, so per item selling price is about $120,000 /70,000 ≈ $1.7143.

But maybe I don't need per-unit values. Let's look at what's sold.

During the year, 360,000 items were sold. Their cost was $300,000, so cost per item sold is $300,000 /360,000 = $0.8333. Net sales were $380,000, so selling price per item is $380,000 /360,000 ≈ $1.0556.

Wait, but the stock turnover rate is usually calculated as cost of goods sold divided by average inventory at cost. Alternatively, sometimes using sales divided by average inventory at selling price. Or just units sold divided by average units in inventory.

So there are three turnover rates here: at cost, at selling price, and in units.

Let me start by finding the average inventory for each of these.

For the cost:

Starting inventory cost was $60,000, ending is $90,000. Average inventory at cost would be (60,000 + 90,000)/2 = $75,000.

Cost of goods sold (COGS) is $300,000. So stockturn rate at cost is COGS / average inventory cost. So 300,000 /75,000 = 4.0.

Hmm, that's one of the options, I think. Let me check the options to see which ones have 4.0 for cost.

Looking at the options:

Option J: Cost is 4.0, selling price 3.8, units 4.5.

Option B: Cost 4.5.

Option A: Cost 2.5.

Option E: Cost 3.5.

So, possible that at cost it's 4.0, which is in option J.

Now, for the selling price turnover. Let's see.

Starting inventory at selling price was $80,000, ending was $120,000. Average selling price inventory is (80,000 +120,000)/2 = 100,000.

Net sales were $380,000. So stockturn rate at selling price is 380,000 /100,000 = 3.8.

Hmm, that's 3.8. So in option J, that's exactly what it says: 4.0, 3.8, and units.

Wait, but let me not jump to conclusions. Let's check the units turnover as well.

Units sold were 360,000. Average inventory in units is (90,000 +70,000)/2 = 80,000.

So units turnover is 360,000 /80,000 = 4.5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that calculation. 360,000 divided by 80,000 is indeed 4.5, not 4.0 or something else.

So putting it all together:

- Cost turnover: 300,000 /75,000 = 4.0.

- Selling price turnover: 380,000 /100,000 =3.8.

- Units turnover: 360,000 /80,000 =4.5.

Looking back at the options, option J says:

StockturnRate (at Cost) =4.0, (at selling price)=3.8, (units)=4.5. Which matches exactly.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To determine the stock turnover rates at cost, selling price, and in units, the following calculations were performed:

1. **Stock Turnover Rate at Cost**:  
   - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = $300,000.  
   - Average inventory at cost = ($60,000 + $90,000) / 2 = $75,000.  
   - Stock Turnover Rate at Cost = COGS / Average inventory at cost = $300,000 / $75,000 = **4.0**.

2. **Stock Turnover Rate at Selling Price**:  
   - Net Sales = $380,000.  
   - Average inventory at selling price = ($80,000 + $120,000) / 2 = $100,000.  
   - Stock Turnover Rate at Selling Price = Net Sales / Average inventory at selling price = $380,000 / $100,000 = **3.8**.

3. **Stock Turnover Rate in Units**:  
   - Units sold = 360,000.  
   - Average inventory in units = (90,000 + 70,000) / 2 = 80,000.  
   - Stock Turnover Rate in Units = Units sold / Average inventory in units = 360,000 / 80,000 = **4.5**.

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:  
**Stock Turnover Rate (at Cost) = 4.0, Stock Turnover Rate (at Selling Price) = 3.8, Stock Turnover Rate (in Units) = 4.5**, which corresponds to **Option J**.
