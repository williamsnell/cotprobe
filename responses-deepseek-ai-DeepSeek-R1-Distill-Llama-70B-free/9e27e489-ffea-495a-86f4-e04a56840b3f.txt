Okay, so I have this problem here about the rotation of the plane of polarization caused by a maltose solution and then annulled by a quartz plate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a 10 cm length of a 20% maltose solution causes some rotation, and a quartz plate cut with its faces perpendicular to the optic axis exactly annuls this rotation. I need to find the thickness of the quartz plate.

Wait, I remember that when a quartz plate is used like this, it's acting as a compensator. So the idea is that the maltose solution causes a certain rotation, and the quartz plate cancels it out by rotating in the opposite direction. So the total rotation is zero.

First, I think I should calculate the specific rotation of the maltose solution. Oh wait, the specific rotation [δ] is given as 144 degrees. Wait, specific rotation is defined as the rotation produced by a 1 dm (10 cm) column with a concentration of 1 gram per cm³. Oh right, because in the problem, the solution is 20% and the length is 10 cm, which is the same as the specific rotation's standard length. So maybe that makes things easier.

So the formula for optical rotation is: rotation (θ) = [δ] * c * l, where c is concentration in grams per cm³, and l is length in dm (10 cm is 1 dm). Wait, I think the formula is θ = [δ] × c × l, but since l is already in dm, which is 10 cm, then in this case, the 10 cm length is 1 dm. So for this problem, θ = [δ] × c × 1 dm. Because l is 1 dm.

But wait, the concentration here is 20%, which is 20 grams per 100 grams solution. But I need it in grams per cm³. Oh wait, because for specific rotation, it's grams per cm³, right? So 20% solution would be 20 g per 100 ml, which is 0.2 g/cm³. Because 100 ml is 100 cm³, so 20 g / 100 cm³ = 0.2 g/cm³.

So putting it all together, the rotation θ caused by the maltose solution is θ = 144 degrees * 0.2 g/cm³ * 1 dm. Wait, but wait a second, because the units have to make sense. Oh wait, specific rotation [δ] is in degrees per (dm·g/cm³), I think. So when you multiply by c (g/cm³) and l (dm), the units become degrees.

So θ = 144 * 0.2 * 1 = 28.8 degrees. So the solution causes a rotation of 28.8 degrees.

Now, the quartz plate is used to exactly annul this rotation. So the quartz must cause a rotation of -28.8 degrees.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the quartz plate's rotation works. Quartz is a uniaxial crystal and can be either left-handed or right-handed, but the direction of rotation depends on the cut. Oh, but in this problem, the plate is cut with faces perpendicular to the optic axis. So that's a quartz plate in a specific orientation. I think when the light is propagating perpendicular to the optic axis, the plate acts as a quarter-wave plate, but wait, no, that's when it's cut along the optic axis. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the rotation caused by a quartz plate is due to its optical activity. The plate's thickness and its specific rotation determine the rotation angle. So the formula would be similar: θ = [δ] * t, where t is the thickness, but wait, what are the units here?

Wait, for quartz, the specific rotation is given in degrees per mm of thickness. Or maybe per centimeter? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the specific rotation for quartz is a known value. Let me think. I remember that the specific rotation for quartz is about 21.7 degrees per mm, but wait, I'm not certain. Wait, actually, I think the specific rotation for quartz is given as 21.7° per mm. Or maybe it's 21.7 degrees per cm, but that would be a bigger number. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, when I think about it, the specific rotation for quartz is given as 21.7° per millimetre of thickness. So for every millimetre of thickness, the rotation is 21.7 degrees. So if the plate is, say, 1 mm thick, it causes a rotation of 21.7 degrees.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about this. Alternatively, I might have to look up the specific rotation of quartz, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed with what I remember.

Wait, another approach: the specific rotation of α-quartz is about 21.7° per mm. So if the quartz plate has a thickness d (in mm), then the rotation it causes is θ = 21.7° * d.

Wait, but wait, the direction matters. The problem states that the quartz exactly annuls the rotation caused by the maltose. So the maltose causes a rotation of +28.8 degrees, and the quartz must cause a rotation of -28.8 degrees. But the sign depends on the direction of the optic axis. Wait, but perhaps the problem just wants the magnitude, so I can take the absolute value.

So the equation becomes: 21.7 * d = 28.8. Solving for d gives d = 28.8 / 21.7 ≈ 1.326 mm.

Wait, but let me double-check the specifics. Oh right, the specific rotation for quartz is positive for right-handed quartz. So if the plate is cut in a certain way, it would cause a certain rotation direction. But the problem doesn't specify the handedness, so maybe it's just the magnitude we're considering.

Wait, the problem states that the plate exactly annuls the rotation, so the rotation caused by the plate must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the rotation from the plate is -28.8 degrees, and the maltose is +28.8 degrees.

But when I think about the specific rotation of the quartz, I might have to get the exact value correctly. Let me think again. Oh, I recall that the specific rotation of quartz is 21.7 degrees per mm. So each mm of thickness gives 21.7 degrees of rotation.

So using that, the calculation would be d = 28.8 / 21.7 ≈ 1.326 mm.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.326 mm. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the specific rotation value correct? Because sometimes the value is given as 21.7° per cm, which would change the calculation. Let me think. If it's 21.7 degrees per cm, then each mm would be 2.17 degrees. Wait, no, 1 cm is 10 mm, so 21.7 per cm would be 2.17 per mm. But I'm more confident that for quartz, the specific rotation is about 21.7 degrees per mm, so each mm contributes 21.7 degrees.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 1 mm of quartz would cause a very large rotation. Wait, perhaps it's 21.7 degrees per cm? Let me recalculate.

If the specific rotation is 21.7 degrees per cm, then per mm it's 21.7 / 10 = 2.17 degrees per mm.

So then, for a rotation of 28.8 degrees, the thickness would be 28.8 / 2.17 ≈ 13.26 mm, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the specific rotation value. Alternatively, maybe I should look for the value in the problem itself, but the problem doesn't provide it. So I have to rely on my memory.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the specific rotation is given as 20 degrees per mm for quartz. But I'm not certain. If I use 20 degrees/mm, then 28.8 / 20 = 1.44 mm, which would be option H (1.4 mm), but that's not exactly matching.

Wait, but I thought it was 21.7 degrees/mm. Let me try that again: 28.8 / 21.7 ≈ 1.326 mm, which matches option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the specific rotation of quartz with that of another substance. But I'm pretty sure that the specific rotation for quartz is approximately 21.7 degrees per mm. So I think the calculation is correct, leading to option E: 1.326 mm.

So the thickness of the quartz plate should be approximately 1.326 mm.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the thickness of a quartz plate that exactly annuls the rotation of the plane of polarization caused by a 10 cm length of a 20% maltose solution. The specific rotation of maltose, \([\delta] = 144^\circ\), and the specific rotation of quartz (assumed to be \(21.7^\circ/\text{mm}\)) are used in the calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the rotation caused by the maltose solution
The formula for optical rotation is:

\[
\theta = [\delta] \cdot c \cdot l
\]

Where:
- \([\delta] = 144^\circ\) (specific rotation of maltose),
- \(c = 0.2 \, \text{g/cm}^3\) (20% solution converted to grams per cubic centimeter),
- \(l = 1 \, \text{dm} = 10 \, \text{cm}\) (length of the solution).

Substituting the values:

\[
\theta = 144^\circ \cdot 0.2 \cdot 1 = 28.8^\circ
\]

Thus, the maltose solution causes a rotation of \(28.8^\circ\).

### Step 2: Calculate the thickness of the quartz plate
The quartz plate must annul this rotation, meaning it must produce an equal and opposite rotation of \(-28.8^\circ\). The rotation caused by the quartz plate is given by:

\[
\theta = [\delta]_{\text{quartz}} \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \([\delta]_{\text{quartz}} = 21.7^\circ/\text{mm}\) (specific rotation of quartz),
- \(t\) is the thickness of the quartz plate in millimeters.

Rearranging for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{\theta}{[\delta]_{\text{quartz}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{28.8^\circ}{21.7^\circ/\text{mm}} \approx 1.326 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result with the options
The calculated thickness of the quartz plate is approximately \(1.326 \, \text{mm}\), which corresponds to **option E**.
