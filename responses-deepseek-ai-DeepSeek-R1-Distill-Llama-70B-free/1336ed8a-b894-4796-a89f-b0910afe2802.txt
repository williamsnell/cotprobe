The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Formation of a solution can often be visualized as a three-step process. Step 1. Solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute. Step 2. Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent. Step 3. Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces. Which of the following statements about the energy involved in the above is correct?

Options:

A: Step 1 is endothermic, steps 2 and 3 are exothermic.
B: All three steps are endothermic.
C: Steps 1 and 3 are exothermic, and step 2 is endothermic.
D: All three steps are exothermic.
E: Steps 1 and 3 are endothermic, and step 2 is exothermic.
F: Step 1 is exothermic, steps 2 and 3 are endothermic.
G: Step 3 is exothermic, steps 1 and 2 are neither exothermic nor endothermic.
H: Step 1 and 2 are exothermic, step 3 is neither exothermic nor endothermic.
I: Steps 1 and 2 are exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic.
J: Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.

Okay, so I have this question about the formation of a solution and the energy changes involved in each step. Hmm, I remember that when a solution forms, it's usually considered in three steps. Let me think about each step and whether they're exothermic or endothermic.

Step 1 is where the solvent molecules are separated to make space for the solute. Oh right, breaking the solvent-solvent interactions. So that requires energy because you have to overcome the attraction between the solvent molecules. If energy is absorbed, that makes it endothermic. So step 1 is endothermic.

Step 2 is separating the solute molecules. Like breaking the solute-solute interactions. Again, you have to put energy in to break those bonds or intermolecular forces. So this should also be endothermic.

Then step 3 is when the separated solute and solvent come together. Here, new interactions form between solute and solvent molecules. When these new bonds form, energy is released into the surroundings, making this step exothermic.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I remember that the overall process can be exothermic or endothermic depending on the solution. But looking at each individual step:

- Step 1: Endothermic (breaking solvent)
- Step 2: Endothermic (breaking solute)
- Step 3: Exothermic (solute-solvent interactions forming)

So putting that together, steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.

Now looking at the options. Let me see:

Option J says steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic. Yeah, that matches what I was thinking.

Wait, any other possibilities? Let me go through the options again.

Option A: Step1 endo, steps2 and3 exo. No, because step2 is breaking solute, which is endo.

Option B: All endo. No, step3 is exo.

Option C: Steps 1 and3 exo, step2 endo. No, step1 is endo.

Option D: All exo. No.

Option E: Steps1 and3 endo, step2 exo. No, because step2 is endo.

Option F: Step1 exo, others endo. No, step1 is endo.

Option G: Step3 exo, others neither. No, steps 1 and 2 are definitely endo.

Option H: Steps1 and2 exo, step3 neither. No, steps1 and 2 are endo.

Option I: Steps1 and2 exo, step3 endo. No.

So the correct answer should be option J.

The formation of a solution involves three steps, each with distinct energy changes:

1. **Step 1**: Separating solvent molecules to create space for the solute requires overcoming solvent-solvent interactions, which absorbs energy. This makes Step 1 **endothermic**.
2. **Step 2**: Separating solute molecules involves breaking solute-solute interactions, which also requires energy input. Thus, Step 2 is **endothermic**.
3. **Step 3**: Bringing the separated solute and solvent together allows new solute-solvent interactions to form, releasing energy. This makes Step 3 **exothermic**.

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is **J**, as it accurately describes Steps 1 and 2 as endothermic and Step 3 as exothermic.

Answer: J
