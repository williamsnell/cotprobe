Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. The question is asking which ratio can form a proportion with 6 over 9. The options are from A to G, and I need to pick the right one. Let me think this through.

First, I remember that a proportion means that two ratios are equal. So, if I have 6/9, I need another ratio that's equivalent to that. To check if two ratios are equivalent, I can simplify them and see if they reduce to the same fraction.

So, let's start by simplifying 6/9. Both 6 and 9 are divisible by 3. So 6 divided by 3 is 2, and 9 divided by 3 is 3. That makes 6/9 simplify to 2/3. So, the ratio we're looking for must simplify to 2/3 as well.

Now, I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: 18/24. Let's simplify that. Both 18 and 24 are divisible by 6. 18 ÷6 is 3, 24 ÷6 is 4. So that's 3/4. Hmm, 3/4 isn't 2/3, so A is not the right answer.

Option B: 8/12. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 4. 8 ÷4=2, 12 ÷4=3. So 8/12 simplifies to 2/3. Oh, that's the same as 6/9. So B is a possible correct answer. But wait, I should check the other options just to be sure.

Option C: 3/5. That's already in its simplest form. 3/5 is 0.6, while 2/3 is about 0.666... So they're not equal. So C is out.

Option D: 24/27. Let's see. Both can be divided by 3. 24 ÷3=8, 27 ÷3=9. So 24/27 is 8/9. That's not 2/3, so D isn't the one.

Option E: 15/20. Simplifying by dividing both by 5. 15 ÷5=3, 20 ÷5=4. So 3/4. Again, same as option A, which isn't 2/3. So E is out.

Option F: 9/6. Let's simplify. Both are divisible by 3. 9 ÷3=3, 6 ÷3=2. So 9/6 simplifies to 3/2. Which is 1.5, while 2/3 is about 0.666. So F is not it.

Option G: 2/6. Simplifying, divide by 2. 2 ÷2=1, 6 ÷2=3. So 2/6 is 1/3. That's not equal to 2/3. So G isn't correct.

Wait, so the only option that simplifies to 2/3 is option B: 8/12. So that would form a proportion with 6/9 because they're both equivalent to 2/3.

I think that's it. So the answer should be B.

To determine which ratio can form a proportion with \( \frac{6}{9} \), we first simplify \( \frac{6}{9} \). Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3, we get:

\[
\frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Next, we compare each option to see if it simplifies to \( \frac{2}{3} \):

- **Option A: \( \frac{18}{24} \)**  
  Simplifying by dividing both by 6:  
  \( \frac{18 \div 6}{24 \div 6} = \frac{3}{4} \)  
  Not equal to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

- **Option B: \( \frac{8}{12} \)**  
  Simplifying by dividing both by 4:  
  \( \frac{8 \div 4}{12 \div 4} = \frac{2}{3} \)  
  Equal to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

- **Option C: \( \frac{3}{5} \)**  
  Already in simplest form.  
  Not equal to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

- **Option D: \( \frac{24}{27} \)**  
  Simplifying by dividing both by 3:  
  \( \frac{24 \div 3}{27 \div 3} = \frac{8}{9} \)  
  Not equal to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

- **Option E: \( \frac{15}{20} \)**  
  Simplifying by dividing both by 5:  
  \( \frac{15 \div 5}{20 \div 5} = \frac{3}{4} \)  
  Not equal to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

- **Option F: \( \frac{9}{6} \)**  
  Simplifying by dividing both by 3:  
  \( \frac{9 \div 3}{6 \div 3} = \frac{3}{2} \)  
  Not equal to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

- **Option G: \( \frac{2}{6} \)**  
  Simplifying by dividing both by 2:  
  \( \frac{2 \div 2}{6 \div 2} = \frac{1}{3} \)  
  Not equal to \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The only option that simplifies to \( \frac{2}{3} \) is **Option B: \( \frac{8}{12} \)**. Therefore, it forms a proportion with \( \frac{6}{9} \).
