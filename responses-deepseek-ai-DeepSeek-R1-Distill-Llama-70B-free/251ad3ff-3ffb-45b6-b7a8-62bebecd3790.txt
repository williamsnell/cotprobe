Okay, so I have this Python expression to solve: 4 + 3 % 2. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that in Python, the modulo operator % has higher precedence than addition. So I should calculate the modulo part first before adding. Let me confirm that. Oh right, the order of operations, right? So multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction, and modulo is like multiplication level.

So looking at 3 % 2. What's that equal to? Well, 3 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 1. Because 2 times 1 is 2, and 3 minus 2 is 1. So 3 mod 2 is 1.

Now the expression becomes 4 + 1, which is 5. So the value should be 5.

Looking at the options, option J is 5. So the answer must be J.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. If I had done 4 + (3 % 2), which I did, that's correct. If it were (4 +3) % 2, that would be 7 %2 which is 1. But that's not the case here. So yes, it's definitely 5.

The expression `4 + 3 % 2` is evaluated by first calculating the modulo operation due to operator precedence. 

1. Compute `3 % 2`, which equals 1.
2. Add 4 to the result: `4 + 1 = 5`.

The correct answer is J: 5.
