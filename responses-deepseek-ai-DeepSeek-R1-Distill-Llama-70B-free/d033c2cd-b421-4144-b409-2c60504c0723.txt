Okay, so I have this problem here about the boiling point of water under a different pressure. Hmm, I remember that boiling point changes with pressure. Like, when you go up in the mountains, water boils at a lower temperature because the atmospheric pressure is lower. So the question is, what's the boiling point when the pressure is 0.750 atm instead of the standard 1 atm.

Wait, the problem mentions ΔH' of water as 40,600 J/mole at 100°C. Oh right, that's the enthalpy of vaporization, right? I remember that ΔHvap is the heat required to vaporize a liquid at its boiling point. So at standard pressure (1 atm), water boils at 100°C, and ΔHvap is 40,600 J/mol. 

But now the pressure is lower, 0.750 atm. So the boiling point should be lower than 100°C. Because lower pressure makes it easier for the liquid to turn into gas, so it happens at a lower temp. So the options are A:75, B:85, D:92. C is 100, which is standard, so it's not that.

I think I need to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation here. The equation relates the change in pressure and temperature to the boiling point. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2), where P is pressure, T is temperature, R is the gas constant, and ΔH is the enthalpy of vaporization.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the variables right. P1 is the initial pressure, T1 the initial boiling point, P2 the new pressure, and T2 the new boiling point. So here, P1 is 1 atm, T1 is 100°C which is 373 K. P2 is 0.750 atm. We need to find T2.

So plugging into the equation: ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

I think R is 8.314 J/mol·K. Oh wait, but wait, ΔH is given as 40,600 J/mol. So positive because it's the heat required for vaporization.

Wait, but wait again. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is often written as ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1). Or was that the other way around? I might have to get the signs right. Because when pressure decreases, the boiling point decreases, so T2 should be lower than T1.

Let me write the equation properly. The correct form is ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔH/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1). Alternatively, some sources write it as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Because if P decreases, P2 < P1, so ln(P2/P1) is negative. And since T2 is lower than T1, 1/T1 - 1/T2 will be negative. So (ΔH/R)(negative) would give a negative on the right, matching the left side. So the equation I should use is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, let me double-check. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually expressed as:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, no, wait. Another version I remember is:

dP/dT = (ΔHvap)/(TΔV)

But that's the differential form. The integrated form, assuming that ΔHvap doesn't change much with temperature (which is probably acceptable here), is ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1). Which can be rewritten as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2).

So that's the equation I'll use.

So plugging in the numbers:

P1 = 1 atm, T1 = 373 K (100°C)
P2 = 0.750 atm
ΔHvap = 40,600 J/mol (which is 40600 J/mol)
R = 8.314 J/mol·K

So compute ln(0.750 / 1) = (40600 / 8.314) * (1/373 - 1/T2)

Compute ln(0.75) first. Ln(0.75) is about -0.28768.

On the right side: 40600 / 8.314 is approximately 40600 / 8 is about 5075, but more accurately, 8.314*4875 = approx 40597, so 40600/8.314 ≈4875. So approximately 4875.

Then, (1/373 - 1/T2) = (T2 - 373) / (373 T2)

So putting it all together:

-0.28768 ≈4875 * ( (T2 - 373) / (373 T2) )

Wait, let me write that more clearly. The right-hand side is 4875 * [ (1/373) - (1/T2) ].

So let's compute 1/373 ≈0.002681. So:

Right side: 4875 * (0.002681 - 1/T2)

Left side: -0.28768 = 4875 * (0.002681 - 1/T2 )

Let me compute 4875 * 0.002681 first.

0.002681 *4875: 4875 * 0.002 is 9.75, 4875 *0.000681 is approx 4875*0.0006=2.925, 4875*0.000081= approx 0.395. So total ≈9.75 +2.925 +0.395≈13.07.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach: 4875 * 0.002681 = ?

Well, 0.002681 *4875 = 4875 * 2.681e-3.

4875 * 2e-3 is 9.75, 4875 *0.681e-3 = 4875 *0.000681.

Compute 4000 *0.000681= 2.724, 800*0.000681=0.545, 75 *0.000681≈0.051. So total 2.724 +0.545=3.269 plus 0.051 is 3.32. So 9.75 +3.32=13.07. So about 13.07.

So right side is 13.07 - (4875 / T2 )

The equation is -0.28768 = 13.07 - (4875 / T2 )

Wait, wait, let me re-express the equation.

Wait, the right-hand side is 4875*(0.002681 - (1/T2)).

So: 4875*(0.002681) = 4875 * 0.002681 = 13.07 as before.

So equation is:

-0.28768 = 13.07 - (4875 / T2)

Wait, that can't be right because 13.07 is a positive number. So 13.07 - (something) equals a negative number (-0.28768). So 13.07 - X = -0.28768 → X = 13.07 +0.28768=13.35768.

So, X is (4875 / T2 ) =13.35768 → T2=4875 /13.35768 ≈?

Compute 4875 /13.35768.

Let me compute 13.35768 * 365 = ?

Wait, 13 * 365 = 4745, 0.35768*365 ≈130. So total ≈4745 +130=4875. So 13.35768 *365 ≈4875.

So T2 is approximately 365 K.

Convert Kelvin to Celsius: 365 K - 273.15 = 91.85°C, which is approximately 92°C.

Looking at the options, D is 92°C. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made an error in the steps.

So let's go through again.

ln(0.75) = approximately -0.2877.

ΔHvap =40600 J/mol.

R=8.314.

So, (ΔHvap/R) =40600/8.314≈4880.2.

Wait, more accurately: 8.314 * 4880 = let's see, 8*4880=39,040; 0.314*4880≈1,532. So total ≈40472, which is close to 40600. So approximately 4880.

So (ΔH/R)= ~4880.

Equation: ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 -1/T2 )

So:

-0.2877 =4880*( (1/373) - (1/T2) )

Compute (1/373) ≈0.002681.

So:

-0.2877 =4880*(0.002681 - (1/T2) )

Compute 4880 *0.002681 = let's calculate.

4880 * 0.002 = 9.76.

4880 *0.000681 = ?

Calculate 4880 * 0.0006 =2.928.

4880 *0.000081= approx 0.395.

So 2.928 +0.395=3.323.

So total for 0.002681 is 9.76+3.323=13.083.

So:

-0.2877 =13.083 - (4880 / T2 )

Rearranged:

(4880 / T2 ) =13.083 +0.2877 =13.3707.

So T2 =4880 /13.3707 ≈?

Compute 13.3707 * 365 = let's see:

13 *365 =4745.

0.3707 *365= approx 135.3.

So total 4745 +135.3=4880.3.

So T2= 365 K, which is 92°C. So yes, D is correct.

I think I did that right.

To determine the boiling point of water at a pressure of 0.750 atm, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Given:
- \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm}, \, T_1 = 373 \, \text{K} \, (100^\circ \text{C}) \)
- \( P_2 = 0.750 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 40,600 \, \text{J/mol} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)

### Step 1: Calculate \(\ln(P_2 / P_1)\)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{0.750}{1}\right) = \ln(0.750) \approx -0.2877
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\Delta H_{\text{vap}} / R\)
\[
\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} = \frac{40,600}{8.314} \approx 4,880
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into the equation
\[
-0.2877 = 4,880 \left(\frac{1}{373} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Step 4: Simplify
First, calculate \( \frac{1}{373} \):
\[
\frac{1}{373} \approx 0.002681
\]

Substitute this into the equation:
\[
-0.2877 = 4,880 \left(0.002681 - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Expand the right-hand side:
\[
-0.2877 = 4,880 \cdot 0.002681 - \frac{4,880}{T_2}
\]

Calculate \( 4,880 \cdot 0.002681 \):
\[
4,880 \cdot 0.002681 \approx 13.07
\]

So:
\[
-0.2877 = 13.07 - \frac{4,880}{T_2}
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( \frac{4,880}{T_2} \):
\[
\frac{4,880}{T_2} = 13.07 + 0.2877 = 13.3577
\]

Solve for \( T_2 \):
\[
T_2 = \frac{4,880}{13.3577} \approx 365 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 5: Convert \( T_2 \) to Celsius
\[
T_2 = 365 \, \text{K} - 273.15 = 91.85^\circ \text{C} \approx 92^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Final Answer:
The boiling point of water at 0.750 atm is approximately **92°C**.

**Correct Option: D**
