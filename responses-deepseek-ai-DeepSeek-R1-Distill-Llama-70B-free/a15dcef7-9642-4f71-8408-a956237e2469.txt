Okay, so I've got this transformer question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question says that the total copper loss from a short-circuit test at 20°C is 630 watts. Then, the copper loss computed from the true ohmic resistance at the same temperature is 504 watts. They're asking for the load loss at a working temperature of 75°C. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in transformers, the copper loss (also called I²R loss) depends on the current flowing through the windings. Oh right, when you do a short-circuit test, you're measuring the losses when the secondary is shorted, which gives you the copper losses in the windings because the current is higher than no-load conditions.

Wait, but wait. The total copper loss measured in the short-circuit test is 630 W at 20°C. But the computed loss from ohmic resistance is 504 W. Ohmic resistance is just the DC resistance, right? So the copper loss calculated using that would be I²R, but maybe that's at some specific current.

I think I remember that the copper loss can have other components besides just the ohmic resistance. Like, there's also eddy current losses, which are proportional to the square of the current. So the total copper loss under short circuit would be the sum of I²R and the eddy current loss.

So in the short-circuit test, the measured copper loss (630 W) equals I²R (504 W) plus the eddy current loss. So the eddy loss should be 630 - 504 = 126 W. That makes sense.

Now, the question is about the load loss at 75°C. Load loss typically includes both the copper loss (I²R) and the stray losses (like eddy currents). So we need to calculate the total load loss at the higher temperature.

But wait, the temperature affects the resistance. Ohmic resistance increases with temperature. So when the transformer operates at 75°C, the resistance will be higher than at 20°C.

I think the formula to adjust resistance with temperature is R2 = R1 * (T2 / T1), but wait, no, that's for conductance maybe. Or is it R2 = R1 * (1 + α*(T2 - T1)), where α is the temperature coefficient. But since we're dealing with copper, which has a positive temperature coefficient, the resistance increases as temperature increases.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I recall that the resistance changes with temperature according to R2 = R1 * ( (T2 + 234.5) / (T1 + 234.5) ) for copper. Because the reference temperature for copper is around 234.5 K, I think.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the resistance at different temperatures is R2 = R1 * [ (T2 + T_ref) / (T1 + T_ref) ], where T_ref is the reference temperature where the resistivity is known. For copper, the reference is 20°C (which is 293.15 K) and the resistivity at that point is known. So the formula would adjust R based on temperature.

So, T1 is 20°C, which is 293.15 K. T2 is 75°C, which is 348.15 K.

So the ratio is (348.15 + 234.5) / (293.15 + 234.5) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, the formula is R2 = R1 * [ (T2 + T0) / (T1 + T0) ), where T0 is 234.5 K. So let's compute that.

Wait, 20°C is 293.15 K, so R1 is at 293 K. R2 will be at 348.15 K (75°C).

So the ratio is (348.15 + 234.5) / (293.15 + 234.5) = (582.65) / (527.65) ≈ 1.104.

So the resistance at 75°C is R1 * 1.104.

But wait, the initial resistance R is given at 20°C. Because the copper loss computed from true ohmic resistance at 20°C is 504 W. Let me see, that's the I²R loss. So if the current is I, then I²R = 504 W.

But in the short-circuit test, the copper loss is higher than that because it includes eddy losses. So the 630 W is the sum of I²R (504 W) and the eddy loss (126 W), so 504 + 126 = 630.

So, now, when the temperature increases to 75°C, the resistance R increases. So the I²R loss would increase by the same factor as the resistance. But what about the eddy loss? I think eddy loss is proportional to I² as well, but wait, no. Wait, eddy current loss is proportional to the square of the current and is affected by the resistivity of the material. But resistivity decreases as temperature increases (for copper, since resistivity increases with temperature, as resistivity is inversely related to conductivity). Wait no, for copper, resistivity increases with temperature, so eddy losses would increase because the material's resistivity is higher, making the eddy currents' losses higher. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, eddy current loss is given by P = (k * I² * f²) / ρ, where ρ is the resistivity. So as resistivity increases, the loss decreases. Wait, no, because eddy loss is proportional to the conductivity (σ) which is 1/ρ. So if ρ increases, σ decreases, so eddy loss decreases. Wait, that can't be right because higher temperature increases ρ, so eddy loss would decrease? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, eddy loss is proportional to I² and to the square of the frequency, but it's inversely proportional to the resistivity. So if the resistivity increases (because temperature increases), the eddy loss would decrease. Hmm, that's an important point.

Wait, but in this problem, are they considering the eddy loss to change with temperature? Or are they assuming that the eddy loss remains the same in terms of its proportionality to I²?

No, I think in this problem, the copper loss (I²R) depends on temperature, but the stray loss (eddy) is assumed to remain the same as a fraction of the load, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the short-circuit test, the eddy loss is measured as a fixed value, and when the temperature changes, the I²R part changes but the eddy loss stays the same. Or maybe the eddy loss is proportional to I², so if the current is the same, eddy loss would be same, but if the current changes, it would change.

Wait, no, in this case, the load loss is at a different temperature, but the question is about the load loss at that temperature. So I think the load loss is the same as the copper loss (I²R) plus the stray losses. But the copper loss will change with temperature, while the stray losses (eddy) depend on the current and material properties.

Wait, but in this problem, when the temperature increases, the resistance increases, so I²R increases, and the eddy loss would depend on the resistivity. Since resistivity increases with temperature, eddy loss would decrease. But wait, in the short-circuit test, we have a certain current I, so the eddy loss is 126 W. But at a different temperature, the same current would cause a different eddy loss.

But wait, perhaps in this problem, the stray loss is considered to remain constant if the current is the same. Because if you're operating at the same current, then the stray loss component (like eddy) would scale based on the resistivity. So when temperature increases, the resistivity of copper increases, so the eddy loss would decrease.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it step by step.

First, at 20°C, we have:

Copper loss (I²R) = 504 W.

Stray loss (eddy) = 630 - 504 = 126 W.

So total load loss at 20°C under short-circuit is 630 W, which is sum of I²R and stray.

Now, when the temperature increases to 75°C, the resistance R increases. So the I²R part would increase.

The resistance at 75°C, R_new = R_old * ( (75 + 234.5) / (20 + 234.5) )

Wait, let me compute that. 75°C is 75 + 273.15 = 348.15 K? Or is it 75 + 234.5? Wait, maybe I'm mixing the formulas. I think the correct formula is R2 = R1 * (T2 + T_ref) / (T1 + T_ref), where T_ref is the reference temperature for the material.

For copper, the reference temperature is usually 20°C (293.15 K) where the resistivity is known. So the formula for resistance at temperature T (in °C) is:

R = R_ref * [ (T + 234.5) / (20 + 234.5) ) ]

Wait, I'm a bit shaky on this. Let's think differently. The temperature coefficient of resistance for copper is about 0.00426 per °C. So the resistance increases by 0.426% per degree Celsius rise.

Wait, maybe using the formula R = R0 * (1 + α*(T - T0)), where α is the temperature coefficient, T is the new temperature, and T0 is the reference temperature.

So R0 is the resistance at T0 = 20°C. The temperature coefficient for copper is approximately 0.00426 per °C.

So the increase from 20°C to 75°C is 55°C.

So R_new = R0 * (1 + α*(T - T0)) = R0 * (1 + 0.00426 * 55)

Calculating that: 0.00426 * 55 = 0.2343. So 1 + 0.2343 = 1.2343.

So R_new = R0 * 1.2343.

So the resistance increases by about 23.43%.

Therefore, the I²R loss at 75°C would be I² * R_new = I²R0 * 1.2343 = 504 W * 1.2343 ≈ 504 * 1.2343.

Let me calculate that: 504 * 1.2 is 604.8, 504 * 0.0343 is about 504 * 0.03 = 15.12, so total is around 619.92 W. So approximately 620 W.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately. 504 * 1.2343:

1.2343 = 1 + 0.2 + 0.03 + 0.0043.

So 504 * 1 = 504.

504 * 0.2 = 100.8.

504 * 0.03 = 15.12.

504 * 0.0043 ≈ 504 * 0.004 = 2.016, and 504 * 0.0003 = 0.1512, so total ≈ 2.1672.

Adding them all: 504 + 100.8 = 604.8, +15.12 = 619.92, +2.1672 ≈ 622.0872 W.

So approximately 622 W for the I²R part at 75°C.

Now, what about the stray loss (eddy loss)? At 20°C, it's 126 W. But at 75°C, the resistivity of copper increases, which would affect the eddy loss. Eddy loss is proportional to (I² * f²) / ρ. So if ρ increases, eddy loss decreases.

But calculating that would require knowing the resistivity at both temperatures, which complicates things. Alternatively, in some simplifications, the stray loss is considered to remain proportional to the load squared, but adjusted for temperature.

Wait, but I don't have the necessary data to calculate the exact change in resistivity. So perhaps in this problem, the stray loss is considered to remain the same as a fraction of the copper loss, or perhaps it's assumed that only the I²R part changes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem treats the stray loss as a fixed value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The short-circuit test gives us the total copper loss, which includes both the I²R and the stray loss. So at 20°C, it's 630 W.

At 75°C, the I²R part increases to 622 W, as calculated. But what about the stray loss?

The stray loss (eddy) at 20°C is 126 W. At 75°C, does it change?

Hmm, the formula for stray loss (eddy) is P = (k I² f²)/ρ, where ρ is the resistivity. So as temperature increases, ρ increases, so P decreases.

But we don't have the exact value of ρ at different temperatures, so perhaps the problem assumes that the stray loss remains the same as when measured in the short-circuit test. But that doesn't make sense because the current would be the same, but the resistivity has changed.

Wait, no, in the short-circuit test, the current is the same when measuring the losses, so perhaps the stray loss would change.

Alternatively, perhaps the load loss at 75°C is calculated using the same ratio as before, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to find the load loss at 75°C as the sum of the increased I²R and the same stray loss. But that might not be correct because the stray loss would change.

Alternatively, perhaps the load loss at 75°C is only the I²R loss, but that's not right because load loss includes both copper and stray losses.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the load loss at 75°C as the I²R at that temperature plus the stray loss at that temperature. But without knowing how the stray loss changes, we can't compute it accurately.

Wait, but maybe the problem simplifies it by assuming that the ratio between the I²R and the stray loss remains the same. Or perhaps the stray loss is considered to be proportional to the I²R loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the load loss at 75°C is simply the I²R at that temperature, but that would ignore the stray loss.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the load loss being proportional to the square of the current times the resistance. But when temperature changes, the resistance changes, so the load loss would change.

Wait, but the question gives us the copper loss at 20°C from the short-circuit test as 630 W, which includes both I²R and stray loss. The computed copper loss from ohmic resistance (I²R) is 504 W. So the 630 includes both I²R and eddy, which is 504 + 126.

Now, when temperature increases, the I²R increases by the factor we calculated (about 1.2343 times), so 504 * 1.2343 ≈ 622 W.

But what about the eddy loss? At 20°C, it's 126 W. At 75°C, since resistivity increases, eddy loss would decrease.

The resistivity of copper at 20°C is ρ1, and at 75°C, it's ρ2. The ratio ρ2/ρ1 is the same as the ratio of resistances R2/R1, which is 1.2343.

So eddy loss is proportional to 1/ρ. So the new eddy loss, P2 = P1 * (ρ1 / ρ2) = 126 W * (1 / 1.2343) ≈ 126 / 1.2343 ≈ 102 W.

So the total load loss at 75°C would be 622 W (I²R) + 102 W (eddy) ≈ 724 W.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 717 W, which is near 724. But let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eddy loss calculation. Let me re-express it.

The eddy loss is inversely proportional to the resistivity. So P_stray ∝ 1/ρ.

Given that, P_stray2 = P_stray1 * (ρ1 / ρ2).

But since R ∝ ρ, and R2 = R1 * (T2 + T_ref)/(T1 + T_ref).

So ρ2 = ρ1 * (T2 + T_ref)/(T1 + T_ref).

Thus, P_stray2 = 126 W * (ρ1 / ρ2) = 126 * ( (T1 + T_ref) / (T2 + T_ref) )

Because ρ2 = ρ1 * (T2 + T_ref)/(T1 + T_ref), so ρ1/ρ2 = (T1 + T_ref)/(T2 + T_ref).

So substituting the numbers:

T1 = 20°C = 293.15 K, T2 = 75°C = 348.15 K.

T_ref for copper is 234.5 K.

So (T1 + T_ref) = 293.15 + 234.5 = 527.65 K.

(T2 + T_ref) = 348.15 + 234.5 = 582.65 K.

Thus, P_stray2 = 126 * (527.65 / 582.65).

Calculating 527.65 / 582.65 ≈ 0.9055.

So P_stray2 ≈ 126 * 0.9055 ≈ 114 W.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 102, but this calculation gives 114 W.

So the I²R part is 504 * 1.2343 ≈ 622 W.

Stray loss is 114 W.

Total load loss = 622 + 114 = 736 W.

But that's not one of the options. The closest option is G:717, but that's 736, which isn't exact. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature adjustment formula. Maybe the correct formula for resistance is R = R_ref * (1 + α*(T - T_ref)), where α is the temperature coefficient.

For copper, α is about 0.00426 per °C. So from 20°C to 75°C, that's a 55°C increase.

So R_new = R_old * (1 + 0.00426 * 55).

Calculating 0.
