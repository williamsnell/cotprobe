Okay, so I've got this problem about a bevel gear keyed to a steel shaft with a steel feather key. I need to compute the key length for two different scenarios. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on machine design, but let's try to think through this step by step.

The torque delivered by the gear is 7500 in.-lb. The shaft has a diameter of 2 inches. The key is a feather key, which I remember is a type of key that's usually a rectangular piece fitting into a keyseat on the shaft. The key is held in place by a keyseat in both the gear and the shaft.

The problem gives two parts, (a) and (b), each with different key dimensions. I need to compute the required length of the key for each. The permissible stresses are given: 16,500 psi for both compression and tension, and 8,500 psi for shear.

First, I think I should recall how torque relates to the key. Torque (T) is equal to the shear force (F) times the radius (r) of the shaft. So T = F * r. Wait, but how does this relate to the key?

Oh right, the key transmits the torque from the shaft to the gear. The key must withstand both shear and compressive stresses. The key is in compression on one side and tension on the other, but I think in this case, since it's a feather key, it's mainly subjected to shear stress. Or maybe both? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, in a feather key, the load is transmitted through the key by shear. But also, there might be compressive stress between the key and the shaft. Hmm. I think the key is designed such that the maximum stress occurs in shear, but sometimes people consider both shear and compressive strengths.

Let me get the torque equation right. Torque T = 7500 in.-lb. The shaft diameter is 2 inches, so radius r = 1 inch.

So, the shear force F can be found from F = T / r. Wait, no, wait. Shear stress is related to torque, but the formula for shear stress in a shaft is different. Oh wait, no, in this case, the key is transmitting the torque, so the force on the key is due to the torque.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the key's dimensions. The key has a thickness (t) and a width (w). For part (a), the key is t = 1/2 inch, w = 3/4 inch. For part (b), t = 3/4 inch, w = 1/2 inch.

I think the area of the key that's in shear is important. The shear stress (τ) is given by τ = Force / Area. The permissible shear stress is 8500 psi.

But how do I find the force on the key? The torque is transmitted through the key, so the force F is related to torque. Torque T is equal to F times the radius of the shaft. So F = T / r. 

Wait, T is 7500 in.-lb, r is 1 inch, so F = 7500 / 1 = 7500 lb. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think I'm mixing up things. Because the torque is applied to the shaft, which is connected to the gear via the key. So the key must transmit this torque, which creates a shearing force on the key.

Alternatively, maybe the torque creates a shear stress in the key. Let's think about the key as a rectangular bar. The torque will cause a shear stress in the key. The shear stress formula is τ = (T * r) / (J), but that's for shafts. Wait, no, that's for the shaft's own shear stress. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the key as a rectangular element. The torque is transmitted through the key, so the force exerted on the key is such that F = T / r, because torque is F*r. So F = 7500 in.-lb / 1 in = 7500 lb.

But wait, the key is a rectangular part. The shear area of the key would be its length times its width. Because shear occurs along the length of the key when it's transmitting torque. So the area in shear is A = length (L) * width (w).

So shear stress τ = Force / A. So τ = F / (L * w) *something? Wait, no. Because for shear stress in a rectangular bar transmitting torque, the formula is τ = (T * r) / (J), but J is the polar moment of inertia. Hmm, maybe that's the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the key as a beam in torsion. The maximum shear stress in a rectangular key when transmitting torque is given by τ_max = (3T)/(L * w^2). Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's τ = (4T)/(π d^3) for a circular shaft, but the key isn't circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the shear force. Since the key is L inches long, and has width w and thickness t. The area in shear would be L * t, because the shear is across the thickness. Wait, but I'm getting confused about which dimensions are which.

Wait, in a key, typically the length is along the shaft. The width is across the keyway, and the thickness is the depth. So, for a feather key, the width is the smaller dimension, and the thickness is larger. But in part (a), the key is 1/2 inch thick and 3/4 wide. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the shear area is the length of the key multiplied by its thickness. So A_shear = L * t.

So then, the shear stress τ = Force / A_shear.

But what's the force? From torque, F = T / r. Wait, but torque is T = F * r, so F = T / r. So F is 7500 lb. But that seems like a huge force.

Wait, no, perhaps the force on the key is F = T / (r), but that's the same as above. So F = 7500 / 1 = 7500 lb. Then the shear area is L * t. So τ = 7500 / (L * t) = 8500 psi.

Wait, but then L = (7500) / (τ * t). So for part (a), t is 0.5 inches, τ is 8500 psi.

So L = 7500 / (8500 * 0.5) = 7500 / 4250 ≈ 1.7647 inches, approximately 1.76 inches. So that's about 1.75 inches. Let's see the options.

Looking at the options, which one has (a) as around 1.75. Option C says (a) 1.75 in, (b) 2.25 in. But wait, I need to check part (a) and (b) for each option.

Wait, no, the calculation seems correct for part (a). But wait, I think I might have mixed up the dimensions. Because in part (a), the key's thickness is 1/2 in, width 3/4. So when I'm calculating shear area as L * t, t is 0.5, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, another approach: sometimes, in key design, you consider both shear and compressive stress. The key is in compression on one side and tension on the other. So the compressive stress (σ) is given by σ = F / (L * width). So σ should be within the permissible compressive stress of 16,500 psi.

Wait, but the force F is from torque, which is 7500 lb. So for part (a), width is 0.75 inches. So the area in compression is L * width. So σ = F / (L * w) = 7500 / (L * 0.75). This must be less than or equal to 16,500 psi.

So 7500 / (0.75 L) ≤ 16500 → 7500 / (0.75 L) = 10000 / L ≤ 16500 → L ≥ 10000 / 16500 ≈ 0.606 in. So the length from compression consideration is about 0.606 inches. But our previous calculation from shear was about 1.76 inches. So the length must satisfy both, so the larger one, 1.76 inches. So the length is determined by shear.

Wait, but the shear stress is 8500 psi, but the compressive stress is 16500 psi. So which one is the limiting factor? Because shear is more critical here, since 8500 is lower than 16500. So the length is determined by the shear condition. So in part (a), L ≈ 1.76 in. Looking at the options, option C has (a) 1.75. Close enough.

Now part (b): key thickness is 3/4 in, width is 1/2 in. So again, shear area is L * t = L * 0.75.

So using the shear condition: τ = 7500 / (L * 0.75) ≤ 8500 → L ≥ 7500 / (0.75 * 8500) → 7500 / 6375 ≈ 1.176 inches. So about 1.176 inches. But also, check the compressive condition: σ = F / (L * w) = 7500 / (L * 0.5) ≤ 16500 → 7500/(0.5 L) = 15000 / L. So 15000 / L ≤ 16500 → L ≥ 15000/16500 ≈ 0.909 in.

So the shear condition requires L ≥ 1.176 in, so that's the governing factor. So length L ≈ 1.176 inches, which is about 1.18 inches. Looking at the options, which option has (b) about 1.18 inches. Option C for part (b) is 2.25, which is way higher. Option B: (b) 1.25. That's close. Option D: (b) 1 3/4, which is 1.75. Hmm, wait, no, I'm getting 1.18, which is about 1.2 inches, so 1.25 would be option B for part (b).

Wait, but let's check the calculations again. Did I make a mistake? Let me recalculate part (b) shear condition.

F = 7500 lb.

Shear area = L * t = L * 0.75 in².

τ = 7500 / (L * 0.75) ≤ 8500 psi.

So 7500 / (0.75 L) ≤ 8500 → 7500/(0.75) = 10000 → 10000 / L ≤8500 → L ≥ 10000 /8500 ≈ 1.176 in.

So L must be at least approximately 1.176 inches. So looking at the options, which have (b) as 1.25, 1.75, etc. Option B is (a) 2.25, (b) 1.25. Option D has (b) 1.75. Hmm, but 1.176 is approximately 1.2, so 1.25 is the next higher value.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the compressive stress as well. So for part (b), the width is 0.5 inches. So σ = F/(L * w) =7500/(L * 0.5 )= 15000 / L.

Which must be ≤ 16500 → 15000 / L ≤ 16500 → L ≥ 15000 / 16500 ≈ 0.909 in. So the shear condition requires longer key, so the key length is determined by shear.

So for part (b), the minimum key length is about 1.176 inches, which would be approximately 1.2 inches. Since the options don't have 1.2, perhaps the next is 1.25 inches. So option B's (b) is 1.25.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is (a)1.75, (b)2.25. That can't be right because part (b) requires only about 1.2 inches. So which option has (a) ~1.75 and (b) ~1.25? Let me check. Option C: (a)1.75, (b)2.25—no, part (b) is 2.25 which is higher. Option B: (a)2.25, (b)1.25. No, because part (a) is calculated as 1.75. So the correct answer should have part (a) around 1.75 and part (b) around 1.25.

Looking at the options: Option C is (a)1.75, (b)2.25. No. Option B's (a) is 2.25, which is higher than our calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: I've heard that sometimes both shear and compressive stresses are considered, and you take the maximum of the two. Alternatively, perhaps the key is designed based on the compressive stress, but that doesn't make sense because shear is lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute both the required length from shear and from compression, and take the longer one. Because both stresses must be within permissible limits.

So for part (a):

Shear: L_shear = 7500 / (8500 * t) → t is 0.5. So L_shear = 7500/(8500 * 0.5) = 7500/4250 ≈ 1.7647 in.

Compression: L_comp = 7500 / (16500 * w) → w is 0.75. So L_comp =7500/(16500 *0.75) = 7500/(12375) ≈ 0.606 in.

So the key length must be at least 1.7647 inches. So around 1.76 or 1.75 inches. So part (a) is 1.75, which matches option C's (a).

Part (b):

t = 0.75, w =0.5.

Shear: L_shear =7500/(8500 *0.75) =7500/6375 ≈1.176 in.

Compression: L_comp =7500/(16500 *0.5) =7500/8250 ≈0.909 in.

So the key length must be at least 1.176 inches, so approximately 1.18 inches. So which option has part (b) as around 1.2 inches? Looking at the options:

Option B: (a) 2.25, (b)1.25.
Option D: (a)2.0, (b)1.75.
Option H: (a)2.75, (b)1.75.

Wait, none of the options have (a)1.75 and (b)1.2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the required length based on both shear and compression, and take the maximum. So for each case, compute both and pick the longer length.

In part (a), shear requires 1.76, compression 0.606. So 1.76 is the limit.

In part (b), shear requires 1.176, compression 0.909. So the longer is 1.176, so 1.176 inches.

But the options don't have (a)1.75 and (b)1.176. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is designed to have both shear and compressive stresses, and the total area must account for both. Hmm, but that doesn't quite make sense. Or perhaps I should consider the sum of the stresses.

Wait, perhaps the key is subjected to both shear and compressive stress, and the maximum of the two should be within permissible limits. Or maybe the key must satisfy both conditions, so the required length is the maximum of the two computed lengths.

In part (a), the shear gives 1.76, compression 0.606. So 1.76 is the required length.

In part (b), shear gives 1.176, compression 0.909. So 1.176 is the required length. So which option matches these?

Looking at the options:

Option C: (a)1.75, (b)2.25 → Doesn't match (b).
Option B: (a)2.25, (b)1.25 → (a) too long, (b) matches 1.25.
Option D: (a)2.0, (b)1.75 → (a) higher than needed, (b) longer than needed.
Option E: (a)2.5, (b)2 → Both longer than needed.
Option J: (a)3, (b)2.25 → Way too long.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try another approach.

I think another formula for the key length is:

Key length L = (4 T) / (π τ w d), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I've heard that the torque transmitted by a key is T = (permissible shear stress) * (length of key) * (thickness)^2 * (some factor). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another resource I remember: For a rectangular key in shear, the shear stress is τ = (4 T) / (w t^2 L) ) * something? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the shear stress formula for a rectangular key is τ = (3 T) / (L w t^2). Hmm, maybe. Let me see.

If that's the case, then rearranging for L: L = (3 T) / (τ w t^2).

Wait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, perhaps the shear force per unit length multiplied by the length is equal to the torque.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The key is essentially a cantilever beam, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum shear stress in the key is τ = (T * r) / J, where J is the polar moment of inertia. For a rectangular key, J = (w t^3)/6. So τ = (T r) / ((w t^3)/6) ) = (6 T r) / (w t^3). So τ = (6 T r)/(w t^3).

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the key is a rectangular section
