Okay, I'm trying to solve this complex number problem. Let me read it again. So, the problem says that for the complex number z = a + bi, where a and b are positive integers, we need to find the smallest possible value of b such that z^3 + z^2 + z is a real number.

Hmm, right. So z is a complex number, and when we compute z^3 + z^2 + z, the result should be real. That means the imaginary part of the sum has to be zero.

I think the best approach is to compute z^3 + z^2 + z, separate the real and imaginary parts, and then set the imaginary part equal to zero. Then solve for a and b.

Let me start by computing each term. Let's let z = a + bi.

First, z squared: z² = (a + bi)². Expanding that, I get a² + 2abi + (bi)^2. Since i² is -1, that becomes a² - b² + 2abi. So z² = (a² - b²) + (2ab)i.

Next, z cubed: z³ = z² * z = [(a² - b²) + 2ab i] * (a + bi). Let me multiply that out.

Multiplying the real parts: (a² - b²) * a = a³ - a b².
Multiplying the outer terms: (a² - b²) * bi = (a² b - b³)i.
Multiplying the inner terms: 2ab i * a = 2a² b i.
Multiplying the last terms: 2ab i * bi = 2ab * b i² = 2a b² (-1) = -2a b².

So putting all those together:
z³ = (a³ - a b² - 2a b²) + (a² b - b³ + 2a² b)i.
Wait, let me check that. The real parts are a³ - a b² and -2a b², so combining those: a³ - 3a b². The imaginary parts: a² b - b³ + 2a² b is 3a² b - b³.

So z³ = (a³ - 3a b²) + (3a² b - b³)i.

Now, z itself is a + bi.

So, when we compute z³ + z² + z, we have:

Real parts:
z³ real: a³ - 3a b²
z² real: a² - b²
z real: a
Sum of real parts: (a³ - 3a b²) + (a² - b²) + a.

Imaginary parts:
z³ imaginary: 3a² b - b³
z² imaginary: 2ab
z imaginary: b
Sum of imaginary parts: (3a² b - b³) + 2ab + b.

So the entire expression is real when the imaginary part equals zero. So:

3a² b - b³ + 2ab + b = 0.

Let me factor this equation. Let's factor out a b:

b(3a² - b² + 2a + 1) = 0.

Since b is a positive integer, it can't be zero. So we set the other factor equal to zero:

3a² - b² + 2a + 1 = 0.

Hmm, rearranging this gives:

b² = 3a² + 2a + 1.

We need to find positive integers a and b such that b squared equals 3a squared plus 2a plus 1.

Our goal is to find the smallest possible b. So I'll try small integer values for a and see if b² becomes a perfect square.

Let me start with a=1:

b² = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 3 + 2 +1 =6. 6 isn’t a perfect square. So no.

a=2:

3*(4) + 2*(2) +1=12+4+1=17. Not a square.

a=3:

3*(9)+2*3+1=27+6+1=34. Not a square.

a=4:

3*(16)+8+1=48+8+1=57. Not a square.

a=5:

3*25 =75 + 10 +1 =86. Not a square.

a=6:

3*36=108 +12 +1=121. Oh wait, 121 is 11 squared. So b=11 when a=6.

Wait, but the question is asking for the smallest possible b. Is there a smaller a where this works?

Wait let me check a=0, but a must be positive, so a=0 isn't allowed.

Wait, what about a= something else? Let me try a=0, but since a must be positive, a=0 is invalid.

Wait, a= -1? No, a must be positive. Let me check a=1 again. At a=1, b²=6, which isn't a square. So a=6 gives b=11. Is there a smaller a where b² is a perfect square?

Wait, let's try a=2 again:

a=2: 3*(4)=12 +4+1=17 → not square.

a=3: 34 → no.

a=4:57 → no.

a=5:86 → no.

a=6:121 → yes, 11^2. So b=11.

Wait, but the options include lower numbers. Let me check the options given. The options are A:6, B:9, C:1, D:8, E:4, F:2, G:11, H:10, I:7, J:5. So the possible smallest b is 1, but only if possible. But from a=1, b²=6, which is not a square, so b can't be 1. Next, check if any a gives b=2.

Wait, let's think. For b=2, b²=4.

So, 3a² +2a +1 =4 → 3a² +2a -3=0.

Solve for a: discriminant is 4 + 36=40. sqrt(40) is about 6.32. So a = [-2 ±6.32]/6. Not integers. So no solution for a.

Similarly for b=3: b²=9.

3a² +2a +1=9 → 3a² +2a -8=0.

Discriminant: 4 + 96=100. So a = [-2 ±10]/6.

Positive solution: (8)/6 = 4/3 → not integer.

So a must be integer, so no solution.

b=4: b²=16.

3a² +2a +1=16 →3a² +2a -15=0.

Discriminant: 4 + 180=184. sqrt(184)=~13.56. a = [-2 ±13.56]/6.

Positive solution: (11.56)/6 ≈1.926. Not integer.

So no solution.

b=5: b²=25.

So 3a² +2a +1=25 →3a² +2a -24=0.

Discriminant:4 + 288=292. sqrt(292)=17. So a = [-2 +17]/6=15/6=2.5. Not integer.

No solution.

b=6: b²=36.

3a² +2a +1=36 →3a² +2a -35=0.

Discriminant:4 +420=424. sqrt(424)≈20.59. a=( -2 +20.59 )/(6)≈18.59/6≈3.1. Not integer.

No solution.

b=7:49.

So 3a² +2a +1=49 →3a² +2a -48=0.

Discriminant:4 + 576=580. sqrt(580)=~24.08. a=( -2 +24.08 )/6 ≈22.08/6≈3.68. Not integer.

No solution.

b=8:64.

So equation:3a² +2a +1=64 →3a² +2a -63=0.

Discriminant:4 +756=760. sqrt(760)=~27.57. a=( -2 +27.57 )/6≈25.57/6≈4.26. Not integer.

No solution.

b=9:81.

3a² +2a +1=81 →3a² +2a -80=0.

Discriminant:4 + 960=964. sqrt(964)=~31.04. a=( -2 +31.04 )/6≈29.04/6≈4.84. Not integer.

No solution.

b=10:100.

3a² +2a +1=100 →3a² +2a -99=0.

Discriminant:4 + 1188=1192. sqrt(1192)=~34.52.

a=( -2 +34.52 )/6≈32.52/6≈5.42. Not integer.

So next, b=11:121.

3a² +2a +1=121 →3a² +2a -120=0.

Discriminant:4 + 1440=1444. sqrt(1444)=38.

So a=( -2 +38 )/6=36/6=6. Which is integer. So a=6, b=11.

Is this the smallest possible b? From the checks above, the next possible b is 11. So the smallest possible b is 11, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the smallest possible b. So among the options, G is 11. Are there any smaller b possible? From the checks above, for a=1, b²=6, not square. a=2, b²=17. a=3, 34. a=4, 57. a=5,86. None are squares. So the next is a=6, which gives b=11.

So the answer is G:11.

To solve the problem, we start with the complex number \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers. The condition is that \( z^3 + z^2 + z \) is a real number, which means the imaginary part of this expression must be zero.

First, we compute \( z^2 \) and \( z^3 \):

1. \( z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + 2abi \).
2. \( z^3 = (a + bi)^3 = (a^3 - 3ab^2) + (3a^2b - b^3)i \).

Adding \( z^3 + z^2 + z \), we separate the real and imaginary parts:

- Real part: \( a^3 - 3ab^2 + a^2 - b^2 + a \).
- Imaginary part: \( 3a^2b - b^3 + 2ab + b \).

For the expression to be real, the imaginary part must equal zero:

\[
3a^2b - b^3 + 2ab + b = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( b \), we get:

\[
b(3a^2 - b^2 + 2a + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( b \) is a positive integer, \( b \neq 0 \), so we solve:

\[
3a^2 - b^2 + 2a + 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad b^2 = 3a^2 + 2a + 1.
\]

We need \( b^2 \) to be a perfect square. Testing small positive integer values of \( a \):

- For \( a = 1 \): \( b^2 = 3(1)^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 6 \), not a perfect square.
- For \( a = 2 \): \( b^2 = 3(2)^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 17 \), not a perfect square.
- For \( a = 3 \): \( b^2 = 3(3)^2 + 2(3) + 1 = 34 \), not a perfect square.
- For \( a = 4 \): \( b^2 = 3(4)^2 + 2(4) + 1 = 57 \), not a perfect square.
- For \( a = 5 \): \( b^2 = 3(5)^2 + 2(5) + 1 = 86 \), not a perfect square.
- For \( a = 6 \): \( b^2 = 3(6)^2 + 2(6) + 1 = 121 \), which is \( 11^2 \). Thus, \( b = 11 \).

Testing smaller values of \( b \) (e.g., \( b = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \)) shows that none of these values satisfy the equation \( b^2 = 3a^2 + 2a + 1 \) for any positive integer \( a \). Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( b \) is \( 11 \).

The answer is **G: 11**.
