Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer between iron and water. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Alright, so the setup is that a piece of iron is placed into some water, and I need to find the resulting temperature when they both reach thermal equilibrium. Right, because when two substances are in contact, the heat lost by the hotter one is gained by the cooler one until they're both at the same temperature.

Wait, the iron is at 95 degrees Celsius initially, and the water is at 25. So the iron is hotter, which means it will lose heat, and the water will gain that heat. But since they're both changing temperature, I need to calculate what that final temperature will be.

The problem gives me their masses and specific heat capacities. The specific heat of iron is 0.108 cal/(g°C), and for water, it's 1.0 cal/(g°C). Oh, right, water has a higher specific heat than iron, so it can absorb more heat without a big change in temperature.

So the formula I need is the principle of conservation of energy. The heat lost by the iron should equal the heat gained by the water. Mathematically, that's Q_iron = -Q_water. But since one is losing and the other is gaining, I'll set them as equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So I'll write it as m_iron * c_iron * (T_initial_iron - T_final) = m_water * c_water * (T_final - T_initial_water).

Let me plug in the numbers. The mass of iron is 20.0 grams, and its specific heat is 0.108. The initial temperature is 95°C. The water is 100 grams with a specific heat of 1.0, starting at 25°C. The final temperature is what I'm solving for.

So putting it in the equation:

20.0 g * 0.108 cal/g°C * (95 - T_final) = 100.0 g * 1.0 cal/g°C * (T_final - 25)

Let me compute each side step by step. First, calculate the left side (iron's heat change):

20 * 0.108 = 2.16. So 2.16 * (95 - T).

The right side is 100 * 1 = 100, so 100*(T -25).

So the equation becomes 2.16*(95 - T) = 100*(T -25)

Let me expand both sides:

2.16*95 = 2.16*95. Let's calculate that. 95 * 2 = 190, 95 * 0.16 is 15.2, so total 205.2. So 205.2 - 2.16 T = 100 T - 2500.

Wait, wait. Let's see:

Left side: 2.16*(95 - T) = 2.16*95 - 2.16 T = 205.2 - 2.16 T.

Right side: 100*(T -25) = 100 T - 2500.

So putting them together:

205.2 -2.16 T = 100 T -2500.

Now I want to get all the T terms on one side and constants on the other. Let me add 2.16 T to both sides and add 2500 to both sides.

205.2 +2500 = 100 T + 2.16 T.

So 2705.2 = 102.16 T.

Now solve for T: T = 2705.2 / 102.16.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 2705.2 divided by 102.16. Hmm, approximate division.

Wait, 102.16 times 26 is 102.16*20=2043.2, 102.16*6=613, so 2043.2+613=2656.2. That's 26 times.

The remaining is 2705.2 -2656.2=49.

So 49 /102.16 is about 0.48, so T is approximately 26.48 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. That can't be right because the iron was hotter than the water. So the final temperature should be somewhere between 25 and 95. If the calculation says 26.48, that's just a bit above the water's initial temperature, which seems a bit low. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should double-check my calculations. Let me redo the equations to make sure.

The setup is correct: the heat lost by iron equals the heat gained by water.

20g * 0.108 cal/g°C * (95 - T) = 100g * 1 cal/g°C * (T -25).

Compute 20 * 0.108: 20 *0.1 is 2, 20 *0.008 is 0.16. So 2.16. So 2.16*(95 - T) = 100*(T-25).

Expanding:

2.16 *95 = 205.2, so 205.2 -2.16 T = 100 T -2500.

Bring variables to one side:

205.2 +2500 = 100T +2.16 T → 2705.2 = 102.16 T.

So T=2705.2 /102.16 ≈ let's compute that.

102.16 *26 = 2656.16.

2705.2 -2656.16=49.04.

49.04 /102.16≈0.48. So 26.48°C.

Hmm, but wait, the iron is dropping from 95 to 26.48, which is a big drop. The water is rising from 25 to 26.48, a small increase. That seems plausible because water has a higher specific heat and more mass, so it can absorb a lot of heat without a big temperature change.

Wait, but the options given include 26.48°C as option E. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again: another way to approach this. Maybe I should calculate the heat capacities. The heat capacity of iron is m*c =20 *0.108=2.16 cal/°C. The water's is 100 *1=100 cal/°C. So the combined heat capacity is 102.16.

The temperature change would be determined by the heat exchange. But perhaps that's complicating it more.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it in another way. Let me see:

The equation I have is correct. So T=26.48°C, which is option E. So the answer should be E.

To determine the resulting temperature when a 20.0 g piece of iron at 95.0°C is placed in 100.0 g of water at 25.0°C, we use the principle of conservation of energy. The heat lost by the iron equals the heat gained by the water:

\[
m_{\text{iron}} \cdot c_{\text{iron}} \cdot (T_{\text{initial,iron}} - T_{\text{final}}) = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial,water}})
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
20.0 \cdot 0.108 \cdot (95.0 - T_{\text{final}}) = 100.0 \cdot 1.0 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 25.0)
\]

Simplify:
\[
2.16 \cdot (95.0 - T_{\text{final}}) = 100.0 \cdot (T_{\text{final}} - 25.0)
\]

Expand both sides:
\[
205.2 - 2.16T_{\text{final}} = 100T_{\text{final}} - 2500
\]

Rearrange terms:
\[
205.2 + 2500 = 100T_{\text{final}} + 2.16T_{\text{final}}
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2705.2 = 102.16T_{\text{final}}
\]

Solve for \(T_{\text{final}}\):
\[
T_{\text{final}} = \frac{2705.2}{102.16} \approx 26.48 \, \degree \text{C}
\]

The final temperature is 26.48°C, which matches option E. This result is consistent with the fact that water, having a higher specific heat and greater mass, absorbs most of the heat from the iron, resulting in only a small temperature increase for the water and a significant drop for the iron.
