Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: In a chemical reaction requiring two atoms of phosphorus for five atoms of oxygen, how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus? And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out the ratio of phosphorus to oxygen in the reaction. The problem states that two atoms of phosphorus react with five atoms of oxygen. Wait, so the ratio is 2 P to 5 O. But since atoms are involved, I might need to convert this into moles to use molar masses.

Right, because when dealing with grams, moles are key. So the first thing I should probably do is write down the molar masses of phosphorus and oxygen. I remember that the atomic mass of phosphorus (P) is about 30.97 g/mol, and oxygen (O) is around 16.00 g/mol. So each molecule of O2 would be 32.00 g/mol, but wait, in the reaction, are we talking about O2 molecules or just O atoms? The problem says five atoms of oxygen, so maybe it's O atoms, but in reality, oxygen is diatomic, so I might have to consider that. Wait, no, the problem says five atoms of O, so maybe it's O2, but let's see.

Wait, no, the problem is about the ratio of atoms, so perhaps the formula would be P2O5. Because if two P atoms react with five O atoms, the formula would be P₂O₅. That makes sense. So the formula weight of P₂O₅ would be (2 * 30.97) + (5 * 16.00) = let's calculate that.

Calculating 2 * 30.97: 30.97 * 2 = 61.94 g/mol.
5 * 16.00: 5 * 16 = 80 g/mol.
Adding them together: 61.94 + 80 = 141.94 g/mol. So the molar mass of P₂O₅ is about 141.94 g/mol.

But wait, the question is about how much oxygen is required for a given amount of phosphorus. So perhaps I should find the moles of phosphorus in 3.10 grams and then use the ratio to find the moles of oxygen needed, then convert that to grams.

Yes, that makes sense. So first, moles of P.

Molar mass of P is 30.97 g/mol. So moles of P = mass / molar mass = 3.10 g / 30.97 g/mol. Let me compute that.

3.10 divided by 30.97. Let me approximate: 30.97 is about 31, so 3.1 / 31 is about 0.1 moles. Wait, let me be more precise.

30.97 times 0.1 is 3.097. So 3.10 is a little more than that. Let me calculate 3.10 / 30.97.

I can write this as 3.10 / 30.97 = approximately 0.100 moles. Wait, let's do exact division.

30.97 goes into 3.10 once, but wait, 30.97 is larger than 3.10, so it's 0.100 approximately. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to do the exact calculation:

3.10 / 30.97 = ?

Let me compute 30.97 * 0.1 = 3.097, which is just under 3.10, so the moles are 0.1 + (3.10 - 3.097)/30.97.

The difference is 0.003, so 0.003 / 30.97 ≈ 0.0000969. So total moles ≈ 0.1000969, roughly 0.1001 moles of P.

Now, according to the reaction ratio, 2 atoms of P react with 5 atoms of O. So for every 2 moles of P, 5 moles of O are needed. So the mole ratio of P to O is 2:5.

Wait, so for each mole of P, how many moles of O are needed? Since 2 P :5 O, then per mole of P, it's (5/2) moles of O.

So moles of O needed = moles of P * (5/2).

So plugging in the moles of P as approximately 0.1001, we get 0.1001 * (5/2) = 0.1001 * 2.5 = 0.25025 moles of O.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Because in the compound P₂O₅, each formula unit has 2 P atoms and 5 O atoms. So the moles of O per mole of P would be (5/2) as each mole of P₂O₅ contains 2 moles of P and 5 moles of O. Wait, maybe another approach: the moles of P in P₂O₅ is 2, and O is 5. So for each mole of P, the moles of O would be (5/2). So that part is correct.

So the moles of O needed would be 0.1001 * (5/2) = 0.25025 moles of O atoms. But wait, oxygen is O₂ in reality, so perhaps I should consider that. Wait, but in the reaction ratio, it's per atom, so O atoms. So perhaps the problem is treating O as atomic, not as O₂.

Wait, the problem says five atoms of oxygen. So when we calculate moles of O atoms, we can then convert that to grams of O₂ if necessary, but wait, in the question, it's asking for grams of O, not O₂. So perhaps the question is considering O as atomic, but in reality, oxygen exists as O₂.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: it says "how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus?" So it's asking for grams of O, so perhaps it's considering O as atomic, but in reality, oxygen is O₂. But in the formula P₂O₅, it's O atoms. So perhaps in the reaction, the oxygen is in the form of O atoms. But in reality, when we talk about grams of oxygen, it's usually O₂ gas. Hmm, but the problem doesn't clarify, so I think we need to proceed with the assumption that it's O atoms, and the molar mass is 16.00 g/mol per atom.

Wait, no, the molar mass of O is 16.00 g/mol per mole of O atoms. So each O atom has a molar mass of 16 g/mol. So when we have 0.25025 moles of O atoms, the mass would be 0.25025 * 16.00 g/mol.

Wait, let me compute that.

0.25025 * 16 = ?

Well, 0.25 *16 is 4, so 0.25025 would be a little more than 4. Let me calculate precisely.

0.25025 * 16 = (0.25 * 16) + (0.00025 * 16)
0.25*16 = 4
0.00025 *16=0.004
So total is 4.004 grams of O.

Wait, but let me check my steps again because the answer options don't have 4.004, but option C is 4.00 g O, which is close. So perhaps that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Molar mass of P: 30.97 g/mol. Correct.
2. Moles of P in 3.10g: 3.10 /30.97 ≈ 0.1001 mol. Correct.
3. Reaction ratio: 2 P :5 O, so per mole of P, O needed is 5/2 =2.5 moles of O atoms. So 0.1001 * 2.5 ≈0.25025 moles O atoms. Correct.
4. Grams of O: 0.25025 mol * 16.00 g/mol =4.004 g. So approximately 4.00 g. Option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: perhaps the problem is referring to the formula P₂O₅, so for every 2 moles of P, 5 moles of O atoms are used. So perhaps the molar ratio is 2 P :5 O. So the number of moles of O would be (5/2) times the moles of P.

Yes, that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up a proportion based on the molar masses.

The reaction is 2 P + 5 O → P₂O₅. So the molar ratio is 2:5.

So for 3.10 grams of P, we can compute the required O in grams.

Molar mass of P: 30.97 g/mol. Moles of P: 3.10 /30.97 ≈0.1001 mol.

The mole ratio of P:O is 2:5, so moles of O needed = (5/2) * moles of P.

So, 5/2 * 0.1001 =0.25025 mol O atoms.

Mass of O = moles O atoms * molar mass of O.

Molar mass of O is 16.00 g/mol. So 0.25025 *16 =4.004 g. So approximately 4.00 grams. So option C.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4.00 g O. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I got confused between O atoms and O2 molecules.

Wait, the problem says five atoms of oxygen, so it's O atoms, not O₂. So when calculating moles of O, it's O atoms, each with a molar mass of 16 g/mol. So mass would be 0.25025 *16 =4.004 g, which rounds to 4.00 g, so option C.

Another way: using the molar mass of P₂O₅. Let's see.

Molar mass of P₂O₅ is (2*30.97) + (5*16) =61.94 +80=141.94 g/mol.

So, 3.10 grams of P: how much P₂O₅ would that be?

Wait, but perhaps that's unnecessary. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the mass of O in P₂O₅.

Wait, let's see. The formula is P₂O₅, so for each mole of P₂O₅, there are 2 moles of P and 5 moles of O.

So, the mass percent of P in P₂O₅ is (2*30.97)/141.94 =61.94/141.94 ≈0.4363 or 43.63%.

So, if I have 3.10 grams of P, that would correspond to how much P₂O₅?

Wait, mass of P in P₂O₅: 3.10g = 43.63% of the molar mass of P₂O₅.

So, mass of P₂O₅ = 3.10 / 0.4363 ≈7.10 grams.

Then, the mass of O in P₂O₅ would be 5 moles O per mole of P₂O₅.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the mass of O in P₂O₅ as (mass of P₂O₅) * (mass fraction of O).

The mass fraction of O in P₂O₅ is (80)/141.94 ≈0.5636 or 56.36%.

So, mass of O would be 7.10 g * 0.5636 ≈4.00 grams.

Yes, same result as before. So 4.00 grams of O, which is option C.

So I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is C.

To determine how many grams of oxygen are required by 3.10 g of phosphorus in a reaction where 2 atoms of phosphorus react with 5 atoms of oxygen, we proceed as follows:

1. **Molar Masses**:  
   - Molar mass of phosphorus (P): 30.97 g/mol  
   - Molar mass of oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol  

2. **Moles of Phosphorus**:  
   The number of moles of phosphorus in 3.10 g is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of P} = \frac{\text{Mass of P}}{\text{Molar Mass of P}} = \frac{3.10}{30.97} \approx 0.1001 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Reaction Ratio**:  
   From the reaction, 2 moles of P react with 5 moles of O. Therefore, the mole ratio of P to O is \( 2:5 \). For every mole of P, \( \frac{5}{2} \) moles of O are required.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of O} = \text{Moles of P} \times \frac{5}{2} = 0.1001 \times 2.5 \approx 0.25025 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Mass of Oxygen**:  
   The mass of oxygen is calculated by multiplying the moles of O by the molar mass of O:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of O} = \text{Moles of O} \times \text{Molar Mass of O} = 0.25025 \times 16.00 \approx 4.004 \, \text{g}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The calculated mass of oxygen is approximately 4.00 g, which corresponds to option C.
