Question:

A defendant suspected her long-term boyfriend was cheating on her. On a hunch, she went to her boyfriend's apartment one afternoon and, using her key, she entered the apartment. Once inside, she found her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in bed together. In a rage, the defendant retrieved the gun from the nightstand and killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend. After the shooting, the defendant left on a two-day trip to the mountains to get the week's events off her mind. She called her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment while she was gone and to look after her 4-year-old daughter. That night, after the defendant left, the police came to the apartment. They asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found in the defendant's bedroom the gun used to kill her boyfriend. At a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial, which of the following facts would the defendant's attorney be LEAST likely to attempt to prove?

Options:

A: The neighbor did not have the authority to give permission to search the apartment.
B: The police did not read the neighbor her rights before asking for consent to search.
C: The defendant's daughter was not present at the time of the search.
D: The defendant did not own the gun used to kill her boyfriend.
E: The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.
F: The gun was not visible without a thorough search of the defendant's bedroom.
G: The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.
H: The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.
I: The defendant had an alibi for the time of the murder.
J: The police did not have a search warrant.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically regarding the Fourth Amendment and searches. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant who kills her boyfriend and his girlfriend, then leaves her apartment with a neighbor taking care of it. The police come, ask the neighbor for permission to search, and the neighbor agrees. They find the gun used in the crime. Now, the defendant is moving to suppress the gun as evidence, and the question is about which fact her attorney is least likely to try to prove.

So, the issue is whether the neighbor had the authority to consent to the search. Under the Fourth Amendment, a third party can consent to a search if they have actual authority over the premises. Actual authority can be shown by mutual use and access, or if the defendant gave the neighbor permission to be there and make decisions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The neighbor didn't have authority to give permission. This seems relevant because if the neighbor didn't have actual authority, the consent might be invalid. So the defense would likely argue this.

Option B: Police didn't read the neighbor her rights. Wait, Miranda rights are about custodial interrogation, not about consent to search. So this might not matter. Unless the police are coercing the neighbor, which isn't indicated here. So maybe B isn't a point the defense would focus on because Miranda doesn't apply.

Option C: Defendant's daughter wasn't present. I'm not sure how this is relevant. Maybe if the daughter was the one with authority, but in this case, the neighbor was taking care of the apartment. So maybe C isn't the point to argue.

Option D: Defendant didn't own the gun. That's about whether the gun belongs to her, but the issue is the search's legality, not ownership. Unless it's about standing, but if the gun was in her bedroom, maybe she has standing regardless of ownership. But I'm not sure if this is relevant here.

Option E: Police threatened the neighbor. If the consent was coerced, then it's not voluntary. So the defense would argue that the consent was invalid because of coercion. So E is something they would bring up.

Option F: Gun wasn't visible without thorough search. This relates to the scope of the consent. If the neighbor allowed a search, but the gun was hidden, maybe the police exceeded the scope. But if the neighbor gave permission to search the apartment, including bedrooms, then maybe it's within scope. Not sure, but F could be a point.

Option G: Defendant gave neighbor the keys. This suggests the neighbor had authority, so the defense would argue against that. Wait, no. If the defendant gave keys, that implies the neighbor has authority. So the defense would try to prove that the neighbor didn't have the authority. So G's fact would be something the prosecution might use, but the defense would argue against that. So the defense would not want G to be a fact, but in the question, we're looking for what the defense is least likely to attempt to prove. So maybe G is not something the defense would argue because it shows the neighbor had authority.

Wait, the question is which fact the defendant's attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove. So, the correct answer is the one that's not relevant to the defense's case.

In a motion to suppress, the defendant's attorney would argue that the search was unconstitutional, so they would try to show that the neighbor didn't have authority, that the consent was coerced, that the police didn't have a warrant, etc.

So looking back, Option B is about Miranda rights, which are not applicable here. Because when police ask for consent to search, Miranda warnings aren't required. Miranda applies when someone is in custody and being questioned. The neighbor wasn't being interrogated; she was giving consent. So the fact that police didn't read her Miranda rights wouldn't make the consent invalid. Therefore, the defendant's attorney is least likely to try to prove B.

Another point is Option D: the gun ownership. If the gun wasn't hers, maybe she can't challenge the search because she doesn't have standing. But in this case, the gun was found in her bedroom, so she has standing regardless of ownership. So D might not be the best point to argue.

Wait, but the gun's ownership might affect whether it's admissible as evidence against her. But the question is about the search's legality. So D isn't directly relevant to the search issue. So the defense might not focus on D because it doesn't affect the search's validity.

Alternatively, if the gun wasn't hers, maybe the police had no probable cause, but that's a different issue. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about which fact the defense attorney is least likely to prove. So, which of these is irrelevant or not useful for the defense.

So, the irrelevant points would be B and D, perhaps. Because B is about Miranda, which doesn't apply, and D is about ownership, which doesn't impact the search's legality.

So, the defense would be more likely to argue A (lack of authority), E (coercion), F (scope), G (authority via keys), H (instructions not to let people in), I (alibi), J (no warrant). But B and D are less likely.

Wait, the question is about the motion to suppress the gun. So the attorney's arguments would focus on the legality of the search and seizure. So Miranda (B) is not relevant. Ownership (D) might affect whether the evidence is tied to the defendant, but not the search's legality.

So, in a motion to suppress, the court is concerned with whether the search was lawful, not with whether the evidence links the defendant to the crime. So D is about the gun's ownership, which is more relevant at trial when the prosecution tries to connect the defendant to the crime. So in the suppression hearing, D is not relevant, so the attorney wouldn't try to prove D.

Wait, but the question is which fact the attorney is least likely to attempt to prove. So, which fact is not useful in the motion to suppress.

So, looking at the options, the attorney would likely argue A, E, F, G, H, J. B and D are not as relevant.

So, the options are B and D. So which is the least likely?

The question is which fact the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove. So, which fact is least relevant to the legality of the search.

Miranda (B) is about the neighbor's rights during questioning, which doesn't affect the consent to search. So B is not relevant.

Ownership (D) is about whether the defendant owned the gun, which doesn't directly affect the legality of the search. It might affect the admissibility as evidence against her, but not the search itself. So, in a suppression hearing, D is not relevant, so the attorney wouldn't focus on it.

Wait, but if the gun wasn't hers, maybe she doesn't have standing to challenge the search. But in this case, the gun was found in her bedroom, so she has standing regardless. So D isn't about standing, but about ownership, which doesn't impact the search's legality.

So, in the motion to suppress, the attorney would focus on the search's legality, not on the gun's ownership. So the fact in D is not something the attorney would care about in this context.

So, the options that the attorney is least likely to prove are B and D.

But the question is which one is the answer. The options are A through J, and the correct answer is the one the attorney wouldn't try to prove.

So, looking back, the question is about which fact is least likely to be proven by the defense attorney.

The correct answer is B, because Miranda warnings are irrelevant to consent. Or D, because ownership isn't relevant to the search's legality.

Wait, another approach: for a motion to suppress, the defendant must have standing. If she has standing, she can challenge the search. But if the gun isn't hers, does that affect standing? No, because the search was of her apartment, her bedroom. So she has standing regardless of the gun's ownership. So D is irrelevant to the motion.

Thus, the attorney wouldn't attempt to prove D because it doesn't impact the search's legality. Similarly, B is irrelevant because Miranda doesn't apply.

So, the question is which of these is the least likely fact the attorney would attempt to prove.

Looking at the options, the question is about the defendant's attorney attempting to prove facts that would make the search invalid. So, which fact is not useful for that.

The answer would be B or D.

But I think B is the correct answer because Miranda has nothing to do with consent. So the attorney wouldn't bother proving that the police didn't read Miranda rights because it's irrelevant. On the other hand, D is about ownership, which might not be relevant either.

Wait, but the gun's ownership could be relevant if the defendant claims that the gun wasn't hers, so the police can't tie it to her. But that's for trial, not for the suppression hearing.

In the suppression motion, the focus is on how the evidence was obtained. So whether the gun was hers doesn't matter; what matters is whether the police legally obtained it.

So, the attorney would not care about proving D in the suppression hearing. So the least likely fact to prove is D.

Wait, but the options for the question are from A to J, and the answer is one of them.

Alternatively, let's think about the elements of a valid consent search. For consent to be valid, the person giving consent must have actual authority, and the consent must be voluntary.

So, to challenge the consent, the defense would argue that the neighbor didn't have authority (A), or that the consent was coerced (E), or that the police exceeded the scope (F), and that the defendant did not give the neighbor permission (so G is a fact that the prosecution would bring up, but the defense would argue against it. Wait, no, the defense would argue that the neighbor didn't have authority, so G is a fact that supports the prosecution. So the defense would try to show that the neighbor didn't have authority, perhaps by showing that the defendant didn't give the keys. Wait, the question says the defendant gave the neighbor the keys. Wait, in the scenario, the defendant called the neighbor to take care of the apartment and look after her daughter. So the neighbor had the keys. So G is a fact that the prosecution would use to argue that the neighbor had authority. So the defense would argue against that, perhaps by showing that the neighbor didn't have authority beyond, say, collecting mail, but the defense would not try to prove G because G supports the prosecution's case. Wait, but the question is about what the defense is least likely to prove, so perhaps G is something the defense would not attempt because it's against their case. Or maybe the defense would try to disprove G, but the question is which fact they are least likely to attempt to prove.

Wait, the options are about what the defense attorney would attempt to prove. So, for example, the defense attorney would try to prove A (neighbor lacked authority), E (consent was coerced), F (gun not in plain view), H (defendant told neighbor not to let anyone in), etc.

So, which of the options is something the defense attorney wouldn't care about?

Option B is about Miranda. The defense attorney wouldn't care because consent doesn't require Miranda warnings. So B is irrelevant.

Option D is about gun ownership. The defense attorney in the suppression motion wouldn't care because it doesn't affect the search's legality.

So, the attorney is least likely to attempt to prove B or D.

But which is the correct answer? The question is asking which fact the attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove.

In the context of a motion to suppress, which focuses on the legality of the search, the issue is whether the neighbor had the authority to consent. Therefore, the attorney would focus on A, E, F, G, H, J. They might also argue that the police didn't have a warrant (J) and that the consent was invalid because of coercion (E), or that the neighbor didn't have authority (A), or that the search went beyond the scope (F), etc.

Miranda (B) is irrelevant, so the attorney wouldn't try to prove that. Similarly, the gun ownership (D) is irrelevant because the legality of the search doesn't depend on who owns the gun.

So, between B and D, both are irrelevant, but B is more clearly irrelevant because it's about Miranda, which doesn't apply. D is about ownership, which is more about the evidence's relevance at trial than the search's legality.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: the police did not read the neighbor her rights before asking for consent.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, if the person giving consent is in custody or being coerced, their consent might not be voluntary. But Miranda is about interrogation, not about consent. So even if the neighbor was in custody, Miranda wouldn't apply unless they were being questioned. So B is definitely not relevant.

So, the answer should be B.

In this scenario, the defendant's attorney is challenging the legality of the search and seizure of the gun used in the crime. The key issue is whether the neighbor had the authority to consent to the search and whether the consent was voluntary. The question asks which fact the defendant's attorney would be least likely to attempt to prove during the motion to suppress.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The neighbor did not have the authority to give permission to search the apartment.  
   This is directly relevant because the validity of the search depends on whether the neighbor had actual authority to consent. The defense would likely argue this to challenge the search's legality.

2. **Option B**: The police did not read the neighbor her rights before asking for consent to search.  
   Miranda rights are unrelated to consent to search. Miranda applies to custodial interrogation, not to requests for consent. Therefore, this fact is irrelevant to the legality of the search, and the defense would be least likely to focus on this.

3. **Option C**: The defendant's daughter was not present at the time of the search.  
   This fact is irrelevant to the issue of the neighbor's authority to consent or the voluntariness of the consent. The daughter's presence or absence does not impact the search's legality.

4. **Option D**: The defendant did not own the gun used to kill her boyfriend.  
   While this fact might be relevant at trial to challenge the connection between the defendant and the crime, it is irrelevant to the motion to suppress, which focuses on the legality of the search. The defense would not prioritize this fact in the suppression hearing.

5. **Option E**: The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.  
   This is relevant because it speaks to the voluntariness of the neighbor's consent. If the consent was coerced, it would invalidate the search. The defense would likely argue this.

6. **Option F**: The gun was not visible without a thorough search of the defendant's bedroom.  
   This could challenge the scope of the consent. If the consent was limited but the police conducted a more extensive search, this would be relevant. The defense would likely argue this.

7. **Option G**: The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.  
   This supports the idea that the neighbor had authority to consent to the search. The defense would likely argue against this fact, but it is still relevant to the motion to suppress.

8. **Option H**: The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.  
   This could challenge the neighbor's authority to consent, as it suggests the neighbor was explicitly instructed not to allow others into the apartment. The defense would likely argue this.

9. **Option I**: The defendant had an alibi for the time of the murder.  
   This is irrelevant to the motion to suppress, as it pertains to the defendant's guilt or innocence rather than the legality of the search.

10. **Option J**: The police did not have a search warrant.  
    This is directly relevant because a warrantless search is presumptively unreasonable unless an exception applies (e.g., consent). The defense would likely argue this.

### Conclusion:
The motion to suppress focuses on the legality of the search, particularly the validity of the neighbor's consent. Facts like Miranda rights (B) and gun ownership (D) are irrelevant in this context. However, Miranda rights (B) are entirely unrelated to the issue of consent, making it the fact the defense is least likely to attempt to prove.

**Answer: B**
