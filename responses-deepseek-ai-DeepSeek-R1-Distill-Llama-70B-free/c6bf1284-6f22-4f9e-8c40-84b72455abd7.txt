Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Okada's property taxes and how much goes to education. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to find out the assessed value of his home. The market value is $28,750, and homes are assessed at 38% of that. So I think I should calculate 38% of 28,750. Let me do that: 28,750 multiplied by 0.38. Let's see, 28,750 times 0.3 is 8,625, and 28,750 times 0.08 is 2,300. Adding those together gives 10,925. So the assessed value is $10,925.

Next, I need to find out how much property tax he pays. The tax rate is $8.42 per $100 of assessed value. So I guess I take the assessed value, which is 10,925, and divide by 100 to get 109.25. Then multiply that by 8.42. Let me do that math: 109.25 * 8.42. Hmm, 100 times 8.42 is 842, and 9.25 times 8.42. Let's calculate 9 * 8.42 = 75.78 and 0.25 * 8.42 is 2.105. So 75.78 + 2.105 = 77.885. Adding that to 842 gives 919.885. So the total tax is approximately $919.89.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Oh wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. 109.25 * 8.42. Let's break it down: 100 * 8.42 = 842, 9 * 8.42 = 75.78, 0.25 * 8.42 = 2.105. So 842 + 75.78 = 917.78, plus 2.105 makes 919.885. So yes, around $919.89 in taxes.

Now, 47% of that tax goes to education. So I calculate 47% of 919.89. Let me compute that. 919.89 * 0.47. Hmm, 900 * 0.47 is 423, and 19.89 * 0.47. Let me calculate 19 * 0.47 = 8.93, and 0.89 *0.47 is about 0.4183. So 8.93 + 0.4183 is 9.3483. Adding to 423 gives 432.3483. So approximately $432.35.

Looking at the options, option D is $432.35. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine how much of Mr. Okada's property taxes goes toward education, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the assessed value of the home**:  
   The market value of the home is $28,750, and homes are assessed at 38% of their market value.  
   \[
   \text{Assessed Value} = 28,750 \times 0.38 = 10,925
   \]

2. **Calculate the property taxes**:  
   The tax rate is $8.42 per $100 of assessed value.  
   \[
   \text{Property Taxes} = \left(\frac{10,925}{100}\right) \times 8.42 = 919.89
   \]

3. **Determine the portion of taxes spent on education**:  
   47% of the property taxes are allocated to education.  
   \[
   \text{Taxes for Education} = 919.89 \times 0.47 = 432.35
   \]

Thus, the amount of Mr. Okada's taxes that goes toward education is **$432.35**.
