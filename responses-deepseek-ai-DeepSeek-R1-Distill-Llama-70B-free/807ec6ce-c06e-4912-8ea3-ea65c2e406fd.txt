Question:

A homeowner said to a roofer, "My roof leaks. I think the old tiles are cracked. If you will replace them with all new tiles, I will pay you $5,000. " The roofer replied, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule. " The homeowner then remarked, "That's all right, but let me know soon. " Three days later, the roofer drove his pickup truck to the homeowner's home and unloaded the materials and equipment needed to perform the roofing job. When the homeowner looked out his window and saw what was transpiring, he immediately ran outside and exclaimed, "Stop! The deal's off. I decided to repair the roof myself. "In an action by the roofer against the homeowner for breach of contract, which of the following would provide the roofer with his best theory of recovery?

Options:

A: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to reject the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.
B: The roofer can recover because the homeowner breached the contract by deciding to repair the roof himself.
C: A unilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule."
D: A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule. "
E: A bilateral contract was formed when the homeowner said, "That's all right, but let me know soon."
F: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a bilateral contract, and the roofer accepted the offer by purchasing the materials and equipment needed for the job.
G: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed for the job.
H: A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed to do the job.
I: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.
J: The homeowner made an offer that proposed a bilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer unloaded the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.

The homeowner tells the roofer that the roof leaks, thinks the tiles are cracked, and offers to pay $5,000 if the roofer replaces them with new tiles. The roofer replies, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule." Then the homeowner says it's alright but asks to know soon. Three days later, the roofer shows up with materials, starts unloading, and the homeowner stops him, saying he's doing it himself.

The question is about which option gives the roofer the best chance to recover for breach of contract.

Hmm, I remember that contracts can be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral contract is where the offer requires performance as acceptance, and until that performance is done, the offer can be revoked. A bilateral contract is where the acceptance is just a promise.

In this case, the homeowner's offer was to pay $5k if the roofer replaces the tiles. So the offer is asking for action—replacing tiles—as the acceptance. That sounds like a unilateral contract because the acceptance is performance, not a promise.

So when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my schedule," that might have been a statement of intention but not an acceptance. Because in a unilateral contract, the roofer would accept by starting performance, not by promising to perform.

Wait, but wait. The homeowner's offer was to replace the tiles for $5k. The roofer's reply was more like a conditional acceptance or maybe just a statement that he might accept if he can clear his schedule. But in unilateral contracts, the offer is accepted by performing the act, not by promising to perform.

So the next part: three days later, the roofer shows up and starts unloading materials. At that point, he's beginning performance. But the homeowner stops him and says he's canceling.

Now, in a unilateral contract, once the offeree starts performance, the offeror can't revoke the offer anymore. Because under the doctrine of irrevocability upon commencement, once the offeree starts performing, the offer becomes irrevocable, and the offeror can't back out.

Wait, but is that the case here? Let me think. The offer was for the roofer to replace the tiles; the acceptance would be doing so. So when the roofer starts unloading materials, he's starting the performance. Therefore, the offer should become irrevocable at that point.

But the homeowner tried to revoke it when the roofer was starting. So if the offer was a unilateral one, and the roofer began performance, the offer can't be revoked. So the homeowner is in breach if he tries to stop it.

But let me look at the options.

Option A: Homeowner made a unilateral offer, roofer rejected by starting performance. That doesn't make sense. Starting performance would be acceptance, not rejection.

Option B: Roofer can recover because homeowner breached. That might be correct, but I need to see the reasoning.

Option C: Unilateral contract formed when roofer said "Sure...". No, because that was a statement of possible future action, not an acceptance. The offer was unilateral, so the acceptance would be action, not a promise.

Option D: Bilateral contract when roofer said that. No, because the offer was unilateral. Roofer's statement was not a promise but a condition.

Option E: Bilateral when homeowner said "let me know soon". No, because the initial offer was unilateral.

Option F: Homeowner made bilateral offer, roofer accepted by purchasing materials. No, because the offer was for performance, not a promise, so it's unilateral.

Option G: Homeowner's offer was unilateral, and became irrevocable when roofer purchased materials. Purchasing materials might be part of starting performance. So when the roofer began performance (buying materials and showing up), the offer became irrevocable.

Option H: Bilateral contract when roofer bought materials. No, again, offer was unilateral.

Option I: Homeowner's offer was unilateral, roofer accepted by starting performance (unloading). That seems right because starting performance would be acceptance in a unilateral contract.

Option J: Bilateral, and offer became irrevocable when materials unloaded. No, because it's a unilateral offer.

So, looking at the options. The correct theory is that the offer was unilateral, and when the roofer started performance, the offer became irrevocable.

So the best option would be either G or I.

Wait, the difference between G and I. 

Option G says the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased materials. Option I says the roofer accepted by beginning performance.

Wait, but the doctrine is that once the offeree begins performance in a unilateral contract, the offer becomes irrevocable. So when the roofer started unloading, that's when he began performance, so the offer couldn't be revoked.

So option I says the roofer accepted by starting performance (unloading). But in a unilateral contract, acceptance is the performance, so when he started, the contract was formed, and the offer couldn't be revoked.

Alternatively, option G says the offer became irrevocable when he purchased materials, which might be before starting performance. But I'm not sure if purchasing materials is enough. The performance is replacing the roof, so unloading the materials is part of starting that performance.

Therefore, I think the correct option is I: The homeowner made a unilateral offer, and the roofer accepted by beginning performance. So the contract was formed when he started unloading, and the homeowner couldn't revoke it.

Alternatively, option G suggests that the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased materials. But purchasing materials is part of his preparation, not the actual performance. So perhaps the irrevocability happens when he starts the performance on the homeowner's property.

Wait, but the question is about the best theory for the roofer. He would argue that the contract was formed when he began performance, making the offer irrevocable. So the breach would be when the homeowner stopped him.

Wait, but the homeowner tried to stop him before he completed the job. So the roofer would sue for the loss of the contract, like the $5k minus any mitigation.

So looking back, the options:

Option G: Offer became irrevocable when he purchased materials. But I think the doctrine requires that the offeree has begun performance, not just preparation.

So the better option is I: The offer was unilateral, and the roofer accepted by starting performance (unloading materials), making the offer irrevocable. Therefore, the homeowner breached the contract.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The scenario involves a homeowner offering to pay $5,000 for a roofer to replace leaking roof tiles. The homeowner's offer was for a unilateral contract, where acceptance is demonstrated through performance (replacing the tiles), not a promise. The roofer's initial response, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule," was not an acceptance but a statement of intent. 

Three days later, the roofer started performance by unloading materials at the homeowner's house. At this point, under the doctrine of irrevocability in unilateral contracts, the offer became irrevocable because the roofer had commenced performance. When the homeowner attempted to revoke the offer by stopping the roofer, he breached the contract.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The roofer did not reject the offer; starting performance constitutes acceptance, not rejection.
- **Option B**: Correct conclusion but lacks the legal reasoning tied to unilateral contracts and irrevocability.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A unilateral contract was not formed when the roofer said, "Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule," as this was not acceptance.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. A bilateral contract was not formed because the offer required performance, not a promise, for acceptance.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The exchange did not create a bilateral contract when the homeowner said, "That's all right, but let me know soon."
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The offer was unilateral, requiring performance for acceptance, not a bilateral contract.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Purchasing materials is preparation, not performance. Irrevocability begins when performance starts.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. No bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased materials.
- **Option I**: Correct. The homeowner made a unilateral offer, and the roofer accepted by beginning performance (unloading materials), making the offer irrevocable.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The offer was unilateral, not bilateral, and irrevocability began with performance, not unloading materials.

The best theory for the roofer is that the homeowner made a unilateral offer, and the roofer accepted by starting performance, rendering the offer irrevocable. The homeowner's attempt to revoke the offer constituted a breach of contract.
