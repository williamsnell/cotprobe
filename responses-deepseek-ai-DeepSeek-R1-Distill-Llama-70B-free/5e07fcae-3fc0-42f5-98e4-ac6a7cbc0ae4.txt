Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about secondary research. Hmm, I need to figure out which activity it involves. Let me start by recalling what secondary research is. From what I remember, secondary research is about using existing data that others have collected. It's different from primary research, where you gather data yourself through experiments, surveys, interviews, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Examining public records. Public records are existing data, so that fits. Secondary research would involve looking at these records.

Option B: Observing people. That sounds more like primary research because you're collecting data directly by watching behavior.

Option C: Writing a novel. That's creative writing, not related to research methods.

Option D: Conducting a scientific experiment. That's definitely primary research since you're generating new data.

Option E: Conducting a survey. Surveys collect original data, so that's primary.

Option F: Interviewing people. Again, primary research since you're gathering new information.

Option G: Collecting soil samples. That's hands-on data collection, primary research.

Option H: Coding a computer program. That's more about software development, not research.

Option I: Designing a building. That's architecture, not related to research.

So the only one that fits secondary research is A: Examining public records. Because you're using data that's already been collected and made public.

The correct answer is A: Examining public records. Secondary research involves using existing data, and examining public records fits this definition as it relies on pre-collected information.

Answer: A
