Okay, so I've got this titration question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me try to work through it. Alright, so the scenario is a student did five titrations and got a mean result of 0.110 M. The standard deviation is 0.001 M. The actual concentration is 0.100 M. I need to figure out if the results are accurate, precise, both, or neither.

Wait, right, accuracy and precision are two different things. Accuracy refers to how close the results are to the true value, which is 0.100 here. Precision is about how close the repeated measurements are to each other. So if the standard deviation is low, that means the results are precise because they're all bunched together.

In this case, the mean is 0.110, which is higher than 0.100. So the average isn't matching the actual value. That suggests the results might not be accurate. But the standard deviation is 0.001, which is pretty low. Wait, does a low standard deviation mean high precision? Oh yeah, because standard deviation measures the spread. So with a low SD, the values are close to each other, meaning precise.

So putting that together, the mean is off from the actual value, which means the results are not accurate. But since the standard deviation is small, the measurements are precise. So the conclusion is that the results are precise but not accurate.

Looking at the options, option C says "Precise but not accurate." That should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Precision is about consistency, right? So all five titrations gave results close to 0.110, so that's precise. But the actual value is 0.100, so they're not hitting the mark. So yeah, it's precise but not accurate. So option C is the right choice.

The student's titration results have a mean of 0.110 M and a standard deviation of 0.001 M. Accuracy is determined by how close the mean is to the actual concentration (0.100 M), while precision is determined by how consistent the measurements are, indicated by a low standard deviation.

In this case, the mean (0.110 M) is significantly higher than the actual concentration (0.100 M), indicating that the results are not accurate. However, the low standard deviation (0.001 M) shows that the measurements are very consistent, meaning the results are precise. Therefore, the titration results are precise but not accurate.

Answer: C
