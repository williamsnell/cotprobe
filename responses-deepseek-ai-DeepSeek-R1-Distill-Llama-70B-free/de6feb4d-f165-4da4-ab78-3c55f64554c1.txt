Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the momentum uncertainty of a tennis ball in a fence enclosure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is involved here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. The formula is something like Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where Δx is the uncertainty in position, Δp the uncertainty in momentum, and h is Planck's constant.

So the problem says the tennis ball is constrained in a fence of length 35 meters. I think that means the uncertainty in position, Δx, is approximately equal to the length of the enclosure. So Δx would be 35 meters. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes in these problems, if the particle is confined to a region, the uncertainty is taken as the length of that region. So I think that's right, Δx is 35 m.

Now, Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. I remember that value. So putting it into the equation, Δp would be at least h/(4πΔx).

Let me calculate that. So Δp ≈ (6.626e-34) / (4 * π * 35). Let me compute the denominator first. 4 times π is about 12.566, and 12.566 multiplied by 35 is... 35 * 12 is 420, 35 * 0.566 is about 19.81. So total around 439.81. So denominator is approximately 439.81.

So Δp = 6.626e-34 / 439.81. Let me compute that. Let me see, 6.626 divided by 440 is roughly 0.01505. So 6.626e-34 / 4.4e2 = 0.01505e-34 / 1e0 = 1.505e-36 kg·m/s. Wait, because the units would be kg·m/s since h has units J·s which is kg·m²/s, and dividing by meters (Δx) gives kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're all in the order of 1e-35 or 1e-36. My calculation gives about 1.5e-36, which is 1.5 x 10^-36 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, option E is 2e-36, which is close but a bit higher. Option H is 1e-36, which is a bit lower. Hmm. Maybe I should check my calculations again to see if I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I approximated too much. Let me compute the denominator more accurately. 4 * π is about 12.566370614. Multiply by 35: 35 * 12.566370614.

Let me compute 35 *12 =420, 35*0.56637= Let's see, 35 * 0.5 is 17.5, 35 *0.06637 is approximately 2.32295. So total 17.5 + 2.32295=19.82295. So total denominator is 420 +19.82295=439.82295, which is approximately 439.823.

So h/(4πΔx) is 6.626e-34 / 439.823. Let's compute that.

6.626 / 439.823 ≈ let's see, 6.626 ÷ 440 is about 0.015045. So 0.015045e-34 is 1.5045e-36 kg·m/s.

So it's approximately 1.5e-36. Looking back at the options, the closest one is E: 2e-36, but that's a bit higher. Or H is 1e-36, lower.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the uncertainty in position is not the full length, but something like half of it or another fraction. Because in a box, the uncertainty in position is often taken as the width of the box, but sometimes it's approximated as L, sometimes as L/2. Wait, when you confine a particle in a box of length L, the uncertainty in position is about L, not L/2. Because the particle is somewhere between 0 and L. So I think the initial approach was correct.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is expecting to use h/(2π) instead of h/(4π). Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle can be written in different forms. The most common form is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is h/(2π). Oh wait, wait, let me check: the inequality is Δx Δp ≥ (h/(4π)).

So I think my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but another point: the mass of the tennis ball. Wait, the problem says "momentum uncertainty", so the formula I used gives the minimum uncertainty. But wait, the actual uncertainty could be larger, but the question is asking for the minimum, I suppose.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh no, wait, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, but the momentum itself is mass times velocity. Wait, no, the formula I used (Δp ≈ h/(4πΔx)) is correct for the minimum uncertainty. Because Δp is the standard deviation, and the lower bound is given by that formula.

So the calculation gives about 1.5e-36 kg·m/s. But looking at the options, the closest is E: 2e-36, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the numbers.

Wait, let me compute 6.626e-34 divided by 439.823 accurately.

6.626e-34 / 439.823 = (6.626 / 439.823) * 1e-34.

Calculate 6.626 / 439.823:

439.823 goes into 6.626 how many times? Let's see, 439.823 * 0.015 is 6.597. Oh, 0.015 *439.823=6.597. So 6.626 is a bit more than 0.015. The difference is 6.626 -6.597=0.029.

So 0.029 /439.823 = approximately 0.0000659. So total is 0.0150659.

So approximately 0.0150659e-34 is 1.50659e-36. So 1.506e-36, which rounds to about 1.5e-36.

Looking at the options, the closest would be E: 2e-36, which is a bit higher, or H:1e-36, which is lower. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the length is 35 meters, but the uncertainty in position is 35/2, because the ball is constrained within a region of length 35, so the maximum uncertainty would be about half of that. Wait, no, I don't think that's the case. The uncertainty in position is the range in which the particle is confined, so 35 meters. If it's somewhere in a 35m fence, the uncertainty Δx is 35m.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact value of pi as 3.1416, but I think for the purposes of this calculation, the approximation is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute Δp more accurately.

Let me do precise calculation:

Δp = h/(4πΔx) = (6.62607015e-34 J·s) / (4 * π * 35 m)

Compute denominator: 4 * π = 12.566370614. Multiply by 35: 12.566370614 *35 = let's calculate.

12 *35=420. 0.566370614 *35= approx 19.822958. So total 420 +19.822958=439.822958 m.

So denominator is 439.822958 m.

So Δp = 6.62607015e-34 / 439.822958.

Calculate 6.62607015 / 439.822958 = let's see.

439.822958 × 0.015 = 6.59734537.

Subtract that from 6.62607015: 6.62607015 -6.59734537=0.02872478.

Now, 0.02872478 /439.822958 = approx 0.0000653.

So total is 0.0150653.

So 0.0150653e-34 is 1.50653e-36 kg·m/s.

So about 1.5065e-36.

Looking at the options again:

A:3e-36

B:6e-36

C:7e-36

D:8e-36

E:2e-36

F:5e-36

G:4e-36

H:1e-36

I:1e-35

J:9e-36

The calculated value is approximately 1.5e-36, which is not exactly any of the options. The closest is E:2e-36, which is a bit higher than our result. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the given length is 35 m, but the actual uncertainty in position is the radius if it's a circular court? Wait, the question says "fence enclosure of length 35 m surrounding the court". Hmm, perhaps the court is rectangular or circular. If it's a circular fence, the length would be the circumference. So perhaps the radius R is 35/(2π), and then the uncertainty in position Δx is roughly 2R, which would be 35/π ≈ 11.14 m. Oh, that would change the calculation.

Wait, the problem says the enclosure is of length 35 m. If it's a circular enclosure, the circumference is 35 m, so radius R=35/(2π). Then Δx would be the diameter, 2R=35/π ≈11.14 m. But if the court is rectangular, then the length is 35 m in one dimension, so Δx is 35 m. Hmm, but the question isn't clear on the shape. It just says "fence enclosure of length 35 m". So perhaps the court is a rectangle, and the length is 35 m, making the uncertainty in position 35 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the fence forms a square, so each side is 35 m. But that seems unlikely since fences around tennis courts are typically rectangular, longer in length than width. But without knowing the shape, it's hard to say. So I think the problem expects us to treat the uncertainty as 35 m.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the possible answers. If the correct calculation gives approximately 1.5e-36, but the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate without approximating as much. Let me compute 6.62607015e-34 divided by (4 * π *35).

Compute denominator: 4 * π *35 = 4 * 3.1415926535 *35.

4 *3.1415926535 =12.566370614. 12.566370614 *35= let's compute:

35 *12 =420.

35 *0.566370614= 35 *0.5=17.5; 35 *0.066370614=2.322958.

So total 17.5 +2.322958=19.822958.

So 420 +19.822958=439.822958.

So denominator is 439.822958 meters.

So Δp = 6.62607015e-34 /439.822958.

Compute 6.62607015 /439.822958.

Let me do this division more accurately.

439.822958 × 0.015 =6.59734537.

Subtract from 6.62607015: 6.62607015-6.59734537=0.02872478.

Now, 0.02872478 divided by 439.822958 equals approximately 0.02872478 /439.822958.

Let me compute 439.822958 × 0.000065 = let's see, 439.822958 *6.5e-5 = approx 0.02858 m.

So 0.000065 gives 0.02858, which is close to 0.02872478.

The difference is 0.02872478 -0.02858=0.00014478.

So how much more is needed? 0.00014478 /439.822958 ≈ 3.29e-7.

So total multiplier is 0.015 +0.000065 +0.000000329≈ 0.015065329.

So 0.015065329 of 1e-34 is 1.5065329e-36 kg·m/s.

So approximately 1.5065e-36.

The options are E:2e-36, H:1e-36.

Hmm. So it's about 1.5e-36. So perhaps the intended answer is E:2e-36, as the closest option. Or maybe I made a mistake, and the correct approach uses a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps using h/(2πΔx) instead of h/(4πΔx). Let me see what happens in that case.

If I use Δp = h/(2πΔx), then the calculation is 6.626e-34/(2 * π *35).

So denominator is 2 * π *35 = 219.9115.

So 6.626e-34 /219.9115 ≈ let's compute 6.626 /219.9115 ≈0.03013.

So 0.03013e-34 = 3.013e-36 kg·m/s. That's about 3e-36, which is option A.

Wait, but that's different. So perhaps the question uses the form of the uncertainty principle where Δp ≈ h/(2πΔx), but I thought the correct form is h/(4π). So this is confusing.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is often written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π). So in that case, the minimum uncertainty product is ħ/2, so Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, let me clarify: the uncertainty principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ / 2. So rearranging, Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx).

But ħ is h/(2π), so substituting, Δp ≥ (h/(2π)) / (2Δx) ) = h/(4π Δx).

Ah, so that brings me back to the initial formula. So Δp = h/(4π Δx).

So earlier calculation of ~1.5e-36 is correct.

But none of the options exactly match that. Hmm.

So the options are A:3e-36, E:2e-36, H:1e-36.

Wait, perhaps the given length is 35 m, but the problem says it's an enclosure, so perhaps the ball is confined in three dimensions. But the problem asks about the momentum uncertainty, which in one dimension. So I think the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different value for h. Let me check: Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s exactly. So that's correct.

So perhaps the intended answer is E:2e-36, but my calculation is 1.5e-36, which is closer to 1.5e-36. So why is that not an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption about Δx.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the tennis ball's position uncertainty as the radius of the enclosure. So if the enclosure is a circle with circumference 35 m, then the radius R=35/(2π). Then the diameter is 35/π, which is about 11.14 m. So Δx would be 11.14 m.

Then Δp = h/(4π *11.14).

Let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34.

4π ≈12.566.

12.566 *11.14 = let's calculate:

12 *11.14=133.68, 0.566 *11.14≈6.309.

Total: 133.68 +6.309≈139.989.

So denominator is ~140.

So Δp=6.626e-34 /140 ≈4.745e-36 kg·m/s. So about 4.75e-36.

Looking at the options, G is 4e-36, which is close. So perhaps the intended approach is considering the enclosure as a circular fence, so the position uncertainty is the diameter (2R), which comes out to about 4.7e-36, so option G:4e-36.

But the question states that the fence has a length of 35 m. If it's a circular fence, the length would be the circumference, which is 2πR. So R=35/(2π), so 2R is 35/π ≈11.14 m, which is the diameter. So Δx would be about 11.14 m.

So with Δx=11.14 m, the calculation gives Δp≈4.75e-36, which is close to option G:4e-36.

So perhaps the intended answer is G:4e-36.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the shape of the enclosure. It just says "fence enclosure of length 35 m". So if it's a rectangular enclosure, the length could be 35 m, implying the uncertainty is 35 m. But if it's circular, the length is the circumference, so the uncertainty in position is the diameter, 35/π m.

This is a bit ambiguous. So how would I decide which approach to take?

In typical physics problems, when an enclosure is mentioned without specifying the shape, it's often treated as a one-dimensional box, so the length is the uncertainty in position. So perhaps the initial approach with Δx=35 m is correct, giving Δp≈1.5e-36, but there's no exact option for that.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the shape to be considered, perhaps the answer intended is option G:4e-36, assuming a circular enclosure.

But since the options don't include 1.5e-36, perhaps the intended approach is the circular enclosure, so the answer would be G:4e-36.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses h/(2πΔ
