Question:

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?

Options:

A: Nitroprusside
B: Verapamil
C: Alteplase
D: Furosemide
E: Phentolamine
F: Atorvastatin
G: Carvedilol
H: Metoprolol
I: Lisinopril
J: Warfarin

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the scenario again.

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath that started an hour ago after snorting cocaine for the first time. His chest pain is a 7/10, radiating down his left arm. His medical history is clean, no meds, no other illicit drugs. He's 178 cm, 70 kg, BMI 22. He's diaphoretic. Vitals: temp 37.5°C, pulse 110/min, respirations 16, BP 200/100. Saturation 95% on room air. Lungs clear, heart sounds normal, no edema, etc. He's oriented. They've given him oxygen, aspirin, IV nitroglycerin, and lorazepam. But he's still having symptoms. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST or T-wave changes. The question is about the next appropriate pharmacotherapy.

Hmm. So, what's going on here? Well, the patient used cocaine, which is a stimulant, right? It causes increased sympathetic activity—so that would lead to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and maybe vasoconstriction.

His BP is really high—200/100, which is quite elevated. His heart rate is 110, which is tachycardic. The chest pain radiates to the left arm, which makes me think of cardiac issues like myocardial infarction or ischemia. But the ECG shows no ST or T-wave changes, so maybe it's not a typical STEMI or NSTEMI? Or maybe it's early or something else.

Wait, but he's young and otherwise healthy. Cocaine use can cause myocardial infarction even in young people because it's a potent vasoconstrictor and can cause coronary artery spasm. So, the chest pain could be from that.

He's already been given aspirin (antiplatelet), nitroglycerin (vasodilator), and lorazepam (probably for anxiety or to reduce sympathetic drive). But his symptoms aren't improving. So, what's next?

Looking at the options:

A: Nitroprusside. That's a potent vasodilator, used in hypertensive crises. It affects both arteries and veins. But it can cause reflex tachycardia. Also, in cocaine-induced hypertension, I've heard that some agents are preferred over others.

B: Verapamil. That's a calcium channel blocker, which can help with coronary spasm, but verapamil is more of a cardioselective one. However, in the setting of acute coronary syndrome, especially with possible MI, I'm not sure if verapamil is the first choice.

C: Alteplase. That's a thrombolytic. Since the ECG doesn't show ST elevation, unless he has an NSTEMI, which might not require thrombolysis. Also, with cocaine, the issue might be spasm rather than a thrombus.

D: Furosemide. That's a diuretic, used for heart failure. But his lungs are clear, so no pulmonary edema. Maybe if it's cardiogenic shock, but he's hypertensive, so probably not.

E: Phentolamine. Wait, phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. It can reverse the effects of excessive catecholamines, which is exactly what cocaine causes. So in cases of cocaine-induced hypertension or coronary spasm, phentolamine might be useful.

F: Atorvastatin. A statin, which is for cholesterol. Not acute treatment here.

G: Carvedilol. A beta-blocker with some alpha-blocking activity. Beta-blockers can be risky in cocaine toxicity because cocaine causes increased sympathetic activity. Beta-blockers might cause unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation, leading to worse hypertension or coronary spasm.

H: Metoprolol. Another beta-blocker. Similar reasoning as carvedilol. So probably not the best choice here.

I: Lisinopril. An ACE inhibitor, which is used for hypertension and heart failure. But in the acute setting of a hypertensive emergency with possible coronary spasm, maybe not the first choice.

J: Warfarin. An anticoagulant, but not indicated here unless there's an acute thromboembolic event, which isn't clear.

So, putting this together. The patient has cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome, possibly with ongoing spasm or severe hypertension. He's already on nitroglycerin, which is a vasodilator, but his BP remains high, and symptoms persist.

Beta-blockers (options G and H) might be contraindicated because they can worsen the hypertension from cocaine. Because cocaine blocks norepinephrine reuptake, leading to increased sympathetic activity. Beta-blockers can leave the alpha-adrenergic effects unopposed, causing more vasoconstriction.

Phentolamine (option E) is an alpha-blocker, which would counteract the alpha effects, reducing the hypertension and possibly relieving coronary spasm. So that might be the best next step.

Alternatively, nitroprusside (A) is a strong vasodilator, but it's a nitric oxide donor with both venous and arterial effects. It's used in hypertensive emergencies. However, in the case of cocaine, using phentolamine might be more targeted.

So the answer is E: Phentolamine.
</think>

The patient is a 25-year-old man presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine, which is a potent stimulant that increases sympathetic activity, leading to hypertension and potential coronary artery spasm. His symptoms, elevated blood pressure (200/100 mm Hg), and tachycardia (110/min) suggest cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome or hypertensive emergency. Despite treatment with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam, his symptoms persist, and the ECG shows no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, making typical myocardial infarction less likely.

Given the mechanism of cocaine toxicity, which involves increased sympathetic activity and alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction, the most appropriate next step is to counteract these effects. Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol or carvedilol) are contraindicated in this setting because they can worsen hypertension by causing unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, is specifically indicated to reverse the effects of excessive catecholamines caused by cocaine, making it the most appropriate choice. Other options like nitroprusside, while effective in hypertensive crises, are less targeted for cocaine-induced hypertension compared to phentolamine.
