Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the statistics stuff yet. But I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question is about a random sample from a normal distribution. The setup is that we have X₁, X₂, ..., X₁₆, which are a random sample from N(77, 25). And we need to compute P(74.2 < X̄ < 78.4). The options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that when dealing with the sampling distribution of the sample mean, X̄, it follows a normal distribution. The mean of X̄ should be the same as the population mean, which is 77 here. And the variance of X̄ would be the population variance divided by the sample size. Oh right, the formula is (σ² / n).

So the population variance is 25, and the sample size is 16. Let me calculate the standard error (which is the standard deviation of X̄). That would be sqrt(25/16). Wait, sqrt(25) is 5, so 5 divided by 4 (since sqrt(16) is 4). So the standard error is 5/4, which is 1.25.

Now, since X̄ is normally distributed with mean 77 and standard deviation 1.25, I can standardize the values 74.2 and 78.4 to find the probabilities.

To standardize, I subtract the mean and divide by the standard error. So for 74.2:

Z₁ = (74.2 - 77) / 1.25. Let me compute that. 74.2 -77 is -2.8. Divided by 1.25: -2.8 / 1.25. Hmm, 2.8 divided by 1.25. Well, 1.25 times 2 is 2.5, so 2.8 is 2.5 + 0.3. So 2.8 /1.25 is 2.24. But since it's negative, Z₁ is -2.24.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again. 1.25 times 2 is 2.5. So 2.8 is 0.3 more than 2.5. 0.3 divided by 1.25 is 0.24. So yes, 2.24. So Z₁ is -2.24.

Now for 78.4: Z₂ = (78.4 -77)/1.25. 78.4-77 is 1.4. 1.4 /1.25 is 1.12. So Z₂ is 1.12.

So now I need to find P(-2.24 < Z < 1.12), where Z is the standard normal variable.

I think I should use the standard normal distribution table for this. Let me remember how to read it. The table gives the cumulative probability up to a certain Z value.

So P(Z < 1.12) is the area from negative infinity to 1.12. Similarly, P(Z < -2.24) is the area up to -2.24. The probability between them is P(Z <1.12) - P(Z < -2.24).

I need to look up these Z values. Let me see:

For Z=1.12, looking at the standard table, I think the closest is 1.12. Let me see: The table might have 1.10 and 1.12. For 1.10, the value is about 0.8643. For 1.12, the value is around 0.8686? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise method.

Wait, maybe I should use a calculator or a Z-table. Since I don't have one, I'll try to approximate.

Z=1.12: The area up to 1.0 is 0.8413, and for 1.1, it's about 0.8655. Wait, no, 1.1 is 0.8655, and 1.12 is a bit higher. Each 0.01 adds approximately 0.0080? So 1.10 is 0.8655, 1.11 is 0.8669, 1.12 is 0.8686. Hmm, maybe I should accept that as 0.8686.

For Z=-2.24: That's on the negative side. The area to the left of -2.24. Since the standard normal is symmetric, P(Z < -2.24) is the same as P(Z > 2.24), which is 1 - P(Z < 2.24). What's P(Z <2.24)? Let's see, 2.24 is between 2.2 and 2.3. The values for 2.2 is 0.9772, and for 2.3 it's 0.9893. Let me compute for 2.24: perhaps 0.9772 + (0.24)*(0.9893-0.9772)/(0.1). Since each 0.1 Z increases by about 0.01 in the probability.

Wait, 2.2 is 0.9772, 2.3 is 0.9893. The difference is 0.0121 per 0.1 Z. So for 0.04 increase (from 2.2 to 2.24), the increase would be 0.04/0.1 * 0.0121 = 0.00484. So 0.9772 + 0.00484 = 0.98204.

So P(Z <2.24) ≈0.9820, so P(Z < -2.24) is 1 - 0.9820 = 0.0180. Wait, wait, no: wait, if Z is negative, the area to the left is the same as 1 - area to the right. So P(Z < -2.24) = 1 - P(Z < 2.24) = 1 - 0.9820 = 0.0180.

Wait, no, wait: no, for example, P(Z < -1.96) is 0.025, because 1.96 is the 97.5 percentile. So for Z=-2.24, which is further out, the probability should be less than 0.025, say 0.0129 or something. Maybe I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should look up exact values. Since I can't, I'll try to approach it differently. Let me think: the standard normal distribution beyond Z=2 is about 2.28% (for Z=2), and beyond Z=2.33 it's about 1%. Wait, no, let me remember that Z=1.96 is 0.025, Z=2.0 is about 0.0228, Z=2.33 is about 0.0099, and Z=2.5 is about 0.0062. So Z=2.24 is somewhere between 2.0 and 2.33, so the area beyond 2.24 would be between 0.0228 and 0.0099. Let's see, for a more precise estimate.

Each 0.1 increase in Z from 2.0 to 2.3 reduces the tail probability by about 0.013 per 0.1 Z. So from 2.0 (0.0228) to 2.1 (0.0179), that's a decrease of 0.0049 per 0.1. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to interpolate.

Wait, maybe I can use the symmetry. Let me think again. For Z=2.24, the exact value isn't coming to me, but perhaps I can use a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the empirical rule or remember that common Z values correspond to certain probabilities. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Well, maybe I can proceed with the approximate values.

So for Z=1.12, I'll take P(Z <1.12) as approximately 0.8686. For Z=-2.24, let's say P(Z < -2.24) is approximately 0.0129. So the probability between them is 0.8686 - 0.0129 = 0.8557.

But looking at the options, E is 0.8561, which is very close to my approximate 0.8557. So I think that's the answer. Hmm.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the Z calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed Z₁ as (74.2 -77)/1.25, that's -2.8 /1.25 = -2.24. Correct.

Z₂ = (78.4 -77)/1.25 = 1.4/1.25=1.12. Correct.

So the range is from -2.24 to 1.12 in standard Z.

Now, perhaps a better way to get more accurate values for the Z probabilities.

For Z=1.12:

Looking at a standard Z table, for 1.10, the value is 0.8655, and for 1.12, it's 0.8686. So I think that's correct.

For Z=-2.24, the area to the left is the same as 1 - area to the left of 2.24. So if 2.24 corresponds to 0.9824, then 1 - 0.9824 = 0.0176.

Wait, that's slightly different than my previous 0.0180. Hmm, that would make the probability between them 0.8686 - 0.0176 = 0.8510.

But that's not matching any option exactly. Wait, the options are A:0.6398, B:0.9544, C:0.4772, D:0.7234, E:0.8561, F:0.9750, G:0.6826, H:0.9042, I:0.8128, J:0.8925.

So 0.851 is not an option, but E is 0.8561, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should get more precise Z values.

Wait, maybe using a calculator for more precise Z values would help. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the standard error calculation.

Wait, the standard error is sqrt(25/16) = 5/4 = 1.25. That's correct.

Another approach: perhaps using the formula for the standard normal distribution. The probability P(a < Z < b) is Φ(b) - Φ(a), where Φ is the cumulative distribution function.

Φ(1.12) is approximately 0.8686, Φ(-2.24) is approximately 0.0129, so 0.8686 - 0.0129 = 0.8557, which is very close to option E, 0.8561.

So I think the answer is E.

But wait, perhaps I should check more accurately. Let me think about using linear interpolation for the Z=2.24.

Looking at standard normal table:

At Z=2.2, the value is 0.97725.

At Z=2.3, it's 0.98931.

So the difference between Z=2.2 and Z=2.3 is 0.01206 per 0.1 Z.

So for Z=2.24, which is 0.04 above 2.2, the cumulative probability would be 0.97725 + (0.04/0.1)*0.01206.

Wait, no. Because the Z table gives the area to the left. So each increase in Z increases the area. So for 2.2, it's 0.97725. For 2.21, it would be 0.97725 + some value. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the exact values from the table.

But without the table, it's tough. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator. Well, since this is a thought process, I can proceed.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 68-95-99.7 rule, but that's for Z within 1,2,3 sigma. But our Z here goes beyond that, so maybe not.

Wait, but let me think. The sample size is 16, which is moderate, so the Central Limit Theorem applies, and the sampling distribution is approximately normal, but since the original is normal, it's exactly normal.

So back to the problem. I think my initial approach was correct, and the answer should be E, 0.8561.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) follows a normal distribution with mean \( \mu_{\bar{X}} = 77 \) and standard error \( \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{16}} = 1.25 \). We need to compute \( P(74.2 < \bar{X} < 78.4) \).

First, we standardize the bounds of the interval using the formula \( Z = \frac{X - \mu_{\bar{X}}}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}} \):

1. For \( X = 74.2 \):
   \[
   Z_1 = \frac{74.2 - 77}{1.25} = \frac{-2.8}{1.25} = -2.24
   \]

2. For \( X = 78.4 \):
   \[
   Z_2 = \frac{78.4 - 77}{1.25} = \frac{1.4}{1.25} = 1.12
   \]

Thus, the problem reduces to finding \( P(-2.24 < Z < 1.12) \), where \( Z \) is a standard normal variable. Using the standard normal distribution table:

- \( P(Z < 1.12) \approx 0.8686 \)
- \( P(Z < -2.24) \approx 0.0129 \)

The probability between the two bounds is:
\[
P(-2.24 < Z < 1.12) = P(Z < 1.12) - P(Z < -2.24) = 0.8686 - 0.0129 = 0.8557
\]

This value is very close to option **E: 0.8561**, which is the correct answer.
