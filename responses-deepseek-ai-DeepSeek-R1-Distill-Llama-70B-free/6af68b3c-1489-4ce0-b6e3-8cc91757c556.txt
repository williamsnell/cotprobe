Question:

A screenwriter had just finished a screenplay for a romantic comedy. After reading the screenplay, a movie studio decided to option the screenplay for production. A lawyer for the movie studio negotiated an agreement with the screenwriter whereby the movie studio would pay the screenwriter $5,000 for the rights to the screenplay, and 10 percent of the gross receipts earned by the distribution of the movie, should the studio decide to film the screenplay. Both sides signed the agreement. Two weeks later, the screenwriter was at a birthday party for a close friend when she discovered she had forgotten to purchase a gift for her friend. She quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it:"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay. "The screenwriter then signed the paper, placed it in an envelope, and handed it to the friend. The promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend may best be interpreted as a (an)

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with assignments and promises. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is about a screenwriter who sold her screenplay to a movie studio. They agreed that she'd get $5,000 plus 10% of the gross receipts. Then, at a party, she forgot a gift and wrote a note promising her friend 5% of her proceeds from the movie. She signed it and gave it to her friend. The question is about the legal nature of this promise.

Hmm, I remember that when someone assigns a portion of their future rights, it can be either an assignment or a promise to assign. Assignments can be either legal or equitable. A legal assignment usually requires the present transfer of a present interest, and it needs to be in writing, especially under the Statute of Frauds. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, in this case, the screenwriter hasn't received any money yet; the movie hasn't been made. So she's promising a portion of her future proceeds. So is this an assignment of future rights or a promise to assign them in the future?

I think there are two types: a present assignment of future rights, which is called a "grant," or a promise to assign, which is a contractual obligation. But wait, if she's transferring a portion of her rights now, even though the rights haven't been received yet, that might be an assignment.

But I'm a bit confused. Assignments of future property can be valid if they're in writing and sufficiently definite. So when she wrote that note, she was assigning 5% of her future proceeds. That sounds like a present assignment of future rights.

Wait, but what's the difference between an assignment and a contractual promise? If she just promises to pay 5%, without assigning her rights, it's a contractual obligation. But if she's assigning a portion of her rights, then the friend can claim directly from the studio, perhaps.

In the scenario, she wrote, "I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent..." That sounds more like creating a right for the friend, which might be an assignment. But does it need consideration?

Wait, consideration is required for a contract. Here, the friend didn't provide anything in exchange. So if this is a contract, it's not supported by consideration, making it a non-binding agreement. But if it's an assignment, maybe it's a gift, which doesn't require consideration.

So is this a gift? She's giving her friend 5% of her proceeds. She signed it and delivered it. That could be a gift. But for a gift, there needs to be donative intent, delivery, and acceptance. Here, she intended it as a gift, handed it over, so maybe it's a legal gift.

But wait, a gift of a future interest might be more complex. I think that under the law, a promise to give a portion of future income can be considered a contractual obligation if there's consideration, or a gift if it's gratuitous. But without consideration, it's not a contract, so it must be a gift.

Alternatively, maybe it's an assignment. If it's an assignment, it could be either legal or equitable. A legal assignment requires the transfer of a present interest, but here the interest is future. So maybe it's an equitable assignment.

Wait, but some jurisdictions allow for the assignment of future rights. So by signing the note, she might have made a present assignment of 5% of her future proceeds. That would be an assignment of future rights, which is valid if in writing.

So looking at the options:

A: conditional assignment. Not sure about the conditions here.

B: non-binding agreement. If there's no consideration, maybe, but if it's a gift, it's binding.

C: legal gift. That's possible, but I'm not sure if this counts as a legal gift since it's a future interest.

D: contractual obligation. Without consideration, it's not a contract.

E: gratuitous assignment of future rights. This sounds plausible. A gratuitous assignment would mean it's a gift, transferring the rights without payment.

F: binding promise. Again, without consideration, a promise isn't binding unless it's a gift.

G: revocable gift. Once a gift is made, it's not revocable, I think.

H: equitable lien. That's more about remedies when someone has been unjustly enriched.

I: informal contract. No consideration, so it's not a contract.

J: irrevocable assignment. Once assigned, can she revoke it?

Wait, the screenwriter gave this assignment in exchange for nothing, so it's a gift. So it's a gratuitous assignment of future rights. That would make option E the correct answer.

Alternatively, if it's a promise to pay, without assigning the right, it's a contractual obligation, but without consideration, it's not enforceable. So it's better to see it as an assignment.

So E is the answer.

The scenario involves a screenwriter who promised her friend 5% of her future proceeds from a movie based on her screenplay. The key issue is determining the legal nature of this promise. 

The screenwriter had not yet received any proceeds, so the promise pertains to future rights. This could be interpreted as either a contractual obligation or an assignment of future rights. However, for a contractual obligation, consideration is generally required, which is absent here. Therefore, the promise is more likely a gift rather than a contract.

A gift requires donative intent, delivery, and acceptance. The screenwriter demonstrated donative intent by writing and signing the note, delivered it to her friend, and the friend presumably accepted it. Since the promise involves a portion of future proceeds, it constitutes a gratuitous assignment of future rights. This type of assignment does not require consideration and is valid if made in writing.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Conditional assignment** — There are no conditions mentioned in the promise.
- **B: Non-binding agreement** — Without consideration, it is not a binding contract, but it could still be a gift.
- **C: Legal gift** — While it resembles a gift, the transfer of future rights makes it more specific than a general legal gift.
- **D: Contractual obligation** — No consideration is present, so it is not a contractual obligation.
- **E: Gratuitous assignment of future rights** — This fits because the screenwriter transferred a portion of her future proceeds without receiving anything in return.
- **F: Binding promise** — A promise without consideration is not binding unless it is a gift.
- **G: Revocable gift** — Once a gift is made, it is generally not revocable.
- **H: Equitable lien** — This pertains to remedies for unjust enrichment, which is not relevant here.
- **I: Informal contract** — Again, no consideration is present, so it is not a contract.
- **J: Irrevocable assignment** — While assignments are typically irrevocable, the specific term "gratuitous assignment of future rights" better describes the situation.

The most accurate interpretation is that the promise constitutes a **gratuitous assignment of future rights**, as the screenwriter transferred a portion of her future proceeds to her friend without receiving anything in return.
