Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Alright, the question says that a horizontal force of 5 N is required to maintain a velocity of 2 m/s for a box of mass 10 kg sliding over a rough surface. Then, we're asked how much work is done by the force in 1 minute. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that work done is calculated by the formula W = F * d, where F is force and d is distance. But wait, I also need to consider the time factor here because the time given is 1 minute. Oh right, because the box is moving at a constant velocity, so the force must be equal to the frictional force. But wait, the question is about work done by the applied force, not the friction.

Wait, so the applied force is 5 N, right? And the velocity is 2 m/s. So first, I think I should calculate the distance the box travels in one minute. Because once I have the distance, I can multiply it by the force to get the work done.

But wait, time. One minute is 60 seconds. So the velocity is 2 m/s. So distance d = velocity * time. So d = 2 m/s * 60 s. Let me calculate that. 2 times 60 is 120 meters. So the box moves 120 meters in a minute.

Now, the force applied is 5 N. So the work done by this force is F*d. So 5 N multiplied by 120 meters. 5 * 120 is 600. So that would be 600 Joules.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The box is moving at constant velocity, so the net force is zero. That means the applied force is equal in magnitude to the frictional force. But when calculating work done by the applied force, friction is doing negative work. But the question is only about the work done by the force (the applied one), so I don't subtract anything. So the calculation remains 5 N * 120 m = 600 J.

Looking at the options: Option C is 600 J. So I think the answer is C. But let me double-check the calculations.

Another way: Power is force times velocity. So P = F * v. So 5 N * 2 m/s = 10 Watts. Power is work done per unit time. So in one second, 10 J. So in 60 seconds, 10 * 60 = 600 J. Yep, same result.

So I'm confident the answer is C: 600 J.

To determine the work done by the force in 1 minute, we use the formula for work: 

\[
W = F \cdot d
\]

where \( F \) is the force and \( d \) is the distance traveled. The force applied is given as \( F = 5 \, \text{N} \), and the velocity of the box is \( v = 2 \, \text{m/s} \). The time is \( t = 1 \, \text{minute} = 60 \, \text{seconds} \).

First, calculate the distance traveled using the formula:

\[
d = v \cdot t
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
d = 2 \, \text{m/s} \cdot 60 \, \text{s} = 120 \, \text{m}
\]

Now, calculate the work done:

\[
W = F \cdot d = 5 \, \text{N} \cdot 120 \, \text{m} = 600 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the work done by the force in 1 minute is \( 600 \, \text{J} \). This matches option C.
