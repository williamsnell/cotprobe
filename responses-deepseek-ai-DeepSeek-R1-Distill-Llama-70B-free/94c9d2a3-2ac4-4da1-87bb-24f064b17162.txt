Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see what it's about. The scenario is an investor suing a corporation for stock fraud. The investor is presenting their case and wants to introduce a newspaper issue to show the stock price on a particular day. The corporation's attorney objects, and the question is about how the court should rule on this evidence.

Hmm, so the main issue here is whether the newspaper can be admitted into evidence. I remember that newspapers are generally considered hearsay, which would mean they're excluded unless there's an exception.

Wait, what's hearsay again? Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So if the newspaper is being offered to show the stock price, then the statement in the newspaper about the stock price is hearsay because it's a statement made by the newspaper (or someone else) out of court.

But are there exceptions to hearsay that apply here? I recall several exceptions, like business records, public records, market reports, etc. Let me think about each.

Business Records Exception: That's Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6). It applies to records of regularly conducted activity made at or near the time by someone with knowledge, as long as the source of information and method of preparation are trustworthy. So, would the newspaper qualify as a business record? Hmm, the newspaper's stock price report is probably from a reliable source, maybe a stock exchange. But wait, the business records exception usually applies to records made by the entity itself. The newspaper is a third party compiling information, so maybe it's not their business record. Unless the stock exchange's records are incorporated into the newspaper, but I'm not sure.

Public Records Exception: Rule 803(8) covers records of public entities. Stock prices aren't typically public records, they're more of a market thing. So public records might not apply here.

Market Reports: Oh right, there's a specific exception for market reports. Rule 803(10) says that market quotations, lists, directories, or other compilations are admissible if they're generally relied upon by the public or by persons in the business. Stock prices in a newspaper would likely fall under this. So the newspaper's stock price listing would be admissible under the market reports exception.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes newspapers are considered under the hearsay exceptions. Alternatively, the stock price could be in a business record if it's from an exchange, but presented via the newspaper. But the newspaper itself is a third-party publication.

Alternatively, maybe the best evidence rule applies here. The best evidence rule says that to prove the content of a writing, the original is preferred. But in this case, the investor is using the newspaper as evidence of the stock price. If the newspaper is a reliable source, maybe it's acceptable. But the best evidence rule wouldn't exclude it if there's an exception, like the one for market reports.

So putting it together: the newspaper is hearsay, but it's admissible under the market reports exception. So the correct answer would be J: admitted under the market reports exception.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option J says admitted under the market reports exception. Option B is under the business records exception. I think I was right earlier that it's the market reports exception, not business records, because the newspaper isn't the one creating the stock price data; it's reporting from another source (like a stock exchange), which is a market report.

So the correct answer should be J.

The question revolves around whether a newspaper can be admitted as evidence to show a corporation's stock price on a specific day. The key issue is that the newspaper's statement about the stock price is hearsay, which is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Hearsay exceptions were considered:

1. **Business Records Exception (803(6))**: This applies to records made by an entity as part of its regular activity. However, the newspaper is a third-party publication compiling information from another source (e.g., a stock exchange), so it does not qualify as a business record.

2. **Public Records Exception (803(8))**: This applies to records of public entities. Stock prices are not public records, so this exception does not apply.

3. **Market Reports Exception (803(10))**: This exception covers market quotations, lists, or compilations that are generally relied upon by the public or professionals. Stock prices in a newspaper fall under this category, as they are a reliable and widely used source for such information.

The newspaper is hearsay but admissible under the market reports exception. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: admitted, under the market reports exception.
