Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Gary and his cows and horses. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So, the problem says Gary has 72 cows on his farm. And he has 6 times as many cows as he has horses. Hmm, I need to find out how many horses he has. The equation given is 72 divided by h equals 6, right? So, 72 ÷ h = 6. And I'm supposed to find h, the number of horses.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the relationship between cows and horses. It says he has 6 times as many cows as horses. So, cows = 6 * horses. Oh, right, because if he has, say, 2 horses, then he has 12 cows, which is 6 times more. So, the number of cows is six times the number of horses.

So, if I let h be the number of horses, then the number of cows would be 6h. But wait, the problem says he has 72 cows. So, 6h equals 72? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says he has 6 times as many cows as horses, so cows = 6 * horses. So, 72 = 6h. That makes sense.

But the equation given in the problem is 72 ÷ h = 6. Oh, right, because if I rearrange cows = 6h, then h = cows /6, which is 72/6. So, 72 ÷ h = 6 would imply that h is 72 divided by 6, which is 12. Wait, that doesn't match with the equation I just thought of. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, if cows = 6 * horses, then 72 = 6h. Solving for h, I divide both sides by 6, so h = 72/6, which is 12. So, h is 12. That would mean Gary has 12 horses. Let me check the options. Option I is 12 horses, so that's probably the answer.

But wait, the equation given in the problem is 72 ÷ h = 6. Let me plug in h=12. 72 ÷12 is 6, which matches the equation. So yes, h=12. That makes sense.

I think I got it right. So the answer should be I:12 horses.

The problem states that Gary has 72 cows and 6 times as many cows as horses. To find the number of horses (h), we use the equation provided: 72 ÷ h = 6. Solving for h, we divide 72 by 6, resulting in h = 12. Therefore, Gary has 12 horses.

I: 12 horses.

Answer: I
