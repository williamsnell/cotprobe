Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the partial-fraction expansion of F(s) = (s + 2) / [(s + 1)^2 (s + 3)]. Hmm, partial fractions, right? I remember that when you have repeated linear factors, like (s + 1)^2 here, you need to account for each power. 

So, the denominator factors are (s + 1) squared and (s + 3). The general form for partial fractions in this case should be something like A/(s+1) + B/(s+1)^2 + C/(s+3). Yeah, that makes sense because each distinct linear factor gets a term, and each repeated factor up to its multiplicity.

So, F(s) = [A/(s+1)] + [B/(s+1)^2] + [C/(s+3)]. Now, I need to find the constants A, B, and C. To do that, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator to clear the fractions. 

Multiplying both sides by (s + 1)^2 (s + 3) gives:
s + 2 = A(s + 1)(s + 3) + B(s + 3) + C(s + 1)^2.

Now, I need to expand this and then equate coefficients for each power of s.

Let me expand each term on the right side. 

First term: A(s + 1)(s + 3) = A[s^2 + 4s +3].
Second term: B(s +3) = Bs + 3B.
Third term: C(s +1)^2 = C(s^2 + 2s +1) = Cs^2 + 2Cs + C.

Putting it all together:
s + 2 = A(s² +4s +3) + B s + 3B + C s² + 2C s + C.

Now, combine like terms. Let's collect the s², s, and constant terms.

s² terms: A + C
s terms: 4A + B + 2C
constant terms: 3A + 3B + C.

So, the equation becomes:
s + 2 = (A + C)s² + (4A + B + 2C)s + (3A + 3B + C).

Now, the left side is 0s² + 1s + 2. So, we can set up equations by equating coefficients.

For s²: A + C = 0. (Equation 1)
For s: 4A + B + 2C = 1. (Equation 2)
For constants: 3A + 3B + C = 2. (Equation 3)

Now, I need to solve this system of equations.

From Equation 1: A = -C.

Let me substitute A = -C into Equations 2 and 3.

Equation 2 becomes:
4*(-C) + B + 2C = 1
-4C + B + 2C = 1
(-2C) + B = 1
So, B = 1 + 2C. (Equation 2a)

Equation 3 becomes:
3*(-C) + 3B + C = 2
-3C + 3B + C = 2
(-2C) + 3B = 2.

Substituting B from Equation 2a into Equation 3:
-2C + 3*(1 + 2C) = 2
Expand:
-2C +3 +6C = 2
Combine terms:
4C +3 =2
4C = -1
C = -1/4.

Now, from Equation 1: A = -C = 1/4.

From Equation 2a: B = 1 + 2*(-1/4) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

So, A = 1/4, B=1/2, C= -1/4.

Wait, let me double-check that substitution. So, in equation 3 after substituting:

-3C +3B + C =2 → (-2C) +3B=2. Then, substituting B=1 + 2C:

-2C +3*(1 +2C) =2 → -2C +3 +6C =2 → 4C +3=2 →4C= -1 → C= -1/4. Yep, that's correct.

So, now we have A=1/4, B=1/2, and C=-1/4.

So, plugging back into the partial fractions:

F(s) = (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (-1/4)/(s+3).

Wait, let's write that as F(s)= [1/(4(s+1))] + [1/(2(s+1)^2)] - [1/(4(s+3))].

Now, I need to look at the options and see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1/5)/(s+1) + (2/5)/(s+1)^2 - (2/5)/(s+3). Not matching our coefficients.

Option B: (1/2)/(s+1) - (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+3). No, our B is positive 1/2.

Option C: (3/4)/(s+1) - (1/8)/(s+1)^2 - (5/8)/(s+3). Not matching.

Option D: (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+1) - (1/4)/(s+3). Wait, this looks similar. Let's see: D has 1/2 for (s+1)^2, 1/4 for (s+1), and -1/4 for (s+3). But our solution is 1/4 for (s+1), 1/2 for (s+1)^2, and -1/4 for (s+3). So option D is (1/2)/(s+1)^2 + (1/4)/(s+1) - (1/4)/(s+3). So our result is (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3). So the order is different but same terms as D. Wait, does the order matter? No, because they are just terms. So the option D would have the same as our solution? Let me check again.

Wait, our solution is A/(s+1) = 1/4, B/(s+1)^2 =1/2, and C/(s+3)= -1/4. So F(s)= (1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3). 

Looking at option G: [(1/2)/(s+1)] + [(1/4)/(s+1)^2] - [(1/4)/(s+3)]. No, 1/2 and 1/4 swapped.

Option D: [(1/2)/(s+1)^2] + [(1/4)/(s+1)] - [(1/4)/(s+3)]. That matches our solution. Because the terms are additive, so the order doesn't matter. So option D is correct.

Wait wait, no. Let me check the options again. I might have misread.

Looking at the options, let me list them:

Option D: F(s) = [(1/2)/(s + 1)^2] + [(1/4)/(s + 1)] - [(1/4)/(s + 3)].

Yes, that's exactly our result: 1/4 (s+1), 1/2 (s+1)^2, and -1/4 (s+3). So the correct option is D.

Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me make sure. So in our solution:

A = 1/4, so the first term is 1/(4(s+1)).

B=1/2 → 1/(2(s+1)^2).

C=-1/4 → -1/(4(s+3)).

So the expansion is:

(1/4)/(s+1) + (1/2)/(s+1)^2 - (1/4)/(s+3).

Which matches option D exactly.

So the correct answer is D.

To find the partial-fraction expansion of \( F(s) = \frac{s + 2}{(s + 1)^2 (s + 3)} \), we assume the general form:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s + 1} + \frac{B}{(s + 1)^2} + \frac{C}{s + 3}.
\]

Multiplying through by the denominator \((s + 1)^2 (s + 3)\) to clear the fractions gives:

\[
s + 2 = A(s + 1)(s + 3) + B(s + 3) + C(s + 1)^2.
\]

Expanding and combining like terms:

\[
s + 2 = A(s^2 + 4s + 3) + B(s + 3) + C(s^2 + 2s + 1).
\]

\[
s + 2 = (A + C)s^2 + (4A + B + 2C)s + (3A + 3B + C).
\]

Equating coefficients for \(s^2\), \(s\), and the constant term:

1. \(A + C = 0\) (from \(s^2\) terms),
2. \(4A + B + 2C = 1\) (from \(s\) terms),
3. \(3A + 3B + C = 2\) (from constant terms).

From Equation 1: \(A = -C\).

Substituting \(A = -C\) into Equations 2 and 3:

- Equation 2 becomes: \(-4C + B + 2C = 1 \implies B = 1 + 2C\),
- Equation 3 becomes: \(-3C + 3B + C = 2 \implies -2C + 3B = 2\).

Substituting \(B = 1 + 2C\) into \(-2C + 3B = 2\):

\[
-2C + 3(1 + 2C) = 2 \implies -2C + 3 + 6C = 2 \implies 4C + 3 = 2 \implies 4C = -1 \implies C = -\frac{1}{4}.
\]

From \(A = -C\): \(A = \frac{1}{4}\).

From \(B = 1 + 2C\): \(B = 1 + 2(-\frac{1}{4}) = \frac{1}{2}\).

Thus, \(A = \frac{1}{4}\), \(B = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(C = -\frac{1}{4}\).

The partial-fraction expansion is:

\[
F(s) = \frac{1/4}{s + 1} + \frac{1/2}{(s + 1)^2} - \frac{1/4}{s + 3}.
\]

Comparing with the options, this matches **Option D**:

\[
F(s) = \frac{1/2}{(s + 1)^2} + \frac{1/4}{s + 1} - \frac{1/4}{s + 3}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D**
