Okay, so I've got this statistics problem about softballs, and I need to find several measures: range, variance, standard deviation, mean deviation about the median, and coefficient of variation. Then I have to pick the correct option from A to J based on these calculations.

Let me start by listing the given data. The radii are 2.03, 1.98, 2.24, 2.17, and 2.08 inches. Hmm, I think I should arrange them in order to make calculations easier. So sorting them: 1.98, 2.03, 2.08, 2.17, 2.24.

First, the range. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. So that's 2.24 - 1.98. Let me calculate that. 2.24 minus 1.98 equals 0.26 inches. So the range is 0.26 in. Looking at the options, A, B, and some others have 0.26, while others have different values, so I can note that.

Next, the mean. To find the mean, I add all the numbers and divide by the count. Let's add them:

1.98 + 2.03 = 4.01
4.01 + 2.08 = 6.09
6.09 + 2.17 = 8.26
8.26 + 2.24 = 10.5

There are 5 data points, so the mean is 10.5 divided by 5, which is 2.1 inches.

Now, variance. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. Since this is a sample, I think I should use sample variance, which divides by (n-1). So, n=5, so denominator is 4.

Calculating each squared difference from the mean (2.1):

1.98: (1.98 - 2.1) = -0.12. Squared is 0.0144.
2.03: (2.03-2.1)= -0.07. Squared is 0.0049.
2.08: (2.08-2.1)= -0.02. Squared is 0.0004.
2.17: (2.17-2.1)= 0.07. Squared is 0.0049.
2.24: (2.24-2.1)= 0.14. Squared is 0.0196.

Now sum these squared differences: 0.0144 + 0.0049 = 0.0193; plus 0.0004 makes 0.0197; plus 0.0049 is 0.0246; plus 0.0196 gives 0.0442.

Variance is 0.0442 divided by 4, which is 0.01105. Wait, but looking at the options, some have variance around 0.0088, 0.0105, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, let me check the squared differences again.

1.98: (1.98 - 2.1) = -0.12 → squared is 0.0144.
2.03: 2.03 - 2.1 = -0.07 → 0.0049.
2.08: 2.08-2.1= -0.02 → 0.0004.
2.17: 2.17-2.1=0.07 → 0.0049.
2.24: 2.24-2.1=0.14 → 0.0196.

Wait, adding those: 0.0144 + 0.0049 = 0.0193, plus 0.0004 → 0.0197, plus 0.0049 → 0.0246, plus 0.0196 → 0.0442. So yes, sum is 0.0442.

Variance is 0.0442 / 4 = 0.01105, which is approximately 0.0111. But looking at the options, none of the options have variance exactly as that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mean calculation.

Wait a second, let me recalculate the mean. The data is 1.98, 2.03, 2.08, 2.17, 2.24. Let me add them again.

1.98 + 2.03 = 4.01.

4.01 + 2.08 = 6.09.

6.09 + 2.17 = 8.26.

8.26 + 2.24 = 10.5. Yes, that's correct. So mean is 10.5 /5 = 2.1.

Hmm. So variance is 0.01105, which I can round to 0.0111. Looking at the options, option B has variance 0.00884, which is lower. Option A has 0.0105, which is close but higher. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the squared differences. Let me double-check each.

1.98: 2.1 - 1.98 is 0.12, so squared is 0.0144. Correct.

2.03: 2.1 - 2.03 is 0.07, squared 0.0049. Correct.

2.08: 2.1 - 2.08 is 0.02, squared 0.0004. Correct.

2.17: 2.17 - 2.1 is 0.07, squared 0.0049. Correct.

2.24: 2.24 - 2.1 is 0.14, squared 0.0196. Correct.

Sum is 0.0144 +0.0049=0.0193; +0.0004=0.0197; +0.0049=0.0246; +0.0196=0.0442. So variance is 0.0442/4=0.01105. So approximately 0.0111.

But none of the options have exactly this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Variance 0.0105.

Option B: 0.00884.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Wait, is this the sample variance or population variance? The question doesn't specify, but since it's five different brands, perhaps it's a sample, so sample variance applies. So yes, n-1=4.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects population variance. Let me try that. Population variance is sum of squares divided by n=5, so 0.0442/5=0.00884. Ah, that's what option B has for variance. So perhaps the question is treating this as a population, not a sample. Because the question says "five different brands" which might imply it's the whole population, not a sample. So variance would be 0.00884.

Wait, but in statistical terms, when given all the data points, it's considered the population. So perhaps I should calculate population variance. So yes, 0.0442 divided by 5 is 0.00884. So that would make variance 0.00884, which matches option B.

So variance is 0.00884, which is option B.

Now, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. So sqrt(0.00884). Let me compute that. Let's see: 0.00884 is 8.84e-3.

Square root of 0.00884: Let's see, 0.094, because 0.094^2 = 0.008836. So approximately 0.094. So standard deviation is approximately 0.094, which is what option B lists.

Next, the mean deviation about the median. Hmm, this is the average of the absolute differences from the median.

First, the median. Since there are five data points, the median is the middle one, which is 2.08.

Now, compute each data point's deviation from the median.

1.98: |1.98 - 2.08| = 0.10.

2.03: |2.03 - 2.08|=0.05.

2.08: |2.08-2.08|=0.

2.17: |2.17-2.08|=0.09.

2.24: |2.24-2.08|=0.16.

Now sum these: 0.10 + 0.05 + 0 + 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.4.

Mean deviation is 0.4 divided by 5, which is 0.08. So that's 0.08, which is what option B lists.

Lastly, the coefficient of variation (CV). CV is (standard deviation / mean) * 100. But in this case, the options probably give it as a decimal, not percentage.

Standard deviation is 0.094, mean is 2.1.

So CV = 0.094 / 2.1 ≈ 0.0448. Rounded to three decimal places, maybe 0.045. Option B says 0.045 for CV.

Putting it all together, the values are:

Range: 0.26 in.

Variance: 0.00884.

Standard deviation: 0.094.

Mean deviation about the median: 0.08.

Coefficient of variation: 0.045.

Which matches option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the required statistical measures for the given data: 2.03, 1.98, 2.24, 2.17, and 2.08.

### Calculations:
1. **Range**:  
   The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values:  
   \[
   \text{Range} = 2.24 - 1.98 = 0.26 \, \text{in}.
   \]

2. **Mean**:  
   The mean is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{1.98 + 2.03 + 2.08 + 2.17 + 2.24}{5} = \frac{10.5}{5} = 2.1 \, \text{in}.
   \]

3. **Variance**:  
   Variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. Since the problem likely treats the data as a population (all brands are included), we use population variance:  
   \[
   \text{Variance} = \frac{(1.98 - 2.1)^2 + (2.03 - 2.1)^2 + (2.08 - 2.1)^2 + (2.17 - 2.1)^2 + (2.24 - 2.1)^2}{5}.
   \]  
   Squared differences:  
   \[
   (1.98 - 2.1)^2 = 0.0144, \, (2.03 - 2.1)^2 = 0.0049, \, (2.08 - 2.1)^2 = 0.0004, \, (2.17 - 2.1)^2 = 0.0049, \, (2.24 - 2.1)^2 = 0.0196.
   \]  
   Sum of squared differences:  
   \[
   0.0144 + 0.0049 + 0.0004 + 0.0049 + 0.0196 = 0.0442.
   \]  
   Variance:  
   \[
   \text{Variance} = \frac{0.0442}{5} = 0.00884.
   \]

4. **Standard Deviation**:  
   The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:  
   \[
   \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{0.00884} \approx 0.094.
   \]

5. **Mean Deviation About the Median**:  
   The median is the middle value of the sorted data:  
   \[
   \text{Median} = 2.08.
   \]  
   Absolute deviations from the median:  
   \[
   |1.98 - 2.08| = 0.10, \, |2.03 - 2.08| = 0.05, \, |2.08 - 2.08| = 0, \, |2.17 - 2.08| = 0.09, \, |2.24 - 2.08| = 0.16.
   \]  
   Sum of absolute deviations:  
   \[
   0.10 + 0.05 + 0 + 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.4.
   \]  
   Mean deviation:  
   \[
   \text{Mean Deviation About the Median} = \frac{0.4}{5} = 0.08.
   \]

6. **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**:  
   The CV is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{CV} = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\text{Mean}} = \frac{0.094}{2.1} \approx 0.045.
   \]

### Final Results:
- **Range**: 0.26 in  
- **Variance**: 0.00884  
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.094  
- **Mean Deviation About the Median**: 0.08  
- **Coefficient of Variation**: 0.045  

These values match **Option B**.
