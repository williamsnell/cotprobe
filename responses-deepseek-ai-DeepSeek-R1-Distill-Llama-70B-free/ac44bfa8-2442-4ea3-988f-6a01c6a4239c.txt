Okay, so I've got this question about currency exchange between the US dollar and the euro. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through each one step by step.

The question is about what's true regarding the exchange of US dollars and euros. The options are A to D.

Starting with option A: If inflation is high in the EU and the price level in the US is stable, the dollar appreciates. I remember that inflation affects exchange rates. High inflation in a country usually causes its currency to depreciate because the purchasing power decreases. So if the EU has high inflation, their goods become more expensive. People might buy more American goods instead, which would increase the demand for dollars. Higher demand for dollars would make the dollar appreciate. So in this case, with the EU's inflation up and US stable, the dollar should go up. So A seems correct.

Option B: If the Fed decreases the money supply, the dollar depreciates. Wait, when the money supply decreases, interest rates usually go up because there's less money chasing loans. Higher interest rates attract foreign investors, increasing demand for the dollar, which makes it appreciate. So if the Fed decreases money supply, I think the dollar would appreciate, not depreciate. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: If EU consumers buy fewer American goods, the dollar appreciates. Wait, if they buy less, that means demand for dollars decreases because they don't need as many to buy American stuff. Lower demand for dollars would cause the dollar to depreciate, not appreciate. So C seems incorrect.

Option D: If US income rises relative to EU, the euro depreciates. Higher incomes in the US mean Americans might buy more goods, including imports from Europe. That would increase demand for euros, causing the euro to appreciate, not depreciate. So D is likely wrong.

Wait, let me double-check each point. For A, inflation in EU makes their currency weaker, so people might switch to dollars, increasing its value. That makes sense because their goods are more expensive, so demand shifts elsewhere.

For B, reducing money supply reduces the amount of dollars available. Less money in circulation can lead to higher value of the dollar because it's scarcer. So B is incorrect.

C, if EU consumers buy less from the US, the demand for dollars goes down, so dollar should depreciate, so C is wrong.

D, higher US income means more spending, possibly more imports, increasing demand for euros, so euro would go up. So D is wrong.

So the correct answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. If inflation is high in the EU and price levels in the U.S. are stable, the dollar appreciates because higher inflation in the EU reduces the purchasing power of the euro, making U.S. goods relatively cheaper and increasing demand for dollars.

Answer: A
