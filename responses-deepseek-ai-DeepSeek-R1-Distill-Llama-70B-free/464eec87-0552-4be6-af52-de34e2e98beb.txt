Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully. Let's start by reading the question again.

The problem says there's a pressure vessel with an inert gas at 140°F and 10 atm. Then it's heated until the pressure becomes 20 atm. We need to calculate q (heat transfer per unit mass), ΔE (change in total energy), and ΔH (change in enthalpy) for one pound mole of the gas.

Hmm, inert gases are monoatomic, right? So I can probably model this using the ideal gas law and the specific heats for monoatomic gases.

Wait, but the process here—how is the gas being heated? Is the volume constant? Or is the pressure increasing, so maybe it's a constant volume process. Because if we're heating it and the pressure increases, but if the vessel is rigid, volume stays the same. I think that's the case here since it's a pressure vessel, which typically has fixed volume.

Oh wait, no, wait. Pressure vessels can have varying volumes, but without more info, I guess I should assume it's a constant volume process. Alternatively, maybe the heating occurs in a way that the volume changes. Wait, I'm not sure. The question doesn't specify whether it's at constant volume or not. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the approach would differ based on that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ideal gas law. PV = nRT. Since the pressure changes from 10 atm to 20 atm, maybe the volume is constant because it's a rigid vessel. Let's assume it's a constant volume process for now.

So, if it's a constant volume process, then the heat transfer (q) is related to the change in internal energy (ΔU). Because for constant volume, qv = ΔU.

But wait, the problem is about q per unit mass, and the change in total energy (ΔE). Wait, but for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So if we can find the change in temperature, we can find ΔU, which would be n Cv ΔT, where Cv is molar specific heat at constant volume.

Wait, but the problem is about per unit mass, so I'd have to consider specific heat per unit mass, not molar. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says "one pound mole" of inert gas. So n=1 lb-mol. But when calculating per unit mass, I think I need to consider the molar mass. Oh wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list the information:

Initial state: T1 = 140°F. Let me convert that to absolute temperature. Fahrenheit to Rankine: T1 = 140 + 459.67 = 599.67 °R.

Pressure P1 = 10 atm. Vessel volume V is constant.

After heating, pressure P2 = 20 atm. Since PV = nRT, and V and n are constant, P is proportional to T. So T2 = T1 * (P2/P1) = 599.67 * (20/10) = 599.67 * 2 = 1199.34 °R.

So ΔT = T2 - T1 = 1199.34 - 599.67 = 599.67 °R.

Since it's a monoatomic gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume (Cv) is (3/2 R), and at constant pressure (Cp) is (5/2 R), where R is the gas constant.

Wait, but R is usually given in units like Btu/(lb-mol·°R). Let me remember: R is approximately 10.73 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·°R), but more commonly, in some contexts, I've seen it as 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·°R), but maybe I should just use standard values.

Wait, but for specific heat per unit mass, I need to know the molar mass. Since it's an inert gas, let's assume it's Argon, which has a molar mass of about 40 lb/lbmol? No, wait, molar mass is in lb per lb-mol. Wait, no, that's not right. Molar mass is usually in g/mol, so for Argon it's about 40 g/mol, which is 0.04 lb/lbmol. Wait, no, 1 lb-mol is 454 mols, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of specific heat per unit mass.

Wait, perhaps I can avoid that by using molar specific heats and then dividing by molar mass, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, since the problem gives the values in Btu, maybe I can use the molar specific heat multiplied by the number of moles (n=1) and then divide by molar mass to get per unit mass.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe I can find the heat transfer per mole, then since it's per unit mass, I can divide by the molar mass to get per unit mass.

Wait, but the options give q in Btu per unit mass, so maybe I should calculate the heat per mole first and then find per unit mass.

Wait, let's tackle each part step by step.

First, since the process is heating at constant volume (assuming the vessel doesn't expand), the heat transfer q is equal to the change in internal energy for the constant volume process: q = ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

But wait, Cv is molar specific heat. So for monoatomic gas, Cv = (3/2) R, where R is 10.73 Btu/(lb-mol·°R) [Wait, is R in Btu? Wait, no, R is usually in ft·lbf units, but maybe in some contexts it's in Btu. Hmm, perhaps I should confirm.]

Wait, maybe I'm mixing units. Let me recall: The gas constant R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·°R). Alternatively, it's 778.169 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·°R). But since the question is in Btu, I need to convert units appropriately.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work in terms of molar specific heat in Btu units. Let me check: For monoatomic gases, Cv is (3/2) R, and Cp is (5/2) R. So R is 10.73 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·°R), but to get to Btu, since 1 Btu ≈ 778.169 ft·lbf, so R ≈ 10.73 / 778.169 ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb-mol·°R).

Wait, or perhaps I can compute it as R = 1.986 cal/(mol·K), but converting that to Btu/(lb-mol·°R). Hmm, 1 cal is 3.968 Btu, so 1.986 cal/(mol·K) * 3.968 Btu/cal = 7.88 Btu/(mol·°R). But since 1 lb-mol is 454 moles, then R would be 7.88 * 454 ≈ 3580 Btu/(lb-mol·°R). Wait, that can't be right because I remember R being around 10 Btu units, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the problem gives the options in Btu, perhaps I can use the specific heat in Btu/(lb·°R) units.

Wait, but for an ideal gas, the specific heat at constant volume (c_v) is (3/2) R, where R is the specific gas constant. But wait, R is per unit mass, so maybe I'm overcomplicating again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the work done and heat transfer using the first law of thermodynamics: ΔU = q + w. But since it's a constant volume process, w=0, so q = ΔU.

Wait, but the vessel could be flexible, so maybe it's not constant volume. Wait, the problem says it's a pressure vessel, which is typically rigid, so volume is constant. So I think it's a constant V process.

So, for a constant volume process, Q = n Cv ΔT.

But since the question asks for heat transfer per unit mass, I'll have to find Q per unit mass, which is (n Cv ΔT) / m, where m is the mass.

But n is 1 lb-mol, so m = M * n, where M is molar mass in lb/lb-mol. For inert gases, like Argon, M is about 40 lb/lb-mol? Wait, no, wait. No, molar mass is in g/mol, so Argon is about 40 g/mol, which is 0.04 lb/lbmol.

So m = M * n = 0.04 lb/lbmol * 1 lbmol = 0.04 lb.

Wait, that seems really light. Is that correct? Because 1 mole of Argon would be 40 grams, which is 0.088184 lbs? Wait, no, 1 lb is 453.592 grams, so 40 grams is 40/453.592 ≈ 0.0882 lb.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with units. Let me calculate that correctly.

Molar mass M = 40 g/mol = 0.04 kg/mol = 0.088184 lb/lbmol.

So for n=1 lbmol, mass m = M * n = 0.088184 lb.

So, the heat transfer per unit mass q would be (Q) / m, where Q = n Cv ΔT.

Wait, but first, let's compute Q.

Cv for monoatomic gas is (3/2) R, where R is the universal gas constant. R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·°R). But I need to convert Cv into Btu/(lb·°R) to get q in Btu per lb.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using specific heat in Btu units.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the units. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about the molar specific heat at constant volume, Cv, in Btu/(lb-mol·°R).

Since for monoatomic gases, Cv = (3/2) R.

And R is 10.73 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·°R). But I need to convert this to Btu. Since 1 Btu ≈ 778.169 ft·lbf.

So R = 10.73 ft·lbf/(lb-mol·°R) = 10.73 / 778.169 ≈ 0.0138 Btu/(lb-mol·°R).

So Cv = (3/2) * 0.0138 ≈ 0.0207 Btu/(lb-mol·°R).

Then, Q = n Cv ΔT = 1 lb-mol * 0.0207 Btu/(lb-mol·°R) * (599.67 °R) [Wait, no, ΔT is 599.67 °R].

Wait, no, earlier calculation: T1 = 599.67 °R, T2 = 1199.34 °R. So ΔT = 599.67 °R.

So Q = 1 * 0.0207 * 599.67 ≈ 0.0207 * 600 ≈ 12.42 Btu.

Wait, but that seems very low. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.0207 * 599.67 = 0.0207 * 599.67 ≈ let's compute 0.02 * 599.67 = 11.9934, and 0.0007 * 599.67 ≈ 0.4196. So total ≈ 12.413 Btu.

So Q ≈ 12.413 Btu. Since this is for n=1 lbmol, and the mass is 0.088184 lb, then q (per unit mass) is Q/m = 12.413 Btu / 0.088184 lb ≈ let's compute this.

12.413 / 0.088184 ≈ let's see: 0.088184 is approximately 0.088. So 12.413 / 0.088 ≈ 141 Btu/lb.

But looking at the options, the q values are in the thousands, like 3000, 3540, etc. So I must be making a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for R. Let me double-check. Maybe R is 10.73 Btu/(lb-mol·°R)? No, that can't be right because that would make the numbers way too big. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different value for R.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific heat in different units. Let me think about specific heat capacity per unit mass. For monoatomic gases, c_v = (3/2) R_specific, where R_specific is R/molar_mass.

Wait, R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·°R). So R_specific = R / M, where M is molar mass in lb/lbmol.

So for Argon, M = 40 g/mol = 0.04 kg/mol = 0.088184 lb/lbmol.

So R_specific = 10.7316 / 0.088184 ≈ let's compute this.

10.7316 divided by 0.088184.

Well, 0.088184 is approximately 0.088. So 10.7316 / 0.088 ≈ 122 Btu/(lb·°R).

Wait, that seems high, but let's proceed.

So c_v = (3/2) * R_specific ≈ (1.5) * 122 ≈ 183 Btu/(lb·°R).

Wait, that can't be right because specific heat capacities are typically much lower. For example, for air, c_v is about 0.17 Btu/(lb·°R), and for Argon, it's similar. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for R. Let me check again.

The gas constant R is 53.3533 ft·lbf/(lb·°R). Because R = 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·°R), but perhaps in terms of per unit mass, it's different.

Wait, another approach. The specific gas constant R_specific is given by R (universal) divided by molar mass M.

So R_specific = R / M.

Given that R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·°R), and M is 0.088184 lb/lbmol (for Argon), then R_specific = 10.7316 / 0.088184 ≈ 121.86 ft·lbf/(lb·°R).

But to convert ft·lbf to Btu: 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf.

So R_specific in Btu/(lb·°R) is 121.86 / 778.169 ≈ 0.1566 Btu/(lb·°R).

So c_v = (3/2) * 0.1566 ≈ 0.2349 Btu/(lb·°R).

That makes more sense. Now, with that, let's calculate q, the heat transfer per unit mass.

q is for constant volume, so q = c_v * ΔT.

ΔT is 599.67 °R.

So q = 0.2349 Btu/(lb·°R) * 599.67 °R ≈ let's compute this.

0.2349 * 600 ≈ 140.94 Btu/lb.

So around 141 Btu/lb.

But looking at the options, the closest q is 3540 Btu in option I, but that's way higher. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the process isn't at constant volume. Because if the vessel is heated and the pressure increases, maybe the volume isn't constant. Hmm, but without knowing the process, it's tricky.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the process path. It just states that the pressure increases from 10 atm to 20 atm upon heating. So perhaps it's a constant volume process, but then again, maybe it's a different process.

Alternatively, maybe the vessel's volume isn't fixed, and heating causes pressure to rise, but perhaps it's a constant pressure process? No, because the pressure changes, so that's not it.

Wait, another approach: the problem asks for the change in internal energy ΔE, which for ideal gases depends only on temperature change, regardless of the process. So ΔE = n Cv ΔT.

Similarly, the change in enthalpy ΔH = n Cp ΔT.

But the heat transfer q depends on the process. Since the process isn't specified, but the question is about q, ΔE, and ΔH, perhaps they are assuming a particular process, like constant volume or constant pressure.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem. It says the vessel is heated until the pressure becomes 20 atm. So perhaps the volume is fixed, hence constant volume heating. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, for a) q: heat transfer per unit mass.

We have:

ΔE = q (since w=0 in constant volume)

ΔE = n Cv ΔT.

But I'm to find q per unit mass, so q = (n Cv ΔT) / m.

Wait, m is the mass of the gas, which is n * M, where M is molar mass.

So, q = (n Cv ΔT) / (n M) ) = (Cv / M) * ΔT.

Which is the same as c_v * ΔT, where c_v is specific heat per unit mass.

Which is what I calculated earlier, giving around 141 Btu/lb.

But none of the options have 141. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the given options again.

Looking at the options:

Option I: q=3540, ΔE=3540, ΔH_v=4610.

Option E: q=3540, ΔE=4610, ΔH_v=4610.

Hmm, but my calculation is q ≈ 141 Btu/lb. None of the options have that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Cv. Let's try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the gas to be diatomic, but it's inert, so it's monoatomic. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the molar specific heat directly without dividing by molar mass. Let me see.

ΔE = n
