Okay, so I've got this question about information theory and encoding symbols. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with average code length, it's related to entropy. Oh right, entropy is the measure of information, and in the case of a zero-memory source, each symbol is independent.

The question gives me four symbols, s1 to s4, each with equal probability of 1/4. So each has a probability of 0.25. I think I need to calculate the average length of the binary code needed to encode these symbols.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the average code length L_avg is calculated by summing each symbol's probability multiplied by the length of its code. But wait, wait! No, waitâ€”that's for when each code is a specific length. But if the codes are assigned according to a certain scheme, like Huffman coding, the calculation is a bit different.

Wait, but looking at the options, maybe this is a straightforward calculation without needing to construct a Huffman tree. Oh wait, no, because if each symbol has the same probability, the entropy would be maximum, right? Because all are equally likely.

So entropy H is the sum of P_i log2(1/P_i) for each symbol. Since there are four symbols each with P=0.25, H would be 4 * (0.25 * log2(4)) ).

Wait, log2(4) is 2, because 2^2=4. So each term is 0.25 * 2 = 0.5. Multiply by 4, so H=2 bits/symbol. But wait, is that the average code length, or the entropy which is a lower bound?

Wait, entropy gives the theoretical minimum average bits needed. So the actual average code length can't be less than H, but can be equal or more. So in this case, if each symbol is equally probable, using a simple code would require each code to be of length 2. Because 2^2=4, so four possible codes, each 2 bits.

Wait, so each symbol is assigned a 2-bit code. So the average code length would be 2 bits per symbol. So the answer would be option A: 2 bits/symbol.

But wait, another thought: If the source is zero-memory, it's using a code where each symbol is coded independently, without considering the previous symbols. So the average length is the sum of each P_i multiplied by the length of its code, L_i.

In the case where each P_i is 0.25, if I assign each a 2-bit code, the average is 4 * (0.25 * 2) = 2 bits/symbol.

Alternatively, maybe if I used a different coding scheme, like unary or something else, but that would probably lead to longer average lengths. But since entropy is 2, the optimal code would achieve that.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute the entropy again. For each symbol, P_i=1/4. So each term is (1/4)*log2(4) = (1/4)*2 = 0.5. Summing four terms gives 2. So entropy is 2 bits. So the minimal average code length is 2. So in this case, if the code is optimal, the average is 2.

Looking at the options, option A is 2 bits/symbol. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the average length \( L_{\text{avg}} \) of binary code needed to encode the symbols, we start by noting that the source is zero-memory, meaning each symbol is encoded independently. The symbols \( s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4 \) each have an equal probability of \( P_i = \frac{1}{4} \).

The average code length is calculated using the formula:

\[
L_{\text{avg}} = \sum_i P_i \cdot L_i
\]

where \( L_i \) is the length of the code assigned to symbol \( s_i \). For a zero-memory source with equally likely symbols, the optimal code assigns each symbol a unique code of equal length. Since there are 4 symbols, each code must be 2 bits long (as \( 2^2 = 4 \)).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
L_{\text{avg}} = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \right) = 2 \, \text{bits/symbol}.
\]

This result aligns with the entropy \( H \), which is the theoretical minimum average bits required:

\[
H = -\sum_i P_i \log_2(P_i) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4} \cdot \log_2(4) \right) = 4 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \right) = 2 \, \text{bits/symbol}.
\]

Thus, the average code length is 2 bits/symbol, and the correct answer is:

**A: 2 bits/symbol**
