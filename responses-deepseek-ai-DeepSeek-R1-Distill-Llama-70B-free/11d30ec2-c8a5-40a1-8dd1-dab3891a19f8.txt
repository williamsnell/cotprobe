Question:

A year ago, a very wealthy man died in a car accident. A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. The butler also testified that the wealthy man had often confided in him and told him shortly after the woman's birth that the woman was the wealthy man's daughter. Upon objection by the attorney for the executor of the wealthy man's estate, the court will most likely

Options:

A: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony is considered privileged communication and is therefore inadmissible.
B: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.
C: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony would be considered gossip and not admissible in court.
D: sustain the objection bc butler's testimony would be violative of hearsay rule.
E: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony is considered a statement against interest and is therefore admissible.
F: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony qualifies under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.
G: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony would be in violation of attorney-client privilege.
H: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under the dying declaration doctrine.
I: overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
J: sustain, bc butler's testimony would be violative of Dead man's statute.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario is about a wealthy man who died a year ago in a car accident. A woman claims she's his daughter and is filing a claim against his estate. Her attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler said it was common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. Also, the butler testified that the wealthy man told him, shortly after the woman's birth, that she was his daughter.

Now, the executor's attorney objected, and the court has to decide whether to sustain or overrule that objection. The options are A through J.

Hmm. So the issue is about the admissibility of the butler's testimony. I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

The butler is testifying about what the wealthy man told him. That sounds like hearsay because it's a statement made by the wealthy man (the declarant) who isn't in court now (since he's dead), and it's being offered to prove that the woman is his daughter.

Wait, but there are exceptions to hearsay. Let me think about the possible exceptions. One is a statement against interestâ€”where the declarant's statement was against their interest at the time. But in this case, the wealthy man saying he has a daughter might not necessarily be against his interest. It depends, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Another exception is a dying declaration, but that requires the declarant to believe they're about to die. The butler's testimony was shortly after the woman's birth, so the wealthy man wasn't dying then, so that exception probably doesn't apply.

What about the pedigree exception? I think that's under FRE 803(23), which allows statements about a person's family, marriage, or the like. But wait, I think that applies when the statement is made by a family member or someone else, but I'm not entirely sure. Also, the butler isn't a family member, so maybe that doesn't apply.

Wait, the butler is testifying about what the wealthy man told him. So the statement is from the man, offered to prove he's the father. So it's hearsay unless there's an exception.

Another thought: in some states, there's a Dead Man's Statute which prohibits a witness from testifying about conversations with a deceased person when the opposing party is the estate or someone affected by the testimony. But I'm not sure if that's federal or state law here, or if the question is assuming that. Option J mentions the Dead man's statute, so that's a possibility.

But wait, the Dead Man's Statute typically applies when a party is testifying about a conversation with a deceased person, and the other side is the estate or someone affected. In this case, the butler is testifying, not the claimant, so maybe the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply here because the butler is a third party, not a party to the case.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the Dead Man's Statute would prevent the butler from testifying about conversations with the deceased if the estate is the opposing party. So if the estate is objecting, then the butler's testimony about the wealthy man's statements would be inadmissible under that statute. So option J says the court will sustain the objection because of the Dead Man's Statute. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the main issue here.

Alternatively, the butler's testimony about the affair being common knowledge might be considered as gossip or not relevant, but the main issue is the statement about the daughter.

So, the statement by the wealthy man to the butler that the woman is his daughter is hearsay. Unless there's an exception, it's inadmissible.

Looking at the options:

Option D says the objection should be sustained because it's hearsay. Option J talks about the Dead Man's Statute. So which applies?

Wait, I think the Dead Man's Statute would make the butler incompetent to testify about communications with the deceased when the executor is the opposing party. So if the butler's testimony is based on what the deceased told him, the Dead Man's Statute would prevent that testimony.

But I'm a bit confused because the butler isn't a party, but the rule usually applies regardless. So if the Dead Man's Statute is in play, the testimony would be inadmissible, so the court would sustain the objection.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction doesn't have such a statute, then the hearsay objection would be the issue. But the question doesn't specify the jurisdiction, so I have to assume it's a general evidence question, possibly based on federal rules.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute is a state law, so in federal court, it might not apply unless it's a diversity case and the state's law is being followed. But the question doesn't specify, so maybe it's not the main issue.

Alternatively, looking at the other options, option I says the pedigree exception applies. But I think the pedigree exception applies to statements about family lineage, but only when the declarant is a family member or someone with personal knowledge. The butler isn't a family member, so maybe that exception doesn't apply.

Another angle: the butler's testimony about the affair is admissible as non-hearsay because it's about what was commonly known, but the statement about the wealthy man saying the woman is his daughter is hearsay.

So the court would have to decide if that statement falls under any hearsay exception. If not, it's inadmissible.

So the options:

Option D: sustain because of hearsay.

Option J: sustain because of Dead Man's Statute.

I'm not sure which applies. Let me think again.

In federal courts, I don't think there's a Dead Man's Statute. Those are state laws. So the objection would be on hearsay grounds.

So the butler's statement about what the wealthy man said is hearsay, and unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible. Since the wealthy man is dead, he can't testify, so the statement would be hearsay.

Wait, but could it be admissible under the statement of personal family history? Or perhaps as a declaration against interest?

Wait, the statement is about the man's own child. Would that be against his interest? Not necessarily. It might not be, unless he had some reason to deny it. But being a father isn't against his interest.

Alternatively, is there an exception for statements of family history or pedigree? FRE 803(27) allows statements concerning the declarant's own family... but the declarant here is the wealthy man, so his statement about his own child would fall under that. Wait, but the butler is the one testifying, and the statement is offered by the woman. So the question is whether the statement is admissible as a pedigree exception.

Wait, the pedigree exception (FRE 803(27)) says that a statement is admissible if it's a statement concerning the declarant's own family, made while the declarant was alive and believed to have a family relationship. But the issue is whether the statement is being offered for the purpose of proving family relationship. Yes, in this case, the woman is trying to prove she's the man's daughter.

So the wealthy man's statement to the butler that she's his daughter would qualify under the pedigree exception. Therefore, the objection would be overruled because it's admissible under an exception.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The butler is testifying about what the man said. So if the man's statement falls under the pedigree exception, then it's admissible as an exception to hearsay.

So the correct ruling would be that the objection is overruled because the statement fits under the pedigree exception. Looking at the options, option I says that.

Wait, let me check option I:

I: overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.

So that would make sense. So the court would overrule the objection, allowing the testimony.

But wait, earlier I thought the Dead Man's Statute might apply, but I think that's more state-specific and perhaps not the primary issue here. The question is more likely testing knowledge of hearsay exceptions, so the pedigree exception would apply.

So the answer would be option I.

Wait, but another thought: the pedigree exception applies when the declarant is a member of the family or someone with personal knowledge. The butler isn't a family member, but the declarant is the family member. So the statement is by the declarant, the wealthy man, about his own family. So it should qualify.

Yes, so the butler's testimony about what the man said would be admissible under the pedigree exception, making option I correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the butler's testimony regarding statements made by the wealthy man. The butler testified that the wealthy man told him, shortly after the woman's birth, that she was his daughter. This statement is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the woman is the wealthy man's daughter). Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

The key issue is whether the wealthy man's statement to the butler qualifies under a hearsay exception. One relevant exception is the pedigree exception under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(27), which allows statements concerning the declarant's own family, made while the declarant was alive and believed to have a family relationship. Here, the wealthy man's statement about the woman being his daughter falls under this exception because it concerns his own family and was made during his lifetime.

Other options, such as the Dead Man's Statute (Option J), are less likely to apply in this context, as the butler is a third-party witness and not a party to the case. Additionally, other exceptions like statements against interest or dying declarations do not fit the facts of this case.

Since the wealthy man's statement qualifies under the pedigree exception, the court would overrule the objection, allowing the testimony to be admitted. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.**
