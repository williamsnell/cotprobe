Okay, so I've got this auditing question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a situation where an audit client has a valid reason for not wanting a certain account receivable to be confirmed. The auditor had selected that account for confirmation, but the client is asking them not to. I need to decide what the auditor should do in this case.

Hmm, I remember that during audits, confirming accounts receivable is a common procedure. The auditor typically sends confirmation requests to the client's customers to verify the balances. But sometimes, the client might have a valid reason for not wanting that. Like, maybe the customer is sensitive about their financial info, or it could harm the business relationship if the client asks them for confirmation.

So the options given are A through D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says to verify the account balance by inspecting the client's bank statements and cash receipts. That makes sense. If the client doesn't want a particular account confirmed, the auditor can look at the transactions to see if the cash was received. Like, after the balance date, if the customer paid, that would support the receivable's existence. This seems like a solid alternative method.

Option B suggests selecting a different account of the same size at random. Wait, but the auditor originally selected that account for a reason, maybe because it's material or has higher risk. Just picking another account randomly might not address the same risk factors. So this might not be the best approach.

Option C is about asking management to document the matter in the management representation letter. I think the management letter is where management asserts that the financial statements are accurate and complete. But if the client has a valid reason, like not wanting to bother a key customer, does that need to be in the representation letter? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about the auditor's procedures rather than a management assertion.

Option D says explain that the request might cause the auditor to disclaim an opinion. That seems a bit harsh. A disclaimer is when the auditor can't form an opinion due to scope limitations. But if the client has a valid reason, the auditor can use alternative procedures to verify the account. So disclaiming might not be necessary unless all other methods fail.

So putting it together: the auditor can't confirm that specific account, but they can use other methods. Option A allows them to verify through bank statements and cash receipts, which would provide evidence about whether the receivable is valid. That seems like the most appropriate next step.

Wait, but what if the account wasn't confirmed and they can't get sufficient evidence from other sources? Then maybe the auditor would have to consider the implications on their opinion. But the question says the client has a valid reason, so I think the auditor would first try alternative methods before jumping to disclaiming.

So the correct answer should be A. They should inspect the bank statements and cash receipts to verify the balance without confirming directly with the customer.

The correct answer is A: Verify the account balance by inspecting the client's bank statements and cash receipt records.

When an auditor is unable to confirm a specific account receivable due to a valid client request, they should seek alternative methods to verify the account balance. Inspecting bank statements and cash receipt records is an appropriate alternative procedure, as it provides evidence of cash receipts that can support the existence and accuracy of the receivable. This approach aligns with auditing standards, which emphasize obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence even when direct confirmation is not possible.

Other options are less suitable: selecting a different account at random (Option B) may not address the same risk factors, requesting documentation in the management representation letter (Option C) is not directly relevant to the auditor's verification process, and disclaiming an opinion (Option D) would be premature unless alternative procedures fail to provide sufficient evidence.

Answer: A
