Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that during a chemical reaction, NO gas gets reduced, and no nitrogen-containing compound is oxidized. I need to find out which of the options is a possible product.

Hmm, let me break this down. NO is being reduced. Reduction means a gain of electrons, right? So in terms of oxidation states, the nitrogen in NO must be going down. Let me remember the oxidation states. In NO, oxygen is -2. So the molecule is NO: N + O = 0 (because it's neutral), so N is +2.

When NO is reduced, its oxidation state goes down. So from +2, it should go to a lower value. Let's look at the possible products and see their oxidation states.

Looking at the options:

A: N2(g) – elemental nitrogen. Nitrogen's oxidation state here is 0. So that's a decrease from +2. That fits with reduction.

B: N2O5(g). Let me calculate. The formula is N2O5. Oxygen is -2 each. So 5*(-2) = -10. The total is 0, so 2N = +10. Each N is +5. That's higher than +2, which would mean oxidation, but the question says no oxidation of nitrogen compounds. So B is higher, so not possible here.

C: NO(g). That's the same as the reactant, so it's probably not a product. Unless in some equilibrium, but the question seems to ask about a product after reduction.

D: NO2^- (aq). Let's see. The charge is -1. Each O is -2, so 2*(-2) = -4. So N must be +3 (because total is -1: N + (-4) = -1 → N = +3). So from +2 to +3? That's oxidation, but the question says NO is reduced, so this would be the opposite. Unless this is a product from another process, but the question specifies that only NO is being reduced. So D is probably not correct.

E: NO3^- (aq). The charge is -1. Each O is -2, so 3*(-2) =-6. So N + (-6) = -1 → N = +5. Again, higher than +2, so oxidation. But the question says no oxidation, so E is out.

F: NO2(g). Let's calculate. O is -2 each, so 2*(-2) = -4. So N must be +4 (since N + (-4) = 0 → N=+4). Oh, so from +2 to +4, that's oxidation. But the question states that NO is being reduced, not oxidized. So F is oxidation, which doesn't fit.

Wait, so the only option where the oxidation state of N decreases is option A: N2(g). Because in N2, nitrogen is 0, which is lower than +2 in NO.

So the reaction must involve NO being reduced. Let me think of a possible reaction. Maybe something like nitric oxide being reduced by something else. For example, in the reaction where NO reacts with hydrogen:

NO + H2 → NH2OH (hydroxylamine) or maybe further to N2 and water. Alternatively, perhaps in a reaction with another reducing agent.

Wait, but in the question, it's NO that's being reduced, and no other nitrogen compounds are oxidized. So whatever the other reactants are, they must be providing the necessary electrons without involving another nitrogen compound being oxidized.

Another possibility is the reaction of NO with more NO in some conditions. Wait, no, that would lead to something else. Alternatively, perhaps NO is reacting with a non-nitrogen containing reducing agent, like carbon monoxide or something else.

Wait, but the product options only include nitrogen-containing products. So the product in this case is N2. So the correct answer is A.

I think that's right. Let me just double-check. Reduction means oxidation state decreases. So from +2 (NO) to 0 (N2). Yes, that makes sense.

During the reaction, NO(g) is reduced, meaning the oxidation state of nitrogen decreases. In NO, nitrogen has an oxidation state of +2. For reduction to occur, the oxidation state of nitrogen must decrease further. Let us analyze the options:

- **A: N₂(g)**: In elemental nitrogen, the oxidation state of nitrogen is 0. This is a decrease from +2, so this fits the criteria of reduction.  
- **B: N₂O₅(g)**: In N₂O₅, each nitrogen atom has an oxidation state of +5, which is an increase from +2. This is oxidation, not reduction.  
- **C: NO(g)**: This is the reactant itself, so it cannot be a product.  
- **D: NO₂⁻(aq)**: In NO₂⁻, nitrogen has an oxidation state of +3, which is an increase from +2. This is oxidation, not reduction.  
- **E: NO₃⁻(aq)**: In NO₃⁻, nitrogen has an oxidation state of +5, which is an increase from +2. This is oxidation, not reduction.  
- **F: NO₂(g)**: In NO₂, nitrogen has an oxidation state of +4, which is an increase from +2. This is oxidation, not reduction.  

The only option where the oxidation state of nitrogen decreases is **A: N₂(g)**, where nitrogen goes from +2 in NO to 0 in N₂. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
