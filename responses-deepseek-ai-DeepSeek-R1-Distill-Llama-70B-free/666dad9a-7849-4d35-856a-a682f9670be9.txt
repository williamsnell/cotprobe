Question:

In June a computer retailer ordered 100 computers, with various configurations, from a manufacturer, to be delivered by August 1. The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. In July the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but stating that "shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20." When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?

Options:

A: No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.
B: Yes, because the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications.
C: Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.
D: No, because the manufacturer failed to deliver on the agreed date.
E: Yes, because the order was not officially canceled by the retailer.
F: No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.
G: No, because the manufacturer changed the terms without the retailer's explicit consent.
H: Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.
I: Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change the delivery dates.
J: No, because the retailer has the right to withdraw the order at any time before shipment.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is between a computer retailer and a manufacturer. In June, the retailer ordered 100 computers with various configurations, to be delivered by August 1. The order form said that acceptance was limited to the terms of the offer. So, the retailer's offer was clear about the delivery dateâ€”August 1.

Then, in July, the manufacturer sent a confirmation. They agreed to the terms and specs but added that shipment would be in two parts: half by August 10 and half by August 20. So the manufacturer is changing the delivery date from August 1 to two later dates.

The retailer, not happy with this, withdrew the order when the shipment wasn't made by August 1. Now, the question is whether the manufacturer can enforce the contract. 

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when an offer is made, the acceptance has to mirror the terms exactly unless the offer allows for changes. If the acceptance proposes different terms, it's a counteroffer, which the original offeror (here, the retailer) can either accept or reject.

In this case, the retailer's offer was explicit about limiting acceptance to the terms of the offer. So the manufacturer couldn't just change the delivery date without it being a problem. By changing the delivery date, the manufacturer's response was a counteroffer, not an acceptance. 

So, the original offer from the retailer required delivery by August 1. The manufacturer's response altered that term, making it a counteroffer. Since the retailer didn't accept this counteroffer (they withdrew the order instead), there's no contract. 

Wait, but the options are about whether the manufacturer can enforce the contract. If there's no contract because the manufacturer didn't accept the original terms, then the manufacturer can't enforce it. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: No, because the order was withdrawn before shipment. That makes sense because without a contract, the retailer can withdraw.

Option F: No, because the offer limited acceptance to its terms. That seems correct too because the manufacturer deviated.

Option G: No, because the manufacturer changed terms without consent. Yes, that's the issue here.

Option J: No, because the retailer can withdraw before shipment. But the main issue is whether a contract was formed in the first place.

So the key point is whether the manufacturer's response was an acceptance or a counteroffer. Since the retailer's offer limited acceptance to its terms, any deviation would not be an acceptance but a counteroffer. Without the retailer accepting that, there's no contract.

So the correct reasoning is that the manufacturer's response was a counteroffer, so no contract was formed. Therefore, the manufacturer can't enforce the contract.

Looking at the options, F says no because the offer limited acceptance. G says no because manufacturer changed terms without consent. Both seem correct, but which is more accurate?

I think F is more about the form of acceptance. The offer said acceptance must be on the exact terms, so any deviation makes it a counteroffer. So F would apply because the manufacturer didn't accept as per the offer's terms. Alternatively, G is about the terms being changed, which is a subset of F.

Wait, the order form "expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer." So the manufacturer's response wasn't an acceptance but a counteroffer. So the retailer is free to revoke because no contract was formed.

So the correct answer would be F or G. Let me check the options again.

Option F: No, because the offer expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. So the manufacturer's response didn't accept, it made a counteroffer. Thus, the retailer can withdraw because no contract exists.

Option G: No, because the manufacturer changed terms without consent. That's also correct, but is it the reason here? The key is that the manufacturer didn't accept the offer as is, so the retailer's withdrawal is allowed because there's no contract.

I think the best answer is F, because it directly addresses the limitation on acceptance.

The question revolves around contract formation and whether the manufacturer can enforce a contract after the retailer withdrew the order. The retailer's offer explicitly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer, including a delivery date of August 1. The manufacturer's response, which proposed two later delivery dates, constituted a counteroffer rather than an acceptance because it deviated from the original terms. Since the retailer did not accept this counteroffer and instead withdrew the order, no contract was formed. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: While it is true that the order was withdrawn before shipment, the key issue is whether a contract existed in the first place. This option does not address the core legal principle.
- **Option F**: This is correct because the offer expressly limited acceptance to its terms. The manufacturer's deviation from these terms meant its response was not an acceptance but a counteroffer, leaving no contract in place.
- **Option G**: This is also correct, as the manufacturer unilaterally changed terms without the retailer's consent. However, the more precise reasoning is that the manufacturer's response was a counteroffer due to the limitation on acceptance in the original offer.

The best answer is **F**, as it directly addresses the limitation on acceptance and explains why no contract was formed. 

Answer: F
