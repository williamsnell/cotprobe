Question:

If every country in the world has the exact same opportunity costs, so that no nation has a comparative advantage in any line of production, could there still be a basis for trade?

Options:

A: Trade would cease without a comparative advantage
B: Trade is solely based on comparative advantage
C: Differences in technology and production methods could create opportunities for trade, even if the opportunity costs are the same.
D: Without comparative advantage, it is impossible for trade to occur
E: Differences in taste, leading to exchange between nations, would stimulate trade regardless of the absence of comparative advantages.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about trade and comparative advantage. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking if every country has the exact same opportunity costs, so no one has a comparative advantage, could there still be a basis for trade?

Wait, I remember that comparative advantage is about countries specializing in producing goods where they have lower opportunity costs. But if every country has the same opportunity costs, that means no country has a comparative advantage over another in anything. So in that case, why would they trade?

But wait, the options suggest other possibilities. Let's look at the options again. 

Option A says trade would cease without a comparative advantage. That makes sense if trade is solely based on comparative advantage. But I'm not sure if that's the only reason countries trade. 

Option B says trade is solely based on that. But I think sometimes countries trade for other reasons, maybe like differences in preferences. 

Option C mentions differences in technology and production methods. But wait, the question states that every country has the same opportunity costs. So if their opportunity costs are the same, maybe their technologies are the same. So this might not apply. 

Option D is similar to A, saying without comparative advantage, trade can't happen. That's a strong statement. 

Option E says differences in taste would lead to trade. Oh, right, even if production costs are the same, countries might have different preferences. For example, if one country values a certain product more, they might export something they produce more of, even without a cost advantage. 

So, even without comparative advantage, countries might still trade based on differences in demand or preferences. So the basis for trade could still exist because of that. 

Alternatively, maybe absolute advantage? But the question says same opportunity costs, which might imply same absolute advantages as well. Or not necessarily? Wait, absolute advantage is about efficiency, while comparative is about opportunity cost. So if two countries have the same opportunity costs, maybe they have the same absolute advantage? Or maybe not. Suppose Country A can produce both X and Y more efficiently than B, but if their opportunity costs are the same, then they have no comparative advantage. 

But in that case, if there's no comparative advantage, but maybe there's still absolute advantage. But if all countries have the same opportunity costs, perhaps they can't gain from specializing based on that. 

Wait, but if everyone is equally good at everything, perhaps they could still trade for other reasons. Like, maybe for variety. Or because they have different resource endowments leading to different outputs. Or maybe different preferences. 

So, in the question, the premise is that opportunity costs are the same, meaning no comparative advantage. But perhaps there could still be trade due to other factors, like differences in demand. 

So looking back at the options, option E says differences in taste would stimulate trade. That seems plausible. Because even if production is the same cost-wise, if one country wants more of a certain good, they might trade to get it. 

Alternatively, option C suggests differences in technology. But if opportunity costs are same, maybe their technologies are same. So perhaps C isn't the right answer. 

So between E and the others. The question is, without comparative advantage, can trade still happen? Yes, because countries might have different preferences or demands. 

So the correct answer would be E.

Even if every country has the same opportunity costs, meaning no comparative advantage exists, trade can still occur due to differences in preferences or tastes among nations. These differences in demand can create a basis for exchange, as countries may specialize in producing goods that are in higher demand elsewhere, even without a cost advantage. 

The correct answer is E.
