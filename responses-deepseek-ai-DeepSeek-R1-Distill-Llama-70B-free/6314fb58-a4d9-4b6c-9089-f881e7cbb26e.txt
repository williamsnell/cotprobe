Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Florence Lesson's car expenses. Let me read it carefully.

So, Florence is a saleswoman who uses her own car for work. The company reimburses her 10 cents per mile she drives. Plus, they pay for her parking and tolls. Last year, she drove 11,472 miles, and her parking and tolls cost $787.44. I need to find two things: (a) the total cost to the company for her car expenses, and (b) the average cost per month.

Alright, breaking it down. First, the company pays her 10 cents per mile. So for the miles she drove, she gets reimbursed. Then there's the parking and tolls, which are additional costs.

So part (a) is the total cost, which would be the sum of the mileage reimbursement and the parking/tolls. Let's calculate each part.

Calculating mileage cost: 11,472 miles * $0.10 per mile. Let me do that math. 11,472 * 0.10 is 1,147.2 dollars. Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. 10 cents per mile times 11,472 miles. Yeah, that's right. So that's $1,147.20.

Then, the parking and tolls were $787.44. So the total cost is 1,147.20 + 787.44 = 1,934.64 dollars.

So part (a) is $1,934.64.

Now, part (b) is the average cost per month. Since the problem says it's for the past year, I'm assuming that's 12 months. So I need to divide the total cost by 12.

1,934.64 divided by 12. Let me calculate that. Let me see, 12 times 161 is 1,932. So 1,934.64 - 1,932 is about 2.64. So that would make it approximately 161.22 dollars per month.

So part (b) is $161.22 per month.

Now, looking at the options. Let's see:

Option A: (a) $1,934.64 and (b) $161.22. That matches both my calculations. So A seems correct.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Did I add correctly? 1,147.20 + 787.44. Let me add them again. 1,147.20 + 700 is 1,847.20. Then add 87.44: 1,847.20 + 87.44 is 1,934.64. Yes.

And 1,934.64 divided by 12 is indeed 161.22. So yes, option A is correct.

The total cost to the company is calculated by adding the mileage reimbursement and parking/tolls expenses. Mileage reimbursement is 11,472 miles × $0.10/mile = $1,147.20. Adding the $787.44 for parking and tolls gives a total of $1,934.64. The average monthly cost is $1,934.64 ÷ 12 ≈ $161.22.
