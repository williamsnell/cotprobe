Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: Find the force on an electrically charged oil drop when it moves at a speed of 1 × 10^2 m/s across a magnetic field whose strength is 2 T. The charge is 2 × 10^-17 C. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force. I think the formula for that is F equals q times v cross B. Oh wait, right, the cross product. So the force depends on the velocity being perpendicular to the magnetic field.

Wait, the problem says it's moving across the magnetic field. So I guess that means the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. So the angle between v and B is 90 degrees. That's good because the sine of 90 degrees is 1, which makes the calculation easier.

So the formula simplifies to F = q * v * B. Let me make sure I'm getting the variables right. Charge (q) is 2e-17 C, velocity (v) is 1e2 m/s, and magnetic field (B) is 2 T.

Plugging in the numbers: F = (2e-17 C) * (1e2 m/s) * (2 T). Let's compute this.

First, multiply 2e-17 by 1e2. 2 times 1 is 2, and 1e2 is 10^2. So 2e-17 * 1e2 = 2e-15 (since 10^-17 * 10^2 = 10^-15). Then multiply that by 2 T: 2e-15 * 2 = 4e-15.

Wait, so F equals 4e-15 Newtons. Now looking at the options, option A is 4 × 10^-15 N. So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I miss any steps? Oh right, the direction of the force is given by the right-hand rule, but since the question only asks for the magnitude, I don't need to worry about direction here.

So yeah, I think I did that right. Charge times velocity times B, since they're perpendicular. Yep, 4e-15 N is the force.

To determine the force on the charged oil drop, we use the formula for the magnetic force:

\[
F = q \cdot v \cdot B \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]

Here:
- \( q = 2 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{C} \) (charge),
- \( v = 1 \times 10^2 \, \text{m/s} \) (velocity),
- \( B = 2 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field strength),
- \( \theta = 90^\circ \) (since the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field, \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\)).

Substituting the values:

\[
F = (2 \times 10^{-17}) \cdot (1 \times 10^2) \cdot (2) \cdot 1
\]

First, calculate \( (2 \times 10^{-17}) \cdot (1 \times 10^2) \):

\[
2 \times 10^{-17} \cdot 1 \times 10^2 = 2 \times 10^{-15}
\]

Then multiply by 2:

\[
2 \times 10^{-15} \cdot 2 = 4 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the force is \( 4 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
