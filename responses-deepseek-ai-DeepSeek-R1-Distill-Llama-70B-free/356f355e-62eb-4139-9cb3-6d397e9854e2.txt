Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with joint tenancy and what happens when one of the joint tenants transfers their interest. Hmm, I remember that joint tenancy is one of the ways people can co-own property, right? The key features I think are the four unities: time, title, interest, and possession. Oh, and the right of survivorship, which means that if one joint tenant dies, the other automatically gets their share without probate.

The question says a sister and brother own a ranch as joint tenants. The sister transfers her interest using a quitclaim deed to her friend without the brother's knowledge. So, what interest does the friend get?

Wait, I need to remember what a quitclaim deed does. From what I recall, a quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time. It doesn't guarantee that they actually have good title or that there are no encumbrances. So if the sister had a certain interest, the friend gets exactly that, whatever it is.

In joint tenancy, each tenant has an undivided right to the entire property. So each owns 100%, but when one dies, the other gets it all. But if one sells their interest, what happens? I think that when a joint tenant sells their interest, it severs the joint tenancy. So the sister was a joint tenant with her brother, but by selling her interest, she's breaking that joint tenancy.

But wait, does the transfer have to be to a third party? I think so. So when the sister transfers her share, she's no longer a joint tenant. The brother remains, but the sister's interest is now gone. But the friend's interest would be as a tenant in common, I believe. Because when a joint tenant transfers their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the new owner holds as a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenant.

Wait, how does that work? So originally, sister and brother are joint tenants. Sister sells her interest to friend. Now, the friend and brother would own the property, but as tenants in common, each owning half. But wait, no, because in joint tenancy, each owned the whole, but upon severance, each owns an undivided half.

So the friend would get the sister's interest, which was an undivided half, but without the right of survivorship. Because once the joint tenancy is severed, the right of survivorship only applies between the original joint tenants. So the brother and friend would be tenants in common, each owning half, but without survivorship. So if one dies, their half goes to their estate, not the other.

So looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option A: A vested remainder interest. No, because a remainder is a future interest, and the friend gets a present interest.

Option B: A life estate. No, the sister didn't grant a life estate, she transferred her ownership interest.

Option C: Full ownership. No, because the brother still has his interest.

Option D: Undivided one-half with right of survivorship. No, because when the joint tenancy is severed, the survivorship right doesn't apply between the friend and brother.

Option E: Undivided one-half without survivorship. That sounds right because the friend gets the sister's half, and now they're tenants in common.

Option F: A lien. Doesn't make sense; a quitclaim deed transfers ownership, not a lien.

Option G: Tenancy in common with brother. Yes, this aligns with option E, because E describes the interest, G describes the type of tenancy.

Wait, so the friend would own an undivided half, and since the sister's transfer severed the joint tenancy, the brother is now a tenant in common with the friend. So both E and G are correct in their aspects. But the question is about the friend's interest. So the friend's interest is an undivided half without survivorship, which is option E, and the ownership structure is tenancy in common (option G). But the question is asking what interest the friend has. So E describes the interest, G describes the type of ownership.

So the answer should be E or G. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

E: An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.

G: A tenancy in common with the brother.

Wait, but the friend's interest is an undivided half, and the ownership structure is tenancy in common. So the friend's interest is E, and G describes the type of ownership. But the question is about the friend's interest, so E is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: when the sister transfers her interest, does she have the right to do so without the brother's consent? Because in joint tenancy, each has the right to transfer their interest, which severs the joint tenancy. So yes, the sister can transfer her interest, and the brother can't stop her. So the friend ends up with the sister's half, and the brother keeps his. But since the joint tenancy is severed, they're now tenants in common. So the friend's interest is an undivided 50% without survivorship.

So I think the correct answer is E: An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.

When a sister and brother own a ranch as joint tenants, they each hold an undivided interest in the entire property with the right of survivorship. When the sister transfers her interest to her friend using a quitclaim deed, she severs the joint tenancy. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time, and in this case, the sister's interest is an undivided one-half of the property. Once the joint tenancy is severed, the ownership structure becomes a tenancy in common between the brother and the friend.

In a tenancy in common, each party owns an undivided one-half interest in the property, but there is no right of survivorship. If one tenant in common dies, their share passes to their estate rather than the other tenant. Therefore, the friend acquires an undivided one-half interest in the ranch without the right of survivorship.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. A vested remainder interest is a future interest, but the friend receives a present interest.
- **B**: Incorrect. A life estate is not created here; the friend receives an ownership interest.
- **C**: Incorrect. The friend does not gain full ownership; the brother retains his interest.
- **D**: Incorrect. The right of survivorship no longer applies after the joint tenancy is severed.
- **E**: Correct. The friend receives an undivided one-half interest without the right of survivorship.
- **F**: Incorrect. A lien is not created; this is a transfer of ownership.
- **G**: Incorrect. While the friend and brother are now tenants in common, the question asks for the friend's specific interest, which is described by option E.
- **H**: Incorrect. The friend is not entitled to future profits; they own an undivided share of the property.
- **I**: Incorrect. A leasehold interest is not created; this is a transfer of ownership.

The correct answer is **E: An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship**.
