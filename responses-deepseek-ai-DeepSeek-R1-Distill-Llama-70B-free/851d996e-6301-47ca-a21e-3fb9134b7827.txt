Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about suspended passive activity losses, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that passive activity losses are a tax topic. Passive activities are those where the taxpayer doesn't actively participate, like rental properties or investments where they're not involved in the day-to-day operations. 

The question is about suspended passive activity losses. So, when an individual has a loss from a passive activity, but there's not enough income from other passive activities to offset it, the loss gets suspended. These suspended losses can be used in the future, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Suspended losses can only be utilized against active income, not portfolio income. Wait, I thought passive activity losses can only offset passive activity income, not active or portfolio. Portfolio income is like interest, dividends, capital gains—so maybe A is incorrect because suspended losses can't be used against portfolio income. Or wait, maybe the point is that they can't use them against active income either. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Option B: Suspended losses must be carried forward five years and back two years. I don't think so. I remember that the general rule is that losses can be carried back a certain period, but I think for passive activity losses, the carryback is limited. Or maybe they can only be carried forward, not back. Wait, the passive activity loss rules don't allow carrybacks except in certain cases, like when the activity is disposed of. So maybe B is incorrect.

Option C: A maximum of 75% of the suspended losses can be used each year when an election is made to forgo the carryback period. I'm not familiar with a 75% limit. I think when you have an election to forgo carryback, it's usually about the period, not the percentage. Maybe this refers to something else, but I'm not sure.

Option D: Suspended losses must be carried back three years and forward seven years. That doesn't sound right. I think the carryback period for losses is typically three years, but for passive activity losses, maybe it's different. Or perhaps the carryforward is indefinite until used. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: Suspended losses must be carried forward, but not back, until utilized. This sounds familiar. I think passive activity losses can only be carried forward to future years when there's passive income to offset them. They can't be carried back unless the activity is disposed of. So E might be correct.

Option F: Suspended losses can be carried back three years, but not forward. No, I don't think so. Because without the disposition, you can't carry back. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: $3,000 of suspended losses can be utilized each year against portfolio income. No, because passive losses can't offset portfolio income. Portfolio income is non-passive, so G is incorrect.

Option H: A maximum of 50% of the suspended losses can be used each year when an election is made. I don't recall a 50% limit. Maybe this is about net operating losses, not passive activity. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: Only 25% of the suspended losses can be used each year without any carryback or carryforward. I don't think there's a 25% limit. Maybe this is confusing different rules, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Suspended losses can be carried back and forward indefinitely until utilized. Well, carryback is usually limited, but for passive activities, I think carryforward is indefinite until used. But carryback is only allowed in specific cases, like when the activity is sold. So J's statement about both being indefinite might not be right.

So, going back to option E: Suspended losses must be carried forward, but not back, until utilized. That aligns with what I remember. Normally, you can't carry back passive losses unless you dispose of the activity, which would allow you to deduct the suspended losses against any income in that year. But in general, without disposal, you carry forward.

So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is:

E: Suspended losses must be carried forward, but not back, until utilized.

This is because, under the passive activity loss rules, suspended losses are generally carried forward to future years to offset passive income and cannot be carried back unless the activity is disposed of. 

Answer: E
