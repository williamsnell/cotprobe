Okay, so I've got this 13C NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy problems. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the 13C spectrum of an isomer of C6H14, which I know is hexane or one of its isomers. The specific thing to find out is which isomer has five distinct chemical shifts in its 13C NMR. The options are A through I, each a different isomer.

First, I remember that in 13C NMR, each unique carbon environment gives a distinct signal. So, the number of lines in the spectrum corresponds to the number of different types of carbons in the molecule.

Let me list out each option and try to determine how many unique carbons each has.

Option A: 3-ethylpentane. Let me draw the structure. Pentane is five carbons, but 3-ethylpentane would be CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2CH2 groups. Hmm, maybe I should think of the structure as CH2CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. 3-ethylpentane: the main chain is five carbons. The ethyl group is attached to the third carbon. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try numbering. Carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3: CH with an ethyl group, carbon 4: CH2, carbon 5: CH3? Or wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexane is six carbons. Oh wait, no. The formula is C6H14, so each isomer is a hexane. So 3-ethylpentane must be a six-carbon molecule. So the structure is pentane with an ethyl group on the third carbon. So the main chain is five carbons, but with an ethyl substituent, making it six? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, wait, maybe 3-ethylpentane is not possible because pentane is five carbons. So 3-ethylpentane would be six carbons in total. Let me clarify: the formula for hexane is C6H14. So 3-ethylpentane would have a five-carbon chain with an ethyl group on C3, making it six carbons. So the structure is: CH2CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would be more like 3-ethylpentane, but I'm getting stuck on whether the main chain is five or six. Hmm. Maybe I should think of each option's structure and count the unique carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about each option's structure and count the unique carbons.

Option B: cyclohexane. That's a six-membered ring, all CH2 groups. But in cyclohexane, all the carbons are equivalent because the ring can chair flip, making all the carbons identical. So the 13C NMR would have only one peak. So that's not the answer since we're looking for five.

Option C: hexane. That's a straight chain: CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. Now, in hexane, the carbons are symmetric. So the first and last are the same (CH3), the second and fifth are the same (CH2), the third and fourth are the same (CH2). So that's only three unique carbons. So the spectrum would have three lines. So not the answer.

Option D: 1,1-dimethylcyclobutane. Let's think about the structure. Cyclobutane is a four-membered ring. 1,1-dimethyl means two methyl groups attached to the same carbon in the ring. So the ring has four carbons, with one carbon having two methyl groups. So the carbons on the ring: the substituted carbon (with two methyl groups) is one type. The adjacent carbons (each connected to the substituted one) are another type. The carbons opposite would be another type? Wait, no. Wait, the ring is four carbons. Let me imagine the structure: C1 is connected to C2 and C4, and has two methyl groups. So C1 is unique. C2 is connected to C1 and C3; C3 is connected to C2 and C4. C4 is connected to C3 and C1. Wait, but in a square ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So the symmetry here depends on whether the molecule is symmetrical enough.

Alternatively, perhaps each position on the ring is unique. Wait, but the two methyl groups are on C1. So C1 is different from C2, C3, and C4. Now, are C2 and C4 equivalent? Because the ring is symmetric. So if I imagine the ring, C1 is at a position, C2 and C4 are each next to C1, and C3 is opposite to C1. So C2 and C4 are equivalent because you can rotate the ring so that they swap. So C2 and C4 are the same. C3 is unique. Then, the methyl groups on C1 are all the same (since they're attached to the same carbon). So the carbons in this molecule: the C1 ring carbon (with two CH3), the C2/C4 ring carbons (each CH2), the C3 ring carbon (CH2), and the methyl carbons. So that's four types from the ring and one from the methyl groups. Wait, but wait, the methyl carbons are attached to C1, so they are all same. So total carbons: C1, C2/C4, C3, and the two methyl groups on C1. But wait, the methyl groups are two, but they are attached to the same carbon, so their chemical environment is same. So methyl groups count as one. So how many unique carbons?

Wait, let me think again. The ring is four carbons. C1 has two methyl groups attached. So C1 is a quaternary carbon (connected to two CH3 and two ring CH2 groups). C2 is attached to C1 and C3. C3 is attached to C2 and C4. C4 is attached to C3 and C1. So in this case, the ring is symmetrical, so C2 and C4 are equivalent. C3 is unique. So the ring contributes three unique carbons: C1, C2/C4, and C3. Then, the two methyl groups on C1 are identical, so that's another unique carbon. So total of four unique carbons. So the 13C NMR would have four peaks. Not five, so D is not the answer.

Option E: 3-methylpentane. Let me think about the structure. Pentane is five carbons, and a methyl group is on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(CH3)-CH2CH2. Wait, but that's not possible because pentane is five carbons. Wait, 3-methylpentane would have a five-carbon chain with a methyl branch on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that would be 3-methylpentane as CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's six carbons. Wait, wait, no. Wait, pentane is five carbons, so 3-methylpentane would be CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, maybe better to write the structure. For pentane, the main chain is five carbons. If a methyl is on C3, then the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's six carbons. Wait, no, wait: wait, C6H14 is hexane. Oh, so 3-methylpentane is actually a hexane isomer. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, maybe the main chain is five, with a methyl on C3, making six carbons. Let me clarify: 3-methylpentane would be CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons, so the formula would be C6H14. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that can't be right because that would be 3-methylpentane as a six-carbon molecule. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of 3-methylpentane as a five-carbon chain with a methyl on C3, making it a six-carbon molecule. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that makes six carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the main chain is five, and the methyl is on C3, making the structure CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that would be six carbons. Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Main chain: five, with a methyl on C3, so that's six in total. So in this structure, how many unique carbons are there?

Carbons:

1: CH3 (end)
2: CH2 connected to C1 and C3
3: CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4
4: CH2 connected to C3 and C5
5: CH2 connected to C4 and C6
6: CH3 (end)

Wait, no, that makes the main chain have six carbons, not five. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Perhaps 3-methylpentane is a five-carbon main chain, but that can't be because the formula is C6H14. Oh, maybe the main chain is five carbons, and the substituent is a methyl group, making six carbons in total. No, wait, that doesn't add up. Let me think of it another way: 3-methylpentane is also known as iso-hexane? Or perhaps it's 3-methylpentane being another name for something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on and maybe come back.

Option F: 2,2-dimethylbutane. That's a butane (four carbons) with two methyl groups on C2. So the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, 2,2-dimethylbutane would be (CH3)3C-CH2CH3? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So 2,2-dimethylbutane is CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's 2-methylpentane or something else. Alternatively, 2,2-dimethylbutane would be (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, butane is four carbons, so 2,2-dimethylbutane would have the structure: CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because that would be five carbons. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of 2,2-dimethylbutane as having the structure (CH3)2CHCH2CH3, but that would be 2-methylpentane. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the names. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)C-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's 2-methylpentane. Alternatively, perhaps 2,2-dimethylbutane is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3, which would be six carbons. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of the structure as (CH3)3C-CH2CH3? No, that's 2,2-dimethylbutane. Wait, but butane is four carbons. So 2,2-dimethylbutane would be:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C with two CH3 groups and connected to C1 and C3.

Carbon 3: CH2 connected to C2 and C4.

Carbon 4: CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because butane is four carbons. So 2,2-dimethylbutane would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C(CH3)2 connected to C1 and C3.

Carbon 3: CH2 connected to C2 and C4.

Carbon 4: CH3.

Wait, but then the formula would be C4H10 plus two methyl groups (each CH3), so that's C4 + 2*(1 C) = C6H14. Oh right, because each methyl is a CH3 group attached to C2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C(CH3)2- (connected to C1 and C3)

Carbon 3: CH2- (connected to C2 and C4)

Carbon 4: CH3

So the carbons are:

C1: CH2

C2: C(CH3)2

C3: CH2

C4: CH3

Wait, but C1 and C3 are both CH2 groups, but are they equivalent? Let's see: The molecule is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, that would be 3-methylpentane maybe. Wait, perhaps I should think again. The correct IUPAC name for (CH3)3CCH2CH3 is 2,2-dimethylbutane. Wait, no, that can't be because butane is four carbons. So 2,2-dimethylbutane is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3? No, that would be five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH3, which is 3-methylpentane, but that's a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the number of unique carbons in 2,2-dimethylbutane. The structure would have:

- Two equivalent methyl groups on C2.

So the carbons would be:

- The central C2 with two methyl groups.

- The adjacent C1 and C3, which are each CH2.

- The terminal C4, which is CH3.

Wait, but in this structure, C1 and C3 are both CH2 connected to C2. Are they equivalent? Because the molecule is symmetric around C2. So C1 and C3 are equivalent. So the unique carbons are: C1/C3 (CH2), C2 (C(CH3)2), and C4 (CH3). But wait, what about the carbons in the methyl groups? The methyl groups on C2 are all the same. So the carbons would be:

1. The methyl carbons attached to C2: all equivalent.

2. C1 and C3: equivalent.

3. C2: unique.

4. C4: unique.

Wait, that would make four unique carbons. But the question is looking for five. So F is 2,2-dimethylbutane, which would have four unique carbons. So not the answer.

Option G: 2,2,2-trimethylpropane. That's also known as 2,2,2-trimethylpropane, but wait, propane is three carbons. So 2,2,2-trimethylpropane would have three methyl groups on C2 of propane. So the structure is C(CH3)3-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's four carbons. Wait, propane is three carbons. So 2,2,2-trimethylpropane would be:

Carbon 1: CH2-

Carbon 2: C(CH3)3 connected to C1 and C3.

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, but that's only four carbons, but the formula is C6H14. Wait, no, the formula for 2,2,2-trimethylpropane would be C3H8 plus three CH3 groups, which would be C3 + 3*(1C) = C6H14. Yes, that's correct. So the structure is:

(CH3)3C-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's 2,2,3-trimethylbutane or something else. Wait, no, 2,2,2-trimethylpropane would be (CH3)3C-CH2-CH3, which is actually 2,2-dimethylbutane. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)C(CH2CH3)2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is (CH3)3C-CH2-CH3, which is 2-methylpentane? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is as follows: the central carbon (C2) is connected to three methyl groups and one CH2 group. So the structure is (CH3)3C-CH2-CH3. So the unique carbons would be:

- The central C2: connected to three methyl groups and a CH2 group.

- The CH2 group on C2: connected to C2 and another CH3.

So the carbons are:

1. The three methyl groups on C2: all equivalent.

2. The C2 itself: a quaternary carbon.

3. The CH2 group attached to C2: which is connected to another CH3.

4. The terminal CH3 on the end.

So that's four unique carbons. So the 13C NMR would have four peaks. So G is not the answer.

Option H: 3,3-dimethylbutane. Let's think about the structure. Butane is four carbons. 3,3-dimethylbutane would have two methyl groups
