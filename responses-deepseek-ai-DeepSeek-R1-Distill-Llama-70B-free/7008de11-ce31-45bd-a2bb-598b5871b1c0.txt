Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about A.C. Pigou's contribution to the analysis of monetary policy effects. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that mainstream economic theory holds that monetary policy affects the economy by influencing interest rates and hence investment. So, the primary mechanism is through interest rates affecting investment decisions. But the question is about what Pigou contributed beyond this.

I remember that Pigou was a key figure in economics, part of the Cambridge school. I think he had some specific effects or theories named after him. One that comes to mind is the Pigou effect, also known as the real balance effect. From what I recall, the Pigou effect suggests that when the money supply changes, it affects the real value of money balances that people hold. 

So if the money supply increases, the value of each unit of money (like each dollar) decreases. But wait, no, that's more about inflation. Alternatively, if prices fall, the real value of money increases. When people feel their wealth has increased because the real value of their money has gone up, they might spend more. This increased consumption can then stimulate the economy, even if interest rates are low or not changing much.

So Pigou's contribution was this additional channel through which monetary policy works, not just through interest rates. This would mean that even when interest rates are low, changes in the money supply can affect the economy by influencing consumption, not just investment.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Pigou provided an additional explanation known as the Pigou effect, where changes in money supply stimulate consumption and recovery independently of interest rates. That fits with what I was thinking.

Option J says he emphasized interest rates, but the question is about what he contributed beyond the mainstream view, which already includes interest rates.

Option I talks about psychological impacts, which might be related, but I think the Pigou effect is more about real balances and wealth effects rather than just psychology.

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D. A.C. Pigou contributed the Pigou effect, which explains how monetary policy can influence the economy through changes in consumption, independently of interest rates.
