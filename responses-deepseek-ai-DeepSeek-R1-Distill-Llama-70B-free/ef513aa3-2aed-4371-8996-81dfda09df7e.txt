Okay, so I've got this question about Goldthorpe and the 'service class.' I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. From what I remember, John Goldthorpe is a sociologist known for his work on social class, especially in the context of industrial societies. He, along with others like Erikson, developed theories about class structures.

The question is asking what Goldthorpe identified as the 'service class.' The options are A to H. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Young men and women in domestic service in the 19th century. Hmm, I think domestic service was more of a historical thing, like in the Victorian era. But Goldthorpe's work was more about modern class structures, so maybe not A.

Option B: Non-manual workers exercising authority on behalf of the state. Wait, non-manual sounds like white-collar jobs. Service class, I think, refers to professionals and managers, so this might fit. But I'm not sure if it's specifically about the state or if it's broader.

Option C: Manual labor jobs like construction or manufacturing. That sounds more like the working class, not the service class. So probably not C.

Option D: Skilled trades like plumbing or carpentry. These are skilled manual jobs, so maybe part of the working class again, not service. So not D.

Option E: Professionals in arts, entertainment, media. That's a specific sector. I don't think the service class is limited to just these fields. It's more about the type of work and position, not the industry.

Option F: Self-employed or run own businesses. Self-employed people might be in a different category. The service class, as I recall, includes salaried professionals, not necessarily entrepreneurs.

Option G: People in consultancy firms recruited by big businesses. Consultancy could be part of the service class, but is that the definition? I'm not certain. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the exact group Goldthorpe was pointing out.

Option H: Those who worked in armed services. That seems specific to military, which might be a separate category. Not sure if that's the service class.

Wait, I think the service class in Goldthorpe's terms refers to salaried professionals, managers, and administrators. They are in non-manual jobs, often in positions of authority, and they're part of the service sector. So looking back, option B says non-manual occupations exercising authority on behalf of the state. But does it have to be on behalf of the state? Or could it be in the private sector too?

Alternatively, I think the service class is more about the nature of their work being in services rather than production. So it's a broader category, including both public and private sectors. So maybe option B is too narrow because it specifies "on behalf of the state," which might only cover public sector workers.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Goldthorpe's service class is part of his class schema, which includes the service class as the top tier, then the intermediate, etc. The service class includes higher-grade professionals, managers, and administrators. They are in positions that offer good prospects and are typically in non-manual roles.

So looking at the options, the one that mentions non-manual and exercising authority would fit. That's option B. But I'm still not sure if it's limited to the state. Maybe in his theory, it's broader. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B because it's about non-manual and authority, which aligns with the service class as managers and professionals. So I think option B is the right choice.

Goldthorpe's 'service class' refers to higher-grade professionals, managers, and administrators in non-manual roles, often in positions of authority. This aligns with option B, which describes individuals in non-manual occupations exercising authority. While the option mentions "on behalf of the state," the service class is broader, encompassing both public and private sectors. Therefore, the best fit is:

B

Answer: B
