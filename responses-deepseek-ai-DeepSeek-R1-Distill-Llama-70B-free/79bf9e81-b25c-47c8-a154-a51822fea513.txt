Okay, so I've got this question here about depreciation using the declining balance method. Hmm, I remember that declining balance is a method where you depreciate an asset by a fixed rate each year, but the amount decreases each year because it's calculated on the current book value. So, let me think through this step by step.

The problem says ABC Leasing Co. charges depreciation at 15% per year using the declining balance method. They bought ten typewriters for $4,800. Wait, so each typewriter must cost $480 because 4800 divided by 10 is 480. Got it.

They're asking for the book value of each typewriter after three years and the depreciation expense for each of those three years. So I need to calculate the depreciation each year and subtract it from the book value each time.

Let me start with the first year. The initial cost is $480. Depreciation rate is 15%, so the first year's depreciation is 15% of 480. Let me calculate that: 0.15 * 480 = 72. So the depreciation expense for year one is $72. Then, the book value at the end of year one would be 480 - 72 = $408.

Moving on to year two. Now, the book value is $408. The depreciation is 15% of that. 0.15 * 408 = let's see, 0.1 *408 is 40.8, and 0.05 is 20.4, so 40.8+20.4 is 61.2. So $61.2 depreciation for year two. Book value becomes 408 - 61.2 = $346.8.

Year three: book value is $346.8. Depreciation is 15% of that. 0.15 * 346.8. Let me compute that. 300 *0.15 is 45, 46.8 *0.15 is 7.02. So 45+7.02 is 52.02. So $52.02 depreciation for year three. The book value then is 346.8 - 52.02 = $294.78.

So after three years, each typewriter's book value is $294.78. Looking at the options, option B is $294.78, which should be the answer. But wait, the question also asks for the depreciation expense for each of the three years. Let me make sure I understand which part of the options they're referring to. The first part is the book value after three years, which is B. Then the depreciation for each year is 72, 61.2, and 52.02. But perhaps the options are only for the book value, as the choices don't list all three depreciation amounts. So the correct answer should be option B, $294.78.

The ABC Leasing Co. purchased ten typewriters for $4,800, so the cost per typewriter is $480. Using the declining balance method at a 15% annual rate, the depreciation and book value for each typewriter are calculated as follows:

- **Year 1**:  
  Depreciation = 15% of $480 = $72.  
  Book value = $480 - $72 = $408.  

- **Year 2**:  
  Depreciation = 15% of $408 = $61.20.  
  Book value = $408 - $61.20 = $346.80.  

- **Year 3**:  
  Depreciation = 15% of $346.80 = $52.02.  
  Book value = $346.80 - $52.02 = $294.78.  

The book value of each typewriter after three years is **$294.78**, which corresponds to option B.  

Answer: B
