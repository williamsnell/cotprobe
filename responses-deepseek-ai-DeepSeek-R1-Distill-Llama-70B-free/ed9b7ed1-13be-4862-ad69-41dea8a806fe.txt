Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the strength of the B₁ field in the context of pulse durations for NMR or MRI, maybe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a 180-degree pulse takes 12.5 microseconds. I remember that the duration of such a pulse depends on the strength of the B₁ field. Oh right, the B₁ field is the radiofrequency field applied during the pulse.

Wait, I think the formula involved here is something like the pulse duration being inversely proportional to the B₁ field strength. Or maybe it's about the rotation angle and the field. Oh yeah, right! The rotation angle (theta) is given by theta = gamma * B₁ * t, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh wait, gamma is a constant for a given nucleus, right? Like for protons, gamma is about 2.675e8 rad/s/T or something like that.

Wait, the formula here would be theta (in radians) equals gamma multiplied by B₁ multiplied by the pulse duration t. So if I rearrange that, B₁ equals theta divided by (gamma * t).

But wait, the question gives the angle in degrees. Oh yes, I need to convert that to radians. Because all the units in physics are in radians for formulas like this. So 180 degrees is pi radians. But wait, wait! The problem mentions 90 or 180-degree pulses, but the given pulse is 180 degrees. So theta is 180 degrees, which is pi radians.

Wait, but wait again. Oh no, wait. Wait, the formula uses theta in radians, correct. So 180 degrees is pi radians, which is about 3.1416.

So, let me plug in the numbers. Theta is pi radians. The time t is 12.5 microseconds. Oh wait, I need to convert that into seconds because the units for gamma are in seconds. So 12.5 microseconds is 12.5e-6 seconds.

Gamma, the gyromagnetic ratio for protons, is approximately 2.675e8 rad/s/T. So putting it all together:

B₁ = theta / (gamma * t) = (pi) / (2.675e8 * 12.5e-6)

Let me compute the denominator first. 2.675e8 multiplied by 12.5e-6. Let's see:

2.675e8 * 12.5e-6 = 2.675 *12.5 * 1e2 (because 1e8 *1e-6 is 1e2). 2.675 *12.5 is... let me compute that. 2.675 *10 is 26.75, 2.675 *2.5 is 6.6875, so total would be 26.75 +6.6875= 33.4375. So 33.4375 *1e2 is 3343.75.

So denominator is 3343.75.

Then B₁ is pi / 3343.75.

Pi is approximately 3.1416. So 3.1416 / 3343.75 = let me compute that.

Let me compute 3.1416 / 3343.75. Hmm, okay, 3343.75 is approximately 3.34375e3. So 3.1416 / 3.34375e3 = approximately 0.000939... Tesla. So that's 9.39e-4 T.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are A:3.8e-4, B:4.2e-4, C:4.7e-4, D:6.2e-4, E:7.1e-4, F:7.8e-4, G:9.3e-4, H:5.9e-4, I:5e-4, J:8.4e-4.

Wait, my calculation gave me 9.39e-4, which is approximately 9.4e-4. The closest option is G:9.3e-4.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation—maybe with the exact value of gamma. Let me double-check the numbers.

Gamma for protons is approximately 267.5e6 rad/s/T, which is 2.675e8. So that's correct.

Wait, the time is 12.5 microseconds, which is 12.5e-6 seconds. Correct.

So 2.675e8 *12.5e-6 = 2.675 *12.5 *1e2. Yes, 2.675 *12.5 = 33.4375, and multiplied by 1e2 is 3343.75.

Pi is 3.1416, so 3.1416 / 3343.75 = let me compute that more accurately.

Compute 3.1416 / 3343.75:

3343.75 * 0.0009 = 3.009375.

Wait, because 0.0009 *3343.75 is 3.009375. So 3343.75 * 0.0009 = 3.009375.

But 3.1416 is higher than 3.009375. The difference is 0.132225.

So 0.132225 left to reach 3.1416. So 0.132225 / 3343.75 = approx 0.132225 /3343.75≈ 3.954e-5.

So total is 0.0009 + 0.00003954 ≈ 0.00093954 Tesla.

Which is 9.3954e-4 T, so approx 9.4e-4. The closest option is G: 9.3e-4. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise numbers. Let me recalculate.

gamma = 2.675e8 rad/s/T.

t=12.5e-6 s.

theta = 180 degrees = pi radians.

So B₁ = theta / (gamma * t) = pi / (2.675e8 * 12.5e-6).

Compute denominator:

2.675e8 * 12.5e-6 = (2.675 *12.5) * (1e8 *1e-6)= 33.4375 * 1e2 = 3343.75.

So B₁ = pi / 3343.75.

Pi is approximately 3.14159265.

So 3.14159265 / 3343.75 = Let's compute this division.

Let me compute 3.14159265 ÷ 3343.75.

We can write it as 3.14159265 / 3343.75 = ?

Let me compute 3.14159265 / 3343.75.

Well, 3343.75 is 334375 *1e-2, so 3.14159265 / (334375 *1e-2) ) = (3.14159265 / 334375 ) * 1e2.

Wait, maybe better to compute 3.14159265 ÷ 3343.75.

Let me see: 3343.75 * 0.00094 = ?

0.00094 *3343.75.

Compute 3343.75 * 0.0009 = 3.009375.

3343.75 *0.00004= 0.13375.

So 0.00094 *3343.75 = 3.009375 + 0.13375 = 3.143125.

Ah! So 0.00094 gives 3.143125, which is just a bit higher than pi (3.14159265). So the actual value is just a little less than 0.00094.

The difference is 3.143125 -3.14159265 = 0.00153235.

So we can compute how much less than 0.00094 it is. Let x be the exact value.

So x = 0.00094 - delta.

We have (0.00094 - delta) * 3343.75 = pi =3.14159265.

We know that 0.00094 *3343.75 =3.143125.

So 3.143125 - (delta *3343.75) =3.14159265

delta *3343.75 =3.143125 -3.14159265=0.00153235.

So delta = 0.00153235 /3343.75 ≈ 4.586e-7.

So x ≈ 0.00094 - 0.0000004586 ≈ 0.0009395414.

So x is approximately 0.0009395 T, which is 9.395e-4 T.

So approximately 9.4e-4 T. Looking back at the options, the closest is option G:9.3e-4.

But wait, why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a miscalculation perhaps? Let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, the formula is theta = gamma * B1 * t.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Wait—another thought. Is the formula theta = gamma * B₁ * t or theta = gamma * B₁ * t * (some factor)?

Wait, in NMR, the rotation angle is given by theta (radians) = (gamma * B1 * t), yes. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the exact value with more precision.

Pi =3.14159265.

3.14159265 / 3343.75 = ?

Let me compute 3.14159265 ÷3343.75.

I can write this as:

Approximately, 3343.75 is 3.34375e3. So 3.14159265e0 / 3.34375e3 = (3.14159265 / 3.34375) ) * 1e-3.

Compute 3.14159265 /3.34375.

3.34375 is approximately 3.34375.

3.14159265 ÷3.34375 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division.

3.34375 goes into 3.14159265 how many times? It's less than one times.

So 0. something.

Compute 3.14159265 ÷3.34375 = approx 0.9395.

Wait, 3.34375 *0.9395 = ?

Let me compute that. 3.34375 *0.9 =3.009375.

3.34375 *0.0395 = let's compute 3.34375 *0.03=0.1003125; 3.34375 *0.0095=0.03178125.

So 0.1003125 + 0.03178125=0.13209375.

So 3.34375 *0.9395=3.009375 + 0.13209375=3.14146875.

Which is very close to pi (3.14159265), so the value is approximately 0.9395. So 3.14159265 /3.34375 ≈0.9395.

So, 0.9395 *1e-3 = 0.0009395 T.

Which is 9.395e-4 T.

So approximately 9.4e-4 T. Looking at the options, the closest is option G:9.3e-4. But wait, 9.395 is closer to 9.4 than to 9.3. So perhaps the options intended to approximate to one decimal place, making it 9.4e-4, but the option G is 9.3e-4. Hmm, but none of the options have 9.4e-4.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Options are:

A:3.8e-4

B:4.2e-4

C:4.7e-4

D:6.2e-4

E:7.1e-4

F:7.8e-4

G:9.3e-4

H:5.9e-4

I:5.0e-4

J:8.4e-4.

So the closest is G:9.3e-4. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me think again.

Wait, could the time be for a 90-degree pulse, but the question says 180-degree. So perhaps the formula uses half the time for 90 degrees? No, the question states that the 180-degree pulse requires 12.5 us, so that's what I used.

Is there another factor, like 2pi somewhere? Or perhaps I should have considered the Larmor frequency? Hmm, no, the formula theta = gamma * B1 * t is correct. So I think my calculation is right.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I should have used the relation between the pulse duration and the field strength. Another approach: the formula for pulse duration is t_p = (pi/2) / (gamma B1) for a 90-degree pulse, but no, wait, no, because the angle is directly proportional.

Wait, for 90 degrees, which is pi/2 radians, the pulse duration t would be (pi/2)/(gamma B1). Similarly, for 180 degrees (pi radians), the time is pi/(gamma B1). So for a 180 pulse, it's twice the duration of a 90 pulse, which makes sense.

So the calculation I did earlier seems correct.

Wait, so why is the option G 9.3e-4 and my calculation 9.395e-4? That's about 0.095e-4 difference, which is 0.000095 T. So perhaps the approximation in gamma is causing this. Because I used gamma as 2.675e8, but perhaps the exact value is slightly different.

Wait, what's the exact value of the gyromagnetic ratio for protons? Let me think. I remember it's approximately 267.5 MHz/T, which is 2.675e8 rad/s/T. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects to use a rounded value of pi as 3.14, which would give a slightly lower B₁ value.

Wait, if I use pi=3.14 exactly:

3.14 /3343.75 = ?

3.14 /3343.75 = let's compute.

3343.75 * 0.00094 =3.143125.

3.14 is less than that. So 3.14 = 0.00094 *3343.75 - (3.143125-3.14)=0.003125.

So 0.00094 - (0.003125/3343.75) = 0.00094 - 0.000000935= approximately 0.000939065 T.

Which is about 9.39065e-4 T, so around 9.39e-4. Still closer to 9.4e-4.

Hmm, so why is the option G 9.3e-4? Maybe the question expects to approximate in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the exponent in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second—checking the exponents again. The time is 12.5 microseconds, which is 12.5e-6 seconds. So in the denominator, gamma is 2.675e8 rad/s/T multiplied by 12.5e-6 s.

So 2.675e8 *12.5e-6=2.675 *12.5 *1e8 *1e-6 = 33.4375 *1e2 =3343.75, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used 12.5 microseconds as 12.5e-6 seconds, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is B1 = theta/(2 * pi * t * gamma)? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the Larmor frequency is gamma*B₀, but here B₁ is the RF field strength. So the original formula holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the amplitude of the B₁ field in terms of the Larmor frequency, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another approach: the nutation frequency is given by omega_nutation = gamma * B1. The time for a 180-degree pulse is t = theta / omega_nutation. So t= (pi) / (gamma B1). Then, rearranged, B1= pi/(gamma t).

Which is exactly what I did before. So that's correct.

So with the numbers I have, I get approximately 9.4e-4 T, and the closest option is G:9.3e-4. But wait, perhaps the actual calculation is a bit less, perhaps due to a slightly different gamma value.

Wait, maybe the exact gamma value used in the problem is different. Let me check. I remember that the exact proton gyromagnetic ratio is approximately 267.52248e6 rad/s/T, which is 2.6752248e8 rad/s/T. So let's use that.

So gamma=2.6752248e8 rad/s/T.

Then, denominator is gamma *t =2.6752248e8 *12.5e-6.

Compute 2.6752248e8 *12.5e-6.

=2.6752248 *12.5 *1e8 *1e-6

=33.440306 *1e2.

Wait, 2.6752248 *12.5= let's compute that.

2.6752248 *10=26.752248.

2.6752248 *2.5=6.688812.

So 26.752248 +6.688812=33.44106.

Multiply by 1e2 gives 3341.06.

So denominator is 3341.06.

So B1= pi /3341.06.

Pi is 3.14159265.

3.14159265 /3341.06 ≈ let's compute.

3341.06 *0.0009395 ≈ ?

0.0009395 *3341.06 = let's compute.

3341.06 *0.0009=3.006954.

3341.06 *0.0000395= 0.13216.

Total≈3.006954+0.13216=3.139114.

Which is very close to pi (3.14159265). So the difference is about 0.00247865.

So 3341.06 * x =3.14159265.

We have x=0.0009395 + (0.002478
