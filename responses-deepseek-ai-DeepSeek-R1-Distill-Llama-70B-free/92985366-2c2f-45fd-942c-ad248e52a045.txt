Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about rotational correlation times. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the rotational correlation time τc is given by the Stokes equation: τc = (4πηr³)/(3kB T). Oh wait, I remember that this is related to how a molecule tumbles in a solvent. The bigger the molecule, the longer it takes to rotate, right?

The problem gives me some data. A small molecule with a relative molecular mass Mr of 100 in water at 298 K has τc of 50 picoseconds (ps). Now, I need to estimate τc for a small protein with Mr = 8400. The key here is that Mr is proportional to the molecular volume. So if the molecular mass increases, the volume increases, which affects the radius in the equation.

Wait, I think the approach here is to relate the two τc values based on their molecular masses. Since Mr is proportional to volume, and volume scales with the cube of the radius, maybe I can find the ratio of their radii and then plug that into the τc formula.

Let me break it down. The initial τc is 50 ps for Mr=100. The new Mr is 8400. So the ratio of the new Mr to the old is 8400/100 = 84. Since Mr is proportional to volume, which is (4/3)πr³, the volume ratio is (r2/r1)³ = 84. So r2 = r1 * cube root of 84.

But wait, the formula for τc is proportional to r³. Because in the equation, τc is proportional to r³ (since τc = (4πη r³)/(3kBT)). Oh wait, right, so τc is proportional to r³. So if the new r is (cube root(84)) times the old r, then the new τc is (cube root(84))³ times the old τc. Because (r2/r1)³ is 84, so τc2 = τc1 * 84.

Wait, that makes sense. So the new τc is 50 ps multiplied by 84. Because the radius cubed in τc leads to τc scaling with the cube of the radius, which comes from the cube of the volume (since volume is proportional to r³ and Mr is proportional to volume).

So 50 ps times 84 is 4200 ps. Wait, 50 * 84 is 4200. Oh wait, but 50 * 84 is 4200, yes. 4200 picoseconds is 4.2 nanoseconds, because 1 ns = 1000 ps. So 4200 ps = 4.2 ns.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.2 ns. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check. Is the assumption correct that Mr is proportional to volume? I think so, as the problem states that Mr is proportional to the molecular volume. So for spherical objects, volume is proportional to r³, so Mr ∝ r³ → r ∝ (Mr)^(1/3). Since τc ∝ r³, then τc ∝ (Mr).

So τc2/τc1 = Mr2/Mr1 → τc2 = τc1*(Mr2/Mr1). Oh wait, that's a simpler way. So since τc is proportional to Mr, the ratio is 8400/100 = 84. So τc2 = 50 ps * 84 = 4200 ps = 4.2 ns. Yep, that checks out.

I think I'm confident now. The correct answer is B: 4.2 ns.

The rotational correlation time, τc, is given by the Stokes equation: 

\[
\tau_c = \frac{4\pi\eta r^3}{3k_B T}.
\]

Since τc is proportional to \(r^3\), and the relative molecular mass \(M_r\) is proportional to the molecular volume (which scales as \(r^3\)), τc is directly proportional to \(M_r\). This means:

\[
\frac{\tau_{c2}}{\tau_{c1}} = \frac{M_{r2}}{M_{r1}}.
\]

For the given problem:
- Initial molecular mass: \(M_{r1} = 100\),
- Final molecular mass: \(M_{r2} = 8400\),
- Initial τc: \(\tau_{c1} = 50 \, \text{ps}\).

The ratio of molecular masses is:

\[
\frac{M_{r2}}{M_{r1}} = \frac{8400}{100} = 84.
\]

Thus, the new rotational correlation time is:

\[
\tau_{c2} = \tau_{c1} \cdot \frac{M_{r2}}{M_{r1}} = 50 \, \text{ps} \cdot 84 = 4200 \, \text{ps}.
\]

Converting 4200 ps to nanoseconds (\(1 \, \text{ns} = 1000 \, \text{ps}\)):

\[
\tau_{c2} = 4.2 \, \text{ns}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 4.2 ns.**
