Okay, so I've got this question about DC machines and windings. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is asking about a 6-pole wave winding and the number of parallel paths. The options are A to J, with various numbers.

Wait, I remember that in DC machines, the winding can be either lap or wave. Lap windings have as many parallel paths as there are poles, right? Because each pole has one path. But wave windings are different. Oh right, wave windings have only two parallel paths regardless of the number of poles. Because the current enters through one brush and leaves through another, creating two paths through the armature.

So the number of poles here is 6. But since it's a wave winding, the number of parallel paths doesn't depend on the number of poles. It's always 2. So the answer should be 2.

Looking at the options, option A is 2. So I think the correct answer is A.

In a DC machine with a 6-pole wave winding, the number of parallel paths is determined by the type of winding rather than the number of poles. Wave windings inherently have 2 parallel paths, as the current splits into two paths through the armature. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: 2

Answer: A
