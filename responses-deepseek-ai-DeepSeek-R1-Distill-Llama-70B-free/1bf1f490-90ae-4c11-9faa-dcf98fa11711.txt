Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex 3D object. Let me see, I remember that in geometry, there are some formulas that relate vertices, edges, and faces. Oh wait, Euler's formula! Yeah, Euler's formula for polyhedrons says that the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces equals 2. So the formula is V - E + F = 2. 

The problem gives me the number of vertices as 15 and edges as 39. I need to find the number of faces. So plugging the values into Euler's formula, it should be 15 (V) minus 39 (E) plus F equals 2. Let me write that out:

15 - 39 + F = 2.

Hmm, let me calculate that. 15 minus 39 is -24. So -24 + F = 2. To solve for F, I add 24 to both sides. So F equals 26. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Euler's formula is V - E + F = 2. So 15 - 39 is indeed -24. Then, -24 + F = 2. Adding 24 to both sides gives F = 26. That makes sense.

So looking at the options, option B is 26. So the answer should be B: 26.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Euler's formula is pretty straightforward for convex polyhedrons. As long as the object is convex, the formula holds, and so 26 faces is the correct answer.

To determine the number of faces of a convex 3D object with 15 vertices and 39 edges, we use Euler's formula for polyhedrons:

\[
V - E + F = 2
\]

Here:
- \( V = 15 \) (vertices),
- \( E = 39 \) (edges),
- \( F \) (faces) is what we need to find.

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[
15 - 39 + F = 2
\]

Simplify:

\[
-24 + F = 2
\]

Solve for \( F \):

\[
F = 26
\]

Thus, the number of faces is 26, which corresponds to option B.
