Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about child development, specifically about attachment. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking about a six-month-old child who shows distress when an attachment figure leaves. What's that called?

I remember that attachment styles are a big part of developmental psychology. There are different terms like secure, avoidant, ambivalent, and disorganized attachment. But wait, the question is about the adaptive response when the child is distressed by the attachment figure leaving.

I think separation anxiety is a normal part of development. Oh right, separation anxiety usually starts around six months and can peak by 18 months. It's when the child feels anxious or distressed when their primary caregiver leaves them. It's a sign that the child has formed an attachment because they notice the absence and are upset by it.

Let me think about the other options just to be sure. Reactive attachment disorder is when a child doesn't form a healthy attachment, maybe because of neglect. But that's not the same as showing normal distress. Stranger anxiety is when kids get nervous around new people, which often happens a bit later, like around 9 months.

Avoidant attachment is when the child doesn't seem to care when the caregiver leaves. Ambivalent is when they're clingy but also resentful. Disorganized is more about inconsistent behavior, like not having a clear strategy for dealing with separation.

Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they're out of sight. That's a Piaget concept, but it doesn't directly relate to attachment styles. 

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be separation anxiety. That's the normal response when the child is distressed by the caregiver leaving, showing that they've formed a bond.

The question asks about the adaptive response of a six-month-old child who shows distress when an attachment figure leaves. This behavior is best described as **separation anxiety**, which is a normal developmental milestone. It typically begins around six months of age and reflects the child's attachment to their caregiver. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Reactive attachment disorder** refers to a lack of attachment due to neglect, not normal distress.
- **B: Separation anxiety** is the correct term for the described behavior.
- **C: Stranger anxiety** involves fear of new people, not separation from a caregiver.
- **D: Avoidant attachment** describes a lack of concern when the caregiver leaves.
- **E: Secure attachment** is a healthy attachment style but doesn't specifically describe distress during separation.
- **F: Ambivalent attachment** involves clinginess and resentment, not just distress.
- **G: Attachment anxiety** is a broader term, not specific to this scenario.
- **H: Object permanence** is a cognitive concept unrelated to attachment.
- **I: Dependent attachment** is not a standard term in attachment theory.
- **J: Disorganized attachment** refers to inconsistent behaviors, not normal separation distress.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: separation anxiety**.

Answer: B
