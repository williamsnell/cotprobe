Question:

In 1993, a farmer had good record title to a farm in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. Before the professor had paid the rancher and taken his deed, the professor visited the farm and observed the fence. However, the teacher was not present when the professor visited the property, and nothing suggested who f anyone was using it. In any case, the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The professor then recorded the deed. Note: This jurisdiction uses Grantor Grantee Indices and has no Tract IndexThe jurisdiction's recording act provides: "Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. "In 2008, in an action to quiet title to the farm, which of the following parties would have priority of title?

Options:

A: The investor.
B: The professor, only if he had searched the title prior to his purchase.
C: The teacher.
D: The rancher.
E: The rancher, if he could prove he paid the highest price.
F: The farmer, if he could prove the initial sale to his son was invalid.
G: The professor.
H: The farmer's son.
I: The teacher, if he could prove he visited the farm regularly.
J: The investor, if he could prove he was the first to record the deed.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by breaking down the facts step by step.

So, in 1993, a farmer has a farm with a fee simple absolute title. That means he owns it outright. Then in 1994, he sells it to his son for $1,000. He gives the son a deed that's signed and looks valid. But the son doesn't record the deed. Hmm, I remember that recording a deed is important for providing notice to others, but if you don't record, it can cause issues later on.

Then in 1998, an investor approaches the farmer. The investor knows about the farmer-to-son deed but still wants to buy the farm for $10,000. The farmer gives the investor a deed, and the investor records it right away. The investor's intent is to get color of title and maybe acquire ownership through adverse possession. They build a fence around the farm that same year. Wait, adverse possession usually requires certain elements like open, continuous, hostile, etc. I don't know if the investor has met all those, but that might come into play later.

In 1999, the son sells the farm to a rancher for $15,000. The son gives the rancher a deed, but the rancher doesn't search the title, doesn't check the property, and doesn't record the deed. So the rancher has a deed but hasn't taken steps to ensure its validity or priority.

In 2003, a teacher buys the farm from the investor for $20,000. The teacher had looked into the title and knew about the prior deed to the son. But the teacher didn't live on the property, just visited twice a week. He did record his deed though.

Then in 2007, the rancher sells the farm to a professor for $25,000. The professor saw the fence when he visited but didn't see the teacher. He didn't search the title either and just recorded his deed after getting it from the rancher.

The question is about who has priority in 2008 when they're trying to quiet title.

The jurisdiction's recording act is important here. It says that any conveyance not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith who pays valuable consideration and records first. So it's a notice or race-notice type of statute, I think. Because it protects subsequent purchasers who are in good faith and record first.

Let me map out the timeline with the relevant parties:

1. Farmer → Son (1994): Deed delivered but not recorded.
2. Farmer → Investor (1998): Deed delivered and recorded.
3. Son → Rancher (1999): Deed delivered, not recorded.
4. Investor → Teacher (2003): Deed delivered, recorded. Teacher had knowledge of prior deed.
5. Rancher → Professor (2007): Deed delivered, recorded. Professor didn't search title.

So the key is the order of recording and who was a bona fide purchaser (BFP) when they bought.

Let's think about each transfer:

- Farmer to Son (1994): Not recorded. So when the Investor comes in 1998 and records, the Investor's deed would take priority over the Son's unrecorded deed if the Investor was a BFP.

Wait, but the Investor knew about the farmer-to-son deed. If the Investor had knowledge, does that affect their status as a BFP? Because a BFP must be without knowledge of prior conveyances.

The Investor's intent was to acquire color of title and get ownership by adverse possession. So maybe the Investor wasn't a BFP because he knew about the prior deed. But I'm not sure. If the Investor had knowledge, he can't be a BFP, right? Because BFP requires that the purchaser have no notice, actual or constructive, of prior claims.

So, if the Investor knew about the son's deed, then when he took the deed from the farmer, he wasn't a BFP. That would mean that his deed, even though recorded, wouldn't be valid against the Son's unrecorded deed. So the Son's interest would still be valid, and the Investor's deed wouldn't void the Son's.

Wait, but the recording act says that unrecorded conveyances are void against subsequent purchasers in good faith who record first. So, if the Investor wasn't a BFP because he had knowledge, then the Son's unrecorded deed remains valid, and the Investor's recorded deed is junior to it.

But the Son's deed wasn't recorded until... Wait, the Son's deed was never recorded. So when the Investor records his deed in 1998, does that affect the Son's rights?

Wait, in 1994, the Son got an unrecorded deed. In 1998, the Investor, with knowledge of the Son's deed, takes a deed from the Farmer and records it. Since the Investor had knowledge, he's not a BFP. So the recording act doesn't protect him against the Son's prior unrecorded deed. Therefore, the Son's deed remains valid, and the Investor's deed is junior.

Then in 1999, the Son sells to the Rancher. The Son's deed was unrecorded, so when the Rancher takes his deed, does he have any protection?

Wait, the Rancher didn't record his deed either. So when the Teacher comes in 2003, buying from the Investor, who had recorded in 1998.

But the Teacher knew about the prior Farmer-to-Son deed. So the Teacher isn't a BFP either because he had knowledge. So when the Teacher records his deed, would that help him? Hmm.

Wait, but the Investor's deed was recorded in 1998, and the Teacher's deed is from the Investor in 2003. If the Investor didn't have good title because the Son's deed was still valid (since Investor wasn't a BFP), then the Teacher would get whatever interest the Investor had, which might be nothing.

So, the chain would be Farmer → Son → Rancher → Professor.

But wait, the Son's deed was unrecorded. So when the Investor records in 1998, if the Investor wasn't a BFP, then his deed doesn't affect the Son's title. So the Son still owns the farm.

Then the Son sells to the Rancher in 1999. The Rancher doesn't record. So when the Teacher buys from the Investor in 2003, the Teacher's claim is through the Investor, who might not have valid title. So the Teacher might not have a valid claim.

Then the Rancher sells to the Professor in 2007. The Professor didn't search the title, but he recorded. However, the Professor's chain is through the Rancher, who got it from the Son. So if the Son's deed was valid, then the Rancher's deed would be valid, and the Professor's would as well, depending on the recording.

Wait, but the Rancher's deed from the Son wasn't recorded. So when the Professor buys from the Rancher, the Professor's status as a BFP depends on whether he had notice. He didn't search the title, so he didn't have constructive notice. But actual notice? He saw the fence built by the Investor. The fence might give him inquiry notice, meaning he should have investigated further. But the question says nothing suggested who was using it, so maybe he didn't have actual knowledge.

Wait, but the Professor didn't search the title, so he might be considered a BFP if he had no actual or constructive notice. Constructive notice would come from the records. Since the Investor's deed was recorded, the Professor, upon a proper search, would have found it. But the Professor didn't search, so he might not have constructive notice. So perhaps the Professor is a BFP.

Wait, no, because the jurisdiction uses Grantor-Grantee indices, and the Professor didn't search, so he wouldn't have found the Investor's or the Teacher's deeds. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, let's think about the interests and who has the better claim.

The Farmer first conveyed to the Son in 1994, unrecorded. Then to the Investor in 1998, who recorded but wasn't a BFP because he knew about the Son's deed. So the Son's deed is still valid.

Then the Son conveys to the Rancher in 1999, unrecorded. The Rancher doesn't record, so when the Investor conveys to the Teacher in 2003, the Teacher knew about the Son's deed, so he's not a BFP. Thus, the Teacher's deed from the Investor doesn't give him good title.

Then the Rancher conveys to the Professor in 2007. The Professor didn't search the title, so he might be a BFP if he had no notice. But the Professor saw the fence. Does that give him inquiry notice? Inquiry notice would require him to make further inquiries, which he didn't do. So maybe he's not a BFP because he had a reason to inquire but didn't.

Alternatively, if the fence was built by the Investor, who had a recorded deed, then perhaps the Professor is charged with knowledge that someone else (the Investor/Teacher) might have an interest. But if he didn't follow up, maybe he's still a BFP.

Wait, but the Professor's deed comes from the Rancher, who got it from the Son, who had the first conveyance. So the chain is Farmer→Son→Rancher→Professor. The Farmer→Investor→Teacher is another chain. But the Investor's chain is junior because the Investor wasn't a BFP, so the Son's interest is still valid.

So the Professor, if he's a BFP, would take priority over the Teacher because the Teacher's chain is through the Investor, who didn't have good title.

Wait, but the Professor's chain is through the Son, whose deed wasn't recorded. So the Farmer→Son deed was unrecorded, then Son→Rancher unrecorded, then Rancher→Professor recorded.

So when the Professor records, does that help? Because the recording act says that prior unrecorded conveyances are void against subsequent purchasers in good faith who record first.

So when the Professor buys from the Rancher, if the Professor is a BFP, then his recorded deed would take priority over any earlier unrecorded deeds. But wait, the Rancher's deed was unrecorded when the Teacher bought from the Investor in 2003.

Wait, the Teacher bought in 2003 from the Investor, who had a recorded deed. But the Investor's title was bad because he wasn't a BFP, so the Teacher's title is also bad.

Then the Rancher sells to the Professor in 2007. The Rancher's deed was unrecorded, but the Professor records his deed. So under the recording act, the Professor, if a BFP, would have priority over earlier unrecorded conveyances.

But the Farmer→Son deed was unrecorded, and the Son→Rancher was unrecorded. So when the Professor records, does that make his interest superior to the Son's?

Wait, the Professor's chain is Farmer→Son→Rancher→Professor. The Farmer→Son was unrecorded, and the Son→Rancher was unrecorded. So when the Professor records his deed, which is the first time this chain is recorded, does that affect the priority?

I think the recording act would protect the Professor if he is a BFP without notice. Because the earlier conveyances (Farmer→Son and Son→Rancher) were unrecorded, the Professor, as a BFP, would take free of those interests if he records first.

But wait, the Investor had already recorded a deed in 1998. So the Investor's deed is in the records, so when the Professor does a title search, he would find the Investor's deed. But the Professor didn't search the title, so he didn't have constructive notice. But actual notice? He saw the fence but didn't know who built it. So perhaps he doesn't have actual notice.

So, the Professor might be a BFP. Thus, when he records his deed, it would take priority over the earlier unrecorded conveyances.

Alternatively, the Teacher had a recorded deed, but his chain was from the Investor, who wasn't a BFP. So the Teacher's title is derivative of the Investor's, which is bad. So the Teacher doesn't have a valid claim.

So putting it all together, the Professor, as a BFP who recorded first, would have priority over the Son's unrecorded deed. Therefore, the Professor's title would be valid.

Wait, but the Professor's deed is from the Rancher, who got it from the Son. The Son's deed was unrecorded, so when the Rancher sold to the Professor, the Rancher's interest was valid because it was from the Son, but unrecorded. So when the Professor records, under the recording act, his deed would be protected against earlier unrecorded deeds if he's a BFP.

So yes, the Professor would have priority.

Looking back at the options, option G is the Professor. So I think the answer is G.

The question revolves around determining the party with priority of title to the farm in 2008 under the jurisdiction's recording act, which protects subsequent purchasers in good faith for valuable consideration who record first. The key is analyzing the chain of title, the recording status of each deed, and whether each purchaser qualified as a bona fide purchaser (BFP).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Farmer → Son (1994):**  
   The farmer conveyed the farm to his son with a valid deed, but the son did not record it. Under the recording act, an unrecorded deed is void against a subsequent BFP who records first.

2. **Farmer → Investor (1998):**  
   The farmer sold the farm to the investor, who recorded the deed. However, the investor was aware of the prior unrecorded deed to the son. Knowledge of a prior conveyance disqualifies the investor as a BFP. Therefore, the investor's recorded deed does not override the son's unrecorded deed, and the son retains ownership.

3. **Son → Rancher (1999):**  
   The son sold the farm to the rancher, but the rancher did not record the deed. The rancher's title depends on the validity of the son's unrecorded deed. Since the son's deed was valid (as the investor was not a BFP), the rancher's interest is valid but unrecorded.

4. **Investor → Teacher (2003):**  
   The investor sold the farm to the teacher, who recorded the deed. However, the teacher knew about the prior unrecorded deed to the son, so the teacher was not a BFP. As a result, the teacher's title is derivative of the investor's invalid claim, and the teacher does not acquire good title.

5. **Rancher → Professor (2007):**  
   The rancher sold the farm to the professor, who recorded the deed. The professor did not search the title and had no actual knowledge of prior conveyances. Although the professor saw a fence built by the investor, nothing indicated ownership, so the professor likely qualifies as a BFP. Under the recording act, the professor's recorded deed takes priority over the earlier unrecorded conveyances (farmer → son and son → rancher).

### Conclusion:  
The professor, as a BFP who recorded first, has priority of title. The teacher's claim fails because the investor's title was invalid, and the son's unrecorded deed remains valid but is overridden by the professor's status as a BFP. The rancher's unrecorded deed does not affect the professor's priority.
