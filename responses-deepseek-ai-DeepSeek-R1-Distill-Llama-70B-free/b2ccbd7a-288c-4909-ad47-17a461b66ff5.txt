Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the space shuttle Challenger and cesium clocks. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with relativity, right? Because when objects move at high speeds or are in different gravitational fields, their time measurements change.

The problem says that in 1985, the Challenger flew a cesium clock and compared it with a fixed Earth clock. The shuttle was orbiting at 330 km above Earth with a speed of 7712 m/s. The question is to calculate the expected time lost per second in picoseconds for the moving clock and compare it with the measured result, which includes a general relativity effect of about 35 ps/s.

Wait, time lost per second. So the moving clock is either running fast or slow compared to the Earth clock. Since the shuttle is moving, I think special relativity would make the moving clock run slower. But also, because it's in a different gravitational potential (higher up), general relativity would make it run faster. So I guess these two effects are in opposite directions.

The measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes both effects. The GR effect is given as +35.0 ps/s. So I think the SR effect must account for the rest of the difference.

But wait, the question is asking to calculate the expected time lost due to SR only, I think. Because the GR part is given as a separate term, so the total would be the sum of both. But the problem says to calculate the expected time lost per second, so maybe we're just looking at the SR effect here.

Wait, no. Let me read the question again. The problem says the measured result includes the GR effect. So the measured value is the combination of both SR and GR. But the options probably correspond to the expected SR effect. Because the question is asking to calculate the expected time lost for the moving clock, which is the SR effect, I think.

Wait, the question says "the expected time lost per second (in picoseconds) for the moving clock." So the moving clock loses time compared to the Earth clock. So the SR effect is making it lose time, and GR is adding time because it's higher up.

So the total is SR loss plus GR gain. But the question is about the SR effect, right? Or wait, the question says "the expected time lost", so maybe it's the sum of both, but the GR is given as a prediction.

I think the way to approach this is to calculate the SR time dilation and the GR time dilation, then see how they combine.

Let me recall the formulas.

For special relativity, the time dilation factor is given by sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1 - (v²)/(2c²) for small velocities. So the time lost per second would be (1 - this factor) multiplied by 1 second, which is approximately (v²)/(2c²) * 1 second.

So the SR effect is a loss, so the clock on the shuttle runs slower by (v²)/(2c²) per second.

For general relativity, the time dilation factor is sqrt(1 - 2GM/(Rc²)) for a clock at radius R compared to one at a larger radius R+h. Wait, actually, the gravitational time dilation is given by sqrt( (1 - 2GM/(R c²)) / (1 - 2GM/(R+h c²)) ) ). But for small h compared to R, this can be approximated as (1 + (GM h)/(R² c²))^{-1/2} ≈ 1 - (GM h)/(2 R² c²).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact signs here. So when you're higher up in a gravitational field, your clock runs faster. So the GR effect would be a positive contribution to the time, meaning the Earth-based clock would see the shuttle's clock as running faster.

Alternatively, the Earth clock is at a lower potential, so it runs slower. So the GR effect on the shuttle's clock is that it gains time. So when you compare the two, the space clock is faster.

So the total time dilation is the combination of SR (slowing down) and GR (speeding up).

The formula for the total time rate is:

dτ/dt = sqrt( (1 - v²/c²) ) * sqrt(1 - 2GM/(R c²)) / sqrt(1 - 2GM/(R+h c²)) )

But for weak fields and low velocities, this can be approximated as:

1 + (SR effect) + (GR effect)

Wait, let's think in terms of fractional changes. The SR effect makes the clock run slower, so it's a negative contribution. The GR effect makes it run faster, a positive contribution.

So the total fractional change is (ΔT/T) = -(v²)/(2c²) + (GM h)/(R² c²) )

Wait, no, the GR term for a clock at height h above Earth compared to Earth's surface would have a time dilation factor of approximately (1 + (g h)/c² ), where g is the gravitational acceleration. Alternatively, using the approximation from the gravitational potential. The change in gravitational potential when moving from R to R+h is ΔΦ = -GM (1/R - 1/(R+h)) ≈ GM h/(R²) (since for h << R, 1/(R+h) ≈ 1/R - h/R²). So the potential increases by ΔΦ = GM h/(R²).

The gravitational time dilation is then (1 + ΔΦ/(c²)) ), so the rate would be faster by (ΔΦ)/(c²) = (GM h)/(R² c²).

So the total fractional rate is:

(1 - (v²)/(2c²)) * (1 + (GM h)/(R² c²)) ) ≈ 1 - (v²)/(2c²) + (GM h)/(R² c²)

But since we're looking for the time lost per second, that would be the SR term minus the GR term.

Wait, no. Time lost per second would be the difference between the Earth clock and the moving clock. So if the moving clock is running slower, we have a positive time loss.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the two effects as:

The SR effect makes the moving clock lose time, so the Earth sees the moving clock as slower by (v²)/(2c²) per second.

The GR effect makes the moving clock (higher up) run faster, so it gains (GM h)/(R² c²) per second.

So the total time difference per second is:

Time lost (SR) - Time gained (GR) = (v²)/(2c²) - (GM h)/(R² c²)

Wait, but no: the Earth-based clock is at a lower gravitational potential, so it runs slower. So when comparing the two, the Earth clock would say that the space clock is running faster by the GR effect. So the space clock loses time because of SR but gains time because of GR.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up signs. Let me try again.

Let’s denote the Earth clock as T and the space clock as T'.

In SR, T' = T * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ T (1 - (v²)/(2 c²)). So in one second of Earth time, the space clock shows T' ≈ 1 - (v²)/(2 c²) seconds. So it's losing time by (v²)/(2 c²) seconds per second.

In GR, the space clock is at a higher gravitational potential, so it runs faster. The time dilation factor is (1 + (GM h)/(R² c²) ), I think. So the space clock's time is T' = T * (1 + (GM h)/(R² c²) ), meaning in one second of Earth time, the space clock would have advanced (1 + (GM h)/(R² c² )) seconds. So the GR effect causes the space clock to gain (GM h)/(R² c² ) seconds per second.

So the total effect is the combination: the space clock loses time due to SR and gains time due to GR.

Thus, the total fractional change is:

(ΔT/T) = (SR effect) + (GR effect) = -(v²)/(2 c²) + (GM h)/(R² c² )

But wait, the SR effect is a loss, so it would be a negative term, and the GR effect is a gain, positive. So the total would be:

dτ/dt ≈ 1 + [ -(v²)/(2 c²) + (GM h)/(R² c²) ]

The time lost per second would be the amount the space clock loses, which is the negative of the GR effect adding to the SR loss.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the difference in rates.

The Earth clock (stationary) observes the space clock running at a rate of:

rate = 1 - (v²)/(2 c²) + (GM h)/(R² c² )

So the space clock is losing time at a rate of (v²)/(2 c²) per second, but gaining (GM h)/(R² c² ) per second. So the net rate is rate = 1 - (v²)/(2 c²) + (GM h)/(R² c² )

If this rate is less than 1, the space clock is running slow; if more than 1, it's running fast.

So the time lost per second would be (1 - rate) = (v²)/(2 c²) - (GM h)/(R² c² )

Wait, no. Because if rate < 1, then the space clock is slower. So the Earth clock sees the space clock as losing (1 - rate) seconds per second.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the difference between the two clocks.

The Earth clock (T) measures the space clock (T') as:

T' = T * (SR effect) * (GR effect)

So the rate is:

dT'/dT = sqrt(1 - v²/c²) * sqrt( (1 - 2GM/(R c²)) / (1 - 2GM/( (R + h) c² )) )

But using approximations:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1 - v²/(2 c² )

And for the gravitational part, as I mentioned earlier, it's approximately 1 + (GM h)/(R² c² )

So multiplying these:

(1 - v²/(2 c² )) * (1 + (GM h)/(R² c² )) ≈ 1 - v²/(2 c² ) + (GM h)/(R² c² )

So the rate at which the space clock runs compared to Earth is 1 - [v²/(2 c² ) - (GM h)/(R² c² ) ]

Wait, no, because when you multiply (1 - a)(1 + b) = 1 + b - a - a b. But since a and b are small, the a*b term is negligible, so approximately 1 - a + b.

So the rate is 1 - (v²/(2 c² )) + (GM h)/(R² c² )

So the space clock runs at a rate of (1 - a + b) times the Earth clock.

So the time lost per second is a - b, but that can't be. Wait, if the rate is less than 1, then the space clock is slow. So if (1 - a + b) < 1, then a > b, so the space clock is losing time.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the difference between the Earth clock and the space clock. So the Earth clock is T, space clock is T'.

The time experienced by the space clock per unit Earth time is T' = T (1 - a + b ), where a = v²/(2 c² ), and b = (GM h)/(R² c² )

So the difference in rate is (T' - T) = T ( -a + b ) = - a T + b T.

But since we're looking for the time lost per second, when T' < T, the space clock is losing time.

So the time lost per second is a - b.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of rates. If the space clock's rate is (1 - a + b ), then for each second of Earth time, the space clock advances (1 - a + b ) seconds.

So the difference is (1 - a + b ) - 1 = -a + b.

If this is positive, the space clock is ahead; if negative, it's behind.

So the time lost per second is when ( -a + b ) is negative, meaning a > b.

In our case, the SR effect (a) is v²/(2 c² ), and the GR effect (b) is (GM h)/(R² c² )

So the time lost per second is (a - b ), but only if a > b, which is the case here.

Wait, but let's calculate the numbers.

Given:

v = 7712 m/s

h = 330 km = 330,000 m

Earth's radius R is about 6,371 km = 6,371,000 m

c = speed of light ≈ 3e8 m/s

GM = gravitational constant * mass of Earth.

G = 6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg²

M = mass of Earth ≈ 5.972e24 kg

So GM = 6.6743e-11 * 5.972e24 ≈ 3.986e14 m³/s²

So let's compute a and b.

Compute a = v²/(2 c² )

v =7712 m/s → v² =7712² ≈ 59,434, 944 m²/s²

c² =9e16 m²/s².

So a = 59,434,944 / (2 * 9e16 ) → 59,434,944 / 1.8e17 ≈ 3.3e-6 ≈ approximately 3.3e-6 s/s.

Wait, 59,434,944 / 1.8e17 → let me compute 59,434,944 / 1,800,000,000,000,000.

Wait, 5.9434944e7 / 1.8e17 = (5.9434944 / 1.8 )e-10 → approx 3.3e-10? Wait, wait, no, wait:

Wait, 5.9434944e7 is 59,434,944.

Divided by 1.8e17 → 5.9434944e7 / 1.8e17 = (5.9434944 / 1.8 ) * 1e-10 → 3.3 * 1e-10 → 3.3e-10.

Wait, no, wait: 5.94e7 / 1.8e17 = (5.94 / 1.8 )e(7-17) )= 3.3e-10.

So a = v²/(2 c² ) = 3.3e-10 per second.

Then b = (GM h)/(R² c² )

Compute numerator: GM h = 3.986e14 m³/s² * 330,000 m = 3.986e14 * 3.3e5 = approx 1.315e20.

Denominator: R² c² = (6.371e6)^2 * (3e8)^2.

Compute R squared: (6.371e6)^2 = approx 4.06e13 m².

c squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So denominator = 4.06e13 * 9e16 = 3.654e30.

So b = 1.315e20 / 3.654e30 → approx 3.6e-11 per second.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

1.315e20 / 3.654e30 = (1.315 / 3.654 )e-10 → approximately 0.36e-10 → 3.6e-11 s/s.

So a = 3.3e-10, b=3.6e-11.

So the time lost per second is a - b = 3.3e-10 - 0.36e-10 = 2.94e-10 s/s.

Wait, that would be 2.94e-10 seconds lost per second.

But wait, the question says to calculate the expected time lost per second, which I think is the SR effect minus the GR effect.

Wait, no, the time lost per second for the moving clock would be the sum of the SR loss and the GR gain. So the net effect is a loss if a > b.

Wait, but the formula we derived earlier was that the rate is (1 - a + b ), so the difference is (-a + b ) per second.

Which would be negative if a > b.

Wait, if a=3.3e-10, b=3.6e-11, then (-a + b )= -3.3e-10 + 3.6e-11 = -2.94e-10.

So the space clock is running slow by 2.94e-10 seconds per second.

But wait, the question asks for the expected time lost per second, so that's 2.94e-10 s/s.

But the answer needs to be in picoseconds. 1e-12 s is a picosecond.

So 2.94e-10 s/s = 294 picoseconds per second.

Wait, 2.94e-10 is 294e-12, which is 294 picoseconds lost per second.

But the measured result is -295.02 ps/s, which includes the GR effect. So the expected time lost (from SR) would be a=3.3e-10 s/s which is 330 ps/s, but wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me go through the calculations again.

First, compute a = v²/(2 c² )

v = 7712 m/s.

v squared: 7712^2 = Let me compute that.

7712 * 7712: Let's compute 7700^2 = 59,290,000. Then 7712 = 7700 +12. So (7700+12)^2 =7700^2 + 2*7700*12 +12^2 =59,290,000 + 184,800 + 144 = 59,474,944 m²/s².

So a = 59,474,944 / (2 * 9e16 ) = 59,474,944 / 1.8e17.

Compute 5.9474944e7 / 1.8e17 = (5.9474944 / 1.8 )e-10.

5.9474944 / 1.8 = approx 3.3 (since 5.94/1
