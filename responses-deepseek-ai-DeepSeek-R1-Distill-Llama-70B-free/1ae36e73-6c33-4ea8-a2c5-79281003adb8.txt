Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about fixed action patterns in animal behavior. Hmm, I remember that fixed action patterns are a type of behavioral response, but I need to think carefully about the specifics. Let me try to break this down.

First, fixed action patterns are innate behaviors, right? So they're not learned. That means any option talking about learning or being unlearned might not be correct. Looking at option A: "is a learned behavior that can be unlearned." Oh, that's the opposite, because FAPs are innate, so A is probably wrong.

Next, fixed action patterns are typically triggered by specific stimuli. I think these are called sign stimuli or releasers. So the behavior is released by the right trigger at the right time. Option B says it occurs the second time the animal is exposed to the correct stimulus. Wait, no, I think the first exposure can trigger it if the stimulus is correct. So maybe B isn't right either.

Option C says it only occurs during sleep. That doesn't make sense. Fixed action patterns are responses to environmental stimuli, so they happen when the animal is active, not just asleep. So C is probably wrong.

Option D mentions it only occurs in the presence of other animals. I don't think that's necessarily true. Some FAPs are social, like courtship behaviors, but others might be solitary, like foraging behaviors triggered by certain sights or smells. So D might not be correct.

Option E says it's influenced by diet. I'm not sure. Diet affects overall health and energy, but FAPs are more about the trigger. Unless the diet affects the ability to perform the behavior, but I don't think that's a defining characteristic. So maybe E isn't the right choice.

Option F: response that develops as the animal ages. Well, some FAPs might appear at certain developmental stages, but once they're present, they're pretty consistent. So I'm not sure if F is correct. It depends on whether the question is about the development or the nature of the response itself.

Option G: triggered by a number of sensory signals. Wait, I thought FAPs are triggered by specific, not numerous, stimuli. Like a particular sound or movement. So G might not be correct because "a number" implies multiple, but maybe it's more about specific signals.

Option H: motor response that may be terminated spontaneously. I think FAPs are usually completed once started, so they don't just stop on their own. For example, once a bird starts building a nest in a certain way, it finishes. So H doesn't sound right.

Option I: occurs without sensory feedback. I'm not sure. Some behaviors might rely on feedback, but FAPs are more about the trigger than ongoing feedback. Or maybe they can occur without it. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, so I'll have to think more.

Option J: a reflex triggered by external stimuli. Reflexes are automatic and usually simple, like pulling your hand from heat. FAPs are more complex behaviors, like a mating dance. So J might not be correct because it's more than a simple reflex.

Wait, going back to the definition. Fixed action patterns are innate, complex behaviors triggered by specific stimuli. They are not learned, so A is wrong. They don't require learning, so B is about the second exposure, which doesn't fit. FAPs are triggered by specific signals, so G is talking about "a number of sensory signals"—maybe that's correct. Or is it more about specific stimuli, not any number?

Another thought: Fixed action patterns are often part of instinctive behaviors. They have a threshold, and once the right stimulus is present, the behavior is released. So the trigger is key. So which options relate to that?

Option G says "triggered by a number of sensory signals"—maybe that's correct because multiple cues could contribute, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe each FAP is triggered by a specific signal, not multiple.

Wait, another angle: Fixed action patterns are typically all-or-none responses. Once the stimulus is present, the behavior proceeds regardless of other factors. So option I says "in the absence of sensory feedback"—maybe that's not necessarily true. FAPs can be influenced by feedback, but they don't require it. Or do they proceed without needing feedback once triggered?

Alternatively, option J is about reflex actions. Reflexes are a type of fixed action pattern, but not all FAPs are reflexes. So J isn't the best answer because FAPs can be more complex than reflexes.

Looking back, the best options seem to be either G or another one. Let me think about what each option says.

Wait, the question is about the definition of a fixed action pattern. So FAPs are innate, so A is out. They are triggered by specific stimuli, so perhaps G is correct if it's about being triggered by sensory signals. Or maybe it's about the presence of a specific stimulus.

Wait, another point: Fixed action patterns are usually released by specific stimuli, but sometimes the stimuli may involve multiple aspects. For example, a combination of visual and auditory cues. So maybe G is correct in that sense.

Alternatively, option J is about reflexes. But FAPs are more complex than simple reflexes. So J isn't the correct answer.

Hmm, another thought: Fixed action patterns are often considered a type of instinct. They are pre-programmed and not based on learning. So the correct answer should relate to being an innate, pre-programmed response.

Looking at the options again, perhaps E, F, or G are possibilities. But E talks about diet, which seems unrelated to the definition.

So, narrowing it down, fixed action patterns are triggered by specific stimuli. So, the correct statement is that they are triggered by sensory signals in the environment. Option G says "a number of sensory signals," which could be correct because sometimes multiple cues are needed. But the key point is that they are triggered by sensory signals, not that they occur under certain conditions like when around others or during sleep.

So, looking at the options, the correct answer must be G.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is option B. It says it occurs the second time exposed to the correct stimulus. Wait, no, I think FAPs can be triggered the first time the correct stimulus is present. So B is incorrect.

Alternatively, is there another option that fits better? Let me look again.

Option J is a reflex, which is a type of FAP, but not all FAPs are reflexes. So J is incorrect.

So, I think the best fit is G: is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment. Because FAPs are responses to environmental stimuli, which are sensory.

Wait, but fixed action patterns are usually released by specific, not numerous, stimuli. So maybe I'm mixing things up. For example, a particular call might trigger a mating behavior. So perhaps it's a specific signal, not a number.

In that case, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to choose the best answer.

Alternatively, maybe option H is correct. Let me read H again: 'is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously.' Do FAPs stop on their own? I think once started, they usually go to completion. So H is incorrect.

Option G says 'triggered by a number of sensory signals'. Maybe the number isn't the key point, but rather the presence of certain signals. So perhaps G is correct in stating that they are triggered by sensory signals, regardless of how many.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E, F, or another.

Wait, another approach: Fixed action patterns are innate and not learned, so A is wrong. They are triggered by specific stimuli, so the correct answer should mention being triggered by stimuli.

Looking at the options:

G: triggered by a number of sensory signals.

J: reflex triggered by external stimuli.

So, J is about reflexes, which are a subset. FAPs include reflexes but are broader. So J isn't the correct answer.

So, G is the best fit because it's about being triggered by sensory signals, which is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought FAPs were triggered by specific, sometimes very specific, stimuli, not just any number. But the option says 'a number'—maybe that's okay, as in multiple aspects or types of sensory input.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I think FAPs are more than reflexes.

Another angle: Fixed action patterns are typically "released" by specific stimuli, and once triggered, they're usually carried out to completion, so H is incorrect because it says they may stop spontaneously.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, option B says "occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life." Hmm, no, that sounds like imprinting, which is a type of learning. But FAPs are not learned, so B is incorrect.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is G: is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment.

Fixed action patterns (FAPs) are innate, complex behaviors that are not learned and are typically triggered by specific stimuli in the environment. These stimuli, often referred to as "sign stimuli" or "releasers," are sensory signals that activate the behavior. FAPs are distinct from learned behaviors, reflexes, or behaviors dependent on social interactions or dietary factors. They are usually completed once initiated and do not require sensory feedback to continue.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. FAPs are innate, not learned behaviors.
- **B**: Incorrect. FAPs can be triggered the first time the correct stimulus is encountered, not necessarily the second time.
- **C**: Incorrect. FAPs are not restricted to sleep cycles.
- **D**: Incorrect. FAPs can occur in both social and solitary contexts.
- **E**: Incorrect. FAPs are not directly influenced by diet.
- **F**: Incorrect. While some FAPs may emerge at specific developmental stages, this does not define their nature.
- **G**: Correct. FAPs are triggered by sensory signals in the environment, though the phrase "a number of sensory signals" might imply multiple cues, which is plausible for some FAPs.
- **H**: Incorrect. FAPs typically proceed to completion once initiated and do not terminate spontaneously.
- **I**: Incorrect. FAPs can occur with or without sensory feedback.
- **J**: Incorrect. While FAPs can include reflexes, they are broader and include more complex behaviors.

The best answer is **G**, as it aligns with the definition of FAPs being triggered by sensory signals in the environment.
