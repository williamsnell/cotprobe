Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying which of the given options is a personal document with closed access. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what a "personal document" means. From what I remember, personal documents usually contain information about individuals, like personal details. And "closed access" probably means that it's not available to the public; only certain people can access it.

Looking at the options:

A: A school's academic calendar. That sounds like something the school would publish for students and staff. I think it's public, so not closed access.

B: A city's census data. Census data is usually aggregated and made public, but sometimes personal details are kept confidential. Wait, but the question is about a personal document. Census data might be more about population stats rather than individual personal info. Not sure yet.

C: Restaurant's menu. Definitely public. Everyone can see the menu, so no way this is closed.

D: National electoral register. That's the list of registered voters, right? I think in some places, the electoral register is public, but maybe not the detailed personal info. Wait, but is it a personal document? Maybe, because it contains individuals' names and addresses. And access might be restricted. Or maybe it's public in some countries, like in the US where voter registration rolls are public records.

E: Company's balance sheet. This is a financial document, usually public if the company is publicly traded. But if it's a private company, maybe not. But is it a personal document? Probably not, since it's about the company's finances.

F: Household account book. That sounds personal. A household would keep track of their expenses and income, so the account book would have personal financial info. Access would likely be closed, only for the household members.

G: Government 'white paper'. Those are official reports, usually public. They outline policies and are meant for public discussion, so definitely not closed.

H: The shares register of a business. This lists the shareholders. I think it's required by law in many places to be available, maybe to the public or at least to shareholders. So possibly not closed access.

I: Public library catalog. That's definitely public. You can search it to find books, so no way it's closed.

So, going back, the options that are personal and have closed access are probably F and maybe D or B.

Wait, the question is about a "personal document". So D is a register of voters, which is more of a government document, even if it contains personal info. Similarly, B is about the city's data, which is more aggregate. F is a household's own document, so it's personal and not shared outside.

So the answer should be F: household account book.

The correct answer is F: household account book. This is a personal document typically kept private within a household, making it a closed access document.

Answer: F
