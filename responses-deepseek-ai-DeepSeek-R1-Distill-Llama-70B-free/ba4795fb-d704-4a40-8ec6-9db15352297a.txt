Question:

Based on the paper “SoK: SSL and HTTPS: Revisiting past challenges and evaluating certificates trust model enhancements”, which of the following statements are false?

Options:

A: Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates.
B: OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn’t been revoked.
C: DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack.
D: Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack on that site.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about SSL/TLS and HTTPS, based on a paper titled something like "SoK: SSL and HTTPS: Revisiting past challenges and evaluating certificates trust model enhancements." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are A through D. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: "Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates." Wait, I remember that DV stands for Domain Validation. So DV certificates are easier to get; the CA just checks that the applicant controls the domain, maybe via an email or a file on the server. EV certificates, on the other hand, are Extended Validation. They require more checks, like verifying the organization's identity, so they're supposed to provide higher assurance. So if a site has an EV certificate, the browser might display more indicators, like the company name in green. So the statement says that DV gives more confidence than EV. That doesn't sound right. I think EV is better, so A must be false. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option B: "OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn’t been revoked." OCSP stapling is when the server includes a cached response from the CA during the TLS handshake. This way, the browser doesn't have to make a separate OCSP request, which is more efficient. So yes, OCSP stapling does allow the server to prove the certificate isn't revoked. So B is true.

Option C: "DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack." DANE stands for DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities. It uses DNS records (like TLSA) to specify which certificates or CAs are valid for a domain. This can prevent MITM attacks because it pins the certificate. SSL stripping is when an attacker downgrades the connection from HTTPS to HTTP. If DANE is correctly implemented, it might make SSL stripping harder because the client enforces the use of specific certificates. So C seems true.

Option D: "Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack on that site." Key pinning, like HPKP (HTTP Public Key Pinning), tells the browser to only trust certain public keys or certificates. So even if an attacker gets a new certificate from a CA, the browser would reject it because it's not pinned. This definitely makes MITM harder because the CA can't just issue a new cert that's accepted without the pinned key. So D is correct.

Going back to A: Since EV requires more stringent checks, a valid EV should give more confidence than DV. So the statement in A is false. So the false statement is option A.
</think>

The question asks which statement is false. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A** claims that Domain Validation (DV) certificates provide more confidence than Extended Validation (EV) certificates. This is incorrect because EV certificates require stricter verification of the organization's identity, providing higher assurance than DV certificates, which only verify domain control. Thus, A is false.

- **Option B** states that OCSP stapling allows a server to prove its certificate hasn't been revoked. This is true, as OCSP stapling efficiently provides revocation information during the TLS handshake.

- **Option C** asserts that DANE makes SSL stripping attacks harder. This is correct, as DANE uses DNS records to enforce specific certificate requirements, making it difficult for attackers to strip SSL.

- **Option D** explains that server key-pinning prevents adversaries from using a malicious certificate issued by a CA. This is true, as key pinning restricts browsers to trusting only specific keys.

The false statement is **A**.

Answer: A
