Okay, so I have this physics problem here about passengers on a carnival ride. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, the question says the passengers are moving at a constant speed in a horizontal circle with a radius of 5.0 meters, and they complete a full circle in 4.0 seconds. I need to find their acceleration.

Wait, I remember that when something moves in a circle, it experiences centripetal acceleration. Oh right, centripetal acceleration is the acceleration that's directed towards the center of the circle. And the formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, where v is the velocity and r is the radius. Or wait, another way to write it is a = (4π² r) / T². Because velocity v can be expressed as 2πr / T, right? So maybe I can use either formula. Let me think which one would be easier with the given values.

The problem gives me the radius, which is 5.0 m, and the time period T is 4.0 seconds. So using the second formula might be more straightforward because I can plug in T directly. Yeah, that makes sense.

Let me write that down: a = (4 * π² * r) / T². Plugging in the numbers, r is 5.0 m and T is 4.0 s. So, let's compute this step by step.

First, calculate the denominator: T squared is 4 squared, which is 16. Then, the numerator is 4 times pi squared times 5. Let me compute 4π². Pi is approximately 3.1416, so pi squared is about 9.8696. Multiply that by 4 gives roughly 39.4784. Then multiply that by 5? Wait wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no: the numerator is 4π² * r. Oh right, because it's 4π² times r. So r is 5, so 4π² *5 is 5*(4π²). So 4π² is about 39.4784, times 5 is 197.392.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Oh no, wait. The formula is (4π² * r) divided by T squared. So 4π² is multiplied by r, which is 5. So 4π² *5 = 20 π². Then divided by T squared, which is 16.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

a = (4 * π² * 5) / (4²)

Which is (20 π²) / 16.

Simplify that, 20/16 is 5/4, so it becomes (5/4) * π².

Pi squared is approximately 9.8696, so 5/4 is 1.25, multiplied by 9.8696 gives about 12.337.

Hmm, but wait, let me recalculate that. 5/4 is 1.25. 1.25 * 9.8696 is approximately 12.337. So the acceleration is around 12.337 m/s².

Looking at the options, option I is 12. So that's the closest. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute using the velocity approach. Let's try that.

Velocity v is the circumference divided by the time period. Circumference is 2πr. So r is 5, so circumference is 2 * π *5 = 10π, which is approximately 31.4159 meters. Time period T is 4 seconds, so v is 31.4159 /4 ≈7.85398 m/s.

Then centripetal acceleration a is v squared divided by r. So v squared is (7.85398)^2. Let me compute that. 7.85 squared is about 61.62 (since 7^2 is 49, 8^2 is 64, 7.85 is closer to 8, so 7.85^2 is 61.6225).

So a = 61.6225 /5 = 12.3245 m/s². That's around 12.3245, which also points to option I, which is 12.

Wait, but why is the answer not exactly 12.3 something? So in the options, 12 is option I. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 4π² r / T²:

4 * (3.14159)^2 *5 / (4^2)

Compute 3.14159 squared: 9.8696.

4 *9.8696 = 39.4784.

Multiply by 5: 197.392.

Divide by 16: 197.392/16 = 12.337 m/s².

So the exact value is approximately 12.337, which is about 12.34. So the closest option is I:12.

So the answer should be I:12.

To determine the acceleration of passengers on a carnival ride moving in a horizontal circle, we use the concept of centripetal acceleration. The formula for centripetal acceleration is:

\[
a = \frac{4 \pi^2 r}{T^2}
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle (\( 5.0 \, \text{m} \)),
- \( T \) is the time period for one complete revolution (\( 4.0 \, \text{s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the denominator (\( T^2 \))
\[
T^2 = 4.0^2 = 16
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator (\( 4 \pi^2 r \))
First, compute \( \pi^2 \):
\[
\pi^2 \approx 9.8696
\]
Then:
\[
4 \pi^2 \approx 4 \times 9.8696 = 39.4784
\]
Now multiply by \( r \):
\[
4 \pi^2 r = 39.4784 \times 5.0 = 197.392
\]

### Step 3: Compute the acceleration
\[
a = \frac{197.392}{16} \approx 12.337 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated acceleration is approximately \( 12.337 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **12**, which corresponds to option **I**.
