Okay, so I've got this problem about nucleate boiling, and I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that nucleate boiling occurs on a surface at 242°F, and the substance is water. I need to find two things: (a) the maximum heat flux per unit area, and (b) the coefficient of heat transfer. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that nucleate boiling is a regime of boiling where bubbles form at specific nucleation sites on the heating surface. The maximum heat flux in nucleate boiling is given by some formula, maybe the Rohsenow correlation or something else. Wait, I think the maximum heat flux in nucleate boiling for water is a known value, but I'm not exactly sure.

I also recall that the maximum heat flux (q_max) for nucleate boiling of water at atmospheric pressure is around 300,000 to 400,000 W/m². But wait, the units here are in Btu/hr-ft², so I need to convert if necessary. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the Rohsenow equation.

The Rohsenow equation relates the heat flux to the temperature difference between the surface and the saturation temperature. The formula is q = μh_lv * (T_s - T_sat) / (v_l * (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2}) ), but I'm not confident about the constants.

Wait, let me think again. For water at standard conditions (like atmospheric pressure), the maximum heat flux is often cited as about 1e6 W/m², but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's probably for something else. Alternatively, I'm getting confused between different units and conditions.

Another approach: I remember that the critical heat flux (which is the maximum for nucleate boiling) for water at atmospheric pressure is around 1,000,000 W/m². But wait, 242°F is the surface temperature. The saturation temperature of water at atmospheric pressure is 212°F, right? So the temperature difference is 242 - 212 = 30°F. Hmm, but how does that help me?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The heat flux for boiling can be calculated using q = h * A * (T_s - T_sat), where h is the heat transfer coefficient. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, I think for the maximum heat flux in nucleate boiling, the value is often given by a correlation. For water, maybe it's 3.5e5 W/m² or something like that. But I'm getting stuck on the units. Because the options are in Btu/hr-ft².

Wait, let me think about unit conversions. 1 W/m² is equal to 0.000317 Btu/(hr-ft²). So if I have a heat flux in W/m², I can multiply by 0.000317 to get to Btu units.

But I'm not sure if I should be using that. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember specific values for water's maximum heat flux. Oh wait, for water at atmospheric pressure, the maximum heat flux is around 3.5 x 10^5 W/m². Let me check: 3.5e5 W/m² is 350,000 W/m². Converting that to Btu units: 350,000 * 0.000317 is about 110.95 Btu/(hr-ft²). But wait, that's way lower than the options given, which are in the hundreds of thousands. So maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait no, perhaps I'm confusing maximum heat flux with something else. Alternatively, maybe the maximum heat flux is a different value. Another thought: I think that the maximum heat flux for nucleate boiling of water is about 1e6 W/m², which would be 317,000 Btu/(hr-ft²), but that's not matching any of the options exactly.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is 390,000 Btu/hr-ft², option I is 400,000, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor. Or perhaps the formula I should be using is different.

Wait, maybe it's the Rohsenow equation, but I'm not sure. The Rohsenow equation is q = (μh_lv) / (v_l (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2})) * (T_s - T_sat) / [C_p (ρ_l/ρ_v)^{0.5} + (T_s - T_sat)/h_lv * (1 + (ρ_l/ρ_v)^{0.5}) ) ]

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The Rohsenow equation is q = μh_lv [ (T_s - T_sat) / (v_l (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2}) ) ] / [ C_p ( (ρ_l/ρ_v) )^{0.5} + (T_s - T_sat) (1 + (ρ_l/ρ_v)^{0.5}) ) / h_lv ) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to look up the constants for water. Alternatively, maybe the maximum heat flux for nucleate boiling is when the exponent in the Rohsenow equation is 1. So when (T_s - T_sat) is such that the denominator becomes 1.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the units. The options are in Btu/hr-ft² for heat flux and Btu/hr-ft²-°F for the coefficient. So the heat flux (q) is in Btu/(hr·ft²), and h is the same.

Maybe I should recall that the maximum heat flux for water at atmospheric pressure (T_sat = 212°F) with a surface at 242°F would be a certain value. The temperature difference is 30°F, which is 16.67°C. Wait, 30°F is approximately 16.67°C because a 1°C change is 1.8°F. So 30°F is 16.67°C.

Wait, another thought: I think the maximum heat flux for nucleate boiling of water is given by q_max = 1.26 × 10^6 W/m². Let me see, 1.26e6 W/m² is 1,260,000 W/m². Converting that to Btu/(hr·ft²): 1,260,000 W/m² * 0.000317 = approximately 400 Btu/(hr·ft²). Wait, no, that can't be right because 1.26e6 * 0.000317 is 400,000+? Let's compute: 1.26e6 * 0.000317 → 1.26e6 * 3.17e-4 = approx 4.0e2 → 400. So 400,000 Btu/(hr·ft²). Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 400,000 for maximum heat flux, but what about the coefficient?

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct maximum heat flux. Alternatively, maybe the maximum heat flux is around 3.5e5 W/m², which would be 350,000 W/m². Converting that, 350,000 * 0.000317 ≈ 111 Btu/(hr·ft²). That doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the heat transfer coefficient. For nucleate boiling, the heat transfer coefficient (h) can be found using the Rohsenow correlation, which is h = [ (q / A) / (T_s - T_sat) ) ] / [ (μh_lv) / (v_l (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2}) ) ]

Wait, no, the Rohsenow equation is q = μ h_lv [ (T_s - T_sat) / (v_l (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2}) ) ] / [ C_p (ρ_l/ρ_v)^{0.5} + (T_s - T_sat) (1 + (ρ_l/ρ_v)^{0.5}) ) / h_lv ]

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, I think the maximum heat flux occurs when the exponent term in the denominator equals 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should just look up the standard values. I think for water at atmospheric pressure, the maximum heat flux is around 1.26e6 W/m², which is 400,000 Btu/(hr·ft²) when converted. So looking at the options, option I has the maximum heat flux as 400,000, and the coefficient is 12,000. But let me check the coefficient.

Wait, how do I find the coefficient? If I have q_max = h_max * (T_s - T_sat), then h = q/(T_s - T_sat). So q is maximum heat flux, and delta T is 30°F.

So if q_max is 400,000 Btu/(hr·ft²), then h = 400,000 / 30 ≈ 13,333 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). Looking at the options, none match exactly, but option I has a coefficient of 12,000, which is close, but option J has 13,000. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum heat flux isn't exactly 400,000. Let me think again. Another approach: I remember that for water, the maximum heat flux in nucleate boiling is about 3.5e5 W/m². Let me compute that again.

3.5e5 W/m² → 350,000 W/m². Multiply by 0.000317 to get Btu/(hr·ft²): 350,000 * 0.000317 = 110.95 Btu/(hr·ft²). That's way lower than the options given. So perhaps I'm confusing the maximum with the critical heat flux, which is higher.

Wait, critical heat flux is the maximum beyond which you get film boiling. Maybe that's what the question refers to as maximum heat flux. So if the critical heat flux for water is about 1e6 W/m², that's 317,000 Btu/(hr·ft²). Hmm, again, the options are higher than that.

Wait another approach: perhaps the maximum heat flux in nucleate boiling is given by the equation q_max = (pi/2) * (ρ_l - ρ_v) * g * h_lv * σ * (D) ... no, maybe that's for something else.

Alternatively, I've heard the term "burnout heat flux", which is the point where nucleate boiling turns into film boiling. For water at atmospheric pressure, I think it's around 1,000,000 W/m², which is 317,000 Btu/(hr·ft²), but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using different units. Let me double-check the unit conversion. 1 W/m² equals approximately 0.000317 Btu/(hr·ft²). So 1e6 W/m² would be 317 Btu/(hr·ft²), which is way lower than the options given. So perhaps the numbers are in different units, like maybe W/in² or something else, but the question says the options are in Btu/hr-ft².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me recalculate. 1 W = 1 J/s. 1 Btu is approximately 1055.06 J. So 1 W = 1/1055.06 Btu/s. But the unit here is Btu per hour, so 1 W = (1/1055.06) * 3600 ≈ 3.414 Btu/hr.

Now, 1 W/m² is 1 W per square meter. 1 ft² is 0.09236 m². So to convert W/m² to Btu/(hr·ft²), the conversion factor is (3.414 Btu/(hr·W)) / (1/0.09236 m²/ft²) ) → 3.414 * 0.09236 ≈ 0.315 Btu/(hr·ft²) per W/m².

So 1 W/m² ≈ 0.315 Btu/(hr·ft²). So 1e6 W/m² is 315,000 Btu/(hr·ft²). That's about 315,000, which matches option I's maximum heat flux of 400,000? Wait, no, 315,000 is closer to option E's 390,000. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the critical heat flux for water is about 1e6 W/m², which is 315,000 Btu/(hr·ft²). So looking at the options, option E is 390,000, which is higher. Option I is 400,000, which is even higher. So perhaps the numbers I'm remembering are not accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum heat flux in nucleate boiling for water at 242°F is calculated using the Rohsenow equation. Let's try that.

The Rohsenow equation is q = μh_lv [ (T_s - T_sat) / (v_l (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2}) ) ] / [ C_p ( (ρ_l/ρ_v) )^{0.5} + (T_s - T_sat) (1 + (ρ_l/ρ_v)^{0.5}) ) / h_lv ]

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the properties. Let's list the properties for water at saturation (T_sat = 212°F, which is 100°C):

- ρ_l ≈ 958 kg/m³
- ρ_v ≈ 0.6 kg/m³
- μ_l (dynamic viscosity) ≈ 0.000281 Pa·s
- h_lv (latent heat) ≈ 2,257,000 J/kg
- v_l = μ_l / ρ_l ≈ 0.000281 / 958 ≈ 2.93e-7 m²/s
- σ (surface tension) ≈ 0.061 N/m
- C_p,l ≈ 4,200 J/kg·K
- g = 9.81 m/s²

The temperature difference (T_s - T_sat) is 242 - 212 = 30°F. Wait, but in Rohsenow, we need to use degrees Celsius or Kelvin. Since it's a difference, 30°F is about 16.67°C, but in Kelvin it's the same as degrees C. So 16.67 K.

So plugging into the equation:

First, compute the denominator term:

C_p ( (ρ_l/ρ_v) )^{0.5} + (T_s - T_sat) (1 + (ρ_l/ρ_v)^{0.5}) ) / h_lv )

Compute (ρ_l/ρ_v) = 958 / 0.6 ≈ 1596.67. The square root of that is sqrt(1596.67) ≈ 39.94.

So the first term in the denominator is C_p * 39.94 ≈ 4200 * 39.94 ≈ 167,736.

The second term is (16.67) * (1 + 39.94) / 2,257,000 → (16.67 * 40.94) / 2,257,000 → (673.3) / 2,257,000 ≈ 0.000298.

So the denominator becomes 167,736 + 0.000298 ≈ 167,736.3.

Now the numerator:

μh_lv [ (T_s - T_sat) / (v_l (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2}) ) ]

Compute v_l (σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v))^{1/2}:

v_l = 2.93e-7 m²/s.

σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v) = 0.061 * 9.81 * (958 - 0.6) → 0.061 * 9.81 * 957.4 ≈ 0.061 * 9.81 ≈ 0.598, then 0.598 * 957.4 ≈ 573. So sqrt(573) ≈ 23.93.

So v_l times sqrt(...) is 2.93e-7 * 23.93 ≈ 7.01e-6 m²/s.

So (T_s - T_sat) / (v_l * sqrt(...)) → 16.67 / 7.01e-6 ≈ 2,376,000.

Now, the numerator is μ * h_lv * 2,376,000.

μ is 0.000281 Pa·s, h_lv is 2,257,000 J/kg.

So 0.000281 * 2,257,000 ≈ 634. So 634 * 2,376,000 ≈ 1.506e9.

So q is numerator / denominator → 1.506e9 / 167,736.3 ≈ 8,977,000 W/m². That's 8.977e6 W/m².

Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than the maximum heat flux I thought. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me double-check the calculation step by step.

Compute denominator terms:

C_p * sqrt(ρ_l/ρ_v) → 4200 J/kgK * 39.94 ≈ 4200 * 40 ≈ 168,000.

Then (T_s - T_sat) is 16.67°C, which is correct.

(1 + sqrt(ρ_l/ρ_v)) → 1 + 39.94 ≈ 40.94.

So (16.67 * 40.94) / h_lv → (16.67 * 40.94) = approx 682.3; 682.3 / 2,257,000 ≈ 0.000302.

So denominator ≈ 168,000 + 0.000302 ≈ 168,000.3.

Numerator:

μ_l = 0.000281 Pa·s.

h_lv = 2,257,000 J/kg.

(T_s-T_sat) is 16.67°C.

Compute v_l * sqrt(σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v)):

v_l = 2.93e-7 m²/s.

σ = 0.061 N/m.

g = 9.81 m/s².

ρ_l - ρ_v = 958 - 0.6 = 957.4 kg/m³.

So σ g (ρ_l - ρ_v) = 0.061 * 9.81 * 957.4 → 0.061 * 9.81 ≈ 0.598; 0.598 * 957.4 ≈ 573 kg/(s
