Okay, so I have this question about the Navigation Acts of 1651 and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading through the provided excerpts and the question carefully.

The excerpts are from the Navigation Acts, which I know were a series of laws passed by the English Parliament to regulate trade. The first part (A) says that after December 1651, goods from Asia, Africa, America, or their islands can't be imported into England, Ireland, or any English colonies except in English ships. The ships must belong to the Commonwealth, with English masters and mariners. Otherwise, the goods are forfeited.

The second part (N) talks about European goods. It says goods from Europe can't be imported except in English ships or ships from the country where the goods were produced. So, if you're importing French goods, they can come in French ships, but not in, say, Dutch ships.

The question is asking about the desired outcome of this legislation. The options are from A to J.

I remember that the Navigation Acts were primarily aimed at weakening the Dutch, who were dominant in maritime trade at the time. The English wanted to take over that dominance. So the main goal was to restrict foreign shipping, especially the Dutch, from engaging in trade with English colonies and England itself.

Looking at the options:

Option E says it's to strengthen England's naval power by forcing all maritime trade in English ships. That makes sense because if all trade has to be in English ships, it would build up the English merchant navy, which in turn supports naval power.

Option J says it's to end Dutch domination by limiting their ability to move goods. That also sounds right because the Dutch were major carriers, so this act would cut them out.

Option B is about domestic industries, but the act is more about shipping than manufacturing. Option C is about economic cooperation, but the acts were more restrictive. Option F is about slave trade, but that's not directly mentioned here. Option H is about spice trade monopoly, but the act is broader than that. Option I is about preventing cheap goods, but again, the focus is on shipping.

So between E and J. Wait, the act requires goods to be transported in English ships or ships of the producing country for European goods. So for non-European goods, only English ships. For European goods, either English or the home country's ships. So this would particularly hurt the Dutch, who were carrying goods from other countries. So J seems to capture that intent.

Option J says to end Dutch domination by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies and other countries. That fits because the Dutch were the middlemen, shipping goods from other places to England. So by requiring goods from Europe to come in their own country's ships or English, it would prevent the Dutch from acting as carriers for others.

Option E is broader about naval power, which is a result, but the desired outcome was more about trade control and undermining the Dutch.

So I think the correct answer is J.

The Navigation Acts of 1651 were enacted to restrict foreign shipping, particularly targeting the Dutch, who dominated maritime trade at the time. The legislation required goods from Asia, Africa, and the Americas to be transported only in English ships, while goods from Europe could be imported in either English ships or those of the producing country. This effectively excluded the Dutch from acting as intermediaries in trade between England and other countries or colonies. The primary goal was to weaken Dutch dominance in maritime trade and strengthen English control over its own trade networks.

J: To end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries.

Answer: J
