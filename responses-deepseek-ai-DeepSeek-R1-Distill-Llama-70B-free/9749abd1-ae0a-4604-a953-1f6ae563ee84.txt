Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the pD of pure D₂O, given that K is 2 × 10^-15. I remember that pD is analogous to pH, so it's the negative logarithm of the deuterium ion concentration, [D₃O⁺], right?

Wait, pure D₂O... So just like water, D₂O can autoionize. Regular water autoionizes into H+ and OH-, but for D₂O, it should ionize into D+ and OD- or maybe D3O+? Hmm, I think the autoionization for D₂O would be 2 D₂O ⇌ D3O+ + OD-. So that's similar to water's H3O+ and OH- formation.

The problem gives me the ion product K, which is 2e-15. I think this is the ion product of D₂O, so K = [D3O+][OD-]. Since D₂O is a solvent and the solution is pure, the concentrations of D3O+ and OD- should be equal, right? Because in pure water, [H3O+] equals [OH-], so same here.

So if I let [D3O+] = x, then [OD-] is also x. Then the ion product K would be x squared. So K = x². Therefore, x is the square root of K.

Let me calculate that. K is 2e-15, so x² = 2e-15 → x = sqrt(2e-15). Let me compute the square root of 2e-15.

Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414, and sqrt(1e-15) is 1e-7.5. Wait, 1e-7.5 is 3.16e-8. So multiplying by sqrt(2), it's about 1.414 * 3.16e-8 ≈ 4.47e-8.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 2e-15 is 2 × 10^-15. The square root is sqrt(2) × 10^(-15/2) → sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, and 10^-7.5 is 3.1623e-8. So 1.414 * 3.1623e-8. Let's calculate that: 1.414 * 3.1623 ≈ 4.472. So x ≈ 4.472e-8.

So the [D3O+] is approximately 4.47e-8 M. Now, pD is -log [D3O+]. So taking the log of 4.47e-8.

Wait, log(4.47e-8) is log(4.47) + log(1e-8). Log(1e-8) is -8. Log(4.47) is about 0.65, because log(4) is 0.60, log(4.5)=0.6532. So log(4.47) is around 0.65.

So log(4.47e-8) ≈ 0.65 - 8 = -7.35. Therefore, pD is -log [D3O+] = 7.35.

Looking at the options, option I is 7.35. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation steps because I might have made a mistake.

Another approach: K = [D3O+][OD-] = (x)(x) = x² = 2e-15. So x = sqrt(2e-15) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(1e-15) = sqrt(2)*1e-7.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is 1e-7, 1e-8 is 1e-8. So 1e-7.5 is 3.16e-8. So x ≈ 1.414 * 3.16e-8 → 4.47e-8.

Taking log(4.47e-8): log(4.47) is about 0.65, so log(4.47e-8)= 0.65 -8 = -7.35. Therefore, pD is 7.35, which is option I.

So I think that's correct.

To determine the pD of pure D₂O, we start by recognizing that pD is defined as -log[D₃O⁺], analogous to pH. Pure D₂O undergoes autoionization according to the reaction:

\[
2 \, \text{D}_2\text{O} \leftrightharpoons \text{D}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{OD}^-
\]

The ion product \( K \) for this reaction is given as \( K = [\text{D}_3\text{O}^+][\text{OD}^-] = 2 \times 10^{-15} \). Since the concentrations of \(\text{D}_3\text{O}^+\) and \(\text{OD}^-\) are equal in pure D₂O, let \([\text{D}_3\text{O}^+] = x\). Then:

\[
K = x^2 \implies x = \sqrt{K} = \sqrt{2 \times 10^{-15}}
\]

Calculating further:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{10^{-15}} \approx 1.414 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-8} \approx 4.47 \times 10^{-8}
\]

Thus, \([\text{D}_3\text{O}^+] \approx 4.47 \times 10^{-8}\). The pD is then:

\[
\text{pD} = -\log[\text{D}_3\text{O}^+] = -\log(4.47 \times 10^{-8})
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
\log(4.47 \times 10^{-8}) = \log(4.47) + \log(10^{-8}) \approx 0.65 - 8 = -7.35
\]

Therefore:

\[
\text{pD} = 7.35
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **I: 7.35**.
