Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about a gas in a piston. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem states that there's a vessel with a frictionless piston containing 1 cubic foot of gas at 200 psia. The piston is held in place by an external force. Then, we have two scenarios to consider for the work done.

Part a) says the external force is released gradually until the volume is doubled, and PV remains a constant. Hmm, PV constant sounds like a specific process. Wait, when PV is constant, that usually means it's a hyperbolic process, right? Like, maybe an isothermal process isn't this because PV=mRT, but if T isn't constant, I'm not sure. But wait, I remember that for an isothermal process, PV is constant only if temperature is constant. Wait, no, wait, PV = nRT. Oh wait, if PV is a constant, then since n and R are constants, T must be varying in a way that nRT is constant. Wait, that's not necessarily isothermal. Wait, maybe it's another process. Oh wait, maybe it's a process where pressure and volume change such that their product is always the same. So let's think: for a process where P1V1 = P2V2, and that's the condition for part a.

So for part a, the work done during expansion when PV is constant. The formula for work done in such a process is... I think it's W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1) when it's isothermal, but wait, that's only if temperature is constant. But in this case, PV is constant, so maybe it's a different formula.

Wait, no, wait. PV is constant for the entire process. So, P = C/V, where C is a constant. So the work done W is the integral of P dV from V1 to V2.

So P = C/V, so W = ∫ (C/V) dV from V1 to V2.

Which would be C ln(V2/V1). But what is C? Since initially, P1 V1 = C. So C = P1 V1.

So W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but that's the same as the isothermal case. Oh, okay, because if PV is constant, then it's the same as the isothermal process. So in that case, the work done is P1 V1 ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but wait, I thought isothermal processes have PV=mRT, so if T is constant, then PV is constant. So yes, I think that's correct.

So, for part a, initial volume V1 is 1 ft³, final V2 is 2 ft³. P1 is 200 psia. So plugging in:

W = 200 psia * 1 ft³ * ln(2/1) = 200 * ln(2) ft·lb_f.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Because 1 ft³ * 1 psi is 144 in-lb, but wait, since 1 ft = 12 inches, 1 ft³ is 12³ = 1728 in³, and 1 psi is 1 lb/in². So 1 ft³ * 1 psi = 1728 in³ * 1 lb/in² * (1 ft² / 144 in²) * (1 lb·ft / 12 in·lb). Hmm, maybe it's better to convert the units properly.

Wait, wait, let's think: 1 psi is 1 lb per square inch. So 1 ft² is 144 in². So 1 psi * 1 ft² = 144 lb·ft⁻² * 1 ft² = 144 lb. Wait, no, no. Wait, pressure is force per area. So 1 psi is 1 lb/in². So 1 psi over 1 ft² is (1 lb/in²) * (144 in²/ft²) ) = 144 lb/ft². Hmm, but that's pressure. So when we calculate work, the integral is P dV, which has units of (force/area) * volume. Volume in ft³, so P in lb/ft², since 1 psi = 144 lb/ft²? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Wait, 1 psi is 1 lb per square inch. 1 ft is 12 inches, so 1 ft² is 144 in². So 1 psi is 1 lb/(in²) = 1 lb/( (1/12 ft)² ) = 1 lb/(1/144 ft²) ) = 144 lb/ft². So 1 psi equals 144 lb/ft².

So if P is 200 psia, that's 200 * 144 lb/ft² = 28,800 lb/ft².

But wait, when calculating work, which is force times distance. So in the formula W = P_ext * ΔV, but when the process is quasi-static, P is varying.

Wait, in the case where P = C/V, then P is in lb/ft², V is in ft³, so P*V is (lb/ft²) * ft³ = lb*ft, which is foot-pounds (ft·lb_f). So the units should work out.

So for part a, W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1) = 200 psi * 1 ft³ * ln(2).

But wait, since 1 psi*ft³ equals 144 lb·ft (because 1 psi = 144 lb/ft², so 1 psi*ft³ = 144 lb/ft² * ft³ = 144 lb·ft). Hmm, wait, let me think again.

Wait, 1 ft³ is 1 ft * 1 ft * 1 ft. Pressure is 200 lb/in². So to multiply P (lb/in²) by V (in³), you get lb·in²/in² * in³? No, wait, let me clarify: 1 psi is 1 lb/in². 1 ft³ is 1728 in³.

So 200 psi * 1 ft³ = 200 * 1728 (lb/in²) * in³ = 200 * 1728 lb·in.

But 1 ft·lb is 12 in·lb. So 200 * 1728 lb·in = 200 * 1728 / 12 ft·lb = 200 * 144 = 28,800 ft·lb.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 in is 1/12 ft, so 1 in³ is (1/12)^3 ft³ = 1/1728 ft³. So 1 ft³ is 1728 in³.

So, 200 psi is 200 lb/in². So 200 lb/in² * 1 ft³ = 200 lb/in² * 1728 in³.

Wait, lb/in² * in³ = lb·in. So 200 * 1728 lb·in.

But 1 ft·lb is 12 in·lb. So to convert lb·in to ft·lb, divide by 12.

So 200 * 1728 / 12 = 200 * 144 = 28,800 ft·lb.

Wait, but wait, that's just P1 V1 without considering the ln(2). So P1 V1 is 200*144 lb·ft²? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the work in part a. So W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1). P1 is 200 psi, V1 is 1 ft³.

But wait, 1 psi*ft³ is 12 in·lb? No, wait, 1 psi is 1 lb/in², and 1 ft is 12 inches, so 1 ft² is 144 in². So 1 psi = 144 lb/ft². So 1 psi * 1 ft³ = 144 lb·ft.

So 200 psi * 1 ft³ = 200 * 144 lb·ft = 28,800 lb·ft.

Then, multiply by ln(2) which is approximately 0.6931.

So W = 28,800 * 0.6931 ≈ 20,000 ft·lb_f.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 20,000 as the first part. Hmm. Wait, the options are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 19,930, 14,400

B:10,000;7,000

C:17,500;12,250

H:20,000;15,000

I:19,500;14,625

So my calculation for part a is about 20,000. So part a's answer would be around 20,000. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me redo the calculation. P1 is 200 psia, V1 is 1 ft³.

Work done W = P1 * V1 * ln(V2/V1).

But wait, in the units, P is in psi, V in ft³. So 200 psi * 1 ft³ = 200 * 144 lb·ft (because 1 psi·ft³ is 144 lb·ft). So that's 28,800 lb·ft.

Then multiply by ln(2) ≈ 0.6931: 28,800 * 0.6931 ≈ 20,000 lb·ft.

So part a is approx 20,000. Now, looking at the options, option H has part a as 20,000. So part a) is H's first value.

But let me think again: wait, the process is PV = constant. So in that case, the work done is indeed P1 V1 ln(V2/V1), but is that correct? Because in an isothermal process, the work is nRT ln(V2/V1), and since PV = nRT, so it's the same as P1 V1 ln(V2/V1). So yes, that's correct.

So part a is 20,000 ft·lb_f.

Now, part b: If the external force is released suddenly to half its initial value. Hmm, what does that mean? So initially, the piston is held by an external force. Releasing it suddenly to half its initial value—so maybe the pressure drops suddenly, but then the system equilibrates. Since the piston is frictionless, I think it's a free expansion or something else.

Wait, when the external force is suddenly released, the pressure drops. But how? Let me think. The initial pressure is 200 psia. The external force is what's keeping the piston in place. If the force is suddenly halved, the pressure it can exert is halved. So the external pressure becomes P_external = P_initial / 2 = 100 psia.

So the system expands against this lower external pressure until it comes to equilibrium. So the work done would be P_external multiplied by the change in volume.

Wait, but how much does the volume change? Since the process is against a constant external pressure, the work done is P_ext * (V2 - V1).

But wait, when the external force is released suddenly, perhaps the process is irreversible. So the gas expands until its internal pressure equals the external pressure. So initial pressure is 200 psia, external after release is 100 psia. So the gas expands, doing work on the surroundings.

Assuming it's an ideal gas, but perhaps we can model it as a simple expansion against a constant external pressure.

So the initial volume is V1=1 ft³, and after expansion, the volume is V2.

What's the final pressure? Since the external pressure is 100 psia, and the system stops when P2 = P_ext = 100 psia.

Wait, but the process is such that the gas expands, so the work done is P_ext * (V2 - V1).

But we need to find V2.

But how? Because we don't know how the pressure and volume relate during this expansion. Since the external pressure is suddenly lowered, and the piston moves until equilibrium, perhaps we can assume that the expansion is such that the internal pressure drops to 100 psia at the new volume V2. So using the ideal gas law, assuming it's isothermal? Or adiabatic? Or perhaps a different process.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any heat transfer, so it's probably adiabatic? Or maybe it's a rapid expansion where temperature doesn't have time to change, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's isothermal, but that's only if heat is exchanged. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says part b) is when the external force is released suddenly to half its initial value. So the external pressure becomes 100 psia. The gas expands until its pressure equals 100 psia. So assuming ideal gas behavior and that the temperature remains constant (isothermal), then PV = nRT. So since T is constant, P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So P1 = 200 psia, V1=1 ft³, P2=100 psia. So V2 = (P1 / P2) * V1 = (200 / 100) * 1 = 2 ft³.

So V2 is 2 ft³, same as part a. But the process is different. So the work done is P_ext * (V2 - V1) = 100 psia * (2 - 1) ft³.

Again, converting units. 100 psia * 1 ft³ = 100 * 144 lb·ft = 14,400 ft·lb_f.

Wait, but isn't that the work done in part b? So part b's work is 14,400 ft·lb_f.

Looking at the options, option A has part a as 19,930, which is close to 20,000 but a bit less. Option H has part a as 20,000 and part b as 15,000. But our calculation for part b is 14,400, which matches option A's part b.

Wait, no, option A's part a is 19,930 and part b is 14,400. Our part a is 20,000, and part b is 14,400. So the closest option would be option I, but wait, option I has part a as 19,500 and part b as 14,625. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, let me recalculate part a's work. The formula is W = P1 V1 ln(V2/V1). P1 is 200 psia, V1 is 1 ft³.

So 200 psia * 1 ft³ = 200 * 144 lb·ft = 28,800 lb·ft. Then multiply by ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

28,800 * 0.6931 ≈ let's calculate: 28,800 * 0.6 = 17,280; 28,800 * 0.0931 ≈ 28,800 * 0.09 = 2,592; 28,800 * 0.0031 ≈ 89.28. So total approx 17,280 + 2,592 = 19,872 + 89.28 ≈ 19,961.28 ft·lb_f.

Ah, I see, so more accurately, it's about 19,930, which matches option A's first value of 19,930.

So part a) is 19,930 ft·lb_f.

But wait, earlier I thought it was 20,000, but more precise calculation gives 19,930. So that's probably due to the exact value of ln(2). Let me compute 200 * 144 * ln(2).

200 * 144 = 28,800. ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

28,800 * 0.69314718056 = let's calculate:

28,800 * 0.6 = 17,280.

28,800 * 0.09314718056 ≈ let's compute 28,800 * 0.09 = 2,592.

28,800 * 0.00314718056 ≈ 28,800 * 0.003 = 86.4, and 28,800 * 0.00014718 ≈ ~4.246.

So 2,592 + 86.4 = 2,678.4 + 4.246 ≈ 2,682.646.

So total work: 17,280 + 2,682.646 ≈ 19,962.646 ft·lb_f, which is about 19,963, which the option A rounds to 19,930. Hmm, perhaps the approximation for ln(2) is considered as 0.693 exactly, giving 28,800 * 0.693 = 19,939.2, which rounds to 19,940, but the option says 19,930. Maybe a slight difference in calculation.

Now, for part b, as I calculated earlier, the work is P_ext * (V2 - V1) = 100 psia * 1 ft³.

100 psia is 100 * 144 lb/ft². So 100 * 144 = 14,400 lb/ft².

Work is 14,400 lb/ft² * 1 ft³ = 14,400 ft·lb_f.

So part b) is 14,400 ft·lb_f.

Looking at the options, option A has a) 19,930 and b)14,400. So that matches.

Wait, but in the problem, part a) is when PV is always constant, implying a certain process, and part b) is a sudden release leading to expansion against a constant external pressure. So the calculation aligns with option A.

But wait, earlier I thought part a was 20,000, but the precise calculation gives 19,930. So in the options, option A's part a is 19,930 and part b is 14,400, which matches our findings.

So the correct answer would be option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the two scenarios separately:

### Part (a): Work Done When PV is Constant
When \( PV \) is constant, the process is hyperbolic, and the work done is given by:

\[
W = P_1 V_1 \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( P_1 = 200 \, \text{psia} \),
- \( V_1 = 1 \, \text{ft}^3 \),
- \( V_2 = 2 \, \text{
