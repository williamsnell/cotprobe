Okay, so I have this bond question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through what I know about bonds and how to calculate their price.

Alright, the question states: An 8% bond with 18 years to maturity has a yield of 9%. What is the price of this bond? The options are given from A to J.

First, I remember that bonds are priced based on the present value of their future cash flows. The main components I need are the coupon rate, the yield (or market interest rate), and the time to maturity.

The bond has an 8% coupon rate. That means each year, the bondholder receives 8% of the face value as interest. Since bonds are usually issued with a face value (par value) of, say, $100, the annual coupon payment would be 8% of $100, which is $8 per year.

The bond has 18 years until maturity, so it's a long-term bond. The yield to maturity (YTM) is given as 9%. YTM is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of all future cash flows from the bond.

The formula for the price of a bond is the sum of the present value of each coupon payment plus the present value of the face value paid at maturity. The formula can be written as:

Price = (C / (1 + r)^1) + (C / (1 + r)^2) + ... + (C / (1 + r)^n) + (F / (1 + r)^n)

Where:
- C is the annual coupon payment.
- r is the yield to maturity (YTM), or the discount rate.
- F is the face value.
- n is the number of years.

Alternatively, since this is an ordinary annuity (coupons paid at the end of each period), I can use the present value of an annuity formula for the coupon payments and the present value formula for the face value.

So, simplifying, the bond price (P) can be calculated as:

P = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r + F / (1 + r)^n

Plugging in the numbers:
- C is 8% of the face value. Assuming face value is $100, C = $8.
- r is 9%, so 0.09.
- n is 18 years.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate the present value of the annuity (the coupon payments):

PV of coupons = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r
= 8 * [1 - (1.09)^-18] / 0.09

Hmm, I need to compute (1.09)^-18. Wait, that's the same as 1/(1.09)^18. I can calculate 1.09^18 first.

Calculating 1.09^18 might be tricky without a calculator, but I remember that 1.09^18 is approximately e^(0.09*18) using the rule of 72 or continuous compounding as an approximation, but wait, that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as a value I can recall. Alternatively, maybe I can remember the present value factor for 9% over 18 years, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The present value factor for an annuity can be looked up, but since I'm doing it manually, perhaps I can approximate.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute this step by step, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that the present value of a 9% perpetuity is C/r, but that's for an infinite period, which isn't the case here.

Wait, no, for an 18-year period, the present value factor is [1 - (1 + 0.09)^-18]/0.09.

Let me compute (1.09)^18. Let's see. 1.09^1 is 1.09. 1.09^2 is 1.1881. 1.09^3 is about 1.295. Let me try to compute 1.09^18. Alternatively, perhaps I know that 1.09^10 is roughly 2.367. Then, 1.09^18 = 1.09^10 * 1.09^8.

Wait, 1.09^8: let's compute it. 1.09^2 is 1.1881. 1.1881^2 is about 1.414. Then 1.414 * 1.1881 ≈ 1.68 (since 1.414 * 1.1881 ≈ 1.68). Wait, but that's 1.09^4 is 1.414? Wait, no, wait, 1.09^1=1.09, 1.09^2=1.1881, 1.09^3= approx 1.295, 1.09^4≈1.41.

Wait, 1.09^4 is (1.09^2)^2 = (1.1881)^2 ≈ 1.414. Then 1.09^8 is (1.414)^2 ≈ 2.0. Then 1.09^10 is 1.09^8 * 1.09^2 ≈ 2.0 * 1.1881 ≈ 2.376. Then 1.09^18 is 1.09^10 * 1.09^8 ≈ 2.376 * 2.0 ≈ 4.752.

Wait, but that can't be right because 1.09^18 is around 5.6 something. Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should use the rule of 72 to estimate. The rule says that the doubling time is 72 / rate. So at 9%, doubling time is 8 years. So in 18 years, it would double approximately 2.25 times (since 18/8 = 2.25). So 1.09^18 ≈ 2.25^2 = 5.06? Hmm, that seems more plausible. So 1.09^18 ≈ 5.06, so 1/(1.09)^18 ≈ 0.1978.

So back to the present value of the annuity:

[1 - (1.09)^-18]/0.09 = [1 - 0.1978]/0.09 ≈ (0.8022)/0.09 ≈ 8.913.

So the present value of the coupons is 8 * 8.913 ≈ 71.30.

Now, the present value of the face value ($100), which is F/(1 + r)^n = 100 / (1.09)^18. As we approximated earlier, 1/(1.09)^18 ≈ 0.1978. So 100 * 0.1978 ≈ 19.78.

Adding both parts together: 71.30 + 19.78 ≈ 91.08.

Looking at the options, option A is 91.17, which is very close to my calculation of approximately 91.08. So the correct answer should be A: 91.17.

Wait, but let me double-check my approximations because I might have made a mistake in estimating (1.09)^18. If I calculate it more accurately, perhaps I can get a more precise value.

Alternatively, using logarithms to compute (1.09)^18.

The natural logarithm of 1.09 is approximately 0.08617. Multiply by 18: 0.08617 * 18 ≈ 1.551.

Exponentiating e^1.551 ≈ 4.72. So 1.09^18 ≈ e^(1.551) ≈ 4.72. So 1/(1.09)^18 ≈ 1/4.72 ≈ 0.2118.

Wait, that's different from my earlier approximation of 0.1978. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a better way. Wait, maybe I can use the present value factor tables or a financial calculator approach.

Wait, another approach: The present value factor for 9% over 18 years is 1/(1.09)^18.

I recall that (1.09)^18 is approximately 5.60. Because using more precise calculations, 1.09^18 is about 5.60. So 1/5.60 ≈ 0.1786.

Wait, that contradicts the earlier approach. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that without a calculator, precise calculation is difficult, but the correct method will lead to the answer being around 91.17, which is option A. Let me go with that.

To determine the price of the bond, we use the formula for the price of a bond, which is the sum of the present value of its future cash flows. The bond has a coupon rate of 8%, a yield to maturity (YTM) of 9%, and 18 years to maturity. Assuming a face value of $100, the annual coupon payment is $8.

The formula for the bond price is:

\[
P = \frac{C}{r} \left[1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}\right] + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Where:
- \(C = 8\) (annual coupon payment),
- \(r = 0.09\) (YTM),
- \(F = 100\) (face value),
- \(n = 18\) (years to maturity).

### Step 1: Present Value of the Coupon Payments
The present value of the coupon payments is calculated using the present value of an annuity formula:

\[
\text{PV of coupons} = C \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{PV of coupons} = 8 \cdot \frac{1 - (1.09)^{-18}}{0.09}
\]

To compute \((1.09)^{-18}\), we approximate it as \(1 / (1.09)^{18}\). Using approximations, \((1.09)^{18} \approx 5.60\), so:

\[
(1.09)^{-18} \approx \frac{1}{5.60} \approx 0.1786
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{PV of coupons} = 8 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.1786}{0.09} = 8 \cdot \frac{0.8214}{0.09} \approx 8 \cdot 9.126 \approx 73.01
\]

### Step 2: Present Value of the Face Value
The present value of the face value is:

\[
\text{PV of face value} = \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{PV of face value} = \frac{100}{(1.09)^{18}} \approx 100 \cdot 0.1786 \approx 17.86
\]

### Step 3: Total Bond Price
Adding the present value of the coupon payments and the face value:

\[
P = \text{PV of coupons} + \text{PV of face value} \approx 73.01 + 17.86 \approx 90.87
\]

This value is very close to the option \(91.17\), which likely uses slightly more precise calculations for \((1.09)^{-18}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: 91.17**
