Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with a buyer and seller situation. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that a buyer contracted to buy a used car for $10,000. On the day of the sale, the buyer offered a $10,000 cashier's check, but the seller refused to take it and didn't deliver the car. Now, the buyer is suing for breach of contract. I need to figure out what remedy the buyer is entitled to.

Hmm, I remember that when a contract is breached, the non-breaching party can seek various remedies. The main ones are specific performance, damages (like the difference between market and contract price), or possibly rescission. 

Specific performance is when the court orders the breaching party to perform the contract. But I think that's more common in cases involving unique items, like real estate or maybe rare goods. Since this is a used car, are all used cars considered unique? Or maybe if it's a standard model, the buyer could just buy another one. So specific performance (option A) might not be the first choice, unless the car is particularly unique.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify anything special about the car. It's just a used car, so maybe the buyer can't get specific performance. So A might not be the right answer.

Let me think about the damages options. The buyer could be entitled to the difference between the market price and the contract price. So if the market price goes up, the buyer would have to pay more elsewhere, so they could get the difference as damages. That's option F.

Alternatively, if the market price is lower, the seller might be better off. But I think the measure is typically calculated as the difference at the time and place of the breach. So F seems like a possible correct answer.

What about the other options? Option D says recovery of the contract price. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the buyer hasn't paid yet; the seller refused the payment. So the buyer isn't trying to get the contract price back. They might be trying to get damages because they didn't get the car. So D might not be right.

Option B is about the cost of the cashier's check. I don't think that's a standard remedy. The buyer would tender payment, and if the seller refuses, the buyer might not have to pay anything, but I don't see how the cost of the check is a recoverable expense here. It's more about the inconvenience or direct costs, but I'm not sure if that's part of the standard remedies.

Option C is recovery of the market price. That would mean the buyer pays the market price, but I think the usual measure is the difference between market and contract. So maybe not C.

Option E is about transportation costs. That sounds like incidental damages, maybe under UCC ยง2-710. But for that, the seller would have to be a merchant, and the buyer would have to show those costs were reasonably incurred. The question doesn't mention anything about transportation, so E might not be the right choice here.

Option G is emotional distress. Contract law generally doesn't allow for damages for emotional distress unless it's a contract where that's the main purpose, like a wedding photographer or something. Buying a car isn't that kind of contract, so G is probably out.

Option H is punitive damages. Punitive damages are usually for torts, not breach of contract, unless maybe in cases of fraud or something. There's no indication of fraud here, just a breach, so H is unlikely.

Option I is an injunction to prevent selling to someone else. That's a specific performance kind of remedy, but again, for a used car, courts might not grant that unless it's unique. Plus, the question is about what the buyer is entitled to, not what they might possibly get if they can prove the car is unique.

So, putting it together: the buyer is entitled to damages. The measure would be the difference between the market price (at the time of breach) and the contract price. So that's option F.

Wait, but another thought: when the buyer tenders the payment and the seller refuses, does that mean the seller is in breach, making the buyer a creditor. So the buyer can sue for the price? Or is it that the buyer can choose between specific performance or damages.

Wait, no, because the buyer hasn't paid yet. The seller breached by not delivering. So the buyer is the aggrieved party and can choose remedies. If the goods are not unique, the usual remedy is the difference between market and contract price. So yes, F is correct.

Another angle: Under the UCC, when a buyer breaches, the seller can recover the difference between market and contract. But here, the seller breached, so the buyer's remedy is the same. So the buyer can get the difference if the market price is higher. Or if lower, maybe the seller would have to pay the buyer, but that's a different scenario.

So the answer should be F.

The buyer contracted to purchase a used car for $10,000, but the seller refused to accept the $10,000 cashier's check and failed to deliver the car. The buyer is now suing for breach of contract. To determine the appropriate remedy, we analyze the options:

- **Option A (Specific performance):** Specific performance is typically granted for unique items, such as real estate or rare goods. Since the car is not described as unique, specific performance is unlikely.

- **Option B (Recovery of the cost of the cashier's check):** This is not a standard remedy for breach of contract. The cost of the check is not directly relevant to the breach.

- **Option C (Recovery of the market price of the car):** This is not the standard measure of damages. The buyer would not recover the full market price but rather the difference between the market price and the contract price.

- **Option D (Recovery of the contract price of the car):** The buyer has not yet paid the contract price, so this option does not apply.

- **Option E (Reimbursement for transportation costs):** The question does not mention transportation costs, and these would qualify as incidental damages only if the seller were a merchant and the costs were reasonably incurred.

- **Option F (Damages measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price):** This is the standard remedy under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for breach of a sales contract. If the market price of the car is higher than the contract price at the time of breach, the buyer can recover the difference.

- **Option G (Damages for emotional distress):** Contract law does not typically allow damages for emotional distress unless the contract involves services where emotional distress is a primary concern, which is not the case here.

- **Option H (Punitive damages):** Punitive damages are generally awarded in cases of fraud or egregious conduct, which are not indicated here.

- **Option I (Injunction to prevent the seller from selling the car to someone else):** This is a form of specific performance, which is unlikely for a standard used car.

The most appropriate remedy is **Option F**, as the buyer is entitled to damages measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price of the car at the time of the breach.

Answer: F
