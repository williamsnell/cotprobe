Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's asking. The question is to find the sum of all positive integers less than 196 and relatively prime to 98. The options are A through J, each with a different number. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to be relatively prime. Oh right, two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. So, they have no common factors other than 1. Got it.

So the task is to find all numbers less than 196 that are coprime with 98, and then add them all up. But doing this one by one would take forever, so I need a smarter way.

Wait, I remember something about Euler's totient function, phi(n), which gives the count of numbers less than n that are coprime to n. But wait, here the limit is 196, which is double of 98. So maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use.

Wait, let's factorize 98 first. 98 is 2 × 49, which is 2 × 7². So the prime factors are 2 and 7. So any number that doesn't have 2 or 7 as factors will be coprime with 98.

Now, the problem is to sum all positive integers less than 196 that are coprime to 98. So numbers from 1 to 195, but only those not divisible by 2 or 7.

Hmm, but how to find that sum efficiently. I think there's a formula for the sum of numbers coprime to n up to some multiple of n. Wait, but 196 is 2 × 98, so perhaps I can find the sum for one period (up to 98) and then double it, but wait, no, because 196 is 2×98, but we're going up to 195, which is 196-1, so maybe it's two full periods.

Wait, let me think again. The numbers less than 196 can be thought of as two blocks of 98 numbers each: 1-98 and 99-196 (but since 196 is excluded, it's 99-195). So each block has 98 numbers.

Wait, but wait, 98 times 2 is 196. So 1-98 is the first block, and 99-196 is the second. But since we're going up to 195, the second block is 99-195, which is 97 numbers. Wait, no, 195 is 98*2 -1, so 99-195 is 97 numbers? Wait, 195-99+1 = 97, yes. So maybe that approach complicates things.

Alternatively, since 196 is 2×98, perhaps each block of 98 numbers contributes a similar sum, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can find the sum from 1 to 98, then see if the next 98 (up to 196) can be used, but adjusted since we stop at 195, which is 196-1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the sum for one period (1-98) and then find how many such periods are in 1-195, and then adjust. Or maybe think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, I remember that the sum of numbers coprime to n less than n is (n * phi(n))/2. Wait, is that correct? Because for each number k that's coprime to n, n -k is also coprime, and their sum is n. So the number of such pairs is phi(n)/2, and each pair sums to n. So the total sum would be (phi(n) * n)/2. That makes sense.

So for n=98, the sum of numbers less than 98 and coprime to 98 would be (98 * phi(98)) / 2. Then, since we're going up to 196, but excluding 196, perhaps I can compute it for two blocks.

Wait, let's compute phi(98) first. Since 98=2×7², phi(98) = 98 × (1 - 1/2) × (1 - 1/7) = 98 × 1/2 × 6/7 = 49 × 6/7 = 42. So phi(98)=42.

So the sum from 1 to 97 (since 98 is included in 98, but we're considering numbers less than 98, which is up to 97) of numbers coprime to 98 is (98 × 42)/2 = 98 × 21 = 2058. Wait, because 98 × 21 is 2058. So that's the sum from 1 to 97 of coprimes.

But wait, 98 is not included in the sum because we're considering numbers less than 98. So that sum is correct for 1-97.

Now, the next block would be from 99 to 196, but we're stopping at 195. So that's 99-195, which is 97 numbers again. Wait, 195-99+1 = 97 numbers. So each block has 98 numbers, but the second block is 99-196, which is 98 numbers, but we're excluding 196, so it's 97.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the sum for 99-196, which would be the same as 1-98, but each number is 98 higher. So the sum would be sum_{k=1}^{98} (k + 98) = sum_{k=1}^{98} k + 98 × 98.

The sum from 1 to 98 is (98 × 99)/2 = 4851. Adding 98 ×98 = 9604, so 4851 + 9604 = 14455. But wait, that's the sum of 99 to 196, but we're only going up to 195, so we need to subtract 196 from this sum. So 14455 - 196 = 14259.

Wait, but wait, the numbers from 99 to 195 are 97 numbers. Wait, but when we compute the sum as 99-196, which is 98 numbers, and we're excluding 196, which is the 98th number in that block. So our sum from 99-195 is sum(99-196) - 196.

So the sum from 99-195 is 14259.

But wait, that's the sum of all numbers from 99-195. But we only want those numbers that are coprime with 98. So I can't just add the two sums (from 1-97 and 99-195) directly because not all numbers in 99-195 are coprime with 98. So that approach won't work. Hmm, I need another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the numbers coprime to 98 in each block of 98 numbers are the same, just offset by 98. So for each number k in 1-98 that's coprime to 98, the number k + 98 will also be coprime to 98. Because adding 98 won't introduce any new common factors with 98, since 98 is a multiple of 2 and 7. So if k is coprime to 98, then k + 98 is also coprime to 98, provided that k + 98 is less than 196.

So for each number in the first block (1-98) that's coprime to 98, there's a corresponding number in the second block (99-196) that's also coprime. But since we're stopping at 195, which is 196-1, the last number in the second block is 195, which is 98 + 97. So 97 is in the first block, and 97 +98=195.

So the sum of coprimes in the second block (99-195) would be sum_{k=1}^{98} (k +98) where k is coprime to 98. But wait, that's only for k that are coprime to 98. So the sum would be sum(k) + 98 * phi(98). Because there are phi(98) numbers in each block that are coprime, each contributing 98.

So sum in the second block would be sum_first_block + 98 * phi(98). But wait, the sum_first_block is 2058, and 98 * 42 is 4116. So 2058 + 4116 = 6174.

Wait, but wait, the second block is from 99 to 196, which includes 98 numbers. But we're only going up to 195, so we need to subtract 196 if it's included. But 196 is a multiple of 98, so it's not coprime with 98. So in the second block, the numbers are 99 to 196, which includes 98 numbers. But 196 is not coprime, so when we calculated the sum as 6174, that includes 196? Or not?

Wait, no. Because in the second block, the coprime numbers are 99 to 196, but only those coprime to 98. Since 196 is not coprime, it's excluded. So the sum from 99 to 195 (excluding 196) would include all the coprimes from 99 to 195, which are the same as in the first block, but each shifted by 98. So the sum would be 2058 (sum of first block) + 98 * 42 (since there are 42 numbers in each block that are coprime). So 2058 + 4116 = 6174.

Wait, but wait, 42 numbers in each block, each contributing an extra 98. So yes, the second block contributes 6174. But what about the first block? The sum from 1 to 97 (since 98 is excluded as we're considering numbers less than 98) is 2058.

So the total sum would be 2058 (first block) + 6174 (second block) = 8232.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because 2058 is the sum from 1-97, and 6174 is from 99-195. But wait, 99-195 includes 97 numbers, but in the first block, we have 42 numbers, and the second block also 42 numbers. So 42 +42=84 numbers in total.

Wait, but the numbers from 1-97 have 42 coprimes, and 99-195 also have 42 coprimes, so total 84 numbers. The sum would be 2058 + 6174 = 8232. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 8232. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the sum for the first block.

Phi(98) is 42. The sum is (98 * 42)/2 = 98*21=2058. Correct.

Then, the second block is each of those 42 numbers plus 98. So the sum is 2058 + 42*98 = 2058 + 4116=6174.

Then total sum is 2058 +6174= 8232. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be C:8232.

To solve the problem of finding the sum of all positive integers less than 196 and relatively prime to 98, we proceed as follows:

1. **Understand the problem**: Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. We need to sum all integers from 1 to 195 that are coprime with 98.

2. **Factorize 98**: \( 98 = 2 \times 7^2 \). Therefore, any number coprime to 98 must not be divisible by 2 or 7.

3. **Euler's Totient Function**: The function \( \phi(n) \) gives the count of numbers less than \( n \) that are coprime to \( n \). For \( n = 98 \):
   \[
   \phi(98) = 98 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{7}\right) = 98 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{6}{7} = 42.
   \]
   Thus, there are 42 numbers less than 98 that are coprime to 98.

4. **Sum of coprimes in one block (1 to 98)**: The sum of numbers coprime to 98 from 1 to 97 can be calculated using the formula for the sum of coprimes:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n \cdot \phi(n)}{2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( n = 98 \) and \( \phi(98) = 42 \):
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{98 \cdot 42}{2} = 2058.
   \]

5. **Second block (99 to 195)**: The numbers in the second block (99 to 195) that are coprime to 98 are the same as those in the first block, but each is shifted by 98. The sum of these numbers is:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \text{Sum of first block} + 98 \cdot \phi(98).
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 2058 + 98 \cdot 42 = 2058 + 4116 = 6174.
   \]

6. **Total sum**: The total sum of all numbers less than 196 and coprime to 98 is the sum of the two blocks:
   \[
   \text{Total Sum} = 2058 + 6174 = 8232.
   \]

Thus, the sum of all positive integers less than 196 and relatively prime to 98 is **8232**.
