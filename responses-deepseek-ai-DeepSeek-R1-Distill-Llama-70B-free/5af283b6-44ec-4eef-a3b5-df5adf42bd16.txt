Question:

A 73-year-old widower owned a 40-acre farm. The widower had two children, a son and a daughter. After the daughter married, she and her husband lived on the farm in a small cottage. From 1985 to 1989, the daughter and the husband helped the widower farm and maintain the property. The widower, whose health was deteriorating, needed the services of the daughter and her husband in order to continue to live on the farm. In December 1989, the daughter told the widower that she and her husband were planning to move out of state. Worried that he could not survive without their help, the widower said to the daughter, "Please don't ever leav. e. I'm totally dependent on you and your husband. If you stay and continue to care for me and help with the farming, the farm will be yours when I die. " The daughter turned down a job offer in a neighboring state and decided to do as the widower requested. For nine years, the daughter cared for her father while her husband handled most of the farming operations. In 1998, the widower died intestate with the daughter and the son as his only surviving heirs. The period required to acquire title by adverse possession in the jurisdiction is seven years. In an appropriate action to determine the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son, respectively, in the farm, the result will depend upon the application of the principles of and exceptions to the

Options:

A: doctrine of equitable conversion.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the scenario is about a widower who owns a 40-acre farm. He has two children, a son and a daughter. The daughter and her husband lived on the farm and helped him from 1985 to 1989. The widower's health was getting worse, and he needed their help to stay on the farm. In December 1989, the daughter said she and her husband were planning to move out of state. The widower then told her, "Please don't leave. I'm totally dependent on you and your husband. If you stay and continue to care for me and help with farming, the farm will be yours when I die." The daughter turned down a job offer and stayed. For nine years, she cared for her father, and her husband handled the farming. In 1998, the widower died without a will, so the daughter and son are his heirs.

The question is about determining their rights in the farm. The options involve various legal doctrines. The key here is to figure out which doctrine applies.

I remember that when someone makes a promise in exchange for services and dies without a will, it might relate to the Statute of Frauds. The Statute of Frauds requires certain agreements, like those involving land, to be in writing to be enforceable. If the agreement isn't in writing, it might not hold up, unless an exception applies.

Wait, but the daughter and her husband acted on the promise. They stayed for nine years. Maybe this falls under the exception where partial performance can take the agreement out of the Statute of Frauds. The exception is usually for specific performances, like in real estate transactions where the buyer has made significant improvements or taken possession.

So the agreement here is oral, but the daughter relied on it and performed her part. Without a written will, the son would normally inherit half the farm as an heir. But the daughter might argue that she has a claim based on the oral promise, supported by her performance.

Another thought: could this be about adverse possession? The period required is seven years, and she stayed for nine. But adverse possession requires hostile, continuous use without the owner's permission. Here, the daughter was living there with permission, so adverse possession doesn't apply. So option H is probably not the right answer.

Looking at the options, F is the Statute of Frauds, and H is adverse possession. So the main issue is whether the oral promise is enforceable. The Statute of Frauds would normally bar it because it's an agreement about land. But the exception for partial performance might save it.

So the case hinges on whether the oral promise, supported by the daughter's performance, is enough to overcome the Statute of Frauds. That would mean the correct doctrine here is the Statute of Frauds, option F.

Wait, but are there other possible doctrines? Like constructive trusts or resulting trusts? A resulting trust comes into play when someone pays for property but the title is in another's name. Not sure that applies here. Constructive trusts are for when someone wrongfully holds property, maybe through fraud. The situation here is more about an oral promise to transfer property upon death.

So yes, the key issue is the enforceability of the oral promise concerning land, which is governed by the Statute of Frauds. Therefore, the answer should be F.

The scenario involves a widower who made an oral promise to his daughter, offering her the farm if she stayed and cared for him. The daughter relied on this promise, turned down a job offer, and stayed for nine years. When the widower died intestate, the question arises about the enforceability of the oral promise in determining the daughter's and son's rights to the farm.

The key legal issue is whether the oral promise is enforceable. The **Statute of Frauds** requires agreements involving land to be in writing to be enforceable. However, an exception applies if there has been partial performance of the agreement. Here, the daughter's reliance on the promise and her performance (caring for her father and helping with the farm for nine years) could satisfy this exception, making the oral promise enforceable despite the lack of a written agreement.

Other doctrines, such as adverse possession, do not apply because the daughter was living on the farm with the widower's permission, not in a hostile or adversarial capacity. Similarly, resulting or constructive trusts are not directly relevant to the enforceability of the oral promise in this context.

Thus, the result depends on the application of the **Statute of Frauds** and its exception for partial performance.

Answer: F
