Okay, so I've got this question about Kohlberg's theory of moral development, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about Kohlberg's stages.

From what I remember, Kohlberg proposed that moral development happens in stages, and these stages are grouped into three main levels: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. Each level has two stages.

The question is about the second stage of the preconventional level. So, the preconventional level is the first level, which typically applies to children. In this level, people don't have a internalized moral perspective; instead, their morality is based on external factors.

In the preconventional level, the first stage is about avoiding punishment and obeying rules because they're told to. The second stage, I think, is more about exchanging favors and understanding that there's a give-and-take in following rules. So, children at this stage might follow rules because they get something in return, like a reward.

Wait, but let me make sure. The first stage of preconventional is called the punishment-obedience orientation. So in stage one, kids obey because they don't want to get punished. Then, stage two is the instrumental-exchange orientation. Here, the idea is that being 'good' means you act in ways that are approved by others and that benefit you. So, if you follow the rules, you get rewards, and that's why you obey.

Looking at the options, the question is why children obey rules in the second stage. The options are A through J. Let me go through them.

Option A: they are taught that rules are unbreakable. That sounds more like the first stage, where rules are seen as absolute, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option B: they enjoy following the rules. I don't think that's a specific reason tied to the stage; it's more about personal preference.

Option C: they are rewarded for following rules. This aligns with the idea of instrumental exchange, where following rules leads to rewards. So this might be the correct answer.

Option D: they feel a personal duty to uphold rules and laws. That sounds more like a conventional level, perhaps stage three or four.

Option E: doing so helps them satisfy their personal needs. Hmm, that's a bit vague. Maybe related, but I'm not sure if it's specific enough.

Option F: they understand fairness and justice. I think that's more the postconventional level, like stage five or six, where people think about abstract concepts.

Option G: doing so helps them avoid punishment. That's the first stage, right? So not the second.

Option H: everyone else is doing it. That feels more like the conventional level, where social norms drive behavior.

Option I: they believe in the inherent goodness of rules. Not sure, but maybe that's more a postconventional or conventional perspective.

Option J: fear societal disapproval. Again, that's more about social norms, perhaps conventional level.

So, based on this, the correct answer should be C: they are rewarded for following rules. Because in stage two of preconventional, it's about the exchange of favors and getting rewards.

The second stage of Kohlberg’s preconventional level is characterized by the instrumental-exchange orientation. At this stage, children obey rules because they understand that following them leads to rewards or benefits. This is distinct from the first stage, where obedience is driven by fear of punishment. Among the given options, the one that aligns with this reasoning is:

C: they are rewarded for following rules.

Answer: C
