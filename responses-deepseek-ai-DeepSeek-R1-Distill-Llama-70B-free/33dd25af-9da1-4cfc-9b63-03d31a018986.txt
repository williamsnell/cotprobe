Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the empirical formula of a compound based on the percentages of its elements. Hmm, I remember that the empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements in a compound. Right, so the steps I think I should follow are: first, convert the percentages to masses, then to moles using the atomic weights, and then find the simplest ratio.

Wait, the problem gives me the percentages as 51.9% carbon, 4.86% hydrogen, and 43.2% bromine. Oh yeah, I should assume a 100g sample because that makes the percentages directly equal to grams. So that would mean 51.9g of C, 4.86g of H, and 43.2g of Br.

Now, I need to convert these masses into moles. I recall the atomic weights: Carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, Hydrogen is around 1.008 g/mol, and Bromine is roughly 79.904 g/mol. So let me calculate each.

For Carbon: 51.9g divided by 12.01 g/mol. Let me do that division. 51.9 / 12 is approximately 4.325. But more accurately, 12.01 times 4 is 48.04, so 51.9-48.04 is 3.86. 3.86 /12.01 is about 0.321. So total moles of C is around 4.321, let's say approximately 4.32 moles.

Hydrogen: 4.86g divided by 1.008 g/mol. So 4.86 / 1.008. Let me see. 1.008 times 4 is 4.032. So 4.86 - 4.032 is 0.828. 0.828 / 1.008 is about 0.821. So total H moles would be roughly 4.82 moles. Wait wait, that can't be right because 4.86 / 1 is almost 5, but 1.008 is just slightly over 1. So 4.86 / 1.008 ≈ 4.821. Yeah, that's about 4.82 moles of H.

Bromine: 43.2g divided by 79.904 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 79.904 is about 80, so 43.2 /80 is 0.54. But more accurately, 79.904 times 0.54 is 43.2, so exactly 0.54 moles of Br.

Now I have the moles: C is approximately 4.32, H is 4.82, Br is 0.54.

The next step is to find the ratio of these moles. To do that, I should divide each by the smallest number of moles, which is 0.54.

So for C: 4.32 /0.54 = 8. So that's 8.

H: 4.82 /0.54 ≈ 8.925... Wait, that's approximately 8.925, which is close to 8.9, but that's not a whole number. Hmm, that's a problem because the ratios should be whole numbers for the empirical formula.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Carbon: 51.9 /12.01. Let me calculate that more precisely. 12.01 times 4 is 48.04. 51.9-48.04 is 3.86. 3.86 divided by 12.01. Let me do 3.86 /12.01. 12.01 *0.3 is 3.603, so 0.3 is 3.603, subtract that from 3.86, gives 0.257. 0.257 /12.01 is about 0.0214. So total is 4.3214 moles. So approximately 4.32.

Hydrogen: 4.86 /1.008. Let's see, 1.008 times 4 is 4.032, subtracting gives 4.86-4.032=0.828. 0.828 divided by 1.008 is 0.821. So 4.821 moles.

Bromine: 43.2 /79.904. 79.904 times 0.54 is exactly 43.189, which is very close to 43.2, so that's approximately 0.54 moles.

Now, the mole ratios. Let me try again.

C: 4.32 / 0.54 = 8.

H:4.82 /0.54 ≈ 8.925. Hmmm. Wait, that's about 8.925, which is approximately 8.925, which is close to 8.93. That's not a whole number, so maybe I should see if these numbers can be multiplied by a factor to get whole numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations. Let me check each mole calculation again.

Wait, perhaps the Hydrogen calculation is off. Let me redo that.

Hydrogen: 4.86 grams divided by 1.008 g/mol.

4.86 /1.008. Let me compute this precisely.

1.008 times 4 is 4.032. 4.86 -4.032 is 0.828.

0.828 divided by 1.008. Let me do that division.

0.828 /1.008 = (828/1000) / (1008/1000) ) = 828 /1008 = let me divide numerator and denominator by 12. 828 ÷12=69, 1008 ÷12=84. So 69/84. Then divide numerator and denominator by 3. 23/28. 23 divided by 28 is approximately 0.8214. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so the ratios are 8 : approx 8.925 : 1.

Wait, that can't be right because the ratio should have whole numbers. So perhaps I should multiply each by a factor that will make them whole numbers.

Wait, 8.925 is close to 8.93, but that's not a whole number. Maybe I should check if the initial mole counts are correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the bromine moles are 0.54, but maybe I should express all as fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can multiply all by 2 to see if that helps.

Wait, let me think again. The moles are approximately:

C: 4.32
H:4.82
Br:0.54

Divide each by 0.54:

C: 4.32 /0.54 = 8

H:4.82 / 0.54 = approximately 8.925

Br: 0.54 /0.54 =1

So the ratio is approximately 8 : 8.925 : 1.

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe I can multiply each by a number to get whole numbers. Let's say I multiply all by 2 to eliminate the decimal in the Br part. Wait, but that might not help much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a common factor that can make the H ratio a whole number. Let's see.

The H ratio is 8.925, which is approximately 8.925. Wait, 8.925 is approximately 8 and 11/12, but that's not a whole number. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me check that again.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations. Let me use exact values.

Carbon: 51.9 g /12.01 g/mol.

Calculating that: 12.01 * 4 =48.04. 51.9 -48.04=3.86. 3.86 /12.01 = let's calculate 3.86 ÷12.01.

12.01 × 0.321 = approx 3.86. So 0.321. So total is 4.321 moles.

Hydrogen:4.86 g /1.008 g/mol =4.821 moles.

Bromine:43.2 /79.904= let me compute this accurately.

79.904 × 0.54 is 0.54 ×79.904 = let me compute 0.5 ×79.904=39.952, and 0.04 ×79.904=3.196. So 39.952 +3.196=43.148. So 43.2 is a bit more than 0.54. Let me compute 43.2 /79.904.

43.2 ÷79.904. Let me compute this as 43.2 ÷79.904 ≈ 0.5406 moles. So approximately 0.5406.

So now, the moles are:

C:4.321

H:4.821

Br:0.5406

Now, let's find the ratios by dividing each by the smallest, which is 0.5406.

So C:4.321 /0.5406 ≈8.00 (exactly 8.0 when rounded)

H:4.821 /0.5406 ≈8.916

Br:0.5406 /0.5406 =1.

So the ratios are approximately 8 : 8.916 :1.

Hmm, that's still not a whole number. So maybe I need to find a factor that can turn 8.916 into a whole number. Let me see.

Looking at H, 8.916 is close to 8.916, which is approximately 8.916. Let's see, if I multiply each by 2, then:

C:16, H:17.832, Br:2.

Hmm, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps multiply by 3.

Wait, perhaps the H is approximately 8.916, which is near 8.9, maybe 89/10 or something, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the percentages add up to 100. Let me check: 51.9 +4.86 =56.76 +43.2=99.96, which is approximately 100%, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to get the exact mole ratios.

Let me try to compute more precisely.

C:51.9 /12.01.

12.01 *4 =48.04.

51.9 -48.04=3.86.

3.86 /12.01=0.3214.

So total C moles:4.3214.

H:4.86 /1.008.

As before, 4.821.

Br:43.2 /79.904=0.5406.

Now, let's compute the ratios precisely.

Divide each by 0.5406.

C:4.3214 /0.5406 = let's compute this.

0.5406 ×8=4.3248. Oh wait, that's very close to 4.3214. So 4.3214 is slightly less than 8 times 0.5406. So 8 times 0.5406 is 4.3248, which is 0.0034 more than 4.3214. So that's a difference of about 0.8%. So perhaps we can consider it as 8.

H:4.821 /0.5406 ≈ let's calculate 0.5406 ×8.9=4.81554. That's very close to 4.821. So 0.5406 ×8.9=4.8155. The actual is 4.821, which is 0.00545 higher. So 8.9 plus (0.00545/0.5406) ≈8.9 +0.01=8.91. So approximately 8.91.

So the ratios are C:8, H:8.91, Br:1.

That's still not a whole number. Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the H is approximately 9 and see if that makes sense.

If H is 9, then the ratio would be 8:9:1. So the formula would be C8H9Br.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option G is C8H9Br. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but let me check the math again. If the actual H ratio is approximately 8.91, which is very close to 9, perhaps the correct ratio is 8:9:1.

So the empirical formula would be C8H9Br, which is option G.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me check the sum of the percentages using this formula.

C8H9Br: The molar mass would be (8×12.01) + (9×1.008) +79.904.

Calculating that:

8×12.01=96.08.

9×1.008=9.072.

Total:96.08 +9.072=105.152 +79.904=185.056 g/mol.

Now, the percentages would be:

C: (96.08 /185.056) ×100 ≈51.94%.

H: (9.072 /185.056) ×100≈4.90%.

Br: (79.904 /185.056) ×100≈43.17%.

The given percentages are 51.9% C, 4.86% H, 43.2% Br. So these are very close. So the formula C8H9Br gives percentages that match closely to the given data.

So option G is correct.
</think>

To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we start by converting the given percentages into masses, assuming a 100 g sample. This gives:

- **Carbon (C):** 51.9 g  
- **Hydrogen (H):** 4.86 g  
- **Bromine (Br):** 43.2 g  

Next, we convert these masses into moles using their respective atomic masses:

1. **Moles of Carbon (C):**  
   \[
   \text{Moles of C} = \frac{51.9}{12.01} \approx 4.32 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Moles of Hydrogen (H):**  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H} = \frac{4.86}{1.008} \approx 4.82 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Moles of Bromine (Br):**  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Br} = \frac{43.2}{79.904} \approx 0.54 \, \text{mol}
   \]

To find the simplest whole number ratio, we divide each mole value by the smallest number of moles, which is \( 0.54 \):

- **Carbon (C):**  
  \[
  \frac{4.32}{0.54} \approx 8
  \]

- **Hydrogen (H):**  
  \[
  \frac{4.82}{0.54} \approx 8.92 \, (\text{approximately } 9)
  \]

- **Bromine (Br):**  
  \[
  \frac{0.54}{0.54} = 1
  \]

Thus, the simplest whole number ratio of the elements is approximately \( 8 : 9 : 1 \), corresponding to the empirical formula **C₈H₉Br**.

Finally, we verify the calculated formula by checking the percentages of each element in the compound. The molar mass of **C₈H₉Br** is:

\[
\text{Molar mass} = (8 \times 12.01) + (9 \times 1.008) + 79.904 = 185.056 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The percentages are calculated as:

- **Carbon (C):**  
  \[
  \frac{96.08}{185.056} \times 100 \approx 51.94\%
  \]

- **Hydrogen (H):**  
  \[
  \frac{9.072}{185.056} \times 100 \approx 4.90\%
  \]

- **Bromine (Br):**  
  \[
  \frac{79.904}{185.056} \times 100 \approx 43.17\%
  \]

These values are very close to the given percentages (51.9% C, 4.86% H, 43.2% Br), confirming that the empirical formula **C₈H₉Br** is correct.

The correct answer is **G**.
