Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about treaties and third states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on international law, but let me think through this.

The question is asking whether treaties bind third states, which are non-state parties. So, I need to remember the basic rules about treaties and their effects on states that aren't part of them.

From what I recall, the general principle is that treaties don't bind third states unless those states agree. I think it's something to do with the concept of "pacta tertius" or something like that. Oh wait, "pacta tertius" is about third parties and how a treaty doesn't impose obligations on them without consent.

Wait, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) probably covers this. Article 34, I think, states that a treaty doesn't create obligations or rights for a third state unless the third state agrees. So, unless the third state has given its consent, the treaty doesn't affect them.

Looking at the options:

Option A says treaties don't create obligations or rights for third states without their consent. That aligns with what I just thought. So A is a possible correct answer.

Option B says both obligations and rights are created, which would be incorrect because it's without consent.

Option C claims no rights even with consent. But I think if a third state consents, they can have rights, so C is wrong.

Option D: only obligations, which is incorrect because if they consent, they might have both, but D says only obligations, so probably wrong.

Option E: obligations without consent. No, that's not right because without consent, they aren't bound.

Option F: only rights. Not sure, but I think if a treaty benefits a third state, they can have rights if they agree. But the question is about binding, so F is about creating rights, but the main point is that without consent, they aren't bound. So F is not the answer.

Option G says no obligations or rights even with consent. That doesn't make sense because if a third state consents, like by acceding to the treaty, then they would be bound. So G is incorrect.

Option H: rights without consent. That's not right because, without consent, third states aren't bound. So H is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option A. Treaties don't impose obligations or rights on third states without their consent. So, third states aren't bound unless they agree to be.

The question asks whether treaties bind third States (non-State parties). The general principle in international law, reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), is that treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent. This principle is often referred to as "pacta tertius." 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. Treaties do not create obligations or rights for third States without their consent, aligning with the principle of "pacta tertius."
- **B**: Incorrect. Treaties do not create both obligations and rights for third States without their consent.
- **C**: Incorrect. If a third State consents, it can have rights under the treaty.
- **D**: Incorrect. Treaties may create obligations for third States only if they consent.
- **E**: Incorrect. Treaties do not create obligations for third States without their consent.
- **F**: Incorrect. Treaties may create rights for third States only if they consent.
- **G**: Incorrect. If a third State consents, it can be bound by the treaty.
- **H**: Incorrect. Treaties do not create rights for third States without their consent.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**

Answer: A
