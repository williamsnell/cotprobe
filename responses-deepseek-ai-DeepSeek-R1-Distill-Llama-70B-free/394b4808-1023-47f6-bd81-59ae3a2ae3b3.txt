Okay, so I have this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that the probability is 0.2 that a value selected at random from a normal distribution with a mean of 600 and a standard deviation of 15 will be above what number. And there are several options provided, labeled A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. So, normal distribution, mean (μ) is 600, standard deviation (σ) is 15. The probability that a value is above a certain number is 0.2. Wait, so P(X > x) = 0.2. I remember that in a normal distribution, the total area under the curve is 1, so 0.2 would be in the upper tail.

I think I should convert this to the Z-score because that's how I can relate it to the standard normal distribution tables or maybe use the inverse Z function. Let me recall the formula: Z = (X - μ) / σ. So, for a given X, I can find its Z-score.

But wait, I don't have X yet. I need to find the X such that the probability above it is 0.2. So, the area to the left of X is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. Because if P(X > x) is 0.2, then P(X ≤ x) is 0.8.

So, I need to find the Z-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.8. I think the Z-table gives the area to the left. Let me try to remember the Z values. Or maybe I can think about it as the 80th percentile.

I remember that for common percentiles, like 80%, the Z-scores are around 0.84 or so. Wait, let me think. The Z-score for 0.8 cumulative probability is approximately 0.84. Because I think the Z for 0.8 is about 0.84, and for 0.85 it's higher, maybe 1.04 or something. So yes, Z ≈ 0.84.

Wait, wait. No, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again. The standard normal table gives the area to the left. So for a Z of 0.84, what's the area? Let me approximate. At Z=0.8, the area is about 0.788. At Z=0.84, it's probably a bit higher. Maybe around 0.799 or 0.8? Yeah, I think that's right. So Z=0.84 gives an area of approximately 0.8, which is what we want.

So once I have Z, I can solve for X using the formula X = μ + Z*σ. Plugging the numbers in: X = 600 + 0.84*15.

Let me compute that. 0.84 times 15. 15 times 0.8 is 12, and 0.04 times 15 is 0.6. So 12 plus 0.6 is 12.6. So X = 600 + 12.6 = 612.6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 612.6. So that would be the answer. Alternatively, I should check if any other options match. Let me look: the options are A: 603.8, B: 605.3, C:600, D:620.5, E:625.9, F:610.2, G:587.4, H:612.6, I:0.84, J:615.7.

So H is 612.6, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So the probability that X is above a certain value is 0.2, so that area is in the upper tail. So the lower area (to the left) is 0.8. So yes, using Z=0.84, which corresponds to 0.8 area.

Wait, another way to think about it: the 80th percentile is at 612.6. So that makes sense. So that's why H is correct.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be H.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the value \( X \) such that the probability of a randomly selected value from a normal distribution with mean \( \mu = 600 \) and standard deviation \( \sigma = 15 \) being greater than \( X \) is 0.2. This means \( P(X > x) = 0.2 \), or equivalently, \( P(X \leq x) = 0.8 \).

1. **Convert to Z-score**: The \( Z \)-score corresponding to a cumulative probability of 0.8 can be approximated as \( Z = 0.84 \). This is because the standard normal distribution table shows that a \( Z \)-score of 0.84 corresponds to an area of approximately 0.8 to the left.

2. **Solve for \( X \)**: Using the formula \( X = \mu + Z \cdot \sigma \), substitute the known values:
   \[
   X = 600 + 0.84 \cdot 15
   \]
   Calculate \( 0.84 \cdot 15 = 12.6 \), so:
   \[
   X = 600 + 12.6 = 612.6
   \]

3. **Match with options**: Among the given options, \( 612.6 \) corresponds to option H.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: 612.6
