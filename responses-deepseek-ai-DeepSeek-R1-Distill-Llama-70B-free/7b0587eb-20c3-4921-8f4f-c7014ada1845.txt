Question:

In class, John's teacher tells him that she will give him the coin and bill for each picture he can correctly identify on the face of the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half-dollar, dollar bill, and five-dollar bill. John cannot identify any of them although he has been handling money for 17 years. His inability to remember the pictures most likely results from

Options:

A: sensory memory decay
B: retroactive interference
C: failure to encode
D: failure to reconstruct
E: false memory formation
F: lack of attention
G: failure to retrieve
H: confabulation
I: deep processing
J: proactive interference

Okay, so I've got this question about John who can't identify the pictures on various coins and bills, even though he's been handling money for 17 years. The question is asking why he can't remember them. The options are A through J, each representing different memory concepts.

Let me think. First, I need to understand the scenario. John's been handling money for a long time, so he's probably seen these images many times. But he can't identify them when asked. So it's not about whether he's seen them before, but rather why he can't recall them now.

Looking at the options, I remember some key memory concepts. Sensory memory decay (A) is when information in sensory memory fades quickly, like a few seconds. But since John has been handling money for years, the issue isn't that the info decayed from sensory memory.

Retroactive interference (B) happens when new information interferes with old information. But I don't see any mention of new information here, so maybe not this.

Failure to encode (C) means the information wasn't stored in the first place. But John has been handling money for 17 years, so he must have had plenty of opportunities to encode the images. So maybe not this either.

Failure to reconstruct (D) relates to how we reconstruct memories, especially in long-term. But is that the main issue here? I'm not sure.

False memory formation (E) is when we remember things that didn't happen, but the question doesn't suggest John is remembering wrong things, just that he can't remember.

Lack of attention (F) could be a factor. If he wasn't paying attention when he handled the money, maybe he didn't encode it properly. But again, he's been doing it for so long, so perhaps he did encode it.

Failure to retrieve (G) is when the information is stored but can't be accessed. That sounds possible. Maybe the information is there, but he can't pull it up when needed.

Confabulation (H) is when we fill in memory gaps with made-up info, which doesn't fit here.

Deep processing (I) is about how information is processed. Deep processing leads to better retention, but John's issue is the opposite.

Proactive interference (J) is when old info interferes with new info. Not sure how that applies here.

Wait, the question says John can't identify any of them. So maybe he never really encoded the information in the first place. Because even though he's handled money, if he didn't pay attention or process it deeply, it might not have been stored properly.

Alternatively, if he did store it but can't retrieve it now, that's failure to retrieve. But which is more likely?

I think the key here is the initial encoding. If he was handling money without paying much attention or without deeply processing the images, the information might not have been properly encoded into his long-term memory. So when he tries to recall, it's not there because it wasn't stored well. That would point to failure to encode (C).

Wait, but another thought. If he's used money for years, he might have stored it, but maybe in a way that's not easily retrievable. Like, maybe he knows the shapes and uses them but doesn't remember the actual pictures. But the question is about correctly identifying the pictures, implying the information isn't accessible.

Alternatively, maybe he has the information stored but can't bring it up, which would be failure to retrieve (G). But I'm a bit confused between C and G.

Wait, the question says he cannot identify any of them. So, if the information wasn't encoded, he can't retrieve it because it's not there. So failure to encode would mean it's not in memory, leading to inability to retrieve.

So, the answer would be C: failure to encode.

But wait, another angle. If he's been handling money for so long, maybe he used to know but forgot. But the options don't include something like that. Or perhaps he's suffering from interference.

Alternatively, maybe he never paid attention, so he didn't encode the details in the first place. That makes sense. So, the correct answer is C: failure to encode.

John's inability to identify the pictures on coins and bills, despite handling money for 17 years, suggests that the information was never properly stored in his memory. This points to "failure to encode" (C), as the images were likely not processed deeply or attended to sufficiently to be encoded into long-term memory. Without proper encoding, retrieval becomes impossible.

Answer: C
