Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the wavelength of light needed for photosynthesis. Hmm, the question says that the enthalpy change (ΔH) is 2800 kJ for producing one mole of C6H12O6 from CO2 and H2O. I'm supposed to find the wavelength per molecule of CO2 for a one-step process. 

Wait, I remember that in photosynthesis, energy from light is used to drive the reaction. So the energy provided by the light must be equal to the enthalpy change of the reaction. But wait, ΔH here is positive, which means the reaction is endothermic. So the system is taking in energy, which makes sense because light provides the energy.

So the first thing I need is the energy per mole and then convert that to energy per molecule. Oh right, because the question asks per molecule, not per mole.

The formula I think I need is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. But wait, energy per photon is hc/λ. So I'll need to find out how many photons are needed per molecule.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the energy required per mole of glucose produced.
2. Convert that to energy per molecule.
3. Find out how much energy each photon provides.
4. Determine the wavelength corresponding to that energy per photon.

Wait, the ΔH given is 2800 kJ per mole. So that's 2800,000 J per mole. Since one mole is Avogadro's number (about 6.022e23 molecules), the energy per molecule is 2800000 J / 6.022e23 molecules.

Yes, that makes sense. Let me write that down:

Energy per molecule = 2800000 J/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol = approx 4.65e-20 J/molecule.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. 2800000 divided by 6.022e23.

2800000 = 2.8e6. 2.8e6 / 6.022e23 = approx 4.65e-18 J/molecule. Wait, no, 2.8e6 / 6.022e23 is 2.8/(6.022) = approx 0.465, then 10^6 /10^23 is 10^-17. So 0.465e-17 = 4.65e-18 J/molecule.

Wait, I think I messed that up. Let me compute 2.8e6 / 6.022e23. 

2.8e6 is 2,800,000 and 6.022e23 is a huge number. So 2.8e6 /6.022e23 = 2.8/(6.022) * 1e6-23 = 0.465 * 1e-17 = 4.65e-18 J per molecule.

Wait, no, 1e6 minus 1e23 is 1e-17? Wait, 1e6 is 10^6, 1e23 is 10^23. So 10^6 / 10^23 = 10^(6-23) = 10^-17. So yes, 4.65e-18 J/molecule.

Wait, 2.8e6 / 6.022e23 = (2.8 / 6.022) * 1e6 / 1e23 = (approx 0.465) * 1e-17 = 4.65e-18 J per molecule.

Now, each photon's energy is E = hc/λ. So I can set this equal to the energy per molecule, so:

hc/λ = 4.65e-18 J.

Wait, but wait, each photon contributes its energy to the reaction. So to produce one molecule of glucose, how many photons are needed? Or is the energy per photon equal to the energy required per molecule? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the energy from light must provide at least the required energy per molecule. So each molecule would need the energy from one photon, so E_photon = 4.65e-18 J.

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's one photon per molecule. Because in real photosynthesis, it's multiple photons per molecule, but the question says a one-step process. So perhaps we're assuming one photon is absorbed to provide the energy for one molecule.

So if that's the case, then E_photon = 4.65e-18 J.

Now, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So putting into E=hc/λ:

λ = hc / E.

So plugging in the numbers:

λ = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (4.65e-18 J).

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator is 4.65e-18 J.

So λ = 1.9878e-25 / 4.65e-18 = approx 4.277e-8 meters.

Wait, 4.277e-8 meters is 4.277e-8 m * 1e10 Å/m = 4.277e2 Å, so 427.7 Å? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the range of 1500 to 6000 Å.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, let me recompute.

E per molecule is 2800000 J per mole / 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

Wait, 2800000 J is 2.8e6 J. So 2.8e6 / 6.022e23 = approx 4.65e-18 J/molecule. That seems correct.

Then E_photon = 4.65e-18 J.

So λ = hc/E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (4.65e-18).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

Divide by 4.65e-18: 1.9878e-25 / 4.65e-18 = 4.277e-8 meters.

Which is 4.277e-8 meters = 4.277e-8 m * 1e10 Å/m = 4.277e2 Å = 427.7 Å.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are A:3000, B:2570, etc. 427 is not among them. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe I got the energy per mole wrong. Wait, the question states that ΔH is 2800 kJ for the production of one mole of glucose. So that's per mole, correct.

Wait, but another thing: energy from the reaction. ΔH is the enthalpy change. But in thermodynamics, when a reaction is endothermic, the system absorbs heat. So the energy from the light should be equal to the ΔH, which is positive here. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the energy per photon as the energy per molecule. Because each photon provides energy, and perhaps each molecule requires one photon. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but 427 Å is in the X-ray range, not visible light. The options are all longer wavelengths, like 2000 Å (which is 200 nm, in the UV) and up. So I'm getting a wavelength shorter than any of the options. So clearly I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for ΔH. Wait, the question says ΔH is 2800 kJ per mole. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the math.

E per molecule = 2800000 J/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol = 2800000 / 6.022e23.

Let me compute 2800000 / 6.022e23:

2800000 = 2.8e6.

2.8e6 / 6.022e23 = (2.8 /6.022) * 1e6/1e23 = 0.465 * 1e-17 = 4.65e-18 J per molecule.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, E_photon = 4.65e-18 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (4.65e-18)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then divide by E_photon: 1.9878e-25 /4.65e-18 = (1.9878 /4.65 ) * 1e-25+18 = approx 0.428 * 1e-7 = 4.28e-8 m.

Which is 4.28e-8 meters = 4.28e-8 m * 1e10 Å/m = 4.28e2 Å = 428 Å.

Wait, 428 Å is 42.8 nm. None of the options are this low. The closest is option G:1500 Å, which is 150 nm.

Hmm, that's way off. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the energy per photon as the energy per mole, but then that would be for a mole of photons. Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is expecting to calculate the energy required per mole, find the number of moles, then get per molecule.

Wait, no, I think I did that right.

Wait, perhaps the ΔH is given as kJ per mole, but perhaps I should have converted it to J by multiplying by 1000, which I did (2800 kJ = 2,800,000 J). So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the wavelength per molecule, but perhaps I should have considered that each photon can only contribute a certain amount of energy, so the energy per molecule is the same as the energy per photon. So that's what I did.

But perhaps the question is considering the energy from multiple photons per molecule. For example, in real photosynthesis, more than one photon is used per molecule. But the question says it's a one-step process, so maybe only one photon is needed. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the units. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 4.65e-18 J:

1.9878e-25 / 4.65e-18 = (1.9878 /4.65 ) * 1e-25 +18 = 0.428 * 1e-7 = 4.28e-8 m = 42.8 nm = 428 Å.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the energy per molecule.

Wait, maybe the ΔH is 2800 kJ per mole of glucose. So 2800 kJ is the energy required to produce one mole, which is 6.022e23 molecules.

So energy per molecule is 2800 kJ/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

Wait, 2800 kJ is 2800,000 J. So 2800000 J / 6.022e23 molecules = 4.65e-18 J/molecule.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is using the enthalpy change as energy required, but perhaps it's the other way around. Because in photosynthesis, the reaction is actually ΔH positive, meaning it's endothermic, so the system is taking in heat (energy).

So, perhaps the light must provide that energy. So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to see what the options are and see if any of them would give me an energy close to 4.65e-18 J per photon.

Let me compute the energy for each option.

E = hc/λ.

Let me compute for each option:

Option A: 3000 Å = 3e-7 m.

E = 6.626e-34 *3e8 / 3e-7 = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 3e-7 = 6.626e-34 *1e15 = 6.626e-19 J.

So 6.626e-19 J per photon.

But my required energy per molecule is 4.65e-18 J. So one photon provides 6.626e-19 J, which is less than required. So two photons would give 1.325e-18 J, which is still less than 4.65e-18. So three photons would be 1.9878e-18, which is about 4.3e-18. So about 4 photons would give 2.65e-18, which is less than 4.65e-18. So maybe 7 photons?

Wait, but the question says a one-step process, so perhaps only one photon is involved. So this doesn't add up because 3000 Å gives a photon energy of ~6.6e-19 J, which is less than the 4.65e-18 J needed.

Option B: 2570 Å = 2.57e-7 m.

E = 6.626e-34 *3e8 /2.57e-7 = (6.626e-34 *3e8) = 1.9878e-25 J·m / 2.57e-7 m = 1.9878e-25 / 2.57e-7 ≈ 7.74e-19 J.

Still less than 4.65e-18. So two photons would give ~1.55e-18 J, which is still less than 4.65e-18.

Option E: 4100 Å = 4.1e-7 m.

E = 6.626e-34 *3e8 /4.1e-7 = (1.9878e-25) /4.1e-7 ≈ 4.85e-19 J. Still too small.

Option I: 2000 Å = 2e-7 m.

E = 1.9878e-25 / 2e-7 = 9.939e-19 J. So 9.9e-19 J per photon. To reach 4.65e-18, need about 4.65e-18 /9.9e-19 ≈ 4.7 photons. So again, more than one.

Wait, but if the question is about a one-step process, then perhaps each molecule requires the energy of a single photon. So, perhaps I need to find the wavelength where one photon provides 4.65e-18 J.

Which would give λ = hc/E = 6.626e-34 *3e8 /4.65e-18 = 4.28e-8 m = 428 Å. But that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question confused kJ and J. Let me see. Wait, the question says 2800 kJ per mole. So that's 2800,000 J. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the energy per mole in eV, but I think the approach is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering that the energy from the photon is the same as the molar enthalpy, but that doesn't make sense because energy per mole would require a huge number of photons.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the energy per mole, but that's not what the question says. The question says per molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy required per molecule as 2800 kJ multiplied by Avogadro's number in reverse. Wait, no, per molecule would be per mole divided by Avogadro's number, which is what I did.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is using a different value for ΔH. Wait, I remember that in photosynthesis, the standard ΔH for glucose formation is about +2800 kJ per mole. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the wavelength in a different way. Let me try using the energy per mole to find the wavelength per mole, then see what that gives. Though I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

The energy per mole is 2.8e6 J.

Number of photons per mole is 6.022e23.

So energy per photon is 2.8e6 /6.022e23 = 4.65e-18 J/photon.

Wait, same as before. So same calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the wavelength needed to provide that energy per mole, so E=2800 kJ = 2.8e6 J.

So using E=hc/λ for one mole: λ = hcN_A / E.

Wait, N_A is Avogadro's number.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8 *6.022e23) / (2.8e6).

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Multiply by 6.022e23: 1.9878e-25 *6.022e23 = 1.9878 *6.022e-2 = approx 11.98e-2 = 0.1198 J·m.

Divide by 2.8e6 J: 0.1198 /2.8e6 = 4.277e-8 m = 427.7 Å, same as before.

Still not matching any options. So I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that energy required is the negative of ΔH. No, because ΔH is positive for endothermic, so energy is absorbed.

Wait, perhaps the question uses wavelength in Angstroms, and I might have made an error in unit conversion.

Wait, let's compute 427.7 Å. None of the options are close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering that the energy is supplied by visible light, so perhaps in the range of 400-700 nm (4000 to 7000 Å). Looking
