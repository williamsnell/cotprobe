Question:

An investigator is studying the incidence of the common cold among medical students at various time points during the school year. Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?

Options:

A: Decreased lymphocyte count
B: Decreased basophil count
C: Decreased macrophage activity
D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration
E: Increased macrophage activity
F: Decreased neutrophil count
G: Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration
H: Increased eosinophil count
I: Increased lymphocyte count
J: Increased basophil count

Okay, so I've got this question here about the immune system and stress. Let me think it through. Hmm, the question says that during finals week, medical students have more upper respiratory tract infections. The hypothesis is that stress from studying affects their immune system, making them more susceptible.

I remember that stress can impact the immune system. The main thing I think is involved here is cortisol. Cortisol is a steroid hormone released in response to stress. It's part of the fight-or-flight response. Oh right, cortisol has immunosuppressive effects. So when cortisol levels are high, the immune system doesn't work as well.

So the question is asking which lab finding supports this. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Decreased lymphocyte count. Lymphocytes are important for immune responses. If cortisol is high, it might reduce their numbers because cortisol can suppress the immune cells. But wait, I think cortisol might cause a redistribution of lymphocytes, like moving from the blood to other tissues. So maybe the count in blood decreases, but does that mean the total is lower? Not sure yet.

Option B: Decreased basophil count. Basophils are involved in inflammation and allergic reactions. Not sure how stress affects them. Maybe not directly related to immune suppression in infections.

Option C: Decreased macrophage activity. Macrophages are a first line of defense. If their activity is decreased, that would impair the immune response. Cortisol can inhibit some functions of macrophages. So this could be a possibility.

Option D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration. Oh, so cortisol is higher in the morning (AM). Since finals week is stressful, cortisol should be elevated. So this would support the hypothesis because higher cortisol would suppress the immune system. That makes sense.

Option E: Increased macrophage activity. If macrophages are more active, that would be a good immune response. So this would contradict the hypothesis. So probably not the right answer.

Option F: Decreased neutrophil count. Neutrophils are another type of white blood cell. But I don't remember cortisol specifically decreasing neutrophils. Maybe stress can affect their distribution too, but I'm not certain.

Option G: Decreased AM serum cortisol. Opposite of what would be expected. Stress should increase cortisol, so this doesn't support the hypothesis.

Option H: Increased eosinophil count. Eosinophils are more involved in fighting parasites and in allergic reactions. Not sure about their role here, but I don't think stress would increase them in this context.

Option I: Increased lymphocyte count. If cortisol is high, this probably wouldn't happen because cortisol tends to decrease lymphocyte numbers. So this wouldn't support the hypothesis.

Option J: Increased basophil count. Again, not directly related to the immune suppression from stress.

So from this, the best options seem to be A, C, or D. The question is about which finding supports the hypothesis that stress (through cortisol) is suppressing the immune system.

If cortisol is increased (option D), that directly supports the stress leading to immune suppression. But the effects of cortisol on immune cells would be things like decreased lymphocytes or macrophage activity.

Wait, but the question is looking for the laboratory finding that supports the hypothesis. So the lab finding could be either the high cortisol or the effect on the immune cells.

So the correct answer would be either D (increased cortisol) or A (decreased lymphocytes), or C (decreased macrophage activity).

But the question says which is 'most likely' to support the hypothesis. The hypothesis is about stress affecting the immune system. So the direct effect would be the increased cortisol. Because without the cortisol being high, the other effects might not make sense.

So the correct answer would be D: Increased AM serum cortisol concentration.

Wait, but cortisol levels typically follow a circadian rhythm, peaking in the morning. So if they're stressed, their morning cortisol would be higher than normal. So option D is looking at AM cortisol and seeing it's increased.

So the answer should be D.

The question investigates how stress from finals week might suppress the immune system, leading to more upper respiratory tract infections among medical students. The hypothesis is that stress increases cortisol levels, which have immunosuppressive effects. The task is to identify the laboratory finding that most strongly supports this hypothesis.

Cortisol is a steroid hormone released during stress, and it is known to suppress the immune system by reducing the activity or count of immune cells like lymphocytes and macrophages. Among the options provided:

- **Option A (Decreased lymphocyte count)**: While cortisol can reduce lymphocyte counts in the blood due to redistribution, this is an indirect effect and does not directly confirm the hypothesis.
- **Option C (Decreased macrophage activity)**: Cortisol can inhibit macrophage activity, but this is also an effect of elevated cortisol rather than direct evidence of the hypothesis.
- **Option D (Increased AM serum cortisol concentration)**: This directly measures the stress response and provides the most direct evidence for the hypothesis. Elevated morning cortisol levels are a clear indicator of stress and align with the proposed mechanism of immune suppression.

While options A and C could be secondary effects of increased cortisol, the most direct and likely finding to support the hypothesis is increased AM serum cortisol concentration. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D
