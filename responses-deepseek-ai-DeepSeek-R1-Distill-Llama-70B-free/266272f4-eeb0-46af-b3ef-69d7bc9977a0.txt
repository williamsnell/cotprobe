Alright, so I have this question here: (1+i)^10 equals which of the options given. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on complex numbers, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with expressions like (a + b)^n, the binomial theorem can be used, but that can get complicated for n=10. Maybe there's a smarter way, especially since we're dealing with complex numbers here.

Wait, I think using polar form might be easier. Yeah, because raising complex numbers to powers is simpler in polar form. So, I should convert (1+i) into polar form first.

Alright, 1+i in the complex plane is a point where both the real and imaginary parts are 1. The magnitude (or modulus) of this complex number is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Right, and the angle (argument) is 45 degrees or π/4 radians because it's on the line y=x in the first quadrant.

So, in polar form, 1+i can be written as sqrt(2) * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)). Now, when you raise a complex number in polar form to a power, you can use De Moivre's Theorem. The theorem says that [r (cosθ + i sinθ)]^n = r^n [cos(nθ) + i sin(nθ)].

Applying that here, (1+i)^10 becomes [sqrt(2)]^10 * [cos(10*(π/4)) + i sin(10*(π/4))].

Let's compute each part. The modulus raised to the 10th power: [sqrt(2)]^10. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^10 = 2^(10/2) = 2^5 = 32. Got that part.

Now the angle: 10*(π/4) is (10/4)*π = (5/2)π. Which is the same as 2π + π/2, right? Because 5/2 π is 2π (a full circle) plus π/2. But since angles are periodic modulo 2π, adding 2π doesn't change the position, so it's equivalent to an angle of π/2 radians.

So the angle part becomes cos(π/2) + i sin(π/2). I remember that cos(π/2) is 0 and sin(π/2) is 1. So substituting those in, we get 0 + i*1 = i.

Putting it all together, (1+i)^10 is 32 * i. So that's 32i.

Looking at the options, option C is 32i. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check in case I made a miscalculation. Let me recompute [sqrt(2)]^10. sqrt(2) is 2^0.5, so (2^0.5)^10 = 2^(5) =32. That's correct. The angle calculation: 10*(π/4)= 10π/4=5π/2. 5π/2 is 2π*2 + π/2. So yes, same as π/2. So cos is 0, sin is 1. So 32*(0 + i*1) =32i. Yep, that's right.

Alternatively, I remember that (1+i)^2 is (1 + 2i + i^2) = 1 +2i -1 = 2i. So (1+i)^2=2i. Then, (1+i)^4 = (2i)^2=4i^2= -4. Then (1+i)^8 = (-4)^2=16. Then (1+i)^10 = (1+i)^8 * (1+i)^2 =16 * 2i=32i. Oh wait, that's another way to get the same result. So that confirms it. So the answer is definitely C.

To solve \((1+i)^{10}\), it is most efficient to convert the complex number \(1+i\) into polar form and then apply De Moivre's Theorem. 

1. **Convert \(1+i\) to polar form**:  
   - The modulus (magnitude) of \(1+i\) is \(\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}\).  
   - The argument (angle) is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians, as \(1+i\) lies on the line \(y=x\) in the first quadrant.  
   - Thus, \(1+i\) in polar form is \(\sqrt{2} \cdot (\cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4})\).

2. **Apply De Moivre's Theorem**:  
   De Moivre's Theorem states that \([r \cdot (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)]^n = r^n \cdot (\cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta))\).  
   - Here, \(r = \sqrt{2}\), \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), and \(n = 10\).  
   - Compute \(r^{10}\):  
     \[
     (\sqrt{2})^{10} = (2^{1/2})^{10} = 2^{5} = 32.
     \]  
   - Compute \(10\theta\):  
     \[
     10 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{10\pi}{4} = \frac{5\pi}{2}.
     \]  
     Since \(\frac{5\pi}{2}\) is equivalent to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) (as angles are periodic modulo \(2\pi\)), we use \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).  
   - Compute \(\cos\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\sin\frac{\pi}{2}\):  
     \[
     \cos\frac{\pi}{2} = 0, \quad \sin\frac{\pi}{2} = 1.
     \]  
   - Combine the results:  
     \[
     (1+i)^{10} = 32 \cdot (\cos\frac{\pi}{2} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{2}) = 32 \cdot (0 + i \cdot 1) = 32i.
     \]

3. **Verify using an alternative method**:  
   - Compute \((1+i)^2\):  
     \[
     (1+i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i.
     \]  
   - Compute \((1+i)^4\):  
     \[
     (1+i)^4 = (2i)^2 = 4i^2 = -4.
     \]  
   - Compute \((1+i)^8\):  
     \[
     (1+i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.
     \]  
   - Compute \((1+i)^{10}\):  
     \[
     (1+i)^{10} = (1+i)^8 \cdot (1+i)^2 = 16 \cdot 2i = 32i.
     \]  

Both methods confirm that \((1+i)^{10} = 32i\). Among the given options, the correct answer is **C: 32i**.
