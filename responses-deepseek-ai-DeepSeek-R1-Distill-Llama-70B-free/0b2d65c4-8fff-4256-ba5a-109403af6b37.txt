Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the influence of the five early schools of thought on modern psychology. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the five early schools are Structuralism, Functionalism, Gestalt, Behaviorism, and Psychoanalysis. Each of these had different focuses and methodologies. 

Structuralism, led by Wundt and Titchener, focused on breaking down mental processes into basic components. I think this laid the groundwork for experimental methods in psychology. Even though it's not as dominant now, its methods probably influenced later research techniques.

Functionalism, from people like William James, looked at the purpose of mental processes, how they help us adapt. This seems more about why we do things, which ties into applied fields like educational psychology or developmental. So their ideas might still be relevant.

Gestalt psychology emphasized the whole over parts, with concepts like perception and problem-solving. I remember things like the Gestalt principles still being taught in cognitive psychology, so that's a direct influence.

Behaviorism, with Pavlov, Skinner, etc., focused on observable behavior. This school was huge in psychology for a long time, especially in areas like learning theory and behavioral psychology. Even though cognitive psychology came later, behaviorism's emphasis on empirical evidence and research methods is still foundational.

Psychoanalysis, from Freud, dealt with the unconscious mind and internal conflicts. While some of his theories are criticized, concepts like the unconscious and defense mechanisms are still part of psychological thought, especially in clinical and counseling areas.

So each of these schools contributed something unique. Modern psychology is eclectic, pulling from various theories. For example, cognitive-behavioral therapy combines behaviorism with cognitive aspects, which might relate back to older schools.

Looking at the options now: 

Option A says early schools were only relevant to their cultures and have no bearing now. That doesn't seem right because methods and theories from them are still used.

Option B claims modern psychology only uses their methodologies, not theories. But I think both methods and theories have had lasting effects, so B might not be correct.

Option C says all early schools are obsolete. No, that's not true. Behaviorism and psychoanalysis, for example, still influence certain areas.

Option D states modern psychology rejects early principles. That's too strong. They might have evolved but not completely rejected.

Option E suggests each school had a beneficial effect. This aligns with my earlier thoughts. Each contributed in some way, even if their dominance has waned.

Option F says the schools didn't influence modern psychology. That's incorrect because they laid the groundwork.

Option G claims a single unified theory replaced them. Psychology is more fragmented, with multiple theories and approaches, so G is wrong.

Option H says three schools dominate now, others discredited. I'm not sure which three would dominate. Maybe behaviorism, cognitive, and perhaps psychoanalysis? But I think all five have some influence, not just three.

Option I says only one school influenced modern psychology. No, that's too narrow.

Option J claims it's a reflection of only two. Again, I think more than two have influenced.

So the best answer seems to be E: Each early school of thought had some beneficial effect on the shaping of psychology as we know it today.

The five early schools of thought—Structuralism, Functionalism, Gestalt, Behaviorism, and Psychoanalysis—each contributed uniquely to the development of modern psychology. Structuralism introduced experimental methods, Functionalism explored mental processes' purposes, Gestalt emphasized holistic perception, Behaviorism focused on observable behavior, and Psychoanalysis examined the unconscious. These contributions have shaped various areas of psychology, from research techniques to clinical practices. While their dominance may have waxed and waned, all five schools have left lasting influences. Modern psychology is eclectic, integrating elements from these schools into theories and applications like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Therefore, each early school had a beneficial effect on shaping psychology today.

E: Each early school of thought had some beneficial effect on the shaping of psychology as we know it today.

Answer: E
