Okay, so I've got this DNA question here, and I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but let me try to think it through. The question says that a DNA molecule has 180 base pairs and is 20 percent adenine. I need to find out how many cytosine nucleotides are present. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that DNA is double-stranded, so each base pair consists of two complementary bases. Oh right, base pairing rules: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). So the total number of base pairs is 180, meaning each strand has 180 nucleotides because each base pair is two nucleotides connected.

The molecule is 20% adenine. Wait, adenine is one of the four bases, so I think this means that 20% of all the bases in the DNA are adenine. But wait, DNA is double-stranded, so adenine in one strand pairs with thymine in the other. So the percentage would apply to the entire molecule, both strands combined.

Let me break it down. The total number of nucleotides in the DNA is 180 * 2 = 360 nucleotides (since each base pair is two nucleotides). If 20% of these are adenine, then the number of adenine nucleotides is 0.2 * 360 = 72. So there are 72 adenine nucleotides in total.

But wait, because in DNA, the number of adenine equals the number of thymine. Because every A pairs with a T. So if there are 72 A's, there are 72 T's. So A + T = 72 +72=144. So the remaining bases must be C and G. Because all four bases add up to 360.

So the total of C and G would be 360 - 144 = 216. Now, I remember that in DNA, the number of C equals the number of G because they pair together. So C = G. Let me call each of them x. So x + x = 216 → 2x=216 → x=108. So each, C and G, are 108 each.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. Because each base pair contributes two nucleotides. Hmm. Wait, no. The calculation earlier was correct. Because when I counted 72 A's and 72 T's, that's 144 total. So 360-144=216, which are C and G. Since C and G pair, their counts are equal. So 216 divided by 2 is 108 each. So C is 108, G is 108.

Wait, but the question is asking for cytosine nucleotides. So the answer would be 108. Looking at the options, option A is 108. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check.

Alternatively, another approach is using Chargaff's rules, which state that in any DNA molecule, the amount of adenine equals thymine, and cytosine equals guanine. Also, the total base composition can be calculated.

Total base pairs is 180, so total nucleotides is 360. The percentage of adenine is 20%, so 20% of 360 is 72 A's. So T is also 72. So C plus G equals 360 - (72+72) = 216. And since C = G, each is 108. So cytosine is 108.

Looking at the options, option A is 108. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the number of cytosine nucleotides in a DNA molecule with 180 base pairs and 20% adenine, we proceed as follows:

1. **Total Nucleotides**: Since the DNA is double-stranded, the total number of nucleotides is \( 180 \times 2 = 360 \).

2. **Adenine (A) Count**: The molecule is 20% adenine, so the number of adenine nucleotides is \( 0.2 \times 360 = 72 \).

3. **Thymine (T) Count**: By Chargaff's rules, adenine pairs with thymine, so the number of thymine nucleotides is also 72.

4. **Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) Count**: The remaining nucleotides are cytosine and guanine. Their total is \( 360 - (72 + 72) = 216 \). Since cytosine and guanine pair together, they are equal in number. Thus, each is \( 216 \div 2 = 108 \).

Therefore, the number of cytosine nucleotides is **108**.

The correct answer is **A: 108 nucleotides**.
