Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find out how many ways I can form a 7-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with permutations and repeated elements, there's a specific formula to calculate the number of unique arrangements.

Wait, right, the formula is n factorial divided by the product of the factorials of the counts of each repeated element. So n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of items and n1, n2 etc. are the counts of each distinct item.

In this problem, the digits are 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3. So I have a total of 7 digits. Let me count how many of each: 1 occurs once, 2 occurs twice, and 3 occurs four times. So the formula should be 7! divided by (1! * 2! * 4!).

Wait, let me calculate that. 7! is 5040. Then, 1! is 1, 2! is 2, 4! is 24. So the denominator is 1*2*24 = 48. So 5040 divided by 48. Let me do that division.

Hmm, 5040 divided by 48. Well, 48 times 100 is 4800. 5040 minus 4800 is 240. Now, 48 goes into 240 exactly 5 times (since 48*5=240). So 100 + 5 = 105. So the total number of ways is 105. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 105. But wait, wait, wait a second. Oh, right! Because the number can't start with a zero, but in this case, all the digits are 1, 2, or 3. So there's no zero involved. So all 7-digit numbers formed are valid, and we don't have to subtract any cases where the first digit is zero. So the calculation should be correct.

So the answer should be C:105.

To determine the number of ways to form a 7-digit number using the digits 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, we use the formula for permutations of multiset:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \dots \cdot n_k!}
\]

Here:
- \( n = 7 \) (total digits),
- \( n_1 = 1 \) (count of digit 1),
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (count of digit 2),
- \( n_3 = 4 \) (count of digit 3).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\frac{7!}{1! \cdot 2! \cdot 4!} = \frac{5040}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 24} = \frac{5040}{48} = 105
\]

Since all digits are non-zero, no invalid 7-digit numbers are formed. Thus, the total number of valid 7-digit numbers is **105**.

The correct answer is **C**.
