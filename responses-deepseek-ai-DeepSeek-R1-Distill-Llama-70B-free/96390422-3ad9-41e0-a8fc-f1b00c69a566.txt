Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about blood types in a population. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question gives me the gene frequencies for the A, B, and O alleles in an isolated mountain village. The frequencies are 0.95 for A, 0.04 for B, and 0.01 for O. The total population is 424 people, and I need to find out how many individuals have each blood type: O, A, B, and AB.

Hmm, I remember that blood type is determined by the ABO system, where each person has two alleles—one from each parent. The possible blood types are O, A, B, and AB. 

So, each blood type is determined by the combination of these alleles. O type is OO, A is AA or AO, B is BB or BO, and AB is AB.

Wait, the frequencies are for the alleles, not the blood types. So I need to calculate the genotype frequencies first, and then determine the number of people in each blood type category.

I think the Hardy-Weinberg principle applies here. It says that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences. So I can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to find the genotype frequencies.

The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, but more specifically, for each possible genotype. Wait, actually, the equation for each genotype is:

- Frequency of AA: p²
- Frequency of AO (which is the same as OA, so it's 2pq)
- Frequency of BB: q²
- Frequency of BO (which is 2qr)
- Frequency of AB: 2pr
Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the alleles. Wait, in the ABO system, O is recessive. So the alleles are A, B, and O.

Wait, but in the standard model, the ABO system has three alleles, but usually, people consider the O allele as recessive. So maybe I should think of the alleles as A, B, and O, and each person has two of them.

But wait, perhaps it's better to model it as two alleles since O is recessive. Alternatively, maybe I should consider each person's genotype as having two alleles, each being A, B, or O.

Wait, but in the ABO system, an individual can't have more than two alleles. So the possible genotypes are:

- OO: O blood type
- AO or OA: A blood type (since O is recessive)
- BO or OB: B blood type
- AB: AB blood type
- AA: A blood type
- BB: B blood type

Wait, that's a bit more complicated than the standard two-allele case. So the Hardy-Weinberg approach for three alleles would involve more calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of each allele's frequency and compute the genotype frequencies.

Let me list the possible genotypes and how they correspond to blood types:

Blood Type | Genotypes
--- | ---
O | OO
A | AA, AO
B | BB, BO
AB | AB

So for each blood type, I'll calculate the genotype frequencies and sum them up.

Given the allele frequencies:
p = frequency of A = 0.95
q = frequency of B = 0.04
r = frequency of O = 0.01

Wait, but wait, in the ABO system, the sum of the allele frequencies should be 1. Let's check: 0.95 + 0.04 + 0.01 = 1.00, so that's correct.

Now, the possible genotypes are determined by combinations of these alleles. Each individual has two alleles, so the possible genotype combinations are:

AA, AO, AB, BO, BB, OO.

Wait, but for the blood type, AO is A, BO is B, AB is AB, OO is O. AA is A, BB is B.

Wait, but how do we calculate the frequencies of each genotype?

The Hardy-Weinberg equation for three alleles is a bit more involved. Each genotype's frequency is the product of the allele frequencies, considering their combinations.

So:

- Frequency of AA: p² = (0.95)^2
- Frequency of BB: q² = (0.04)^2
- Frequency of OO: r² = (0.01)^2
- Frequency of AB: 2pq = 2*(0.95)*(0.04)
- Frequency of AO: 2pr = 2*(0.95)*(0.01)
- Frequency of BO: 2qr = 2*(0.04)*(0.01)

Wait, no. Wait, each genotype is formed by two alleles. So for each possible pair, considering order, but since diploid organisms have two alleles, the possible unordered pairs are the combinations.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the possible genotypes and their probabilities.

Wait, another approach: the genotype frequencies are calculated as follows.

The possible genotypes are:

- AA: p^2
- AO: 2pr (where r is the frequency of O)
Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I should think of each possible combination.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the possible two-allele combinations can be calculated using the multinomial approach. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate each possible genotype's frequency:

AA occurs when both alleles are A: p * p = p².

AO occurs when one allele is A and the other is O: 2 * p * r (since AO and OA are the same).

AB occurs when one allele is A and the other is B: 2 * p * q.

Similarly, BB is q², BO is 2 * q * r, and OO is r².

Wait, that makes sense. Because each pair of different alleles contributes two possible arrangements, hence the 2 factor.

So, the frequencies for each genotype are:

- AA: p²
- AO: 2pr
- AB: 2pq
- BB: q²
- BO: 2qr
- OO: r²

Wait, but wait, I think I may have confused the notation here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the standard notation in Hardy-Weinberg for two alleles is:

p is the frequency of allele A, q for allele a. Then the genotypes are AA (p²), Aa (2pq), aa (q²).

But here, we have three alleles, so it's a bit more complex. So perhaps each genotype's frequency is the product of the two allele frequencies, considering all possible combinations.

So, for example:

- The frequency of AO genotype (which could be AO or OA) is 2 * p * r, where p is A's frequency and r is O's.

Similarly, AB genotype is 2 * p * q (A and B), and BO is 2 * q * r (B and O).

Wait, but that would make sense because each of these is a heterozygous combination, and the 2 comes from the two possible orders.

So, the genotype frequencies are:

- AA: p²
- AO: 2pr
- AB: 2pq
- BB: q²
- BO: 2qr
- OO: r²

Now, the blood type is determined by the genotype as follows:

- O blood type: OO genotype → frequency r²
- A blood type: AA and AO → p² + 2pr
- B blood type: BB and BO → q² + 2qr
- AB blood type: AB → 2pq

So, now I can compute each blood type's frequency.

Let me plug in the numbers.

p = 0.95 (A)
q = 0.04 (B)
r = 0.01 (O)

Compute each blood type's frequency:

1. O blood type (OO): r² = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 → 0.01% of the population.

2. A blood type (AA + AO): p² + 2pr = (0.95)^2 + 2*(0.95)*(0.01)
   Let's compute that:
   (0.95)^2 = 0.9025
   2pr = 2 * 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.019
   Sum: 0.9025 + 0.019 = 0.9215 → 92.15% A blood type.

3. B blood type (BB + BO): q² + 2qr = (0.04)^2 + 2*(0.04)*(0.01)
   Compute:
   (0.04)^2 = 0.0016
   2qr = 2 * 0.04 * 0.01 = 0.0008
   Sum: 0.0016 + 0.0008 = 0.0024 → 0.24% B blood type.

4. AB blood type (AB): 2pq = 2*(0.95)*(0.04) = 0.076 → 7.6% AB.

Wait, but let me check the sum of all blood type frequencies to make sure they add to 1.

O: 0.0001 (0.01%)
A: 0.9215 (92.15%)
B: 0.0024 (0.24%)
AB: 0.076 (7.6%)

Adding up: 0.0001 + 0.9215 = 0.9216; plus 0.0024 is 0.924; plus 0.076 is 1.000 exactly. So that checks out.

Now, the population is 424 individuals. So we can compute the number of people in each blood type by multiplying the frequency by 424.

Calculations:

O: 0.0001 * 424 = 0.0424 → approximately 0 people. But wait, 0.0424 is less than 0.5, so it would be 0. But let me check if it's possible to have a fraction here. Alternatively, maybe we should round to the nearest whole number.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake because the sum of all the calculated frequencies using the genotype approach should be exactly 1, so when multiplied by 424, the sum should be 424.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to first calculate all the genotype frequencies, then sum the genotypes that contribute to each blood type, multiply by 424, and round as necessary.

Wait, let me compute each blood type's count:

O blood type (OO): 0.0001 * 424 = 0.0424 → 0 people. But let's see: 0.0424 is 424 * 0.0001 = 0.0424, so that's about 0.04 people, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps we can round it to 0. But wait, the options have 1 person for O in option A, 5 in B, etc.

Wait, maybe I should check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each genotype's proportion, then their numbers.

Let me compute each genotype:

1. OO: r² = 0.01^2 = 0.0001 → 0.0424 people → 0

2. AA: p² = 0.95^2 = 0.9025 → 0.9025 *424 ≈ 382.46 → ~382 people

3. AO: 2pr = 2 *0.95 *0.01 = 0.019 → 0.019*424≈8.036 → ~8 people

4. AB: 2pq = 2*0.95*0.04 = 0.076 → 0.076*424≈32.224 → ~32 people

5. BB: q^2 = 0.04^2 = 0.0016 → 0.0016*424≈0.678 → ~1 person (0.678 rounds to 1)

6. BO: 2qr = 2*0.04*0.01= 0.0008 → 0.0008*424≈0.339 → ~0 people

Wait, but let's add up all these numbers:

OO: 0
AA: 382
AO:8
AB:32
BB:1
BO:0

Sum: 382 +8=390; 390+32=422; 422+1=423; 423+0=423. Hmm, but the total population is 424. So there's a discrepancy of 1 person. Did I make a mistake in rounding?

Let me recalculate each value more precisely.

Compute the exact numbers without rounding:

OO: 0.0001 *424 = 0.0424 → 0
AA: 0.9025 *424 = let's compute 0.9 *424 = 381.6, 0.0025*424=1.06 → total 382.66 → 383?
Wait, 0.9025 is 0.9 + 0.0025. 0.9*424= 381.6, 0.0025*424=1.06, so 381.6+1.06=382.66 → 383 when rounded.

AO: 0.019 *424 = 8.036 → 8

AB: 0.076*424 = 32.224 → 32

BB: 0.0016 *424= 0.6784 → 1

BO: 0.0008 *424=0.3392 → 0

So sum is 383 (AA) +8 (AO) = 391; 391 +32 (AB) =423; 423 +1 (BB) =424; 424 +0 (BO)=424. So that adds up correctly, but only if AA is 383.

Wait, but let me check the exact numbers again:

AA: 0.95^2 = 0.9025 → 0.9025 *424 = 0.9025 * 424.

Compute 0.9 *424 = 381.6; 0.0025 *424 = 1.06 → total 382.66, which is approximately 383.

So AA is 383, AO is 8, AB is 32, BB is 1, BO is 0, OO is 0.

Wait, but wait, the blood types are:

O: OO → 0 people
A: AA + AO → 383 +8 = 391
B: BB + BO →1 +0=1
AB: AB →32

Wait, but wait, that doesn't align with the options given. Because looking at the options, for example, option A is O=1, A=391, B=32, AB=0. Hmm, that doesn't match because in our calculation, AB is 32, B is 1, and O is 0.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the blood type B. Because in the initial approach, I considered that B blood type is BB and BO. But according to the earlier calculation, BB is 0.0016 *424 ≈ 0.6784 → 1 person, and BO is 0.0008 *424 ≈ 0.3392 → 0. So blood type B would have 1 person. But in the options, none of them have B as 1. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption of the allele frequencies is incorrect. The question states that the gene frequencies are for A, B, and O. So maybe I should think of A and B as the two dominant alleles, and O as recessive, and each person has two alleles, one from each parent.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the ABO system has codominant alleles for A and B, but O is recessive. So, the correct approach is to model the genotype frequencies as follows:

Each person can be:

- AA: frequency p² → A blood type
- AO: frequency 2pq → A blood type
- AB: frequency 2pr → AB blood type? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confusing this.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as each individual has two alleles, and for blood type:

- O: only when both alleles are O → frequency r²
- A: when at least one A allele (so AA, AO) → p² + 2pr
- B: when at least one B allele but no A alleles (so BB, BO) → q² + 2qr
- AB: when both A and B alleles are present → 2pq

Wait, that can't be right because if a person has AB, they have one A and one B allele, so their blood type is AB, which is distinct from A and B.

But in the ABO system, the presence of A and B alleles leads to AB blood type, not A or B. So the correct approach is:

- O: OO → r²
- A: AA and AO → p² + 2pr
- B: BB and BO → q² + 2qr
- AB: AB → 2pq

Wait, but earlier I used this approach and got the numbers, but the options don't match. Let me try recalculating.

Wait, let me compute the exact numbers again.

p = 0.95 (A), q = 0.04 (B), r = 0.01 (O)

Compute each blood type's frequency:

O: r² = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 → 424 * 0.0001 = 0.0424 → 0 people

A: p² + 2pr = (0.95)^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.01) = 0.9025 + 0.019 = 0.9215 → 424 * 0.9215 = ?

Compute 0.9215 * 424:

Well, 0.9 *424 = 381.6

0.0215 *424 = let's compute 0.02 *424 =8.48; 0.0015*424=0.636. So 8.48 +0.636=9.116

So total A blood type: 381.6 +9.116=390.716 → approximately 391 people.

B: q² + 2qr = (0.04)^2 + 2*(0.04)(0.01) = 0.0016 + 0.0008 = 0.0024 → 424 *0.0024=1.0176 → approximately 1 person.

AB: 2pq = 2*(0.95)(0.04) = 0.076 →
