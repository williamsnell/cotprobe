Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the difference between prejudice and discrimination. Hmm, I remember from my social studies class that these terms are related but not the same. Let me think through this.

Prejudice, I think, has to do with having a preconceived opinion or attitude about a group of people, usually negative. Like, maybe someone doesn't like a certain group without really knowing them. So it's more about thoughts or feelings.

On the other hand, discrimination is about actions, right? It's when you treat people unfairly or differently because of their race, gender, or other characteristics. So it's the behavior that results from those prejudiced attitudes.

Wait, so prejudice is the attitude, and discrimination is the action based on that attitude. That makes sense. So I'm looking for an option that says something like prejudice is an attitude and discrimination is the behavior that comes from it.

Looking at the options:

Option C says: Prejudice is an attitude, generally negative, held toward a group and its members. Discrimination is the action resulting from those views. That fits what I was thinking.

Other options don't seem right. Like option A talks about policies and economic outcomes, which isn't the direct definition. Option B mentions legal systems and individual choices, which doesn't quite capture the distinction between attitude and action. Option D reverses it, saying prejudice is behavior and discrimination is attitude—that's wrong.

So I'm pretty confident that option C is the correct answer.

The correct answer is option C because it accurately distinguishes prejudice as a negative attitude toward a group and discrimination as the resulting actions based on that prejudice.

Answer: C
