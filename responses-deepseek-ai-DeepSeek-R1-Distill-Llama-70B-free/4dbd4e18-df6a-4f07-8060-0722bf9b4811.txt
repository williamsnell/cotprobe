Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"My little homestead in the city, which I recently insured for ￡2,000 would no doubt have shared the common fate, as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this history question. Let's see what the question is about.

The question refers to a letter written during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. The author is a British citizen living in South Africa. He talks about his homestead being insured for £2,000, but the insurance won't cover damages caused by the Queen's enemies, which I think refers to the Zulu people. He also mentions a farm that's been partly destroyed and that he's suing the government for damages caused by 1,500 natives camping nearby.

The question is asking what incidents like these were used by the British government to do. The options are from A to J.

I remember that the Anglo-Zulu War was a real conflict between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. The British were expanding their colonial territories in Africa, and the Zulu Kingdom was resisting that expansion.

Looking at the letter, the author is experiencing problems because of the Zulu incursions. The British government would likely use such incidents as justification for taking action against the Zulu. So, what actions could that be?

Option A says issue a casus belli to go to war with the Zulu Kingdom. A casus belli is a reason to go to war. That makes sense because the British might use these attacks as a pretext to start a war.

Option B suggests forming an alliance with the Zulu against other tribes. That doesn't seem right because the British were more interested in taking over, not allying with the Zulu.

Option C is about taxing the Zulu to cover damages. That might happen after they've taken control, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate response.

Option D says forcing British citizens to leave. But the letter's author is already there, and the British were probably encouraging settlement, not evacuation.

Option E is giving independence to colonies, which doesn't fit because the British were expanding, not granting independence.

Option F is negotiating a peace treaty. But the letter is during the war, so maybe the government was not looking to negotiate but to take action.

Option G is increasing military presence. That's possible because if there were attacks, sending more troops would make sense.

Option H is about liberating Zulus from colonialism, which doesn't make sense because the British were the colonizers.

Option I is about severing responsibility to protect citizens. That doesn't seem right because the government would want to protect its citizens to maintain control.

Option J is establishing more colonies, which could be a long-term goal, but the immediate incident might be more about justifying military action.

So, considering all this, the British government likely used these incidents as a reason to go to war. So option A, issuing a casus belli, seems plausible. Alternatively, option G about increasing military presence is also a possibility.

Wait, but the question is about what the government did using these incidents. The letter describes damage and the author suing. The government might use this to justify military action. So both A and G could fit.

I think the casus belli would be the formal reason to start the war. The British might have already been looking for an excuse, and these incidents provided it. So option A is likely the answer.

Alternatively, increasing military presence (G) could be a consequence, but the question is what the government did as a result of these incidents—perhaps both, but I think the primary action was going to war, so the casus belli.

The question refers to a letter from a British citizen during the Anglo-Zulu War, describing damages caused by Zulu incursions. The British government likely used such incidents to justify military action. While increasing military presence (G) is plausible, the primary action would be issuing a casus belli (A) to formally start the war. 

Answer: A
