Question:

Albert Attorney was a solo practitioner in Littletown who operated a general law practice. In 1990, Albert drafted a document for a client's estate plan that unfortunately violated the rule against perpetuities. Upon the testator's death in 2004, the mistake was discovered. Because of the error, the estate plan was not admitted to probate so the assets were distributed under the state intestacy statute. Gordon Greedy was named as a substantial taker under the estate plan, but did not take under the intestate statute since he was not a relative. The state statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years. If Gordon sues Albert for professional malpractice in 2005, the best defense Albert can assert is

Options:

A: Albert did not intentionally make the mistake in the estate plan.
B: The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.
C: Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.
D: The error in the estate plan was due to a change in legislation.
E: The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand.
F: Albert Attorney was not practicing at the time of the testator's death.
G: Albert was not aware of the mistake until the testator's death.
H: The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.
I: Gordon Greedy was not a direct client of Albert Attorney.
J: Gordon Greedy was not a relative and therefore cannot sue for professional malpractice.

Okay, so I need to figure out the best defense Albert Attorney can use against Gordon Greedy's malpractice lawsuit. Let me start by going through the facts step by step.

Albert was a solo practitioner in Littletown with a general law practice. In 1990, he drafted an estate plan for a client, but he made a mistake that violated the rule against perpetuities. The testator died in 2004, and that's when the mistake was discovered. Because of this error, the estate plan wasn't admitted to probate, so the assets were distributed according to the state's intestacy statute.

Gordon Greedy was supposed to get a substantial amount under the estate plan but didn't get anything under the intestate statute because he's not a relative. Now, Gordon is suing Albert for professional malpractice in 2005. The state's statute of limitations for malpractice is three years.

I need to determine the best defense Albert can assert. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: Albert didn't intentionally make the mistake. But malpractice doesn't require intent; it's about negligence. So this probably isn't the best defense.

Option B: The statute of limitations has run. The statute is three years. The mistake was discovered in 2004 upon the testator's death. Gordon sued in 2005. So the three years would start from when the mistake was discovered. If the testator died in 2004, the limitations period would end in 2007. So suing in 2005 is within the time limit. So B might not be the best defense.

Wait, no, wait. When does the statute of limitations start? For legal malpractice, it usually starts when the client discovers the error or when the attorney-client relationship ends. Here, the mistake was discovered in 2004, so the three-year period would run from then. Gordon sued in 2005, which is within three years, so the statute hasn't run yet. So B isn't a valid defense.

Option C: Gordon wasn't an eligible taker under the estate plan. But the problem states he was a substantial taker, so this doesn't make sense. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The error was due to a change in legislation. There's no mention of any legislative change affecting the rule against perpetuities here. The mistake was Albert's drafting error, so D doesn't apply.

Option E: The rule against perpetuities is too complicated. That might relate to the standard of care. If the average lawyer in the area finds it complicated, maybe Albert's mistake isn't negligent. But generally, the rule against perpetuities is a well-known legal doctrine. I'm not sure if this is a strong defense. It's possible but maybe not the best option.

Option F: Albert wasn't practicing at the testator's death. The facts say he was a solo practitioner in 1990, but it doesn't say he retired or stopped practicing. So F is probably not applicable.

Option G: Albert wasn't aware until the testator's death. But the statute of limitations starts when the plaintiff discovers (or should have discovered) the mistake. Here, Gordon's claim is based on when the mistake was discovered, which was in 2004. So G doesn't help with the limitations period, as the suit was filed in 2005, which is timely.

Option H: The legal fee wasn't paid. I don't think that affects liability. Even if the fee wasn't paid, Albert can still be sued for malpractice. So H isn't a good defense.

Option I: Gordon wasn't a direct client. Wait, Gordon was a beneficiary under the estate plan, not the testator. So Albert's client was the testator. Generally, beneficiaries can sue for malpractice if they are the intended third-party beneficiaries. So I might be a possible defense, but some jurisdictions allow third parties to sue if they were intended beneficiaries.

Option J: Gordon wasn't a relative and can't sue. But the issue is whether he's a proper plaintiff. Some states allow intended beneficiaries to sue even if they're not relatives, especially if they were named in the estate plan. So J might not be a solid defense.

Wait, let me think again about the statute of limitations. When does the clock start ticking? The general rule is that the statute of limitations for legal malpractice begins when the client discovers the error, or when the attorney-client relationship ends. But for estate planning, the client is the testator. The testator died in 2004, so perhaps the attorney-client relationship ended then. So the limitations period would start in 2004. Gordon sued in 2005, which is within three years, so B wouldn't be a defense. So B is not the answer.

So the possible defenses are I and J. Let me consider whether a third party can sue. In many jurisdictions, a beneficiary may sue the attorney for malpractice if the testator is deceased. So if Gordon was an intended beneficiary, he might have standing. Therefore, Albert's best defense isn't based on I or J, unless the jurisdiction doesn't allow such suits.

But wait, the question is about the best defense. Another angle: causation. Did Albert's mistake actually cause Gordon's loss? Because if the estate plan wasn't probated, Gordon didn't get the assets. So Albert's error directly caused Gordon's loss, so causation is established.

Another point: privity of contract. The client was the testator. Gordon, as a beneficiary, might not have privity. But many courts now allow third-party beneficiaries to sue attorneys in certain circumstances, especially in estate planning where the attorney knows the beneficiary would rely on the plan.

So perhaps the best defense is that the statute of limitations hasn't run, but as we saw earlier, the suit was timely.

Wait, maybe the statute of limitations starts when the testator dies. So the testator died in 2004, and the limitations period runs from then. So the three years would end in 2007. Gordon sued in 2005, so it's timely. Therefore, B isn't valid.

So the next possible defense is I: Gordon wasn't a direct client. But if the law allows third-party beneficiaries to sue, then I isn't a good defense.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Another defense could be that the error didn't cause harm, but that's not the case here.

Looking back, the options:

The best defense is probably B, but I thought that the statute of limitations started in 2004, so 2005 is within three years. So B wouldn't work.

Wait, wait. The question says the statute of limitations is three years. When does it begin to run? For legal malpractice, it's typically when the client discovers or should have discovered the error. But in this case, the error was in the estate plan. The testator died in 2004, and the mistake was discovered then. So the three-year period would start in 2004. Gordon sued in 2005, which is within three years, so the statute hasn't run. So B isn't the defense.

So what's left?

Option I: Gordon wasn't a direct client. But in some cases, the intended beneficiary can sue. So if the jurisdiction allows it, then I isn't a good defense.

Is there another angle? Let's think about when the cause of action accrues. For the testator, the cause of action would have accrued when the mistake was made, but since the testator is dead, the beneficiary steps into the testator's shoes.

Alternatively, maybe the statute of limitations runs from when the testator could have sued, which would be when the mistake was made in 1990. If the testator had sued, the limitations period would have been three years from 1990. But the testator died in 2004, so perhaps the limitations period had already run by then. But that would be a different approach.

Wait, but the testator didn't sue. The mistake was discovered upon death. So the cause of action for malpractice would accrue at the testator's death, because that's when the mistake became apparent and caused harm. So the three-year period starts in 2004. Gordon sued in 2005, so it's timely.

So B isn't applicable.

Another approach: the statute of limitations for legal malpractice can sometimes be tolled until the end of the attorney-client relationship. But in this case, the relationship likely ended in 1990 when the estate plan was completed, unless there was an ongoing relationship. If the relationship ended in 1990, the three years would run from then, making the limitations period end in 1993. But Gordon sued in 2005, which is way beyond that. But that would mean the statute has run, making B the correct defense.

Wait, but when does the attorney-client relationship end? If Albert only drafted the document in 1990 and had no further contact, then the relationship ended in 1990. So the three-year period would start then, and end in 1993. Gordon sued in 2005, so the statute would have run. So B would be the best defense.

But wait, another rule: the "discovery rule." The statute of limitations starts when the client discovers or should have discovered the mistake. In this case, the mistake was discovered in 2004. So the three-year period starts then. Therefore, suing in 2005 is within the period.

So which approach is correct? It depends on the jurisdiction's rule. Some states start the limitations period when the mistake is discovered, others when the attorney-client relationship ends.

If the state follows the discovery rule, then B isn't a defense. If it follows the end of the relationship, then B would be a defense.

But the question doesn't specify. However, in many jurisdictions, the discovery rule applies. So the limitations period starts when the mistake is discovered, which was in 2004. So Gordon's 2005 lawsuit is timely, and B isn't a defense.

So I'm back to considering other options. Let's think about standing. Does Gordon have standing to sue?

In some jurisdictions, only the client (or their estate) can sue for malpractice. Beneficiaries may not have standing unless they can show they were intended third-party beneficiaries of the attorney-client relationship.

So if the jurisdiction requires privity, then Gordon, not being the client, cannot sue. So the best defense would be I or J.

Looking at the options, J says Gordon wasn't a relative and can't sue. But the ability to sue doesn't depend on being a relative; it's about being an intended beneficiary. So J might not be correct.

Option I says Gordon wasn't a direct client. If the jurisdiction requires privity, then I would be a valid defense. So if the jurisdiction doesn't allow third-party beneficiaries to sue, then I is the best defense.

But the question doesn't specify the jurisdiction's rule on this. However, in many states, intended third-party beneficiaries can sue attorneys for malpractice, especially in estate planning contexts.

So if the jurisdiction allows it, then I isn't a defense. But if it doesn't, then I is.

Since the question is about the best defense, and without specific jurisdictional info, perhaps the intended answer is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the testator's estate might have a claim, but Gordon is suing individually. If the statute of limitations for the testator's claim started in 1990 and ran out in 1993, then Gordon's claim, derivative of the testator's, would also be barred. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the best defense is that the statute of limitations started when the will was drafted, so it's expired. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again. The answer options are A to J.

The question is about the best defense. If the statute of limitations hasn't run, then B isn't a defense. So perhaps the best defense is that Gordon lacks standing because he's not the client. So the answer is I.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the error didn't cause damage because the rule against perpetuities might have been reformed, but the question doesn't mention that.

Another option: if the statute of limitations starts when the testator dies, then it's 2004, so 2005 is timely. So B is no good.

Hmm. I think the best answer is I: Gordon wasn't a direct client. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B, but I thought that wouldn't apply.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B. Let me think about when the cause of action accrues. In some cases, the cause of action for legal malpractice in estate planning accrues when the document is drafted, not when the mistake is discovered. Because the mistake was made in 1990, the three-year period would have ended in 1993. So Gordon's lawsuit in 2005 is too late. So B would be the defense.

But wait, that's only if the cause of action accrues at the time of the mistake, not discovery. Some jurisdictions follow the "occurrence rule," where the limitations period starts when the malpractice occurs, regardless of when it's discovered. Others follow the "discovery rule."

If the state follows the occurrence rule, then the limitations period would have started in 1990 and ended in 1993, making Gordon's 2005 lawsuit untimely. So B would be the correct defense.

But the question says the statute of limitations is three years, but doesn't specify when it starts. However, traditionally, for legal malpractice, many states follow the discovery rule, starting when the client discovers or should have discovered the error.

But without specific info, perhaps the question assumes that the limitations period starts when the mistake was made, making B the correct answer.

So I'm a bit torn, but I think the intended answer is B, the statute of limitations has run. But I'm not entirely sure because it depends on when the cause of action accrues.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that the mistake was discovered upon the testator's death in 2004. So the cause of action would accrue then, making the limitations period run from 2004. So suing in 2005 is within three years, so B isn't the defense.

In that case, perhaps the best defense is that Gordon isn't a client. So I would be the answer.

But I'm really not sure. I think I need to make a decision.

I think the correct answer is B because the statute of limitations started running when the mistake was made in 1990, and by 2005, it's way beyond three years. But wait, that's only if the state follows the occurrence rule. If it follows the discovery rule, then it's timely.

Since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is J: Gordon wasn't a relative. But I don't think that's correct because the ability to sue doesn't depend on being a relative, but rather on being an intended beneficiary.

Wait, another thought: in some jurisdictions, only the client or their estate can sue. So if the client has died, perhaps only the estate can sue, and Gordon as a beneficiary can't. So the defense would be that Gordon lacks standing because he's not the client or the estate.

Looking at the options, option I says Gordon wasn't a direct client. So that would be the defense. Therefore, the best defense is I.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'm going to go with I as the answer.

To determine the best defense Albert Attorney can assert against Gordon Greedy's malpractice lawsuit, we must analyze the facts and the provided options carefully.

### Key Facts:
1. **Timeline**: Albert drafted the estate plan in 1990, but the mistake was discovered upon the testator's death in 2004. Gordon sued in 2005.
2. **Statute of Limitations**: The state's statute of limitations for professional malpractice is three years.
3. **Gordon's Standing**: Gordon was a substantial beneficiary under the estate plan but not a relative, and he did not take under the intestate statute.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Albert did not intentionally make the mistake.  
  This is irrelevant because malpractice does not require intent; it is based on negligence. This is not a strong defense.

- **Option B**: The statute of limitations has run, so Gordon's lawsuit is not timely.  
  The statute of limitations typically starts when the mistake is discovered (the "discovery rule") or when the attorney-client relationship ends (the "occurrence rule"). Here, the mistake was discovered in 2004, and Gordon sued in 2005, which is within the three-year period if the discovery rule applies. However, if the jurisdiction follows the occurrence rule, the limitations period would have started in 1990 and expired in 1993, making Gordon's lawsuit untimely. The question does not specify which rule applies, but the discovery rule is more commonly applied in legal malpractice cases. Thus, this defense is weak.

- **Option C**: Gordon was not an eligible taker under the estate plan.  
  This is incorrect because Gordon was explicitly named as a substantial beneficiary under the estate plan.

- **Option D**: The error in the estate plan was due to a change in legislation.  
  There is no mention of any legislative change affecting the rule against perpetuities, so this is not applicable.

- **Option E**: The rule against perpetuities is too complicated for the average lawyer in the locality of Littletown to understand.  
  While the rule against perpetuities is complex, it is a well-established legal doctrine, and lawyers are expected to understand it. This is not a strong defense.

- **Option F**: Albert Attorney was not practicing at the time of the testator's death.  
  There is no indication that Albert stopped practicing law, so this is irrelevant.

- **Option G**: Albert was not aware of the mistake until the testator's death.  
  This does not affect the statute of limitations, as the limitations period starts when the mistake is discovered, not when the attorney becomes aware of it.

- **Option H**: The legal fee for the original estate plan was never paid.  
  Non-payment of fees does not negate liability for malpractice, so this is not a valid defense.

- **Option I**: Gordon Greedy was not a direct client of Albert Attorney.  
  Albert's client was the testator, not Gordon. However, in many jurisdictions, intended beneficiaries of an estate plan can sue for malpractice if they can show they were intended third-party beneficiaries. If the jurisdiction requires privity of contract, this could be a valid defense. This is a strong defense depending on the jurisdiction's rules.

- **Option J**: Gordon Greedy was not a relative and therefore cannot sue for professional malpractice.  
  The ability to sue does not depend on being a relative but on being an intended beneficiary. This is not a strong defense.

### Conclusion:
The best defense Albert can assert is **Option I**, as it challenges Gordon's standing to sue by arguing that he was not a direct client. This defense is particularly strong if the jurisdiction requires privity of contract for malpractice claims. While the statute of limitations (Option B) could be a defense
