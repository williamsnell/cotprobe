Question:

On May 19, a telephone operator for the local telephone company received a call in which a male voice said: "I want to report that the downtown sporting arena is going to be blown up tonight. " The caller then hung up. The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely

Okay, so I have this question about defamation, specifically slander, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a telephone operator who received a threatening call about a bomb. She reported it to the police, and later, a police officer called her from the home of the line's owner (a woman). He asked her to listen to a voice, and she identified it as the same person who made the threat. Because of this, the woman's boyfriend was arrested, lost his job, and faced embarrassment. But at trial, her identification was wrong, and the boyfriend was exonerated. Now, he's suing for slander.

So, the question is whether the boyfriend will succeed in his defamation action against the telephone operator and the telephone company.

First, I need to recall what slander is. Slander is a type of defamation that's spoken, as opposed to libel, which is written. For slander to be actionable, certain elements must be met. Generally, the statement must be false, defamatory, published to a third party, and cause harm.

But there are exceptions and privileges. One important concept is "qualified privilege," which applies when a statement is made in a situation where the person has a legitimate interest or duty, and the communication is in pursuit of that interest. For example, employer-employee references often fall under this. The statement is protected unless it's made with actual malice (knowing it's false or with reckless disregard for the truth).

In this case, the telephone operator reported the threat to the police, which seems like a situation where she had a duty to report a potential crime. Then, when the police asked her to identify the voice, she did so. Her statements were made in the context of her job and in the public interest to prevent a crime.

So, her initial report to the police was in good faith. Even if her identification was wrong, as long as she didn't act with actual malice, she might be protected by qualified privilege. The fact that she later testified in court and was wrong doesn't necessarily mean she was lying; she could have made an honest mistake.

Looking at the options, option A says the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest. That sounds plausible because she was acting in her role to report a crime.

Option B says it was without actual malice. That might be part of the analysis, but qualified privilege is more specific here.

Option C says it was a simple mistake. While that's true, the legal standard isn't just about mistakes but whether there was malice or if a privilege applies.

Option D says he'll succeed because of financial harm. But even if harm occurred, if the statement is privileged, that wouldn't necessarily lead to liability.

Option E says it's slander per se. Slander per se usually involves certain categories like accusing someone of a crime of moral turpitude, which this does. But even if it's per se, the qualified privilege could still apply.

Option F talks about loss of reputation. Again, that's a factor, but not the determining one if privilege applies.

Option G suggests reckless disregard for the truth. If she acted without malice and in good faith, this wouldn't apply.

Options H and I: H talks about public humiliation, which is a type of harm, but again, if the statement is privileged, that's not enough. I says she was acting in her employment, which ties into qualified privilege.

So, putting it together, the telephone operator was acting in a situation where she had a qualified privilege. She had a duty to report the threat, and the police were investigating. Her identification, although wrong, was made without malice because she was trying to help. So, the defamation claim would likely fail because of the qualified privilege.

The answer should be A.

The scenario involves a defamation action for slander brought by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company. The telephone operator received a threatening call, reported it to the police, and later identified the boyfriend's voice as the caller during a police investigation. However, her identification was later proven erroneous, leading to the boyfriend's exoneration. The key issue is whether the telephone operator's statements are protected by a qualified privilege.

A qualified privilege applies to statements made in situations where the speaker has a legitimate interest or duty, and the communication is in pursuit of that interest, provided the statement is not made with actual malice (knowing falsity or reckless disregard for the truth). Here, the telephone operator acted in good faith, reporting a potential crime and assisting the police. Her erroneous identification, while harmful, does not demonstrate actual malice but rather an honest mistake. Therefore, her statements are protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.

Other options, such as the boyfriend suffering financial harm or loss of reputation, are relevant to damages but do not overcome the protection of qualified privilege. Similarly, while the statement could constitute slander per se (accusing someone of a crime), the qualified privilege still applies absent actual malice.

Thus, the boyfriend will not succeed in his defamation action because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.
