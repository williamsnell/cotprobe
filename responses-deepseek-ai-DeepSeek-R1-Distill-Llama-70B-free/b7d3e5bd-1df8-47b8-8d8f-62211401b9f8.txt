Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about female pseudohermaphroditism. Hmm, I remember that pseudohermaphroditism has to do with the external genitalia not matching the gonadal sex. Let me think.

Wait, female pseudohermaphroditism would mean that the individual is genetically female (so XX chromosomes) but has some male secondary sexual characteristics. Oh right, because the gonads are ovaries, but the external stuff looks more male-like. So what conditions cause that?

I recall that Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a common cause. CAH leads to an overproduction of androgens because the adrenal glands aren't functioning properly. Since females with CAH are exposed to high levels of male hormones during fetal development, their external genitalia might become masculinized. So they'd have a female genotype (XX) but ambiguous or male-like genitals.

Looking at the options, option B is Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. That makes sense. Let me go through the other options to make sure.

Option A is Klinefelter syndrome. That's when males have an extra X chromosome (XXY), leading to male infertility and other issues. Not related to female pseudohermaphroditism.

Option C, Graves' disease is about hyperthyroidism. Not related here.

Option D, Turner syndrome is when females have only one X (XO), causing various physical issues. But Turner's doesn't cause male-like features; it's more about heart defects and short stature.

Option E, Campomelic dysplasia is a skeletal disorder, not related to sexual development in this way.

Option F, Androgen insensitivity syndrome is when a genetically male individual (XY) can't respond to androgens. So they develop female external features. That's male pseudohermaphroditism, not female.

Option G, Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting both males and females, causing heart issues and other features. Not related to this.

Option H, Marfan syndrome affects connective tissue, not sexual development.

Option I, Prader-Willi syndrome is about various physical and mental disabilities, not related to sexual ambiguity.

So the correct answer should be B: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Female pseudohermaphroditism refers to a condition where an individual is genetically female (XX) but exhibits male-like external genitalia due to excess androgen exposure during fetal development. Among the options provided, Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is the most common cause. CAH leads to an overproduction of androgens, resulting in the masculinization of external genitalia in genetically female individuals. 

Reviewing the other options:
- **A (Klinefelter syndrome)**: Affects males with an XXY karyotype, unrelated to female pseudohermaphroditism.
- **C (Graves' disease)**: Involves hyperthyroidism, not sexual development.
- **D (Turner syndrome)**: Characterized by an XO karyotype, causing short stature and other features, but not male-like genitalia.
- **E (Campomelic dysplasia)**: A skeletal disorder, unrelated to sexual development.
- **F (Androgen insensitivity syndrome)**: Causes male pseudohermaphroditism, not female.
- **G (Noonan syndrome)**: Affects both sexes, causing heart defects and other features, not sexual ambiguity.
- **H (Marfan syndrome)**: Involves connective tissue, unrelated to sexual development.
- **I (Prader-Willi syndrome)**: Associated with physical and mental disabilities, not sexual development.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia**.
