Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a completely submerged object and what it always displaces. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my science classes that when an object is submerged in a fluid, like water, it displaces some of that fluid. The term "displaces" here means pushing the fluid out of the way, right? So, the volume of the displaced fluid should be equal to the volume of the submerged part of the object. Oh wait, but the question specifies a completely submerged object, so that means the entire volume of the object is under the fluid.

Wait, what's displacement in this context? I think it's related to the principle of buoyancy. Oh right, Archimedes' principle! That's the one. So, according to that principle, the buoyant force on a submerged object is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.

But the question is about what the object displaces, not the force. So, the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that says "volume of fluid" directly. Let me check the options again.

The options are A through J. Option J is "volume of fluid." So that must be the correct answer. But wait, some other options mention weight or mass. Why isn't it about weight?

Oh, because displacement is about the volume. The weight of the displaced fluid is what causes the buoyant force, but the question is specifically about what's displaced. So the correct answer must be J: volume of fluid.

Wait, but another thought: the displaced fluid's weight equals the buoyant force. So could the answer be D: weight of fluid? No, because the question is about what's displaced, not the force. Displacement refers to the space taken up, not the weight. So the answer is definitely J.

I think I'm confident now. The answer should be J.

The correct answer is based on the principle that a completely submerged object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume. Among the options provided, the one that correctly reflects this is:

J: volume of fluid.

Answer: J
