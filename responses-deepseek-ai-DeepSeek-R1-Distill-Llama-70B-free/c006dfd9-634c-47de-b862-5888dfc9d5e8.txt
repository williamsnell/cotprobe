Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about family therapy and when it might be contraindicated. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is asking in which situation family therapy is probably not recommended. The options are A through G, each presenting a different scenario.

First, I need to understand what contraindicated means in this context. Contraindicated means that a particular treatment or therapy shouldn't be used because it might be harmful or not effective in that situation. So, I'm looking for the scenario where family therapy would not be the best approach or could even make things worse.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: One of the family members has severe depression. Hmm, family therapy can sometimes help when a family member is dealing with mental health issues because it can address the dynamics that might be contributing to the problem. But I'm not sure if severe depression would make family therapy a bad idea. Maybe if the individual is too unwell to participate effectively, but I'm not certain yet.

Option B: Family members are dealing with the loss of a loved one. Grief counseling often involves the family as a unit. Family therapy can help them support each other and process their loss together. So this doesn't seem contraindicated.

Option C: Family members attribute their problems to one of the members. Ah, this sounds like a situation where the family might be scapegoating one person. Family therapy could help them see that problems are systemic and not just one person's fault. But wait, if the family is too focused on blaming one member, could that make therapy difficult? Maybe the family isn't ready for therapy if they're not taking responsibility as a group. Or perhaps it's the opposite; family therapy could help shift that perspective. I'm not too sure yet.

Option D: The presenting problem involves sibling rivalry. Sibling rivalry is a common issue that family therapy often addresses. It helps improve communication and resolve conflicts between siblings. So this seems appropriate, not contraindicated.

Option E: The family has recently moved to a new city. Moving can cause stress and adjustment issues. Family therapy might help them adapt and support each other. So this doesn't seem like a reason to avoid family therapy.

Option F: The family is experiencing financial stress. Financial stress can affect family dynamics. Family therapy can help them cope and find ways to manage the stress together. So this is probably not contraindicated.

Option G: The presenting problem involves long-term marital conflict. Marital issues are often addressed in family therapy, especially when the conflict affects the whole family. However, if the marital conflict is severe, maybe couple therapy would be more appropriate first. But I'm not sure if it's contraindicated for family therapy.

Now, thinking again. The key here is to find the situation where family therapy would not be suitable. Let's consider each option again.

Option C: When family members attribute their problems to one member. This could indicate a lack of willingness to take responsibility or a dysfunctional family dynamic where one person is blamed for everything. In such cases, family therapy might not be effective, or it could even make the targeted member feel worse if the others aren't willing to change their perspective. Alternatively, a therapist might work with the family to address this, but maybe in some cases, individual therapy for the scapegoated member might be better initially.

Wait, another thought: family therapy works best when the family is willing to look at their interactions and take collective responsibility. If they're attributing problems to one person, they might resist the idea that it's a shared issue. This resistance could make family therapy challenging or ineffective, perhaps even harmful if the scapegoated individual feels attacked or unsupported.

So, putting it all together, the situation where family therapy is contraindicated is when the family attributes their problems to one member. That's option C.

Family therapy is generally effective in addressing various family dynamics and issues. However, it is contraindicated in situations where the family attributes their problems to one member, as this can indicate scapegoating or a lack of willingness to take collective responsibility. Such dynamics may make family therapy ineffective or potentially harmful to the targeted individual. 

Answer: C
