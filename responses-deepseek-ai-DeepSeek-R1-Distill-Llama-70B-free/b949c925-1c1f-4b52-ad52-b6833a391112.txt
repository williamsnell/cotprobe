Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex lens, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says again.

The problem states that there's a difference of 8 mm between the positions of an image when the object is at infinity and when it's 0.2 meters from the object-side of a convex lens. We need to find the focal length of the lens, and there are multiple-choice options given.

Hmm, I remember that for a convex lens, when an object is at infinity, the image forms at the focal point. So the image distance in that case is f, the focal length. Now, when the object is placed at a finite distance, like 0.2 meters here, the image distance changes. The difference between these two image positions is 8 mm.

Wait, so when the object is at infinity, image distance is f. When the object is at 0.2 m, the image distance is something else. The difference between these two is 8 mm. So I think the image moves either closer or further from the lens when the object is brought closer. Since the object is at a finite distance, the image would form beyond the focal point, right? No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. For a convex lens, when the object is at a finite distance greater than f, the image forms on the other side, but closer than when the object is at infinity? Or further? Wait, no, when the object is at a finite distance, the image is formed beyond the focal point. Because when the object is at infinity, the image is at f. When you bring the object closer, the image moves further away from the lens. So the image distance becomes longer than f. So the difference would be image distance (v) minus f equals 8 mm.

Wait, but I should think in terms of the lens formula. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where u is the object distance and v is the image distance. Here, u is 0.2 m, which is 200 mm. Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, the object is on the object side, so when the object is at 0.2 m, u is 0.2 m (positive, since it's a real object). So using that, we can find v when u is 0.2 m.

But wait, the problem says that the difference between the image positions when the object is at infinity and when it's at 0.2 m is 8 mm. So when the object is at infinity, 1/u is zero, so 1/f = 1/v → v = f. So that image is at f.

When the object is at 0.2 m, let's compute v. So using 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. So rearranged, 1/v = 1/f - 1/u. I can plug in u = 0.2 m, which is 200 mm if I'm working in mm. Let me see if I should convert units here. The answer options are in mm, so maybe working in mm is better.

Wait, but 0.2 m is 200 mm, which is 200 mm. So u is 200 mm.

So 1/v = 1/f - 1/200.

Then, the image distance when u is 200 mm is v. So the difference between v and f is 8 mm. Wait, but which is larger? Because when the object is at a finite distance, like u > f, the image is formed beyond f. So v would be greater than f. So the difference is v - f = 8 mm.

So v = f + 8.

Putting that into the equation:

1/(f + 8) = 1/f - 1/200.

Wait, let me write that down:

1/(f +8) = (1/f) - (1/200).

Hmm, solving for f here.

Let me rearrange the equation.

1/(f +8) = (200 - f) / (f * 200).

So cross-multiplying:

f * 200 = (200 - f)(f +8).

Expanding the right side:

(200)(f) + (200)(8) -f(f) -8f.

Wait, let's compute that:

200f + 1600 - f² -8f.

Combine like terms:

(200f -8f) +1600 -f² → 192f +1600 -f².

So the equation is:

200f = 192f +1600 -f².

Bring all terms to one side:

200f -192f -1600 +f^2 = 0 → 8f -1600 +f² = 0.

Rearranged: f² +8f -1600 = 0.

Wait, that's a quadratic equation in f. Let me write it as:

f² +8f -1600 = 0.

Hmm, solving using quadratic formula. So f = [-8 ± sqrt(8^2 +4*1600)] / 2.

Compute discriminant: 64 + 6400 = 6464.

Square root of 6464: Let me see. Hmm, 80^2 is 6400, so sqrt(6464) is a bit more than 80. Let's compute 80^2 = 6400, 80.4^2 = let's compute 80.4^2:

80 +0.4 → (80 +0.4)^2 = 80^2 + 2*80*0.4 +0.4^2 =6400 +64 +0.16=6464.16. Oh, that's very close to our discriminant of 6464.

So sqrt(6464) is approximately 80.4. But wait, 80.4^2 is 6464.16, which is 0.16 more than 6464, so perhaps it's 80.4 - a tiny bit. But for our purposes, it's approximately 80.4.

So f = [ -8 ±80.4 ] /2.

Since f must be positive, we take the positive solution: (-8 +80.4)/2 = 72.4/2=36.2 mm.

Wait, 36.2 mm. Looking at the options, option J is 36.2 mm.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, let me check the setup again. The difference between the two image positions is 8 mm. So when object is at infinity, image is at f. When object is at u=0.2 m, image is at v. Then, the difference is |v - f|=8 mm. And since for u> f (assuming u=0.2 m is greater than f, which would be the case if f is less than 0.2 m, which it is, as 36.2 mm is 0.0362 m <0.2 m), then v is greater than f, so v -f =8.

So the setup seems correct.

Let me recheck the equation:

1/f = 1/v + 1/u → 1/v =1/f -1/u.

v= 1/(1/f -1/u) → but wait, I used v= f +8. Is that correct?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me denote the image distance when object is at infinity as v1 =f. The image distance when object is at u=0.2 m is v2. The difference between v2 and v1 is |v2 -v1|=8 mm.

Since when the object is brought closer than infinity, the image moves further away, so v2 >v1 → v2 -v1=8 → v2 =v1 +8= f +8.

So the equation is correct.

So substituting v2 =f +8 into the lens formula:

1/f = 1/(f+8) + 1/0.2.

Wait, wait! Oh, wait, I just realized I might have made a mistake in units earlier. Because in the initial substitution, I used u=200 mm, but when I wrote the equation, perhaps I should have been consistent with units.

Wait, let's try using meters instead of mm to avoid confusion.

So u is 0.2 m, so 1/u is 5 m^-1.

f is in meters, let's denote it as f meters.

v is f + 0.008 meters (since 8 mm is 0.008 m).

So the lens equation is 1/f = 1/(f +0.008) + 5.

Let me write that equation again:

1/f = 1/(f + 0.008) + 5.

Hmm, let's compute this.

Let me subtract 1/(f+0.008) from both sides:

1/f - 1/(f+0.008) =5.

Combine the fractions:

[(f +0.008) - f ] / [f(f+0.008)] =5.

Simplify numerator: 0.008 / [f^2 +0.008 f] =5.

So 0.008 =5 [f^2 +0.008 f ].

Multiply both sides by 0.2 to make the numbers smaller. Wait, perhaps better to write as:

0.008 =5 f² + 0.04 f.

Bring all terms to one side:

5 f² +0.04 f -0.008 =0.

Multiply both sides by 1000 to eliminate decimals:

5000 f² +40 f -8 =0.

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Alternatively, let's write it as:

5 f² + 0.04 f - 0.008 =0.

Using the quadratic formula:

f = [ -0.04 ± sqrt( (0.04)^2 +4*5*0.008 ) ] / (2*5).

Compute discriminant:

(0.04)^2 = 0.0016.

4*5*0.008= 0.16.

So discriminant is 0.0016 +0.16=0.1616.

sqrt(0.1616)=0.402.

So f = [ -0.04 ±0.402 ]/(10).

We take the positive solution: ( -0.04 +0.402 ) /10 = 0.362 /10=0.0362 m → 36.2 mm.

So that confirms the earlier result. So the correct answer is J:36.2 mm.

Wait, let me double-check the setup again because sometimes the difference could be absolute, but in this case, since v increases when u is finite, the difference is positive.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the two scenarios described:

1. **When the object is at infinity**: For a convex lens, the image forms at the focal point, so the image distance is \( v_1 = f \), where \( f \) is the focal length of the lens.

2. **When the object is at \( u = 0.2 \, \text{m} \)**: The image distance \( v_2 \) is related to the object distance \( u \) and the focal length \( f \) through the lens formula:
   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v_2} + \frac{1}{u}.
   \]
   Rearranging for \( v_2 \), we get:
   \[
   v_2 = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u}}.
   \]

The problem states that the difference between the image distances in these two cases is \( |v_2 - v_1| = 8 \, \text{mm} \). Since the image moves further from the lens when the object is brought closer, we have:
\[
v_2 > v_1 \quad \text{and} \quad v_2 - v_1 = 8 \, \text{mm}.
\]
Thus:
\[
v_2 = f + 8.
\]

### Substituting into the lens formula
Substituting \( v_2 = f + 8 \) into the lens formula:
\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f + 8} + \frac{1}{u}.
\]
Converting \( u = 0.2 \, \text{m} \) to millimeters, \( u = 200 \, \text{mm} \), so:
\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{f + 8} + \frac{1}{200}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\frac{1}{f + 8} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{200}.
\]
Combining the terms on the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{f + 8} = \frac{200 - f}{f \cdot 200}.
\]
Cross-multiplying:
\[
f \cdot 200 = (200 - f)(f + 8).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
200f = 200f + 1600 - f^2 - 8f.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
f^2 + 8f - 1600 = 0.
\]

### Solving the quadratic equation
The quadratic equation is:
\[
f^2 + 8f - 1600 = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
f = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 8 \), and \( c = -1600 \). Substituting:
\[
f = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(-1600)}}{2}.
\]
\[
f = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64 + 6400}}{2}.
\]
\[
f = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{6464}}{2}.
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{6464} \approx 80.4 \):
\[
f = \frac{-8 + 80.4}{2} = \frac{72.4}{2} = 36.2 \, \text{mm}.
\]

### Final Answer
The focal length of the lens is **36.2 mm**, which corresponds to option **J**.
