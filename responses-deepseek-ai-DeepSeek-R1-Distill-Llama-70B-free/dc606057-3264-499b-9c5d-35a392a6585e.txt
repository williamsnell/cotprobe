Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these Gibbs free energy calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The reaction given is CH4(g) + H2O(g) ⇌ CO(g) + 3H2(g). I need to find the standard Gibbs free energy change for this reaction at 25°C. The data provided includes the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°) for each substance involved. 

First, I remember that the Gibbs free energy change for a reaction is calculated using the formula: ΔG° = ΔH°(reaction) - TΔS°(reaction). Both ΔH° and ΔS° are in kcal per mole and cal per mole respectively, so I have to make sure the units match.

Wait, right. ΔH° for the reaction is calculated by summing the ΔHf° of the products and subtracting the sum of the reactants. Same goes for the entropy change.

So let's list out the data again:

ΔH° (kcal/mol):
CH4(g): -17.89
H2O(g): -57.80
CO(g): -26.40
H2(g): 0

ΔS° (cal/(mol·K)):
CH4(g): 44.5
H2O(g): 45.1
CO(g): 47.3
H2(g): 31.2

Wait, the units for ΔS are in cal/(K·mol), and ΔH is in kcal/mol. Since 1 kcal is 1000 cal, I'll need to convert either ΔH or ΔS to have the same units. I think it's easier to convert ΔS to kcal so that when I multiply by T (which is in Kelvin), I can subtract properly.

The temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K. So T is 298 K.

First, let's calculate ΔH° for the reaction.

ΔH°_rxn = [CO + 3 H2] - [CH4 + H2O]

So substituting the values:

ΔH°_rxn = [(-26.40) + 3*(0)] - [(-17.89) + (-57.80)]
= (-26.40 + 0) - (-75.69)
= (-26.40) + 75.69
= 49.29 kcal/mol.

Wait wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Because the reaction is CH4 + H2O → CO + 3H2. So products are CO and 3 moles of H2.

So ΔH°(products) is [1*(-26.40) + 3*(0)] = -26.40.

ΔH°(reactants) is [(-17.89) + (-57.80)] = -75.69.

So ΔH°_rxn = (-26.40) - (-75.69) = 49.29 kcal/mol. Yes, that's correct.

Now for the entropy part, ΔS°_rxn.

ΔS°_rxn = [CO + 3 H2] - [CH4 + H2O]

Plugging in the numbers:

= [47.3 + 3*(31.2)] - [44.5 + 45.1]

Calculate each part:

Products: 47.3 + 93.6 = 140.9 cal/(mol·K)
Reactants: 44.5 +45.1 =89.6 cal/(mol·K)
So ΔS°_rxn = 140.9 -89.6 =51.3 cal/(mol·K)

But wait, I need to convert this to kcal because ΔH is in kcal. Since 1 cal = 0.001 kcal, so 51.3 cal/(mol·K) is 0.0513 kcal/(mol·K).

Wait no, actually, because when we multiply by T, which is in K, let's see. The formula is ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. So if ΔH is in kcal/mol, and TΔS is in cal/mol, we should convert either one to the same unit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert ΔS from cal/(mol·K) to kcal/(mol·K) by dividing by 1000.

So ΔS°_rxn = 51.3 cal/(mol·K) = 51.3 / 1000 kcal/(mol·K) = 0.0513 kcal/(mol·K).

Then TΔS° is 298 K * 0.0513 kcal/(mol·K) = ?

Let me calculate that:

298 * 0.0513 = Let's see:

300 * 0.0513 = 15.39, but since it's 298, subtract 2 * 0.0513: 0.1026

So 15.39 - 0.1026 = 15.2874 ≈15.287 kcal/mol.

Wait, wait. Wait, 298 is approximately 300-2. So 0.0513 *298.

Alternatively, 0.0513 * 300 is 15.39. Then minus 0.0513 *2 = 0.1026. So 15.39 -0.1026 =15.2874.

So about 15.287 kcal/mol.

So now, ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° = 49.29 kcal/mol -15.287 kcal/mol.

Which is 49.29 -15.287 = 34.003 kcal/mol, approximately 34.0 kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 34 kcal/mol. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

ΔH°_rxn:

Products: CO (-26.40) + 3 H2 (0) → sum is -26.40.

Reactants: CH4 (-17.89) + H2O (-57.80) → sum is -75.69.

ΔH°_rxn = (-26.40) - (-75.69) = 49.29. Correct.

ΔS°_rxn:

Products: CO (47.3) + 3*(31.2) =47.3 +93.6=140.9.

Reactants: CH4 (44.5) + H2O (45.1)=89.6.

ΔS°_rxn =140.9 -89.6=51.3.

TΔS° in kcal: 298 K *51.3 cal/(mol·K) = 298 *51.3 = let me compute that in cal first.

51.3 * 298:

Compute 50*298=14,900. Then 1.3*298=388.4. Sum: 14,900 +388.4=15,288.4 cal/mol.

Convert to kcal: 15,288.4 cal =15.2884 kcal.

So TΔS°=15.2884 kcal/mol.

ΔG° =49.29 -15.2884 =34.0016 ≈34.0 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 34 kcal/mol. So that's the right answer.

I should check if I mixed up products and reactants. The reaction is CH4 + H2O → CO +3H2. So products are CO and H2, reactants are CH4 and H2O.

Yes, the way I calculated ΔH° and ΔS° is correct.

To calculate the standard Gibbs free-energy change (ΔG°) for the reaction:

**CH₄(g) + H₂O(g) ⇌ CO(g) + 3H₂(g)**  

we use the formula:  
**ΔG° = ΔH°(reaction) - TΔS°(reaction)**  

### Step 1: Calculate ΔH° for the reaction
ΔH° for the reaction is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \left[\Delta H^\circ_{\text{products}}\right] - \left[\Delta H^\circ_{\text{reactants}}\right]
\]  
Substituting the given data:  
- **Products:** CO = -26.40 kcal/mol, H₂ = 0 kcal/mol (3 moles × 0 = 0)  
  \[
  \Delta H^\circ_{\text{products}} = -26.40 + 0 = -26.40 \, \text{kcal/mol}
  \]  
- **Reactants:** CH₄ = -17.89 kcal/mol, H₂O = -57.80 kcal/mol  
  \[
  \Delta H^\circ_{\text{reactants}} = -17.89 + (-57.80) = -75.69 \, \text{kcal/mol}
  \]  
Thus:  
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = -26.40 - (-75.69) = 49.29 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate ΔS° for the reaction
ΔS° for the reaction is calculated as:  
\[
\Delta S^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \left[\Delta S^\circ_{\text{products}}\right] - \left[\Delta S^\circ_{\text{reactants}}\right]
\]  
Substituting the given data:  
- **Products:** CO = 47.3 cal/(mol·K), H₂ = 31.2 cal/(mol·K) (3 moles × 31.2 = 93.6)  
  \[
  \Delta S^\circ_{\text{products}} = 47.3 + 93.6 = 140.9 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}
  \]  
- **Reactants:** CH₄ = 44.5 cal/(mol·K), H₂O = 45.1 cal/(mol·K)  
  \[
  \Delta S^\circ_{\text{reactants}} = 44.5 + 45.1 = 89.6 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}
  \]  
Thus:  
\[
\Delta S^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = 140.9 - 89.6 = 51.3 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}
\]  

### Step 3: Convert ΔS° to kcal/(mol·K)
Since ΔH° is in kcal/mol, ΔS° must also be in kcal/(mol·K) for consistency.  
\[
\Delta S^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \frac{51.3 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}}{1000} = 0.0513 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate TΔS°
The temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K.  
\[
T\Delta S^\circ = 298 \, \text{K} \times 0.0513 \, \text{kcal/(mol·K)} = 15.287 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate ΔG°
Now, substitute the values into the Gibbs free-energy equation:  
\[
\Delta G^\circ = \Delta H^\circ - T\Delta S^\circ
\]  
\[
\Delta G^\circ = 49.29 \, \text{kcal/mol} - 15.287 \, \text{kcal/mol} = 34.003 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]  

### Final Answer
The standard Gibbs free-energy change for the reaction is approximately **34 kcal/mol**, which corresponds to **option A**.
