Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the 'Lotus principle' in international law. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Lotus principle comes from a case involving the SS Lotus, a French ship that collided with a Turkish vessel. The case went to the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), right? The main issue was about jurisdictionâ€”specifically, whether Turkey had the right to try the French officer in charge of the Lotus. 

From what I recall, the PCIJ ruled in favor of Turkey. The decision was based on the idea that international law doesn't prohibit states from exercising jurisdiction unless there's a specific rule against it. So, the principle is more about the freedom of states to act unless explicitly restricted by international law. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says customary law is superior to treaty law. I don't think that's correct because the Lotus case was more about jurisdiction and the sources of international law, not about which source is superior.

Option B talks about intervening in internal affairs for national security. That sounds more like the principle of non-intervention or maybe the Caroline doctrine, not the Lotus principle.

Option C mentions applying domestic laws in disputes. While the case did involve jurisdiction, the Lotus principle is broader than just applying laws; it's about what's permitted under international law.

Option D says international law governs relations between states, not individuals. That's a general principle, but I don't think it's specific to the Lotus case. The Lotus case was about state jurisdiction, not about who international law applies to.

Option E is about unlimited jurisdiction over citizens. That's part of the concept of nationality jurisdiction, but the Lotus case was about whether a state could exercise jurisdiction over a foreign national on the high seas, which relates to enforcement jurisdiction, not just over their own citizens.

Option F suggests ignoring international law without infringing sovereignty. That doesn't fit because the Lotus principle is about what's allowed under international law, not ignoring it.

Option G states that restrictions on state independence can't be presumed, and whatever isn't prohibited is permitted. That rings a bell. The Lotus case is often cited for the idea that states are free to do what international law doesn't explicitly prohibit. So this seems right.

Option H is about enforcing jurisdiction on the high seas. While the case involved the high seas, the broader principle is about the permissibility of actions under international law, not just jurisdiction on the high seas.

Option I is about customary law deriving from state practice and opinio juris. That's a general definition of customary law, not the Lotus principle.

Option J is about choosing which court to submit disputes to, which doesn't relate to the Lotus principle.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be option G. It's the one that captures the essence of the Lotus principle, which is that states can act unless international law explicitly prohibits it.

The 'Lotus principle' stems from the SS Lotus case, where the PCIJ ruled that international law does not prohibit states from exercising jurisdiction unless explicitly restricted. This principle emphasizes that states are free to act unless international law explicitly forbids it. Among the options, the correct one is:

G: The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law.'

Answer: G
