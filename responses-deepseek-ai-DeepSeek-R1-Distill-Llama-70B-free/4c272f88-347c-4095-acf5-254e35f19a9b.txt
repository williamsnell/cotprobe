Okay, so I've got this problem about an internal-combustion engine connected to a grinding disc via a roller chain. I need to find out the number of teeth on both sprockets and the type of lubrication required. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the engine is 15 hp and runs at 1400 rpm. The grinding disc is at 700 rpm. Oh wait, so the engine speed is higher than the grinding disc. That means the engine is the driving unit, and the disc is the driven. So the driving sprocket is connected to the engine, and the driven is on the disc.

I remember that in chain drives, the speed ratio is inversely proportional to the number of teeth on the sprockets. So the ratio is (N_driver / N_driven) = (speed of driven / speed of driver). Wait, wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. Because if the driver has more teeth, it turns slower. So the speed ratio is (speed_driver / speed_driven) = (number of teeth driven / number of teeth driver). Or maybe it's (driver teeth/driven teeth) = (driven speed / driver speed). Hmm, I might be mixing this up.

Let me think. If the driving sprocket has more teeth, each revolution would take more chain, so the driven sprocket would have to turn more. No, wait, no. When the driver has more teeth, each tooth meshes with the chain for a longer time, so the driven sprocket will turn slower. So higher number of teeth on the driver means lower speed on the driven. So the formula for the ratio is (N_driver / N_driven) = (speed_driven / speed_driver). Or maybe it's the reciprocal. Let me get this straight.

The formula I remember is:

speed_driver / speed_driven = N_driven / N_driver

So the ratio is (driver speed / driven speed) = (driven teeth / driver teeth)

So in this problem, driver speed is 1400 rpm, driven is 700 rpm.

So 1400 / 700 = N_driven / N_driver → 2 = N_driven / N_driver → So N_driven = 2 * N_driver.

So the driven sprocket has twice as many teeth as the driver. That makes sense because the driven is moving slower, so it needs more teeth to make the chain wrap more, leading to lower speed.

Now, looking at the options, we need to find a pair where the driven is twice the driver. Let's scan through the options.

Option A: 11 and 22 → yes, 22 is 2x11. That fits.

Option B: 7 and 14 → yes, 14 is 2x7.

C: 6 and 12 → yes.

D:14 and 28 → yes.

E:15 and 30 → yes.

F:12 and24 → yes.

G:9 and18 → yes.

H:13 and26 → yes.

I:8 and16 → yes.

J:10 and20 → yes.

So all the options fit the ratio except maybe none, since all have a 2:1 ratio. Hmm, so I can't eliminate any based on the ratio.

Next part: the chain type. It says it's a triple strand no. 50 roller chain. So triple strand means higher power capacity. But I'm not sure how that affects the sprocket teeth.

Wait, maybe I should think about the minimum number of teeth for a sprocket. The minimum number of teeth on a sprocket depends on the chain type. For a roller chain, the minimum is usually around 6 teeth for small chains, but for heavier chains like no.50, perhaps higher. Wait, no.50 is a bigger chain, so maybe the minimum is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum number is determined by the pitch and the sprocket's design.

Wait, but looking at the options, the smallest driver sprockets are 6 teeth (option C), 7 (B), 8 (I), etc. So perhaps the minimum is 6 for no.50? Or maybe not.

Wait, another thought: the number of teeth determines the pitch diameter. A smaller number of teeth would mean a smaller diameter. But for a roller chain, there's a minimum number of teeth to prevent the chain from binding and to ensure proper meshing. For no.50 chain, which is a heavy-duty chain, the minimum is usually higher. I've heard that typically, the minimum number for a chain is 12 teeth, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe for a no.50 chain, the minimum is 10 teeth? Because smaller sprockets might cause the chain to wear more or jump.

Looking back at the options, let's see which options have sprockets above a certain minimum. For example, if the minimum is 10 teeth, then options with driver sprockets less than 10 would be invalid. Let's check each option.

Option A: 11 teeth on driver → okay if the minimum is 10.

Option B: 7 teeth → if min is 10, this is invalid.

Option C:6 → invalid.

D:14 → ok.

E:15 → ok.

F:12 → ok.

G:9 → if min is 10, invalid.

H:13 → ok.

I:8 → invalid.

J:10 → ok.

So if the minimum is 10 teeth, options B, C, G, I are out. So possible options are A, D, E, F, H, J.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the minimum number of teeth. Another approach: perhaps the number of teeth should be such that the sprockets don't have too small a diameter. Because the pitch of a no.50 chain is larger than smaller chains. The pitch for no.50 roller chain is 0.5 inches between the centers of the pins. Wait, no, I think for roller chains, the number refers to the pitch in eighths of an inch. So no.50 is 50/8 = 6.25 inches pitch? That can't be right. Wait, no, wait. I think the numbering is different. Like, ANSI chain number is based on the pitch. For example, no.50 chain has a pitch of 0.625 inches (since 50 divided by 8 is 6.25, but that's probably not right). Wait, wait, no. The chain number is equal to the pitch in eighths of an inch. So no.50 is 50/8 = 6.25 inches? That seems too big. Maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, maybe chain number is in the format of something else. Oh wait, roller chain numbers like 40, 50, 60 refer to the pitch as 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 inches respectively? Because I remember that a 40 chain is 1 inch pitch, 50 is 1.25, 60 is 1.5.

So no.50 has a pitch of 1.25 inches. The minimum number of teeth for a sprocket is determined by the pitch and the desired diameter. The formula for the minimum number of teeth (N) is such that the pitch diameter (D) is at least 5 times the pitch (p). So D ≥ 5p. Since D = (N * p)/2, we can write (N * p)/2 ≥ 5p → N ≥ 10 teeth. So for a no.50 chain with p=1.25 inches, the minimum number of teeth is 10.

So the driving sprocket must have at least 10 teeth. That means any option where the driving sprocket is less than 10 is invalid. So options B, C, G, I have driver sprockets of 7,6,9,8 teeth respectively. So these are invalid. So the possible options are A, D, E, F, H, J.

So now, looking at these options, let's see which have the correct ratio. As before, the ratio is 2:1 (driven is twice the driver).

So among these:

A: 11 and 22 → 2:1.

D:14 and 28 → 2:1.

E:15 and30 → 2:1.

F:12 and24 → 2:1.

H:13 and26 → 2:1.

J:10 and20 → 2:1.

All are correct in terms of ratio.

Now, the next part is the type of lubrication needed for rust-proof operation.

The question says it's a triple strand chain. So in such cases, the lubrication method is important. Roller chains can be lubricated in different ways. The main types are:

- Type A: Manual or drip lubrication.

- Type B: Bath or splash lubrication.

- Type C: Drip lubrication with a trough.

- Type D: Forced-feed lubrication system.

- Type E: Oil stream from a pump.

But wait, perhaps the options are labeled differently. The question mentions “rust-proof operation” which suggests that the lubrication should protect against rust, perhaps using a lubricant that has rust-inhibiting properties.

Wait, but another point is that for multiple strand chains, especially triple strand, an effective lubrication method is needed to ensure that all strands are properly lubricated. So a forced feed system (like type D) would be better because it ensures more consistent oil application across all strands.

Alternatively, for heavy-duty applications like triple strand chains, bath lubrication (like type B) is sometimes used, where the chain runs through a lubricant bath. But for some configurations, particularly where the chain is enclosed, a forced feed system would be preferred.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. For multiple-strand chains, especially in high-power applications, forced feed lubrication is often used because it delivers oil under pressure to all parts of the chain. So the type D lubrication would be appropriate.

Looking at the options, which ones have type D?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Lubrication type D.

Option E: Lubrication D.

Option H: Lubrication A.

Others:

A: B

D: A

F: C

J: A.

Wait, so in the remaining options (A, D, E, F, H, J), which have type D? Option B was already out because driver is 7, but option E is in consideration.

Wait, our current options are A, D, E, F, H, J.

Looking at their lubrication:

A: B

D: A

E: D

F: C

H: A

J: A.

Only option E and B (but B is already out) have lubrication type D.

Wait, but E is in the current possible options. So if the correct lubrication is type D, then option E is the one.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says "rust-proof operation". So the lubricant should prevent rust. But I'm not sure if the type of lubrication (A, B, etc.) refers to the method (like bath, forced feed) or the type of oil (like grease, oil with rust inhibitors). Maybe the question is more about the method.

In any case, for triple-strand chains, forced feed (type D) is often used because it ensures better lubrication, especially on all strands.

So among the options, only E and B have D as the lubrication. But B is out because driver is 7. So E is the only one left with D.

So option E is driving sprocket 15, driven 30, and lubrication D. Let's see if that fits.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Another point is the horsepower. The engine is 15 hp, and the chain is transmitting that power. So the sprockets must be appropriately sized to handle the power without the chain slipping or breaking.

The power transmitted by a chain depends on the chain's speed, the number of strands, the pitch, the sprocket sizes, and the lubrication. But I'm not sure if the given options include any consideration of the power. Or perhaps the calculation is just about the speed ratio and the lubrication, and the sprocket sizes are determined by that.

Hmm. Another approach is to check if the number of teeth is correct for a 15 hp engine. But without the specific charts or formulas for chain power capacity, I can't calculate that here. So perhaps the answer is option E.

Wait, but let me think again. The driver is the engine sprocket, which is 15 teeth, and the driven is 30. So 15:30 is 1:2 ratio. So the engine runs at 1400 rpm → the disc runs at 700 rpm. That matches the given data.

So if E is an option, then E would be correct if the lubrication is type D.

But wait, what do the lubrication types correspond to? The options in the problem are labeled A to J, with each providing three parts: driver teeth, driven teeth, lubrication.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: 15, 30, D.

So if the correct answers are 15 and 30 teeth, and lubrication D, then E is correct.

But wait, I thought the minimum number of teeth is 10. 15 is above that, so that's fine.

Another point: sometimes in chain drives, the number of teeth should be an integer ratio, which it is here (30/15=2).

So putting it all together, the correct answer would have the driven sprocket twice the driver, the driver at least 10 teeth, and the lubrication type D.

So the correct option is E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teeth on the driving and driven sprockets, as well as the type of lubrication required for rust-proof operation. The engine runs at 1400 rpm, while the grinding disc runs at 700 rpm, indicating a 2:1 speed ratio. For chain drives, the speed ratio is inversely proportional to the number of teeth on the sprockets, meaning the driven sprocket must have twice as many teeth as the driving sprocket.

### Step 1: Sprocket Teeth Calculation
The speed ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{\text{Speed of Driver}}{\text{Speed of Driven}} = \frac{\text{Number of Teeth on Driven}}{\text{Number of Teeth on Driver}}
\]

Substituting the given speeds:

\[
\frac{1400}{700} = \frac{\text{Number of Teeth on Driven}}{\text{Number of Teeth on Driver}} \implies 2 = \frac{\text{Number of Teeth on Driven}}{\text{Number of Teeth on Driver}}
\]

Thus, the driven sprocket must have twice as many teeth as the driving sprocket. Scanning the options, all have a 2:1 ratio, so this criterion alone does not eliminate any options.

### Step 2: Minimum Number of Teeth
For a no. 50 roller chain, the minimum number of teeth on a sprocket is typically 10, as smaller sprockets may not provide sufficient chain wrap or may lead to premature wear. This eliminates options where the driving sprocket has fewer than 10 teeth:

- **Eliminated Options**: B (7 teeth), C (6 teeth), G (9 teeth), I (8 teeth).

### Step 3: Lubrication Type
The problem specifies a triple-strand chain and rust-proof operation. For triple-strand chains, forced-feed lubrication (Type D) is typically recommended, as it ensures consistent lubrication across all strands and helps prevent rust.

### Step 4: Final Selection
From the remaining options (A, D, E, F, H, J), only **Option E** specifies lubrication Type D, which is appropriate for rust-proof operation. Additionally, Option E has a driving sprocket of 15 teeth and a driven sprocket of 30 teeth, satisfying the 2:1 ratio and the minimum teeth requirement.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

**E: Driving sprocket = 15 teeth, Driven sprocket = 30 teeth, Lubrication type = D**
