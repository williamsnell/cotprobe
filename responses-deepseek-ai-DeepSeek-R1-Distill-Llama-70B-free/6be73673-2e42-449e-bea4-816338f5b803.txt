Okay, I've got this question here about group theory, which I remember is a part of abstract algebra. So the question says that the set of integers Z with a binary operation "*" defined as a * b = a + b + 1 for any a and b in Z. And it's stated that this forms a group. The question is asking for the identity element of this group, with options from A to J.

Hmm, I need to find the identity element. From what I remember, an identity element 'e' in a group is an element such that for any element a in the group, the operation a * e equals a. So, in terms of this operation, a * e = a + e + 1 = a. 

Wait, let me think again. The operation here is a * b = a + b + 1. So for the identity element e, when I perform a * e, it should equal a. So substituting into the operation, a + e + 1 should equal a. 

Let me write that equation: a + e + 1 = a. If I subtract a from both sides, I get e + 1 = 0. So solving for e, that gives e = -1. So the identity element should be -1.

Looking at the options, option A is -1. So I think the answer is A.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the steps. The definition of identity is that when you operate any element a with e, you get a. So a * e = a. Substituting into the given operation: a + e + 1 = a. Subtract a from both sides: e +1 = 0 → e = -1. Yep, that seems correct.

I also recall that for a group, the identity element must satisfy this condition for all elements in the set. Since Z is the set of all integers, which is infinite, but the operation is consistent, so e should be the same for all elements. So yes, -1 makes sense.

Another thing to consider: does this operation actually form a group? Well, the question states that it's a group, so I don't need to verify the group axioms here. But just to be thorough, in case I made an error, let's quickly check closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.

Closure: If a and b are integers, then a * b = a + b +1 is also an integer. So closure holds.

Associativity: Let's see, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). Let's compute both.

Left side: (a * b) * c = (a + b + 1) * c = (a + b +1) + c + 1 = a + b + c + 2.

Right side: a * (b * c) = a * (b + c + 1) = a + (b + c +1) +1 = a + b + c + 2.

So both sides are equal; the operation is associative.

Identity element: We've found e = -1.

Inverses: For each a in Z, there must exist a b in Z such that a * b = e. So a + b +1 = -1 → b = -a -2. Since a is integer, -a-2 is also integer, so inverses exist.

Hence, all group axioms are satisfied, which confirms that the identity element is indeed -1.

The question involves finding the identity element of a group defined on the set of integers \( \mathbb{Z} \) with the binary operation \( a * b = a + b + 1 \). The identity element \( e \) in a group satisfies \( a * e = a \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Z} \). Substituting into the operation, we have:

\[
a * e = a + e + 1 = a.
\]

Subtracting \( a \) from both sides gives:

\[
e + 1 = 0 \implies e = -1.
\]

Thus, the identity element is \( -1 \). Verifying the group axioms confirms that the operation forms a group, and the identity element is consistent for all integers. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: -1**
