Question:

A plane can travel 100 miles per hour (mph) without any wind. Its fuel supply is 3 hours. (This means that it can fly 300 miles without a wind). The pilot now proposes to fly east with a tail wind of 10 mph and to return with, of course, a head wind of 10 mph. How far out can he fly and return without running out of fuel? (The student should first reflect on whether or not the answer is the same as it is without a wind, namely, 150 miles.)

Options:

A: 125 miles
B: 140 miles
C: 145 miles
D: 150 miles
E: 148.5 miles
F: 165 miles
G: 135 miles
H: 130 miles
I: 160 miles
J: 155 miles

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a plane's flight with wind conditions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the plane can fly at 100 mph without wind, and it has a fuel supply that lasts 3 hours. That means normally, without any wind, it can go 300 miles because 100 mph times 3 hours is 300 miles. But the question is about flying east with a tailwind and then returning with a headwind. So the pilot is planning a round trip.

Wait, the question is asking how far out he can fly and then return without running out of fuel. So it's like going east a certain distance and then coming back west the same distance. The key here is that the wind affects the speed on each leg of the trip.

Let me think about the speeds. When the plane is going east with a tailwind, the wind adds to its speed. So the speed becomes 100 + 10 = 110 mph. On the return trip, it's going against the wind, so the speed is 100 - 10 = 90 mph.

The fuel supply is enough for 3 hours of flying without wind, but in this case, the wind changes the effective speed, so the time each leg takes will be different. The total time for both legs can't exceed 3 hours because that's when the fuel runs out.

Let me denote the distance one way as 'd' miles. So the time taken to go east is d divided by 110 mph, and the time to return is d divided by 90 mph. The sum of these two times should equal 3 hours.

So the equation would be: (d/110) + (d/90) = 3.

Now, I need to solve this equation for d. Let's find a common denominator for the two fractions. The denominators are 110 and 90. Let me see, 110 is 11*10 and 90 is 9*10. The least common multiple would be 990, I think. So converting the fractions:

d/110 = (9d)/990,
d/90 = (11d)/990.

Adding them together: (9d + 11d)/990 = 20d/990.

So 20d/990 = 3.

Simplify 20/990. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 10, so 2/99. So 2d/99 = 3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 20d/990 = 3. Let me solve for d:

Multiply both sides by 990: 20d = 3 * 990.

Calculate 3*990: 3*900 is 2700, 3*90 is 270; total is 2970.

So 20d = 2970.

Divide both sides by 20: d = 2970 / 20.

Let's compute that. 2970 divided by 20. 20*148 is 2960, so 2970-2960 is 10. So d=148.5 miles.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that. So 2970 divided by 20.

20 times 148 is 2960, remainder 10. So 148.5. Yeah, that's correct.

So the plane can fly 148.5 miles each way and then return, using exactly 3 hours of fuel.

Looking at the options, option E is 148.5 miles.

To determine how far the plane can fly east with a tailwind and return west with a headwind without running out of fuel, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Plane Speeds**:  
   - With a tailwind of 10 mph, the plane's effective speed is \( 100 + 10 = 110 \, \text{mph} \).  
   - With a headwind of 10 mph, the plane's effective speed is \( 100 - 10 = 90 \, \text{mph} \).  

2. **Fuel Supply**:  
   The plane has enough fuel for 3 hours of flight without wind. However, the wind alters the time taken for each leg of the trip. The total time for the round trip must not exceed 3 hours.

3. **Distance and Time Relationship**:  
   Let \( d \) represent the one-way distance. The time taken to fly east is \( \frac{d}{110} \), and the time to return is \( \frac{d}{90} \). The total time is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{d}{110} + \frac{d}{90} = 3
   \]

4. **Solving for \( d \)**:  
   To solve the equation, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 110 and 90 is 990:  
   \[
   \frac{9d}{990} + \frac{11d}{990} = 3
   \]  
   Combine the terms:  
   \[
   \frac{20d}{990} = 3
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   \frac{2d}{99} = 3
   \]  
   Multiply through by 99:  
   \[
   2d = 297
   \]  
   Divide by 2:  
   \[
   d = 148.5 \, \text{miles}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The plane can fly 148.5 miles east with the tailwind and return 148.5 miles west with the headwind without running out of fuel.

From the given options, the correct answer is **E: 148.5 miles**.
