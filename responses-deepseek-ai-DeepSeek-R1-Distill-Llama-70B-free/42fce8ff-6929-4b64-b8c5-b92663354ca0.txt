Okay, so I have this problem here about a television screen's dimensions. Hmm, let's see. The question is about whether the advertised 48-inch width is along the horizontal length or the diagonal. The aspect ratio given is 5:3, so length to height. I need to find out how much shorter the horizontal length would be if the 48 inches is the diagonal instead of the horizontal.

Alright, let's break it down. First, I know that the aspect ratio is 5:3, so for every 5 units of length, the height is 3 units. So the length is longer than the height.

If the 48-inch measurement is along the diagonal, then I can model the TV screen as a right-angled triangle, where the diagonal is the hypotenuse. The other two sides would be the length (horizontal) and the height (vertical) of the screen.

Wait, but I need to find the actual length and height when the diagonal is 48 inches. Then compare that to when the length is 48 inches, and see how much shorter the length would be.

Wait, no. The question says if the measure is made along the diagonal instead of the horizontal, how much shorter would the horizontal length be. So I think I need to calculate the horizontal length when the diagonal is 48 inches, and when the length is 48 inches, what's the length in that case, but wait, that would be 48. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking: if the customer thinks the 48-inch is the horizontal length (so length=48), but actually it's the diagonal. So we need to find the actual length (when diagonal is 48) and compare it to 48 to see the difference.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is: what is the horizontal length when the diagonal is 48, versus when the horizontal is 48. Wait, no. Wait, the question is a bit confusing. Let me read again.

The customer is uncertain if the 48-inch width is the horizontal or the diagonal. So we have two scenarios:

1. The 48 inches is the horizontal length (so length=48). Then, using the aspect ratio, we can find the height.

2. The 48 inches is the diagonal. Then, using the aspect ratio, we can find the length (horizontal).

Then the question is asking: how much shorter will the horizontal length be if the measure is along the diagonal rather than along the horizontal. So in other words, how much shorter is the horizontal length in case 2 compared to case 1.

Wait, no. Wait, no. When the 48-inch is the horizontal, the length is 48. When the 48-inch is the diagonal, the length will be less than 48, right? So the difference is how much shorter the horizontal is in the diagonal case compared to the horizontal case.

So I need to compute, for the diagonal=48, the length, and then find 48 minus that length, which will give the difference. The question is, how much shorter would the horizontal length be if the measure is made along the diagonal. So the answer is the difference between the two lengths.

So let's do the math.

First, let's handle the scenario where the length is 48 inches (so aspect ratio 5:3). Then, the height would be (3/5) * length. So 3/5 of 48 is 28.8 inches. So the screen is 48 inches long and 28.8 inches high.

But the customer is considering the case where the 48 inches is the diagonal. So in that case, the diagonal is 48 inches. So we can model this as a right triangle with length L, height H, and diagonal D=48.

We know the aspect ratio L:H =5:3, so L=5k, H=3k, for some k.

Then, by Pythagoras, L^2 + H^2 = D^2.

So (5k)^2 + (3k)^2 = 48^2.

Calculating that:

25k² + 9k² = 2304.

34k² = 2304.

k² = 2304 /34.

Let me compute 2304 divided by 34.

34 * 67 is 2278 (since 34*70=2380, minus 3*34=102 → 2380-102=2278). 2304-2278=26. So 67 + 26/34 → 67.7647 approximately.

So k² ≈ 67.7647 → k ≈ sqrt(67.7647). Let me compute that. The square of 8 is 64, 8.2²=67.24, 8.23²= (8.2+0.03)^2=8.2² + 2*8.2*0.03 + 0.03² → 67.24 + 0.492 + 0.0009=67.7329. Close to 67.7647.

So 8.23^2 is 67.7329, 8.24^2 is (8.23+0.01)^2=8.23² + 2*8.23*0.01 + 0.01² →67.7329 + 0.1646 + 0.0001=67.8976. Hmm, but our k² is 67.7647, which is between 8.23² and 8.24².

Let me compute 8.23^2=67.7329.

The difference between 67.7647 and 67.7329 is 0.0318. So how much beyond 8.23 do we need? Let's see, each 0.01 increase in k adds approximately 0.1646 per 0.01, but wait, no: the derivative of k² is 2k. At k=8.23, 2k=16.46. So the change in k needed is approximately 0.0318 / (2*8.23) → 0.0318/(16.46) ≈ 0.00193. So k≈8.23 + 0.00193 ≈8.23193.

So k≈8.232. So L=5k=5*8.232≈41.16 inches.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm:

Compute 5k when k=8.232 → 5*8=40, 5*0.232=1.16, so total 41.16 inches.

So the length is approximately 41.16 inches when the diagonal is 48 inches.

In the other scenario, where the length is 48 inches, the diagonal would be longer than 48 inches. But the question is comparing the length when the diagonal is 48 vs when the length is 48. So the difference is 48 (length when measured as length) minus 41.16 (length when diagonal is 48) equals approximately 6.84 inches. So to the nearest inch, that's about 7 inches.

So the horizontal length would be 7 inches shorter if the 48-inch measurement is along the diagonal instead of the horizontal.

Looking at the options, H is 7. So the answer should be H.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much shorter the horizontal length of the television screen would be if the advertised 48-inch width is measured along the diagonal rather than along the horizontal length. The aspect ratio of the screen is given as 5:3 (length to height).

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let the length of the screen be \( L \) and the height be \( H \). The aspect ratio is \( L:H = 5:3 \), so we can express the length and height in terms of a scaling factor \( k \):
\[
L = 5k, \quad H = 3k
\]

### Step 2: Case 1 - Length is 48 inches
If the 48-inch measurement is along the horizontal length, then:
\[
L = 48 \implies 5k = 48 \implies k = \frac{48}{5} = 9.6
\]
The height in this case is:
\[
H = 3k = 3 \times 9.6 = 28.8 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 3: Case 2 - Diagonal is 48 inches
If the 48-inch measurement is along the diagonal, we use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
L^2 + H^2 = D^2
\]
Substituting \( L = 5k \), \( H = 3k \), and \( D = 48 \):
\[
(5k)^2 + (3k)^2 = 48^2
\]
\[
25k^2 + 9k^2 = 2304
\]
\[
34k^2 = 2304 \implies k^2 = \frac{2304}{34} \implies k^2 \approx 67.76 \implies k \approx \sqrt{67.76} \approx 8.23
\]
The length in this case is:
\[
L = 5k = 5 \times 8.23 \approx 41.16 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 4: Compare the two cases
In Case 1, the length is 48 inches. In Case 2, the length is approximately 41.16 inches. The difference is:
\[
48 - 41.16 \approx 6.84 \, \text{inches}
\]
To the nearest inch, the horizontal length is 7 inches shorter when the 48-inch measurement is along the diagonal.

### Final Answer
The horizontal length will be approximately **7 inches shorter** if the 48-inch measurement is along the diagonal rather than the horizontal length.

**Answer: H**
