Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Macnamara's pyramid of evaluation, and I need to figure out at which stage opinion polls are most useful. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that evaluation models often break down into different stages or levels. Macnamara's pyramid probably has several layers, each representing a different aspect of evaluation. I think the pyramid starts from the base with more immediate measures and moves up to longer-term outcomes.

Wait, Macnamara's pyramid, I believe, is structured with different levels: Inputs, Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact. Or maybe there are more? Let me think. Oh right, I think it's Inputs at the base, then Outputs, then Outtakes, then Outcomes, and finally Impact at the top. Or was it a different order? Wait, maybe Inputs, then Process, then Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, I've heard that some models use terms like Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, Impact. But Macnamara's might be different. Oh wait, Macnamara's model is the "Pyramid of Corporate Affairs Evaluation" or something like that. From what I recall, the pyramid has five levels: Inputs, Outputs, Outtakes, Outcomes, and Impact. So the base is Inputs, then moving up: Outputs, then Outtakes, then Outcomes, and the top is Impact.

Now, the question is about opinion polls. When are they most useful? Opinion polls are typically used to gauge public opinion, which could relate to measuring reactions or perceptions after some activity has been done. 

So, in the context of evaluation stages:

- Inputs would be resources, planning, etc. Opinion polls probably don't fit here.
- Outputs are the products or deliverables, like reports, events, etc. Again, maybe not directly.
- Outtakes are what people take out from the outputs, like the messages they receive or the initial reactions. So opinion polls could measure this.
- Outcomes are longer-term changes, like behavior changes or policy changes.
- Impact is the highest level, looking at the overall effect on society or the environment.

So if I'm thinking about opinion polls, they're probably measuring the immediate reactions or knowledge gained after exposure to a program or activity. That would fall under Outtakes, which are the direct results of the outputs. Alternatively, maybe Outcomes if they're measuring longer-term shifts, but I think opinion polls are more immediate.

Wait, but sometimes people use opinion polls to measure changes in public opinion over time, which could tie into outcomes. But I think in the context of Macnamara's pyramid, Outtakes are about the initial effects, like awareness or understanding, while Outcomes are more about behavior changes or actions taken.

So if the question is about opinion polls, they're most useful at the Outtakes stage. Looking back at the options, option D is Outtakes.

Opinion polls are most useful at the stage of evaluating the immediate reactions or understanding that people gain from a program or activity. In Macnamara's pyramid, this corresponds to the "Outtakes" stage, which focuses on the direct results of the outputs. 

Answer: D
