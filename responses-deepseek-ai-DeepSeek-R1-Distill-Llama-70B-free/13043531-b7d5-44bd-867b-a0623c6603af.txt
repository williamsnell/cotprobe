Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a sample of CO2 gas. It's 2.0 moles in a fixed volume of 15.0 dm³. Initially, it's at 300 K, and then it's heated with 2.35 kJ of energy, which increases the temperature to 341 K. We need to find the change in internal energy, ΔU. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So ΔU would be n*Cv*(ΔT). But wait, the question says to use the van der Waals equation, so it's not an ideal gas. That complicates things a bit.

Wait, but wait. The van der Waals equation is for real gases, so the internal energy won't just depend on temperature. But maybe for the purposes of calculating ΔU when volume is constant, there's another approach.

I think when the volume is constant, the first law of thermodynamics says that Q = ΔU + W. But since the volume is fixed, no work is done (W=0), so Q should equal ΔU. But wait, isn't that only true for ideal gases? Or does it apply here?

Wait, no. For any gas, if the volume is constant, W = PΔV = 0, so Q = ΔU. So irrespective of whether it's ideal or real, when volume is constant, the heat added equals the change in internal energy. So in that case, ΔU would be 2.35 kJ. But wait, the options include E as +2.35 kJ, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, but wait again. The problem states that it's a van der Waals gas, so maybe the internal energy isn't just a function of temperature. Or does it? No, wait, for any gas, whether ideal or real, the internal energy is a function of temperature only for an ideal gas. For real gases, internal energy can depend on both temperature and volume (or pressure). But wait, when calculating ΔU for a process where volume is constant, is it just n Cv ΔT regardless? Or does the equation of state affect it?

Wait, let me think again. The internal energy change is given by ΔU = n Cv ΔT only for ideal gases. For real gases, Cv isn't just a function of temperature; it's more complicated. So if we can't use the ideal gas assumption, how do we proceed?

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to treat it as an ideal gas anyway, perhaps because the data given doesn't include van der Waals constants, making it impossible to compute using the real gas approach.

Wait, but the question explicitly says to use the van der Waals equation. So perhaps I should think of something else.

Wait, another approach: for a process at constant volume, the heat Q is equal to the change in internal energy, regardless of the equation of state. Because W is zero. So Q = ΔU.

So in that case, ΔU would be 2.35 kJ, which is option E. But why is the van der Waals part mentioned then? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is testing whether I know that for real gases, the internal energy also depends on volume, but in this case, since the volume is constant, the dependence on volume doesn't change. So the change in internal energy would still be determined by the temperature change, but perhaps using the van der Waals equation data.

Wait, no. The van der Waals equation affects pressure and volume but doesn't directly give us the internal energy. The internal energy for a van der Waals gas is given by U = U(T) + some function involving volume, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the work done. But wait, volume is constant, so W = 0. So Q must be equal to ΔU.

Wait, let me think about the first law again. The first law is ΔU = Q - W. Since W = P_ext * ΔV, and ΔV is zero (fixed volume), W=0. So ΔU = Q.

So regardless of whether the gas is ideal or real, if the volume doesn't change, the heat added is the change in internal energy. So ΔU is 2.35 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option E is +2.35 kJ. So the answer should be E.

But wait, why does the question mention the van der Waals equation then? Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the van der Waals equation is needed to calculate the work, but since the volume is fixed, work is zero. So the heat Q goes entirely into internal energy.

So yes, I think the answer is E.
</think>

To determine the change in internal energy, ΔU, for the given process, we start by noting that the volume of the CO₂ gas is fixed at 15.0 dm³. According to the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta U = Q - W
\]

where \( Q \) is the heat supplied and \( W \) is the work done by the system. Since the volume is constant, no work is done (\( W = 0 \)), so:

\[
\Delta U = Q
\]

The problem states that 2.35 kJ of heat is supplied to the system. Therefore, the change in internal energy is:

\[
\Delta U = +2.35 \, \text{kJ}
\]

The mention of the van der Waals equation in the problem does not affect this conclusion because the calculation of ΔU depends only on the heat supplied and the fact that no work is done during the process. The van der Waals equation would be relevant if the problem involved pressure-volume work or required corrections to the ideal gas behavior, but these are not factors here.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: +2.35 kJ
