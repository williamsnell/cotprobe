Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about two statements related to statistics and machine learning. I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's break it down step by step.

The question has two statements:

1. Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.
2. The coefficients α assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.

And the options are from A to J, each combining the truth values of these two statements.

Let's tackle each statement one by one.

Starting with Statement 1: I remember that in statistics, the concept of estimators and their properties is crucial. The linear regression estimator, specifically the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator, has some important properties. I think the Gauss-Markov theorem comes into play here. From what I recall, the Gauss-Markov theorem states that under certain conditions (like the errors being uncorrelated and homoscedastic, with zero mean, and the predictors being non-random), the OLS estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). And being BLUE means it has the lowest variance among all unbiased linear estimators.

But wait, the statement says "among all unbiased estimators," not just linear ones. Oh, right! So the BLUE is the best among linear estimators, but if we consider all possible unbiased estimators, not necessarily linear, then the OLS might not have the smallest variance. For example, if the errors are normally distributed, then the OLS is also the maximum likelihood estimator and might be the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE). So if the conditions are met (like normality), then OLS is the MVUE. But without those conditions, it's only the BLUE.

So Statement 1 is not universally true. It's only true under specific conditions, like when the errors are normally distributed. Otherwise, there might be non-linear unbiased estimators with lower variance. So Statement 1 is sometimes true, but not always.

Moving on to Statement 2: This is about AdaBoost, specifically the coefficients α assigned to the classifiers. I remember that AdaBoost works by iteratively training classifiers, with each subsequent classifier focusing more on the instances that were misclassified by the previous ones. The α coefficients are calculated based on the error rate of each classifier—if a classifier has a low error rate, it gets a higher α. 

From what I understand, the α values are always positive because they represent the confidence or weight assigned to each classifier. Since each classifier's error rate is between 0 and 1 (assuming it's better than random), the formula for α (which I think is α = 0.5 * ln((1 - error)/error)) would always yield a positive value. So the coefficients α are indeed always non-negative. 

So Statement 2 is true.

Now, looking back at the options, let's see which one matches our analysis.

Statement 1: Sometimes true (because it's only true under certain conditions, like normality of errors), so it's not always true. So it's False when considered universally.

Statement 2: Always true.

Looking at the options:

Option D: False, True. That fits—Statement 1 is false (it's not always true), and Statement 2 is true.

Option J is True, False, which is the opposite. So no.

Wait, just to double-check: Statement 1's truth. The first statement says the linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. As I thought earlier, this is only true if it's the MVUE, which requires certain conditions. Without those conditions, it's just BLUE, not MVUE. So the statement is making a general claim, which isn't correct. So Statement 1 is False.

Statement 2 is correct, so the correct option is D: False, True.

The question evaluates the truthfulness of two statements related to statistics and machine learning:

1. **Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.**  
   This statement is based on the Gauss-Markov theorem, which states that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) under certain conditions. However, the statement claims this is true among *all* unbiased estimators, not just linear ones. For OLS to have the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators, it would need to be the minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE), which requires additional assumptions, such as normally distributed errors. Without these conditions, OLS is only BLUE, not MVUE. Therefore, this statement is **False** when considered universally.

2. **The coefficients α assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.**  
   AdaBoost assigns weights (α) to classifiers based on their performance, with better-performing classifiers receiving higher weights. The formula for α ensures it is always non-negative, as it is derived from the error rate of each classifier. Thus, this statement is **True**.

Given the analysis, the correct option is **D: False, True**, as the first statement is false when considered universally, and the second statement is always true.
