Okay, so I have this problem here about a bulldozer's book value using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on depreciation methods, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says the Columbus Construction Co. bought a bulldozer for $15,500. After five years, it'll have a trade-in value of $2,600. They want the book value after three years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method.

Wait, so first, I need to find the depreciation each year and then calculate the book value after three years. But wait, the sum-of-the-years-digits (SYD) method is a type of accelerated depreciation, right? So the depreciation is higher in the early years and less in the later years.

Let me think about how SYD works. The formula for depreciation each year is (cost - salvage value) multiplied by the fraction, which is the year's digit over the sum of the digits for all years.

So the first step is to figure out the salvage value. Oh, wait, the trade-in value after five years is $2,600. I guess that's the salvage value here. So the depreciable amount is the cost minus the salvage value. 

Cost is $15,500, salvage is $2,600. So depreciable amount = 15,500 - 2,600 = $12,900.

Now, the useful life is five years. So the sum of the years digits for five years is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.

Each year's depreciation is (depreciable amount) * (year's digit / sum). So for each year:

Year 1: 12,900 * (5/15) → Wait wait, no. Wait, the digit for the first year is 5? Or is it 1? Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Because in SYD, the digits are in reverse order. Oh right! The first year uses 5/15, the second 4/15, and so on until the fifth year which is 1/15.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The sum of years digits for a 5-year life is 1+2+3+4+5=15. But the depreciation rate for each year is calculated as (n)/(sum), where n is the year's number from the end. So, first year uses 5/15, second 4/15, third 3/15, fourth 2/15, fifth 1/15.

Wait, no, another way: the formula is (remaining life over sum of years). Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Alternatively, it's (year's digit) / (sum of digits). So for year 1, the digit is 5, so 5/15. Year 2: 4/15, etc.

Wait, let me check that. Oh, right, the sum of the years digits is 15 for 5 years. For each year, the rate is the year's digit divided by 15. So year 1: 5/15, year 2:4/15, year3:3/15, year4:2/15, and year5:1/15.

So the depreciation for each year would be:

Year 1: 12,900 * (5/15) = 12,900 * 1/3 = $4,300.

Year 2: 12,900 * (4/15) = 12,900 * 4 ÷15. Let me calculate that: 12,900 * 4 = 51,600. 51,600 ÷15 = $3,440.

Year3: 12,900 *3/15= 12,900 * 0.2= $2,580.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking for the book value after three years. So I need to accumulate the depreciation for the first three years and subtract that from the initial cost.

Alternatively, the book value after three years is the initial cost minus the accumulated depreciation up to year3.

So let me compute the accumulated depreciation after three years.

Year1 depreciation: $4,300.

Year2: $3,440.

Year3: $2,580.

So total depreciation after three years is 4,300 +3,440 +2,580.

Let me add those up:

4,300 +3,440 = 7,740. Plus 2,580 is 7,740 +2,580=10,320.

So total depreciation is $10,320.

So the book value is cost minus accumulated depreciation: 15,500 -10,320 = $5,180.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is $5,180. So is that the answer? But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I should compute the book value as initial cost minus the sum of each year's depreciation.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the depreciation each year and subtract each from the previous year's book value.

Let me try that approach.

Year 1:

Depreciation: 12,900*(5/15)=4,300.

Book value after year1: 15,500 -4,300 = 11,200.

Year2:

Depreciation:12,900*(4/15)=3,440.

Book value after year2: 11,200 -3,440=7,760.

Year3:

Depreciation:2,580.

Book value after year3:7,760 -2,580=5,180.

Yes, same result. So the book value is $5,180. Looking back at the options, option H is $5,180. So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the book value of the bulldozer after three years using the sum-of-the-years-digits (SYD) method, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate the depreciable amount**:  
   The cost of the bulldozer is $15,500, and its salvage value after five years is $2,600.  
   Depreciable amount = Cost - Salvage value = $15,500 - $2,600 = $12,900.

2. **Sum of the years' digits**:  
   For a 5-year useful life, the sum of the digits is:  
   \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 \).

3. **Depreciation for each year**:  
   The depreciation rate for each year is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciation} = \text{Depreciable amount} \times \frac{\text{Year's digit}}{\text{Sum of digits}}
   \]  
   - **Year 1**:  
     Depreciation = $12,900 \times \frac{5}{15} = $4,300.  
     Book value = $15,500 - $4,300 = $11,200.  
   - **Year 2**:  
     Depreciation = $12,900 \times \frac{4}{15} = $3,440.  
     Book value = $11,200 - $3,440 = $7,760.  
   - **Year 3**:  
     Depreciation = $12,900 \times \frac{3}{15} = $2,580.  
     Book value = $7,760 - $2,580 = $5,180.

4. **Book value after three years**:  
   After calculating the depreciation for each year and subtracting it from the previous year's book value, the book value after three years is **$5,180**.

From the given options, the correct answer is **H: $5,180**.
