Question:

In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who if anyone was using it. In any case, the grower did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. This jurisdiction uses Grantor Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. In 2008, what is the present state of title to the orange grove if the jurisdiction's recording act provides: "Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute"?

Options:

A: In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
B: In a race notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.
C: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer, having recorded his deed first, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
D: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the grower, being the last to record, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
E: In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.
F: In a race-notice jurisdiction, the son would acquire record title to the orange grove, because he is the original grantee.
G: In a race jurisdiction, the buyer, having recorded his deed before the grower, would acquire record title to the orange grove.
H: In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree, despite not recording his deed, would acquire equitable title to the orange grove due to his payment and receipt of the deed.
I: In a notice jurisdiction, the rancher retains record title to the orange grove, as he never properly conveyed his title.

Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated property law question here. It's about recording statutes and how they affect the ownership of an orange grove over several transactions. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, let me read through the facts again. In 1993, a rancher has a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. So he owns it outright. Then in 1994, he delivers a deed to his son for $1,000. The deed is signed and looks valid, but the son doesn't record it. 

In 1998, a farmer comes along. He knows about the rancher-to-son deed but still approaches the rancher to buy the grove for $10,000. The rancher gives him a deed, and the farmer records it promptly. The farmer's intent is to get color of title and maybe acquire ownership through adverse possession. He builds a fence around the grove in 1998.

Then in 1999, the son sells the grove to a retiree for $15,000. The son gives the retiree a deed, but the retiree doesn't search the title, examine the property, or record the deed. 

In 2003, a buyer pays the farmer $20,000 for a deed. The buyer examines the property, searches the title, and doesn't know about the rancher-to-son deed. The buyer records his deed but doesn't live there, just visits twice a week.

In 2007, the retiree sells to an orange grower for $25,000. The grower visits the grove, sees the fence, but doesn't talk to anyone. He doesn't search the title before buying. 

The jurisdiction uses Grantor-Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. The recording act says that a conveyance is invalid against anyone except the grantor, heirs, or assigns with actual notice unless recorded.

The question is about the state of title in 2008.

Hmm. I remember that recording statutes can be notice, race, or race-notice. The act here says that a conveyance is invalid against anyone except those with actual notice unless it's recorded. That sounds like a notice jurisdiction because it protects subsequent purchasers who take without notice of prior unrecorded conveyances.

Wait, no. Wait, in a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance and pays value will prevail. But in a race-notice jurisdiction, the subsequent purchaser must both record first and take without notice.

The act says "invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded." So, if someone else has actual notice, the unrecorded conveyance is still valid against them. So any later purchaser who has actual notice is bound. So I think this is a notice jurisdiction because it's based on whether the later purchaser had notice, not the race to record.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In a notice jurisdiction, to be protected, the subsequent purchaser must have no actual or constructive notice of prior claims. So in this case, the farmer had actual knowledge of the rancher-to-son deed. So when the farmer took the deed from the rancher, he knew about the son's deed. So even though he recorded, would that affect his rights?

Wait, the farmer's deed was recorded in 1998. The son's deed was from 1994 but not recorded. Then the son sold to the retiree in 1999, but that wasn't recorded. Then the farmer sold to the buyer in 2003, who recorded. The buyer didn't know about the rancher-to-son deed, but he did search the title. Wait, how?

Wait, the buyer examined the property and searched the title. If the farmer's deed was recorded, then when the buyer searched, he would find the farmer's deed. But the son's deed wasn't recorded, so the buyer wouldn't find it in the chain of title.

Wait, the jurisdiction uses Grantor-Grantee indices. So if the buyer is checking the grantor index under the rancher's name, he would find the deed to the farmer, because that's recorded. But the deed to the son wasn't recorded, so it wouldn't show up. So the buyer, when searching, would see the rancher conveyed to the farmer, and the farmer conveyed to him. So the son's prior deed isn't in the records because it wasn't recorded.

So, the rancher first conveys to the son in 1994, but not recorded. Then in 1998, the rancher conveys to the farmer, who promptly records. So the farmer's deed is on record. Then the son conveys to the retiree in 1999, but that's not recorded. The retiree doesn't record. Then the farmer conveys to the buyer in 2003, who records. Then the retiree conveys to the grower in 2007, but the grower doesn't search the title and doesn't record.

Wait, but the farmer's conveyance to the buyer in 2003 would have been recorded, so the buyer's deed is on record. The grower in 2007 takes from the retiree, who had a deed from the son, which was unrecorded. So the grower doesn't search the title, so he might not know about the prior deeds.

But in a notice jurisdiction, the key is whether a subsequent purchaser had notice of prior claims. So let's map out the chain.

1. Rancher (original owner) → Son (unrecorded deed, 1994)
2. Rancher → Farmer (recorded deed, 1998)
3. Son → Retiree (unrecorded deed, 1999)
4. Farmer → Buyer (recorded deed, 2003)
5. Retiree → Grower (unrecorded deed, 2007)

Now, the issue is who has the valid title. Let's see the interests.

- The son's deed was first in time but not recorded. The farmer, with notice of the son's deed, takes from the rancher and records. So in a notice jurisdiction, the farmer's deed would be invalid against the son because the farmer had actual notice. So the son's deed would still be valid as against the farmer.

Wait, in a notice jurisdiction, the subsequent purchaser (farmer) who has notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance cannot prevail against the prior grantee (son). So the son's deed, even though unrecorded, would be valid against the farmer because the farmer had actual notice.

So the son's deed is valid, and the farmer's deed is invalid as against the son. Then, the son conveys to the retiree, but that's unrecorded. So the retiree's deed is from the son, but not recorded. Then the farmer conveys to the buyer, who records. But the buyer's deed is from the farmer, whose title was bad because the farmer's deed from the rancher was invalid (since the rancher had already conveyed to the son, and the farmer had notice). So the buyer's title is derivative; if the farmer didn't have good title, the buyer doesn't either, unless the buyer is a bona fide purchaser without notice.

Wait, the buyer in 2003: he searched the title and found the farmer's recorded deed. He didn't know about the son's prior unrecorded deed. So the buyer is a subsequent purchaser without notice. So in a notice jurisdiction, the buyer would take free of the son's prior unrecorded conveyance because he didn't have notice.

Wait, but in the farmer's chain of title, the farmer's deed is recorded, but the son's deed isn't. So when the buyer searches under the rancher's name, he finds the farmer's deed. He wouldn't find the son's deed because it's not recorded. So the buyer has no actual knowledge of the son's deed and no constructive knowledge because it's unrecorded. Therefore, the buyer is a bona fide purchaser (BFP) without notice.

But wait, the farmer had actual knowledge of the son's deed. So when the farmer sold to the buyer, the buyer's status depends on his own knowledge, not the farmer's. So the buyer's lack of notice would make him a BFP, so his title would be valid against the son's.

Hmm. Alternatively, let me think again. The son's deed was unrecorded. The farmer, with notice, took a deed from the rancher and recorded it. So the farmer's deed is on record, but it's invalid against the son because the farmer had notice. So the son still owns the property. Then the son sells to the retiree, but doesn't record. The retiree doesn't search, so he might not know about the farmer's deed. But the farmer's deed is on record, so if the retiree had searched, he would have found it. But since he didn't, he might take subject to the farmer's prior recorded deed. But wait, the farmer's deed is invalid against the son, so the son can transfer good title to the retiree, but the retiree's deed is unrecorded.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline each transfer:

1. 1994: Rancher → Son (unrecorded). The son has the first conveyance, but it's unrecorded.
2. 1998: Rancher → Farmer (recorded). Farmer has notice of the son's deed. So Farmer's deed is invalid against the Son because Farmer had actual notice. So Son is still the true owner.
3. 1999: Son → Retiree (unrecorded). So Retiree gets his deed from Son, but doesn't record. So Retiree's interest is subject to anyone who might have a later recorded interest without notice.
4. 2003: Farmer → Buyer (recorded). Farmer's title is bad, so Buyer gets nothing from Farmer. Wait, but if the Buyer is a BFP without notice, maybe he can take the property from the Farmer, but that would require the Farmer to have some interest. Alternatively, since the Farmer's deed was recorded, but invalid against the Son, the Buyer's title would be derivative and thus invalid.

Wait, no. Because the Farmer's deed is recorded, but it's invalid against the Son. So when the Buyer takes from the Farmer, and records, his title would be based on the Farmer's title. But since the Farmer's title is bad (because he had notice of the Son's prior deed), the Buyer's title is also bad. So the Son's title is still valid, as the first in time, and the Retiree's deed from the Son is unrecorded, so when the Retiree sells to the Grower, the Grower's title would depend on whether he's a BFP.

Wait, but the Grower in 2007 takes from the Retiree. The Grower visits the property, sees the fence built by the Farmer in 1998. But the Grower doesn't search the title. So if the Grower is a BFP without notice, he might take priority over the Son's prior unrecorded deed. But because the Retiree's deed was unrecorded, the Grower wouldn't find it in the chain of title.

Wait, no. The Grower is taking from the Retiree, who had a deed from the Son. But the Son's deed was unrecorded, so when the Grower takes from the Retiree, he's in the same position as the Retiree. The Retiree didn't record, so the Grower wouldn't have constructive notice. But if the Grower had actual notice, that's a problem. But he didn't; he just saw the fence. So the Grower's status depends on whether he's a BFP without notice.

Wait, the Grower didn't search the title, so he might not have constructive notice. But the fence could be inquiry notice. Inquiry notice is when a purchaser has knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to investigate further. Seeing the fence might suggest that someone is using the property, but without knowing who, it's not clear. So maybe the Grower doesn't have inquiry notice.

But in a notice jurisdiction, the key is actual notice. If the Grower had no actual knowledge, he's okay. So if the Grower is a BFP without notice, he would take free of any prior unrecorded conveyances. But wait, the Farmer's deed was recorded, so wouldn't that affect the Grower?

Wait, no. The Grower is taking from the Retiree, whose deed is from the Son. The Son's deed is prior to the Farmer's, but unrecorded. The Farmer's deed is recorded but invalid against the Son. So when the Farmer sold to the Buyer, the Buyer's title is bad because the Farmer's title was bad. Then the Retiree sells to the Grower, but the Retiree's deed is from the Son, who had good title because his deed was first and the Farmer had notice. So the Retiree's title is from the Son, but unrecorded. So when the Grower buys, if he's a BFP without notice, his title would take priority.

But wait, the Farmer's deed is recorded, so the Grower, when taking from the Retiree, would have a problem because the Farmer's deed is on record. So when the Grower's attorney does a title search, they would find the Farmer's deed and the Buyer's deed. So the Grower's claim would be that he's taking from the Retiree, whose chain is from the Son, but since the Son's deed is unrecorded, the Grower wouldn't know unless he does a thorough search.

Wait, but the Grower didn't search the title at all. So he wouldn't know about the Farmer's recorded deed. So in a notice jurisdiction, the Grower would be charged with constructive notice of the Farmer's deed because it's recorded. So even if he didn't search, the law would say he's charged with knowing about it. Therefore, if the Grower had constructive notice (because the Farmer's deed is recorded), he can't claim to be a BFP without notice.

Wait, no. Because the Grower is taking from the Retiree, whose chain of title is from the Son. The Son's deed is unrecorded, so it wouldn't appear in the Grantor-Grantee indices under the Son's name. The Farmer's deed is under the rancher's name as grantor. So if the Grower does a title search, he would check the Retiree's grantor (the Son), but if the Son's deed isn't recorded, the search wouldn't show it. Wait, no, the Grower is taking from the Retiree, so the chain would be Retiree ← Son ← Rancher. But the Son's deed to the Retiree isn't recorded, so the Grantor-Grantee index under the Son's name would have the deed to the Retiree only if it's recorded. Since it's not, the index wouldn't show it. Therefore, the Grower, when searching, wouldn't find the Son's deed to the Retiree because it's not recorded. But the Farmer's deed from the rancher is recorded, so the Grower would find that when searching the rancher's name. So the Grower would see that the rancher conveyed to the farmer, who then conveyed to the buyer. So the Grower would have constructive notice of the Farmer's and Buyer's deeds, meaning he can't be a BFP because he's charged with knowledge of those recorded deeds. Therefore, the Grower's deed from the Retiree would be invalid against the Buyer's interest because the Buyer's deed is recorded, and the Grower is charged with knowing about it.

Wait, but the Buyer's title comes from the Farmer, whose title was bad because the Farmer had notice of the Son's deed. So the Buyer's title is derivative. If the Farmer didn't have good title, the Buyer doesn't either, even if he's a BFP. Because in a notice jurisdiction, a BFP without notice can take title even if the prior transfer was unrecorded, but in this case, the Farmer's title was bad because he had notice. So the Farmer couldn't pass good title to the Buyer. Therefore, the Buyer's title is bad, and the true owner would be the Retiree, whose title comes from the Son. But the Retiree didn't record, so when the Grower takes from the Retiree, if the Grower is a BFP without notice, he could take good title.

Wait, this is getting really tangled. Let me try to outline the possible interests:

- The Son has the first conveyance (1994), unrecorded. So he has equitable title.
- The Farmer takes from the rancher in 1998, with notice of the Son's deed. So the Farmer's deed is invalid against the Son. So the Son remains the legal owner.
- The Son sells to the Retiree in 1999, unrecorded. So the Retiree now holds the Son's equitable title, but it's unrecorded.
- The Farmer sells to the Buyer in 2003. The Buyer records. The Buyer searches and doesn't find the Son's deed because it's unrecorded. So the Buyer is a BFP without notice, taking from the Farmer. But the Farmer's title was bad, so the Buyer's title is also bad. So the Son's title is still valid.
- The Retiree sells to the Grower in 2007. The Grower doesn't search the title, so he might be a BFP. But the Farmer's deed is recorded, so the Grower is charged with constructive notice of the Farmer's deed. Therefore, the Grower can't be a BFP because he's deemed to know about the Farmer's recorded deed. So the Grower's title would be junior to the Farmer's, but the Farmer's title is junior to the Son's.

Wait, but if the Grower is charged with knowing about the Farmer's deed, then the Grower's title is subject to the Farmer's, which is subject to the Son's. So the true owner would be the Son's grantee, which is the Retiree, but the Retiree didn't record. So the Grower, taking from the Retiree, would have a problem because the Grower is charged with knowing about the Farmer's deed. Therefore, the Grower's title is invalid against the Farmer's, but the Farmer's title is invalid against the Son's. So the Son's title is still the best.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this by looking at each option.

Option A: In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent BFP, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title. So he would acquire record title.

But the Grower's chain of title is Retiree ← Son ← Rancher. The Son's deed to the Retiree isn't recorded, so the Grower wouldn't find it in his own chain. But the Farmer's deed is from the ranch
