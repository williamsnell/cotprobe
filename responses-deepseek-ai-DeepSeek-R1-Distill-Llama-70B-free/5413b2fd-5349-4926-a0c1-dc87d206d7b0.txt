Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about partnerships, specifically general partnerships. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about Pete Smith and Bill Jones being partners in a general partnership called "Pete Smith Plumbing." Pete is the active partner, and Bill is the silent partner. After six years of not being involved in the business, Bill buys 100 toilets for the business. Pete is upset because it'll take years to use all the toilets and is seeking advice.

The options are A through J, and I need to figure out the best advice for Pete.

First, I should recall the law regarding general partnerships, especially the roles of active and silent partners. In a general partnership, all partners are agents of the partnership. This means that each partner has the authority to bind the partnership in matters related to the business. However, this authority is based on the concept of apparent authority. 

Apparent authority is the authority that a principal (here, the partnership) is estopped from denying because a third party reasonably believes, based on the principal's words or actions, that the agent (the partner) has authority. So, if a partner takes an action that a reasonable third person would believe is within the scope of the partnership's business, the partnership is bound by that action, regardless of whether the partner was actually authorized by the other partners.

In this case, Bill is a silent partner who hasn't been involved in management for six years. However, he goes and purchases 100 toilets. The question is whether Bill had the authority to bind the partnership by this purchase.

I think the key here is whether Bill's action falls within the scope of the partnership's business. The partnership is a plumbing business, and purchasing toilets would be a normal part of that business. So, even though Bill is a silent partner, his action of purchasing toilets would likely be within the apparent authority because it's within the usual course of business.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act. This seems correct because under apparent authority, his action would bind the partnership, especially since purchasing plumbing supplies is within the normal business activities.

Option A: The partnership can only be bound by the actions of the active partner. That doesn't sound right because all partners, even silent ones, can bind the partnership as long as their actions are within the scope of the business.

Option B: Silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership. That's incorrect because silent partners can still have apparent authority to act on behalf of the partnership in matters within the business scope.

Option D: Bill's action is invalid because he didn't consult Pete. But the validity isn't about consultation; it's about authority. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The partnership can return the toilets because Bill didn't have authority. But if Bill had apparent authority, the partnership can't just return them; they're bound by the purchase.

Option F: If Bill's name isn't in the partnership name, third parties are on notice. That's not necessarily true. The name isn't the only factor determining apparent authority. The nature of the transaction matters more.

Option G: Pete can sue Bill. That's possible if Bill acted beyond his authority, but if he had apparent authority, Pete might not have a case against him.

Option H: Bill, as a silent partner, isn't authorized to purchase. That's incorrect because silent partners can still have authority within the business scope.

Option I: The third party can be held liable. No, because the third party would reasonably assume Bill has authority to make such purchases.

Option J: If Bill used personal funds, the partnership isn't bound. But even if he used personal funds, the partnership could still be bound if the purchase was within apparent authority. However, the question doesn't specify if he used personal funds or partnership funds, so this might not apply here.

So the best answer seems to be C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act.

The correct answer is based on the principle that in a general partnership, all partners have apparent authority to bind the partnership in matters within the scope of the business. Bill, as a silent partner, purchased 100 toilets, which is a typical transaction for a plumbing business. Under the doctrine of apparent authority, this action would bind the partnership, as a third party would reasonably assume Bill had the authority to make such a purchase. 

Options A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J are incorrect because they either misstate the law regarding silent partners' authority or fail to account for the apparent authority doctrine in this context.

C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act.

Answer: C
