Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about supply and demand schedules. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. 

The question has two parts: a) finding the equilibrium price and b) determining if there's a surplus or shortage at $4.00. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part a), equilibrium. I remember that equilibrium is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. So I'll need to look through the given tables and find the price point where the numbers match.

Looking at the data, the columns are a bit confusing. It looks like the first two columns are Quantity Demanded and Price, then the next two are Quantity Supplied continuing. Wait, maybe I should write them out more clearly.

From the problem statement, the tables are:

Quantity demanded | Price | Quantity supplied
------------------|-------|-----------------
3000              |$4.00  |1200
2800              |$4.05  |1600
2500              |$4.10  |1900
2100              |$4.15  |2100
2000              |$4.20  |2450
1700              |$4.25  |2900

Wait, no, actually, looking again, the problem says that the first set is Quantity demanded and Price, then the Quantity supplied continues. So maybe it's two separate tables. Let me restructure it to avoid confusion.

Probably, it's laid out as:

- At each price, there's a quantity demanded and a quantity supplied.

So for each price level:

At $4.00:
- Qd = 3000
- Qs = 1200

At $4.05:
- Qd = 2800
- Qs = 1600

At $4.10:
- Qd =2500
- Qs=1900

At $4.15:
- Qd=2100
- Qs=2100

At $4.20:
- Qd=2000
- Qs=2450

At $4.25:
- Qd=1700
- Qs=2900

Wait, so for each price, there's a Qd and Qs. So at $4.15, Qd and Qs are both 2100. That means equilibrium is at $4.15 because the quantities are equal. So the equilibrium price is $4.15.

Now part b), determining if there's a surplus or shortage at $4.00. At a price of $4.00, I look at the quantities. Qd is 3000 and Qs is 1200. So the quantity demanded is higher than supplied. That means there's a shortage because more people want to buy than sellers are willing to sell.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. When the price is set below equilibrium, does it lead to a shortage or surplus? I think if the price is below equilibrium, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, causing a shortage. Because at lower prices, more people want to buy, but suppliers aren't producing as much.

So at $4.00, Qd is 3000, Qs is 1200. So the shortage would be 3000 - 1200 = 1800 units. Wait, but wait, looking at the options, let me check.

Wait no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. At a price of $4.00, the quantity demanded is 3000, and the quantity supplied is 1200. So the difference is 1800. So the shortage is 1800 units because demand exceeds supply by that much.

Wait, but the options don't have that exact answer. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: $4.15, surplus of 300 units
B: $4.20, shortage of 1200 units
C: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units
D: $4.00, surplus of 1800 units
E: $4.10, surplus of 300 units
F: $4.10, equilibrium
G: $4.05, equilibrium
H: $4.00, shortage of 1200 units
I: $4.20, surplus of 450 units
J: $4.25, surplus of 1000 units

Wait, so part a) equilibrium is $4.15, because Qd=2100 and Qs=2100. So any option where part a is correct is one where equilibrium is $4.15. Looking at options, looking for a) as $4.15.

Looking at the options:

A: $4.15, surplus of 300 units â†’ a) correct, but b) would be at $4.00: shortage of 1800. So this is for part b) surplus? No, because at $4.00, it's a shortage.

Option C: $4.15, shortage of 1800. But part a) is correct, but part b) is a shortage of 1800. Wait, but in part b), the question is whether there would be a surplus or shortage at $4.00. So the correct answer for part b) is a shortage of 1800 units. So looking at the options, which option has a) $4.15 and part b) as a shortage of 1800 units?

Looking at the options, option C is a) $4.15, and b) a shortage of 1800 units. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, looking again, the question is part a and part b. So the answer should have both parts correct. So option C would have a) correct and b) correct. 

But wait, let me make sure. Let me see the other options. Option H says $4.00, which is part a) incorrect, so not. Option D is $4.00, surplus of 1800, which is wrong because at $4.00, it's a shortage. 

Wait, but looking back, the options combine both a and b. So for example, option C says for a) $4.15 and b) a shortage of 1800 units. So that would be correct. But let me double-check the numbers.

At equilibrium, $4.15: Qd=2100, Qs=2100. Correct. At $4.00, Qd=3000, Qs=1200. So shortage is 3000-1200=1800. So that's a shortage of 1800 units.

So the correct answer would be option C: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units. But wait, looking at the options, option C is "C: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units." So that's exactly what we have.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are a) and b) combined, right? So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because in the options, the first part is the equilibrium. So part a) is correct with $4.15. Then part b) is a shortage of 1800. So option C is the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we analyze the supply and demand schedules to determine the equilibrium price and the market condition at a price of $4.00.

### Part (a): Finding the Equilibrium Price
Equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded (Qd) equals the quantity supplied (Qs). Examining the data:

- At $4.00: Qd = 3000, Qs = 1200 (not equal)
- At $4.05: Qd = 2800, Qs = 1600 (not equal)
- At $4.10: Qd = 2500, Qs = 1900 (not equal)
- At $4.15: Qd = 2100, Qs = 2100 (equal)
- At $4.20: Qd = 2000, Qs = 2450 (not equal)
- At $4.25: Qd = 1700, Qs = 2900 (not equal)

At $4.15, Qd and Qs both equal 2100, so the equilibrium price is **$4.15**.

### Part (b): Surplus or Shortage at $4.00
At a price of $4.00:
- Qd = 3000
- Qs = 1200

Since Qd (3000) exceeds Qs (1200), there is a **shortage**. The shortage is calculated as:

\[
\text{Shortage} = Qd - Qs = 3000 - 1200 = 1800 \, \text{units}
\]

### Final Answer
The equilibrium price is $4.15, and at $4.00, there is a shortage of 1800 units. Comparing this to the options, the correct choice is:

**C: $4.15, shortage of 1800 units**
