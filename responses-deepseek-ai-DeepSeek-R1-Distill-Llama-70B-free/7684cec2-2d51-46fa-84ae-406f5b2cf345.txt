Okay, so I've got this Python question to answer. The question is asking what the output of the statement "a" + "ab" would be in Python 3. Hmm, I remember that in Python, the plus sign is used for string concatenation. So when you have two strings and you use the + operator between them, it just sticks them together.

Let me think about this. The first string is "a" and the second is "ab". So adding them together should result in "a" followed by "ab". Wait, that would make "aab", right? Because "a" plus "ab" is like putting the two strings side by side without any space or anything else.

Looking at the options provided: option B is "aab". That makes sense. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up any other operations. Oh wait, could it be an error? Like, maybe if it's trying to add different data types, but no, both are strings. So adding them is straightforward.

I don't think any of the other options fit. Option D is "aba", which is a different arrangement. Option E is "ab", which is just the second string, but that's not right because we're adding both. Option F is "abab", which would be if it was something like "ab" + "ab", but that's not the case here.

So yeah, the correct output should be "aab", which is option B.

The output of the statement `"a" + "ab"` in Python 3 is the result of concatenating the two strings. When you use the `+` operator with strings, it simply joins them together. So `"a" + "ab"` becomes `"aab"`.

Option B is the correct answer.

B
