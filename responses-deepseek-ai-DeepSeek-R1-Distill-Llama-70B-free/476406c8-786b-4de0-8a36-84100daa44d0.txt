Okay, so I've got this problem here about the tensile strength of paper. Hmm, tensile strength is like how much stress it can take before breaking, right? The problem gives me the mean (mu) as 30 and the standard deviation (sigma) as 3. The sample size is 100. I need to find the probability that the sample mean is greater than 29.5 pounds per square inch.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with sample means, especially with large samples, the Central Limit Theorem applies. Oh right, the CLT says that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, even if the original distribution isn't. Since n=100 is a pretty large sample, that should work here.

So the sample mean's distribution has its own mean and standard deviation. The mean of the sample means (mu_x_bar) should be equal to the population mean, which is 30. And the standard deviation of the sample means, also called the standard error, is sigma divided by the square root of n. Let me calculate that: sigma is 3, n is 100. So sqrt(100) is 10. So standard error is 3/10 which is 0.3.

Now, I need to find P(X_bar > 29.5). Since X_bar follows a normal distribution, I can convert this to a Z-score. The Z formula is (X - mu) / (sigma_x_bar). Wait, no, wait. For the sample mean, it's (X_bar - mu) / (sigma / sqrt(n)). Oh right, same as what I just did.

So plugging in the numbers: X_bar is 29.5, mu is 30, sigma/sqrt(n) is 0.3. So Z = (29.5 - 30) / 0.3. Let's compute that. 29.5 -30 is -0.5, divided by 0.3 is approximately -1.6667. So the Z-score is about -1.6667.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 29.5 is less than 30, so the Z should be negative. But the problem asks for the probability that X_bar is greater than 29.5. Oh, right, so I'm looking for P(X_bar >29.5), which corresponds to the area to the right of 29.5 in the sample mean distribution.

But when I calculate the Z-score, it's for 29.5, which gives me Z = -1.6667. So I need to find the probability that Z is greater than -1.6667. Because in the standard normal distribution, Z is the standardized variable.

Alternatively, another way: The Z value for 29.5 is -1.6667. So P(X_bar >29.5) is the same as P(Z > -1.6667). In the standard normal table, that's the area to the right of Z=-1.67.

Looking up Z = -1.67. Wait, I should check how to read the table. The standard normal table gives the cumulative probability up to Z. So P(Z <= -1.67) is the area to the left. So to get P(Z > -1.67), I subtract that value from 1.

Looking up Z=-1.67, the table gives approximately 0.0475. So P(Z <= -1.67)=0.0475. Therefore, P(Z > -1.67) = 1 - 0.0475 = 0.9525.

Wait a minute, but my Z was approximately -1.6667, which is roughly -1.67. So the probability is about 0.9525.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.9522, which is very close. Another option is H which is 0.9772. No, that's much higher. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Z calculation. Let's recalculate that. X_bar is 29.5, mu is 30, so 29.5 -30 is -0.5. Divided by 0.3 is -0.5/0.3 = -1.6666..., yes, so Z is approximately -1.6667, which rounds to -1.67.

So the area beyond that is correct. So the probability is about 0.9525, which matches option A (0.9522) closely. Maybe the exact value is what's given in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise Z-table values. Let me think, sometimes tables have more decimal places. Let me see, Z of -1.67 is 0.0475? Or perhaps it's 0.0478? Wait, the exact value for Z=-1.67 could vary depending on the table. Let me think, sometimes it's better to use a calculator for more precision.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the empirical rule or another method, but I think using the Z-table is the right approach here.

Wait, another thought: could I have mixed up the Z calculation? Like, did I take (X_bar - mu) correctly? Yeah, 29.5 is less than 30, so it's negative. So Z is negative. So the area to the right of X_bar=29.5 is the area to the right of Z=-1.67, which is the same as 1 minus the area up to Z=-1.67.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a different approach, but I don't think so. The sample size is large, so using the normal distribution is correct.

So I think the correct answer is A: 0.9522.

To solve the problem, we use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that the distribution of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ will be approximately normal for large sample sizes. The mean of the sample mean distribution is equal to the population mean $\mu = 30$, and the standard deviation (standard error) is $\sigma / \sqrt{n} = 3 / \sqrt{100} = 0.3$.

We need to compute $P(\bar{X} > 29.5)$. First, we convert $\bar{X} = 29.5$ to a $Z$-score using the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
Z = \frac{29.5 - 30}{0.3} = \frac{-0.5}{0.3} \approx -1.6667
\]

This $Z$-score corresponds to the cumulative probability $P(Z \leq -1.6667)$. Using a standard normal distribution table, $P(Z \leq -1.67)$ is approximately $0.0475$. Therefore, the probability that $\bar{X}$ is greater than $29.5$ is:

\[
P(\bar{X} > 29.5) = P(Z > -1.6667) = 1 - P(Z \leq -1.6667) = 1 - 0.0475 = 0.9525
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to $0.9525$ is $0.9522$, which corresponds to option A.
