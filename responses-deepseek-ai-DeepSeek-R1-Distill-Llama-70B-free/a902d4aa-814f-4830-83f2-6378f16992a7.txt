Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a mesonic atom, which consists of a proton and a negatively charged muon. The muon has the same charge as an electron but a much larger mass—207 times the electron mass. The task is to calculate the ground-state energy, the radius of the first Bohr orbit, and the energy and frequency associated with the transition from n=1 to n=2. But wait, the options provided seem to be all about mass, which is confusing. Oh wait, looking again, the options are labeled A to J, each giving a mass in kg. So the actual question must be asking for one of these values, probably the reduced mass of the system, since the Bohr model often involves the reduced mass when dealing with two particles orbiting a common center.

Wait, but the original question in the problem statement says to calculate various things, but the multiple-choice options are all masses. Hmm, perhaps the question is actually asking for the reduced mass of the proton-muon system. Because in the Bohr model, when the nucleus isn't considered infinitely massive, you have to use the reduced mass of the two particles (the proton and the muon in this case) instead of just the electron mass.

So, the reduced mass μ is given by (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2). Here, m1 is the proton mass, m2 is the muon mass. Wait, the muon's mass is 207 times the electron mass, so m_muon = 207 m_e. But I need the proton mass in terms of m_e as well. I remember that the proton mass is about 1836 times the electron mass. So m_p = 1836 m_e.

So plugging into the reduced mass formula:

μ = (m_p * m_muon) / (m_p + m_muon)
= (1836 m_e * 207 m_e) / (1836 m_e + 207 m_e)
The m_e cancels out in numerator and denominator.

So numerator: 1836 * 207 = let me calculate that. 1836 * 200 is 367,200, and 1836 *7 is 12,852. So total is 367,200 +12,852= 380,052. So 380,052 m_e².

Denominator: 1836 + 207 = 2043 m_e.

So μ = (380,052 m_e²) / (2043 m_e) )= (380052 / 2043) m_e.

Let me calculate 380052 divided by 2043. Let's see: 2043 * 186 = 2043*(200-14) = 2043*200=408,600 minus 2043*14=28,602 → 408600-28602=379,998. Oh wait, that's very close to 380,052. So 2043 * 186 = 379,998. The difference is 380,052 - 379,998 =54. So 186 + 54/2043. So 186.026 approx. So μ ≈186.026 m_e.

Wait, but wait—the options are all in kg. So I need to express this reduced mass in kg. The electron mass m_e is approximately 9.10938356 ×10^-31 kg.

So μ = 186.026 * m_e ≈186.026 * 9.10938356e-31 kg.

Let me compute that. Let me approximate: 186 *9.1e-31 = (180 +6)*9.1e-31 = 180*9.1e-31 +6*9.1e-31 = 1638e-31 +54.6e-31 = 1692.6e-31 kg. Wait, 1692.6e-31 is 1.6926e-28 kg.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.69e-28 kg and option J is 1.87e-28. Hmm, but wait—wait, I think I made a miscalculation because the reduced mass is not 186 m_e, but wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait: m_p is 1836 m_e, m_muon is 207 m_e. So μ = (1836 *207 m_e²)/(1836 +207) m_e.

So 1836 +207 =2043.

Then 1836 *207 = let me compute again. 1800 *200=360,000. 1800*7=12,600. 36 *200=7,200. 36*7=252. So 360,000 +12,600=372,600 +7,200=379,800 +252=380,052. So 380,052 m_e² in the numerator. Divided by 2043 m_e in denominator: 380052/2043= let me compute that.

Wait, 2043 * 186 = 2043*(180+6)= (2043*180)= (2000*180)+(43*180)= 360,000 + 7,740=367,740. Then 2043*6=12,258. So 367,740+12,258=380,  740+258 is 998. So 380, 998? Wait, 367,740+12,258=379,998. Oh, right, so 2043 *186=379,998. Then 380,052 is 54 more than that. So 54/2043≈0.0264. So 186.0264 times m_e.

So 186.0264 * m_e = 186.0264 * 9.10938356e-31 kg.

Calculating 186 *9.10938356e-31:

First, compute 186 *9.10938356 = let's see:

186 *9 =1674.

186 *0.10938356 ≈ 186 *0.1 is 18.6, 186 *0.00938356≈ ~1.745. So total ≈18.6 +1.745≈20.345. So total 1674 +20.345≈1694.345.

So 1694.345e-31 kg = 1.694345e-28 kg. So approximately 1.69e-28 kg.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.69e-28 kg. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but let me double-check the approach. Because in the Bohr model, when you have two particles orbiting each other, you use the reduced mass. So the reduced mass is indeed (m_p * m_mu)/(m_p + m_mu). So yes, and I calculated that correctly.

The problem involves calculating the reduced mass of a proton-muon system in a mesonic atom, where the proton and muon orbit their common center of mass. The reduced mass is given by the formula:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_p \cdot m_{\mu}}{m_p + m_{\mu}}
\]

Here, the proton mass \(m_p\) is approximately \(1836 m_e\), and the muon mass \(m_{\mu}\) is \(207 m_e\), where \(m_e = 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg}\) is the electron mass. Substituting these values:

\[
\mu = \frac{(1836 m_e) \cdot (207 m_e)}{1836 m_e + 207 m_e}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\mu = \frac{380052 m_e^2}{2043 m_e} = \frac{380052}{2043} m_e
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\mu \approx 186.026 m_e
\]

Converting to kilograms:

\[
\mu \approx 186.026 \cdot 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \approx 1.694 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

This matches the value of option F, which is \(1.69 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{kg}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: \(1.69 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{kg}\)**
