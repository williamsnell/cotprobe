Okay, so I've got this group theory question here, and I need to figure out if the two statements are true or false. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's look at Statement 1: "If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5." 

Hmm, I remember that in group theory, the order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n equals the identity element. So if there's an element with order 10, that means when you raise it to the 10th power, you get the identity. But what about the other orders?

I think Lagrange's theorem comes into play here. Lagrange's theorem says that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group. Wait, but here we're talking about elements, not subgroups. Oh, right, the order of an element divides the order of the group. So if a group has an element of order 10, then the group's order must be a multiple of 10. But wait, the group's order isn't given here. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the cyclic subgroups. Because if you have an element of order 10, the cyclic subgroup it generates will have elements of orders that divide 10. So the orders possible are 1, 2, 5, and 10. So yes, the group must have elements of orders 1 (the identity), 2, 5, and 10. So Statement 1 seems true.

Now, Statement 2: "If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6." 

Okay, so if there's an element a with order 2 and an element b with order 3, does that mean there's an element of order 6? I'm trying to remember. I think this has to do with the product of the two elements. But wait, in a group, the order of the product of two elements doesn't just depend on their individual orders unless they commute, right?

So if a and b commute, then (ab)^n = a^n b^n. So if a has order 2 and b has order 3, then (ab)^6 = a^6 b^6 = (a^2)^3 (b^3)^2 = e*e = e. So the order of ab would be the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6. But wait, that's only if a and b commute. If they don't, then ab might have a different order.

So in a non-abelian group, ab might not have order 6. For example, consider the symmetric group S3. It has elements of order 2 (transpositions) and order 3 (3-cycles). Let's see: take a transposition like (1 2) which has order 2, and a 3-cycle like (1 2 3) which has order 3. Their product is (1 2)(1 2 3) = (1 3 2), which is another 3-cycle, so order 3. Wait, that's not order 6. Alternatively, maybe another product. Let's try (1 2 3)(1 2). That's (1 3). So again, order 2. Hmm, wait, maybe I did that wrong.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute (1 2 3) followed by (1 2). So permutation multiplication is function composition. So first apply (1 2), then apply (1 2 3). Let me write it properly. Let's say we have permutation a = (1 2) which is order 2, and permutation b = (1 2 3) which is order 3.

Compute ab: a followed by b. So ab would be (1 2) followed by (1 2 3). Let's apply this to element 1. First, (1 2) sends 1→2. Then (1 2 3) sends 2→3. So 1→3. For element 2: (1 2) sends 2→1, then (1 2 3) sends 1→2. So 2→2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the composition as (1 2 3) ∘ (1 2). So function composition is right to left.

Wait, wait, in permutation notation, the composition ab means first apply a, then apply b. So when you write ab(x), it's b(a(x)). So let me recompute ab.

Take x=1: a is (1 2), so a(1)=2. Then apply b=(1 2 3): b(2)=3. So ab(1)=3.

x=2: a(2)=1. Then b(1)=2. So ab(2)=2.

x=3: a(3)=3 (since a doesn't affect 3). Then b(3)=1. So ab(3)=1.

So ab is the permutation that maps 1→3, 3→1, and 2→2. So that's (1 3), which is a transposition, so order 2. So ab has order 2.

Wait, but b is order 3, a is order 2, and ab is order 2. So in this case, the product ab doesn't have order 6. Therefore, in S3, which has elements of order 2 and 3, but no element of order 6. Because S3 has order 6, and elements are of orders 1, 2, 3. So Statement 2 would be false because in this case, having elements of order 2 and 3 doesn't guarantee an element of order 6.

But wait, another example: in an abelian group, like the cyclic group of order 6. It has elements of order 2 and 3, and their product generates an element of order 6. So in that case, it works. But the statement is general. It says "if a group has...", so it's talking about any group.

So since in some groups (like S3) it's false, the statement isn't always true. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another moment. What about the least common multiple? The order of the product ab is the lcm of the orders of a and b only if a and b commute and their orders are coprime. In S3, a and b don't commute. So that's why their product doesn't have order 6.

So Statement 2 is not necessarily true. So Statement 2 is false.

So now, looking back at the options:

Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. So the correct option is C: True, False.

Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.  
This is true. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group. If a group has an element of order 10, the cyclic subgroup generated by this element will have elements of orders that divide 10, specifically 1, 2, 5, and 10. Therefore, the group must contain elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.

Statement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.  
This is false. While it is true that in an abelian group, the product of an element of order 2 and an element of order 3 will have order 6 (since they commute), this is not necessarily the case in a non-abelian group. For example, in the symmetric group \( S_3 \), there are elements of order 2 (e.g., transpositions) and order 3 (e.g., 3-cycles), but their product does not have order 6. Thus, the statement does not hold in general.

Options:  
A: True, True  
B: False, False  
C: True, False  
D: False, True  

The correct choice is **C: True, False**.
