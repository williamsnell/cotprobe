Okay, so I've got this question about Spitz's 1945 study on sensory deprivation in a social setting. Hmm, I remember that Spitz did some work related to deprivation and its effects on children. Let me think.

Wait, wasn't he the one who studied how a lack of stimulation affects infants? Oh right, I think he looked at babies who were deprived of social interaction. He observed them in foundling homes or something like that. Those places probably had limited sensory and social stimulation because of understaffing or maybe the babies were left alone a lot.

So, in his study, he found that these babies didn't develop normally. They had issues like developmental delays, maybe even failure to thrive. I remember something about 'anaclitic depression' from his work. That's when infants become depressed because they don't get the social interaction they need. It can lead to serious health problems.

The question is asking what his findings suggest. The options are A through J. Let me go through them.

Option A says social deprivation has no impact on emotional growth. No, that's the opposite of what Spitz found. He showed it does have a significant negative impact.

Option B suggests that both sensory and social deprivation enhance development. That can't be right. His study showed negative effects, not positive.

Option C claims sensory deprivation improves problem-solving. I don't think so. The effects were harmful, not beneficial.

Option D suggests social deprivation leads to accelerated cognitive development. No, cognitive development was hindered, not helped.

E says it only affects physical growth. But Spitz's work was more about emotional and developmental issues, not just physical.

F says it only affects language development. Again, the issues were broader than just language.

G: beneficial for short periods. No, the effects were negative regardless of duration, I think.

H: No effect on development. Definitely wrong, as his study showed clear adverse effects.

I: Both types of deprivation can adversely affect normal development. This sounds right. Spitz found that without proper stimulation and social interaction, infants didn't develop normally.

J: leads to improved social skills later. No, the opposite happened. The children had more issues socially and developmentally.

So the correct answer should be I.

Spitz's 1945 study focused on the effects of sensory and social deprivation on infants in settings like foundling homes, where stimulation and interaction were limited. His findings revealed significant negative impacts, including developmental delays, emotional issues, and conditions like 'anaclitic depression.' These outcomes highlighted that both sensory and social deprivation can adversely affect normal development, leading to various developmental problems rather than any positive effects.

The correct answer is:

I: Sensory and social deprivation can adversely affect normal development.

Answer: I
