Okay, so I've got this economics question here about DVD players and how an increase in household income affects the market equilibrium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says DVD players are a normal good, and the market is competitive. All else equal, what happens when household income increases. The options are A to J, each with different combinations of changes in price and quantity.

Wait, normal goods—right, those are goods where demand increases when income increases. Unlike inferior goods, where demand decreases with higher income. So if income goes up, people buy more DVD players.

In a competitive market, the market equilibrium is where supply and demand meet. So if demand increases, the demand curve shifts to the right. Let me visualize that. The supply curve is usually upward sloping because as price increases, suppliers are willing to supply more. The demand curve is downward sloping, and when income increases for a normal good, demand increases at every price level.

So when demand shifts right, the equilibrium point moves along the supply curve. Since supply is upward sloping, a higher quantity will correspond to a higher price. So both equilibrium quantity and price should increase.

Wait, but the options don't all have both increasing. Let me look again.

Option G says both increase. Option E says price increases but quantity ambiguous. Wait, why would quantity be ambiguous? No, in a standard case, when demand increases, quantity definitely increases because suppliers respond by producing more. So price goes up because the supply curve is upward sloping.

So the correct answer should be that both equilibrium quantity and price increase. Looking at the options, G is "increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price." That fits.

Wait, but another thought—could the supply curve shift? The question says all else equal, so probably only demand shifts. So yes, only demand shifts right, leading to higher price and quantity.

I don't think any other option makes sense. So the answer must be G.

In a competitive market where DVD players are a normal good, an increase in household income leads to an increase in demand. This is because normal goods have a positive relationship between income and demand. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the right. In a competitive market, the supply curve is upward sloping, meaning that as the price increases, suppliers are incentivized to produce more. Consequently, the new equilibrium point, where the shifted demand curve intersects the supply curve, will have both a higher equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** correctly states that both the equilibrium quantity and price increase, which aligns with the analysis above.
- Other options either suggest ambiguous or incorrect changes in price or quantity, which do not match the expected outcome of a demand shift for a normal good in a competitive market.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: Increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.

Answer: G
