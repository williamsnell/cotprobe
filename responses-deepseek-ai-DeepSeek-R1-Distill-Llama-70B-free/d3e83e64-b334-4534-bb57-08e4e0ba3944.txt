Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jack Conlon's earnings. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

So, Jack is employed on a salary-plus-commission basis. That means he gets a base salary plus a commission based on his sales. The problem says he receives a salary of $200 a week, and a commission of 3% of his sales. His sales over a two-week period were $3,550. I need to calculate his total earnings for these two weeks.

Alright, breaking it down. First, his salary. He gets $200 each week. Since it's over two weeks, I multiply the weekly salary by two. So that's 200 * 2. Let me do that math: 200 times 2 is $400. So his salary for two weeks is $400.

Next, the commission part. He gets 3% commission on his sales. His total sales were $3,550. So I need to find 3% of 3,550. Hmm, how do I calculate that? Well, percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100. So 3% is 0.03. Multiply that by the sales amount.

Let me compute 3,550 * 0.03. Let me see, 3,000 * 0.03 is 90, and 550 * 0.03 is 16.5. Adding those together gives 90 + 16.5 = 106.5. So his commission is $106.50.

Now, to find the total earnings, I need to add the salary and the commission together. So that's $400 (salary) plus $106.50 (commission). Let me add those: 400 + 100 is 500, and then +6.50 makes it 506.50. So total earnings are $506.50.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches. Let me check the options:

Option A: $610.50 → That's higher than my calculation.
Option B: $455 → No, lower.
Option C: $560.50 → No.
Option D: $600 → No.
Option E: $700 → No.
Option F: $350.50 → No.
Option G: $406.50 → No.
Option H: $256.50 → No.
Option I: $300.50 → No.
Option J: $506.50 → Yes, that's exactly what I got.

Wait, just to double-check. Salary is 200 per week times 2 is 400. Commission is 3% of 3550, which I calculated as 106.50. 400 + 106.50 is 506.50, which is option J. Yep, that seems right.

Jack Conlon's earnings are calculated by adding his salary and commission over a two-week period. His salary is $200 per week, so for two weeks, it totals $400. His commission is 3% of his sales, which were $3,550. Calculating 3% of $3,550 gives $106.50. Adding the salary and commission together results in total earnings of $506.50, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
