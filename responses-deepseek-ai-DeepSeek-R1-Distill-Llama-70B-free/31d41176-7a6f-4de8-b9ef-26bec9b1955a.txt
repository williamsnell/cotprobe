Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about excess disability, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what excess disability means. From what I remember, disability in a medical context refers to any condition that limits a person's ability to perform certain activities. But what's "excess" about it? I think it's about having more disabilities than what's typically expected from a particular condition.

So the question is asking which option correctly describes excess disability. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Not due to the disease but due instead to malignant social psychology. Hmm, malignant social psychology sounds like it's related to social factors or maybe psychological issues caused by the environment. So this would mean the symptoms are not from the disease itself but from social or psychological factors. I'm not sure if that's what excess disability refers to. I thought excess disability is more about the severity beyond what's expected from the disease, not the cause.

Option B: Experienced only by individuals over a certain age. I don't think age is the defining factor here. Excess disability could happen to anyone, regardless of age, depending on their condition. So probably not B.

Option C: In excess of the average for that particular disorder. Oh, this sounds more like it. If a disorder usually results in a certain level of disability, excess would mean more than that average. So this could be the right choice.

Option D: Symptoms as a side effect of treatment. Wait, that's more about iatrogenic effects or treatment side effects. Excess disability isn't about treatment causing more symptoms, but rather the symptoms being worse than expected from the disease itself.

Option E: Symptoms not related to any disease but due to a mental disorder. So this is about mental disorders causing symptoms unrelated to a physical disease. I'm not sure how this ties into excess disability. It seems like a separate issue.

Option F: Symptoms exacerbated by comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions mean other health issues occurring alongside the primary one. So if someone has another condition that makes their symptoms worse, that could contribute to excess disability. But is that the definition? I'm a bit confused here. I thought excess disability is more about the symptoms being beyond what's typical, regardless of other conditions.

Option G: Those that appear only after the disease has been cured. That doesn't make sense. If the disease is cured, why would disabilities appear? Maybe in some cases, but I don't think that's excess disability.

Option H: Those that only appear in chronic diseases. No, excess disability can occur in any disease, not just chronic ones. So this might not be correct.

Option I: Those that can be successfully treated if caught early. This is more about early intervention and treatment effectiveness, not about the excess nature of the disability itself.

Option J: Found only in the last stage of Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's does have stages, but I don't think excess disability is specific to any particular disease or stage.

Putting it all together, the key idea is that excess disability refers to the severity of symptoms beyond what's typically expected for a given disorder. So option C says "in excess of the average for that particular disorder," which fits perfectly. Option F is about comorbid conditions making symptoms worse, but I'm not sure if that's the exact definition of excess disability. It could be a contributing factor, but I think the primary definition is about exceeding the average.

Wait, another thought: sometimes excess disability can be due to other factors like comorbidities or even social factors. But the question is about what excess disability refers to. From what I've read before, excess disability is when the actual disability is greater than what would be expected from the disease alone. So it's about the symptoms being worse than average. That makes option C the correct choice.

Excess disability refers to symptoms or functional limitations that exceed the expected level for a particular condition. It describes a situation where the severity of the disability is greater than what is typically associated with the disorder. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** refers to symptoms caused by social psychology, not the disease, which is unrelated to the concept of excess disability.  
- **Option B** limits the condition to a specific age group, which doesn't align with the definition.  
- **Option C** correctly identifies excess disability as symptoms that exceed the average for the disorder, fitting the definition.  
- **Option D** discusses treatment side effects, which is unrelated to excess disability.  
- **Option E** focuses on mental disorders causing unrelated symptoms, which is not the same as excess disability.  
- **Option F** mentions comorbid conditions worsening symptoms, which could contribute to excess disability but isn't the defining characteristic.  
- **Option G** suggests symptoms appearing after a disease is cured, which contradicts the concept.  
- **Option H** restricts excess disability to chronic diseases, which is incorrect.  
- **Option I** emphasizes early treatment, which is about intervention, not the definition of excess disability.  
- **Option J** ties excess disability to a specific stage of Alzheimer's, which is too narrow.  

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes excess disability as symptoms exceeding the average for a particular disorder.
