Question:

Carl the clothier owns a large garment factory on an isolated island. Carl's factory is the only source of employment for most of the islanders, and thus Carl acts as a monopsonist. The supply curve for garment workers is given by l = 80w, where l is the number of workers hired and w is their hourly wage. Assume also that Carl's labor demand (marginal revenue product) curve is given by l = 400 - 40MRP_l. How many workers will Carl hire to maximize his profits?

Options:

A: 270
B: 180
C: 250
D: 220
E: 100
F: 120
G: 200
H: 150
I: 300
J: 350

Okay, so I have this economics problem here about Carl the clothier and his garment factory. Let me try to understand what's going on. So, Carl's factory is the only source of employment on this isolated island, which means he's a monopsonist. Monopsony is when there's only one buyer in the market, right? So in this case, Carl is the sole buyer of labor.

The question is asking how many workers Carl will hire to maximize his profits. They've given me the supply curve and the demand curve for labor. Let me note those down.

The supply curve is given by l = 80w, where l is the number of workers and w is the hourly wage. Wait, usually the supply curve in labor markets is upward sloping, so as wage increases, more workers are willing to supply their labor. So this equation makes sense because if w increases, l increases. So at higher wages, more workers are available.

Then the labor demand curve, which is the marginal revenue product (MRP) curve, is given by l = 400 - 40MRP_l. Hmm, wait that's a bit confusing because l is on both sides. Oh wait, maybe I should rearrange it. Let me write it as MRP_l = (400 - l)/40. So MRP_l is the marginal revenue product of labor, which is the demand for labor.

In a monopsony, the firm will hire where the marginal cost of labor equals the marginal revenue product. So I need to find the point where MCL (marginal cost of labor) equals MRP.

But wait, what's the marginal cost of labor here? Since Carl is a monopsonist, he faces the supply curve as his labor supply. So the marginal cost is not just the supply curve itself but the derivative of the total cost with respect to labor, which in this case would be the supply curve's slope.

Wait, the supply curve is l = 80w. So solving for w, we get w = l/80. So the average cost (and in this case, since it's the supply, it's the wage per worker) is w = l/80.

But marginal cost is a bit different. For a monopsonist, the MCL is the derivative of the total labor cost with respect to l. Wait, no, actually, the MCL is the additional cost of hiring one more worker. So when you hire an additional worker, the wage doesn't just increase for that worker but for all workers, because the supply curve is upward sloping. So the MCL will be higher than the average wage.

Let me think. The total cost (TC) is the wage multiplied by the number of workers. Since w = l/80, then TC = (l/80) * l = l² /80.

So, the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of TC with respect to l. So d(TC)/dl = (2l)/80 = l/40.

So MCL = l/40.

Wait, that makes sense. The supply curve is l =80w, so w = l/80. The TC is w*l = (l^2)/80. So dTC/dl is (2l)/80 = l/40. So yes, MCL is l/40.

Now, the MRP is given by MRP_l = (400 - l)/40. So the profit-maximizing condition is when MCL = MRP.

So set MCL equal to MRP. That would be:

l/40 = (400 - l)/40.

Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Oh wait, no, because MCL is l/40, and MRP is (400 - l)/40. So setting them equal:

l/40 = (400 - l)/40.

Wait, if I multiply both sides by 40, I get l = 400 - l.

So l + l = 400.

2l = 400 => l = 200.

Wait, but this can't be right because when I look at the options, 200 is option G. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in how I set up MCL. Let me go back.

The supply curve is l = 80w, which gives w = l/80. So the total cost is w*l = (l/80)*l = l²/80. Therefore, the marginal cost is the derivative of TC with respect to l, which is (2l)/80 = l/40. So MCL is indeed l/40.

The MRP is given by the equation l =400 -40 MRP_l. So solving for MRP_l gives MRP_l = (400 - l)/40.

So the condition for profit maximization is MCL = MRP, so l/40 = (400 - l)/40.

Simplifying, l = 400 - l → 2l =400 → l=200.

So according to this, the answer would be 200 workers, which is option G.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the demand and supply curves.

In a monopsony, the MRP curve is the demand for labor, and the supply curve is given. The firm will hire where MRP equals MCL.

Wait, but maybe I should think again about the MRP equation. The problem says Carl's labor demand (marginal revenue product) curve is given by l =400 -40 MRP_l. So let me write that as MRP_l = (400 - l)/40.

So yes, that's correct.

Another approach: Let me plot these or think about their slopes.

The supply curve is l =80w, so w = (1/80) l. So for every additional worker, the wage increases by 1/80.

The MCL is the derivative, which is l/40, as I calculated before.

The MRP is (400 - l)/40. So when l=0, MRP is 10. For each additional worker, MRP decreases by 1/40.

So at equilibrium where MCL=MRP:

l/40 = (400 - l)/40 → l=400 - l → l=200.

Yes, that seems consistent.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the MRP is calculated as the MRP = marginal product (MP) * price. But in this problem, MRP is given directly, so maybe that's not necessary.

So I think the correct answer is 200, which is option G.

Carl the clothier operates as a monopsonist, meaning he is the sole buyer of labor on the island. To determine how many workers he will hire to maximize profits, we need to find the point where the marginal cost of labor (MCL) equals the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor.

The supply curve is given by \( l = 80w \), where \( l \) is the number of workers and \( w \) is the hourly wage. Solving for \( w \), we get \( w = \frac{l}{80} \). The total cost (TC) of hiring \( l \) workers is then:

\[
TC = w \cdot l = \frac{l}{80} \cdot l = \frac{l^2}{80}.
\]

The marginal cost of labor (MCL) is the derivative of total cost with respect to \( l \):

\[
MCL = \frac{d(TC)}{dl} = \frac{2l}{80} = \frac{l}{40}.
\]

The labor demand curve (MRP) is given by \( l = 400 - 40MRP_l \). Rearranging for \( MRP_l \), we get:

\[
MRP_l = \frac{400 - l}{40}.
\]

To maximize profits, Carl will hire workers where \( MCL = MRP \). Setting the two equations equal:

\[
\frac{l}{40} = \frac{400 - l}{40}.
\]

Multiplying through by 40 to simplify:

\[
l = 400 - l.
\]

Solving for \( l \):

\[
2l = 400 \quad \Rightarrow \quad l = 200.
\]

Thus, Carl will hire 200 workers to maximize his profits. The correct answer is:

**G: 200**
