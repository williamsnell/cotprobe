Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about logic terms, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question says: "Each term must be used twice, no more and no less" is a requirement for which of the options given. The options are from A to J, each referring to different logical concepts.

Hmm, I remember that in categorical syllogisms, there are certain rules about the use of terms. Let me think. A categorical syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning consisting of three parts: the major premise, the minor premise, and the conclusion. Each syllogism has three terms, each appearing twice.

Wait, right! In a valid categorical syllogism, each term must appear exactly twice. That's one of the rules to ensure validity. So the middle term, which is the one that appears in both premises but not in the conclusion, must be used twice. The other two terms (the major and minor) each appear once in a premise and once in the conclusion. So each term is used twice in total across the syllogism.

Let me make sure I'm not confusing this with other types of syllogisms. Modus ponens and tollens are about conditional statements, not specifically about term usage counts. Dilemmas involve two conditional statements and a disjunction, so that's different. Disjunctive syllogism deals with OR statements, again not about term counts. Hypothetical syllogisms are about if-then structures, not the number of term uses. So those options (A, B, D, F) probably aren't the right fit.

The question is about a requirement where each term is used twice. So I think it's pointing to categorical syllogisms. Looking at the options, option J is "valid categorical syllogism." So that must be the correct answer.

The requirement that "each term must be used twice, no more and no less" specifically applies to a valid categorical syllogism. In such syllogisms, there are three terms, each of which must appear exactly twice across the premises and the conclusion to ensure logical validity. This rule ensures proper structure and avoids errors like the "undistributed middle" fallacy.

Answer: J
