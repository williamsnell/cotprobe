Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about a uniform solid disk rolling down an inclined plane without slipping. I need to find what fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy. Hmm, right, I remember that when an object rolls without slipping, both translational and rotational motion are involved.

First, I think I should recall the formulas for the different types of kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy (KE_total) of the rolling object should be the sum of its translational kinetic energy and its rotational kinetic energy. 

Translational kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. Rotational kinetic energy is (1/2)Iω², where I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity.

Wait, but since it's a solid disk, the moment of inertia I must be (1/2)mr². Right, because for a solid cylinder, or disk, the moment is (1/2)mr squared, where r is the radius.

So, putting that together, the rotational KE is (1/2) * (1/2 m r²) * ω². Simplifying that, it's (1/4) m r² ω².

But wait, since the disk is rolling without slipping, there's a relationship between the linear velocity v and the angular velocity ω. Oh right, v = rω. So ω = v/r. Let me substitute that into the rotational KE equation.

So rotational KE becomes (1/4) m r² (v²/r²) = (1/4) m v². That's neat, so the rotational part is (1/4)mv².

Now the translational part is (1/2)mv². So the total kinetic energy is the sum of these two. Let me add them up: (1/4 + 1/2) mv². Wait, 1/4 plus 1/2 is 3/4. So total KE is (3/4)mv².

Wait, no, wait. Because (1/2)mv² is translational, (1/4)mv² is rotational. So the sum is (1/2 + 1/4) = 3/4 mv². So the total KE is 3/4 mv squared.

But the question is asking for the fraction that is rotational. So the rotational KE is (1/4 mv²) divided by the total KE, which is (3/4 mv²). The mass and velocity squared cancel out, so it's (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought the answer was 1/2 for a sphere or something else. Hmm, but wait, let me check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia. Oh wait, no—for a solid disk, I is (1/2)mr², correct. So rotational KE is (1/2)Iω² = (1/2)(1/2 m r^2)(ω^2) = (1/4 m r^2 ω²). But with v = rω, so ω = v/r.

Substituting that in, (1/4 m r² (v²/r²)) = (1/4 m v²). Correct.

Translational KE is (1/2 mv²). So total KE is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 mv². So the rotational part is 1/4 of the total, which would be 1/4 divided by 3/4, which is 1/3. So the fraction is 1/3?

Wait, but I remember that for a solid sphere, the fraction is higher. Let me think again. Maybe I should approach it differently. Oh wait, another way to approach this is to consider that for rolling without slipping, the acceleration is determined by the moment of inertia.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy ratios. Since KE_total = KE_translational + KE_rotational.

In the case of the disk, the moment of inertia I = 1/2 mr². So the rotational KE is (1/2 I ω²) = (1/2)(1/2 m r²)(v²/r²) ) = 1/4 m v². And the translational is 1/2 m v². So the ratio is (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3. So the rotational is 1/3 of the total. So the answer would be 1/3, which is option J.

Wait, but another approach: the general expression for the fraction of rotational KE is (I/(m r²)) divided by (1 + I/(m r²)) because KE_total = (1/2 m v²)(1 + I/(m r²)) ). Since I/(m r²) for a disk is (1/2), so the fraction is (1/2)/(1 + 1/2) = (1/2)/(3/2) )= 1/3.

Yes, that confirms it. So the answer is 1/3. Looking at the options, option J is 1/3. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy, we start by analyzing the two components of kinetic energy: translational and rotational.

1. **Translational Kinetic Energy**:  
   The translational kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{translational}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]  
   where \(m\) is the mass and \(v\) is the linear velocity.

2. **Rotational Kinetic Energy**:  
   The rotational kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
   \]  
   where \(I\) is the moment of inertia and \(\omega\) is the angular velocity. For a uniform solid disk, the moment of inertia is:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{2} m r^2
   \]  
   Substituting this into the rotational kinetic energy equation:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2} m r^2\right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{4} m r^2 \omega^2
   \]  
   Using the no-slip condition (\(v = r \omega\)), we substitute \(\omega = \frac{v}{r}\):  
   \[
   KE_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{1}{4} m v^2
   \]

3. **Total Kinetic Energy**:  
   The total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational and rotational components:  
   \[
   KE_{\text{total}} = KE_{\text{translational}} + KE_{\text{rotational}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{1}{4} m v^2 = \frac{3}{4} m v^2
   \]

4. **Fraction of Rotational Kinetic Energy**:  
   The fraction of the total kinetic energy that is rotational is:  
   \[
   \text{Fraction} = \frac{KE_{\text{rotational}}}{KE_{\text{total}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} m v^2}{\frac{3}{4} m v^2} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

The correct answer is **J: 1/3**.
