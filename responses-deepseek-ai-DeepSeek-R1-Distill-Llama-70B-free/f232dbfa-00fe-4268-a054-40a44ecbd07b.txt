Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about universal screening data in schools. The question is asking what must be done when very few students are meeting the school competencies. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that universal screening is used to identify which students might need extra help. If the data shows that very few are succeeding, it means a lot of students are struggling. So the school needs to take some action to address this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Invest in more modern educational technology. That might help, but is it a must? I'm not sure. It depends on the situation. Maybe the current tech is fine, but the teaching methods are the issue.

Option B: Place students not meeting competencies in lower grades. That doesn't sound right. Lowering their grade level could be discouraging and might not address the root cause. Plus, it's not necessarily a required action.

Option C: Give students more time to develop competencies. That makes sense in some cases, like extending the school year or providing extra tutoring time. But is this the immediate must-do step?

Option D: Hire more teachers to reduce class size. Smaller classes can help, but it's a resource-intensive solution. I'm not sure if this is a required action or just a possible one.

Option E: Contact parents for meetings. Communication with parents is important, but is it the first thing that must happen when the screening data shows low success? Maybe, but I'm not certain it's the primary action required.

Option F: Provide strategic or supplemental instruction. This sounds like targeted help for students who are struggling. That seems necessary because if they're not meeting competencies, they need extra support.

Option G: Change the core program delivery. If the core teaching methods aren't working for most students, changing how the program is delivered makes sense. This could involve different teaching strategies or materials.

Option H: Lower the competency standards. That might make the numbers look better, but it doesn't help the students. Lowering standards isn't a solution; it's more of a workaround.

Option I: Evaluate students for learning disabilities. That's important for individual cases, but the question is about a broad issue where few students are succeeding. It's not necessarily that all of them have disabilities.

Option J: Increase homework. More homework doesn't necessarily lead to better understanding, especially if the students are already struggling. It could even be counterproductive.

So, the question is about what must be done. From what I remember in education strategies, when universal screening shows poor results, the school should look into their core instructional program. If too many students are failing, the problem might be with how the material is being taught. So they should make changes there, which is option G.

But wait, another thought: the Response to Intervention (RTI) model suggests that when students aren't responding to the core instruction, they should receive supplemental or strategic instruction. So option F is about providing that extra help, which is a required step. 

Hmm, now I'm a bit confused. Which one is it? The question is about what "must" be done. Both G and F seem like possible correct answers, but I need to determine which is required.

In the context of school-wide data, if the majority aren't meeting competencies, it's likely an issue with the core instruction. So changing the delivery of the core program (G) would be necessary. Alternatively, providing supplemental instruction (F) is also a must because those students need additional support beyond the core.

Wait, maybe both are correct steps. But the question is about which must be done. So perhaps both F and G are actions that need to happen. But looking at the options, I can only choose one.

I think the most immediate action when the core program isn't effective is to change how it's delivered. So option G would be the correct answer. Because if the core isn't working, you need to adjust it to better meet the students' needs.

Alternatively, maybe the must-do is providing extra help for the students who are struggling, which is option F. Because even if the core is changed, those students still need support now.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what's typically required in such situations. In educational policies, when screening data indicates that many students are not meeting competencies, schools are often required to provide additional support. So option F would be a must because those students need interventions.

Wait, but sometimes the core program might be the issue. So the school must change that. But the question is about what must be done, not what could be done. 

I think the correct answer is F: Students who are not meeting competencies must be given strategic or supplemental instruction. Because providing targeted support is a necessary step when students aren't meeting standards, regardless of the core program changes.

When universal screening data indicates that very few students are meeting school competencies, it is essential to identify the root cause and take appropriate action. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** suggests investing in modern technology, but this is not necessarily a required step unless the current tools are inadequate.
- **Option B** proposes moving students to lower grade levels, which could be discouraging and does not address the core issue.
- **Option C** recommends giving students more time, which might help but is not an immediate or guaranteed solution.
- **Option D** involves hiring more teachers to reduce class size, a resource-intensive approach that may not be feasible or required.
- **Option E** focuses on contacting parents, which is important for communication but not the primary action needed.
- **Option F** emphasizes providing strategic or supplemental instruction, a necessary step to support struggling students.
- **Option G** suggests changing the delivery of the core program, which may be necessary if the current methods are ineffective.
- **Option H** proposes lowering competency standards, which is counterproductive and not a solution.
- **Option I** recommends evaluating students for learning disabilities, which is relevant for individual cases but not the broad issue here.
- **Option J** suggests increasing homework, which may not address the underlying struggles.

While both **Option F** (providing supplemental instruction) and **Option G** (changing the core program) are plausible, the question asks what "must" be done. Providing strategic or supplemental instruction is a necessary and immediate step to support students who are struggling, making **Option F** the correct choice.

Answer: F
