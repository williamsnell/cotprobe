Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the current when a voltage is applied across an impedance. The voltage is given as 25 angle 45 degrees, and the impedance is 4 minus j2 ohms. I'm a bit rusty on my electrical engineering, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that Ohm's Law works for AC circuits too, but in complex numbers. Ohm's Law is V = I * Z, so to find current I, I should divide the voltage V by the impedance Z. That makes sense.

So the voltage V is 25∠45°, which is in polar form. The impedance Z is 4 - j2, which is in rectangular form. Since dividing complex numbers is easier in polar form, maybe I should convert the impedance to polar form first.

Wait, alternatively, I can convert the voltage to rectangular form and then perform the division. Hmm, but maybe converting both to polar or both to rectangular. Let me think. Oh wait, no—Ohm's Law in AC says current I is V over Z. So if V is in polar, I can convert Z to polar, then divide.

So let me first find the impedance in polar form. The impedance Z is 4 - j2. To convert to polar, I need the magnitude and angle.

The magnitude of Z is sqrt( (4)^2 + (-2)^2 ) = sqrt(16 +4) = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). Oh wait, sqrt(20)=2*sqrt(5), right.

The angle theta is arctangent of (imaginary part / real part). But wait, since the imaginary part is negative, the impedance is in the fourth quadrant. So theta is arctan( (-2)/4 ) = arctan(-0.5). Let me calculate that. Arctan(0.5) is about 26.565 degrees, but since it's negative and in the fourth quadrant, the angle is -26.565 degrees.

So Z in polar form is 2√5 ∠ -26.565°.

Now, the voltage V is 25 ∠45°. So current I is V/Z. In polar form, dividing the magnitudes and subtracting the angles.

So the magnitude of I is 25 / (2√5 ). Let's compute that. 25 divided by 2 is 12.5, and 12.5 divided by sqrt(5) is 12.5 / 2.236 approx 5.59. Wait, but maybe it's better to rationalize. Let's see:

25/(2√5) = (25√5)/(2*5) )= (5√5)/2 ≈ (5*2.236)/2 ≈ 5.59, which is about 5.59 A. But maybe I should leave it in exact terms for now.

The angle of I is 45° - (-26.565°) = 71.565 degrees. So approximately 71.57 degrees.

So in polar form, current I is (25/(2√5)) ∠71.565°. Let's compute 25/(2√5). As I said earlier, that simplifies to (5√5)/2, which is 2.5√5. So the polar form is 2.5√5 ∠71.565°, which I can write as approximately 71.6°.

Now, for the rectangular form. I can convert the polar form of I into rectangular.

The magnitude is 2.5√5, and the angle is about 71.6 degrees.

So the real part is magnitude * cos(theta), and the imaginary part is magnitude * sin(theta).

Calculating cos(71.6°) and sin(71.6°). Let's see, cos(71.6) is approximately 0.316, and sin(71.6) is approximately 0.948.

So real part: 2.5√5 * 0.316. Let's compute 2.5√5 first. √5 is about 2.236, so 2.5*2.236 ≈5.59. Then multiply by 0.316: 5.59 * 0.316 ≈ 1.768 A.

Imaginary part: 5.59 * 0.948 ≈ 5.30 A.

Wait, but wait a second. Actually, when I convert from polar to rectangular, I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I can use exact expressions.

Wait, the polar form is 2.5√5 at 71.565 degrees. So:

Real part: 2.5√5 * cos(71.565°)
Imaginary part: 2.5√5 * sin(71.565°)

Wait, 71.565 degrees is close to 71.565, which is actually arctangent(3), because tan(71.565) is 3. Let me check: tan(60)=√3≈1.732, tan(71.565)=3 exactly, yes. So the angle is arctan(3), which is 71.565°. So that means the triangle has opposite side 3, adjacent 1, hypotenuse sqrt(1^2 +3^2)=sqrt(10).

Wait, but wait, in this case, for the current, the angle is 71.565, so cos(theta)=1/sqrt(10), sin(theta)=3/sqrt(10).

So real part: 2.5√5 * (1/√10) = 2.5√5 / sqrt(10) = 2.5 * sqrt(5/10) )= 2.5 * sqrt(0.5) = 2.5*(√2/2) )= approximately 1.7678 A.

Imaginary part: 2.5√5 * (3/√10) )= 2.5 *3 * sqrt(5/10) )= 7.5 * (√(0.5)) )= 7.5*(√2/2) )= 7.5*(0.7071)= approx 5.3025 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, maybe it's better to express this in terms of sqrt(2). Let me compute exactly:

Real part: (2.5√5) * (1/√10) )= 2.5 * sqrt(5/10) )= 2.5 * sqrt(1/2) )= 2.5 * (√2/2) )= (2.5/2) * √2 )= 1.25√2.

Similarly, the imaginary part: (2.5√5) * (3/√10) )= 2.5*3 * sqrt(5/10) )= 7.5 * sqrt(1/2) )= 7.5*(√2/2) )= (7.5/2)*√2 )= 3.75√2.

So the rectangular form is 1.25√2 + j3.75√2 A.

Now, looking at the options, let me check each one.

Option B: Polar is 2.5√5 ∠71.6°, rectangular is 1.25√2 +j3.75√2 A. That matches what I got.

Wait, what about option J? Let me check.

Option J says polar is 2.5√5∠51.6°, which is not correct, because our angle was 71.6°, so J is wrong.

Option G: Polar is 1.5√5∠71.6°, which is wrong because the magnitude is 2.5√5.

Option F: Polar is same as B, but rectangular is 1.35√2 + j3.75√2. Hmm, that doesn't match our calculation. So F seems wrong.

Wait, why did I think 71.6 degrees? Because 45 +26.565 is 71.565, which is approximately 71.6. So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option B, which has polar form 2.5√5∠71.6° and rectangular 1.25√2 + j3.75√2 A.

To determine the current in both rectangular and polar forms when a voltage of \(25 \angle 45^\circ \, \text{V}\) is applied to an impedance of \(4 - j2 \, \Omega\), we use Ohm's Law for AC circuits: \(I = \frac{V}{Z}\).

### Step 1: Convert the impedance to polar form
The impedance \(Z = 4 - j2\) is in rectangular form. To convert it to polar form:
- **Magnitude**: \(|Z| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\).
- **Angle**: \(\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{-2}{4}\right) = \arctan(-0.5) = -26.565^\circ\).

Thus, \(Z = 2\sqrt{5} \angle -26.565^\circ\).

### Step 2: Divide the voltage by the impedance
The voltage \(V = 25 \angle 45^\circ\). Using polar division:
- **Magnitude**: \(|I| = \frac{|V|}{|Z|} = \frac{25}{2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{25\sqrt{5}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{5\sqrt{5}}{2} = 2.5\sqrt{5}\).
- **Angle**: \(\phi = 45^\circ - (-26.565^\circ) = 71.565^\circ \approx 71.6^\circ\).

Thus, in polar form, \(I = 2.5\sqrt{5} \angle 71.6^\circ\).

### Step 3: Convert the current to rectangular form
To convert \(I = 2.5\sqrt{5} \angle 71.6^\circ\) to rectangular form:
- **Real part**: \(I_r = |I| \cos(\phi) = 2.5\sqrt{5} \cdot \cos(71.6^\circ)\).
- **Imaginary part**: \(I_i = |I| \sin(\phi) = 2.5\sqrt{5} \cdot \sin(71.6^\circ)\).

Using \(\cos(71.6^\circ) \approx 0.316\) and \(\sin(71.6^\circ) \approx 0.948\):
- \(I_r = 2.5\sqrt{5} \cdot 0.316 = 1.25\sqrt{2}\),
- \(I_i = 2.5\sqrt{5} \cdot 0.948 = 3.75\sqrt{2}\).

Thus, in rectangular form, \(I = 1.25\sqrt{2} + j3.75\sqrt{2} \, \text{A}\).

### Step 4: Match with the options
- **Option B**: Polar form \(2.5\sqrt{5} \angle 71.6^\circ\) and rectangular form \(1.25\sqrt{2} + j3.75\sqrt{2} \, \text{A}\) matches the calculations.
- Other options either have incorrect magnitudes, angles, or rectangular forms.

### Final Answer:
**B**
