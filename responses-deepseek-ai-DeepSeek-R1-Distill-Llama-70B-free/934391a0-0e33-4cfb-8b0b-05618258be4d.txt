Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about common law crimes, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario: A man is alone in his apartment late at night. Someone buzzes his apartment repeatedly, but he doesn't answer because he's tired. Then he hears the door being kicked in, and a man with a gun confronts him, waves the gun, and demands cash. The victim opens his safe and hands over the money. The perpetrator runs but is caught by the police soon after.

I need to determine which common law crimes the perpetrator has probably committed. The options are A through J, each listing different combinations of crimes.

First, I should recall the definitions of the relevant common law crimes. The main ones here are likely burglary, robbery, assault, and maybe others like trespassing or attempted murder.

Starting with burglary. At common law, burglary is defined as the unlawful entry into a dwelling of another at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony inside. So let's check the elements here. The perpetrator kicked in the apartment door, which is an unlawful entry. The apartment is a dwelling, and it's nighttime. The intent to commit a felony—probably robbery—when he entered. So yes, burglary fits.

Next, robbery. Common law robbery is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another from their person or presence, using force or fear, with the intent to permanently deprive. Here, the man used a gun to threaten the victim, which is fear of imminent harmful force. He took the money from the victim's presence (the safe in the apartment). So that's robbery.

Now, could there be other crimes? What about assault? Assault at common law is the intentional causing of another person to fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. When the perpetrator waved the gun and threatened, that's an assault. But robbery includes the element of force or fear, so the assault is part of the robbery. However, in some jurisdictions, the assault might be a separate charge, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, it might be considered as part of the robbery, so maybe it's not a separate crime in this context.

What about attempted murder? Attempted murder would require specific intent to kill. The facts don't indicate that the perpetrator intended to kill, just to get money. He waved the gun but didn't fire it or make any statement about killing. So I don't think attempted murder applies here.

Trespassing is another option. Trespassing to property is entering without permission. Burglary includes trespass as part of its elements, but in some cases, it might be charged separately. However, in this case, the more specific crime of burglary would apply, so trespassing as a separate charge might not be necessary.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Robbery and burglary. That seems to fit. The perpetrator committed both.

Option B: Adds attempted murder, which I don't think applies.

Option C: Includes burglary, robbery, and trespassing. As I thought, trespassing might be included in burglary, but maybe some jurisdictions treat them separately. But I'm not sure if trespassing is a common law crime here or more of a misdemeanor. Also, the question is about what the perpetrator has "probably" committed, so maybe it's just the two main ones.

Option D: Aggravated assault and robbery. Aggravated assault might involve the use of a weapon, but again, the assault is part of the robbery. So maybe the robbery charge includes the assault element, so it's not a separate crime. But I'm not certain if at common law it's considered a separate crime.

Option G: Robbery and attempted murder. As before, no attempted murder.

Option H: Robbery and assault. If assault is a separate charge, then this could be correct. But I think under common law, the force or fear used in robbery incorporates the assault, so maybe it's not a separate charge.

Wait, but some sources say that robbery includes the element of assault, so perhaps the defendant can't be charged for both robbery and assault. But other sources might say that the assault is a separate offense. I'm a bit confused on that point.

Alternatively, the act of waving the gun could constitute an assault separate from the robbery. So if the jurisdiction allows for both charges, then H might be possible. But I'm not sure if that's the case under common law.

Let me think again. Robbery requires the use of force or fear. So the act that constitutes the robbery (using the gun to threaten) is the same act that would be the assault. So in common law, could both apply, or does robbery subsume the assault?

I think robbery doesn't necessarily preclude an assault charge, but perhaps in this scenario, since the assault was used to commit the robbery, it's part of the same act. But I'm not entirely certain. Some jurisdictions might allow both, others might not.

Looking back at the options, the question is asking what the perpetrator has "probably" committed. So which options are more likely.

Option A: robbery and burglary. That seems solid.

Option C includes trespassing. But trespassing is a lesser included offense of burglary. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction allows for both robbery and assault, then H would be correct. But I'm leaning towards A because burglary and robbery are both clearly present, and the assault is part of the robbery.

Another angle: Did the perpetrator commit any other crimes? Let's see. He broke into the apartment (burglary), then used a gun to threaten (assault), then took the money (robbery). So maybe both burglary and robbery, but does the assault stand alone?

I think that at common law, a robbery necessarily includes an assault, so the perpetrator can be charged with both, but it's more likely that the primary charges are robbery and burglary. So the answer would be A.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Robbery and burglary.

Option H: Robbery and assault.

So which one is correct? If the answer expects both robbery and burglary, then A is correct. If the answer expects robbery and assault, then H is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer includes both robbery and burglary because those are the two main crimes here. The assault is part of the robbery, so maybe not a separate charge. Therefore, the answer is A.

But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of another approach. Let's consider each crime.

1. Burglary: Yes, because he broke into the dwelling at night with intent to commit a felony (robbery).

2. Robbery: Yes, because he used force (gun) to take property from the victim's presence.

3. Assault: Yes, because he caused the victim to fear harm by waving the gun.

But in common law, can he be convicted of both robbery and assault? Or is the assault merged into the robbery?

In common law, robbery is a specific intent crime that includes the use of force or fear, so the assault is a necessary element. Therefore, the assault is part of the robbery, and the defendant can be convicted of both, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Some jurisdictions might allow for both charges, while others might consider them to be the same offense.

If the answer options include both robbery and burglary, that's probably the intended answer. So the correct answer would be A: Robbery and burglary.

Wait, but another thought: burglary requires the intent to commit a felony at the time of entry. The perpetrator entered with the intent to get cash, which is larceny (a felony). So that's burglary. Then, once inside, he committed robbery by using force to take the money.

So yes, both burglary and robbery are present. The assault is part of the robbery, so it's included in that charge.

Therefore, the answer is A: Robbery and burglary.

The scenario involves a man who is at home when someone buzzes his apartment repeatedly. He ignores the buzzing but later hears his door being kicked in. A man with a gun confronts him, demands cash, and forces him to open his safe. The perpetrator takes the money and flees but is later apprehended by the police. The task is to determine which common law crimes the perpetrator has probably committed.

### Analysis of the Crimes:

1. **Burglary**:  
   At common law, burglary is defined as the unlawful entry into a dwelling of another at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony inside. Here, the perpetrator unlawfully entered the apartment (a dwelling) at night and had the intent to commit larceny (a felony). Therefore, the elements of burglary are satisfied.

2. **Robbery**:  
   Robbery at common law is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another from their person or presence, using force or fear, with the intent to permanently deprive. The perpetrator used a gun to threaten the victim, creating fear of imminent harm, and took money from the victim's presence. Thus, the elements of robbery are met.

3. **Assault**:  
   Assault at common law is the intentional causing of another person to fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. When the perpetrator waved the gun and threatened the victim, this could constitute an assault. However, the use of force or fear is a necessary element of robbery, and in many jurisdictions, the assault is subsumed within the robbery charge. Therefore, it is unlikely to be treated as a separate crime in this context.

4. **Attempted Murder**:  
   Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill. The facts do not indicate any intent to kill, as the perpetrator's goal was to obtain money. Thus, attempted murder does not apply.

5. **Trespassing**:  
   Trespassing involves unlawful entry onto another's property. However, burglary includes trespass as part of its elements, and trespassing is not typically charged separately when burglary is applicable.

### Evaluation of the Options:

- **Option A (Robbery and Burglary)**: Both crimes are clearly supported by the facts. Burglary occurred when the perpetrator unlawfully entered the apartment with intent to commit a felony, and robbery occurred when he used force to take the money. This option fits the scenario well.  
- **Option B (Robbery, Burglary, and Attempted Murder)**: Attempted murder is not supported by the facts, as there is no evidence of intent to kill.  
- **Option C (Burglary, Robbery, and Trespassing)**: Trespassing is subsumed under burglary and is not typically charged separately.  
- **Option D (Aggravated Assault and Robbery)**: While the use of a gun could constitute aggravated assault, the assault is part of the robbery charge. Additionally, the question focuses on common law crimes, and "aggravated assault" may not be a traditional common law category.  
- **Option E (Attempted Murder and Trespassing)**: Neither attempted murder nor trespassing (as a separate charge) is supported by the facts.  
- **Option F (Burglary and Attempted Murder)**: Attempted murder is not applicable.  
- **Option G (Robbery and Attempted Murder)**: Attempted murder is not applicable.  
- **Option H (Robbery and Assault)**: While the perpetrator's actions could constitute assault, the assault is part of the robbery charge. Thus, this option is less likely than Option A.  
- **Option I (Trespassing and Armed Robbery)**: Trespassing is subsumed under burglary, and "armed robbery" is not a traditional common law category.  

### Conclusion:  
The perpetrator has probably committed **robbery** and **burglary**, as these crimes are clearly supported by the facts and are the most appropriate charges under common law. Other options either include crimes not supported by the facts or fail to account for the merger of certain elements under common law.
