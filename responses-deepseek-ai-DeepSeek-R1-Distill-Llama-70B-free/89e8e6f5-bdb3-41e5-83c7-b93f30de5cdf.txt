Question:

What evidence is there that there are specialized sound detectorsfor human speech ?

Options:

A: Auditory complex neurons primarily respond to tactile stimulation instead of auditory signals.
B: Only a small minority of neurons in the auditory complex are dedicated to processing speech sounds.
C: 40% of the neurons in the auditory complex do not even respond to pure tones, but only to more complex sounds such as bursts of noise or clicks.
D: Neurons in the auditory complex are equally responsive to all sound frequencies.
E: Neurons in the auditory complex respond to changes in light intensity.
F: Neurons in the auditory complex have been found to respond exclusively to musical tones, not speech.
G: Auditory complex neurons show a heightened response to visual motion cues rather than sounds.
H: All neurons in the auditory complex respond only to pure tones.
I: Neurons in the auditory complex respond to simple, uniform sounds.
J: The majority of neurons in the auditory complex are specialized for detecting water sounds.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about evidence for specialized sound detectors for human speech. Let me think through this.

The question is asking for evidence that supports the idea that there are specialized neurons or detectors in the auditory system that are specifically tuned for human speech sounds. So, I need to look for an option that shows neurons responding more to speech or complex sounds rather than simple tones.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Auditory complex neurons primarily respond to tactile stimulation instead of auditory signals. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. The auditory complex is for hearing, so if they respond to tactile, that's unrelated. So probably not A.

Option B: Only a small minority of neurons are dedicated to processing speech sounds. Wait, if only a small minority, that doesn't seem like strong evidence for specialized detectors. It suggests the opposite, that most aren't into speech. So maybe not B.

Option C: 40% of neurons don't respond to pure tones but only to complex sounds like bursts of noise or clicks. Oh, that's interesting. Pure tones are simple sounds, like a single frequency. If a significant portion of neurons don't respond to them but do to more complex sounds, which speech is, that suggests specialization. So this looks like a possible answer.

Option D: Neurons respond equally to all frequencies. That would mean no specialization, so not supporting the idea. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Respond to light intensity. That's visual, unrelated to hearing, so E is out.

Option F: Respond exclusively to musical tones, not speech. That's the opposite of what we're looking for. So F isn't it.

Option G: Respond more to visual motion. Again, unrelated to sound, so G is incorrect.

Option H: All neurons respond only to pure tones. That would mean no response to complex sounds, which contradicts the idea of specialized detectors for speech. So H is wrong.

Option I: Respond to simple, uniform sounds. That would mean they're not specialized for complex speech. So I isn't the right choice.

Option J: Majority specialized for water sounds. That's specific, but the question is about speech. Unless water sounds are analogous, but I don't think that's the case. So J probably isn't correct.

So, the best option seems to be C. It says a significant number of neurons don't respond to pure tones but do to more complex sounds, which would include speech. This suggests that these neurons are specialized for detecting more intricate auditory signals, supporting the idea that there are detectors for human speech.

The evidence that supports the existence of specialized sound detectors for human speech is found in the response of neurons in the auditory complex. Specifically, 40% of these neurons do not respond to simple pure tones but instead respond to more complex sounds, such as bursts of noise or clicks. This indicates a specialization for detecting intricate auditory signals, which aligns with the complexity of human speech sounds.

Answer: C
