Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about existential neurosis and logotherapy. I'm a bit rusty on psychology terms, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that logotherapy is a type of therapy. I think it's related to finding meaning in life. The term "logos" in Greek means reason or word, but in this context, I believe it's more about meaning. So logotherapy probably focuses on helping people find their life's purpose or meaning.

Existential neurosis sounds like it's related to existentialism. Existentialist themes often deal with questions about life's meaning, freedom, and anxiety. So maybe existential neurosis is when someone feels anxious or distressed because they're grappling with these big life questionsâ€”like feeling a lack of direction or meaninglessness.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Thrill of extreme sports. That doesn't sound right. Neurosis is more about anxiety or distress, not a positive thrill.

Option B: Extreme happiness. No, neurosis implies some kind of psychological issue, so this is the opposite.

Option C: Physical health. Doesn't fit logotherapy, which I think is more psychological.

Option D: Dream interpretation. That's Freudian psychoanalysis, not logotherapy.

Option E: Physical ailment. No, neurosis is a psychological term.

Option F: Heightened senses and creativity. Not sure, but neurosis usually relates to distress, not heightened creativity.

Option G: Group therapy. I thought logotherapy was more individual, focusing on personal meaning.

Option H: Existential neurosis as a contemporary disorder with symptoms like meaninglessness, etc. Logotherapy helps find purpose. This sounds right because it aligns with what I remember about Viktor Frankl, who developed logotherapy. He talked about the search for meaning as a primary human drive, and issues arising from its absence.

Option I: Excessive euphoria. No, that's not neurosis, which is more about anxiety or distress.

Option J: Diet for cognitive function. No connection to logotherapy.

So the correct answer should be H. It correctly describes both concepts.

The correct answer is H because it accurately describes existential neurosis as a condition characterized by feelings of meaninglessness, loneliness, and lack of direction, and logotherapy as a therapeutic approach aimed at helping individuals find purpose and meaning in life.
