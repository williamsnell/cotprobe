I: extinction
J: operant conditioning

Okay, so I've got this question about classical conditioning, right? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is about Ivan Pavlov's experiments with dogs. I remember that Pavlov worked with dogs and bells, associating the bell ring with food to make them salivate. But this scenario is a bit different. It says that later on, the dogs started salivating when they heard any sound similar to a bell, like a doorbell or someone clinking a glass. So, they're reacting to sounds that are kind of like the original bell sound.

Wait, what's that called again? I think it's something about how the response generalizes to similar stimuli. Oh right, generalization! That's when a conditioned response occurs not just to the original stimulus but to similar ones too. Like, if you get scared of a dog because it bit you, you might fear all dogs, not just that specific one. So in this case, the dogs are generalizing the bell sound to any similar noise.

Let me go through the options. Option B is generalization. That sounds right. What about the other options? Acquisition is the initial learning phase, right? So when the dogs first learned to salivate at the bell. But this scenario is about after that, so not acquisition. Discrimination is when they can tell the difference between similar stimuli, so that's not it because the dogs are responding to more sounds, not fewer. Extinction is when the response goes away because the stimulus isn't paired with the unconditioned stimulus anymore. Not happening here because the response is still there and even spreading. Negative reinforcement is part of operant conditioning, not classical. So I can eliminate that. Counter conditioning is when you associate a stimulus with a different response, maybe to reduce fear. Not applicable here. Trace conditioning involves a delay between stimuli, I think. Stimulus control is more about the antecedent in operant conditioning. Spontaneous recovery is when a response returns after extinction. So that's not it either. Operant conditioning is a different type altogether, so J is out.

So, putting it all together, the correct term is generalization, which is option B.

The scenario describes Ivan Pavlov's dogs salivating in response to sounds similar to a bell, such as a doorbell or clinking glass. This behavior illustrates **generalization**, a classical conditioning term where a conditioned response is elicited by stimuli similar to the original conditioned stimulus. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A (negative reinforcement)**: Part of operant conditioning, not relevant here.
- **B (generalization)**: Correct, as the dogs respond to similar stimuli.
- **C (acquisition)**: Refers to the initial learning phase, not this scenario.
- **D (discrimination)**: Involves distinguishing between stimuli, the opposite of what's happening.
- **E (counter conditioning)**: Involves associating a stimulus with a new response, not applicable.
- **F (trace conditioning)**: Relates to delayed stimulus-response pairing, irrelevant here.
- **G (spontaneous recovery)**: Refers to the return of an extinguished response, not relevant.
- **H (stimulus control)**: Part of operant conditioning, not classical.
- **I (extinction)**: Involves the disappearance of a response, not the case here.
- **J (operant conditioning)**: A different type of conditioning altogether.

The correct answer is **B: generalization**.

B
