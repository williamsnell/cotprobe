Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric dipole in an electric field. Hmm, I remember that electric dipoles have something to do with two charges separated by a distance. Right, the dipole moment is p equals q times d, where d is the separation vector.

The problem gives the dipole moment vector as (3.00 i + 4.00 j) multiplied by 1.24e-30 C·m. And the electric field is given as 4000 N/C in the i direction. So E is along the x-axis.

Wait, what's being asked here? Oh right, two things: the potential energy of the dipole and the torque acting on it. But looking at the options, it seems like the question is focusing on just one of them, probably the potential energy since the options are all in joules.

I think the formula for the potential energy U of a dipole in an electric field is U equals negative p dot E. Oh wait, right, because the potential energy is the dot product of the dipole moment and the electric field, with a negative sign. So U = -p · E.

So first I need to compute the dot product of the vectors p and E. Let's see. The dipole moment vector p is (3.00 i +4.00 j) times 1.24e-30. The electric field E is 4000 i N/C. 

Dot product is (3)(4000) + (4)(0) because E has only the i component. So 3*4000 = 12000. Multiply that by 1.24e-30. Oh wait, that's without considering the negative sign yet.

Wait, no. Wait, the dipole moment p is the vector (3i +4j) multiplied by 1.24e-30. So the components are:

p_x = 3 * 1.24e-30 = 3.72e-30 C·m
p_y =4 * 1.24e-30=4.96e-30 C·m
p_z =0.

E is 4000 i, so E_x=4000, E_y=0, E_z=0.

Dot product p · E is (3.72e-30)(4000) + (4.96e-30)(0) +0 = 3.72e-30 *4e3.

Wait, 3.72e-30 times 4000 is 3.72 *4 =14.88, and 1e-30 *1e3 is 1e-27. So 14.88e-27 C·m·N/C. Because N/C * C·m = N·m which is joules.

Wait, but the formula is U= - p · E. So U will be negative of that.

So 14.88e-27 J. Let's compute that as 1.488e-26 J. But with a negative sign, so U is -1.488e-26 J.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E is -1.79e-26, which is larger in magnitude. Option B is -1.99e-26, which is even larger. Hmm, wait, did I make a calculation mistake?

Wait, let me recalculate. 3.00 *4000 =12,000. Multiply by 1.24e-30.

Wait, 3 *4000 =12,000. Then 12,000 *1.24e-30 = 14,880e-30 = 1.488e-26 J. So U is -1.488e-26 J.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match 1.488e-26. Let's check the options again.

The options are:

A: -1.69e-26

B: -1.99e-26

C: -1.59e-26

D: -1.39e-26

E: -1.79e-26

F: -1.09e-26

G: -1.29e-26

H: -1.49e-26

I: -1.19e-26

J: -2.09e-26.

Hmm, none of these exactly match 1.488e-26. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 3 *4000 is 12,000. 12,000 *1.24e-30.

Wait, 12,000 is 1.2e4. So 1.2e4 *1.24e-30 = (1.2 *1.24) *1e-26.

1.2 *1.24 is 1.488, so yes, 1.488e-26. So the potential energy is -1.488e-26 J.

Looking again at the options, the closest is option H: -1.49e-26 J. Oh wait, 1.488 is approximately 1.49 when rounded to three significant figures.

Wait, 1.488 is 1.49 when rounded to three decimal places? Let's see. 1.488 is 1.49 when rounded to the nearest hundredth, because the third decimal is 8, which is >=5, so it rounds up. So 1.488 becomes 1.49.

So the correct answer would be H: -1.49e-26 J.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3*4000.

Wait, 3 *4000 is 12,000. Then 12,000 multiplied by 1.24e-30.

Wait, 12,000 * 1.24e-30 = (12,000 *1.24) *1e-30.

12,000 *1.24: Let's compute that.

12,000 = 1.2e4.

1.2e4 *1.24 = 1.488e4.

So 1.488e4 *1e-30 = 1.488e-26 J.

So yes, that's correct. So U = -1.488e-26 J, which rounds to -1.49e-26 J. So option H is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing—wait, the dipole moment was given as (3.00 i +4.00 j) *1.24e-30 C·m, right? So when I take the dot product with E, which is along i, only the i component matters. So p_i is 3.00 *1.24e-30.

So p · E = (3.00 *1.24e-30) *4000.

3.00 *4000 is 12,000. 12,000 *1.24e-30 = 1.488e-26.

Yes, that's correct. So the potential energy is -1.488e-26 J, which is approximately -1.49e-26 J. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the potential energy of the electric dipole, we use the formula:

\[
U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}
\]

The dipole moment is given as:

\[
\vec{p} = (3.00 \hat{i} + 4.00 \hat{j}) \cdot (1.24 \times 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m})
\]

The electric field is:

\[
\vec{E} = 4000 \, \hat{i} \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

The dot product \(\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E}\) is calculated as:

\[
\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} = (3.00 \cdot 1.24 \times 10^{-30}) \cdot 4000 + (4.00 \cdot 1.24 \times 10^{-30}) \cdot 0
\]

Since the electric field has only an \(x\)-component, the \(y\)-component of \(\vec{p}\) does not contribute. Thus:

\[
\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} = 3.00 \cdot 1.24 \times 10^{-30} \cdot 4000
\]

First, calculate \(3.00 \cdot 4000 = 12,000\). Then:

\[
\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} = 12,000 \cdot 1.24 \times 10^{-30} = 1.488 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

The potential energy is:

\[
U = -\vec{p} \cdot \vec{E} = -1.488 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Rounding to three significant figures, \(U = -1.49 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J}\).

From the given options, the closest match is:

**H: \(-1.49 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J}\)**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H**
