Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about coping strategies, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: "Which of the following relies on internal resources to cope with a problem?" The options are A through J, each representing different psychological concepts. Hmm, I remember that coping mechanisms can be categorized in different ways, like problem-focused versus emotion-focused.

Wait, problem-focused coping is when someone tries to tackle the problem directly. They might change their behavior or take action to solve it. That would be external because it's about changing the situation.

Then there's emotion-focused coping, which deals with managing the emotional response rather than the problem itself. So this would involve internal resources, like changing how you think about the problem or using cognitive techniques to reduce stress.

Looking at the options, option A is Emotion-focused coping. That makes sense because it's about internal handling of emotions. Option C is Problem-focused, which is external. So the question is about internal resources, so A should be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Other options like cognitive restructuring (J) or appraisal-focused coping (H) might also be internal. But the main two categories are problem and emotion-focused. The question asks which relies on internal resources, so emotion-focused is the correct choice here.

The correct answer is A: Emotion-focused coping. This strategy involves managing emotions internally rather than addressing the problem directly, which aligns with using internal resources.
