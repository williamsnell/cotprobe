Okay, so I've got this problem about heat loss from a duct, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The duct is a long circular one with an outside diameter of 8 inches. The surface temperature is 115°F, and the ambient air is at 65°F. I need to find the rate of heat loss per foot when the duct is placed horizontally.

Hmm, I remember that heat loss from a cylinder to surrounding air can be calculated using certain formulas, probably involving convection. Oh right, Newton's Law of Cooling comes into play here, but I think the overall approach involves convection coefficients and such.

Wait, the formula for heat transfer by convection is Q = h*A*ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference. But wait, that's for flat plates, right? For a cylinder, the calculation is a bit different. Oh right, the area would be the lateral surface area of the cylinder, which is 2πrL, where r is radius and L is length.

But wait, the duct is placed horizontally. So maybe the orientation affects the convective heat transfer coefficient. I think that for horizontal cylinders, the heat transfer coefficient is calculated differently than for vertical ones. Oh right, the formula for h depends on whether it's vertical or horizontal.

I recall that the heat transfer coefficient for natural convection around a horizontal cylinder can be found using the formula with Grashof and Prandtl numbers. The Grashof number (Gr) is (gβΔT D^3)/ν², where β is the volume expansion coefficient, g is acceleration due to gravity, ΔT is the temp difference, D is diameter, and ν is kinematic viscosity.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula for h in this context. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach using standard heat loss equations for pipes.

I think the standard heat loss equation for a pipe is Q = 0.5 * π * D * L * (T_s - T_a) * (h), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I remember that for horizontal cylinders, the formula for the convective heat transfer coefficient might involve the Grashof and Prandtl numbers in a correlation like h = (k / D) * Nu, where Nu is the Nusselt number. For natural convection around horizontal cylinders, I think the Nusselt number can be approximated using Churchill and Chu's equation or something similar.

Wait, but maybe I can find a simpler approach. I remember that for heating or cooling loads, sometimes people use the heat loss equations from the ASHRAE handbook or similar resources, which have standard coefficients based on the pipe's diameter and temperature difference.

Alternatively, there's a formula for heat loss per linear foot of pipe which factors in the temperature difference and the diameter. I think it's something like Q = 0.5 * π * (T_s - T_a) * (D)^0.75, but I'm not sure about the exact factors. Wait, no, that might be for radiation or combined convection and radiation, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we're only considering convection here.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention radiation, so I think it's only about convection. So I should focus on calculating the convective heat loss.

Let me think about the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the temperature difference, ΔT = T_s - T_a = 115°F - 65°F = 50°F. But wait, in SI units, temperature differences in °F and °C are the same in magnitude when converted to Kelvin or Rankine. So I can use 50°F difference as 50 R.

2. Find the convective heat transfer coefficient, h, for natural convection around a horizontal cylinder. For that, I need the properties of air at the film temperature, which is the average of the surface and ambient temperatures. So film temp, T_film = (115 + 65)/2 = 90°F. I need to convert this to absolute temperature for properties. 90°F is 90 + 459.67 = 549.67 R.

3. At T_film, find the properties of air: density (ρ), specific heat (c_p), thermal conductivity (k), kinematic viscosity (ν), and Prandtl number (Pr).

I might need to refer to a table for these properties. Let me recall approximate values. Wait, I think at around 80°F to 100°F (like 300-350 K), the properties of air are roughly:

- ρ ≈ 0.076 lbm/ft³ (but wait, I think at 70°F, it's about 0.0749; at 100°F, it's about 0.0719 lbm/ft³). Wait, film temp is 90°F, so maybe around 0.072 lbm/ft³.

- ν (kinematic viscosity) at 90°F. At 70°F, ν is about 0.000016 ft²/s, and at 100°F, it's about 0.0000178 ft²/s. So maybe approximately 0.000017 ft²/s.

- Thermal conductivity, k, of air at 90°F is about 0.015 BTU·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, I think it's around 0.0145 to 0.0155 in that range.

- Specific heat, c_p, is about 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F.

- Prandtl number, Pr, for air is approximately 0.7, and it doesn't vary much with temperature.

Wait, but maybe I should be precise here. Let me try to get accurate values.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the units. Let me make sure I get the right units for each property.

Given that, let's proceed step by step.

First, we have D = 8 inches, which is 8/12 = 0.6667 feet.

Film temperature T_film = 90°F = 549.67 R.

Now, air properties at T_film:

- Density, ρ: At 549.67 R, which is about 90°F, the density of air at atmospheric pressure can be found using the ideal gas law. The density of dry air at 70°F (21°C) is about 0.0749 lbm/ft³. At higher temperatures, air is less dense. The density decreases with increasing temperature.

The ideal gas law is ρ = (P*M)/(R*T), where P is pressure (atmospheric, 14.7 psia), M is molecular weight (28.97 lbm/lbmol), R is the gas constant (1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R)).

Wait, but maybe I can use a more straightforward approach. Alternatively, I can approximate using known values.

At 60°F, ρ_air ≈ 0.0765 lbm/ft³.

At 90°F, let's say it's about 0.072 lbm/ft³. I think that's a reasonable approximation.

Kinematic viscosity, ν: At 90°F, I think ν_air is about 0.000017 ft²/s. I've read somewhere that at 70°F, it's around 0.000016 ft²/s, so with increasing temperature, it increases a bit.

Thermal conductivity, k: For air at around 90°F, k is approximately 0.015 BTU·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹. Let me confirm; yes, around that value.

Specific heat, c_p: For air, it's about 0.24 BTU/(lbm·°F).

Prandtl number, Pr: For air, it's approximately 0.7, as I thought earlier.

Now, the Grashof number, Gr, is given by:

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * D³) / ν²

But wait, β is the volume expansion coefficient, also known as the coefficient of thermal expansion. For air, β is approximately 1/T, where T is the absolute temperature in Rankine. So, β = 1 / T_film.

Wait, yes: β (volume expansion coefficient) for air is 1 / T, where T is in absolute units (Rankine here). So β = 1 / 549.67 ≈ 0.001819 R⁻¹.

So, substituting into Gr:

g is 32.174 ft/s².

ΔT is 50°F, which is 50 R.

D is 0.6667 ft.

So Gr = (32.174) * (0.001819) * (50) * (0.6667)^3 / (0.000017)^2

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate numerator step:

32.174 * 0.001819 ≈ 0.0585.

0.0585 * 50 = 2.925.

(0.6667)^3 ≈ 0.6667 * 0.6667 = 0.4444, then *0.6667 ≈ 0.2963.

So numerator: 2.925 * 0.2963 ≈ 0.866.

Denominator: (0.000017)^2 = 0.000000000289.

So Gr ≈ 0.866 / 0.000000000289 ≈ 3.0e9? Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, 0.000017 is 1.7e-5, so (1.7e-5)^2 = 2.89e-10.

So Gr = (32.174) * (0.001819) * (50) * (0.6667)^3 / (2.89e-10).

Let me calculate each part:

32.174 * 0.001819 = approx 0.0585.

0.0585 * 50 = 2.925.

(0.6667)^3 = approx 0.2963.

So 2.925 * 0.2963 ≈ 0.866.

Now, 0.866 / 2.89e-10 ≈ 0.866 / 2.89e-10 ≈ 2.997e9, so Gr ≈ 3e9.

Now, the Prandtl number, Pr = 0.7.

So, the product Gr * Pr = 3e9 * 0.7 = 2.1e9.

Now, for natural convection around a horizontal cylinder, the Nusselt number can be calculated using an appropriate correlation. One common correlation for a horizontal cylinder is:

Nu = 0.36 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/5) for (Gr * Pr) < 1e8,

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard of the Churchill and Chu correlation, which covers a wider range.

The Churchill and Chu correlation for natural convection around a horizontal cylinder is:

Nu = ( (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) ) * [1 + (0.494/Pr)^(9/16) ]^(-4/9) )  for Pr ≥ 0.01 and Gr * Pr ≥ 5e8.

Wait, but if Gr * Pr is 2.1e9, which is greater than 1e8, so Churchill's equation would apply.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the following correlation for a horizontal cylinder:

Nu = 0.75 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) * (1 + (0.5/Pr)^(9/16)) )^(-4/9)

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the standard correlation for a horizontal cylinder is:

Nu = C * (Gr * Pr)^(m) * (1 + (0.5/Pr)^(9/16)) )^(-4/9)

Where C and m depend on the range of Gr * Pr. Alternatively, perhaps the more straightforward approach is to use:

For 1e-5 < Gr * Pr < 1e9, the Nusselt number can be approximated by:

Nu = 0.36 + 0.56 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/5)

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for a horizontal cylinder is:

Nu = 0.35 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/5) * (1 + (Pr/0.5)^(2/3)) )^(1/4) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should refer to a standard formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate value. Alternatively, given the time constraints, perhaps I can use an approximate value of h based on some standard charts.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula for heat loss per foot of pipe, which might be a standard formula given the temperature difference and the diameter. I think the formula is:

Q = 0.5 * π * D * (T_s - T_a) * h

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that for a horizontal cylinder, the heat loss per foot can be calculated using a specific formula involving the diameter and temperature difference. Wait, perhaps I can use the following approach.

In some references, the heat loss from a pipe can be calculated using the formula:

Q = (π * D * L) * (T_s - T_a) * h

But to find h, we need to compute it via the convection correlations.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find h first.

We have Gr * Pr = 2.1e9.

Using the Churchill and Chu correlation:

Nu = (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) * [1 + (0.494/Pr)^(9/16)]^(-4/9)

Plugging in the numbers:

Gr * Pr = 2.1e9

(Nu) = (2.1e9)^(1/4) * [1 + (0.494 / 0.7)^(9/16)]^(-4/9)

Compute each part.

First, (2.1e9)^(1/4):

2.1e9 is 2,100,000,000.

Take the square root twice.

Square root of 2.1e9 is approx 45870.

Square root of 45870 is approx 214.2.

So, (2.1e9)^(1/4) ≈ 214.2.

Next, compute (0.494/0.7) = approx 0.706.

Now, 0.706^(9/16):

Let me compute 9/16 ≈ 0.5625.

Take natural log: ln(0.706) ≈ -0.342.

Multiply by 0.5625: -0.342 * 0.5625 ≈ -0.1924.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.1924) ≈ 0.825.

So, (0.494/Pr)^(9/16) ≈ 0.825.

Thus, [1 + 0.825] = 1.825.

Now, [1.825]^(-4/9):

Take natural log: ln(1.825) ≈ 0.602.

Multiply by (-4/9): 0.602 * (-0.444) ≈ -0.267.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.267) ≈ 0.766.

So, the second term is approximately 0.766.

Putting it all together:

Nu ≈ 214.2 * 0.766 ≈ 164.2.

Now, Nu = h*D/k → h = Nu * k / D.

We have k ≈ 0.015 BTU·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹.

D is 0.6667 ft.

So, h = (164.2) * (0.015) / (0.6667) ≈ ?

Compute numerator: 164.2 * 0.015 ≈ 2.463.

Denominator: 0.6667.

So, h ≈ 2.463 / 0.6667 ≈ 3.696 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, the surface area of the duct per foot is the circumference times length.

Wait, the surface area for a cylinder per foot length is 2πr*L. Since r is D/2, it's 2π*(D/2)*L = π*D*L.

Wait, for a cylinder of length L, the lateral surface area is 2πrL = π D L.

So, per foot, it's π D * 1 ft.

So, A = π * D * L, where L is 1 foot.

So, A = π * 0.6667 ft ≈ 2.094 ft².

Now, the heat loss Q = h * A * ΔT.

h is 3.696, A is 2.094, ΔT is 50°F.

So, Q = 3.696 * 2.094 * 50.

Compute 3.696 * 2.094 first.

3.696 * 2 = 7.392.

3.696 * 0.094 = approx 0.347.

Total: 7.392 + 0.347 ≈ 7.739.

Now, 7.739 * 50 = 386.95 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the options. The options are all around 70-110. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are much lower. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps my calculation of the Grashof number is incorrect. Let me double-check.

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * D^3) / ν^2.

g = 32.174 ft/s².

β = 1 / T_film, which is 1 / 549.67 ≈ 0.001819 R⁻¹.

ΔT = 50 R.

D = 0.6667 ft.

ν = 0.000017 ft²/s.

So, Gr = (32.174) * (0.001819) * (50) * (0.6667)^3 / (0.000017)^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute numerator:

32.174 * 0.001819 = 0.0585.

0.0585 * 50 = 2.925.

(0.6667)^3 = approx 0.2963.

Multiply all together: 2.925 * 0.2963 ≈ 0.866.

Denominator: (0.000017)^2 = 2.89e-10.

So, Gr = 0.866 / 2.89e-10 ≈ 3e9.

Wait, that
