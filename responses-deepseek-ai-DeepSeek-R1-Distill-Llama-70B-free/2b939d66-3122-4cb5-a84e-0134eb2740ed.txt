Okay, so I have this medical question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a 77-year-old woman who had a syncopal event while walking. So, syncope is fainting, right? She presented to the office for evaluation. Her cardiac exam shows a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, best heard at the right upper sternal border. The murmur radiates into the neck. They're asking which valvular abnormality most likely caused this episode.

Hmm, I remember that murmurs are sounds caused by turbulent blood flow across heart valves. Systolic murmurs occur during systole, when the heart is contracting. The grading is from 1 to 6, so 3 is moderately loud. Location is important too. Right upper sternal border—so that's the area near the aorta, I think.

Radiation into the neck makes me think of the aortic valve because the aorta is near the neck. When a murmur radiates there, it's often related to aortic valve issues. So maybe aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency?

Wait, aortic stenosis is when the valve doesn't open properly, causing an obstruction. It leads to a systolic ejection murmur, which is a harsh sound. Aortic insufficiency is when the valve doesn't close properly, allowing regurgitation. That usually causes a diastolic murmur, though—like a blowing sound after the second heart sound.

Let me think about the timing. Since the murmur is systolic, it's during contraction. So aortic stenosis is a possibility. Aortic stenosis can cause chest pain, syncope, and heart failure. The symptoms here are syncope, which fits.

The patient is 77, so a bicuspid aortic valve might have led to stenosis over time, but I'm not sure if that's the direct answer here. The question is about the valvular abnormality causing the episode, so it's more about the condition rather than the cause.

Another thought: mitral valve issues. Mitral stenosis is a diastolic murmur, so that's probably not it. Mitral regurgitation is systolic, but the murmur is best heard at the apex, not the upper sternal border. So that makes me think it's more likely aortic.

So, putting it together: systolic murmur at right upper sternal border, radiating to neck—sounds like aortic stenosis. The symptoms like syncope are classic for severe aortic stenosis. When the valve is severely narrowed, it can cause a drop in blood pressure during exertion, leading to fainting.

Looking at the options:

A: Bicuspid aortic valve—could be a cause, but the abnormality here is the stenosis.

B: Aortic insufficiency—no, because that's diastolic.

C: Mitral valve prolapse—usually a click and a late systolic murmur, heard at the apex. Doesn't fit here.

D: Tricuspid stenosis—diastolic and heard at lower left sternal border, I think.

E: Mitral regurgitation—systolic but apex, not neck.

F: Pulmonary regurgitation—unlikely, as murmurs here are usually at left upper sternal border.

G: Aortic stenosis—fits everything.

H: Pulmonary stenosis—systolic but heard at left upper sternal border.

I: Tricuspid regurgitation—usually heard at lower left, and may have jugular venous distension.

J: Mitral stenosis—diastolic.

So the answer should be G: aortic stenosis.

The patient is a 77-year-old female who experienced a syncopal event while walking. Cardiac examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, best heard at the right upper sternal border, with radiation into the neck. Systolic murmurs occur during contraction, and the location and radiation suggest involvement of the aortic valve. Aortic stenosis is characterized by a harsh systolic ejection murmur, often heard at the right upper sternal border and radiating to the neck. It can cause syncope due to severe narrowing of the valve, leading to a drop in blood pressure during exertion. Other options like aortic insufficiency (diastolic murmur), mitral regurgitation (apical murmur), and tricuspid or pulmonary valve issues do not fit the clinical findings. Therefore, the most likely valvular abnormality is aortic stenosis.

Answer: G
