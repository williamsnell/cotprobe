Okay, so I've got this question about inflation and its major costs. Hmm, I remember that inflation has several negative effects on the economy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

The question asks which option is NOT a major cost of inflation. The options are A to D. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Resources will be misallocated. I think inflation can cause people to make spending decisions based on rising prices, which might not align with the real value of goods. So, maybe it leads to misallocation because people might invest in things that just keep up with inflation rather than productive investments. That sounds like a cost, so A is probably a major cost.

Option B: Wealth will be redistributed. Inflation can redistribute wealth because people with fixed incomes, like those living on savings or pensions, might see their purchasing power decrease. On the other hand, borrowers might benefit because they pay back loans with cheaper money. So yes, B is a cost because it changes who has wealth, which isn't great for everyone.

Option C: Savings will be discouraged. Inflation erodes the value of savings over time. If money is losing value, people might spend now rather than save, which can reduce the savings rate. Lower savings can mean less investment in the economy. So C is definitely a major cost.

Option D: Real incomes will fall. Wait, real income is income adjusted for inflation. If inflation is high, real incomes do fall because the same amount of money buys fewer goods. But wait, isn't that only if nominal income doesn't keep up? Or does inflation itself cause real incomes to drop regardless? I'm a bit confused here. 

Wait, during inflation, if everyone's income increases proportionally, real income might stay the same. But in reality, not everyone's income keeps up with inflation. Some people, especially those on fixed incomes, see their real incomes fall. So D could be a cost. But I'm not certain if this is a direct major cost or more of a side effect for certain groups.

Wait, another angle: the major costs of inflation usually include things like uncertainty leading to misallocation, discouraging savings, and redistributing wealth. The falling real incomes—I think that's more of a symptom that happens to some people but isn't the primary cost. Or maybe real incomes don't necessarily fall for everyone. If inflation is anticipated, people might adjust their expectations, so real incomes might not fall as much. Or perhaps it's more about the redistribution than the average income. 

So maybe D isn't considered a major cost because it's not universally applicable. Or perhaps it's the opposite—maybe real incomes don't fall because people's nominal incomes rise with inflation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another thought: the real income refers to the purchasing power. If prices go up by 10% and your income goes up by 5%, your real income falls. But if your income keeps up with inflation, it doesn't. So whether real incomes fall depends on individual circumstances. Therefore, as a general major cost, maybe D isn't a given. The other options (A, B, C) are more about structural issues, while D is more situational.

So the question is, which is NOT a major cost. If D is not a universal major cost, but more a possible outcome for some, then D would be the correct answer.

The question asks which option is NOT a major cost of inflation. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Inflation can lead to misallocation of resources as rising prices may cause individuals and businesses to make decisions based on nominal price changes rather than real values, potentially leading to inefficient investments. This is a major cost of inflation.

- **Option B**: Inflation redistributes wealth, as it benefits borrowers (who repay loans with cheaper money) at the expense of savers and those with fixed incomes (who see their purchasing power decline). This is also a major cost.

- **Option C**: Inflation discourages savings because the erosion of the real value of money over time reduces the incentive to save. Lower savings can lead to reduced investment in the economy, making this a major cost.

- **Option D**: While inflation can cause real incomes to fall for certain groups (e.g., those with fixed incomes), it is not a universal or direct major cost of inflation. Real incomes may remain stable or even rise if nominal incomes keep pace with inflation. Thus, this is more of a situational outcome rather than a primary cost.

Based on this analysis, **Option D** is NOT considered a major cost of inflation compared to the other options.

Answer: D
