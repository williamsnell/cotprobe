Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about chemical equilibrium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem is about the reaction H2(g) + I2(g) ⇌ 2HI(g). The given Kp at 25°C is 870. Wait, Kp is the equilibrium constant using partial pressures, right? But sometimes when the problem gives concentrations, we use Kc. Oh wait, but in this case, the problem might be assuming all are gases, so perhaps Kp is given, but maybe the solution uses Kc because the initial data is in moles, not pressures. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. But I'll proceed and see.

Part (a) asks for the moles of HI formed when H2 and I2 are each 0.5 moles. Part (b) is about I2 formed when H2 is 0.5 and HI is 1.5. So, let's tackle part (a) first.

I think I should set up an ICE table for each part. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. 

Starting with part (a):
Initial moles:
H2: 0.5
I2: 0.5
HI: 0 (assuming it starts with none, but wait, no, the problem says when H2 and I2 are 0.5, so initial HI is zero. Or wait, the problem says "HI formed when H2=0.5 and I2=0.5", so maybe we're starting from H2 and I2 only. So yes, initial HI is zero.

Change will be: as the reaction proceeds, H2 and I2 decrease, HI increases. Let's let x be the change. For every mole of H2 consumed, 2 moles of HI are produced.

Wait, the reaction is 1 H2 + 1 I2 → 2 HI. So the stoichiometry is 1:1:2. 

So, initial:
H2: 0.5
I2: 0.5
HI: 0

Change:
H2: -x
I2: -x
HI: +2x

At equilibrium:
H2: 0.5 - x
I2: 0.5 - x
HI: 2x

Now, we can write the expression for Kc. Wait, Kp is given as 870, but Kp and Kc are related by the equation Kp = Kc(RT)^(Δn), where Δn is the change in moles of gas. In this reaction, Δn is 2 - (1+1) = 0. So Kp = Kc. Oh wait, because Kp is in terms of pressure, and Kc is in terms of concentration (moles/volume). But if Δn is zero, then Kp = Kc. But wait, no, because the units are different. Wait, perhaps in this problem, since Kp is given, but we're dealing with moles, we're to assume that the volume is 1L or something? Hmm, maybe they are considering concentrations as moles per liter, so Kc would be the same as Kp in that case, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is in a container where the volume cancels out, so Kp and Kc are numerically the same for this reaction. Because Δn is zero, Kp = Kc*(RT)^(0) = Kc*1, so Kp = Kc. So, Kc is also 870.

So, the expression is Kc = [HI]^2 / ([H2][I2]) = 870.

Plugging in the equilibrium concentrations:

[HI] = 2x
[H2] = 0.5 - x
[I2] = 0.5 - x

So,

( (2x)^2 ) / ( (0.5 - x)^2 ) = 870

Simplify numerator: 4x²

Denominator: (0.5 -x)^2

So,

4x² / (0.5 - x)^2 = 870

Hmm, that's a big K, so the reaction favors products. So x should be as large as possible. Let me check if 0.5 -x is positive. Since 0.5 is the initial amount, x can't exceed 0.5, because then H2 or I2 would go negative, which isn't possible. So x will be less than 0.5.

Wait, but K is 870, which is a large value, so the denominator must be very small, which implies that 0.5 -x is very small. So x approaches 0.5, but let's compute it.

Let me write the equation as:

4x² = 870*(0.5 -x)^2

Take square roots on both sides? Maybe, but let's expand the right side.

4x² = 870*(0.25 - x + x²)

Wait, no: (0.5 -x)^2 = 0.25 - x*1 + x².

So,

4x² = 870*(0.25 - x + x²)

Expand right side:

870*0.25 = 217.5
870*(-x) = -870x
870*x² = 870x²

So,

4x² = 217.5 -870x +870x²

Bring all terms to one side:

4x² -870x² +870x -217.5 = 0

Combine like terms:

(4 -870)x² +870x -217.5 = 0
-866x² +870x -217.5 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

866x² -870x +217.5 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's use the quadratic formula:

x = [870 ± sqrt(870^2 -4*866*217.5)] / (2*866)

Compute discriminant D:

D = (870)^2 -4*866*217.5

Calculate 870^2: 756900

Compute 4*866*217.5:

First compute 4 *866 = 3464

Then 3464 * 217.5: Hmm, 3464 * 200 = 692800, 3464*17.5 = let's compute 3464 *17=58888, and 3464 *0.5=1732, so total 58888+1732=60620. So total 692800 +60620=753420.

So D = 756900 -753420 = 3480.

sqrt(3480) ≈ 59.0 (since 59^2=3481, very close).

So,

x = [870 ±59]/(2*866)

Compute both possibilities.

First, x = (870 +59)/(2*866) = 929/(1732) ≈ 0.536.

But wait, initial H2 and I2 are 0.5 each. So x can't be 0.536 because 0.5 -x would be negative, which isn't possible. So we take the other root.

x = (870 -59)/(2*866) = 811/(1732) ≈ 0.468.

So x ≈ 0.468. Let's check if 0.5 - x is positive: 0.5 -0.468 = 0.032, which is positive. So that's acceptable.

So, moles of HI formed are 2x = 2 * 0.468 = 0.936 moles.

Wait, but the options are given for (a) and (b). Let me check the options. Option B says (a) 0.936 moles HI, (b) 0.010 I2. Hmm, but part (a) seems to be answered here, but wait, the question in part (a) is only about the moles of HI formed, which would be 0.936. So part (a)'s answer is 0.936.

Wait, but looking at the options, each option gives the result for both (a) and (b). For example, option A: 1.000 moles HI, 0 moles I2. So I think each option is providing both (a) and (b) answers.

Hmm, but I'm only done with part (a). Let me see what the options are for part (a).

Looking back, the options are:

A: 1.000 HI, 0 I2

B: 0.936 HI, 0.010 I2

C:0.750 HI, 0.125 I2

D:0.468 HI, 0.010 I2

E:0.500 HI, 0.200 I2

F:0.936 HI, 0.005 I2

G:0.800 HI, 0.100 I2

H:0.700 HI, 0.150 I2

I:0.468 HI, 0.005 I2

J:0.250 HI, 0.250 I2

Wait, the question is a two-part question. So the options are giving the answers for both parts. For example, option A is for part (a) 1.000 moles HI, and part (b) 0 moles I2. But that would imply for part (a), the HI is 1.000, but my calculation gave 0.936, so option B or F would be possible for part (a). Wait, option B says 0.936 moles HI for part (a) and 0.010 moles I2 for part (b), but let's see.

Wait, but I've only solved part (a) so far. So for part (a), the answer is 0.936 moles HI. So the options where part (a) is 0.936 are B and F. So I need to move on to part (b) to see which option is correct.

So part (b) is: I2 formed when H2 is 0.5 moles and HI is 1.5 moles. Hmm, let me set up another ICE table.

Wait, the initial conditions are H2 = 0.5, HI =1.5. I2 is zero? Or perhaps the problem is starting from H2 and HI, and I2 is formed. Wait, but the reaction is H2 + I2 → 2HI. So if we have some HI and H2, the reaction could go in reverse. So the initial moles are:

H2: 0.5

I2: 0 (because the question says "I2 formed when H2=0.5 and HI=1.5"), so initial I2 is 0.

HI: 1.5

Change: Let's let y be the moles of I2 formed. So, per reaction stoichiometry, for every 2 moles of HI consumed, we get 1 mole H2 and 1 mole I2. Wait, no: the reverse reaction is 2HI → H2 + I2. So if the reaction proceeds in reverse, each mole of H2 and I2 formed would consume 2 moles of HI.

Wait, more accurately, in the reverse direction:

For every 2 moles of HI that dissociate, we get 1 mole of H2 and 1 mole of I2.

So, in the change:

HI: -2y

H2: +y

I2: +y

At equilibrium:

H2: 0.5 + y

I2: y

HI: 1.5 - 2y

Now, Kc is 870 for the forward reaction, which is H2 + I2 → 2HI. So for the reverse reaction, the K would be 1/Kc = 1/870 ≈ 0.001149.

But wait, I'm writing the ICE table for the reverse reaction, so the equilibrium expression would be K_reverse = [H2][I2]/[HI]^2 = 1/870.

So,

K_reverse = ( (0.5 + y) * (y) ) / ( (1.5 - 2y)^2 ) = 1/870.

But since K_reverse is small (about 0.001), y will be small, so perhaps we can make some approximations. Let's see.

Let me write the equation:

( (0.5 + y) * y ) / ( (1.5 - 2y)^2 ) = 1/870.

Since y is small, let's approximate 0.5 + y ≈ 0.5, and 1.5 -2y ≈1.5. Let me check if this is a valid approximation.

So,

Approximate numerator: 0.5 * y

Denominator: (1.5)^2 = 2.25

So,

(0.5 y) / 2.25 = 1/870

Simplify:

0.5 y = (2.25)(1/870) → 0.5 y = 2.25 /870

Compute 2.25 /870: 2.25 ÷870 ≈ 0.002588.

So 0.5 y = 0.002588 → y ≈ 0.005176 moles.

So y is approximately 0.0052. Let's check if the approximation holds: 0.5 + y ≈0.5052, which is close to 0.5. 1.5 -2y ≈1.5 -0.0104 = 1.4896, which is close to 1.5. So the approximation is valid.

So, I2 formed is y ≈0.0052 moles, which is about 0.005 moles.

Looking back at the options, for part (b), the I2 formed is around 0.005. Checking the options, option F has part (b) as 0.005 I2. Let me check option F: (a) 0.936 moles HI, (b) 0.005 I2. So that fits.

Wait, but let's make sure. Let me compute more accurately without the approximation.

The exact equation is:

( (0.5 + y) y ) / (1.5 -2y)^2 = 1/870.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(0.5 + y) y = (1/870)(1.5 - 2y)^2.

Let me compute the right side:

1.5^2 = 2.25, (1.5 -2y)^2 = 2.25 -6y +4y².

So,

(0.5 + y)y = (1/870)(2.25 -6y +4y²)

Left side: 0.5y + y².

So,

0.5y + y² = (2.25 -6y +4y²)/870.

Multiply both sides by 870 to eliminate denominator:

870*(0.5y + y²) = 2.25 -6y +4y².

Compute left side: 435y +870y².

So,

435y +870y² = 2.25 -6y +4y².

Bring all terms to left:

435y +870y² -2.25 +6y -4y² =0

Combine like terms:

(870y² -4y²) + (435y +6y) -2.25 =0

866y² +441y -2.25 =0.

This is a quadratic equation: 866y² +441y -2.25=0.

Using quadratic formula:

y = [ -441 ± sqrt(441^2 -4*866*(-2.25)) ] / (2*866)

Calculate discriminant D:

441^2 = (440+1)^2 = 440² +2*440*1 +1= 193600 +880 +1=194481.

4*866*2.25: 4*866=3464; 3464*2.25= let's compute 3464*2=6928, 3464*0.25=866, so total 6928+866=7794.

So D = 194481 +7794* (since it's -4ac, so becomes positive) →194481 +7794=202,275.

Wait, wait, the term is -4ac, which is -4*866*(-2.25)= +4*866*2.25=7794.

So D=194481 +7794=202,275.

sqrt(202275)= approx 449.56 (since 450^2=202500, which is 225 more than 202275. So 450^2=202500, so 450- (225/(2*450)) )= 450 - 0.25=449.75. Let's say approximately 449.75.

So,

y = [ -441 ±449.75 ]/(2*866)

We can ignore the negative root because y can't be negative.

So,

y = ( -441 +449.75 )/(1732) → (8.75)/1732 ≈ 0.00505 moles.

So y≈0.00505, which is about 0.005 moles of I2 formed. So part (b) answer is approximately 0.005 I2 moles.

Looking back at the options, option F is (a) 0.936 HI, (b) 0.005 I2. So that's the correct one.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option B for part (b) is 0.010, which is higher than our calculated 0.005, so F is better.

So for part (a), HI is 0.936, and part (b) I2 is 0.005. So the correct answer is option F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium of the reaction **H₂(g) + I₂(g) ⇌ 2HI(g)** with **Kₚ = 870** at 25°C. Since Δn = 0, **Kₚ = Kₑ�**, and we use concentrations to calculate the equilibrium values.
