Okay, so I've got this problem about a worm gear, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is about determining the distance between the shaft centers and the pitch diameters of the worm and the gear. Hmm, I remember that in worm gears, the distance between the shaft centers is related to the pitch diameters of both the worm and the gear. 

The given data is a triple-threaded worm with a 2.5-inch lead, and the gear has a normal diametral pitch of 3.5 inches. The number of teeth on the gear is 32. Wait, diametral pitch is the number of teeth per inch of pitch diameter, right? So for the gear, the diametral pitch (P) is 3.5 in^-1. 

First, I think I need to find the pitch diameter of the gear. The formula for the pitch diameter of a gear is D = Z / P, where Z is the number of teeth and P is the diametral pitch. So for the gear, D_gear = 32 / 3.5. Let me calculate that: 32 divided by 3.5. Hmm, 3.5 goes into 32 about 9 times because 3.5 * 9 is 31.5, which leaves a remainder of 0.5. So 32/3.5 is approximately 9.142857 inches. So D_gear is roughly 9.1429 inches.

Wait, but wait—diametral pitch is in the normal direction, which I think is the same as the pitch circle diameter. So that part is correct.

Now, for the worm. The worm is triple-threaded with a lead of 2.5 inches. I remember that the lead is the distance one thread advances in one revolution. For a worm with multiple threads (like triple-threaded here), the lead is the distance between threads. The pitch of the worm is the lead divided by the number of threads. So the worm's pitch (p_worm) is 2.5 inches divided by 3. So 2.5/3 is approximately 0.8333 inches. 

Wait, no, wait. Because in worm terminology, the lead is the axial distance between corresponding points on successive threads. So for a triple-threaded worm, the lead (L) is the distance that the worm advances in one revolution. So yes, the pitch (which is the distance between threads) would be L divided by the number of threads. So p_worm = L / N_threads = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 in.

Now, the pitch diameter of the worm (D_worm) can be found from the pitch. The pitch of a worm is π times the pitch diameter divided by the number of threads? Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a worm, the pitch is the distance between two threads, measured along the pitch circle. I think the formula is similar to that for a gear. So the pitch diameter of the worm would be the pitch multiplied by the number of threads divided by π? Or wait, perhaps the pitch is the same as the circular pitch. Let me think again.

Wait, for a worm, the pitch (p) is the distance between two consecutive threads, measured parallel to the axis. But when considering the pitch diameter, I think the formula for the worm's pitch diameter is D_worm = (p_worm * N_threads) / π. Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing things. Oh wait, another approach: the lead is the pitch multiplied by the number of threads. Because lead L = p * N, where N is the number of threads. So if L is 2.5 in and N is 3, then p = L / N = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 in. 

But the pitch (p) is the distance between threads along the axis. The pitch in the transverse plane (which is what the diametral pitch refers to for the gear) would be p_transverse = p_axial / cos(λ), where λ is the lead angle. Wait, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, the pitch diameter of the worm can be found from the formula D_worm = (L) / (π * n_worm), where n_worm is the number of threads. Wait, no, perhaps another formula: The pitch diameter is related to the lead. For a single-thread worm, the lead is the same as the pitch. But for multiple threads, the lead is N times the pitch.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Let me think again. The pitch of a worm is the distance between two threads measured along the axis. So for a triple-threaded worm, the lead (distance one thread advances per revolution) is 3 times the pitch. So p = L / N = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 inches.

Now, the pitch diameter of the worm is calculated using the formula for the pitch diameter of a screw thread. Wait, the worm is essentially a screw. So the pitch diameter (D) is related to the pitch (p) by D = (p * 4) / (sqrt(3)), but wait, no, that's for the major diameter perhaps. Hmm, no, I think I'm getting confused with the geometry of the threads.

Wait, for a worm, the pitch diameter is calculated using the formula D = (L / π) * (number of threads). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The lead is the axial distance per revolution. The pitch is the axial distance between threads, so p = L / N.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this from the perspective of the pitch circle. The pitch circle is where the teeth are engaged. The pitch diameter of the worm is D_worm = (pitch) * (number of starts) / π. Wait, no, starts are the number of threads. So if the worm has 3 starts (triple-threaded), then D_worm = (p * N) / π. Wait, but p is already L/N, so substituting, D_worm = ( (L/N) * N ) / π = L / π. Oh! So the pitch diameter of the worm is simply lead divided by π.

Wait, that seems too straightforward, but let me check. Let's see: Lead L is the axial distance per revolution. The pitch is p = L / N, where N is the number of threads. The pitch diameter D would relate to the pitch via the formula D = (p * N) / π. Let me substitute p: D = ( (L/N) * N ) / π = L / π. So yes, D_worm = L / π.

So with L = 2.5 in, D_worm = 2.5 / π. Let me calculate that: π is approximately 3.1416, so 2.5 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.7958 inches. Wait, that seems really small. Wait, but a worm's pitch diameter can't be that small if the gear's pitch diameter is over 9 inches. That doesn't make sense. Because in a worm gear, the worm is usually the smaller of the two. But wait, the gear has 32 teeth and a diametral pitch of 3.5, giving it a pitch diameter of around 9.14 inches. If the worm's pitch diameter is about 0.8 inches, that would make the distance between centers the sum of their pitch radii, but that seems way too big a difference.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I'm confusing the pitch diameter of the worm with something else. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the same approach as for the gear. For gears, the pitch diameter D = number of teeth / diametral pitch. For the worm, which is a type of screw, the diametral pitch would be the same as the gear's. Wait, no, the diametral pitch is specific to the gear. The worm's pitch is given by the lead and the number of threads.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the distance between the shaft centers in a worm gear is equal to the sum of the radii of the worm and the gear. So the center distance (C) is (D_worm/2) + (D_gear/2) = (D_worm + D_gear)/2.

Wait, no, that's for spur gears. In worm gears, the distance between shaft centers is actually the sum of the pitch radii. But I think the formula is indeed (D_worm + D_gear)/2. Because each pitch diameter is twice the radius, so adding them and dividing by 2 gives the center distance.

Wait, but wait—no, the center distance isn't necessarily the sum of the radii. Wait, in worm gears, the axes are typically at right angles, so the distance between centers is the same as the sum of the radii. So yes, C = (D_worm + D_gear)/2.

But earlier, when I calculated D_worm as 0.7958 inches, and D_gear as ~9.1429 inches, the sum would be ~10 inches. Divided by 2, that's 5 inches. But the answer options don't include 5 inches. Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option D: 5.5 in. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating D_worm.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for the worm's pitch diameter. Let me think again. Maybe I should be using the same diametral pitch as the gear? No, that doesn't make sense, because the worm's pitch is given by the lead and number of threads.

Wait, another way: the worm's pitch diameter is determined by the module. Module m is the pitch divided by π. But wait, the diametral pitch P is the reciprocal of the module. So m = 1/P. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the worm's pitch diameter using the formula for the pitch diameter of a screw thread. The formula is D = major diameter = (number of threads per inch)^(-1) * (1 + 2n), where n is the number of threads. No, wait, that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't look anything up right now, so I have to think. Let me recall that the pitch diameter of the worm is D_worm = (lead) / (π * number_of_threads). Wait, that would be D_worm = L/(π*N). So with L=2.5 in, N=3, D_worm = 2.5/(3*π) ≈ 2.5/(9.4248) ≈ 0.265 inches. That's even smaller, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the lead with the pitch. Let me think again. The lead is the distance the worm moves in one revolution. The pitch is the distance between the threads. So, for a triple-threaded worm, the pitch p = L/N = 2.5/3 ≈ 0.8333 in. 

The pitch diameter (D) is the diameter at which the threads are cut, so for a worm, it's the same as the major diameter of the screw thread. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the pitch diameter of the worm is D = (number of threads) * p / π. Wait, that would be D = 3 * 0.8333 / π ≈ 2.5/π ≈ 0.7958 inches. That brings me back to the same number as before.

But if the worm's pitch diameter is 0.7958 inches and the gear's is 9.1429 inches, their sum is 9.9387 inches. Divided by 2, that's approximately 4.969 inches, around 5 inches. But the options don't have 5.0, but D is 5.5. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gear calculation. Let me double-check that. The gear has 32 teeth, diametral pitch (P) of 3.5 in^-1. So D_gear = Z / P = 32 / 3.5. Let's compute that: 3.5 * 9 = 31.5, so 32 is 0.5 more. So 32/3.5 = 9.142857 inches. That seems correct.

Wait, but wait. The diametral pitch is in the normal direction, which for a worm gear is the transverse direction. Wait, no, in worm gears, the gear's pitch diameter is based on the normal diametral pitch. So I think that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the worm's pitch diameter. Another approach: perhaps the worm's pitch diameter is calculated using the same diametral pitch as the gear. But that doesn't make sense because the worm and gear have different pitches.

Wait, no, the diametral pitch is specific to the gear. The worm's pitch is given by the lead and the number of threads. So the worm's pitch is 2.5 inches lead for 3 threads. So p_worm = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 in.

Wait, now, for a worm, the pitch diameter D is related to the pitch p by the formula D = (p * n) / π, where n is the number of threads. So D_worm = (0.8333 in * 3) / π ≈ (2.5)/3.1416 ≈ 0.7958 in. So that still gives me the same D_worm.

But if that's the case, the center distance is (D_worm + D_gear)/2 ≈ (0.7958 + 9.1429)/2 ≈ (9.9387)/2 ≈ 4.9693 inches. So about 4.97 inches, which is approximately 5 inches. But the options don't have 5.0. Wait, let me look at the options again. The options are:

A:6.3, B:7.1, C:5.7, D:5.5, E:6.5, F:7.3, G:6.9, H:7.5, I:6.1, J:5.9.

Hmm, the closest is D:5.5, but my calculation says ~4.97. So perhaps I have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the distance between shaft centers is different. In worm gears, the center distance is equal to the sum of the worm's pitch radius and the gear's pitch radius. So that would be (D_worm/2) + (D_gear/2) = (D_worm + D_gear)/2, which is what I did. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm using the wrong diameters for the worm. Maybe I should be using the worm's OUTSIDE diameter instead of the pitch diameter? Or perhaps the worm's pitch diameter is the same as its major diameter. Hmm, no, the pitch diameter is the diameter at which the threads are measured.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the worm's pitch diameter. Let me think differently. The pitch of the worm is 0.8333 in, which is the axial distance between threads. The pitch diameter would be the diameter that corresponds to that pitch. In screw threads, the pitch diameter is D = (major diameter + minor diameter)/2. But I think that's more detailed than needed here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the worm's pitch diameter is D_worm = (lead) / (π * sin(α)), where α is the thread angle. But I don't have information about the thread angle, so that might not be applicable.

Wait, another angle: in worm gearing, the number of threads on the worm must mesh with the number of teeth on the gear. So the ratio is the number of gear teeth divided by the number of worm threads. But that affects the speed ratio, not the pitch diameters directly.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the worm's lead with its pitch. Let me clarify: the lead is the axial advance per revolution, while the pitch is the axial distance between threads. So for a triple-threaded worm, the pitch p = L / N = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 inches.

Now, the pitch diameter of the worm is related to the pitch. For a worm, the pitch diameter D is the diameter of the pitch circle, which is the same as the middle of the thread. But without knowing the thread depth, I can't calculate the major or minor diameters. However, in the context of gears and worms, the pitch diameter is often calculated as D = L / (π * N), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the worm's pitch and the number of threads. Let me consider the worm's pitch in terms of its circular pitch. The circular pitch is the pitch measured along the circumference, so p_circular = p_axial / sin(90°), which is just p_axial. Because the worm's threads are at a right angle, the circular pitch would be equal to the axial pitch, which is p = 0.8333 inches.

Thus, the circular pitch is 0.8333 inches, which is the distance between two threads along the pitch circle. The pitch diameter D would then be related to the circular pitch by p_circular = π * D / N, where N is the number of threads. So rearranging, D = (p_circular * N) / π.

Plugging in the numbers: p_circular is 0.8333 in, N=3. So D = (0.8333 * 3) / π ≈ 2.5 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.7958 inches. So that brings me back to the same D_worm.

But that gives me a center distance of (0.7958 + 9.1429)/2 ≈ 4.97 inches, which is not matching any of the options except perhaps J:5.9, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute. Maybe I'm supposed to calculate the center distance as the sum of the radii, but perhaps I'm using the wrong diameters for one of them. Alternatively, perhaps the worm's pitch diameter is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the worm's pitch is not L / N, but rather L is the pitch multiplied by the number of threads. So L = p * N. So p = L / N = 2.5 / 3 ≈ 0.8333 in. Then, the worm's pitch diameter would be D_worm = p / (π * sin(θ)), where θ is the angle of the worm threads. But without knowing θ, I can't compute this. Alternatively, perhaps the worm's pitch diameter is the
