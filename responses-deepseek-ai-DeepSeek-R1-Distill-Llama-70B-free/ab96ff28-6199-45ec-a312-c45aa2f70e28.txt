Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation. Hmm, let me think. The question says the Global Bus Company bought a bus for $40,000 and they're depreciating it on a straight-line basis over five years. I need to find out the book value after two years.

Wait, straight-line depreciation is when you spread the cost evenly over the useful life, right? So each year, the bus loses the same amount of value. 

First, I should calculate the annual depreciation. The formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life. But wait, the question doesn't mention a salvage value. Oh, right, sometimes in these problems, if the salvage isn't given, you can assume it's zero. So I'll proceed with that.

So the cost is $40,000 and the life is five years. So annual depreciation would be 40,000 divided by 5. Let me do that math. 40k divided by 5 is 8,000. So each year, the bus depreciates by $8,000.

Now, after two years, the total depreciation would be 2 times 8,000. That's 16,000. So the book value is the original cost minus the accumulated depreciation. So 40,000 minus 16,000 equals 24,000.

Let me double-check the options. Option F is $24,000. So that must be the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key points were knowing the formula for straight-line and correctly calculating the annual amount. Since no salvage value was given, assuming zero makes sense in this context.

To determine the book value of the bus after 2 years using straight-line depreciation:

1. **Annual Depreciation Calculation**:  
   \[
   \text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}  
   \]  
   Since no salvage value is provided, it is assumed to be $0.  
   \[
   \text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{40,000}{5} = 8,000  
   \]

2. **Accumulated Depreciation After 2 Years**:  
   \[
   \text{Accumulated Depreciation} = 2 \times 8,000 = 16,000  
   \]

3. **Book Value After 2 Years**:  
   \[
   \text{Book Value} = \text{Cost} - \text{Accumulated Depreciation} = 40,000 - 16,000 = 24,000  
   \]

The correct answer is **F: $24,000**.
