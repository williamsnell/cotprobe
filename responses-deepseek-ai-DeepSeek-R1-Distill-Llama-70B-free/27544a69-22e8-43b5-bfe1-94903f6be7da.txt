Okay, so I have this question about space communication systems and signal power passed by a filter. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question gives me the bandwidth BW as (2β + 1)f_m, where β is the modulation index. Wait, I remember that in modulation, the modulation index β is the ratio of the maximum frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. So like, for FM (Frequency Modulation), the bandwidth depends on β and the message frequency f_m.

The problem gives β as 0.2 and 5. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no. Oh, wait, maybe I misread that. The question says β is 0.2 and 5. Oh wait, no, looking again: It says "If β = 0.2 and 5, determine..." Wait, that can't be right. Oh, maybe it's a typo, perhaps the user meant β = 0.2 and 5, but that doesn't make sense because β is a single parameter. Oh wait, perhaps the question is giving two different β values? Or maybe it's for two different scenarios, like when β is 0.2 and when it's 5. That makes sense because the options are pairs.

So the first part is when β is 0.2 and the second is when β is 5. And for each, we need to find the fraction of the signal power passed by the filter. Oh right, so probably two calculations here, each giving a value, and matching to the options.

I think the key here is to calculate the power in the frequency components of an FM signal and see how much falls within the given bandwidth. Wait, but how does the filter work? Because the bandwidth here is calculated as (2β + 1)f_m, which I think refers to the Carson's rule bandwidth for FM. Carson's bandwidth is β times (f_m) + some factor. Wait, no, Carson's formula is BW = 2(β + 1)f_m, but wait, I thought it was 2(β +1 ) times f_m. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think: For an FM signal, the Carson's bandwidth is given by 2 times (β +1 ) multiplied by the modulating frequency. So BW = 2(β +1)f_m. But in the question, it's given as (2β +1)f_m. Hmmm, that's different. Oh maybe in this question, the formula is defined differently. So perhaps in this problem, BW is (2β +1) times f_m. So for each β, compute the BW accordingly.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of signal power passed by the filter. So the filter's bandwidth is the BW given. So the fraction is the ratio of the power within this BW to the total power. So I need to find the power within the Carson's bandwidth, which depends on β.

Wait, for FM signals, the power is distributed among the carrier and the sidebands. The total power in an FM signal is the sum of the carrier and all the sidebands. The carrier has a certain power, and each sideband has its own. But when you have a modulation index β, the power in the carrier is J_0(β) squared, where J_0 is the Bessel function of the first kind, order zero. And each sideband has terms involving J_n(β), where n is the harmonic number (like 1,2,3...). 

But I'm not sure about the exact expressions. Wait, the total average power for an FM signal is given by P_total = P_c [ J_0(β)^2 + 2 sum_{n=1}^∞ J_n(β)^2 ] where the sum is over odd n, perhaps? Wait, no, I think that for an FM signal, the power is P_c times the sum of J_n(β)^2 for all n, but only for the existing sidebands. But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, I remember that the total power in the sidebands is P_side = P_c [ 1 - J_0(β)^2 ], so the total power is P_total = P_c J_0(β)^2 + P_side = P_c.

Wait, no, that can't be right because P_side would be P_c times [1 - J_0(β)^2], making the total P_c [ J_0^2 + (1 - J_0^2) ) ] = P_c. So the total power remains the same as the carrier power, which makes sense because FM has a constant amplitude, so the total power is the same as the unmodulated carrier.

Wait, but in any case, when the signal is passed through a filter with a certain bandwidth, only a portion of the power is captured. So the fraction would be the sum of the power in the carrier plus the sidebands that fall within the filter's bandwidth, divided by the total power.

So first, I need to find the number of significant sidebands present within the filter's bandwidth. Then, calculate the sum of their powers plus the carrier's power, and then find the fraction.

But wait, the given BW is (2β +1) f_m. So for each β, I can compute how many sidebands are within this BW.

Wait, for an FM signal, the sidebands are spaced at f_m apart, both above and below the carrier. So the first sidebands are at ±f_m, second at ±2f_m, etc. So the bandwidth is determined by how many of these are included.

So the BW given is (2β +1) f_m. Let me consider each case.

Case 1: β = 0.2

Compute BW = (2*0.2 +1) f_m = (0.4 +1) f_m = 1.4 f_m.

So the bandwidth is 1.4 times f_m. Now, the sidebands are spaced by f_m. So how many sidebands are within this BW?

The carrier is at 0, and the sidebands go up to ±n f_m, where n is the number of sidebands. So the maximum frequency would be (n) f_m.

Wait, the BW is the total bandwidth. So the maximum frequency from the carrier is BW/2 on each side. So BW = 2 * (n + 0.5) f_m ? No, wait, the BW is the total, from the lowest to the highest frequency. So if the highest sideband is at n f_m, and the lowest at -n f_m, then the BW is 2n f_m. But in our case, BW is (2β +1) f_m. So 2n f_m = (2β +1) f_m → n = (2β +1)/2.

Wait, that might not be correct because the BW includes both sides. Alternatively, the maximum frequency is (n + 0.5) f_m, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of which sidebands are included within the BW. Since the BW is 1.4 f_m, the maximum sideband frequency is 0.7 f_m on either side of the carrier. So the first sideband is at f_m, which is 1 f_m away. But 0.7 f_m is less than 1 f_m, so the first sideband may not be fully included. Wait, wait a minute. No, wait: The BW is (2β +1) f_m = 1.4 f_m. So the maximum frequency deviation from the carrier is 0.7 f_m on each side. So any sideband beyond that will be cut off.

But in an FM signal, the sidebands are at integer multiples of f_m away from the carrier. So the first sidebands are at f_m and -f_m. But since 0.7 f_m is less than f_m, the first sideband at f_m is beyond the filter's cutoff. So in this case, only the carrier is within the BW. So all the power would be in the carrier.

Wait, but that can't be right because the carrier is at 0, and the filter's BW is 1.4 f_m, so from -0.7 f_m to +0.7 f_m. So any sidebands beyond that are cut. So the first sidebands are at f_m, which is 1.0 f_m, which is beyond 0.7 f_m. So they're not included.

So all the power within the BW is just the carrier. The power in the carrier is P_c J_0(β)^2. Since the total power is P_c, the fraction is J_0(β)^2.

So for β = 0.2, J_0(0.2) is approximately 0.98, so J_0^2 is about 0.96. Wait, but wait: J_0(0.2) is about 0.98, so square is about 0.96, which is 96% of the power. But looking at the options, none have 96%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the Bessel function values. J_0(0) is 1. J_0(0.2) is approximately 0.9801. So J_0 squared is about 0.9607. So fraction is 96.07% passed. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the filter's bandwidth is (2β +1) f_m, which for β=0.2 is 1.4 f_m. So the maximum frequency in the BW is 0.7 f_m. So the first sideband is at f_m, which is beyond that. So only the carrier is included. So the power within the BW is the carrier power, which is J_0(β)^2 times P_c. So the fraction is J_0(β)^2.

Wait, but when β is small, J_0(β) is approximately 1 - (β^2)/4. So for β=0.2, J_0(0.2) is about 0.98, so J_0^2 is about 0.96, which is 96% power. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about AM (Amplitude Modulation) instead of FM. Because the formula given for BW seems different. Wait, for AM, the bandwidth is 2f_m because you have the carrier and two sidebands each spaced by f_m. But the given BW is (2β +1)f_m. Hmm, that doesn't fit AM either. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of modulation, but the question says it's space communication, which often uses FM or PM.

Wait, another thought: If the filter's bandwidth is (2β +1)f_m, then when β is 0.2, the BW is 1.4 f_m. So the maximum sideband included is at 0.7 f_m. Since the first sideband is at f_m, which is beyond 0.7, so only the carrier is within the BW. So the power is J_0(β)^2.

But when β is 5, BW is (2*5 +1) f_m = 11 f_m. So maximum sideband is 5.5 f_m. Since the sidebands are at f_m, 2f_m, 3f_m, etc. So the maximum number within 5.5 f_m is up to 5f_m, because 5f_m is less than 5.5, and 6f_m is beyond. So the sidebands included are from -5f_m to +5f_m, which is the 5th sideband. So the power within the BW includes the carrier and all sidebands up to n=5.

So the fraction would be [J_0(β)^2 + 2*(J_1^2 + J_2^2 + J_3^2 + J_4^2 + J_5^2)].

Wait, because for each sideband, the power is J_n(β)^2, and since each n has upper and lower sidebands, their contributions are each 2*J_n^2, except the carrier (n=0) which is J_0^2.

So, when β=5, the fraction is J_0(5)^2 + 2*(J_1(5)^2 + J_2(5)^2 + J_3(5)^2 + J_4(5)^2 + J_5(5)^2).

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here because I don't remember the exact values of Bessel functions for β=5. I think that for β=5, most of the power is in the sidebands beyond n=5, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the power within the Carson's bandwidth. So for each β, calculate how much of the signal's power lies within that BW.

But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the possible fractions given in the options.

Looking at the options, each is a pair, like option A is 60% and 95%. Since for β=0.2, the BW includes only the carrier, so the fraction is J_0(0.2)^2 ≈ 0.96, which is about 96%. But none of the options have 96%. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the filter's BW is (2β +1) f_m, but that the BW is the total, meaning that the highest frequency is (2β +1) f_m / 2. So for β=0.2, BW is 1.4 f_m → half on each side is 0.7 f_m. So only the carrier is included, as the first sideband is at f_m, which is beyond 0.7. So the fraction is J_0^2 ≈ 0.96, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for BW is 2(β +1) f_m, which is the Carson's formula. Then, for β=0.2, BW is 2*(0.2 +1)*f_m = 2.2 f_m. So the maximum frequency is 1.1 f_m. So the first sideband is at f_m, which is within 1.1 f_m. So the first sideband is included. So the BW includes the carrier and the first sideband pair (±f_m). So the fraction is J_0^2 + 2 J_1^2.

Wait, for β=0.2, J_0(0.2)=0.9801, J_1(0.2)=0.5767. So J_0^2=0.9607, J_1^2≈0.3325. So the fraction is 0.9607 + 2*0.3325 ≈ 0.9607 + 0.665 ≈ 1.6257. Wait, that's impossible because it's more than 1. So that can't be right. Wait, no, no, no, because the total power is 1. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The power is the sum of the carrier and the sidebands within the BW. Each sideband contributes 2*J_n(β)^2, because there are two sidebands (upper and lower). So for each n, the power is 2*J_n^2, except for n=0, which is J_0^2. So the fraction is (J_0^2 + 2 sum J_n^2) for n up to the number of sidebands included.

But when the BW is 2.2 f_m, which is 2*(β+1) f_m, which would include all sidebands up to n=1, because the second sideband is at 2f_m, which is beyond 2.2 f_m? Wait, no. Wait, 2.2 f_m is the total BW, so from -1.1 f_m to +1.1 f_m. So the first sideband is at f_m, which is 1.0 f_m, which is within 1.1 f_m. So the first sideband is included. The second sideband is at 2f_m, which is beyond 1.1, so not included. So for β=0.2, BW includes carrier and the first sideband pair. So the fraction is J_0^2 + 2*J_1^2.

So J_0(0.2)≈0.9801, so J_0^2≈0.9607.

J_1(0.2)≈0.5767, so J_1^2≈0.3325.

So sum is 0.9607 + 2 * 0.3325 = 0.9607 + 0.665 = 1.6257. Wait, that can't be right because it's over 100%. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Ah, wait, no, because the total power is P_c (the carrier) times [J_0^2 + 2 sum J_n^2], which sums up to 1, because P_total = P_c [J_0^2 + 2 sum J_n^2] for all n ≥1. So for each n, we include 2 J_n^2 if their frequency is within the BW.

So for β=0.2, BW includes up to n=1. So the fraction is J_0^2 + 2 J_1^2 = 0.9607 + 2*(0.3325) ≈ 0.9607 + 0.665 ≈ 1.6257? No, that's over 1. So that can't be right. Wait, that suggests I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the BW is (2β +1) f_m, not 2(β +1) f_m. So for β=0.2, BW is 1.4 f_m. So maximum frequency is 0.7 f_m. So the first sideband at f_m is at 1.0 f_m, which is beyond 0.7. So only the carrier is included. So the fraction is J_0^2 = 0.9607, which is 96.07%. But the options don't have anything close to that. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the power within the bandwidth of the modulated signal, which for FM is given by (2β + 1) f_m,
