Question:

Costs for producing one widget: Materials:2 parts (a) $25.00 per part Expenses :$10.00 Labor :20 operations (a) $5.00 per operation Based on the above information, which is the only valid conclusion? (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget. (B) labor rates are excessive (C) output is labor intensive (D) material costs are low

Options:

A: Each widget requires $50.00 in labor for 10 operations
B: Material costs represent the smallest fraction of the total production cost
C: output is labor intensive
D: material costs are low
E: Expenses are greater than the combined costs of materials and labor
F: The selling price should be $160 per widget
G: The most significant cost in producing a widget is the expense fee
H: labor rates are excessive
I: The total cost of production is less than $100 per widget
J: There are 10 operations involved in labor, each at $10.00 per operation

Okay, so I have this question about production costs for a widget, and I need to figure out the correct conclusion. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me three categories of costs: materials, expenses, and labor. Each has a specific unit cost and quantity. Let's list them out.

Materials: 2 parts at $25 each. So that would be 2 * $25 = $50 on materials.

Expenses: A flat $10.00. Hmm, that's a fixed cost, I think. So that's straightforward.

Labor: 20 operations at $5 each. Wait, 20 operations? So that's 20 * $5 = $100 for labor.

Wait, so adding them all up: materials are $50, expenses $10, labor $100. So total cost per widget is $50 + $10 + $100 = $160. Okay, that's the total cost to produce one widget.

Now the question is asking which conclusion is valid based on this info. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Selling price should be $160. Well, that's the total cost, but selling price isn't necessarily the same as cost. It could be higher to make profit, or maybe lower if they're pricing competitively. So I don't think we can conclude that the selling price should be exactly $160. So probably A is not the correct answer.

Option B: Material costs are the smallest fraction. Let's see. Materials are $50, expenses $10, labor $100. So yes, materials are $50, which is less than labor's $100. But wait, expenses are only $10, which is smaller than materials. So the smallest is expenses, then materials, then labor. So material costs are not the smallest. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Output is labor intensive. Labor costs are the highest at $100, which is more than materials and expenses combined ($60). So yes, that suggests that labor is a significant part of the cost, hence labor-intensive. So C could be a correct conclusion.

Option D: Material costs are low. Well, $50 might be considered low depending on context, but compared to other costs, it's not the lowest. Expenses are lower. So D might not be correct because material costs aren't the lowest, but maybe they're low in some absolute sense. Not sure.

Option E: Expenses are greater than materials and labor combined. Wait, materials plus labor would be $50 + $100 = $150. Expenses are only $10, which is way less than $150. So E is wrong.

Option F: Selling price should be $160. Same as A, which I thought was not necessarily correct.

Option G: The most significant cost is the expense fee. No, because expenses are only $10. The most is labor at $100. So G is wrong.

Option H: Labor rates are excessive. Well, labor cost is $5 per operation, 20 operations makes $100. Is that excessive? It's high compared to materials and expenses, but without knowing market rates, I can't say. So H is a bit subjective. The question is about which conclusion is valid based on the given info. The data shows labor is the highest cost, but whether the rate is excessive is an opinion.

Option I: Total cost is less than $100. No, because it's $160. So I is wrong.

Option J: There are 10 operations at $10 each. Wait, no, the question says 20 operations at $5 each. So J is incorrect.

So reviewing the options, option C says output is labor-intensive. Since labor is the highest cost, that's a valid conclusion. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is "output is labor intensive" and option B is "material costs are the smallest fraction." Wait, materials are $50, expenses $10, so expenses are the smallest. So the order is labor ($100) > materials ($50) > expenses ($10). So material costs are not the smallest, so B is wrong. So C is correct.

To determine the valid conclusion, we analyze the costs provided:

1. **Materials**: 2 parts at $25 each = $50.  
2. **Expenses**: A flat $10.  
3. **Labor**: 20 operations at $5 each = $100.  

The total cost per widget is $50 (materials) + $10 (expenses) + $100 (labor) = **$160**.

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A**: Selling price should be $160.  
  - Selling price is not necessarily equal to total cost, so this is not a valid conclusion.  

- **B**: Material costs represent the smallest fraction of the total production cost.  
  - Expenses ($10) are smaller than materials ($50), so this is incorrect.  

- **C**: Output is labor-intensive.  
  - Labor costs ($100) are the highest, making this a valid conclusion.  

- **D**: Material costs are low.  
  - While $50 might seem low in some contexts, it is not the smallest cost, so this is not the best conclusion.  

- **E**: Expenses are greater than the combined costs of materials and labor.  
  - Expenses ($10) are much less than materials ($50) and labor ($100), so this is incorrect.  

- **F**: The selling price should be $160.  
  - Same as A; selling price is not necessarily equal to total cost, so this is incorrect.  

- **G**: The most significant cost in producing a widget is the expense fee.  
  - Labor ($100) is the most significant cost, not expenses ($10), so this is incorrect.  

- **H**: Labor rates are excessive.  
  - While labor costs are high, whether they are "excessive" is subjective and cannot be concluded from the data.  

- **I**: The total cost of production is less than $100 per widget.  
  - The total cost is $160, so this is incorrect.  

- **J**: There are 10 operations involved in labor, each at $10.  
  - The question specifies 20 operations at $5 each, so this is incorrect.  

The only valid conclusion is **C**: Output is labor-intensive, as labor costs dominate the total production cost.
