Question:

When an adult mouse or bird is castrated, its sexual behavior virtually disappears. Compare the effects of castration of highly developed primates with the less developed animals.

Options:

A: In higher primates such as man, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced.
B: In primates, castration after sexual maturity reduces aggression but has no effect on sexual behavior.
C: Primates show a temporary decline in sexual behavior post-castration, but it fully recovers within weeks.
D: Castration in primates results in complete loss of sexual behavior
E: Castration in primates has no effect on their sexual behavior at any stage of development.
F: Castration of primates leads to an increase in sexual behavior due to hormonal imbalances.
G: Castration affects the ability to perform sexual acts in all animals
H: Primates can't learn sexual behavior through experience
I: Castration of primates causes a permanent shift to non-sexual social behavior patterns.
J: In higher primates, castration before puberty prevents the development of sexual behavior entirely.

Okay, so I have this question about castration effects on sexual behavior in animals, specifically comparing higher primates to less developed ones. Let me think through what I remember about this.

The question says that when an adult mouse or bird is castrated, their sexual behavior almost disappears. So for these animals, which are less developed, sexual behavior is heavily dependent on hormones like testosterone. Castration removes the testes, so the hormone levels drop, leading to the loss of sexual behavior.

Now, the question is about higher primates, like humans. I remember that in humans and other primates, the situation is a bit different. From what I've read, while hormones do play a role, behavior isn't entirely dependent on them. So if a human is castrated, especially after they've gone through puberty and have had sexual experiences, they might still be able to perform sexually, though maybe with less desire.

Looking at the options:

Option A: In higher primates, castration doesn't affect the ability to perform the sexual act if the male is mature and experienced. That sounds familiar. Like, they can still perform because they've learned the behavior, but maybe the drive decreases.

Option B: Castration after maturity reduces aggression but doesn't affect sexual behavior. I'm not sure about that. I think sexual behavior might still be affected, but maybe not as much as in other animals.

Option C: Temporary decline but recovers in weeks. I don't think that's right. Once hormones are gone, the effect should be more permanent unless something else is at play.

Option D: Complete loss. No, that's more like the mice and birds, not primates.

Option E: No effect. That can't be right because hormones do have some role.

Option F: Increase in behavior. Doesn't make sense; castration would likely decrease, not increase.

Option G: Affects all animals. No, the premise says higher primates are different.

Option H: Can't learn through experience. Not sure, but I think primates can learn, so this might not be correct.

Option I: Shift to non-sexual behavior permanently. Not sure. Maybe, but I don't recall that being the main point.

Option J: Castration before puberty prevents sexual behavior entirely. I think that's true because without puberty, they don't develop secondary sexual characteristics and the neural pathways might not form. But the question is about adults.

Wait, the question is about adult castration. So looking back, the correct answer would be about adult castration in primates. So option A says that in higher primates, if they're mature and experienced, castration doesn't stop them from performing. So they can still do the act, but maybe have less libido.

Alternatively, I've heard that in humans, castration can reduce sexual desire and performance, but some function may remain. But the key point is that behavior isn't entirely eliminated as in mice. So option A seems correct because it says the ability to perform remains, provided they are mature and experienced.

So the answer should be A.

When comparing the effects of castration on sexual behavior in higher primates versus less developed animals, it is important to note that in animals like mice and birds, castration leads to a near-complete disappearance of sexual behavior due to their heavy reliance on hormones such as testosterone. However, in higher primates, including humans, the situation differs. Sexual behavior in primates is not entirely dependent on hormones and is influenced by factors like experience and learning.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that in higher primates, castration does not eliminate the ability to perform sexual acts if the individual is sexually mature and experienced. This aligns with the understanding that while hormones like testosterone influence libido, learned sexual behavior can persist.
- **Option B** suggests castration reduces aggression but does not affect sexual behavior, which is inaccurate as sexual behavior is typically affected to some extent.
- **Option C** claims a temporary decline with full recovery, which is incorrect as hormonal effects are more permanent.
- **Option D** states complete loss of sexual behavior, which is more applicable to less developed animals.
- **Option E** claims no effect on sexual behavior, which is incorrect as hormones do play a role.
- **Option F** suggests an increase in sexual behavior, which is implausible.
- **Option G** states castration affects all animals similarly, which contradicts the premise.
- **Option H** implies primates cannot learn sexual behavior, which is false.
- **Option I** suggests a permanent shift to non-sexual behavior, which is not the primary outcome.
- **Option J** refers to castration before puberty, which is outside the scope of adult castration.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it accurately reflects the persistence of sexual behavior in experienced, mature primates post-castration.

Answer: A
