Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about a vertical wall that's 2.0 feet high. The surface temperature is 500°F, and the air around it is at 120°F. I need to find the heat transfer per foot of wall width. Oh, and I have to neglect radiation, so it's only convection and conduction maybe? Wait, no, since it's a vertical wall, I think it's natural convection.

Wait, wait, the problem says to work in both English and SI units. So I'll probably need to do some unit conversions here. Let me think about the formula for heat transfer due to convection. Oh right, the formula is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

But wait, I don't know the value of h. How do I find that? Oh right, for natural convection, h depends on the properties of the fluid (air in this case) and the geometry of the surface. I remember that for vertical plates, there's a correlation for h using the Grashof number and Prandtl number.

The Grashof number (Gr) is given by Gr = g * β * (T_s - T_inf) * L^3 / ν², where g is the acceleration due to gravity, β is the volume expansion coefficient, T_s is the surface temperature, T_inf is the ambient temperature, L is the characteristic length (height here), and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

Once I have Gr, I can find the Nusselt number (Nu) using the appropriate correlation. For vertical plates, the correlation is usually something like Nu = 0.27 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) for laminar flow, which is when Gr * Pr is less than 1e9 or something like that. Wait, no, I think the exact exponent might vary. Maybe it's Nu = 0.27 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) when Gr*Pr is between 1e4 and 1e9. Or was it 0.59 multiplied by (Gr*Pr)^(1/4) for certain ranges? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact values.

Wait, alternatively, I think for air, there's a simplified formula for the heat transfer coefficient. Maybe something like h = 1.42 * (ΔT/L)^(1/4) for vertical surfaces. Or was that for horizontal? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I can look up the formula for natural convection from a vertical plate. The standard formula is Nu = (4/3) * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) * (1 + (0.492/Pr)^(1/2)) )^(−1/4) ) for Pr > 0. That might be more accurate, but it's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, for air, which has a Prandtl number around 0.7, maybe the simpler correlation suffices.

Wait, maybe I should proceed step by step. First, I'll compute the temperature difference. The surface is at 500°F, and the air is at 120°F. So ΔT is 500 - 120 = 380°F. But wait, for natural convection, the temperature difference is in absolute terms, so it's 380°F. But wait, when using SI units, I'll need to convert that to Kelvin. Since Fahrenheit to Kelvin isn't direct, but I can convert each temperature to Kelvin first.

So 500°F to Kelvin: 500°F is equal to 500 - 32 = 468°F above freezing. Since each degree F is 5/9 K, so 468 * 5/9 = let's calculate that. 468 divided by 9 is 52, times 5 is 260 K, so 500°F is 260 + 273.15? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, 500°F is (500-32) * 5/9 + 273.15. So 468 * 5/9 = 260, 260 + 273.15 = 533.15 K. Wait, but the problem states the surface temp as 523.3 K. Oh, wait, maybe I should use the given values.

Wait, the problem says the surface temperature is 500°F (523.3 K), and the air is 120°F (322.2 K). Oh, okay, so ΔT is 523.3 - 322.2 = 201.1 K. That's the temperature difference in Kelvin.

The height L is 2.0 ft, which is 0.610 meters.

So, to compute Gr, I need the properties of air at the film temperature. The film temperature is the average of the surface and ambient temperatures. So T_film = (523.3 + 322.2)/2 = (845.5)/2 = 422.75 K.

At this temperature, I'll need the kinematic viscosity ν, thermal diffusivity α, and the thermal expansion coefficient β, which is 1/T (since for ideal gases, β = 1/T). Wait, no, for air, the volumetric expansion coefficient β is approximately 1/T where T is in Kelvin. So β = 1/422.75 K^-1.

Wait, but more accurately, β is the volume expansion coefficient, which for an ideal gas is 1/T. So yes, β = 1/(422.75) K^-1.

The kinematic viscosity ν for air at around 423 K (since 422.75 is about 423 K) is approximately... I remember that at 300 K, ν for air is about 1.6e-5 m²/s. At higher temperatures, it increases. Let me think, maybe ν is around 2.2e-5 m²/s at 423 K? Alternatively, perhaps I can recall or approximate it. Alternatively, I can use the formula for viscosity. But perhaps I can look up the values, but since I can't, I'll proceed with approximate values.

Wait, maybe I should use the properties of air at T_film = 423 K. Let me try to remember or approximate:

At 300 K:
- ν ≈ 1.6e-5 m²/s
- Pr ≈ 0.7
- k (thermal conductivity) ≈ 0.025 W/m·K

At higher temperatures, these properties change. For example, at 500 K, ν is around 2.2e-5 m²/s, Pr is still around 0.7, and k is about 0.042 W/m·K. Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps I can use more precise values, but for the sake of this problem, let's proceed with some approximations.

So, let's take ν = 2.2e-5 m²/s, Pr = 0.7, and β = 1/423 K^-1.

Compute Gr: Gr = g * β * (ΔT) * L^3 / ν².

g is 9.81 m/s².

So plugging in the numbers:

Gr = 9.81 * (1/423.75) * 201.1 * (0.610)^3 / (2.2e-5)^2.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute each term:

β = 1/422.75 ≈ 0.002366 K^-1.

ΔT = 201.1 K.

L = 0.610 m.

ν = 2.2e-5 m²/s.

So:

Gr = (9.81) * (0.002366) * (201.1) * (0.610)^3 / (2.2e-5)^2.

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Compute numerator: 9.81 * 0.002366 = approx 0.02319.

Multiply by 201.1: 0.02319 * 201.1 ≈ 4.66.

Multiply by (0.610)^3: 0.610^3 is 0.610 * 0.610 = 0.3721, then *0.610 is ≈ 0.227. So 4.66 * 0.227 ≈ 1.058.

Denominator: (2.2e-5)^2 = (2.2)^2 * (1e-5)^2 = 4.84 * 1e-10 = 4.84e-10.

So Gr ≈ 1.058 / 4.84e-10 ≈ approximately 2.19e9.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.058 / 4.84e-10 = (1.058 / 4.84) * 1e10 = approx 0.2186 * 1e10 = 2.186e9.

So Gr ≈ 2.186e9.

Now, compute Nu using the correlation. For a vertical plate, the correlation is Nu = 0.27 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) when Gr*Pr is in the range 1e5 to 1e10.

Wait, let me check the exact correlation. Another source I recall uses Nu = 0.27 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) for 10^4 < Gr*Pr < 10^9. Alternatively, another formula might apply, but let me proceed with this.

Pr is 0.7, so Gr*Pr = 2.186e9 * 0.7 ≈ 1.530e9.

Which is within the range, so the correlation applies.

So Nu = 0.27 * (1.530e9)^(1/4).

Compute (1.530e9)^(1/4):

Take natural log: ln(1.530e9) = ln(1.53) + ln(1e9) = 0.425 + 20.723 = 21.148.

Divide by 4: 21.148 /4 ≈ 5.287, exponentiate: e^5.287 ≈ 195. So (1.530e9)^(1/4) ≈ 195.

So Nu ≈ 0.27 * 195 ≈ 52.65.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. Because 1.530e9 is 1,530,000,000.

What's the fourth root of 1.53e9? Let me think in terms of exponents. 1e9 is (10^9)^(1/4) = 10^(9/4) = 10^2.25 = about 177.8. So 1e9^(1/4)= 177.8. Now, 1.53e9 is 1.53 times that, so fourth root would be (1.53)^(1/4) times 177.8. (1.53)^(1/4) is approximately 1.107, so 1.107 * 177.8 ≈ 196.7. So yes, about 196.7.

So 0.27 * 196.7 ≈ 53.11.

So Nu ≈ 53.11.

Nu is defined as h * L / k, so h = Nu * k / L.

We have Nu=53.11, k is the thermal conductivity. Wait, earlier I thought k is about 0.042 W/m·K at this temperature. Let me confirm. At 423 K, k for air is approximately 0.042 W/m·K. So k=0.042 W/m·K.

L is 0.610 m.

So h = (53.11) * 0.042 / 0.610.

Compute numerator: 53.11 * 0.042 ≈ 2.2306.

Divide by 0.610: 2.2306 / 0.610 ≈ 3.656 W/m²·K.

So h ≈ 3.656 W/m²·K.

Now, compute the heat transfer rate Q. Since the wall is vertical, the area is height times width. The width is 1 ft, which is 0.3048 m. Wait, no, the question asks for heat transfer per foot of width, so the width is 1 ft (0.3048 m). The height is 2.0 ft (0.610 m). So area A = height * width = 0.610 m * 0.3048 m ≈ 0.186 m².

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the wall is 2.0 ft high, and 1 ft wide. So in SI units, that's 0.610 m high and 0.3048 m wide. So area A = 0.610 * 0.3048 ≈ 0.186 m².

Q = h * A * ΔT.

So Q = 3.656 W/m²·K * 0.186 m² * 201.1 K.

Compute step by step:

3.656 * 0.186 ≈ let's see: 3.656 * 0.2 is 0.7312, but since it's 0.186, which is 0.014 less than 0.2. So 3.656 * 0.014 = 0.051184. Subtract that from 0.7312: 0.7312 - 0.051184 = 0.680016.

So 3.656 * 0.186 ≈ 0.680 W/m²·K * m² → W·K^{-1} * K → W.

Wait, no, more accurately, the product is 3.656 * 0.186 = let me compute it properly.

3.656 * 0.186:

Multiply 3.656 by 0.1: 0.3656

Multiply by 0.08: 0.29248

Multiply by 0.006: 0.021936

Add them up: 0.3656 + 0.29248 = 0.65808 + 0.021936 = 0.680016.

So 3.656 * 0.186 ≈ 0.680.

Now multiply by ΔT=201.1 K: 0.680 * 201.1 ≈ 0.680 * 200 = 136, plus 0.680 * 1.1 ≈ 0.748, so total ≈ 136.748 W.

Wait, wait, but wait, that can't be right, because the options are like 80 W, 150 W, etc. Hmm, but I got around 136.7 W, which is about 137 W. But looking at the options, option D is 300 Btu/hr and 88 W. Option E is 500 Btu/hr and 150 W. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me double-check my steps.

First, h was calculated as 3.656 W/m²·K. Let me confirm that.

Nu was 53.11, k=0.042, L=0.610 m.

h = Nu * k / L = 53.11 * 0.042 / 0.610.

53.11 * 0.042 = let's compute that accurately. 53 * 0.042 is 2.226, plus 0.11 *0.042=0.00462, so total 2.226 + 0.00462=2.23062.

Divide by 0.610: 2.23062 / 0.610 ≈ 3.656 W/m²·K. That seems correct.

Area A is 0.610 m * 0.3048 m = 0.610 * 0.3048. Let me compute that: 0.61 * 0.3 is 0.183, 0.61 * 0.0048 is ~0.002928, so total ~0.1859 m².

So Q = h * A * ΔT = 3.656 * 0.1859 * 201.1.

Compute 3.656 * 0.1859 first.

3.656 * 0.1 = 0.3656

3.656 * 0.08 = 0.29248

3.656 * 0.0059 ≈ 0.02157

So adding up: 0.3656 + 0.29248 = 0.65808 + 0.02157 ≈ 0.67965.

So 3.656 * 0.1859 ≈ 0.67965.

Multiply by ΔT=201.1: 0.67965 * 200 = 135.93, plus 0.67965 *1.1≈0.7474, total≈136.68 W.

So approximately 137 W. But looking at the options, the closest SI value is 150 W (option E), 139 W (option I), or 132 W (option H). Wait, none of these exactly match 137.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Gr or Nu. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, I used the formula Nu = 0.27*(Gr*Pr)^(1/4). But I think another correlation might give a different exponent. Let me check another source in my mind. Oh wait, for vertical plates, the correlation is sometimes given as Nu = 0.59*(Gr*Pr)^(1/4) when Gr*Pr is between 1e5 and 1e11. Did I use the wrong coefficient?

Wait, if I used 0.59 instead of 0.27, that would make a big difference. So let me check that.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the correlations. For vertical plates, the correct correlation is Nu = 0.27*(Gr*Pr)^(1/4) for the range Gr*Pr between 1e4 and 1e9. But another source says for Gr between 1e8 and 1e12, the correlation is Nu = 0.55*(Gr*Pr)^(1/4). Wait, perhaps I used the wrong coefficient.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the correlation uses Gr^(1/4) times Pr^(1/3), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's Nu = 0.27 * (Gr^(0.25)) * (Pr^(0.25)).

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the more accurate Churchill and Chu correlation for natural convection from a vertical plate, which is:

Nu = ( (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) ) * [1 + (0.494/Pr)^(9/16) ) ]^(-7/27) )

Wait, I'm not sure
