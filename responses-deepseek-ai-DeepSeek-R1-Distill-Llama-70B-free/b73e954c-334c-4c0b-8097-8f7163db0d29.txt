Okay, so I have this economics question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about expansionary monetary policy in two different economies, X and Y. Economy X is an open economy with flexible exchange rates, while Economy Y is closed. The question is asking which economy the expansionary monetary policy is more effective in, ceteris paribus.

Hmm, I remember that expansionary monetary policy usually involves lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply. The goal is to stimulate economic activity. But how does this work in open versus closed economies?

In a closed economy, like Y, when the central bank implements an expansionary monetary policy, it lowers interest rates. This makes borrowing cheaper, so people and businesses are more likely to take loans and invest or consume more. That increases aggregate demand, which should boost output and employment. So in a closed economy, the effect is pretty straightforwardâ€”more spending domestically.

But in an open economy, like X, things are a bit different because of international trade and exchange rates. Flexible exchange rates mean that the exchange rate can change based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. So when Economy X lowers its interest rates, a couple of things happen.

First, lower interest rates might make the country's currency less attractive to foreign investors. Why? Because they can get higher returns elsewhere. So the demand for Economy X's currency might decrease, causing the exchange rate to depreciate. A depreciated currency makes exports cheaper for foreign buyers and imports more expensive. So net exports (exports minus imports) should increase because more exports are sold and fewer imports are bought.

Wait, but wait. So in an open economy, expansionary monetary policy can affect net exports positively. That adds another channel through which the policy can stimulate the economy. So in X, besides the usual increase in domestic spending, there's also an increase in net exports because the currency depreciates.

Comparing both, in the closed economy Y, the expansionary policy only affects domestic demand. But in the open economy X, it affects both domestic demand and net exports. So the policy should be more effective in X because it has an additional boost from increased net exports.

Let me think about the options again. The question is whether the expansionary policy is more effective in X or Y. The options are A to D.

Option A says it's more effective in X because the policy will increase net exports. That makes sense because the depreciation boosts exports. So A seems correct.

Option B says it's more effective in X but because net exports decrease. That doesn't sound right because I thought net exports would increase.

Option C says they are equally effective. But I don't think so because X has an extra effect through exports.

Option D says it's less effective in X because net exports decrease. That can't be right either because net exports should increase, making it more effective.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember something about the Mundell-Fleming model. In that model, for a small open economy with flexible exchange rates, expansionary monetary policy is more effective because the exchange rate adjusts, leading to increased net exports. So yes, that supports option A.

Alternatively, if an economy is large and open, the effects might differ, but the question doesn't specify that. So I think the correct answer is A.

In an open economy with flexible exchange rates, such as Economy X, an expansionary monetary policy not only lowers interest rates to stimulate domestic demand but also causes the currency to depreciate. This depreciation makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thereby increasing net exports. In a closed economy like Economy Y, the expansionary monetary policy only affects domestic demand without the additional boost from net exports. Therefore, the policy is more effective in Economy X due to the increase in net exports.

Option A correctly captures this reasoning, as it states that the policy is more effective in X because it increases net exports. Other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the effect on net exports or fail to account for the additional channel of influence in an open economy.

Answer: A
