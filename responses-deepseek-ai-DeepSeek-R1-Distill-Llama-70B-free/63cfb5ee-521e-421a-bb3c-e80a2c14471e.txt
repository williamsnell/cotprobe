Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about translating the English sentence "Some blue herons migrate" into predicate logic. I'm a bit new to this, so let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what each part of the sentence represents. The sentence is saying that there exists some herons that are blue and they migrate. So, "some" indicates that there is at least one such heron. 

In predicate logic, when we have "some" or "there exists," we use the existential quantifier, which is ∃. So the structure should start with ∃x, meaning there exists an x.

Now, breaking down the sentence into predicates. Let me assign each part:

- Blue heron: I think Hx would represent "x is a heron," Bx for "x is blue." So, blue heron would be Bx and Hx together. Wait, but how are they connected? Since it's a blue heron, it's an and statement—both conditions must be true. So, it's Bx • Hx.

- Migrate: Let's say Mx means "x migrates."

Putting it together, the sentence is saying there exists an x such that x is a blue heron and x migrates. So, combining these, the predicate would be (Hx • Bx) • Mx. But wait, logical AND is associative, so the order inside doesn't matter. So, it could be (Bx • Hx) • Mx, but I think the standard would group the subject first, so Hx and Bx first since it's a blue heron.

So, the structure would be ∃x (Hx • Bx • Mx). Wait, but in the options, I see some have implications. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) • Mx]

Option E: (∃x)[(Hx • Bx) ⊃ Mx]

Option F: (∃x)[(Bx • Hx) ⊃ Mx]

Option H: (∃x)[(Bx • Mx) ⊃ Hx]

Wait, so D uses a conjunction, while E and F use implications. But the original sentence doesn't say "if...then," it states that some herons are both blue and migrate. So, using an implication might not be correct here.

Wait, let's think again. The sentence is "Some blue herons migrate." So, it's not saying all, just some. So, in predicate logic, that would be there exists an x where x is a blue heron and x migrates. So, that's an AND between the two predicates.

Looking back, option D is ∃x[(Hx • Bx) • Mx]. That seems to fit because it's saying there exists an x that is a heron, blue, and migrates.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure. Option E is ∃x[(Hx • Bx) ⊃ Mx], which would mean there exists an x where if x is a heron and blue, then x migrates. But that's not the same as "some do," because the implication would be true even if there are no blue herons, which isn't the case here. The original statement requires that such herons exist and migrate.

Option F is similar but the implication is in a different order. It's (∃x)[(Bx • Hx) ⊃ Mx]. Again, same issue as E; it's an implication, not a conjunction.

So, the correct translation should use a conjunction, making option D the right choice. Let me double-check: the sentence says some blue herons do migrate, so we're stating the existence of such birds with both properties. So, yes, using ∃ with the conjunction of Hx, Bx, and Mx makes sense.

Wait, but in the options, D is written as (Hx • Bx) • Mx. Alternatively, sometimes the order doesn't matter because AND is commutative, but in this case, it's correctly grouped. So D should be correct.

The sentence "Some blue herons migrate" can be translated into predicate logic by breaking it into its components. The term "some" indicates the use of the existential quantifier (∃). The predicates are:

- \( Hx \): \( x \) is a heron.
- \( Bx \): \( x \) is blue.
- \( Mx \): \( x \) migrates.

The sentence asserts that there exists at least one \( x \) that is both a blue heron and migrates. This is best represented using a conjunction (\( \cdot \)) of the predicates \( Hx \), \( Bx \), and \( Mx \) under the existential quantifier. 

Option D, \( (\exists x)[(Hx \cdot Bx) \cdot Mx] \), correctly captures this meaning by stating that there exists an \( x \) such that \( x \) is a heron, \( x \) is blue, and \( x \) migrates. Other options involving implications (\( \supset \)) do not accurately represent the original statement, as they introduce conditional logic that is not present in the sentence.

Thus, the best translation is:

**D: \( (\exists x)[(Hx \cdot Bx) \cdot Mx] \)**

Answer: D
