Question:

A 37-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain. She describes the pain as 7 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 9 days, she has had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She does not smoke. Her husband and children have had no recent illness. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Examination shows congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. There is tenderness to palpation over the left cheek and no transillumination over the left maxillary sinus. The tympanic membranes are normal, and there is no erythema of the throat. Examination shows no cervical adenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?

Options:

A: Escherichia coli
B: Staphylococcus aureus
C: Haemophilus influenzae type b
D: Mycoplasma pneumoniae
E: Neisseria meningitidis
F: Streptococcus pyogenes
G: Pseudomonas aeruginosa
H: Bordetella pertussis
I: Moraxella catarrhalis
J: Streptococcus pneumoniae

Okay, so I have this question about a woman with facial pain and some other symptoms. I need to figure out the most likely causal organism. Let me read through the case again.

She's 37 years old and has a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain, rating it 7/10. For the past 9 days, she's had nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough. She doesn't smoke, and her family hasn't been sick. Her temp is 38.5°C, so she's got a fever. On exam, congested nasal mucosa and purulent discharge on the left. Tenderness over the left cheek, and no transillumination there. Normal tympanic membranes, no throat erythema, no cervical adenopathy, and clear lungs.

Hmm, so the symptoms point towards a sinus infection. The facial pain, especially over the cheek, which is the maxillary sinus area. The lack of transillumination suggests that the sinus is filled with something, like pus, which doesn't let light through. So probably acute sinusitis.

Now, considering the duration: she's had symptoms for about 9 days. Acute sinusitis is usually caused by bacteria when it lasts more than 10 days, but sometimes it's viral initially, and if it persists, then bacterial. But wait, she's had 9 days, so maybe it's moving into the bacterial phase. Or maybe it's a secondary bacterial infection after a viral upper respiratory infection.

The common bacteria causing acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options provided:

A: E. coli. That's more of a urinary tract pathogen, less likely here.

B: Staph aureus. More for skin or soft tissue infections, could be in some sinusitis cases but less common.

C: H. influenzae type b. Usually more in children, especially before vaccination. Adults can have H. influenzae, but type b is less common.

D: Mycoplasma. Causes atypical pneumonia, so maybe in her cough, but not typically for sinusitis.

E: Neisseria meningitidis. That's more for meningitis or septicemia, not sinusitis.

F: Streptococcus pyogenes. Causes strep throat, but her throat isn't red, so maybe not.

G: Pseudomonas. More for hospital-acquired infections or in cystic fibrosis patients, not the first thought here.

H: Bordetella pertussis. That's whooping cough, which she might have with the cough, but the main issue here is sinusitis.

I: Moraxella catarrhalis. Definitely a common cause of sinusitis, especially in adults.

J: Streptococcus pneumoniae. Also a very common cause.

So between I and J. Her age is 37, and she doesn't smoke, so probably not a lot of comorbidities. The symptoms are pointing towards maxillary sinusitis. Both Moraxella and Streptococcus pneumoniae are possibilities.

Wait, the initial illness was 9 days of congestion, discharge, etc. Viral upper respiratory infections often last about a week, and if they go beyond that, it's more likely a bacterial cause. So the facial pain starting on day 9 could be the bacterial sinusitis.

So the most likely organisms are the typical ones: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella.

Looking at the options, I have to choose between I and J.

In adults, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of acute bacterial sinusitis. Moraxella is also a common cause, but perhaps a bit less frequent than pneumococcus.

Wait, I think that in cases where the patient doesn't have any specific risk factors, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely. So I'm leaning towards J.

But wait, she's had symptoms for 9 days. Could that point more towards a different organism?

Alternatively, if this was a community-acquired sinusitis, the common causes are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. So all three are possible.

So, which one is more likely in this case?

Her symptoms started with a viral-like illness (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough) which makes me think of a viral upper respiratory infection that led to a secondary bacterial sinusitis.

In that case, the bacteria involved would be the typical ones.

I think Streptococcus pneumoniae is often the most common cause in adults, so option J.
</think>

The patient is a 37-year-old woman presenting with a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain, rated 7/10 in intensity, and a 9-day history of nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. She has a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F) and physical examination findings consistent with left maxillary sinusitis, including tenderness over the left cheek and lack of transillumination. These symptoms strongly suggest acute bacterial sinusitis, likely secondary to a viral upper respiratory infection.

The most common bacterial causes of acute sinusitis in adults are **Streptococcus pneumoniae**, **Haemophilus influenzae**, and **Moraxella catarrhalis**. Other options, such as **Escherichia coli**, **Staphylococcus aureus**, or **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**, are less likely in this context. **Mycoplasma pneumoniae** and **Bordetella pertussis** are more associated with respiratory infections rather than sinusitis. **Neisseria meningitidis** and **Streptococcus pyogenes** are less relevant here, as the clinical findings do not align with their typical presentations.

Between **Streptococcus pneumoniae** (option J) and **Moraxella catarrhalis** (option I), **Streptococcus pneumoniae** is the most frequent cause of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults without specific risk factors. The patient’s symptoms and lack of comorbidities further support this as the most likely organism.

**Answer: J**
