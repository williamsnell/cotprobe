Okay, so I have this question about alternators working in parallel and calculating the short circuit level at the busbar. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says there are four identical alternators. Each is rated for 20 MVA, 11 kV, and has a subtransient reactance of 16%. They're working in parallel, and I need to find the short circuit level at the busbar.

Wait, I remember that when alternators are connected in parallel, their reactances add in a certain way. Since they're identical, I can calculate the equivalent reactance for all four together.

Each alternator has a subtransient reactance of 16%, which I think is the percentage reactance on its own rating. So, for each, X = 16% of 20 MVA. But wait, how does reactance work when in parallel?

Oh right, for reactances in parallel, the equivalent reactance is the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals. But since they're all the same, it's simpler. If each has a reactance X, then four in parallel would have X_total = X / 4.

Wait, but I think the percentage reactance is given, so maybe I should calculate the equivalent percentage reactance first.

Alternatively, maybe the short circuit MVA is calculated using the individual reactances. I remember that the short circuit capacity can be found by the formula: MVA = (V^2) / (X), where X is the equivalent reactance.

But wait, each alternator has a certain MVA rating, so perhaps the approach is to find the equivalent reactance for all four in parallel and then compute the short circuit MVA.

Let me think again. The subtransient reactance for each is 16%, so X1 = 0.16 * 20 MVA. Wait, no, reactance is usually expressed in ohms, but in terms of per unit, it's 16% per unit reactance.

So each alternator's reactance X = 16% of its base impedance. The base impedance for each is V² / MVA. So base impedance Z_base = (11 kV)^2 / 20 MVA.

Wait, 11 kV is 11,000 volts. So Z_base = (11,000)^2 / 20,000,000. Let's compute that.

11,000 squared is 121,000,000. Divided by 20,000,000 gives 6.05 ohms. Then, the reactance X for each alternator is 16% of 6.05 ohms. 0.16 * 6.05 = approximately 0.968 ohms.

But since we have four alternators in parallel, the equivalent reactance X_total is X / 4. So 0.968 /4 ≈ 0.242 ohms.

Now, the short circuit MVA can be calculated using the formula: MVA = (V)^2 / (X_total). V is 11,000 volts.

So MVA = (11,000)^2 / 0.242.

11,000 squared is 121,000,000. Divided by 0.242 gives approximately 500,000,000 VA. Wait, that's 500 MVA.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 400 MVA, and option B is 800, and option D is 500. So according to this, the answer would be D: 500 MVA.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: The short circuit MVA for one alternator is given by its own MVA divided by the per unit reactance. Because MVA_short_circuit = MVA_rating / X_pu.

So each alternator's short circuit MVA would be 20 / 0.16 = 125 MVA. But wait, that seems low. But when you have four in parallel, their capacities add up.

So each can supply 125 MVA, so four would give 4 * 125 = 500 MVA. Oh, that's another way to get 500 MVA. So that confirms the earlier calculation.

So the correct answer should be D: 500 MVA.

To determine the short circuit level at the busbar for four identical alternators working in parallel, each rated for 20 MVA, 11 kV, with a subtransient reactance of 16%, the following steps are used:

1. **Short Circuit MVA for One Alternator**:  
   The short circuit MVA for a single alternator can be calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{MVA}_{\text{short circuit}} = \frac{\text{MVA}_{\text{rating}}}{\text{Per Unit Reactance}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{MVA}_{\text{short circuit}} = \frac{20}{0.16} = 125 \, \text{MVA}
   \]

2. **Short Circuit MVA for Four Alternators in Parallel**:  
   When alternators are connected in parallel, their short circuit capacities add. Therefore, for four alternators:  
   \[
   \text{Total Short Circuit MVA} = 4 \times 125 = 500 \, \text{MVA}
   \]

This calculation confirms that the short circuit level at the busbar is **500 MVA**.

From the given options:  
- **A: 600 MVA** — Incorrect  
- **B: 800 MVA** — Incorrect  
- **C: 125 MVA** — Incorrect (this is the short circuit MVA for one alternator)  
- **D: 500 MVA** — Correct  
- **E: 700 MVA** — Incorrect  
- **F: 300 MVA** — Incorrect  
- **G: 200 MVA** — Incorrect  
- **H: 400 MVA** — Incorrect  
- **I: 900 MVA** — Incorrect  
- **J: 100 MVA** — Incorrect  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: 500 MVA**
