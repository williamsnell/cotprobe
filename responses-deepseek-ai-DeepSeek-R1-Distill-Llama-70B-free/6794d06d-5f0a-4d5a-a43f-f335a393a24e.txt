Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises. Hmm. Let me start by breaking down the premises and seeing how they connect.

The premises are:
1. ~E ⊃ ~F
2. G ⊃ F
3. H ∨ ~E
4. H ⊃ I
5. ~I

I remember that in propositional logic (PL), an immediate consequence is something that can be derived in one step using the rules of inference, like modus ponens, modus tollens, disjunctive syllogism, etc. So I need to see which of the options can be directly inferred from these premises.

Let me list the options again to keep them in mind:
A: ~H ⊃ I
B: G ⊃ ~F
C: H ⊃ ~E
D: I ⊃ H
E: ~H
F: H ⊃ F
G: ~G
H: F ⊃ ~E
I: E ⊃ F
J: F ⊃ G

Alright, let's tackle each premise and see what conclusions we can draw.

Starting with premise 5: ~I. This is the negation of I. Now, premise 4 is H ⊃ I. If we have ~I, then by modus tollens applied to H ⊃ I, we can conclude ~H. Because if I is not true, then H cannot be true because H would imply I. So from 4 and 5, we get ~H. So ~H is a conclusion. Looking at the options, option E is ~H. So that's a possibility.

But wait, let's not jump to conclusions. Let me check all premises to make sure I'm not missing something.

Premise 3 is H ∨ ~E. We've just derived ~H from premises 4 and 5. So if we have H ∨ ~E and ~H, we can use disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism says that if we have A ∨ B and ~A, then we can conclude B. So applying that here, since we have H ∨ ~E and ~H, we can conclude ~E. So from premises 3,4,5, we get ~E.

Now, with ~E, let's look at premise 1: ~E ⊃ ~F. Since ~E is true, by modus ponens, ~F must be true. So we can conclude ~F.

So now we have ~F. Let's look at premise 2: G ⊃ F. If G implies F, and we know ~F, then by modus tollens, we can conclude ~G. Because if G were true, F would have to be true, but F isn't, so G can't be true. So ~G is another conclusion. Looking at the options, option G is ~G.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The question is about which is an immediate consequence, so one step. So the conclusions I've reached so far are ~H, ~E, ~F, and ~G.

Looking at the options, E is ~H, and G is ~G. So both E and G are possible.

Wait, but the question is which is an immediate consequence. So I need to see which of these can be derived directly, in one step, from the premises. Let's see.

From premises 4 (H⊃I) and 5 (~I), using modus tollens, we immediately get ~H. So that's one step. So option E is correct.

Alternatively, from premises 3 (H∨~E) and ~H, using disjunctive syllogism, we get ~E. That's another step, but it's two steps from the premises. So perhaps ~E is a consequence, but not immediate.

Wait, but the question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence. So which of the options can be derived in one step.

Looking at option E: ~H. That's derived directly from 4 and 5 in one step. So E is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option C is H⊃~E. Hmm. Let me see. From H⊃I (premise4) and ~I (premise5), we have ~H. But how do we get H⊃~E?

Wait, maybe from H∨~E (premise3) and ~H, we get ~E via disjunctive syllogism. But that's two steps: first getting ~H, then using it with premise3 to get ~E. So that's two steps. But H⊃~E would be equivalent to ~H ∨ ~E, which is premise3. So H⊃~E is actually premise3 itself. So option C is just premise3 written in a different form. So it's not a new conclusion, just a restatement. So that's not a consequence, it's a premise.

Option B: G⊃~F. Let's see. From premise2: G⊃F. If we have that, can we get G⊃~F? Well, that would require that F and ~F are both implied by G, which would mean G is impossible, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps from ~F, we can infer that G implies ~F? No, that doesn't follow directly. Because G⊃F is premise2, and from ~F, we get ~G via modus tollens. So from G⊃F and ~F, we get ~G. But G⊃~F isn't directly derivable. So option B is incorrect.

Option F: H⊃F. Hmm. Is there a way to get H⊃F? Let's see. From premise4: H⊃I, and premise5: ~I, we have ~H. So H is false. In classical logic, a conditional with a false antecedent is always true. So H⊃F is true because H is false. Wait, but that's a bit of a tricky point. Because H is false, H⊃anything is true. So H⊃F is a tautology in this case. But is that an immediate consequence from the premises?

Wait, but in the context of the premises, H is false because ~H is derived. So H⊃F is indeed true, but is that considered an immediate consequence? Or is it more of a logical truth given the premises? I'm not sure. But I think that might not be the intended answer because it's more about the logical consequence rather than a direct inference step.

Option I: E⊃F. Let's see. From premise1: ~E⊃~F. The contrapositive of that is F⊃E. So if F is true, then E is true. But E⊃F isn't directly given. So I don't think that's an immediate consequence.

Option J: F⊃G. From premise2: G⊃F. The contrapositive would be ~F⊃~G, which we have as ~F leading to ~G. But F⊃G is not directly derivable from the premises. Because G implies F, but F doesn't necessarily imply G unless it's a biconditional.

Option D: I⊃H. From premise4: H⊃I. The contrapositive would be ~I⊃~H, which we have. But I⊃H isn't directly derivable. Because if I were true, H would have to be true, but we don't have any premise that connects I to H in that direction except H⊃I, which doesn't give us I⊃H.

Option A: ~H⊃I. Well, from premise4: H⊃I, the contrapositive is ~I⊃~H, which we've used. But ~H doesn't necessarily imply I. Because ~H is true, but I's negation is given. Wait, with ~I, and H⊃I, we have ~H, but ~H doesn't imply I. Because I is false. So ~H⊃I would be "if not H then I", but since I is false, this would only be true if ~H is also false, but ~H is true. So ~H⊃I would be false, because when ~H is true and I is false, the implication is false. So option A is incorrect.

Option H: F⊃~E. From premise1: ~E⊃~F, the contrapositive is F⊃E. So F implies E, not ~E. So F⊃~E would be incorrect; in fact, it's the opposite of the contrapositive. So H is incorrect.

So, going back, the immediate consequences I can derive in one step are:

From 4 and 5: ~H (option E).

From 3,4,5: ~E (but that's two steps, so not immediate).

From 1 and ~E: ~F (two steps).

From 2 and ~F: ~G (three steps).

So the only immediate consequence from the premises is ~H, which is option E.

The question asks which proposition is an immediate (one-step) consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. \( \neg E \supset \neg F \)
2. \( G \supset F \)
3. \( H \lor \neg E \)
4. \( H \supset I \)
5. \( \neg I \)

To determine the immediate consequence, we analyze the premises and apply rules of inference like modus ponens, modus tollens, and disjunctive syllogism.

### Analysis:
- From premise 4 (\( H \supset I \)) and premise 5 (\( \neg I \)), we apply **modus tollens**. This directly gives \( \neg H \). Thus, \( \neg H \) is an immediate consequence.
- Other options are evaluated:
  - **Option C (\( H \supset \neg E \))**: This is equivalent to premise 3 (\( H \lor \neg E \)) and is not a new conclusion.
  - **Option B (\( G \supset \neg F \))**: This cannot be derived directly from the premises. From premise 2 (\( G \supset F \)) and \( \neg F \), we derive \( \neg G \) (modus tollens), but not \( G \supset \neg F \).
  - **Option E (\( \neg H \))**: As shown above, \( \neg H \) is directly derived from premises 4 and 5 in one step.
  - **Option G (\( \neg G \))**: This is derived from premises 2 (\( G \supset F \)) and \( \neg F \) (derived from \( \neg E \) and premise 1), but it requires multiple steps and is not immediate.
  - Other options (A, D, F, H, I, J) are either incorrect or not directly derivable in one step.

### Conclusion:
The only proposition that is an immediate (one-step) consequence of the premises is \( \neg H \), which corresponds to **option E**.
