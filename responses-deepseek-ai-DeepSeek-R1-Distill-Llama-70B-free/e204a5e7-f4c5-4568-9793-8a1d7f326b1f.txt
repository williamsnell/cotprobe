Okay, so I've got this question about property law, specifically dealing with future interests. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The scenario is about a grantor who conveyed an apartment building. The conveyance is done via a deed, and the consideration is a dollar, which is probably just a nominal amount. The key part is the language of the conveyance. Let's parse that out.

The grant is "to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my brother if my uncle does move to another state."

Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's map this out.

First, the son gets a life estate. So, son has a life estate. Then, after the son's life, it goes to the uncle for life. So, the uncle has a vested remainder—it's a remainder because it's after the son's estate, and it's for life. Now, but there's a condition: if the uncle moves to another state, instead of the uncle, it goes to the brother for the life of the uncle. Wait, so does that mean the uncle's interest is subject to a condition subsequent, or is it a condition precedent?

Wait, the initial grant is to the uncle for life, but if the uncle moves, then it goes to the brother. So the brother's interest is contingent upon the uncle moving. So the uncle's interest is a vested remainder subject to defeasance if he moves.

But then after that, it goes to the heirs of the uncle if he doesn't move, or to the heirs of the brother if he does move. So, after the uncle's life (or brother's life, depending on the condition), there's a transfer to the heirs.

Wait, so the grant is structured as:

1. Son has a life estate.
2. Uncle has a remainder for life, but if he moves out of state, brother gets a life estate measured by the uncle's life.
3. After the uncle's life (or the brother's life, depending on condition), it goes to the heirs of uncle or brother, respectively.

So, after the son's life, the uncle has a vested remainder for life, but it's subject to a condition subsequent (the uncle moving), which would shift the interest to the brother for the uncle's life. So the brother's interest is a kind of springing interest, I think—it's an executory interest because it divests the prior estate (the uncle's) upon a condition.

Wait, but what's the brother's interest exactly? Let's think about the sequence.

After the son's life, the uncle is to have a life estate. But if the uncle moves, then the brother gets a life estate for the uncle's life. So the brother's interest is contingent upon the uncle moving. So that's a contingent interest because it's subject to a condition.

So, the brother's interest is a contingent remainder because it's a future interest that's subject to a condition precedent (the uncle moving). But wait, the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. The grant says "if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle." So the brother's life estate is contingent on the uncle moving.

But what happens after that? After the brother's life estate, does the property go to someone else? The grant says, after the uncle's life (or brother's, depending on the condition), it goes to the heirs of uncle or brother respectively.

Wait, perhaps I should diagram this:

- Son: life estate.
- Uncle: vested remainder for life, but subject to executory limitation (if he moves, it goes to brother for uncle's life).
- If uncle doesn't move: after uncle's death, to uncle's heirs (so fee simple absolute? Or a remainder in fee?).
- If uncle does move: brother has a life estate (measuring by uncle's life), and after brother's life estate, to brother's heirs.

Wait, so the interest after the life estates—it goes to the heirs, which would be their estates in fee simple, I assume.

So, the issue is about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime. What is the brother's interest called, and what type of future interest is it?

So, during the son's lifetime, the son has a life estate. The uncle has a vested remainder in a life estate, but it's subject to a condition subsequent (moving), which would divest his interest and give it to the brother for the uncle's life. So the brother's interest is a type of executory interest because it's an interest that cuts short another's estate upon a condition.

Wait, but executory interests are typically interests that take effect after a prior estate is divested. So if the uncle's estate is divested upon moving, the brother gets it. So the brother has an executory interest that is contingent upon the uncle moving.

But wait, the brother's interest is a life estate, but it's measured by the uncle's life. So the brother's interest is a life estate pur autre vie (since it's measured by someone else's life, the uncle's). But it's also subject to a condition precedent (the uncle moving), so it's a contingent interest.

So, the brother's future interest is a contingent executory interest. Because it's an executory interest (it takes effect by cutting short another's estate) and it's contingent upon the condition (uncle moving).

Wait, but executory interests can be either vested or contingent. Since the condition here is a contingency (whether the uncle moves), it's a contingent executory interest.

So, the question is asking about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime. So, during the son's life, the son has the present estate, and then the future interests are:

- Uncle has a vested remainder subject to executory limitation (if he moves, to brother for uncle's life).
- Brother has a contingent executory interest: he gets a life estate if the uncle moves.

But wait, the options don't all match this. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: contingent remainder pur autre vie.

B: vested remainder absolute.

C: estate pur autre vie.

D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

E: vested remainder pur autre vie.

F: contingent remainder in fee simple.

G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

H: vested remainder in fee simple.

I: vested executory interest pur autre vie.

J: contingent remainder absolute.

So, the brother's interest is a contingent executory interest, and it's pur autre vie because it's a life estate measured by the uncle's life.

Looking at the options, option G is "contingent executory interest pur autre vie."

Wait, but wait, the brother's interest is a life estate pur autre vie (since it's for the uncle's life), and it's contingent. So, the future interest is a contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

So the correct answer would be G.

But wait, let me make sure. Let's think about what each term means.

A contingent remainder is a remainder that is subject to a condition precedent, but it's a remainder following a particular estate. However, in this case, the brother's interest is not a remainder; it's an executory interest because it's cutting short the uncle's vested remainder.

So, a remainder takes effect automatically upon the termination of the prior estate, while an executory interest takes effect upon a condition that may or may not happen, which divests the prior estate.

So, the brother's interest is an executory interest, not a remainder. So, that rules out options A, E, F, J.

So, among the executory options, D, G, I.

Option D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

Shifting executory interests can be a bit ambiguous, but I think that refers to when the interest shifts from one person to another upon a condition. But in this case, it's more that upon the condition, the interest to the brother is created, so it's a springing executory interest.

But G is contingent executory interest pur autre vie. The brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving, so it's a contingent executory interest, and the interest is a life estate pur autre vie.

So, G would fit.

Wait, but I should also consider whether the brother's interest is a remainder or executory. Since the uncle's interest is a vested remainder, but upon the condition (moving), the brother's interest takes effect. So, the brother's interest is an executory interest because it's taking the place of the uncle's remainder upon a condition.

So, the brother's interest is a contingent executory interest pur autre vie. So, option G.

Alternatively, option D says shifting executory interest pur autre vie. Shifting executory interests typically involve a shift from one alternative to another. For example, "to A, but if A dies before me, to B." So, the interest shifts from A to B upon A's death. In this case, it's shifting from the uncle's interest to the brother's upon the uncle moving. So, perhaps D could be applicable.

Wait, but the terminology can be a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Another approach: the brother's interest is an executory interest because it's an interest that takes effect by cutting short the uncle's estate upon a condition. It's contingent because the condition might not occur. The interest the brother would receive is a life estate measured by the uncle's life, so pur autre vie.

So, the brother's interest is a contingent executory interest pur autre vie. So, option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between G and D.

Shifting executory interest versus contingent executory interest.

Shifting executory interests are when the executory interest shifts between two people upon a condition. For example, "to A, then to B, but if B remarries, to C." So, the interest shifts from B to C upon B's remarriage.

In this case, the executory interest is shifting from the uncle to the brother upon the uncle moving. So, perhaps it's a shifting executory interest.

But the brother's interest is contingent on the condition. So, perhaps it's both contingent and shifting.

Wait, but the options are:

D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

So, the brother's interest is contingent because it depends on the uncle moving, and it's an executory interest because it's taking the place of the uncle's vested remainder.

So, the correct classification would be a contingent executory interest pur autre vie, which is option G.

Therefore, the answer should be G.
</think>

The grantor conveyed an apartment building with the following language: "to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my brother if my uncle does move to another state." The question asks about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime.

1. **Son's Interest**: The son has a life estate, which is the present estate.
2. **Uncle's Interest**: The uncle has a vested remainder for life, but it is subject to a condition subsequent (if the uncle moves to another state). This means the uncle's interest can be divested.
3. **Brother's Interest**: If the uncle moves to another state, the brother receives a life estate measured by the uncle's life. This interest is contingent upon the condition of the uncle moving and is an executory interest because it takes effect by divesting the uncle's vested remainder.

The brother's interest is therefore a **contingent executory interest pur autre vie** because:
- It is contingent upon the uncle moving to another state.
- It is an executory interest because it divests the uncle's vested remainder upon the condition being met.
- It is pur autre vie because the brother's life estate is measured by the uncle's life.

Among the options provided:
- **Option G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie** accurately describes the brother's interest.
