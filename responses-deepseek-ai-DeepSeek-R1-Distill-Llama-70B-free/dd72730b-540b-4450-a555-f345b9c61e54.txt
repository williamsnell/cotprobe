Okay, so I have this economics question here about aggregate supply curves. Hmm, I need to figure out which option does NOT shift the aggregate supply curve. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Aggregate supply refers to the total production of goods and services in an economy. The curve can shift due to various factors. I recall that factors like changes in resource prices, technology, government policies, and expectations can cause shifts. But wait, what about the price level itself?

Wait a second, the aggregate supply curve is usually plotted with the price level on the vertical axis. So when the price level changes, that's a movement along the curve, not a shift. Like, if prices rise, businesses might supply more, moving along the curve. But a shift would happen if something changes that affects the cost of production or the willingness to produce at a given price level.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Decrease in government regulation. That probably makes production easier, so AS should increase (shift right). So A does shift AS.

Option B: Increase in the price level. Oh, wait, that's just a movement along the curve, not a shift. So B might be the answer because it doesn't shift the curve.

Option C: Decrease in resources. That would reduce production capacity, shifting AS to the left. So C shifts AS.

Option D: Decrease in technology. Worse tech means less efficient production, so AS would shift left. D causes a shift.

Option E: Increase in business investment. More investment usually means better technology or more resources, so AS increases (shift right). E shifts.

Option F: Increase in technology. That's a clear shift to the right. F shifts.

Option G: Increase in resources. More resources mean more production, so AS shifts right. G shifts.

So all options except B affect factors that shift the AS curve. Option B is about the price level, which is on the axis, so it's a movement, not a shift. Therefore, the answer should be option B.

The aggregate supply curve shifts in response to changes in factors that affect production costs or the willingness to produce, such as resource prices, technology, government policies, and expectations. However, an increase in the price level does not shift the curve; instead, it represents a movement along the curve. 

- **Option A**: A decrease in government regulation would reduce production costs, shifting the curve right.  
- **Option B**: An increase in the price level is a movement along the curve, not a shift.  
- **Option C**: A decrease in resources would reduce production capacity, shifting the curve left.  
- **Option D**: A decrease in technology would reduce efficiency, shifting the curve left.  
- **Option E**: An increase in business investment would enhance production capabilities, shifting the curve right.  
- **Option F**: An increase in technology would improve efficiency, shifting the curve right.  
- **Option G**: An increase in resources would expand production capacity, shifting the curve right.  

The only option that does NOT shift the aggregate supply curve is **Option B**.  

Answer: B
