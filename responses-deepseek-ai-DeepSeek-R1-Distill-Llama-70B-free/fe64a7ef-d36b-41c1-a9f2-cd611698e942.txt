Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the minimum radius of a planet that has retained oxygen in its atmosphere. The given parameters are the mean density of the planet, which is 5500 kg/m³, and the temperature is 400°C. So I need to figure out the minimum radius required for a planet to hold onto oxygen.

Hmm, I remember that whether a planet can retain an atmosphere depends on factors like its gravity and the temperature. Oxygen is a molecule, so its retention is linked to the planet's escape velocity and the thermal motion of the oxygen molecules.

I think the key here is the concept of the escape velocity. For a gas to be retained in a planet's atmosphere, the escape velocity from the planet's surface must be much higher than the thermal velocity of the gas molecules. Otherwise, the molecules will escape into space over time.

Wait, but wait, I also remember something about the escape velocity being related to the planet's mass and radius. The formula for escape velocity (v_esc) is sqrt(2GM/R), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is its radius.

But the planet's mass can be expressed in terms of its density (rho) and radius. Since density rho is mass per volume, mass M = rho * (4/3)πR³. So substituting that into the escape velocity formula, we get v_esc = sqrt(2G*(rho*(4/3)πR³)/R) ) which simplifies to sqrt( (8/3) G π rho R² ). So v_esc is proportional to sqrt(R), because rho is given as a constant here.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the condition for gas retention in terms of the escape velocity being much larger than the root mean square (rms) velocity of the gas molecules. The rms velocity of a gas is given by v_rms = sqrt(3kT/m), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and m is the molar mass of the gas.

Wait, but wait, the exact condition is that the escape velocity should be greater than the rms velocity of the gas molecules. But I think the actual criterion is that the escape velocity is at least several times (like 6 or more) the rms velocity. I'm not exactly sure about the exact multiple, but I think it's about 6 times. So when v_esc >= 6*v_rms, the gas is retained.

Alternatively, I've heard that the escape velocity should be greater than the rms velocity by a factor of sqrt(2) or something. Wait, maybe I should double-check that. Oh wait, the exact condition for a gas to be retained is that the thermal speed is much less than the escape velocity. So perhaps the condition is v_esc > v_rms, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factor. Maybe the problem expects me to use a specific ratio, like v_esc = 6*v_rms or something like that.

Wait, but perhaps a more precise approach is to look at the kinetic theory and the Jeans escape formula, but that might be too complicated for this problem. Alternatively, the problem might assume a simplified condition where the escape velocity is just greater than the rms velocity, but I'm not certain.

So let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the rms velocity of oxygen at 400°C.
2. Relate this to the escape velocity of the planet.
3. Express the escape velocity in terms of the planet's radius and density.
4. Solve for the minimum radius required where v_esc >= some multiple of v_rms (maybe 6 times?).

Let's proceed step by step.

First, the rms velocity formula is v_rms = sqrt(3kT/m), where:
- k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.
- T is the temperature in Kelvin.
- m is the mass of an oxygen molecule.

Wait, oxygen has a molar mass of 32 g/mol. So the mass of one O2 molecule is (32 g/mol) / (Avogadro's number). Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 mol⁻¹. So m = (0.032 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 mol⁻¹) = 5.314e-26 kg.

Wait, wait, no: 32 g/mol is 0.032 kg/mol. So m = 0.032 kg/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol = 5.314e-26 kg per molecule.

The temperature given is 400°C, which is 400 + 273.15 = 673.15 K.

So plugging into v_rms:

v_rms = sqrt(3 * 1.380649e-23 J/K * 673.15 K / 5.314e-26 kg)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the numerator inside the square root: 3 * 1.380649e-23 * 673.15.

3 * 1.380649e-23 = 4.141947e-23
Multiply by 673.15: 4.141947e-23 * 673.15 ≈ 2.79e-20 (since 4.141947e-23 * 6.7e2 ≈ 4.141947e-23 * 6.7e2 = 4.141947 * 6.7 = approx 27.75, so 27.75e-21 = 2.775e-20).

Then, divide by m: 5.314e-26 kg.

So 2.79e-20 / 5.314e-26 ≈ (2.79 / 5.314) * 1e6 ≈ 0.525 * 1e6 ≈ 5.25e5.

Then take the square root: sqrt(5.25e5) ≈ 724.5 m/s.

So v_rms ≈ 724.5 m/s.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it using exact numbers.

Compute numerator: 3kT = 3 * 1.380649e-23 * 673.15.

3 * 1.380649e-23 = 4.141947e-23

4.141947e-23 * 673.15 = ?

Let me compute 4.141947e-23 * 673.15:

4.141947e-23 * 6.7315e2 = 4.141947 * 6.7315 = approximately let's see:

4 * 6.7 is 26.8, 0.141947 *6.7 ≈ 0.951, so total ≈ 27.75, so 27.75e-21 = 2.775e-20.

Wait, but more accurately: 4.141947 * 673.15 = 4.141947 * 600 = 2485.1682, 4.141947 *73.15 = let's compute 4.141947 *70=290, 4.141947 *3.15≈13.06. So total ≈ 2485 + 290 +13.06 = 2788.23. So 4.141947e-23 * 673.15e0 = 2788.23e-23 = 2.78823e-20.

Then, divide by m: 5.314e-26 kg.

2.78823e-20 / 5.314e-26 = (2.78823 / 5.314) * 1e6.

Calculating 2.78823 / 5.314: let's see, 5.314 * 0.525 = approx 2.788, so 2.78823/5.314 ≈ 0.525.

So 0.525 * 1e6 = 5.25e5.

So sqrt(5.25e5) = sqrt(525,000) ≈ 724.5 m/s.

So v_rms ≈ 724.5 m/s.

Now, the escape velocity v_esc must be greater than this, but by how much? I'm a bit confused here. I've heard that the escape velocity should be at least 6 times the rms velocity for the gas to be retained. Alternatively, some sources say that the escape velocity should be greater than sqrt(2) times the rms, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think. The rms velocity is the root mean square of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The escape velocity is the speed needed to break free from the planet's gravity without additional propulsion.

The condition for a gas to be retained is that the thermal speed (like the rms) is much less than the escape velocity. If v_esc is much larger than v_rms, then most gas molecules won't have enough speed to escape.

But what's the exact condition? I think that the commonly used approximation is that if v_esc > 6*v_rms, then the gas is retained. Alternatively, sometimes the condition is v_esc > v_rms * sqrt(2), but that might be a different context.

Wait, another approach: The Jeans escape theory gives the escape flux, which depends on the ratio of thermal velocity to escape velocity. The flux is significant when the escape velocity is only a few times the thermal speed. So to have negligible escape, the escape velocity should be several times the thermal speed. I think the factor used is 6, but I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, if I look it up in my notes, I remember that the escape velocity should be greater than about 6 times the average (rms) speed of the gas molecules for the planet to retain the atmosphere. So I'll go with that.

So the condition is v_esc >= 6*v_rms.

So v_esc = 6 * 724.5 m/s ≈ 4347 m/s.

Wait, that would be 6 times. But I'm not entirely sure if it's 6 or another factor. Alternatively, I think sometimes the factor is sqrt(2) or something else, but I'm going to go with 6 for this problem.

Now, the escape velocity from a planet is given by v_esc = sqrt(2 G M / R).

But since we have the mean density (rho) of the planet, we can express M in terms of rho and R. The mass M is (4/3) π R^3 * rho.

So substituting into the escape velocity formula:

v_esc = sqrt(2 G * (4/3 π rho R^3) / R) )

Simplify:

= sqrt(2 G (4/3 π rho R^2) )

= sqrt( (8/3) π G rho R² )

= R * sqrt( (8/3) π G rho )

So, v_esc is proportional to R times sqrt(rho), since G and pi are constants.

Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly.

Yes, because:

v_esc = sqrt( (8/3) π G rho R² ) = R * sqrt( (8/3) π G rho )

So, if I solve for R, given v_esc, I can rearrange:

R = v_esc / sqrt( (8/3) π G rho )

Now, I can plug in the numbers.

Given that v_esc is 4347 m/s (since 6 * 724.5 ≈ 4347).

Wait, let me compute 6 * 724.5: 700*6=4200, 24.5*6=147, so 4200+147=4347 m/s.

So R = 4347 / sqrt( (8/3) * π * G * rho )

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, compute (8/3) * π * G * rho.

G is 6.6743e-11 N·m²/kg².

So,

(8/3) * π ≈ 8.37758.

Multiply by G: 8.37758 * 6.6743e-11 ≈ let's compute that.

8.37758 * 6.6743 ≈ 8.37758 * 6 = 50.265, 8.37758 * 0.6743 ≈ 5.651. So total ≈ 55.916, so 55.916e-11.

Wait, no: 8.37758 * 6.6743e-11 = (8.37758 * 6.6743) * 1e-11.

8.37758 * 6.6743 = Let me compute that more accurately.

6 * 8.37758 = 50.26548.

0.6743 * 8.37758 ≈ let's compute 0.6 * 8.37758 = 5.02655, 0.0743 * 8.37758 ≈ 0.6225. So total ≈ 5.02655 + 0.6225 = 5.64905. So 50.26548 + 5.64905 ≈ 55.9145.

So 55.9145e-11.

Now, multiply by rho, which is 5500 kg/m³.

55.9145e-11 * 5500 = 55.9145 * 5500 * 1e-11.

55.9145 * 5500 = let's compute 55 * 5500 = 302,500, and 0.9145 * 5500 ≈ 5032.75. So total ≈ 302500 + 5032.75 = 307,532.75.

So 307,532.75e-11 = 3.0753275e-05.

Wait, 307,532.75e-11 = 3.0753275e5 * 1e-11 = 3.0753275e-6.

Wait, no: 307,532.75e-11 = 3.0753275e5 * 1e-11 = 3.0753275e-6.

Wait, 1e5 *1e-11 = 1e-6, so 3.075e5 *1e-11 = 3.075e-6.

So, the denominator inside the sqrt is 3.075e-6.

So sqrt(3.075e-6) = let's compute that.

First, 3.075e-6 = 3.075 * 1e-6.

So sqrt(3.075) is approx 1.754, and sqrt(1e-6) is 1e-3.

So sqrt(3.075e-6) ≈ 1.754e-3 m/s²? Wait, no, no units here. It's part of the calculation for R.

Wait, no, the units in the denominator: let me think. The expression under the square root is (8/3) π G rho, which has units of m³/(kg s²) * kg/m³ = m³/(s²). So sqrt of that is (m³/s²)^(1/2) = m^(3/2)/s. Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting confused with the units. Anyway, proceeding numerically.

So sqrt(3.075e-6) ≈ 1.754e-3.

So R = 4347 m/s / 1.754e-3 s^-1 (since it's m^(3/2) etc., but perhaps I should just proceed numerically.)

Wait, 4347 divided by 0.001754 is 4347 / 0.001754.

Wait, 4347 / 0.001754 = 4347 * (1 / 0.001754) = 4347 * 570.58 approximately.

Wait, let me compute 1 / 0.001754.

0.001754 = 1.754e-3, so 1 / 1.754e-3 ≈ 570.58.

So 4347 * 570.58 ≈ let's compute 4000 * 570 = 2,280,000, 347 * 570 ≈ 197,  so total ≈ 2,280,000 + 197,  so 2,277,000.

Wait, more accurately:

4347 * 570.58:

Compute 4000 * 570.58 = 2,282,320.

347 * 570.58 = Let's compute 300*570.58=171,174, 47*570.58≈26,827. So 171,174 +26,827≈198,001.

So total R ≈ 2,282,320 + 198,001 ≈ 2,480,321 meters.

Wait, 2,480,321 meters is 2,480 km.

Wait, but that's way bigger than any of the options given. The options are in the hundreds of km. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, the units: Did I make a mistake in the units when computing (8/3) π G rho?

Wait, let me recompute (8/3) π G rho.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³/(kg·s²).

So (8/3) π G rho:

(8/3) * π ≈ 8.37758.

Multiply by G: 8.37758 * 6.6743e-11 = let me compute this precisely.

8.37758 * 6.6743e-11:

8 * 6.6743e-11 = 5.33944e-10.

0.37758 * 6.6743e-11 ≈ 0.37758 * 6.6743 ≈ 2.518, so 2.518e-11.

So total is approx 5.33944e-10 + 2.518e-11 = 5.59124e-10 m³/(s²·kg) * kg/m³.

Wait, no: G is in m³/(kg·s²), and rho is kg/m³.

So when I multiply G by rho, the units become (m³/(kg·s²)) * (kg/m³) )= 1/(s²).

So the entire term (8/3) π G rho has units of 1/s².

So sqrt( (8/3) π G rho ) has units of 1/s.

Wait, so when I compute R as 4347 m/s divided by (some value in 1/s), the units would be m/s divided by 1/s = m·s⁻¹ / s⁻¹ = m. So that makes sense.

But let me make sure the numerical calculation is correct.

Wait, I think I made a mistake when calculating (8/3
