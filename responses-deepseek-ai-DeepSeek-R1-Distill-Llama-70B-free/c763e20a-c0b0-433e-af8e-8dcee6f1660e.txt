Okay, so I need to find the gravitational field at the surface of Mars. Hmm, I remember that the gravitational field strength, also called the acceleration due to gravity, is calculated using the formula g = (G*M)/r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is its radius.

Wait, the question gives me the radius of Mars as about half of Earth's and its mass as one-tenth of Earth's. So, I should compare Mars' gravity to Earth's, right? Because knowing Earth's gravity is 9.8 N/kg, I can use that as a reference.

Let's break it down. Earth's gravity is g_earth = (G*M_earth)/(r_earth)². For Mars, it's g_mars = (G*M_mars)/(r_mars)².

Since M_mars is (1/10) M_earth and r_mars is (1/2) r_earth, substituting these into the formula would give g_mars = (G*(M_earth/10)) / ( (r_earth/2) )².

Simplifying the denominator: (r_earth/2) squared is r_earth² /4. So the equation becomes g_mars = (G*M_earth/10) / (r_earth²/4).

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so (G*M_earth/10) * (4/r_earth²) = (4/10) * (G*M_earth/r_earth²) ) = 0.4 * g_earth.

Oh wait, because g_earth is (G*M_earth)/(r_earth²). So 0.4 times Earth's gravity. Earth's is about 9.8 N/kg, so 0.4 * 9.8 is... let's calculate that. 0.4 * 10 is 4, but since it's 9.8, which is 0.2 less than 10. So 0.4 * 9.8 = 3.92. Approximately 4 N/kg?

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4 N/kg. But wait, I thought Mars' gravity is actually around 3.7 something. Maybe my approximation is a bit off. Let me think again. Oh, the question says 'closest to', so 3.92 is closer to 4 than to 3, which isn't an option here.

Looking at the options, the options are A:0.5, B:1, C:2, D:4, E:12, F:0.1, G:8, H:10, I:6, J:0.2. So the closest is D:4 N/kg.

Wait, but another thought: maybe I should remember that the actual value is about 3.71 m/s², which is about 3.7 N/kg. Hmm, but the options don't have 3.7. So 4 is the closest given the choices. So the answer must be D.

To determine the gravitational field at the surface of Mars, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration:

\[
g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the planet, and \( r \) is its radius. The problem states that Mars' radius is approximately half of Earth's (\( r_{\text{Mars}} = \frac{1}{2} r_{\text{Earth}} \)) and its mass is about one-tenth of Earth's (\( M_{\text{Mars}} = \frac{1}{10} M_{\text{Earth}} \)).

Substituting these values into the formula, the gravitational acceleration on Mars becomes:

\[
g_{\text{Mars}} = \frac{G \cdot \frac{1}{10} M_{\text{Earth}}}{\left(\frac{1}{2} r_{\text{Earth}}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{10} G \cdot M_{\text{Earth}}}{\frac{1}{4} r_{\text{Earth}}^2} = \frac{4}{10} \cdot \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{Earth}}}{r_{\text{Earth}}^2} = 0.4 \cdot g_{\text{Earth}}
\]

Earth's gravitational acceleration is approximately \( g_{\text{Earth}} = 9.8 \, \text{N/kg} \). Thus:

\[
g_{\text{Mars}} = 0.4 \cdot 9.8 = 3.92 \, \text{N/kg}
\]

This value is closest to \( 4 \, \text{N/kg} \) among the given options. While the actual gravitational acceleration on Mars is approximately \( 3.71 \, \text{N/kg} \), the closest option provided is \( 4 \, \text{N/kg} \).
