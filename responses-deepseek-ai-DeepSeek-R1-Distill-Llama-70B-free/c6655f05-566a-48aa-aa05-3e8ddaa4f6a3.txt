Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem about work done by a gas during an adiabatic expansion. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about carbon dioxide gas. The mass is 2.45 grams, and it's at 27.0 degrees Celsius. It expands reversibly and adiabatically from 500 cm³ to 3.00 dm³. I need to find the work done by the gas.

Wait, I remember that for an adiabatic process, the first law of thermodynamics tells us that the change in internal energy (ΔU) equals the work done (w), because there's no heat exchange (q=0). So, ΔU = w. But wait, the sign conventions—I think when the gas does work on the surroundings, the work is negative from the system's perspective. So if the gas expands, it's doing work on the surroundings, so the work should be negative.

But wait, the question is asking for the work done by the gas, so maybe I should be careful with the sign. Oh right, in physics, work done by the system is considered negative in the system's internal energy. So in this case, the work done by the gas would be negative.

Now, for an adiabatic reversible (isentropic) process, the work can be calculated using the formula:

w = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (γ - 1)

But wait, is that right? I think the formula for work done during an adiabatic process is indeed w = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ-1), but only when it's a reversible process. Also, I might need to find the initial and final pressures, but I don't have them directly.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the change in temperature and then find ΔU using nCvΔT, since for an ideal gas, ΔU depends only on temperature change. Since the process is adiabatic, ΔU equals the work done.

So maybe I can find ΔT first and then find the work.

Wait, but to find ΔT, I need to know the relation between temperatures and volumes during an adiabatic process. The formula is TV^(γ-1) = constant. So, T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1).

But I don't know T2, but I can relate it to the work. Alternatively, I might need to compute the work using the formula involving moles, Cv, and the temperature change.

Wait, let me outline the steps I need to take.

1. Find the number of moles of CO2. The mass is 2.45 g, and the molar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol. So n = mass / molar mass.

2. Determine the initial temperature in Kelvin.

3. Find the initial and final volumes. Wait, the initial volume is 500 cm³, which is 0.5 dm³, and the final is 3.00 dm³.

4. Find γ (the heat capacity ratio) for CO2. For diatomic gases, it's around 1.4, but CO2 is triatomic, so maybe γ is different. Wait, CO2 is a linear molecule, but when considering degrees of freedom, maybe at room temperature, CO2 has 3 translational, 3 rotational (but maybe 2 due to linear), and some vibrational modes which might not contribute much. So the molar heat capacities would be Cv = (f/2) R, where f is the degrees of freedom.

Wait, for a monatomic gas, f=3, so Cv=(3/2)R. Diatomic (like O2, N2) have f=5 (3 transl, 2 rotational) at room temp, so Cv=(5/2)R. CO2 is a linear triatomic, so at room temp, it has f=7? Because 3 transl, 3 rotational (wait, no, for linear molecules, rotational degrees are 2), so f=5? Wait, no, wait—I think CO2 has 3 translational, 2 rotational, so f=5, making Cv = (5/2) R. So γ = Cp/Cv = [(5/2 R + R)] / (5/2 R) ) = (7/2 R)/(5/2 R) ) = 7/5 = 1.4. So same as diatomic, which is 1.4. Hmm, but wait, some sources say CO2 has γ = 1.3. Maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps for this problem, since it's a perfect gas, we can take γ as 1.4.

Wait, but perhaps the problem gives us the necessary data. Oh wait, the problem says "Unless otherwise stated, thermodynamic data are for 298.15 K." So maybe I can look up the molar heat capacities at this temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use γ = 1.4.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to actually compute γ correctly. So, CO2 has 3 translational degrees of freedom, 2 rotational (because it's linear), so f=5. So Cv = (5/2) R. Then, Cp = Cv + R = (7/2) R. So γ = Cp/Cv = (7/5) = 1.4. So yes, γ is 1.4.

5. Now, for an adiabatic process, the work done is given by w = n Cv ΔT. Alternatively, using the relation between T and V: T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1). So, we can find T2 in terms of T1 and the volumes.

Wait, but since I don't know T2, maybe it's easier to express the work in terms of the initial and final states.

Wait, another formula for work done in an adiabatic reversible expansion is:

w = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ - 1)

But I don't have P1 or P2. So perhaps I can express P1 in terms of the ideal gas law.

But wait, I can calculate P1 using the initial conditions. Let's see.

First, find n (moles of CO2):

n = mass / molar mass = 2.45 g / 44 g/mol ≈ 0.05568 mol.

Initial temperature T1 is 27.0°C, which is 300.15 K.

Initial volume V1 is 500 cm³ = 500 mL = 0.5 dm³.

So, using PV = nRT, P1 = n R T1 / V1.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So P1 = (0.05568 mol) * 8.314 J/mol·K * 300.15 K / 0.5 dm³.

Wait, but the volume is in dm³, which is liters. Since 1 dm³ = 1 L, and R is in terms of dm³ if pressure is in kPa. Wait, no, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), and 1 J = 1 kPa·dm³. So, yes, using dm³ is correct.

So, let me compute P1.

n=0.05568, R=8.314, T=300.15, V=0.5.

P1 = (0.05568 * 8.314 * 300.15) / 0.5.

Calculating numerator: 0.05568 * 8.314 ≈ 0.05568 *8 = 0.44544, 0.05568 *0.314≈0.0175. So total ≈ 0.46294. Multiply by 300.15: 0.46294 *300 ≈ 138.88, more precisely 0.46294 *300.15 ≈ 138.9.

Then, divided by 0.5 dm³: 138.9 / 0.5 ≈ 277.8 kPa.

So P1 ≈ 277.8 kPa.

Now, the final volume V2 is 3.00 dm³.

We can find P2 using the adiabatic relation: P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ.

So P2 = P1 (V1 / V2)^γ.

V1 is 0.5 dm³, V2 is 3.00 dm³.

So (V1/V2) = 0.5 / 3 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

So, P2 = 277.8 kPa * (1/6)^1.4.

Compute (1/6)^1.4: let's compute ln(1/6) = -ln6 ≈ -1.7918, multiply by 1.4 gives ≈ -2.5075. Exponentiate: e^-2.5075 ≈ 0.081.

So P2 ≈ 277.8 * 0.081 ≈ 22.51 kPa.

Now, using the work formula:

w = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (γ -1)

Compute P1 V1: 277.8 kPa * 0.5 dm³ = 138.9 kPa·dm³.

Since 1 kPa·dm³ = 1 J, that's 138.9 J.

P2 V2: 22.51 kPa * 3 dm³ = 67.53 J.

So P1V1 - P2V2 = 138.9 - 67.53 = 71.37 J.

Divide by (γ -1) which is 0.4.

So w = 71.37 / 0.4 = 178.425 J.

Wait, but this is the magnitude. And since the gas is expanding, the work done by the gas is negative, right? Because the system is doing work on the surroundings, so from the system's perspective, it's losing energy as work.

Wait, but earlier I thought the formula gives work done by the gas as negative. So according to the calculation, the work is positive 178 J, but since the gas is doing work, it's negative. So w = -178 J.

Looking at the options, option A is -172, option E is -240, option C is -210, etc. None exactly match -178. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

First, calculating n: 2.45g /44g/mol = 0.0556818... So that's correct.

Calculating P1: (n R T)/V.

n=0.05568, R=8.314, T=300.15, V=0.5.

So 0.05568 *8.314 = approx 0.05568*8=0.44544, 0.05568*0.314≈0.0175. So 0.46294.

Multiply by 300.15: 0.46294 *300 ≈ 138.88, precise calculation: 0.46294*300.15= let's compute 0.46294 *300 = 138.882, 0.46294 *0.15=0.069441, total 138.9514.

Then, divide by V=0.5: 138.9514 / 0.5 = 277.9028 kPa. So P1= approx 277.9 kPa.

Then P2 = P1*(V1/V2)^γ.

V1/V2 = 0.5/3 = 1/6.

(1/6)^1.4: let me compute more accurately.

Take ln(1/6) = -1.791759.

Multiply by 1.4: -2.50766.

e^-2.50766 = approx?

Let me compute e^-2.5 = 0.082085; e^-0.00766 ≈ 0.9924. So e^-2.50766 ≈ 0.082085 * 0.9924 ≈ 0.0815.

So P2 = 277.9 * 0.0815 ≈ 22.62 kPa.

Then P1 V1 is 277.9 * 0.5 = 138.95 J.

P2 V2 is 22.62 *3 = 67.86 J.

So P1V1 - P2V2 = 138.95 -67.86 =71.09 J.

Divide by (γ-1)=0.4: 71.09 /0.4 = 177.725 J.

So work done by gas is -177.7 J. So approximately -178 J.

But the options don't have exactly that. Closest is option A: -172, option G: -194, option I: -180.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating P2.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the relation T V^(γ-1) = const.

So, T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1).

Compute T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1).

So γ is 1.4, so γ-1=0.4.

V1=0.5, V2=3.

So (V1/V2) = 0.5/3 = 1/6 ≈ 0.1667.

So (1/6)^0.4 = e^(0.4 * ln(1/6)) = e^(0.4*(-1.7918)) = e^(-0.7167) ≈ 0.489.

So T2 = 300.15 K * 0.489 ≈ 146.73 K.

Then, ΔT = T2 - T1 =146.73 -300.15 = -153.42 K.

Now, the change in internal energy ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

Cv for CO2 is (5/2) R = (5/2)*8.314 ≈ 20.785 J/mol·K.

So ΔU = 0.05568 mol * 20.785 J/mol·K * (-153.42 K).

Compute that:

0.05568 *20.785 ≈ 1.158 J/K.

Multiply by -153.42 K: 1.158 * (-153.42) ≈ -177.7 J.

So ΔU = w = -177.7 J.

Again, same result. So the work done by the gas is -177.7 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: -172, but that's a bit off. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the value of γ. Wait, I thought CO2 has γ=1.4, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, let me think again. CO2 is a triatomic gas, but linear. At room temperature, its degrees of freedom are 3 translational and 2 rotational, so f=5. So Cv = (5/2) R, and γ = (7/5) = 1.4. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to take γ as 1.3 for CO2? Let me check a quick reference. Oh, wait, I recall that for CO2, γ is approximately 1.3. Because for some polyatomic gases, γ can be lower. So maybe I was wrong to take γ=1.4.

Wait, perhaps I should check γ for CO2. Let me think: for monoatomic, f=3 → Cv=12.47 J/mol·K (since (3/2)R ≈ 12.47), γ=5/3≈1.6667.

Diatomic gases (like O2, N2) at room temp have f=5 (3 trans, 2 rot), so Cv=(5/2)R=20.785 J/mol·K. Then Cp=Cv + R=29.099 J/mol·K. So γ=29.099/20.785≈1.4.

For polyatomic gases, like CO2 (triatomic), f might be higher. Wait, but CO2 is linear, so maybe rotational degrees are 2, not 3. So f=5, same as diatomic, so same γ=1.4. Alternatively, maybe in some cases, for nonlinear polyatomic molecules, f=6, leading to Cv=(6/2)R=24.94 J/mol·K, γ= (7/6 R + R)/(6/2 R) ) Wait, no, wait: for f degrees of freedom, Cv = (f/2) R. Cp = Cv + R = (f/2 +1) R. So γ = Cp/Cv = (f/2 +1)/(f/2) )= (f+2)/f. For f=5, γ=(7)/5=1.4. So for CO2, γ is 1.4.

So I think my initial approach was correct with γ=1.4.

So perhaps the mistake lies elsewhere. Let me check the P2 calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate (1/6)^1.4 more accurately.

Compute ln(1/6) = -1.791759.

1.4 * (-1.791759) = -2.50766.

e^-2.50766 ≈ ?

We know that e^-2 = 0.1353, e^-0.50766 ≈ ?

Compute 0.50766: e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.50766 ≈ let's compute 0.50766 = 0.5 + 0.00766.

So e^-0.5 = 0.6065, e^-0.00766 ≈ 1 - 0.00766 + (0.00766^2)/2 ≈ 0.9924.

So e^-0.50766 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9924 ≈ 0.6013.

So e^-2.50766 = e^-2 * e^-0.50766 ≈ 0.1353 * 0.6013 ≈ 0.0813.

So P2 = 277.9 kPa * 0.0813 ≈ 22.6 kPa.

So P2 V2 =22.6 *3 =67.8 J.

P1 V1 =277.9 *0.5=138.95 J.

So 138.95 -67.8=71.15.

Divide by (γ-1)=0.4: 71.15/0.4=177.875 J.

So work done by gas is -177.875 J. So approximately -178 J.

But the options don't have exactly that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait,
