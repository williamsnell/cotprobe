Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the dissociation of Cl2 gas into Cl atoms. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me the reaction Cl2(g) ⇌ 2Cl(g) at 1200 K. I need to calculate the equilibrium constant Kp using statistical thermodynamics. They provided some data: the equilibrium internuclear distance is 0.199 nm, the fundamental vibration frequency of Cl2 is 565 cm^-1, and the energy of dissociation is 2.48 eV.

Hmm, I remember that for diatomic gases, the equilibrium constant can be calculated using the formula involving the partition functions. Oh right, the formula is K_p = (Q_total)^Δν * exp(-ΔE/(RT)), where Δν is the change in the number of moles of gas. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the partition functions of the reactants and products.

Wait, the general approach is to consider the partition functions for each species involved. For the dissociation, the equilibrium constant K is given by the ratio of the partition functions of the products over reactants, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. So for Cl2 dissociating into 2Cl atoms, the expression would be K = (q_Cl^2) / (q_Cl2). But wait, I think I might be mixing up whether it's Kp or Kc. Also, considering that pressure is involved, but maybe in terms of partial pressures, so Kp would relate to the partition functions in terms of the translational and internal (vibrational, rotational) contributions.

Wait, another approach: For diatomic molecules, the dissociation can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator approximations. The partition function for the molecule would include translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions. For the atoms, it's just translational and electronic, but maybe at high temperatures, electronic contributions are negligible.

So the equilibrium constant Kp is given by [Cl]^2 / [Cl2]. Using the partition functions, this becomes (q_Cl^2 / q_Cl2) * exp(-ΔE/(RT)), where ΔE is the dissociation energy. Or wait, no—the partition function for Cl2 includes the vibrational and rotational parts, while Cl is just translational.

Wait, maybe the formula is K = ( (q_trans_Cl * q_elec_Cl)^2 ) / ( q_trans_Cl2 * q_vib_Cl2 * q_rot_Cl2 ) ) * exp(-D/(RT)), where D is the dissociation energy. But I'm a bit confused about all the terms.

Wait, another formula I vaguely remember is Kp = (P^Δn) * (σ * (kT)^{3/2} ) / (sqrt(π m)) ) something like that. No, maybe that's for pure translational partition functions. Oh, right, the translational partition function is q_trans = (2πmkT/(h²))^{3/2} * V. But when taking the ratio, the V terms might cancel out if the same volume is considered.

Alternatively, the expression for Kp when considering only translational and vibrational contributions (since at high temps, rotation might contribute, but perhaps it's ignored for a first approximation) is:

Kp = ( (2 q_trans_Cl)^2 ) / (q_trans_Cl2 * q_vib_Cl2) ) * exp(-D/(RT))

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Saha equation or the dissociation formula in statistical mechanics.

Wait, the Saha equation is used for ionization, not sure. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the general formula for the equilibrium constant in terms of molecular partition functions.

Each molecular species has a partition function q which is the product of translational (q_trans), rotational (q_rot), vibrational (q_vib), and electronic (q_elec) partition functions. So for Cl2, q_Cl2 = q_trans * q_rot * q_vib * q_elec. For Cl atoms, q_Cl = q_trans * q_elec (assuming monatomic, so no rotation or vibration).

But at high temperatures, maybe the electronic partition function for Cl is significant. Wait, but Cl has a ground state with electronic degeneracy. The electronic partition function q_elec for Cl would be the number of ground state degeneracies. Chlorine has an atomic ground state with electronic configuration [Ne]3s² 3p⁵. So the term symbol is ²P, which has J = 1/2 and J = 3/2. The degeneracy for each J is 2J+1. So for J=1/2: 2 states, J=3/2: 4 states. So total q_elec for Cl is 2 + 4 = 6. So q_elec_Cl = 6.

But wait, for Cl2 molecule, what's the electronic partition function? Cl2 in its ground state is a diatomic with a certain electronic state, maybe with a particular multiplicity. Wait, Cl2 is a homonuclear diatomic, and in the ground state, it's a singlet state with multiplicity 1. So maybe its electronic partition function is 1. Or I might be wrong. Wait, ground state of Cl2 is X^1Σ_g^+ I think, which is a singlet state. So q_elec for Cl2 would be 1, because the multiplicity is 1 (so 2S+1=1 → S=0).

Wait, but for K_p, when you take the ratio, perhaps the electronic partition functions will play a role. Let me try to outline the steps.

The equilibrium constant Kp is given by:

Kp = ( [Cl]^2 ) / [Cl2] = ( (q_Cl)^2 / q_Cl2 ) * e^{-D/(RT)} }

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think: The general formula is K = ( (q_product)^ν_product ) / (q_reactant)^ν_reactant ) * e^{-ΔE/(RT)} }

In this case, the reaction is Cl2 → 2Cl. So the formula becomes:

Kp = (q_Cl^2) / q_Cl2 * e^{-D/(RT)} }

Wait, but what about the translational partition functions? Because for ideal gases, the concentrations are related to the translational partition functions.

Wait, another approach: the translational partition function for a gas is q_trans = (2πmkT/(h²))^{3/2} V. For Cl2, m is the molar mass, and for Cl, it's half that (since Cl2 dissociates into 2 Cl atoms).

Wait, let's compute the ratio of the translational partition functions.

q_trans_Cl = (2π m_Cl k T / h² )^{3/2} V. But m_Cl is the atomic mass. For Cl2, m_Cl2 = 2 m_Cl.

So q_trans_Cl2 = (2π (2 m_Cl) k T / h² )^{3/2} V.

So the ratio q_trans_Cl^2 / q_trans_Cl2 is [ (2π m_Cl k T / h² )^{3/2} V * 2 ]^2 / [ (2π (2 m_Cl) k T / h² )^{3/2} V ].

Wait, let me compute that.

Let me denote A = 2π m k T / h². Then for Cl, A_Cl = 2π m_Cl k T / h². For Cl2, A_Cl2 = 2π (2 m_Cl) k T / h² = 2 A_Cl.

So q_trans_Cl = A_Cl^{3/2} V.

q_trans_Cl2 = (2 A_Cl)^{3/2} V.

So (q_trans_Cl)^2 = (A_Cl^{3/2} V)^2 = A_Cl^3 V².

q_trans_Cl2 = (2^{3/2} A_Cl^{3/2}) V).

So the ratio (q_trans_Cl^2) / q_trans_Cl2 = [A_Cl^3 V² ] / [2^{3/2} A_Cl^{3/2} V ] ] = A_Cl^{3/2} V / 2^{3/2}.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I can express this in terms of (V) and (m). Alternatively, perhaps the volume terms cancel out when considering concentrations, but maybe in Kp, only the partial pressures matter, which relate to the translational partition functions. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (q_Cl^2)/(q_Cl2) can be broken down into translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions.

So, q_total_Cl = q_trans_Cl * q_elec_Cl.

q_total_Cl2 = q_trans_Cl2 * q_rot_Cl2 * q_vib_Cl2 * q_elec_Cl2.

So the ratio (q_Cl^2)/(q_Cl2) equals:

(q_trans_Cl^2 * q_elec_Cl^2 ) / ( q_trans_Cl2 * q_rot_Cl2 * q_vib_Cl2 * q_elec_Cl2 )

Assuming that for Cl, rotation and vibration are not considered (since it's an atom), and for Cl2, they are.

So let's compute each part.

First, the translational part:

(q_trans_Cl^2) / q_trans_Cl2.

As before, I think this simplifies to ( (2π m_Cl k T / h² )^{3} V^2 ) / ( (2π (2 m_Cl) k T / h² )^{3/2} V ) )

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

q_trans_Cl = (2π m k T / h² )^{3/2} V

So q_trans_Cl^2 = (2π m k T / h² )^3 V^2.

q_trans_Cl2 = (2π (2m) k T / h² )^{3/2} V.

So the ratio is:

( (2π m k T / h² )^3 V^2 ) / ( (2π 2m k T / h² )^{3/2} V )

= (2π m k T / h² )^{3 - 3/2} * (V^{2-1}) / (2m)^{3/2} )

= (2π m k T / h² )^{3/2} * V / (2^{3/2} m^{3/2} ) )

= ( (2π)^{3/2} m^{3/2} (kT)^{3/2} ) / h^3 ) * V / (2^{3/2} m^{3/2} )

= ( (2π)^{3/2} / 2^{3/2} ) * (kT)^{3/2} V / h^3 )

Simplify 2π/2: 2^{3/2} in numerator and denominator?

Wait, 2π is in the numerator, and denominator is 2^{3/2}.

So 2π/2^{3/2} = (2^{1} π ) / (2^{3/2}) ) = π / 2^{1/2}.

So the translational ratio becomes (π / 2^{1/2}) ) * (kT)^{3/2} V / h^3.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the ratio in terms of sqrt(π) or something. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the translational partition functions per unit volume, considering the molar masses.

Wait, perhaps I can relate this to the root-mean-square speed or something, but maybe I'm getting off track.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to use the formula for Kp that considers the vibrational and dissociation energy.

Wait, I remember that the vibrational partition function for a diatomic molecule is given by q_vib = 1/(1 - exp(-h c ν / (k T)) ), where ν is the vibration frequency in cm^-1, c is the speed of light, and h is Planck's constant.

But wait, the formula is q_vib = sum_{n=0}^∞ exp( - (n + 1/2) h ν / (k T) ) )

Which is a geometric series with ratio exp(-h ν/(k T)). So the sum is 1/( exp(h ν/(2k T)) ) * 1/(1 - exp(-h ν/(k T)) ), which simplifies to 1/(2 sinh( h ν/(2 k T) )) ).

But at high temperatures, h ν << k T, so sinh(x) ≈ x, so q_vib ≈ k T/(h ν). Because for x small, sinh(x) ≈ x, so 1/(2x) ) → 1/( 2*(h ν/(2k T)) ) ) → k T/(h ν).

Wait, but wait, the given ν is 565 cm^-1. Let me compute h c ν.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

ν is given as 565 cm^-1, which is wavenumbers, so in terms of frequency, it's ν = c * 565 m^-1.

Wait, no. Wait, wavenumber is 1/lambda, so ν (frequency) is c * wavenumber.

So, ν = 565 cm^-1 = 565 * 1e2 m^-1 = 5.65e4 m^-1. So ν = 5.65e4 * c? No, wait, ν (in Hz) is c * wavenumber.

Wait, no, wait. Wavenumber (cm^-1) is 1/lambda (cm), so for a wavenumber of 565 cm^-1, the wavelength is 1/565 cm. So frequency ν is c / lambda. So ν = c * (wavenumber) in cm^-1, but need to convert units.

Wait, 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm^-1 = 100 m^-1. So 565 cm^-1 = 565 * 100 m^-1 = 5.65e4 m^-1.

But ν (in Hz) is c (m/s) * wavenumber (m^-1) → (3e8 m/s) * (5.65e4 m^-1) = 1.695e13 Hz.

Wait, now I have to compute h ν. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

h ν = 6.626e-34 * 1.695e13 = approx 1.123e-20 J.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K. Temperature T is 1200 K.

So k T = 1.38e-23 * 1200 = 1.656e-20 J.

So h ν = 1.123e-20 J.

So h ν/(k T) = 1.123e-20 / 1.656e-20 ≈ 0.678.

Wait, that's about 0.678. So not negligible, meaning the high-temperature approximation may not hold. So I can't approximate q_vib as k T/(h ν). I need to compute it more accurately.

The vibrational partition function q_vib = 1/(2 sinh( h ν/(2 k T) )).

Compute h ν/(2 k T): 0.678 / 2 = 0.339.

So sinh(0.339) ≈ let me recall that sinh(x) ≈ x + x^3/6 + x^5/120... Let's compute for x=0.339.

x^3 = 0.339^3 ≈ 0.039. x^3/6 ≈ 0.0065.

x^5 is about 0.339^5 ≈ approx 0.005. x^5/120 ≈ 0.00004.

So sinh(0.339) ≈ 0.339 + 0.0065 + 0.00004 ≈ 0.3455.

But maybe it's better to use a calculator approach, but since I can't do that, perhaps I can remember that sinh(0.339) is about 0.345.

So q_vib = 1/(2 * 0.345) ≈ 1/(0.69) ≈ 1.449.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute sinh(0.339) more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps using the exact formula: q_vib = 1 / [exp(hν/(2kT)) - exp(-hν/(2kT))] / 2.

Wait, no, q_vib is the sum over n of exp(- (n + 1/2) hν/(kT) ), which is 1/(exp(hν/(2kT)) - exp(-hν/(2kT))) ) * exp(-hν/(2kT)) ), which simplifies to 1/( 2 sinh(hν/(2kT)) ), as I had before.

So with hν/(2kT) ≈ 0.339, sinh(0.339) ≈ 0.346. So q_vib ≈ 1/(2*0.346) ≈ 1.445.

So q_vib ≈ 1.445.

Now, the rotational partition function q_rot for a diatomic molecule. Assuming it's a rigid rotor, q_rot = (8 π² (k T)/(2 h²)) )^{1/2} * I, where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, moment of inertia I for Cl2: I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length. The bond length is given as 0.199 nm, which is 0.199e-9 m.

The reduced mass μ for Cl2 is (m_Cl * m_Cl)/(m_Cl + m_Cl) ) = m_Cl/2. The atomic mass of Cl is about 35.45 g/mol, so molar mass M = 35.45 g/mol, so m_Cl = (35.45e-3 kg/mol ) / (6.022e23 mol^-1 ) ≈ 5.887e-26 kg.

So μ = (5.887e-26 kg)/2 ≈ 2.9435e-26 kg.

I = μ r² = 2.9435e-26 kg * (0.199e-9 m)^2.

Compute that: 0.199e-9 m is 1.99e-10 m. Squared is (1.99e-10)^2 ≈ 3.9601e-20 m².

So I ≈
