Okay, so I've got this phasor problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because phasors can be a little tricky, especially when you're dealing with multiple voltages and different angles. But I'll give it a shot. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem gives me four phasors:

- V₁₂ = 6∠30°
- V₂₃ = 2∠0°
- V₂₄ = 6∠-60°
- V₁₅ = 4∠90°

And I need to find three more phasors: V₁₄, V₄₃, and V₃₅. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values. 

Wait, I think I remember that in a circuit, the voltages around a loop must sum up to zero. So maybe I can set up some equations using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). But first, I need to figure out the connections between these points. Let me try to visualize the circuit.

Hmm, the nodes are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So probably, the circuit is something like a mesh where each V represents the voltage between two nodes. So V₁₂ is the voltage from 1 to 2, V₂₃ from 2 to 3, etc. But wait, I'm not exactly sure how the nodes are connected. Maybe it's a five-node system connected in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a star or delta configuration, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe it's a series of nodes where each V represents a branch. Let's think: V₁₂ is between 1 and 2, V₂₃ between 2 and 3, and so on. So perhaps the nodes are arranged in a circle or some other topology. Alternatively, maybe it's a ladder network or something else. Without a diagram, this is a bit challenging, but perhaps I can proceed with the given info.

Let me start by looking for voltage relations that can help me find V₁₄. V₁₄ is the voltage from node 1 to node 4. How can I express this in terms of the given voltages?

Well, if I can find a path from 1 to 4, I can sum the voltages along that path. Let's say the path goes from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4. Then, V₁₄ would be V₁₂ + V₂₃ + V₃₄. Wait, but I don't have V₃₄. Alternatively, perhaps another path.

Wait, maybe there's another path from 1 to 4 through node 5. So the path could be 1→5→4. Then V₁₄ would be V₁₅ + V₅₄. But I don't know V₅₄ either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using other given voltages. Wait, I also have V₂₄, which is the voltage from 2 to 4. So from node 2 to node 4 is 6∠-60°. So maybe I can write V₂₄ in terms of other voltages.

Wait, if I go from 2 to 3, then 3 to 4, that's V₂₃ + V₃₄ = V₂₄. So V₂₃ + V₃₄ = V₂₄. But I don't know V₃₄. Let me write that down:

V₂₃ + V₃₄ = V₂₄

So V₃₄ = V₂₄ - V₂₃. Plugging in the values:

V₂₃ is 2∠0°, which is 2 + j0. V₂₄ is 6∠-60°, which is 6*(cos(-60°) + j sin(-60°)) = 6*(0.5 - j*(√3/2)) = 3 - j3√3.

So subtracting V₂₃ (which is 2) from V₂₄ (3 - j3√3):

V₃₄ = (3 - j3√3) - 2 = 1 - j3√3.

So V₃₄ is 1 - j5.196 (since √3≈1.732, so 3√3≈5.196). But wait, let me double-check that. Oh, wait, 3√3 is approximately 5.196, yes, but the calculation is correct: 3 - j3√3 minus 2 is 1 - j3√3.

Alternatively, expressing this in polar form. Let me compute the magnitude and angle.

The magnitude is sqrt(1² + (3√3)²) = sqrt(1 + 27) = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915.

The angle is arctangent of (-3√3)/1, which is in the fourth quadrant. So arctan(5.196/1) ≈ 79 degrees below the real axis, so angle is -79°, approximately. So V₃₄ ≈ 5.2915∠-79°.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'll need V₃₄ for finding V₁₄. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find V₁₄ by another path. Let's think: from node 1 to 2 is V₁₂, then from 2 to 4 is V₂₄. So V₁₄ could be V₁₂ + V₂₄? No, wait, that would be the case only if the path 1→2→4 is a direct path, but I think that's not correct because node 4 is connected to node 3 as well. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should model the nodes as a circuit with certain loops. Let me try to think of the nodes arranged in a way that forms a loop. For example, maybe nodes 1-2-3-4 form a loop, and then node 5 is connected elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridge circuit or something else.

Wait, maybe I should consider the entire network and set up KVL equations. I need to find V₁₄, which is from node 1 to 4. So perhaps I can express V₁₄ as the sum of V₁₂, V₂₃, and V₃₄. But I don't know V₃₄. Alternatively, perhaps another path.

Wait, another approach: if I can find the voltage from 1 to 4 through node 5, then V₁₄ = V₁₅ + V₅₄. I know V₁₅ is 4∠90°, which is 0 + j4.

But I don't know V₅₄. So maybe I can express V₅₄ in terms of other voltages. How?

Hmm, perhaps node 5 is connected to node 4 and node 3? Or maybe node 5 is connected to node 4 and somewhere else. Wait, maybe I can find another equation involving V₅₄.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write KVL around a loop that includes nodes 1,5,4, and back to 1. So the sum of voltages in that loop would be zero.

Wait, if the loop is 1-5-4-1, then the sum V₁₅ + V₅₄ + V₄₁ = 0. Wait, but V₄₁ is the negative of V₁₄. So:

V₁₅ + V₅₄ - V₁₄ = 0 → V₁₄ = V₁₅ + V₅₄.

But I need to find V₅₄. Alternatively, perhaps I can express V₅₄ in terms of other voltages.

Wait, maybe node 5 is connected to node 3 and node 4. So perhaps from node 5, there's a path to node 3 and node 4. So if I can find V₃₅, which is part of what we're supposed to find (part c), but that's a bit of a problem because it's one of the unknowns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find V₅₄ using other given voltages.

Wait, perhaps looking for another loop that includes V₅₄. Let me think: maybe a loop through nodes 2,4,5, and back to 2. Then, the sum would be V₂₄ + V₄₅ + V₅₂ = 0. But I don't know V₄₅ or V₅₂, so that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write more KVL equations to relate the unknowns.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the entire network is such that the sum of voltages around any loop is zero. So perhaps I can set up multiple equations and solve for the unknowns.

Wait, let's try to list all possible loops. But without knowing the exact connections, it's challenging. Maybe I should make some assumptions about the network structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assign variables to the unknown voltages and set up equations based on KVL.

Let me denote the unknown voltages as:

- V₁₄ = V_a
- V₄₃ = V_b (since V₄₃ is the same as -V₃₄)
- V₃₅ = V_c

Wait, but I'm not sure about the connections. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each voltage as a variable and set up equations based on the loops.

Wait, maybe I can consider the following loops:

1. Loop 1-2-3-4-1: So V₁₂ + V₂₃ + V₃₄ + V₄₁ = 0. But V₄₁ is -V₁₄, so:

V₁₂ + V₂₃ + V₃₄ - V₁₄ = 0 → V₁₄ = V₁₂ + V₂₃ + V₃₄.

But I don't know V₃₄. Alternatively, from earlier, I found V₃₄ = V₂₄ - V₂₃ = (6∠-60) - (2∠0) = (3 - j5.196) - 2 = 1 - j5.196.

So V₁₄ = V₁₂ + V₂₃ + V₃₄.

Wait, V₁₂ is 6∠30°, which is 6*(√3/2 + j*0.5) = 5.196 + j3.

V₂₃ is 2∠0°, which is 2 + j0.

V₃₄ is 1 - j5.196.

Adding these together:

Real parts: 5.196 + 2 + 1 = 8.196.

Imaginary parts: 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

So V₁₄ = 8.196 - j2.196.

To convert this to polar form, the magnitude is sqrt(8.196² + 2.196²).

Calculating:

8.196² ≈ 67.16

2.196² ≈ 4.819

Sum ≈ 71.979 → sqrt ≈ 8.48.

The angle is arctan(-2.196 / 8.196) ≈ arctan(-0.268). Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, the angle is in the fourth quadrant.

Calculating arctan(0.268) ≈ 15°, so the angle is -15°.

So V₁₄ ≈ 8.48∠-15°.

Looking at the options, option A and B have V₁₄ as 8.49∠-15°, which is very close. So part (a) is likely A or B. Let's keep that in mind.

Now, moving on to part (b): V₄₃.

Wait, V₄₃ is the voltage from node 4 to node 3, which is the negative of V₃₄. Because voltage from 3 to 4 is V₃₄, so from 4 to 3 is -V₃₄.

So V₄₃ = -V₃₄.

Earlier, I found V₃₄ as 1 - j5.196. So V₄₃ = -1 + j5.196.

Expressed in polar form, the magnitude is sqrt((-1)^2 + (5.196)^2) = sqrt(1 + 26.999) ≈ sqrt(27.999) ≈ 5.2915.

The angle is arctan(5.196 / (-1)). Since the real part is negative and the imaginary part positive, it's in the second quadrant. So 180° - 79° ≈ 101°, because earlier when I calculated V₃₄'s angle, it was about -79°, so V₄₃ would be 180 - 79 = 101°, approximately.

So V₄₃ ≈ 5.2915∠101°. Let me check the options.

Option A: V₄₃ = 5.1∠100.9°.

Option B: 5.3∠100.9°.

Hmm, my calculation is 5.29, which is approximately 5.3. So option B's V₄₃ is 5.3∠100.9°, which matches closely.

So now, for part (c), V₃₅.

V₃₅ is the voltage from node 3 to node 5. How can I find this?

Perhaps using another KVL equation. Let's think about a loop that includes V₃₅.

Suppose the loop is 3-5-4-3. Then, the sum would be V₃₅ + V₅₄ + V₄₃ = 0.

Wait, but I don't know V₅₄. Alternatively, perhaps another loop.

Wait, perhaps considering the loop 2-4-5-3-2. Then, the sum would be V₂₄ + V₄₅ + V₅₃ + V₃₂ = 0.

But that's getting too complicated, and I don't know all those voltages.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Let's think about node 5 and its connections. If node 5 is connected to node 1 and node 4, then perhaps I can write a KVL equation around the loop 1-5-4-1.

Wait, earlier I considered that and found V₁₄ = V₁₅ + V₅₄.

But I can also think about the loop 5-3-4-5. Then, the sum would be V₅₃ + V₃₄ + V₄₅ = 0. But I'm not sure about V₅₃ and V₄₅.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: let me think about the voltage V₃₅. If I can find a path from 3 to 5, perhaps through node 4.

So V₃₅ = V₃₄ + V₄₅. But I don't know V₄₅.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express V₄₅ in terms of other voltages. Wait, from node 4 to 5, V₄₅, and I know V₁₅ = 4∠90°, which is from node 1 to 5. If I can relate V₁₅ to V₁₄ and V₄₅.

Wait, earlier I wrote that V₁₄ = V₁₅ + V₅₄, which is V₁₅ + V₅₄ = V₁₄.

Wait, perhaps node 5 is connected to node 4 and node 1. So from 5 to 4 is V₅₄, and from 5 to 1 is V₁₅.

So from node 1 to 5 is V₁₅ = 4∠90°, and from 5 to 4 is V₅₄, and from 4 to 1 is V₁₄, which we calculated as approximately 8.48∠-15°. So the sum V₁₅ + V₅₄ - V₁₄ = 0 → V₅₄ = V₁₄ - V₁₅.

Wait, let's compute that.

V₁₄ = 8.48∠-15°, which is 8.48*(cos(-15°) + j sin(-15°)).

cos(-15°) ≈ 0.9659, sin(-15°) ≈ -0.2588.

So V₁₄ ≈ 8.48*(0.9659 - j0.2588) ≈ 8.48*0.9659 ≈ 8.19 (real part), and 8.48*(-0.2588) ≈ -2.20 (imaginary part).

So V₁₄ ≈ 8.19 - j2.20.

V₁₅ is 4∠90°, which is 0 + j4.

So V₅₄ = V₁₄ - V₁₅ ≈ (8.19 - j2.20) - (0 + j4) = 8.19 - j6.20.

Now, let's compute V₅₄.

So V₅₄ ≈ 8.19 - j6.20.

Now, the magnitude is sqrt(8.19² + 6.20²) ≈ sqrt(67.1 + 38.44) ≈ sqrt(105.54) ≈ 10.27.

The angle is arctan(-6.20/8.19) ≈ arctan(-0.757) ≈ -37.3°, so V₅₄ ≈ 10.27∠-37.3°.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 8.19 squared is approximately 67.1, and 6.2 squared is 38.44, sum is 105.54, square root is about 10.27. The angle is arctan(6.2/8.19) ≈ 37.3°, but since the imaginary part is negative, the angle is -37.3°, yes.

Now, going back to the loop 3-5-4-3: V₃₅ + V₅₄ + V₄₃ = 0.

So V₃₅ = - (V₅₄ + V₄₃).

We have V₅₄ ≈ 10.27∠-37.3° and V₄₃ ≈ 5.2915∠101°.

Wait, let me convert V₅₄ and V₄₃ to rectangular form to add them.

V₅₄: 10.27∠-37.3
