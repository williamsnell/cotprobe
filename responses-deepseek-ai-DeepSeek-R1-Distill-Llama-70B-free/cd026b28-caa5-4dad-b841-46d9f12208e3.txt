Okay, so I have this physics problem here about proton decay. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question states that the half-life of the proton is 10^33 years, and I'm supposed to find out how many decays per year would occur in a tank containing 350,000 liters of water. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of a quantity to decay. The formula I think I need here is the one for radioactive decay, which involves the decay constant. Oh right, the decay constant λ is related to the half-life (T½) by the equation λ = ln(2)/T½.

Wait, but protons are in the water. So first, I need to figure out how many protons are in that tank. Water is H₂O, right? So each molecule has two hydrogen atoms, each with one proton. Wait, no, each hydrogen atom has one proton, and each water molecule has two hydrogens. So for each water molecule, that's two protons.

So the number of water molecules is important here. To find that, I'll need to use the volume of the water and convert it into moles, then into molecules, and finally protons.

The volume given is 350,000 liters. Wait, 1 liter is 0.001 cubic meters, but more importantly, I remember that 1 liter of water has a mass of about 1 kilogram. So 350,000 liters would be 350,000 kg, or 3.5e5 kg.

The molar mass of water is roughly 18 grams per mole. So I can convert the mass to moles. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 3.5e5 kg is 350,000,000 grams. Dividing by 18 g/mol gives me the number of moles. Let me do that calculation:

350,000,000 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 19,444,444.44 moles.

Each mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is about 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So multiplying that by the number of moles gives the total molecules:

19,444,444.44 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 1.17e30 molecules.

Each water molecule has two protons (from the two hydrogens), so the total number of protons is 2 * 1.17e30 ≈ 2.34e30 protons.

Now, the decay constant λ is ln(2) divided by the half-life. The half-life given is 1e33 years. So:

λ = 0.693 / 1e33 per year.

The decay rate (number of decays per year) is given by the formula N * λ, where N is the number of protons.

So Nλ = 2.34e30 * (0.693 / 1e33) = ?

Let me compute that. 2.34e30 multiplied by 0.693 is approximately 1.62e30. Then divide by 1e33, which is the same as multiplying by 1e-33. So 1.62e30 * 1e-33 = 1.62e-3. Wait, that's about 0.00162 decays per year.

Looking at the options, J is 0.003 and B is 0.015. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, I think I did the Nλ correctly. Let me recompute:

N = 2.34e30 protons.

λ = 0.693 / 1e33 ≈ 6.93e-34 per year.

So Nλ = 2.34e30 * 6.93e-34 = let's compute the exponents first: 1e30 * 1e-34 is 1e-4. Then 2.34 * 6.93 is approximately 16.2, so 16.2e-4 is 0.00162. So about 0.0016 decays per year.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 0.003, but wait, 0.0016 is closer to 0.002, but none of the options have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made an error in the number of moles. Let me recalculate the moles:

350,000 liters is 350,000 kg. Because 1 liter of water is 1 kg, right? So 350,000 kg is 3.5e5 kg. Molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, which is 0.018 kg/mol.

So moles = mass / molar_mass = 3.5e5 kg / 0.018 kg/mol.

Let me compute that. 3.5e5 / 0.018 = 3.5e5 * (1/0.018) ≈ 3.5e5 * 55.555...

3.5e5 * 55.555 is 3.5 * 55.555 * 1e5. 3.5 *55 is 192.5, approximately. So 192.5e5, which is 1.925e7 moles. Wait, that's way different from my earlier calculation. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when converting grams to kg.

Wait, no: 350,000 liters is 350,000 kg. Because 1 liter = 1 kg. So 350,000 kg is 3.5e5 kg. Molar mass is 18 g/mol, which is 0.018 kg/mol. So 3.5e5 kg / 0.018 kg/mol = (3.5e5)/(1.8e-2) ) = 3.5e5 * (1/(1.8e-2)) ) = 3.5e5 * (55.555..) ≈ 3.5e5 * 5.5555e1 => 3.5e5 *5.5555e1 = 3.5 *5.5555 * 1e6 = approximately 19.444 * 1e6 = 1.9444e7 moles.

Wait, so earlier I had 19,444,444.44 moles, which is about 1.944e7, which matches this. So that was correct.

Then, number of molecules is 1.944e7 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol = approximately 1.17e31 molecules. Wait, wait, because 1.944e7 *6e23 = 1.1664e31 molecules. Oh wait, earlier I wrote 1.17e30. Wait, did I miss a decimal place?

Wait, 1.944e7 * 6.022e23 = (1.944 *6.022) * 1e30. Because 1e7 * 1e23 = 1e30. 1.944 *6.022 is approximately 11.7, so 11.7e30, which is 1.17e31 molecules.

Oh wait, I see my mistake now. Previously, I thought it was 1.17e30, but it's actually 1.17e31 molecules. That's a factor of 10 difference. So that changes things.

Then, each molecule has two protons, so total protons N = 2 * 1.17e31 = 2.34e31.

Now, calculate λ. λ = ln(2)/(1e33 years) ≈ 0.693/1e33 = 6.93e-34 per year.

Now, the decay rate is N * λ = 2.34e31 * 6.93e-34 = let's compute this:

2.34 * 6.93 ≈ 16.2, then 1e31 * 1e-34 = 1e-3. So 16.2e-3 is 0.0162 decays per year.

Hmm, so approximately 0.0162. Looking at the options, option B is 0.015, which is close. But wait, let me do the exact calculation.

Let me compute 2.34e31 * 6.93e-34. 2.34e31 is 2.34 *1e31, 6.93e-34 is 6.93 *1e-34.

Multiplying the coefficients: 2.34 *6.93 = let's calculate that.

2 *6.93 =13.86, 0.34 *6.93= approx 2.3562. So total is 13.86 + 2.3562 = 16.2162.

Now, 1e31 * 1e-34 = 1e-3.

So 16.2162e-3 = 0.0162162.

So approximately 0.0162 decays per year. The options are:

A:1.0, B:0.015, C:0.0008, D:5, E:0.5, F:1.5, G:0.08, H:2.4, I:3, J:0.003.

So the closest is B:0.015, which is 0.015. My calculation gives ≈0.0162, which is very close to 0.016. So option B is 0.015, which is just a bit lower.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Wait, the number of molecules: 350,000 liters is 350,000 kg, right?

Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 350,000 kg = 350,000,000 g. So moles = 350,000,000 / 18 = approx 19,444,444 moles.

Multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23) gives 1.944e7 *6.022e23 = 1.17e31 molecules. So that's correct.

Each molecule has 2 protons, so N=2.34e31.

λ = ln2 / 1e33 = 0.6931 / 1e33 = 6.931e-34 per year.

Nλ = 2.34e31 * 6.931e-34 = 2.34*6.931= ~16.22, times 1e-3, so 0.01622.

So approximately 0.0162. None of the options exactly match, but option B is 0.015, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of protons per molecule.

Wait, another point: each hydrogen atom has one proton. Each water molecule has two hydrogen atoms, so that's two protons. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: protons in oxygen? Oh wait, oxygen has 8 protons, but in a water molecule, each O has 8 protons. Wait, no, that's the nucleus, but the question is about protons decaying, which are in the nuclei. So I think the problem considers all protons in the water molecules, including those in oxygen.

Wait, wait! Oh no, I didn't account for the oxygen protons! Each water molecule has one oxygen atom, which has 8 protons. So each water molecule has 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10 protons.

Oh, I see, I missed that part. That changes everything. So each water molecule contributes 10 protons, not 2. So the total number of protons is 10 times higher than I calculated.

So let me redo the calculation. So the number of water molecules is 1.17e31, each with 10 protons, so N = 1.17e31 *10 = 1.17e32 protons.

Now, λ is still 6.931e-34 per year.

So Nλ = 1.17e32 * 6.931e-34 = (1.17 *6.931) * 1e-2.

1.17 *6.931 ≈ 8.108.

So 8.108e-2 is 0.0808 decays per year.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.08, which is very close to 0.0808. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, did I forget the protons in oxygen earlier? That makes a big difference. So I think that's the mistake I made. So the correct approach is to count all protons in each water molecule, which includes both hydrogen and oxygen.

So the correct calculation leads to about 0.0808, which is approximately 0.08, option G.

To determine the number of proton decays per year in a tank of water containing 350,000 liters, we proceed as follows:

1. **Volume and Mass of Water**:  
   The volume of water is 350,000 liters, and since 1 liter of water has a mass of 1 kg, the total mass is 350,000 kg.

2. **Moles of Water**:  
   The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18 g/mol, or 0.018 kg/mol. The number of moles of water is:  
   \[
   \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{350,000}{0.018} \approx 1.944 \times 10^7 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Number of Water Molecules**:  
   Each mole contains Avogadro's number of molecules, \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\). Thus, the total number of water molecules is:  
   \[
   \text{Molecules} = 1.944 \times 10^7 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 1.17 \times 10^{31} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

4. **Total Number of Protons**:  
   Each water molecule contains 10 protons (8 from oxygen and 2 from hydrogen). Therefore, the total number of protons is:  
   \[
   N = 1.17 \times 10^{31} \times 10 = 1.17 \times 10^{32} \, \text{protons}.
   \]

5. **Decay Constant**:  
   The half-life of the proton is given as \(T_{1/2} = 10^{33}\) years. The decay constant \(\lambda\) is related to the half-life by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} = \frac{0.693}{10^{33}} \approx 6.93 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{per year}.
   \]

6. **Decay Rate**:  
   The number of decays per year is given by \(N \lambda\):  
   \[
   N \lambda = 1.17 \times 10^{32} \times 6.93 \times 10^{-34} \approx 0.0808 \, \text{decays per year}.
   \]

7. **Closest Option**:  
   The calculated decay rate of approximately \(0.0808\) is closest to option **G: 0.08**.
