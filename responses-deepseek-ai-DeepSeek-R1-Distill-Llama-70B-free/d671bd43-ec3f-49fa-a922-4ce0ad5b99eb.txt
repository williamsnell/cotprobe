Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with transmission probabilities and all that quantum mechanics stuff. But let's give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Suppose there's a junction between two semiconductors represented by a barrier of height 2.0 eV and length 100 pm. I need to calculate the transmission probability of an electron with energy 1.5 eV. The options are from A to J, each with different probabilities.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with particles tunneling through a barrier, the transmission probability depends on the particle's energy relative to the barrier height. If the particle's energy is less than the barrier height, we're talking about quantum tunneling. If it's higher, the particle just goes over the barrier, and the transmission probability is close to 1.

In this case, the electron's energy is 1.5 eV, and the barrier is 2.0 eV. So 1.5 is less than 2.0, which means it's a tunneling scenario. I think the transmission coefficient for such cases is given by some exponential formula involving the barrier's width and the height.

Wait, I recall the formula for the transmission probability when a particle tunnels through a potential barrier. It's something like T = exp(-2 * sqrt(2m) * sqrt(V0 - E) * d / ħ), where m is the mass of the electron, V0 is the barrier height, E is the particle's energy, d is the barrier width, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

But wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh right, the exponent is negative and involves the mass, the barrier parameters, and the energy. The exact expression is T ≈ exp(-2√(2m(V0 - E)) d / ħ). Alternatively, I've heard it expressed using the term sqrt(2m) multiplied by the square root of the difference between the barrier height and the energy, then multiplied by the width, divided by ħ, all multiplied by 2.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But sometimes, when working in electron volts and nanometers or picometers, it's easier to use units that simplify the calculation. I think the mass of the electron is about 9.1 × 10^-31 kg.

Let me list out the given values:

V0 = 2.0 eV
E = 1.5 eV
d = 100 pm, which is 100 picometers. Oh wait, 1 picometer is 1e-12 meters. So 100 pm is 1e-10 meters.

So the difference V0 - E is 0.5 eV. I need to compute the square root of that, but wait, I have to make sure all the units are consistent. Because in the formula, the units should be in joules, meters, kilograms, etc.

So how do I handle the energy terms? I think I need to convert eV to joules. Because 1 eV is 1.602176634 × 10^-19 joules.

So let me compute (V0 - E) in joules: 0.5 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-20 J.

Wait, but wait, in the formula, it's sqrt(2m(V0-E)). So let's compute the term inside the square root first.

m is the electron mass, 9.1e-31 kg.

So 2m is 1.82e-30 kg.

Then 2m(V0-E) would be 1.82e-30 kg * 8.01e-20 J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So 1.82e-30 * 8.01e-20 = (1.82 *8.01) * 1e-50. Let me compute 1.82 *8.01: 1.82 *8 is 14.56, plus 1.82*0.01 is 0.0182, so total about 14.5782. So 1.82e-30 *8.01e-20 = approx 14.5782e-50 = 1.45782e-49 kg²·m²/s²? Wait, no, because wait, 2m(V0-E) is in kg*(J). But J is kg m²/s², so 2m(V0-E) is kg*(kg m²/s²) )= kg² m²/s². Taking the square root of that gives kg m/s, which is units of momentum. Hmm, but that makes sense, because the term inside the exponential is dimensionless when considering the other factors.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

So the exponent is: (-2) * sqrt(2m(V0-E)) * d / ħ

Let me compute each part.

First, compute (V0 - E) in joules: 0.5 eV = 0.5 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-20 J.

Then, sqrt(2m(V0-E)):

2m = 2 * 9.1e-31 kg = 1.82e-30 kg.

Multiply by (V0-E): 1.82e-30 kg * 8.01e-20 J.

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so 1.82e-30 kg * 8.01e-20 kg m²/s² = (1.82 * 8.01) * 1e-50 kg² m²/s².

So 1.82 *8.01 is about 14.578, so 14.578e-50 = 1.4578e-49 kg² m²/s².

The square root of that is sqrt(1.4578e-49) kg m/s.

sqrt(1.4578e-49) = sqrt(1.4578) * 1e-24.5 ≈ 1.207 * 1e-24.5.

Wait, 1e-49 under square root is 1e-24.5, which is 1e-24 * sqrt(1e-1) )= 1e-24 * 0.316 approx 3.16e-25.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Let me compute sqrt(1.4578e-49).

Compute sqrt(1.4578) ≈ 1.207, and sqrt(1e-49) is 1e-24.5. But 1e-24.5 is 3.16e-25, because 10^(-24.5) = 10^(-24) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-24 * 0.3162 = 3.162e-25.

So sqrt(1.4578e-49) ≈ 1.207 * 3.162e-25 ≈ 3.816e-25 kg m/s.

Wait, but I think I'm complicating things. Maybe I should use a different approach, perhaps using eV and angstrom units, and some known constants to simplify the calculation.

Alternatively, I've heard of the "attenuation coefficient" or "decay rate" in the barrier, which is given by k = sqrt(2m(V0 - E)) / ħ. Then the transmission probability is T = exp(-2 k d).

But perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV and nanometers, using some precomputed constants.

Wait, another approach: Using natural units, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can plug the numbers into the formula using SI units.

Let me try that.

So, let's list all the constants and values:

m = 9.1e-31 kg

V0 - E = 0.5 eV = 0.5 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-20 J

d = 100 pm = 100e-12 m = 1e-10 m

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

Now, compute the term inside the square root: 2m(V0 - E) = 2 * 9.1e-31 kg * 8.01e-20 J.

So 2 * 9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30 kg.

1.82e-30 kg * 8.01e-20 J = 1.82 *8.01 = ~14.58, so 14.58e-50 kg·J.

But since J is kg·m²/s², the product becomes kg²·m²/s².

Taking the square root gives sqrt(14.58e-50 kg² m²/s²) = sqrt(14.58) * 1e-25 kg m/s.

Wait, sqrt(14.58) is about 3.82, so 3.82e-25 kg m/s.

Wait, but now I'm getting a little stuck on the exact calculation. Maybe I should compute each part step by step.

Let me compute the exponent step by step.

Exponent: (-2) * sqrt(2m(V0 - E)) * d / ħ

Compute 2m(V0 - E) first: 2 * 9.1e-31 kg * 8.01e-20 J

2 *9.1e-31 = 1.82e-30 kg.

1.82e-30 kg *8.01e-20 J = 1.45782e-49 kg·J.

Wait, but kg·J is kg·(kg m²/s²) )= kg² m²/s².

So sqrt(2m(V0-E)) = sqrt(1.45782e-49 kg² m²/s²) = sqrt(1.45782e-49) kg m/s.

The square root of 1.45782e-49 is sqrt(1.45782)*1e-24.5.

sqrt(1.45782) ≈ 1.2076.

1e-24.5 is 1e-24 * 1e-0.5 = 1e-24 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-25.

So sqrt(1.45782e-49) ≈ 1.2076 * 3.162e-25 ≈ 3.82e-25 kg m/s.

Now, multiply by d: 3.82e-25 kg m/s * 1e-10 m = 3.82e-35 kg m²/s.

Wait, no, no, the exponent is (-2) * sqrt(2m(V0-E)) * d / ħ.

So, the term sqrt(2m(V0-E)) is 3.82e-25 kg m/s.

Multiply by d (1e-10 m): 3.82e-25 * 1e-10 = 3.82e-35 (kg m/s) * m = kg m²/s.

Wait, no, let me recheck.

Wait no, the formula is (sqrt(2m(V0-E))) * d. So that would be 3.82e-25 kg m/s * 1e-10 m = 3.82e-35 kg m²/s.

Then divide by ħ, which is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So (3.82e-35 kg m²/s) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s).

But wait, J is kg m²/s², so J·s is kg m²/s.

So the denominator is 1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So the division becomes (3.82e-35 kg m²/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s) ) = approx 3.82e-35 / 1.0545718e-34 = (3.82 / 10.5457) ) * 1e-1 = approx 0.3625 * 0.1 = 0.03625.

Wait, let me compute 3.82e-35 divided by 1.0545718e-34.

3.82e-35 / 1.0545718e-34 = (3.82 / 1.0545718) ) * (1e-35 / 1e-34) )

3.82 / 1.0545718 is approximately 3.82 / 1.05457 ≈ 3.62.

Wait, no, 1.05457 is about 1.05, so 3.82 / 1.05 is approximately 3.64.

So 3.64 * (1e-35 / 1e-34) ) = 3.64 * 0.1 = 0.364.

Wait, that makes sense because 1e-35 is 0.1 * 1e-34.

So the division gives approximately 0.364.

But wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the exponent. Let me recalculate:

3.82e-35 / 1.0545718e-34 = (3.82 / 1.0545718) * 10^(-35 - (-34)) ) = (3.82/1.0545718) * 10^(-1) ) ≈ 3.62 * 0.1 ≈ 0.362.

So that term is 0.362.

Now, the exponent is (-2) multiplied by this term.

So exponent = -2 * 0.362 ≈ -0.724.

So the transmission probability T is exp(-0.724).

What's exp(-0.724)?

I remember that exp(-0.7) is about 0.4966, and exp(-0.724) is a bit lower. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me think: 0.724 is approximately 0.7 + 0.024.

exp(-0.7) = 0.4966.

exp(-0.724) = exp(-0.7) * exp(-0.024).

exp(-0.024) ≈ 1 - 0.024 + (0.024^2)/2 - ... but for small x, exp(-x) ≈ 1 - x.

So exp(-0.024) ≈ 1 - 0.024 = 0.976.

So exp(-0.724) ≈ 0.4966 * 0.976.

Let me compute that: 0.4966 * 0.976.

0.4966 * 0.976 = ?

Well, 0.5 * 0.976 = 0.488.

But since 0.4966 is 0.4966, which is 0.5 - 0.0034.

So (0.5 - 0.0034) * 0.976 = 0.5 *0.976 - 0.0034 * 0.976.

0.5 *0.976 = 0.488.

0.0034 *0.976 = approx 0.00331744.

So subtracting: 0.488 - 0.00331744 ≈ 0.48468.

So exp(-0.724) ≈ 0.4847.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation. Because when I computed 3.82e-35 divided by 1.05e-34, it's 3.82/10.5 which is about 0.364, but when I multiply that by the 2 in the exponent, it's -2*0.364 = -0.728, so the exponent is -0.728.

So exp(-0.728) is approximately what?

I know that exp(-0.7) is about 0.4966, and exp(-0.728) is a bit lower.

Let me think: 0.728 is 0.7 + 0.028.

So exp(-0.728) = exp(-0.7) * exp(-0.028).

exp(-0.7) = 0.4966.

exp(-0.028) ≈ 1 -0.028 + (0.028^2)/2 - ... which is approximately 0.9726.

So 0.4966 * 0.9726 ≈ let's compute:

0.4966 * 0.9726.

Let me do it step by step.

0.4 * 0.9726 = 0.38904.

0.09 * 0.9726 = 0.087534.

0.0066 * 0.9726 = approx 0.006426.

Adding them together: 0.38904 + 0.087534 = 0.476574 + 0.006426 = 0.483.

So exp(-0.728) ≈ 0.483.

So the transmission probability is about 0.483, so approximately 48%.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.5, which is the closest to 0.48. But wait, perhaps I made some approximations that might have thrown me off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should use more accurate constants. Let me recalculate each step more precisely.

Given:

m = 9.1093837015e-31 kg

V0 - E = 0.5 eV = 0.5 * 1.602176634e-19 J = 8.01088317e-20 J.

d = 100 pm = 1e-10 m.

ħ = 1.054571817e-34 J·s.

Compute sqrt(2m(V0-E)).

2m = 2 * 9.1093837015e-31 = 1.8218767403e-30 kg.

2m*(V0-E) = 1.8218767403e-30 kg * 8.01088317e-20 J = ?

Let me compute 1.8218767403e-30 * 8.01088317e-20.

1.8218767403 * 8.01088317 ≈ let's compute that:

1.8218767 * 8.01088317.

First, compute 1.8 * 8.0 = 14.4.

But more precisely:

1.8218767403 *8.01088317 = 

= 1.82187674 * 8.01088317

Let me compute 1.82187674 * 8 = 14.57501492.

1.82187674 * 0.010883
