Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the fractional void volume in three different ionic compounds: CsCl, NaCl, and LiCl. Hmm, I remember that fractional void volume is the empty space in the crystal structure. The question gives me the ionic radii of the cations and anions, and some structure details.

First, I think I need to figure out the crystal structures for each compound. Oh right, the problem states that. For CsCl, the positive and negative ions each form a simple cubic lattice, and each ion has eight nearest neighbors of the opposite charge. Wait, that sounds like a CsCl structure, which I think is a body-centered cubic arrangement? Or maybe it's a simple cubic with each ion surrounded by eight of the opposite. Wait, no, wait. CsCl structure: each ion is at the corners of a cube, and the other ion is at the center of the cube. So each ion has eight neighbors? Because the central ion touches all eight corners. So the coordination number is 8 for both ions.

For NaCl and LiCl, the ions form face-centered cubic lattices. So that's the rock-salt structure. Each ion has six nearest neighbors of the opposite charge because in fcc, each ion is touched by six others.

The problem says to assume the ions are hard spheres in contact. So the sum of the cation and anion radii should equal the distance between them in the crystal.

Wait, but how does that relate to the unit cell? Let me think. For each structure, I need to find the unit cell volume, then determine the volume occupied by the ions and subtract to find the void volume.

Fractional void volume is (unit cell volume - volume of ions in the cell) / unit cell volume.

So for each compound, I need to compute:

1. Determine the unit cell type and parameter (a).
2. Calculate the volume of the unit cell.
3. Find the number of ions in the unit cell and their total volume.
4. Subtract to find the void volume, then divide by the unit cell volume to get the fractional void volume.

Let's start with CsCl.

CsCl structure: It's a simple cubic lattice of each ion. Or wait, more accurately, the Cs+ ions form a simple cubic lattice, and Cl- ions are also in a simple cubic but offset. So each unit cell has one Cs+ and one Cl- ion. Because in a simple cubic, each corner has 1/8 of an ion, and there are 8 corners, making one ion per unit cell. But wait, if both lattices are simple cubic, then the unit cell would have one Cs+ and one Cl-? Wait, I'm a bit confused. No, wait. In CsCl structure, each ion is surrounded by eight of the other ion. So each unit cell has one Cs+ and one Cl- ion. So the number of formula units per unit cell is 1.

Now, to find the unit cell parameter, a. Since the ions are in contact, the distance between the centers (which would be a/2 in a simple cubic, maybe?) is the sum of their radii. Wait, no. Let me think: in CsCl structure, the ions touch along the cube edges or the face diagonals? No, wait, the Cs+ and Cl- are in contact along the edge of the cube. Because in simple cubic, the nearest neighbor is along the edge. So the edge length 'a' would be twice the sum of the radii. Because each ion touches the nearest along the edge. So a = 2*(r_Cs + r_Cl).

Wait, let me clarify. The Cs+ and Cl- are arranged in a way that each is at the cube corners, and the other is at the center. So the distance between Cs+ and Cl- is half the edge length, because from corner to center is a/2. So a/2 = r_Cs + r_Cl. So a = 2*(r_Cs + r_Cl).

Given the radii: Cs+ is 1.69 Å, Cl- is 1.81 Å. So sum is 3.50 Å. Multiply by 2: a = 7.00 Å.

Wait, wait no wait. Because from corner to center is a/2. So the distance between Cs+ (at corner) and Cl- (at center) is a√3/2? No, no, wait. Let's think: the Cs+ is at (0,0,0), and Cl- is at (a/2, a/2, a/2), right? So the distance between them is sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2] = a√3/2. But wait, in reality, the ions are in contact. So that distance should be r_Cs + r_Cl. So a√3/2 = 1.69 + 1.81 = 3.50 Å. So a = (3.50 * 2) / √3. Let me compute that.

3.50 * 2 is 7. So 7 / 1.732 ≈ 4.041 Å. Wait, that would make a around 4.04 Å. Hmm, but I thought CsCl structure has a larger unit cell. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait another approach: perhaps in the CsCl structure, each ion is in contact along the edge, not the face diagonal. Because the coordination number is 8. So the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so the distance along the edge is a, which would be 2*(r_Cs + r_Cl). Because each ion touches along the edge. So a = 2*(1.69 + 1.81) = 2*3.50 = 7.00 Å.

But wait, that would make the diagonal of the cube longer, but perhaps the contact is along the edge. So which is correct?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the structure. In CsCl structure, each ion is at the corner of a cube, and the other ion is in the center. So the edge length would be a, and the distance from corner to center is (a√3)/2. So that distance must equal the sum of the radii. So a√3/2 = r_Cs + r_Cl. So a = 2*(r_Cs + r_Cl) /√3.

Wait, yes. Because the ions are at the corner and center, the distance between them is indeed the space diagonal of a cube with edge a/2. Because from (0,0,0) to (a/2, a/2, a/2) would be a cube of edge a/2. So the space diagonal is (a/2)*√3. So the distance is (a√3)/2. So setting that equal to the sum of the radii.

So a = 2*(r_Cs + r_Cl) /√3.

Plugging in the numbers: (1.69 +1.81) = 3.50. So a = 2 *3.50 / 1.732 ≈ 7.00 / 1.732 ≈ 4.041 Å.

Wait, but then the edge of the unit cell is about 4.041 Å. But wait, the unit cell volume would be a^3, which is (4.041)^3 ≈ let me calculate that.

4^3 is 64, 4.041^3 is approximately 4^3 + 3*(4^2)*0.041 + ... Maybe easier to compute 4.041 *4.041 = approx 16.328 (since 4*4=16, 4*.041=0.164, etc.), then 16.328 *4.041 = approx 16 *4=64, 16 *.041=0.656, 0.328 *4=1.312, 0.328 *0.041≈0.0135. Sum: 64 +0.656 +1.312 +0.0135 ≈ 66. So around 66 Å³.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe a calculator approach would help, but for now, I'll proceed.

So unit cell volume for CsCl is a^3 = (4.041)^3 ≈ 66 Å³.

Now, each unit cell contains one Cs+ and one Cl- ion. So the number of ions per unit cell is 2 (one of each). Each ion contributes a volume of (4/3)πr³.

So the total volume occupied by ions is 2 * (4/3)π (r_Cs³ + r_Cl³).

Wait no: each ion is present once, so it's (4/3)π r_Cs³ for Cs+ and same for Cl-. So sum is (4/3)π (r_Cs³ + r_Cl³).

So let's compute r_Cs = 1.69 Å, r_Cl = 1.81 Å.

Compute each radius cubed.

1.69^3 = approx 1.69 * 1.69 = 2.8561 → 2.8561 *1.69. Let me compute this:

2.8561 *1.69:

2 *1.69=3.38,

0.8561 *1.69 ≈ 1.449.

So total approx 3.38 +1.449 = 4.829. So 1.69^3 ≈ 4.829 Å³.

Cl- radius: 1.81^3. 1.8^3 is 5.832. 0.01 more, so 1.81^3 = (1.8 +0.01)^3. Using binomial approx:

(1.8)^3 + 3*(1.8)^2 *0.01 + 3*(1.8)*(0.01)^2 + (0.01)^3.

=5.832 + 3*(3.24)(0.01) + negligible terms.

=5.832 + 0.0972 = 5.9292 Å³.

So sum is 4.829 +5.9292 ≈10.7582 Å³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: (4/3)*3.1416 ≈4.1888. So 4.1888 *10.7582 ≈45.06 Å³.

So the volume occupied by the ions is ~45.06 Å³.

Unit cell volume is a^3 ≈66 Å³. So the void volume is 66 -45.06 =20.94 Å³.

Fractional void volume is 20.94 /66 ≈0.317, approximately 0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the edge length.

Wait, earlier I thought a is 4.041 Å for CsCl. Wait, but let me re-calculate a from the correct formula. So a = 2*(1.69 +1.81) /√3.

Sum is 3.50. 2*3.50 =7. Divide by √3 ≈1.732. So 7/1.732≈4.041 Å. So a is about 4.041 Å. So a^3 is (4.041)^3.

Let me compute 4^3=64. 4.041^3= (4 +0.041)^3 = 4^3 + 3*4^2 *0.041 + 3*4*(0.041)^2 + (0.041)^3.

Compute each term:

4^3 =64.

3*(4^2)*0.041 = 3*16*0.041 =48 *0.041= approx 1.968.

3*(4)*(0.041)^2= 12*(0.001681)= 0.02017.

(0.041)^3≈0.0000689.

Sum all: 64 +1.968=65.968 +0.02017=65.988 +0.0000689≈65.9887. So a^3 ≈65.9887 Å³, approximately 66.0 Å³.

So unit cell volume is 66.0 Å³.

So back to ion volume. For Cs+ and Cl-: (4/3)π (r_Cs^3 + r_Cl^3) = (4/3)π*(4.829 +5.9292) = (4/3)π*(10.7582) ≈ (4.1888) *10.7582 ≈45.06 Å³.

So void volume is 66 -45.06 =20.94. Fractional void is 20.94/66 ≈0.317 or 31.7%.

Looking at the options, which one for CsCl is about 0.32? Let me check the options. Option C says 0.32 for CsCl. Option I says 0.316. Hmm, but let me proceed with the other compounds and see.

Next, NaCl. It's a face-centered cubic structure for each ion, so rock-salt structure. Each ion has six nearest neighbors. So the unit cell is fcc, with four Na+ and four Cl- ions per unit cell.

In NaCl structure, the unit cell edge length a is determined by the sum of the radii times 2√2 divided by something? Wait, perhaps better to think: in fcc, the anions form an fcc lattice and the cations occupy all the octahedral holes. So along the face diagonal, the sum of the cation and anion radii would be a√2/4 * something.

Wait, no. Let's think: in the NaCl structure, each Na+ is surrounded by Cl- at the face centers. So the edge length a is related to the sum of the ionic radii. Because along the edge, you have a Na+ and a Cl- touching each other with a separation of a/2. Wait no, wait. The face diagonal in the fcc lattice is where the ions touch. Because each Na+ is at the edge center and each Cl- is at the face center. So the distance between Na+ and Cl- along the face diagonal would be 4r, perhaps?

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the structure. In NaCl, each Na+ is at the edge centers and each Cl- is at the face centers. So the distance between Na+ and Cl- would be half the face diagonal. Because from (a/2,0,0) to (a/2,a/2,a/2) is a face diagonal of the face at x=a/2. Wait, maybe a better approach: in the unit cell, the Cl- ions are at the face centers, so their positions are (a/2, a/2, 0), etc. The Na+ ions are at the edge centers, like (0, a/2, a/2), etc. So the distance between a Na+ at (0,a/2, a/2) and a Cl- at (a/2, a/2, 0) would be sqrt[(a/2)^2 +0 + (a/2)^2] = sqrt( (a²/4) + (a²/4) ) = sqrt(a²/2) = a/√2.

But wait, that distance is the sum of the Na+ radius and Cl- radius. So a/√2 = r_Na + r_Cl.

Given r_Na+ is 0.95 Å, Cl- is 1.81 Å. Sum is 2.76 Å. So a = 2.76 *√2 ≈2.76 *1.4142 ≈3.90 Å.

So unit cell edge a ≈3.90 Å. Unit cell volume is a^3 = (3.90)^3. Let me compute that: 3^3=27, 0.9^3=0.729, and cross terms.

But 3.9^3 = (4 - 0.1)^3 = 64 - 3*(16)*(0.1) + 3*(4)*(0.01) - (0.001) → 64 - 4.8 + 0.12 -0.001= 59.319. So 3.9^3≈59.319 Å³.

Now, number of ions per unit cell: 4 Na+ and 4 Cl-, so 8 ions in total. Wait, no. Wait, each unit cell has 4 formula units of NaCl, right? So 4 Na+ and 4 Cl-.

So the volume occupied by the ions is (4 Na+ * volume of Na+ ) + (4 Cl- * volume of Cl- ).

Each Na+ has volume (4/3)π r^3 = (4/3)π (0.95)^3. Let's compute that.

0.95^3 = 0.857375.

(4/3)π *0.857375 ≈4.1888 *0.857375 ≈3.589 Å³ per Na+.

So 4 Na+ contribute 4 *3.589 ≈14.356 Å³.

Cl- radius is 1.81 Å. Volume per Cl- is (4/3)π (1.81)^3. Earlier, I calculated 1.81^3 as 5.9292. So (4/3)π *5.9292 ≈4.1888 *5.9292≈24.82 Å³ per Cl-.

So 4 Cl- contribute 4 *24.82 ≈99.28 Å³.

So total ion volume is 14.356 +99.28≈113.636 Å³.

Unit cell volume is 59.319 Å³. Wait, that can't be, because 113 is larger than 59. That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a minute, wait. NaCl structure has 4 Na+ and 4 Cl- per unit cell, but each ion's volume is added. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, each ion is a separate entity. So the total volume occupied by all ions in the unit cell is 4*(volume of Na+) +4*(volume of Cl-).

Wait, but that would be 4*(4/3 π (0.95)^3 ) +4*(4/3 π (1.81)^3 )

Which is 4*(3.589) +4*(24.82) →14.356 +99.28=113.636 Å³.

But the unit cell volume is only 59.319. That can't be right, since the ion volumes can't exceed the unit cell volume.

Ah, I see my mistake. I think I've mixed up the unit cell parameter. Because in the NaCl structure, the unit cell edge 'a' is determined by the sum of the ionic radii multiplied by √2. Wait, let me re-examine the calculation.

Earlier, I thought that a/√2
