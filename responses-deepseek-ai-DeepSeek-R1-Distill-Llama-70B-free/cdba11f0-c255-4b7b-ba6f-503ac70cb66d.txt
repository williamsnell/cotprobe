Okay, so I've got this question here about company management and the duties of managers. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says: Managers are entrusted to run the company in the best interest of ________. Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of ________ and of _______.

The options are A through J, each with different combinations. I remember from my studies that company managers, especially in corporate law contexts, have certain fiduciary duties. So I think the first blank is probably about whose interests they're supposed to serve.

Wait, I think traditionally, managers are supposed to act in the best interest of the shareholders. That's the classic view. But sometimes it's broader, like stakeholders. Hmm. The question says "best interest of" so I'm leaning towards shareholders because that's the primary duty, but maybe some jurisdictions have moved towards stakeholders. I'm a bit unsure.

Next part: they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company. Then, the other duties are mentioned. I recall that managers have duties like care, skill, and diligence. Oh wait, and also possibly a duty of good faith or self-interest? Wait, no, self-interest might be the opposite. Because managers shouldn't act in their own self-interest but in the company's.

Wait, the main fiduciary duties are care and loyalty. Loyalty would include acting in the best interest, avoiding conflicts of interest. But the question here is breaking it down into duty of... so maybe the other two are care (or skill) and another.

Wait, the options have things like "diligence", "care and skill", "self-interest". So, I think the two duties after the main one are care/skill and maybe another term. Let me think.

In corporate law, managers owe fiduciary duties which include the duty to act in good faith, and the duty of care and skill. Also, sometimes the duty of diligence is mentioned. Or maybe the duty of care encompasses diligence.

Wait, some sources say that the duty of care and skill is one of the primary duties. So perhaps the two blanks are care and skill, and then another term. Alternatively, maybe it's care and then something else.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option F says "Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence". That would make sense if the duties are care, skill, and diligence. But I thought the main duties are care and loyalty, with loyalty including acting in the best interest and avoiding self-dealing.

Alternatively, maybe the two other duties are just care and skill. Wait, the question says "duty of ______ and of _______". So two separate duties. One might be the duty of care and skill, and the other perhaps something else. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that the three parts are: best interest of (shareholders), duty to act for the benefit (which is the company), and then the other two duties. So the first blank is shareholders, then the two duties are care and skill, and another.

Wait, but the question is structured as: "run the company in the best interest of [blank 1]." Then "duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of [blank 2] and of [blank 3]."

So the three blanks are: (1) whom, (2) what duty, (3) another duty.

I think (1) is shareholders. (2) and (3) would be specific duties. In UK company law, directors have a duty to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members (shareholders), and they also have duties of care, skill, and diligence, as well as a duty not to act in a way that conflicts with the company's interest.

Wait, but maybe it's the duty of care and skill (as one) and the duty of good faith (or loyalty), but the options don't include that. Alternatively, perhaps the two duties are care and skill, and then maybe something else.

Looking at option F: Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence. So the first blank is shareholders, then the two duties are care/skill and diligence.

Alternatively, option B: Shareholders, Self-interest, Care and Skill. No, self-interest doesn't make sense because managers shouldn't act in their own self-interest.

Option A: Shareholders, Diligence, Self-interest. Again, self-interest is wrong.

Option C: Stakeholders, Care and skill, Self-interest. Self-interest is wrong here. So probably not C.

Option D: Stakeholders, Diligence, Care and Skill. So stakeholders instead of shareholders. I'm not sure if the first blank is stakeholders. I thought it's typically shareholders, but some modern approaches include stakeholders.

Wait, the question says "entrusted to run the company in the best interest of" — in traditional corporate law, it's the shareholders. But in some jurisdictions or under certain theories, it's the stakeholders. So which is it?

The question might be from a traditional perspective, so I'll go with shareholders for the first blank.

So for the first blank, it's either Shareholders (options A, B, F, G) or Stakeholders (C, D, I, J).

Assuming it's Shareholders, now looking at the middle blanks. The second and third blanks are two duties. The options are:

A: Diligence, Self-interest → No, because self-interest is wrong.

B: Self-interest, Care and Skill → No.

F: Care and Skill, Diligence → So the two duties are care/skill and diligence.

Alternatively, another option is that the two duties are care and skill, and another term. Wait, perhaps the two duties are care and skill, and then another thing. Or maybe it's care (duty of care), skill (duty of skill), and diligence. But the question says two blanks: "duty of" and "of".

Wait, the question says "duty of [blank2] and of [blank3]". So each is a separate duty. So if the two are care and skill, then perhaps that's one duty, but I think care and skill are often presented together as a single duty.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the two duties are care and skill, and another duty. Or maybe care (as a separate duty) and skill (as another), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the two duties are care and loyalty. But I don't see loyalty as an option. So perhaps the other option is that it's care and skill as one, and diligence as another. So in option F, the two blanks are care and skill, and diligence.

Wait, but the way the sentence is structured: "duty of [blank2] and of [blank3]". So if the first is care and skill (as a single term), then the second would be another term, like diligence. So in F, it's Care and Skill, Diligence.

Alternatively, perhaps the first duty is care, and the second is skill, but I don't think so. Because care and skill are often used together.

Wait, another approach: what are the standard duties of a company director or manager? In common law, there's the duty to act bona fide in the interest of the company (which ties into the first blank as shareholders), the duty of care and skill, and the duty not to permit a conflict of interest or profit.

Wait, but the question is phrased as duty of [x] and [y]. So perhaps the two are care and skill, and another.

Wait, maybe the two are care and skill (as one term) and diligence (another). Or perhaps the two are care and diligence. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the first blank is shareholders, and the two duties are care and skill, and something else like honesty. But looking at the options, the other terms are diligence and self-interest.

Wait, self-interest can't be right because that's a conflict. Diligence makes sense as a duty.

So putting it all together, option F says: Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence.

Alternatively, option B has self-interest, which is wrong.

So I think F is the correct answer.

The question asks about the duties of managers in running a company, specifically identifying whose interests they serve and the specific duties they owe. Managers are traditionally entrusted to act in the best interest of **shareholders**, as this is the classic view in corporate law. While some modern approaches consider stakeholders, the question appears to reflect the traditional perspective.

Regarding the duties, managers owe a **duty of care and skill**, which is a well-established principle in corporate law. Additionally, they must act with **diligence**, ensuring they are attentive and responsible in their decision-making. The option that correctly aligns with these principles is:

**Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence.**

This matches **Option F**.

F
