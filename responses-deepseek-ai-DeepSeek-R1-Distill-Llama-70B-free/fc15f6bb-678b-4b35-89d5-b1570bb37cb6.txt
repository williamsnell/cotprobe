Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this biology question here. The question is about which animals maintain a constant body temperature despite changes in environmental temperature. The options given are frog, robin, fish, dog, or lizard. The possible answers are combinations of these animals.

Hmm, I remember that animals are categorized into two main groups based on their thermoregulation: endotherms and ectotherms. Endotherms are warm-blooded, meaning they can maintain a constant body temperature regardless of the environment. Ectotherms are cold-blooded, so their body temperature varies with the environment.

Let me think about each animal. Frogs are amphibians. I think they're ectothermic because they rely on external sources of heat, like the sun. So their body temperature changes with the environment. Fish are also ectothermic; they absorb heat from the water around them. Lizards are reptiles, and reptiles are ectotherms too. They bask in the sun to get warm. 

Now, the robin is a bird, and birds are endothermic. They generate heat internally and maintain a constant body temperature. Dogs are mammals, and mammals are also endothermic. They produce heat through metabolism and have mechanisms like sweating or panting to regulate their temperature.

So the question is asking which animals maintain constant body temperature. That would be the endotherms. Among the options given, robin (bird) and dog (mammal) are endothermic. So the correct pair should include both robin and dog.

Looking at the answer choices, option J says Robin and Dog. That makes sense because both are endotherms. So the answer should be J.

The question asks which animals maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental changes. Endotherms (warm-blooded animals) like birds (robins) and mammals (dogs) achieve this, while ectotherms (cold-blooded animals) such as frogs, fish, and lizards do not. Among the options, only the robin and dog are endotherms.
