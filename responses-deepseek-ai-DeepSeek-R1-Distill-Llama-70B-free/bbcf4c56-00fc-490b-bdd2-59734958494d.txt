Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question says that a real number x is chosen at random in the interval [0, 3], and another real number y is chosen at random in [0, 4]. I need to find the probability that x < y. Hmm, alright.

Alright, so both x and y are chosen uniformly from their respective intervals. That means every number in [0,3] for x and [0,4] for y has an equal chance of being selected. So the probability is basically the area where x < y divided by the total area of all possible (x,y) pairs.

Wait, right, since x and y are continuous variables, we can model this situation geometrically. The sample space is a rectangle in the xy-plane where x ranges from 0 to 3 and y from 0 to 4. So the rectangle has a width of 3 and a height of 4, making the total area 3*4=12.

Now, the event we're interested in is x < y. So I need to find the area of the region within this rectangle where y is greater than x. Let me visualize this. The line y = x would run diagonally through the rectangle from (0,0) to (3,3), but wait, y can go up to 4, while x stops at 3. So beyond x=3, y continues up to 4, but since x can't go beyond 3, that part is just a rectangle from x=3 to x=3 (which is nothing, so maybe I should think differently).

Wait, no, the region where y > x would be above the line y = x up to y=4. But since x only goes up to 3, the line y=x stops at (3,3). Beyond that, for x from 0 to 3, y can go up to 4, but for x=3, y can go from 3 to 4, but wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Actually, the region where y > x would be the area above the line y = x within the rectangle.

So to calculate this area, I can split it into two parts. From x=0 to x=3, the line y=x goes from (0,0) to (3,3). So above this line, y ranges from x to 4 for each x in [0,3]. Wait no, that's not quite right. Because for each x in [0,3], y can go up to 4, but the condition is y > x. So for each x, y starts at x and goes up to 4. But wait, when x is less than 4, which it always is since x ≤3, that's fine.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. The rectangle goes from x=0 to x=3 and y=0 to y=4. The line y=x goes from (0,0) to (3,3). So the area where y > x is the area above this line within the rectangle. But beyond x=3, the line doesn't exist, but our rectangle ends at x=3. So the region where y > x is a triangle from (0,0) to (3,3), and then a rectangle from x=0 to x=3 and y=3 to y=4. Wait, no. Because for each x from 0 to 3, y can go from x to 4. So the area is the integral from x=0 to x=3 of (4 - x) dx.

Yes, that makes sense. So the area where y > x is the integral of (4 - x) dx from 0 to 3. Let's compute that. The integral of 4 dx is 4x, and the integral of x dx is (1/2)x². So the area is [4x - (1/2)x²] evaluated from 0 to 3.

Plugging in x=3: 4*(3) =12, (1/2)*(3)^2=4.5, so 12 -4.5=7.5. At x=0, it's 0. So the area is 7.5.

Wait, but the total area of the sample space is 3*4=12. So the probability would be 7.5 /12. Let's compute that. 7.5 divided by 12 is the same as 75/120, which simplifies to 5/8. Wait, 7.5 is 15/2, so 15/2 divided by 12 is 15/(2*12)=15/24=5/8. So 5/8 is 0.625. Checking the options, option I is 5/8. So is that the answer?

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes visualizing helps. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of geometry. The area where y > x is a combination of a right triangle and a rectangle. From x=0 to x=3, the line y=x cuts the rectangle into two parts. The area above the line is a right triangle with base 3 and height 3, so area (1/2)*3*3=4.5. Then, from y=3 to y=4, for all x from 0 to3, y is greater than x, so that's a rectangle of height 1 (from y=3 to y=4) and width 3, area 3*1=3. So total area is 4.5 +3=7.5, which matches what I got earlier. So 7.5 divided by 12 is indeed 5/8. So the probability is 5/8, which is option I.

To determine the probability that \( x < y \) when \( x \) is chosen randomly from the interval \([0, 3]\) and \( y \) is chosen randomly from the interval \([0, 4]\), we model the problem geometrically. The sample space is represented as a rectangle in the \( xy \)-plane with \( x \) ranging from 0 to 3 and \( y \) ranging from 0 to 4. The total area of this rectangle is:

\[
\text{Total Area} = 3 \times 4 = 12.
\]

The event \( x < y \) corresponds to the region above the line \( y = x \) within this rectangle. To calculate the area of this region, we split it into two parts:

1. **Triangle**: From \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 3 \), the line \( y = x \) divides the rectangle. The area above this line forms a right triangle with base 3 and height 3:
   \[
   \text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 3 = 4.5.
   \]

2. **Rectangle**: From \( y = 3 \) to \( y = 4 \), \( y > x \) is always true for all \( x \) in \([0, 3]\). This forms a rectangle with height 1 (from \( y = 3 \) to \( y = 4 \)) and width 3:
   \[
   \text{Area of Rectangle} = 3 \times 1 = 3.
   \]

The total area where \( x < y \) is the sum of these two areas:
\[
\text{Total Area Where } x < y = 4.5 + 3 = 7.5.
\]

The probability is then the ratio of this area to the total area of the sample space:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{7.5}{12} = \frac{5}{8}.
\]

Thus, the probability that \( x < y \) is \( \frac{5}{8} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
