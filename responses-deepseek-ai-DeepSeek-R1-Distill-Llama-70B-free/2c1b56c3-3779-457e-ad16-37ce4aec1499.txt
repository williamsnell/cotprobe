Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says there are nine bags of bird feed in the storage room. Then, more bags are being delivered on different days of the week. I need to find out the total number of bags by the end of the week.

Alright, so the initial number is 9 bags. Then, each day from Monday to Friday, different amounts are being added. Let me list out the numbers:

- Monday: 17 bags
- Tuesday: 22 bags
- Wednesday: 3 bags
- Thursday: 11 bags
- Friday: 18 bags

I think I need to add all these together, including the initial 9 bags. Let me write this down as a sum.

Total = 9 + 17 + 22 + 3 + 11 + 18

Now, I'll start adding them one by one. Maybe I can do this in parts to avoid mistakes.

First, add the initial 9 bags to Monday's delivery: 9 + 17. Let's see, 9 plus 10 is 19, plus 7 is 26. So that's 26 so far.

Next, add Tuesday's 22 bags. 26 + 22. Hmm, 20 + 20 is 40, and 6 + 2 is 8, so 40 +8 is 48. So now we're at 48.

Then, add Wednesday's 3 bags. 48 +3 is 51. Easy enough.

Thursday brings 11 bags. 51 +11. Let me think, 51 +10 is 61, plus 1 is 62. So now it's 62.

Finally, Friday's delivery of 18 bags. 62 +18. 60 +18 is 78, plus 2 is 80. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 62 + 18. Let me do it another way: 62 +10 is 72, plus 8 is 80. So total is 80 bags.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in adding. Let me add all the numbers again, just to be sure.

Let me stack them up:

9
17
22
3
11
18
---
Let's add them column by column.

Starting from the right (units place):

9: 9
17:7
22:2
3:3
11:1
18:8
Adding the units: 9+7=16, +2=18, +3=21, +1=22, +8=30. So units place is 0, carry over 3.

Now the tens place:

9:0 (since it's a single digit)
17:1
22:2
3:0
11:1
18:1
Adding tens: 0+1=1, +2=3, +0=3, +1=4, +1=5. Then add the carried-over 3, making it 8.

So the total is 80. So the answer should be 80.

Looking at the options, option D is 80. So I think the correct answer is D.

To determine the total number of bags of bird feed by the end of the week, we start with the initial 9 bags and add the deliveries from each day:

\[
\text{Total} = 9 + 17 + 22 + 3 + 11 + 18
\]

Adding step-by-step:

1. \(9 + 17 = 26\)
2. \(26 + 22 = 48\)
3. \(48 + 3 = 51\)
4. \(51 + 11 = 62\)
5. \(62 + 18 = 80\)

Thus, the total number of bags is **80**. The correct answer is **D**.
