Question:

Occasionally a boy is born withundescendedtestes (cryptorchidism), and he will be sterile unless they are surgically caused to descend into the scrotum. Explain the reason for this.

Options:

A: Human sperm cannot develop at the high temperature found within the body cavity.
B: The testes require the lower pressure environment of the scrotum for sperm maturation
C: Testes must be in the scrotum to properly attach to the vas deferens
D: The scrotum provides the necessary nutrients for sperm development
E: Gravity is required for the testes to function properly
F: Undescended testes result in hormonal imbalances that prevent sperm production
G: The testes need to be in the scrotum for aesthetic reasons
H: Undescended testes can lead to cancer
I: The scrotum is the only place where the testes can receive oxygen
J: Testes descend into the scrotum to make room for other organs

Okay, so I've got this question about undescended testes and why a boy born with that condition would be sterile unless the testes are moved into the scrotum. Hmm, I remember a bit from biology class about this. Let me think through it.

So, the question is asking why cryptorchidism leads to sterility. The options are A through J, but I'll focus on the reasoning first.

I recall that testes are located in the scrotum, which is outside the abdominal cavity. The main reason for this has to do with temperature. Sperm development, or spermatogenesis, requires a specific temperature that's slightly lower than the body's internal temperature. The scrotum helps regulate this by being outside, so the temperature stays optimal for sperm production.

If the testes don't descend into the scrotum, they remain inside the abdominal cavity. The body's internal temperature is higher than what's ideal for sperm development. So the sperm might not develop properly, leading to sterility. That makes sense because high temperatures can interfere with the process, maybe even damage the sperm cells.

Looking at the options, option A says that human sperm cannot develop at the high temperature in the body. That seems to align with what I was thinking. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option B talks about lower pressure in the scrotum. I don't remember pressure being a factor in sperm maturation. It's more about temperature, so B might not be right.

Option C says testes must attach to the vas deferens. I think the vas deferens does connect to the testes, but if the testes are undescended, maybe the connection isn't made. But I'm not sure if that's the primary reason for sterility. Maybe obstruction could cause issues, but I think the main issue is temperature.

Option D: Scrotum provides nutrients. No, the bloodstream provides nutrients, not the location. So D doesn't seem correct.

Option E: Gravity required. I'm not sure. I don't think gravity affects testicular function in that way. It's more about temperature regulation.

Option F: Hormonal imbalances. Well, if the testes aren't in the right place, could that affect hormone production? Testes produce testosterone, so maybe if they're not functioning correctly because of the temperature, hormone levels might drop. But I think the primary issue is the temperature affecting sperm development, not the hormones preventing production. So F might not be the best answer.

Option G: Aesthetic reasons. That's definitely not the reason. It's a medical necessity, not just about looks.

Option H: Undescended testes can lead to cancer. I've heard that having undescended testes increases the risk of testicular cancer, but that's a separate issue from sterility. So H explains a different problem, not the reason for sterility.

Option I: Only place for oxygen. No, the testes receive oxygen via the bloodstream regardless of their location, so I is not correct.

Option J: Make room for other organs. That doesn't make sense. Organs can function in their usual places even if the testes are descended.

So, the best answer seems to be option A. The high temperature inside the body cavity prevents proper sperm development, leading to sterility unless the testes are moved to the scrotum.
</think>

The condition of undescended testes, or cryptorchidism, leads to sterility if left untreated because the high internal body temperature is not suitable for proper sperm development. Spermatogenesis requires a temperature slightly lower than the body's core temperature, which the scrotum regulates by being outside the abdominal cavity. If the testes remain inside, the elevated temperature can impair sperm production, resulting in sterility. Among the options provided, option A correctly identifies that human sperm cannot develop at the high temperature found within the body cavity.

Answer: A
