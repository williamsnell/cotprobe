Okay, so I have this problem here about a television that sells for $226.50, and the markup is 30% based on the cost. I need to find the cost. Hmm, let me think about how markups work.

Okay, markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. I remember that markup percentage can be calculated based on cost or selling price, but this problem says it's based on cost. So, the formula I think is: Selling Price = Cost + Markup. And since the markup is 30% of the cost, the selling price should be cost plus 30% of cost, which is 1.3 times the cost.

So, if I let the cost be C, then the selling price is C multiplied by 1.3. The selling price given is $226.50, so I can set up the equation like 226.50 = 1.3 * C. To find C, I need to divide both sides by 1.3.

Let me do the math. 226.50 divided by 1.3. I can do this step by step. 226 divided by 1.3... Well, 1.3 times 174 is 226.2, because 1.3 * 170 is 221, and 1.3*4 is 5.2, so 221+5.2 is 226.2. So 1.3*174=226.2, but the selling price is 226.50, which is 0.3 more. So maybe I need to adjust.

Wait, maybe I should just use a calculator approach. 226.5 divided by 1.3. Let me think, 1.3 goes into 226.5 how many times. Let me write it out:

226.50 รท 1.3 = ?

Well, 1.3 times 100 is 130. So 226.50 is about 1.74 times that. Wait, maybe another approach: 226.50 / 1.3.

Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to get rid of the decimal: 2265 รท 13.

So 13 times 174 is 2262, because 13 times 170 is 2210, and 13*4=52, so 2210+52=2262. Then 2265 -2262 is 3, so that's 3/13 left, which is approximately 0.2307. So 174.2307, which is about $174.23. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option D is $174.23. So that should be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might get confused between markup on cost and markup on selling price.

Wait, the problem says the markup is 30% based on the cost, which matches what I did. So yes, selling price is 130% of cost, so dividing by 1.3 is correct. So the cost is approximately $174.23.

To determine the cost of the television when the selling price is $226.50 and the markup is 30% based on the cost, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost} \times (1 + \text{Markup Percentage})
\]

Here, the markup is 30%, so:

\[
226.50 = \text{Cost} \times 1.3
\]

Solving for the cost:

\[
\text{Cost} = \frac{226.50}{1.3}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Cost} \approx 174.23
\]

Thus, the cost of the television is approximately **$174.23**, which corresponds to option D.
