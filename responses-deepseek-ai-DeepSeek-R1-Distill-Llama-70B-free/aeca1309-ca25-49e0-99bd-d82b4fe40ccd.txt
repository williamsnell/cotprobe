Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about protons hitting a target and causing the temperature to rise. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

First, let me read the question again carefully. So, we've got protons with a certain mass and velocity striking a target. The target has a given mass and specific heat capacity. There's a current involved, and part of the protons' energy is converted into heat. I need to find the rate at which the target's temperature rises initially.

Alright, the given data:

- Mass of each proton, m = 1.67e-27 kg
- Velocity, v = 2e7 m/s
- Target mass, M = 1 gram = 0.001 kg (wait, no, 1 gram is 0.001 kg? No wait, 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 1 gram is 0.001 kg. Yeah.)
- Specific heat capacity, c = 0.334 cal/(g·°C)
- Current, I = 4.8 microamps = 4.8e-6 A
- Fraction of energy converted to heat, f = 1/3

I think the key here is to find the power delivered by the protons and then see how much of that goes into heating the target. Then, using the specific heat, find the rate of temperature change.

So power is energy per second. The energy comes from the kinetic energy of the protons. Each proton has kinetic energy (1/2)mv². The number of protons per second is current divided by the charge per proton.

Wait, right. Current is charge per second, so number of protons per second (n) would be I / e, where e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.6e-19 coulombs.

So let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the kinetic energy per proton: KE = 0.5 * m * v²
2. Find the number of protons per second (n) using n = I / e
3. Multiply KE by n to get the total power delivered by all protons per second (but wait, only a third of this energy is converted to heat, so multiply by 1/3)
4. Use the specific heat formula: Power (heating) = m_target * c * (dT/dt)
   So solving for dT/dt gives (Power) / (m_target * c)
5. Make sure all units are consistent, especially with calories and joules.

Wait, the specific heat is given in cal/(g·°C), and mass is in grams, but the SI units are in kg. So I need to be careful with unit conversions.

Let me start with step 1: KE per proton.

KE = 0.5 * m * v²
m = 1.67e-27 kg
v = 2e7 m/s

So KE = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * (2e7)^2

Calculating that: 2e7 squared is 4e14. Multiply by 1.67e-27: 1.67e-27 * 4e14 = 6.68e-13. Then multiply by 0.5: 3.34e-13 J per proton.

Step 2: Number of protons per second.

n = I / e

I = 4.8e-6 A
e = 1.6e-19 C

n = 4.8e-6 / 1.6e-19 = 3e13 protons per second.

Wait, let me compute that:

4.8e-6 / 1.6e-19 = (4.8/1.6) * 1e13 = 3 * 1e13 = 3e13 protons/s.

Step 3: Total power before considering the fraction.

Power = KE * n = 3.34e-13 J/proton * 3e13 protons/s = 10.02 J/s. So about 10 Watts.

But wait, only one-third goes into heat, so the heating power P = (1/3)*10.02 ≈ 3.34 Watts.

Now, step 4: Using specific heat to find dT/dt.

The formula for power (heating) is P = m * c * (dT/dt)

We have P = 3.34 W.

m is the target mass, given as 1g = 0.001 kg? Wait, no, wait. No, 1g is 0.001 kg, but wait, wait! Specific heat capacity is given in cal/(g·°C). So the mass should be in grams when using this c.

Wait, let me think: c is 0.334 cal/(g·°C), and the mass is 1g. So m = 1g, c = 0.334 cal/(g·°C), P is in watts (which is joules per second).

But wait, the units have to match. So I need to convert the power from watts (J/s) to calories per second.

Because 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So 1 Watt = 1 J/s = 1/4.184 cal/s ≈ 0.2388 cal/s.

So P_heating is 3.34 W = 3.34 * 0.2388 cal/s ≈ 0.798 cal/s.

Wait, let me compute that exactly: 3.34 * 0.2388 is approximately 3.34 * 0.24 ≈ 0.8 cal/s.

So P = 0.8 cal/s.

Now, using P = m * c * (dT/dt), solve for dT/dt.

m = 1g, c = 0.334 cal/(g·°C)

So dT/dt = P / (m * c) = (0.8 cal/s) / (1g * 0.334 cal/(g·°C)) )

Compute denominator: 1 * 0.334 = 0.334.

So 0.8 / 0.334 ≈ 2.39 °C per second.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

0.8 divided by 0.334.

0.8 / 0.334 ≈ 2.394 ... So approximately 2.39 °C/s.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.39°C, but wait, the unit in the options says "per second" for some. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 0.8°C per second

B: 1.5°C

C: 3.2°C

D: 3.6°C per second

E: 0.5°C per second

F: 2.8°C per second

G: 1.2°C

H: 1.0°C per second

I: 4.5°C per second

J: 2.39°C

Wait, option J is 2.39°C, but the question asks for the rate, so per second. So J doesn't have 'per second' in the option, but the correct answer would be about 2.39°C per second.

Wait, looking at the options, option J says 2.39°C, but the question asks for the rate, which is per second. So perhaps the correct option is J, but perhaps not. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me go through the steps again.

So step 3: Power from protons is 10.02 W, but only 1/3 is heat, so 3.34 W.

Convert 3.34 W to calories per second: 3.34 J/s * (1 cal / 4.184 J) = 3.34 / 4.184 cal/s ≈ 0.798 cal/s.

So P = 0.798 cal/s.

Then, dT/dt = P / (m*c) = 0.798 / (1 * 0.334) = approx 2.39 °C/s.

So the rate is 2.39 degrees per second, which would correspond to option J: 2.39°C, but J's option is missing the 'per second' part. Wait, looking back, no, the options have some with per second and some without. Let me see.

The options are:

A: 0.8°C per second

B: 1.5°C

C: 3.2°C

D: 3.6°C per second

E: 0.5°C per second

F: 2.8°C per second

G: 1.2°C

H: 1.0°C per second

I: 4.5°C per second

J: 2.39°C

So J is in °C, not per second, which is confusing because the question asks for the rate, which is per second. So maybe I made a mistake, perhaps in the unit conversion.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the power calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 3.34 W is correct for P_heating.

But when converting to cal/s: 1 W = 1 J/s = 0.239 cal/s (since 1 cal ≈ 4.184 J).

So 3.34 W = 3.34 * 0.239 cal/s ≈ 0.798 cal/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Then, using P = m c dT/dt.

m is 1g, c is 0.334 cal/(g°C).

So dT/dt = P / (m c) = 0.798 / (1 * 0.334) ≈ 2.39 °C/s.

So the correct rate is approximately 2.39 °C per second.

Looking at the options, the closest is J, which is 2.39°C, but without the 'per second'. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should check if I considered the target's mass correctly. Oh wait, the target's mass is 1 gram, yes, so m=1g. Specific heat is per gram, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the current is given in microamps, which I correctly converted to 4.8e-6 A.

Wait, let's recalculate the number of protons per second.

I = 4.8e-6 A. Charge per proton is e=1.6e-19 C.

Number of protons per second, n = I/e = 4.8e-6 / 1.6e-19 = 3e13 protons/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Each proton's KE: 0.5 * m * v².

m=1.67e-27 kg, v=2e7 m/s.

v squared is (2e7)^2 =4e14.

0.5 * 1.67e-27 *4e14 = 0.5 * 6.68e-13 = 3.34e-13 J per proton.

Multiply by n=3e13 protons/s: 3.34e-13 *3e13 = 10 J/s, so 10 W.

One third is 3.333 W, which is 3.333 J/s.

Convert to calories: 3.333 /4.184 ≈ 0.797 cal/s.

Yes, correct.

So dT/dt is 0.797 / (1 * 0.334) = approximately 2.39 °C/s.

So the correct answer would be 2.39°C per second, which isn't directly listed as an option with 'per second' except perhaps option J, but J is written as 2.39°C, without the unit.

Wait, looking again, option F is 2.8°C per second, which is higher than our value. Option J is 2.39°C, but perhaps the question expects just the number, and the 'per second' is implied in the question.

Wait, the question says, "at what rate does the temperature... rise", so the unit should be per second, but the options don't all have units. Hmm, perhaps the options are all per second. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.8°C per second

B: 1.5°C → this is just degrees, not per second.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps option J is correct, despite the missing unit, assuming that the answer expects just the numerical value with the unit understood.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the specific heat capacity units. The specific heat is given in cal/(g·°C), so when I multiply by mass in grams, it's correct.

Another thing: the target's mass is 1g, which is 0.001 kg, but since c is in cal/(g·°C), using grams is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute everything again step by step.

1. KE per proton: (1/2)mv² = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 kg * (2e7 m/s)^2

Compute v²: (2e7)^2 =4e14 m²/s²

So 0.5 * 1.67e-27 *4e14 = 0.5 * 6.68e-13 = 3.34e-13 J.

2. Number of protons per second: I/e =4.8e-6 A / 1.6e-19 C = 3e13 protons/s.

3. Total energy per second (power): 3.34e-13 J/proton *3e13 protons/s = 10 W.

4. Heat power: 1/3 of 10 W = 3.333 W.

5. Convert 3.333 W to cal/s: 3.333 J/s * (1 cal /4.184 J) ≈0.797 cal/s.

6. Using P = m c dT/dt → dT/dt = P/(m c) = 0.797 cal/s / (1g *0.334 cal/(g·°C)) ) → 0.797 /0.334 ≈2.39 °C/s.

So the rate is 2.39 °C per second. Looking at the options, option J is 2.39°C, but without 'per second'. Other options with 'per second' are A, D, E, F, H, I.

Wait, none of the other options match 2.39. So perhaps the correct answer is J, assuming that the missing 'per second' is a typo or that the options all imply per second.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of protons or the energy.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the number of protons again.

I = 4.8 microamps =4.8e-6 A.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

n = I/e =4.8e-6 / 1.6e-19 = 3e13 protons per second. That's correct.

Each proton's KE: 0.5 *1.67e-27 kg*(2e7)^2.

Compute (2e7)^2 =4e14.

0.5 *1.67e-27 *4e14 = 0.5 *6.68e-13 = 3.34e-13 J.

Multiply by n: 3.34e-13 *3e13 = 10 J/s. Correct.

So 10 W, 1/3 is 3.333 W.

Converting to calories per second: 3.333 /4.184 ≈0.797 cal/s.

Then dT/dt = 0.797 / (1 *0.334) ≈2.39 °C/s.

So the correct answer is 2.39°C per second, which would correspond to option J if it had the per second unit. Since the options don't specify, but option J is 2.39°C, I think that's the intended answer.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 2.8°C per second, which is close to 2.39 but not exactly. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps in the specific heat conversion. Let me check that again.

Wait, the power in J/s is 3.333 W.

To convert to cal/s: 3.333 /4.184 = approximately 0.797 cal/s.

Yes, correct.

Then, P = m c dT/dt → 0.797 cal/s = (1g)(0.334 cal/g°C) (dT/dt).

So dT/dt = 0.797 / 0.334 ≈ 2.39 °C/s.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be 2.39°C per second. Among the options, J is 2.39°C, but it's missing the per second. However, all the options that have per second don't match. So perhaps the intended answer is J, and the 'per second' was omitted in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the beginning steps.

Wait, another possible error: Did I correctly compute the kinetic energy?

KE = ½ mv² = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 kg * (2e7 m/s)^2.

Let me compute that again.

v is 2e7 m/s → squared is 4e14.

Multiply by 1.67e-27: 4e14 *1.67e-27 = 6.68e-13.

Multiply by 0.5: 3.34e-13 J. Correct.

Number of protons: 4.8e-6 A /1.6e-19 C = 3e13 protons/s. Correct.

Power: 3.34e-13 *3e13 = 10 W. Correct.

So I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 2.39°C per second, which is option J.

To determine the rate at which the temperature of the target initially rises, we analyze the energy transfer from the proton stream to the target. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Kinetic Energy per Proton**:  
   The kinetic energy of a single proton is given by:  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]  
   Substituting \(m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\) and \(v = 2 \times 10^7 \, \text
