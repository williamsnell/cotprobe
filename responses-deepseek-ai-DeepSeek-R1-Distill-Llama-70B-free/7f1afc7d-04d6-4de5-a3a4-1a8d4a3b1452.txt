Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 5 + 2 • 15 + (12 • 4). And I need to figure out what the value is from the given options. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that in math problems, there's an order of operations to follow. I think it's called PEMDAS—Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction. So I should solve the parts inside the parentheses first, right?

Looking at the problem, I see a set of parentheses: (12 • 4). Oh, wait, the • symbol usually stands for multiplication, so 12 multiplied by 4. Let me calculate that. 12 times 4 is 48. Okay, so that part simplifies to 48. Now, I can rewrite the problem without the parentheses: 5 + 2 • 15 + 48.

Next, I think about the multiplication. There's another multiplication here: 2 • 15. So 2 times 15 is 30. Now the problem becomes 5 + 30 + 48.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm following the order correctly. After parentheses, I handle multiplication and division from left to right. So I did the 2*15 first because it's next in line after the parentheses. That seems right.

Now the equation is down to 5 + 30 + 48. Now I can add these together. Let's start with 5 plus 30. That's 35. Then, adding 48 to 35. Hmm, 35 plus 40 is 75, and then plus 8 more makes 83. Wait, but looking at the options, J is 83. Oh, wait but wait, let me double-check because sometimes I make mistakes.

Wait, did I do everything correctly? Let me go through each step again. The original problem was 5 + 2*15 + (12*4). Parentheses first: 12*4=48, so the problem becomes 5 + 2*15 + 48. Then multiplication comes next: 2*15=30. Now the problem is 5 + 30 +48. Adding those together: 5+30 is 35, plus 48 is 83. Yeah, that's correct.

But wait, looking at the options, J is 83. But wait another thought: I might have missed something. Did I handle the order correctly? Because sometimes I get confused with the multiplication and addition order. Oh, no, because multiplication comes before addition, so I had to do the 2*15 before adding the 5 and 48. So that part was right.

Alternatively, maybe I should visualize it:

5 + (2*15) + (12*4)
= 5 + 30 + 48
= (5+30) +48
=35 +48=83.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be J:83.

Wait, but let me check the options again to make sure. The options are from A to J. Option J is 83. So that's the correct choice.

The problem is solved by following the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. **Parentheses first**: Calculate \(12 \cdot 4 = 48\).
2. **Multiplication next**: Calculate \(2 \cdot 15 = 30\).
3. **Addition**: Combine all terms: \(5 + 30 + 48 = 83\).

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 83**.
