Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about the percentage of people in the United States who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013. The options are A through J, each with different percentages.

I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm not exactly sure of the exact statistic, but I remember that public trust in political institutions, including parties, has been a topic of discussion. Maybe I can think through this step by step.

First, I recall that around the 2010s, there was a lot of political polarization and some high-profile scandals, which might have influenced public opinion. Also, I think that trust in government and political parties has been declining over the years.

I remember hearing something about a Gallup poll around that time. Wait, I think in 2013, there was a significant percentage, maybe around 60% or so, who viewed political parties as corrupt. But I'm not certain.

Let me consider the options given: the highest option is G at 96%, which seems way too high. H is 90%, I is 86%, and J is 76%. These all seem high, but I'm not sure if the number was that elevated in 2013.

Wait, perhaps it's lower. Maybe around 50-60%? Looking back, I think in 2013, a lot of people were dissatisfied with both major parties due to issues like the government shutdown or other political gridlocks. So maybe the number was higher than 50%.

I think the figure was around 60-something percent. Let me think about other sources. Maybe a Pew Research study? I'm trying to recall. Alternatively, I might have come across a figure where about 60% of Americans saw political parties as having a negative impact.

Looking at the options, F is 56%, which is in the mid-50s. C is 66%, which is 2/3. J is 76%, which is 3/4. I'm trying to decide between these.

Wait, another angle: I remember a survey where about 64% of Americans believed that the two major parties were doing such a poor job that a third party was needed. But that's about the need for a third party, not directly about corruption. However, it does suggest a high level of dissatisfaction.

If a significant portion thought a third party was needed, maybe a similar percentage viewed the existing parties as corrupt. So could it be 66%? That's option C.

Alternatively, maybe it's a bit lower. I think in 2013, the Gallup poll on confidence in institutions showed that Congress had a very low rating, which might tie into corruption perceptions.

Wait, another thought: I think in some years, the percentage of people who see political parties as corrupt has been around 60-70%. So 66% would fit into that range. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's lower. I remember that in some surveys, around half of the population had negative views, but I'm not certain about the exact figure.

Wait, let me think about another angle. The question is about corruption, not just dissatisfaction. So perhaps the percentage is a bit lower than dissatisfaction but still significant.

If in 2013, about 56% thought political parties were corrupt, that's option F. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to remember specific data points. I think in 2013, a Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans believed that the government is corrupt. But that's government overall, not just political parties.

Wait, maybe it's the same ballpark. So if 60% think the government is corrupt, perhaps a bit less, say 56%, think the parties are corrupt. Or maybe a bit more, like 66%.

Alternatively, I recall that in the 2010s, the number of people identifying as independents was rising, which suggests dissatisfaction with both parties, but again, not directly about corruption.

Another approach: process of elimination. The options are 36,46,66,26,16,56,96,90,86,76.

I think 96% is too high, so G is out. 90% and 86% also seem too high for this context. 76% is possible but maybe a bit high.

So possible options are C (66), F (56), B (46), and A (36). I think it's higher than 46, so maybe C or F.

Wait, I think I've heard that around two-thirds of Americans view political parties as corrupt. So 66% would make sense, which is option C.

Alternatively, I'm mixing it up with another survey. But I'm going to go with C:66%.
