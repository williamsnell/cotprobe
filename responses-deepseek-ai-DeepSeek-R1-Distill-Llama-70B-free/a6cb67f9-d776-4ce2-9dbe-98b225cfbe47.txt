Okay, so I've got this fluid dynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says the flow is steady and inviscid. Hmm, right, so in fluid dynamics, steady flow means that the properties don't change with time, so everything is in equilibrium. Inviscid means the fluid has zero viscosity, so there's no shear stress, right? So we can ignore any viscous effects here.

The problem says that u is a function of x, u = u(x), and v and w are zero. Oh wait, that means the flow is only in the x-direction, and it varies with x, but not with y or z. So it's a one-dimensional flow along the x-axis.

We need to calculate the velocity u in terms of the pressure p. The options are given from A to J. So I need to find the right expression for u using the given conditions.

I remember that for inviscid, steady flow, Bernoulli's equation should apply. Bernoulli's equation relates the pressure, velocity, and height at two points along a streamline. But wait, since the flow is steady and the equation is applied along a streamline, and in this case, the flow is only in the x-direction, maybe we can apply it here.

But wait, in this problem, are we considering any change in elevation? Because if so, the gravitational term will come into play. The problem doesn't specify, but the presence of 'gz' terms in the options suggests that there's a vertical component, so maybe we're considering a situation where the fluid is moving in the x-direction but has some elevation z as well.

Wait, but wait. If the velocity components v and w are zero, does that mean there's no motion in y and z? So if it's moving in x only, is there any change in height? Hmm, maybe we're looking at a horizontal flow, but perhaps the pressure varies with height, or maybe the pipe is inclined. Not sure, but let's proceed.

So Bernoulli's equation in steady, incompressible, inviscid flow is:

p + (1/2)ρu² + ρgz = constant

Where p is the pressure, ρ is the density, u is the velocity, g is gravity, and z is the height.

Wait, but in this problem, since the flow is along x and u varies with x, maybe each point along the x-axis has a different height z(x)? Or is the height uniform? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but looking at the answer options, they have terms of gz. So maybe there's a vertical component to the flow's path, so that as x changes, z changes as well. Alternatively, maybe it's a vertical flow, but that doesn't fit with u being along x. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a horizontal flow, so z is constant, but that would eliminate the gz term. But since some options have that term, perhaps the flow is in a vertical plane where both x and z are varying, but the velocity is purely in x. That is, maybe the pipe is inclined, so that moving in x-direction also changes the height z.

Wait, but if u is the only non-zero velocity component, then perhaps the streamline is at an angle, and z is a function of x. So as the fluid moves along x, its height z changes, hence contributing to the Bernoulli equation.

So applying Bernoulli's equation between two points along the flow. Let's say, for a small element of fluid moving along x. But since the flow is steady, the equation should hold for any two points.

But wait, in this case, since it's a one-dimensional flow varying with x, maybe the equation simplifies. Let's think about a small control volume.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since the flow is inviscid and steady, and considering the velocity is only in the x-direction, maybe we can apply the Euler equation in the x-direction.

Euler's equation for inviscid flow in the x-direction is:

∂p/∂x + ρ g (dz/dx) = 0

Wait, no, Euler's equation is more general. Let me recall: Euler's equation in the x-direction is:

- ∂p/∂x = ρ ( ∂u/∂t + u ∂u/∂x + v ∂u/∂y + w ∂u/∂z )

But since the flow is steady, the time derivative ∂u/∂t is zero. Also, v and w are zero, and u is a function of x only. So the equation simplifies to:

- ∂p/∂x = ρ u (du/dx )

Wait, because the other terms (v and w) are zero, and u is only a function of x, so ∂u/∂y is zero, and ∂u/∂z is zero, right?

So the Euler equation becomes:

- ∂p/∂x = ρ u du/dx 

Hmm, that's the same as:

dp/dx = - ρ u du/dx 

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the signs. Let me think again. The Euler equation in vector form is:

ρ ( ∂V/∂t + (V·∇) V ) = - ∇p - ρ g 

Assuming that gravity is acting in the negative z-direction. So for the x-component, in steady flow, it becomes:

ρ u (du/dx) = - dp/dx 

So rearranged:

dp/dx = - ρ u (du/dx)

Hmm, but I'm not sure where this is leading me. Maybe I should stick with Bernoulli's equation since the flow is along a streamline.

Wait, Bernoulli's equation is for a streamline, which in this case is along the x-direction, but if the streamline is not horizontal, then the height z is a function of x. So maybe we can write the Bernoulli equation as:

p + (1/2) ρ u² + ρ g z = constant 

If the flow is along a streamline that changes with x, then z is a function of x. But without knowing more about the geometry, it's a bit tough. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a horizontal flow, so z is constant, and thus the gravitational term is the same everywhere, so it can be incorporated into the pressure term. But since the answer options include gz, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but the problem says that the flow is steady and inviscid, and u is a function of x, v and w are zero. So we're looking for an expression that relates u and p, considering perhaps elevation changes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a balance between pressure gradient and gravitational force. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about forces. For a small fluid element moving along x, the net force in the x-direction would cause acceleration. But since the flow is steady, the acceleration is zero. So the sum of forces equals zero.

The forces on the fluid element would be:

1. Pressure gradient force: The difference in pressure across the element. Since pressure p varies with x, the force is -dp/dx * volume.

2. Gravitational force: ρ g z * volume, acting downward. But if the fluid element is moving in x and z is its height, then the gravitational force component in the x-direction depends on whether the flow is horizontal or sloping.

Wait, if the fluid is moving along a surface that's inclined, then the gravitational force would have a component along x. But the problem doesn't mention the orientation of the flow. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.

Alternatively, if the fluid is in a horizontal channel, then the gravitational force is purely in the z-direction, and doesn't affect the x-component of motion. But then, the Bernoulli equation would include the gravitational term only if there's a vertical component, which in this case, maybe not.

Wait, but let's think again. Since v and w are zero, the fluid isn't moving in y or z. So the flow is entirely in x, and thus, any gravitational effect would have to be along x, which would require that z varies with x. So perhaps the pipe is inclined, so that moving in x-direction causes a change in height z.

In that case, the gravitational force component along the x-direction would be ρ g (dz/dx) * volume, right? Because the slope of the pipe is dz/dx.

So putting it all together, the sum of forces in the x-direction is zero (steady flow, so no acceleration), so:

Pressure gradient force + gravitational force = 0

Which is:

- dp/dx * dx * dy * dz (volume element) + ρ g (dz/dx) * dx * dy * dz (volume) = 0 

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of force per unit volume. Then the pressure gradient force per unit volume is -dp/dx, and the gravitational force per unit volume is ρ g (dz/dx).

So setting their sum to zero:

- dp/dx + ρ g (dz/dx) = 0 

Which rearranges to:

dp/dx = ρ g (dz/dx)

But I'm not sure how this helps me find u in terms of p. Maybe I need another equation, perhaps the equation of continuity.

The equation of continuity for steady, incompressible flow in one dimension is:

∂(A u)/∂x = 0 

Where A is the cross-sectional area. If A is constant, then u is constant, which would mean du/dx is zero, but the problem says u is a function of x, so perhaps A varies with x. But I'm not given information about the area, so maybe this approach isn't helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the Euler equation I wrote earlier. From the Euler equation, I had:

dp/dx = -ρ u (du/dx)

So if I can express dz/dx in terms of du/dx, perhaps I can combine the two equations.

Wait, from the force balance, I had:

dp/dx = ρ g (dz/dx)

So combining with the Euler equation:

ρ g (dz/dx) = -ρ u (du/dx)

Canceling ρ from both sides:

g (dz/dx) = -u (du/dx)

Hmm, interesting. So I have:

dz/dx = - (u/(g)) (du/dx )

But I'm not sure how this helps. Maybe I can separate variables and integrate.

Let me rearrange:

dz = - (u/g) du

Integrate both sides:

∫ dz = - (1/g) ∫ u du 

Which gives:

z = - (1/(2g)) u² + C 

Where C is the constant of integration.

Hmm, but how does this help me relate u to p? Because I'm not sure about the boundary conditions. Maybe I need to apply Bernoulli's equation between two points.

Wait, let's think about Bernoulli's equation again. Since the flow is along x and z varies with x, Bernoulli's equation would be:

p + (1/2) ρ u² + ρ g z = constant 

So for two points along the flow, say x1 and x2:

p1 + (1/2) ρ u1² + ρ g z1 = p2 + (1/2) ρ u2² + ρ g z2 

But without knowing specific points, it's hard to apply. Alternatively, perhaps if I consider that the pressure gradient is related to the velocity and height.

Wait, but if I take the derivative of Bernoulli's equation with respect to x, maybe that would help. Let's try.

Differentiating the Bernoulli equation:

d/dx [ p + (1/2) ρ u² + ρ g z ] = d/dx [ constant ] = 0 

So:

dp/dx + ρ u du/dx + ρ g dz/dx = 0 

But from the earlier force balance, we had dp/dx = ρ g dz/dx. Substituting that into the equation:

ρ g dz/dx + ρ u du/dx + ρ g dz/dx = 0 

So:

2 ρ g dz/dx + ρ u du/dx = 0 

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I made a wrong turn.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Euler equation and the force balance together. From the force balance: dp/dx = ρ g dz/dx.

From Euler: dp/dx = - ρ u du/dx.

So equating them:

- ρ u du/dx = ρ g dz/dx 

Cancel ρ:

- u du/dx = g dz/dx 

Which is the same as I had earlier. So integrating gives z = - (u²)/(2g) + C.

But I'm not seeing how this connects p and u. Maybe I need to find another relation.

Wait, perhaps I can express p in terms of u and z. From Bernoulli's equation:

p = constant - (1/2) ρ u² - ρ g z 

But without knowing the constant, perhaps I can express p as a function of u, assuming that the constant is p0 at some reference point where u=0 and z=0.

Wait, but I don't have that information. Alternatively, maybe I can take the derivative of p with respect to x.

Wait, from the force balance, dp/dx = ρ g dz/dx.

But from the integration, z = - u²/(2g) + C. Differentiating z with respect to x:

dz/dx = - (2u)/(2g) du/dx = - u du/(g dx)

So dz/dx = - u/(g) * du/dx

Substituting into dp/dx:

dp/dx = ρ g * [ - u/(g) * du/dx ]

Which simplifies to:

dp/dx = - ρ u du/dx 

Which brings me back to the Euler equation. So I'm going in circles.

Wait, maybe I should consider a simple case where the flow is driven by pressure and gravity. Let's assume that the only forces are pressure gradient and gravity. Then, from the force balance:

dp/dx = ρ g dz/dx 

And from the earlier integration, z = - u²/(2g) + C.

If I take a reference point where x=0, maybe z=0 and u=0, then C=0. So z = - u²/(2g)

Wait, but z can't be negative if u is positive, unless the pipe is going downward. Hmm, but perhaps I should think that as u increases, z decreases, meaning the pipe slopes downward. Not sure, but let's proceed.

So z = - u²/(2g)

Now, from Bernoulli's equation, p + (1/2) ρ u² + ρ g z = constant.

At the reference point x=0, z=0, u=0, so p0 + 0 + 0 = constant. So p0 is the pressure at that point.

At another point x, p = p0 - (1/2) ρ u² - ρ g z.

But from the expression for z, z = - u²/(2g), so substituting:

p = p0 - (1/2) ρ u² - ρ g (-u²/(2g))

Simplify:

p = p0 - (1/2) ρ u² + (ρ u²)/2

Wait, the terms with u² cancel out. So p = p0.

That's odd. So according to this, the pressure remains constant, which would mean that dp/dx = 0. But earlier, from force balance, dp/dx = ρ g dz/dx. If dp/dx is zero, then dz/dx must be zero, meaning z is constant, which contradicts our earlier assumption that z = -u²/(2g).

Hmm, something's wrong here. Let me check my steps.

Wait, when I took z = -u²/(2g) + C, and at x=0, z=0, u=0, so C=0. So z = -u²/(2g). But if I plug this into Bernoulli's equation, I get p = p0 - (1/2)ρu² + (1/2)ρu², which gives p=p0, a constant. So the pressure doesn't change, which would imply dp/dx=0, but from force balance, dp/dx=ρ g dz/dx.

But dz/dx for z = -u²/(2g) is dz/dx = - (2u du/dx)/(2g) )= - u du/dx / g.

So from force balance, dp/dx= ρ g * (- u du/dx /g )= -ρ u du/dx.

But if p is constant, dp/dx=0, so 0= -ρ u du/dx → u du/dx=0. So either u=0 or du/dx=0.

If u=0, then the flow is zero everywhere, which is trivial. If du/dx=0, then u is constant. So either way, u is constant. But the problem states u is a function of x, implying that u varies with x. So this suggests a contradiction, which means perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait a minute, maybe I should consider a different approach. Let's think about energy per unit volume. In Bernoulli's equation, the terms represent energy per unit volume: pressure (p), kinetic energy ((1/2)ρu²), and potential energy (ρg z). Since the flow is steady and inviscid, the total energy should be conserved along the streamline.

So, Bernoulli's equation says p + (1/2)ρu² + ρg z = constant.

Now, if I can find this constant in terms of p, I can solve for u.

But without more information, like a reference point, it's hard. Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the velocity is due to the pressure gradient and gravity. Let's imagine that the fluid is in a horizontal pipe, so z is constant. Then the potential energy term is constant, so the equation becomes p + (1/2)ρu² = constant.

In that case, the pressure gradient would be balancing the change in kinetic energy. But if the pipe is horizontal, then dz/dx=0, so from the force balance equation, dp/dx=0, implying p is constant. So then p = constant - (1/2)ρu². But this leads to u being constant again, which contradicts u being a function of x. So this approach isn't working.

Wait, perhaps the pipe is vertical? But then the flow would
