Okay, so I've got this economics multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me break it down step by step. The question is about supply shocks and their effect on the Phillips curve. Hmm, I remember that the Phillips curve relates inflation and unemployment. 

So the question is asking about a negative or contractionary supply shock. I think a supply shock is an event that suddenly changes the productive capacity of an economy. A negative supply shock would be something like an increase in resource costs, maybe like an oil price hike, which makes production more expensive. That should reduce the aggregate supply because firms can't produce as much as before without raising prices.

Now, how does this affect the Phillips curve? Wait, the Phillips curve shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment. When there's a supply shock, particularly a contractionary one, I think it affects the Phillips curve by shifting it. But which way?

I recall that the Phillips curve can shift due to changes in expectations, technological changes, or supply shocks. A negative supply shock would lead to higher prices and higher unemployment at the same time. So, on the graph, higher unemployment for the same inflation rate would mean the curve shifts to the right. Or wait, does it shift left?

Wait, maybe I should think about the short-run Phillips curve. The basic idea is that lower unemployment leads to higher inflation because workers demand higher wages. If there's a negative supply shock, say oil prices go up, production costs rise. This leads to firms producing less, so output falls, unemployment rises. But because costs are higher, they might raise prices, leading to higher inflation. So both unemployment and inflation go up, which in the Phillips curve graph would mean the curve shifts so that for any given unemployment rate, the corresponding inflation rate is higher. So the curve shifts upwards and to the right. Or wait, maybe the shift is to the right because the whole curve moves such that for each level of unemployment, the inflation rate is higher. 

Wait, the Phillips curve is usually plotted with inflation on the y-axis and unemployment on the x-axis. So if the curve shifts to the right, it means that for a given unemployment rate, inflation is higher. That makes sense because a negative supply shock causes inflation to rise more at every level of unemployment.

So looking back at the options, the question is whether the Phillips curve shifts left (A) or right (D). So a contractionary supply shock shifts the Phillips curve to the right, which is option D.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it: A supply shock that reduces AS (aggregate supply) would lead to lower output and higher prices. Higher prices mean higher inflation. So at the same unemployment rate, inflation is higher. So yes, the Phillips curve shifts right. So the correct answer should be D.

What about the other options? Option A is shifting left, which would mean lower inflation for same unemployment, which doesn't fit. Option B is about the investment demand curve shifting right. I don't think a supply shock directly affects investment demand like that. Maybe higher interest rates would, but that's not directly related. Option C is about money demand shifting rightâ€”maybe if inflation expectations rise, people demand more money, but again, the question is specifically about the Phillips curve, so that's not the answer here.

A negative or contractionary supply shock, such as an increase in resource costs (e.g., an oil price hike), reduces aggregate supply and leads to higher prices and unemployment. This results in higher inflation at every level of unemployment, causing the Phillips curve to shift to the right. This shift reflects that for any given unemployment rate, the corresponding inflation rate is higher.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A leftward shift of the Phillips curve would imply lower inflation for the same unemployment rate, which contradicts the effects of a contractionary supply shock.
- **Option B**: A rightward shift of the investment demand curve is unrelated to the direct effects of a supply shock.
- **Option C**: A rightward shift of the money demand curve could occur due to higher inflation expectations but is not the focus of this question.
- **Option D**: A rightward shift of the Phillips curve correctly captures the increase in inflation at every level of unemployment caused by the supply shock.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D
