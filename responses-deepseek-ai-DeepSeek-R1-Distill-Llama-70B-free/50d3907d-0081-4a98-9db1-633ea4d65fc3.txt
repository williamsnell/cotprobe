Okay, so I've got this problem about manufacturing overhead distribution. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my accounting, but I'll try to remember.

So, the question is about the Adam Manufacturing Co. They distribute their overhead using the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. I need to find two things: (a) the overhead percent of prime cost, and (b) the overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of $32,600.

Let me jot down the given numbers. Total overhead is $44,733. Direct labor is $185,600, and materials used are $54,900. Wait, prime cost is the sum of direct materials and direct labor, right? Yeah, because prime cost includes both direct materials and direct labor. So total prime cost would be the sum of those two.

So let's calculate the total prime cost first. Direct labor is $185,600, materials $54,900. Adding those together gives me 185600 + 54900. Let me do that math: 185,600 plus 54,900. 185,600 + 50,000 is 235,600, and then plus 4,900 makes 240,500. So total prime cost is $240,500.

Now, the overhead percentage is calculated as (total overhead / total prime cost) * 100. So the formula would be (44,733 / 240,500) * 100. Let me compute that.

First, 44,733 divided by 240,500. Let me see, I can simplify this division. Maybe approximate it to get the percentage. Alternatively, use a calculator approach.

Let me write it as 44733 รท 240500.

Hmm, 240500 is about 240k. 44,733 is about 44.7k. So 44.7 / 240 = approximately 0.186. Wait, 44.7 /240 is like 0.186. Multiply by 100 gives 18.6%. But wait, let me do more precise calculation.

Alternatively, 44,733 รท 240,500. Let me compute this step by step.

240500 * 0.18 = 43,290. Because 240500 * 0.1 is 24,050; times 0.18 is 24,050 * 1.8 = 43,290.

So 0.18 gives 43,290. The actual numerator is 44,733, which is 1,443 more.

So 1,443 รท 240,500. Let's compute that. 240500 * 0.006 is 1,443, because 240500 * 0.001 is 240.5, so 0.006 is 1,443. So 0.18 + 0.006 = 0.186. So 18.6%.

So the overhead percentage is 18.6%. That's part (a) done.

Now part (b): the overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of $32,600. So the formula is (overhead percentage) multiplied by the department's prime cost.

We calculated 18.6% as the overhead percentage. So 18.6% of 32,600.

Let me compute that. 32,600 * 0.186.

I can break this down. 32,600 * 0.1 is 3,260. 32,600 * 0.08 is 2,608. 32,600 * 0.006 is 195.6. Now add them together: 3,260 + 2,608 = 5,868. Plus 195.6 is 6,063.6.

So the overhead charge is $6,063.60.

Now looking at the options, which option has 18.6% and $6,063.60? Let me check the options.

Looking through the options, option G says 18.6%, $6,063.60. So that's the one.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the total prime cost by adding the direct labor and direct materials costs:

\[
\text{Total Prime Cost} = \$185,600 + \$54,900 = \$240,500
\]

Next, we determine the overhead percentage by dividing the total overhead by the total prime cost and multiplying by 100:

\[
\text{Overhead Percentage} = \left(\frac{\$44,733}{\$240,500}\right) \times 100 = 18.6\%
\]

For part (b), we calculate the overhead charge to a department with a prime cost of \$32,600 by multiplying the overhead percentage by the department's prime cost:

\[
\text{Overhead Charge} = 0.186 \times \$32,600 = \$6,063.60
\]

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: 18.6%, $6,063.60**
