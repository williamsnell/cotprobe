Okay, so I have this question about when the gender of a fetus becomes clear based on the external genitals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my embryology, but I'll try to think through this.

I remember that sexual differentiation in humans happens after fertilization. The early embryo doesn't have distinguishable sex organs at first. I think the gonads form first, and then they start producing hormones that influence the development of external genitalia.

Wait, so when does the fetus develop enough that you can see the difference between male and female externally? I recall that around the first trimester, maybe a couple of months in, the genitals start to show noticeable differences. Let me break this down.

After conception, the first few weeks are about implantation and basic organ development. The formation of the genital tubercle happens around week 4-6, I think. But that's when the basics start, not when it's visible enough to determine gender.

Oh right, I remember something about 12-15 weeks, which is the end of the first trimester or early second. So that would be about 3 to 4 months after conception. Wait, but the question is about months, so I need to convert weeks to months.

12 weeks is 3 months, approximately. So around 3 months, the external genitalia become distinct enough that an ultrasound can detect whether it's male or female. But wait, sometimes it's a bit later. Maybe after 3 months, like 4 or so.

Wait, another thought: I think that by around 16-18 weeks, which is about 4 months, the ultrasound can reliably determine the sex. But the question is when it's clear from the appearance, so maybe the initial signs are visible earlier.

Alternatively, I've heard that at 3 months (12 weeks), the external genitals have developed enough that in an ultrasound, you can start seeing the differences, like the presence of a penis or clitoris. But it's not always 100% accurate that early because the structures are small.

So putting it all together, the options are from 1 to 9 months. The question is asking after how many months the gender is clear. So the answer is probably around 3 months.

Looking at the options, option C is 3, E is 4, and I is 6. So which is it?

Wait, I think the key point is that the genitalia become distinguishable between 12 to 14 weeks, which is about 3-3.5 months. So the earliest clear signs would be around 3 months, but maybe 4 months is when it's more obvious.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "about ______ months after conception". So if it's clear by 3 months, then the answer would be 3, which is option C.

Alternatively, some sources say that between 16-20 weeks (about 4-5 months) is when it's more reliably determined, but the initial signs are earlier.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formation of the external genitalia begins around 9-10 weeks (which is about 2.5 months). By 12 weeks (3 months), the external sex organs are developed enough to be seen on an ultrasound, but it might not always be clear. So perhaps the answer is 3 months, option C.

Wait, another angle: I remember that in some textbooks, they mention that by the end of the 3rd month (which is 12 weeks), the sex can be determined. So the answer would be 3 months, option C.

The gender of a fetus becomes clear from the appearance of external genitals around 3 months after conception. This corresponds to approximately 12 weeks of development, when the external genitalia have differentiated enough to be distinguishable on an ultrasound. While earlier signs may begin to appear, by 3 months, the differences are more consistently observable.

Answer: C
