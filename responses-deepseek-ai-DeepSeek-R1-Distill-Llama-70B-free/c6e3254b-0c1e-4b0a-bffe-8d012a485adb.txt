The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

In a criminal prosecution the government must prove that the defendant affixed a rubber-stamp containing his signature to certain fraudulent letters mailed to the victim. The defendant denied that he stamped the letters. There were no witnesses to the defendant stamping the letters. The prosecution attempted to present a co-worker to testify that defendant maintained sole control of the stamp and used it once daily at 3 p.m. to sign all outgoing letters, and then immediately returned it to his safe. The co-worker would testify that he saw the defendant using the stamp in that habitual manner over a period of many years. The defense objected because this did not prove that the defendant's practice was followed on the dates in question. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court rule?

Options:

A: The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of prior habit will only distract the jury from deciding whether the defendant actually acted that way on the specified dates.
B: The testimony is inadmissible because it is not direct evidence that the defendant used the stamp on the fraudulent letters.
C: The testimony is inadmissible because the co-worker does not have a direct knowledge of the defendant using the stamp on the fraudulent letters.
D: The testimony is inadmissible because evidence of habit is not admissible in a criminal case under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
E: The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant had access to the stamp.
F: The testimony is admissible because it proves a pattern of behavior that the defendant maintained control over the stamp.
G: The testimony is admissible because it proves that the defendant was the only person who could have used the stamp.
H: The testimony is inadmissible because the co-worker's observation is considered hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
I: The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
J: The testimony is admissible because it provides the jury with information about the defendant's routine, which is relevant to the case.

Okay, so I have this evidence question here about criminal prosecution and the admissibility of certain testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that the government is prosecuting someone for a crime involving fraudulent letters. They need to prove that the defendant used a rubber stamp with his signature on these letters. The defendant says he didn't stamp them, and there are no witnesses to him doing it. 

The prosecution wants a co-worker to testify. This co-worker would say that the defendant had sole control of the stamp and used it every day at 3 p.m. to sign outgoing letters, then put it back in his safe. The co-worker saw this happen over many years. The defense objects, arguing that this doesn't prove the defendant followed that routine on the specific dates in question.

The question is about whether this testimony is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The options are A through J.

I remember that evidence law has specific rules about habit and routine. Let me think. There's a rule about habit, which is when a person regularly acts in a certain way, almost automatically. And there's routine practice, which is about how an organization usually does things.

Wait, Federal Rule of Evidence 406 deals with habit and routine practice. It says that evidence of a person's habit or routine practice is admissible to prove that the person acted in accordance with the habit or routine on a particular occasion. So habit can be used to prove conduct on a specific occasion.

But wait, there's a distinction between habit and routine practice. Habit is a specific, unvarying response to a specific situation. Routine practice is more about regular procedures, maybe not as rigid as habit. But both are admissible under FRE 406.

In this case, the co-worker is testifying about the defendant's daily routineâ€”using the stamp once a day at 3 p.m., then putting it back. That sounds like a routine practice of the defendant. So under 406, that should be admissible to show that he likely acted the same way on the dates in question.

Looking at the options:

Option I says it's admissible because habit and routine are admissible under the rules. That seems correct.

Option F says it's admissible because it shows a pattern of control over the stamp. That's true, but the main point is about the routine practice proving conduct on specific dates.

Option J says it's admissible because it's about routine relevant to the case. Also true, but the specific rule is about habit and routine.

Options A through D and H are about why it's inadmissible. Let me check each.

A: Inadmissible because prior habit distracts the jury. I don't think that's a valid reason. The rules allow it, so this option is incorrect.

B: It's not direct evidence. True, but circumstantial evidence is admissible. So B is incorrect.

C: The co-worker lacks direct knowledge. But the co-worker is testifying about what he observed over many years, so he does have knowledge. C is incorrect.

D: Habit isn't admissible in criminal cases. No, the rule doesn't make that distinction. So D is wrong.

E: Admissible because it shows access. Well, access is part of it, but the testimony is more about routine. E is not the best answer.

F: Admissible because it shows control. That's a factor, but the primary admissibility is under 406 for routine.

G: Admissible because only the defendant could use it. Maybe, but again, the testimony is about routine, so G might be a possible reason, but I think I is more accurate.

H: Inadmissible as hearsay. No, the co-worker is testifying to what he saw, so it's not hearsay. H is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be I, because habit and routine are admissible under FRE 406 to prove conduct on a specific occasion.

The testimony is admissible because habit and routine practice are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
