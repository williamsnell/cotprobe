Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jacob giving a note to the Franklin Mint and then discounting it at a bank. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance terms, but let me think through this step by step.

So, Jacob gave a 90-day note for $1250 on October 10. Then, on November 15, it was discounted at the bank at a rate of 6 and a half percent. The question is asking what the proceeds were, and there are multiple options to choose from.

First, I need to understand what it means to discount a note. From what I remember, discounting a note means that the bank pays the holder of the note the present value, which is the face value minus the discount. The discount is calculated based on the interest rate and the time remaining until the note matures.

So the face value of the note is $1250, and it's a 90-day note. The date it was given was October 10, and it was discounted on November 15. I need to figure out how many days have passed since October 10 to November 15 because that's the time the note has already been held, but wait, actually, no. Wait, when you discount a note, you calculate the interest from the discount date until the maturity date. Because the bank is essentially buying the note before it's due and paying less than the face value.

Wait, the note was given on October 10, and it's a 90-day note. So the maturity date is 90 days after October 10. Let me calculate that. October has 31 days, so October 10 plus 90 days would be... Let's see. From October 10 to October 31 is 21 days. That leaves 90-21=69 days left. Then, November has 30 days, so 69-30=39 days into December. So the maturity date is December 9th.

But the note was discounted on November 15, so the time from November 15 to December 9 is how many days? Let me count. From November 15 to November 30 is 15 days, and then December 1 to 9 is 9 days, so total 24 days. So the discount period is 24 days.

Wait, but sometimes in these calculations, they might use 360 days a year for simplicity. Oh, right, the bank discount formula often uses a 360-day year. So I think I need to calculate the discount based on 360 days.

The formula for the discount is: Discount = Face Value × Rate × Time. And the proceeds are Face Value minus Discount.

So the time here is 24 days. But since it's a 360-day year, the time factor would be 24/360.

The rate is 6.5%, which is 0.065 in decimal.

So putting it all together:

Discount = 1250 × 0.065 × (24/360)

Let me compute that. Let's break it down. 24/360 is the same as 1/15, which is approximately 0.0666667.

So 0.065 multiplied by 0.0666667 is about 0.00433333.

Then, 1250 × 0.00433333 equals... Let me compute 1250 × 0.00433333. 1250 × 0.004 is 5, and 0.00033333 is about 1250 × 0.00033333 ≈ 0.416666. So total discount is approximately 5.416666.

So the proceeds would be 1250 minus 5.416666, which is 1244.583333. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that number. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let's compute 24/360 first. 24 divided by 360 is 0.066666667.

Then, 0.065 multiplied by 0.066666667 is 0.065 * (2/30) [since 24/360 = 2/30]. Wait, 0.065 * (2/30) = (0.065 *2)/30 = 0.13/30 ≈ 0.00433333.

Now, 1250 * 0.00433333. Let's compute this precisely.

1250 * 0.00433333.

Well, 1250 × 0.004 is 5. 1250 × 0.00033333 is approximately 0.416666. So total is 5.416666.

Proceeds = 1250 - 5.416666 = 1244.583333. But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me double-check the days from November 15 to December 9.

November has 30 days, so from November 15 to November 30 is 15 days. Then from December 1 to December 9 is 9, so 15+9=24 days. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should be using 365 days in the calculation instead of 360. Let me try that.

If using 365 days: time =24/365 ≈ 0.06575342.

So discount = 1250 ×0.065 ×0.06575342.

Let me compute 0.065 ×0.06575342 first. 0.065 * 0.06575342 ≈ 0.004289.

Then 1250 × 0.004289 = approximately 5.36125.

Proceeds would be 1250 -5.36125= 1244.63875. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the time is from the date of discounting to the maturity date. So, 24 days.

But perhaps the formula is using the actual days divided by 360. Let me recheck the calculation using exact numbers.

Compute 24/360 = 1/15 = 0.066666667.

So discount = 1250 * 0.065 * (24/360) 

Compute 0.065 * (24/360) first.

24/360 is 0.066666667.

0.065 * 0.066666667 = (0.065 * 24)/360 = (1.56)/360 ≈ 0.00433333.

Then 1250 * 0.00433333 = 5.416666.

Proceeds = 1250 - 5.416666 = 1244.583333.

But looking at the options, the closest is option G: $1,237.81 and option E: $1,242.50. Hmm, neither is near 1244.58. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the discount is based on the remaining days, but perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it using another approach.

Wait, another thought: when a note is discounted, the discount is calculated as the simple interest on the face value for the unexpired time. So, the formula is:

Discount = F × r × t

Where F is face value, r is rate, t is time in years.

So t is 24 days. If using 360 days, t = 24/360 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666667 years.

So discount = 1250 * 0.065 * (24/360) = ?

Compute 1250 * 0.065 first: 1250 * 0.065 = 81.25.

Then, 81.25 * (24/360) = 81.25 * (1/15) ≈ 5.416666.

So discount is $5.416666.

So proceeds are 1250 - 5.416666 = 1244.583333.

But none of the options match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the time isn't 24 days. Let me recount the days from November 15 to December 9.

November 15 to November 30: 15 days (since 30-15=15).

December 1 to December 9: 9 days.

Total 24 days. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the rate is not 6.5% but 6 and a half percent, which is 6.5%, so that part is correct.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the bank uses the 365-day count instead of 360. Let me try that.

t = 24/365 ≈ 0.0657534.

So discount = 1250 * 0.065 * 0.0657534.

Compute 0.065 * 0.0657534 = approximately 0.004289.

1250 * 0.004289 = 5.36125.

Proceeds: 1250 -5.36125 = 1244.63875.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the time is calculated differently. Let me think about how many days are left after November 15 until the maturity on December 9.

Wait, another approach: the note was dated October 10, and it's a 90-day note, so the maturity date is January 8, because October 10 + 90 days.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating the maturity date. Let me recalculate that.

October 10 plus 90 days:

October has 31 days, so from October 10 to October 31 is 21 days (including the 10th? Wait, no: from October 10 to October 31 is 21 days if you count the 10th as day 0. Wait, no, if today is October 10, tomorrow is day 1, so October 10 is day 0, October 11 day 1, up to October 31 is day 21.

So 90 days would take us to day 90.

So day 0: Oct 10.

Add 90 days: 

Days remaining in October: 31 -10 =21 days (since Oct 10 is day 0, days left in Oct after that are 21 days, up to Oct 31).

So subtract 21 from 90: 90-21=69 days left.

Then, November has 30 days, so 69-30=39 days into December.

So December 39 days: December 1 is day 1, so 39 days is December 9? Wait, December 1 is day 1, so day 39 would be December 9 (since 1+38=39). Wait, no, December 1 is day 1, December 2 day 2, ..., December 39 would be January 8. Wait, wait, wait. Because December has 31 days. So 39 days into December would be 31 in December and 8 into January. Oh, right! So 31 days in December, so 39-31=8 days into January. So the maturity date is January 8.

Wait, that's a big mistake earlier. So the note's maturity date is January 8, not December 9. That changes everything. So when the note was discounted on November 15, the remaining days until maturity would be from November 15 to January 8.

Let me calculate that.

From November 15 to November 30: 15 days.

December has 31 days.

January 1 to January 8: 8 days.

So 15 +31 +8 =54 days.

Wait, no: November 15 to November 30 is 15 days (since 30-15=15). Then December has 31, and January 8 is 8 days. So total is 15+31+8=54 days.

So the time is 54 days, not 24 days as I previously thought. That's where I went wrong earlier.

So t is 54 days.

So now, with t=54 days, let's recalculate the discount.

Using 360-day year:

t =54/360=0.15.

Discount =1250 * 0.065 * 0.15.

Compute 0.065 *0.15 first: 0.065 *0.15 = 0.00975.

Then 1250 *0.00975 = 12.1875.

So discount is $12.1875.

Proceeds are 1250 -12.1875=1237.8125.

Looking at the options, option G is $1,237.81, which matches.

So the correct answer would be G.
</think>

To determine the proceeds from discounting the note, we start by calculating the discount. The note has a face value of $1,250, a maturity period of 90 days, and was discounted on November 15 at a rate of 6.5%. The maturity date is January 8, as calculated from October 10. The time remaining until maturity from November 15 is 54 days.

Using the bank discount formula:

\[
\text{Discount} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Face Value = $1,250
- Rate = 6.5\% = 0.065
- Time = \(\frac{54}{360} = 0.15\) (assuming a 360-day year)

\[
\text{Discount} = 1250 \times 0.065 \times 0.15 = 12.1875
\]

The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 1250 - 12.1875 = 1237.8125
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the proceeds are $1,237.81. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: $1,237.81**

Answer: G
