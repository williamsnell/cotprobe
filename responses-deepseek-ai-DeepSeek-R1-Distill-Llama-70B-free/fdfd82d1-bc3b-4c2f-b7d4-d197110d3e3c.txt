Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about what makes a document 'authentic' according to Scott (1990). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to understand the term 'authentic' in the context of documents. I remember that authenticity usually refers to the document being genuine and not forged or altered. But the question is specifically about Scott's definition, so I should focus on what Scott said.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's a document free from alterations or forgeries. That sounds like a common understanding of authentic. But I'm not sure if Scott's definition is that narrow.

Option B mentions being officially certified by a notary. That seems more about legal certification rather than the intrinsic authenticity as per Scott.

Option C states it's a 'sound' original or reliable copy of known authorship. This seems to touch on the document being in its original form and having a known creator, which might relate to authenticity in terms of provenance and condition.

Option D talks about being sincere and accurate without political bias. While accuracy is important, I don't recall Scott focusing on bias as a factor.

Option E is about accurate translation from the original language. Translation accuracy is a separate issue from the document's authenticity.

Option F mentions a detailed account of events. That's more about content rather than whether the document itself is authentic.

Option G says it's representative of other documents that didn't survive. That sounds more like a consideration in sampling or historical representation, not authenticity.

Option H involves peer review and expert approval. That's a modern academic process, but I don't think Scott's definition from 1990 would include that.

Option I is about verification by an accredited institution. That could be a way to establish authenticity, but I'm not sure if that's Scott's definition.

Option J talks about having both literal and interpretable meanings. That seems more about hermeneutics or interpretation rather than authenticity.

Now, I'm trying to remember what Scott's criteria for authenticity might have been. I think Scott, in his work on documents, emphasizes factors like the document being a sound original or a reliable copy, and that it's from a known author. So that points me towards option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes 'authentic' can also mean verified by an institution or expert, like option I. But I think Scott's focus was more on the document's condition and provenance rather than third-party verification.

So putting it all together, I believe the correct answer is option C: is a 'sound' original, or reliable copy, of known authorship.

The question asks about Scott's (1990) definition of an 'authentic' document. Authenticity generally refers to a document being genuine and unaltered. Scott's criteria focus on the document being a "sound" original or a reliable copy with known authorship, emphasizing provenance and condition rather than third-party verification or other factors like translation or bias.

Analyzing the options:
- **A** is too narrow, focusing only on freedom from alterations.
- **B** pertains to legal certification, not Scott's definition.
- **C** aligns with Scott's emphasis on the document's condition and authorship.
- **D** and **E** address accuracy and translation, unrelated to Scott's focus.
- **F** and **G** concern content and representation, not authenticity.
- **H** and **I** involve modern verification processes, not Scott's criteria.
- **J** deals with interpretation, not authenticity.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
