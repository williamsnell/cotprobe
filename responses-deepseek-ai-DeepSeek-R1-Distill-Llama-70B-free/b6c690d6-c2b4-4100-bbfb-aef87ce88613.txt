Question:

A farmer has a large field where he grows corn. He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the crop- duster mistakenly sprays a strong herbicide, rather than a pesticide, and kills all the corn plants in the field. Several days later, a construction company building a house near the farmer's field negligently hits a gas line and starts a fire that burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field. If the farmer brings negligence claims against the crop-duster and the construction company in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop, the most likely result is

Options:

A: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because neither is a "but for" cause of the harm.
B: both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.
C: only the crop-duster is liable, because its negligence occurred before the construction company's negligence.
D: both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because they both contributed to the loss of the farmer's corn crop.
E: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because the farmer did not have insurance for his corn crop.
F: neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because the farmer failed to protect his field.
G: only the construction company is liable, because the fire caused more damage than the herbicide.
H: only the crop-duster is liable, because the construction company's fire was an unforeseeable event.
I: only the construction company is liable, because its negligence would have destroyed the farmer's corn crop no matter what the crop- duster did.
J: the crop-duster is liable for the value of the corn crop and the construction company is liable for the damage to the field.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question about negligence and causation. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a farmer hired a crop-duster who mistakenly sprayed herbicide instead of pesticide, killing all the corn. Then, a construction company negligently caused a fire that burned the field. The farmer is suing both for negligence.

I remember that in negligence cases, two main elements are causation and damages. The plaintiff must show that the defendant's breach of duty was both the actual and proximate cause of the harm.

So, the crop-duster sprayed herbicide, which killed the corn. Then, the construction company's negligence caused a fire that destroyed the field. So, the corn was already dead, but the fire destroyed the field. But wait, the question is about the destruction of the corn crop. So both the herbicide and the fire might have contributed.

First, let's think about the crop-duster. The crop-duster's action directly killed the corn. So, but for the herbicide, the corn would have been alive. That seems clear. So the crop-duster is a but-for cause of the destruction of the corn.

Now, the construction company started a fire that burned the field. But the corn was already dead from the herbicide. So, if the fire came after, did it cause any additional harm regarding the corn? Well, the corn was already dead, so the fire might not have caused any additional damage to the corn itself. But maybe the fire destroyed the field, but the question is about the corn crop, which was already gone.

Wait, but the question is about the destruction of the corn crop. So, the crop-duster's actions destroyed the corn. Then the fire destroyed the field, but the corn was already dead. So, the construction company's action might not have caused the destruction of the corn because it was already destroyed.

But wait, could the construction company's fire be a cause? Let's think about actual cause. The herbicide killed the corn. The fire came later. The fire might have burned the dead corn, but that doesn't cause the corn's destruction; it's just destroying what's already dead. So the construction company's negligence didn't cause the corn's destruction because the corn was already dead.

Alternatively, maybe the fire could have destroyed the corn if it had still been alive. But since the corn was dead, the fire didn't contribute to the corn's destruction.

So, in terms of causation, only the crop-duster's action was the actual cause of the corn's death.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes, when multiple tortfeasors cause harm, even if their actions contribute, each can be liable. But in this case, the herbicide killed the corn. The fire burned the field, but the corn was already dead. So the fire didn't cause the corn's destruction, it just destroyed the remains.

So, the farmer's damage is the loss of the corn crop. The crop-duster is liable because they caused that. The construction company's fire didn't cause the corn to die; it was already dead. So, the construction company's action isn't a cause of the corn's destruction, but maybe of other damages like the field's soil or infrastructure. But the question is specifically about the corn crop.

Wait, but maybe the construction company's fire is a superseding cause. A superseding cause is an unforeseeable event that breaks the chain of causation. But in this case, the fire was caused by the construction company's negligence, which is foreseeable. So, the initial cause (herbicide) is the only cause.

Alternatively, maybe the construction company's negligence is a cause, but in reality, the corn was already dead. So the fire didn't cause the corn's destruction.

So, the crop-duster is liable for the corn's destruction, and the construction company isn't because their action didn't cause the corn's death. But wait, what if the fire had come before the herbicide? Then the analysis would be different. But in this case, the herbicide was first.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option H says only the crop-duster is liable because the fire was unforeseeable. But I'm not sure if the fire was unforeseeable. It was due to the construction company's negligence, which might be a foreseeable event, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the fire was a superseding cause, making the crop-duster's liability cut off. But if the fire didn't cause the corn's destruction, then it's just that the crop-duster is liable, and the construction company isn't.

But wait, another thought: the fire might have destroyed the field's ability to grow corn in the future, but the question is about the destruction of the existing corn crop, which was already dead.

So, the farmer can only recover from the crop-duster for the loss of the corn.

Looking at the options:

Option H says only the crop-duster is liable because the construction company's fire was unforeseeable. But I'm not sure if the fire was unforeseeable. It was a gas line being hit, which might be a foreseeable accident from construction.

Alternatively, the fire might be considered a superseding cause, breaking the chain. But if the crop-duster's action was the actual cause, and the fire didn't contribute, then the construction company isn't liable for the corn's destruction.

So, looking at the options again:

Option H says only the crop-duster is liable because the fire was unforeseeable.

Option D says both are liable because they contributed. But I don't think so, because the corn was already dead.

Option B says both are liable because each action was sufficient. But the fire didn't kill the corn, it was already dead.

So, the correct answer is H: only the crop-duster is liable because the construction company's fire was an unforeseeable event.

Wait, but was the fire unforeseeable? The construction company was building near the field, and hitting a gas line could be a foreseeable risk. So maybe the fire was not an unforeseeable event, making the construction company's action a superseding cause. But in this case, the corn was already destroyed, so the fire didn't cause the corn's destruction. So, the construction company isn't liable for the corn's destruction.

Wait, but the question is about the destruction of the corn crop. The crop-duster killed it, and the fire just burned the dead plants. So, the construction company didn't cause the destruction of the corn, only the field's damage.

So, the farmer can only recover from the crop-duster. Therefore, the correct answer is H.

The question revolves around determining which of the two defendants—the crop-duster or the construction company—is liable for the destruction of the farmer's corn crop. To resolve this, the analysis focuses on causation, specifically whether each defendant's actions were the "but for" cause of the harm.

1. **Crop-Duster's Liability**:  
   The crop-duster mistakenly sprayed herbicide, which directly killed the corn. This action is clearly the "but for" cause of the corn's destruction. Without the herbicide, the corn would not have died. Therefore, the crop-duster is liable for the destruction of the corn crop.

2. **Construction Company's Liability**:  
   The construction company's negligence caused a fire that burned the field. However, the corn was already dead due to the herbicide. The fire merely destroyed the remains of the dead corn and did not contribute to its initial destruction. Since the corn was already destroyed before the fire, the construction company's actions are not the cause of the corn's destruction. The fire might have caused other damages, such as harm to the field itself, but not to the corn crop.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option H** is correct because the crop-duster is liable for the corn's destruction, and the construction company's fire, while negligent, did not cause the corn's destruction. The fire was not an unforeseeable event, but it did not contribute to the corn's death, which had already occurred.  
   - Other options are incorrect because they either misattribute liability or mischaracterize the causal relationship between the defendants' actions and the harm.

Thus, the most accurate conclusion is that only the crop-duster is liable for the destruction of the corn crop.

**Answer: H**
