Okay, so I've got this problem here about computing the diameter of a square link subjected to a compressive load. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me a bunch of values. The compressive load is 27,000 lbs. The modulus of elasticity is 30e6 psi, which is 30 million pounds per square inch. Then there's the proportionality limit at 38,000 psi and a working stress of 7000 psi. The length of the link is 55 inches. They're asking for the diameter, which I think refers to the side of the square link since it's square.

Wait, wait. Square link—so the cross-section is a square, right? So each side is the same, so the diameter would be the side length. So I need to find the side length of the square.

I remember that when a material is under compression, the stress is the force divided by the area. Stress equals force over area, σ = F/A. So the stress here is the working stress, which is 7000 psi.

So the formula would be Stress (σ) = Compressive Load (F) / Area (A). Rearranging that, Area = F / σ.

But wait, since it's a square, the area is side squared. So A = d^2, where d is the side length. So plugging into the formula, d^2 = F / σ.

Let me plug in the numbers. F is 27,000 lbs. σ is 7000 psi. So A = 27000 / 7000 = let's see, 27000 divided by 7000. 7000 times 3 is 21000, so 27000-21000 is 6000. 6000 divided by 7000 is roughly 0.857. So 3.857 total? Wait, wait, no, wait—no, wait, 27000 divided by 7000.

Wait, 7000 goes into 27000 how many times? Let me calculate: 7000 * 3 = 21000. 27000 - 21000 = 6000. 6000/7000 is 6/7, which is approximately 0.857. So total is 3.857. So A is about 3.857 square inches.

But wait, since the area is d squared, d would be the square root of 3.857. Let me calculate that. The square root of 4 is 2, so sqrt(3.857) is a little less than 2. Let's see, 1.96 squared is (2 - 0.04)^2 = 4 - 0.16 + 0.0016 = ~3.8416. Hmm, wait 1.96^2 = (2 - 0.04)^2 = 4 - 2*(2)*(0.04) + 0.04^2 = 4 - 0.16 + 0.0016 = 3.8416. So 1.96 squared is about 3.8416, which is just a bit under 3.857. So the area would require a side length of approximately 1.96 inches. But wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 1.96 * 1.96: 2 times 2 is 4. Subtract 0.04*2*2 (which is 0.16) and add 0.04^2 (0.0016). So 4 - 0.16 + 0.0016 = 3.8416, as I said. But our area is 3.857, which is a bit larger. So the square root of 3.857 is a bit more than 1.96. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(3.857). Let me try 1.965^2. 1.96^2 is 3.8416. 1.965 squared: (1.96 + 0.005)^2 = 1.96^2 + 2*(1.96)*(0.005) + (0.005)^2 = 3.8416 + 0.0196 + 0.000025 = 3.861225. Hmm, our area is 3.857. So 1.965^2 is about 3.8612, which is a bit higher than 3.857. So the square root of 3.857 is between 1.96 and 1.965.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just use an approximate method. Alternatively, perhaps there's a factor I'm missing here, like whether the link is in tension or compression affecting the formula. Wait, the formula for stress is the same whether it's tension or compression, right? So σ = F/A. So the calculation I did should hold.

So area A = 27000 / 7000 = 3.857 in². So the side length is sqrt(3.857) ≈ 1.965 inches. Looking at the options, option C is 1.96 x 1.96 in., which is very close. But wait, let me check my calculation again because perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait a second, the problem mentions that the modulus of elasticity is given as 30e6 psi. Oh, but wait, modulus of elasticity is used in calculating deformation under stress, like in Hooke's law: stress = E * strain, but in this case, are we considering the elastic deformation or just the stress?

Hmm, the question is asking for the diameter, which I think is the required size to not exceed the working stress. So the working stress is 7000 psi, which is the allowable stress, so we can use that to compute the required area. So in that case, the modulus of elasticity might not be directly relevant here, unless we're considering deflection or something else.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if the problem is about the size of the link, the key factor is the stress. So using the working stress to compute the area needed, which gives us the side length. So modulus of elasticity (E) might be a red herring here, or perhaps it's used if the problem required checking something else, like the deformation, but in this case, the problem is purely about the size needed to handle the load without exceeding the working stress.

So that would mean, area A = F / σ = 27000 / 7000 = 3.857 in², as I had before. So side length is sqrt(3.857) ≈ 1.965 inches. So the closest option is C, 1.96 x 1.96 in. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option B is 2x2, which is 4 in². That area would result in a stress of 27000 /4 = 6750 psi, which is below the working stress of 7000. So why isn't that the case? Oh wait, because the working stress is the maximum allowable, so we can have a smaller area as long as the stress doesn't exceed 7000 psi. So if the area is 3.857 in², then the stress is exactly 7000 psi. So using a 2x2 square (area 4) would give a lower stress, which is acceptable, but perhaps the question is asking for the minimum size required, so the smallest possible size without exceeding the working stress. So in that case, 1.96x1.96 is sufficient.

But wait, in that case, the correct answer would be option C. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering using the proportionality limit instead of the working stress.

Wait, the proportionality limit is 38,000 psi. The working stress is 7000 psi. So perhaps the working stress is a factor of the proportionality limit. Because in design, the working stress is often a fraction of the proportionality limit, based on a factor of safety.

So, working stress is 7000, proportionality limit is 38000. So 7000/38000 is about 0.184, which is roughly 1/5.4. So that's a much lower stress than the proportionality limit, which makes sense for a safety factor.

But in terms of calculating the required area, we only need to use the working stress. So the calculation remains the same, leading to option C as the answer.

But wait, looking again, the options are:

A: 1.75 ×1.75

B: 2x2

C:1.96x1.96

D:2.25x2.25

H:2.5x2.5

So I think I'm confident that option C is correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, in compression, there might be considerations about the slenderness ratio and buckling, but in this problem, since it's a square link and the length is given, but I don't think that's relevant here. The problem doesn't mention anything about the length affecting the required diameter, so maybe we can ignore that factor. So I think the calculation is correct.

To compute the diameter of a square link subjected to a compressive load, we start by using the formula for stress:

\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
\]

where \( \sigma \) is the stress, \( F \) is the compressive load, and \( A \) is the cross-sectional area. Rearranging for the area:

\[
A = \frac{F}{\sigma}
\]

The given values are:
- Compressive load (\( F \)) = 27,000 lbs
- Working stress (\( \sigma \)) = 7,000 psi

Substituting these values:

\[
A = \frac{27,000}{7,000} = 3.857 \, \text{in}^2
\]

Since the cross-section is square, the area is related to the side length (\( d \)) by:

\[
A = d^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = \sqrt{A}
\]

Taking the square root of \( 3.857 \):

\[
d \approx 1.965 \, \text{in}
\]

This value is very close to 1.96 inches. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**C: 1.96 in. × 1.96 in.**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
