Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about why multiple-choice questions are often easier than fill-in or completion questions. The options are from A to G, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let's think about what makes multiple-choice questions easier. From what I remember, fill-in or completion questions require the test-taker to recall information exactly, right? They have to remember the precise term or fact without any hints. On the other hand, multiple-choice provides several options, which can serve as cues or hints.

Wait, the question says multiple-choice is easier because... So the key is probably the structure of multiple-choice. One reason could be that even if you're not sure of the exact answer, seeing the options can jog your memory. That's called retrieval cues, I think. Retrieval cues are prompts that help in remembering information. So in multiple-choice, the options act as cues, making it easier to select the right answer compared to fill-in where you have nothing to go on except your memory.

Looking at the options:

A: are definitional rather than conceptual. Not sure what that means. Maybe about types of knowledge? Not sure it's relevant here.

B: check memorization rather than critical thinking. Wait, multiple-choice can sometimes be more about memorization, but the question is about why they're easier. Maybe not the main point.

C: encourage rote learning rather than comprehension. Similar to B, but again, not directly about why they're easier to answer.

D: require less time to answer. Well, that's true because you don't have to write out the answer, but the question is about why they're easier, not necessarily faster. Although time could be a factor, I'm not sure it's the main reason here.

E: enhance retention of information. That's about learning after the test, not about why the questions are easier to answer during the test.

F: provide more retrieval cues. Oh yeah, this sounds exactly like what I was thinking earlier. The options give cues that help you remember the correct answer.

G: are always easier to understand. No, that's not necessarily true. Some multiple-choice questions can be tricky with ambiguous options.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be F. Multiple-choice questions provide more retrieval cues, making them easier than fill-in questions which don't offer any cues.

The correct answer is F. Multiple-choice questions are often easier than fill-in questions because they provide retrieval cues, which are prompts that help individuals remember the correct information. These cues, in the form of answer options, can jog one's memory and make selecting the right answer more manageable than recalling information from scratch. 

Answer: F
