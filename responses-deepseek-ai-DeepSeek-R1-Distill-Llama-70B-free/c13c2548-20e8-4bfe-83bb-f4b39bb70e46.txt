Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that A and B are independent events, and their probabilities are given as P(A) = 0.7 and P(B) = 0.2. I need to find P(A ∩ B), which is the probability that both A and B occur.

Hmm, I remember that when two events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Oh right, because independence means the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. So the formula should be P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).

Let me plug in the numbers. P(A) is 0.7 and P(B) is 0.2. So multiplying them together: 0.7 * 0.2 equals... 0.14. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Like, sometimes people confuse independent with mutually exclusive events. Oh wait, no, for mutually exclusive events, the probability of both happening is zero, but these are independent. So yeah, definitely multiplication.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.14. So that's the one I should choose. I think that's correct. I don't see any other option that matches 0.14 except G. So I'm confident that's the right answer.

The probability of the intersection of two independent events \( A \) and \( B \) is calculated by multiplying their individual probabilities: 

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
\]

Given \( P(A) = 0.7 \) and \( P(B) = 0.2 \), we find:

\[
P(A \cap B) = 0.7 \times 0.2 = 0.14
\]

From the provided options, the correct answer is **G: 0.14**.
