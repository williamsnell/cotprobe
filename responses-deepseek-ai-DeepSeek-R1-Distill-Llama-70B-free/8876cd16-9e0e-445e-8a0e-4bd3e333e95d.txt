Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solution calculations. But let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem is about preparing a solution by adding NH4Cl to NH3. The goal is to find out how many grams of NH4Cl I need to add to 2 liters of 0.1 M NH3 to get a pH of 11.3. The given K_b for NH3 is 1.8e-5. The equilibrium equation is NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH-.

Hmm, I remember that NH3 is a weak base. When you add NH4Cl, which is a salt of NH4+, it will create a buffer solution with NH3. Buffer solutions use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, right? Oh wait, but wait—Henderson-Hasselbalch is usually in terms of pKa, but here we have a base. So maybe I should think in terms of pOH first.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for bases. Let me think. The HH equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But since we're dealing with a base, maybe it's better to use the version for bases: pOH = pKb + log([BH+]/[base]). Alternatively, I can convert pKa from the K_b.

Wait, another approach: since the solution is a buffer of NH3 (a weak base) and NH4+ (its conjugate acid), the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be written as:

pOH = pKb + log([NH4+]/[NH3])

But I know the pH, which is 11.3. So pOH would be 14 - 11.3 = 2.7.

So, substituting:

2.7 = pKb + log([NH4+]/[NH3])

Wait, but what's pKb? Since K_b is 1.8e-5, pKb is log(1/(1.8e-5)) → wait no, pKb is the negative log of K_b. So pKb = -log(1.8e-5) ≈ let's calculate that. 

1.8e-5 is between 1e-5 (which is pKb 5) and 1e-4 (pKb 4). Let me compute it accurately. Log(1.8) is approx 0.2553. So log(1.8e-5) is log(1.8) + log(1e-5) → 0.2553 -5 = -4.7447. So pKb is 4.7447? Wait, no. Wait, pKb = -log(Kb). So if Kb is 1.8e-5, then pKb is 4.7447. Right.

So plugging into the equation:

2.7 = 4.7447 + log([NH4+]/[NH3])

Subtract 4.7447 from both sides:

2.7 - 4.7447 = log([NH4+]/[NH3])

That gives: -2.0447 = log([NH4+]/[NH3])

Taking antilog on both sides:

10^(-2.0447) = [NH4+]/[NH3]

Calculating 10^-2.0447. Hmm, 10^-2 is 0.01. 0.0447 is about 10^-0.0447 ≈ 0.89. So 0.01 * 0.89 ≈ 0.0089. So the ratio [NH4+]/[NH3] is approximately 0.0089.

Wait, but wait. Let me get a more precise calculation. Let me compute 10^-2.0447.

Since 2.0447 is 2 + 0.0447.

10^-2 is 0.01. Now 10^-0.0447. Let me compute that.

Log(0.89) is about -0.0498. So 10^-0.0447 is a bit higher than that. Maybe around 0.90? Let's see:

Using a calculator approach, 0.0447 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0447 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.103. So e^-0.103 ≈ 0.902. So 10^-0.0447 ≈ 0.902. So 0.01 * 0.902 = 0.00902. So the ratio is approximately 0.00902. Let's say 0.009 for simplicity.

So [NH4+] = 0.009 * [NH3].

Now, the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.1 M in 2 liters. But when we add NH4Cl, which dissociates completely, the concentration of NH4+ will be equal to the amount of NH4Cl added divided by the total volume.

Let me set up variables:

Let’s let x be the moles of NH4Cl added. Since the volume is 2 liters, the concentration of NH4+ will be x/2 M.

The concentration of NH3 will be initially 0.1 M, but some of it reacts with H2O to form NH4+ and OH-. Wait, but in the buffer solution, the NH3 concentration is approximately 0.1 M minus the amount that reacts. However, since K_b is small, and the solution is buffered, the change in NH3 concentration might be negligible. Hmm, but wait, that might not be the case here.

Wait, another approach. The total concentration of NH3 and NH4+ comes from both the initial NH3 and the added NH4Cl. Let me think in terms of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again.

Alternatively, the buffer equation can be written as:

pOH = pKb + log([NH4+]/[NH3])

We have pOH = 2.7, pKb = 4.7447.

So 2.7 = 4.7447 + log([NH4+]/[NH3])

So log([NH4+]/[NH3]) = 2.7 -4.7447 = -2.0447

So [NH4+] / [NH3] = 10^-2.0447 ≈ 0.00902 as before.

So [NH4+] = 0.00902 * [NH3]

But the initial concentration of NH3 is 0.1 M. However, when NH4Cl is added, the [NH3] isn't exactly 0.1 anymore because some of it is converted to NH4+.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with an ICE table.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The initial solution is 2 L of 0.1 M NH3. So moles of NH3 initially are 0.2 moles.

When we add NH4Cl, which is a strong salt, it dissociates completely, providing NH4+ ions. Let's say we add x moles of NH4Cl. So the moles of NH4+ become x, and the volume is 2 L → [NH4+] = x/2.

The moles of NH3 initially are 0.2, but some will react to form NH4+ and OH-.

Wait, but maybe I should consider the buffer equation more carefully.

Alternatively, since the solution is a buffer, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should hold, considering the concentrations after adding NH4Cl.

So,

pOH = pKb + log([NH4+]/[NH3])

We can express [NH4+] as (x/2), where x is the moles of NH4Cl added, because each mole of NH4Cl gives one mole of NH4+.

And [NH3] is the initial 0.1 M minus any that reacts. But wait, the reaction is NH3 + H2O → NH4+ + OH-. So for each mole of NH4+ formed from NH3, a mole of NH3 is consumed. But since we're adding NH4+ from NH4Cl, perhaps the [NH3] remains approximately 0.1 M because the added NH4+ shifts the equilibrium.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. After adding x moles of NH4Cl to 2 liters, the [NH4+] is x/2.

The [NH3] is approximately 0.1 M because NH3 is a weak base and only slightly ionized. But wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe a better approach is to let the concentration of NH3 be (0.1 - y) and NH4+ be (x/2 + y), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, considering that the added NH4+ is x/2 and the NH3 is 0.1, but this might not account for the shift in equilibrium.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set up the equation considering the common ion effect. Since NH4+ is being added, the ionization of NH3 will be suppressed.

So, the concentration of NH3 is approximately 0.1 M, because the added NH4+ shifts the equilibrium to the left, so [NH3] is roughly 0.1 M. Is that a valid assumption?

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think. If I add a significant amount of NH4+, the [NH3] might not be exactly 0.1 M, but the change might be small. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the [NH3] is approximately 0.1 M, and [NH4+] is x/2.

Wait, but the buffer equation is [NH4+]/[NH3] = 0.00902. So if [NH3] is 0.1, then [NH4+] would be 0.1 * 0.00902 = 0.000902 M.

Wait, but if [NH4+] is 0.000902 M, that would mean x/2 = 0.000902 → x = 0.001804 moles. That's 1.804e-3 moles, which is 1.804e-3 * 2 = 3.608e-3 moles in 2 liters? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.000902 M is moles per liter. So in 2 liters, that's 0.000902 * 2 = 0.001804 moles of NH4+.

Wait, but wait, that would mean adding about 0.0018 moles of NH4Cl, which is 0.0018 * 53.49 g/mol ≈ 0.096 g. Hmm, looking at the options, F is 0.096 g, so that's a possible answer. But wait, am I missing something here?

Wait, perhaps I made an assumption that [NH3] is 0.1 M, but in reality, when you add NH4+, the [NH3] might be a little less. So perhaps a more accurate approach is needed.

Alternative approach: Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for base.

The equation is:

pOH = pKb + log([BH+]/[B])

Where BH+ is the conjugate acid (NH4+) and B is the base (NH3).

We have pOH = 2.7, pKb = 4.7447.

So,

2.7 = 4.7447 + log([NH4+]/[NH3])

→ log([NH4+]/[NH3}) = 2.7 -4.7447 = -2.0447

So [NH4+]/[NH3] = 1e-2.0447 ≈ 0.00902 as before.

So [NH4+] = 0.00902 * [NH3]

But the total concentration of NH3 and NH4+ comes from the initial NH3 and the added NH4Cl.

Wait, initial moles of NH3: 0.1 M * 2 L = 0.2 moles.

Let x be the moles of NH4Cl added. Then, [NH4+] = x/2 (since volume is 2 L).

Let [NH3] = 0.1 - y, where y is the amount that reacts. But I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the [NH3] is approximately 0.1 M because the ionization is minimal, but the [NH4+] comes from both the dissociation of NH3 and the added NH4Cl.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's model the solution using the Kb expression.

The reaction is NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH-

The Kb is [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3] = 1.8e-5.

But in the solution, [NH4+] is from both the dissociation of NH3 and the added NH4Cl. Let me denote the concentration of NH4+ as (x/2 + [OH-]), since each NH3 that dissociates produces one OH- and one NH4+. Wait, no, because for each NH3 that reacts, [OH-] increases by that amount and [NH4+] increases by the same amount.

Wait, but adding NH4Cl gives a concentration of x/2 of NH4+.

So the total [NH4+] in solution is x/2 + [OH-], because each mole of NH3 that dissociates contributes one mole of NH4+ and one mole of OH-.

But wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the [NH4+] is approximately x/2 because the contribution from NH3 dissociation is minimal compared to the added NH4Cl.

But wait, if x/2 is much larger than [OH-], then [NH4+] ≈ x/2. Let's see.

Let me proceed with that assumption. So [NH4+] ≈ x/2.

And [OH-] can be found from pH. Since pH = 11.3, pOH = 2.7 → [OH-] = 10^-2.7 ≈ 2e-3 M.

So substituting into the Kb expression:

Kb = [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3] = (x/2)(2e-3)/(0.1) = 1.8e-5.

Simplify this equation:

(x/2)(2e-3) / 0.1 = 1.8e-5

Multiply the terms:

(x/2) * 2e-3 = x * 1e-3.

Then, divide by 0.1: (x *1e-3)/0.1 = x * 1e-2.

So equation becomes:

x * 1e-2 = 1.8e-5

Solve for x:

x = (1.8e-5) / (1e-2) ) = 1.8e-3 moles.

So x is 0.0018 moles of NH4Cl.

Now, calculate the mass: moles * molar mass.

Molar mass of NH4Cl: N is 14, H4 is 4, Cl is 35.45. So 14 + 4 +35.45 = 53.45 g/mol.

So mass = 0.0018 mol *53.45 g/mol ≈ 0.0961 g.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.096 g. So that's the closest.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned about the assumption that [NH4+] ≈ x/2 and ignoring the contribution from NH3 dissociation. Let me check if that's valid.

The assumption is that x/2 >> [NH4+] from NH3 dissociation. Let's calculate [NH4+] from dissociation.

From the Kb expression:

Kb = [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3] → [NH4+] = (Kb * [NH3])/[OH-]

We have [NH3] ≈ 0.1 M, [OH-] = 2e-3 M.

So [NH4+] = (1.8e-5 * 0.1) / (2e-3) = (1.8e-6) / 2e-3 = 9e-4 M.

Compare this to the [NH4+] from NH4Cl, which is x/2 = 0.0018 mol / 2 L = 0.0009 M = 9e-4 M.

Oh wait, so both contributions are equal in this case. So the [NH4+] is 9e-4 from NH4Cl and 9e-4 from NH3 dissociation? That can't be right because that would make the total [NH4+] 1.8e-3 M. But wait, that would change the equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that [NH4+] is x/2. Actually, the total [NH4+] is x/2 (from NH4Cl) plus the [NH4+] from NH3 dissociation, which is equal to [OH-] because each NH3 that dissociates produces one OH- and one NH4+.

So [NH4+] = x/2 + [OH-].

So substituting into the Kb expression:

Kb = (x/2 + [OH-]) * [OH-] / [NH3] = 1.8e-5.

We know [OH-] = 2e-3 M, and [NH3] is approximately 0.1 M (if x is small, which it is, as we found x to be 0.0018 mol in 2 L → 0.0009 M, which is much less than 0.1 M, so [NH3] ≈ 0.1 M).

So substituting:

( (x/2) + 2e-3 ) * (2e-3) / 0.1 = 1.8e-5.

Multiply the terms:

( (x/2) + 2e-3 ) * 2e-3 = 1.8e-5 * 0.1 → 1.8e-6.

So,

( (x/2) + 2e-3 ) * 2e-3 = 1.8e-6.

Let me compute this step by step.

Let me denote A = x/2.

So equation becomes:

(A + 2e-3) * 2e-3 = 1.8e-6.

Expanding:

A * 2e-3 + (2e-3)^2 = 1.8e-6.

Calculate each term:

A * 2e-3 = 2e-3 A.

(2e-3)^2 =4e-6.

So:

2
