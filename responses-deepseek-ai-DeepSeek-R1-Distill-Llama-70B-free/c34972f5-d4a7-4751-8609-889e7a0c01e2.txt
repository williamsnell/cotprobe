Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the binding energy of Carbon-12. Hmm, I remember binding energy is the energy required to split a nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons. Or, alternatively, the energy released when the nucleus is formed from them. Right.

The question is asking for the total binding energy and the average binding energy per nucleon for _6C^12. The options are from A to J. I think I need to calculate both values.

First, I should recall the formula for binding energy. Oh right, it's calculated using the mass defect. The mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons because some mass is converted into energy, which is the binding energy. So the formula is:

Binding Energy (BE) = Δm * c²

Where Δm is the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the separated nucleons and the actual mass of the nucleus.

Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So I need the masses of a proton, a neutron, and the Carbon-12 nucleus.

Wait, the exact masses. Let me think. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 atomic mass units (amu), and a neutron is about 1.008665 amu. The mass of Carbon-12 is exactly 12 amu by definition, since the atomic mass unit is based on Carbon-12.

So the total mass of the separated nucleons is (6 * 1.007276) + (6 * 1.008665). Let me calculate that.

6 * 1.007276 = 6.043656 amu
6 * 1.008665 = 6.0519 amu (Wait, 1.008665 *6: 1.008665 *5 is 5.043325, plus 1.008665 is 6.05199, approximately.)

Adding them together: 6.043656 + 6.05199 = 12.095646 amu.

Wait wait, Carbon-12's mass is 12 amu, so the mass defect Δm is 12.095646 - 12 = 0.095646 amu.

Now, converting that into energy. 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c². So Δm * c² = 0.095646 amu * 931.5 MeV/u.

Let me calculate that: 0.095646 * 931.5. Hmm, 0.09 times 931 is about 83.79, but more accurately:

0.095646 * 931.5. Let's do it step by step.

931.5 * 0.09 = 83.835
931.5 * 0.005 = 4.6575
931.5 * 0.000646 ≈ let's see, 0.0006 *931.5 is about 0.5589, and 0.000046 *931.5≈0.0428. So total for 0.000646 is about 0.5589 + 0.0428 = 0.6017.

Adding all together: 83.835 +4.6575 = 88.4925, plus 0.6017 gives about 89.0942 MeV. So total binding energy is approximately 89.1 MeV.

Wait but wait, I think I might have made a small mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

0.095646 * 931.5:

Let me compute 0.095646 * 931.5.

First, 0.09 * 931.5 = 83.835
Then 0.005 * 931.5 = 4.6575
Then 0.000646 *931.5 = let's compute 0.0006 *931.5= 0.5589, 0.000046 *931.5= about 0.0428. So total 0.6017.

Adding all: 83.835 +4.6575 = 88.4925; 88.4925 +0.6017= 89.0942 MeV. Approximately 89.09 MeV.

So the total binding energy is about 89.09 MeV.

Now, the average binding energy per nucleon is total BE divided by the number of nucleons. Carbon-12 has 12 nucleons.

So 89.09 /12 ≈ 7.424 MeV per nucleon.

Wait, that would be around 7.42 MeV. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: 92.22MeV and 7.68MeV per nucleon.

Option G: 88MeV and 7.33MeV.

Option J: 90MeV and 7.5MeV.

Hmm. But wait, my calculation gives a total BE of about 89.09, which isn't exactly an option, but let's look at the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the mass values.

Wait, the mass of a proton is 1.007276 amu, and neutron is 1.008664 amu (using more precise numbers). So for 6 protons and 6 neutrons:

6 * 1.007276 = 6 * 1.007276 → 6 * 1.007 is 6.042, 6*0.000276=0.001656 → total 6.043656 amu.

6 * 1.008664 = 6 *1.008664 → 6*1.008 is 6.048, 6*0.000664=0.003984 → total 6.051984 amu.

Summing gives 6.043656 + 6.051984 = 12.09564 amu.

Mass of Carbon-12 is 12.000000 amu exactly.

So mass defect is 12.09564 -12 = 0.09564 amu.

Multiply by 931.5 MeV/amu:

0.09564 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute that accurately.

0.09564 * 931.5:

I'll compute 0.095 * 931.5 = 0.095 *900=85.5; 0.095*31.5=2.9925 → total 88.4925.

Now, 0.00064 *931.5 = 0.0006*931.5=0.5589; 0.00004*931.5=0.03726 → total 0.59616.

So 0.09564 is 0.095 +0.00064. So 88.4925 +0.59616 = 89.08866 MeV. So approximately 89.09 MeV.

So total BE is about 89.09 MeV, which is approximately 89.1 MeV. But let's check the options.

Looking at the options, the closest total BE is option C: 92.22, which is higher. Option G is 88, which is lower, and option J is 90.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me think again.

Wait another approach—using the semi-empirical binding energy formula. But I don't remember all the constants exactly, and perhaps it's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to known values for Carbon-12.

Wait, I recall that the binding energy of Carbon-12 is around 92 MeV, but wait, my calculation says 89. Let me think. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mass of Carbon-12 includes the electrons in the atom, but wait, no—because the atomic mass unit is defined based on the nucleus. Wait, no, when you're calculating the mass defect, you have to use the atomic masses, but for the nucleus calculation. Hmm, maybe I confused atomic mass and nuclear mass.

Wait, wait, the atomic mass includes electrons, but the nuclear mass doesn't. Oh, right! I think I made a mistake here. Because when we talk about binding energy, we compare the mass of the nucleus to the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So actually, the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons.

Wait, Carbon-12 has an atomic number of 6, so it has 6 electrons. So the atomic mass (which includes electrons) is 12.000000 amu. The nuclear mass would be 12 amu minus 6*(mass of an electron).

The mass of an electron is about 0.00054858 amu. So 6 * 0.00054858 = 0.0032915 amu.

So the nuclear mass is 12.000000 - 0.0032915 = approximately 11.9967085 amu.

But wait, the sum of the individual nucleons is 12.09564 amu as before.

So the mass defect is 12.09564 (sum of nucleons) - 11.9967085 (nuclear mass) = 0.0989315 amu.

Wait, that's a bigger mass defect than before. So, that would make the binding energy higher.

Wait, that would change the calculation. So perhaps I did it wrong earlier. Because earlier I assumed the nucleus's mass is 12 amu, but that's the atomic mass. The nuclear mass is less because we have to subtract the electrons' mass.

So let me recalculate.

Sum of the individual nucleons (protons and neutrons): 6*(1.007276) + 6*(1.008664) = as before, 12.09564 amu.

Nuclear mass of Carbon-12: atomic mass (12.000000) minus 6*electron mass (6*0.00054858) → 12.000000 - 0.00329148 = 11.9967085 amu.

So mass defect Δm = 12.09564 - 11.9967085 = 0.0989315 amu.

Now, BE = 0.0989315 * 931.5 MeV/u → let's compute that.

0.0989315 * 931.5 → Let's compute 0.09 *931.5 =83.835; 0.008 *931.5=7.452; 0.0009315 *931.5 ≈ let's see, 0.0009 *931.5=0.83835, 0.0000315 *931.5≈0.02932. So adding:

0.09: 83.835
0.008:7.452 → total so far 91.287
0.0009:0.83835 → 92.12535
0.0000315:0.02932 → 92.15467.

But wait, 0.0989315 is 0.09 +0.008 +0.0009315.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 0.0989315 * 931.5 = ?

Compute 0.0989315 * 931.5.

Let me do it step by step.

931.5 * 0.09 = 83.835

931.5 * 0.008 = 7.452

931.5 * 0.0009 = 0.83835

931.5 * 0.0000315 = approximately 0.02932.

Wait, but wait, 0.0989315 = 0.09 + 0.008 + 0.0009 + 0.0000315.

So adding all these products:

83.835 +7.452 =91.287

+0.83835 → 92.12535

+0.02932 → 92.15467 MeV.

So approximately 92.15 MeV.

Ah, so the total binding energy is about 92.15 MeV, which is much closer to option C, which is 92.22 MeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of the proton is slightly different. Let me check exact values.

Proton mass: 1.007276 amu

Neutron mass: 1.008664 amu

Electron mass: 0.0005485799 amu.

So, the sum of nucleons: 6*(1.007276 + 1.008664) = 6*(2.01594) = 12.09564 amu.

Atomic mass of Carbon-12 is 12.000000 amu.

Nuclear mass = 12.000000 - 6*(0.0005485799) = 12 - 0.0032914794 = 11.9967085 amu.

Δm = 12.09564 -11.9967085 = 0.0989315 amu.

BE = 0.0989315 *931.5 = 92.154 MeV.

So, approximately 92.15 MeV total binding energy.

Now, average per nucleon: 92.15 /12 = approx 7.679 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 92.22 and 7.68.

Option G: 88MeV and 7.33.

Option J:90 and 7.5.

Wait, so 92.15 is close to 92.22. Let me see what the exact calculation gives.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 0.0989315 *931.5 more accurately.

Let me compute 0.0989315 × 931.5:

First, 0.0989315 × 900 = 89.03835.

0.0989315 ×31.5 = let's compute this.

0.0989315 ×30 = 2.967975.

0.0989315 ×1.5=0.14839725.

So total 2.967975 +0.14839725=3.11637225.

Adding to 89.03835: 89.03835 +3.11637225 = 92.154722 MeV.

So BE is approximately 92.1547 MeV. So 92.15 MeV.

Average is 92.15 /12 = 7.6792 MeV per nucleon.

Looking at the options, option C is 92.22 MeV and 7.68 MeV per nucleon. That's very close.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a miscalculation? Let me check.

Wait, let me check the exact masses. Maybe I should use more precise values.

Wait, the exact mass of the proton is 1.007276 amu.

Neutron: 1.008664 amu.

Electron: 0.0005485799 amu.

So the sum for 6 protons and 6 neutrons is 6*(1.007276 + 1.008664) = 6*(2.01594) = 12.09564 amu.

Nuclear mass: 12.000000 - 6*(0.0005485799) = 12 - 0.003291479 = 11.996708521 amu.

Δm = 12.09564 - 11.996708521 = 0.098931479 amu.

BE = 0.098931479 *931.5 MeV/u.

Calculate 0.098931479 *931.5:

Let me compute this accurately.

Break it down:

0.098931479 = 0.09 + 0.008 + 0.000931479.

0.09 ×931.5 = 83.835.

0.008 ×931.5 =7.452.

0.000931479 ×931.5 ≈ Let's compute 0.0009 ×931.5=0.83835, 0.000031479×931.5≈0.0293.

So 0.83835 + 0.0293 =0.86765.

Adding all together: 83.835 +7.452 =91.287; +0.86765=92.15465 MeV.

So BE is approximately 92.15465 MeV.

So that's about 92.15 MeV.

Average: 92.15 /12 =7.6792 MeV per nucleon.

Looking at the options, option C is 92.22 MeV and 7.68.

Hmm, perhaps the exact values used in the problem are slightly different. Maybe the mass of the electron is taken as 0.000548 amu, which would make the calculation a bit different.

Wait, if I use 0.000548 instead, then 6 *0.000548 =0.003288.

So nuclear mass is 12 -0.003288=11.996712 amu.

Δm =12.09564 -11.996712=0.098928 amu.

BE =0.098928 ×931.5 = ?

0.098928 *931.5 = ?

Compute 0.098928 ×900=89.0352

0.098928 ×31.5= let's compute:

0.098928 ×30=2.96784

0.098928 ×1.5=0.148392

Total 2.96784 +0.148392=3.116232

Total BE=89.0352 +3.116232=92.151432 MeV.

So 92.15 MeV.

Average per nucleon 7.679 MeV.

Option C says 92.22 MeV and 7.68. So that's very close. So perhaps the given options rounded up.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, they used more approximate values, like taking the electron mass as 0.00055, leading to a slightly higher nuclear mass, thus a slightly lower Δm. Wait, no—if electron mass is higher, then nuclear mass is lower, leading to higher Δm, which would increase BE.

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact numbers again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the atomic mass of Carbon-12 as 12.01 instead of 12.000000. But no, Carbon-12 is exactly 12 amu by definition.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the binding energy per nucleon is being approximated. My calculation gives 7.68 MeV, which matches option C's 7.68.

So option C is 92.22 MeV and 7.68 MeV per nucleon.

But wait, our calculation gives 92.15 MeV, which is close to 92.22. The difference is about 0.07 MeV. Maybe due to rounding in the constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states the binding energy as 92.2 MeV, which would round to 92.22 as in option C. And the average is 7.68, which matches.

So the correct option would be C: 92.22 MeV and 7.68 MeV.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the options for option C are 92.22 and
