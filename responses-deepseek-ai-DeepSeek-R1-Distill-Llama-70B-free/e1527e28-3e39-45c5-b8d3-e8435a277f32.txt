Okay, so I have this question about gift taxes, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the scenario is that a taxpayer owns an insurance contract on his own life and designates his two children as equal beneficiaries. He makes all the premium payments. The question is asking how many gifts of property have been made for gift tax purposes.

Hmm, so I remember that in the US, gift taxes apply when someone transfers property to another without receiving something of equal value in return. But there are exceptions and certain rules, especially when it comes to life insurance policies.

Wait, the taxpayer owns the policy and pays all the premiums. The beneficiaries are his two children. So when does a gift occur here? Let me think about each part.

When you buy a life insurance policy and name beneficiaries, typically the payment of premiums might be considered as making a gift each time a premium is paid. But wait, is that the case? Or is there a different rule when the insured is the one paying the premiums?

I recall that if the insured pays the premiums on a policy where others are beneficiaries, each premium payment isn't considered a gift. Because the payment is for the right to receive the death benefit, but the insured retains control over the policy, like the ability to change beneficiaries or take loans against it. So if the owner (the taxpayer) is making the payments, they're not making a gift each time they pay a premium.

Alternatively, if someone else pays the premiums on a policy they don't own, that might be a different situation. Like, if a grandparent pays the premiums on a policy owned by a child, that could be a gift. But here, the owner is the one paying, so probably no gift each time.

Wait, but what about when the policy is set up? Maybe when the beneficiaries are designated, is that a gift? Or is it only when the policy is transferred?

Wait, no, because the taxpayer owns the policy. So when he dies, the death benefit goes to the children. But during his lifetime, he's making the premium payments. So maybe each premium payment isn't a gift because he's retaining ownership and control. The idea is that the only thing that happens is that upon his death, the children get the proceeds. But until then, the taxpayer can change the beneficiaries, borrow against the policy, etc. So each premium payment isn't a transfer of a present interest; it's more like funding the policy that will benefit the children upon his death.

Alternatively, I think the rule is that as long as the insured (the taxpayer) is paying the premiums, there's no gift tax implication because the payments aren't being made to the beneficiaries. So in this case, he's just paying for the insurance, and the beneficiaries are just thatâ€”beneficiaries who receive the proceeds upon his death.

Wait, but I remember something about the annual exclusion. Oh wait, no, that applies when you make a gift during your lifetime. Like, if you give someone cash or property, you can exclude up to a certain amount each year. But in this case, the only thing happening is the payment of premiums, which doesn't count as a gift.

So, putting this together, the taxpayer isn't making any gifts when he pays the premiums because he's the owner and retains control. So the number of gifts made for gift tax purposes is zero.

Looking at the options, option C is zero. So the answer should be C.

The question involves determining the number of gifts made for gift tax purposes when a taxpayer owns a life insurance policy on his own life, designates his two children as equal beneficiaries, and pays all the premiums. 

For gift tax purposes, a gift occurs when there is a transfer of property without receiving something of equal value in return. However, in this scenario, the taxpayer retains ownership and control of the insurance policy. This means the taxpayer can change beneficiaries, borrow against the policy, or take other actions, indicating that no transfer of a present interest has occurred. The premium payments are made by the taxpayer to maintain the policy, and the beneficiaries will only receive the death benefit upon the taxpayer's passing. Since the taxpayer retains control and the payments are not transfers to the beneficiaries, no gifts are made for gift tax purposes.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: Zero.

Answer: C
