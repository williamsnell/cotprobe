Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about CO2 gas expanding adiabatically. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 2.0 moles of CO2 gas. It's initially at 25°C, which is 298 K. The pressure is 10 atm, and it's confined in a cylinder with a cross-sectional area of 10.0 cm². Then it expands adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm until the piston moves 20 cm. I need to find the change in temperature, ΔT. The options are from A to J.

Wait, adiabatic expansion. Right, in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings (Q=0). But wait, this is expansion against a constant external pressure, so it's not a reversible process. So I can't just use the simple formulas like TV^(γ-1) = constant, because those are for reversible processes.

Hmm, right. So for an adiabatic process with work done against a constant external pressure, the first law applies: ΔU = W, because Q=0. So the internal energy change equals the work done by the system.

Wait, the system is expanding, so work is done by the system. But wait, in thermodynamics, work done by the system is negative, but since the process is against an external pressure, the work is calculated as P_ext * ΔV.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. The work done by the system (expansion) is W = -P_ext * ΔV. But in the first law, ΔU = Q + W. Oh wait, I might have that sign wrong. Wait, no, in physics, work done by the system is considered negative. So in the formula, W is negative. But in the first law, ΔU = Q - W (where W is work done by the system). Or is it the other way around? Different conventions can be confusing. Let me clarify.

Wait, I think IUPAC defines work done on the system as positive. So if the system does work on the surroundings, W is negative. So ΔU = Q + W. Since it's adiabatic, Q=0. So ΔU = W. But W here is the work done on the system. If the system is expanding, then the work done by the system is positive, so work done on the system would be negative. Therefore, ΔU = - (work done by the system).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equation: ΔU = -P_ext * ΔV, since the work done by the system is P_ext * ΔV (because external pressure is what's pushing against). So in this case, work done by the system is positive, so ΔU would be negative if the system is losing energy as work.

Wait, maybe I should approach it more carefully.

The formula for work done by the system during expansion against a constant external pressure is W = -P_ext * ΔV. But since the system is expanding, ΔV is positive (volume increases), so W is negative if P_ext is positive. But wait, when a gas expands against an external pressure, the work done by the gas is P_ext multiplied by the change in volume, but since the system is doing work, the internal energy decreases.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is W = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). Because the system is pushing against the external pressure, moving the piston. So if the piston moves out by Δx, then the volume change ΔV is area times Δx.

So in this problem, the piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. The cross-sectional area is 10.0 cm², which is 10e-4 m². So ΔV = area * distance = 10e-4 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-4 m³? Wait, wait, 10 cm² is 10 * (1e-2 m)^2 = 10e-4 m². Oh wait, no, wait. 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². Therefore, 10 cm² is 10 * 1e-4 = 1e-3 m². Oh wait, no, wait. 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10 * 1e-4 m² = 1e-3 m², yes.

So the piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So ΔV = area * distance = 1e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-4 m³. Oh wait, no, wait, 1e-3 m² is 0.001 m². 0.001 m² * 0.2 m = 0.0002 m³, which is 2e-4 m³. Right.

So the work done by the system is W = P_ext * ΔV. But wait, P_ext is given in atm, and ΔV is in m³. I need to convert units to joules, since work is in J.

P_ext is 1.0 atm. Let's convert that to Pascals. 1 atm = 101325 Pa. So P_ext = 101325 Pa.

ΔV is 2e-4 m³.

So W = P_ext * ΔV = 101325 Pa * 2e-4 m³ = 101325 * 2e-4 = Let's compute that. 101325 * 2 is 202650. Multiply by 1e-4: 202650 * 1e-4 = 20.265 J. So approximately 20.265 J.

But wait, since the work is done by the system, the internal energy change is ΔU = -W. Because in the first law, ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. But if the work is done by the system, W is negative. So ΔU = -W. So ΔU = -20.265 J.

Wait, no, wait. The work done by the system is W = P_ext * ΔV. Since the system is doing work, the internal energy decreases. So ΔU = -W. So if W is 20.265 J, then ΔU = -20.265 J.

But wait, in the formula for work, since the system is expanding, the work done by the system is positive. So in the equation ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So if the system does work, W is negative, so ΔU = -W. So yes, ΔU = -20.265 J.

Now, ΔU is related to the temperature change. For an ideal gas, ΔU = n * C_v,m * ΔT.

Wait, yes. Because for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So ΔU = n * C_v,m * (T_final - T_initial).

So we can solve for ΔT = (ΔU) / (n * C_v,m).

Given that n is 2.0 moles, and C_v,m is 28.8 J/(mol·K).

So ΔU is -20.265 J.

So ΔT = (-20.265 J) / (2.0 mol * 28.8 J/(mol·K)).

Let me compute that.

First, compute denominator: 2.0 * 28.8 = 57.6 J/K.

So ΔT = -20.265 / 57.6 ≈ Let's calculate that.

Divide 20 by 57.6: 20 / 57.6 ≈ 0.347. So 20.265 / 57.6 is a bit more, maybe around 0.351 or so. But wait, 57.6 * 0.35 = 20.16, so 0.35 would give 20.16, and 20.265 -20.16 = 0.105 left. So 0.105 /57.6 ≈ 0.0018. So total is approximately 0.3518. So about -0.352 K.

But wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: -0.645 K

B: -0.562 K

C: -0.410 K

D: -0.223 K

E: -0.500 K

F: -0.295 K

G: -0.347 K

H: -0.150 K

I: -0.725 K

J: -0.479 K

Hmm, closest to -0.352 K is option G: -0.347 K. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the work done.

Wait, the expansion is against an external pressure of 1 atm. So the work done is P_ext × ΔV.

But wait, I think I might have gotten the pressure unit wrong. Let's double-check.

1 atm is 101325 Pa, correct. ΔV is 2e-4 m³. So 101325 * 2e-4 = ?

Compute 101325 × 2e-4:

101325 × 2 = 202650.

202650 × 1e-4 = 20.265 J. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again: is the work done by the system equal to P_ext × ΔV, or is it P_ext × (V_final - V_initial)? Because when the system expands, it's doing work against the external pressure, so yes, it should be P_ext × ΔV, with ΔV positive when expanding.

So W = 20.265 J. Then ΔU is -20.265 J.

So ΔT = (-20.265) / (2 × 28.8) = (-20.265) / 57.6 ≈ let's compute it more accurately.

57.6 is denominator.

20.265 ÷ 57.6:

57.6 × 0.35 = 20.16.

20.265 -20.16 = 0.105.

0.105 /57.6 = approximately 0.001823.

So total ΔT ≈ - (0.35 + 0.001823) = -0.3518 K.

So approximately -0.352 K. The closest option is G: -0.347 K, which is -0.347. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, another thing: the initial and final states. Since the process is adiabatic, but it's an irreversible expansion. Wait, is there any other factor I'm missing? Because in an irreversible adiabatic expansion, the work is calculated as P_ext × ΔV, which is what I did. So the approach seems correct.

Wait, but wait: CO2 is a polyatomic gas, and sometimes Cv is given as (5/2) R for diatomic, but in this problem, they gave Cv,m as 28.8 J/(mol·K). Let me check that: R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So 28.8 /8.314 ≈ 3.46. Hmm, that's close to (5/2 R) which would be around 20.785, but wait, wait, CO2 is a linear molecule, so maybe it's (5/2 R) for translation and rotation, but vibration may contribute. But the problem gives Cv as 28.8, so I have to use that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial volume is not needed because the process is adiabatic, but no, in this case, it's an expansion against a constant external pressure, so the work is only dependent on P_ext and ΔV.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the cross-sectional area. Let's recheck that.

The cross-section is 10.0 cm². 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10 * 1e-4 = 1e-3 m², correct. Then the piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So ΔV = area * distance = 1e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-4 m³. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the calculation for ΔT.

ΔT = (-20265 J) / (2 * 28.8 * 1000)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 20.265 J is the work, so ΔU is -20.265 J. Then ΔT is (-20.265) / (2 * 28.8) = (-20.265) / 57.6 ≈ -0.3518 K.

So approximately -0.352 K, which is closest to option G: -0.347 K.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the work. Let me compute that again.

P_ext = 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

ΔV = 2e-4 m³.

So W = P_ext * ΔV = 101325 * 2e-4.

Compute 101325 * 2 = 202650.

202650 * 1e-4 = 20.265 J. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used P in kPa? No, because 1 atm is 101.325 kPa, which is 101325 Pa.

Wait, another thought: The problem says that the data refers to 298.15 K unless stated otherwise. The initial temperature is 25°C, which is 298.15 K. So that's correct.

So all right, I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately -0.352 K. The closest option is G: -0.347 K. But wait, let me check if any of the other options are closer.

Option G is -0.347, which is 0.005 less in magnitude than our calculation. Hmm, maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the work calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the piston moving 20 cm refers to the change in height, so ΔV is area * 20 cm, but I have to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, 20 cm is 0.2 meters, correct. Area is 10 cm² = 1e-3 m², correct. So ΔV = 1e-3 * 0.2 = 2e-4 m³, correct.

Hmm, another thought: Is the work done equal to P_ext × (V_final - V_initial), or is it P_ext × V_initial × (some ratio)? No, in this case, since it's a constant external pressure, the work is P_ext × ΔV.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial volume is needed to compute something else, but I don't think so because the process is adiabatic and we're calculating the work based on external pressure.

Wait, but wait a second. Actually, in an adiabatic expansion where the external pressure is less than the initial pressure, the system does work, and the internal energy decreases, leading to a drop in temperature. So our approach seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the work in a different way. Let me think. Alternatively, the work can be calculated as W = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). But since the process is adiabatic, the initial and final states are determined, and perhaps I should compute V_initial and V_final using the ideal gas law.

Wait, that's another approach. Let me try that.

Compute initial volume V_initial using ideal gas law: PV = nRT.

n = 2.0 mol, R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T=298 K.

P_initial = 10 atm.

So V_initial = (nRT)/P = (2.0 * 0.0821 * 298) / 10.

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642; 0.1642 * 298 ≈ let's compute 0.1642 * 300 = 49.26, but minus 0.1642 * 2 = 0.3284. So 49.26 - 0.3284 = 48.9316.

So V_initial ≈ 48.9316 / 10 = 4.893 liters.

Now, the piston moves 20 cm. So the change in volume is ΔV = area * distance.

Area is 10 cm² = 10 * (1 cm)^2. Since 1 cm = 0.01 m, 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² = 1e-3 m².

Distance moved is 20 cm = 0.2 m.

Thus, ΔV = 1e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-4 m³.

Convert that to liters, since 1 m³ = 1000 liters. So 2e-4 m³ = 0.2 liters.

Wait, no: 1 m³ = 1e3 liters. So 2e-4 m³ = 2e-4 * 1e3 liters = 0.2 liters.

So ΔV = 0.2 L.

So V_final = V_initial + ΔV = 4.893 L + 0.2 L = 5.093 L.

Now, using the ideal gas law again, P_final * V_final = n R T_final.

But wait, the external pressure is 1.0 atm. Wait, no. The external pressure is what the gas is pushing against, but the final pressure of the gas would be equal to the external pressure if the piston is free to move until it stops. So in the final state, the pressure inside would be 1.0 atm, because otherwise, the piston would continue moving.

So P_final = 1.0 atm.

So using ideal gas law at final state: P_final V_final = n R T_final.

We can solve for T_final.

T_final = (P_final V_final) / (n R).

Plugging in the numbers:

P_final = 1.0 atm.

V_final = 5.093 L.

n = 2.0 mol.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So T_final = (1.0 * 5.093) / (2.0 * 0.0821) = 5.093 / (0.1642) ≈ Let's compute that.

5.093 divided by 0.1642.

Well, 0.1642
