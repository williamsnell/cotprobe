Question:

 Select the best English interpretation of the given arguments in predicate logic.
Wn ∨ Wm
(∀x)[Lx ⊃ (Dx ⊃ ~Wx)]
Ln • Dn	/ ~(∀x)~Wx

Options:

A: Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and not out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.

C: Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is not a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.
D: Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.
E: Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.
F: Either Nancy or Marvin are not at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.
G: Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.
H: Either Nancy or Marvin are not at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.
I: Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are at work if they are not out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.

Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out the correct English interpretation of the given predicate logic arguments. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the premises and the conclusion:

1. Wn ∨ Wm
2. (∀x)[Lx ⊃ (Dx ⊃ ~Wx)]
3. Ln • Dn
4. Conclusion: ~ (∀x)~Wx

And I need to match this structure to one of the options provided (A to J).

Let me start by translating each part into English.

Starting with the first premise: Wn ∨ Wm. So, Wn is "Nancy is at work" and Wm is "Marvin is at work." So this translates to "Either Nancy or Marvin is at work."

Next, the second premise is a bit more complex: (∀x)[Lx ⊃ (Dx ⊃ ~Wx)]. This is a universal statement. Let's parse the implication inside. Lx is "x is a lawyer," Dx is "x is out to dinner," and ~Wx is "x is not at work." So the structure is Lx implies (Dx implies ~Wx). In other words, "If x is a lawyer, then if x is out to dinner, x is not at work." Or more naturally, "All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner." So that's the second premise.

The third premise is Ln • Dn. Ln is "Nancy is a lawyer," and Dn is "Nancy is out to dinner." So this combines to "Nancy is a lawyer and she is out to dinner."

The conclusion is ~ (∀x)~Wx. The negation of "for all x, x is not at work." So this is equivalent to "There exists someone who is at work," or "Not everything is not at work," which means "Something is at work."

Now, let's look at the options to see which one matches this structure.

Option A: "Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and not out to dinner. So not everything is not at work."

Wait, the third premise says Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner, so Option A says she's not out to dinner, which contradicts. So A is incorrect.

Option B: "Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work."

Wait, the second premise in the original is "All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner," but Option B says "All lawyers are at work if they are out to dinner," which is the opposite. So B is incorrect.

Option C: "Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is not a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work."

But the third premise says Nancy is a lawyer, so Option C says she's not, which is wrong. So C is out.

Option D: "Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work."

This seems close. The premises match what I translated. Let's check the conclusion. The original conclusion is ~ (∀x)~Wx, which is "There exists someone at work," or "Not everything is not at work." But Option D's conclusion is "So not everything is at work." Wait, that's different. Because "not everything is at work" would mean that some are not, but the original conclusion is that some are at work. So D's conclusion is incorrect. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, let me clarify: ~ (∀x)~Wx is equivalent to ∃x Wx, meaning "There exists an x such that x is at work," i.e., "Something is at work." So the conclusion should be "So, something is at work," which would translate to "not everything is not at work." So looking for an option that says the conclusion is "not everything is not at work."

Let me check the options again. Option A: conclusion is "not everything is not at work." Option D: conclusion is "not everything is at work." So D's conclusion is wrong.

Option E: "Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work."

The second premise here is different. The original is "All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner." Option E's second premise is "All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work," which is the converse. So E is incorrect.

Option F: "Either Nancy or Marvin are not at work. ... " Wait, the first premise is Wn ∨ Wm, so this is incorrect because F says "not at work."

Option G: "Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work."

This looks correct so far. Let's check the conclusion. G's conclusion is "not everything is not at work," which matches our original conclusion. So that's possible.

Wait, let me check all. Let's go through each option.

Option G:

1. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. (Correct)
2. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. (Correct)
3. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. (Correct)
4. Conclusion: So, not everything is not at work. (Which is correct because it means at least Nancy or Marvin is at work.)

Wait, but earlier I thought the conclusion in the original is ~ (∀x)~Wx, which is "there exists someone at work." So "not everything is not at work" is correct.

So Option G seems to fit.

Wait, let me check Option D again. D's conclusion is "not everything is at work," which would mean that some are not at work, but the original conclusion is that some are at work. So D's conclusion is incorrect.

Option G's conclusion is correct, so G might be the right choice.

Wait, but looking again, the original premises are Wn ∨ Wm, which is "Either Nancy or Marvin is at work." So the conclusion is ~ (∀x)~Wx, which is "There exists someone at work," which is exactly what Wn ∨ Wm states. So is the conclusion just restating the first premise? That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the argument is using the premises to derive the conclusion, so the conclusion would be something that follows from the premises. So let's think about the structure.

Premise 1: Wn ∨ Wm.
Premise 2: (∀x)(Lx → (Dx → ~Wx))
Premise 3: Ln ∧ Dn.

We can use these to derive the conclusion.

From Premise 3, since Ln is true and Dn is true, and from Premise 2, for x = n (Nancy), Ln → (Dn → ~Wn). Since Ln and Dn are true, then ~Wn must be true. So Nancy is not at work (~Wn).

From Premise 1, Wn ∨ Wm. But we now know that Wn is false, so Wm must be true. So Marvin is at work.

Thus, the conclusion is that someone is at work, which is ~ (∀x)~Wx, or "There exists someone at work."

So the conclusion in the options should reflect that. Now, looking back at the options:

Option G says the conclusion is "So not everything is not at work," which aligns with ~ (∀x)~Wx.

So yes, Option G fits.

Wait, but let me check if any other options match.

Option A: The third premise is wrong. It says Nancy is not out to dinner.

Option B: Second premise is wrong.

Option C: Third premise wrong.

Option D: Conclusion is wrong.

Option E: Second premise wrong.

Option F: First premise wrong.

Option G: All correct.

So the correct answer should be Option G.

The question requires selecting the best English interpretation of the given predicate logic arguments. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **First Premise (Wn ∨ Wm):** Translates to "Either Nancy or Marvin is at work."
2. **Second Premise ((∀x)[Lx ⊃ (Dx ⊃ ~Wx)]):** Translates to "All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner."
3. **Third Premise (Ln • Dn):** Translates to "Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner."
4. **Conclusion (~ (∀x)~Wx):** Translates to "Not everything is not at work," meaning "There exists someone who is at work."

Now, evaluating the options:

- **Option A:** Incorrect because it states Nancy is "not out to dinner," contradicting the third premise.
- **Option B:** Incorrect because it states "All lawyers are at work if they are out to dinner," which is the opposite of the second premise.
- **Option C:** Incorrect because it states Nancy is "not a lawyer," contradicting the third premise.
- **Option D:** Incorrect because its conclusion is "not everything is at work," which does not match the original conclusion.
- **Option E:** Incorrect because its second premise is the converse of the original.
- **Option F:** Incorrect because its first premise is "Either Nancy or Marvin are not at work," which contradicts the original.
- **Option G:** Correct. It accurately translates all premises and matches the conclusion "not everything is not at work."
- **Option H:** Incorrect because its first premise is "Either Nancy or Marvin are not at work," which contradicts the original.
- **Option I:** Incorrect because its second premise is stated incorrectly.
- **Option J:** Incorrect because its second premise is the converse of the original.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option G**, as it accurately reflects the premises and the conclusion.

Answer: G
