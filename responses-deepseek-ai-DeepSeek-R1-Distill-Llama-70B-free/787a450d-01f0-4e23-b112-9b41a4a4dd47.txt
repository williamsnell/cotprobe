Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about a potato moving under Earth's gravity with air resistance. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem has two parts, part (a) and part (b). Let's tackle them one by one.

**Part (a): Finding the terminal velocity when the potato is released from rest.**

Okay, so the potato is in Earth's gravity, and there's an air resistive force acting on it. The mass of the potato is 0.5 kg, and the resistive force is given as -k m v, where k is 0.01 s^-1. Wait, so the force is proportional to velocity, right? Because it's -k m v. So F = -k m v. But wait, usually, air resistance is modeled as F = -kv or F = -k v^2, depending on the situation. Since this is linear in v, I guess it's a viscous drag type of force.

When the potato is released from rest, it starts moving downward. The forces acting on it are gravity pulling it down and air resistance opposing the motion. So the net force is the sum of these two.

Wait, Newton's second law says F_net = m a, which is m dv/dt. So let's write that equation.

The gravitational force is mg downward, and the air resistance is upward (since it's opposing the motion), so F_air = -k m v. Hmm, wait, actually, the sign depends on direction. Let me set up the coordinate system: let's say upward is positive, so acceleration due to gravity is -g. So the net force is mg (down) minus the air resistance (up). Wait, no: the gravitational force is mg downward, so in the negative direction, F_gravity = -m g. The air resistance is opposing the velocity, so if the potato is moving down (velocity negative), the air resistance force would be upward, which is positive. So F_air = -k m v. Wait, if velocity is downward (v negative), then F_air is positive (upward). So the net force is F_air + F_gravity.

Wait, let me clarify. The forces acting on the potato are:

1. Gravitational force: F_gravity = m g, acting downward (negative direction if upward is positive).
2. Air resistance: F_air = -k m v. Since if v is negative (downward), F_air becomes positive (upward).

So applying Newton's second law:

F_net = m a = m (dv/dt) = F_gravity + F_air = (-m g) + (-k m v).

Wait, wait. No, wait: F_air is -k m v. So when velocity is positive (up), F_air is negative (down), which makes sense. When velocity is negative (down), F_air is positive (up), opposing the motion. So the net force is:

m dv/dt = -m g - k m v.

Wait, no: because F_gravity is m g downward, which is negative if upward is positive. So F_gravity = -m g. F_air is -k m v, which for a downward velocity (v negative) becomes positive. So the net force is F_air + F_gravity = (-k m v) + (-m g) = -m (g + k v). Wait, no: that can't be right. Because if velocity is in the direction of motion, the forces would add up.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write all forces as vectors. Let me set upward as positive y direction.

So F_gravity is downward, so it's -m g (since g is about 9.8 m/s²). The air resistance force is opposite to the velocity, so F_air = -k m v. So if the potato is moving downward (v negative), F_air is positive (opposite direction).

The net force is F_net = F_air + F_gravity.

So F_net = (-k m v) + (-m g) = -m (g + k v).

Wait, no, because F_air is -k m v, F_gravity is -m g. So the sum is -k m v - m g = -m (g + k v).

So Newton's equation:

m dv/dt = -m (g + k v).

Divide both sides by m:

dv/dt = - (g + k v).

Wait, that's a differential equation. Hmm. Let me rearrange:

dv/dt = -k v - g.

Wait, that's a linear differential equation. The equation is dv/dt + k v = -g.

To solve this, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is e^{∫k dt} = e^{kt}.

Multiply both sides by e^{kt}:

e^{kt} dv/dt + k e^{kt} v = -g e^{kt}.

The left side is d/dt (v e^{kt}).

So, d/dt (v e^{kt}) = -g e^{kt}.

Integrate both sides:

v e^{kt} = ∫ -g e^{kt} dt + C.

The integral of -g e^{kt} dt is (-g/k) e^{kt} + C.

So,

v e^{kt} = (-g/k) e^{kt} + C.

Divide both sides by e^{kt}:

v(t) = (-g/k) + C e^{-kt}.

Now, apply initial condition. At t=0, the potato is released from rest, so v(0) = 0.

So,

0 = (-g/k) + C e^{0} => C = g/k.

So,

v(t) = (-g/k) + (g/k) e^{-kt}.

Factor out g/k:

v(t) = (g/k) (e^{-kt} - 1).

Wait, but wait a minute. The terminal velocity is the maximum velocity attained when the acceleration becomes zero. So when dv/dt approaches zero. Let's see what happens as t approaches infinity.

As t → ∞, e^{-kt} → 0.

So v(t) approaches (g/k)(0 - 1) = -g/k.

So the terminal velocity is v_t = -g/k. But wait, the negative sign indicates direction. Since we took upward as positive, this is downward, which makes sense. The magnitude is g/k.

Given that g is approximately 9.8 m/s², and k is 0.01 s^-1.

So v_t = 9.8 / 0.01 = 980 m/s.

Wait, that's a huge number. That can't be right. Wait, 9.8 divided by 0.01 is 980. Hmm, but the options don't include 980. The options are 800, 500, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the setup again. Oh! Wait, the air resistance is given as -k m v. Wait, but I might have missed a negative sign. Let me double-check the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion was set up incorrectly. Let me try another approach.

The net force is the sum of forces in the same direction. The potato is falling under gravity and experiencing air resistance upward. So the net force is mg (down) minus the air resistance force (up). So F_net = mg - k m v. Because when moving down, the air resistance is up, opposing the motion.

Wait, but in terms of acceleration, when the potato is moving down, the acceleration is positive if we take down as positive. Maybe I should choose the coordinate system with down as positive, which might make things easier.

Let me try that. So, in the downward direction as positive.

Then, gravitational force is mg, air resistance is opposite to velocity. So F_air = -k m v (since v is positive downward, F_air is negative, i.e., upward).

Wait, no: If upward is negative, then v is positive, and F_air is -k m v, which would be negative, meaning upward direction. Wait, perhaps it's easier to just take down as positive.

So, taking down as positive, the forces are:

F_gravity = m g (positive),
F_air = -k m v (because v is positive, so F_air is negative, opposing the motion).

So net force F_net = m g - k m v.

Then, by Newton's second law, F_net = m a = m dv/dt.

So,

m dv/dt = m g - k m v.

Divide both sides by m:

dv/dt = g - k v.

That's the correct differential equation. So it's dv/dt = g - k v.

Ah, okay, that's different from before. So I must have messed up the sign when I took upward as positive. Now, taking down as positive makes it clearer.

So the DE is dv/dt = g - k v.

At terminal velocity, the acceleration is zero, so dv/dt = 0.

So,

0 = g - k v_t.

Solving for v_t:

v_t = g / k.

Given that g is 9.8 m/s², k = 0.01 s^-1.

So,

v_t = 9.8 / 0.01 = 980 m/s.

Wait, that's the same result as before, but looking at the options, there's no 980. The options are 1000, 800, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction or the equation setup.

Wait, maybe the problem says the air resistance is -k m v, but perhaps it's actually -k v. Because in some models, the drag force is F = -k v. So let me check the problem statement again.

The problem states: "air resistive force of -k m v". So F = -k m v. So my initial setup was correct in that aspect.

Wait, but in part (a), the options don't include 980, so perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the calculation.

Wait, 9.8 divided by 0.01 is indeed 980. So unless the problem uses g = 10 m/s² for simplicity, let's see: 10 / 0.01 is 1000 m/s. Oh, perhaps the problem uses g =10 m/s². But the problem didn't specify, so we might assume g is 9.8.

But the options suggest 1000 is option E. Let me think again. Maybe I have an error in the equation.

Wait, if the net force is mg - (k m v), then Newton's law is m dv/dt = mg - kmv.

Divide by m: dv/dt = g - k v.

So the solution for terminal velocity is v_t = g/k.

But perhaps the air resistance term is different. Wait, sometimes air resistance is given as F = -k v^2, but in this problem, it's given as F = -k m v. So the setup should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in SI units, and I should confirm the value of g. Let me check: standard g is approximately 9.8 m/s², but sometimes 10 is used for simplicity. If we use g=10, then v_t is 10 / 0.01 = 1000 m/s. That's option E.

But the problem doesn't specify using g=10. Hmm, the options suggest that the answer is 1000 m/s, which would be option E. So perhaps in this problem, g is taken as 10 m/s².

So, perhaps part (a)'s answer is E: 1000 m/s.

Wait, but let me think again. If the problem says the potato is released from rest, and we have to find the terminal velocity under gravity and air resistance. So according to the equation, the terminal velocity is g/k, which with g=9.8 gives 980, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer assumes g=10, so 1000, option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the equation. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the air resistance is F = -k v, not F = -k m v. Because sometimes, the drag force is written as F = -k v, where k includes other factors like density and cross-sectional area, etc. But the problem says F = -k m v, so mass is included. So, perhaps the equation is correct as I did earlier. So then, v_t = (g m)/(k m) )? No, wait, no: in the equation, F_net = m g - k m v. So when F_net is zero, m g = k m v_t → v_t = g/(k). So the mass cancels out, which makes sense because in this model, terminal velocity is independent of mass, which is different from the typical F = -kv case. Hmm, but in reality, terminal velocity does depend on mass when the drag is proportional to velocity, because F_net = mg - (1/2) C rho A v^2, but in this problem, it's F = -k m v, so perhaps the model is different.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with part (a) as being 1000 m/s, assuming g=10. So, the answer would be E.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A:800, B:500, C:700, D:400, E:1000, F:1200, etc.

E is 1000 m/s. So that's the only option close to 980, assuming g=10.

So part (a) is E.

Now, part (b): Finding the maximum height when the potato is shot upward with an initial velocity of 120 m/s, same k=0.01 s^-1.

So, the potato is moving upward against gravity and air resistance. So the forces are gravity downward and air resistance upward (opposing the motion, so when moving up, air resistance is down). So the net force is F_net = -m g - k m v, where v is the upward velocity.

Wait, let me set up the equation again, but this time the potato is moving upward, so I'll take upward as positive.

So, F_gravity is downward: F_gravity = -m g.

Air resistance is opposite to velocity, so since velocity is upward, F_air is downward. So F_air = -k m v.

So net force F_net = F_gravity + F_air = (-m g) + (-k m v) = -m (g + k v).

Newton's law: m dv/dt = -m (g + k v).

Divide by m:

dv/dt = - (g + k v).

This is a differential equation. Let's write it as:

dv/dt = -k v - g.

We can write this as dv/dt + k v = -g.

This is a linear ODE. The integrating factor is e^{∫k dt} = e^{kt}.

Multiply both sides by e^{kt}:

e^{kt} dv/dt + k e^{kt} v = -g e^{kt}.

Left side is d/dt (v e^{kt}).

Integrate both sides:

∫ d/dt (v e^{kt}) dt = ∫ -g e^{kt} dt.

So,

v e^{kt} = (-g/k) e^{kt} + C.

Divide both sides by e^{kt}:

v(t) = (-g/k) + C e^{-kt}.

Now apply initial condition. At t=0, v(0)=120 m/s.

So,

120 = (-g/k) + C e^{0} → C = 120 + g/k.

So,

v(t) = (-g/k) + (120 + g/k) e^{-kt}.

We can factor this as:

v(t) = (120 + g/k) e^{-kt} - g/k.

We are to find the maximum height. The maximum height occurs when the velocity becomes zero. So we need to find the time t when v(t)=0, then find the displacement up to that time.

So set v(t) =0:

0 = (120 + g/k) e^{-kt} - g/k.

Let's solve for t.

(120 + g/k) e^{-kt} = g/k.

e^{-kt} = (g/k) / (120 + g/k) ) = [g/(k (120 + g/k)))].

Simplify denominator: 120 + g/k = (120 k + g)/k.

So,

e^{-kt} = [g/(k)] * [k/(120 k + g)] ) = g / (120 k + g).

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-kt = ln( g / (120 k + g) ).

Multiply both sides by -1:

kt = ln( (120 k + g)/g ).

So,

t = (1/k) ln( (120 k + g)/g ).

Now, let's compute this with the given values.

Given:

k=0.01 s^-1,

g=9.8 m/s².

So,

Compute (120 * 0.01 + 9.8 ) = 1.2 + 9.8 = 11.0 m/s².

So,

(120k + g)/g = 11.0 / 9.8 ≈ 1.122449.

Take ln of that:

ln(1.122449) ≈ 0.11575.

So,

t = (1/0.01) * 0.11575 ≈ 100 * 0.11575 ≈ 11.575 seconds.

So, the time to reach maximum height is approximately 11.575 seconds.

Now, to find the maximum height, we can integrate the velocity function from t=0 to t=11.575.

The velocity function is:

v(t) = (120 + g/k) e^{-kt} - g/k.

The displacement y(t) is the integral of v(t) from 0 to t.

So,

y(t) = ∫ v(t) dt from 0 to t.

Let me compute the integral.

y(t) = ∫ [ (120 + g/k) e^{-kt} - g/k ] dt.

Integrate term by term:

= (120 + g/k) ∫ e^{-kt} dt - (g/k) ∫ dt.

= (120 + g/k) ( (-1/k) e^{-kt} ) ) - (g/k) t + C.

Evaluate from 0 to t.

At time t, y(t) = [ (120 + g/k)(-1/k) e^{-kt} ) - (g/k) t ] - [ (120 + g/k)(-1/k) e^{0} ) - (g/k) *0 ].

Simplify:

= (120 + g/k)(-1/k)(e^{-kt}
