Okay, I need to find the energy stored in the magnetic field of a solenoid. Hmm, I remember that the energy stored is given by a formula involving the magnetic field strength and the volume. Let me think about the steps I need to take.

First, I think the formula for the energy stored (U) is U = (B² * Volume) / (2μ₀), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space. Oh wait, another version I remember is U = (1/2) * L * I², where L is the inductance of the solenoid. Maybe that's easier.

Right, so I can calculate the inductance first. The inductance L of a solenoid is given by L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l, where N is the number of turns, A is the cross-sectional area, and l is the length of the solenoid.

Let me jot down the given values. The solenoid is 30 cm long, so l = 0.3 meters. The diameter is 3 cm, so the radius is 1.5 cm, which is 0.015 meters. The number of turns N is 1000, and the current I is 10 amps.

Wait, the area A is πr². Let's calculate that. r = 0.015 m, so r squared is (0.015)^2 = 0.000225 m². Multiply by π gives A ≈ 0.00070685 m².

Now, the inductance L = (μ₀ * N² * A) / l. I remember that μ₀ is 4π × 10^-7 H/m. Plugging in the numbers:

L = (4πe-7 H/m) * (1000)^2 * 0.00070685 m²) / 0.3 m.

Calculating step by step:

1000 squared is 1e6. So,

L = (4πe-7) * 1e6 * 0.00070685 / 0.3

Multiply 4πe-7 by 1e6: 4πe-7 * 1e6 = 4π * 1e-1 = 0.4π ≈ 1.2566.

Then, multiply that by 0.00070685: 1.2566 * 0.00070685 ≈ 0.000888.

Wait, no, wait, 1e6 * 0.00070685 is 706.85. Oh wait, no, because 1e6 is 1,000,000 and 0.00070685 is 7.0685e-4. So 1e6 * 7.0685e-4 = 706.85.

So now, 4πe-7 * 1e6 * A is 706.85 * 4πe-7? Wait, maybe I need to recalculate that step.

Wait, let's go back. The formula is L = (μ₀ N² A) / l.

Plugging in:

μ₀ = 4πe-7,

N² = (1000)^2 = 1e6,

A = π*(0.015)^2 ≈ 7.06858e-4 m²,

l = 0.3 m.

So:

L = (4πe-7 * 1e6 * 7.06858e-4) / 0.3

Let me compute numerator first:

4πe-7 = 4 * 3.1416e-7 ≈ 1.2566e-6.

Multiply by 1e6: 1.2566e-6 * 1e6 = 1.2566.

Multiply by A (7.06858e-4):

1.2566 * 7.06858e-4 ≈ Let's compute that. 1.2566 * 0.000706858.

Hmm, 1 * 0.0007 is 0.0007, 0.25 * 0.0007 is 0.000175, 0.0066 *0.0007 is about 0.00000462. So adding those, approximately 0.0008796. So total numerator is about 0.0008796.

Now divide by l, which is 0.3: 0.0008796 / 0.3 ≈ 0.002932 H.

Wait, that gives L ≈ 0.002932 henrys.

Now, the energy U is (1/2) L I². I is 10 A, so I squared is 100.

So U = 0.5 * 0.002932 * 100.

Calculating that: 0.5 * 0.002932 = 0.001466. Multiply by 100 gives 0.1466 joules.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is 0.15 joule. That's really close to my calculation of ~0.1466. So the answer should be G.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in inductance. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should use another approach to calculate the energy. Maybe using the formula U = (B² * Volume)/(2μ₀). Let's see if that matches.

First, compute B, the magnetic field inside the solenoid. B = μ₀ * n * I, where n is turns per unit length. n is N/l. N=1000, l=0.3 m, so n=1000/0.3 ≈ 3333.333 turns/m.

So B = (4πe-7) * 3333.333 * 10.

Compute that: 4πe-7 is ~1.2566e-6. Multiply by 3333.333: 1.2566e-6 * 3e3 ≈ 3.77e-3. Multiply by 10: 0.0377 T.

Now, the volume of the solenoid is length times area. Volume V = l * A.

l is 0.3 m, A is π*(0.015)^2 ≈ 7.06858e-4 m².

So V = 0.3 * 7.06858e-4 ≈ 0.000212 m³.

Now, U = (B² * V) / (2μ₀). B is 0.0377 T.

B squared: (0.0377)^2 ≈ 0.00142 T².

So U = (0.00142 * 0.000212) / (2 * 4πe-7).

Calculate denominator: 2 * 4πe-7 ≈ 8πe-7 ≈ 2.5133e-6.

Numerator: 0.00142 * 0.000212 = approx 3.0084e-7.

So U = 3.0084e-7 / 2.5133e-6 ≈ 0.1196 joules.

Wait, that's about 0.12 J. Hmm. But earlier I had about 0.1466 J. There's a discrepancy here. Which method is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recheck.

B = μ₀ * (N/l) * I.

μ₀ = 4πe-7, N/l is 1000/0.3 ≈ 3333.333, I=10.

So B =4πe-7 *3333.333 *10.

4πe-7 *3333.333 is (4 * 3.1416e-7) *3333.333.

Wait, 4 * 3.1416 is about 12.5664, so 12.5664e-7 *3333.333.

12.5664e-7 = 1.25664e-6.

1.25664e-6 * 3e3 is 3.77e-3.

Multiply by 10: 0.0377 T. That part seems correct.

Then the volume: 0.3 m * π*(0.015)^2.

Wait, 0.015^2 is 0.000225, times π is ~0.00070685 m². Multiply by 0.3 m gives 0.000212 m³. Correct.

So B² is (0.0377)^2 = 0.00142 T².

Denominator: 2μ₀ = 2 *4πe-7 =8πe-7 ≈2.513e-6.

So numerator: 0.00142 * 0.000212 = 3.0084e-7.

Then U = 3.0084e-7 / 2.513e-6 ≈ 0.1196 J.

Wait, this is about 0.12 J, but earlier method gave ~0.1466 J. Hmmm. Why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the formulas. Let me check the correct formula for energy stored.

The energy stored in a magnetic field is indeed U = (B² * V)/(2μ₀). Alternatively, U = (LI²)/2. So why are the two methods giving different results?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in one of the steps.

Alternative approach: let me calculate the inductance again.

L = μ₀ N² A / l.

μ₀ =4πe-7, N=1e3, so N²=1e6.

A = π*(d/2)^2. d=3 cm=0.03 m. So radius is 0.015 m, area is π*(0.015)^2 = 7.06858e-4 m².

l=0.3 m.

So L= (4πe-7 * 1e6 * 7.06858e-4)/0.3.

Calculate numerator: 4πe-7 * 1e6 =4πe-7 * 1e6 =4π * 1e-1 = 0.4π ≈1.2566.

Then multiply by 7.06858e-4: 1.2566 *7.06858e-4 ≈ 0.000888.

Then divide by 0.3: 0.000888 / 0.3 ≈0.00296 H.

So L≈0.00296 H.

Then U=0.5 * L * I² = 0.5 * 0.00296 * (10)^2 =0.5 *0.00296 *100 =0.148 J.

Hmm, so about 0.148 J. But the first method via B gave me 0.1196 J. That's a difference of about 20%. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me check again.

Wait, B = μ₀ * (N/l) * I.

Yes, N/l is 1000/0.3 = 3333.333... turns/m.

μ₀ is 4πe-7, so:

B =4πe-7 *3333.333 *10.

Let me compute that step by step.

3333.333 *10=33333.333.

Multiply by 4πe-7: 33333.333 *4πe-7.

33333.333 *4 = 133,333.332.

Multiply by π ≈3.14159: 133,333.332 *3.14159 ≈4.189e5.

Now multiply by 1e-7: 4.189e5 *1e-7 = 0.04189 T.

Wait, wait a minute! I think I messed up the order of operations earlier. Let me recompute:

Wait, 3333.333 *10 is 33333.333.

Now, 33333.333 *4πe-7.

Compute 33333.333 *4 = 133333.333.

Multiply by π: 133333.333 *3.14159 ≈ 418,880.

But wait, that's 418,880 times 1e-7, because 4πe-7 is 4 * π * 1e-7.

So 418880e-7 = 0.041888 T.

Ah, so B is approximately 0.04189 T, not 0.0377 T as I previously calculated. So earlier mistake was in B calculation.

So B is about 0.04189 T.

Now, compute B squared: (0.04189)^2 = approx 0.001752 T².

Volume V =0.3 m * π*(0.015)^2 m² = 0.000212 m³.

So U = (B² * V)/(2μ₀) = (0.001752 * 0.000212) / (2 *4πe-7).

Compute numerator: 0.001752 * 0.000212 = 3.713e-7.

Denominator: 2 *4πe-7=8πe-7 ≈2.513e-6.

So U =3.713e-7 /2.513e-6 ≈ 0.1477 J.

Hmm, that's about 0.148 J, which matches the method using inductance.

So earlier mistake was in the calculation of B. I must have misplaced a decimal point. Now, both methods give approximately 0.148 J.

Looking back at the answer options, option G is 0.15 J, which is very close to 0.148 J.

So the correct answer must be G: 0.15 joule.

To determine the energy stored in the magnetic field of the solenoid, we use the formula for energy stored in an inductor:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2
\]

where \( L \) is the inductance of the solenoid, \( I \) is the current, and \( U \) is the energy stored. The inductance \( L \) of a solenoid is given by:

\[
L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{l}
\]

### Given Data:
- Length of the solenoid: \( l = 0.3 \, \text{m} \)
- Diameter of the solenoid: \( d = 0.03 \, \text{m} \), so radius \( r = 0.015 \, \text{m} \)
- Number of turns: \( N = 1000 \)
- Current: \( I = 10 \, \text{A} \)
- Permeability of free space: \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the cross-sectional area \( A \)
The cross-sectional area of the solenoid is:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.015)^2 \approx 7.06858 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the inductance \( L \)
Substitute the values into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{\mu_0 N^2 A}{l}
\]

\[
L = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) (1000)^2 (7.06858 \times 10^{-4})}{0.3}
\]

First, calculate \( N^2 = (1000)^2 = 10^6 \). Then:

\[
L = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) (10^6) (7.06858 \times 10^{-4})}{0.3}
\]

Simplify:

\[
L = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) (706.858)}{0.3}
\]

\[
L \approx \frac{(1.2566 \times 10^{-6}) (706.858)}{0.3}
\]

\[
L \approx \frac{0.000888}{0.3} \approx 0.00296 \, \text{H}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the energy \( U \)
Using \( U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2 \):

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} (0.00296) (10)^2
\]

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} (0.00296) (100) = 0.148 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy \( U \approx 0.148 \, \text{J} \) is closest to option **G: 0.15 joule**.

### Final Answer:
G
