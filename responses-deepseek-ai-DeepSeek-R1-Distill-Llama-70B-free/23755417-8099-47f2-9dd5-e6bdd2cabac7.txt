Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about the flame test for barium. When a barium compound is placed in a Bunsen burner flame, it decomposes into barium atoms, and these atoms undergo an electronic transition with a specific energy. The energy given is 3.62 × 10^-12 erg. I need to determine what color the flame would be based on this information.

Hmm, I remember that in flame tests, different metals emit different colors when their atoms are excited by the flame. The color is related to the energy of the electronic transition—the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state of the atom. When an atom is heated, electrons move to higher energy levels (excited states), and when they drop back down, they emit energy, which we see as light.

So the key here is to find out what wavelength of light corresponds to the given energy. Because once I know the wavelength, I can match it to a color in the visible spectrum.

Wait, the energy is given in ergs. I think I need to convert that to joules because the Planck equation uses joules. I remember that 1 joule is 10^7 ergs, right? So to convert ergs to joules, I divide by 10^7.

Let me do the calculation. The energy (E) is 3.62e-12 ergs. So in joules, that's 3.62e-12 erg / 1e7 erg/J = 3.62e-19 J.

Wait, wait. Let me check that math again. Oh no, wait: 1 J = 10^7 erg. So 1 erg = 1e-7 J. So to convert erg to joules, multiply by 1e-7. Oh wait no, because if E is in ergs, then E_joules = E_ergs * 1e-7. So for 3.62e-12 erg, it's 3.62e-12 * 1e-7 = 3.62e-19 J. Right, that makes sense.

Now, the Planck equation relates energy to wavelength. The equation is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. We need to solve for λ.

I remember that h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s and c is about 3.0e8 m/s.

So plugging in the values:

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

Let me plug in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3.0e8 m/s

E = 3.62e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / 3.62e-19.

Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 (because 6.626*3 is about 19.878, so 19.878e-26, which is 1.9878e-25).

Wait, wait, 6.626e-34 times 3e8: 6.626 *3 =19.878, and 10^-34 *10^8 = 10^(-34+8) = 10^-26. So 19.878e-26, which is 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, no, because the unit comes from h (J·s) times c (m/s), so J·s * m/s = J·m. But E is in J, so when you divide by E (J), the units would be m, which is correct for wavelength.

So back to the calculation: numerator is 1.9878e-25, denominator is 3.62e-19.

So λ = (1.9878e-25) / (3.62e-19) = (1.9878 /3.62) * 1e-6 meters.

Calculating 1.9878 /3.62: Let's see, 3.62 is about 3.6*1. So 1.9878 /3.62 ≈ 0.55.

So λ ≈ 0.55e-6 meters. Which is 5.5e-7 meters, or 550 nanometers (since 1e-9 meters is a nanometer, so 550e-9 m = 550 nm).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation more accurately. Let's compute 1.9878 divided by 3.62.

3.62 goes into 1.9878 how many times? 3.62 * 0.5 = 1.81, which is less than 1.9878. The difference is 1.9878 -1.81 = 0.1778. Then, 3.62 goes into 0.1778 about 0.049 times (because 3.62 *0.049 ≈0.17738). So total is approximately 0.549, about 0.55.

So λ ≈ 0.55e-6 m = 550 nm.

Wait, but wait: 550 nm is in the green region of the spectrum. The visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 550 nm is green, right? But wait, I'm a bit confused. I thought that around 500 nm is green, and 550 might be more towards yellow or maybe greenish-yellow.

Wait, let me think about the colors and their approximate wavelengths:

Violet: ~400 nm

Blue: ~450-495 nm

Green: ~495-570 nm

Yellow: ~570-590 nm

Orange: ~590-620 nm

Red: ~620-750 nm.

So 550 nm is within the green range, but towards the higher end, so maybe it's more of a yellow-green? Or perhaps a light green.

Wait, but wait, the options given are:

A: White

B: Pink

C: Yellow

D: Red

E: Blue

F: Violet

G: Purple

H: Indigo

I: Orange

J: Green

So 550 nm is green, so the answer would be J: Green.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because I remember that barium's flame test is actually apple green. So that aligns with this calculation, which gives around 550 nm, which is green. So the answer should be J: Green.

But wait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly. Let me go through the steps again.

Energy E = 3.62e-12 erg.

Convert to joules: since 1 J = 1e7 erg, so E_joules = 3.62e-12 erg * (1 J / 1e7 erg) = 3.62e-19 J.

Planck’s equation: E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3.0e8 m/s.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3.0e8) / (3.62e-19).

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 3.62e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.62e-19 = (1.9878 /3.62) *1e-6 m.

1.9878/3.62 ≈ 0.55. So λ ≈ 0.55e-6 m = 550 nm.

Yes, that's correct. So 550 nm is green, so the answer is J.

Wait, but I'm also recalling that sometimes in these problems, the energy might correspond to the energy per photon. So each photon's energy is E = hc/λ. So that part is correct.

Another check: using the wavelength, what color is 550 nm? It's green. So the answer is J.

To determine the color of the flame in the barium flame test, we start by analyzing the energy of the electronic transition provided: \( 3.62 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg} \). This energy corresponds to the emission of light as barium atoms return to their ground state after being excited in the flame.

### Step 1: Convert energy to joules
Since \( 1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{erg} \), we convert the energy to joules:
\[
E = 3.62 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg} \times \frac{1 \, \text{J}}{10^7 \, \text{erg}} = 3.62 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Use Planck's equation to find the wavelength
The relationship between energy and wavelength is given by Planck's equation:
\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad \lambda = \frac{hc}{E}.
\]
Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( E = 3.62 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

Substitute the values:
\[
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.0 \times 10^8)}{3.62 \times 10^{-19}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3.0 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

Now divide by the denominator:
\[
\lambda = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{3.62 \times 10^{-19}} = (1.9878 / 3.62) \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}.
\]

Perform the division:
\[
1.9878 / 3.62 \approx 0.55.
\]

Thus:
\[
\lambda \approx 0.55 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 550 \, \text{nm}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the wavelength to a color
The wavelength \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} \) corresponds to the green region of the visible spectrum. The visible spectrum ranges approximately from \( 400 \, \text{nm} \) (violet) to \( 700 \, \text{nm} \) (red), with green spanning from about \( 495 \, \text{nm} \) to \( 570 \, \text{nm} \). Therefore, \( 550 \, \text{nm} \) is green.

### Final Answer:
The flame test for barium produces a **green** flame.
