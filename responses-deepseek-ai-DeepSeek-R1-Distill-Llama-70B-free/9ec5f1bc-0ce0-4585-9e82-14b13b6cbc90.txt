Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to figure out the amount of heat transferred when a cylinder containing a mixture of saturated liquid water and vapor is heated until it's all vapor. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

The cylinder's volume is 5 m³. Initially, there's 0.05 m³ of saturated liquid water and 4.95 m³ of saturated vapor at 0.1 MPa. The process is heating until the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor. So, I need to find the heat transferred during this process.

Wait, first I should probably find the initial state of the water. The pressure is 0.1 MPa, which is 100 kPa. Let me recall the saturation properties of water at that pressure. I think at 100 kPa, the saturation temperature is 99.61 degrees Celsius. Okay, but more importantly, the specific volumes for liquid and vapor.

I remember that for water at 100 kPa:
- The specific volume of the liquid (v_f) is about 0.001043 m³/kg.
- The specific volume of the vapor (v_g) is around 43.36 m³/kg.

Right, so initially, the cylinder has a mixture of liquid and vapor. The volume is 5 m³, with 0.05 m³ being liquid and 4.95 m³ vapor. So I can find the masses of each phase.

For the liquid part:
Mass of liquid, m_l = volume_l / v_f = 0.05 m³ / 0.001043 m³/kg ≈ let's see, 0.05 / 0.001 is 50, but more accurately, 0.001043 is about 1.043e-3. So 0.05 / 0.001043 = approximately 47.93 kg. Hmm, close to 48 kg.

For the vapor part:
Mass of vapor, m_v = volume_v / v_g = 4.95 m³ / 43.36 m³/kg ≈ let's calculate that. 4.95 / 43.36 ≈ 0.1142 kg. So about 0.114 kg.

Wait, that's a tiny amount of vapor. That doesn't seem right. Wait, because 4.95 m³ divided by 43.36 m³/kg is roughly 0.114 kg, yes. So the total mass initially is m_l + m_v ≈ 48.044 kg.

But wait, let me double-check. Oh maybe I mixed up the specific volumes. Wait, v_g is 43.36 m³/kg, correct. So yes, 4.95/43.36 is about 0.114 kg.

Now, the process is heating until the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor. So all the liquid turns into vapor. That means the final state is saturated vapor at 0.1 MPa, and the total mass is m_l + m_v = 48.044 kg.

Wait, but when you heat the mixture, the liquid evaporates. So the heat added will be the latent heat needed to vaporize the liquid plus any heat needed to superheat the vapor? Wait no, because the final state is saturated vapor at the same pressure. So maybe it's just the latent heat to vaporize the liquid.

But wait, because the total volume is fixed. So initially, it's a mixture, and after heating, it's all vapor. So what changes is the specific volume. The total mass is the same, just changing phase.

Wait, another approach: the initial state is a mixture with quality x. Let me calculate the quality.

The total volume V = 5 m³. The specific volume v = V/m = 5/(48.044) ≈ 0.1041 m³/kg. Wait, quality x is (v - v_f)/(v_g - v_f). So plugging in the numbers:

v = 0.1041 m³/kg, v_f = 0.001043, v_g = 43.36.

x = (0.1041 - 0.001043)/(43.36 - 0.001043) ≈ (0.103057)/(43.359) ≈ 0.002376, so about 0.2376% quality. That seems very low, which makes sense because most of the volume is vapor.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary right now. Let's think about the heat transfer.

The heat added Q is the amount needed to convert the liquid into vapor. So that's the mass of the liquid multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization at 0.1 MPa.

What's the latent heat (h_fg) at 0.1 MPa? I think it's around 2258 kJ/kg. Let me confirm. Yeah, at 100 kPa, h_f is about 417.5 kJ/kg, h_g is 2675.5, so h_fg = h_g - h_f = 2258 kJ/kg.

So the mass of liquid is 47.93 kg. So Q = m_l * h_fg = 47.93 kg * 2258 kJ/kg ≈ let's calculate that. 47.93 * 2000 = 95,860. 47.93 * 258 = approx 47.93 * 200 = 9,586 and 47.93 * 58= 2,780. So 9,586 + 2,780 = 12,366. So total Q ≈ 95,860 + 12,366 = 108,226 kJ. Wait, but wait, that's 47.93 * 2258.

Wait, another way: 47.93 * 2258 = let's compute step by step. 47 * 2258 = ?

47 * 2000 = 94,000.

47 * 258 = 47*(200+50+8) = 47*200=9,400; 47*50=2,350; 47*8=376. So 9,400+2,350=11,750+376=12,126.

So 47 * 2258 = 94,000 +12,126 = 106,126.

Then 0.93 kg *2258 = approx 2,100 kJ.

So total Q ≈ 106,126 + 2,100 = 108,226 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is E:107500, H:104935, etc. Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

47.93 kg * 2258 kJ/kg = ?

Let me compute 47 *2258 = 47*(2200 +58) = 47*2200=103,400; 47*58=2,726. So 103,400 +2,726=106,126.

Now 0.93 kg *2258 = 0.93 *2000=1,860; 0.93 *258=240. So 1,860 +240=2,100.

So total 106,126 + 2,100 = 108,226 kJ.

Wait, but none of the options is 108,226. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:90k, B:130k, C:110k, D:125k, E:107500, F:99k, G:115k, H:104935, I:95k, J:120k.

Hmm, E is 107500, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, let's re-examine the initial mass. The initial volume is 5 m³, with 0.05 m³ liquid and 4.95 m³ vapor.

So m_l = 0.05 / v_f.

v_f at 0.1 MPa is 0.001043 m³/kg.

So m_l = 0.05 / 0.001043 ≈ 47.93 kg.

m_v = 4.95 / v_g. v_g at 0.1 MPa is 43.36 m³/kg.

So m_v = 4.95 /43.36 ≈ 0.1142 kg.

Total mass m_total = 47.93 + 0.1142 ≈ 48.044 kg.

Wait, but when the system is heated until it's all vapor, the specific volume should be v_g, right? So after heating, the total volume is 5 m³, so the specific volume is 5 / m_total.

Wait, but wait, m_total is 48.044 kg, so v_total = 5 /48.044 ≈ 0.1041 m³/kg.

But at 0.1 MPa, v_g is 43.36 m³/kg, which is much larger. So that can't be right. Wait, no. Because when you have a mixture, the specific volume is between v_f and v_g. But after heating, it becomes saturated vapor, so the specific volume is v_g.

Wait, no. If the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor at 0.1 MPa, the specific volume is v_g, which is 43.36 m³/kg. So the total mass after heating would be V_total / v_g = 5 /43.36 ≈ 0.1154 kg.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense because initially the mass was 48 kg. So I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The initial mass is m_l + m_v = 47.93 + 0.1142 ≈ 48.044 kg.

When we heat the cylinder, the mass remains the same. But the volume is fixed at 5 m³. So initially, the specific volume was v = 5 /48.044 ≈ 0.1041 m³/kg, which is a mixture. After heating, the entire mass is vapor, so the specific volume would have to be v = v_g =43.36 m³/kg. But wait, that's impossible because the volume is fixed at 5 m³.

Ah, I see the confusion. So if the volume is fixed, and the pressure is fixed because it's saturated vapor, then when you add heat, the temperature and pressure would normally increase. Wait, but the problem says it's heated until the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor. Wait, but at higher pressure? Or perhaps the pressure is allowed to rise. Wait, the initial pressure is 0.1 MPa, but after heating, perhaps the pressure increases. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that the pressure remains constant. Wait, the problem says "until the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor." So perhaps the pressure is allowed to increase until all the liquid evaporates. Hmm, but the options don't account for that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the process occurs at constant pressure, but that would require the volume to expand, which isn't the case here as the cylinder's volume is fixed. So maybe the pressure increases as heat is added, and eventually, all the liquid evaporates at a higher pressure.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is at constant pressure. Wait, but the cylinder is rigid, so volume is constant. If it's heated at constant volume until all liquid evaporates, the pressure would increase, and the final state would be superheated vapor? Or perhaps it's saturated vapor at a higher pressure.

Wait, but the problem states that the cylinder is filled with saturated vapor, so perhaps the final state is saturated vapor at a higher pressure, but how do we know what that pressure is?

Alternatively, perhaps the process is such that the pressure remains at 0.1 MPa, and the system is heated by adding heat until all the liquid evaporates. But if the pressure is kept constant at 0.1 MPa, then as heat is added, the specific volume would increase, but the volume of the cylinder is fixed. So that might not be possible.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

The initial state is a mixture at 0.1 MPa, with liquid and vapor. The volume is 5 m³. So the initial specific volume is v = 5/(m_l + m_v) = 5/(47.93 + 0.114) ≈ 5/48.044 ≈ 0.1041 m³/kg.

The final state is all vapor at the same pressure, 0.1 MPa. Wait, but if the pressure is the same, then the specific volume must be v_g =43.36 m³/kg. But the total volume is 5 m³, so the mass would be m = V/v_g =5 /43.36 ≈ 0.1154 kg, which is way less than the initial mass of 48 kg. That doesn't make sense because mass is conserved.

Wait, that's impossible because the mass can't change. So perhaps the pressure isn't constant. So when you heat the cylinder, the pressure increases until all the liquid is gone, and the final state is saturated vapor at some higher pressure.

But then, how do you determine the final pressure? Because without knowing the final pressure, you can't find the heat transferred.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe I should approach it using the ideal gas law, but water vapor isn't ideal, especially near saturation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe it's assumed that the pressure remains constant at 0.1 MPa, and the heat added is just the latent heat to evaporate the liquid, but that would require the volume to increase, which it can't because the cylinder is rigid. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the heat required to evaporate the liquid and also account for the change in internal energy of the vapor as it's heated from the initial state to the final state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is at constant pressure, but that would require the volume to change, which isn't the case here.

Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the initial state is a two-phase mixture, and the final state is saturated vapor, but the pressure must adjust so that the entire mass fits into the 5 m³ as vapor.

So, let me think: the final state is saturated vapor (state 2), and the mass is m_total =48.044 kg. The volume is 5 m³. So the specific volume v2 = V/m =5/48.044 ≈ 0.1041 m³/kg.

Wait, but for saturated vapor, v_g must be at least this value. So we need to find the pressure P2 where v_g(P2) =0.1041 m³/kg. Because at that pressure, the specific volume of saturated vapor is 0.1041, so the entire mass is vapor.

So, to find P2, we can look up or approximate where v_g =0.1041 m³/kg.

Wait, let me recall the saturation properties of water. At higher pressures, v_g decreases. For example, at 200 kPa, v_g is about 0.534 m³/kg. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, at higher pressures, v_g decreases. For example, at 100 kPa, v_g=43.36; at 200 kPa, v_g is lower, maybe around 18 m³/kg? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up units. Wait, no, 43 m³/kg is correct for low pressure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law to approximate. The ideal gas law is PV = mRT. But for water vapor, it's not ideal, but maybe it's a rough approximation.

At state 2, v2 =0.1041 m³/kg, which is much less than v_g at 100 kPa. So the pressure must be higher than 100 kPa.

But how much higher? Let me try to estimate.

Using the ideal gas law, P2 * v2 = R*T2.

But I don't know T2 yet. Alternatively, since it's saturated vapor, T2 is the saturation temperature at P2.

But without knowing P2, it's a bit of a circle.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation that for water, at moderate pressures, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the pressure remains at 0.1 MPa, but that leads to an impossible situation because the mass would have to decrease.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the heat required to evaporate the liquid at 0.1 MPa, ignoring the fact that the volume can't accommodate the vapor. But that doesn't make sense physically.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the vapor is compressed into the cylinder, so the pressure increases. So the heat added would include both the latent heat to evaporate the liquid and the work done to compress the vapor. Wait, but that's getting into work, which complicates things. But since the problem is about heat transfer, perhaps it's just the enthalpy change.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the process is heating at constant volume until all the liquid evaporates, which would require the pressure to increase, but the calculation would involve finding the final state where the specific volume equals v_g at some pressure P2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler, and the heat transferred is just the mass of the liquid multiplied by the latent heat at 0.1 MPa. So Q = m_l * h_fg.

Which would be 47.93 kg * 2258 kJ/kg ≈ 108,226 kJ.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:107500, which is 107,500 kJ. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the mass.

Wait, let me recalculate m_l.

m_l = 0.05 m³ / v_f = 0.05 / 0.001043 ≈ 47.93 kg.

h_fg at 0.1 MPa is 2258 kJ/kg.

So 47.93 * 2258 = Let me compute it more accurately.

47.93 * 2000 = 95,860.

47.93 * 258 = Let's break it down:

47.93 * 200 = 9,586.

47.93 * 50 = 2,396.5.

47.93 * 8 = 383.44.

Adding those: 9,586 + 2,396.5 = 11,982.5 + 383.44 = 12,365.94.

So total Q =95,860 +12,365.94 ≈ 108,225.94 kJ, approximately 108,226 kJ.

Hmm, but none of the options matches this exactly. The closest is E:107500 kJ. But perhaps I made a mistake in the specific volume of vapor.

Wait, let me double-check the specific volume values.

At 0.1 MPa (100 kPa), from
