Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an automobile drag racer and a hockey puck. Hmm, I'm trying to visualize what's going on. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the drag racer is driving a car with acceleration 'a' and instantaneous velocity 'v'. The tires have a radius r0 and they're not slipping. The question is about finding the initial velocity in the rotating system that makes the hockey puck appear motionless in the fixed system. The options are given as A through J, each with different expressions involving ω (omega) and either r0 or R.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the rotating system must be the car, right? Because the car is moving and perhaps rotating its tires. The hockey puck is presumably on the car or near it, but I'm not entirely sure. The key here is to find the initial velocity of the puck in the rotating frame so that in the fixed (inertial) frame, it's not moving.

Wait, that sounds a bit tricky. I remember that in rotating frames, you have to consider the Coriolis effect and the centrifugal force. Oh right, when an object is in a rotating frame, its motion is affected by these pseudo-forces.

Wait, but the question is about the puck appearing motionless in the fixed system. So, in the fixed (non-rotating) frame, the puck isn't moving. That means its velocity is zero in that frame. But in the car's frame, which is rotating, the puck must have a certain velocity that, when combined with the car's rotation, results in no movement in the fixed frame.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The fixed system is stationary, the car is moving with velocity v and accelerating a. The tires aren't slipping, so the point of contact with the ground is instantaneously at rest. That means the car's velocity is related to the angular velocity of the tires.

Oh right! For a rolling without slipping condition, the linear velocity v is equal to the angular velocity ω multiplied by the radius of the tire. So, v = ω * r0.

So, ω = v / r0. That's a useful relation.

Now, the puck is in the rotating system, which is the car's frame. In the car's frame, the puck has some initial velocity, say u. But because the car is rotating (or maybe the entire system is rotating?), the puck's velocity in the fixed frame will be a combination of the car's velocity and the puck's velocity in the rotating frame.

Wait, I think I need to consider how velocities transform between rotating and fixed frames. The transformation is given by adding the rotational component. So, the velocity in the fixed frame (V) is equal to the velocity in the rotating frame (u) plus the rotational velocity (ω × r), but I might be mixing vectors here.

Wait, no, perhaps it's simpler. Let me think about circular motion. If the car is moving in a straight line, but maybe the frame is rotating in another way. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.

Assuming that the car is moving forward with velocity v, and the tires are rotating with angular velocity ω such that v = ω r0. So, the car's frame is moving forward at v and possibly rotating around its own axis? Or maybe the problem is considering a rotating frame due to the car's acceleration. Hmm.

Wait, the question mentions the "rotating system" but doesn't specify. Maybe it's considering a non-inertial frame where the car is both translating and rotating. Alternatively, perhaps it's a frame that's rotating with the car's angular velocity.

Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "For what initial velocity in the rotating system will the hockey puck appear to be subsequently motionless in the fixed system?"

So, in the fixed system, the puck is not moving. So its velocity is zero. So, the velocity of the puck in the fixed frame is zero.

The puck's velocity in the fixed frame is the sum of the car's velocity (v) and the puck's velocity in the car's frame (u), adjusted for any rotation.

Wait, no. The car's frame is moving at velocity v and rotating with angular velocity ω. So, the puck's velocity in the fixed frame would be the car's velocity plus the puck's velocity in the rotating frame, but considering the rotation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of reference frames. The fixed frame (let's say Earth frame) sees the car moving with velocity v and the puck is stationary. The car's frame is moving with velocity v and possibly rotating. Alternatively, perhaps the car's frame is rotating with angular velocity ω, but that might not be the same as the tire's rotation.

Wait, maybe the rotating system is the car's frame that's both moving and rotating. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the car is moving in a circular path, making the frame rotate, but the problem says the car is a drag racer, which usually accelerates in a straight line, not going around a circle. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the car's acceleration a implies that it's moving in a straight line with acceleration a, and the tires are spinning with angular velocity ω related to the car's velocity. So, for the tires not slipping, v = ω r0, so ω = v / r0.

But the problem states that the puck appears motionless in the fixed frame. That means, in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is zero. So, the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is zero.

In the car's frame (rotating), the puck has an initial velocity u. So, when we transform this velocity to the fixed frame, it should be zero.

Wait, but how are the frames moving relative to each other. The car is moving with velocity v (in the fixed frame), and perhaps rotating with angular velocity ω. So, the transformation from the car's frame to the fixed frame would involve both the translational velocity and the rotational velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the car is not only moving forward but also rotating, so the puck's motion in the car's frame would involve both the car's forward velocity and its rotation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think of it as a non-inertial frame problem. The car is a non-inertial frame because it's accelerating (with acceleration a) and possibly rotating.

Wait, but the question is about the initial velocity in the rotating system (car's frame) so that in the fixed system the puck is motionless.

In the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is zero. So, the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is the sum of the car's velocity and the puck's velocity in the car's frame. But wait, that's only if the car is moving without rotation.

Wait, if the car is moving at velocity v in the fixed frame, and the puck has velocity u in the car's frame, then in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity would be v + u. But if the car is rotating, then u would have components due to rotation.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using vector addition. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's say the car is moving along the x-axis with velocity v and is rotating about its center with angular velocity ω. The puck is at some position relative to the car. But because the puck appears stationary in the fixed frame, the sum of the car's velocity and the puck's velocity in the car's frame, plus any effects due to rotation, must result in zero.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the Coriolis effect. In the rotating frame, the puck experiences a Coriolis force, but since the question is about kinematics (velocity), perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, let me think differently. For an object to be at rest in the fixed frame, its velocity must be zero. So, in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is zero. The puck's velocity in the fixed frame is the sum of the car's velocity (v) and the puck's velocity in the car's frame (u), plus the velocity due to the car's rotation.

But wait, the car is moving forward, and the tires are spinning. So, the car's rotation would cause points on the car (like where the puck is) to have a rotational velocity. So, if the puck is on the car, it would have a rotational velocity component of ω × r, where r is the position vector from the rotation axis.

Wait, perhaps the car is rotating with angular velocity ω, so any point at a distance r from the center has velocity ω r in the car's frame. But if the puck is in the car's frame, then to not move in the fixed frame, the sum of the car's forward velocity (v) and the puck's rotational velocity must be zero.

Wait, maybe the puck is located at a distance R from the center of rotation (which might be the center of the car). So, its velocity in the car's frame would be Rω in some direction, perhaps tangential. But for it to be stationary in the fixed frame, the car's forward velocity would have to counteract that.

Alternatively, perhaps the puck is moving in the opposite direction to the car's motion. So, if the car is moving forward at v, and the puck is moving backward at v in the car's frame, then in the fixed frame, it's stationary.

Wait, but the car is also rotating. So, the puck's velocity in the car's frame would have two components: one due to the car's forward motion and another due to rotation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's approach it step by step.

The car is moving with velocity v in the fixed frame, and it's rotating with angular velocity ω. The condition of no slipping gives us v = ω r0, where r0 is the tire radius.

The puck's velocity in the fixed frame is zero. So, the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is the sum of the car's velocity and the puck's velocity in the car's frame. But wait, that's only if we're ignoring rotation. Alternatively, the car's frame is moving and rotating, so the velocity transformation would involve more than just vector addition.

In a moving and rotating frame, the velocity in the fixed frame is given by:

V_fixed = V_car + Ω × r + V_rel

Where V_car is the car's velocity in the fixed frame (v), Ω is the angular velocity vector of the car's rotation, r is the position vector of the puck relative to the car's center of rotation, and V_rel is the puck's velocity in the car's frame.

But since the puck is to be stationary in the fixed frame, V_fixed = 0. So:

0 = v + Ω × r + u

Here, u is the puck's velocity in the car's frame (rotating frame). So, u = - (v + Ω × r)

Wait, but in this case, the car is moving forward, and the rotation is about the center. Let's say the car is rotating such that the angular velocity is perpendicular to the direction of motion. For example, if the car is moving along the x-axis, the rotation could be about the z-axis. So, the position vector r of the puck would be in the plane, say along the x or y direction.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact position of the puck, it's hard to compute this. Alternatively, perhaps the puck is at a distance R from the center of rotation, so Ω × r would be ω R in the tangential direction.

Wait, but the car's rotation direction is such that the tires are rolling without slipping. So, the direction of the car's motion is forward, which would be due to the tires rotating in the opposite direction. So, if the car is moving forward (+x), the tires are rotating clockwise (from the perspective of the car), so the angular velocity vector Ω is pointing into the car (negative z direction, if the car is moving along x).

So, if the puck is at a position r from the center, then Ω × r would give a velocity component. For example, if the puck is at position (R, 0) in the car's frame, then Ω (pointing in -z) is ω k̂. So, Ω × r would be ω k̂ × (R î) = ω R ĵ, a velocity in the +y direction.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the puck is located at a point where the rotational velocity would oppose the car's forward motion.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the problem in scalar terms. The car is moving forward at v, and the puck in the car's frame is moving at some velocity u. But because the car is also rotating, the puck's velocity in the fixed frame is the vector sum of v, the rotational component, and u.

But if the puck is to be stationary in the fixed frame, the sum of these should be zero. So:

v (car's velocity) + (rotational velocity at puck's position) + u (puck's velocity in car's frame) = 0.

Wait, but in this case, the rotational velocity is ω × r, where r is the position vector from the rotation axis. Let's say the puck is at a distance R from the center of rotation. Then, the rotational velocity would be ω R in the tangential direction. Let's assume that the rotation is such that this tangential velocity is in the same direction as the car's forward motion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the rotational velocity at the puck's position is opposite to the car's direction. So, the car moves forward at v, and the puck's rotational velocity is backward at ω R.

Wait, but the car's forward velocity is v = ω r0, because the tires are not slipping. So, v = ω r0. So, if the puck is at a distance R from the center, its rotational speed would be ω R.

So, in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity from the car's rotation would be in the same direction as the car's movement, but scaled by R instead of r0. So, if the puck is moving in the opposite direction in the car's frame, at velocity u, then the total would be:

v (car) + (ω R) (rotational) + u (puck in car's frame) = 0.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps I should model the car as a rotating frame. The car is moving forward at v, and the frame is rotating with angular velocity ω. So, in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is:

V_fixed = V_car + V_rot + V_rel,

where V_rot is the velocity due to rotation, and V_rel is the puck's velocity in the rotating frame.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the directions. Let me assume that the rotational velocity at the puck's position is in the opposite direction to the car's forward motion. For instance, if the car moves forward at v, the rotation might cause the puck to have a backward velocity component of ω R.

So, putting it all together:

V_fixed = v (car's forward velocity) + ( - ω R ) (rotational velocity) + u (puck's velocity in car's frame) = 0.

Wait, but if the puck's velocity in the car's frame is u in the forward direction, then in the fixed frame, it's adding to the car's velocity. But we want V_fixed to be zero, so:

v - ω R + u = 0.

But wait, from the condition of rolling without slipping, we have v = ω r0. So substituting that:

ω r0 - ω R + u = 0 → u = ω (R - r0).

Hmm, but looking at the answer options, they have terms like ω r0 or ω R. So, let's see.

Wait, perhaps the puck is at a distance r0 from the center, so R = r0. Then u = ω (r0 - r0) = 0. That would mean the puck isn't moving in the car's frame, so it would have velocity v in the fixed frame, which isn't zero. That's not what we want.

Alternatively, maybe the puck is at a different radius. Wait, perhaps the car's wheels have radius r0, but the puck is at a radius R from the car's center. So, if the car is moving forward, the rotational effect on the puck is ω R in the direction opposite to the car's motion. So, the fixed velocity would be v (car's) minus ω R (rotation) plus u (puck in car's frame) equals zero.

So, equation: v - ω R + u = 0.

But since v = ω r0, substituting:

ω r0 - ω R + u = 0 → u = ω (R - r0).

Wait, but if R > r0, then u is positive, meaning the puck moves in the same direction as the car's forward motion in the car's frame. But that would mean in the fixed frame, the puck's velocity is v + (ω R - ω r0) + u? No, I think I'm mixing up signs here.

Wait, maybe the rotational velocity is in the same direction as the car's motion. Let me think again. If the car's wheels are rotating clockwise (from above), then a point on the car at radius R would have a velocity ω R in the forward direction. So, the rotational velocity adds to the car's velocity.

So, the fixed velocity would be v (car) + ω R (rotation) + u (puck's velocity in car's frame) = 0.

But that would be:

v + ω R + u = 0.

But since v = ω r0, substituting:

ω r0 + ω R + u = 0 → u = -ω (r0 + R).

But that would make u negative, meaning the puck is moving backward in the car's frame. But looking at the options, they have positive coefficients, so maybe I'm getting the signs wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational velocity is in the opposite direction, so it's subtracted. Let me try that.

So, V_fixed = v (car) - ω R (rotation) + u (puck's velocity in car's frame) = 0.

Then,

v - ω R + u = 0 → u = ω R - v.

But v = ω r0, so u = ω R - ω r0 = ω (R - r0).

So, if R is greater than r0, u is positive, meaning the puck moves in the same direction as the car in the car's frame. But if R is less than r0, u would be negative.

But the problem states that the puck appears motionless in the fixed system, so we're looking for the initial velocity u in the rotating system (car's frame) that makes V_fixed = 0.

So, u = ω (R - r0).

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see an option that exactly matches this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 1.1 ω r0

B:
