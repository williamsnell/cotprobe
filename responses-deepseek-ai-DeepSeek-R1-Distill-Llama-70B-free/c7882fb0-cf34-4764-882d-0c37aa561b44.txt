Okay, so I've got this question here about a type of burial site, and I need to figure out the right term. Let me think through this step by step. The question is asking about a cemetery where the body decomposes naturally without a casket. Hmm, I've heard about different burial practices that are more environmentally friendly these days. 

Wait, I remember something called "green burial." I think that's when they don't use caskets or embalming fluids, which makes the process more natural and better for the environment. So the term "green" probably refers to being eco-friendly. That makes sense because green is often associated with environmentalism.

Looking at the options, option J is "Green." But let me check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Option A is "Eco-friendly," which is similar but not the term I've heard used for cemeteries. Option C, "Forest," might be part of it, like a forest cemetery, but I think that's more of a description of the location rather than the type of burial. 

Option G is "Naturalistic," which sounds related, but I don't think that's the specific term. "Biodegradable" is more about materials, so option H doesn't seem right. Option J, "Green," fits because I've heard the term "green cemetery" used in contexts where they focus on sustainable and natural burial practices without traditional caskets or vaults.

So I'm pretty confident the answer is J: Green.
