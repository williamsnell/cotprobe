Question:

If a machine costs initially $1,000,000, lasts for 10 years, and has a scrap value of $100,000 at the end of its life-time, how much depreciation should be taken into account each year in the current accounts? And how is this shown in the capital account?

Okay, so I have this question about depreciation accounting, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The machine costs $1,000,000 initially. It lasts for 10 years, and at the end, it's worth $100,000 as scrap. I need to find out how much depreciation should be taken each year for the current accounts. Also, I have to figure out how this is shown in the capital account. The options are from A to J, each with different amounts.

Hmm, I remember that depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. So, the company doesn't expense the whole cost in the first year but spreads it out. There are different methods, like straight-line, reducing balance, etc. But I think for this problem, they're probably using the straight-line method since it's the simplest and commonly used.

The straight-line method means that the depreciation each year is the same. The formula for annual depreciation is (Cost - Salvage Value) divided by useful life. 

So, the cost is $1,000,000. The scrap value is $100,000. Useful life is 10 years. Let me plug these numbers into the formula.

Depreciation per year = (1,000,000 - 100,000) / 10. Let's compute that: 900,000 divided by 10 is 90,000. So, $90,000 each year.

Wait, but wait. The question mentions "current accounts" and the "capital account." I think in accounting, the depreciation is recorded in the current year's income statement as an expense, which affects the current accounts. But how does it affect the capital account?

The capital account, as I remember, represents the owner's equity in the business. When a company buys an asset, it's recorded as a debit to the asset account and a credit to cash or another account. But for depreciation, each year the asset's book value decreases by the depreciation amount. So, the accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account.

Wait, but the capital account itself isn't directly affected by depreciation. The capital account might show the owner's investment, retained earnings, etc., but depreciation affects the asset side of the balance sheet and the expense on the income statement. Maybe the question is referring to how the depreciation affects the capital account, perhaps through the retained earnings via the expense.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the fact that the depreciation reduces the value of the asset in the balance sheet, which is part of the capital account structure. But I'm not entirely sure about that part. Anyway, the main part is finding the annual depreciation, which I think is $90,000.

Looking at the options, option H is $90,000. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. (1,000,000 - 100,000) = 900,000. Divided by 10 years is indeed 90,000 per year. Yep, that's correct.

The machine's depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. The annual depreciation is the difference between the initial cost and the scrap value, divided by the useful life. 

Depreciation per year = ($1,000,000 - $100,000) / 10 = $90,000.

This depreciation is expensed in the current accounts each year. In the capital account, the depreciation reduces the book value of the asset over time, but it does not directly affect the capital account itself.

The correct answer is H: $90,000 per year.
