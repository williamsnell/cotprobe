Okay, so I'm trying to solve this accounting problem about vacation pay liability and expense for Elan Co. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the company has two employees. Each gets two weeks of paid vacation each year, and the vacation rights accumulate. That means if they don't use them, they carry over, right? So the company has to account for that.

First, I'll break down each employee's situation.

Employee 1: Weekly salary is $600. Took a two-week vacation during the year. So he used up his two weeks. Since he took the vacation, the company would have paid him $600 * 2 = $1200 during the vacation. So for this employee, there's no remaining vacation balance at the end of the year because he used all his accrued time.

Employee 2: Weekly salary is $800. She didn't take any vacation this year. So her vacation time has accrued but hasn't been used yet. Since she earns two weeks each year, and didn't take any, she has two weeks left. So the company owes her $800 * 2 = $1600 as a liability at the end of the year. 

Now, the question is about the year-end financial statements. So we need to calculate both the liability and the expense for the year.

Wait, how does this work? So for each employee, the company recognizes the expense when the vacation is taken, but the liability is based on what's accrued but not yet paid.

Wait, no, I think the expense is recognized when the employee earns the vacation time. So as they work through the year, they earn their vacation pay each pay period, which increases the liability. Then when they take the vacation, the liability decreases, and the expense is recognized.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

When a company accrues vacation pay, they recognize the expense as the employees earn it, which is over the period they work. So for each week the employee works, they earn a portion of their vacation pay. The total for the year would be the two weeks, so each employee's vacation pay is expensed throughout the year as it's earned. But when they take the vacation, the cash is paid out, which would decrease the liability.

Wait, but in this case, the problem is about the end of the year. So for each employee, we need to see how much vacation was taken and how much is accrued (owed) at year-end.

So for the first employee: he took two weeks, so the company would have expensed his $1200 during the year, and paid it out when he took the vacation. So his accrued liability at year-end is zero because he used all his vacation.

The second employee didn't take any vacation. So she earned two weeks, which is $1600, but hasn't taken it yet. So the company's liability is $1600 at year-end.

So the total liability should be $1600.

As for the expense, the company should have expensed both employees' vacation pay as they earned it during the year. So each employee earns two weeks, so total expense would be ($600 *2) + ($800 *2) = 1200 + 1600 = $2800.

Wait, but wait a minute. When the first employee took his vacation, the company would have recognized the expense when he took it, right? Or was the expense recognized when he earned it throughout the year?

Hmm, I think the expense is recognized as the vacation is earned. So even if the employee takes the vacation later, the expense is spread over the periods in which the employee worked to earn it. But in this case, since the problem says each employee receives two weeks each year, perhaps the company's policy is that the vacation is earned each year, and the expense is recognized at the end of the year when the entitlement is determined.

Wait, maybe I should recall the accounting rules. Under accrual accounting, the expense is recognized when earned, regardless of payment. So as employees work, they earn their vacation pay, so each pay period, a portion is accrued as an expense and a liability. At the end of the year, any unused vacation is a liability.

So in this case, regardless of whether the vacation is taken, the company should have expensed the total vacation pay for both employees during the year. So each employee's vacation pay is two weeks, so $600*2=1200 and $800*2=1600. Total expense is 1200+1600=2800.

But the liability is only for the unused vacation. So the first employee used all his, so no liability. The second employee has all her vacation accrued, so liability of $1600.

So the liability is $1600, and the expense is $2800.

Looking at the options, let me see:

Looking at the options, each option has two numbers: Liability and Expense.

Option C: 1600 and 2800. So that's what I think.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me go through each step again.

Each employee earns two weeks of vacation a year, which accumulates. So for each, the company must accrue two weeks as a liability unless it's used.

For the first employee, he used two weeks. So the company would have paid him $1200, which would have been expensed when he took the vacation. But wait, no: the expense should be recognized as the vacation is earned, which is over the year as the employee works, not when they take the vacation. So in terms of the year's financials, the expense is for the full two weeks each, regardless of whether they took it or not.

So for the expense, both employees' full vacation pay is expensed, $2800 total.

The liability is only for the unused portion. So the first employee has none left, and the second has $1600 owed. So liability is $1600.

So the correct answer should be liability $1600 and expense $2800.

Looking at the options:

Option C says $1600 and $2800. So that's the one.

To determine the vacation liability and expense for Elan Co., we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Employee 1**:  
   - Weekly salary: $600  
   - Took a two-week vacation during the year.  
   - The company paid $600 * 2 = $1,200 for the vacation.  
   - Since the vacation was fully used, there is no remaining liability at year-end.  

2. **Employee 2**:  
   - Weekly salary: $800  
   - Took no vacation during the year.  
   - The company owes $800 * 2 = $1,600 for the accrued but unused vacation.  

3. **Expense Recognition**:  
   - Under accrual accounting, vacation expense is recognized as it is earned throughout the year, not when the vacation is taken.  
   - Both employees earned their full vacation entitlement for the year, so the total expense is:  
     $600 * 2 + $800 * 2 = $1,200 + $1,600 = $2,800.  

4. **Liability**:  
   - The liability represents the amount owed for unused vacation at year-end.  
   - Employee 1 has no unused vacation, and Employee 2 has $1,600 in unused vacation.  
   - Total liability: $1,600.  

Thus, the correct answer is **$1,600 for liability and $2,800 for expense**, which corresponds to **Option C**.
