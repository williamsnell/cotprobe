Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a ball being thrown upward, and I need to figure out the answers. Let me try to break it down step by step. I remember from my classes that when dealing with projectile motion under gravity (assuming no air resistance), the motion can be described using kinematic equations. 

The problem states that a ball is thrown upward with an initial speed of 80 ft/sec. There are three parts to the question: the maximum height it reaches, its speed after 3 seconds, and its height at that time. The options are A through J, each providing different values for these three aspects.

First, let's tackle the maximum height. I remember that when an object is thrown straight up, its velocity decreases due to gravity until it reaches the peak where the velocity is zero. The equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, and acceleration is:

v² = u² + 2as

Here, v is the final velocity (which is 0 at the top), u is the initial velocity (80 ft/s), a is the acceleration (which is -32 ft/s² because gravity is acting downward), and s is the displacement (the height we're looking for).

Plugging in the values:
0 = (80)^2 + 2*(-32)*s
0 = 6400 - 64s
64s = 6400
s = 6400 / 64
s = 100 feet.

Wait, so the maximum height is 100 ft. Looking at the options, let's see which ones have 100 ft as the first value. Option E starts with 100 ft, so that's a possibility. Option C also has 100 ft as the third value, but the maximum height is the first value, so E is looking good so far.

Next, I need to find the speed after 3 seconds. I think I should use another kinematic equation for velocity. The equation is:

v = u + at

Where v is the final velocity, u is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Gravity is pulling the ball downward, so a is -32 ft/s².

Plugging in the numbers:
v = 80 + (-32)*3
v = 80 - 96
v = -16 ft/s.

Negative velocity means the ball is moving downward at that time. So the speed is 16 ft/s downward, but since the question asks for speed, direction doesn't matter, so it's 16 ft/s. Wait no, the options include negative signs, so maybe the answer expects the direction. Hmm. The question says "speed at the end of 3.0 sec" which is scalar, so maybe just 16. But let me check the options again. Option E has -16 ft/sec, which matches the direction and magnitude. So that's correct.

Now, the third part is the height after 3 seconds. To find the height at a specific time, I can use the equation for displacement under constant acceleration:

s = ut + (1/2)at²

Here, u is initial velocity (80 ft/s), t is 3 seconds, a is -32 ft/s².

Plugging in:
s = 80*3 + 0.5*(-32)*(3)^2
s = 240 + (-16)*(9)
s = 240 - 144
s = 96 feet.

So after 3 seconds, the ball is at 96 feet. Now, looking at the options again. Option E says 100 ft as the first value (max height), -16 ft/s as speed, and 96 ft as the third value. So that matches perfectly.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations. Another way to approach the height after 3 seconds is to see if the ball has already started descending. Since the time to reach max height is when velocity becomes zero. Let me find that time.

Using v = u + at, where v=0:
0 = 80 -32t
32t =80
t = 80/32 = 2.5 seconds.

So the ball reaches max height at 2.5 seconds. At 3 seconds, it's already on its way down for 0.5 seconds. So the height at 3 seconds should be less than 100 ft, which matches our earlier result of 96 ft.

So putting it all together: max height is 100 ft, speed at 3 sec is -16 ft/s (so 16 ft/s downward), and height at 3 sec is 96 ft. Looking back at the options, that's exactly what option E says: 100 ft, -16 ft/s, 96 ft.

I think that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the ball using kinematic equations under constant acceleration due to gravity (-32 ft/s²). The ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 80 ft/s, and we are tasked with finding three quantities:

1. **Maximum Height**:  
   At the maximum height, the velocity becomes zero. Using the equation:  
   \[
   v^2 = u^2 + 2as
   \]  
   where \(v = 0\), \(u = 80 \, \text{ft/s}\), \(a = -32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\), and \(s\) is the height:  
   \[
   0 = (80)^2 + 2(-32)s \implies 0 = 6400 - 64s \implies s = \frac{6400}{64} = 100 \, \text{ft}.
   \]  
   Thus, the maximum height is **100 ft**.

2. **Speed at the end of 3.0 seconds**:  
   Using the equation:  
   \[
   v = u + at
   \]  
   where \(u = 80 \, \text{ft/s}\), \(a = -32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\), and \(t = 3 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   v = 80 + (-32)(3) = 80 - 96 = -16 \, \text{ft/s}.
   \]  
   The negative sign indicates the ball is moving downward. Thus, the speed is **16 ft/s** (magnitude) or **-16 ft/s** (with direction).

3. **Height at the end of 3.0 seconds**:  
   Using the equation:  
   \[
   s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
   \]  
   where \(u = 80 \, \text{ft/s}\), \(t = 3 \, \text{s}\), and \(a = -32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\):  
   \[
   s = (80)(3) + \frac{1}{2}(-32)(3)^2 = 240 - 144 = 96 \, \text{ft}.
   \]  
   Thus, the height at \(t = 3 \, \text{s}\) is **96 ft**.

From the given options, the values **100 ft, -16 ft/s, 96 ft** match perfectly with option **E**.
