Okay, so I have this geology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about what happens when a continental lithospheric plate collides with an oceanic one. The options are A through H.

Hmm, I remember that lithospheric plates can be either continental or oceanic. Continental is thicker and less dense, while oceanic is thinner and denser. So when they collide, I think the denser plate would sink under the less dense one. Oh wait, that's subduction, right? So the oceanic plate would go underneath the continental.

When this subduction happens, what forms? I think it creates a chain of volcanoes. Because as the oceanic plate sinks, it encounters increasing heat and pressure, causing the rocks to melt and form magma. This magma rises through the overlying continental plate, creating volcanoes. But where exactly?

Wait, the question says it's a collision between continental and oceanic plates. So the oceanic plate is being pushed under the continental, which is called subduction. The volcanoes would form on the continental side, right? So maybe a chain of mountains with volcanoes on the coast.

Looking at the options, option B says a chain of coastal volcanic mountains. That makes sense because the subduction happens near the coast, so the volcanoes would form along the edge of the continent. For example, the Andes mountain range is a result of the Nazca oceanic plate subducting under the South American continental plate.

Another option is H, an island arc. Oh wait, island arcs form when two oceanic plates collide. Like in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where one oceanic plate is subducted beneath another, creating islands like Japan. So that's different because in this question, it's continental and oceanic plates.

So the correct result of a continental-oceanic collision should be a chain of volcanic mountains on the continent's coast. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. What about mid-ocean ridges? Those are where plates are moving apart, like seafloor spreading. So that's when new oceanic crust is formed. So option A is not right here.

Rift valleys are when a plate is being pulled apart, leading to possible new plate boundaries, but that's more about continental rifting, like the East African Rift. So option C is out.

Continental drift is the movement of the continents over time, but that's a broader concept, not a direct result of a plate collision. So D is not it.

Magnetic reversals are changes in Earth's magnetic field, which aren't directly caused by plate collisions. E is unrelated.

Transform faults are where plates slide past each other, like the San Andreas Fault. So F is not the result here.

A hotspot is a place where magma rises from deep in the mantle, creating volcanoes like Hawaii. But that's more about intraplate volcanism, not a collision. So G isn't the answer.

So putting it all together, the collision leads to subduction of the oceanic plate and formation of coastal volcanic mountains. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

When a continental lithospheric plate collides with an oceanic lithospheric plate, the denser oceanic plate is forced beneath the less dense continental plate, a process known as subduction. As the oceanic plate sinks, it encounters increasing heat and pressure, causing the rocks to melt and form magma. This magma rises through the overlying continental plate, creating a chain of volcanic mountains. These volcanoes typically form along the coast of the continent, resulting in a chain of coastal volcanic mountains.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: A mid-oceanic ridge** - This forms where plates are moving apart, not colliding. Incorrect.  
- **B: A chain of coastal volcanic mountains** - This is the correct result of subduction between continental and oceanic plates. Correct.  
- **C: A rift valley** - Forms during continental rifting, not plate collision. Incorrect.  
- **D: A continental drift** - Refers to the movement of continents over time, not a direct result of collision. Incorrect.  
- **E: A magnetic reversal** - Unrelated to plate collisions. Incorrect.  
- **F: A transform fault** - Forms where plates slide past each other, not during subduction. Incorrect.  
- **G: A hotspot** - Related to intraplate volcanism, not collision. Incorrect.  
- **H: An island arc** - Forms when two oceanic plates collide, not continental and oceanic. Incorrect.  

The correct answer is **B: A chain of coastal volcanic mountains**.  

Answer: B
