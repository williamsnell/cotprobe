Okay, so I have this question here about eye colors in a group of people. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question says there are 10 people, each with one of three different eye colors. And I need to find out the minimum number of people that must have the same eye color. 

Wait, I think this is a pigeonhole principle problem. The pigeonhole principle is when you distribute items among containers and figure out the minimum number in at least one container. So in this case, the people are the items, and the eye colors are the containers.

Right, so if there are 3 eye colors, that's like 3 containers. And there are 10 people to distribute among them. The question is asking for the least number that must be in at least one container. So, what's the minimum maximum here.

Let me think. If I try to spread the people as evenly as possible among the three eye colors, that would give the smallest possible maximum. So, 10 divided by 3 is approximately 3.333. But since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to 3. But wait, 3 times 3 is 9, and there's one person left over. So that extra person has to go into one of the eye colors, making it 4.

So that means at least one eye color must have 4 people. Let me check the options. The options are A to J. Option A is 4, which matches what I got.

Wait, but wait another minute. Let me make sure. So, the worst-case scenario is when the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible. So, two eye colors have 3 people each, and the last one has 4. Because 3 + 3 +4 is 10. So yes, the minimum number that must be present is 4.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be A:4.

The problem involves determining the minimum number of people that must share the same eye color in a group of 10 people with 3 different eye colors. Using the pigeonhole principle, we distribute the 10 people as evenly as possible among the 3 eye colors. Dividing 10 by 3 gives approximately 3.333, which we round down to 3. However, since 3 Ã— 3 = 9, there is 1 person left, who must be added to one of the eye colors, resulting in 4 people with the same eye color. Thus, the minimum number of people that must share the same eye color is 4.

Answer: A
