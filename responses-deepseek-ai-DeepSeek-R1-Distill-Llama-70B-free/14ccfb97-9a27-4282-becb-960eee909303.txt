Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a parallel plate capacitor. Let me think through it step by step. I remember that the formula for capacitance in a parallel plate capacitor is C equals epsilon zero times the area divided by the distance between the plates. Right, so C = ε₀ * A / d.

The problem gives me the area as 2 m² and the distance as 5 mm. Wait, I should convert that to meters because standard units are in meters. So 5 mm is 0.005 meters. Epsilon zero is a constant, approximately 8.85 times 10^-12 farads per meter.

Plugging in the numbers: C = (8.85e-12 F/m) * (2 m²) / (0.005 m). Let me compute that. 

So 2 divided by 0.005 is 400. Then 8.85e-12 * 400. Hmm, 8.85 * 400 is 3540, so 3540e-12 F, which is 3540 microfarads. Okay, so the capacitance is 3540 µF.

Next, part (b) asks for the charge on each plate. Oh right, Q equals C times V. The potential difference V is 10,000 volts, which is 1e4 V.

So Q = 3540e-6 F * 1e4 V. Let me calculate that. 3540e-6 * 1e4 is 3540 * (1e-6 * 1e4) = 3540 * 0.01, which is 35.4 coulombs. Wait, that can't be right because microfarads times volts would give me more... Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, 3540 µF is 3540e-6 F. So 3540e-6 F * 1e4 V = (3540 * 1e4) * 1e-6 F*V. Oh wait, that's 3540 * 10^4 * 1e-6. 10^4 is 1e4, so 1e4 * 1e-6 is 1e-2. So 3540 * 0.01 is 35.4 coulombs. Wait, but looking at the options, like option E has 3.54e5 coulombs, which is 354,000 C. That's way too big. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait no, wait. Oh wait, because 3540e-6 F is 0.00354 F, right? Because 1 microfarad is 1e-6. So 0.00354 F. Then Q = 0.00354 F * 1e4 V = 35.4 C. So around 35.4 coulombs. But looking at the options, none of the options have 35.4 C. Let me look again.

Wait the options: option E has 3.54e5 C, which is way too big. Wait maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 3540 µF is 3540e-6 F. So 3540e-6 F * 1e4 V = (3540 * 1e4) * 1e-6. So 3540 * 1e-2 is 35.4. Oh, right, so 35.4 C. But looking at the options, none of them have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area or distance.

Wait the area is 2 m², correct. Distance is 5 mm, so 0.005 m. So the calculation for capacitance seems right: 8.85e-12 * 2 / 0.005 = 3540e-12 F, which is 3540 nF? No, wait, 3540e-12 is 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nano farads? Wait that can't be right because 3540e-12 is 3.54e-9, which is 3.54 nF. Wait wait wait, no, wait: 8.85e-12 * (2/0.005) = 8.85e-12 * 400 = 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nano farads? That's 3,540 microfarads? Wait no, 1e-6 is micro, 1e-9 is nano. Oh wait, no. 3.54e-9 F is 3540e-9 F, which is 3540 nF, which is 3.54 microfarads. Wait no, because 1 microfarad is 1e-6, 1 nano is 1e-9. So 3.54e-9 is 3.54 nF, which is 0.00354 microfarads. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait wait, let me compute 8.85e-12 * (2 / 0.005). So 2 / 0.005 is 400. 8.85e-12 *400 = 8.85 *400 = 3540. So 3540e-12 F. 1e-12 is pico, but 3540e-12 is 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nano farads. That's 3,540 pico farads. But in the options, the capacitance is in microfarads. So 3.54e-9 F is 3540e-12 F, which is 3.54e-6 F is 3540 microfarads? Wait no, 1 microfarad is 1e-6 F. So if I have 3.54e-6 F, that's 3.54 microfarads. Wait, but 3.54e-6 is 0.00000354 F. Wait, wait, I'm getting messed up here.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in unit conversion. Let me try again. C = ε₀ * A / d.

ε₀ is 8.85e-12 F/m. A is 2 m², d is 0.005 m.

So C = 8.85e-12 * (2 / 0.005) F. So compute 2/0.005 = 400. 8.85e-12 *400 = 3540e-12 F. 1e-12 is pico, so 3540 pF is 3.54e-9 F. Wait, but 1 microfarad is 1e-6 F. So to convert 3.54e-9 F to microfarads, I divide by 1e-6. So 3.54e-9 / 1e-6 = 3.54e-3 microfarads, which is 0.00354 microfarads. That's 3.54 milliFaradays? No, wait, milli is 1e-3. Wait, I'm getting really confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically. 8.85e-12 * 400 = 3540e-12 F. 3540e-12 is 3.54e-9 F. 1 microfarad is 1e-6 F, so how many microfarads is 3.54e-9 F? Divide by 1e-6: 3.54e-9 / 1e-6 = 3.54e-3 microfarads, which is 0.00354 microfarads. That's 3.54 mF (milliFarads)? No, wait, milli is 1e-3, so 3.54e-3 microfarads is 3.54 nanoFarads. Hmm, I think I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me compute 8.85e-12 * (2 / 0.005) = 8.85e-12 * 400 = 8.85 * 400 = 3540, so 3540e-12 F, which is 3540 pF. Oh wait, because 1e-12 is pico. So 3540 pF is 3.54 nanoFarads. Wait, 1 nano is 1e-9, 1 pico is 1e-12. So 3540 pF is 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nF. That's 3,540 pF.

But none of the options have 3.54 nF as capacitance. Wait the options are A: 3540 uF, which is 3.54e6 uF? No, wait, 1 uF is 1e-6. So 3540 uF is 3.54e3 * 1e-6 = 3.54e-3 F. Wait, no, 3540 uF is 3.54e3 * 1e-6 F, which is 3.54e-3 F, which is 0.00354 F. That can't be right because our calculation for C is 3.54e-9 F, which is way smaller. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait wait, maybe I messed up the formula. The formula for parallel plate capacitance is C = ε₀ * (A/d), right? Let me double-check the numbers. A is 2 m², d is 0.005 m. So A/d is 400 m^{-1}. Multiply by ε₀ (8.85e-12 F/m) gives 8.85e-12 * 400 = 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nF. So 3.54 nF is 3540 pF. But in the options, the capacitance options are in microfarads, and the options have much larger values, like 2500 uF, 4000 uF, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area. The area is 2 m²? That's really large. Like a square meter is 1m x 1m, so 2 m² would be 2 square meters. That seems big for a capacitor plate, but perhaps it's correct in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the exponent in 8.85e-12.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the capacitance. Let's compute C again. C = (8.85e-12 F/m) * (2 m²) / (0.005 m). So 2 m² divided by 0.005 m is (2/0.005) m, which is 400 m. So 8.85e-12 F/m multiplied by 400 m gives 8.85e-12 * 400 = 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nF, as before. So this is correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me look at the options again. Option E: capacitance 3540 µF, charge 3.54e5 C, intensity 1e5 V/m. But our capacitance is 3.54e-9 F, which is way smaller than 3540 µF. So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait wait, another thought. Oh wait, maybe I forgot that 1 µF is 1e-6 F. So 3540 µF is 3540e-6 F, which is 3.54e-3 F, which is way larger than our calculated 3.54e-9 F. So perhaps I made a mistake in the area or the distance.

Wait the problem says the area is 2 m², which is correct. The distance is 5 mm, which is 0.005 m. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C = (epsilon_0 * A) / d, which is what I used. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options? Or perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for epsilon zero. Let me check. Epsilon zero is approximately 8.85e-12 F/m. Yes, that's correct. So I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question's parameters?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a parallel plate capacitor but something else? No, the question says it's a parallel plate capacitor. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the area is 2 square meters, which is very large, leading to a large capacitance? Because 2 m² is a huge area for a capacitor. Let me think: for a standard parallel plate, C = epsilon0 * A/d. So with A=2 m² and d=5 mm, that's indeed 400 m^{-1}, 8.85e-12 * 400 is 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nF. So 3.54 nF is 0.00354 microfarads. So none of the options match, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula uses meters, and I should convert mm correctly. 5 mm is 0.005 m, correct. So no mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant 5 cm, not mm? Because 5 cm is 0.05 m, which would change the calculation. Let me try that. If d were 0.05 m, then A/d is 2 / 0.05 = 40 m^{-1}. 8.85e-12 *40 is 3.54e-10 F, which is 0.354 nF, which is even smaller. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing pico and micro? 3.54e-9 F is 3.54 nF, which is 3540 pF, 3.54 microFarads would be 3.54e-6 F, which is much larger. So 3.54e-6 F is 3.54e-6 F, which is 3540 microfarads? No, wait 1e-6 is micro, so 3.54e-6 is 3.54 microfarads. But our calculation gives 3.54e-9 F, which is 0.00354 microfarads, or 3.54 nano farads.

This is confusing because none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the area is 2 square centimeters instead of square meters? Because 2 m² is really big, and 2 cm² is much smaller. Let me try that. 2 cm² is 0.02 m² (since 1 m² = 10^4 cm²). So 0.02 m². Then, C = 8.85e-12 * (0.02 / 0.005) = 8.85e-12 *4 = 3.54e-11 F. Even smaller. So that can't be.

I think I'm stuck on the capacitance part. Let me try moving on to part (c), the electric intensity. Electric intensity E is given by E = V/d. So V is 10,000 volts, d is 0.005 m. So E = 1e4 V / 0.005 m. 1e4 / 0.005 is 2e6 V/m. So 2e6 V/m, which is 20 x 10^5 V/m. Wait, because 2e6 is 2 x 10^6, which is 20 x 10^5, right? Because 10^5 is 100,000, so 20 x 1e5 is 2e6.

Looking at the options, the electric intensity is 10e5, 15e5, etc. So 2e6 is 20e5, so 20 x 10^5 V/m. So in the options, which have electric intensity as 20e5? Let's look. Option D has 20e5, option H has 20e5, option F has 20e5, option I has 20e5. So possible.

Now, looking back at the options, for (c), which is E, the correct value is 20e5 V/m. So any option with E of 20e5 is a possibility.

Now, let's think about the other parts. For (a), if the capacitance is 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nF, but none of the options have that. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Another formula for capacitance is C = (epsilon_r * epsilon_0 * A)/d. But the problem states it's in vacuum, so epsilon_r is 1, so that doesn't change anything.

Wait, let me try calculating the capacitance again. C = (8.85e-12 F/m) * (2 m²) / (0.005 m). Let's compute denominator first: 0.005 m. So 2 / 0.005 is 400. So 8.85e-12 * 400 = 3.54e-9 F, which is 3.54 nF. So that's correct.

But the options don't have 3.54 nF. The closest is option H and E, which have 3540 µF. Wait, 3.54e-9 F is 3.54 nF, which is 0.00354 µF. So none of the options match. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the area is 2 m² is correct, but the distance is 5 mm between the plates. Wait, 5 mm is 0.005 m, correct. So the calculation seems correct. So perhaps the problem intended the area to be 2 square meters, but the options are wrong? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the charge again. If C is 3.54e-9 F, and V is 1e4 V, then Q = C*V = 3.54e-9 * 1e4 = 3.54e-5 C, which is 35.4 microcoulombs. But the options have charges in the range of 1e5 to 4e5 coulombs, which is way larger. So I'm definitely doing something wrong
