Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is a homeowner who conveys his home and surrounding property for a consideration of one dollar. The deed is to his daughter for life, then to his aunt for life. But there's a condition: if the aunt moves to another state, then it goes to the sister for the life of the aunt. After that, it's a bit more complicated. If the aunt doesn't move, it goes to the heirs of the aunt. But if the aunt does move, it goes to the heirs of the sister.

The question is asking about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime. So, what's the aunt's interest called?

I remember that in property law, the different types of future interests can be a bit confusing. Let me try to break this down.

First, the conveyance is "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life..." So the daughter has a life estate. After her death, it goes to the aunt for her life. So the aunt has a vested remainder because she's ascertained and there's no condition attached upon her getting the interest. Wait, but there is a condition attached to what happens after her life estate.

Wait, no, the condition is on where she lives, not on whether she gets the interest. The daughter's life estate is first, then the aunt's life estate. So the aunt has a vested remainder in a life estate. But then there's this condition: if the aunt moves to another state, then after her life estate, it goes to the sister for the aunt's life. Wait, that's confusing. Let me parse this.

Wait, the original conveyance is: to daughter for life, then aunt for life. But if aunt moves to another state, then to sister for the life of the aunt. Hmm, that part is a bit tricky.

Wait, so after the daughter's life estate, it's supposed to go to the aunt for her life. But if the aunt moves out of state, then during the aunt's life, it goes to the sister for the aunt's life? Or does it shift after the aunt's life estate?

Wait, actually, the wording is: "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move to another state."

So, breaking it down, the initial plan is daughter (life) → aunt (life) → aunt's heirs. But if the aunt moves, then instead of going to aunt's heirs, it goes to sister (life) → sister's heirs.

Wait, no. Wait, the wording is "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move to another state."

I think the structure is: after the daughter's life, it's to the aunt for life. But if the aunt moves, then during her life, it goes to the sister for the aunt's life. Then, after the aunt's life, if she didn't move, it goes to her heirs. If she did move, then after the sister's life, it goes to the sister's heirs.

Wait, perhaps it's better to outline the possibilities.

1. Daughter dies. Then to aunt for life.

   a. If aunt doesn't move: After aunt dies, to aunt's heirs.

   b. If aunt moves: Then during aunt's life, it goes to sister for aunt's life. Then after sister dies (because it's for the life of the aunt), when the aunt dies, it goes to sister's heirs.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. So during the aunt's life, if she moves, the property shifts to the sister for the duration of the aunt's life. So the sister's interest is a life estate measured on the aunt's life.

But focusing on the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime. The daughter is still alive, so the aunt's interest is next in line after the daughter's life estate.

So the aunt has a vested remainder because her interest is not subject to a condition precedent; it's only subject to the daughter's life. But wait, the aunt's interest could be divested if she moves to another state. Because if she moves, then after her life, instead of her heirs taking, it goes to the sister's heirs.

Wait, no, more accurately, if the aunt moves, then during her life, the sister steps in. So the aunt's life estate is subject to a condition subsequent. Because she has the life estate, but if she moves, it's taken away and given to the sister for the rest of the aunt's life.

Wait, but the sister's interest is a life estate pur autre vie (on the aunt's life). So the sister's interest is contingent on the aunt moving.

Alternatively, the aunt's life estate is subject to an executory interest in the sister. So when the aunt moves, the sister gets a life estate, and then after the aunt dies, her heirs take. Or wait, after the sister's life estate ends (since it's for the aunt's life), then the heirs take.

Wait, perhaps the aunt's interest is a life estate, but it's subject to being divested if she moves. So that would make it a life estate subject to an executory limitation. Because the executory interest cuts short her estate.

So the aunt's interest is vested (because she's ascertained and there's no condition precedent), but it's subject to divestment if she moves. So her remainder is vested, but subject to partial divestiture.

Wait, but when does the divestment happen? If she moves, then during her life, the sister gets the life estate. So the aunt's life estate is subject to being replaced by the sister's life estate if the condition occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the aunt's interest is a life estate subject to an executory interest, which would make it a life estate subject to executory limitation. So the executory interest is in the sister, allowing her to take a life estate if the aunt moves.

But wait, the sister's interest is a contingent remainder, contingent on the aunt moving. So during the daughter's lifetime, the aunt has a vested remainder in a life estate, but it's subject to being divested if she moves. So her interest is a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture, because if the condition happens, her life estate ends and is replaced by the sister's life estate.

Wait, but the sister's interest is a life estate for the aunt's life. So the sister's life estate would last until the aunt dies. So if the aunt moves, the sister gets the life estate, and upon the aunt's death, it goes to the sister's heirs. Wait, no, the conveyance says that "then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move... and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move." So after the sister's life estate (which is for the aunt's life), it goes to the sister's heirs.

So, let's map the interests:

- Daughter has a life estate.

- Aunt has a vested remainder in a life estate, but if she moves, then during her life, it's replaced by the sister's life estate. So the aunt's life estate is subject to a condition subsequent (the right of entry if she moves), which would allow the grantor (or the holder of the executory interest) to take it back and give it to the sister.

Wait, but the executory interest is in the sister, right? Because if the aunt moves, the sister's life estate cuts in. So the aunt's life estate is subject to an executory limitation, making it a life estate subject to executory limitation.

But then the question is about the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime. So her remainder is a vested remainder, but it's subject to being divested if she moves.

Looking at the options:

A: vested remainder subject to open. No, because it's not a class gift that remains open.

B: contingent remainder. No, because the aunt's interest is vested; it's not contingent on any condition except the daughter's death.

C: fee simple subject to executory limitation. No, because the aunt has a life estate, not a fee simple.

D: reversionary interest. No, because the aunt is a grantee, not the grantor.

E: life estate pur autre vie. No, the aunt's estate is for her own life.

F: shifting executory interest. Not sure; executory interests come into play when there's a condition that cuts short a prior estate.

G: fee simple determinable. No, not fee simple.

H: fee simple subject to condition subsequent. No, same as above.

I: vested remainder subject to partial divestiture. Hmm. So the aunt's remainder is vested, but if she moves, part of it is taken away. But in this case, moving would cause her entire life estate to be replaced by the sister's life estate. So it's a complete divestiture, not partial.

J: vested remainder subject to complete divestiture. This seems to fit. The aunt's vested remainder (life estate) can be completely taken away if she moves, and replaced with the sister's life estate.

Wait, but the sister's interest is a life estate as well. So the aunt's interest is divested when she moves, but then the sister's interest is only for the aunt's life. So the remainder after the sister's life estate is to the sister's heirs. So the executory interest here is shifting from the aunt's heirs to the sister's heirs, depending on whether the aunt moved.

But focusing on the aunt's interest, during the daughter's lifetime, the aunt holds a vested remainder in a life estate, but this is subject to being completely divested if she moves. So the correct description would be a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture, which is option J.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the aunt's life estate is subject to an executory limitation, which would make it a life estate subject to executory limitation. But the question is about the aunt's interest. So her remainder is vested, but subject to complete divestiture if she moves, making option J correct.

Wait, but another thought: when the aunt's interest is divested upon moving, the sister gets a life estate. So the aunt's life estate is subject to a condition subsequent, allowing the sister to take. So the aunt's interest is a life estate subject to an executory interest, which would make her remainder a vested remainder subject to complete divestiture.

Yes, I think option J is the correct answer.
</think>

The homeowner conveyed his property "to my daughter for life, then to my aunt for life, but if my aunt moves to another state, to my sister for the life of my aunt, then to the heirs of my aunt if my aunt does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my sister if my aunt does move to another state." The question asks for the best description of the aunt's interest during the daughter's lifetime.

1. **Initial Analysis**: The daughter has a life estate, and the aunt has a vested remainder in a life estate because she is ascertained, and there is no condition precedent to her interest. However, the aunt's life estate is subject to a condition subsequent: if she moves to another state, her life estate is divested, and the sister receives a life estate for the duration of the aunt's life. After the aunt's death, the property passes to the heirs of the aunt if she did not move, or to the heirs of the sister if she did move.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The aunt's interest is vested because it is not contingent on any condition precedent; it is only subject to the daughter's life estate.
   - However, the aunt's life estate is subject to being completely divested if she moves to another state, as the sister would then take a life estate for the aunt's life.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **A: Vested remainder subject to open**: Incorrect. The aunt's interest is not a class gift that remains open.
   - **B: Contingent remainder**: Incorrect. The aunt's interest is vested, not contingent.
   - **C: Fee simple subject to executory limitation**: Incorrect. The aunt has a life estate, not a fee simple.
   - **D: Reversionary interest**: Incorrect. The aunt is a grantee, not the grantor, so she does not hold a reversionary interest.
   - **E: Life estate pur autre vie**: Incorrect. The aunt's life estate is for her own life, not measured by someone else's life.
   - **F: Shifting executory interest**: Incorrect. While an executory interest is involved, this does not describe the aunt's interest.
   - **G: Fee simple determinable**: Incorrect. The aunt does not hold a fee simple interest.
   - **H: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent**: Incorrect. The aunt's interest is a life estate, not a fee simple.
   - **I: Vested remainder subject to partial divestiture**: Incorrect. The aunt's interest is not partially divested; it is completely divested if she moves.
   - **J: Vested remainder subject to complete divestiture**: Correct. The aunt's vested remainder in a life estate is subject to being completely divested if she moves to another state.

4. **Conclusion**: During the daughter's lifetime, the aunt's interest is best described as a **vested remainder subject to complete divestiture**.
