Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of OH- ions in a 1.0 molar solution of NH4OH. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Wait, NH4OH is ammonium hydroxide, right? I remember that it's a weak base. Oh right, because it doesn't completely dissociate in water. So the ionization constant given is 1.8 × 10^-5. I think that's the Kb value for NH4OH.

The question is asking for the concentration of OH- ions in a 1.0 M solution. So I need to set up the dissociation equation first. NH4OH dissociates into NH4+ and OH- ions. The reaction would be NH4OH ⇌ NH4+ + OH^-.

Since it's a weak base, I can use the Kb expression here. The formula for Kb is [NH4+][OH^-] / [NH4OH] = Kb. Let's denote the concentration of OH- as x. So at equilibrium, the concentration of NH4+ is x, OH- is x, and the remaining NH4OH is 1.0 - x. But wait, because Kb is small (1.8e-5), x is going to be much smaller than 1.0, so 1.0 - x is approximately 1.0. That should simplify the calculation.

So plugging into the expression: (x)(x) / (1.0) = 1.8e-5. That simplifies to x² = 1.8e-5. Taking the square root of both sides, x should be sqrt(1.8e-5). Let me calculate that.

Hmm, the square of 1.8e-5. I know that sqrt(2e-5) is about 4.47e-3, but wait, 1.8 is a bit less than 2. So maybe around 4.24e-3? Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.8e-5 is 0.000018. The square root of 0.000018 is... Let me think, 4.24 squared is approximately 18 (since 4^2=16 and 4.2^2=17.64, 4.24^2 is 17.97 which is close to 18). So sqrt(18e-6) is 4.24e-3. Wait, wait, 1.8e-5 is 18e-6, so the square root is sqrt(18)*1e-3. Which is approximately 4.24e-3.

So x is about 4.24e-3 M. Looking at the options, let's see. Option E is 4.2e-3, which is close to my calculation. So I think that's the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is there any possibility that I made a mistake in assuming that 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0? Because if x were a significant portion of 1.0, that approximation wouldn't hold. Let me see, 4.24e-3 is about 0.00424, which is much less than 1.0, so the approximation is valid. So yeah, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, I could have used the exact quadratic equation without approximation. Let's see, the equation is x² = 1.8e-5 * (1.0 - x). Wait no, that's not the case. Wait, the Kb expression is (x)(x)/(1 - x) )= 1.8e-5. So the equation is x² = 1.8e-5 (1 - x). But since x is small, 1 - x ≈1, so x² ≈1.8e-5, which is what I did. So the approximation holds, and the answer should be 4.2e-3, which is option E.

To calculate the concentration of OH⁻ ions in a 1.0 M solution of NH₄OH, we start by recognizing that NH₄OH is a weak base with a given ionization constant \( K_b = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \). The dissociation of NH₄OH can be represented as:

\[
\text{NH₄OH} \leftrightharpoons \text{NH₄⁺} + \text{OH⁻}
\]

Let the concentration of OH⁻ ions at equilibrium be \( x \). Then, at equilibrium:
- \([\text{OH⁻}] = x\),
- \([\text{NH₄⁺}] = x\),
- \([\text{NH₄OH}] = 1.0 - x\).

The expression for \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{NH₄⁺}][\text{OH⁻}]}{[\text{NH₄OH}]} = \frac{x^2}{1.0 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is small, \( x \) will be much smaller than 1.0, so \( 1.0 - x \approx 1.0 \). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
x^2 = K_b = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
x = \sqrt{1.8 \times 10^{-5}}.
\]

The square root of \( 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \) is approximately \( 4.24 \times 10^{-3} \). Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is \( 4.2 \times 10^{-3} \), which corresponds to option **E**.

Thus, the concentration of OH⁻ ions in the solution is approximately \( 4.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \).
