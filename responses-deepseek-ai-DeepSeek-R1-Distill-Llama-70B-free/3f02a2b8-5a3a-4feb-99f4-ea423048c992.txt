Question:

A purchaser signed an agreement of sale to buy real estate. It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?

Options:

A: Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.
B: Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval  the first notice communicated is the effective one.
C: No, because the seller did not give the purchaser an opportunity to correct his mistake.
D: No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.
E: Yes, because the purchaser did not formally submit a mortgage application, violating the agreement.
F: No, because the approval of the belated application should allow the transaction to proceed.
G: Yes, because the purchaser did not fulfill the conditions of the contingency clause in the specified time.
H: No, because the amount of time that he was late was a "de minimus" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.
I: No, because the purchaser's discussion with a mortgage broker should be considered as an attempt to apply.
J: Yes, because the seller has the right to rescind the sale at any time.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real estate law, specifically dealing with contingency clauses in a purchase agreement. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a purchaser signed an agreement to buy real estate. The agreement had a contingency clause that required the purchaser to make a completed mortgage application within a specified time. It also mentioned that "time was of the essence." So, that phrase probably means that missing the deadline is a serious issue and could have significant consequences.

The purchaser didn't actually apply for the mortgage within the time specified. Instead, he asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion on whether he would qualify. Then, the seller told the purchaser she was rescinding the sale because he didn't apply on time. A few days later, the purchaser made a late application and got approved, but the seller still wants to rescind the contract.

The question is whether the seller will likely prevail in rescinding the transaction. The options are from A to J.

First, let me recall what a contingency clause does. A contingency clause in a real estate contract makes the contract dependent on certain conditions being met. If the conditions aren't met, the contract can be voided. Common contingencies include financing, home inspections, or sale of the buyer's current home.

In this case, the contingency is about the purchaser applying for a mortgage. The contract required a completed application within a certain time, and time was of the essence. So, the key points here are the deadline and the specific action required.

The purchaser didn't make the application on time. Instead, he consulted a mortgage broker friend for an opinion. The question is whether this action satisfies the contingency or not. The seller argues that since the application wasn't made in time, she can rescind.

I think the first thing to consider is whether the purchaser's action (asking the broker) counts as a completed application. The contingency requires a completed application, so perhaps just an opinion isn't enough. He didn't actually submit the application; he just informally asked someone about his chances.

So the contract's terms specify that he needs to make a completed application. If he didn't do that, he didn't fulfill the contingency. Since time was of the essence, missing the deadline would allow the seller to rescind.

Wait, but what about the fact that he later applied and was approved? Does that affect the outcome? Well, after the seller rescinded, the purchaser's belated application probably doesn't matter because the seller already acted on the failure to meet the contingency.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the purchaser didn't apply timely and lost the protection. This seems relevant because he didn't meet the contingency in time.

Option B: Yes, because she rescinded before he got approval. The timing of notices might matter, but I think the main issue is whether the contingency was satisfied.

Option E: Yes, because he didn't formally apply. This seems similar to A, focusing on the formality of the application.

Option G: Yes, because he didn't fulfill the contingency in time. Also a strong point.

Options C and H suggest that the seller should have given a chance to correct or that the delay was minor. But since time was of the essence, even a minor delay might not be acceptable.

Option D suggests that asking the broker was enough, but I don't think that's the case because the contract requires a completed application.

Option I suggests that discussing with the broker counts as an attempt, but again, the contract probably requires an actual application.

So the main issue is that the purchaser didn't make a completed application on time. Therefore, the contingency wasn't met, allowing the seller to rescind.

So the correct answer would be either A, E, or G. Let me think about the exact wording.

The contingency required a completed application within the time. He didn't do that; he just asked for an opinion. So the contingency wasn't fulfilled on time, which allows the seller to rescind. So both A and G make sense, but G specifically mentions not fulfilling the contingency conditions in the time, which is exactly the case here.

Wait, option E is about not formally submitting the application. So yes, that's also correct.

But looking back at the options, both A and G state the same reasoning but in different words. However, the correct answer might hinge on whether the application was made at all. Since he didn't make any application, just sought an opinion, the contingency wasn't satisfied. So the seller can rescind.

So among the options, G says "Yes, because the purchaser did not fulfill the conditions of the contingency clause in the specified time." That seems spot on.

Alternatively, A says "Yes, because he did not make a timely application and lost the protection." Also correct, but G is more precise about the contingency conditions.

Hmm, but the question is about whether the seller will prevail. So I think the correct answer is A, E, or G. Wait, which one is more accurate?

Wait, the contingency was to make a completed application. He didn't make any application, just asked a friend. So he didn't fulfill the contingency, so the seller can rescind because the condition wasn't met.

Therefore, the correct answer would be G: Yes, because the purchaser did not fulfill the conditions of the contingency clause in the specified time.

But wait, another angle: The contract said time was of the essence. So even if he was a day late, the seller can rescind. So the fact that he didn't apply on time is enough, regardless of later approval.

So the best options are A, E, or G.

Wait, looking again, option E says "Yes, because the purchaser did not formally submit a mortgage application, violating the agreement." That's also correct because the contingency required a completed application, which was not done.

So both E and G are about not fulfilling the contingency. Let me think about the exact terms.

The contingency requires a completed application within the time. So the failure is both in the form (not submitting) and in the timing. So G points out the failure in the time aspect, while E points out the failure to submit.

But the question is whether the seller can rescind because the contingency wasn't met. So both reasons are valid, but which is the better answer.

In this case, the contingency is about making the application in time. So the key is that he failed to do so. So G is correct because it's about fulfilling the contingency condition in the specified time.

Wait, but he didn't fulfill it at all, not just late. Because he didn't make any application. So perhaps E is more accurate because the application wasn't made, regardless of time.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the law. In contracts, when a contingency is not met, the contract can be rescinded. Here, the contingency was to make the application. The purchaser didn't make the application at all, so the contingency failed. The time being of the essence means that even if he had applied late, it might not be enough, but in this case, he didn't apply at all.

So the main issue is that he didn't make the application. So the seller can rescind because the contingency wasn't met.

So looking at the options, E says he didn't formally submit, which is correct. G says he didn't fulfill the contingency in time, which is also correct.

So which one is the better answer? Both seem correct, but perhaps G is more precise because it mentions the contingency's conditions in the specified time, which combines both the action and the timing.

Alternatively, the reasoning might be that because the application wasn't made, the contingency wasn't satisfied regardless of time, but since time was of the essence, any delay (even beyond the deadline) allows rescission.

Wait, the contingency requires making the application within the time. So the failure is both in not making the application and doing it on time. So the correct reasoning is that he didn't fulfill the contingency condition (making the application) within the specified time.

So G seems correct.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about another angle: The purchaser's action of asking the broker—does that count as an application?

No, because an application usually involves submitting formal documents, providing financial information, etc. Just asking for an opinion isn't the same as making an application. So the contingency wasn't met.

So the answer is either A, E, or G.

Wait, the question is about whether the seller will prevail in rescinding.

So the answer should be A, E, or G. Which one is correct?

I think the correct answer is A. Because he didn't make a timely application, so he lost the protection. The protection of the contingency is that if he can't get a mortgage, he can back out. But since he didn't even apply, he can't use that protection, and the seller can enforce the contract or rescind.

Wait, no, wait. The seller is the one rescinding. So if the purchaser doesn't meet the contingency, the seller can choose to rescind the contract. So the key is that the contingency wasn't satisfied, allowing the seller to rescind.

So in that case, G says the purchaser didn't fulfill the contingency conditions in the specified time, which is correct.

But another thought: The contingency is for the benefit of the purchaser. So if the purchaser fails to meet it, the seller can choose to terminate the contract. So yes, the seller can rescind because the contingency wasn't met.

So I think the correct answer is G.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A: Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection.

But the protection is for the purchaser. If he doesn't meet the contingency, he loses the protection, meaning the contract becomes enforceable against him. So if the seller wants to enforce, she can, but if she wants to rescind, can she? Or does the contract become firm, and the seller can't back out.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Contingency clauses are typically for the benefit of the party they're intended to protect. So a financing contingency protects the purchaser. If the purchaser doesn't meet the contingency, the seller can choose to either enforce the contract or rescind it, depending on the terms.

Wait, but in this case, the seller is the one rescinding because the purchaser didn't meet the contingency. So under the contract, if the contingency isn't met, the contract may be terminated by either party, or perhaps only by the party it's intended to protect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The contingency is for the purchaser's benefit. So if the purchaser doesn't meet it, the seller might have the option to cancel the contract. Alternatively, the contract might become binding without the contingency.

Wait, no. The way contingency clauses usually work is that if the condition isn't met, the contract is voidable, typically at the option of the party for whom the contingency was intended. So if it's a purchaser's financing contingency, and the purchaser fails to secure financing (or in this case, apply), then the seller can choose to terminate the contract.

So the seller can rescind because the contingency wasn't met. So the answer would be G.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: looking for cases where the application wasn't made, and the seller rescinds.

In such cases, courts often hold that the failure to meet the contingency allows the seller to rescind. So yes, the seller would prevail.

So among the options, G seems correct.

The question revolves around a real estate purchase agreement with a contingency clause requiring the purchaser to make a completed mortgage application within a specified time, with "time being of the essence." The purchaser failed to submit a formal application within the deadline, instead seeking an opinion from a mortgage broker friend. The seller rescinded the contract, citing the purchaser's failure to meet the contingency. The purchaser later submitted a belated application and was approved, but the seller insisted on rescission. The issue is whether the seller will prevail in rescinding the transaction.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Contingency Clause Requirements**: The contract required a *completed mortgage application* within a specified time. The purchaser did not submit a formal application by the deadline, only seeking an informal opinion from a broker. This does not satisfy the contingency clause.

2. **"Time is of the Essence"**: This phrase emphasizes that missing the deadline is a material breach, allowing the seller to rescind the contract. Even if the delay were minor, the seller can still terminate the agreement.

3. **Belated Application**: The purchaser's late application and subsequent approval do not negate the seller's right to rescind. The seller acted on the failure to meet the contingency within the specified time, and the belated application does not retroactively satisfy the condition.

4. **Seller's Right to Rescind**: The contingency clause exists for the purchaser's benefit. If the purchaser fails to meet the contingency, the seller can choose to rescind the contract. Here, the seller appropriately exercised this right.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: Correct in stating that the purchaser lost the protection of the contingency due to a late application, but it does not emphasize the failure to fulfill the contingency condition itself.
- **B**: Incorrect, as the timing of notices is not the central issue; the failure to meet the contingency is the key factor.
- **C**: Incorrect, as the seller is not obligated to give the purchaser an opportunity to correct the mistake when "time is of the essence."
- **D**: Incorrect, as seeking an opinion from a broker does not constitute a completed application.
- **E**: Correct in highlighting the failure to formally submit an application, but it does not address the time element explicitly.
- **F**: Incorrect, as the belated application does not retroactively satisfy the contingency.
- **G**: Correct and most precise, as it directly addresses the failure to fulfill the contingency condition within the specified time.
- **H**: Incorrect, as the "de minimis" doctrine does not apply when "time is of the essence."
- **I**: Incorrect, as discussing with a broker does not constitute a completed application.
- **J**: Incorrect, as the seller does not have an unrestricted right to rescind at any time; it must be based on the failure to meet the contingency.

### Conclusion:
The seller will likely prevail in rescinding the transaction because the purchaser failed to fulfill the contingency clause's requirement of submitting a completed mortgage application within the specified time. Among the options, **G** is the most accurate and precise answer.
