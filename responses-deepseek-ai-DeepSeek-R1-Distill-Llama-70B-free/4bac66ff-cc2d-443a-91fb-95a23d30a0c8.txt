Okay, so I've got this question about Anscombe criticizing Butler. I'm a bit new to philosophy, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that G.E.M. Anscombe was a prominent philosopher known for her work in ethics, particularly her critique of modern moral philosophy. She wrote an essay called "Modern Moral Philosophy," where she discussed the concept of conscience and moral obligations.

Joseph Butler, on the other hand, was an 18th-century bishop and philosopher. He's known for his sermons on ethics, where he argued against egoism and for the idea that conscience is a fundamental part of human nature. Butler believed that acting morally is in accordance with human nature and that our consciences should guide our actions.

Now, the question is asking what Anscombe's criticism of Butler is about. The options are from A to J. Let me try to recall what Anscombe said about Butler.

In her essay, Anscombe criticizes Butler's concept of conscience. She argues that Butler's view of conscience as a legislative faculty is problematic. She points out that this idea leads to a sort of moralism where individuals see themselves as legislating for themselves, which can be a form of self-righteousness or moral superiority. Anscombe thinks that this approach is flawed because it doesn't provide a coherent basis for moral obligations. She might be suggesting that the notion of each individual "legislating for oneself" is absurd or incoherent because it lacks an objective foundation.

Looking at the options, option C says "the notion of 'legislating for oneself' is absurd." That sounds like it aligns with what I remember. Anscombe's critique was about the idea that individuals can or should create their own moral laws, which she found to be a flawed concept.

Wait, let me double-check. Option H says "the idea of moral obligations is incoherent." That might also be related. But I think the specific criticism was more about the legislative aspect rather than moral obligations in general. So option C seems more precise.

Another option is F: "our consciences are fallible." While that's a possible critique, I don't recall that being Anscombe's main point against Butler. She was more critical of the structure of moral philosophy rather than the reliability of conscience itself.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C.

The correct answer is C. Anscombe criticizes Butler, arguing that the notion of "legislating for oneself" is absurd. This criticism focuses on the idea that individuals creating their own moral laws lacks an objective foundation, making it incoherent.

Answer: C
