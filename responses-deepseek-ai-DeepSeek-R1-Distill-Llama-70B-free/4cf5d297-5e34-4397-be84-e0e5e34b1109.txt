Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about legal processes, specifically regarding termination of parental custody rights and welfare benefits. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this relates to due process under the law. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what type of process both terminations require. The options are A through I. I think both scenarios involve government action that affects a person's rights, so due process applies here. 

Wait, I remember the case of Goldberg v. Kelly, which dealt with welfare benefits. In that case, the Supreme Court said that before a state can terminate welfare benefits, the recipient must receive prior notice and an opportunity to be heard, like an evidentiary hearing. So welfare benefits require prior notice and a hearing.

Now, for parental rights, termination is a more severe action. I think that requires more stringent procedural protections. I recall that in such cases, the process usually includes a court hearing with evidence presented. So prior notice and an evidentiary hearing would definitely be part of that.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing. That sounds right for both situations. Welfare needs prior notice and a hearing, and so does termination of custody. So both would require this process.

Wait, are there any cases where it's different? Like, maybe welfare can have an initial notice and a chance to respond without a full evidentiary hearing? No, I think Goldberg made it clear that an evidentiary hearing is necessary before termination. So Option C fits both.

Other options don't seem right. Option B is notice and opportunity to respond, but that might not include an evidentiary hearing. Option H is similar but doesn't specify a hearing. Option I is a post-termination hearing, which isn't what's required here because the question is about termination, so the hearing needs to happen before.

So the correct answer should be C: Prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing.

The question concerns the procedural requirements for terminating a parent's custody rights and welfare benefits. Both scenarios involve government action affecting individuals' rights, triggering due process protections under the law.

For welfare benefits, the Supreme Court case *Goldberg v. Kelly* established that recipients must receive prior notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing before benefits can be terminated. Similarly, the termination of parental rights is a severe action that necessitates stringent procedural protections, including prior notice and an evidentiary hearing.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: "Prior notice and prior evidentiary hearing" aligns with the requirements for both welfare benefits and parental rights termination. This ensures due process is followed in both cases.
- Other options, such as B, H, and I, either omit the evidentiary hearing or misplace the timing of the hearing, making them incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
