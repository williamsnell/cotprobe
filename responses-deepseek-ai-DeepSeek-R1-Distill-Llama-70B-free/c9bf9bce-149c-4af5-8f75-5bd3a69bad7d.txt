Okay, so I have this question about the first ship to sail around the world. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about what I know regarding maritime history.

I remember that Ferdinand Magellan led an expedition to circumnavigate the globe. Wait, but did he complete it? Oh right, he was killed in the Philippines, so he didn't finish the journey himself. But his expedition did continue without him. So the ship he was on... I think it was called the Victoria. That rings a bell. Victoria was one of the five ships in his fleet, and it was the only one that made it all the way back.

Wait, let me make sure. So the options are A to J. The choices include Victoria as option J. So the correct answer would be J. But wait, some people might confuse the expedition with the ship's name. Oh, but the question is about the name of the first ship, not the leader. So Victoria is correct.

Alternatively, I might think about other famous ships. HMS Beagle was Darwin's ship, but that's much later. Santa Maria was Columbus's, but he didn't go around the world. The Mayflower was the Pilgrims' ship to America. Titanic is the famous sinking ship. Endeavour was Captain Cook's. So none of those are right for this question.

So yeah, the first ship to sail around the world was the Victoria, led by Magellan's expedition. So the answer should be J.

The first ship to successfully sail around the world was the Victoria, part of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition. Although Magellan didn't complete the journey himself, the Victoria, under the command of Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano, finished the circumnavigation. 

Answer: J
