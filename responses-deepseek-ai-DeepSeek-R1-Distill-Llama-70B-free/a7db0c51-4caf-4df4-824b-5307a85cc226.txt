Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry has always been a bit tricky for me. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the volume of hydrogen gas produced when sulfuric acid reacts with metallic calcium. The reaction equation given is Ca + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + H2. They provide 120 grams of calcium, and we're to find the volume at STP. The options are from A to J, so I need to calculate and pick the right one.

First, I remember that at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. That's a key point because the volume will be directly tied to the number of moles of H2 produced.

So the steps I think I should follow are:

1. Write the balanced chemical equation.
2. Find the molar mass of calcium to determine how many moles are in 120 grams.
3. Use stoichiometry to find moles of H2 produced.
4. Convert moles of H2 to volume using 22.4 L/mol at STP.

Let me start with the balanced equation. The given equation is Ca + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + H2. Let me check if it's balanced. Calcium has a +2 charge, and sulfate is -2. So I think the equation is already balanced as written because each side has one Ca, one sulfate, and two H's in H2SO4, which produces one H2. So the equation is balanced with a 1:1 molar ratio between Ca and H2.

Next, find moles of Ca. The molar mass of Ca is about 40 g/mol. Oh wait, calcium has an atomic weight of approximately 40.08 g/mol, but for simplicity, I'll just use 40 g/mol.

So moles of Ca = mass / molar mass = 120 g / 40 g/mol = 3 mol.

Now, from the balanced equation, 1 mole of Ca produces 1 mole of H2. So 3 moles Ca should produce 3 moles H2.

Now, convert moles to volume at STP. Since 1 mole is 22.4 L, 3 moles would be 3 * 22.4 L = 67.2 L.

Looking at the options, option E is 67.2 liters. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I miss any coefficients in the equation? The balanced equation is 1:1 for Ca to H2, so that's correct. Moles of Ca: 120/40 is indeed 3. Volume is 3 *22.4=67.2. Yep, that seems right. So I think I'm confident that E is the correct answer.

To determine the volume of hydrogen gas produced when 120 g of calcium reacts with sulfuric acid at STP, follow these steps:

1. **Balanced Chemical Equation**:  
   The reaction is already balanced as:  
   \[
   \text{Ca} + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{CaSO}_4 + \text{H}_2
   \]  
   From the equation, 1 mole of calcium produces 1 mole of hydrogen gas.

2. **Moles of Calcium**:  
   The molar mass of calcium is approximately \(40 \, \text{g/mol}\).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ca} = \frac{\text{Mass of Ca}}{\text{Molar Mass of Ca}} = \frac{120 \, \text{g}}{40 \, \text{g/mol}} = 3 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of Hydrogen Gas**:  
   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of calcium produces 1 mole of hydrogen gas.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2 = 3 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Volume of Hydrogen Gas at STP**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies \(22.4 \, \text{L}\).  
   \[
   \text{Volume of H}_2 = \text{Moles of H}_2 \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 3 \times 22.4 = 67.2 \, \text{L}.
   \]

Thus, the volume of hydrogen gas produced is **67.2 liters**, which corresponds to option **E**.
