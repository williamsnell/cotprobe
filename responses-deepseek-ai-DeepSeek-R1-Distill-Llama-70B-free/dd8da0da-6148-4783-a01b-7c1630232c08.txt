Question:

A man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company, seeking damages for injuries he had sustained in an accident while riding a bus owned by the company. The man demanded a jury trial. After the parties' attorneys examined the prospective jurors and exercised their challenges, six jurors and two alternate jurors were chosen. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused.
B: No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.
C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.
D: Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.
E: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.
F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.
G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.
H: No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the jury size.
I: No, because the remaining jurors were sufficient to reach a unanimous decision.
J: Yes, because the man was not given a fair trial due to the reduced jury size.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about jury size in a federal civil case. Let me start by breaking down the facts given.

A man sued a bus company in federal court under diversity jurisdiction, seeking damages for injuries from a bus accident. He asked for a jury trial. They selected six jurors and two alternates. During the trial, two jurors got sick and were replaced by alternates. Then a third juror got ill, and the court excused them. The lawyers agreed to let a five-person jury decide the case. The jury then came back with a verdict for the company. The man filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that five people aren't enough for a jury.

The question is whether the court should grant his motion. So I need to remember the rules about federal jury sizes in civil cases.

From what I recall, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) dictate the size of juries. Specifically, under Rule 48, a federal civil jury must have at least six members. But parties can stipulate to a smaller jury, and some courts might allow juries as small as five, but I'm not sure if that's standard.

Wait, no, I think the minimum is six. Because I remember that the Supreme Court has held that a six-person jury is constitutional, but you can't go below that in federal cases. So if the parties stipulate to a smaller number, like five, is that allowed?

Wait, but in this scenario, the parties stipulated to a five-person jury after the third juror was excused. So the question is whether that stipulation is valid. Because if the law requires at least six, then their agreement doesn't matter, right?

Looking at the options:

Option C says yes because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury. Option G says no because the parties stipulated to fewer than six. But if the federal rule requires a minimum of six, then even with a stipulation, the court can't go below that. So I think the answer would be that the court should grant the motion for a new trial because five isn't enough.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again. Federal civil juries can be six or twelve, but I think the default is six unless the parties agree otherwise. But even if they agree, can they go below six? I think the minimum is six, so going down to five isn't allowed even with stipulation.

So the correct answer would be C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option F says yes because the stipulation can't override federal requirements. That sounds correct too. So perhaps both C and F are pointing towards the same conclusion.

But the question is about whether the court should grant the motion. If the federal rule requires a minimum of six, then the five-person jury is invalid regardless of the stipulation. So the court should grant a new trial.

So the correct answer should be C or F. But let me think about the exact rules. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48(b) says that a jury must have at least six members unless the parties stipulate otherwise. So wait, does that mean that parties can agree to a smaller jury? Like, if they stipulate, can they have five?

Wait, no. I think the minimum is six, and parties can't go below that. Because the rule says that if the parties don't stipulate, the jury is six, but if they do, they can have more or maybe less? Or wait, perhaps the rule is that the court may seat a jury of up to twelve, but the minimum is six, and parties can't reduce it below six even by stipulation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the exact rule. Oh, wait, I can't actually look it up, but I have to rely on my memory.

I remember that in federal civil cases, the jury can be six or twelve. The default is six unless the parties demand a twelve-person jury. But I also think that once a jury is sworn, if jurors are excused, the parties can stipulate to continue with a smaller number, but only down to six. So if you start with six and have some excused, you can't go below six.

So in this case, they started with six, but then three were excused, leaving five. The parties stipulated to accept five, but that's below the minimum. So the verdict would be invalid.

Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a new trial because you can't have a jury of fewer than six in a federal civil case.

Looking back at the options, option C is correct. Option F also seems correct because it says the stipulation can't override federal requirements.

Wait, but wait. There's a nuance here. The initial jury was six, then two were replaced by alternates, so it's still six. Then a third juror gets sick, leaving five. So the question is, can the parties stipulate to a five-person jury at that point?

I think that once the jury is sworn, the parties can stipulate to fewer than six, but is that allowed? Or is six the hard minimum?

I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that the Supreme Court has held that a jury can be as small as six, but not smaller. So even with a stipulation, you can't have fewer than six. Therefore, the answer would be C: Yes, because there must be at least six.

Alternatively, option F says that the stipulation can't override federal requirements, which would also make it correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option G says no because the parties stipulated. So if the parties can stipulate to a smaller jury, then G would be correct. But I think they can't stipulate below six.

So the correct reasoning is that the federal rule requires a minimum of six, so even with stipulation, five is invalid. So options C and F are correct, but looking at the options, C and F are different. C says because there must be at least six, and F says because stipulation can't override.

Wait, but the initial jury size was six, as required. But what happens when during the trial, jurors are excused? So if you start with six, and one is excused, can you continue with five if the parties agree?

I think that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 47(c), if after the jury is sworn, fewer than six jurors remain, the parties may, with the court's approval, proceed with the available jurors. But wait, no, I think that's not correct. Because the minimum is six, you can't go below that.

Wait, let me think about this. If you have a six-person jury and during trial, one juror is excused, making it five, and the parties agree, can you proceed? I think some courts have allowed it, but I'm not sure if it's permissible under the federal rules.

Alternatively, the rule requires a minimum of six, so even if the parties agree, the court can't allow it. So the answer would be that the motion should be granted because five is below the minimum.

Looking at the options, option C says yes, because there must be at least six. So the answer is C.

Wait, but another angle: the initial selection was six plus two alternates. The alternates replaced the two who were sick, so the jury remained at six. Then a third juror was excused, leaving five. So the question is whether the parties can stipulate to a five-person jury at that point.

I think that once the jury is sworn (six), and during trial, if a juror is excused, the remaining five can continue if the parties agree. Because the Federal Rules allow for a jury to continue with fewer members if the parties consent. So in that case, the stipulation would be valid.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to clarify.

In federal civil cases, the jury must consist of at least six persons. (FRCP 48(b)). But I think that once the trial has begun, if some jurors are excused, the parties can agree to proceed with the remaining jurors, even if fewer than six. Or is that not allowed?

Wait no, I think that the minimum is six, and even if some jurors are excused during trial, you canâ€™t go below six. So if the jury started with six, and one is excused, making it five, the parties can't stipulate to continue with five because it's below the minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps the rules allow the parties to stipulate to a jury smaller than six after the trial has started. I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I remember that in some cases, when a juror is unable to continue, the court can allow the remaining jurors to decide the case with the parties' consent. But that might be allowed even if it goes below six.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of a Supreme Court case. The case of Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149 (1973), dealt with jury size in federal civil trials. The Court held that a six-person jury is constitutional, but it didn't address the issue of going below six after the trial starts.

So perhaps the key is that the initial jury must be at least six, but if during trial, some are excused, and the parties agree, they can continue with fewer, but not below six. So if the initial jury was six, and during trial, one is excused, making it five, the parties can't agree to continue because it's below six. So the verdict would be invalid.

In this question, the initial jury was six, then three were excused, leaving five. So the parties stipulated to five, which is below the minimum. Therefore, the court should grant the motion for a new trial.

So the correct answer is C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F says yes because the stipulation can't override federal requirements. So if federal law requires at least six, then even with a stipulation, it's invalid. So F is also a correct reason.

But the question is about whether the court should grant the motion. So the reason would be that the minimum is six, so the answer is C.

Alternatively, option G says no because the parties stipulated. So if stipulation is allowed, then G would be correct. But I think stipulation can't go below the minimum.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it differently. The initial jury size is six, as per the rules. If during trial, a juror is excused, making it five, can the parties agree to continue? Or is five invalid regardless of stipulation.

I think that the federal rule allows for a jury to be six or more, but you can't go below six. So even with a stipulation, you can't have five. Therefore, the answer is C.

So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around whether a federal civil jury can return a verdict with fewer than six members, even if the parties stipulate to it. In federal civil cases, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) require a minimum of six jurors unless the parties agree to a larger jury. However, the minimum number of jurors is six, and this requirement cannot be overridden by stipulation. 

In this case, the jury initially consisted of six members. During the trial, three jurors became ill and were excused, leaving only five jurors. The parties stipulated to allow the five remaining jurors to deliberate and return a verdict. Nevertheless, federal law mandates that a civil jury must have at least six members, and this requirement cannot be waived, even by agreement between the parties. Therefore, the verdict returned by the five-person jury is invalid, and the court should grant the motion for a new trial.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.

This option accurately reflects the federal requirement for a minimum of six jurors in civil cases, which cannot be circumvented by stipulation.

Answer: C
