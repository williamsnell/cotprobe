Okay, so I've got this question about confidence intervals and sample size. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what happens to the confidence interval size when we triple the sample size. The options are from A to J. I remember that confidence intervals are related to the standard error and the sample size. Oh right, the formula for the confidence interval is something like sample mean plus or minus the margin of error. The margin of error is the critical value (like the z-score) multiplied by the standard error.

Standard error, I think, is the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. So SE = σ / sqrt(n). Oh wait, if the sample size increases, the standard error decreases. Because sqrt(n) is in the denominator. So if n triples, sqrt(n) becomes sqrt(3n) which is sqrt(3) times sqrt(n). So the standard error would be divided by sqrt(3). 

So the confidence interval is proportional to the standard error. That means if the standard error decreases by a factor of sqrt(3), the confidence interval width would also decrease by the same factor. Because confidence interval (CI) width is 2 * (critical value * SE). So tripling n makes SE go down by sqrt(3), so CI width goes down by sqrt(3) as well. 

Wait, so tripling the sample size would make the interval smaller. Let me double-check. Let's say the original sample size is n. New sample size is 3n. Original SE is σ/sqrt(n). New SE is σ/sqrt(3n) = σ/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(n)) = (1/sqrt(3)) * (σ/sqrt(n)). So yes, the new SE is 1/sqrt(3) times the original. So the CI would be 1/sqrt(3) of the original. 

What's 1/sqrt(3)? That's approximately 0.577. So the confidence interval would be multiplied by 0.577, meaning it's divided by sqrt(3), or equivalently, the interval size is divided by 1.732 (since sqrt(3) is about 1.732). Hmm, looking at the options, option E says it divides by 0.577, which is the same as multiplying by 1.732. Option H says it divides by 1.732. Wait, wait. Let me think.

If the original interval is W, and the new interval is W / sqrt(3), which is W * (1/1.732). So that's dividing by approximately 1.732. So the interval size narrows by that factor. So the correct option would be E or H. Let me recheck the options:

Option E: It divides the interval size by 0.577.
Option H: It divides the interval size by 1.732.

Wait, 1/sqrt(3) is approximately 0.577, so the new size is 0.577 times the original. So the interval is multiplied by 0.577, which is the same as dividing by 1.732. So the size is divided by 1.732. So option H says it divides by 1.732. Alternatively, option E says it's divided by 0.577, which would be incorrect because that would make the interval larger, not smaller.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the interval decreases, the factor is 0.577. So the new interval is 0.577 * old. So mathematically, new_interval = old_interval * (1/sqrt(3)) = old_interval / sqrt(3) ≈ old / 1.732. So the interval is being divided by 1.732. So the correct answer is H. 

Looking at the options again: 

E: Divides by 0.577 → new = old / 0.577 ≈ old * 1.732, which would increase the interval, which is wrong because increasing n should decrease the interval.

H: Divides by 1.732 → new = old / 1.732, which is correct. 

So the answer should be E or H? Wait, wait. No, the confidence interval is inversely proportional to sqrt(n). So when n triples, sqrt(n) triples, so 1/sqrt(n) becomes 1/(sqrt(3)*sqrt(n original)), which is 1/sqrt(3) times the original 1/sqrt(n). So the interval is multiplied by 1/sqrt(3), which is the same as dividing by sqrt(3) (~1.732). So yes, the interval is divided by 1.732. So option H says it divides by 1.732, which is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the options:

Option E: It divides the interval size by 0.577. That's the same as multiplying by 1.732. So that would make the interval larger, which isn't right.

Option H: It divides the interval size by 1.732. That's correct because the interval becomes smaller. So yes, the answer is E or H? Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, let's think numerically. Suppose original n is 100. Then new n is 300. The standard error is sigma/sqrt(100)=sigma/10. New SE is sigma/sqrt(300)=sigma/(about 17.32). So SE becomes (1/17.32) sigma, which is roughly 0.577 times sigma/10. So the SE is 0.577 times the original. Therefore, the confidence interval, which depends on SE, would also be 0.577 times the original. So the interval size is multiplied by 0.577, which is option E: divides by 0.577 is same as multiplying by 1.732. Wait, no, because option E says "divides the interval size by 0.577", which is the same as multiplying by 1.732. But the correct effect is that it's multiplied by 0.577, which is same as dividing by 1.732. So the correct option is H.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of math:

CI ∝ 1 / sqrt(n)

If n triples, new CI = (1 / sqrt(3n)) * (critical value * sigma) 

= (1/sqrt(3)) * (1/sqrt(n)) * (critical value * sigma)

= (1/sqrt(3)) * original CI 

So new CI = original CI / sqrt(3) = original CI / 1.732.

Which means the interval is divided by 1.732. So that's option H.

So the correct answer is E? No, wait. Because the question is about how tripling the sample size changes the interval size. So if the interval becomes smaller by a factor of sqrt(3), then the interval size is divided by sqrt(3), which is approximately 1.732. So the correct option is H.

Wait, let me read the options again:

Option E: It divides the interval size by 0.577. → So new size = old / 0.577 ≈ old * 1.732 → this would be incorrect, as the interval should get smaller.

Option H: It divides the interval size by 1.732. → new size = old / 1.732 → correct.

So the correct answer is H.

When the sample size is tripled, the confidence interval size decreases because the standard error (SE) is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. Specifically, the standard error is given by:

\[
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

where \( \sigma \) is the population standard deviation and \( n \) is the sample size. If the sample size is tripled (i.e., \( n \to 3n \)), the new standard error becomes:

\[
SE_{\text{new}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{3n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot SE_{\text{original}}
\]

This shows that the standard error decreases by a factor of \( \sqrt{3} \). Since the confidence interval width is proportional to the standard error, the confidence interval width also decreases by the same factor, \( \sqrt{3} \). Numerically, \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), so the confidence interval size is divided by 1.732.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E**: "It divides the interval size by 0.577" is incorrect because dividing by 0.577 is equivalent to multiplying by 1.732, which would increase the interval size, contrary to what happens when the sample size increases.
- **Option H**: "It divides the interval size by 1.732" is correct because the interval size decreases by a factor of \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: It divides the interval size by 1.732.**
