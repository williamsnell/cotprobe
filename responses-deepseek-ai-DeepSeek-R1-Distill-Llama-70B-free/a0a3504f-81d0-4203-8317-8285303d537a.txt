Question:

Jacob and Sons Plumbing bought a forklift for $10,000. The forklift is expected to last 5 years, and to have a residual value of $3,000. Jacob wishes to use the straight line depreciation method, while his sons wish to use the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. What will the difference in the depreciation allowances be for the third year?

Options:

A: $600
B: zero
C: $500
D: $150
E: $400
F: $200
G: $250
H: $300
I: $350
J: $100

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about depreciation methods. Hmm. Let me see. Jacob and Sons Plumbing bought a forklift for $10,000. It's expected to last 5 years with a residual value of $3,000. Jacob wants to use straight-line depreciation, and his sons prefer the sum-of-the-years'-digits method. The question is about the difference in depreciation allowances for the third year.

Alright, I need to calculate the depreciation for each method in the third year and then find the difference between them.

First, let's tackle the straight-line method. Straight-line is pretty straightforward. You take the cost minus the residual value, divide by the useful life. So here, the depreciable amount is $10,000 - $3,000 = $7,000. The useful life is 5 years, so each year's depreciation is 7,000 /5 = $1,400. So every year, including the third, it's $1,400.

Now, the sum-of-the-years'-digits (SYD) method is a bit trickier. I remember that SYD is an accelerated depreciation method where the depreciation is higher in the early years and lower in the later years. The formula for the depreciation each year is (remaining life / sum of the years) multiplied by the depreciable amount.

Wait, wait. The sum of the years' digits is the sum from 1 to n. For 5 years, that's 1+2+3+4+5=15. So each year's depreciation is (n - year +1)/15 multiplied by the depreciable amount. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the denominator is the sum, which is 15. The numerator for each year is the year's digit. Like, first year is 5/15, second 4/15, third 3/15, etc. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Because SYD starts with higher depreciation in the first years. So for the first year, the fraction is 5/15, second 4/15, third 3/15, fourth 2/15, fifth 1/15.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is (years left)/(sum of digits). Wait, the sum of the digits is 15 for 5 years. So for the first year, years left is 5, so 5/15. Second year, 4/15. Third:3/15=1/5. Fourth:2/15. Fifth:1/15. Right.

So the depreciation for each year is (year's digit/15) * (cost - residual). So in this case, 10,000-3,000=7,000. So:

Year 1: 5/15 *7000 = (5*7000)/15 = 35,000 /15 ≈ 2333.33.

Year 2:4/15 *7000 = 28000/15 ≈1866.67.

Year3:3/15 *7000 = 21000/15=1400.

So wait, in the third year, the SYD depreciation is $1400. The same as straight-line.

So the difference between the two methods in year three would be zero.

Wait, but that's what the options have. Let me check again. Straight-line is 1400 each year. SYD for year 3 is 1400. So the difference is 0.

Looking at the options, option B is zero. So the answer is B.

To determine the difference in depreciation allowances for the third year between the straight-line method and the sum-of-the-years'-digits (SYD) method, we calculate the depreciation for each method separately.

### Straight-Line Method:
- **Cost of the forklift**: $10,000  
- **Residual value**: $3,000  
- **Useful life**: 5 years  
- **Depreciable amount**: $10,000 - $3,000 = $7,000  
- **Annual depreciation**: $7,000 / 5 = $1,400  

Under the straight-line method, depreciation is the same every year, so in the third year, the depreciation allowance is **$1,400**.

### Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits (SYD) Method:
- **Depreciable amount**: $10,000 - $3,000 = $7,000  
- **Sum of the years' digits**: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15  

The depreciation for each year is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Depreciation} = \left(\frac{\text{Year's digit}}{\text{Sum of the years' digits}}\right) \times \text{Depreciable amount}
\]

- **Third year's digit**: 3  
- **Depreciation in the third year**:  
\[
\text{Depreciation} = \left(\frac{3}{15}\right) \times 7,000 = \frac{21,000}{15} = 1,400
\]

Under the SYD method, the depreciation allowance in the third year is also **$1,400**.

### Difference in Depreciation Allowances:
Since both methods result in a depreciation allowance of **$1,400** in the third year, the difference is:  
\[
\$1,400 - \$1,400 = 0
\]

Thus, the difference in depreciation allowances for the third year is **zero**.

**Answer: B**
