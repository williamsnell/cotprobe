Question:

A woman took her car to a mechanic to be serviced. After doing a thorough inspection of the car, the mechanic told the woman that her car needed extensive work and that he could do all that was needed for $1,000. The parties then entered into a written contract to have the car serviced for $1,000. As the woman remembers it, at the time the written contract was formed, the parties orally agreed that if the car required any additional servicing above that detailed in the contract, it would be included in the $1,000 fee. The mechanic, however, has no recollection of any such oral agreement. While servicing the car, the mechanic discovered that a belt was severel' worn and need to be replaced. The belt replacement was not listed as work to be performed in the written contract. The mechanic telephoned the woman and told her he had found the worn belt and felt he should replace it. The woman told him to do so. When the mechanic was finished, he presented the woman with a bill for $1,100, representing the $1,000 called for by the contract and $100 for the replacement of the worn belt, which is a reasonable amount. The woman refused to pay any more than$1,000. The mechanic sued the woman to collect the $100 for the replacement of the worn belt. If the court rules in favor of the mechanic, which of the following is the most likely cause for such a ruling?

Options:

A: The mechanic had a legal obligation to replace the worn belt in order to ensure the car's safety.
B: The parties entered into a collateral oral agreement for the replacement of the worn belt that was excludable from the integrated writing.
C: The written contract was not specific about what services were included in the $1,000 fee.
D: The mechanic performed an action beyond the agreed contract and hence has the right to additional compensation.
E: An implied-in-law contract was created at the moment the mechanic replaced the worn belt.
F: The woman verbally agreed to the extra work and therefore should cover the additional costs.
G: The oral agreement was not legally binding as it was not included in the written contract.
H: The writing was construed as a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
I: The writing was construed as a partial integration of the parties' agreement.
J: The mechanic could reasonably assume that the woman would want the worn belt replaced.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I need to figure out why the court would rule in favor of the mechanic, allowing him to collect the extra $100 for the belt replacement. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A woman takes her car to a mechanic. He inspects it and says it needs extensive work for $1,000. They sign a written contract for that amount. The woman claims they orally agreed that any additional servicing beyond what's in the contract would be included in the $1,000. The mechanic doesn't remember this oral agreement.

Then, while servicing, the mechanic finds a severely worn belt that needs replacement. He calls the woman, tells her about it, and she says to go ahead. He replaces it and then charges her $1,100. She refuses to pay more than $1,000. The mechanic sues for the $100.

The question is, if the court sides with the mechanic, why would that be? Let's look at the possible options.

I remember that when there's a written contract, the parol evidence rule usually applies. That rule says that prior or contemporaneous oral agreements can't contradict the written contract if it's a fully integrated agreement. But if it's only partially integrated, then some prior agreements might still be valid.

In this case, the written contract is for $1,000, but the woman claims there was an oral agreement to include any extra work. The mechanic doesn't recall that. So, if the written contract is the complete agreement (full integration), then the oral part about including extra work wouldn't count. But if it's partial, maybe it could.

But wait, the mechanic called and got the woman's permission to replace the belt. So she agreed verbally at that time. Is that a separate contract? Or does it fall under the existing contract?

I think this might be about the written contract's terms. If the written contract was specific about what was included, maybe the belt wasn't in there. But if the contract was more general, like a total fee for all necessary servicing, the oral agreement might matter.

But another angle is the concept of implied contracts or additional agreements. When the mechanic called and the woman agreed to the extra work, that could be seen as a new agreement. Or maybe it's an amendment to the original contract, which would require consideration or fall under the pre-existing duty rule.

Wait, pre-existing duty rule says you can't charge extra for doing what you're already contractually obligated to do. But here, the original contract didn't include the belt. So if the mechanic found more work, and the woman agreed to it, that could be a separate contract for that specific work.

Alternatively, the written contract might have been considered a complete integration, so any prior oral agreements are excluded. But since the woman agreed verbally when the mechanic called, maybe that's a new oral agreement that's enforceable.

Looking at the options:

Option B says there was a collateral oral agreement that was excludable. But collateral agreements are separate and don't contradict the written contract. But I'm not sure.

Option H says the writing was a complete integration. If the written contract is fully integrated, then prior oral agreements are excluded. So the oral agreement about including extra work wouldn't count. But when the mechanic called, they made a new oral agreement, which might be a separate matter.

Wait, but Option F says the woman verbally agreed to the extra work. So if she agreed when he called, that's a new agreement, not part of the original contract. So the mechanic can charge for that extra work because she authorized it.

But Option G says the oral agreement wasn't binding because it wasn't in the written contract. But that's about the original oral agreement, not the later one.

So the mechanic did extra work, got her permission, so she's liable for the extra cost. That's probably Option F.

Wait, but another thought: The written contract might have been for all necessary repairs, and the belt was necessary, so it's included. But the contract wasn't specific. If the written contract was specific about what's included, then the belt wasn't part of it, so the extra charge is valid. But if the contract was general, maybe it's included.

But the question says the written contract included specific work, and the belt wasn't listed. So the mechanic found more work, called, and she agreed. So that's a new contract for that specific repair.

I think the key here is that when the mechanic called and she agreed, that's a new oral contract. So she's bound by that, and thus has to pay the extra.

Looking at the options, F says she verbally agreed, so she should cover the cost. That makes sense. Alternatively, Option B is about a collateral agreement, but that's about the original agreement, not the later one.

Another angle: If the original contract was fully integrated, the prior oral agreement is excluded. But the later oral agreement is a separate contract. So the mechanic can charge for that.

So the court would rule in favor because the woman agreed to the extra work when he called, making it a binding oral agreement. So the answer is F.

But wait, another possibility is the concept of 'implied acceptance.' When the mechanic offered to do the extra work and she agreed, that's a separate contract. So yes, Option F.

Alternatively, Option J says the mechanic could assume she'd want it replaced. But that's more about implied contracts based on what a reasonable person would do, rather than an explicit agreement.

So I think the correct answer is F: The woman verbally agreed to the extra work and therefore should cover the additional costs.

The case revolves around a written contract for car servicing and an oral agreement regarding additional work. The woman claims there was an oral agreement to include any extra servicing in the $1,000 fee, but the mechanic disputes this. During the work, the mechanic discovered a worn belt, called the woman, and she verbally agreed to the replacement. The mechanic then charged $1,100, but the woman refused to pay the extra $100.

The court's ruling in favor of the mechanic would likely hinge on the fact that the woman verbally agreed to the additional work when the mechanic called. This verbal agreement constitutes a separate oral contract for the belt replacement, which is enforceable. The written contract did not explicitly include the belt replacement, and the subsequent oral agreement to perform the extra work creates a binding obligation for the woman to pay the additional cost.

Option F correctly captures this reasoning: the woman verbally agreed to the extra work, making her responsible for the additional costs.

Answer: F
