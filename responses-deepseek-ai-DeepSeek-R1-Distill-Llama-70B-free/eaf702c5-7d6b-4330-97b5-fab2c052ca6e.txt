Okay, so I have this accounting problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about consignment transactions and how they affect the balance sheet. Hmm, I remember that consignment involves one company shipping goods to another on consignment, meaning the receiver sells them and then pays the shipper.

Alright, so Stone Co. had some transactions in December Year 1. Let me break them down one by one.

First point: Inventory shipped on consignment to Omega Co. for $36,000. Freight paid by Stone is $1,800. So Stone sent goods worth $36k to Omega, and they paid $1.8k in freight. I think when you ship on consignment, the shipper (Stone) doesn't recognize revenue until the goods are sold. So for Stone, this would be an asset, probably in the form of consignment inventory or something like that. But wait, shipping costs—like freight—those are expenses for the shipper, right? Or maybe they get added to the cost of the inventory? Hmm, I'm a little fuzzy on that. Wait, no, when you're the consignor (shipper), the freight out is an expense because you're the one paying to send the goods. So Stone would have an expense for the $1,800, but the $36,000 is still part of their inventory, I think.

Second transaction: Inventory received on consignment from Gamma Co. for $24,000. Freight paid by Gamma is $1,000. So Gamma sent goods worth $24k to Stone, and Gamma paid the freight. So in this case, Stone is the consignee. As a consignee, they don't own the inventory until they sell it. So this inventory should be recorded as an asset (inventory) but with a corresponding liability, like consignment payable or something. Because until Stone sells the goods, they don't own them; Gamma still does. So in Stone's books, they would have an asset of $24k (the cost from Gamma) and a liability for the same amount. But wait, the freight was paid by Gamma, so Gamma bears that cost. So for Stone, receiving the consignment doesn't involve any freight expense on their part.

The question is asking about the consigned inventory on Stone's balance sheet as of December 31, Year 1. So we need to figure out what's included as inventory.

Let's think about each consignment transaction separately.

First, Stone shipped $36k to Omega. Since Stone is the consignor, the $36k is still considered inventory on Stone's books because the goods haven't been sold yet. But wait, I thought that when you consign goods, the consignor removes the inventory and replaces it with a receivable once it's sold. But in this case, no sales have happened by Dec 31. So the $36k is still on Stone's inventory, but as consigned inventory. So Stone's balance sheet should include this $36k as an asset.

Wait, but when you ship on consignment, the accounting depends on who is the consignor and consignee. The consignor (Stone) would have an account like "inventory out on consignment" or something, and the consignee (Omega) would have an account for "inventory received on consignment". But in Stone's case, they are the consignor, so their inventory is still on their books, but physically with Omega.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me recall. The consignor (shipper) retains the inventory on their books until it's sold. So Stone still holds the $36k as inventory, even though it's with Omega. So in their balance sheet, that $36k is part of their inventory assets.

Now, the second part: Stone received inventory from Gamma on consignment. Gamma sent $24k worth, and paid the freight. So Stone holds this inventory, but since they're the consignee, the ownership is still with Gamma. So for Stone, they would not record this as their own inventory. Instead, they might have an account like "inventory from consignor" or something, but it's not part of their own inventory assets. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

When a company receives consigned goods, the consignee (Stone) does not own the goods, so they don't record the inventory as an asset. Instead, the consignor (Gamma) still owns it. So in Stone's balance sheet, the $24k is not included as inventory. However, sometimes companies might have a separate account to track the consigned goods, but it's not part of their inventory. So, Stone's inventory would not include the $24k from Gamma.

So putting it all together, Stone's consigned inventory as of Dec 31 is just the $36k they shipped to Omega. Because that's the only inventory they own that's out on consignment. The $24k from Gamma is Gamma's inventory, so Stone doesn't own it and doesn't include it in their inventory.

Wait, but let me think about the shipping costs. Stone paid $1,800 freight to send goods to Omega. As the consignor, shipping costs are an expense. So Stone would have an expense of $1,800, but that doesn't affect the inventory value on the balance sheet. So the $36k remains as inventory.

So the total consigned inventory on Stone's balance sheet is $36,000.

Looking at the options, E is $36,000. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says no sales were made through Dec 31, so nothing has been sold. So all the consigned goods are still either with Omega or with Stone (from Gamma). But Stone doesn't own the Gamma goods, so only the $36k is their inventory. So yes, E is correct.

To determine the amount of consigned inventory that should be included in Stone Co.'s December 31, Year 1 balance sheet, we analyze the consignment transactions:

1. **Inventory shipped on consignment to Omega Co. ($36,000):**  
   Stone Co. is the consignor in this transaction. The consignor retains ownership of the inventory until it is sold. Since no sales were made through December 31, Year 1, the $36,000 remains on Stone's balance sheet as consigned inventory. The freight paid by Stone ($1,800) is an expense and does not affect the inventory value.

2. **Inventory received on consignment from Gamma Co. ($24,000):**  
   Stone Co. is the consignee in this transaction. As a consignee, Stone does not own the inventory until it is sold. Therefore, the $24,000 is not included in Stone's inventory on the balance sheet. Ownership remains with Gamma Co.

Since only the $36,000 shipped to Omega Co. is owned by Stone and remains unsold as of December 31, Year 1, the consigned inventory included in Stone's balance sheet is $36,000.

**Answer: E**
