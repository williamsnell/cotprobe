Okay, so I've got this problem here about estimating the radius of a mercury nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. 

The question gives me a formula: R equals 1.2 times 10^-13 cm multiplied by A raised to the power of one-third. So R = 1.2e-13 * A^(1/3). Right, I remember that A stands for the atomic weight, which is the number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus. 

Wait, what's the atomic weight of mercury? Oh, I think mercury's atomic number is 80. So A is 80. Yeah, I'm pretty sure about that. So I need to plug A = 80 into the formula.

So let's compute A^(1/3) first. The cube root of 80. Hmm, 4 cubed is 64, and 5 cubed is 125. So 80 is between 4^3 and 5^3. To get a better approximation, maybe I can do a rough calculation. Let me think, 4.3^3 is 4*4*4 is 64, plus some more. 4.3^3 = (4 + 0.3)^3. Using binomial expansion: 4^3 + 3*(4^2)*0.3 + 3*4*(0.3)^2 + (0.3)^3. So that's 64 + 3*(16)*(0.3) = 64 + 14.4 = 78.4. Then plus 3*(4)*(0.09) = 1.08, so 78.4 +1.08=79.48, plus 0.027 which is 79.507. That's very close to 80. So the cube root of 80 is approximately 4.3 plus a little bit more. Maybe 4.31 or something. 

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to approximate. Since 4^3=64 and 5^3=125, 80 is 16 above 64. The difference between 64 and 125 is 61. So 16/61 is roughly 0.262. So the cube root of 80 is about 4 + 0.262*(5-4) = 4.26. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, using logarithms might help, but that might be more complicated than necessary. Alternatively, knowing that 4.3^3 is about 79.5, as I calculated earlier, which is just under 80. So maybe A^(1/3) is approximately 4.3. But perhaps I can get a more precise value. Let's say 4.3 gives 79.5, so 80 is 0.5 more. Each 0.01 increase in the cube would add how much? The derivative of x^3 at x=4.3 is 3*(4.3)^2. Which is 3*(18.49) = 55.47. So a change of 1 in x would increase x^3 by about 55.47. So to get an increase of 0.5, the x would increase by 0.5/55.47 ≈ 0.009. So the cube root of 80 is about 4.309. Let's just approximate it as 4.31 for simplicity.

So R = 1.2e-13 cm * 4.31. Let me compute that. 1.2 multiplied by 4.31. Let's see: 1 times 4.31 is 4.31, 0.2 times 4.31 is 0.862. Adding them together: 4.31 + 0.862 = 5.172. So R is approximately 5.172e-13 cm. Wait, but wait a second, the options are multiples of 10^-13, so 5.172 would be 5.17 × 1e-13. So looking at the options, option C is 5e-13, which is 5 ×1e-13. Option B is 12e-13, but that's larger. Wait, but wait did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait no, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me redo it. A is 80, so A^(1/3) is about 4.3. So 1.2 * 4.3 = let's compute that. 1.2 *4 is 4.8, 1.2 *0.3 is 0.36. So 4.8 + 0.36 is 5.16. So 5.16e-13 cm. Hmm, looking at the options, the closest is option C: 5 ×1e-13, but wait there's also option E which is 9e-13, which is way higher. Or perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate 80^(1/3) more accurately. Let me think again. Let me compute 4.3^3: 4^3 is 64, 0.3^3 is 0.027. The cross terms: 3*(4^2)*0.3 = 3*16*0.3=14.4; 3*4*(0.3)^2= 3*4*0.09=1.08. So 64 +14.4=78.4 +1.08=79.48 +0.027=79.507. So 4.3^3=79.507. So 80 is 80-79.507=0.493 more. So we can approximate the next decimal. Let me think of 4.3 + delta, where delta is small. Let x=4.3, then (x + delta)^3 ≈ x^3 + 3x^2 delta. We have x^3=79.507, target is 80. So 79.507 + 3*(4.3)^2 * delta =80. So 3*(4.3)^2 = 3*(18.49)=55.47. So 55.47 * delta =0.493. So delta=0.493/55.47 ≈0.00889. So x + delta is approximately 4.3089. So A^(1/3)=~4.3089.

So then R=1.2e-13 *4.3089. Let me compute 1.2 *4.3089. 1.2 *4=4.8, 1.2 *0.3089=0.37068. So total is 4.8 + 0.37068=5.17068. So R≈5.17e-13 cm. So looking at the options, option C is 5 ×1e-13, option I is11, which is higher. Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation because 5.17 is close to 5, but let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A:10e-13
B:12e-13
C:5e-13
D:6e-13
E:9e-13
F:8e-13
G:4e-13
H:3e-13
I:11e-13
J:7e-13

Hmm, option C is 5e-13. So my calculation says approximately 5.17e-13, which is closest to option C (5e-13) or perhaps option J:7e-13? Wait no, 5.17 is closer to 5 than to 6. So 5e-13 is option C. But wait, let me see if I made a mistake with the exponents.

Wait, the formula is R=1.2 ×10^-13 cm * A^(1/3). So the 1.2 is already multiplied by 1e-13, so the whole thing is in cm. So when I multiply 1.2e-13 by 4.3, I get (1.2 *4.3) e-13 cm. So 5.16e-13 cm. So that's 5.16e-13 cm, which would be about 5.2e-13. So that would be closest to 5e-13, which is option C. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I used the correct A value. Oh wait, wait a second. Mercury's atomic weight is approximately 200. Wait, no, wait. No, no. Wait, the atomic weight A is the number of nucleons, which is protons plus neutrons. So for mercury, which has an atomic number (protons) of 80, the atomic weight is about 200? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The atomic number is the number of protons. For mercury, that's 80. The atomic weight is approximately the number of nucleons, which is protons plus neutrons. For a stable isotope, the number of neutrons is roughly equal to the number of protons, maybe a bit higher. So for mercury, let's say A is about 200? Or is it about 180?

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because mercury has several isotopes, but the most common one is mercury-202, I think. So the atomic weight is approximately 202. So maybe I should use A=202 instead of 80. Oh wait, that's a big mistake! Because I confused the atomic number with the atomic weight. Oh man, I should have realized that earlier.

So atomic number Z is 80. Atomic weight A is the mass number, which is protons plus neutrons. For mercury, the standard atomic weight is around 200.58 g/mol, which corresponds to an average of the isotopes. So the mass number A is approximately 200.6. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can approximate A as 200.

So now I have to recalculate with A=200.

So A=200. Now compute A^(1/3). So cube root of 200. Let me think, 5^3 is 125, 6^3 is 216. So 200 is between 5^3 and 6^3. Let's compute 5.8^3: 5 + 0.8. Let me compute 5.8^3. 5^3 is 125. 3*(5)^2*0.8 =3*25*0.8=60. 3*(5)*(0.8)^2= 15 * 0.64=9.6. (0.8)^3=0.512. So adding them up: 125 +60=185 +9.6=194.6 +0.512=195.112. So 5.8^3=195.112. That's less than 200. So let's try 5.85^3.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using linear approximation. Let me think, 5.8^3=195.112. 5.9^3: let me compute that. 5.9^3 = (6 - 0.1)^3 = 216 - 3*(6^2)(0.1) + 3*(6)(0.1)^2 - (0.1)^3. So that's 216 - 3*36*0.1 = 216 -10.8 =205.2. Then plus 3*6*0.01=0.18. So 205.2 + 0.18=205.38. Then minus 0.001, so 205.379. So 5.9^3 is approximately 205.379. So 200 is between 5.8^3 (195.112) and 5.9^3 (205.379). So to find x where x^3=200, between 5.8 and 5.9.

The difference between 195.112 and 205.379 is about 10.267. The value we need is 200, which is 4.888 above 195.112. So the fraction is 4.888 /10.267 ≈0.476. So x is approximately 5.8 + 0.476*(0.1) =5.8 +0.0476=5.8476. So x≈5.8476. So A^(1/3)=~5.8476.

Now, R=1.2e-13 *5.8476. Let's compute that. 1.2 *5.8476 = ?

1.2 *5 =6, 1.2*0.8476=1.01712. So total is 6 +1.01712=7.01712. So R≈7.0171e-13 cm.

Looking back at the options, option J is7e-13 cm. So the closest option would be J:7e-13 cm.

Wait, but wait, I thought I confused A=80 earlier. So why did the initial calculation give me 5.17e-13, but after correcting A to 200, it's 7e-13. So the correct answer must be option J.

But wait, let me make sure I have the right value of A. Because I'm a bit confused about whether A is the atomic number or the atomic weight. The formula says R=1.2e-13 * A^(1/3) cm, and A is the atomic weight. So yes, for mercury, A is about 200.

So with A=200, R≈7e-13 cm, which is option J.
</think>

To estimate the radius of the nucleus of mercury, we use the formula:

\[
R = 1.2 \times 10^{-13} \cdot A^{1/3} \, \text{cm}
\]

Here, \( A \) represents the atomic weight of mercury, which is approximately 200 (the average mass number of its isotopes). 

### Step 1: Compute \( A^{1/3} \)
The cube root of 200 lies between \( 5^3 = 125 \) and \( 6^3 = 216 \). To refine the calculation:
- \( 5.8^3 = 195.112 \)
- \( 5.9^3 = 205.379 \)

Since \( 200 \) is between \( 195.112 \) and \( 205.379 \), we approximate \( A^{1/3} \) using linear interpolation:
\[
A^{1/3} \approx 5.8 + \frac{200 - 195.112}{205.379 - 195.112} \cdot (5.9 - 5.8) \approx 5.8476
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( R \)
Substitute \( A^{1/3} \approx 5.8476 \) into the formula:
\[
R = 1.2 \times 10^{-13} \cdot 5.8476 \approx 7.0171 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 7.0171 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \) is **7 × 10⁻¹³ cm**, which corresponds to **option J**.
