Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about American realists and their arguments against formalism. Hmm, I need to figure out why realists thought formalism devalued the authority of judges to make law. Let me think about what I know on this topic.

First, I remember that formalism in law refers to the idea that law is a set of clear, consistent rules that judges can apply mechanically. So, judges don't really create law; they just apply existing rules. On the other hand, American legal realists were critical of this approach. They believed that law isn't just about applying rules but is influenced by various factors like social context, judges' personal views, and so on.

The question is asking why realists thought formalism devalued the judge's role in making law. So, I need to connect formalism's characteristics with the realists' critique.

Let me go through the options:

Option A: Judicial decisions are less important than legislation. That might not be directly related. Formalism could imply that judges just apply existing laws, which are made by legislatures, so maybe judicial decisions are secondary. But does this devalue their authority to make law? Because if they're just applying, they aren't making new law, so their authority in law-making is less. That could be a point.

Option B: The structure of legal reasoning is flawed. Realists might argue that formalism's reasoning is flawed because it's too rigid, but I'm not sure if that's the main point about devaluing authority.

Option C: Judges are not allowed to interpret the law, only apply it. Wait, formalism says judges apply the law, not make it. So if they can't interpret, then they can't create new law, which would mean their law-making authority is devalued. This seems relevant.

Option D: Formalism doesn't allow moral considerations. I think realists might have thought that law should consider more factors, including morality, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason they argued against formalism in terms of judicial authority.

Option E: Formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic reasoning. Syllogistic is like logical syllogisms, which formalism does use. Realists might say this is too simplistic and ignores the complexity of cases, thus making judges seem like they're just applying a formula rather than using their judgment. That could devalue their authority because it makes their role seem mechanical.

Option F: Formalism undervalues societal changes' influence on law. Realists probably argued that law should evolve with society, and formalism's rigid rules prevent that. This affects the judge's ability to adapt the law, thus devaluing their role in making law that fits societal needs.

Option G: Judges base decisions on formal logic. This is similar to E. Realists might think that relying solely on logic ignores other important factors, reducing the judge's role to just a logical exercise without considering the realities of the case.

Option H: Assumes all laws are written with perfect clarity. If laws are perfectly clear, then judges don't need to interpret much, so their discretion is limited. This would mean they can't make law as much, devaluing their authority.

Option I: Formalism makes law rigid and inflexible. This again ties into the idea that judges can't adapt the law, so their ability to make new law is restricted, which devalues their authority.

Option J: Judges don't have training in formal logic. I don't think this was a main point of the realists' critique. It's more about the approach than the judges' capabilities.

So, putting it together, the realists' main argument was that formalism portrays judges as mere appliers of law, not creators. So options C, E, F, H, I are all possibilities.

Wait, the question is specifically about the authority to make law. So formalism says judges don't make law, just apply it. So the realists would argue that formalism devalues judges' authority because it denies their role in making law.

Looking back at the options, option C says judges aren't allowed to interpret, only apply. That directly speaks to the inability to make law.

Option E says formalism treats reasoning as syllogistic, which would mean it's a mechanical process, so judges don't exercise discretion or make law.

But which one is the correct reasoning? Let me think. The formalist approach often posits that judges apply the law through logical reasoning, like syllogisms, without considering external factors. Realists argued that this ignores the reality that judges do make law, and their decisions are influenced by various factors beyond just logic.

So, the realists' argument is that formalism devalues judges' authority to make law because it assumes judges are just applying rules mechanically, not using their judgment or making new law.

So, looking at the options, option E says formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic. That would mean the process is mechanical, which undermines the role of judges in making law because they're seen as just applying a logical structure rather than exercising discretion or creating new legal principles.

Alternatively, option C says judges can't interpret. But I think formalism allows interpretation within the existing rules, but realists argue that interpretation is where the law-making happens. So if formalism restricts interpretation, then judges can't make law, thus devaluing their authority.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: Formalism is about the idea that law is a science, judges apply rules logically. So any gaps in the law are filled by logical reasoning, not by policy or social considerations. Realists argue that this is unrealistic because judges do make law, and their decisions are influenced by more than just logic.

So, by treating legal reasoning as syllogistic, formalism ignores the reality that judges have discretion and create law. Therefore, it devalues their authority because it pretends they're not making law, just applying it.

So the correct answer would be E: Formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic reasoning.

Wait, but another angle: realists argue that formalism's approach makes judges' decisions seem less important because they're just applying rules, not making them. So the authority comes from their role in shaping the law. If formalism says they don't shape it, their authority is devalued.

Alternatively, option I says formalism makes law rigid. But that's more about the law's flexibility, not directly about the judges' authority to make law.

So, I think E is the right answer because it's about the method of reasoning, which reduces the judge's role to applying a syllogism, thus denying their role in law-making.

American realists argued that formalism devalued the authority of judges to make law because it portrayed legal reasoning as a mechanical, syllogistic process. Formalism suggests that judges merely apply existing rules and precedents through logical deduction, rather than actively interpreting or creating law. This rigid, mechanical approach undermines the recognition of judges' discretion and their role in shaping the law, especially in response to societal changes or complexities that require more than just logical application. By treating legal reasoning as syllogistic, formalism reduces the judge's role to a passive applier of rules, ignoring the reality that judges often make law through their decisions. This critique directly ties to the realists' belief that formalism denies the dynamic and creative aspects of judicial decision-making, thereby devaluing the judge's authority to make law.
