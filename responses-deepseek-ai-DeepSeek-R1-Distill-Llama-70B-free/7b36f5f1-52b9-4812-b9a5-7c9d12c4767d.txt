Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the terminal velocity of zinc mineral particles settling in a slurry. Hmm, terminal velocity... I remember that's when the force of gravity pulling something down is balanced by the frictional force (or drag) pushing it up. So, the particle stops accelerating and just moves at a constant speed.

The problem gives me a few parameters. Let me list them out:

- Volumetric ratio of ore particles to water is 1:3. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need that for this specific calculation. Maybe it's just for context about the slurry's concentration.

- The volumetric ratio of zinc mineral to ore particles is 0.2. Oh, right, so for every part of zinc, there are 5 parts of ore? Or wait, the ratio is zinc to ore as 0.2, meaning 0.2:1, so 1:5. So if the total ore (zinc + other minerals) is considered, the zinc is 0.2 parts and the rest is 0.8 parts? Not sure if that affects the velocity though. Maybe it's more about the density.

The specific gravity (sp. gr.) of zinc mineral is 3.8, and ore particles is 2.6. Specific gravity is the density relative to water. So the density of zinc is 3.8 times water, and ore is 2.6 times. Water's density is about 62.4 lb/ft³, right? So zinc's density is 3.8 * 62.4 = let's calculate that. 3.8 * 60 is 228, 3.8 * 2.4 is 9.12, so 228+9.12=237.12 lb/ft³. Similarly, ore is 2.6 *62.4 = 162.24 lb/ft³.

The particles are 0.007 inches in diameter. Oh wait, I'll need to convert that to feet because the units for viscosity are in lb/ft-s. So 0.007 inches is 0.007/12 feet, since 1 foot is 12 inches. Let me calculate that: 0.007 / 12 = 0.0005833 ft. So diameter d is approximately 0.0005833 feet.

Viscosity mu is given as 8.1e-4 lb/ft-s.

I think I need to use Stokes' Law here. Stokes' Law is for the terminal velocity of a sphere in a viscous fluid, which assumes laminar flow. The formula is Vt = (d² * g * (ρ_p - ρ_f)) / (18 * mu). 

Wait, let me make sure. Stokes' Law applies when the flow is in the viscous or laminar regime, which is when the Reynolds number is less than 1. So I guess we can apply it here.

But wait, the particles are settling in the slurry, which is a mixture of water and ore particles. Does that affect the viscosity? Hmm, the problem gives the viscosity of water, but if the slurry is more concentrated, the effective viscosity would be higher. But the problem states to take the viscosity as mu = 8.1e-4 lb/ft-s, so I guess we can ignore any increase in viscosity from the slurry and just use water's value.

So the formula I'll use is Vt = (d² * g * (ρ_p - ρ_f)) / (18 * mu)

Where:
- d is the diameter in feet.
- g is acceleration due to gravity, which I should remember in ft/s². I think it's 32.2 ft/s².
- ρ_p is the particle density (zinc mineral), which I calculated as 237.12 lb/ft³.
- ρ_f is the fluid density. Wait, is the fluid just water or the slurry? The problem says the slurry is ore particles and water. But when considering the terminal velocity of a single particle, the surrounding fluid would be water, assuming the particles are sparse. Alternatively, if the slurry is very concentrated, maybe it's different. But the problem gives the viscosity of water, so perhaps the fluid here is water. So I'll take ρ_f as 62.4 lb/ft³.

Putting the numbers in:

Vt = (d² * g * (ρ_p - ρ_f)) / (18 * mu)

Let me plug in the numbers:

d = 0.0005833 ft
g = 32.2 ft/s²
ρ_p = 237.12 lb/ft³
ρ_f = 62.4 lb/ft³
mu = 8.1e-4 lb/ft-s

Wait, let me compute (ρ_p - ρ_f): 237.12 - 62.4 = 174.72 lb/ft³.

Now, d squared: (0.0005833)^2 = approx 3.4e-7 ft².

So numerator: d² * g * (ρ_p - ρ_f) = (3.4e-7) * 32.2 * 174.72

Let me compute each step:

3.4e-7 * 32.2 = approx 3.4e-7 * 3e1 = 1.0e-5 (wait, wait, 3.4e-7 * 32.2 = 3.4 * 32.2 = 109.48, then multiplied by 1e-7: 1.0948e-5)

Then multiply by 174.72:

1.0948e-5 * 174.72 ≈ Let's compute 1e-5 * 174.72 = 0.0017472. But it's 1.0948e-5, so 0.0017472 * 1.0948 ≈ approx 0.001913.

Denominator: 18 * mu = 18 * 8.1e-4 = 0.01458 lb/ft-s.

So Vt = numerator / denominator = 0.001913 / 0.01458 ≈ 0.131 ft/s.

Wait, that can't be right. The options are all much lower, like 0.02 to 0.07 ft/s. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the computation. Maybe I messed up the exponents or some unit.

Wait, let me compute d squared accurately. d is 0.007 inches, which is 0.007/12 = 0.000583333 ft. So d squared is (0.000583333)^2 = 3.4014e-7 ft².

Then, numerator: 3.4014e-7 ft² * 32.2 ft/s² * 174.72 lb/ft³.

Wait, let's compute each part:

3.4014e-7 * 32.2 = ?

3.4014e-7 * 32 = 1.088448e-5
3.4014e-7 * 0.2 = 6.8028e-8
Sum: 1.088448e-5 + 6.8028e-8 = approx 1.1688e-5.

Then multiply by 174.72:

1.1688e-5 * 174.72: Let's compute 1e-5 * 174.72 = 0.0017472.

So 1.1688 * 0.0017472 = approx 0.002039.

Wait, let me compute 1.1688 * 0.0017472:

0.0017472 * 1 = 0.0017472
0.0017472 * 0.1688: Let's compute 0.0017472 * 0.16 = 0.0002795, and 0.0017472 * 0.0088= approx 0.00001536. So total for 0.1688 is 0.0002948. So total is 0.0017472 + 0.0002948 = 0.002042.

So numerator is approx 0.002042 lb·ft/s².

Denominator: 18 * 8.1e-4 = 18 * 0.00081 = 0.01458 lb/ft·s.

So Vt = 0.002042 / 0.01458 ≈ 0.140 ft/s.

Wait, that's even higher. But the options don't go that high. The highest option is F:0.065 ft/s.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, Stokes' Law is Vt = (d² g (rho_p - rho_f)) / (18 mu). Oh wait, but that's in consistent units. Let me check the units.

Wait, in the Stokes' formula, the units should be consistent. Let me make sure I'm using the right units here. Since all the values are in lb and ft units, I should be okay.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should have considered the density difference as (rho_p - rho_water), which I did. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me compute each part more accurately.

Compute d squared:

d = 0.007 inches = 0.007/12 ft = 0.0005833333 ft.

d squared = (0.0005833333)^2 = (5.833333e-4)^2 = 3.402778e-7 ft².

Multiply by g=32.2 ft/s²:

3.402778e-7 *32.2 = let's compute 3.402778e-7 * 3.22e1.

3.402778 *3.22 = let's compute 3 *3.22=9.66, 0.402778 *3.22≈1.296, so total approx 10.956.

So 10.956e-7 + (wait, 3.402778e-7 *32.2 = 3.402778e-7 *3.22e1 = 3.402778 *3.22 *1e-6.

3.402778 *3.22 ≈ 10.956, so 10.956e-6.

So that's 1.0956e-5.

Multiply by (rho_p - rho_f) = 174.72 lb/ft³:

1.0956e-5 * 174.72 = Let's compute 1e-5 *174.72 = 0.0017472. So 1.0956e-5 is 1.0956 * 0.0017472.

1.0956 * 0.0017472 ≈ 0.001913.

So numerator is 0.001913 lb·ft/s².

Denominator: 18 * mu = 18 * 8.1e-4 = 0.01458 lb/ft-s.

So Vt = 0.001913 / 0.01458 = approx 0.131 ft/s.

Wait, but that's higher than any of the options. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the volumetric ratio affects the effective density. Hmm, the slurry's overall density is different. Or wait, no, because the terminal velocity is about a single particle settling in the fluid. So the fluid is water, so the density difference is between the particle and water.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem isn't using Stokes' law because the particles are not in the laminar flow regime. But usually, for small particles like 0.007 inches, Stokes' law applies because the Reynolds number is low.

Wait, let me check the Reynolds number. Re = (Vt * d * rho_f) / mu.

But since I'm trying to find Vt, perhaps I should compute Re after finding Vt, but in this case, it's a bit of a catch-22. Alternatively, I could calculate Re with the Vt I found and see if it's less than 1.

Re = Vt * d * rho_f / mu.

If Vt is 0.131 ft/s,

Re = (0.131) * (0.0005833) * (62.4) / (8.1e-4).

Let me compute numerator: 0.131 * 0.0005833 = 7.643e-5. Multiply by 62.4: 7.643e-5 *62.4 ≈ 0.00477.

Denominator: 8.1e-4.

So Re = 0.00477 / 0.00081 ≈ 5.89.

Hmm, that's higher than 1. So Stokes' law (which assumes Re < 1) isn't valid here. Oh wait, so I can't use Stokes' law in this case. That's my mistake.

So I need to use a different approach. Maybe the terminal velocity is in the transitional or turbulent regime. So perhaps I should use the Drag Force equation with the appropriate drag coefficient.

The general equation is:

Terminal velocity Vt is when the gravitational force equals the drag force plus buoyant force.

So, m * g = (1/2) * rho_f * Vt² * C_d * A + V * rho_f * g.

Wait, but for a particle, the forces are:

Net force = (density of particle - density of fluid) * volume * g = drag force.

So, (rho_p - rho_f) * Vp * g = (1/2) rho_f Vt² C_d A.

Wait, Vp is the volume of the particle. For a sphere, Vp = (pi/6) d³, and A is the cross-sectional area, (pi/4) d².

So substituting:

(rho_p - rho_f) * (pi/6 d³) * g = (1/2) rho_f Vt² (pi/4 d²) C_d.

Simplify this equation to solve for Vt.

Multiply both sides by 6/(pi d³):

(rho_p - rho_f) g = (1/2) rho_f Vt² (3/(2 d)) C_d.

So,

(rho_p - rho_f) g = (3/4) rho_f Vt² (C_d / d).

Then,

Vt² = [4 d g (rho_p - rho_f)] / [3 rho_f C_d].

So,

Vt = sqrt( [4 d g (rho_p - rho_f)] / [3 rho_f C_d] ).

But the problem is that I don't know the drag coefficient C_d, which depends on the Reynolds number. So perhaps I need to make an iterative approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the terminal velocity equation for different flow regimes.

Wait, another approach: Since Re is about 5.89, which is in the transitional region, perhaps between laminar and turbulent. Maybe I can use the Schiller-Naumann equation, which is an empirical correlation for C_d.

The Schiller-Naumann equation is:

C_d = 24/Re [1 + 0.15 Re^0.687] for Re < 1000.

So, but since I don't know Re yet, because Re depends on Vt, which I'm trying to find, this becomes an iterative process.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Assume a value for Vt.

2. Compute Re = (Vt * d * rho_f) / mu.

3. Compute C_d using Schiller-Naumann.

4. Plug C_d back into the Vt equation.

5. Iterate until Vt converges.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess a reasonable C_d value based on the Re I found earlier (around 5.89).

At Re ≈ 6, C_d is around 13.6 (from drag coefficient tables for spheres). So let's start with C_d = 13.6.

Now, compute Vt using:

Vt = sqrt( [4 d g (rho_p - rho_f)] / [3 rho_f C_d] )

Plugging in the numbers:

d = 0.0005833 ft

g = 32.2 ft/s²

rho_p = 237.12 lb/ft³

rho_f = 62.4 lb/ft³

C_d = 13.6

So,

Numerator inside the sqrt: 4 * d * g * (rho_p - rho_f) = 4 * 0.0005833 *32.2 * 174.72.

Compute 4 * 0.0005833 = 0.0023332.

0.0023332 * 32.2 = 0.075054.

0.075054 * 174.72 ≈ 13.113.

Denominator: 3 * rho_f * C_d = 3 * 62.4 *13.6.

3 * 62.4 = 187.2.

187.2 *13.6 = let's compute 187 *13 = 2431, 187 *0.6=112.2 → 2431+112.2=2543.2; 0.2*13.6=2.72 → 2543.2 +2.72=2545.92.

So denominator is 2545.92.

So the fraction becomes 13.113 / 2545.92 ≈ 0.00515.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.00515) ≈ 0.0718 ft/s.

So Vt ≈ 0.072 ft/s.

Now, compute the new Re with this Vt.

Re = (Vt * d * rho_f) / mu.

Vt = 0.072 ft/s.

d = 0.0005833 ft.

rho_f =62.4 lb/ft³.

mu =8.1e-4 lb/ft-s.

Compute numerator: 0.072 *0.0005833 *62.4.

0.072 *0.0005833 ≈ 0.000042.

0.000042 *62.4 ≈ 0.0026208.

Denominator: 8.1e-4 =0.00081.

So Re = 0.0026208 /0.00081 ≈3.24.

Hmm, that's lower than the initial guess. So now, at Re=3.24, what is the C_d?

Looking up C_d for Re=3.24, it's probably around 17-20? From the table, at Re=1, C_d≈200; Re=10, C_d≈20. So at Re=3, perhaps C_d≈25.

Wait, maybe I should compute C_d using the Schiller-Naumann equation. Let me try that.

C_d = 24/Re [1 + 0.15 Re^0.687]

At Re=3.24,

C_d = 24/3.24
