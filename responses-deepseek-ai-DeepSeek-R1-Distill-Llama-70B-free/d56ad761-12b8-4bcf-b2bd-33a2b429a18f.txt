Okay, so I've got this question about a nonprofit group using address labels as a free gift when asking for contributions. I'm trying to figure out which social psychological principle they're using. Hmm, let's think through this.

First, I remember that social psychology has several principles that influence behavior. The question is about a strategy to increase contributions, so it's likely about persuasion techniques.

I think about the different options. Let's go through them one by one. A is compliance strategy. Compliance strategies are techniques to get people to agree or comply with requests. There are several types like the foot-in-the-door, door-in-the-face, and reciprocity.

Wait, reciprocity rings a bell. Reciprocity is the idea that if someone gives you something, you feel obliged to give back. So if the nonprofit gives free address labels, people might feel they should contribute money in return. That makes sense.

Looking at the options again, A is compliance strategy. Compliance strategies include reciprocity. So the group is using a compliance strategy based on the reciprocity principle. So the correct answer would be A.

Other options don't fit as well. B, confirmation bias, is about favoring information that confirms your beliefs. That doesn't seem to apply here. C is social loafing, which is about people exerting less effort in groups. Not relevant. D, self-fulfilling prophecy, is when expectations influence outcomes. Doesn't fit. E is groupthink, about group decisions, which isn't the case here. F, stable attribution, refers to attributing behavior to stable causes, not related. G, cognitive dissonance, is about discomfort from conflicting ideas. Maybe, but the question is about a gift prompting a contribution, which is more about reciprocity than dissonance. H, halo effect, is about generalizing positive traits. Not quite. I, bystander effect, is about people not helping when others are around. Doesn't fit. J, fundamental attribution error, is about overestimating personality and underestimating situations. Not relevant here.

So the best fit is A: compliance strategy, specifically the reciprocity principle.

The nonprofit group is using a compliance strategy based on the principle of reciprocity. By including free address labels, they aim to create a sense of obligation in recipients, encouraging them to contribute in return. Among the options provided, **A: compliance strategy** is the correct answer as it aligns with the use of reciprocity to influence behavior.
