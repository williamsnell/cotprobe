Okay, so I have this problem here where a student made three weighings of an object. The weights are 9.17 grams, 9.15 grams, and 9.20 grams. The question is asking for the average weight in milligrams. Hmm, I need to find the average first and then convert it to milligrams.

Alright, first step is to calculate the average of the three measurements. To find the average, I add the three numbers together and then divide by three. Let me do that. 

So 9.17 plus 9.15 is... let's see, 9 plus 9 is 18, 0.17 plus 0.15 is 0.32. So that's 18.32. Then adding the third measurement: 18.32 plus 9.20. Wait, no, wait—actually, 18.32 is the sum of the first two, so adding 9.20 to that would give me 27.52 grams. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, 9.17 +9.15 is 18.32 grams, because each is around 9 grams. Oh wait, no, 9.17 +9.15 is 18.32 grams. Then add 9.20. 18.32 +9.20 = 27.52 grams. So the total is 27.52 grams.

Now, average is total divided by the number of measurements. There are three, so 27.52 divided by 3. Let me compute that. 27.52 /3. Well, 27 divided by 3 is 9, and 0.52 divided by 3. 0.52/3 is approximately 0.1733. So adding those together, the average is approximately 9.1733 grams.

Wait, let me check that calculation again because I might have messed up the division. Let's see, 3 goes into 27 nine times, that's correct. Then 3 into 0.52. 0.52 divided by 3 is about 0.173333... So yes, 9.1733... grams.

Now, the question asks for the average in milligrams. Oh, right, because 1 gram is 1000 milligrams. So I need to convert grams to milligrams. So 9.1733 grams multiplied by 1000 gives 9173.333... milligrams.

Looking at the answer options, let's see which one is closest. The options are A:9180, B:9150, C:9200, D:9135, E:9155, F:9190, G:9145, H:30650, I:27520, J:9170.

Wait, my calculation is approximately 9173.33 mg. The closest option is J:9170 mg. But wait, let me double-check the initial addition and average calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, 9.17 +9.15 is indeed 18.32. Adding 9.20 gives 27.52. Divided by 3 is 9.1733... grams. Yes, correct. Multiply by 1000: 9173.3 mg. So the closest option is J:9170. But wait, let's look at the options again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider significant figures. The measurements are given to two decimal places, so the average should be reported to the same precision. But wait, the first two measurements have two decimal places—so the average would be to two decimal places as well. Wait, 9.17, 9.15, 9.20 all have three significant figures, but when adding, it's the decimal places that matter.

Wait, no, when calculating an average, the significant figures are based on the measurement's precision. Since each measurement is to the hundredth place (two decimal places), the average should also be expressed to the hundredth place. So 9.17 +9.15 +9.20 = 27.52 grams. Divided by 3: 9.173333... grams. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 9.17 grams. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 9.1733 is approximately 9.17 when rounded to two decimal places. Wait, no, 9.1733 is 9.17 when rounded to the nearest hundredth. So 9.17 grams.

Wait, but wait, the calculation earlier gives 9.1733 grams, which is approximately 9.17 grams when rounded to two decimal places. So 9.17 grams is 9170 mg. Oh, because 9.17 grams is 9170 mg.

Wait, but if the average is 9.1733 grams, then 9.1733 *1000 = 9173.3 mg, which is 9173.3 mg. So the exact value would be 9173.3 mg. But when rounding to the appropriate number of significant figures, since each original measurement has three significant figures, the average should have three as well. So 9.17 grams is three significant figures, which is 9170 mg when converted, but wait, 9.17 grams is 9170 mg exactly? Wait, no: 9.17 grams is 9170 mg because 9.17 *1000 =9170. So if the average is 9.17 grams, then it's exactly 9170 mg.

But in my initial calculation, I had 9.1733 grams, which is approximately 9.17 grams when rounded to two decimal places. So the average is 9.17 grams, which is 9170 mg. So the correct option would be J:9170 mg.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option J is 9170 mg, which aligns with this. Alternatively, if the average was taken as 9.1733 grams, which is 9173.3 mg, but none of the options have that. The closest is J:9170, which is 9170, so that's the right choice.

So the answer should be option J:9170 mg.

To determine the average weight of the object in milligrams, we first calculate the average of the three measurements: 9.17 g, 9.15 g, and 9.20 g. Adding these together gives:

\[
9.17 + 9.15 + 9.20 = 27.52 \, \text{g}.
\]

The average is then:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{27.52}{3} = 9.1733 \, \text{g}.
\]

To convert this to milligrams, we multiply by 1000:

\[
9.1733 \, \text{g} \times 1000 = 9173.3 \, \text{mg}.
\]

Considering significant figures, the original measurements are given to two decimal places, so the average should also be rounded to two decimal places, resulting in:

\[
9.17 \, \text{g} = 9170 \, \text{mg}.
\]

Among the provided options, the closest match is:

**J: 9170 mg.**
