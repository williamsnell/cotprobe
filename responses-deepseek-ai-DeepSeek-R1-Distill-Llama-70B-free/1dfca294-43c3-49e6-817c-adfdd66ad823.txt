Question:

One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the father did not retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege.
B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.
C: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.
D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.
E: admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public.
F: admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father was.
G: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.
H: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.
I: inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship.
J: inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically attorney-client privilege. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The scenario is that a pilot's plane ran out of gas, and during an emergency landing, a 9-year-old boy was hit by something that might have fallen from the plane. The boy's father is suing the pilot for negligence in federal court.

Before the lawsuit, the boy and his father went to an attorney for preliminary discussions. But the father didn't hire that attorney; he hired another one instead. Now, at trial, the pilot's attorney is calling the consulting attorney to testify about what the boy said regarding his physical condition during their meeting.

The question is whether that testimony is admissible. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a client and their attorney made during the legal consultation. But there are exceptions and certain conditions.

So, the key points here: the father didn't retain the consulting attorney. The boy was present during the consultation. The attorney is being asked about the boy's statements about his physical condition.

Wait, but who is the client here? The father brought the son to the attorney. So the client would be the father, right? Because the attorney was consulted by the father regarding his son's case. So the boy is the potential plaintiff, but the client is the father.

Attorney-client privilege applies when the communication is between the client and the attorney. But here, the boy made statements. So, does the privilege cover the boy's statements as well?

I think that when a client brings a third party to the consultation, like a family member, the presence of that third party doesn't necessarily break the privilege. Unless the third party is someone who's not necessary for the consultation, like a mere bystander.

Wait, but in this case, the boy is the one who was injured, so the father was likely discussing the case on behalf of the son. So perhaps the son's statements would be considered part of the confidential communication.

But wait, the consulting attorney wasn't retained. Does that matter? I think the privilege can apply even in preliminary consultations, regardless of whether the attorney is hired. Because the purpose of the meeting was to seek legal advice, so the communications should still be privileged.

Now, the issue is whether the attorney can testify about the boy's statements. Since the boy is the one making the statements, and the father is the client, does the privilege cover the boy's statements as well? Or does it only cover what the client (father) says?

I remember that the attorney-client privilege covers communications from the client to the attorney, and the attorney to the client, during legal consultation. It can also extend to statements made by someone who is present at the client's request, like a family member, if it's for the purpose of the legal representation.

So in this case, the boy's statements made during the consultation with the attorney, in the presence of his father, would be privileged because they were made for the purpose of seeking legal advice. Therefore, the consulting attorney can't disclose those communications without the client's consent.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege. So that's a possible answer.

Option G says it's admissible because a third party was present. But I thought that if the third party is there at the client's behest, the privilege still holds. So G might not be correct.

Option F says it's admissible because the boy wasn't the client, only the father was. Hmm, but the boy's statements were made during the consultation where the father was seeking advice as the client. So the boy's statements would be part of the privileged communication.

Option A says admissible because the father didn't retain the attorney, so no privilege. But I think the privilege applies even if the attorney isn't retained because the communication was for the purpose of seeking legal advice.

Option D says inadmissible because the privilege continues even if another attorney is hired. That makes sense because the consulting attorney's communications are still privileged; hiring another attorney doesn't waive it.

Wait, so the key is whether the boy's statements are protected by privilege. Since the father was the client and the boy was there to discuss his condition, which is relevant to the legal case, those statements should be privileged.

So the consulting attorney shouldn't be allowed to testify about what the boy said because that's covered under attorney-client privilege.

Looking at the options, C says it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege. D says it's inadmissible because the privilege is maintained even if another attorney is hired. So both C and D seem possible.

Wait, what's the difference between C and D? C is more general, stating that the privilege prevents the breach. D is about the privilege being maintained despite a different attorney being hired.

So in this case, the fact that a different attorney was hired doesn't matter; the privilege still applies. So D would be correct, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the consulting attorney's testimony is about the boy's statements. If the boy was not the client, but the father was, does the privilege still cover the boy's statements?

Wait, attorney-client privilege covers the client's communications, including information provided by others if it's part of the legal representation. So when the father brings his son to discuss the case, the son's statements are part of the privileged communication because the father is seeking legal advice regarding his son's situation.

So the consulting attorney can't disclose those statements because they're protected under the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible.

Looking at the options again, C and D are both about inadmissibility due to privilege. C says it's because of the breach of confidential communications. D says because the privilege is maintained even if another attorney is hired.

Wait, but the fact that a different attorney was hired doesn't impact the privilege. The consulting attorney's privilege remains, regardless of whether the client hires another attorney.

So the reason the testimony is inadmissible is because of the attorney-client privilege, regardless of who the attorney is. So C and D could both fit.

Alternatively, the fact that the boy wasn't the client might matter. Wait, the father was the client, so the boy's statements were made during the father's consultation for legal advice, so they are protected.

So the correct answer would be that the testimony is inadmissible due to attorney-client privilege, making option C or D correct.

Wait, looking back, option D says the privilege is maintained even when another attorney is hired. That's correct because the consulting attorney's communications are still privileged. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but option C says it's inadmissible because the privilege prevents such a breach. That's also correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the distinction is that the consulting attorney was not the attorney who was retained. So the privilege exists regardless of whether the attorney was hired or not. So the communication is still protected.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: inadmissible because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.

Wait, but another angle: the presence of the boy. If the boy was present, does that affect the privilege? If a third party is present, does it waive the privilege?

Generally, if a client brings a third party who is necessary for the consultation, like a family member providing information, the privilege isn't waived. But if the third party is someone unnecessary, like a friend, it could waive the privilege.

In this case, the boy is the injured party, so his presence is necessary for the father to discuss the case. So the privilege remains.

Therefore, the consulting attorney can't testify about the boy's statements because they're privileged.

So looking at the options:

Option C: inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege preventing breach.

Option D: inadmissible because the privilege is maintained even when another attorney is hired.

Hmm, perhaps the more accurate answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the fact that the father didn't retain the attorney doesn't affect the privilege, as the communication was still for the purpose of seeking legal advice.

So, the answer would be D: inadmissible because the privilege is maintained even if another attorney is hired.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the consulting attorney wasn't the one hired. Does that mean the privilege still applies? I think yes, because the purpose of the meeting was to seek legal advice, so the communication is privileged regardless of whether the attorney was retained.

So, the correct answer is either C or D.

Another approach: the attorney-client privilege applies to any confidential communication between a lawyer and a client during the legal consultation, regardless of whether the lawyer is later hired.

So the consulting attorney's testimony about the boy's statements is barred by the privilege.

So the options that say it's inadmissible due to privilege are C and D.

Looking at the options, option D says the privilege is maintained even if another attorney is hired. So that's correct because the consulting attorney's communications are still privileged, even though the father hired another attorney.

So the answer is D.

Wait, but wait, the boy was not the client. The client was the father. So the boy's statements to the attorney are part of the privileged communication because the father was seeking legal advice about his son's situation.

Therefore, the attorney can't disclose the boy's statements because they are covered under the privilege.

So the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether the consulting attorney's testimony about the boy's statements during a preliminary consultation is admissible in court. The key issue is the application of the attorney-client privilege, which protects confidential communications between a client and an attorney made during legal consultation. Here's the analysis:

1. **Attorney-Client Privilege Basics**: The privilege applies to communications made during legal consultation, regardless of whether the attorney is ultimately retained. It also extends to statements made by third parties (like the boy) if they are part of the legal discussion and necessary for the attorney to provide advice.

2. **Client Identification**: In this scenario, the father is the client because he initiated the consultation to seek legal advice about his son's case. The boy's statements during the consultation were made in the presence of the father and were relevant to the legal advice being sought. Therefore, the boy's statements are protected under the attorney-client privilege.

3. **Presence of a Third Party**: The boy's presence during the consultation does not waive the privilege because he was there to provide information necessary for the legal advice. The privilege remains intact unless a third party is present unnecessarily.

4. **Impact of Not Retaining the Attorney**: The fact that the consulting attorney was not retained does not affect the application of the privilege. The communication was still made for the purpose of seeking legal advice, so it remains protected.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option C**: Correctly states that the testimony is inadmissible because the attorney-client privilege prevents the breach of confidential communications.
   - **Option D**: Also correct, as it emphasizes that the privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired. This aligns with the principle that the privilege applies regardless of whether the attorney is retained.

6. **Conclusion**: Both options C and D are plausible, but the more precise reasoning is that the privilege is maintained even if another attorney is hired, making **Option D** the best answer.

**Answer: D**
