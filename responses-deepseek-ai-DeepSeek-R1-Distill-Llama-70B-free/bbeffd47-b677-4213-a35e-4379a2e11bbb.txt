Question:

A radioactive isotope, which is used in diagnostic imaging, has a half-life of 6.0 hours. If a quantity of this isotope has an activity of 150 mCi when it is delivered to a hospital, how much activity will remain 24 hours after delivery? (mCi = microcuries)

Options:

A: 150 mCi
B: 9.4 mCi
C: 4.7 mCi
D: 12.5 mCi
E: 25 mCi
F: 50 mCi
G: 19 mCi
H: 75 mCi
I: 38 mCi
J: 2.3 mCi

Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive isotopes and their half-life. Hmm, I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive substance to decay. So, the question is about figuring out how much activity remains after a certain time.

The isotope has a half-life of 6 hours, and the initial activity is 150 mCi. They want to know the activity after 24 hours. Right, so I need to calculate how many half-lives pass in 24 hours and then determine the remaining activity.

Let me think, 24 hours divided by 6 hours per half-life. Oh yeah, 24/6 is 4. So that's 4 half-lives. Each half-life, the activity halves. So each time, it's multiplied by 1/2.

Starting with 150 mCi. After the first half-life (6 hrs), it's 75 mCi. Second half-life (12 hrs total) is 37.5 mCi. Third half-life (18 hrs) is 18.75 mCi. Fourth half-life (24 hrs) would be 9.375 mCi. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option B which is 9.4 mCi. Hmm, maybe I should double-check my calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I was too quick. Let me write it out step by step. Each step halves the current amount.

1st half-life: 150 * (1/2) = 75 mCi.
2nd: 75 * 1/2 = 37.5 mCi.
3rd: 37.5 * 1/2 = 18.75 mCi.
4th: 18.75 * 1/2 = 9.375 mCi.

Yes, that's correct. So 9.375 mCi. The options have 9.4 mCi as option B, which is probably rounded up. So the answer should be B.

Wait a second, but another way to calculate this is by using the decay formula: A = A0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Let's plug the numbers. A0 is 150 mCi, t is 24, t_half is 6. So (24/6)=4. So it's 150 * (1/2)^4. 1/2^4 is 1/16, which is 0.0625. 150 * 0.0625 is 9.375, so yeah, same result.

So the answer must be B: 9.4 mCi. Oh wait, but why is it 9.4 and not 9.375? Because the options probably round to one decimal place. So 9.375 would round to 9.4. So yes, B is correct.

To determine the remaining activity of the radioactive isotope after 24 hours, we use the concept of half-life. The isotope has a half-life of 6 hours, meaning its activity decreases by half every 6 hours. The initial activity is 150 mCi, and we calculate the number of half-lives that pass in 24 hours:

\[
\text{Number of half-lives} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Half-life}} = \frac{24}{6} = 4.
\]

The remaining activity after 4 half-lives can be calculated using the formula:

\[
A = A_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n,
\]

where \( A_0 = 150 \, \text{mCi} \) and \( n = 4 \). Substituting the values:

\[
A = 150 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = 150 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = 9.375 \, \text{mCi}.
\]

The closest option to 9.375 mCi is 9.4 mCi, which corresponds to option B. Therefore, the remaining activity after 24 hours is:

**B: 9.4 mCi.**
