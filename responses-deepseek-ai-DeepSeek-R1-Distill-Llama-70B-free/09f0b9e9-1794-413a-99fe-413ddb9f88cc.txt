Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this ring theory question. Let's see. The question is about right ideals in a ring R with a multiplicative identity. The setup is that U is an additive subgroup of R, and for every u in U and r in R, the product ur is in U. That makes U a right ideal. Now, the ring R has exactly two right ideals, and I need to determine which of the statements I, II, III must be true.

First, let me recall some ring theory basics. In a ring with unity, the two trivial right ideals are the zero ideal {0} and the ring R itself. If R has exactly two right ideals, that suggests that it's a simple ring, meaning it doesn't have any nontrivial (i.e., other than {0} and R) right ideals.

Wait, but the question says R has exactly two right ideals. So that would mean the only right ideals are {0} and R. So R is a simple ring in the sense that it has no other right ideals. But not necessarily a simple ring in the Artinian sense, I think. Or wait, maybe it's related to being a division ring.

So let me think about each statement.

Statement I: R is commutative. Hmm. Well, if R is a division ring, it's a simple Artinian ring. But division rings aren't necessarily commutative. For example, the quaternions are a division ring but not commutative. So even if R is a division ring, it might not be commutative. So statement I isn't necessarily true.

Statement II: R is a division ring. That is, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Well, if R has exactly two right ideals, then for any non-zero element a, the right ideal generated by a must be all of R. Because if a is non-zero, then the set aR is a right ideal containing a, which can't be {0} (since a is non-zero). So aR must be R. Therefore, there exists some r in R such that ar = 1 (the multiplicative identity). So a has a right inverse. But does this imply that a has a two-sided inverse? Wait, in a ring with unity, if an element has a right inverse, it also has a left inverse, making it a unit. So every non-zero element is a unit. So R is indeed a division ring. So Statement II must be true.

Statement III: R is infinite. Hmm. Let's think. If R is a finite ring with exactly two right ideals, then it's a division ring. Wait, but a finite division ring is a field, right? Because in finite rings, being a division ring implies commutativity (Wedderburn's theorem). Wait, but Wedderburn's theorem says that finite division rings are commutative, hence fields. So if R is finite and a division ring, it's a field, which is commutative. So in that case, R would be a field, which is a commutative division ring, and thus would have exactly two ideals (since fields have no nontrivial ideals). But the question is whether R must be infinite. So could R be finite? Let's see.

If R is a finite ring with exactly two right ideals, then R is a division ring, which by Wedderburn's Little Theorem is commutative, hence a field. So R would be a finite field. But finite fields are indeed rings with exactly two ideals. So in that case, R could be finite. So statement III, that R is infinite, is not necessarily true. So R could be finite or infinite. Therefore, statement III isn't necessarily true.

So putting it together: Statement II is true, but I and III aren't necessarily true. So the correct answer should be that only II holds.

Wait, but the options don't directly say that. Let me check the options.

Options:

A: R is a finite ring — No, because R could be infinite.

B: R is a ring without a multiplicative identity — No, because the question says R has a multiplicative identity.

C: II and III only — No, because III isn't necessarily true.

D: II only — Yes, that's what I concluded.

E: I and III only — No, I isn't necessarily true.

F: I and II only — No, same reason.

G: None of the above — No, because II is true.

H: III only — No, because III isn't necessarily true.

I: I only — No, because I isn't necessarily true.

J: I, II, III — No.

So the correct answer should be D: II only.

To determine which statements must be true for a ring \( R \) with a multiplicative identity that has exactly two right ideals, we analyze each statement:

1. **Statement I: \( R \) is commutative.**  
   A ring with exactly two right ideals is a division ring, but division rings are not necessarily commutative. For example, the quaternions form a division ring that is not commutative. Therefore, \( R \) is not necessarily commutative, and Statement I is false.

2. **Statement II: \( R \) is a division ring.**  
   If \( R \) has exactly two right ideals, then for any non-zero element \( a \in R \), the right ideal generated by \( a \) must be \( R \) itself. This implies that \( a \) has a right inverse, and in a ring with unity, this also ensures a left inverse, making \( R \) a division ring. Thus, Statement II is true.

3. **Statement III: \( R \) is infinite.**  
   A finite ring with exactly two right ideals is a division ring, and by Wedderburn's Little Theorem, it must be a finite field. Finite fields are rings with exactly two ideals, so \( R \) could be finite. Therefore, \( R \) is not necessarily infinite, and Statement III is false.

From this analysis, only Statement II must be true. The correct answer is:

**D: II only.**
