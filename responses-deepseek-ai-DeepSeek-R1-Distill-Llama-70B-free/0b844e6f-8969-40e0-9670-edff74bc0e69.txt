Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the average speed of gas molecules in a mixture. Hmm, I remember from chemistry that gases have different properties based on their molar mass. The question is asking which gas has the greatest average speed.

Wait, I think it's related to the molar mass. Oh right, Graham's law of effusion! That's the one. It says that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So lighter molecules move faster.

So the gases in the mixture are hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Let me think about their molar masses. Hydrogen is H2, so molar mass is about 2 g/mol. Oxygen is O2, which is 32 g/mol, and Nitrogen is N2, which is 28 g/mol. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Nitrogen is N2, which is 14*2 = 28 g/mol. Oxygen is O2, 16*2=32. So hydrogen is the lightest.

So the lighter the molecule, the higher the average speed. So hydrogen should have the highest average speed. Looking at the options, option F is hydrogen, so that's probably the answer.

Wait, but the options given are A to J. Let me check the options again. The options are A: same speed, B: helium, but that's not in the question. Oh wait, the question says the mixture is hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen. So the options given are, in the problem, they are the possible answers. So the correct answer should be F: hydrogen.

Other options: A says they all have same speed, but that's not right because speed depends on molar mass. So A is incorrect. B is helium, which isn't part of the mixture. So F is the right choice.

The average speed of gas molecules in a mixture is determined by their molar mass, with lighter molecules moving faster. Among hydrogen (H₂), oxygen (O₂), and nitrogen (N₂), hydrogen has the lowest molar mass (2 g/mol), making its molecules the fastest on average. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect, as average speed varies with molar mass.
- **Option B**: Irrelevant, as helium is not in the mixture.
- **Option F**: Correct, as hydrogen has the greatest average speed due to its low molar mass.

Answer: F
