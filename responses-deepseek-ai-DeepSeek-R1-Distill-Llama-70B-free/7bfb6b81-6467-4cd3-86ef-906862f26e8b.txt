Okay, so I've got this question here where I need to round the number .1476 to different decimal places. Let me think about how to approach each part step by step.

First, I remember that rounding a number depends on the digit immediately after the place you're rounding to. If that digit is 5 or higher, you round up the previous digit by one. If it's less than 5, you leave it as is.

Let's tackle part (a) which is rounding to two decimal places. The number is .1476. So, the first two decimals are 1 and 4, and the next digit is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, I need to round the 4 up to 5. So, rounding .1476 to two decimal places would make it .15. Wait, but let me double-check: the third decimal is 7, which is definitely more than 5, so yes, the second decimal (4) becomes 5.

Moving on to part (b), rounding to three decimal places. The number is still .1476. The third decimal is 7, and the next digit is 6. Since 6 is above 5, I round the 7 up by 1, making it 8. So, the third decimal becomes 8, and the number is .148.

Wait a second, no. Wait, the third decimal in the original number is 7, and the next digit is 6. So when rounding to three decimals, I look at the fourth decimal. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait a second, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, the number is .1476. So the first decimal is 1, second 4, third 7, and fourth 6.

When rounding to three decimal places, I look at the fourth decimal, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, I round the third decimal (7) up by 1. But 7 plus 1 is 8, so the number becomes .148.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 7 plus 1 is 8, so yeah, it's .148.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when you round a 9, it carries over, but here 7 becomes 8 without any issue.

Then part (c) is rounding to one decimal place. So, the first decimal is 1, the next is 4. Since we're rounding to one decimal, we look at the second decimal, which is 4. 4 is less than 5, so we don't round up. Therefore, it stays at .1.

Wait, but wait, the number is .1476. So the first decimal is 1, the second is 4, third is 7. When rounding to one decimal place, you look at the second decimal (4). Since 4 <5, you leave the first decimal as is, so .1.

Wait, but wait another thought: maybe I'm making a mistake. Because when you have .1476, and you round to one decimal place, the number is .1 (since the next digit 4 is less than 5). So yes, .1.

Wait, but sometimes, when you have more digits, does the 4 being followed by a 7 affect it? No, because when rounding to one decimal place, you only look at the next digit, which is 4, and make the decision based on that. So yes, .1.

So putting it all together:

(a) .15

(b) .148

(c) .1

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1. That matches what I got.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: (a) .14, (b) .147, (c) .1 → No, because (a) should be .15.

Option B: (a) .16, (b) .149, (c) .1 → No, because (a) is .16, which is incorrect.

Option C: (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → Yes, matches.

Option D: (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .2 → No, because part (c) is .1, not .2.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem of rounding .1476 to different decimal places, we follow these steps:

1. **Rounding to 2 decimal places (a):**  
   Look at the third decimal, which is 7. Since 7 ≥ 5, we round the second decimal (4) up by 1, making it 5. Thus, .1476 rounded to two decimal places is **.15**.

2. **Rounding to 3 decimal places (b):**  
   Look at the fourth decimal, which is 6. Since 6 ≥ 5, we round the third decimal (7) up by 1, making it 8. Thus, .1476 rounded to three decimal places is **.148**.

3. **Rounding to 1 decimal place (c):**  
   Look at the second decimal, which is 4. Since 4 < 5, we leave the first decimal (1) unchanged. Thus, .1476 rounded to one decimal place is **.1**.

Now, comparing these results with the given options:

- **Option A:** (a) .14, (b) .147, (c) .1 → Incorrect, as (a) should be .15.  
- **Option B:** (a) .16, (b) .149, (c) .1 → Incorrect, as (a) should be .15.  
- **Option C:** (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → Correct, matches all parts.  
- **Option D:** (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .2 → Incorrect, as (c) should be .1.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

C
