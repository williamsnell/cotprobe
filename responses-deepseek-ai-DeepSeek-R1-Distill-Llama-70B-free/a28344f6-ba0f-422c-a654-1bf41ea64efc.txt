Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about standardized tests, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is: "Standardized tests are..." and then there are options from A to G.

First, I should recall what standardized tests are. From what I remember, standardized tests are tests that are administered and scored in a consistent manner. They're usually designed to have the same questions, format, and scoring so that everyone takes the test under the same conditions. This allows for comparing the results of different people.

Now, let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Tests that are used to measure intelligence. Hmm, I know that some standardized tests are used to measure intelligence, like IQ tests. But are all standardized tests for that? I don't think so. For example, the SAT is a standardized test used for college admissions, but it doesn't measure intelligence per se. So this might not be the correct answer because it's too specific to intelligence.

Option B: Tests that are given only once a year. Wait, some standardized tests are given once a year, like the SAT or state exams, but others can be taken multiple times a year. For example, the GRE can be taken more than once. So this doesn't seem correct because it's not a defining feature of standardized tests.

Option C: Tests that have no right or wrong answers. That doesn't sound right. Most standardized tests I know have right and wrong answers, especially multiple-choice ones. They're scored based on correct responses. So I can probably rule this one out.

Option D: Tests for which a person's performance can be compared with a pilot group. Oh, I think this is about norm-referenced tests. Standardized tests are often compared to a norm group, which is a large sample of people who have taken the test before. This allows for comparing individual performance against that group, providing percentile ranks or other comparative scores. So this sounds correct.

Option E: Any examination given by your state or country. That's too broad. There are many state or country exams that aren't standardized. For instance, a school might give a local exam that's not standardized. So this isn't accurate.

Option F: Tests that are only multiple-choice questions. No, while many standardized tests include multiple-choice questions, they can also have other formats like essays or open-ended questions. For example, the SAT has an optional essay section, but it's not the only format. So F isn't correct.

Option G: Tests given by your school district. Again, school districts give various tests, but not all are standardized. Some are locally developed and not standardized. So this isn't the right answer.

Putting it all together, the best fit seems to be option D. Standardized tests allow for comparison with a pilot or norm group, which is a key characteristic.

The correct answer is D: tests for which a person's performance can be compared with a pilot group.
