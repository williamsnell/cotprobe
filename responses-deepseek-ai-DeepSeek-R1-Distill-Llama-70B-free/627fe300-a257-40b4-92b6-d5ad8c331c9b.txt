Okay, so I've got this problem about neutral density filters and their transmittance based on thickness. Hmm, I remember that neutral density filters reduce the intensity of light equally across all wavelengths, so they're used to control exposure in photography and other applications.

The question says that a 0.1 mm thick filter gives 70% transmission. Now, if the thickness increases to 2 mm, what's the transmittance? I think transmission depends on the thickness of the filter because more thickness means more absorption, so lower transmission.

Wait, I remember something about the Beer-Lambert Law. Isn't that the one that relates absorbance to concentration and path length? Oh right, the formula is A = εlc, where A is absorbance, ε is the molar absorptivity, l is the path length (thickness, in this case), and c is concentration. But wait, in this case, the filter's thickness changes, so maybe the concentration is the same, but the path length (l) is changing.

But wait, transmittance (T) is the fraction of light that passes through. So T is related to absorbance. Oh right, because absorbance (A) is log(1/T). Or wait, I think the formula is T = 10^(-A), since A = log(1/T), which means T = 10^(-A).

But in this problem, the filter's thickness changes. So for the initial case, when the thickness is 0.1 mm, T1 is 70%, which is 0.7. Now, when the thickness is 2 mm, which is 20 times thicker (because 2 / 0.1 is 20), what happens to the transmission?

Wait, because the Beer-Lambert Law says that absorbance is proportional to the path length. So if the path length increases by a factor of 20, the absorbance (A) would increase by 20 times. Since the initial transmission is 70%, that's T1 = 0.7. So the initial absorbance A1 is log(1/0.7) = log(10/7) ≈ 0.1549.

Wait, no, wait. Because T is 70%, so A1 = log(1/0.7) ≈ 0.1549. So when the thickness is 20 times more, the absorbance becomes A2 = 20 * A1 = 20 * 0.1549 ≈ 3.098.

Then, the transmittance T2 would be 10^(-A2) = 10^(-3.098). Let me calculate that. 10^(-3) is 0.001, and 10^(-0.098) is approximately 0.8. So 0.001 * 0.8 = 0.0008, which is 0.08% transmission.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.08%, which is what I got. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently, using the formula T = T0^(l/L), where T0 is the transmission for thickness L. Wait, perhaps another approach. 

Alternatively, the transmission through a medium can be modeled as T = e^(-α l), where α is the absorption coefficient. But wait, that's for absorbance in terms of natural logs. Or perhaps, the formula is T = (T_initial)^(l/l_initial), assuming the same material, so it's an exponential relationship.

Wait, because each mm of the filter reduces the transmission by a factor. So if 0.1 mm gives 70% transmission, then for each 0.1 mm, the transmission is 0.7. So for 2 mm, which is 20 times 0.1 mm, the transmission would be (0.7)^20.

Wait, that makes sense because each 0.1 mm contributes a factor of 0.7 in transmission. So for each additional 0.1 mm, you multiply by another 0.7. So 0.7^20 is the transmission. Let me calculate that.

0.7^20: Let's see, 0.7^2 is 0.49, 0.7^4 is 0.49^2 = 0.2401, 0.7^8 is 0.2401^2 ≈ 0.0576, 0.7^16 is (0.0576)^2 ≈ 0.0033. Then 0.7^20 is 0.7^16 * 0.7^4 ≈ 0.0033 * 0.2401 ≈ 0.000792, which is about 0.0792%, which is approximately 0.08%. So that's the same as before, which would be option D.

Alternatively, if I compute it using logs: ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. Multiply by 20: -0.3567 * 20 ≈ -7.134. Then e^-7.134 is about e^-7 is around 0.000911, but e^-7.134 is a bit less, maybe 0.0008, so 0.08%.

So both methods give the same result. Therefore, the correct answer should be D: 0.08%.

To determine the transmittance of a 2 mm thick neutral density filter, we start with the given data: a 0.1 mm thick filter has a transmittance of 70% (0.7). The relationship between transmittance and thickness can be modeled using the formula:

\[
T = T_0^{l / l_0}
\]

where:
- \(T_0 = 0.7\) (transmittance for 0.1 mm thickness),
- \(l_0 = 0.1 \, \text{mm}\) (initial thickness),
- \(l = 2 \, \text{mm}\) (new thickness).

Substituting the values:

\[
T = 0.7^{2 / 0.1} = 0.7^{20}
\]

To calculate \(0.7^{20}\), we can use logarithms or direct computation. Using logarithms:

\[
\ln(0.7) \approx -0.3567
\]

\[
\ln(T) = 20 \cdot \ln(0.7) = 20 \cdot (-0.3567) \approx -7.134
\]

\[
T = e^{-7.134} \approx 0.0008 \, \text{(or 0.08%)}.
\]

This matches the result obtained by direct computation of \(0.7^{20}\), which also gives approximately 0.08%.

Thus, the transmittance of the 2 mm thick filter is **0.08%**, corresponding to option **D**.
