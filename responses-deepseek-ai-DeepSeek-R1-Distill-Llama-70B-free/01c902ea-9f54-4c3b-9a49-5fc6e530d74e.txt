Okay, so I have this question about the z-transform, and I'm a bit new to this concept, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking me to find the z-transform of a given function f[n] using the definition provided.

First, let me remember what the bilateral z-transform is. From what I learned, the bilateral z-transform is defined as F(z) = sum from n = -infinity to infinity of f[n] * z^-n. So each term f[n] is multiplied by z raised to the negative of n, and then summed over all n.

The function given is f[n] = 3δ[n+2] + 4δ[n-1] + 2δ[n-3]. Hmm, ok. So δ is the Kronecker delta function, which is 1 when its argument is 0 and 0 otherwise. So this function f[n] is zero everywhere except at n = -2, 1, and -3. Let me note the values:

At n = -2: f[-2] = 3.
At n = 1: f[1] = 4.
At n = -3: f[-3] = 2.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The function is 3δ[n+2], which is 3 when n+2=0 → n=-2. Similarly, 4δ[n-1] is 4 when n=1, and 2δ[n-3] is 2 when n=3? Wait, wait. No, δ[n-3] is non-zero when n=3. So f[3] = 2.

Wait no, wait again. Wait, the function is written as 3δ[n+2]. So δ[n+2] is 1 when n+2=0, which is when n = -2. So f[-2] =3.

Similarly, 4δ[n-1] is 4 when n=1.

And 2δ[n-3] is 2 when n=3.

Wait, but in the options, when I look at the exponents, I see terms like z^-3, which would correspond to n=3? Or wait, no. Because in the transform, each term is f[n] * z^-n. So for each n, the exponent is -n.

So for n=-2: the term is 3 * z^{-(-2)} = 3 z^{2}.

For n=1: term is4 * z^{-1}.

For n=3: term is2 * z^{-3}.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. For each n, the exponent is -n. So f[n] is non-zero at n=-2, 1, 3.

So for n=-2: z^-n is z^{-(-2)} = z^2. So the term is 3 * z^2.

For n=1: z^-1 → term is4 * z^-1.

For n=3: z^-3 → term is2 * z^-3.

So putting it all together, F(z) = 3 z^2 + 4 z^-1 + 2 z^-3.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: 3z^-2 +4z^-1 +2z^3 → No, because that would mean n=2,1,-3, which isn't our case.

Option B: 3z^2 +4z^-1 + 2z^-3. Oh, that's exactly what I have.

Option C: 2z^3 + ... no.

Option D: 4z^2... no.

Option E: 4z^-3... no.

Option F: 3z^2+2z^-1+4z^-3. No, because the coefficients don't match.

Option G: 2z^2... no.

Option H: 3z^3... no.

Option I: 4z^3... no.

Option J: 2z^-1... no.

So the correct one is option B.

To find the z-transform of \( f[n] = 3\delta[n+2] + 4\delta[n-1] + 2\delta[n-3] \), we use the definition of the bilateral z-transform:

\[
F(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} f[n] z^{-n}.
\]

The function \( f[n] \) is nonzero at three points:
- At \( n = -2 \), \( f[-2] = 3 \), contributing \( 3z^{-(-2)} = 3z^2 \).
- At \( n = 1 \), \( f[1] = 4 \), contributing \( 4z^{-1} \).
- At \( n = 3 \), \( f[3] = 2 \), contributing \( 2z^{-3} \).

Thus, the z-transform is:

\[
F(z) = 3z^2 + 4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3}.
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( 3z^{-2} + 4z^{-1} + 2z^3 \) — Incorrect, as the exponents do not match.
- **Option B**: \( 3z^2 + 4z^{-1} + 2z^{-3} \) — Correct, matches the derived result.
- **Option C**: \( 2z^3 + 4z^{-2} + 3z^{-1} \) — Incorrect, coefficients and exponents do not match.
- **Option D**: \( 4z^2 + 3z^{-1} + 2z^{-3} \) — Incorrect, coefficients do not match.
- **Option E**: \( 4z^{-3} + 3z^{-2} + 2z^{-1} \) — Incorrect, exponents and coefficients do not match.
- **Option F**: \( 3z^2 + 2z^{-1} + 4z^{-3} \) — Incorrect, coefficients do not match.
- **Option G**: \( 2z^2 + 4z^{-1} + 3z^{-3} \) — Incorrect, coefficients do not match.
- **Option H**: \( 3z^3 + 4z + 2z^{-2} \) — Incorrect, exponents do not match.
- **Option I**: \( 4z^3 + 2z + 3z^{-2} \) — Incorrect, exponents do not match.
- **Option J**: \( 2z^{-1} + 3z^{-3} + 4z^2 \) — Incorrect, coefficients do not match.

The correct answer is **Option B**.
