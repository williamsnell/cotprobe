Okay, so I have this question about Ashford's argument regarding aid agencies and dependency. Hmm, I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me break it down.

The question says that Ashford argues that worries about causing dependency on aid agencies among those in extreme poverty do not mean that we should... and then there are several options.

First, I need to understand the context. Ashford is probably discussing the ethics of international aid. Some people worry that giving aid can make poor people dependent on it rather than solving the root causes. But Ashford is saying that just because there's a risk of dependency, it doesn't mean we should stop aiding entirely.

Wait, the question is about what we should not do. So Ashford is arguing against a particular conclusion. Let's see the options.

Option A: suggest that aid agencies are the only solution. That doesn't seem right. The worry is about dependency, but Ashford isn't saying they're the only solution. Probably not A.

Option B: abandon the poor. That makes sense because if people are worried about dependency, someone might argue we should stop helping. But Ashford is saying that we shouldn't do that. So the answer might be B because it's what we shouldn't do.

Option C: argue aid agencies are unjust. That's a different point. The dependency concern is more about effectiveness, not necessarily about justice. So maybe not C.

Option D: increase aid. That could be a possible solution, but the question isn't about what we should do instead, but what we shouldn't. So D might not be the answer.

Option E: ignore global economic justice. Ignoring the issue isn't directly related to the dependency worry. So probably not E.

Option F: force self-sufficiency. That sounds like a possible reaction to dependency, but Ashford is against that approach. So F could be the answer, but I'm not sure yet.

Option G: stop all aid. That's similar to B. If we stop aid, we're abandoning them. So either B or G could be correct.

Option H: accept no negative duties. Not sure what that means exactly. Negative duties are about not causing harm. So maybe Ashford is saying we do have duties, so H is what we shouldn't accept.

Option I: social contract approach. That's a different methodology, not directly about stopping aid or abandoning.

Option J: abolish aid agencies. Similar to G, but more extreme. Legally abolishing is a strong action.

So, the original statement is that the worry about dependency doesn't mean we should [something]. The something is probably stopping aid or abandoning the poor.

Between B and G. Let me think again. The question is about what we should NOT do. So Ashford is arguing that the dependency worry doesn't imply that we should abandon the poor. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but another angle: if someone is worried about dependency, they might say we should stop aid (G) or abandon (B). So the answer could be either, but the wording of the question is about what we shouldn't do because of the dependency worry.

I think Ashford's point is that even if there's a risk of dependency, it's not a reason to stop aiding. So the answer would be that we shouldn't abandon the poor (B) or stop all aid (G). But the options are different.

Looking again, the question is phrased as "does not mean that we should...", so the answer is the action we shouldn't take because of the dependency worry.

So, if someone is worried about dependency, they might think we should stop aid. But Ashford is arguing against that, meaning that the correct answer is that we shouldn't stop aid. So the options are either B or G.

Wait, but 'abandon the poor' is a broader statement than stopping aid. Because aid is one form of help, but there could be other forms. So G is about stopping all aid, which is a specific action. B is about abandoning, which is more about not helping at all.

I think the answer is B because Ashford is saying that even with the dependency concern, we shouldn't abandon the poor, meaning we should still help in some way.

Ashford's argument centers on the ethical considerations surrounding international aid and the risk of creating dependency among those in extreme poverty. The question asks what we should not do in response to such concerns. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** ("abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament") aligns with the idea that Ashford is arguing against stopping aid entirely or abandoning the poor simply because of the dependency concern. This reflects the notion that even if dependency is a risk, it does not justify ceasing support for those in need.

- **Option G** ("stop all forms of international aid") is similar but more specific, focusing on halting aid entirely. However, the broader phrasing of "abandoning the poor" in Option B better captures the ethical stance against leaving the poor without assistance.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as it encapsulates the moral argument against abandoning the poor due to dependency concerns.

Answer: B
