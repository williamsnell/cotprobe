Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the multiplier effect, and I'm a bit unsure, but I'll try to work through it. Let me start by recalling what I know about economic concepts, especially the multiplier effect.

From what I remember in my economics class, the multiplier effect has to do with how an initial change in spending leads to a larger change in overall economic output. It's like when government spending or investment increases, it doesn't just create jobs in that specific sector but also leads to more jobs in other sectors as the money gets circulated.

Wait, but wait, in the context of urban economics or regional economics, I think the multiplier effect is discussed in terms of basic and non-basic jobs. Basic jobs are those that produce goods and services for export outside the local economy, right? Like manufacturing or tech companies that sell products nationally or internationally. These jobs bring in new money from outside the area, which then circulates within the local economy.

Non-basic jobs, on the other hand, serve the local population. These are jobs in retail, services, healthcare, etc. They rely on the income generated within the community, including from the basic jobs. So when more basic jobs are added, they create income that supports more non-basic jobs.

The multiplier effect, in this case, refers to the idea that each basic job creates additional non-basic jobs. So the ratio of non-basic to basic jobs is an indicator of the multiplier effect. But wait, the question is phrased as "the multiplier effect is" and asks which option correctly defines it.

Looking at the options:

Option H says, "the addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers." Hmm, that sounds correct because when more basic jobs are added, non-basic jobs increase as a result. So the multiplier effect would be this addition.

Option D is "the ratio of non-basic workers to basic workers in an urban economy." That's the ratio, but the multiplier effect is more about the process of addition, not just the ratio. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Oh wait, the multiplier effect usually refers to the ratio, which is the number of non-basic jobs created per basic job. Or is it the total number of jobs created including the initial?

Wait, no, the multiplier effect is the total impact. Like, if you have one basic job, the multiplier might be 2, meaning one basic job leads to one additional non-basic job, making total jobs 2. So the ratio would be non-basic to basic, which is 1:1, but the multiplier is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms here.

Let me think again. The multiplier effect in the context of an urban economy is about how an increase in basic employment leads to an increase in non-basic employment. So the effect is the addition of non-basic workers resulting from adding more basic workers. So that would match option H.

Alternatively, option D is the ratio of non-basic to basic, which is the multiplier itself. For example, if the ratio is 2:1, then the multiplier is 2. So does the question ask for the effect or the ratio? The question says, "the multiplier effect is..." So the effect would be the process or the result of adding non-basic jobs when basic jobs are added.

So option H says, the addition of non-basic workers when more basic workers are added. That sounds like the effect. Option D is the ratio, which is more like the multiplier factor.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The multiplier effect is typically expressed as a ratio. Like, the multiplier is the ratio of total employment to basic employment. So total employment is basic plus non-basic. So the multiplier would be (B + N)/B, which is 1 + (N/B). So the multiplier effect is the factor by which the initial basic employment leads to an increase in total employment, including non-basic.

So the multiplier effect is the addition of non-basic jobs caused by the addition of basic jobs. So the effect is the addition of non-basic workers, which is option H.

Looking at the other options, option G is about rural jobs created by urban economy. That doesn't fit here. Option H is about non-basic added due to basic in urban, which aligns with the multiplier effect in urban economics.

The multiplier effect refers to the process by which an increase in basic jobs (those producing goods and services for export) leads to an increase in non-basic jobs (those serving the local population). This effect is observed in urban economies, where the addition of basic workers generates income that supports the creation of non-basic workers. 

Option H correctly captures this dynamic, as it describes the addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers. This aligns with the concept of the multiplier effect, which is the process of job creation beyond the initial basic jobs. Other options, such as Option D, refer to the ratio of non-basic to basic workers, which is related but does not define the multiplier effect itself. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: the addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers.

Answer: H
