Okay, so I've got this question about children's adjustment to their parents' divorce. Hmm, I remember that when parents get divorced, it can affect kids in various ways. The question is asking what's most related to their successful adjustment. Let me think through each option.

Option A says the quality of parent-child relationships before the divorce. That makes sense because if the relationship was good, maybe the child feels more secure. But wait, I've heard that the biggest factor isn't necessarily the relationship before but what happens after.

Option B is the degree of post-divorce conflict between parents. Oh right, I remember reading that ongoing conflict between parents can really stress out the kids. If the parents keep fighting even after the divorce, the child might feel anxious or caught in the middle. So that seems important.

Option C is academic performance before the divorce. I don't think that's the main factor. Maybe how a child does in school could be affected by the divorce, but I don't recall it being the key factor in adjustment.

Option D is frequency of contact with the noncustodial parent. It's probably good for the child to have contact, but I'm not sure if it's the most significant factor. Some studies say that it's more about the quality of the relationship than just how often they see each other.

Option E is the child's gender. I don't think gender is the main factor. Adjustment might vary, but it's probably not the biggest influence.

Option F is the socio-economic status. Money can help with stability, but I think emotional factors are more directly related to adjustment than financial ones.

Option G is the remarriage of the custodial parent. Remarriage can bring its own set of issues, like adjusting to a new parent figure, but I'm not sure if it's the top factor.

Option H is the number of siblings. Maybe having siblings offers support, but again, not the most critical factor I think.

Option I is the child's age at the time of divorce. Age might influence how the child understands the situation, but does it affect their adjustment the most? Not sure.

Option J is the child’s ability to understand the cause of the divorce. Understanding might help, but perhaps it's not the main factor. Younger kids might not grasp it as well, but that doesn't mean they adjust worse if other factors are positive.

So putting it all together, I think the biggest factor is the post-divorce conflict. If parents keep fighting, it creates a stressful environment for the child. So the correct answer should be B.

The most significant factor influencing children's successful adjustment to their parents' divorce is the degree of post-divorce conflict between the parents. Ongoing conflict can create a stressful and anxious environment for the child, making adjustment more difficult. Other factors, such as the quality of prior relationships, contact with the noncustodial parent, and the child's age, may play a role but are less critical than the level of conflict between the parents.

Answer: B
