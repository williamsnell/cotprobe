Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about trends in the number of unmarried heterosexual adults in the US from 1988 to 1990. The question is asking about the change in the number of people aged 20 to 45 who reported having multiple partners. The options are from A to J, each suggesting different patterns for men and women.

Hmm, I need to figure out whether the number increased, decreased, or stayed the same for men and women during that period. Wait, I remember that the late 80s and early 90s had significant changes in social behaviors, especially regarding sexual health. The AIDS epidemic was becoming more widely known during that time, which probably influenced people's behaviors.

So, I think that the fear of AIDS might have led people to reduce risky sexual behaviors, like having multiple partners. That would mean a decline in the number of people reporting multiple partners. But wait, did this trend apply to both men and women, or just one group?

I recall some studies suggesting that men and women might have been affected differently. Maybe men's behavior changed more, or perhaps women's did. Or perhaps both changed but in different ways. Alternatively, maybe only one gender showed a change.

Wait, another thought: in the 80s, there was a lot of emphasis on safe sex campaigns. These campaigns might have targeted both men and women, but perhaps men were more likely to report changes because they might have been more sexually active or perhaps the surveys showed that. Alternatively, maybe women's sexual behavior was more stable, or the reporting changed differently.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact data. I think during the late 80s, there was a decline in the number of sexual partners reported, especially among certain groups. But I'm not sure if it was for both genders or just one.

Alternatively, I remember that in the 90s, the sexual revolution might have started to take a different turn. But the period in question is 1988 to 1990, so right at the end of the 80s. So perhaps the AIDS crisis was having an impact.

I think that in the late 80s, both men and women became more cautious, leading to a decline in multiple partners. But wait, some data I might have seen before suggests that men's reported number of partners decreased, but women's didn't change as much. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, let me think again. I think in some studies, men reported a higher number of sexual partners than women, and in the late 80s, that number started to decrease for men, possibly due to increased awareness of AIDS and the use of condoms. But for women, perhaps the number didn't change as much, or maybe it did. Or maybe the trends were different.

Alternatively, perhaps both men and women's reports of multiple partners decreased. But looking at the options, option C says declined for both, and option G says declined for men but not women. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the question is specifically about unmarried adults. So maybe married people's behaviors weren't changing as much, but singles might have been. Also, the age range is 20-45, which includes a lot of people who might be in the dating scene.

I think I remember reading that during the late 80s, the number of people with multiple sexual partners did decrease, but this was more pronounced among men. So perhaps for men, the number declined, but for women, it remained the same. That would correspond to option A: declined for men, same for women.

Wait, no, option A says declined for men, same for women. Alternatively, maybe it was the other way. Or maybe both declined.

Alternatively, some sources suggest that the number of sexual partners reported by women didn't change much, while men's did. So the correct answer might be A.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps both men and women's numbers declined. But I'm not sure. If that's the case, option C would be the answer. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the number increased for men but stayed the same for women. But why would that be? I don't think so; the AIDS crisis would have likely caused a decrease, not an increase.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is that the number of unmarried adults reporting multiple partners declined for men but remained the same for women. So option A would be the choice.

The question examines the trend in the number of unmarried heterosexual adults aged 20 to 45 in the US who reported having multiple partners from 1988 to 1990. During this period, the AIDS epidemic heightened awareness of sexual health risks, likely influencing a decline in risky behaviors such as having multiple partners. 

Research suggests that men's reported number of sexual partners decreased during this time, possibly due to increased awareness and safer sex practices. However, women's reported behavior did not change significantly. This pattern aligns with option A: declined for men, and remained the same for women.

Answer: A
