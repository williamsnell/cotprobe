Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question to answer, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about aligning the interests of shareholders and senior management in a company. It says that something is often made available to a certain group to ensure it's in their interest to increase two things: one is performance, and the other is dividend performance. Hmm.

So the blanks are: [something], [group], and [performance aspect]. The options are from A to J.

I remember that in corporate finance, one common method to align management's interests with shareholders is through stock options or share options. The idea is that if managers have a stake in the company's stock, they'll be motivated to make decisions that increase the company's value, which benefits both themselves and the shareholders.

So, the question is asking what's given to whom. The first blank is probably something like share options because that's a common practice. The second blank is likely senior managers because they're the ones making strategic decisions. The third part is about what they're incentivized to increase. Share price makes sense because if the managers have share options, they'd want the share price to rise so their options become more valuable.

Looking at the options, let's go through each:

Option A: Performance bonuses to shareholders to increase market cap. Wait, shareholders are the ones who own the company, but bonuses are usually for employees. So maybe not.

Option B: Non-financial remuneration to the board of directors for employee satisfaction. Doesn't seem right because the focus is on increasing performance, not satisfaction.

Option C: Share options to the board for market cap. Board of directors, but maybe senior managers are more specific.

Option D: Non-financial to all employees for satisfaction. Not related to performance.

Option E: Non-financial to senior managers for satisfaction. Again, not performance.

Option F: Performance bonuses to senior managers for company profit. Bonuses are usually based on performance metrics, but the question mentions aligning interests through something that ties to share price or value.

Option G: Bonuses to all employees for profit. Same as F but broader group.

Option H: Share options to senior managers for share price. This fits because share options would incentivize increasing the share price, which benefits shareholders.

Option I: Share options to all employees for share price. While some companies do this, the question is about senior management specifically aligning with shareholders.

Option J: Share options to shareholders for share price. Shareholders already own shares, so giving them options doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, the question says "made available to [group] of a company." So the group is within the company. Shareholders are outside. So J is out because it's about shareholders, not company insiders.

So between H and C. H says senior managers, C says board of directors. The question refers to "senior management," so H is more accurate.

So the correct answer should be H: Share options, Senior managers, Share Price.

The correct answer is H because share options are often granted to senior managers to align their interests with those of shareholders by incentivizing them to increase the company's share price.

H

Answer: H
