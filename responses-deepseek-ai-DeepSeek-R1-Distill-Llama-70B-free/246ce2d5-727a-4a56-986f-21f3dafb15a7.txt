Okay, so I've got this question here asking which measurement is equal to one square foot. The options are all in square inches, right? Hmm, I need to figure out how many square inches are in a square foot.

Wait, I remember that one foot is 12 inches. So a square foot would be 12 inches by 12 inches. Let me visualize that. So, the area of a square is side length squared. So 12 inches times 12 inches is... 144 square inches. Oh right, because 12*12 is 144. So that's probably the answer.

Let me double-check. One foot equals 12 inches. So a square foot is (12 in)^2. 12 times 12 is definitely 144. So looking at the options, option H is 144 square inches. So the correct answer should be H.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward, but sometimes when you're under pressure, you might second-guess yourself. I'm pretty confident though. Square foot to square inches is 144. Yep, that's it.
