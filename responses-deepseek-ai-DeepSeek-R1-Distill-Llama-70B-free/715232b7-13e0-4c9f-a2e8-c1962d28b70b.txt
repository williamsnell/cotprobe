Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to simplify the fraction by rationalizing the denominator. The given expression is 4 divided by the sum of three square roots: sqrt(108), 2 times sqrt(12), and 2 times sqrt(27). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try breaking it down step by step.

First, I remember that rationalizing the denominator means getting rid of any square roots in the denominator. But wait, in this case, the denominator isn't just a single square root—it's a sum of three terms each involving square roots. So how do I approach this?

Well, I think the first step is to simplify each of those square roots individually. Let me start with sqrt(108). I know that 108 can be broken down into prime factors. Let me see, 108 divided by 2 is 54, then 54 divided by 2 is 27. Oh wait, 27 is 3 cubed, so 108 is 2^2 * 3^3. So sqrt(108) would be sqrt(2^2 * 3^3). Taking the square of 2 out, that's 2 times sqrt(3^2 *3), which is 2*3*sqrt(3) = 6 sqrt(3). Okay, so sqrt(108) simplifies to 6√3.

Next up is 2 sqrt(12). Let's simplify sqrt(12). 12 is 4 * 3, so sqrt(4*3) is 2 sqrt(3). Then, 2 times that would be 2*(2 sqrt(3)) = 4 sqrt(3). So 2 sqrt(12) is 4√3.

Then the last term is 2 sqrt(27). Let me simplify sqrt(27). 27 is 3^3, so sqrt(3^2 *3) is 3 sqrt(3). Multiply that by 2, and we get 2*(3 sqrt(3)) = 6 sqrt(3). So 2 sqrt(27) is 6√3.

Now, putting it all back into the denominator. The denominator was sqrt(108) + 2 sqrt(12) + 2 sqrt(27), which we now know are 6√3, 4√3, and 6√3. Adding those together: 6√3 + 4√3 + 6√3. Let's add the coefficients: 6 + 4 + 6 is 16. So the denominator becomes 16√3.

So the original expression simplifies to 4 divided by 16√3. Let me write that as 4/(16√3). I can reduce the fraction 4/16, which is 1/4. So now the expression is (1/4) divided by √3, or equivalently (1)/(4√3).

But wait, the problem says to rationalize the denominator, which means I need to get rid of the square root in the denominator. The current denominator is 4√3. To rationalize this, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by √3. So:

(1 * √3) / (4√3 * √3) = √3 / (4 * 3) = √3 / 12.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, let me check which one matches this. Option J is √3/12, which would be the correct one. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

Wait a minute, when I added 6√3 + 4√3 + 6√3, that's 6 + 4 + 6 = 16, so 16√3. So 4/(16√3) simplifies to 1/(4√3), then rationalizing gives √3/(4*3) = √3/12. So the answer should be J.

But wait, let me look at the options again. Option F is 4√3/33, which doesn't seem to fit. Option G is 4√3/27, which is not what I have. Option J is √3/12, which matches my result.

So I think the correct answer is J.

To simplify the given fraction by rationalizing the denominator, we start with the expression:

$$\frac{4}{\sqrt{108} + 2\sqrt{12} + 2\sqrt{27}}.$$

First, simplify each square root in the denominator:

1. **Simplify $\sqrt{108}$**:  
   $\sqrt{108} = \sqrt{2^2 \cdot 3^3} = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}$.

2. **Simplify $2\sqrt{12}$**:  
   $\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} = 2\sqrt{3}$, so $2\sqrt{12} = 2 \cdot 2\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3}$.

3. **Simplify $2\sqrt{27}$**:  
   $\sqrt{27} = \sqrt{3^3} = 3\sqrt{3}$, so $2\sqrt{27} = 2 \cdot 3\sqrt{3} = 6\sqrt{3}$.

Substitute these simplified values back into the denominator:

$$\sqrt{108} + 2\sqrt{12} + 2\sqrt{27} = 6\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{3} + 6\sqrt{3} = 16\sqrt{3}.$$

Now the fraction becomes:

$$\frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}}.$$

Simplify the fraction by reducing $4/16$ to $1/4$:

$$\frac{4}{16\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}}.$$

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:

$$\frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4 \cdot 3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}.$$

Thus, the simplified fraction is:

$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}.$$

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}$**.

Answer: J
