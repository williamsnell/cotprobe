Okay, so Maddie is going to ride her bike a total of 56 miles over 7 days. And each day she rides the same number of miles. I need to find out how many miles she rides each day. Hmm, let's see.

Wait, so the total miles are 56, and it's spread over 7 days. Since she rides the same each day, I guess I need to divide the total by the number of days. That makes sense because division would split the total into equal parts.

So, 56 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 times 8 is 56 because 7 times 8 is 56. Oh right, so 56 divided by 7 equals 8. So she rides 8 miles each day.

Looking at the options, option D is 8. So the answer should be D.

The total miles Maddie rides is 56, spread equally over 7 days. Dividing 56 by 7 gives 8 miles per day.
