Question:

A contractor has found through experience that the low bid for a job (excluding his own bid) is a random variable that is uniformly dis-tributed, over the interval ( 3c / 4 , 2c) where c is the contractor's cost estimate (no profit or loss) of the job. If profit is defined as zero if the contractor does not get the job (his bid is greater than the low bid) and as the difference between his bid and the cost estimate c if he gets the job, what should he bid, in terms of c, in order to maximize his expected profit?

Options:

A: k = (7c / 4)
B: k = (3c / 2)
C: k = (3c / 4)
D: k = (c / 3)
E: k = (4c / 3)
F: k = c
G: k = (2c / 3)
H: k = (5c / 4)
I: k = (5c / 3)
J: k = (c / 2)

Okay, so I have this problem here about a contractor trying to figure out what bid to make to maximize his expected profit. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup says that the low bid from other contractors is a uniformly distributed random variable between 3c/4 and 2c. Here, c is the contractor's cost estimate, which means if he gets the job, his profit is his bid (let's call it k) minus c. But if he doesn't get the job, which happens when his bid is higher than the low bid, his profit is zero.

So the goal is to find the optimal bid k that maximizes the expected profit. Hmm, I remember that expected value is like the average outcome if we were to repeat this scenario many times.

Let me think about the probability distribution here. Since the low bid (let's call it L) is uniformly distributed between 3c/4 and 2c, the probability density function (pdf) is constant. The range is from 3c/4 to 2c, so the length of the interval is (2c - 3c/4) = 5c/4. The pdf, f(L), is 1 divided by the range, so 4/(5c), right? Because for a uniform distribution, pdf is 1/(b-a), where a and b are the lower and upper bounds.

Now, the contractor will get the job if his bid k is less than or equal to L. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the low bid is L, then the contractor's bid needs to be less than or equal to L for him to get the job. Because the low bid is the minimum, so if k is lower than that, he's not the lowest. Oh wait no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, if the low bid is L, and the contractor's bid is k, then if k is less than L, he's actually the lower bidder, so he would get the job. Because L is the lowest bid from others. So if the contractor's bid is lower than L, he has the lowest bid and gets the job.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. Let's say the other contractors' bids are such that L is the lowest among them. So if the contractor's bid is k, and if k < L, then he would have a lower bid than all others, thus getting the job. If k >= L, then he doesn't get the job.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because L is the lowest bid from others, so if the contractor's bid is k, he gets the job only if k is less than L. Because if k is lower than L, then his is the lowest bid, so he wins. If k is equal to or higher than L, he doesn't win because someone else has a lower or equal bid.

Wait, no, actually, I think I might have that backwards. Let's think again. Suppose the contractor's bid is k. The other bids are such that the lowest is L. So if k is less than L, then the contractor's bid is lower than the lowest of the others, which would mean he gets the job. If k is equal to or higher than L, someone else has a lower or equal bid, so he doesn't get it. So the probability that he gets the job is the probability that L > k.

Wait, but the distribution of L is from 3c/4 to 2c. So if the contractor's bid k is less than 3c/4, then L is always greater than k, right? Because L starts at 3c/4. So if k is below 3c/4, then the probability that L > k is 1, meaning he always gets the job. But if k is between 3c/4 and 2c, then the probability that L > k is (2c - k)/(2c - 3c/4), because that's the length of the interval where L > k divided by the total length.

Wait, let me make sure. The L is in [3c/4, 2c]. So for a given k, if k < 3c/4, then L is always greater than k, so P(L > k) = 1. If k is between 3c/4 and 2c, then P(L > k) is (2c - k)/(5c/4) because the total range is 5c/4. So the probability that he gets the job is (2c - k)/(5c/4) when 3c/4 <= k <= 2c.

Now, the expected profit E is the probability of getting the job multiplied by the profit when he gets it. The profit when he gets the job is k - c. So E = P(L > k) * (k - c).

So when k < 3c/4, E = 1*(k - c) = k - c. But wait, if k is less than 3c/4, then the profit is k - c, which would be negative because k < c. So that's not good because we want to maximize expected profit, and if k is below c, he could have negative expected profit. So probably the optimal k is somewhere above c, but let's see.

Wait, but let me correct that. No, the profit is zero if he doesn't get the job, and (k - c) if he does. So when k is less than 3c/4, he always gets the job, so his expected profit is (k - c)*1 = k - c. But if k is less than c, this would be negative, which is bad, so he would probably not choose a k below c. So let's focus on k >= c.

Wait, but in reality, k should be greater than c because otherwise he would be making a loss. So maybe we can consider k >= c.

So for k >= 3c/4, the expected profit E is:

If 3c/4 <= k <= 2c:

E = P(L > k) * (k - c) = [(2c - k) / (5c/4)] * (k - c)

Simplify that:

(2c - k) / (5c/4) = (4(2c - k))/(5c) = (8c - 4k)/(5c)

So E = (8c -4k)/(5c) * (k - c) = [ (8c -4k)(k - c) ] / (5c)

Let me compute the numerator: (8c -4k)(k - c) = 8c(k - c) -4k(k - c) = 8ck -8c² -4k² +4ck = (8ck +4ck) = 12ck -8c² -4k² = 12ck -8c² -4k².

So E = (12ck -8c² -4k²)/(5c) = [ -4k² +12ck -8c² ] / (5c )

We can factor out a -4 to make it easier: -4(k² -3ck + 2c²)/(5c).

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the derivative of E with respect to k to find the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps expand E:

E(k) = [ (2c -k) / (5c/4) ) ] * (k - c )

Wait, alternatively, let me compute E correctly.

Wait, I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me redo that.

(8c -4k)(k -c) = 8c * k -8c *c -4k *k +4k *c = 8ck -8c² -4k² +4ck = (8ck +4ck) =12ck -8c² -4k².

So E = (12ck -8c² -4k²)/(5c)

Let me write this as:

E = (-4k² +12ck -8c²)/(5c) 

Alternatively, factor numerator:

= (-4k² +12ck -8c²)/(5c)

Let me write this as:

E(k) = [ -4k² + 12c k -8c² ] / (5c )

We can factor out a -4:

= [ -4(k² -3c k + 2c²) ] / (5c )

But maybe it's better to find the derivative.

Let me instead write E(k) as:

E(k) = [(2c -k) * (k - c)] * (4)/(5c)

Because (2c -k)/(5c/4) is (2c -k)*4/(5c)

So E(k) = (2c -k)(k -c) * (4)/(5c)

Let me expand (2c -k)(k -c):

= 2c(k - c) -k(k -c) = 2ck -2c² -k² +ck = 3ck -2c² -k²

So E(k) = (3ck -2c² -k²) * (4)/(5c) 

= [4/(5c)] * ( -k² +3c k -2c² )

Now, to find the maximum, take the derivative of E(k) with respect to k and set it to zero.

dE/dk = [4/(5c)] * ( -2k + 3c )

Set dE/dk =0:

-2k +3c =0 → 3c =2k → k= (3c)/2

Wait, that's 3c/2, which is 1.5c. But wait, let me make sure. Because the range of k we're considering is from 3c/4 to 2c. 3c/2 is 1.5c, which is within that range. So that's a critical point.

Now, we should check if this is a maximum. The second derivative would be [4/(5c)]*(-2) which is negative, so it's a maximum.

So the optimal bid is k=3c/2.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

So the expected profit E is:

For k between 3c/4 and 2c,

E(k) = [(2c -k)/(5c/4)] * (k - c) 

= [4(2c -k)/(5c)] * (k -c)

= [ (8c -4k) / (5c) ] * (k -c )

Expanding numerator:

(8c -4k)(k -c) = 8c*k -8c*c -4k*k +4k*c = 8ck -8c² -4k² +4ck = 12ck -8c² -4k²

So E(k) = (12ck -8c² -4k²)/(5c)

= ( -4k² +12ck -8c² )/(5c )

Taking derivative:

dE/dk = [ (-8k +12c ) ] / (5c )

Set to zero: (-8k +12c )=0 → 8k=12c → k= (12c)/(8) = (3c/2)

Yes, that's correct. So k=3c/2, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure about the boundaries. What if the maximum occurs at a boundary? Let's check E at k=3c/4 and k=2c.

At k=3c/4:

E(k) = [ (2c - 3c/4) / (5c/4) ] * (3c/4 -c )

= [ (5c/4) / (5c/4) ) ] * (-c/4 )

= (1) * (-c/4) = -c/4

That's negative, so not the maximum.

At k=2c:

E(k) = [ (2c -2c) / (5c/4) ] * (2c -c ) = 0 * c = 0

So at k=3c/2, we have a maximum.

Thus, the optimal bid is k=3c/2, which is option B.

The contractor's goal is to determine the optimal bid \( k \) that maximizes his expected profit. The low bid \( L \) from other contractors is uniformly distributed over the interval \((3c/4, 2c)\), where \( c \) is the contractor's cost estimate. The profit is defined as \( k - c \) if the contractor gets the job (i.e., \( k < L \)) and zero otherwise.

### Key Steps:
1. **Probability of Winning the Job**:  
   The probability that the contractor gets the job is \( P(L > k) \). Since \( L \) is uniformly distributed, the probability density function (pdf) is constant and given by:  
   \[
   f(L) = \frac{1}{2c - 3c/4} = \frac{4}{5c}.
   \]  
   For \( 3c/4 \leq k \leq 2c \), the probability that \( L > k \) is:  
   \[
   P(L > k) = \frac{2c - k}{5c/4} = \frac{4(2c - k)}{5c}.
   \]

2. **Expected Profit**:  
   The expected profit \( E(k) \) is the product of the probability of winning and the profit when the job is won:  
   \[
   E(k) = P(L > k) \cdot (k - c) = \frac{4(2c - k)}{5c} \cdot (k - c).
   \]  
   Expanding the numerator:  
   \[
   E(k) = \frac{(8c - 4k)(k - c)}{5c} = \frac{-4k^2 + 12ck - 8c^2}{5c}.
   \]

3. **Maximizing Expected Profit**:  
   To find the optimal \( k \), take the derivative of \( E(k) \) with respect to \( k \) and set it to zero:  
   \[
   \frac{dE}{dk} = \frac{-8k + 12c}{5c}.
   \]  
   Setting \( \frac{dE}{dk} = 0 \):  
   \[
   -8k + 12c = 0 \implies k = \frac{12c}{8} = \frac{3c}{2}.
   \]  
   This critical point \( k = 3c/2 \) is within the interval \((3c/4, 2c)\), and the second derivative confirms it is a maximum.

4. **Boundary Checks**:  
   - At \( k = 3c/4 \):  
     \[
     E(k) = \frac{-4(3c/4)^2 + 12c(3c/4) - 8c^2}{5c} = -\frac{c}{4}.
     \]  
     This is negative, so it is not the maximum.  
   - At \( k = 2c \):  
     \[
     E(k) = \frac{-4(2c)^2 + 12c(2c) - 8c^2}{5c} = 0.
     \]  
     This is also not the maximum.

Thus, the optimal bid that maximizes the expected profit is \( k = 3c/2 \).
