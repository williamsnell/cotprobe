Okay, so I have this question about Piaget’s theory and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the stages of cognitive development according to Piaget. I remember that Piaget proposed a theory where children go through different stages as they develop cognitively. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I'll try to recall.

From what I learned, Piaget's stages are divided into four main parts. The first is the sensorimotor stage, which is from birth to about 2 years old. Then comes the preoperational stage, around 2 to 7 years. Next is the concrete operational stage, roughly 7 to 11 years, and finally the formal operational stage, which starts around 12 and goes into adulthood. 

So looking at the options, the question is about the time span these stages cover. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option.

Option A says during adolescence only. Hmm, no, because Piaget's stages start way earlier, like infancy.

Option B: From birth to late childhood only. Wait, late childhood might be around 11 or so. But the formal operational stage goes into adulthood, so this might not cover the entire span.

Option C: During infancy only. No, because the stages go beyond infancy.

Option D: From birth to early adulthood only. Early adulthood might be up to around 20s? But Piaget's stages go into adulthood, but I think he stopped at formal operational, which starts in adolescence. So does it end in early adulthood or continue? I'm not sure. Maybe the stages don't go beyond that.

Option E: From infancy through adolescence only. That would cover up to maybe 12-18 years. But the formal operational stage starts in adolescence and continues into adulthood, so this might not be the right time span.

Option F: From early childhood to late adulthood. Early childhood is like after infancy, so starting around 2 or 3. But Piaget's stages start at birth, so this might not be correct.

Option G: During early childhood only. No, because the stages go beyond that.

Option H: Throughout the life span. Wait, I thought Piaget didn't go beyond formal operations. Or did he? I'm a bit confused. I think his stages stop at formal operational, which starts in early adolescence. So does that mean the stages don't cover the entire life span? Because some theories, like Erikson's, cover the whole life.

Option I: From adolescence to early adulthood only. No, because the stages start much earlier.

Option J: From birth through late adolescence only. That seems to cover up to maybe 18 or so. But the formal operational stage continues into adulthood, so this might not be entirely correct.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me clarify: Piaget's four stages are:

1. Sensorimotor (0-2)
2. Preoperational (2-7)
3. Concrete operational (7-11)
4. Formal operational (12 and up, into adulthood)

So the stages start at birth and go all the way into adulthood. So the time span is from birth through adulthood. Now looking at the options, which ones cover from birth to at least early adulthood.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: From birth to early adulthood only. So that would cover up to maybe 20s. But Piaget's formal stage is 'adolescence and adulthood', so it's more than just early. Alternatively, option J: from birth through late adolescence. That would end around 18-19, but formal operational starts at 12 and continues.

Wait, there's also option H: throughout the life span. But Piaget's stages end with formal operational in adulthood. He didn't propose stages beyond that, like middle age or old age. So H might not be correct because his theory doesn't cover the entire life span, just up to early adulthood or so.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me think again. The formal operational stage is considered the final stage and it lasts from about 12 onwards. So the stages go from birth to adulthood, but not beyond. So the correct time span would be from birth through early adulthood.

Wait, early adulthood might end around 20-30. But Piaget's formal stage is considered to last into adulthood, not just early. So perhaps the correct option is D: from birth to early adulthood only. Or maybe another option.

Looking at the options, option D says from birth to early adulthood only, which would include the formal operational stage. But I'm not sure if the formal operational stage ends in early adulthood or continues throughout. I think it's the latter.

Alternatively, option J: from birth through late adolescence. That would end around 18-19, which would miss the part where the formal operational stage continues into adulthood.

So the correct time span should be from birth through adulthood. But looking at the options, none of them say 'throughout adulthood' except perhaps H, which says throughout the life span. But I thought H is incorrect because Piaget's stages don't cover all life stages beyond adulthood. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: I remember that Piaget's theory includes four stages, ending with formal operational, which starts in early adolescence and continues into adulthood. So the stages cover from birth until adulthood, but not beyond, say, into old age. So the correct answer would be a time span that starts at birth and ends in early adulthood.

Looking back, option D says from birth to early adulthood. Alternatively, option J is from birth through late adolescence, which would end before the formal operational stage is fully done.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the formal operational stage is part of adulthood. So from birth to early adulthood might not capture the entire formal operational stage.

Wait, no, early adulthood is part of the formal operational stage. So maybe the stages end there. Alternatively, the stages end when the individual reaches formal operational, which is in early adolescence and continues. So the stages are from birth through early adulthood.

Wait, but the question is about the stages described. The stages themselves are four, ending with formal operational, which spans from adolescence into adulthood.

So the time span is from birth (sensorimotor) through to early adulthood (when formal operational is still ongoing). So the correct option would be D: From birth to early adulthood only.

Wait, but option J is from birth through late adolescence. That would end around 18 or 19, whereas early adulthood would be up to, say, 25 or so. So which is more accurate?

I think Piaget's stages go into adulthood, so the correct answer would be D, which includes up to early adulthood.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, throughout the life span. But I don't think that's right because Piaget's stages don't go into old age.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the question is, "Piaget’s theory describes stages of cognitive development ___________." The options are about the time span. Piaget's stages start at birth and go through formal operational, which is into adulthood. So the time span is from birth through adulthood.

Looking at the options, D is "From birth to early adulthood only." But early adulthood is still part of adulthood. So option D would include up to early adulthood, which is part of the formal operational stage. So the stages go from birth through early adulthood, making D the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, but I think H is incorrect because the stages don't cover the entire life span, just up to early adulthood.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J: From birth through late adolescence only. Because late adolescence would be around 18-19, but the formal operational stage starts at 12 and continues into adulthood.

So the stages go beyond late adolescence into early adulthood. So J might not be correct.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the stages again:

1. Sensorimotor: 0-2
2. Preoperational: 2-7
3. Concrete operational: 7-11
4. Formal operational: 12 and beyond (so into adulthood)

So the stages start at birth and go into adulthood. So the time span is from birth to early adulthood and beyond. But looking at the options, none of them say 'throughout adulthood' except H, which says throughout the life span. But H is incorrect because Piaget didn't describe stages beyond formal operational, which is in adulthood.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D: From birth to early adulthood only. Because the formal operational stage begins in early adolescence and continues into early adulthood.

Alternatively, the answer might be J: From birth through late adolescence only. Because the formal operational stage starts at 12, which is early adolescence, and late adolescence is around 18-19. But the stages go beyond that into adulthood.

So I'm a bit torn between D and J. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: I'll look up the stages again. Piaget's stages are:

1. Sensorimotor (Infancy): 0–2 years
2. Preoperational (Early Childhood): 2–7 years
3. Concrete Operational (Late Childhood): 7–11 years
4. Formal Operational (Adolescence and Adulthood): 12 years and up

So the stages cover from birth through adulthood. So the time span is from birth to adulthood. So the correct option would be one that includes from birth through adulthood. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: From birth to early adulthood only. Early adulthood is part of adulthood, but perhaps the stages continue beyond early into middle adulthood. But the formal operational stage is considered to last into adulthood, not just early.

Option H: Throughout the life span. But Piaget's stages end with formal operational in adulthood. He didn't propose stages for middle or late adulthood, so H would be incorrect.

So the correct answer would be the option that starts at birth and goes into early adulthood. Looking at the options, D is from birth to early adulthood.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J: From birth through late adolescence only. But late adolescence would be around 18-19, and the formal operational stage continues beyond that.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is D. So the answer is D.

Wait, wait. I think I made a mistake earlier. The formal operational stage starts at 12 and goes into adulthood. So the stages go from birth (sensorimotor) through to adulthood (formal operational). So the time span is from birth to early adulthood and beyond, but the options don't have an option that says 'throughout adulthood.' The closest would be option H, but H says throughout the life span, which includes old age, which Piaget didn't cover.

So perhaps the correct answer is H: Throughout the life span. But I thought Piaget's stages don't go that far. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

The question is about the stages of cognitive development. The stages are four, covering from birth to adulthood. So the time span is from birth through to early adulthood.

Looking at the options:

Option D: From birth to early adulthood only. That seems to fit.

Option J: From birth through late adolescence only. That would stop at around 18-19, but the formal operational stage continues into adulthood beyond that.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way: the question is about when the stages occur. The stages are from birth (0) until the formal operational stage, which starts at 12 and continues indefinitely. So the stages are present throughout life, but only up to the formal operational stage. So the time span is from birth through adulthood.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes from birth to adulthood is D, but D says 'early adulthood only,' which might not encompass all of adulthood.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: Throughout the life span. But that's not correct because Piaget didn't cover all life stages, just up to formal operational.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm trying to find the best fit. Based on the options, D seems to be the best choice because the stages go from birth to early adulthood, which includes the formal operational stage starting in adolescence.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J: from birth through late adolescence only. But that would exclude the part of the formal operational stage that occurs in early adulthood.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about the names of the stages again. The formal operational stage is the last stage, starting at 12 and continuing into adulthood. So the stages cover from birth (sensorimotor) through to adulthood (formal operational). So the time span is from birth through adulthood.

Looking at the options:

Which options include from birth to some point in adulthood?

Option D: From birth to early adulthood only.

Option H: Throughout the life span.

Option J: From birth through late adolescence only.

So if the stages go into adulthood, then the correct option would be one that includes from birth to at least early adulthood. So D is from birth to early adulthood, which includes the formal operational stage up to that point.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, but I think H is incorrect because Piaget's theory doesn't cover the entire life span, just up to formal operational in adulthood.

So I think the correct answer is D: From birth to early adulthood only.

Piaget’s theory of cognitive development describes four stages that individuals progress through, starting from birth and continuing into adulthood. These stages are:

1. **Sensorimotor (0-2 years)**: Focuses on sensory experiences and motor activities.
2. **Preoperational (2-7 years)**: Involves the development of language and symbolic thinking.
3. **Concrete Operational (7-11 years)**: Emphasizes logical thinking about concrete events.
4. **Formal Operational (12 years and up)**: Involves abstract thinking and logical reasoning, continuing into adulthood.

Given this, the stages span from birth through adulthood. However, Piaget’s theory does not extend into later stages of adulthood, such as middle or late adulthood. Therefore, the time span covered by the stages is from birth to early adulthood.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, G**: These options are incorrect because they limit the stages to specific, shorter periods (e.g., adolescence, infancy, or early childhood only), which is inconsistent with the broader scope of Piaget’s stages.
- **B, E, J**: These options are also incorrect because they stop at late childhood, adolescence, or late adolescence, whereas the formal operational stage extends into adulthood.
- **F**: This option is incorrect because it starts in early childhood, ignoring the sensorimotor stage, which begins at birth.
- **H**: While tempting, this option is incorrect because Piaget’s stages do not cover the entire life span; they stop at the formal operational stage in early adulthood.
- **D**: This is the correct option because it accurately reflects that the stages begin at birth and continue through early adulthood, aligning with the formal operational stage.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: From birth to early adulthood only.**
