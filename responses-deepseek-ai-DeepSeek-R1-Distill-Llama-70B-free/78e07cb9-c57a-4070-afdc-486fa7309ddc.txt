Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about an electric heater. It says that the heater draws 5.0 amps when connected to a 110-volt line. We need to find out how many calories are developed in 1.0 minute. The options are given from A to J, each with different values.

Hmm. So I remember that electric power is related to voltage, current, and resistance. Oh right, the formula is P = V * I, where P is power in watts, V is voltage, and I is current. So first, I can calculate the power.

Wait, but wait. The heater's power would be the product of volts and amps. So 110 volts times 5 amps. Let me do that math: 110 * 5 equals 550 watts. Okay, so the heater uses 550 watts.

But wait, what's a watt? Oh right, a watt is a joule per second. So if the heater is using 550 watts, that's 550 joules every second.

Now, the question is about calories. I remember that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 joules. So I need to convert joules to calories.

The time given is 1.0 minute. Oh, right, I have to convert that to seconds because the power is in watts (which is per second). So 1 minute is 60 seconds.

So the total energy in joules would be power multiplied by time. That's 550 watts * 60 seconds. Let me calculate that: 550 * 60. Hmm, 550 * 6 is 3300, so times 10 is 33,000 joules. So 33,000 joules in a minute.

Now, to convert joules to calories, I divide by 4.184. So 33,000 / 4.184. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 4.184 times 7,900 is approximately 33,000? Let me see: 4.184 * 7,900.

Wait, let me do it step by step. 33,000 divided by 4.184. Let me approximate. 4.184 times 7,000 is 29,288. Hmm, 33,000 minus 29,288 is 3,712. So 7,000 plus 3,712 / 4.184. Let's see how much that is. 3,712 divided by 4.184 is about 887. So total is approximately 7,887 calories, which is about 7.887 × 10^3 calories.

Looking at the options, option E is 7.9 × 10^3 cal. That would be the closest. But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me redo the calculations.

Power P = V * I = 110 V * 5 A = 550 W, correct. Energy in joules is P * t = 550 J/s * 60 s = 33,000 J. Now, calories: 1 cal = 4.184 J.

So calories = 33,000 / 4.184 = let me compute that accurately.

Let me use calculator-like steps. 33000 divided by 4.184.

Let me see: 4.184 goes into 33000 how many times.

Well, 4.184 * 7,000 = 29,288. Remaining: 33000 -29288= 712.

Wait, wait earlier I said 7,000 gives 29,288, but 4.184 * 7,900 is 4.184*(7000+900) = 29,288 + 3,765.6 = 33,053.6. Oh wait, that's close to 33,000.

So 4.184 * 7,900 = 33,053.6, which is a bit over 33,000. So 7,900 would give 33,053.6 J, which is a bit more than our 33,000 J. So how much exactly?

Let me compute 7,900 *4.184. Let's see: 7,000 is 29,288, 900 is 900 *4.184= 3,765.6. So total 29,288 + 3,765.6= 33,053.6 J.

But we have 33,000 J, which is 53.6 less than 33,053.6. So how much less than 7,900?

Each calorie is 4.184 J. So 53.6 J is 53.6 /4.184 ≈ 12.8 calories.

So 7,900 cal is 33,053.6 J, which is 53.6 J more than our 33,000 J. So 7,900 - (53.6 /4.184) ≈ 7,900 -12.8 ≈ 7887.2 calories.

So approximately 7,887 calories, which is 7.887 ×10^3 cal. So looking at the options, the closest is option E: 7.9 ×10^3 cal.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are we using the correct calorie? Oh wait, sometimes the term is kilocalories when people talk about food, but in physics, 1 calorie is 4.184 J. So yes, the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the exact value. Let me compute 33,000 /4.184 more accurately.

Let me compute it as:

33,000 ÷4.184 = ?

Let me see: 4.184 × 7,887 = ?

Wait, let me try 7,887 *4.184.

7,800 *4.184 = 7,800 *4 =31,200; 7,800 *0.184= 1,435.2 → 31,200 +1,435.2=32,635.2.

Then 87 *4.184= 87*4=348; 87*0.184= approx 16.008 → 348+16=364. So 32,635.2 +364= 32,999.2 J.

Which is very close to 33,000 J. So 7,887 cal ≈33,000 J. So 7.887e3 cal.

So the answer should be 7.9e3, which is option E.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option E is 7.9 ×10^3 cal. So that's correct.

To determine how many calories are developed in 1.0 minute by an electric heater that draws 5.0 amps when connected to a 110-volt line, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the power**:  
   The power \( P \) of the heater is given by the formula:  
   \[
   P = V \cdot I
   \]  
   where \( V = 110 \, \text{V} \) and \( I = 5.0 \, \text{A} \).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   P = 110 \cdot 5 = 550 \, \text{W}
   \]  
   Thus, the heater operates at 550 watts.

2. **Convert power to energy in joules**:  
   Power is energy per unit time. Since the heater operates for \( t = 1.0 \, \text{minute} = 60 \, \text{seconds} \), the total energy \( E \) in joules is:  
   \[
   E = P \cdot t = 550 \cdot 60 = 33,000 \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Convert joules to calories**:  
   Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J} \), the energy in calories is:  
   \[
   \text{Calories} = \frac{E}{4.184} = \frac{33,000}{4.184} \approx 7,887 \, \text{cal}
   \]  
   This can be approximated as \( 7.9 \times 10^3 \, \text{cal} \).

4. **Match the closest option**:  
   Among the given options, the closest value is \( 7.9 \times 10^3 \, \text{cal} \), which corresponds to **option E**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: \( 7.9 \times 10^3 \, \text{cal} \)**
