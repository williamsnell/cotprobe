Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the resistance of a hollow carbon cylinder. Hmm, I remember that resistance has something to do with resistivity and the geometry of the material. Let me think about the formula. Oh right, the resistance R is given by R = ρ * (L/A), where ρ is the resistivity, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area.

Wait, but wait. This is a hollow cylinder, so the cross-sectional area isn't just a simple circle. Oh right, it's the area between the inner and outer radii. So the area A should be the area of the outer circle minus the inner circle. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², so A = π(R_o² - R_i²). 

Let me jot down the given values. The inner radius R_i is 0.2 mm, and the outer R_o is 0.3 mm. Oh wait, I need to convert these to meters because the resistivity is given in ohm-meters. So 0.2 mm is 0.2e-3 meters, same for 0.3 mm. 

The length L is 0.9 mm, which is 0.9e-3 meters. And the resistivity ρ is 3.5e-5 ohm·m.

So plugging into the area formula: A = π*( (0.3e-3)^2 - (0.2e-3)^2 ). Let me calculate that. Let's compute each part step by step.

Calculating (0.3e-3)^2: 0.3 squared is 0.09, multiplied by (1e-3)^2 is 1e-6. So that's 0.09e-6 m². Similarly, (0.2e-3)^2 is 0.04e-6 m². Subtracting, we get 0.05e-6 m². So A is π times 0.05e-6. Let me compute that. 0.05e-6 is 5e-8. Multiply by π gives approximately 1.57e-7 m². 

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. 0.3e-3 is 3e-4 m, squared is 9e-8 m². 0.2e-3 is 2e-4 m, squared is 4e-8 m². The difference is (9-4)=5e-8 m². Oh wait, I think I messed up the exponents earlier. So 5e-8 multiplied by π is approximately 1.5708e-7 m².

Now the formula R = ρ * L / A. Let's plug in the numbers. ρ is 3.5e-5, L is 0.9e-3 m. So ρ*L is 3.5e-5 * 0.9e-3 = let's compute that. 3.5 *0.9 is 3.15, and the exponents are e-5 * e-3 = e-8. So 3.15e-8.

Then divide by A, which is 1.57e-7. So R = (3.15e-8) / (1.57e-7). Let me compute that. 3.15e-8 divided by 1.57e-7 is approximately 0.2, because 1.57e-7 is about twice 3.15e-8. Wait, 3.15e-8 divided by 1.57e-7 = (3.15 / 15.7) * (1e-8 / 1e-7) )= 0.2 * 0.1=0.02? Wait that can't be right. Wait wait, let me calculate it accurately.

Wait, 3.15e-8 divided by 1.57e-7 is the same as (3.15 / 15.7) ) * (1e-8 / 1e-7) )? No, wait, 1e-8 / 1e-7 is 0.1. So 3.15 / 15.7 is approximately 0.2. So 0.2 * 0.1 is 0.02. But that would give R as 0.02 ohms. But looking at the options, the choices are all around 1 to 5. So something's wrong here. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I messed up the area. Let me recalculate the area. R_i is 0.2 mm = 0.2e-3 m, R_o 0.3e-3 m. So the area is π*(Ro² - Ri²) = π*( (0.3e-3)^2 - (0.2e-3)^2 ). So 0.3e-3 squared is 0.09e-6, 0.2e-3 squared is 0.04e-6. Subtracting gives 0.05e-6 m². Which is 5e-8 m². Multiply by π: approximately 1.5708e-7 m².

So the area is correct. Then R = ρL/(A). R is 3.5e-5 ohm·m * 0.9e-3 m divided by 1.57e-7 m².

Compute numerator: 3.5e-5 * 0.9e-3. 3.5 * 0.9 is 3.15. 1e-5 * 1e-3 is 1e-8. So numerator is 3.15e-8.

Denominator is 1.57e-7. So 3.15e-8 / 1.57e-7 = (3.15 / 1.57) ) * (1e-8 / 1e-7) ) → (2) * (0.1) )= 0.2. So R is 0.2 ohms? But the options are in the range of 1 to 5. Hmm, none of the options match 0.2. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait a second. The question is asking for the resistance in ohm·meters. Oh no! Wait, no. Let me re-read the question. Oh wait, no, the question says 'What is the resistance in Ω·m?' Wait, that's strange. Because resistance is in ohms, Ω. Unless it's resistivity? No, the question says, the resistor's resistance. So maybe the question is asking for resistivity? No, no. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: "What is the resistance in Ω·m?" That doesn't make sense. Because resistance is in ohms. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's asking for resistivity, but no, the resistivity is given. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the area.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponents. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let me compute the area again. (R_o^2 - R_i^2) = (0.3e-3)^2 - (0.2e-3)^2 = (9e-8) - (4e-8) = 5e-8 m². So area A = π *5e-8 ≈ 1.57e-7 m². Correct.

Now, ρ is 3.5e-5 Ω·m. L is 0.9e-3 m.

So R = (3.5e-5) * (0.9e-3) / (1.57e-7).

Compute numerator: 3.5e-5 * 0.9e-3 = (3.5 * 0.9) * 1e-8 = 3.15e-8.

Denominator: 1.57e-7.

So 3.15e-8 / 1.57e-7 = (3.15 / 1.57) ) * (1e-8 / 1e-7) ) → 2 * 0.1 → 0.2 ohms. But the options don't have 0.2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the length. Wait, the length is given as 0.9 mm which is 0.9e-3 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should express the answer in terms of ohms per meter? No, the question is asking for the resistance in ohm·meters, which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo and they meant ohms. Because if so, then the 0.2 ohms would be the answer, but none of the options match.

Wait, looking back at the options: the options are A-J, with values like 4.0, 3.0, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, R = ρ L / A.

Wait, let me compute everything in base units without exponents.

R_i = 0.2 mm = 0.2e-3 m = 2e-4 m.

R_o = 0.3e-3 m =3e-4 m.

A= π*( (3e-4)^2 - (2e-4)^2 ) = π*(9e-8 -4e-8) = π*(5e-8) = 5e-8 * π ≈ 1.5708e-7 m².

ρ = 3.5e-5 ohm·m.

L=0.9e-3 m.

So R= (3.5e-5) * (0.9e-3) / (1.5708e-7 )

Compute numerator: 3.5e-5 *0.9e-3 = 3.15e-8.

Denominator:1.5708e-7.

So 3.15e-8 / 1.5708e-7 = (3.15 / 15.708) ) → wait, no:

Wait, 1e-8 /1e-7 is 0.1. So 3.15e-8 / 1.57e-7 = (3.15 / 1.57) * (1e-8 / 1e-7) → 2 * 0.1 = 0.2.

So R = 0.2 ohms.

But the options don't have 0.2. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the area?

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have used the formula for the resistance of a hollow cylinder correctly. Wait, the formula is R = ρ * (L) / (A), where A is the cross-sectional area. That part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me compute (R_o^2 - R_i^2) again.

(0.3e-3)^2 = 0.09e-6 m². (0.2e-3)^2 =0.04e-6 m². The difference is 0.05e-6 m², which is 5e-8 m². Multiply by π gives 1.5708e-7 m². So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe the question is asking for the resistivity, but that's given. Alternatively, perhaps the question is in ohms per meter? No, because the length is given and the resistivity is in ohm·meters.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the resistivity instead? No, the problem gives the resistivity, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponents when calculating the area. Let me recheck:

(0.3e-3)^2 = (3e-4)^2 =9e-8 m².

(0.2e-3)^2= (2e-4)^2 =4e-8 m².

Subtracting gives 5e-8 m². Multiply by π to get A= ~1.57e-7 m². Correct.

So R = 3.5e-5 * 0.9e-3 / 1.57e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this in a different way.

Compute numerator: 3.5e-5 * 0.9e-3 = (3.5 * 0.9) * 1e-8 = 3.15e-8.

Denominator:1.57e-7 → 1.57e-7 = 15.7e-8.

So 3.15e-8 /15.7e-8 = 3.15 / 15.7 ≈ 0.2.

So R≈0.2 ohms. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, maybe the formula uses outer radius only? No, because it's a hollow cylinder, so the area is the annular area. So that was correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I confused radius and diameter. Because sometimes problems give diameter instead of radius. Let me check the problem statement. No, the problem says inner radius 0.2 mm, outer 0.3 mm, so that's correct.

Hmm. Let me think of the possible options again. The options given are from 1.0 to 5.0, in increments of 0.5 or 0.2. So 0.2 isn't there. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Let me compute the area using the formula again.

A = π*(R_o² - R_i²) = π*( (0.3e-3)^2 - (0.2e-3)^2 ) = π*(0.09e-6 - 0.04e-6) = π*(0.05e-6) = 0.05e-6 * π m².

0.05e-6 is 5e-8. So 5e-8 * π ≈ 1.5708e-7 m². Correct.

Now, R = (3.5e-5 ohm·m) * (0.9e-3 m) / (1.5708e-7 m²) = (3.5e-5 * 0.9e-3) / 1.5708e-7.

Calculate numerator: 3.5e-5 *0.9e-3 = 3.5 *0.9 = 3.15 and exponents 1e-5 *1e-3 =1e-8 →3.15e-8.

So 3.15e-8 / 1.5708e-7 → let me compute this division.

3.15e-8 / 1.5708e-7 = (3.15 / 15.708) × (1e-8 /1e-7) ) → (0.2) × (0.1) → 0.02? Wait, that would make R=0.02 ohms. But that's even smaller. Wait no, wait 1e-8 / 1e-7 is 0.1. So 3.15e-8 is 3.15 ×1e-8, 1.5708e-7 is 15.708 ×1e-8. So 3.15 /15.708 = 0.2. Multiply by 1e-8 /1e-7 =0.1, so 0.2 ×0.1=0.02. Wait no, no, that's not right. Wait 3.15e-8 divided by 1.57e-7 = (3.15 / 1.57) * (1e-8 /1e-7) ) → 3.15/1.57 ≈2, and (1e-8/1e-7) = 0.1. So 2 *0.1=0.2.

So R≈0.2Ω. But options don't have this. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the resistivity is given in a different unit. Wait, the resistivity is 3.5e-5 ohm·m. Let me double-check that. Yes, the problem states that.

Wait another thought: perhaps the formula should have used the area as π(R_o² + R_i²) or something else. No, that's not right. The area of a hollow cylinder is the area of the outer circle minus the inner circle, so the annular area.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the length in meters, but I did that. 0.9 mm is 0.0009 m, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula. Oh wait, no. R = ρ L / A is correct. Because resistance is proportional to length and inversely proportional to area.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for resistivity, but no, the question already gives the resistivity. So I'm confused. None of the options match my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me compute it using exact numbers without approximations.

Compute A: π*( (0.3e-3)^2 - (0.2e-3)^2 )

= π*(0.09e-6 - 0.04e-6) = π * 0.05e-6 = 0.05e-6 * π = 5e-8 * π.

So A =5e-8 * π m².

Now, R = (3.5e-5) * (0.9e-3) / (5e-8 * π )

Compute numerator: 3.5e-5 *0.9e-3 =3.15e-8.

Denominator:5e-8 * π ≈5e-8 *3.1416 ≈1.5708e-7.

So R=3.15e-8 / 1.5708e-7 → let me compute this as 3.15 /15.708.

3.15 /15.708 is about 0.2.

So again, R≈0.2Ω.

But the options are all higher. So perhaps the question intended something else. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the exponent in resistivity. Let me check:

Resistivity ρ=3.5e-5 ohm·m → yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question was miswritten, and they gave the resistivity in ohm·meter instead
