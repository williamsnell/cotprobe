Question:

In a secluded county, where prejudice festers and discrimination flourishes, there is a lovely lake, which the county has developed and maintained for recreational purposes. Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership "standards," as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: The plaintiff will prevail, because the company is in violation of the county's approved bylaws.
B: The plaintiff will prevail if she can prove the company's policy is based on gender discrimination.
C: The plaintiff will prevail, because the company's policy is discriminatory and violates her civil rights.
D: The plaintiff will lose, because she can use other facilities within the county.
E: The plaintiff will lose, because the company is a private entity and not subject to equal protection laws.
F: The plaintiff will lose, because the company has the right to set its own membership criteria.
G: The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.
H: The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.
I: The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the scenario is about a county that leased part of a lake and surrounding land to a company. The company built a yacht club with a restaurant, bar, and marina. The bylaws they set up, which the county approved, make the club members-only. The membership committee sets high fees and only approves men, rejecting all women. A woman sued, saying she was denied membership because of her gender, violating equal protection.

The question is about whether she'll win or lose, and which option is correct.

I remember that in the US, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment applies to state and local governments, not private entities, unless there's a sufficient state action or nexus. So if the company is private, they might not be directly subject to equal protection laws unless the government is involved.

In this case, the county leased the land and approved the bylaws. Does that mean there's enough state action? Or is the company still considered private?

Wait, there's a case called Moose Lodge v. Irvis, I think, where the Supreme Court said that a private club's discrimination doesn't violate the Constitution because there's no state action, even if the club has a liquor license from the state. So the state's granting a license isn't enough to create state action.

So here, the company is private. The county leasing the land and approving bylaws might not be enough to constitute state action. Unless the county is so involved that it's considered joint action.

But wait, the bylaws were reviewed and approved by the county. So does that make their membership policies a form of state action? Or is the county just a lessor and not actively enforcing the policies.

I think the key is whether the county's actions are so entwined with the private company's policies that it becomes state action. If the county approved the bylaws, maybe that's enough. But I'm not sure.

Another angle is whether the facilities are public accommodations. The Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on race, religion, etc., but I think it doesn't cover gender. Unless a state law does.

Wait, but the question is about equal protection under the Constitution, not statute. So if the company is a private entity without state action, the plaintiff can't win on 14th Amendment grounds.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the company is private and not subject to equal protection. But if there's state action, then E would be wrong.

Option G says classifications based on sex haven't been held to violate equal protection. But in cases like Craig v. Boren, the Supreme Court held that sex-based laws require intermediate scrutiny, so they can be invalid. So G is incorrect because sex can violate equal protection.

Option H says the plaintiff will prevail unless the company shows an important basis. That sounds like intermediate scrutiny. But if the company is private, then it doesn't matter.

Options B and C suggest the plaintiff can win based on discrimination. But if it's a private club, maybe she can't.

Option D and I say she loses because other facilities are available. That's the "separate but equal" argument, but I don't think that's the main issue here.

Option F says the company can set its own membership. That's true if it's private, but if there's state action, then no.

So, putting it together: if the company is private and there's no state action, then the plaintiff loses because the company can set its own rules. But if the county's actions make it state action, then she might win.

In the Moose Lodge case, the court found that the state issuing a liquor license didn't create state action. So even if the county approved the bylaws, unless they are actively involved in the discrimination, it's not state action.

Thus, the company is private, so the plaintiff loses. So looking at the options, E says the company is private and not subject to equal protection. But wait, the question is about the 14th Amendment, which applies to state actors.

Wait, but the county is a state actor. Did they delegate their power in a way that makes the company's action a state action?

In the case of a leased public facility, does that create state action? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But I think if the county approves the bylaws but doesn't enforce the discrimination themselves, it's not enough. The company's policies would still be private.

So the answer would be E: the company is a private entity not subject to equal protection. But wait, E says that, but what if the county's involvement makes it state action?

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B: she wins if she proves gender discrimination. But if the company is private, then she can't win on equal protection grounds.

Wait, but the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits sex discrimination in public accommodations. Does a private club count as a public accommodation? I think public accommodations are places open to the public, but private clubs are exceptions if they're not open to the public. Since the club is members-only, maybe it's not a public accommodation under Title II.

So if she can't use the Civil Rights Act, and if it's not a state action, then she can't win on the 14th Amendment. So she loses.

Looking at the options again, E says the company is private and not subject to equal protection. So that's correct.

Wait, but option B is about proving gender discrimination. If the company is private, then proving discrimination wouldn't matter in terms of constitutional violation. Unless there's a state law, but the question is about equal protection rights, which would be under the Constitution.

So the correct answer would be E. But wait, another thought: if the county approved the bylaws, maybe there's enough state action. Then the company's policy would be subject to equal protection. So then the plaintiff could win.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think of a similar case. In the Moose Lodge case, the Court said that a private club's racial discrimination didn't violate equal protection because the state's issuance of a liquor license wasn't enough to create state action. So even though the state granted the license, the club's policies were private.

In this case, the county leased the land and approved the bylaws, which included the membership criteria. So perhaps that's more involvement than just a liquor license.

Wait, the bylaws were reviewed and approved by the county. So the county is actively involved in setting the membership standards. That could be seen as state action, making the company's policies subject to equal protection.

If that's the case, then the company's gender discrimination would be a state action, and the plaintiff could win. So then option B or H would be possible.

Option B says she'll prevail if she can prove gender discrimination. Option H says she'll win unless the company has an important basis.

In equal protection cases, for gender, the law requires that the classification serve an important government interest and be substantially related to achieving that interest. So the state would need a strong reason.

If the county approved the bylaws allowing gender discrimination, then the state would have to show an important reason, which they likely can't. So the plaintiff would win unless the company can show an important basis, which is option H.

But wait, the question is whether the company's policy violates her equal protection rights. If the county's approval makes it state action, then yes. So option H would be correct.

Wait, but I'm not sure if approving the bylaws constitutes state action. Maybe the court would find that the county's involvement wasn't sufficient. It's a bit of a toss-up.

Alternatively, if it's not state action, the plaintiff loses, so E would be correct.

I'm a bit stuck. Another approach: looking at the options.

Option G says sex hasn't been held to violate equal protection. But that's wrong because in cases like United States v. Virginia (VMI), sex discrimination was found unconstitutional.

So G is incorrect.

Option B: she'll win if she proves gender discrimination. If the company is a state actor, then yes. But if not, then no.

Option E: company is private, so no. But if it's state action, E is wrong.

I think the correct answer is H, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it might be B.

Wait, another angle: the company's facilities are on county land. Does that create a public forum? If so, then the county's lease might impose some restrictions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the lake is a public place, but the club is private. So maybe the county's lease doesn't make the club a state actor.

I think the best answer is E: the company is private, so she loses. But I'm not entirely confident.

The question revolves around whether a woman's denial of membership to a private yacht club, based on its gender-exclusive policy, violates her equal protection rights under the Constitution. The club operates on leased county land, with bylaws approved by the county. The key issue is whether the county's involvement constitutes "state action," making the club's policies subject to constitutional scrutiny.

The Equal Protection Clause applies to state actors, not private entities, unless there is sufficient state action. In *Moose Lodge v. Irvis*, the Supreme Court held that a private club's discriminatory policies do not violate the Constitution, even if the state issues a liquor license, as this does not create state action. Similarly, here, the county's approval of the bylaws and lease of public land may not be enough to establish state action unless the county is actively involved in the discriminatory policy.

If the company is deemed a private entity, it can set its own membership criteria, and the plaintiff cannot prevail under the 14th Amendment. However, if the county's approval of the bylaws is interpreted as significant involvement, it could constitute state action, making the club's gender-based exclusion subject to equal protection analysis. Under such scrutiny, gender-based classifications require intermediate scrutiny, meaning the exclusion must serve an important government interest and be substantially related to achieving it—a threshold the club is unlikely to meet.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, F, I**: These options are incorrect because they either misstate the legal standards or ignore the critical issue of state action.
- **E**: Correct if the company is deemed a private entity with no state action, as the plaintiff cannot challenge the policy under the 14th Amendment.
- **G**: Incorrect, as sex-based classifications can violate equal protection under intermediate scrutiny.
- **B**: Correct if state action is found, as proving gender discrimination would likely lead to a violation.
- **H**: Correct if state action is found, as the plaintiff would prevail unless the company can justify the exclusion under intermediate scrutiny.

Given the similarity to *Moose Lodge*, where state action was not found, the most likely conclusion is that the company is a private entity, and the plaintiff loses. Therefore, **E** is the best answer.

**Answer: E**
