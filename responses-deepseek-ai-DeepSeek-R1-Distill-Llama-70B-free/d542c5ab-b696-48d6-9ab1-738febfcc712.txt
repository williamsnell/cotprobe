Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the mean, median, and mode from a set of measurements. The numbers given are 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, and 9. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through each step.

First, the mean. I remember that the mean is the average of all the numbers. So I should add them all up and then divide by how many there are. Let's see, adding them: 3 + 5 is 8, plus 6 makes 14, another 6 brings it to 20, then 7 is 27, and finally 9 adds up to 36. There are six numbers in total. So 36 divided by 6 is 6. So the mean must be 6.

Next, the median. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. They are already ordered here: 3,5,6,6,7,9. Since there are six numbers, which is even, the median is the average of the third and fourth numbers. The third number is 6, the fourth is also 6. So (6 + 6)/2 equals 6. So the median is 6.

Now the mode. Mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the list: 3 appears once, 5 once, 6 twice, 7 once, 9 once. So 6 is the only number that repeats. Therefore, the mode is 6.

Putting it all together, the mean is 6, median is 6, and mode is 6. Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches these values.

Let me scan through the options:

Option A: Mean 5.5, median 5.5, mode 3. No, that's wrong on all counts.

Option B: Mean 6, median 7, mode 5. Mean is right but median and mode are wrong.

Option C: Mean 6, median 5.5, mode none. Median is wrong, and mode is incorrect because 6 is the mode.

Option D: Mean 6, median 6, mode 6. That's exactly what I got. 

Wait, let me check the other options just in case. Option E: Mean 5.5, nope. Option F: Mean 7, no. Option G: Mean 5, no. H: Mean 6.5, no. I: Mean 7, no. J: Mean 6, median 6.5, mode 3. No, that's not right.

So the correct answer should be option D.

The mean is calculated as 6, the median is 6, and the mode is 6. Comparing these values to the options, the correct choice is:

D: Mean: 6, Median: 6, Mode: 6.

Answer: D
