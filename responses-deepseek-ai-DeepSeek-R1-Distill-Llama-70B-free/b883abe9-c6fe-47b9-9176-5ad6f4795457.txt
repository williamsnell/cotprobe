Question:

Although all electrons spin, only molecules containing unpairedelectrons - only free radicals - giveesrspectra. Why is this? (Hint: Consider the possibility (a)thatone electron of a pair has its spin reversed, or (b)thatboth electrons of a pair have their spins reversed.)

Options:

A: Electron pairs have a net magnetic moment
B: Only electrons in the outermost shell contribute to the magnetic moment, regardless of pairing
C: Each electron of a pair has a unique magnetic moment
D: Free radicals lack electron pairs, which is why they cannot generate a magnetic moment
E: Electron pairs always spin in the same direction, enhancing the magnetic moment
F: Electron pairs generate a magnetic moment of the same magnitude
G: Electron pairs have spins that cancel only in the presence of an external magnetic field
H: Each electron of an electron pair generates a magnetic moment but of equal and opposite magnitude; the electron pair therefore has no net magnetic moment.
I: Electron pairs generate magnetic moments only at high temperatures
J: The magnetic moments of electron pairs reinforce each other, resulting in a double magnetic moment

Okay, so I've got this question about why only free radicals, which have unpaired electrons, give ESR spectra. The hint says something about the possibility of either one electron's spin being reversed in a pair or both. Hmm, I need to think about electron spin and magnetic moments here.

Wait, I remember that in electron spin resonance (ESR), also known as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), only unpaired electrons show a signal. That's because paired electrons don't contribute to the net magnetic moment. But why is that?

So, each electron has a spin, which is either up or down. When two electrons are paired, they have opposite spins. Oh, right, the Pauli exclusion principle says they can't have the same quantum state, so their spins are opposite. So each pair would have one spin up and one spin down.

Now, each electron's spin generates a magnetic moment. If they're paired, the magnetic moments would point in opposite directions. So their individual moments would cancel each other out. That means the net magnetic moment from the pair is zero.

But if an electron is unpaired, there's no opposite spin to cancel it. So that single electron's magnetic moment contributes to the overall magnetic moment of the molecule. This is why free radicals, which have unpaired electrons, can interact with the magnetic field in ESR spectroscopy.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Electron pairs have a net magnetic moment. Wait, no. If their moments cancel, the net is zero. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Only outermost electrons contribute. I don't think that's the main reason here. It's about pairing, not the shell they're in. So B might not be it.

Option C: Each in a pair has a unique magnetic moment. Unique in what way? They have opposite directions, but same magnitude. So maybe not the reason. Not sure, but let's keep reading.

Option D: Free radicals lack pairs so can't generate a magnetic moment. Wait, no, free radicals do have a magnetic moment because they have unpaired electrons. So D is wrong.

Option E: Pairs spin same direction. No, they spin opposite to each other. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Pairs have same magnitude. Well, yes, but their directions are opposite so they cancel. But F doesn't explain why the net is zero. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option G: Spins cancel only with external field. No, the cancellation is intrinsic due to pairing, not needing an external field. So G is wrong.

Option H: Each has a moment of equal and opposite, so net zero. Yes, that fits what I was thinking. So H looks correct.

Option I: Pairs generate moments only at high temps. No, temperature isn't the main factor here. It's about pairing. So I is wrong.

Option J: Moments reinforce. No, because they are opposite, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H.

The question asks why only molecules with unpaired electrons (free radicals) produce ESR spectra. The key lies in understanding the behavior of electron pairs and their magnetic moments. Each electron has a spin that generates a magnetic moment. In paired electrons, the spins are opposite due to the Pauli exclusion principle, resulting in magnetic moments of equal magnitude but opposite direction. These moments cancel each other out, leaving a net magnetic moment of zero for the pair. Therefore, paired electrons do not contribute to the ESR signal. In contrast, unpaired electrons have no opposing spin to cancel their magnetic moment, allowing them to interact with the external magnetic field and produce an ESR spectrum.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Electron pairs do not have a net magnetic moment because their moments cancel.
- **B**: Incorrect. The contribution to the magnetic moment depends on pairing, not the shell.
- **C**: Incorrect. While paired electrons have magnetic moments, they are not "unique" in a way that explains the cancellation.
- **D**: Incorrect. Free radicals do generate a magnetic moment due to their unpaired electrons.
- **E**: Incorrect. Paired electrons spin in opposite directions, not the same.
- **F**: Incorrect. While paired electrons have moments of the same magnitude, their directions oppose, leading to cancellation.
- **G**: Incorrect. Cancellation occurs inherently due to pairing, not because of an external field.
- **H**: Correct. Paired electrons have equal and opposite magnetic moments, resulting in no net magnetic moment.
- **I**: Incorrect. Magnetic moments from pairs are not temperature-dependent in this context.
- **J**: Incorrect. Paired electrons' moments oppose, so they do not reinforce.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately explains why paired electrons do not contribute to the ESR signal. 

Answer: H
