Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about what happens to equilibrium price and quantity when both demand falls and supply increases. Hmm.

Alright, I remember that in a market, equilibrium is where the supply and demand curves intersect. At that point, the price and quantity are such that the amount producers want to supply equals the amount consumers want to buy.

So, if demand falls, that means the demand curve shifts to the left. Why? Well, at every price point, people are willing to buy less than before. This would naturally lead to a lower equilibrium price because fewer people are buying at each price. But wait, what about the quantity? If demand decreases, I think the equilibrium quantity would also decrease. Because if people aren't buying as much, the quantity sold would drop.

But then, the supply is increasing. So the supply curve shifts to the right. At every price point, producers are willing to supply more. Increased supply would tend to lower the price as well, because more goods are available. But the effect on quantity? I think when supply increases, the equilibrium quantity would increase. Because more is being supplied, so more is sold.

Wait, so now I have two opposing effects on quantity. On one hand, demand falling tends to decrease quantity. On the other hand, supply increasing tends to increase quantity. So what's the net effect? I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me try to visualize this. Imagine two curves. Before any shifts, they intersect at a certain point (P1, Q1). Now, demand shifts left. If only demand shifted, the new equilibrium would be at a lower P and lower Q. But supply is also shifting right. So the new supply curve is further out, which would cause the equilibrium to move to a point that's lower in price but higher in quantity compared to the original. But since both shifts are happening at the same time, how do these effects balance out?

So, the change in demand (falling) makes the price go down and quantity go down. The change in supply (increasing) makes the price go down but quantity go up. So for price, both shifts push it down. So the equilibrium price will definitely fall. But for quantity, the shifts have opposite effects: one decreases it, the other increases it. So the effect on quantity isn't clear. It depends on how much each curve shifts.

Wait, but the question is about what happens in general. So in terms of the direction, equilibrium price will definitely fall because both shifts cause it to drop. But quantity could go either way depending on the magnitude of the shifts. However, the question is about what we can determine for sure.

So, the price will fall, but the quantity could either increase or decrease, or stay the same, depending on how much demand and supply shift. So we can't be certain about the quantity; it's indeterminate. But the price definitely falls.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one where price is determined to fall, and quantity is indeterminate. Let me read the options again.

Option A says price is indeterminate, quantity falls. No, because I thought price definitely falls.

Option B: Price falls, quantity rises. That's possible only if supply's effect on quantity is stronger than demand's. But the question says both happen, so it's not certain.

Option J: Price falls, quantity is indeterminate. That seems right because we can't tell for sure about quantity.

Wait, let me check the other options. Option H says both fall, but that's only if demand's effect on quantity is stronger. But we don't know that. So H is not correct in general.

So the answer should be J: The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.

When demand falls, the demand curve shifts left, leading to a lower equilibrium price and quantity. When supply increases, the supply curve shifts right, leading to a lower equilibrium price but a higher equilibrium quantity. The combined effect of these shifts results in a definite decrease in the equilibrium price because both changes push the price downward. However, the effect on equilibrium quantity is indeterminate because the decrease in demand tends to lower quantity, while the increase in supply tends to raise it. The net effect on quantity depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts, which are not specified in the question.

Thus, the equilibrium price will fall, but the equilibrium quantity cannot be determined with certainty.

Answer: J
