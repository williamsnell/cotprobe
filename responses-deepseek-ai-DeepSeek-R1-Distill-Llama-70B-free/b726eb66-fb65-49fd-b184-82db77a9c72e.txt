Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about English law and jurisdiction. The question is whether extra-territorial abduction is a ground for refusing jurisdiction in English courts. Hmm, I remember that this relates to how courts handle cases where someone has been brought to the country through irregular means, maybe even illegally.

I think the key here is the concept of "abuse of process." I recall that if someone is abducted from another country and brought to face trial in England, the courts might consider this an abuse. But wait, is that always the case? Or does it depend on other factors?

I remember a case called R v. Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court, ex parte Bennett. In that case, the defendant was abducted from South Africa. The court held that the English court should exercise its discretion to stay the proceedings because the abduction was an abuse of the process of the court. So in that case, the court did stay the proceedings.

But wait, does that mean that whenever there's an extra-territorial abduction, the court will always stay the proceedings? Or is it more nuanced? I think the court has discretion, so it's not automatic. It depends on whether the abduction would make the trial unfair or if it's against the interests of justice.

Looking at the options:

Option A says such abduction constitutes abuse of process and leads to a stay. That's what the Bennett case suggests, but I think it's not the only factor. The court might consider other things, like the seriousness of the crime or the circumstances of the abduction. So maybe A is too absolute.

Option B says it gives rise to liability but doesn't stay the proceedings. That doesn't seem right because in Bennett, the proceedings were stayed. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C says a stay would prevent justice for international criminals. That makes sense because if the court always stays, then criminals might escape prosecution. But in Bennett, the court did stay, so maybe this isn't the right answer either. Or perhaps it's a policy consideration that courts might weigh against the abuse of process.

Option D says courts may stay but will seldom do so. That sounds plausible because the court has discretion and might only stay in clear cases of abuse affecting the fairness of the trial. So maybe D is correct because it's not a hard and fast rule, but rather a possibility that's exercised sparingly.

Wait, but in Bennett, the court did stay the proceedings. So is that the general rule, or was that a specific instance? I think the court's decision in Bennett established that extra-territorial abduction can be a ground for staying the proceedings, but it's discretionary. So the court isn't obliged to stay every time; it depends on the circumstances.

So looking back at the options, D says the courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings. That seems accurate because it's not automatic, but possible in certain cases. So the answer would be D.

The question revolves around whether extra-territorial abduction can lead to English courts refusing jurisdiction. The key issue is whether such an abduction constitutes an abuse of process, potentially resulting in a stay of proceedings. 

In the case of *R v. Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court, ex parte Bennett*, the court held that extra-territorial abduction could amount to an abuse of process, leading to a stay of proceedings. However, this is not an automatic outcome but rather a discretionary decision based on the specific circumstances of the case. The court considers factors such as the fairness of the trial and the interests of justice.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is too absolute, as it suggests that a stay always follows an abduction, which is not the case.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the *Bennett* case demonstrates that a stay is possible.
- **Option C** raises a valid policy concern but does not align with the principle established in *Bennett*.
- **Option D** accurately reflects the discretionary nature of the court's decision, emphasizing that while a stay is possible, it is not commonly granted.

Thus, the correct answer is that courts may stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction but will do so only seldom.

D
