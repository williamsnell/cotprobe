Question:

A defendant is on trial for theft of a used car that he took for a test drive and did not return. He was arrested in the car two days later. In his defense, the defendant has testified that he had no intention of keeping the car but got caught up in marital problems and simply delayed returning it. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant told him, during the two days, "I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife." Is the witness's testimony admissible?

Options:

A: Yes, as it provides context to the defendant's actions.
B: Yes, as a prior consistent statement of the defendant.
C: No, because it is a statement that could potentially influence the jury.
D: Yes, as a statement of the defendant's future intentions.
E: No, because it is irrelevant to the case.
F: Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.
G: No, because it is a self-serving statement by an accused.
H: Yes, as it is evidence of the defendant's character.
I: No, because it is a statement made after the event.
J: No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about whether a witness's testimony is admissible in a theft case. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The defendant is on trial for stealing a used car he took for a test drive but didn't return. He was arrested two days later. His defense is that he didn't intend to keep the car; he just got caught up in marital problems and delayed returning it. He called a witness who testified that the defendant said, "I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife." So the question is whether this testimony is admissible.

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence, specifically hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

The defendant's statement here is being offered to show that he intended to return the car, which would negate the intent to steal. So the issue is whether this statement falls under a hearsay exception.

I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, there are exceptions like present state of mind, which includes the defendant's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. Specifically, FRE 803(3) allows for statements showing the declarant's state of mind, but there's a catch. It can't be used to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it's about the declarant's will.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant is talking about his intention to return the car in the future. So it's about his future intention. FRE 803(3) does allow for statements of intention, but only if they relate to the declarant's future acts and are not being used to prove the fact that the act was performed. However, there's a specific part of the rule that says that statements of intention are admissible only if they relate to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of the declarant's will.

Wait, no, that's when the statement is about the declarant's will. For other statements of intention, I think the rule allows them as an exception to hearsay if they are about the declarant's future acts and not too remote in time.

But wait, another point: the defendant is the declarant here, right? Because the witness is testifying about what the defendant said. So the defendant's own statement is being offered. So when the defendant makes a statement, it's a party admission, right? Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement. So that would make it admissible as a party admission.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant is the one making the statement, and it's being offered by the defendant. So when the defendant offers his own prior statement, is it hearsay? Because the defendant is a party, and the statement is being offered by him, so it's not being offered against him. Wait, no, the rule is that party admissions are exceptions when they're offered against the party. So if the prosecution was offering the defendant's statement against him, it would be a party admission. But here, the defendant is offering his own statement. So it's not a party admission in this context because it's being offered by the party himself, not against.

So maybe it's not covered under 801(d)(2). So then, does it fall under another exception?

Alternatively, the statement could be admissible as a statement of then-existing state of mind under 803(3). Because the defendant was explaining his current state of mind, his intention to return the car because of his marital issues. So the statement reflects his then-existing state of mind, which is relevant to his intent to steal or not.

Wait, but 803(3) says that a statement showing the declarant's then state of mind is admissible, but it cannot be used to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the declarant's will. So in this case, the statement is about his intention to return the car, which is a future action. So it's a statement of intent, which is allowed under 803(3) as an exception.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: under 803(3), statements of intent are admissible if they concern the declarant's future acts and are not too remote. But the key is that they must be statements about the declarant's own future actions, not someone else's. So the defendant's statement about intending to return the car fits because it's about his own future action.

So the witness's testimony about the defendant's statement would be admissible as a statement of the defendant's then-existing state of mind under 803(3). So that would make the testimony admissible, right?

Wait, but another angle: the statement is being offered to prove that he didn't have the intent to steal the car. So it's being offered for the truth of the matter asserted—that he intended to return it, so he didn't steal it. So without a hearsay exception, it's inadmissible. But if it fits under 803(3), then it's admissible.

Alternatively, could it be considered a prior consistent statement? But prior consistent statements are used to rebut charges of recent fabrication, and they require that the declarant testify and be subject to cross-examination. But in this case, the defendant is testifying, so maybe. But wait, the prior consistent statement exception under 801(d)(1)(B) requires that the statement was made before any motive to fabricate arose. Here, the statement was made during the two days he had the car, before he was arrested, so perhaps that's a possible exception. But the primary issue is whether it's hearsay and whether it fits an exception.

Wait, but the defendant is using his own statement. So if the statement is not hearsay because it's a party admission when offered by the opposing party, but when the defendant offers it, it's not an admission against interest. So maybe it's not a party admission in this case.

So going back, the statement is hearsay unless it fits an exception. The possible exceptions are 803(3) as a statement of state of mind, or 801(d)(2) if it's a party admission. Wait, 801(d)(2)(A) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered by a party and was made by the party's own statement. So in this case, the defendant is offering his own statement, so it's not hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A). Wait, no—wait, 801(d)(2) is for statements offered against the party. If the defendant is offering his own statement, it's being offered by the party, not against. So 801(d)(2) wouldn't apply because that's for admissions by a party-opponent.

So then, the statement would be hearsay unless another exception applies, like 803(3). So under 803(3), the statement about his intention to return the car is admissible as a statement of his then-existing state of mind.

Wait, but some people might argue that statements of future intent are self-serving and might not fall under 803(3). Let me think. The rule says that statements showing the declarant's then state of mind, including intent, are admissible, except when they concern a fact remembered or believed. So if the statement is about his intention to return the car, that's about his future conduct, so it's admissible under 803(3). Therefore, the witness's testimony is admissible.

Looking at the options, option F says "Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind." That seems correct because it fits under 803(3).

Alternatively, option B says it's a prior consistent statement, but that requires the declarant to testify and the statement to have been made before a motive to fabricate arose. The defendant is testifying, but I'm not sure if the prior consistent statement applies here because the statement was made during the two days, which is before arrest, so maybe it was before a motive to fabricate. But I'm not sure if that's the primary reason here.

Option D says it's about future intentions, which is true, but under 803(3), that's admissible, so D might be a possible answer. But the key is whether it's hearsay or not. So if it's under 803(3), then D would be correct in terms of content, but the admissibility is based on the exception.

Wait, but the question is whether the testimony is admissible. So if the statement is hearsay, and the only exception is 803(3), then F would be the reason. Alternatively, if D is about future intentions but not tied to an exception, then it might not be the right reason.

Wait, the options are about why it's admissible. So option F says it's admissible as a statement of his then-existing state of mind, which fits 803(3). Option D says it's about future intentions, which is a correct description, but if that's the only reason, without an exception, it would still be hearsay. So the correct reasoning is that it's admissible under 803(3), making F the correct answer.

Another option is J, which says it's hearsay not within any exception. But if it fits 803(3), then J is incorrect.

So I think the correct answer is F.
</think>

The admissibility of the witness's testimony hinges on whether the defendant's statement fits within a hearsay exception. The statement, "I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife," is being offered to show the defendant's intent to return the car, which is relevant to whether he intended to steal it. 

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. Here, the statement qualifies as a statement of the defendant's then-existing state of mind under FRE 803(3). This rule allows for statements showing the declarant's state of mind, including intentions, as long as they are not used to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the declarant's will. The defendant's statement about his intention to return the car reflects his state of mind at the time and is admissible under this exception.

Other options, such as prior consistent statement (Option B) or statements of future intentions (Option D), are less applicable. While the statement does concern future intentions, its admissibility is properly based on the state of mind exception under 803(3). Option J, which argues it is hearsay without an exception, is incorrect because the statement does fit within the 803(3) exception.

Thus, the correct reason for the admissibility of the witness's testimony is that it is a statement of the defendant's then-existing state of mind.
