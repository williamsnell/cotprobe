Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically about what doesn't terminate an offer. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The scenario is a contractor and a homeowner negotiating the price for building a house. The contractor made an offer of $100,000. The question is asking which communication wouldn't terminate the offer, so a later acceptance would still be effective.

Hmm. I remember that offers can be terminated in several ways, like revocation, rejection, counter-offer, lapse of time, or death of the offeror. So I need to go through each option to see which one doesn't terminate the offer.

Option A: Homeowner says they'll build themselves. That sounds like a rejection. Because if they're not going to accept, that would terminate the offer. So A would terminate it, so it's not the answer.

Option B: Contractor says costs went up and wants to renegotiate. Wait, if the offeror (contractor) says they need to renegotiate, that's like revoking the offer, right? So that would terminate the original offer. So B would terminate, not the answer.

Option C: Homeowner asks if contractor would do it for $95k. That sounds like a counter-offer. A counter-offer rejects the original offer and proposes new terms. So that would terminate the original offer. So C is out.

Option D: Homeowner asks about completion time. Oh, that's just a query about terms, not a rejection or counter-offer. So that wouldn't terminate the offer. So D might be the answer.

Wait, let me think again. If someone asks a question about the offer, like when can you finish, that's just seeking information. It doesn't indicate acceptance or rejection. So the offer remains open. So D doesn't terminate the offer.

Option E: Contractor dies, but son continues. I think if the offeror dies, the offer can't be accepted anymore because the contractor is the one who has to perform. Unless the offer was to the estate or someone else, but here the son is taking over, so maybe the offer is still open. Wait, does the death of the offeror terminate the offer? I'm a bit unsure. I think when the offeror dies, the offer is revoked because the person can't perform. Unless the offer is to their estate, but generally, death terminates the offer. So E would terminate, so not the answer.

Option F: Homeowner found another contractor for $90k. That's a rejection, so the offer is terminated. So F is not the answer.

Option G: Homeowner says I accept but change the price to $97k. That's a counter-offer. So the original offer is rejected, and a new offer is made. So G terminates the offer.

Option H: Contractor withdraws the offer. That's a clear revocation, so the offer is terminated. Not the answer.

Option I: Contractor increases offer to $105k before acceptance. That's a revocation of the original offer and a new offer. So the original is terminated, so I is not the answer.

Option J: Contractor's business goes bankrupt. That would likely terminate the offer because they can't perform the contract. So J is out.

So the only one that doesn't terminate the offer is D. Because asking about the time to complete doesn't reject or counter the offer. It's just a question, so the offer remains open.

The question revolves around contract law and which communication does not terminate an offer, allowing a subsequent acceptance to be effective. Offers can be terminated through revocation, rejection, counter-offer, lapse of time, or death of the offeror. Each option is analyzed as follows:

- **A**: The homeowner decides to build themselves. This is a rejection, terminating the offer.
- **B**: The contractor mentions increased costs and wants renegotiation. This revokes the original offer.
- **C**: The homeowner asks if the contractor would accept $95,000. This is a counter-offer, terminating the original offer.
- **D**: The homeowner asks about the completion time. This is merely a query for information and does not terminate the offer.
- **E**: The contractor dies, but the son continues the business. Generally, the offeror's death terminates the offer unless it can be transferred.
- **F**: The homeowner finds another contractor for $90,000. This is a rejection, terminating the offer.
- **G**: The homeowner accepts but changes the price to $97,000. This is a counter-offer, terminating the original offer.
- **H**: The contractor withdraws the offer. This is a clear revocation, terminating the offer.
- **I**: The contractor increases the offer to $105,000. This revokes the original offer and makes a new one.
- **J**: The contractor's business goes bankrupt. This likely terminates the offer due to inability to perform.

The only communication that does not terminate the offer is **D**, as asking about completion time is a neutral inquiry and does not reject or alter the offer.

Answer: D
