Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Atlas and a note he discounted at his bank. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on finance calculations, but I think I can figure this out.

Alright, let's start by reading the question carefully. Mr. Atlas has a note for $45,000, and he discounted it at his bank 120 days before it was due. The bank's discount rate is 6%. I need to find his proceeds, which I think means the amount of money he gets from the bank right away.

Wait, discounting a note... I remember that when you discount a note, you're essentially getting the present value of the note before it's due. The bank gives you less than the face value because they're charging interest for the period before the note matures.

So the formula I think is needed here is for the discount. The discount is calculated as the face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time in years. Then, the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount.

Right, the formula is:

Discount = Face Value × Rate × Time

And Proceeds = Face Value - Discount

But wait, time needs to be in years. The note was discounted 120 days before it was due. So that's 120 days. I need to convert that into years. Since there are 360 days in a year for these kinds of calculations, right? Because banks often use a 360-day year for simple interest calculations.

So Time = 120 / 360 = 1/3 of a year.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Face Value is $45,000. Rate is 6%, which is 0.06. Time is 1/3.

So Discount = 45000 * 0.06 * (1/3)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 45000 by 0.06. 45000 * 0.06 is 2700. Then multiply by 1/3, which is 2700 * (1/3) = 900.

So the discount is $900.

Therefore, the proceeds are Face Value minus discount, which is 45000 - 900 = $44,100.

Wait, let me double-check. Is the time calculation correct? 120 days is a third of a year, yes, because 360/120 is 3, so 120 is 1/3. So that part is correct.

So the discount is $900, so proceeds are 45000 - 900 = 44100.

Looking at the options, option A is $44,100. So that's the answer.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes I've heard about different day conventions, like 365 days a year. Does that apply here? The question doesn't specify, but in banking, I think the 360-day year is standard for discount calculations, especially for such notes. So I think my calculation is right.
</think>

To determine Mr. Atlas' proceeds from discounting the note, we calculate the discount first and then subtract it from the face value of the note.

The discount is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Discount} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

- **Face Value**: $45,000  
- **Rate**: 6% or 0.06  
- **Time**: 120 days, which is converted to years as \( \frac{120}{360} = \frac{1}{3} \).

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Discount} = 45,000 \times 0.06 \times \frac{1}{3}
\]

First, calculate \( 45,000 \times 0.06 = 2,700 \). Then, multiply by \( \frac{1}{3} \):

\[
\text{Discount} = 2,700 \times \frac{1}{3} = 900
\]

The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 45,000 - 900 = 44,100
\]

Thus, Mr. Atlas' proceeds are **$44,100**, which corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A**
