Okay, so I have this problem here: Find Antilog_10 of 0.8762 minus 2. Hmm, Antilog base 10. I remember that antilog is the inverse of logarithm. So if log base 10 of a number is x, then the antilog of x would give me back that number.

Wait, the question is Antilog_10 (0.8762 - 2). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Is it 0.8762 minus 2, all inside the antilog? Or is it Antilog_10 of 0.8762 minus 2? The way it's written is "Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2." So maybe it's Antilog_10 (0.8762) minus 2? Or is it Antilog_10 (0.8762 - 2)?

I think the notation could be a bit ambiguous, but in math, when it's written like that, it's probably Antilog_10 of (0.8762 - 2). Let me double-check that. So, the subtraction is inside the antilog function.

So, first, I need to compute 0.8762 - 2. Let me calculate that. 0.8762 minus 2 is the same as -1.1238. Because 2 is 2.0000, subtracting 0.8762 gives me 1.1238, but since it's negative, it's -1.1238.

Now, I need to find the antilog base 10 of -1.1238. Antilog is 10 raised to that power. So, Antilog_10 (-1.1238) = 10^(-1.1238).

Wait, 10^(-1.1238) is the same as 1/(10^1.1238). Let me break that down. 10^1 is 10, and 10^0.1238 is a number less than 10. So 10^1.1238 is 10 times 10^0.1238.

I think I need to compute 10^0.1238. Hmm, I remember that log tables or maybe some approximation might help here. Alternatively, I can remember that 10^0.1 is approximately 1.2589, and 10^0.12 is about 1.3181. Wait, but 0.1238 is close to 0.12, but a bit higher.

Wait, another approach: Using the property that 10^0.1761 ≈ 1.5, because log10(1.5) is about 0.1761. But that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of known log values. For example, log(1.3) is about 0.1139, log(1.35) is around 0.1303, and log(1.4) is 0.1461. So 0.1238 is between log(1.35) and log(1.4). Let me see:

Wait, 10^0.1238 = x. So, x = 10^0.1238.

Wait, alternatively, using natural logarithm approximation. Hmm, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that 10^0.12 is approximately 1.3185. Let me double-check. Oh wait, I think 10^0.12 ≈ 1.3185.

Wait, let me think: 10^0.1 = approx 1.2589, 10^0.2= approx 1.5849. So 0.12 is 1/10 of the way from 0.1 to 0.2? No, wait 0.12 is 0.02 above 0.1. The difference between 0.2 and 0.1 is 0.1, so 0.02 is 20% of that. So maybe the value increases by 20% of the difference between 1.5849 and 1.2589.

Wait, but 1.2589 to 1.5849 is a difference of about 0.326. 20% of 0.326 is about 0.0652. So adding that to 1.2589 gives 1.3241. Hmm, but I thought 10^0.12 is about 1.3185. Maybe my approximation isn't great, but let's say approximately 1.318.

So 10^1.1238 is 10^1 * 10^0.1238 = 10 * 1.318 ≈ 13.18.

Wait, no, wait. Because 1.1238 is 1 + 0.1238, so 10^1.1238 = 10^1 * 10^0.1238 ≈ 10 * 1.318 ≈ 13.18.

So 10^(-1.1238) = 1 / 13.18 ≈ 0.0759.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:8.762

B:0.8762

C:0.0752

D:0.8752

E:1.752

F:0.00752

G:752

H:0.752

I:7.52

J:75.2

Hmm, my calculation gave approximately 0.0759. Looking at the options, option C is 0.0752, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me calculate 10^0.1238 more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithm properties.

Wait, I can use the fact that 0.1238 is approximately 0.124, and perhaps log(1.33) is about 0.124.

Wait, let me check: log10(1.3) is about 0.1139, log10(1.31)= 0.1170, log10(1.32)=0.1201, log10(1.33)=0.1228, log10(1.34)=0.1274. So 0.1238 is between 1.33 and 1.34.

Wait, 1.33 has log 0.1228, and 0.1238 is 0.001 above that. So the difference between 1.33 and 1.34 is 0.1274 -0.1228=0.0046 in log. So for an increase of 0.001 in log, the multiplier would be 10^0.001 ≈ 1.0023. So 1.33 * 1.0023 ≈ 1.3318.

So 10^0.1238 ≈ 1.3318.

So then 10^1.1238 = 10 * 1.3318 ≈ 13.318.

Therefore, 10^(-1.1238) = 1 / 13.318 ≈ 0.0751.

Looking back at the options, option C is 0.0752, which is very close to 0.0751. That's probably the correct answer.

So the antilog of (0.8762 - 2) is antilog of (-1.1238) ≈ 0.0751, which is closest to option C:0.0752.

Wait, but wait another thing. Another approach: perhaps the question was Antilog_10 (0.8762) minus 2. Oh, maybe I misinterpreted the original question. Let me re-read it.

The question says: Find Antilog_10 0.8762 - 2.

Hmm. So it could be (Antilog_10 0.8762) minus 2. Or Antilog_10 (0.8762 - 2). The notation is a bit unclear. But in math notation, when written like that without parentheses, it's usually the argument of the function. So it's more likely Antilog_10 (0.8762 - 2).

But just to explore the other possibility: if it's Antilog_10(0.8762) minus 2, what would that be?

Antilog_10(0.8762) is 10^0.8762. Let me compute that.

0.8762 is close to 0.88, and 10^0.88 is approximately 7.58. Wait, because 10^0.8 is about 6.31, 10^0.9 is about 7.94. So 0.8762 is near 0.88.

Wait, 10^0.8762. Let me think. 0.8762 = 0.8 + 0.0762.

10^0.8 is 6.3096.

10^0.0762: Hmm, 0.0762 in log corresponds to what number? Let's see, log(1.19) is about 0.0755. So 10^0.0762 ≈ 1.19.

So 10^0.8762 ≈ 6.3096 * 1.19 ≈ ?

6 * 1.19 = 7.14, 0.3096*1.19≈0.368. So total ≈7.14 + 0.368=7.508.

So 10^0.8762 ≈7.508.

Then subtract 2: 7.508 -2 =5.508. But looking at the options, none of them are near 5.5. So this can't be the right approach because the options don't have that.

So the initial approach must be correct: the antilog is of (0.8762-2), which is -1.1238, giving approximately 0.0751, which matches option C:0.0752.

Another way to check: Recall that log10(0.0752) = ?

Because if 10^x = 0.0752, then x = log10(0.0752).

0.0752 is 7.52e-2. So log10(7.52e-2) = log10(7.52) + log10(1e-2) = approx 0.8753 -2 = -1.1247.

Wait, that's close to -1.1238. So 10^(-1.1238)=0.0752 approximately.

Yes, that's correct. So option C is the answer.

To solve the problem, we need to compute the antilog base 10 of \( 0.8762 - 2 \). The antilog function is the inverse of the logarithm, meaning \( \text{Antilog}_{10}(x) = 10^x \).

1. **Calculate \( 0.8762 - 2 \):**  
   \[
   0.8762 - 2 = -1.1238
   \]

2. **Compute \( \text{Antilog}_{10}(-1.1238) \):**  
   This is equivalent to \( 10^{-1.1238} \). Breaking it down:  
   \[
   10^{-1.1238} = \frac{1}{10^{1.1238}}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 10^{1.1238} \):**  
   Using logarithmic properties and approximations:  
   \[
   10^{1.1238} = 10^1 \cdot 10^{0.1238} = 10 \cdot 1.318 \approx 13.18
   \]

4. **Find \( 10^{-1.1238} \):**  
   \[
   10^{-1.1238} = \frac{1}{13.18} \approx 0.0759
   \]

5. **Match the result to the closest option:**  
   The calculated value \( 0.0759 \) is very close to \( 0.0752 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

Thus, the final answer is:

**C: 0.0752**
