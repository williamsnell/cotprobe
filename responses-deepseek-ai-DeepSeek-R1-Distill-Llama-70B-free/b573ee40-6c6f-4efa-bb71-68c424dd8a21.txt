Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the standard molar entropy of gaseous platinum at 1000 K. They've given me some data, and I'm supposed to use the assumption that Pt is an ideal monatomic gas with negligible electronic excitation below 1000 K. Oh right, I remember that for ideal gases, especially monatomic ones, there are specific formulas we can use for entropy.

The data provided is a table with two temperatures and corresponding values. The columns are T in Kelvin and (G°_T - H°_298)/T in cal/(mole·K). So at 298.15 K, the value is -45.96, and at 1000 K, it's -49.17.

Hmm, I think the formula I need here is the one for the entropy of an ideal gas. Wait, the standard molar entropy S° can be calculated using the relationship between Gibbs free energy and enthalpy. Oh right, the equation is S = (H - G)/T + C, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the entropy can be found by integrating the heat capacity over temperature, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, let me think again. Oh, the Gibbs free energy G is related to enthalpy H and entropy S by the equation G = H - TS. So rearranging that gives S = (H - G)/T. But wait, I'm looking for the entropy at 1000 K, and the data given is (G°_T - H°_298)/T. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that.

Wait, the table gives (G°_T - H°_298)/T. So for T=298.15 K, it's -45.96 cal/(mol·K), and for T=1000 K, it's -49.17. So I think this term (G°_T - H°_298)/T is part of the entropy calculation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the expression for S° at temperature T. For an ideal gas, the entropy can be expressed as S°(T) = S°(298) + ∫(298 to T) (Cp / T) dT. But wait, I don't have Cp values here. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the Gibbs free energy equation is G°(T) = H°(T) - T S°(T). So, rearranging for S° gives S°(T) = (H°(T) - G°(T)) / T. Wait, but in the data, they give (G°_T - H°_298)/T. That's a bit different because H is at 298, not at T.

Wait, maybe I should consider the relation between G°_T and H°_T. Oh, right! The Gibbs free energy at temperature T is G°(T) = H°(T) - T S°(T). So if I can find H°(T), then I can find S°(T). But how?

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think again. The data given is (G°_T - H°_298)/T for T=298 and T=1000. So for T=298, it's (G°(298) - H°(298)) / 298.15 = -45.96. But wait, at T=298, H°(298) is just H° at that temperature. So substituting into the Gibbs equation: G°(298) = H°(298) - 298 S°(298). Then, (G°(298) - H°(298)) / 298 = (-298 S°(298)) / 298 = -S°(298). So that equals -45.96. Therefore, S°(298) is 45.96 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, that's interesting. So at 298 K, the standard molar entropy is 45.96 cal/(mol·K). But the question is asking for the entropy at 1000 K. So how do I get from 298 K to 1000 K?

Ah, I remember that for an ideal gas, the entropy change from T1 to T2 is given by ΔS = Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1), but since we're dealing with standard conditions, maybe the pressure terms cancel out. Wait, but I don't have Cp here. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the entropy of an ideal gas can be expressed as S°(T) = S°(298) + ∫(298 to T) (Cp/T) dT. But without Cp, how can I proceed? Oh wait, but for a monatomic ideal gas, Cp is (5/2)R, right? Because for monatomic gases, Cv is (3/2)R, and Cp is Cv + R = (5/2)R. So Cp would be (5/2) * R. But wait, R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K), so Cp would be around 4.9375 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait. Wait, if the problem states that electronic excitation is negligible, that might simplify things. Because for monatomic gases, the heat capacity is determined by translational motion only, which would make Cv=(3/2)R, and Cp=(5/2)R. So yeah, that makes sense.

So, the entropy at 1000 K, S°(1000), would be S°(298) plus the integral from 298 to 1000 of (Cp/T) dT. Since Cp is constant (because it's an ideal gas), the integral becomes Cp * ln(T2/T1).

So plugging in the numbers:

Cp = (5/2) R. R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K), so Cp = (5/2) * 1.987 ≈ 4.9675 cal/(mol·K).

Then, ΔS = Cp * ln(1000/298.15). Let me calculate that.

First, 1000/298.15 is approximately 3.356. The natural log of that is ln(3.356). Let me think, ln(3) is about 1.0986, ln(3.356) is a bit more. Maybe around 1.21?

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let's see, e^1.2 is about 3.32, which is close to 3.356. So ln(3.356) ≈ 1.21.

So ΔS ≈ 4.9675 * 1.21 ≈ let's see, 4.9675 * 1.2 is 5.961, and 4.9675 * 0.01 is 0.049675. So total is about 6.0107 cal/(mol·K).

So S°(1000) = S°(298) + ΔS = 45.96 + 6.0107 ≈ 51.97 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option G is 49.17, which is the value given at 1000 K in the table. Hmm, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I shouldn't use the Cp approach but instead use the data given. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem gives (G°_T - H°_298)/T at two temperatures. At T=1000 K, this value is -49.17 cal/(mol·K).

Wait, from the Gibbs equation, G°(T) = H°(T) - T S°(T). But if we don't have H°(T), but H°(298), perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the term (G°_T - H°_298)/T is being provided, and I can relate this to the entropy.

Wait, let's think:

We can write G°(T) = H°(T) - T S°(T).

But H°(T) is H°(298) + ∫(298 to T) Cp dT. So H°(T) = H°(298) + Cp (T - 298).

Wait, substituting that into the Gibbs equation:

G°(T) = [H°(298) + Cp (T - 298)] - T S°(T).

Rearranging:

G°(T) - H°(298) = Cp (T - 298) - T S°(T).

Divide both sides by T:

(G°(T) - H°(298)) / T = [Cp (T - 298)] / T - S°(T).

So, S°(T) = [Cp (T - 298)/T] - [(G°(T) - H°(298))/T].

Hmm, that seems promising. Let me plug in the values.

We have Cp as (5/2) R = 4.9675 cal/mol·K.

At T=1000 K:

First term: (4.9675 * (1000 - 298.15)) / 1000.

Calculate 1000 - 298.15 = 701.85.

So 4.9675 * 701.85 ≈ let's see, 4.9675 * 700 = 3477.25, and 4.9675 * 1.85 ≈ 9.19. So total is approximately 3486.44. Then divide by 1000: 3.48644 cal/(mol·K).

Second term: (G°(1000) - H°(298)) / 1000 = -49.17 cal/(mol·K).

So S°(1000) = 3.48644 - (-49.17) = 3.48644 + 49.17 = 52.656 cal/(mol·K).

Hmm, looking at the options, option F is 52, and option B is 52.7. So this is approximately 52.66, which would round to 52.7, so option B.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the entropy change from 298 to 1000 K, I got about 51.97, but this approach gives 52.66. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Cp approach because I assumed that H°(T) = H°(298) + Cp*(T-298), but that might not be accurate because H is a function of temperature and Cp is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure. But wait, for an ideal gas, H is a function of temperature only, so that approach should be valid.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Using the second approach, from the given data and the formula:

S°(T) = [Cp*(T - 298)/T] - (G°_T - H°_298)/T.

So substituting the numbers:

Cp = 4.9675 cal/mol·K.

At T=1000:

Term1 = (4.9675 * (1000 - 298.15)) / 1000 = (4.9675 * 701.85)/1000.

701.85 * 4.9675: Let me compute 700 *4.9675 = 3477.25, and 1.85 *4.9675≈9.19, so total ≈ 3486.44. Dividing by 1000 gives 3.48644.

Term2 = (G°_T - H°_298)/T = -49.17, so subtracting that is adding 49.17.

So 3.48644 +49.17 =52.65644, which is approximately 52.66 cal/(mol·K).

Looking at the options, option B is 52.7, which is very close. So maybe that's the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise values for R and the logarithm would yield a slightly different result, but I think this approach is more accurate because it uses the given data directly.

Wait, but another thought: the term (G°_T - H°_298)/T is provided, so using that directly in the S° equation might be the intended method.

So I think the correct answer is B:52.7 cal/(mol·K).

To calculate the standard molar entropy of gaseous platinum at 1000 K, we use the relationship between Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy. The given data includes the term \((G^\circ_T - H^\circ_{298}) / T\) at two temperatures: 298.15 K and 1000 K. 

The formula for entropy at temperature \(T\) is derived from the Gibbs free energy equation:

\[
S^\circ(T) = \frac{H^\circ(T) - G^\circ(T)}{T}.
\]

Substituting \(H^\circ(T) = H^\circ_{298} + \int_{298}^{T} C_p \, dT\), and assuming \(C_p\) is constant for an ideal monatomic gas, we can express \(S^\circ(T)\) as:

\[
S^\circ(T) = S^\circ_{298} + \int_{298}^{T} \frac{C_p}{T} \, dT.
\]

For a monatomic ideal gas, \(C_p = \frac{5}{2}R\), where \(R = 1.987 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}\). Thus, \(C_p = 4.9675 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}\).

Using the data provided, at \(T = 298.15 \, \text{K}\), the term \((G^\circ_{298} - H^\circ_{298}) / 298.15 = -45.96 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}\). This implies:

\[
S^\circ_{298} = 45.96 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}.
\]

At \(T = 1000 \, \text{K}\), the term \((G^\circ_{1000} - H^\circ_{298}) / 1000 = -49.17 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}\). Using the relationship:

\[
S^\circ(1000) = \frac{C_p (T - 298)}{T} - \frac{G^\circ_T - H^\circ_{298}}{T},
\]

we calculate:

1. \(\frac{C_p (T - 298)}{T} = \frac{4.9675 \cdot (1000 - 298)}{1000} = 3.486 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}\),
2. \(-\frac{G^\circ_T - H^\circ_{298}}{T} = 49.17 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}\).

Adding these terms:

\[
S^\circ(1000) = 3.486 + 49.17 = 52.66 \, \text{cal/(mol·K)}.
\]

This value rounds to 52.7 cal/(mol·K), which corresponds to option **B**.
