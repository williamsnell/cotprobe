Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to raise a phasor (8.66 + j5.0) to the second power and then to the fifth power. Hmm, phasors... right, they're complex numbers represented in polar form, which makes exponentiation easier using De Moivre's theorem. Wait, but the given phasor is in rectangular form, so I think I need to convert it to polar first.

So, the phasor is 8.66 + j5.0. To convert to polar form, I need to find the magnitude and the angle. The magnitude r is the square root of (8.66² + 5.0²). Let me calculate that. 8.66 squared is approximately 75 (because 8.66 times 8 is 69.28, and 8.66 times 0.66 is around 5.72, so total about 74.28... wait, wait, 8.66^2 is 8.66*8.66. Let me compute that more accurately. 8^2 is 64, 0.66^2 is about 0.4356. Then, the cross terms are 2*8*0.66 = 10.56. So 64 + 10.56 + 0.4356 = around 75. So 8.66 squared is about 75. Then 5 squared is 25. So r squared is 75 + 25 = 100. So r is 10.

Oh wait, that's a nice number. So the magnitude is 10. Then the angle θ is arctangent of (5/8.66). Let me compute that. 5 divided by 8.66 is approximately 0.577. Because 5/8.66 is around 0.577, which is roughly 1/√3. Oh wait, because tan(30 degrees) is about 0.577. So θ should be around 30 degrees. But wait, let me check more precisely. 8.66 is approximately 8.66. Let me compute 5/8.66 exactly. 8.66 is close to 8 and 2/3, which is 8.666..., so 5/(8.666..) = 5/(26/3) )= 15/26 ≈ 0.5769. So yes, tanθ ≈ 0.577, so θ ≈ 30 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's think again. If the real part is 8.66 and the imaginary part is 5, then it's in the first quadrant. So θ is indeed approximately 30 degrees.

So the polar form is 10 ∠30°. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe it's a bit more precise. Because 5/8.66 is about 0.577, which is approximately 30 degrees, but let me compute it more accurately. Using a calculator, tan inverse of 0.577. Let's see, 30 degrees is 0.5774, so it's almost exactly 30 degrees. So θ is 30 degrees.

So now, the phasor in polar form is 10∠30°. Now, raising this to the second power. Using De Moivre's theorem, (r ∠θ)^n = r^n ∠nθ.

So for the square (n=2), r becomes 10^2 = 100, and the angle becomes 2*30 = 60 degrees. So (8.66 +j5)^2 = 100∠60°.

Now, for the fifth power. So n=5. Then r becomes 10^5 = 100,000. The angle becomes 5*30 = 150 degrees. So (8.66 +j5)^5 = 100,000∠150°.

Looking at the options, I need to check which one has 100∠60° for the second power and 100,000∠150° for the fifth. Let me look through the options.

Option J says 100∠60 and 100,000∠150°. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Did I make any mistakes in the exponentiation?

Wait, when you square 10∠30, you get 10^2=100, angle 60. Correct. Fifth power is 10^5=100,000, angle 5×30=150. Yes. So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To solve the problem, the phasor \( 8.66 + j5.0 \) is first converted from rectangular form to polar form. The magnitude \( r \) is calculated as:

\[
r = \sqrt{(8.66)^2 + (5.0)^2} = \sqrt{75 + 25} = \sqrt{100} = 10.
\]

The angle \( \theta \) is determined using the arctangent function:

\[
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{5.0}{8.66}\right) \approx \arctan(0.577) \approx 30^\circ.
\]

Thus, the phasor in polar form is \( 10 \angle 30^\circ \).

Next, the phasor is raised to the second power and the fifth power using De Moivre's theorem:

1. **Second power**:
   \[
   (10 \angle 30^\circ)^2 = 10^2 \angle 2(30^\circ) = 100 \angle 60^\circ.
   \]

2. **Fifth power**:
   \[
   (10 \angle 30^\circ)^5 = 10^5 \angle 5(30^\circ) = 100,000 \angle 150^\circ.
   \]

Finally, comparing these results with the given options, the correct match is:

**Option J: \( 100 \angle 60^\circ \) and \( 100,000 \angle 150^\circ \).**
