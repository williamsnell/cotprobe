Okay, so I've got this economics question here about monopolistic competition. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. Monopolistic competition is a type of market structure where there are many firms, each producing a differentiated product. So, unlike perfect competition, where products are identical, here each firm's product is unique in some way.

The question is asking what happens when firms enter an industry that's monopolistically competitive. So, I need to figure out the effects of new firms entering on various economic indicators.

Let me read the options again to get a clearer picture.

Options are A to J, each suggesting different outcomes. Let's break down each option one by one.

Option A: Number of firms decreases. Wait, no. If firms are entering, the number should increase, so A is unlikely.

Option B: Market supply becomes inelastic. Hmm, elasticity of supply refers to how responsive the quantity supplied is to price changes. If more firms enter, supply might increase, but elasticity itself... I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe I'll come back.

Option C: Market demand becomes more elastic. Market demand elasticity is about how responsive quantity demanded is to price changes. More firms entering might mean each firm's demand becomes more elastic because consumers have more choices. But wait, is that market demand or individual demand? I think market demand is the overall demand, which in monopolistic competition is likely to be more elastic because there are close substitutes. But does entry affect that? Or is the elasticity of individual firm's demand changing?

Option D: Market price decreases. When more firms enter, they increase supply, which can shift the supply curve right, leading to lower prices. That makes sense because more competition usually leads to lower prices as firms try to attract consumers.

Option E: Demand for existing firms becomes more elastic. Elastic demand means that a change in price leads to a larger change in quantity demanded. If more firms enter, each existing firm's product has more substitutes. So, if a firm raises its price, more consumers might switch to other firms' products, making the demand more elastic. So yes, this sounds plausible.

Option F: Demand becomes more inelastic. That's the opposite of E. Since with more substitutes, demand should become more elastic, not less. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Market supply shifts rightward. Yes, when more firms enter the industry, the supply increases at every price level, so the supply curve shifts to the right. So G seems correct.

Option H: Demand for existing firms shifts rightward. Wait, no. If new firms enter, each existing firm's demand would decrease or shift left because consumers have more options. So H doesn't seem right.

Option I: Market price increases. That's the opposite of D. More firms entering would likely lower prices, not increase, so I is probably wrong.

Option J: Demand shifts leftward. As more firms enter, each existing firm's demand curve shifts left because the market is more competitive, and each firm's sales might drop unless they differentiate more. So J could be correct.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about what we expect when firms enter. So the effects would be:

- More firms mean more supply, so supply shifts right (G is correct).

- The market price would decrease because supply increases, shifting the equilibrium to a lower price (so D is correct).

- For each existing firm, the demand becomes more elastic because there are more substitutes. So E is correct.

Wait, but each option is a separate possibility. The question is, which one is correct.

So the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer. Let's read the question again.

"If firms are entering an industry that is monopolistically competitive, we would expect...".

So, which of these outcomes is expected.

Looking at the options:

E: The demand for existing firms to become more elastic. This makes sense because as more substitutes are available, consumers have more options, making individual firms' demand more elastic.

G: Market supply shifts right. Correct, as more firms enter, supply increases.

D: Market price to decrease. Correct, more supply leads to lower prices.

So the question is, which of these is the correct answer.

Wait, the options are A-J, each a separate option. So the correct answer must be one of these. Let me think about the typical effects.

In monopolistic competition, when new firms enter, each existing firm's demand curve shifts to the left (because the market is getting more crowded), but each firm's demand becomes more elastic. Wait, so for individual firms, demand becomes more elastic because the availability of substitutes increases.

So, when more firms enter, the demand facing each existing firm becomes more elastic. So E is correct.

But wait, is E the correct option? Let me make sure.

Yes, because with more firms, each firm's product has more substitutes, so the demand curve for each firm becomes more elastic. So if a firm raises its price, more consumers will switch to other firms' products, hence elastic demand.

So, the answer should be E.

Wait, but what about the market supply? Option G says the market supply shifts right. That's also correct because more firms mean more production capacity, so supply increases.

So the question is, which of these is an expected outcome. So both E and G could be correct, but the options are separate.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J, so each is a possible answer. So the question is, which of these is correct.

Let me think about the question again. The question is about the effect of firms entering. So the options to evaluate are:

E: The demand for existing firms becomes more elastic. Correct.

G: Market supply shifts right. Also correct.

So which one is the correct answer? Because the question is presented as a single correct option.

Wait, the original question says "we would expect", implying only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Monopolistic competition leads to product differentiation, and when firms enter, each firm's demand curve shifts left and becomes more elastic. So the demand curve for each firm becomes more elastic. So E is correct.

But also, when more firms enter, the market supply curve shifts right, which is G.

Wait, perhaps both E and G are correct, but looking at the options, they are separate. So maybe the correct answer is E and G? But the options are single letters, so I must choose which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the market's reaction, not individual firms. Let me re-examine the options.

Option E says, "the demand for existing firms to become more elastic." So that's about individual firms.

Option G is about market supply shifting right.

So, the question is about what happens when firms enter. So both would happen. But the options are separate, so the correct answer could be either.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both E and G, but in the options, each is a separate choice. So the question expects one correct answer. I must choose which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E. Because in monopolistic competition, the entry of firms affects individual firm's demand elasticity. Also, market supply increases.

But the options are about what we would expect to happen. So perhaps both E and G are correct, but the options only provide E and G as separate options, so perhaps the correct answer includes both.

Wait, no, that's not possible because in the options, each letter is a separate choice. So perhaps the correct answer is both E and G, but in this case, the options are individual, so I must choose the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E. Let me think about the standard theory.

When new firms enter a monopolistically competitive industry, the demand curves of existing firms shift to the left, and each firm's demand becomes more elastic. So E is correct.

Additionally, the market supply curve shifts to the right as more firms enter, increasing the total supply, which would lower the market price. So D and G are also correct. But the question is, which option is correct.

Wait, the options are:

C: Market demand becomes more elastic.

E: Demand for existing firms becomes more elastic.

G: Market supply shifts right.

So in the options, both E and G are correct, but perhaps the question is looking for which one of the options is correct. So the answer could be E or G.

Wait, but the question is about what we would expect. So all these could be correct, but perhaps the best answer is E.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G, because when firms enter, supply increases.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall any past lectures or textbook content.

In monopolistic competition, when firms enter, each existing firm's demand curve becomes more elastic because there are more substitutes. So E is correct.

Also, as more firms enter, the supply curve shifts to the right, leading to lower prices. So G is correct.

But the question is which of the options is correct. So perhaps the answer includes both E and G, but since each is a separate option, the correct answers would be E and G.

Wait, but the options are presented as single choices, so perhaps the intended answer is E and/or G.

Wait, looking at the options again:

The question is phrased as "we would expect" which one of the following. So the correct answer must be one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is E and G are both correct, but in the options, they are separate, so perhaps the correct answer is both E and G.

But the options are to choose a single letter, so perhaps the intended answer is E and G. Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because when more firms enter, the individual firm's demand becomes more elastic.

Alternatively, when more firms enter, the market supply shifts right, which is G.

So which one is more directly tied to the question.

The question is about what happens when firms enter. So the correct answers would include more firms (so A is wrong), supply shifts right (so G is correct), market price decreases (D correct), and individual demand becomes more elastic (E correct).

So perhaps the correct options are D, E, G.

But the question allows only one correct answer, so perhaps the answer is E, because it's about individual firms, which is a key feature of monopolistic competition.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G, as it's more about the market as a whole.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. I think I need to decide.

Wait, another approach: in a monopolistically competitive market, entry leads to each firm's demand becoming more elastic. So E is correct.

So the correct answer is E.

When firms enter an industry that is monopolistically competitive, several effects can be expected. Monopolistic competition is characterized by many firms producing differentiated products, and the entry of new firms increases competition. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: The number of firms in the industry decreases. This is incorrect because the entry of firms increases the number of firms in the industry.

- **Option B**: The market supply becomes inelastic. This is unlikely because the entry of firms typically increases supply, making it more elastic, not inelastic.

- **Option C**: The market demand becomes more elastic. While market demand may become more elastic due to increased substitutes, this is not the most direct effect of firm entry.

- **Option D**: The market price of the product decreases. This is plausible because increased supply from new firms can lower the market price.

- **Option E**: The demand for existing firms becomes more elastic. This is correct because as more firms enter, each firm's product has more substitutes, making the demand for existing firms more elastic.

- **Option F**: The demand for existing firms becomes more inelastic. This is incorrect because increased substitutes make demand more elastic, not inelastic.

- **Option G**: The market supply shifts rightward. This is correct because the entry of new firms increases the total supply, shifting the supply curve to the right.

- **Option H**: The demand for existing firms shifts rightward. This is incorrect because the entry of new firms reduces the demand for existing firms, shifting their demand curves leftward.

- **Option I**: The market price of the product increases. This is incorrect because increased supply typically lowers the market price.

- **Option J**: The demand for existing firms shifts leftward. This is correct because as new firms enter, the demand for existing firms decreases.

Among the options, **E** and **G** are both correct. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **E** is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the effect of increased competition on the elasticity of demand for existing firms, which is a key feature of monopolistic competition.

Answer: E
