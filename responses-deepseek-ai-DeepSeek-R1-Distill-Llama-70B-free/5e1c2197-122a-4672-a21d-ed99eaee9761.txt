Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, the question is about calculating the equilibrium constant Kp for a reaction involving sodium vapor. The reaction given is 2Na(g) ⇌ Na₂(g). 

Hmm, I remember that Kp is the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures. So I need to find the partial pressures of Na and Na₂ at equilibrium.

The data provided is at 1482.53 K and 10.0 atm. The equilibrium composition has 71.30 weight percent Na monomer and 28.70 weight percent Na dimer. Oh wait, so the total weight is 100%, right? So 71.3% is Na, and 28.7% is Na₂.

But wait, how do I convert weight percentages into partial pressures? I think I need to find the mole fractions first because partial pressures depend on mole fractions.

Let me think. The total weight is 100 grams, perhaps. So 71.3 g of Na and 28.7 g of Na₂. But wait, sodium's molar mass is about 23 g/mol. So let's calculate moles.

Moles of Na = 71.3 g / 23 g/mol ≈ 3.104 moles.
Moles of Na₂: molar mass of Na₂ is 46 g/mol. So 28.7 g /46 g/mol ≈ 0.623 moles.

Total moles in the system = 3.104 + 0.623 = 3.727 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. The reaction is 2Na ⇌ Na₂. The stoichiometry is important here. So for every 2 moles of Na consumed, 1 mole of Na₂ is produced. But here, the composition is given at equilibrium, so the mole amounts are the equilibrium state.

But I'm a bit confused. Are those the total moles, or initial moles? No, the problem says it's the equilibrium composition, so these are the moles at equilibrium.

Now, let's find the mole fractions. The mole fraction (X) is the moles of a component divided by total moles.

Mole fraction of Na (X_Na) = 3.104 / 3.727 ≈ 0.833.
Mole fraction of Na₂ (X_Na2) = 0.623 / 3.727 ≈ 0.167.

But wait, partial pressure of each component is equal to mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure. Oh yes, because P_total = X_Na * P_total + X_Na2 * P_total. So each partial pressure is X_i * P_total.

So P_Na = X_Na * 10 atm = 0.833 * 10 ≈ 8.33 atm.
P_Na2 = X_Na2 * 10 atm = 0.167 * 10 ≈ 1.67 atm.

Wait, but the reaction is 2Na(g) ⇌ Na₂(g). So the expression for Kp would be (P_Na2) / (P_Na)^2.

Plugging the values in, Kp = (1.67) / (8.33)^2.

Let me compute that. 8.33 squared is approximately 69.4. So 1.67 / 69.4 ≈ 0.024.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 0.024. So is that the correct answer? But wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait a second, perhaps the mole fractions are calculated incorrectly. Because the moles I calculated were at equilibrium, but I think I might have made a mistake in the assumption of 100 grams. The problem doesn't state the total mass, so maybe I should approach it differently, using variables.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of the change. Let's say initially, before any reaction, we have only Na(g). Let me assume that the initial moles of Na are n. Then, as the reaction proceeds, 2 moles of Na form 1 mole of Na₂.

At equilibrium:

Moles of Na = n - 2x
Moles of Na₂ = x

Wait, but the weight percentages are given. So the weight of Na is 71.3% of the total weight, and Na₂ is 28.7%.

Wait, but the total weight is the sum: (n - 2x) * 23 + x *46 = total weight.

Wait, but perhaps I should express weight in terms of moles. The weight of Na is (n - 2x)*23, and Na₂ is x*46. The total weight W = (n - 2x)*23 + x*46.

But the weight percent of Na is 71.3%, so:

[(n - 2x)*23] / W = 0.713.

Similarly, [(x*46)] / W = 0.287.

Since both equations have W, perhaps we can divide them to eliminate W.

Dividing the two:

[(n - 2x)*23] / [x*46] = 0.713 / 0.287.

Compute 0.713 / 0.287 ≈ 2.483.

So,

23(n - 2x) / (46 x) ) = 2.483.

Simplify 23/46 = 0.5, so:

0.5 (n - 2x) / x = 2.483.

Multiply both sides by x:

0.5 (n - 2x) = 2.483 x.

Multiply both sides by 2:

(n - 2x) = 4.966 x.

n = (4.966 + 2) x = 6.966 x.

So n ≈ 7x.

Now, let's compute the mole fractions. The total moles at equilibrium is (n - 2x) + x = n - x = 7x - x =6x.

Mole fraction of Na: (n - 2x) / (6x) = (7x - 2x)/(6x) =5x/(6x)=5/6≈0.833.

Mole fraction of Na₂: x/(6x)=1/6≈0.1667.

So same as before. So the partial pressures would be:

P_Na = X_Na * P_total = (5/6) *10 atm ≈8.333 atm.

P_Na2 = (1/6)*10 ≈1.6667 atm.

So Kp = (P_Na2) / (P_Na)^2 = (1.6667) / (8.333)^2.

Compute denominator: 8.333^2 is approximately 69.444. So 1.6667 / 69.444 ≈ 0.024.

Looking back at the options, option J is 0.024. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think again—did I make any miscalculations?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer is indeed J: 0.024.

To calculate the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) for the reaction \( 2\text{Na(g)} \rightleftharpoons \text{Na}_2\text{(g)} \), we start by analyzing the equilibrium composition of sodium vapor. At equilibrium, the weight percentages are given as 71.30% Na (monomer) and 28.70% Na₂ (dimer). The total pressure is 10.0 atm.

### Step 1: Convert weight percentages to mole fractions
Assume a total mass of 100 g for simplicity:
- Mass of Na = \( 71.3 \, \text{g} \)
- Mass of Na₂ = \( 28.7 \, \text{g} \)

The molar masses are:
- \( \text{Na: } 23 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- \( \text{Na}_2: 46 \, \text{g/mol} \)

Calculate moles:
- Moles of Na = \( \frac{71.3}{23} \approx 3.104 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of Na₂ = \( \frac{28.7}{46} \approx 0.623 \, \text{mol} \)

Total moles = \( 3.104 + 0.623 = 3.727 \, \text{mol} \).

Mole fractions:
- \( X_{\text{Na}} = \frac{\text{Moles of Na}}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{3.104}{3.727} \approx 0.833 \)
- \( X_{\text{Na}_2} = \frac{\text{Moles of Na}_2}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{0.623}{3.727} \approx 0.167 \)

### Step 2: Calculate partial pressures
The partial pressure of each component is the product of its mole fraction and the total pressure:
- \( P_{\text{Na}} = X_{\text{Na}} \cdot P_{\text{total}} = 0.833 \cdot 10 \approx 8.33 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( P_{\text{Na}_2} = X_{\text{Na}_2} \cdot P_{\text{total}} = 0.167 \cdot 10 \approx 1.67 \, \text{atm} \)

### Step 3: Write the equilibrium constant expression
For the reaction \( 2\text{Na(g)} \rightleftharpoons \text{Na}_2\text{(g)} \), the equilibrium constant is:
\[
K_p = \frac{P_{\text{Na}_2}}{(P_{\text{Na}})^2}
\]

Substitute the partial pressures:
\[
K_p = \frac{1.67}{(8.33)^2}
\]

Calculate the denominator:
\[
(8.33)^2 \approx 69.4
\]

Thus:
\[
K_p = \frac{1.67}{69.4} \approx 0.024
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of \( K_p \) is approximately **0.024**, which corresponds to **option J**.
