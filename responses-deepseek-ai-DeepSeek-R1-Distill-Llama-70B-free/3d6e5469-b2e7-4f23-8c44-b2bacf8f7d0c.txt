Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the atomic weight of natural chlorine based on its isotopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the problem says that natural chlorine is a mixture of two isotopes. Chlorine-35 makes up 75.53% and has a mass of 34.968. Chlorine-37 is 24.47% and has a mass of 36.956. I need to find the average atomic weight.

Wait, right, the atomic weight is calculated by taking the weighted average of the isotopes' masses, weighted by their abundance. So, it's like each isotope contributes a portion of its mass proportional to how common it is.

So the formula should be something like: (percentage of Cl-35 * mass of Cl-35) + (percentage of Cl-37 * mass of Cl-37). Oh, right, but the percentages are given in %, so I need to convert them to decimals for the calculation.

Let me jot that down. 

Cl-35: 75.53% → 0.7553
Cl-37: 24.47% → 0.2447

Masses are 34.968 and 36.956 respectively.

So the calculation is (0.7553 * 34.968) + (0.2447 * 36.956).

Let me compute each part step by step. 

First, 0.7553 multiplied by 34.968. Hmm, let's see. Let me approximate this. 0.75 * 35 is about 26.25, but let me do it more accurately.

0.7553 * 34.968:

Let me compute 34.968 * 0.7 = 24.4776
34.968 * 0.05 = 1.7484
34.968 * 0.0053 = let's see, 34.968 * 0.005 is 0.17484, and 0.0003 * 34.968 is about 0.01049. So adding those together: 0.17484 + 0.01049 ≈ 0.18533.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just multiply step by step.

Wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, compute 34.968 * 0.7553.

Let me break it down:

34.968 * 0.7 = 24.4776

34.968 * 0.05 = 1.7484

34.968 * 0.0053 = ?

Let me compute 34.968 * 5.3e-3.

5e-3 is 0.005, so 34.968 * 0.005 = 0.17484

0.3e-3 is 0.0003, so 34.968 * 0.0003 = 0.0104904

Adding those: 0.17484 + 0.0104904 = 0.1853304.

So adding all together:

24.4776 + 1.7484 = 26.226

26.226 + 0.1853304 ≈ 26.4113.

Hmm, so approximately 26.41 from Cl-35.

Now for Cl-37: 0.2447 * 36.956.

Let me compute that.

0.2 * 36.956 = 7.3912

0.04 * 36.956 = 1.47824

0.0047 * 36.956 = let's compute 0.004 * 36.956 = 0.147824, and 0.0007 * 36.956 = 0.0258692. So 0.147824 + 0.0258692 ≈ 0.1736932.

So adding all parts:

7.3912 + 1.47824 = 8.86944

8.86944 + 0.1736932 ≈ 9.0431332.

So Cl-37 contributes approximately 9.0431.

Now, adding the two contributions together: 26.4113 + 9.0431 ≈ 35.4544.

Wait, so the atomic weight should be around 35.45.

Looking at the options: Hmm, option H is 35.45. Let me double-check the options.

Options are:

A: 36.956

B: 35.00

C: 34.50

D:34.968

E:37.00

F:30.75

G:35.75

H:35.45

I:36.50

J:35.53

So option H is 35.45, which matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me redo the calculations more precisely.

Compute 0.7553 * 34.968:

34.968 * 0.7553.

Let me use a calculator approach:

34.968 * 0.7553 = ?

Compute 34.968 * 0.7 = 24.4776

34.968 * 0.05 = 1.7484

34.968 * 0.005 = 0.17484

34.968 * 0.0003 = 0.0104904

Adding those:

0.7 + 0.05 +0.005 +0.0003 = 0.7553.

So 24.4776 + 1.7484 = 26.226

+ 0.17484 → 26.40084

+ 0.0104904 → 26.4113304.

So that's 26.4113.

Cl-37 part: 0.2447 * 36.956.

Compute 36.956 * 0.2447.

Let me do it as:

36.956 * 0.2 = 7.3912

36.956 * 0.04 = 1.47824

36.956 * 0.0047 = ?

Compute 36.956 * 0.004 = 0.147824

36.956 * 0.0007 = 0.0258692

Adding those: 0.147824 + 0.0258692 = 0.1736932.

Adding all parts:

7.3912 + 1.47824 = 8.86944

+ 0.1736932 → 9.0431332.

So total is 26.4113 + 9.0431332 = 35.4544.

Rounding to four decimal places, 35.4544. So approximately 35.45.

Looking at the options, H is 35.45, so that's the correct answer.

To determine the atomic weight of natural chlorine, we calculate the weighted average of the isotopes' masses, weighted by their relative abundances. The isotopes and their data are as follows:

- Chlorine-35: 75.53% abundance (0.7553 in decimal), mass = 34.968  
- Chlorine-37: 24.47% abundance (0.2447 in decimal), mass = 36.956  

The formula for the atomic weight is:  
\[
\text{Atomic Weight} = (\text{Abundance of Cl-35} \times \text{Mass of Cl-35}) + (\text{Abundance of Cl-37} \times \text{Mass of Cl-37})
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the contribution of Cl-35  
\[
0.7553 \times 34.968 = 26.4113
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the contribution of Cl-37  
\[
0.2447 \times 36.956 = 9.0431
\]

### Step 3: Add the contributions together  
\[
26.4113 + 9.0431 = 35.4544
\]

Thus, the atomic weight of natural chlorine is approximately **35.45**.

### Final Answer:
H: 35.45  

The correct answer is **H**.
