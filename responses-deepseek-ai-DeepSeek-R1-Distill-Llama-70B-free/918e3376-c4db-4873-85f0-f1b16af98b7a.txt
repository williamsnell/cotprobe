Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about calculating the change in entropy (ΔS) for a system when 1 mole of solid copper expands isothermally from 200 atm to 1 atm. The given data includes the coefficient of volume expansion α and the density d of copper.

Hmm, alright, I remember that entropy change for an isothermal process can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), but wait, that's for an ideal gas where pressure and volume change. But wait, in this case, it's solid copper, which isn't a gas. So maybe I need a different approach.

Oh right, for solids, the volume change with pressure isn't as straightforward as with gases. But since the process is isothermal, maybe we can relate the change in volume to the pressure change. Oh, and I remember that solids have a bulk modulus, but I don't think that's given here. Alternatively, there's the isothermal compressibility, which is related to the coefficient of volume expansion.

Wait, the coefficient of volume expansion α is given as (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_P. But we're dealing with a change in pressure, not temperature. So how do I connect these?

I recall that for solids, the isothermal compressibility κ is defined as -(1/V)(∂V/∂P)_T. And since we're dealing with expansion, the change in volume would be due to the change in pressure. So maybe I can express the volume change in terms of pressure using κ.

But I don't have κ directly, but perhaps I can relate it to α. Wait, maybe I can find the relation between α and κ. I remember that for solids, the product of α and κ is approximately equal to the thermal expansion coefficient times the compressibility. Hmm, not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can find the volume change using α.

Wait, let's think about the volume as a function of pressure and temperature. The total differential of volume would be dV = (∂V/∂T)_P dT + (∂V/∂P)_T dP. Since the process is isothermal, dT=0, so dV = (∂V/∂P)_T dP. And (∂V/∂P)_T is equal to -Vκ, so dV = -V κ dP.

But I don't have κ, so maybe I can express κ in terms of α. I think there's a relation involving the bulk modulus and thermal expansion. Let me think. The bulk modulus B is defined as -V (∂P/∂V)_T, so B = 1/κ. Right, so κ = 1/B.

But how to find B? Alternatively, maybe I can use the given α and the density to find the molar volume and then find the change in volume due to pressure.

Wait, the density d is given as 8.96e3 kg/m³. The molar mass of copper is about 63.55 g/mol, I think. So to find the molar volume V_m, I can compute it as (molar mass)/density.

Let me calculate that. Molar mass M = 63.55 g/mol = 0.06355 kg/mol. Density d = 8.96e3 kg/m³. So V_m = M / d = 0.06355 / 8960 ≈ let's see, 0.06355 / 8960 ≈ 7.09e-6 m³/mol. Wait, 0.06355 divided by 8960: 8960 is 8.96e3, so 0.06355 / 8960 = approximately 7.09e-6 m³/mol.

So the initial volume V1 would be V_m, which is about 7.09e-6 m³. Now, when the pressure changes, the volume changes. Since it's expanding from high pressure to low, the volume increases.

But wait, for an isothermal process, the work done is PΔV, but here we're interested in the entropy change. The formula for entropy change when both T and P change is ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1), but wait, that's for an ideal gas. Wait no, Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure, but that's for gases. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: For a solid, the entropy change can be approximated by considering the volume change due to pressure, since the process is isothermal. The formula for entropy change when pressure changes at constant temperature is ΔS = -∫(∂V/∂T)_P dP from P1 to P2.

Wait, no, I think the correct expression is ΔS = n (∂V/∂T)_P (P2 - P1) ? Wait, perhaps integrating (∂V/∂T)_P dP.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look up the formula for entropy change for a solid under pressure change.

Wait, from what I remember, the entropy change can be calculated using the equation:

ΔS = - (∂V/∂T)_P (P2 - P1)

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the general formula for entropy change when pressure changes at constant temperature is ΔS = -∫( (∂V/∂T)_P ) dP.

Wait, let me think about the thermodynamic potentials. The entropy S is a function of T and P. So, the differential is dS = (∂S/∂T)_P dT + (∂S/∂P)_T dP.

At constant temperature, dT=0, so dS = (∂S/∂P)_T dP.

And from Maxwell's relations, (∂S/∂P)_T = - (∂V/∂T)_P.

So, substituting, dS = - (∂V/∂T)_P dP.

Therefore, the change in entropy when pressure changes from P1 to P2 at constant T is:

ΔS = - (∂V/∂T)_P (P2 - P1)

Wait, but (∂V/∂T)_P is given as α V, right? Because α = (1/V)(∂V/∂T)_P → (∂V/∂T)_P = α V.

So substituting, ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

Wait, that makes sense. So the formula would be ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

But wait, the pressure is decreasing from 200 atm to 1 atm, so P2 is lower than P1. So P2 - P1 is negative, so ΔS would be positive? Because the system is expanding, so the entropy should increase, which aligns with positive ΔS.

Wait, but let me make sure about the signs. So if the pressure decreases (P2 < P1), then (P2 - P1) is negative. So the formula becomes ΔS = - α V (negative number) = positive, which makes sense for expansion.

So, let's plug in the numbers. α is given as 1.66e-5 K^-1. V is the molar volume we calculated earlier, which is approximately 7.09e-6 m³/mol. The pressure change is from 200 atm to 1 atm, so P2 - P1 = 1 - 200 = -199 atm.

Wait, but wait a second, pressure units. Since we're dealing with partial derivatives with respect to pressure, the units should be in Pascals, right? Because SI units for pressure are Pascals.

So, 1 atm is approximately 101325 Pascals. So P2 = 1 atm = 101325 Pa, and P1 = 200 atm = 200 * 101325 = 20,265,000 Pa.

So P2 - P1 = 101325 - 20,265,000 = -20,163,675 Pa.

Wait, but I think that when using the formula, the pressure should be in SI units. So that's correct.

So putting it all together:

ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

Wait, no, the formula I derived was ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1) ?

Wait, no, wait. From the earlier steps, I had ΔS = - (∂V/∂T)_P (P2 - P1 )

And (∂V/∂T)_P = α V, so substituting:

ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

But wait, let me double-check. Because the expansion is isothermal, and the entropy change is for the system. So the system is doing work by expanding, which would increase the entropy.

Let me proceed with the calculation.

So, α = 1.66e-5 K^-1

V = 7.09e-6 m³/mol (from molar volume)

P2 - P1 = (1 atm - 200 atm) = -199 atm = -199 * 101325 Pa = let's compute that.

199 * 1e5 is 19,900,000, but more accurately:

199 * 101325 = let's compute 200 * 101325 = 20,265,000, so 199 is 20,265,000 - 101,325 = 20,163,675. So P2 - P1 = -20,163,675 Pa.

So ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

Wait, wait, no: the formula is ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

Wait, but P2 is less than P1, so (P2 - P1) is negative. So:

ΔS = - (1.66e-5) * (7.09e-6) * (-20,163,675)

Compute each part step by step.

First, compute (P2 - P1): -20,163,675 Pa.

Then, multiply by V: 7.09e-6 m³/mol * (-20,163,675) = ?

Wait, 7.09e-6 * (-2.0163675e7) = let's calculate 7.09 * 2.0163675 ≈ 14.28, but since both exponents are e-6 and e7, when multiplied, we get e1 (10^1). So the product is approximately (7.09 * 2.0163675) * 10^( -6 +7 ) = 14.28 * 10^1 = 142.8. But wait, wait, exact calculation:

7.09e-6 * 2.0163675e7 = 7.09 * 2.0163675 * 1e1 (because 1e-6 *1e7 = 1e1)

7.09 * 2.0163675 ≈ let's compute 7 * 2.016 is about 14.112, and 0.09 * 2.016 ~ 0.181, so total ~14.293. So 14.293 * 10 = 142.93.

But since (P2-P1) is negative, it's -142.93.

So now, ΔS = - (1.66e-5) * (-142.93) = (1.66e-5) * 142.93.

Calculate 1.66e-5 * 142.93:

1.66 * 142.93 ≈ approx 237. So 237e-5 = 0.00237 J/K.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately:

1.66 * 142.93 = ?

1.66 * 140 = 232.4

1.66 * 2.93 ≈ 4.86

So total is about 232.4 +4.86 = 237.26

So 237.26e-5 = 0.0023726 J/K, which is 2.3726e-3 J/K.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.33e-3 J/K, option D is 3.01e-3, option H is 4.82e-3, etc.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula for entropy change.

Earlier, I thought that ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 ), but perhaps it's actually ΔS = α V (P1 - P2 )

Wait, because when P decreases, the system expands, and since α is positive, the entropy would increase. So in the formula, if P2 < P1, then (P2 - P1) is negative, and ΔS becomes positive, which is correct.

Wait, but let me re-examine the derivation:

From Maxwell's relations:

(∂S/∂P)_T = - (∂V/∂T)_P

So, dS = -(∂V/∂T)_P dP

Integrating from P1 to P2 at constant T:

ΔS = - (∂V/∂T)_P (P2 - P1 )

But (∂V/∂T)_P = α V, so:

ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

So yes, that's correct.

So, the calculation seems right. I got approx 2.37e-3 J/K, which is close to option B, which is 2.33e-3 J/K.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the molar volume. Let me recheck that.

Molar mass M of copper is 63.55 g/mol, which is 0.06355 kg/mol.

Density d is 8.96e3 kg/m³.

So V_m = M / d = 0.06355 / 8960 = let's compute this more accurately.

0.06355 ÷ 8960.

Let me compute 0.06355 / 8960:

First, 8960 = 8.96e3.

0.06355 / 8.96e3 = (0.06355 / 8.96) ) * 1e-3.

Compute 0.06355 ÷ 8.96:

Approximately, 8.96 × 0.007 = 0.06272. So 0.06355 - 0.06272 = 0.00083.

So 0.007 + (0.00083 / 8.96) ≈ 0.007 + 0.0000926 ≈ 0.0070926.

So V_m ≈ 0.0070926 * 1e-3 m³/mol = 7.0926e-6 m³/mol.

So that part was correct.

Then, when I calculated (P2 - P1) as -20,163,675 Pa, that's correct.

So, the product α * V * (P2 - P1) is:

1.66e-5 * 7.09e-6 * (-20,163,675) ?

Wait, no, more accurately, I think I may have miscalculated the earlier step.

Wait, wait. Wait, the calculation was:

ΔS = - α V (P2 - P1 )

Which is:

ΔS = - (1.66e-5 K^-1) * (7.09e-6 m³/mol) * (-20,163,675 Pa)

So the product of the three terms.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

First, compute α * V: 1.66e-5 * 7.09e-6 = 1.66 *7.09 = approx 11.77, and the exponents: 1e-5 * 1e-6 = 1e-11. So 11.77e-11 = 1.177e-10.

Then multiply by (P2 - P1) which is -20,163,675 Pa: 1.177e-10 * (-20,163,675) = ?

Wait, 1.177e-10 * 2.0163675e7 = (1.177 * 2.0163675) * 1e-3.

1.177 * 2.0163675 ≈ let's compute 1 * 2 = 2, 0.177 * 2 = 0.354, 1 * 0.0163675 ≈ 0.0163675, 0.177 * 0.0163675 ≈ ~0.002898. So adding up:

2 + 0.354 + 0.0163675 + 0.002898 ≈ 2.3732655.

So the product is 2.3732655 * 1e-3 = 0.0023732655.

But wait, (P2 - P1) is negative, so the product is -0.0023732655.

So then, ΔS = - ( -0.002373 ) = 0.002373 J/K, which is 2.373e-3 J/K.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.33e-3, and option D is 3.01e-3. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of significant figures or in the exact values.

Wait, let me check the exact value of (P2 - P1).

P1 = 200 atm = 200 * 101325 = 20,265,000 Pa.

P2 = 1 atm = 101,325 Pa.

So P2 - P1 = 101325 - 20,265,000 = -20,163,675 Pa.

So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the average volume during the process, but since the change in volume is small for solids, maybe using the initial volume is a valid approximation. I think that's what I did, using V = V1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the volume changes with pressure, but for solids, the change is minimal, so the approximation holds.

So the calculation leads me to approximately 2.37e-3 J/K, which is very close to option B, 2.33e-3. But why the slight discrepancy?

Let me check my calculation of α * V * (P2 - P1 )

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

1.66e-5 * 7.09e-6 = ?

1.66 * 7.09 = let's compute exactly:

1.66 * 7 = 11.62

1.66 * 0.09 = 0.1494

So total is 11.62 + 0.1494 = 11.7694.

So 1
