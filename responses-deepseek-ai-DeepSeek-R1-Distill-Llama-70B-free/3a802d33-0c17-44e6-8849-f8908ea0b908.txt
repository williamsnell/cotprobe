Question:

Discuss the influence of heredity on emotionalresponsivity for both animals and humans.

Options:

A: Heredity has no impact on emotional responsivity
B: Heredity provides a predisposition for emotional responsivity, but it is ultimately shaped by early childhood experiences
C: Heredity influences only basic emotions, while complex emotions are entirely learned
D: Emotional responsivity is not inherited, but learned
E: Environment solely influences emotional responsivity
F: Heredity is influential in emotional responsivity, as seen in animal and human studies demonstrating genetic influence on emotional reactions
G: Emotional responsivity is equally determined by heredity and environment with no variation among individuals
H: Emotional responsivity is a random process, not influenced by heredity or environment
I: Heredity determines emotional responsivity completely, with no role for the environment
J: Emotional responsivity is determined solely by individual learning experiences, with heredity playing no role

Okay, so I have this question about heredity and emotional responsivity in animals and humans. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me break it down.

The question is asking about the influence of heredity on emotional responsivity. I remember from my psychology classes that both genetics and environment play roles in behavior and emotions. So I think it's not just one or the other.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says heredity has no impact. That doesn't seem right because I've read about twin studies showing that genetics influence traits like personality, which includes emotional responses.

Option B suggests heredity provides a predisposition, but early childhood experiences shape it. I think that's a possibility. Like, you might have a genetic tendency to be more anxious, but your upbringing affects how that manifests.

Option C claims heredity affects only basic emotions, while complex ones are learned. I'm not sure about that. Basic emotions are universal, like happiness, fear, etc. But I think both basic and complex emotions have genetic components. Maybe environment influences the expression more for complex emotions, but I'm not certain.

Option D says emotional responsivity isn't inherited but learned. That contradicts what I remember about twin and family studies showing heritability in traits like neuroticism or emotional stability.

Option E states environment is the sole influence. No, that's probably wrong because we know genetics play a role too.

Option F says heredity influences emotional responsivity as seen in animal and human studies. That sounds familiar. I've heard about studies with animals where certain breeds or strains exhibit different emotional responses, and in humans, genetics affecting things like anxiety responses.

Option G claims equal determination by heredity and environment with no variation. That seems too absolute. I think the interaction is more nuanced, and variation exists because people have different combinations of genes and environments.

Option H says it's random, which doesn't make sense. There's definitely influence from both genes and environment.

Option I states heredity determines it completely. That's probably an overstatement. Even if there's a strong genetic component, environment still plays a role.

Option J says it's all about learning experiences, no heredity. Again, that's probably not right because genetics do have an influence.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is F. Heredity does influence emotional responsivity, and there's evidence from both animals and humans, like genetic studies showing predispositions to certain emotional reactions.

The correct answer is F: Heredity is influential in emotional responsivity, as seen in animal and human studies demonstrating genetic influence on emotional reactions.

Answer: F
