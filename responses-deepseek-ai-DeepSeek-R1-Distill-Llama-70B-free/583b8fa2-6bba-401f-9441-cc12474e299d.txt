Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much the standard molar enthalpy of SO₂(g) increases when the temperature rises from 298.15 K to 1500 K. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy change with temperature involves the heat capacity. Oh right, the formula is ΔH = ∫Cp dT from T1 to T2.

But wait, the question gives me Cp data varying with temperature. I think I need to integrate Cp with respect to temperature between those two points. Oh wait, but without the actual data provided, how can I compute it? Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the Cp is constant? Or perhaps the data is given in a table, but in this case, the user only provided the question prompt. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question mentions the "following data show how the standard molar constant-pressure heat capacity of SO₂ varies with temperature." But I don't see any data here. Oh, maybe I'm supposed to remember some standard values or perhaps the data isn't necessary because the answer choices are given. Or perhaps the question expects me to use the Cp as a function of T and integrate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use Kirchhoff's law, which relates the change in enthalpy with temperature when Cp is known. Kirchhoff's law states that the change in enthalpy of a reaction with temperature is given by the integral of Cp over that temperature range.

Wait, but without specific Cp values, how can I calculate this? Maybe the data is provided in a table that's not shown here. Since I don't have that data, maybe I should think about another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the average Cp over the temperature range. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the problem expects me to use the standard molar heat capacity at 298 K and assume it's constant. But that's probably not accurate, especially over such a large temperature range (from 298 to 1500 K). That's a big jump, so Cp probably changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the Cp as a function of T given by some polynomial, like the Shomate equation. But without the specific coefficients, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general approach to this problem. Normally, the enthalpy change ΔH is calculated by integrating Cp(T) dT from the initial temperature to the final temperature. So if Cp varies with T, I might need to break the integral into segments where Cp is constant or use an average.

Alternatively, perhaps the data provided gives Cp at different temperature intervals, so I can calculate the integral by summing each Cp multiplied by the temperature change in that interval.

But without the actual data, I can't do that. So maybe the problem is expecting me to use an average value of Cp over the temperature range. Let's think: Suppose the average Cp is, say, around 50 J/mol·K. Then the temperature change is 1500 - 298.15 = 1201.85 K. So 50 * 1201.85 ≈ 60,092.5 J/mol, which is about 60.1 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, E is 62.2, which is close. Or maybe the average is a bit higher.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Cp increases with temperature. So the average would be higher than the value at 298 K. For example, if Cp at 298 is about 39.7 J/mol·K (I think that's around the value for SO₂), but at higher temps, it's higher. Let me think: Maybe around 50 or 60 on average.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem uses the formula for enthalpy change when Cp is a function of T. Let me recall that the Shomate equation gives Cp in terms of T. But without the equation, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the formula ΔH = Cp_avg * ΔT. So if I can find the average Cp between 298 and 1500 K, multiply by the ΔT to get ΔH in kJ/mol.

But without data, I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to choose from the options based on standard data. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the integral using given data points, but since I don't have them, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible answers. Let's see: The options range from around 49 to 93 kJ/mol. The temperature change is about 1200 K. If the average Cp was, say, 50 J/K·mol, then 50 * 1200 = 60,000 J/mol, which is 60 kJ/mol. E is 62.2, which is close. But perhaps the average Cp is a bit higher, say around 52 J/K·mol. 52 * 1200 = 62400, which is 62.4, close to option E.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C, which is 67.8. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Cp increases with temperature, so the average is higher than the Cp at 298 K.

Wait, maybe I can remember that for many gases, Cp increases with temperature. At room temp, Cp for SO2 might be around 39 J/mol·K, but it could be higher at higher temps. Let's say it averages about 55 J/mol·K. Then 55 * 1200 = 66,000 J/mol, which is 66 kJ/mol. That would correspond to option C: 67.8, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation requires using the specific heat capacities at different intervals. For example, if the data is divided into two temperature ranges: say, from 298 to 1000 K, Cp is X, and from 1000 to 1500 K, Cp is Y. Then ΔH would be (X*(1000-298)) + (Y*(1500-1000)). But without the data, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the Cp is given as a function, and you have to integrate. But without the function, maybe I should make an educated guess. Alternatively, perhaps the standard value for the enthalpy increase from 298 to 1500 K for SO2 is known. But I don't have that memorized.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units. The options are in kJ/mol, so the answer is in that range. The temperature change is large, so the ΔH would be significant. If I had to choose between the options, I would think that the increase is around 60-70 kJ/mol. So looking at the options, E is 62.2, C is 67.8, I is 70.5.

Hmm, another thought: The standard molar enthalpy of formation of SO2 at 298 K is known, but that's not directly helpful here. The question is about the change in enthalpy with temperature, not formation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the formula for the enthalpy change when Cp is a function of T. The formula is ΔH = ∫(T1 to T2) Cp(T) dT. So without knowing Cp(T), I can't compute this. But since the options are given, I have to choose based on reasoning.

Wait, maybe the data is given in the problem, but in the user's message, it says "the following data" but I don't see any data here. So I might have to assume that the problem expects me to use a constant Cp. Let me think: What is the Cp of SO2 at 298 K? I think it's around 39.7 J/mol·K. So using that as a constant would give ΔH = 39.7 * (1500 - 298.15) = 39.7 * 1201.85 ≈ let's calculate that.

39.7 * 1200 is 47,640 J/mol. 39.7 * 1.85 is about 73.4 J/mol. So total is about 47,713 J/mol, which is 47.7 kJ/mol. But none of the options are that low; the lowest is option A:49.2, which is close but a bit higher. But this approach assumes Cp is constant, which it's not over such a wide range. So this must not be the correct approach.

Therefore, perhaps Cp increases with temperature, leading to a higher ΔH. So the correct answer would be higher than 47.7 kJ/mol. So options from 49 up. The options start at A:49.2, then D:54.9, G:58.1, etc.

Wait, but the actual Cp probably increases. For example, at higher temps, diatomic gases have higher Cp. Wait, but SO2 is a polyatomic gas, so maybe the Cp increases. So the average Cp would be higher than 39.7 J/K·mol.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cp at higher temps is around 60 J/K·mol. So 60 * 1200 = 72,000 J/mol = 72 kJ/mol. Hmm, but that's higher than some of the options. Wait, looking back, the highest option is J:93.4.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the integrated Cp. Let me try to think of the Cp as a function of T.

Wait, perhaps the data is given in the problem as a table, but the user didn't include it. So I can't proceed without that data. Therefore, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, another approach: The problem is asking for the increase in enthalpy when temperature increases. Enthalpy is a state function, so the change depends only on initial and final states. The formula is ΔH = H(final) - H(initial) = ∫Cp dT from T_initial to T_final.

Since I don't have the Cp data, perhaps the correct answer is option C:67.8 kJ/mol or E:62.2.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is given as a polynomial, like Cp = a + bT + cT^2, etc. But without the coefficients, I can't calculate.

Wait, perhaps I can recall that for SO₂, the molar heat capacity Cp at different temperatures is given, and perhaps the data is as follows (I'm making this up because I don't have the actual data, but perhaps in a typical problem, the data is broken into intervals):

For example:

Temperature range (K) | Cp (J/mol·K)
----------------------|-------------
298-400               | 39.7
400-900               | 56.0
900-1500              | 68.0

If that's the case, then the calculation would be:

From 298 to 400 K: ΔT1 = 102 K. ΔH1 = 39.7 * 102 = 4053.4 J/mol.

From 400 to 900 K: ΔT2 = 500 K. ΔH2 = 56.0 *500=28,000 J/mol.

From 900 to 1500 K: ΔT3=600 K. ΔH3=68.0*600=40,800 J/mol.

Total ΔH=4053.4 +28,000 +40,800=72,853.4 J/mol ≈72.85 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, the closest is option H:75.6 or I:70.5. Hmm, but my hypothetical data might not match.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cp increases more gradually. Let's say from 298 to 1000 K, Cp is 50 J/K·mol, and from 1000 to 1500, it's 60 J/K·mol.

ΔT1=702 K, ΔH1=50 *702=35100 J.

ΔT2=500 K, ΔH2=60*500=30,000 J.

Total=35100+30000=65100 J=65.1 kJ/mol. That's close to option C:67.8 or E:62.2.

Alternatively, maybe the Cp is higher on average. For instance, if the average is 55 J/K·mol, then 55 *1201.85≈ 66000 J=66 kJ/mol. That's close to option C:67.8 or E:62.2.

But without the actual data, it's hard to be precise. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the temperature dependence of Cp. Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem uses the fact that for an ideal gas, Cp can be approximated as a function of temperature, and the integral can be calculated using that function.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the Kirchhoff's law approach. But without the specific Cp values at each temperature, I can't compute the exact integral.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option E:62.2 kJ/mol. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation using the actual data would lead to option C:67.8.

Wait, another thought: The correct way to calculate this is to use the heat capacity data provided in the problem, which I don't have. Since the question gives options, perhaps the intended answer is around 62-67 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, E is 62.2 and C is 67.8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the enthalpy change for SO2. I recall that when calculating such changes, the Cp might be in the range of about 50-60 J/K·mol on average. So 50 J/K·mol * 1200 K is 60,000 J =60 kJ/mol. That's close to option E:62.2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if Cp is higher than 39.7, the average might be around 55. So 55 *1200=66,000 J=66 kJ/mol. Close to option C:67.8.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C:67.8. Alternatively, perhaps the data leads to that.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible answers. The options are:

A:49.2, B:85.7, C:67.8, D:54.9, E:62.2, F:78.3, G:58.1, H:75.6, I:70.5, J:93.4.

The likely candidates based on our earlier calculations are E (~62), C (~68), I (~70.5), and H (~75.6).

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E:62.2. Because if Cp increases gradually, maybe the average is around 51-52 J/K·mol, so 51.8 *1200=62,160 J/mol=62.16 kJ/mol, which matches option E.

Alternatively, perhaps the data leads to a value around 67.8, which is option C.

Wait, perhaps the data is given in the problem as a table, but since I don't have it, I can't compute. Therefore, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Another thought: Let's say the data is provided as a list of Cp values at different temperatures. For example, the problem might have given Cp at 298 K as 39.7, at 400 K as 44.8, at 600 K as 53.5, at 1000 K as 62.0, and at 1500 K as 70.2 J/mol·K. Then, the integral would be calculated by summing each segment.

But without the data, I can't proceed. So perhaps I should choose the answer that is calculated using an average Cp of around 52 J/K·mol, giving about 62.4 kJ/mol, which is option E:62.2.

Alternatively, considering that Cp increases, the average might be higher, leading to option C:67.8.

Hmm, I'm torn between options E and C. But considering that the temperature range is quite large, the average Cp is likely higher than 50. So perhaps the correct answer is C:67.8 kJ/mol.

Wait, another angle: The standard molar enthalpy change is the integral of Cp dT from T1 to T2. So to get this, you sum each Cp multiplied by the temperature interval.

Suppose the data gives Cp in three intervals:

From 298 to 1000 K: Cp = 50 J/mol·K.

From 1000 to 1500 K: Cp=70 J/mol·K.

Then ΔH = (1000-298.15)*50 + (1500-1000)*70.

So (701.85)*50 = 35092.5 J.

500 *70=35,000 J.

Total=35092.5 +35000=70092.5 J=70.09 kJ/mol. That would match option I:70.5.

But again, without the actual data, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the data is broken into more intervals with varying Cp. But without knowing, it's hard.

In an exam setting, if I can't compute the exact value, I might have to make an educated guess. Considering that, perhaps the answer is E:62.2 kJ/mol.

Wait, but I think I recall that the standard enthalpy increase for SO2 from 298 K to about 1500 K is around 62-63 kJ/mol. So perhaps option E is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:67.8. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible Cp values. For SO2 gas, the molar heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) increases with temperature. At room temperature, it's about 39.7 J/mol·K. At higher temperatures, it can go up to around 60 J/mol·K or more.

Assuming that the average Cp over the range is about 55 J/mol·K, then:

ΔH = 55 J/mol·K * (1500 - 298.15) K = 55 * 1201.85 ≈ 55 * 1200 = 66,000 J/mol =66 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option C is 67.8, which is close. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Wait, but 55*1201.85=55*(1200+1.85)=55*1200=66,000 + 55*1.85≈101.75. So total ≈66,101.75 J/mol =66.10 kJ/mol. That's close to 66.1, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C:67.8 and option I:70.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the average Cp is 56 J/mol·K. Then 56 *1201.85≈56*1200=67,200 +56*1.85≈103.6
