Okay, so I have this question about calculating the pI values for glycine, alanine, serine, and threonine using their pK' values. Hmm, I remember that the pI is the pH at which an amino acid has no net charge, right? So for amino acids with two ionizable groups, the pI is the average of the two pKa values. Wait, but wait—am I thinking about the right approach here?

Wait, the question gives me pK_1' and pK_2'. I think pK_1' is for the carboxyl group (alpha-COOH) and pK_2' is for the amino group (alpha-NH3+). So for neutral amino acids like glycine, alanine, serine, and threonine, which don't have any ionizable R groups, their pI should be the average of pK1 and pK2, right? Because those are the two groups that ionize.

But wait, let me think again. The pI is calculated as (pK1 + pK2) / 2 when the molecule has two ionizable groups. So yes, for these four amino acids, since they don't have any additional ionizable R groups, their pI is simply the average of the alpha-COOH and alpha-NH3+ pKa's.

Let me look at the data provided. The table lists pK_1' (alpha-COOH), pK_2' (alpha-NH3), and pK_R' (R-group) for each amino acid. For glycine, the values are 2.34 and 9.6. So the pI would be (2.34 + 9.6)/2. Let me compute that: 2.34 + 9.6 is 11.94. Divided by 2, that's 5.97. So glycine's pI is 5.97.

Next, alanine has pK1' 2.34 and pK2' 9.96. Adding them gives 12.3, divided by 2 is 6.15. Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-calculate. 2.34 + 9.96 is 12.3, divided by 2 is 6.15. But looking at the options, I need to see which options match.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: glycine 6.77, alanine 6.82. No, that's higher than what I got for glycine. My calculation for glycine is 5.97, which matches option I's glycine value of 5.97. Option I: glycine 5.97, alanine 6.02, serine 5.68, threonine 6.53.

Wait, but let's do each calculation step by step.

Glycine: (2.34 + 9.6)/2 = 5.97.

Alanine: (2.34 + 9.96)/2 = (12.3)/2 = 6.15. Hmm, why is this? Because 2.34 +9.96 is 12.3. 12.3/2 is 6.15. But looking at the options, which one has alanine's pI as 6.15? Let me check each option.

Option C: glycine 6.97, which is way higher. So no. Option I for alanine is 6.02. Hmm, that's lower than 6.15. Did I miscalculate?

Wait wait, perhaps the pKa2 for alanine is 9.96, correct? So 2.34 + 9.96 = 12.3, divided by 2 is 6.15. So the pI for alanine should be 6.15. Hmm, but looking at the options, which option's alanine is around 6.15? Let's see.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Alanine pI is 6.82. No.

Option C: Alanine 7.02. No.

Option E: Alanine 4.52. No.

Option F: Alanine 5.82. No.

Option G: Alanine 6.52. Closer, but not 6.15.

Option I: Alanine 6.02. Hmm, that's lower than our calculated 6.15. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, pI is calculated as the average of the two pKa's for the alpha COOH and alpha NH3 groups only. So for alanine, pK1 is 2.34, pK2 is 9.96. So (2.34 + 9.96)/2 = 6.15.

Looking at the options, is there any option where alanine's pI is 6.15? Let me see:

Option I: Alanine 6.02. Close, but a bit lower.

Option G: Alanine 6.52. Hmm, higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Another thought: for amino acids without an R group that ionizes, pI is the average of pK1 and pK2. So I'm correct in that approach.

Wait, let's proceed with the others and see.

Serine: pK1' is 2.21, pK2' is 9.15. So pI is (2.21 +9.15)/2 = (11.36)/2=5.68.

Threonine: pK1' is 2.63, pK2' is 10.43. So (2.63 +10.43)/2 = 13.06/2=6.53.

So compiling these:

Gly:5.97, Ala:6.15, Ser:5.68, Thr:6.53.

Looking at the options to find the one that matches.

Option I: Gly:5.97, Ala:6.02, Ser:5.68, Thr:6.53.

Hmm, our calculated values for Gly (5.97), Ser (5.68), and Thr (6.53) match exactly with option I. But for Alanine, our calculation is 6.15, but option I has 6.02. So that's a discrepancy. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for alanine. Let me recheck. 2.34 + 9.96 is 12.3, divided by 2 is 6.15. That's correct. So why does option I have 6.02? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the values in the table are different? Let me recheck the table.

Looking back:

Alanine's pK_1' is 2.34, pK_2' is 9.96, pK_R' is nothing (since it's not listed, so R group doesn't ionize).

So yes, for alanine, pI is (2.34 +9.96)/2=6.15. But option I lists alanine's pI as 6.02. That's 0.13 lower. Hmm.

Wait, is there any chance that the pK values are actually for the conjugate acids? Because sometimes pKa can be presented as the acid (like for the COOH group, which donates a proton, so pKa is for -COOH → -COO^- + H+). Similarly, for the NH3+ group, the pKa is for NH3+ donating a proton to become NH2. So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me recheck the table:

Looking at the data: yes, Gly: pK_1' 2.34, pK_2' 9.6. So 5.97.

Ala: pK_1' 2.34, pK_2' 9.96. So (2.34 +9.96)=12.3, divided by 2=6.15.

Ser: pK_1' 2.21, pK_2'9.15 →5.68.

Thr: pK_1'2.63, pK_2'10.43 →6.53.

Looking at the options, which one has Gly:5.97, Ser:5.68, Thr:6.53, and Ala near 6.15.

Option I has Gly:5.97, Ser:5.68, Thr:6.53, but Ala is 6.02. That's a bit off. Wait, but perhaps the table's pK_2' is for the R group? No, no, the table's headers are pK_1' (alpha-COOH), pK_2' (alpha-NH3'), pK_R' (R-group).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the pI for amino acids with only two pKa's is the average of the two, but maybe I should have considered the alpha-amino group as the second pKa? No, I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps the given pK's are pK' values for the conjugate acids? So for the alpha COOH group, pK1' is the pKa of the COO^- group, which would be the same as the pKa for the -COOH. Similarly, pK2' is for the NH3+ group losing a proton. So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, but then why is option I the only one that matches three of the four correctly, except for alanine? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait another angle: perhaps the pI is calculated using the pKa values of the amino and carboxyl groups, but sometimes people use pKa1 as the carboxyl and pKa2 as the amino. Yes, that's what I did.

Let me check the options again. Option I's alanine is 6.02. Which is (2.34 + 9.68)/2= (12.02)/2=6.01, which is close to 6.02. But in the table, alanine's pK2' is 9.96, not 9.68. So perhaps the data in the table was presented differently.

Wait, perhaps I read the table wrong. Let me recheck. The table lists for Alanine: pK_1' 2.34, pK_2' 9.96, and I think pK_R' is not applicable here. So I'm correct in using 2.34 and 9.96.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. 2.34 plus 9.96 is 12.3. Divided by 2 is 6.15. So the correct pI for alanine is 6.15. Now, looking back at the options, none of them have alanine at 6.15 except maybe option G, which has alanine at 6.52. No, that's higher.

Wait, maybe I need to look at each option's values:

Option I: Gly:5.97, Ala:6.02, Ser:5.68, Thr:6.53.

So Gly: matches my calculation.

Ser: matches.

Thr: matches.

Only Ala doesn't. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for Ala. Let me check again.

Wait, 2.34 (pK1') plus 9.96 (pK2') equals 12.3. 12.3 divided by 2 is 6.15. So Ala's pI should be 6.15. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the table.

Wait, looking back at the table, perhaps I read the pK values for different amino acids. Let me recheck.

Looking at the table:

Glycine: 2.34, 9.6.

Alanine: 2.34, 9.96.

Leucine: 2.36,9.60.

Serine: 2.21,9.15.

Threonine:2.63,10.43.

Wait, so Alanine's pK2' is 9.96, so the calculation is 6.15.

Looking at the options for Alanine's pI:

Option A: 6.82 → no.

Option B:5.02 → no.

Option C:7.02 → no.

Option D:5.32 → no.

Option E:4.52 → no.

Option F:5.82 → no.

Option G:6.52 → no.

Option H:7.52 → no.

Option I:6.02 → close but not exact.

Option J:5.52 → no.

Hmm, none of the options have alanine at 6.15. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the pI is calculated using the average of the pKa of the carboxyl group and the pKa of the amino group when the amino group is acting as an acid. But wait, the amino group's pKa is for NH3+ losing a proton. So for pI calculation, it's correct to take the two alpha group pKa's and average them.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the pKa's given are pK' at a different temperature or condition. But the question states it's at 25°C, so that's standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the pI is the average of the pKa when the molecule is in the zwitterionic form. Wait, no, that's handled by taking the average of the two alpha pKa's.

Wait, perhaps I missed that some of these amino acids have additional ionizable groups, but no, glycine, alanine, serine, and threonine don't have ionizable R groups. So their pI is the average of the two alpha pKa's.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where three of the four values match, and the fourth is close. Let's see:

Option I has Gly:5.97 (correct), Ser:5.68 (correct), Thr:6.53 (correct), and Ala:6.02.

Hmm, but our calculation for Ala is 6.15, which is 0.13 higher than option I's 6.02. So perhaps that's a typo in the options, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the data for alanine in the table. Let me recheck: pK_1' is 2.34, pK_2' is 9.96. So yes, 2.34 +9.96 is 12.3, divided by 2 is 6.15.

So none of the options have alanine at 6.15. Hmm, but perhaps I should reevaluate the approach.

Wait, maybe the pI is calculated as the average of the pKa values that are relevant. For alanine, the two pKa's are for the COOH and NH3+ groups. So their average is correct.

Wait, perhaps the data in the table is correct, but the options are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in addition.

Wait, 2.34 +9.96 is 12.3? Yes, because 2 +9 is 11, 0.34 + 0.96 is 1.3, so 11+1.3=12.3. Divided by 2 is 6.15.

Wait, perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that sometimes the pI is taken as the average of the pKa's of the two adjacent groups. Wait, but that's exactly what I did.

Wait, another possibility: for amino acids, sometimes the pKa of the amino group is the pKb? No, no, because the table lists pK_2' as the alpha-NH3', so that's the pKa for the -NH3+ group donating a proton, which is correct for the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the pKa values are given for 37°C, but the question says 25°C. But the table says 25°C, so that's consistent.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed. Among the options, option I matches three of the four calculated pI values exactly, except alanine, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for alanine.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me calculate all four pI values and see which option has all four correct.

Gly: (2.34 +9.6)/2=5.97.

Ala: (2.34 +9.96)/2=6.15.

Ser: (2.21 +9.15)/2=11.36/2=5.68.

Thr: (2.63 +10.43)/2=13.06/2=6.53.

So the four pI values are: 5.97, 6.15, 5.68, 6.53.

Now, looking at the options:

Option I: Gly:5.97, Ala:6.02, Ser:5.68, Thr:6.53.

That's very close except for alanine being 6.02 instead of 6.15.

Option G: Gly:6.47, which is higher than our 5.97.

Option C: Gly:6.97, which is way off.

Option A: Gly:6.77, also higher.

Option F: Gly:5.77, which is lower.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, and the discrepancy in alanine is due to rounding. Let me see: 6.15 is 6.15, but perhaps in the table, the values are given to two decimal places, so perhaps the actual pK2' for alanine is 9.95, which would bring the average to (2.34 +9.95)=12.29, divided by 2 is 6.145, which would round to 6.14 or 6.15. So perhaps option I's 6.02 is incorrect, but the other values match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the pKa values for alanine in the table. Let me see:

The table lists for Alanine: pK_1' 2.34, pK_2' 9.96. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I, and the alanine value is a typo. Because all the other three match perfectly. Let me look at the other options:

Option I: Gly 5.97, which is correct. Ser 5.68, correct. Thr 6.53, correct. Only Ala is 6.02, which is 0.13 lower than our calculation. Maybe the options rounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the
