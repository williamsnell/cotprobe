The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."…
We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.
We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.…
We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.

Okay, so I've got this history question here about President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his response to Senator Huey P. Long's political challenges. I'm a bit rusty on my U.S. history, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, I need to understand the context. The question references a speech by Senator Huey Long from 1934. From what I remember, Long was a populist who proposed radical economic reforms. His "Share Our Wealth Society" aimed to redistribute wealth by limiting the amount the wealthy could have. The speech talks about capping individual wealth at $50 million and ensuring every family has at least $5,000, which is about providing a basic standard of living.

Now, the question is about how FDR responded to this challenge. I know that Roosevelt was president during the Great Depression and implemented a series of reforms known as the New Deal. But there were two phases: the First New Deal and the Second New Deal.

I think the First New Deal was more about immediate relief and recovery, with programs like the NRA (National Recovery Administration) and the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps). But the Second New Deal, which started around 1935, focused more on reform and social welfare. That's when Social Security was introduced, right?

So, Senator Long's proposals were part of the political challenges FDR faced. Long's message was popular because many people were suffering, and his plan to redistribute wealth resonated with those who felt the economic system was unfair. FDR, wanting to maintain support and address these issues without going as far as Long proposed, might have accelerated or expanded his reform agenda.

Looking at the options, option C says "Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security." That makes sense because the Second New Deal included more progressive reforms. Social Security was a key part of that, providing a safety net and addressing poverty, which aligns with Long's concerns but in a more moderate way.

Other options don't seem right. Option A talks about abolishing Social Security, which is the opposite of what FDR did. Option B about not running for re-election doesn't fit the timeline. Option D and E are about diverting attention with military actions, but that's more related to WWII, which was later. Option F is Long's policy, so FDR wouldn't propose that. Option G is about limiting wealth, which FDR might have considered but didn't actually implement as Long suggested. Option H is opposing redistribution, which doesn't fit because FDR did implement some redistributive policies. Option I is a minimum income, which Social Security partially addressed but wasn't exactly a guaranteed minimum. Option J is about cutting taxes and deregulating, which is more of a conservative approach, not FDR's New Deal.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C. FDR responded by launching the Second New Deal, which included significant legislation like Social Security to address the issues Long raised.

The correct answer is C: Launching the Second New Deal, a series of legislative acts including Social Security.
