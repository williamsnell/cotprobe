The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A bank teller was on trial for embezzlement. The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?

Options:

A: Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.
B: No, because the records are considered public documents and do not need further authentication.
C: No, because the defense did not provide any counter evidence to dispute the records.
D: Yes, because the prosecution must also prove the bank teller had access to manipulate these records.
E: Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.
F: No, because the records are self-authenticating and do not require additional proof of authenticity.
G: No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.
H: Yes, because the prosecution failed to provide a chain of custody for the records.
I: No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.
J: Yes, because the records must be certified by a public official, not just a bank employee.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The scenario is a bank teller on trial for embezzlement. The prosecution is offering the bank's daily deposit and tally records for six months. They want to show that the deposits didn't reconcile, which I guess would indicate some kind of discrepancy that might point to embezzlement.

The issue is that the prosecution is trying to enter these records as exhibits without getting certification or having the testimony of an official bank custodian. The defense objected, saying hearsay. So the question is whether the court would find the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity.

I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But there are exceptions to this rule. One of the main exceptions is the business records exception under FRE 803(6). Business records are admissible if they were made at or near the time of the event, kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity, and making the record was a regular practice of that activity. Also, there's usually a requirement that the source of the information be trustworthy.

So for business records, the proponent typically needs to authenticate them. That can be done through the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or through a certification that meets specific requirements. I think under FRE 902(11), records of a regularly conducted activity can be self-authenticating if they have a certification from the custodian or another qualified person.

In this case, the prosecution didn't get a certification or have the custodian testify. So without that, are the records admissible? I think the answer depends on whether they qualify as self-authenticating under another rule or if they fall under another exception.

Wait, another thought: public records. FRE 803(8) covers public records and reports. These are records of a public office or agency, like government records. But bank records are not public records; they're private business records. So the public records exception wouldn't apply here. So option B, which says they're public documents, is probably incorrect.

Option E says bank records aren't included in the business records exception, but that's not right. Bank records are a classic example of business records that do fall under the exception. So E is wrong.

Option G says business records kept regularly are allowed without further qualification. I think that's not entirely accurate because there's still the authentication requirement. The records must be authenticated, which usually requires someone to testify or a certification. So G's reasoning might be incorrect.

Option A says a qualified bank employee must authenticate them in person or provide a certification. That sounds right because without authentication, the records might be inadmissible. So the court would likely require that step.

Option F says the records are self-authenticating. Wait, I thought that self-authenticating under FRE 902(11) requires a certification. So without that, they aren't self-authenticating. So F is incorrect.

Option D talks about proving the teller had access. I don't think that's the issue here; the issue is authentication, not whether the teller could have manipulated the records.

Option I says the trial court has discretion. While courts do have some leeway, the rules usually require authentication. So I don't think the court can just let them in without proper authentication.

Option J mentions certification by a public official, but bank records are private, so a bank employee's certification should suffice under the rules. So J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is A. The court would require authentication, either through testimony or a proper certification, without which the evidence would be inadmissible.

The question revolves around the admissibility of bank records in a criminal trial under the hearsay rule and its exceptions. The prosecution offered the bank's daily deposit and tally records without certification or testimony from the custodian, prompting a hearsay objection from the defense. The key issue is whether the records can be admitted without further proof of authenticity.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), business records are admissible under the hearsay exception in FRE 803(6) if they were made at or near the time of the event, kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity, and if making the record was a regular practice of that activity. Additionally, authentication is typically required, which can be done through the testimony of the custodian, another qualified witness, or a certification under FRE 902(11). Without such authentication, the records may not be admissible.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. A qualified bank employee must authenticate the records, either through testimony or certification, as required by the rules.
- **B**: Incorrect. Bank records are not public documents; they are private business records.
- **C**: Incorrect. The admissibility does not depend on the defense providing counter evidence.
- **D**: Incorrect. The issue is authentication, not whether the teller had access to the records.
- **E**: Incorrect. Bank records are included in the business records exception under FRE 803(6).
- **F**: Incorrect. Records are not self-authenticating without a certification under FRE 902(11).
- **G**: Incorrect. Authentication is still required, even for regularly kept business records.
- **H**: Incorrect. The issue is authentication, not the chain of custody.
- **I**: Incorrect. While courts have discretion, authentication is generally required under the rules.
- **J**: Incorrect. Certification by a bank employee, not a public official, is sufficient for private records.

The correct answer is **A**, as authentication is necessary for the admissibility of the records.
