Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychosomatic disorders and their treatment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what psychosomatic disorders are. From what I remember, the term "psychosomatic" combines "psyche" (mind) and "soma" (body). So it's about the mind affecting the body. I think these are conditions where psychological factors contribute to physical symptoms or illnesses. Like, stress causing stomach ulcers or something like that.

Looking at the options, I can eliminate some. Option A says they're mental illnesses with no physical symptoms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because psychosomatic implies physical symptoms. So A is probably wrong. Option C says they're purely physical, but that contradicts the idea that the mind is involved. So C is out.

Option D says they're imaginary diseases. No, that's not right. People with psychosomatic disorders do have real physical symptoms; it's not just in their head. D is wrong. Option E says diagnosed only through physical exams and treated with surgery. But since psychological factors are involved, treatment should include psychological methods too, so E is incorrect.

Option F mentions genetic disorders and gene therapy. I don't think psychosomatic disorders are purely genetic. They're more about the interaction between mind and body, so F is probably wrong. Option H talks about spiritual imbalances. I'm not sure, but I think the focus is more on psychological factors, not spiritual, so H might not be the right choice.

Option I says cured only by medication. Again, since both mind and body are involved, treatment would likely include both medical and psychological approaches. So I is probably incorrect. Option J links it to nutritional deficiencies. While diet can play a role, I don't think that's the main cause of psychosomatic disorders. So J is likely wrong.

That leaves me with option G. Let's read G again: "A psychosomatic disorder is one in which an individual's psychological problems are a major factor in an organic pathology. The treatment is both medical and psychological." That sounds right. It combines both aspects, which makes sense because the mind affects the body, so treatment should address both.

Wait, but what's "organic pathology"? I think it refers to a physical condition or disease, not just imaginary symptoms. So yes, G fits. The treatment being both medical (like drugs) and psychological (like therapy) makes sense because you need to address both the physical symptoms and the underlying psychological issues.

So I'm pretty confident that G is the correct answer.

The correct answer is G because psychosomatic disorders involve psychological factors contributing to physical symptoms, requiring a combination of medical and psychological treatments.

Answer: G
