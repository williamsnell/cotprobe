Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear reactions, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that B^10 is bombarded with neutrons, and alpha particles are emitted. I need to find the residual nucleus from the given options.

Hmm, so B^10 is Boron-10. Its atomic number is 5 because Boron is element 5. When it's bombarded with neutrons, which have no charge, so the reaction involves a neutron hitting the Boron nucleus.

Wait, the reaction would be something like Boron plus a neutron emitting an alpha particle. So the general form would be: B^10 + n → residual nucleus + alpha particle.

An alpha particle is helium nucleus, which is ^4_2He. So in the reaction, we emit that.

I think I should set up the equation and balance it. Let me write the reaction:

^10_5B + ^1_0n → residual nucleus (let's call it X) + ^4_2He.

Now, to balance the equation, I need to ensure that the mass numbers and the atomic numbers add up on both sides.

On the left side, the mass number is 10 (from B) plus 1 (neutron) = 11. The atomic number is 5 (from B) plus 0 (neutron, since it's neutral) =5.

On the right side, the alpha particle is mass 4 and charge +2. So the residual nucleus X must have a mass number of 11-4=7. Because 10+1=11, and 4 is taken by the alpha, so 11-4=7.

For the atomic number, X's charge plus 2 (from alpha) should equal 5. So X's charge is 5-2=3.

So the residual nucleus should have a mass number of 7 and atomic number 3. What element is that? Let me think, atomic number 3 is Lithium, Li.

So the nucleus is ^7_3Li. Let me check the options.

Looking back at the options, option H is ^7_3Li. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Boron-10 plus a neutron gives a total mass of 11. When an alpha (mass 4) is emitted, the residual is mass 7. Atomic number: 5 (B) plus 0 (n) is 5. Alpha has +2, so the residual must be 3, which is Li. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the residual nucleus is ^7_3Li, which is option H.
</think>

To determine the residual nucleus when B^10 is bombarded with neutrons and alpha particles are emitted, we analyze the reaction:

\[
^{10}_5\text{B} + ^{1}_0\text{n} \rightarrow \text{X} + ^{4}_2\text{He}.
\]

### Step 1: Balance the mass numbers
- The mass number on the left is \(10 + 1 = 11\).
- The alpha particle has a mass number of 4, so the residual nucleus \(X\) must have a mass number of \(11 - 4 = 7\).

### Step 2: Balance the atomic numbers
- The atomic number on the left is \(5 + 0 = 5\).
- The alpha particle has an atomic number of 2, so the residual nucleus \(X\) must have an atomic number of \(5 - 2 = 3\).

### Step 3: Identify the residual nucleus
- A nucleus with a mass number of 7 and an atomic number of 3 corresponds to Lithium-7, or \(^{7}_3\text{Li}\).

### Step 4: Verify the answer
From the given options, \(^{7}_3\text{Li}\) matches option **H**.

Thus, the residual nucleus is **H: \(^{7}_3\text{Li}\)**.
