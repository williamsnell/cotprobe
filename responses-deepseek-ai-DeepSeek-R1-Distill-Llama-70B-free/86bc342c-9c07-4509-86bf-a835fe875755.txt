Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the dipole moment of gaseous SO₂ using its dielectric constants at two different temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the dielectric constant is related to the polarizability of a gas. Oh right, the Clausius-Mossotti relation, or maybe it's the Debye equation. Wait, let me think. The Debye model is for polar gases, right? Because SO₂ is a polar molecule, so it should have a permanent dipole moment contributing to the dielectric constant.

The formula I recall is something like the dielectric constant ε = 1 + something involving the dipole moment. Oh yeah, the relation involves the number of molecules per unit volume and their dipole moments. Let me try to write down the formula.

I think it's ε = 1 + (4π/3kT) * (N/V) * μ², where μ is the dipole moment. Wait, no, wait. Wait, there's another term for polar gases. Oh right, the Debye formula for the dielectric constant at low pressures (since gases are considered) is ε = 1 + (4π/3) * (N/V) * α, where α is the polarizability. But wait, for polar gases, the polarizability includes both the distortion (electronic) polarizability and the orientation (dipole) effect.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molar polarization. Oh right, the molar polarization P is given by P = (ε - 1)/(ε + 2) * RT/(P), where P is pressure. But wait, in an ideal gas, PV = nRT, so n/V = P/(RT). So substituting that into the polarization equation.

Alternatively, the Debye equation for a gas at low density (so ε is close to 1) can be written as ε - 1 = (4π/3) * (n/ V) * (α + (μ²)/(3kT)), where n/V is the number density.

Wait, but in this problem, ε is given as just a bit above 1, so maybe we can approximate ε - 1 as being proportional to the dipole term. Or perhaps we can use the formula for the molar polarization, which is (ε - 1)/(ε + 2) * RT/P, and that should equal (4π/3) * (α + μ²/(3kT)).

Wait, let me check the exact formulas. The molar polarization is P_m = (ε - 1)/(ε + 2) * (RT/P). For an ideal gas, P_m is given by P_m = 4π/3 (α + μ²/(3kT)). So combining these, we have:

(ε - 1)/(ε + 2) * (RT/P) = (4π/3)(α + μ²/(3kT)).

But since SO₂ is a polar gas, the main contribution is from the dipole term. However, I'm not sure if at these temperatures the induced dipole (α term) can be neglected. But wait, the problem states that we should assume ideal gas behavior, which probably simplifies things, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's see. Since we have two different temperatures, maybe we can set up two equations and solve for μ. Let me write down the expressions.

At T1 = 273 K, ε1 = 1.00993.

At T2 = 373 K, ε2 = 1.00569.

So, for each temperature, the molar polarization P_m would be:

P_m1 = (ε1 - 1)/(ε1 + 2) * (R*T1)/P.

Similarly,

P_m2 = (ε2 - 1)/(ε2 + 2) * (R*T2)/P.

Since pressure P is 1 atm, which is the same in both cases.

Now, each P_m is also equal to (4π/3) (α + μ²/(3k T)).

Wait, but since SO₂ is a polar molecule, the α term is probably negligible compared to the μ²/(3kT) term. Or is that only for certain conditions? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the α term is the same at both temperatures, so when we subtract the two P_m equations, that term will cancel.

Wait, let me think. Let me write:

P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π/3) [ (α + μ²/(3k T1) ) - (α + μ²/(3k T2) ) ) ]

Which simplifies to (4π/3) ( μ²/(3k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So,

P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π μ²)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2)

Wait, but I can compute P_m1 and P_m2 from the given ε values and temperatures.

Let me compute each step.

First, compute P_m1:

ε1 = 1.00993, so ε1 -1 = 0.00993.

ε1 + 2 = 3.00993.

So (ε1-1)/(ε1+2) = 0.00993 / 3.00993 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.00993 / 3.00993 ≈ approximately 0.003299.

Since R is the gas constant, 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T1 is 273 K.

P is 1 atm.

So P_m1 = (0.003299) * (0.0821 * 273) / 1.

Calculating 0.0821 * 273 = approx 22.41 L·atm/mol.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the formula is (ε-1)/(ε+2) * RT/P. So P_m1 = (ε1-1)/(ε1+2) * (R T1)/P.

Yes, so R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T1 is 273 K, P is 1 atm.

So (ε1-1)/(ε1+2) is approximately 0.003299.

So P_m1 = 0.003299 * 0.0821 * 273 / 1.

Wait, 0.0821 * 273 ≈ 22.41.

So 0.003299 * 22.41 ≈ 0.0740 L·atm/mol.

Wait no, wait. Wait, 0.003299 is (ε-1)/(ε+2) = approx 0.003299.

So P_m1 = 0.003299 * (0.0821 * 273) atm⁻¹ * L/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let me compute each value more accurately.

Compute (ε1 -1) = 0.00993.

(ε1 + 2) = 3.00993.

So (ε1-1)/(ε1+2) = 0.00993 / 3.00993.

Let me compute this:

0.00993 ÷ 3.00993 = ?

Dividing 0.00993 by 3.00993. Let's compute:

3.00993 ≈ 3.01.

0.00993 / 3.01 ≈ 0.003299.

So yes, approximately 0.003299.

Now, R*T1 = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 273 K = 0.0821 * 273.

Calculate 0.08 * 273 = 21.84, 0.0021 * 273 = 0.5733, so total 22.4133 L·atm/mol.

So P_m1 = 0.003299 * 22.4133 ≈ 0.07406 L·atm/mol.

Similarly, compute P_m2.

ε2 = 1.00569.

ε2 -1 = 0.00569.

ε2 + 2 = 3.00569.

(ε2-1)/(ε2+2) = 0.00569 / 3.00569 ≈ 0.001894.

So 0.00569 ÷ 3.00569 = approx 0.001894.

Now, R*T2 = 0.0821 * 373.

0.08 * 373 = 29.84, 0.0021 * 373 ≈ 0.7833, so total ≈ 30.6233 L·atm/mol.

So P_m2 = 0.001894 * 30.6233 ≈ 0.05804 L·atm/mol.

So now, P_m1 ≈ 0.07406 and P_m2 ≈ 0.05804.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Because the formula is (ε-1)/(ε+2) * (RT)/P. So for P_m, units would be (unitless)/(unitless) * (L·atm/mol·K * K) / atm = L/mol.

Wait, that's correct, so units should be L/mol.

Now, according to the earlier expression, P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π μ²)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, let me write the equation again:

P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π μ²)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, but from earlier, I thought P_m is equal to (4π/3)(α + μ²/(3kT)).

Wait, but if I subtract P_m2 from P_m1, the α terms would cancel, assuming α doesn't change with temperature, which it probably doesn't much. So:

P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π/3)( (μ²/(3k T1)) - (μ²/(3k T2)) )

Which is (4π μ²)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So, P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π μ²)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So, I can solve for μ².

So, let's compute the left-hand side and the right-hand side.

Compute LHS: P_m1 - P_m2 = 0.07406 - 0.05804 = 0.01602 L/mol.

Now, compute the RHS coefficient: (4π)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, what's the value of k? Boltzmann's constant, right? But wait, in what units? Because R is in L·atm/mol·K, and I'm working in cgs units perhaps. Wait, perhaps it's better to use SI units here.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should use the relation between R and k. Since R = N_A k, where N_A is Avogadro's number.

Wait, let me think. Let's make sure about the units.

Wait, the molar polarization P_m is in L·atm/mol. The factor 4π μ²/(9k) would have units, but let me check.

Wait, perhaps using units where k is in J/K, R in J/mol·K.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything into SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that uses R and avoids k.

Wait, let me think again. The equation is:

P_m = (4π/3) ( α + (μ²)/(3kT) )

But for two temperatures, T1 and T2, subtracting:

P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π/3) * ( (μ²)/(3k T1) - (μ²)/(3k T2) )

= (4π μ²)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So,

μ² = [ (P_m1 - P_m2) * 9k ] / [4π (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

Wait, that's the formula.

Now, I need to compute this.

I have:

P_m1 - P_m2 = 0.01602 L·atm/mol

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.

But wait, the units need to be consistent. Let me see.

Wait, in the equation, 4π μ²/(9k) has units of (C² m²)/(J), since k is J/K, but maybe I'm getting the units wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert P_m from L·atm/mol to m³·Pa/mol.

Because 1 L = 0.001 m³, 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So, P_m1 - P_m2 is 0.01602 L·atm/mol.

Convert to m³·Pa/mol:

0.01602 L·atm = 0.01602 * 0.001 m³ * 101325 Pa =

0.01602 * 101.325e-3 = 0.01602 * 0.101325 ≈ 0.0016229 m³·Pa.

So, P_m1 - P_m2 ≈ 0.0016229 m³·Pa/mol.

Wait, wait no, because P_m is in L·atm/mol, so 0.01602 L·atm/mol is 0.01602 * 0.001 m³ * 101325 Pa / mol.

So 0.01602 * 0.001 = 1.602e-5 m³.

Multiply by 101325 Pa: 1.602e-5 * 101325 ≈ 1.6229 m³·Pa/mol.

Wait, that seems high. Let me compute it accurately.

0.01602 L·atm/mol * (1 m³ = 1000 L) → 0.01602 * 1000 = 16.02 L·atm/mol to m³·atm.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps using the ideal gas law, in terms of SI units, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should find a formula that uses R instead of k.

Wait, another approach: use the relation between P_m and μ, using SI units.

The formula I found earlier is:

P_m = (4π/3) ( n (μ²)/(3kT) )

But wait, n is the number density, which for an ideal gas is P/(k T), since PV = Nk T, so n = N/V = P/(k T).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the Debye formula for the dielectric constant.

The Debye equation for a gas is:

(ε - 1)/(ε + 2) = (4π/3) * (n α + n (μ²)/(3kT) )

But for a gas, n = N/V = P/(RT), because PV = nRT → n = P/(RT).

So substituting n,

(ε - 1)/(ε + 2) = (4π/3) * ( (P/(RT)) α + (P/(RT)) (μ²)/(3kT) )

Simplify:

= (4π P)/(3 R T) [ α + (μ²)/(3k T) ]

But since P is 1 atm, maybe we can keep it as is for now.

But this seems a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula for calculating dipole moments from dielectric constants.

Wait, I think the formula used is:

(ε - 1)/(ε + 2) = (4π/3) * (n α + n μ²/(3kT))

And for gases, ε is close to 1, so we can approximate (ε - 1)/(ε + 2) ≈ (ε -1)/3.

So, then,

(ε -1)/3 ≈ (4π/3) * (n α + n μ²/(3kT))

But I think for polar gases, the term with μ² is dominant, especially at lower temperatures. Wait, but in our case, the dielectric constant at higher temperature is lower. Hmm, that makes sense because as temperature increases, the thermal motion reduces the alignment of dipoles, so the dielectric constant decreases.

So, perhaps the μ² term is indeed dominant, so maybe I can neglect the α term. But I'm not entirely sure. But given that the problem provides two different temperatures, maybe the α term can be considered independent of temperature and subtracted out.

Wait, earlier I thought of subtracting P_m1 and P_m2 to eliminate the α term. So let's proceed with that.

So, to recap:

P_m1 - P_m2 = (4π μ²)/(9k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

We have:

P_m1 = 0.07406 L·atm/mol

P_m2 = 0.05804 L·atm/mol

So P_m1 - P_m2 = 0.01602 L·atm/mol.

We need to convert this to SI units. Let me see:

1 L·atm = 101325 Pa * 0.001 m³ = 101.325 J.

So, 1 L·atm/mol = 101.325 J/mol.

So, 0.01602 L·atm/mol = 0.01602 * 101.325 J/mol ≈ 1.6229 J/mol.

Wait, but wait, the P_m is molar polarization, which has units of volume (since it's related to polarizability). Wait, no, actually, molar polarization P_m is in units of m³/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion earlier. Let me think again.

The molar polarization P_m is given by (ε -1)/(ε +2) * RT/P.

Units of R are J/(mol·K), T is K, P is Pa.

So, (unitless) * (J/(mol·K) * K) / Pa = (J/mol) / Pa.

But J = N·m = Pa·m³, so J/Pa = m³. So units are m³/mol.

So P_m has units of m³/mol.

So, for P_m1, let's compute it in m³/mol.

Compute (ε1 -1)/(ε1 + 2) = 0.00993 / 3.00993 ≈ 0.003299.

Then, RT1/P: R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T1=273 K, P=1 atm=101325 Pa.

So RT1 = 8.314 * 273 ≈ 2270 J/mol.

RT1/P = 2270 / 101325 ≈ 0
