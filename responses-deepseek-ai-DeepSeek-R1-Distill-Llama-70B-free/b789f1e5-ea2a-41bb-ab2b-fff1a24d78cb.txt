Okay, so I have this math problem here: 46,911 plus 653,092. Hmm, I'm a bit nervous because addition can sometimes trick me, especially with larger numbers. Let me take it step by step.

First, I should probably write down the numbers one on top of the other to add them properly. Let me visualize it.

So, 46,911 is a five-digit number, and 653,092 is a six-digit number. I think I should align them by their place values. That means the units place should line up, right?

Let me write it out:

```
  46,911
+653,092
---------
```

Wait, but they have different digit lengths. Oh right, I should add leading zeros to the shorter number to make them the same length. So 46,911 becomes 046,911. Now they both have six digits.

So:

```
  046,911
+653,092
---------
```

Now, I'll add each column starting from the rightmost digit, which is the units place.

Starting with the units place: 1 + 2 equals 3. So the units digit is 3.

Next, the tens place: 1 + 9 equals 10. Hmm, that's 10, so I write down 0 and carry over 1 to the next column.

Moving to the hundreds place: 9 + 0 is 9, plus the carried over 1 makes 10. Again, write 0 and carry over 1.

Now the thousands place: 6 + 3 is 9, plus the carried 1 makes 10. So another 0 and carry over 1.

Next is the ten-thousands place: 4 + 5 is 9, plus the carried 1 equals 10. Oh, same pattern here. Write 0 and carry 1.

Finally, the hundred-thousands place: 0 + 6 is 6, plus the carried 1 makes 7.

Putting it all together, the sum is 700,003. Wait, but let me double-check because I might have messed up the carrying.

Wait, let me go through it again step by step to be sure.

Units: 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.

Tens: 1 + 9 = 10. Write 0, carry 1. Correct.

Hundreds: 9 + 0 =9 +1=10. Write 0, carry 1. Correct.

Thousands: 6 +3=9 +1=10. Write 0, carry 1. Correct.

Ten-thousands:4 +5=9 +1=10. Write 0, carry 1. Correct.

 Hundred-thousands: 0 +6=6 +1=7.

So the total is 700,003. Now looking at the options, option C is 700,003, option D is 710,003, and others are different.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding. Maybe I should add the numbers another way.

Alternatively, I can break down the numbers. Let's see:

46,911 is 40,000 + 6,000 + 900 + 11.

653,092 is 600,000 + 50,000 + 3,000 + 90 + 2.

Adding them together:

40k + 600k = 640k

6k +50k=56k

900 +3k=3,900

11 +90=101

2? Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, maybe adding 46,911 + 653,092.

Wait, 46,911 + 653,092. Let's think of 46,911 as approximately 47,000 and 653,000 as about 653,000. So 47k +653k is around 700k. So the sum should be around 700,000. Looking at the options, C is 700,003, D is 710k, which is over.

Wait, but my initial calculation gave 700,003, which is option C. But I'm a bit confused because when I added each digit, I got that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the place alignment.

Wait, another approach: 46,911 + 653,092.

Let me add 46,911 + 653,092.

Starting from the right:

1 + 2 =3

1 +9=10, carry 1.

9 +0 +1=10, carry 1.

6 +3 +1=10, carry 1.

4 +5 +1=10, carry 1.

0 +6 +1=7.

So yeah, that's 700,003. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 700,003. So that's the one.

To solve the addition problem \(46,911 + 653,092\), align the numbers by their place values and add column by column from right to left:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
  046,911 \\
+653,092 \\
\hline
  700,003 \\
\end{array}
\]

1. **Units place**: \(1 + 2 = 3\).
2. **Tens place**: \(1 + 9 = 10\). Write \(0\), carry \(1\).
3. **Hundreds place**: \(9 + 0 + 1 = 10\). Write \(0\), carry \(1\).
4. **Thousands place**: \(6 + 3 + 1 = 10\). Write \(0\), carry \(1\).
5. **Ten-thousands place**: \(4 + 5 + 1 = 10\). Write \(0\), carry \(1\).
6. **Hundred-thousands place**: \(0 + 6 + 1 = 7\).

The total is \(700,003\), which corresponds to option **C**.
