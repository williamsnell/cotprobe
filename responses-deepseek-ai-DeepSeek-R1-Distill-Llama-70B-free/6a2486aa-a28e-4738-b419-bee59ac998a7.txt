Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene frequencies and migration rates. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the Rh allele frequencies in different populations and figuring out the degree of gene exchange, which is denoted as 'm' between American whites and blacks.

Wait, I remember that when populations exchange genes, it's called gene flow, right? And there's a formula to calculate the migration rate or the degree of gene exchange. Oh right, I think it's when you have two populations that are exchanging genes, and you can model the allele frequencies using the migration rate.

So the formula, if I recall correctly, is something like this: the allele frequency in the population after migration is equal to (1 - m) times the original frequency plus m times the frequency from the migrating population. Or maybe it's the other way around, depending on which population is migrating into which.

Wait, let me think. If population A is migrating into population B, then the new allele frequency in B would be (1 - m) * original B frequency + m * A's frequency. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, migration rate 'm' is the proportion of individuals in the population that are immigrants. So for example, if m is the migration rate from population A to B, then each generation, a fraction m of population B's genes come from A, and the rest (1 - m) come from their own population.

So the equation would be: p' = (1 - m) * p + m * q, where p is the allele frequency in B, and q is the allele frequency in A. Or wait, maybe I have to adjust the formula based on which population is which.

Wait, the question is about the Rh allele. Let me look at the numbers. The frequency among American whites is 0.028, among American blacks it's 0.446, and among East African blacks it's 0.630. But wait, the question is about the exchange between American whites and blacks. So I think the East African data isn't needed for this particular question since it's asking about exchange between the two American groups.

Wait, so perhaps we're considering the allele frequencies in American whites and blacks, and we want to find the migration rate from whites to blacks or vice versa.

Wait, but in the context, I think the problem assumes that the frequency in each population is changing due to migration from the other. So maybe the formula is something like the average of the two frequencies weighted by the migration rate.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me try to recall. I think the formula is that the allele frequency in one population after migration is the local frequency multiplied by (1 - m) plus the immigrant frequency multiplied by m. So, for example, if m is the proportion of individuals in population X that are immigrants from population Y, then the new frequency of an allele in X would be (1 - m)*p_X + m*p_Y.

But wait, the problem might be considering equilibrium, or perhaps the initial frequencies before any gene flow. Or maybe it's using a different approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the formula for gene flow when two populations are exchanging genes can be used to calculate 'm' based on the allele frequencies in the two populations. The formula is m = (p1 - p2)/(p1 - p3), where p3 is the frequency in another population? I'm not sure. Maybe that's for a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the situation where the allele frequencies in the two populations are influenced by migration. Let's say the initial frequencies are p_American_white = 0.028 and p_American_black = 0.446. We can model the situation where each population is receiving migrants from the other.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. Oh wait, I think I remember that the formula for the migration rate 'm' can be derived from the equation where the allele frequency in one population is a mix of the local frequency and the immigrant frequency.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is m = (p2 - p1)/(p2 - p3), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think about it.

Wait, let's consider that each population is sending migrants to the other. So for example, the American white population sends m proportion of migrants to the American black population each generation, and vice versa. But this might complicate things because it's a two-way migration.

But the problem is asking for the degree of gene exchange between the two populations, not specifying the direction. So perhaps 'm' is the proportion of migrants moving between them, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a one-island model, where each population is both sending and receiving migrants. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's suppose that the current allele frequencies in the two populations are the result of gene flow between them. So, for the American black population, their Rh allele frequency is 0.446. Let's assume that this is due to gene flow from the American white population.

Wait, but the East African blacks have a much higher frequency, 0.630. Hmm, perhaps the initial frequencies before migration were those of the source populations, and after migration, the allele frequencies changed.

Wait, maybe the model is that the American black population has a certain allele frequency that's a mix between their original frequency (from East Africa) and the American white frequency due to gene flow. But the question is about the exchange between the American whites and blacks, not involving the East Africans.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the following approach: The frequency in one population is influenced by immigration from the other. Let's say the initial frequency in population X was p, and after migration, it's p', which is a mixture of p and the immigrant frequency q, weighted by m, the proportion of migrants.

So, p' = (1 - m) * p + m * q.

In this case, if we're looking at the American black population, their p' would be 0.446. If their original frequency was that of East African blacks, which is 0.630, and they're getting migrants from American whites (frequency 0.028), then:

0.446 = (1 - m) * 0.630 + m * 0.028.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if American blacks are receiving migrants from American whites, their allele frequency would decrease from 0.630 to 0.446. So m would be the proportion of migrants from whites into blacks.

Alternatively, perhaps the migration is in the other direction. Or maybe the problem is considering the exchange between the two American groups regardless of their origins. Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about the degree of gene exchange between the American whites and blacks. So perhaps the correct approach is to model each population's allele frequency as a result of migration from the other.

Wait, but perhaps the formula should consider both populations. Alternatively, maybe we can model it as each population's allele frequency being influenced by the other.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think more clearly.

So, let's define:

p = frequency in population 1 (American whites) = 0.028

q = frequency in population 2 (American blacks) = 0.446

Wait, but I think the approach is to use the formula for the migration rate when two populations are exchanging genes. But I'm not exactly sure of the formula.

Alternatively, I've heard of the 'isolation by distance' model, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps we can model the situation as each population's allele frequency being a weighted average of their own and the other's, with the weights determined by the migration rate.

Wait, but I think the more precise approach is to use the formula for the equilibrium allele frequency after migration. So, for example, in population 1, the frequency after migration would be p' = (1 - m) * p + m * q.

Similarly, for population 2, q' = (1 - m) * q + m * p.

But wait, that would only make sense if m is the same in both directions, which may not be the case. Alternatively, maybe m is the migration rate from population 1 to 2, and n is from 2 to 1.

But the problem states that we're to find the degree of gene exchange, m, between the two populations. I'm guessing that m is the same in both directions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that each population's allele frequency has been influenced by the other, so we can set up two equations and solve for m.

So,

p' = (1 - m) * p + m * q

q' = (1 - m) * q + m * p

Wait, but in reality, that's not correct because m would be the same in both equations. But in this scenario, the migration rate from 1 to 2 is m, and from 2 to 1 is m as well. So each population contributes m proportion of their genes to the other.

But I'm not sure if the problem is considering that, or perhaps it's considering one-way migration. Hmm.

Wait, but in this case, the actual allele frequencies are p=0.028 (whites) and q=0.446 (blacks). If we assume that these are the equilibrium frequencies after migration, then perhaps we can set up the equations and solve for m.

Wait, but then we have two equations:

p = (1 - m) * p0 + m * q0

q = (1 - m) * q0 + m * p0

Where p0 and q0 are the original allele frequencies before migration. But we don't know p0 and q0, so that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the migration rate when considering the difference in allele frequencies. Oh, I think I remember that the migration rate can be estimated using the formula:

m = (p - p0)/(q0 - p0)

Where p is the current frequency, p0 is the original frequency, and q0 is the frequency in the source population. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's try applying this to the American black population. Suppose their original frequency was that of East African blacks, 0.630. They have migrants coming from American whites, whose frequency is 0.028.

So, the current frequency in American blacks is 0.446. So, using the formula:

m = (p_current - p_original) / (p_source - p_original)

Wait, no, that might not make sense. Let me think. The formula for migration rate when you have a population that has started with an initial frequency and after migration, it's at a new frequency. So the formula is:

p' = (1 - m) * p + m * q

So, rearranging for m:

m = (p' - p) / (q - p)

So in this case, for the American blacks:

p' = 0.446 (current frequency)
p = 0.630 (original, East African)
q = 0.028 (source, American whites)

So,

m = (0.446 - 0.630) / (0.028 - 0.630) = (-0.184) / (-0.602) ≈ 0.306 or 30.6%.

Wait, that's about 30.6%, but the options don't have that. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the migration is in the opposite direction. Maybe the American whites are receiving migrants from the American blacks.

Wait, no, because the question is about the exchange between American whites and blacks, so perhaps the formula should be applied in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the gene flow between the two populations, so we have the formula:

m = (p1 - p2) / (p1 - average)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another way to think about it: the degree of gene exchange can be calculated by the formula:

m = (p - p0) / (q - p0)

Where p is the current frequency, p0 is the original frequency, and q is the frequency in the source.

So, for American blacks, their original frequency would have been that of East African blacks, 0.630, and the source is American whites, 0.028.

So, p_current = 0.446
p_original = 0.630
q = 0.028

So,

m = (0.446 - 0.630) / (0.028 - 0.630) = (-0.184) / (-0.602) ≈ 0.306 or 30.6%

Again, that's about 30.6%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the exchange between the two American populations without considering the East African data. So, perhaps the East African data is a red herring, and the question only involves the two American groups.

So, in that case, maybe the formula is m = (p1 - p2) / (p1 + p2), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using the formula for the coefficient of gene flow, which is:

m = (p1 - p2) / (p1 + p2)

Wait, let's try that. p1 is 0.028, p2 is 0.446.

m = (0.028 - 0.446) / (0.028 + 0.446) = (-0.418) / 0.474 ≈ -0.882. That can't be right because migration rate can't be negative.

Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m = (p2 - p1) / (p2 - p1 + p1 + p2). No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe it's using the formula for genetic differentiation, Fst, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is using the formula for migration rate based on the average of the two allele frequencies. So, for example, if the two populations are exchanging genes, the migration rate can be estimated by the formula:

m = (p1 + p2) / 2 / (p1 + p2)

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the number of migrants per generation, which is given by m = (p1 - p2) / (p1 + p2 - 2p_average). I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The question is about the degree of gene exchange between the two populations, given their allele frequencies. So, perhaps we're to assume that the allele frequencies are the result of gene flow between them.

Wait, maybe the formula is m = (p - q) / (p + q), but I'm not certain.

Wait, p is 0.028, q is 0.446. p - q is negative, so that would give a negative m, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps m is the harmonic mean or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the amount of gene flow that would cause the allele frequencies to be as observed.

So, let's model it as each population is sending migrants to the other. Let me define m as the proportion of the population that are migrants from the other group.

So, for the white population:

p_white' = (1 - m) * p_white + m * p_black

Similarly, for the black population:

p_black' = (1 - m) * p_black + m * p_white

But wait, if m is the same in both directions, then solving for m would require knowing the equilibrium frequencies, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, in the problem, the current frequencies are p_white = 0.028 and p_black = 0.446. So, if we assume that these are the equilibrium frequencies after gene flow, then:

p_white = (1 - m) * p_white_initial + m * p_black_initial

p_black = (1 - m) * p_black_initial + m * p_white_initial

But we don't know the initial frequencies, so this approach might not work.

Wait, but perhaps the initial frequencies are the ones before any gene flow occurred. For example, maybe the initial p_white_initial was 0.028 and p_black_initial was 0.446, but that can't be, because then m would be zero, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe the initial frequencies were from other source populations, like perhaps the white population's initial was from Europe and the black's from Africa, but the problem doesn't provide those numbers, except for East Africa.

Wait, the East African frequency is 0.630, which is higher than the American black frequency of 0.446. So perhaps the initial p_black_initial was 0.630, and due to gene flow from whites (p_white = 0.028), the current p_black is 0.446.

So, using the formula:

p_black = (1 - m) * p_black_initial + m * p_white

So,

0.446 = (1 - m) * 0.630 + m * 0.028

Let's solve for m.

Expanding the equation:

0.446 = 0.630*(1 - m) + 0.028*m

0.446 = 0.630 - 0.630m + 0.028m

Combine like terms:

0.446 = 0.630 - 0.602m

Now, subtract 0.630 from both sides:

0.446 - 0.630 = -0.602m

-0.184 = -0.602m

Divide both sides by -0.602:

m = (-0.184)/(-0.602) ≈ 0.3058 or about 30.58%.

Wait, that's about 30.6%, but looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are A:2.8, B:6.1, C:3.6, etc. So none of them match 30.6%.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the exchange in the opposite direction, i.e., from blacks to whites.

So, let's try that. Suppose the initial p_white_initial was 0.028, and due to migration from blacks (p_black = 0.446), the current p_white is higher? Wait, no, because 0.446 is higher than 0.028, so migration from blacks to whites would increase p_white beyond 0.028, but the current p_white is 0.028. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the other way around. Suppose the initial p_white_initial was 0.028, and migration from blacks (p_black_initial = 0.446) into
