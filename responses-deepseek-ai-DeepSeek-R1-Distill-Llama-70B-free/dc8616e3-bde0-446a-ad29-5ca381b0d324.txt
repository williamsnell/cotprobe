Options:

A: P(R) = 2/3, P(B) = 1/3
B: P(R) = 5/14, P(B) = 4/14
C: P(R) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/4
D: P(R) = 7/15, P(B) = 4/15
E: P(R) = 7/16, P(B) = 1/4
F: P(R) = 5/16, P(B) = 1/4
G: P(R) = 1/3, P(B) = 1/4
H: P(R) = 1/4, P(B) = 1/5
I: P(R) = 7/16, P(B) = 1/2

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there's a box with 7 red balls, 5 white balls, and 4 black balls. I need to find the probability of drawing one red ball and then one black ball when picking randomly. Hmm, wait, no, I think it's the probability of drawing a red ball and the probability of drawing a black ball separately. So two probabilities to calculate.

Alright, probability is about the chance of an event happening. The basic formula is the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So for each color, I'll calculate their probabilities.

First, let's find the total number of balls in the box. There are 7 red, 5 white, and 4 black. So 7 + 5 + 4 equals... let's see, 7+5 is 12, and 12+4 is 16. So 16 balls in total.

Now, the probability of drawing a red ball. There are 7 red balls, so the favorable outcomes are 7. The total outcomes are 16. So P(R) is 7/16.

Next, the probability of drawing a black ball. There are 4 black balls. So that's 4 favorable outcomes. Again, over 16 total. So P(B) is 4/16. Wait, 4/16 simplifies to 1/4, right? Because 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 16 divided by 4 is 4. So 1/4.

Wait, looking at the options, I need to see which option matches these probabilities. Let me check each option.

Option A: P(R)=2/3, P(B)=1/3. No, that's too high for red because 7/16 is about 0.4375, and 2/3 is around 0.666. So A is wrong.

Option B: P(R)=5/14, P(B)=4/14. Wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, which doesn't match 7/16 (~0.4375). So B is wrong.

Option C: P(R)=1/2, P(B)=1/4. 1/2 is 0.5, which is higher than 7/16. So no.

Option D: P(R)=7/15, P(B)=4/15. Wait, 15 is the denominator? Because total balls are 16, not 15. So D can't be right.

Option E: P(R)=7/16, P(B)=1/4. Oh, that's exactly what I calculated. 7/16 for red and 1/4 (which is 4/16) for black. So E seems to match.

Let me just check the other options quickly to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option F: P(R)=5/16, which is less than 7/16. So no.

Option G: P(R)=1/3, which is about 0.333, lower than 7/16.

Option H: P(R)=1/4, way too low.

Option I: P(R)=7/16, but P(B)=1/2. No, because 4/16 is 1/4, not 1/2.

So the correct option is E.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of drawing a red ball and a black ball from a box containing 7 red, 5 white, and 4 black balls. The total number of balls is:

\[
7 + 5 + 4 = 16
\]

The probability of drawing a red ball is:

\[
P(R) = \frac{\text{Number of red balls}}{\text{Total number of balls}} = \frac{7}{16}
\]

The probability of drawing a black ball is:

\[
P(B) = \frac{\text{Number of black balls}}{\text{Total number of balls}} = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Comparing these results with the given options, the correct choice is:

**E: P(R) = 7/16, P(B) = 1/4**

Answer: E
