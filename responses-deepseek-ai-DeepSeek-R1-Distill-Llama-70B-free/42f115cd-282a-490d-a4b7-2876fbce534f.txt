Question:

A landlord is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land on which is situated a large office building. The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions:"(1) The tenant covenants to pay the rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. "After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to an attorney, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. After the doctor failed to make his rental payments for the first two months of his lease, the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the tenant, because he was not directly responsible for the doctor's failure to pay rent.
B: the landlord, because the tenant and the assignees breached the lease agreement.
C: the tenant, because the landlord did not take action when the doctor failed to pay rent.
D: the tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.
E: the tenant, because the landlord did not formally approve the assignments.
F: the landlord, because he did not object to the assignments.
G: the landlord, because the doctor, as the final assignee, failed to fulfill his obligation to pay rent.
H: the tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.
I: the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.
J: the landlord, because the attorney failed to pay rent for two months.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about landlord-tenant law, specifically dealing with lease agreements and assignments. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that a landlord owns a tract of land with an office building and leased it to a tenant for seven years, starting August 1, 2001, and ending July 31, 2008. The lease says the tenant has to pay $750 per month on the first of each month.

After three years, so that would be around August 2004, the tenant assigned the entire remaining lease period to an attorney, who took possession. Then, in 2005, the attorney assigned his interest to a doctor. The doctor moved in but didn't pay rent for the first two months. The landlord then sued the original tenant for the unpaid rent. The question is, who wins?

I remember that when a tenant assigns a lease, the original tenant is usually still liable unless there's a novation. A novation would require the landlord's agreement to release the original tenant from liability. So if the landlord didn't agree to a novation, the tenant remains on the hook.

Looking at the options, option I says the landlord should win because the tenant's obligation survived the assignments. Option H says the tenant isn't liable because the assignment was a novation. But the question doesn't mention the landlord agreeing to a novation, so H is probably wrong.

Option E suggests the tenant isn't liable because the landlord didn't approve the assignments. Wait, I think that lease assignments typically don't require landlord approval unless the lease says so. So if the lease is silent, the tenant can assign, and the new assignee becomes responsible, but the tenant remains liable. So E might not be correct because the landlord's approval isn't necessary unless stated.

Option A says the tenant isn't responsible because it's the doctor's fault. But since the tenant assigned, he's still liable unless released. So A might not be correct.

Option I seems right because the tenant's obligation under the lease continues even after assignment. So the landlord can sue the original tenant for unpaid rent by the doctor.

Wait, but what about the chain of assignments? The tenant assigned to the attorney, then attorney to the doctor. Does that affect anything? I think each assignee becomes liable for their term, but the original tenant remains liable unless the landlord releases them. So the landlord can go after the tenant, attorney, or doctor for the unpaid rent, but the question is whether the landlord sued the tenant, so the tenant is still liable.

So I think the correct answer is I: the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation survived the assignments.

The question revolves around landlord-tenant law, specifically addressing lease agreements and the liability of the original tenant after assigning the lease. The landlord leased a property to a tenant for seven years, and the tenant assigned the lease first to an attorney and then to a doctor. The doctor failed to pay rent for two months, prompting the landlord to sue the original tenant for the unpaid rent. Key legal principles include the concept that a tenant assigning a lease remains liable unless a novation occurs, which requires the landlord's agreement to release the tenant from liability. The lease in question does not mention a novation, and there is no indication the landlord approved one.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** correctly states that the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments. The landlord can hold the tenant liable for unpaid rent because no novation occurred to release the tenant from their obligations.
- **Option H** is incorrect because there is no evidence of a novation; the landlord did not agree to release the tenant from liability.
- **Option E** is incorrect because landlord approval is not required for a tenant to assign a lease unless the lease explicitly states so, which it does not in this case.
- **Option A** is incorrect because the tenant remains liable for the lease obligations even after assigning it to others.

Thus, the correct answer is that the landlord should prevail because the tenant's obligation under the lease survived the assignments.

Answer: I
