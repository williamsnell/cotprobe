Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about standard-setting in human rights diplomacy. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking what the function of standard-setting is. The options are A through D, each giving a different definition. I remember that standard-setting in human rights has something to do with creating guidelines or rules that countries should follow. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics, like whether these standards are binding or not.

Let me think... I think standard-setting involves creating some sort of framework. I recall that human rights treaties, like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the Geneva Conventions, set out specific standards. These are usually written into treaties, which are legally binding once ratified by countries. So, when a country signs and ratifies a treaty, they're agreeing to be bound by those standards.

Wait, but what exactly does standard-setting mean? Is it about proposing or actually putting forward the standards? I think it's the latter. Standard-setting would involve creating and establishing these standards, not just proposing them. So options that say "putting forward" are more likely correct than those that say "proposing."

Looking at the options:

Option A: "Standard-setting means putting forward binding legal standards." That sounds right because treaties are binding once adopted.

Option B: "Merely proposing binding legal standards." The word "merely proposing" makes it sound like it's just a suggestion, which doesn't fit. I think standard-setting is more about establishing the standards, not just suggesting them.

Option C: "Putting forward non-binding legal standards." This contradicts what I was thinking because I believe the standards in treaties are binding. Unless it's referring to something else, like resolutions which can be non-binding, but I don't think that's standard-setting.

Option D: "Setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties." This sounds accurate too. Treaties do set standards of conduct. So D is also a possible correct answer.

Wait, now I'm confused between A and D. Let me think again. Option A says it's about putting forward binding legal standards. Option D says it's about setting standards in treaties. Are these the same thing?

I think standard-setting in diplomacy often refers to the process of creating these treaties. So the function would be to set the standards within those treaties. So option D might be more precise because it specifically mentions human rights treaties.

But then option A says "putting forward binding legal standards," which is also correct because once treaties are adopted, they are binding. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the function of standard-setting. So what does standard-setting do? It sets the standards that become part of treaties, which are binding. So perhaps option D is correct because it's about setting those standards in treaties. Option A is more about the nature of the standards (binding), while D is about the action (setting in treaties).

Alternatively, maybe both A and D are correct. But let me look at the exact wording. Option D says "setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties." That sounds like the function is to establish those standards within the treaties. So the function is to set the standards in the treaties, which are binding.

Wait, but standard-setting could also refer to the process of creating those standards, which are then included in treaties. So maybe the function is to put forward binding standards, which are then part of treaties.

I'm a bit torn. Another approach: looking up what standard-setting in human rights means. From what I've read before, standard-setting refers to the process of developing and establishing international human rights norms and standards, typically through treaties and other legal instruments. So the function is to set these standards, which become part of treaties.

So in that case, Option D says "setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties," which aligns with that. Option A is about putting forward binding standards, which might be part of the same process.

Wait, but when you set a standard, you're putting it forward as part of a treaty. So perhaps both A and D are correct in a way. But the options are mutually exclusive.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is A because standard-setting is about creating binding standards, which are then part of treaties. But I'm not sure.

Wait another thought: Standard-setting is the process of creating the norms, which are then codified into treaties. So the function is to put forward these binding standards. So option A could be correct.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of examples. The UN Commission on Human Rights used to do standard-setting by drafting treaties like the ICCPR or ICESCR. These treaties set binding standards. So the function is to put forward these binding standards, which are then adopted by states.

So in that case, option A would be correct. But option D says it's setting standards in treaties, which is also part of the process.

Wait, perhaps the function is both, but the options are separate. The question is about the function, so which option best describes it. Option D specifically mentions human rights treaties, which is where these standards are set. So I think D is the correct answer.

Wait, but standard-setting can also occur through other means, not just treaties. Like, the Universal Declaration is considered a standard-setting document, but it's not a treaty; it's a declaration. So maybe standard-setting isn't limited to treaties.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the options. The question is about the function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy. If the function is to set standards, which are then part of treaties, then option D would be correct. But if the function is creating binding standards, then A is correct.

Another angle: the term "standard-setting" in diplomacy often refers to the process of establishing norms. So the function is to set these norms, which are included in treaties. Therefore, D makes sense because it's about setting the standards in treaties.

I think I'm leaning towards option D being the correct answer.

The function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy involves establishing norms and guidelines that countries are expected to follow. These standards are often codified in human rights treaties, which, once ratified, become binding legal instruments. While standard-setting can involve both proposing and finalizing these norms, the specific function refers to the process of setting these standards within treaties. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: Standard-setting means setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties.

Answer: D
