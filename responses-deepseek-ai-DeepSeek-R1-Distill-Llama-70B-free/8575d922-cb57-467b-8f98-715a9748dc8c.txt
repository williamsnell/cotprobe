Question:

A businessman was the owner of an idyllic lake and wooded area. In 1980, the businessman conveyed the land to the state "on the condition that" it be used as recreational property only. Two years later, the state decided that they wanted a small industrial park attached to the corner of the land. The state went ahead and developed a small portion of the land as industrial space, making it part of a larger industrial park that was adjacent to the land. The businessman notified the state that he was the owner of the property because the state violated the conditions of the conveyance, and that he was taking possession of the property back. What was the interest that was created by the conveyance and can the businessman get the property back?

Options:

A: The interest created is an indefeasible estate, and the owner cannot do anything to enforce a condition that is against public policy and never enforceable in the first place.
B: The interest created is a life estate, and the property will revert back to the businessman only after the life tenant's death.
C: The interest created is a reverter, and the property instantly reverts back to the grantor upon the occurrence of the specified violation.
D: The interest created is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the original owner can get the property back only by taking affirmative steps to exercise his right of entry.
E: The interest created is a leasehold estate, and the businessman can reclaim the property only after the lease period ends.
F: The interest is a remainder, and the property will only revert back to the original owner after the state's interest ends.
G: The interest created is an easement, and the businessman has no right to reclaim the property but can prevent the state from using it for industrial purposes.
H: The interest is a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, and if the condition occurs the property reverts in fee simple to a pre-designated third party.
I: The interest created is a fee simple absolute, and the owner cannot reclaim the property as it now completely belongs to the state.
J: The interest is a fee simple determinable, and the property instantly reverts back to the businessman upon violation of the condition.

Okay, so I've got this question about property law, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

So, the scenario is a businessman who owned a lake and wooded area conveyed the land to the state in 1980. The condition was that it be used as recreational property only. Then, two years later, the state decided to build a small industrial park on part of it, making it part of a larger industrial park next door. The businessman says the state violated the condition and wants the property back.

The question is about the type of interest created by the conveyance and whether the businessman can get the property back.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that when you convey land with conditions, it creates different types of future interests. The main ones are fee simple determinable, fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and perhaps others like executory interests.

So, when a grantor includes a condition like "on the condition that it be used for...", that's usually a determinable fee. The wording here is "on the condition that", which sounds like it creates a fee simple determinable. Because with determinable fees, the language is something like "so long as", "while", "during", "until", "on condition that". So that fits here.

In a fee simple determinable, the estate automatically reverts to the grantor if the condition is violated. So, if the state uses it for industrial purposes, which violates the condition, the property would revert back without any action needed by the grantor. But wait, I also remember that sometimes the grantor has a right of entry, which is a type of future interest called a possibility of reverter in determinable fees or a right of entry in fees subject to condition subsequent.

Wait, so what's the difference between fee simple determinable and fee simple subject to condition subsequent? 

In fee simple determinable, the future interest is a possibility of reverter, and the grantor doesn't have to take any actionâ€”the estate just automatically ends and reverts. But in condition subsequent, the grantor has a right of entry, which means he has to take some affirmative action, like re-entering the property or taking legal steps to get it back.

So looking at the conveyance in the question, the grant was "on the condition that" the land be used as recreational only. That's the language of a determinable fee, so the future interest would be a possibility of reverter. So when the condition is breached, the property should automatically revert back to the grantor without any action needed.

Wait, but I also recall that sometimes courts construe conditions as covenants rather than conditions, especially if the condition is considered to serve a public purpose or something. But I don't think that applies here. The key is the language used.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's a reverter, and the property instantly reverts. That sounds right for a fee simple determinable.

Option D: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent. Here, the grantor has to take affirmative steps. But in our case, the condition was "on the condition that", which is for determinable, not condition subsequent.

Option J: Fee simple determinable, and the property instantly reverts. So that also sounds correct.

Wait, so what's the difference between options C and J. Let me check the options again.

Option C: Interest is a reverter, property reverts instantly upon violation. But "reverter" is a type of future interest, which is correct for a determinable fee. So the estate created is a fee simple determinable, and the future interest is a possibility of reverter.

Wait, no. Wait, the interest created by the conveyance is the fee simple determinable. The future interest is the possibility of reverter. So in the question, the conveyance created a fee simple determinable in the state, and the businessman retained a possibility of reverter.

So the options are about what interest was created. So the options need to be about what the state received.

Looking at the options:

Option J says the interest is a fee simple determinable, and the property instantly reverts. So that fits. The state got a fee simple determinable, so if they violate the condition, it reverts back.

Option C says the interest created is a reverter. No, the reverter is the future interest, not the present estate. So the state's interest is the determinable fee; the businessman's is the reverter.

So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, let me make sure. The question is, what interest was created by the conveyance. The conveyance was to the state, so the state received a fee simple determinable, with a possibility of reverter in the grantor.

So option J says the interest created is a fee simple determinable, and upon violation, it reverts back. That's correct.

Option C says the interest created is a reverter, which is the future interest, not the present estate. So that's wrong because the state's interest is the determinable fee.

So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another point: when the condition is breached in a fee simple determinable, does the title revert automatically, or does the grantor have to take action?

In a fee simple determinable, once the condition is broken, the estate automatically ends, and the property reverts to the grantor without any action needed. So the businessman wouldn't have to do anything; it would just go back to him.

But in a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the grantor has a right of entry and must take action, like bringing a lawsuit or taking possession.

In this case, the businessman notified the state and took possession, but in a determinable fee, he wouldn't need to take any action because it's automatic.

Wait, but the question says the businessman notified the state that he's taking possession. So perhaps that's not necessary in a determinable fee. Hmm, but in reality, maybe he still has to take some steps to enforce it. Or perhaps the law considers it automatic.

I think the key is the type of estate. If it's determinable, then upon breach, it reverts automatically. So the businessman just gets it back without needing to do anything, but maybe in practice, he might have to take legal action to enforce it.

But the question is about the legal effect, not the procedural steps. So the correct answer is J: fee simple determinable, and it instantly reverts.

So looking back at the options, J is correct.

The question revolves around the type of property interest created when a businessman conveyed land to the state in 1980 "on the condition that" it be used as recreational property only. Two years later, the state violated this condition by developing part of the land for industrial use. The issue is whether the businessman can reclaim the property and the nature of the interest created by the conveyance.

When land is conveyed with language such as "on the condition that," it typically creates a **fee simple determinable**. This type of estate is granted for as long as a specified condition is met. If the condition is violated, the estate automatically terminates, and the property reverts to the grantor without the need for affirmative action. The future interest retained by the grantor in this case is called a **possibility of reverter**.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** incorrectly states that the interest created is a "reverter." However, the reverter is not the present estate but rather the future interest retained by the grantor. The state received a fee simple determinable, not a reverter.
  
- **Option D** refers to a "fee simple subject to a condition subsequent," which requires the grantor to take affirmative steps to reclaim the property after a breach. This does not apply here because the language "on the condition that" creates a determinable fee, not a fee subject to a condition subsequent.
  
- **Option J** correctly identifies the interest created as a **fee simple determinable** and notes that the property instantly reverts to the grantor upon violation of the condition. This aligns with the automatic nature of a determinable fee.

Thus, the correct answer is that the interest created is a **fee simple determinable**, and the property automatically reverts to the businessman upon the state's violation of the condition.
