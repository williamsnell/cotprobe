The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?

Options:

A: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.
B: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance does not serve a significant public interest, because it adversely affects low-income individuals.
C: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not proportionate to the intended public benefit, because it imposes a financial burden on property owners.
D: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.
E: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance does not violate the rights of the property owners, because it regulates the use of their property.
F: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to improve the standard of living within its jurisdiction, because it regulates housing conditions.
G: The city must prove that the ordinance has a rational basis, because it impacts economic activity within its jurisdiction.
H: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no substantial relationship between the ordinance and the city's goal of improving housing quality, because it may result in fewer low-income housing options.
I: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.
J: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with municipal ordinances and their constitutionality. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a city ordinance that requires all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom per bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. The owners of existing rental housing are opposing this because they think it'll decrease low-income housing options since they can't raise rents enough to cover the costs. The city passed it anyway, and a plaintiff is suing, claiming the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.

The question is about the burden of persuasion in this case. So, I need to figure out who has to prove what in court.

I remember that when a law is challenged as unconstitutional, the court uses different levels of scrutiny. The levels I know are rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. Rational basis is the lowest level, where the government just needs to show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Intermediate is for things like gender discrimination, requiring a substantial relationship to an important interest. Strict scrutiny is for fundamental rights or suspect classifications, requiring the law to be necessary for a compelling interest.

So, the key here is to figure out what level of scrutiny applies. The ordinance is about housing regulations. The plaintiff is arguing it's unconstitutional on its face, but without specifying which constitutional clause. Though, given it's about property, it's probably a Due Process or Takings Clause issue. But more likely, it's a substantive due process challenge, where they argue the law isn't rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

Wait, but the ordinance affects property rights. Property rights are considered fundamental, but not in all contexts. The Supreme Court has held that land-use regulations are generally subject to rational basis review under the Due Process Clause unless it's a taking, which would require just compensation.

So, in this case, the city is regulating existing and new rental properties to improve housing quality. The plaintiff is claiming it's unconstitutional on its face. So, the challenge is likely under the Due Process Clause, arguing that the regulation is not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

Under rational basis review, the plaintiff would have the burden to show that there's no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest. Because the government action is presumed valid, the plaintiff must overcome that presumption.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Plaintiff must show no rational relationship because it's economic activity. That seems to fit because the ordinance is an economic regulation, so rational basis applies.

Option H: Talks about substantial relationship. Wait, that's intermediate scrutiny, which isn't applicable here because the ordinance doesn't implicate a suspect class or fundamental right beyond general economic regulation.

Option I: Substantially related to important state interest. That's for strict scrutiny or intermediate. I think this is when a fundamental right is at stake, like in United States v. Lopez, but here it's more of an economic regulation, so probably not.

Option D and J mention strict scrutiny, which requires a compelling interest. But I don't think strict scrutiny applies here because housing regulations are usually under rational basis unless it's targeting a protected class, which it's not.

So the correct burden would be on the plaintiff to show there's no rational relationship. Looking back, option A says exactly that: plaintiff must demonstrate no rational relationship because it's regulating economic activity normally within state authority.

Wait, but wait. The ordinance is not just economic; it's about property use, but it's still a form of economic regulation. Rational basis applies unless a fundamental right is implicated.

Alternatively, is this a Takings Clause issue? If the regulation affects property value, but without a physical taking, it's more of a due process challenge. So the plaintiff would have to show that the regulation isn't rationally related to a legitimate interest.

Therefore, the burden is on the plaintiff to meet the rational basis test. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when regulations disproportionately affect a protected class, like low-income individuals, does that change the scrutiny? But the question doesn't say the ordinance targets low-income people; it's a general regulation that might have a disparate impact. So unless it's a suspect classification, which low-income isn't, the rational basis applies.

So yes, option A is the right answer.

The question revolves around a city ordinance requiring rental housing units to meet specific standards, which the plaintiff challenges as unconstitutional on its face. The issue centers on the burden of persuasion in this case, particularly the level of scrutiny applied to the ordinance. 

The ordinance regulates housing conditions, which falls under the city's police power to promote public health, safety, and welfare. Such regulations are typically subject to **rational basis review** under the Due Process Clause. Rational basis review requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate government interest. The government's action is presumed valid, and the plaintiff must overcome this presumption.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that the plaintiff must show there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest. This aligns with rational basis review, which applies to economic regulations like this one.
- **Option H** refers to a "substantial relationship," which pertains to intermediate scrutiny, not applicable here since no fundamental right or suspect classification is at issue.
- **Option I** mentions "substantially related to an important state interest," which is also inconsistent with the applicable rational basis standard.
- **Options D and J** invoke strict scrutiny, requiring a compelling state interest, but strict scrutiny does not apply here as the ordinance does not implicate a fundamental right or target a protected class.
- The other options either misstate the burden or apply incorrect standards.

Thus, the correct answer is that the plaintiff must demonstrate there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest under rational basis review.

**Answer: A**
