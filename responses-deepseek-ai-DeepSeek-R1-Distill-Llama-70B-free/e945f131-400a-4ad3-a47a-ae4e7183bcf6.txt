Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 5/8 * m = 6. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have an equation like this, you want to isolate m. 

Wait, the equation is (5/8) multiplied by m equals 6. So to get m by itself, I should do the opposite operation. Since it's multiplication, I need to divide both sides by 5/8. Or wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as multiplying both sides by the reciprocal. Yeah, that makes sense because dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.

So, the reciprocal of 5/8 is 8/5. If I multiply both sides by 8/5, that should cancel out the 5/8 on the left side. Let me write that down step by step.

Starting with the equation:
(5/8) * m = 6

To isolate m, multiply both sides by 8/5:
m = 6 * (8/5)

Now, let's compute that. 6 times 8 is 48, and 48 divided by 5 is 9.6. Wait, 48/5 is 9 and 3/5 because 5 times 9 is 45, and 48 minus 45 is 3, so 3/5. So m equals 9 and 3/5.

Looking at the answer choices, let me see which one matches. Option D is 9 and 3/5, so that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps to be sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, I identified that I needed to get m by itself, so I multiplied both sides by the reciprocal of 5/8, which is 8/5. Then I calculated 6 times 8/5, which is 48/5. Converting that to a mixed number gives 9 3/5. Yep, that matches option D. I think I've got it right.

To solve the equation \( \frac{5}{8} \cdot m = 6 \), follow these steps:

1. **Isolate \( m \):** To isolate \( m \), multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{5}{8} \), which is \( \frac{8}{5} \).

   \[
   m = 6 \cdot \frac{8}{5}
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:** 

   \[
   m = \frac{6 \cdot 8}{5} = \frac{48}{5}
   \]

3. **Convert to a mixed number:** 

   \[
   \frac{48}{5} = 9 \frac{3}{5}
   \]

Thus, \( m = 9 \frac{3}{5} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
