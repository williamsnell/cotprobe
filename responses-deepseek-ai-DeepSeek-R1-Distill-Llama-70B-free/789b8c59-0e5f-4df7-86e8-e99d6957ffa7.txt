Okay, so I've got this question about a 29-year-old man who's been having some issues since he moved for a promotion two months ago. Let me try to piece this together.

He's complaining about a pounding heart, poor sleep, and feeling restless. Hmm, those sound like anxiety symptoms. But I should think about what's causing them. He moved two months ago, so that's a significant life change. He's struggling to concentrate at his new job, worried about adapting to the increased responsibility, and has called in sick three times in two weeks. That suggests his work is being impacted.

So, looking at the options. Option A is social anxiety disorder. That's more about fear of social situations, which doesn't seem to fit here. He's worried about work, not necessarily social interactions.

Option B is adjustment disorder with anxious mood. Adjustment disorders are reactions to identifiable stressors, like a big life change. His symptoms started after moving and the new job, so that fits. Adjustment disorders usually have symptoms like anxiety or depression but not as severe as major disorders.

Option C is PTSD. That's after a traumatic event. There's nothing in the question suggesting a trauma, so probably not C.

Option D is panic disorder. That involves recurrent panic attacks. He has a pounding heart, but the question doesn't specify panic attacks, more like general restlessness and anxiety.

Option E is dysthymia, which is a long-term, low-grade depression. His issues are recent, just two months, so dysthymia requires at least two years of symptoms.

Option F is obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. That's more about personality traits like being perfectionistic and orderly. His symptoms sound more like anxiety than personality issues.

Option G is major depressive disorder. He's having trouble sleeping and concentrating, which could fit. But I'm not sure if he's showing enough depressive symptoms. The question mentions restlessness and anxiety, not sadness or loss of interest.

Option H is bipolar disorder. That would involve manic episodes, which aren't mentioned here. He's more anxious than anything.

Option I is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is excessive worry about various things for at least six months. He's been having these symptoms for two months, so the duration might not fit yet. Also, GAD is more free-floating anxiety, not tied to a specific stressor like a job change.

Option J is schizophrenia. That's more about psychotic symptoms, which he doesn't have.

So putting it together: He's had a recent stressor (new job, move), symptoms are anxiety-related, and it's been two months. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood (B) seems to fit best because it's a reaction to a specific stressor, and the duration is within the typical timeframe for adjustment disorders (symptoms usually last less than six months).

Wait, but could it be GAD? Well, GAD requires at least six months of symptoms, and here it's only two. So B is more likely. Also, GAD is more about multiple areas of life causing worry, not tied to a specific event like a job change.

So I think the answer is B: adjustment disorder with anxious mood.

The patient is a 29-year-old male experiencing anxiety symptoms, including a pounding heart, poor sleep, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating, following a significant life change (relocation for a promotion). These symptoms have been present for two months, and his ability to adapt to increased work responsibilities is impacted. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (Social anxiety disorder):** Involves fear of social situations, which is not the focus here.  
- **B (Adjustment disorder with anxious mood):** Fits well, as it is a reaction to an identifiable stressor (job change, relocation) with anxiety symptoms lasting less than six months.  
- **C (PTSD):** Requires a traumatic event, which is absent here.  
- **D (Panic disorder):** Involves recurrent panic attacks, not explicitly mentioned.  
- **E (Dysthymia):** Requires at least two years of symptoms, which is not the case.  
- **F (Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder):** Relates to personality traits, not acute anxiety symptoms.  
- **G (Major depressive disorder):** While some symptoms overlap, the primary presentation is anxiety, not sadness or loss of interest.  
- **H (Bipolar disorder):** Involves manic episodes, which are not described.  
- **I (Generalized anxiety disorder):** Requires at least six months of symptoms and is not tied to a specific stressor.  
- **J (Schizophrenia):** Involves psychotic symptoms, which are absent.  

The most appropriate diagnosis is **adjustment disorder with anxious mood**, as it aligns with the patient's recent stressor and symptom duration.
