Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Stevenson's claims regarding the primary use of ethical judgments. I'm a bit rusty on Stevenson, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher, specifically dealing with ethics. His work was part of the emotivist school, I think. Emotivists believe that ethical statements are expressions of emotion rather than statements of fact. So ethical judgments aren't about objective truths but more about how people feel.

The question is asking what Stevenson thought was the primary use of ethical judgments. The options are A to J. I need to figure out which one aligns with his ideas.

Looking at the options:

A: demonstrate superior knowledge. I don't think that's it. Stevenson wasn't about showing off knowledge.

B: provide a basis for legislation. Maybe, but I'm not sure. Legislation is more about creating laws, and I think Stevenson was more about the function of language in ethics.

C: evaluate the morality of others. Hmm, maybe. But I think his focus was more on how people use language to influence each other.

D: influence the interests of others. This rings a bell. I remember that Stevenson talked about how ethical judgments are used to influence others' attitudes or actions. So by expressing approval or disapproval, you're trying to affect others.

E: state facts. No, emotivists don't believe ethical statements are factual. They're more about emotions.

F: establish universal moral laws. That sounds more like Kant or someone else. Stevenson was against moral absolutism, I think.

G: describe one’s own approval of things. This is close because emotivists do say that ethical statements express one's feelings. But the question is about the primary use, which is not just describing but doing something with them.

H: express personal beliefs. Similar to G, but again, maybe not the primary use.

I: none of the above. Well, only if none of the options fit.

J: manipulate the emotions of others. This is similar to D. Influence vs. manipulate. I think influence is the term Stevenson used more, but I'm not certain. Or maybe he used "influence the interests", which is option D.

Wait, I think Stevenson's point was that ethical judgments are used to influence others' attitudes and actions. So the primary use is to influence others, not just to express one's own feelings. So D would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, G says "describe one’s own approval of things." But that's more about the meaning of ethical statements, not their use. The question is about the primary use, which is more about how they function socially.

So I think the answer is D: influence the interests of others.

The primary use of ethical judgments according to Stevenson is to influence the interests of others. This aligns with his emotivist perspective, where ethical language functions to shape others' attitudes and actions rather than to state facts or express personal approval alone.

Answer: D
