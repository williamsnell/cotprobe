Question:

A graduate of law school received notice that she had successfully passed the bar exam. To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt. Although the graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl, she was in a festive mood and drank it, anyway. A few minutes later, the graduate became very dizzy and attempted to stand up from the barstool. As she tried to walk to the restroom, she became nauseated and vomited over a customer sitting at a nearby table. The customer was embarrassed and greatly humiliated by the incident. If the customer asserts a claim against the graduate, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the graduate should have known the effects of the drink.
B: not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.
C: prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.
D: prevail, because the graduate acted negligently by drinking too much.
E: not prevail, because the graduate also suffered as a result of the drink.
F: prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.
G: not prevail, because it was the bartender who served the drink.
H: not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking.
I: prevail, because the graduate's actions caused emotional distress.
J: not prevail, because the graduate did not intend to harm the customer.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically involving a scenario where someone gets sick after drinking a potent cocktail and vomits on another customer. The question is about whether the customer can successfully sue the graduate for this incident.

First, I need to understand the situation. The graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl drink, which is made with gin, vermouth, and grenadine. She was celebrating passing the bar exam, so she was in a festive mood and drank it anyway. After a few minutes, she became dizzy, tried to stand, felt nauseated, and vomited on a nearby customer. The customer was embarrassed and humiliated.

The question is about the customer's claim against the graduate. So, what are the possible legal theories here? The options suggest various tort claims, like negligence, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, etc.

Let's break down the possible claims. The customer could claim that the graduate's actions caused harm. The main issue is whether the graduate is liable for the vomiting incident.

First, I recall that in tort law, a battery is an intentional harmful or offensive touching without consent. But here, the graduate vomiting on the customer doesn't seem intentional. She was dizzy and nauseated, which suggests it wasn't a deliberate act. So, the touching (vomiting) was not intentional, so battery might not apply. But wait, sometimes actions that are so reckless can imply intent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, negligence: the graduate might have been negligent in drinking too much, knowing that it could cause her to lose control and harm others. But wait, she didn't know the drink was that potent. She had never heard of it before. So, she might not have known the effects, which could mean she wasn't negligent because she didn't have the knowledge to foresee the risk.

Wait, but the question is about the graduate's actions after drinking. She drank it, became dizzy, and then tried to stand. Maybe she should have known that drinking such a strong drink could cause her to get sick, but since she didn't know what she was drinking, maybe she couldn't have foreseen that.

Another angle is whether she owed a duty of care to the customer. When she stood up and tried to walk, could a reasonable person have anticipated that getting up in a dizzy state might lead to vomiting and causing harm? But again, she didn't intend to vomit on someone, so perhaps it's not a deliberate act.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Prevail because the graduate should have known the effects. But she didn't know the drink's potency, so maybe she couldn't have known.

Option B: Not prevail because the actions were involuntary. Vomiting is an involuntary act, so she can't be held liable for that.

Option C: Prevail because of offensive touching. But without intent, it's not a battery, so maybe not.

Option D: Prevail because she acted negligently by drinking too much. But if she didn't know the drink's strength, perhaps she wasn't negligent.

Option E: Not prevail because she also suffered. That doesn't seem directly relevant; mutual harm doesn't negate liability.

Option F: Prevail because conduct was extreme and outrageous. That's more for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which requires intent, so probably not.

Option G: Not prevail because the bartender served it. That's a possible defense, but the question is about the graduate's liability, not the bartender's.

Option H: Not prevail because she was unaware of what she was drinking. This ties into whether she could have known the effects, which she might not have.

Option I: Prevail because of emotional distress. Again, that requires intent or recklessness, which may not be present here.

Option J: Not prevail because she didn't intend to harm. Since it's not intentional, that could apply.

So, considering that the graduate's vomiting was an involuntary action resulting from being intoxicated, which she didn't intend, the customer might not prevail. The key here is whether the graduate's actions were intentional or a result of negligence.

In tort law, for negligence, the plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages. If the graduate didn't know the drink's potency, she might not have been negligent in drinking it. Her getting sick and vomiting was an accident, not something she intended or could have reasonably foreseen, perhaps.

Alternatively, some might argue that once she felt dizzy, she should have taken precautions, like sitting down or seeking help instead of trying to walk. But if she was already too intoxicated to make good decisions, that could mitigate against negligence.

Wait, but in some cases, voluntary intoxication can lead to negligence per se if it's considered reckless. But I'm not sure if that applies here. The graduate didn't know the drink was so strong, so maybe she didn't voluntarily get extremely intoxicated beyond her knowledge.

So, putting it all together, the graduate's actions leading to vomiting were likely involuntary and not intentional. Therefore, the customer probably cannot prevail because the graduate didn't act intentionally or negligently in a way that a reasonable person would have foreseen the harm.

Looking at the options, option B says the plaintiff won't prevail because the graduate's actions were involuntary. Option J says the same because there was no intent. But the question is whether the actions were involuntary or whether there was intent.

Vomiting is an involuntary action, so option B might be the correct choice. Alternatively, if the act of standing up was negligent, but I think the key is that the vomiting itself was not under her control.

So, the correct answer is likely option B or J. But wait, option J is about intent, which is more about intentional torts. The graduate didn't intend to vomit on the customer. So, the claim would likely be for negligence, not intentional tort.

In negligence, the issue is whether the graduate breached a duty of care. If her actions were involuntary, then perhaps there's no negligence. But if she acted carelessly by getting up while dizzy, that could be negligence.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Another approach: if the plaintiff claims negligence, the graduate's defense could be that her actions were involuntary, meaning she couldn't control them. So, the act of vomiting wasn't something she could have prevented, making it not a negligent act.

Therefore, the customer would not prevail because the graduate's actions were involuntary (option B).

Alternatively, option J says the graduate didn't intend to harm, which covers intentional torts but not negligence. But the question is about whether the plaintiff will prevail, which would require the graduate to be at fault either intentionally or negligently.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the best answer is B: not prevail because the actions were involuntary.

The scenario involves a graduate who, after drinking an extremely potent cocktail she was unfamiliar with, became dizzy and vomited on a customer, causing embarrassment and humiliation. The question revolves around whether the customer can successfully sue the graduate for this incident.

To analyze this, several legal theories are considered:

1. **Battery**: This requires an intentional harmful or offensive touching. However, the graduate's vomiting was involuntary, not deliberate, so this does not apply.

2. **Negligence**: For negligence, the plaintiff must show that the graduate breached a duty of care. The graduate, unaware of the drink's potency, could not have reasonably foreseen the effects. While standing up in a dizzy state might raise questions of recklessness, her actions were likely involuntary once she became intoxicated.

3. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress**: This requires extreme and outrageous conduct intended to cause harm. The graduate's actions do not meet this standard, as there was no intent to harm.

4. **Involuntary Actions**: Vomiting is an involuntary act, and the graduate could not have controlled it. This makes it difficult to establish liability based on negligence or intent.

The key issue is that the graduate's actions were involuntary and not intentional. Therefore, the customer is unlikely to prevail in a claim against her.

**Answer: B**
