Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. I'm a bit rusty on the exact principles, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which principle is NOT part of Darwin's theory. The options are A through J. I remember that Darwin's main ideas include things like natural selection, variation in populations, gradual changes over time, and the struggle for existence leading to survival of the fittest.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Evolution does not occur within an individual's lifespan. I think Darwin believed that evolution happens at the population level, not within individuals. So an individual doesn't evolve; it's the population that changes over generations. So A sounds correct as a part of his theory.

Option B: Natural selection favors traits beneficial for survival. Yes, that's a core part of Darwin's idea. So B is part of his theory.

Option C: Evolution occurs in response to environmental changes. I recall that environmental pressures drive natural selection, so C fits.

Option D: Every population has tremendous variation. Right, variation is a key starting point. Without variation, natural selection wouldn't have anything to act upon. So D is correct.

Option E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. I think Darwin didn't have the modern understanding of genetics. He might not have considered that traits acquired during a lifetime (like muscle strength from exercise) could be passed on. That was more of Lamarck's idea with use and disuse. So E might be something not part of Darwin's theory. But wait, modern evolution includes genetic variation, so maybe this refers to mutations or something else. Or perhaps E is incorrect because Darwin didn't include the idea of acquired traits being inherited.

Option F: Survival of the fittest ensures the strongest survive. Yes, that's a key concept, though the term was actually coined by Herbert Spencer. So F is part of the theory.

Option G: Evolution is gradual over a long time. Yes, Darwin emphasized gradualism. So G is in the theory.

Option H: Every species can evolve. I think that's true because all species have variation and are subject to natural selection. So H is part.

Option I: Overpopulation leads to competition. Yes, Darwin was influenced by Malthus' ideas about population growth leading to a struggle for existence. So I is correct.

Option J: Mutations are the main source of variation. Hmm, wait. Darwin didn't really understand genetics. He didn't know about mutations as the source of variation. His theory relied more on existing variation without knowing the cause. Modern synthesis includes mutations, but I'm not sure if Darwin considered them as the main source. So J might be the incorrect principle in his original theory.

Wait, the question is about what's NOT part of Darwin's theory. So looking back:

Option E says species can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. That sounds like Lamarckism, which Darwin didn't support in that way. He believed in variation being present, not acquired traits.

Option J says mutations are the main source of variation. Since Darwin didn't have the concept of mutations, he might have attributed variation to other factors, like environmental influences or blending of traits, but not genetic mutations as we understand them.

Wait, but in the original theory, Darwin didn't have the mechanism for variation, right? He observed that variation exists but didn't explain its origin. So mutation wasn't part of his theory. So J would be a principle not part of his theory.

So which option is the incorrect principle? The question is asking for which is NOT part of Darwin's theory.

So, looking again:

E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. That's Lamarck's idea, not Darwin's. So E is not part of Darwin's theory.

J: Mutations as main source. Since Darwin didn't include mutations, J is also not part.

Wait, but the original question is about which is NOT part of the theory. So which of these options is incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Darwin's theory includes:

1. Variation exists in populations.

2. Heritable variation (though he didn't know the mechanism).

3. Struggle for existence due to overpopulation.

4. Natural selection acting on variation, favoring beneficial traits.

5. Gradual changes over time leading to species change.

So which options don't fit.

Option E: Species develop new traits during lifetime and pass on. That's Lamarck's use/disuse idea, which Darwin didn't support. So E is incorrect as part of his theory.

Option J: Mutations as main source. Since Darwin didn't know about mutations, J is not part of his theory.

Wait, but the question is to pick one answer. So which is the correct answer?

The question is asking which is NOT part of Darwin's theory.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: This is about inheriting acquired traits, which Darwin didn't believe in. So E would not be part of his theory.

Option J: Since Darwin didn't propose mutations as the source, J is also not part. But is J part of modern evolutionary theory? Yes, but the question is about Darwin's theory.

So the options are E and J as possible answers. The question is which is not part.

Wait, the question is phrased: which is NOT part of the theory.

So, the options:

E is about species developing new traits during their lifetime and passing them on. That's Lamarckism, which is incorrect according to Darwin.

J is about mutations being the main source of variation. Darwin didn't include this in his theory; he didn't know about genetic mutations. So J is a principle not part of his theory.

Wait, but in his time, the idea of mutation as a source of variation wasn't established. So J would be the incorrect part of his theory.

Wait, but Option E is about acquiring traits during a lifetime and passing them on, which is not part of Darwin's theory. So E is incorrect.

So now I'm a bit confused. Which one is the correct answer?

Looking back, the question is about which is NOT part of Darwin's theory.

So, the correct answer would be either E or J.

But let's think again. Darwin's theory includes the idea that variation exists but doesn't specify the source. So J is a statement that mutations are the main source, which Darwin didn't include. So J is not part of his theory.

E suggests that species can develop new traits in their lifetime and pass them on. That's not part of Darwin's theory either, as he rejected Lamarck's idea.

Wait, but the options are E and J as possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about what each option states.

Option E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. So, this is about the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which is Lamarckian. Darwin did not accept this; his theory relies on existing variation, not the acquisition of new traits through use or environment during an organism's life.

Option J: Mutations are the main source of variation. Since Darwin didn't have the concept of genetic mutations, this is a part of the modern synthesis, not his original theory.

So which of these is NOT part of Darwin's theory.

The question is, which is NOT part. So both E and J are not part of Darwin's theory, but wait, let's look at the options again.

Wait, the question is about which is not part, so only one option is correct.

But wait, the options are all from A to J, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should consider which of these are actually part of the theory.

Option E is incorrect because Darwin's theory doesn't include the idea that organisms can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. So E is not part of the theory.

Option J is also not part of Darwin's theory because he didn't know about mutations as the source.

So which one is the correct answer to the question.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the question is about what's NOT included in his theory. Among the options, I think E is not part of the theory, and J is also not part. But wait, the question is which is NOT part. So perhaps E is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, because mutations as the main source came later with the modern synthesis.

Wait, but the question is about Darwin's theory, not the modern version. So, for Darwin, variation was present but the source was not mutations. So J is not part of his theory.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

The correct answer is E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime and pass them on. Because that's Lamarckian, which Darwin did not include. So E is the incorrect principle.

Wait, but in the initial theory, Darwin didn't have a mechanism for variation, but he did not rely on acquired traits. So E is not part of his theory.

So the correct answer would be E.

Alternatively, option J: Mutations as main source. Since Darwin didn't know about mutations, J is not part of his theory.

Hmm. So which one is the correct answer? The question is which is NOT part of Darwin's theory.

I think both E and J are not part of his theory, but I'm supposed to choose one.

Wait, the options are:

E: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on.

J: Mutations are the main source of variation.

So which is not part of Darwin's theory.

So, based on what I know, Darwin did not include the idea that organisms can acquire new traits during their lifetime and pass them on (Lamarck). E is not part.

Darwin also didn't include mutations, but in his time, that wasn't known. So J is also not part, but perhaps more so, J is a modern concept.

Wait, but the question is about Darwin's theory. So J would not be part. So in the options, which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, because E is about the inheritance of acquired traits, which is not part of Darwin's theory.

Alternatively, the question's answer is E.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is E.

To determine which principle is NOT part of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, let us analyze each option carefully:

- **Option A**: Evolution does not occur within an individual's lifespan. This aligns with Darwin's view that evolution occurs at the population level over generations, not within an individual's lifetime. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option B**: Natural selection favors traits that are beneficial for survival. This is a core principle of Darwin's theory, as natural selection acts on existing variation to favor advantageous traits. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option C**: Evolution occurs in response to changes in the environment. Darwin's theory emphasizes that environmental pressures drive natural selection, making this a key part of his framework. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option D**: Every population has tremendous variation. Variation is a foundational aspect of Darwin's theory, as it provides the raw material for natural selection. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option E**: Species can develop new traits during their lifetime, which they can pass on to their offspring. This describes Lamarck's idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which Darwin did not support. Darwin's theory relies on pre-existing variation, not the acquisition of new traits during an organism's lifetime. **This is NOT part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option F**: Survival of the fittest ensures that only the strongest survive. While the phrase "survival of the fittest" was coined by Herbert Spencer, it encapsulates Darwin's idea of natural selection favoring individuals with advantageous traits. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option G**: Evolution is a gradual process that occurs over a long period of time. Darwin emphasized gradualism in evolution, making this a key aspect of his theory. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option H**: Every species has the potential to evolve. Darwin's theory implies that all species can evolve over time due to variation and natural selection. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option I**: Organisms will overpopulate an area, giving rise to competition. This reflects Darwin's incorporation of Malthusian ideas about population growth and the resulting struggle for existence. **This is part of Darwin's theory.**

- **Option J**: Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population. Darwin did not understand the role of genetic mutations as a source of variation, as this concept was developed later in the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology. **This is NOT part of Darwin's theory.**

Between **Option E** and **Option J**, both are not part of Darwin's theory. However, the question asks for a single answer. Since **Option E** directly contradicts Darwin's rejection of Lamarckian inheritance of acquired traits, it is the most appropriate choice.

**Answer: E**
