Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
C: admissible as non-hearsay.
D: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
E: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
F: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
G: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
H: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
I: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question about hearsay exceptions. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a car accident where a man and a woman are involved. The man switched lanes without signaling, causing the woman to hit his car. After the accident, a pedestrian who saw the accident yells at the man, calling him a careless driver and mentions that he should have used a turn signal. Now, the pedestrian isn't identified and isn't present at trial. The question is about whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence, particularly regarding hearsay and its exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

So the pedestrian's statement is being offered to prove that the man was careless, right? That would make it hearsay because it's a statement made outside of court being used to establish the truth of the matter (that the man was careless).

Now, looking at the exceptions. The main ones that come to mind are excited utterance (Federal Rule 803(2)), present sense impression (803(1)), and maybe the residual exception, but I think the first two are more relevant here.

An excited utterance is a statement made under the stress or excitement of a startling event. The idea is that such statements are reliable because the person is reacting spontaneously without time to fabricate. For it to apply, the statement must relate to the event and be made while the declarant is under the stress of the event.

In this case, the pedestrian just saw the accident, which is a startling event. He was emotional and upset, and he ran up immediately after the accident. His statement was made in the heat of the moment, so it seems like it could qualify as an excited utterance.

Alternatively, a present sense impression is a statement describing an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. The pedestrian's statement about the man not signaling would be a description of what he just perceived. But wait, the accident just happened, so he made the statement right after. However, the statement isn't just a description; it's an accusation. So maybe it's more about his opinion rather than a factual description.

Wait, the pedestrian's statement is "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" So he's both calling the man careless and stating that he should have used a turn signal. The latter part implies that the pedestrian saw the man switch lanes without signaling. So maybe that part is a present sense impression.

But the question is whether the entire statement is admissible. The key is whether it's an excited utterance. The pedestrian was upset, so his statement could be an excited utterance. Also, the statement was made immediately after the accident, so the time factor fits.

Another point: the pedestrian isn't present at trial, but the statement's admissibility doesn't depend on the declarant being available if it falls under an exception.

Looking at the answer options:

Option B is admissible under excited utterance exception. Option E is present sense impression. Option I is spontaneous statement, which I think is similar to excited utterance.

Wait, excited utterance is a specific exception under 803(2). Spontaneous statement might be another term for it or another exception, but I think excited utterance is the correct term here.

So the pedestrian's statement was made under stress, immediately after the accident. It relates to the event he just witnessed. Therefore, it should be admissible as an excited utterance.

Other options: Option C says it's non-hearsay. But the statement is being offered for the truth (that the man was careless), so it's hearsay. So C is incorrect.

Option D says it's admissible even though it's hearsay, which is true because of the exception, but the question is which option is correct, and B and E are more specific.

Option A says it's inadmissible because the bystander wasn't involved. But that's not a hearsay rule; the involvement doesn't determine admissibility. So A is incorrect.

Option G says it's inadmissible because the bystander isn't identified or present. But hearsay exceptions don't require the declarant to be present if the statement otherwise qualifies. So G is incorrect.

Option F says it's inadmissible as opinion. The statement is more of an opinion ("careless driver"), but under the hearsay exceptions, opinions in excited utterances are admissible. So F is incorrect.

Option H says it's inadmissible because it's prejudicial. While it's prejudicial, that doesn't automatically make it inadmissible. The rules about prejudice relate more to when the probative value is substantially outweighed, but the question is about hearsay, not Rule 403. So H is not the right reason.

So the correct answer should be B: admissible under the excited utterance exception.

The pedestrian's statement is being offered to prove that the man was careless, which makes it hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under an exception. 

The pedestrian's statement was made immediately after witnessing the accident, while he was emotional and upset. This indicates that the statement was made under the stress of the startling event (the car accident), making it admissible under the excited utterance exception (Federal Rule 803(2)). The statement relates to the event and was made while the pedestrian was still under the stress of what he had just observed. 

Other options are incorrect because:
- The statement is hearsay, so it cannot be non-hearsay (Option C).
- The bystander's lack of identification or presence at trial does not affect the admissibility of the statement under the excited utterance exception (Option G).
- The statement is not inadmissible solely because it is prejudicial; the rules of evidence do not exclude it on that basis (Option H).
- While the statement describes the event, it is more accurately categorized under the excited utterance exception rather than the present sense impression exception (Option E).

Thus, the correct answer is that the pedestrian's statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception.

Answer: B
