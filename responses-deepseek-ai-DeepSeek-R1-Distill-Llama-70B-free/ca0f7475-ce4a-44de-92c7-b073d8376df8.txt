Question:

An online store uses 6-bit binary sequences to identify each unique item for sale. The store plans to increase the number of items it sells and is considering using 7-bit binary sequences. Which of the following best describes the result of using 7-bit sequences instead of 6- bit sequences?

Options:

A: 10 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
B: 2 more items can be uniquely identified.
C: 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
D: The number of uniquely identified items will remain the same.
E: 3 times as many items can be uniquely identified.
F: Half as many items can be uniquely identified.
G: 128 more items can be uniquely identified.
H: 10 more items can be uniquely identified.
I: 4 times as many items can be uniquely identified.

Okay, so I've got this question here about binary sequences used by an online store. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about how changing from 6-bit to 7-bit binary sequences affects the number of unique items they can identify.

Alright, I remember that in binary, each bit represents a power of two. So for a 6-bit sequence, the total number of possible combinations should be 2^6. Let me calculate that. 2^6 is 64. So that means with 6 bits, they can have 64 unique items, right?

Now, they're thinking of moving to 7-bit sequences. So for 7 bits, it's 2^7. Let's see, 2^7 is 128. Oh, so the number of unique items would double because 64 times 2 is 128. Wait, so does that mean they can identify twice as many items?

Looking at the options, option C says "2 times as many items can be uniquely identified." That makes sense because each additional bit doubles the number of possible combinations. So moving from 6 to 7 bits would double it from 64 to 128.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the options again. Option A says 10 times, which seems too high. Option B is 2 more, which is like adding 2, but that doesn't fit because 64 plus 2 is 66, not 128. Option E is 3 times, which would be 192, which is more than 128. So that's not right.

Option G says 128 more items. Hmm, 64 plus 128 is 192, which is way more than what 7 bits give. Wait, no, because 7 bits is 128 total, so it's 64 more than 64, not 128. So 64 to 128 is an increase of 64, not 128. So G isn't correct because it's 128 more, which would imply 64 (original) plus 128 equals 192, but that's 2^7 is 128, which is less than that. Wait, no, 2^7 is 128, which is 64 more than 64. So the increase is 64, but the total is 128. So G is not correct. Because 128 is the total, not the increase.

So the question is about the result of using 7-bit instead of 6-bit. So it's about how many more can be identified. Oh wait, the options are about the result. So in terms of how many times as many, it's 128 / 64 = 2 times as much. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think is each additional bit doubles the capacity. So adding one bit doubles the number. So 6 bits is 64, 7 is 128, which is double. So the number of items that can be uniquely identified is double.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option G says 128 more items. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The number of possible sequences with 7 bits is 128. So 6 bits gives 64, 7 gives 128. So the increase is 64, which is double the original. So the total is double, or 2 times as many.

So yeah, option C is correct. So the answer should be C.

The question involves understanding how the number of unique items that can be identified changes when moving from 6-bit to 7-bit binary sequences. 

- A 6-bit binary sequence can represent \( 2^6 = 64 \) unique items.
- A 7-bit binary sequence can represent \( 2^7 = 128 \) unique items.
- The increase in the number of unique items is \( 128 - 64 = 64 \), which is double the original number of items.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as 10 times 64 is 640, which is far more than 128.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as adding 2 to 64 gives 66, not 128.
- **Option C**: Correct, as 128 is exactly 2 times 64.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the number of items does not remain the same.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as 3 times 64 is 192, which exceeds 128.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as halving 64 gives 32, not 128.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as 128 more than 64 would imply 192, which is not the case.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as adding 10 to 64 gives 74, not 128.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as 4 times 64 is 256, which is more than 128.

Thus, moving from 6-bit to 7-bit sequences doubles the number of unique items that can be identified, making **Option C** the correct answer.
