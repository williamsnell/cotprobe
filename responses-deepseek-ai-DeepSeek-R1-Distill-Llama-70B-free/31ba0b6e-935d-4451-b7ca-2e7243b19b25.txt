Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking how the Arabic numeral for '2' is written. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that Arabic numerals are the numbers we use every day, like 1, 2, 3, etc. So the question is about what symbol represents the number two in this system. I think it's pretty straightforward because I use these numbers daily.

Looking at the options provided:

A: IIi – Wait, that looks like Roman numerals. Roman II is 2, but the 'i' at the end is unusual. Maybe a typo? I don't think that's an Arabic numeral.

B: Zwei – Oh, that's the German word for two, not a numeral.

C: Deux – That's French for two, again a word, not a numeral.

D: Dos – Spanish for two, same here, just a word in another language.

E: I – That's Roman numeral for 1, so not two.

F: Two – That's the English word for the number, but not the numeral itself.

G: 22 – That's the number twenty-two, so not two.

H: 2 – Wait, that's the Arabic numeral for two. This looks promising.

I: ii – That's lowercase Roman numerals for two, but the question is about Arabic.

J: II – Uppercase Roman numerals for two. Again, not Arabic.

So the options are between H and maybe none of the others. Since the question specifically asks for the Arabic numeral, which is the digit we use, the answer should be H: 2.

The Arabic numeral for '2' is the digit 2. 

H: 2

Answer: H
