Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The question is about what happens when the economy is operating beyond full employment. Hmm, I remember that full employment doesn't mean zero unemployment, but rather that the economy is producing at its maximum potential, so unemployment is at a natural rate. Operating beyond full employment would mean the economy is producing more than its potential, right? So, that's probably in the realm of macroeconomics, specifically looking at aggregate demand and supply.

The options are A through J. I'll have to think about each one in the context of the economy beyond full employment.

First, I need to recall the shape of the aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) curves. In the short run, the AS curve is typically upward sloping, but when the economy is beyond full employment, the AS curve becomes vertical. Because beyond full employment, the economy can't produce more without causing inflation, so further increases in AD can't increase real output. So that might relate to some of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The government should implement policies to increase aggregate demand. Wait, if the economy is beyond full employment, increasing AD further would probably lead to higher inflation, not more output. So this might not be a good idea. I think governments usually try to reduce AD in such cases, not increase.

Option B: The short-run AS curve is horizontal. No, the horizontal AS is when prices are sticky and firms increase output as AD increases. But beyond full employment, AS is vertical, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Further AD increases will decrease inflation. That seems opposite. More AD beyond full employment would cause inflation to rise, not decrease. So C is wrong.

Option D: Further increases in AD won't lower unemployment but will cause inflation. That makes sense. Since the economy is beyond full employment, unemployment is already as low as it can go. More AD would lead to higher prices, so inflation increases. So D is a possible correct answer.

Option E: The economy will return to full employment on its own. I think that's related to the long run when prices adjust, but in the short run, it's stuck beyond full employment. I'm not sure, but maybe E isn't correct because it's implying automatic adjustment without any policy changes.

Option F: Decrease in AD will lower the price level if prices are sticky. Wait, if prices are sticky, in the short run, a decrease in AD could reduce output but not prices. Or maybe when the economy is beyond full employment, which is a high AD situation, reducing AD might bring it back, but I'm not sure about the price level. If prices are sticky, maybe they don't adjust much. So F might not be correct in this scenario.

Option G: The short-run AS curve is vertical. Yes, beyond full employment, AS is vertical. So G is a correct statement. But the question is about what is true when the economy is beyond full employment. So both G and D could be correct. Wait, the question asks which is true, so perhaps more than one option is correct, but looking at the options, I need to pick the best one.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with single answer, so I need to see which options are correct.

Option H: The economy is at risk of recession. That doesn't seem right. Beyond full employment, with high AD, the economy is more at risk of inflation, not recession. Unless it's a bubble, but generally, H might not be correct.

Option I: Further AD increases will lower price level. No, that's not right. More AD would lead to higher prices, not lower, because the economy can't produce more. So I is wrong.

Option J: Decrease in AD leads to higher price level. That doesn't make sense. If AD decreases, price level should go down, not up. So J is incorrect.

So, now evaluating the options, I think both D and G are correct statements.

Wait, the question is phrased as "Which of the following is true at this point?" So perhaps both D and G are correct. But in the options, each is separate. Let me double-check.

Option D says further increases in AD won't lower unemployment but will create inflation. That's correct because the economy is beyond full employment, so no more reduction in unemployment.

Option G says the short-run AS is vertical, which is correct beyond full employment.

So both D and G are correct. But the options are separate, so I must choose which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question asks which is true. So both D and G are correct, but I need to check which of them is among the options. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

D: Further increases in AD won't lower unemployment but will create inflation.

G: The short-run AS curve is vertical.

So both D and G are correct. But the question gives options A to J, and I need to choose one.

Wait, perhaps in the context of the question, the correct answer is D because it's directly about the effect of increasing AD beyond full employment. Alternatively, G is a statement about the AS curve, which is also correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Beyond full employment, the AS curve becomes vertical. So any increase in AD can't increase output, only prices. So both statements D and G are correct. But looking at the options, the question is which is true. So perhaps both D and G are correct, but in the given options, which one is present.

Wait, in the options, both D and G are present. So I need to see which one is the correct answer according to the question.

Wait, the question is about what is true when the economy is beyond full employment. So both D and G are correct, but the options may have both as choices. Wait, the options are provided as A to J, and each is a separate option.

Wait, I think the correct options are both D and G. But since the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again. The economy beyond full employment implies that it's to the right of the full employment level on the AS-AD graph. At that point, the AS curve is vertical, so G is correct. Also, any further AD increase won't change output, only prices, which is what D says.

So the correct options are both D and G. But the question is presented as a standard multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options are:

D: Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.

G: The short-run aggregate supply curve is vertical.

So both are correct. But in the options, they are separate. So perhaps the correct answer includes both D and G. However, the way the question is phrased suggests that only one option is correct.

Wait, looking back, the question is: "Which of the following is true at this point?" So multiple could be true, but the options are presented as single choices, so I must pick the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps D is the correct answer because it's a direct consequence, while G is a statement about the curve's shape, which is also correct.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "which of the following is true," so both D and G are true. But in the options, they are separate. So perhaps the intended answer is D, because it's about the effect of increasing AD beyond full employment, which is a key concept. Or perhaps G is also correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D. Because when the economy is beyond full employment, any increase in AD cannot lower unemployment (since it's already at the minimum), and will only cause inflation. So D is correct.

But G is also correct because beyond full employment, the AS curve is vertical. So perhaps the answer includes both, but the options don't allow for that. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about the AS-AD model. When the economy is operating beyond full employment, it's at a point where the AS curve is vertical. So G is correct. Also, any further increase in AD would cause prices to rise without increasing output, which is what D says.

So both D and G are correct statements. But in the options, each is a separate choice, so perhaps the correct answer is both D and G. But in the given options, that's not possible. So perhaps I need to see which one is more directly addressing the situation.

Wait, the question is phrased as "which of the following is true". So I think both D and G are correct, but the options don't have a combined choice. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps G is correct because it's a statement about the AS curve's shape, which is a key point.

Wait, I think I remember that when the economy is beyond full employment, the AS curve is vertical, so G is correct. Also, D is correct in its statement. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but in the options, they are separate. So I must choose the best answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's directly about the effect of increasing AD beyond full employment.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. But given that the options are separate, I think the correct answer is D: Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.

When the economy is operating beyond full employment, it is producing beyond its potential output, and unemployment is at its natural rate. In this scenario, the short-run aggregate supply (AS) curve becomes vertical, meaning that any further increases in aggregate demand (AD) will not increase real output but will instead lead to higher prices, i.e., inflation. This is because the economy is already at maximum capacity, and additional demand cannot be met with increased production.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Increasing AD further would not be advisable, as it would lead to inflation, not more output.
- **B**: Incorrect. The short-run AS curve is not horizontal beyond full employment; it is vertical.
- **C**: Incorrect. Further increases in AD will not decrease inflation; they will increase it.
- **D**: Correct. Beyond full employment, further increases in AD will not reduce unemployment but will create inflation.
- **E**: Incorrect. The economy will not automatically return to full employment without intervention in the short run.
- **F**: Incorrect. If prices are sticky, a decrease in AD might reduce output but not necessarily the price level.
- **G**: Correct. Beyond full employment, the short-run AS curve is vertical.
- **H**: Incorrect. The economy is not at risk of a recession; it is at risk of inflation.
- **I**: Incorrect. Further increases in AD will not lower the price level; they will increase it.
- **J**: Incorrect. A decrease in AD would lead to a lower price level, not a higher one.

Both **D** and **G** are correct statements. However, since the question requires selecting one answer, **D** is the more direct and relevant choice because it specifically addresses the effects of increasing AD beyond full employment, which is the focus of the question.

Answer: D
