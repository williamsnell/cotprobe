To find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of \( y = x + e^x \) at \( x = 0 \), we follow these steps:

1. **Find the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \):**  
   The derivative, \( y' \), represents the slope of the tangent line at any point \( x \).  
   \[
   y' = \frac{d}{dx}(x) + \frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = 1 + e^x
   \]

2. **Evaluate the derivative at \( x = 0 \):**  
   This gives the slope of the tangent line at \( x = 0 \).  
   \[
   y' \big|_{x=0} = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
   \]

3. **Evaluate the original function at \( x = 0 \):**  
   This gives the \( y \)-coordinate of the point where the tangent line touches the graph.  
   \[
   y \big|_{x=0} = 0 + e^0 = 0 + 1 = 1
   \]

4. **Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line:**  
   The point-slope form is \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( (x_1, y_1) \) is a point on the line. Substituting \( m = 2 \), \( x_1 = 0 \), and \( y_1 = 1 \):  
   \[
   y - 1 = 2(x - 0)
   \]
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   y = 2x + 1
   \]

5. **Compare with the given options:**  
   The equation \( y = 2x + 1 \) matches option **G**.
