Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to find the change in internal energy, ΔU, for a gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic compression. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the problem states that it's a diatomic gas, right? Oh wait, but wait, the molar heat capacity Cv is given as 27.5 J/(K·mol). I remember that for diatomic gases, the molar heat capacities at constant volume are different. Like, for monatomic gases, Cv is (3/2)R, which is about 12.5 J/(K·mol). But diatomic, at room temperature, has a higher Cv because they can rotate and stuff. Oh, right, diatomic has Cv as (5/2)R, which is 20.8 J/(K·mol). Wait, but wait, the given Cv is 27.5. Hmm, that's higher than 20.8. Maybe it's at higher temperatures where vibrational modes kick in? Or maybe it's a typo, but I should go with what's given.

So the process is adiabatic and reversible, so it's an isentropic process. For such processes, we can use the relation between temperature and volume change. But wait, since the problem gives a change in temperature, maybe it's easier to find ΔU directly from the temperature change.

Wait, ΔU for an ideal gas depends only on temperature change. Right, because for ideal gases, the internal energy is a function of temperature only. So ΔU equals n times Cv times (T2 - T1), right?

Let me jot that down. So ΔU = n*Cv,m*(T2 - T1).

The given values are: n=3.00 mol, Cv,m=27.5 J/(K·mol), T1=200 K, T2=250 K.

So plugging the numbers: 3.00 mol * 27.5 J/(K·mol) * (250 - 200) K.

Wait, 250-200 is 50 K. So 3 * 27.5 = 82.5, then 82.5 *50 = 4125 J. Which is 4.125 kJ. Hmm, looking at the options, option J is +4.5 kJ, option I is +4.8, option E is +3.7, G is 4.1. So none of them say exactly 4.125 kJ. Wait, did I do the calculation right?

Wait 3 * 27.5 = 82.5, yes. 82.5 *50 = 4125 J, which is 4.125 kJ. So approximately 4.1 kJ. Oh, but wait, option G is 4.1 kJ. But wait, another thought: is Cv the molar heat capacity at constant volume? Yes, the question says C_{V,m} is 27.5. So yes, the calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Since the process is adiabatic, Q=0. And ΔU equals Q + W, but since Q=0, ΔU=W. But wait, in an adiabatic process, the work done is at the expense of internal energy. Oh wait, but in this case, the gas is being compressed, so work is done on the gas. So the internal energy increases, which matches the positive ΔU we have. So our calculation is correct.

But wait, why don't any of the options exactly match 4.125 kJ? Let me check the options again. Option G is +4.1 kJ. So that's the closest. So perhaps the answer is G.

But wait, wait another thought: diatomic gases normally have a certain Cv. Oh wait, the problem states it's diatomic, but the given Cv is 27.5 J/(K·mol). Let me calculate what (7/2)R would be. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), so 7/2 *8.314 is about 29.099 J/(K·mol). Hmm, 27.5 is a bit less than that. Maybe it's a typo and should be monatomic? No, the problem says diatomic. Well, but regardless, the Cv given is 27.5, so I have to use that.

Wait, perhaps I made a unit error. Let's see: 3 mol * 27.5 J/(mol·K) is 82.5 J/K. Multiply by 50 K gives 4125 J, which is 4.125 kJ. So 4.125, which rounds to 4.1 kJ. So the correct option is G.

Wait, but another thought: if the process is adiabatic and reversible, then another formula comes into play, involving the relation between T and V or T and P. But in this case, since the change in temperature is given, and we're dealing with internal energy, which depends only on temperature, we don't need those other relations. So the calculation is correct.

So the answer should be G: +4.1 kJ.

To calculate the change in internal energy, ΔU, for the given adiabatic process, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta U = n \cdot C_{V,m} \cdot (T_2 - T_1)
\]

Here:
- \( n = 3.00 \, \text{mol} \),
- \( C_{V,m} = 27.5 \, \text{J} \, \text{K}^{-1} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \),
- \( T_1 = 200 \, \text{K} \),
- \( T_2 = 250 \, \text{K} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta U = 3.00 \cdot 27.5 \cdot (250 - 200)
\]

\[
\Delta U = 3.00 \cdot 27.5 \cdot 50 = 4125 \, \text{J} = 4.125 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

This value rounds to \( +4.1 \, \text{kJ} \), which matches option G. The process is adiabatic, so \( Q = 0 \), and the internal energy increases due to work done on the gas during compression. The calculation is consistent with the given data and the thermodynamic principles for ideal gases.
