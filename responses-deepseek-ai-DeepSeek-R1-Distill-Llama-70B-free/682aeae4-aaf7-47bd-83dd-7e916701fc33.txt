Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychology theories. The question is asking which theory is built around the principle that people make choices based on their values and beliefs. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Let me start by recalling what each of these theories is about. The options are A through J, so I'll go through each one.

Option A is Social Learning. From what I remember, social learning theory, proposed by Albert Bandura, suggests that people learn behaviors by observing and imitating others. It's about observation, imitation, and modeling. So it's more about how we learn from others rather than making choices based on our own values and beliefs. So maybe not A.

Option B is Contingency. I'm not too sure about this one. Contingency might relate to Skinner's operant conditioning, where behavior is controlled by its consequences. But wait, contingency is more about the conditions under which reinforcement is given. Not sure if that's directly related to values and beliefs.

Option C is Operant Conditioning. That's definitely Skinner's work. Operant conditioning is about behavior being controlled by its consequencesâ€”rewards or punishments. So it's about external factors influencing behavior, not internal values or beliefs. So C might not be the right answer.

Option D is Evolutionary. Evolutionary psychology explains behavior based on natural selection and genetic factors. It looks at how behaviors have evolved over time to enhance survival. While it might touch on why certain values exist, I don't think it's specifically about making choices based on personal values and beliefs. So probably not D.

Option E is Classical Conditioning. That's Pavlov's work, right? It's about associating stimuli with responses, like the bell and salivation in dogs. This is more about automatic responses rather than conscious choices based on values. So E is out.

Option F is Expectancy. Expectancy theory, I think, is from the cognitive perspective. It suggests that behavior is motivated by the expectation of certain outcomes. So people choose behaviors they believe will lead to desired results. This does involve some cognitive processes, possibly including beliefs about outcomes. But the question emphasizes values and beliefs, so maybe. But I'm not certain.

Option G is Psychoanalytic. That's Freud's theory, focusing on the unconscious mind, repression, and internal conflicts. It's more about unconscious drives rather than conscious choices based on values and beliefs. So G doesn't fit.

Option H is Instrumental. Instrumental learning is another term for operant conditioning, which I already considered under option C. So H is also about external reinforcement, not internal values.

Option I is Cognitive Dissonance. This is from Festinger's theory, which states that people experience discomfort when their beliefs and actions conflict. They then try to reduce this discomfort. While it involves beliefs, it's more about consistency between beliefs and actions rather than making choices based on values and beliefs in general. So I might not be the answer.

Option J is Humanistic. Humanistic psychology emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and individual potential. It focuses on people's inherent drive to self-actualize and their free will to choose their behavior. This theory, which includes Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, definitely talks about how people make choices based on their values and beliefs. So J seems like a strong candidate.

Wait, but what about option F: Expectancy? That could involve beliefs about what will happen if you choose a certain action. So maybe it's related. But humanistic theory is more directly about values and personal growth. So I think J is more accurate.

So putting it all together, the theory that revolves around people making choices based on their values and beliefs is the Humanistic theory, which is option J.

The theory that is built around the principle that people make choices regarding how to behave based on values and beliefs is the Humanistic theory. This theory emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and the individual's free will to choose behavior aligned with their values and beliefs. It is most closely associated with psychologists like Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow.

Answer: J
