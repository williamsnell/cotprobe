Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down.

The question is asking about two principles that deal with questions of values. The options are A through J, each pairing different terms. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to understand what the question is really about. It's about principles that handle value-related questions. So, what are the main areas that deal with values?

Well, I remember that ethics is definitely one. Ethics is all about moral principles and values, right? It's the study of what's right and wrong, good and bad. So one of the principles is probably ethics.

Now, what's the other one? Let's look at the options. Option D pairs religion and ethics. That makes sense because religion often deals with values too. Many religions have teachings about morality, so they definitely address questions of value.

Let me go through the other options to make sure. Option A is faith and science. Faith is related to religion, but science is more about facts and evidence, not so much values. So probably not A.

Option B is faith and legal. Legal systems do deal with right and wrong in terms of laws, but I'm not sure if that's exactly the same as values. Maybe, but I'm leaning towards D.

Option C is religion and science. Again, science doesn't focus on values the way religion does, so C might not be right.

Option E is legal and ethics. Both of these do deal with values, but the question is asking for two principles. I'm not sure if legal is considered a principle or more of a system. Plus, the question might be pointing towards more abstract concepts.

Option F is science and legal. Science doesn't focus on values, so F is probably out.

Option G is faith and religion. Those are related, so maybe redundant. They might both fall under similar categories, but I don't think they're the two separate principles the question is asking for.

Option H is legal and religion. Hmm, that's possible, but I'm not sure if legal is the best fit here since it's more about laws than values per se.

Option I is ethics and science. Again, science isn't about values, so I don't think this is correct.

So, putting it all together, I think D: religion and ethics are the two principles that deal with questions of values. Religion provides moral frameworks, and ethics is the study of moral principles. They both handle value-related questions.
