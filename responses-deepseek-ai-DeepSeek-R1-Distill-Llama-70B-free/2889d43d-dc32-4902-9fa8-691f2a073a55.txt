Alright, so I've got this question about dimes and whose profile is on them. I'm not super familiar with all the coins, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that coins in the US have portraits of famous presidents or historical figures. The question is specifically about dimes that are currently in circulation. I know that dimes are the 10-cent coins. 

I think about the different coins I've seen. Pennies have Abraham Lincoln, right? And nickels have Thomas Jefferson. Quarters have different designs now, like the state quarters, but the front is George Washington. 

Wait, what about the dime? I seem to recall that the dime has a profile of a president, but I'm not sure which one. Maybe Franklin D. Roosevelt? Or was it someone else? I think I've heard that the dime has FDR on it. Let me think... Yes, I remember now. The Roosevelt dime was introduced in 1946, I think, to honor him. So the front should be his profile. 

Looking at the options, D is Franklin Roosevelt. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with another coin. The penny is Lincoln, nickel is Jefferson, dime is Roosevelt, quarter is Washington. Yeah, that sounds right. 

I don't think it's John F. Kennedy because I believe the half-dollar has Kennedy on it. So option E isn't correct. And the others like Grant, Jackson, Eisenhower, etc., I don't think they're on the dime. So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's D.
