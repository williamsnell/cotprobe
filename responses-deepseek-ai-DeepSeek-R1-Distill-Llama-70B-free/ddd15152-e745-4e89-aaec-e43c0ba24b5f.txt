Okay, so I have this problem about solutions and vapor pressure, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about an unknown solute dissolving in benzene at 80°C. The solution has 1.25 wt.% of the solute. The vapor pressure of this solution is 752.4 mm Hg, and the boiling point is 80.25°C. Benzene's normal boiling point is 80.00°C. I need to find the molecular weight of the solute, assuming it's non-volatile, and the heat of vaporization per gram for benzene, which has a molecular weight of 78.

Alright, so I think this involves colligative properties. Since the solute is non-volatile, the vapor pressure lowering and boiling point elevation should come into play here. Let me think step by step.

First, part a) is about finding the molecular weight of the solute. I remember that vapor pressure lowering is a colligative property and can be described by Raoult's Law. The formula for vapor pressure lowering is ΔP = X_solute * P_pure, but wait, no, wait. Raoult's Law says that the partial vapor pressure of the solvent is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent times the pure solvent's vapor pressure. So the lowering is P_pure - P_solution.

Wait, the given data includes the solution's vapor pressure. Let me clarify. At 80°C, the pure benzene's vapor pressure should be higher than the solution's, right? Because adding a non-volatile solute lowers the vapor pressure.

Wait, but wait, the solution's vapor pressure is given as 752.4 mm Hg. I don't know the pure benzene's vapor pressure at 80°C. Oh wait, because benzene's boiling point is 80°C, that's where its vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, which is 760 mm Hg. So at 80°C, pure benzene has a vapor pressure of 760 mm Hg. Wait, but the solution's vapor pressure is 752.4, which is lower. That makes sense because the solute is non-volatile.

So the vapor pressure lowering, ΔP, is 760 - 752.4 = 7.6 mm Hg.

Now, using Raoult's law, the lowering is equal to the mole fraction of the solute multiplied by the pure solvent's vapor pressure. Wait no, wait. Raoult's law is P = X_solvent * P_pure. So the lowering is P_pure - P_solution = X_solute * P_pure. Because X_solvent = 1 - X_solute.

Wait, let's get this right. The mole fraction of the solvent (benzene) is X_solvent, and P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure. So P_pure is 760 mm Hg, and P_solution is 752.4. So 752.4 = X_solvent * 760. That means X_solvent = 752.4 / 760 ≈ 0.9905. So X_solute = 1 - 0.9905 = 0.0095.

But wait, the solution is 1.25 wt.% solute. So mass of solute is 1.25% and mass of solvent is 98.75%. Let's think in terms of moles. The mole fraction of solute is (moles of solute) / (moles of solute + moles of solvent).

Let me denote the molecular weight of the solute as M, and the molecular weight of benzene is 78. So for a certain mass, say 100g of solution, 1.25g is solute and 98.75g is benzene.

Moles of benzene = 98.75 / 78 ≈ let's calculate that. 78 goes into 98.75 once, giving 78, so 98.75-78=20.75 left. 20.75 /78 ≈ 0.266. So total is approximately 1.266 moles of benzene.

Moles of solute = 1.25 / M.

So the mole fraction of solute is (1.25/M) / (1.25/M + 1.266).

And we found earlier that X_solute is 0.0095. So setting up the equation:

( (1.25/M) ) / ( (1.25/M) + 1.266 ) = 0.0095

Let me solve for M.

Let me write it as:

(1.25/M) = 0.0095 * (1.25/M + 1.266 )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1.25/M = 0.0095*(1.25/M) + 0.0095*1.266

Bring terms with M to one side:

1.25/M - 0.0095*(1.25/M) = 0.0095 *1.266

Factor out 1/M on the left:

(1.25 - 0.0095 *1.25 ) / M = 0.012137

Compute numerator:

1.25 * (1 - 0.0095/1.25) → Wait, 0.0095 *1.25 = 0.011875. So 1.25 - 0.011875 = 1.238125.

So 1.238125 / M = 0.012137 → M = 1.238125 / 0.012137 ≈ let's compute that.

1.238125 ÷ 0.012137. Let me compute this:

0.012137 * 102 = approx 1.238 (since 0.012137 *100=1.2137; *102=1.2137 + 0.024274 = 1.238). So M≈102? But wait, let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 1.238125 / 0.012137 ≈ Let's compute: 0.012137 × 102 = 1.238 (as above). So M≈102 g/mol.

Wait, but let me compute more precisely. 0.012137 × 102 = 1.238 (exactly, 102 * 0.012137 = 1.238. So 1.238125 is a bit more. So 1.238125 -1.238=0.000125. So 0.000125 / 0.012137 ≈ 0.01. So M≈102.01, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of 1.25/M divided by (1.25/M + 98.75/78) equals 0.0095.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote the mass of solution as 100g. So 1.25g solute, 98.75g solvent.

Moles of benzene: 98.75 /78 = let me compute exactly. 78 *1=78, 78*1.25=97.5, so 98.75-97.5=1.25. Wait, 98.75 /78 = 1.25 + 1.25/78. Hmm, wait, perhaps I should calculate it properly.

98.75 ÷78 = let me do division.

78 ) 98.75 (1.266... 

78 *1 =78 → 98.75-78=20.75. Bring down decimal as needed.

20.75 ÷78 = 0.266 approximately. So 98.75/78 ≈1.266.

So moles of benzene ≈1.266.

Moles of solute: 1.25/M.

Mole fraction of solute is (1.25/M) / (1.25/M +1.266) = 0.0095.

Let me denote n = 1.25/M.

So n/(n +1.266) = 0.0095 → n = 0.0095(n +1.266) → n =0.0095n +0.012137 → n -0.0095n =0.012137 → 0.9905 n = 0.012137 → n=0.012137 / 0.9905 ≈ 0.01225.

But n =1.25/M → 0.01225 =1.25/M → M=1.25 /0.01225 ≈101.11 g/mol. So approximately 101 g/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest I see is option I: 96.9, or maybe option G:110, etc. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, but the solution's vapor pressure is 752.4 mm Hg. Pure benzene's vapor pressure at 80°C is 760 mm Hg because that's its boiling point. So the vapor pressure lowering is 760-752.4=7.6 mm Hg.

The formula for vapor pressure lowering is ΔP = X_solute * P_pure.

So X_solute = ΔP / P_pure =7.6 /760 =0.01 exactly, because 760*0.01=7.6.

Wait, wait, 7.6/760=0.01. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. So X_solute is 0.01, not 0.0095. Oh, I see, because 752.4=760*(1-0.01), so yes, X_solute is 0.01.

Wait, earlier calculation of X_solute as 0.0095 was incorrect. Because 752.4 /760 = 0.990526, so X_solvent is 0.990526, and X_solute is 1-0.990526=0.009474, which is approximately 0.00947, not 0.01. Wait, but 7.6 is exactly 1% of 760, because 1% of 760 is 7.6. So 760-7.6=752.4, which is exactly 99% of 760. So X_solvent is 0.99, so X_solute is 0.01.

Wait, but wait, 752.4 /760 =0.99, so X_solvent is 0.99, so X_solute is 0.01. So earlier calculation of X_solute as 0.0095 was wrong. It's exactly 0.01.

So let me correct the setup.

So X_solute = 0.01.

Going back, for 100g solution, 1.25g solute, 98.75g benzene.

Moles of benzene: 98.75 /78 = let me compute accurately.

78 *1 =78 → 98.75-78=20.75.

20.75 /78 = 0.266 approximately.

So total moles of benzene: 1.266.

Moles of solute:1.25 / M.

Mole fraction of solute: (1.25/M) / (1.25/M +1.266) )=0.01.

So (1.25/M) = 0.01*(1.25/M +1.266)

Multiply both sides:

1.25/M = 0.0125/M + 0.01266

Bring like terms together:

1.25/M -0.0125/M =0.01266 → (1.25 -0.0125)/M =0.01266 →1.2375/M=0.01266 → M=1.2375 /0.01266 ≈ let's compute.

1.2375 ÷0.01266 ≈ 97.75 approximately.

So M≈97.75 g/mol. Looking at the options, option I says 96.9, which is close. Option J is 98, but let me compute more accurately.

Compute 1.2375 /0.01266.

Let me compute 0.01266 *97 = 1.228.

0.01266 *97.7 → 97 *0.01266 =1.228, 0.7 *0.01266=0.008862 → total 1.228+0.008862=1.236862, which is very close to 1.2375.

So 0.01266 *97.7=1.236862, which is just below 1.2375. The difference is 1.2375-1.236862=0.000638.

How much more? 0.000638 /0.01266 ≈0.05. So 97.7 +0.05=97.75.

So M≈97.75, which is approximately 98. The closest option is I)96.9, or perhaps J)98. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option I is 96.9, J is 98.

Hmm, perhaps my calculation is slightly off, but this is close. But wait, let me double-check the exact calculation.

Wait, when I set up the equation correctly, with X_solute=0.01, the M comes to about 97.75, which is approximately 98. So looking at the options, option I is 96.9, which is close but perhaps exact calculation gives a different value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Let me go back.

(1.25/M) / (1.25/M + 98.75/78 ) =0.01.

Compute 98.75/78 exactly.

98.75 ÷78 = let me compute this precisely.

78*1 =78 →98.75-78=20.75.

20.75/78 = 0.266025641... (because 78*0.266025641=20.75).

So 98.75/78 =1.266025641.

Let me denote this as A=1.266025641.

So equation becomes:

(1.25/M) / (1.25/M + A ) =0.01.

Multiply numerator and denominator by M to eliminate M in denominator:

1.25 / (1.25 + A*M ) =0.01.

So,

1.25 =0.01*(1.25 + A*M )

Multiply both sides by 100:

125 =1.25 + A*M.

So,

A*M=125 -1.25=123.75.

So,

M=123.75 / A.

A is 1.266025641.

So M=123.75 /1.266025641.

Let me compute 123.75 ÷1.266025641.

Using calculator steps:

1.266025641 ×97 = ?

1.266025641 ×90=114.092259 (because 1.266025641 *90=114.092259).

1.266025641 ×7=8.86217847.

So 97 → 114.092259 +8.86217847=122.954437.

The target is 123.75, so 123.75 -122.954437=0.795563.

Now, 0.795563 ÷1.266025641 ≈0.628.

So M=97 +0.628=97.628, approximately 97.63.

So M≈97.63 g/mol.

Looking back at the options, option I is 96.9, option J is 98. So 97.6 is between 96.9 and 98. But none of the options exactly match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps the solution is 100g, but in reality, the weight percent is 1.25%, so 1.25g solute and 98.75g solvent. Wait, but maybe the solution isn't 100g. Wait, but the way I set up the problem, I assumed 100g, but maybe I should think in terms of mass fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for boiling point elevation. Because the problem also gives the boiling point as 80.25°C, which is an increase of 0.25°C over pure benzene's 80.00°C. So boiling point elevation ΔT is 0.25°C.

The formula for boiling point elevation is ΔT = (M_solvent * w_solute * 1000) / (M_solute * w_solvent), but I might have the exact formula wrong. Alternatively, it's ΔT = K_b * m, where m is molality.

Molality m = (moles of solute) / kg of solvent.

So moles of solute is (1.25/100) * (1000/ M_solute) → Wait, perhaps better to think:

In 100g solution, 1.25g solute, 98.75g solvent.

Moles of solute =1.25 / M.

Molality m = (1.25/M) / (98.75/1000) ) → because kg of solvent is 98.75g =0.09875 kg.

So m= (1.25/M) / 0.09875 = (1.25)/(0.09875 M) = (12.690)/(M).

Boiling point elevation ΔT = K_b * m.

We know ΔT is 0.25°C.

So 0.25 = K_b * (12.690 / M).

But wait, what's K_b for benzene? I might need to find that.

Alternatively, from the vapor pressure data, I can calculate the heat of vaporization.

Wait, perhaps the second part (b) is about heat of vaporization. Let's think about that.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the vapor pressure and temperature. The equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

But wait, P1 is pure benzene's vapor pressure at T1, which is 760 mm Hg at 80°C (T1=353.15 K). The solution's vapor pressure at 80.25°C is 752.4 mm Hg. Wait, but wait, no—because the solution boils at 80.25°C, so at that temperature, the vapor pressure would be 760 mm Hg (atmospheric pressure). Or wait, perhaps the data given is the vapor pressure at 80°C, not at the boiling point. Hmm, the question says "at 80°C an unknown solute dissolves in benzene to form a solution... The vapor pressure of the solution is 752.4 mm Hg and its boiling point is 80.25°C."

Wait, so the solution's vapor pressure at 80°C is 752.4 mm Hg, and it boils at 80.25°C, where the vapor pressure would be 760 mm Hg, same as atmospheric pressure.

So perhaps for
