Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about psychoanalytic theory and anxiety. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll take it step by step. 

The question is asking what psychoanalytic theory states causes anxiety to arise from. The options are A, B, and C. Let me think about each option and see which one aligns with what I remember about psychoanalytic concepts.

Option A says anxiety arises from incongruence between a stranger and the memory of the mother. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think this relates to something about strangers and how infants or young children perceive them differently from their primary caregivers. Maybe it's about the "stranger anxiety" concept, where a child feels anxious around people they don't recognize compared to their mother. I remember something about the mother being the primary figure, so when a stranger doesn't match that memory, it causes anxiety. So this might be related to the psychoanalytic idea of the mother-image and how differences from that cause stress.

Option B states it's a failure of defenses to modulate excitation adequately. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I know that in psychoanalytic theory, defense mechanisms are ways the ego deals with stress. If the defenses can't handle the stimuli or stressors, maybe that leads to anxiety. Like, if you can't cope, your anxiety increases. So this could be another possible answer. I'm not entirely sure if it's the primary cause according to theory, though.

Option C is about a failure to dissolve a symbiotic attachment. Symbiotic relationships, especially in early development, refer to the close bond between child and mother. If the child can't break this attachment, maybe that leads to anxiety. But wait, symbiotic relationships are more about not developing independence. I'm not sure if that's directly linked to anxiety arising in the theory. It might relate more to issues like separation anxiety, but I'm not certain if this is the cause as per the question.

Now, trying to recall specific theories. I remember that in psychoanalytic thought, anxiety is often related to the ego's inability to cope with stress. This could tie into option B, where the defense mechanisms aren't working well. But wait, another angle: the Oedipus complex and the structures of the psyche. The id, ego, and superego—when they conflict, that's supposed to cause anxiety. For example, the ego experiencing conflict between the id and superego leads to anxiety as a signal of danger.

Alternatively, I've heard about stranger anxiety in developmental psychology, which is when infants around 6-9 months start showing fear of strangers. This is explained as the child comparing the stranger to their primary caregiver (like the mother) and feeling anxiety because the stranger doesn't match, leading to distress. So that would align with option A.

Wait, but the question is about psychoanalytic theory specifically. So which theory aligns with that? Stranger anxiety is more of a developmental milestone, perhaps explained by attachment theory or cognitive development. But does psychoanalytic theory address this?

Alternatively, another thought: Melanie Klein's work on the paranoid-schizoid position might relate to anxiety arising from internal conflicts, but I'm not sure if that's what the options are referring to.

Let me think again about the options. Option B says failure of defenses to modulate excitation. Modulating excitation might refer to managing stimuli or stress. If the ego can't do that, anxiety arises. That sounds plausible. Freud talked about anxiety being a result of the ego's inability to handle the demands placed upon it, leading to feelings of overwhelm and anxiety.

So, putting it together: if the defense mechanisms (which are part of the ego) fail to modulate (manage) the excitation (stimuli or stressors), then anxiety occurs. That fits with Freud's view of anxiety as a signal of the ego's distress when it can't cope.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think in some theories, anxiety arises when the ego is under threat, which could be from internal conflicts or external stressors. So if the defenses aren't working, the ego can't mediate these, leading to anxiety.

So between options A and B, which is more accurate? The question is about psychoanalytic theory, so I need to think about which option aligns with that framework.

Option A seems more about a specific situation (comparing strangers to the mother), which might be part of a developmental theory. Option B is more about the ego's functioning, which is central to psychoanalysis.

So I'm leaning towards option B being the correct answer because it relates to the ego's defenses failing, which is a key concept in psychoanalytic theory for the origin of anxiety.

The question asks about the origin of anxiety according to psychoanalytic theory. Let’s analyze the options:

- **Option A** suggests anxiety arises from incongruence between a stranger and the memory of the mother. This idea relates to "stranger anxiety," where a child feels distress when encountering someone unfamiliar compared to their primary caregiver. While this concept is relevant to developmental psychology, it is not specifically tied to psychoanalytic theory.

- **Option B** states that anxiety arises from a failure of defenses to modulate excitation adequately. This aligns with psychoanalytic theory, particularly Freud's ideas about the ego's role in managing stress and stimuli. When the ego's defense mechanisms fail to cope with internal or external demands, anxiety emerges as a signal of distress.

- **Option C** mentions a failure to dissolve a symbiotic attachment. While symbiotic relationships are part of early development, this concept is more related to issues like separation anxiety rather than being a direct cause of anxiety in psychoanalytic theory.

Given the focus on psychoanalytic theory, **Option B** is the most accurate. It reflects the idea that anxiety stems from the ego's inability to manage stress effectively, which is central to Freud's framework.
