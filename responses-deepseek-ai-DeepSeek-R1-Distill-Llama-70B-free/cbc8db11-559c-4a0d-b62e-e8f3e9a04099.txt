Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find v(0^+) and the derivative (dv/dt) at t=0 from the right, given the Laplace transform V(s). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Laplace transforms, but I'll try to think it through.

The given V(s) is [(-36s² -24s +2)] / [12s³ +17s² +6s]. I remember that to find v(0^+), I can use the initial value theorem. Oh right, the theorem says that the limit as s approaches infinity of s times V(s) gives v(0^+). So I'll apply that.

Let me compute sV(s) as s approaches infinity. The numerator becomes (-36s² -24s +2) multiplied by s, so that's -36s³ -24s² + 2s. The denominator is 12s³ +17s² +6s. As s gets really big, the dominant terms will be the highest powers of s. So the leading term in the numerator is -36s³ and in the denominator 12s³.

So sV(s) tends to (-36s³)/(12s³) = -36/12 = -3. So v(0^+) should be -3. That narrows down the options to C, E, G, I, because their v(0^+) is -3.

Now for the derivative (dv/dt) at t=0^+. I think the derivative can be found using the inverse Laplace transform and then taking the derivative. Alternatively, maybe using another property. Wait, I remember that the derivative of v(t) is L^{-1} {s V(s) - v(0)}. But since we're evaluating at t=0^+, maybe I can find the limit using the Laplace transform.

Wait, there's another approach. Since we have the Laplace transform, maybe I can find the initial derivative by evaluating the limit as s approaches infinity of [s² V(s) - s v(0^+)]. Or wait, let me think again.

The Laplace transform of dv/dt is s V(s) - v(0). So if I can find the inverse Laplace of s V(s) - v(0), that would give me dv/dt. But evaluating the initial value of dv/dt would require taking the limit as s approaches infinity of s times [s V(s) - v(0)].

Wait, that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the inverse Laplace transform of V(s), which would give me v(t), then take its derivative and plug in t=0.

But finding the inverse Laplace might not be straightforward because the denominator looks like a cubic. Maybe I should factor the denominator first to simplify.

Let me factor the denominator 12s³ +17s² +6s. Factor out an s first: s(12s² +17s +6). Now factor the quadratic. Let me compute the discriminant: 17² -4*12*6 = 289 - 288 =1. So roots are [-17 ±1]/(2*12). So s=(-17+1)/24 = (-16)/24 = -2/3, and s=(-17-1)/24 = -18/24 = -3/4.

So the denominator factors as s (s + 2/3)(s + 3/4). So the denominator is s*(s + 2/3)*(s + 3/4). Okay, that's helpful.

Now the numerator is -36s² -24s +2. Let me see if I can express V(s) as partial fractions.

Let me write V(s) as:

V(s) = [ -36s² -24s +2 ] / [ s (s + 2/3)(s + 3/4) ]

We can represent this as A/s + B/(s + 2/3) + C/(s + 3/4).

So:

-36s² -24s +2 = A (s + 2/3)(s + 3/4) + B s (s + 3/4) + C s (s + 2/3)

Let me expand each term on the right.

First term: A (s^2 + (2/3 +3/4)s + (2/3)(3/4)) 

Wait, let me compute (2/3 + 3/4). Common denominator is 12: 8/12 +9/12 =17/12. And (2/3)(3/4)=6/12=1/2.

So first term is A (s² + (17/12)s + 1/2 )

Second term: B s (s +3/4) = B (s^2 + (3/4)s )

Third term: C s (s +2/3) = C (s² + (2/3)s )

So combining all terms:

Left side: -36s² -24s +2

Right side:

A s² + (17A/12) s + A*(1/2) 

+ B s² + (3B/4) s 

+ C s² + (2C/3) s 

Combine like terms:

s² terms: A + B + C

s terms: (17A/12) + (3B/4) + (2C/3)

constant term: A*(1/2)

So setting coefficients equal:

For s²: A + B + C = -36

For s: (17A/12) + (3B/4) + (2C/3) = -24

For constant term: A/2 = 2 → A =4.

Wait, from the constant term: A*(1/2) =2 → A=4.

So A is 4. Now substitute back into the other equations.

From s² equation: 4 + B + C = -36 → B + C = -40.

From s equation: (17*4)/12 + (3B/4) + (2C/3) = -24.

Calculating (17*4)/12 = 68/12 = 17/3 ≈5.6667.

So equation becomes: 17/3 + (3B/4) + (2C/3) = -24.

Multiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:

12*(17/3) + 12*(3B/4) + 12*(2C/3) )= 12*(-24)

Which is:

4*17 + 9B + 8C = -288

68 +9B +8C = -288 → 9B +8C = -356.

Now, we have:

B + C = -40 → equation (1)

9B +8C = -356 → equation (2).

Let me solve equation (1) for B: B = -40 - C.

Substitute into equation (2):

9*(-40 - C) +8C = -356

-360 -9C +8C = -356 → -360 -C = -356 → -C=4 → C= -4.

Then B= -40 - (-4) = -36.

So A=4, B= -36, C= -4.

So V(s) can be written as:

4/s + (-36)/(s + 2/3) + (-4)/(s + 3/4)

Which is:

4/s -36/(s + 2/3) -4/(s +3/4)

Now, taking inverse Laplace:

v(t) = 4 L^{-1} {1/s} -36 L^{-1} {1/(s + 2/3)} } -4 L^{-1} {1/(s +3/4)} }

Which is:

4 * 1 -36 e^(-2/3 t) -4 e^(-3/4 t)

So v(t) =4 -36 e^(-2t/3) -4 e^(-3t/4)

Now, to find dv/dt, take derivative of v(t):

dv/dt = 0 -36 * (-2/3) e^(-2t/3) -4 * (-3/4) e^(-3t/4)

Simplify:

dv/dt = 24 e^(-2t/3) + 3 e^(-3t/4)

At t=0^+:

dv/dt(0^+) = 24 *1 + 3 *1 =27.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 27. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, wait a second. Let me check the calculations again. The inverse Laplace might have signs wrong because the original V(s) had negative terms.

Wait, no. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the partial fractions, I had:

V(s) = 4/s -36/(s + 2/3) -4/(s +3/4)

Which when taking inverse Laplace gives:

4 * u(t) -36 e^(-2/3 t) u(t) -4 e^(-3/4 t) u(t)

So v(t) =4 -36 e^(-2t/3) -4 e^(-3t/4)

Then dv/dt is:

dv/dt = [0] -36*(-2/3) e^(-2t/3) -4*(-3/4) e^(-3t/4)

Which is:

(36*(2/3)) e^(-2t/3) + (4*(3/4)) e^(-3t/4)

So 24 e^(-2t/3) +3 e^(-3t/4)

At t=0, the exponentials are 1, so 24 +3=27.

But looking at the options, none of the options have (dv/dt) at 0 as 27. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the partial fractions.

Wait, the original V(s) numerator is (-36s² -24s +2), and denominator 12s^3 +17s² +6s.

I factored the denominator as s(s + 2/3)(s + 3/4). That part seems correct.

Then I set up the partial fractions as A/s + B/(s + 2/3) + C/(s +3/4).

So the equation is:

-36s² -24s +2 = A (s +2/3)(s +3/4) + B s (s +3/4) + C s (s +2/3)

I expanded each term:

A(s² + (17/12)s + 1/2) + B(s² + 3s/4) + C(s² + 2s/3)

Combining terms:

s²: A + B + C = -36.

s terms: (17A/12) + (3B/4) + (2C/3) = -24.

Constant term: A*(1/2) =2 → A=4.

That seems right.

Then B + C= -40.

In the s terms equation, I substituted A=4.

(17*4)/12 = 68/12 =17/3 ≈5.6667.

So equation: 17/3 + (3B/4) + (2C/3) = -24.

Multiply by 12:

68 +9B +8C = -288 → 9B +8C = -356.

With B + C =-40 → B = -40 - C.

Substituting into 9*(-40 -C) +8C = -356.

-360 -9C +8C =-356 →-360 -C =-356 → -C=4 → C=-4.

Thus, B= -40 - (-4) =-36.

So partial fractions are correct.

So inverse Laplace is correct, giving v(t)=4 -36 e^(-2t/3) -4 e^(-3t/4).

So derivative is 24 e^(-2t/3) +3 e^(-3t/4).

At t=0, that's 24 +3=27. But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial value theorem calculation?

Wait, earlier I found v(0^+) =-3, which is correct as per the initial value theorem. But in the options, the ones with v(0^+) =-3 are C, E, G, I. Let me look at those options:

Option C: dv/dt=4.25 → 17/4=4.25.

Option E: dv/dt=1.25.

Option G:0.75.

Option I:2.25.

Wait, I got 27, which isn't any of these. So I must have made an error in the process.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the inverse Laplace is correct, but I made a mistake in taking the derivative.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-examine the inverse Laplace. Wait, the original V(s) is in the form [numerator]/[denominator], and when I did the partial fractions, I got A=4, B=-36, C=-4. So v(t)=4 -36 e^{-2t/3} -4 e^{-3t/4}.

Wait, but when I take the derivative, is it correct? Let me compute it again.

dv/dt = d/dt [4] →0

d/dt [ -36 e^{-2t/3} ] → -36 * (-2/3) e^{-2t/3} → 24 e^{-2t/3}

d/dt [ -4 e^{-3t/4} ] → -4 * (-3/4) e^{-3t/4} →3 e^{-3t/4}

So total dv/dt=24 e^{-2t/3} +3 e^{-3t/4}

At t=0, that gives 24 +3=27 as before.

But the options don't have 27. So perhaps I messed up the initial setup.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the partial fractions. Let me double-check the equation setup.

The original equation after expansion was:

-36s² -24s +2 = A(s² +17/12 s +1/2) + B(s² +3s/4) + C(s² +2s/3)

Wait, perhaps when I plug in s=0 to find the constant term, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: plug in s=0 into the equation.

Left side: -36*(0)^2 -24*(0) +2=2.

Right side: A*(0 + 2/3)(0+3/4) + B*0*(0+3/4) + C*0*(0+2/3).

So right side is A*(2/3)(3/4) = A*(6/12)=A*(1/2).

So 2 = A*(1/2) → A=4. Correct.

Similarly, let me plug in s= -2/3 to find B.

s= -2/3:

Left side: -36*(4/9) -24*(-2/3) +2 → -16 +16 +2=2.

Right side: A=4, but s=-2/3 is a root, so denominator terms for B and C would have factors that might zero out.

Wait, when s=-2/3, the term B is multiplied by s, which is -2/3, and (s+3/4)= (-2/3+3/4)= (-8/12 +9/12)=1/12. So the B term is B*(-2/3)(1/12).

Similarly, the C term is C*(-2/3)(0) because (s +2/3)=0 when s=-2/3.

So right side when s=-2/3 is:

A*(s+2/3)(s+3/4) → A*(0)(...) → 0

B term: B*(-2/3)(-2/3 +3/4) → B*(-2/3)(1/12) → B*(-2/3)(1/12)= B*(-1/18)

C term: C* (-2/3)(0) → 0.

So equation becomes:

2 = 0 + B*(-1/18) +0 → B= 2*(-18)= -36. Which matches our earlier result.

Similarly, let me check s= -3/4.

s= -3/4:

Left side: -36*(9/16) -24*(-3/4) +2 → -36*(9/16)= - (324/16)= -20.25; -24*(-3/4)=18 → -20.25 +18 +2= -0.25.

Right side:

A term: A*(s+2/3)(s+3/4) → A*( (-3/4 +2/3) ) *0 →0.

B term: B*s*(s+3/4) → B*(-3/4)(0) →0.

C term: C*s*(s+2/3) → C*(-3/4)( (-3/4 +2/3 )) → compute (-3/4 +2/3)= (-9/12 +8/12)= -1/12.

So C term: C*(-3/4)*(-1/12) = C*(3/(4*12))= C*(1/16).

So equation: -0.25 = 0 +0 + C*(1/16) → C= (-0.25)*16= -4. Which matches earlier result.

So partial fractions are correct.

Wait, but then the derivative is 27, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the derivative.

Wait, no, the derivative as t approaches 0 from the right is 27, but the options don't have 27. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check using another method. Like using the derivative of the Laplace transform.

The Laplace transform of dv/dt is s V(s) - v(0). So to get dv/dt at t=0, perhaps I can compute the limit as s approaches infinity of s [s V(s) - v(0)].

Wait, let me think. The initial value of the derivative would be the limit as t approaches 0 from the right of dv/dt(t). Which is the same as the limit as s approaches infinity of s times the Laplace transform of dv/dt(t).

The Laplace transform of dv/dt is s V(s) - v(0). So the Laplace of dv/dt is (s V(s) -
