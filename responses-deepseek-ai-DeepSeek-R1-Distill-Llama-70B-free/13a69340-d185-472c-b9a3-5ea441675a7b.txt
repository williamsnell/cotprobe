Okay, so I need to figure out which conflict Delia is facing. She got accepted into both Harvard and Yale, and now she's having trouble deciding. Hmm, let me think about the types of conflicts.

Wait, the question is about psychological conflicts, right? Like the different types that were discussed in the textbook. Let me recall. There are several types like approach-approach, approach-avoidance, and avoidance-avoidance.

Approach-approach is when you have to choose between two positive options. Both Harvard and Yale are great schools, so choosing between them would fit here. But wait, what's the other one? Oh right, approach-avoidance is when you're torn between something you want but has downsides, like taking a job you like but with low pay. That doesn't seem to apply here.

Wait, no, in this case, both options are positive. So Delia is probably facing an approach-approach conflict because she wants both but can only pick one. But wait, another thoughtâ€”sometimes in these situations, each option might have its own pros and cons, but the overall choice is between two appealing things.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of conflict. Let me think again. Cognitive dissonance is when you hold conflicting beliefs, but that's more after a decision. Intrinsic-extrinsic is about motivation sources, not really a conflict in decision-making. Reward-punishment is about choosing between a reward and a punishment, but here both are rewards. Frustration-aggression is about reacting to being blocked, which doesn't fit. Internal-external... maybe, but that's more about locus of control.

So going back, approach-approach is definitely when you have two desirable options, right? So Delia is choosing between two good choices, so that's an approach-approach conflict. Looking at the options, the choices are labeled as F: approach-avoidance and G: approach-approach.

Wait, wait. Another angle: when choosing between two positives, it's approach-approach. But sometimes, each option also has some drawbacks. Like, maybe Harvard is better in her field but Yale has a better location. Or something like that. But in the question, it's just stated that she's accepted into both and is having difficulty. So maybe she's weighing the pros and cons of each, which are both positive, making it approach-approach.

So the answer should be G: approach-approach.

Delia is faced with a choice between two positive options, Harvard and Yale, both of which are desirable. This type of conflict, where an individual must choose between two appealing alternatives, is known as an approach-approach conflict. 

Answer: G
