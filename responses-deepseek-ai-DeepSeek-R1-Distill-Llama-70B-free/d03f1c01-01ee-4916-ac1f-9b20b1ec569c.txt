Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's see what the question is about. The defendant is charged with murder and is offering testimony that he was committing a bank robbery in another state on the day the victim was killed. I need to determine if this testimony is admissible and under which category.

Hmm, the options are about different evidence rules. I remember that alibi evidence is about the defendant being somewhere else at the time of the crime. So this seems like an alibi. But wait, how does that fit into the evidence rules?

Wait, the defendant is offering this testimony. So is he testifying himself, or is someone else? Oh, the question says the defendant offered testimony, so maybe it's his own testimony. But in any case, the content is about his whereabouts during the crime.

I recall that alibi evidence can be presented by the defendant to show they weren't at the scene. But how does that fit into the hearsay rules? Because if someone else is testifying about where the defendant was, that could be hearsay unless it falls under an exception.

Wait, the options include "admissible as a statement of alibi." That's option D. But wait, is alibi a hearsay exception? Or is it more about relevance?

Alternatively, if the defendant is testifying himself, his own statement about his whereabouts wouldn't be hearsay because it's not an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. Wait, no, if he's testifying in court, it's not hearsay at all. But the question is about the admissibility of the testimony, so maybe the issue is whether it's admissible as alibi evidence.

Wait, another angle: when a defendant presents an alibi, they're trying to prove they were elsewhere. But the rules about when and how alibi evidence can be presented vary. For example, if the defendant was aware of the alibi before trial, they might have to notify the prosecution in advance, but that's a procedural issue, not admissibility per se.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Inadmissible as hearsay. If the testimony is the defendant's own, it's not hearsay because it's not an out-of-court statement. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Admissible as character evidence. No, because alibi isn't about character; it's about facts of the event.

Option C: Declaration against interest. That applies when someone makes a statement that's against their own interest, but here the defendant is trying to help himself, so that's probably not it.

Option D: Admissible as a statement of alibi. That seems to fit because it's about the defendant's location.

Option E: Admission. That's when a party opponent makes a statement. The defendant is the party here, so his own statement wouldn't be an admission by the opposing party.

Option F: Existing state of mind. That's more for things like intent or plan, not location.

Option G: Not hearsay. If the defendant is testifying, it's not hearsay, but even if it's another witness, alibi evidence can be admissible if it's not hearsay.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the testimony. If the defendant is testifying about his own alibi, then it's his own testimony and not hearsay. But if someone else is testifying about what the defendant told them, that could be hearsay unless it's for a purpose other than the truth.

Wait, but the question states that the defendant is offering the testimony. So perhaps it's his own testimony, making it non-hearsay. So option G says "admissible as not hearsay." But option D is about alibi.

Wait, maybe the question is about whether the statement is hearsay. If the defendant is testifying, then it's not hearsay. But if someone else is testifying about the defendant's statement, that might be hearsay. But the question says the defendant offered the testimony, so perhaps it's the defendant testifying himself.

So in that case, the testimony is admissible as it's not hearsay (option G), but also as alibi (option D). Which one is correct?

Wait, looking back, the options are about the reason for admissibility. So if the testimony is about the alibi, it's being offered to prove that he was elsewhere, which is a fact. So it's admissible as alibi evidence. But is that a specific rule?

I think alibi evidence is admissible as substantive evidence if it's relevant. But in terms of evidence rules, I don't recall a specific exception called "statement of alibi." The closest I can think of is that alibi is a defense that can be presented through testimony, which is not hearsay when the defendant testifies.

Alternatively, if the testimony is the defendant's own, it's non-hearsay. So option G says "admissible as not hearsay." But option D is more about the purpose, not the hearsay rule.

Wait, the options are about what the testimony is. So option D is "statement of alibi," which is a type of evidence, not necessarily a hearsay exception.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The defendant's testimony that he was elsewhere is an alibi. So the testimony is admissible as alibi evidence. Therefore, the correct option would be D.

Alternatively, if someone else is testifying about the defendant's alibi, like a witness saying the defendant was with them, that's not hearsay because it's about their own perception. But in this case, the defendant is offering the testimony, so it's about his own statement.

Wait, but the question says the testimony is about him committing a bank robbery elsewhere. So he's testifying that he was committing a crime in another state at the time of the murder. That's a pretty serious statement. But as a defense, it's about his alibi.

So the testimony is being offered to prove he wasn't at the murder scene, hence an alibi. So the testimony is admissible as a statement of alibi. So option D would be correct.

Alternatively, option G says it's not hearsay, which is also true if the defendant is testifying. But the question is about what the testimony is classified as. So the testimony is an alibi, making D the right answer.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the defendant's testimony that he was committing a bank robbery in another state at the time of the murder. This testimony is being offered as part of his defense to establish an alibi. The key issue is determining the correct classification of this testimony under the rules of evidence.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. If the defendant is testifying himself, his statement is not hearsay because it is not an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The testimony is not about the defendant's character but rather about his whereabouts at the time of the crime.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A declaration against interest applies to statements made by someone else that are against their own interest, which is not relevant here.  
- **Option D**: Correct. The testimony is admissible as a statement of alibi, as it is being offered to prove that the defendant was elsewhere at the time of the crime.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. An admission refers to a statement made by a party opponent, which does not apply to the defendant's own testimony.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. This option pertains to statements about a person's existing state of mind, which is unrelated to the defendant's location.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the defendant's testimony is not hearsay, the question asks for the classification of the testimony, not whether it is hearsay.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. A self-incriminating statement is not the relevant classification here.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The testimony is a statement of fact, not an opinion.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The testimony is highly relevant as it pertains to the defendant's alibi.

The testimony is best classified as a statement of alibi, as it is being offered to prove that the defendant was not present at the crime scene. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D**
