Okay, so I've got this physics question here about sound waves. Hmm, let me think. The question says that a sound wave with frequency f travels through air at speed v. Then it asks, what speed will a sound wave with frequency 4f travel through the air? The options are A to J.

Wait, I remember that the speed of sound in a medium like air depends on the properties of the medium, right? Like temperature and things like that. Oh right, the speed of sound in air is constant at a given temperature. So if the temperature doesn't change, the speed shouldn't change either.

But wait, is the speed of sound dependent on the frequency of the wave? I think I've read that in an ideal situation, the speed of sound in air doesn't depend on frequency, assuming it's in the audible range. So higher frequency just means more waves pass by per second, but each wave's speed remains the same.

So in this case, if the first wave has frequency f and speed v, then a wave with 4f would still have the same speed v because the medium hasn't changed. So the answer should be H: v.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula for wave speed is v = 位f, where 位 is wavelength and f is frequency. If the speed v is constant, then if frequency increases, the wavelength must decrease proportionally. So for 4f, 位 becomes 位/4, keeping v the same.

Yes, that makes sense. So the speed doesn't change, it's still v.

The speed of sound in air depends on the properties of the medium, such as temperature, and is independent of the frequency of the sound wave. When the frequency increases, the wavelength decreases proportionally to maintain a constant wave speed. Therefore, a sound wave with frequency 4f will travel through the air at the same speed v.

Answer: H
