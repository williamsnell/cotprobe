Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying the strongest base in liquid ammonia. The options are A through J, each representing different nitrogen-containing ions or molecules.

I remember that in liquid ammonia, the solvent is NH3, similar to how water is the solvent in aqueous solutions. In water, we know that the strongest base would be something like OH- because it's the conjugate base of water. So maybe in ammonia, the strongest base would be the conjugate base of ammonia.

Wait, what's the autoionization of ammonia like? I think it's something like NH3 + NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + NH2-. Oh right, so in liquid NH3, the solvent can autoionize into ammonium ions (NH4+) and amide ions (NH2-). So the amide ion, NH2-, is the strongest base because it's the conjugate base of the solvent.

Looking at the options, option A is NH2-, so that's probably the answer. But wait, let me make sure. The question asks for the strongest base. In any solvent, the strongest base is the conjugate base of the solvent. Because in water, OH- is stronger than any other base that's not the conjugate base of water. Similarly, in ammonia, NH2- should be the strongest base.

Other options: Option B is NH3, which is the solvent itself. In water, H2O isn't a strong base. Similarly, NH3 wouldn't be the strongest base in its own solvent. 

Looking at the other ions, like options C, F, G, etc., they are either positive ions or other species. Bases are usually the ones that can accept protons, so the negative ions are more likely to be strong bases. So NH2- is a strong base because it's already a negatively charged ion, ready to accept a proton (though in this case, since it's in NH3, it's more about whether it can donate electrons or take protons—I might have that backwards. Wait, bases in the Bronsted sense accept protons. So in NH3 as a solvent, the base would deprotonate something. Or wait, perhaps the solvent's conjugate base is the strongest base available.

So in this case, the amide ion (NH2-) is a stronger base than NH3 itself because NH3 is a weaker base. So in liquid ammonia, adding a substance that can donate a proton would lead to the formation of NH4+ and the substance's conjugate base. But the strongest base in the solvent would be the one that's most likely to exist in the solution, which is the conjugate base of the solvent.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident that the answer is A: NH2-.

The strongest base in liquid ammonia is determined by considering the autoionization of ammonia: 

\[
\text{NH}_3 + \text{NH}_3 \rightleftharpoons \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{NH}_2^-
\]

In this process, the amide ion (\(\text{NH}_2^-\)) is the conjugate base of ammonia and represents the strongest base in liquid ammonia. This is analogous to how \(\text{OH}^-\) is the strongest base in water. Among the given options, \(\text{NH}_2^-\) corresponds to option A. 

Other options, such as \(\text{NH}_3\) (option B), are the solvent itself and not the strongest base. Positive ions like \(\text{NH}_4^+\) (option F) or other species are not relevant as bases in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
