Question:

On March 1, a homeowner hired a landscaper to landscape his front yard. On March 25, as the landscaper was almost finished with the work on the front yard, the homeowner said to the landscaper, "I'm very pleased with your work to date. If you are willing, I would like you to landscape my backyard, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 1. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. " The landscaper replied, "Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. " They shook hands. What is the probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard?

Options:

A: The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.
B: The landscaper's promise constituted a breach of the original contract.
C: The landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract.
D: The landscaper's promise was enforceable only if the homeowner made a down payment.
E: The landscaper's promise was enforceable only if the work was completed by the agreed deadline.
F: The landscaper's promise was void, as it was made under duress.
G: The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.
H: The landscaper's promise resulted in a quasi-contract.
I: The landscaper's promise was voidable, since it was not in writing.
J: The landscaper's promise was unenforceable due to lack of consideration.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The scenario is that a homeowner hired a landscaper on March 1 to do the front yard. Then, on March 25, when the landscaper is almost done with the front yard, the homeowner approaches him. The homeowner says he's really happy with the work so far and wants the landscaper to do the backyard too under the same terms as the existing contract, with the work to be completed by May 1. He'll pay $10,000 at that time. The landscaper agrees and they shake hands.

The question is about the legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard. The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different legal outcome.

I remember that contracts require certain elements: offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be bound. So I need to analyze each element here.

First, the original contract was for the front yard. Now, the homeowner is asking for additional work on the backyard. So this is a new agreement, not part of the original contract.

The homeowner made a proposal: "If you are willing, I would like you to landscape my backyard, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 1. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time."

So the homeowner is making an offer. The offer is to do the backyard under the same terms, so the terms are clear from the existing contract. The consideration here would be the $10,000 payment upon completion.

The landscaper replied, "Agreed. Let's shake hands on it." They shook hands, so that's the acceptance.

Now, this looks like an offer and acceptance, so it's a bilateral contract because both parties are making promises. The homeowner is promising to pay $10,000 upon completion, and the landscaper is promising to perform the work by May 1.

Wait, but in contract law, for a contract to be enforceable, each party's promise must be supported by consideration. Here, the consideration is the $10,000 from the homeowner in exchange for the landscaper's work. So each promise is supported by something of value.

Also, both parties are making a promise. The homeowner is promising payment, and the landscaper is promising to do the work. So this is a bilateral contract, which is enforceable because there's offer, acceptance, and consideration on both sides.

So looking at the options:

Option A says it's an enforceable bilateral contract. That seems to fit because both parties are exchanging promises.

Option C says it's a unilateral contract. Unilateral contracts are where only one party makes a promise, and the other party accepts by performing. But here, both are making promises, so it's bilateral, not unilateral.

Option J says it's unenforceable due to lack of consideration. But here, each party is giving something, so that's not right.

Option G claims it's illusory, but the landscaper is making a definite promise to do the work by a certain date, so it's not illusory.

Option D and E talk about conditions like down payments or deadlines. The contract is enforceable upon agreement, so those don't affect the basic enforceability.

Option B is about breach of contract, but the original contract is about the front yard, and this is a new agreement, so no breach.

Option I says it's voidable without writing, but unless it's a contract that's required to be in writing under the statute of frauds, it's fine. Landscaping a backyard might not fall under that, unless it's for a certain amount or duration, but the question doesn't specify, so it's probably not applicable.

So the correct answer should be A: enforceable bilateral contract.

The legal effect of the landscaper's promise to landscape the backyard is the creation of an enforceable bilateral contract. The elements of a valid contract—offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent—are present. The homeowner made a clear offer to hire the landscaper for the backyard under the same terms as the original contract, with a promise to pay $10,000 upon completion by May 1. The landscaper accepted this offer by agreeing and shaking hands, demonstrating mutual intent to be bound. The consideration is the $10,000 payment from the homeowner in exchange for the landscaper's promise to perform the work. Since both parties exchanged promises, this is a bilateral contract, not a unilateral one. There is no indication of any issues like lack of consideration, duress, or illusory promises that would invalidate the contract. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A: The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.
