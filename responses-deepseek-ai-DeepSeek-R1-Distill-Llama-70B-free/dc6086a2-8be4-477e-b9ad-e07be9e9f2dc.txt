Okay, so I have this gas problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question says that 500 liters of a gas at 27°C and 700 torr would occupy what volume at STP? Hmm, I remember that STP stands for standard temperature and pressure, right? So standard temperature is 0°C, which is 273 Kelvin, and standard pressure is 1 atm, which is 760 torr. 

Wait, so the problem is about changing the conditions of the gas from 27°C and 700 torr to STP. I think I need to use the combined gas law here. The formula I remember is (P1 * V1) / T1 = (P2 * V2) / T2. Oh right, because pressure and volume are inversely related when temperature changes, so when one goes up, the other goes down if the other variables change accordingly.

Let me note down the given values. The initial volume V1 is 500 liters. The initial pressure P1 is 700 torr. The initial temperature T1 is 27°C. I should convert that to Kelvin because gas laws require absolute temperature. So 27°C plus 273 is 300 K, right?

At STP, the pressure P2 is 760 torr and the temperature T2 is 273 K. We need to find V2.

So plugging into the formula: (700 torr * 500 L) / 300 K = (760 torr * V2) / 273 K.

Wait, let me rearrange this to solve for V2. So V2 = (700 * 500 * 273) / (300 * 760). Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: 700 * 500 = 350,000. Then multiply by 273: 350,000 * 273. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see, 350,000 * 200 is 70,000,000, and 350,000 *73 is... 350,000 *70 is 24,500,000 and 350,000 *3 is 1,050,000. So 24.5M +1.05M =25.55M. Adding to the 70M gives 95,550,000.

Wait no, wait. Wait 350,000 * 273: perhaps an easier way is to compute 350,000 * 273 = 350,000 * (200 +70 +3) = 350,000*200=70,000,000; 350,000*70=24,500,000; 350,000*3=1,050,000. So adding those: 70,000,000 +24,500,000 is 94,500,000. Plus 1,050,000 is 95,550,000.

Denominator is 300 *760. Let's compute that. 300 *700=210,000; 300*60=18,000. So 210,000 +18,000 =228,000.

So V2 = 95,550,000 / 228,000. Let me compute that division.

Hmm, perhaps simplify the numbers. Let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by 1000. 95,550,000 ÷1000 is 95,550. 228,000 ÷1000 is 228.

So now it's 95,550 / 228. Let me see. Let's divide both by 3. 95550 ÷3 is 31,850. 228 ÷3 is 76. So now it's 31,850 /76.

Hmm, let me compute 76 times 418. Let's see: 76 *400=30,400. 76*18=1,368. So 30,400 +1,368=31,768. Oh wait, but 31,850 is a bit more than that. 31,850 -31,768=82. So 418 plus (82/76) which is 1 with a remainder of 6. So that's 419 and 6/76, which is approximately 419.079.

So V2 is approximately 419 liters. Let me check the options. Option E is 419 liters. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the steps again.

Calculating V2 = (700 *500 *273) / (300 *760) = (350000 *273) / (228000).

Yes. So 350000*273=95,550,000. 300*760=228,000.

95,550,000 /228,000. Let me compute 95,550,000 ÷228,000. Let me see how many times 228,000 fits into 95,550,000.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as (95,550,000) / (228,000) = (95550) / (228) [after dividing numerator and denominator by 1000].

95550 ÷ 228. Let's see: 228 * 419. Let me compute 228*400=91,200. 228*19=4,332. So 91,200 +4,332=95,532. Oh wait, 228*419=95,532. But our numerator is 95,550. So 95,550 -95,532=18. So 419 + 18/228 =419 + 1/12.7≈419.078... So approximately 419.08 liters. So that's 419 liters. So option E is correct.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 \cdot V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 \cdot V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Given:
- \( V_1 = 500 \, \text{L} \)
- \( P_1 = 700 \, \text{torr} \)
- \( T_1 = 27^\circ \text{C} = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- \( P_2 = 760 \, \text{torr} \) (STP pressure)
- \( T_2 = 273 \, \text{K} \) (STP temperature)

### Rearranging for \( V_2 \):
\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 \cdot V_1 \cdot T_2}{P_2 \cdot T_1}
\]

### Substituting values:
\[
V_2 = \frac{700 \cdot 500 \cdot 273}{300 \cdot 760}
\]

1. Compute the numerator:  
   \[
   700 \cdot 500 = 350,000 \quad \text{and} \quad 350,000 \cdot 273 = 95,550,000
   \]

2. Compute the denominator:  
   \[
   300 \cdot 760 = 228,000
   \]

3. Divide:  
   \[
   V_2 = \frac{95,550,000}{228,000} \approx 419 \, \text{L}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The volume of the gas at STP is approximately **419 liters**.
