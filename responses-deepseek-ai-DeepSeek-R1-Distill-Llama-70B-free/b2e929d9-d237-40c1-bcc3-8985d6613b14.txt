Okay, so I've got this question about signal processing and filters. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that the input signal is v(t) = I δ(t), which is an impulse function. I remember that δ(t) is the Dirac delta function, which is zero everywhere except at t=0 and has an area of 1.

The filter's transfer function is given as (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / jω. Oh wait, τ is the stretched pulse width, whatever that exactly means. I think it's just a time constant or delay factor here.

So the output of the filter would be the convolution of the input signal with the filter's impulse response. But wait, alternatively, since we're dealing with the frequency domain, maybe it's easier to work in that domain.

I remember that when you have an input signal in the time domain, its Fourier transform gives you the frequency domain representation. So the input here is I δ(t), whose Fourier transform is just I, because the delta function's transform is 1, so multiplied by I gives I.

The transfer function H(ω) is (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω). So to find the output in the frequency domain, I multiply the input Fourier transform by H(ω). So V_o(ω) = I * (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω).

Now, I need to find the inverse Fourier transform of this to get v_o(t). Let's see. Let me recall that the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is the sign function, but wait, 1/(jω) is related to the Hilbert transform. Alternatively, I think the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is i times the unit step function u(t), because integrating 1/(jω) exponentials would relate to the step.

Wait, let's think again. The Fourier transform of u(t) is 1/(jω) + π δ(ω), I think. So maybe the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is u(t) multiplied by some constant. Hmm, perhaps it's (1/2) u(t), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider each term separately. Let's split H(ω) into two parts: (1)/(jω) and e^{-jωτ}/(jω). So the first term is 1/(jω), the second is e^{-jωτ}/(jω).

The inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is i times the sign function, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no, the Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) would be u(t) multiplied by something. Let me think more carefully.

The Fourier transform of u(t) is ∫_{0}^∞ e^{-jωt} dt = [ -e^{-jωt}/(jω) ) ] from 0 to ∞. At t=∞, if ω is positive, e^{-jωt} goes to zero. At t=0, it's -1/(jω). So the Fourier transform is (1/(jω)) ) for ω > 0. But since it's not convergent for ω <0, perhaps it's better to think in terms of distributions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recognize that the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is iπ [δ(ω) + (1/(jω)) ]? Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is the sign function, but I might be getting that wrong.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the function (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω). Let me write this as [1/(jω)] (1 - e^{-jωτ} ). So each part's inverse FT would be the convolution of their inverse FTs.

Wait, no, in the frequency domain, multiplication by (1 - e^{-jωτ}) would correspond to time-shifting and subtracting in the time domain. Let me think about the inverse Fourier transform of (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω).

I think the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is iπ [u(t) + u(-t)]? Or perhaps it's related to the step function. Alternatively, perhaps it's (1/(2)) sgn(t), where sgn(t) is the sign function, which is 1 for t>0, -1 for t<0.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up the transforms. Let me get this straight.

The Fourier transform of the unit step function u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse Fourier transform of (1/(jω)) would be u(t) minus something.

Alternatively, perhaps the inverse Fourier transform of (1/(jω)) is (1/(2j)) (sgn(t)), because the Fourier transform of sgn(t) is (2jω)^{-1}, so inverse would be sgn(t)/2j.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the output in time domain. The input is a delta function, so the output is the filter's impulse response.

Wait, wait, that's a good point. The input is δ(t), so the output is the impulse response of the filter, which is the inverse Fourier transform of H(ω).

So H(ω) = (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω). So the output is v_o(t) = I * h(t), where h(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of H(ω).

So to find h(t), we compute the inverse Fourier transform of (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω).

Let me split this into two terms: (1/(jω)) - (e^{-jωτ}/(jω)).

So the inverse Fourier transform would be the sum of the inverse transforms of each term.

The inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is i π [u(t) + u(-t)]? Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the integral.

The inverse Fourier transform integral is (1/(2π)) ∫_{-∞}^{∞} [ (1 - e^{-jωτ}) / (jω) ) ] e^{jωt} dω.

Let me make substitution. Let me write this as:

(1/(2π)) ∫ [1/(jω)] (1 - e^{-jωτ}) e^{jωt} dω.

Hmm, let's split into two terms:

(1/(2π)) [ ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω - ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jω(t - τ)} dω ].

Each integral is similar. Now, the integral ∫ (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω is known. Let me recall that ∫_{-∞}^{∞} (1/(jω)) e^{jωt} dω = 2π i u(t).

Wait, let me think: the Fourier transform of u(t) is (1/(jω)) + π δ(ω). So the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) would be u(t) multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps each integral here is 2π i times u(t), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think of 1/(jω) as the Fourier transform of (1/(2π)) (1/(jω)) would relate to the time domain function.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of known transforms. Let me recall that the inverse Fourier transform of (1/(jω)) is i π sgn(t), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me look up a standard Fourier transform pair. One pair I remember is:

Fourier transform of the sign function, sgn(t), is (2)/(jω). So the inverse Fourier transform of (1/(jω)) would be (sgn(t))/(2).

So, the inverse Fourier transform of 1/(jω) is (1/2) sgn(t). Hmm, that makes sense because sgn(t) is 1 for t>0, -1 for t<0, and zero at t=0.

So then, each term in the integral would be (1/2) sgn(t) for the first integral and (1/2) sgn(t - τ) for the second, because of the time shift τ.

So putting it together: the inverse Fourier transform of H(ω) is (1/(2)) [ sgn(t) - sgn(t - τ) ].

Wait, because the second term is e^{-jωτ} multiplied by 1/(jω), so its inverse is (1/2) sgn(t - τ).

So overall, h(t) = (1/2)[ sgn(t) - sgn(t - τ) ].

But sgn(t) is the step function, which is 1 for t>0, -1 for t<0. So sgn(t) - sgn(t - τ) would be:

For t < 0: sgn(t) is -1, and sgn(t - τ) is -1 (since t - τ is also less than zero if τ is positive and t is negative). So the difference is (-1) - (-1) = 0.

For 0 < t < τ: sgn(t) is 1, sgn(t - τ) is -1. So 1 - (-1) = 2.

For t > τ: both sgn(t) and sgn(t - τ) are 1. So their difference is zero.

So h(t) is (1/2) * [ 2 u(t) (1 - u(t - τ)) ] ?

Wait, let me re-examine. The function sgn(t) is 1 for t>0, -1 for t<0. So sgn(t) - sgn(t - τ) equals:

When t < 0: (-1) - (-1) = 0.

When 0 ≤ t < τ: (1) - (-1) = 2.

When t ≥ τ: (1) - (1) = 0.

So the difference is a rectangular pulse of height 2, from t=0 to t=τ. So h(t) = (1/2)(2) u(t) [1 - u(t - τ)].

Wait, no, because (1/2) times 2 is 1, so h(t) is 1 multiplied by the rectangular function that's 1 between 0 and τ, and zero otherwise.

So h(t) = u(t) [1 - u(t - τ)] = u(t) - u(t - τ).

Wait, that makes sense. So the impulse response is a rectangular pulse that starts at t=0 and ends at t=τ, with height 1.

So putting it all together, the output v_o(t) is I multiplied by this h(t), because the input was I δ(t).

So v_o(t) = I [ u(t) - u(t - τ) ].

Looking at the options, option H says v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - au)]. Hmm, but in the option, it's written as 'au', which probably is a typo and should be τ. So option H is the correct one.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option H: v_o(t) = I [u(t) - u(t - au)], but in the question, the parameter is τ. So perhaps 'au' is a typo, and it's supposed to be τ. So option H is correct.

The input signal is given as \( v(t) = I\delta(t) \), where \( \delta(t) \) is the Dirac delta function. The filter's transfer function is \( H(\omega) = \frac{1 - e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \), where \( \tau \) is the stretched pulse width. To determine the output of the filter, we note that the output in the time domain is the impulse response of the filter, as the input is a delta function.

The impulse response \( h(t) \) is the inverse Fourier transform of \( H(\omega) \). Splitting \( H(\omega) \) into two terms, \( \frac{1}{j\omega} \) and \( \frac{e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \), the inverse Fourier transform of each term can be computed separately. The inverse Fourier transform of \( \frac{1}{j\omega} \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \text{sgn}(t) \), where \( \text{sgn}(t) \) is the sign function. Similarly, the inverse Fourier transform of \( \frac{e^{-j\omega\tau}}{j\omega} \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \text{sgn}(t - \tau) \).

Thus, the impulse response is:

\[
h(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \text{sgn}(t) - \text{sgn}(t - \tau) \right].
\]

The sign function \( \text{sgn}(t) \) is 1 for \( t > 0 \), -1 for \( t < 0 \), and 0 at \( t = 0 \). Therefore:

- For \( t < 0 \): \( \text{sgn}(t) - \text{sgn}(t - \tau) = -1 - (-1) = 0 \).
- For \( 0 \leq t < \tau \): \( \text{sgn}(t) - \text{sgn}(t - \tau) = 1 - (-1) = 2 \).
- For \( t \geq \tau \): \( \text{sgn}(t) - \text{sgn}(t - \tau) = 1 - 1 = 0 \).

This results in a rectangular pulse of height 1, starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \tau \). Therefore, the impulse response is:

\[
h(t) = u(t) - u(t - \tau),
\]

where \( u(t) \) is the unit step function. Since the input is \( v(t) = I\delta(t) \), the output is:

\[
v_o(t) = I \left[ u(t) - u(t - \tau) \right].
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: \( v_o(t) = I \left[ u(t) - u(t - \tau) \right] \).**

Note: In the option, "au" is likely a typo and should be interpreted as \( \tau \).
