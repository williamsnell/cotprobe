Question:

One of the key areas of debate in the early stages of Developmental Psychology was the so called, Nature vs. Nurture debate. Academics agreed that there was interaction between these two factors but there was wide disagreement concerning the degree of interaction. Which of the following terms, that relate to either genetic or environmentally caused changes, describes the differences in timing of physical changes that are found in children belonging to different cohorts?

Options:

A: Secular trends.
B: Epigenesis.
C: Genotype-environment interaction.
D: Canalization?
E: Critical period.
F: Phenotypic plasticity.
G: Genomic imprinting.
H: Genetic drift.
I: Sensitive period.
J: Genetic correlation.

Okay, so I've got this question about developmental psychology, specifically about the Nature vs. Nurture debate. Hmm, I remember that this debate is about whether human development is influenced more by genetics (nature) or environment (nurture). But the question is about a specific term related to changes in timing of physical changes in children from different cohorts.

Wait, the question says that the term describes differences in the timing of physical changes across different cohorts. Cohorts are groups of people born in the same time period, right? So if we're looking at different cohorts, like children born in the 80s vs 2000s, and seeing how their physical development timing differs, what would that be called?

I'm trying to recall the terms from my notes. Let's go through the options:

A: Secular trends. I think this refers to long-term trends in a population over time, like how the average height has increased over generations. This could relate to changes in cohorts.

B: Epigenesis. That's about how environmental factors affect gene expression without changing the DNA. Not sure how that ties to timing in cohorts.

C: Genotype-environment interaction. This is when the effect of genes depends on the environment. Maybe not directly about timing differences across groups.

D: Canalization. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think it's about how certain traits are more likely to develop in a specific way despite genetic or environmental factors. Not directly about timing trends.

E: Critical period. That refers to a specific time when a certain development must happen, like language acquisition. Not about cohort differences.

F: Phenotypic plasticity. This is the ability of an organism to change its phenotype in response to the environment. Again, not specifically about timing differences across time.

G: Genomic imprinting. This is when the effect of a gene depends on whether it's inherited from the mother or father. Doesn't fit here.

H: Genetic drift. That's a population genetics term about random changes in allele frequencies. Not related to developmental timing.

I: Sensitive period. Similar to critical period, a time when a child is more responsive to certain stimuli. Not about cohort trends.

J: Genetic correlation. When traits are influenced by the same genes. Not directly relevant.

So, the key here is that secular trends refer to changes over time within a population. For example, earlier onset of puberty in each successive generation could be a secular trend. These are changes that are observed as societal or environmental factors change over time, affecting cohorts differently. So the term would be secular trends.

The question focuses on identifying the term that describes differences in the timing of physical changes across children from different cohorts, particularly in the context of the Nature vs. Nurture debate. After analyzing the options:

- **A: Secular trends** refer to long-term changes observed in populations over time, such as shifts in the timing of physical development across different generations. This fits the description of cohort differences in developmental timing.
- The other options (B-J) relate to genetic or environmental interactions but do not specifically address the timing differences across cohorts.

Thus, the correct term is **A: Secular trends**.

Answer: A
