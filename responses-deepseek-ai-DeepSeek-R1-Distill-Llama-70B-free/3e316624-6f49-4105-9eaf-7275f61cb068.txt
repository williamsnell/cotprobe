Question:

A silicious rock contains the mineral ZnS. To analyze for Zn, a sample of the rock is pulverized and treated with HCl to dissolve the ZnS (silicious matter is insoluable). Zinc is precipitated from solution by the addition of potassium ferrocyanide K_4 Fe (CN)_6. After filtering, the precipitate is dried and weighed. The reactions which occur are ZnS + 2HCl \rightarrow ZnCl_2 + H_2 S 2ZnCl_2 + K_4 Fe (CN)_6 \rightarrow Zn_2 Fe (CN)_6 + 4 KCl If a 2 gram sample of rock yields 0.969 gram of Zn_2Fe(CN)_6, what is the percentage of Zn in the sample? Atomic weight Zn = 65.4, molecular weight Zn_2 Fe (CN)_6 = 342.6.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my stoichiometry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about analyzing the percentage of zinc in a rock sample. The rock contains ZnS, which is treated with HCl to dissolve it. Then, zinc is precipitated using potassium ferrocyanide, and the precipitate is weighed. We need to find the percentage of Zn in the original rock sample.

The reactions given are:
1. ZnS + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂S
2. 2ZnCl₂ + K₄Fe(CN)₆ → Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ + 4KCl

The data given is that a 2-gram sample yields 0.969 grams of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆. The atomic weight of Zn is 65.4, and the molecular weight of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ is 342.6.

Hmm, I think I need to find out how much Zn is present in that 0.969 grams of precipitate and then calculate the percentage in the original 2-gram sample.

Let me jot down the steps I think I should take:

1. Calculate the moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ precipitate.
2. Determine how many moles of Zn are in that.
3. Convert moles of Zn to grams.
4. Calculate the percentage of Zn in the 2g sample.

Starting with the first step: moles of the precipitate. The formula weight is given as 342.6 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass.

Moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ = 0.969 g / 342.6 g/mol. Let me compute that.

Let me do 0.969 divided by 342.6. Hmm, 342.6 is about 343. So 0.969 / 343 ≈ 0.002825 moles. Wait, let me check that with a calculator. 0.969 ÷ 342.6. Let's see, 342.6 * 0.0028 is 0.958, which is a bit less than 0.969. So maybe 0.002825? Let me just note that as approximately 0.002825 moles.

Next, from the second reaction, the mole ratio between ZnCl₂ and Zn₂Fe(CN)₆. The reaction is 2 ZnCl₂ → 1 Zn₂Fe(CN)₆. So for every mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆, there are 2 moles of ZnCl₂, meaning 2 moles of Zn²+ ions.

So moles of Zn would be 2 * moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆.

So 0.002825 * 2 = 0.00565 moles of Zn.

Wait, no. Wait, in the reaction, 2 moles of ZnCl₂ produce 1 mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆. So each mole of the precipitate corresponds to 2 moles of Zn²+. So yes, it's 2 times the moles of the precipitate.

So that gives 0.00565 moles of Zn.

Now, convert moles of Zn to grams. Molar mass of Zn is 65.4 g/mol.

Mass of Zn = 0.00565 mol * 65.4 g/mol.

Let me calculate that. 0.00565 * 65.4.

Hmm, 0.005 * 65.4 is 0.327. 0.00065 * 65.4 is approximately 0.04251. So total is about 0.327 + 0.04251 = 0.3695 grams.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 65.4 * 0.00565.

65.4 * 5.65e-3 = ?

Let me compute 65 * 5.65e-3 and 0.4 * 5.65e-3.

65 * 5.65e-3 = 0.36625.

0.4 * 5.65e-3 = 0.00226.

Adding them gives 0.36625 + 0.00226 = 0.36851 grams. So approximately 0.3685 g of Zn.

Now, the original sample was 2 grams of rock. The percentage of Zn is (mass of Zn / mass of sample) * 100%.

So that's (0.3685 g / 2 g) * 100% = 0.18425 * 100 = 18.425%.

Looking at the options, option F is 18% Zn. Option D is 19%, which is close, but let me check if I did the calculations correctly.

Wait, let me go back and recompute the moles precisely.

Moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆: 0.969 g / 342.6 g/mol.

Let me compute that exactly. 0.969 / 342.6.

Let me see: 342.6 = 3426 * 0.1. So 0.969 / 342.6 = (0.969 * 10) / 3426 = 9.69 / 3426.

Wait, 3426 divided by 969 is about 3.535. So 9.69 / 3426 = 0.002827 moles.

Wait, 3426 * 0.002827 is approximately 9.69, so yes.

So moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ is 0.002827.

Moles of Zn²+ is twice that, so 0.005654 moles.

Grams of Zn: 0.005654 * 65.4.

Let me calculate that.

0.005654 * 65.4.

Hmm, 0.005 * 65.4 = 0.327.

0.000654 * 65.4.

Compute 0.0006 *65.4 = 0.03924.

0.000054 *65.4 = 0.0035316.

So total for 0.000654 is 0.03924 +0.0035316 ≈ 0.0427716.

So total grams of Zn is 0.327 + 0.0427716 = 0.3697716 grams.

So 0.3697716 grams in 2 grams of sample.

Percentage is (0.3697716 / 2) * 100 = 18.4883%.

Wait, that's approximately 18.49%, which is about 18.5%. So looking at the options, F is 18%, which is the closest. Then why isn't it 18.5%? Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait another way, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Let me try again.

Molar mass of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ is 342.6 g/mol.

Mass is 0.969 g.

Moles = 0.969 / 342.6 = 0.002827 mol.

Each mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ contains 2 moles of Zn, so 2 * 0.002827 = 0.005654 mol Zn.

Mass of Zn is 0.005654 * 65.4.

Let me compute 0.005654 * 65.4.

Breaking it down: 0.005 * 65.4 = 0.327.

0.000654 * 65.4.

Compute 0.0006 *65.4=0.03924.

0.000054*65.4=0.0035316.

So 0.03924 + 0.0035316 = 0.0427716.

Adding to 0.327: 0.327 + 0.0427716 = 0.3697716 grams.

So 0.3697716 grams Zn in 2 grams sample.

Percentage is (0.3697716 / 2) *100 = 18.4883%.

So approximately 18.49%, which is about 18.5%. But the options don't have 18.5%. The closest options are F (18%) and D (19%).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole ratio. Let me check the reaction again.

The reaction is 2 ZnCl₂ + K4Fe(CN)6 → Zn2Fe(CN)6 + 4 KCl.

So for every 2 moles of ZnCl₂, we get 1 mole of Zn2Fe(CN)6.

So each mole of Zn2Fe(CN)6 corresponds to 2 moles of Zn²+.

That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial computation of moles of precipitate was wrong. Let me do 0.969 /342.6 exactly.

Compute 342.6 × 0.0028 = 0.95868. The difference is 0.969 - 0.95868 = 0.01032.

So how much more than 0.0028 is needed?

0.01032 / 342.6 ≈ 0.0000301. So total moles ≈ 0.0028301.

So 0.0028301 mol.

Then 2 * 0.0028301 = 0.0056602 mol Zn.

Mass Zn: 0.0056602 * 65.4.

Compute 0.005 *65.4 = 0.327.

0.0006602 *65.4.

0.0006 *65.4=0.03924.

0.0000602 *65.4= approx 0.0039358.

So 0.03924 + 0.0039358 = 0.0431758.

Total Zn mass: 0.327 + 0.0431758 = 0.3701758 grams.

Percentage: 0.3701758 / 2 = 0.1850879, so 18.50879%, which is approximately 18.51%.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that. The closest is F (18%) and D (19%).

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the formula. Let me make sure about the molar masses.

Wait, the molecular weight given is Zn₂Fe(CN)₆ = 342.6.

Zn is 65.4 *2 = 130.8.

Fe is 55.85.

CN is 26 (12+14) each, so 6 *26=156.

Adding them: 130.8 + 55.85 = 186.65; 186.65 +156 = 342.65. So 342.6 is correct.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should check the initial step again. Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

0.969 grams divided by 342.6 g/mol.

Let me compute 0.969 ÷ 342.6.

342.6 goes into 969 how many times? Let's see:

342.6 × 2 = 685.2 → 685.2, subtract from 969: 283.8 left.

Bring down a zero; 342.6 × 0.8 = 274.08.

283.8 - 274.08 = 9.72.

So 2.8 times with some remainder.

So 0.969 / 342.6 ≈ 0.002827 or 2.827e-3.

So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the precipitate is Zn₂Fe(CN)₆, which contains two Zn atoms. So each mole of the precipitate corresponds to two moles of Zn. So my calculation is correct in that.

So 2 * 2.827e-3 = 5.654e-3 mol Zn.

Mass of Zn: 5.654e-3 *65.4 = let me compute that.

5.654e-3 is 0.005654.

0.005654 *65.4.

Let me compute 0.005 *65.4 = 0.327.

0.000654 *65.4.

Hmm, 0.0006 *65.4 = 0.03924.

0.000054 *65.4 = 0.0035316.

So 0.03924 + 0.0035316 = 0.0427716.

So 0.327 + 0.0427716 = 0.3697716 grams.

So that's 0.3697716 grams of Zn.

Percentage is (0.3697716 / 2) *100 = 18.4883%.

So approximately 18.49%, which is 18.5% when rounded to one decimal.

Looking at the options, F is 18%, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I should consider more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

Let me compute 0.969 / 342.6 precisely.

Compute 0.969 ÷ 342.6.

342.6 × 0.0028 = 0.95868 → 0.969 - 0.95868 = 0.01032.

Now, 0.01032 / 342.6 = 0.0000301.

So total moles = 0.0028 + 0.0000301 = 0.0028301 mol.

Then 2 * 0.0028301 = 0.0056602 mol Zn.

Mass of Zn is 0.0056602 * 65.4.

Compute 0.005 *65.4 = 0.327.

0.0006602 *65.4.

Compute 0.0006 *65.4 = 0.03924.

0.0000602 *65.4 = 0.0039358.

So 0.03924 + 0.0039358 = 0.0431758.

Total mass Zn: 0.327 + 0.0431758 = 0.3701758 grams.

Percentage: (0.3701758 / 2) *100 = 18.50879%.

So 18.50879%, which is 18.51%.

The options don't have 18.5%, but F is 18%, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula of the precipitate is different? Let me check the problem statement again.

It says the precipitate is Zn₂Fe(CN)₆. So the formula is correct.

Wait, maybe the molar ratio is different? Let me check the reaction again.

The reaction is 2 ZnCl₂ + K4Fe(CN)6 → Zn₂Fe(CN)6 + 4 KCl.

So yes, 2 moles of ZnCl₂ produce 1 mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6. So each mole of precipitate has 2 Zn atoms. So the calculation is correct.

So perhaps the answer is 18.5%, but since that's not an option, the closest is F:18%. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculations because the options may have exact values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact numbers.

Let me compute moles of Zn₂Fe(CN)6 as 0.969 /342.6 = let me compute that precisely.

342.6 = 3426 * 0.1.

0.969 / 342.6 = (0.969 *10) / 3426 = 9.69 / 3426.

Let me compute 9.69 ÷ 3426.

3426 goes into 9.69 zero times. Let's compute as 9.69 / 3426 ≈ 0.002827.

So, 0.002827 moles.

Then, moles of Zn is 2 * 0.002827 = 0.005654.

Mass Zn = 0.005654 *65.4.

Compute 0.005654 *65.4.

Let me compute this as:

65.4 * 0.005 = 0.327.

65.4 * 0.000654.

Compute 65.4 *0.0006 = 0.03924.

65.4 *0.000054 = 0.0035316.

So 0.03924 + 0.0035316 = 0.0427716.

So total mass Zn = 0.327 + 0.0427716 = 0.3697716 grams.

Percentage = (0.3697716 / 2) *100 = 18.4883%.

So, approximately 18.49%.

Hmm, the options don't have 18.5%, but option F is 18%, and D is 19%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometric ratio.

Wait, the reaction is 2 ZnCl₂ + K4Fe(CN)6 → Zn₂Fe(CN)6 + 4 KCl.

So 2 moles of ZnCl₂ produce 1 mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6.

So per mole of Zn₂Fe(CN)6, 2 moles of Zn are precipitated.

So that's correct. So the moles of Zn are 2 * moles of precipitate.

So, I think my calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the percentage to be rounded to the nearest whole number. 18.4883% is approximately 18.5%, which would round to 19% if the next digit is 5 or more. Wait, 18.4883 is closer to 18% than 19%, as the decimal part is .4883, which is less than 0.5. So it should be rounded to 18%.

So the answer would be F: 18% Zn.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the miscalculation is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula weight of Zn₂Fe(CN)6 is wrong. Let me recalculate it.

Zn: atomic weight 65.4, two atoms → 130.8.

Fe: 55.85.

Each CN⁻ group has a molecular weight of 26 (12 +14).

There are 6 CN⁻ groups → 6 *26=156.

Total: 130.8 +55.85 +156 = 130.8 +55.85 is 186.65; 186.65 +156=342.65 g/mol. So the given 342.6 is correct.

So, the molecular weight is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is F:18%.

Looking at the options, F is 18%, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the problem statement to ensure I didn't make any other mistake.

The sample is 2 grams, yields 0.969 grams of Zn₂Fe(CN)6.

Yes.

So, I think the correct answer
