Okay, so I've got this complex integral to solve: the integral of (5z - 2) divided by (z times (z - 1)) around the circle with |z|=2. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with integrals like this, especially around a closed contour, Cauchy's Integral Formula or the Residue Theorem should be useful.

Wait, first, I should probably simplify the integrand. Let's see, the denominator is z(z-1), so maybe partial fractions can help here. Partial fractions are a way to break down complicated rational functions into simpler ones that are easier to integrate.

So the integrand is (5z - 2)/(z(z-1)). Let me set that up for partial fractions. I can express it as A/z + B/(z-1), where A and B are constants to find.

Multiplying both sides by z(z-1):

5z - 2 = A(z - 1) + B(z)

Now, let's solve for A and B. Maybe plug in convenient values of z. Let z=0: then the left side is (5*0 -2) = -2. On the right, A(-1) + B(0) → -A = -2 → A=2.

Next, let z=1: the left side is (5*1 -2)=3. On the right, A(0) + B(1)= B. So B=3.

So the integrand becomes (2/z) + (3/(z-1)). That should make the integral easier.

Now, the integral around |z|=2 is the sum of the residues inside this contour. The function has singularities at z=0 and z=1. Both of these points are inside the circle |z|=2 because their magnitudes are 0 and 1, both less than 2.

The residue at a simple pole z=a is just the coefficient of 1/(z-a) in the partial fraction decomposition. So here, the residue at z=0 is 2, and at z=1 it's 3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. So for each term, I can integrate them separately.

So the integral becomes:

Integral = ∫(2/z) dz + ∫(3/(z-1)) dz, over the contour |z|=2.

Each integral is straightforward. The integral of 1/z around a circle enclosing 0 is 2πi, so ∫2/z dz = 2*(2πi) = 4πi.

Similarly, ∫3/(z-1) dz around the contour. Since z=1 is inside |z|=2, this integral is 3*(2πi) = 6πi.

Adding them together: 4πi + 6πi = 10πi.

Wait, but the problem says the answer is A i, so A would be 10π. Because 10πi is the result.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're all numbers like 26.2, 24.7, etc. Oh, because they're giving the numerical value of A, where the answer is A i. So I need to compute 10π numerically.

Let me calculate 10π. Pi is approximately 3.14159265. So 10 * 3.14159265 is 31.4159265. Looking at the options, option C is 31.4, which is close. So A should be 31.4, which is option C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Did I miss anything? The partial fractions were correct. Let me see:

(5z -2)/[z(z-1)] = A/z + B/(z-1)

Solving gives A=2, B=3. So the decomposition is correct.

Each term's residue is correctly identified as A and B, so the residues are 2 and 3.

Integral is sum of residues times 2πi: (2+3)*2πi =10πi. So yes, A is 10π, which is approximately 31.4. So the correct answer should be option C.

To compute the integral 

\[
\int_{|z| = 2} \frac{5z - 2}{z(z - 1)} \, dz,
\]

we first simplify the integrand using partial fractions. The denominator \( z(z - 1) \) suggests decomposing the rational function as:

\[
\frac{5z - 2}{z(z - 1)} = \frac{A}{z} + \frac{B}{z - 1}.
\]

Multiplying through by \( z(z - 1) \) gives:

\[
5z - 2 = A(z - 1) + Bz.
\]

To find \( A \) and \( B \), we substitute convenient values of \( z \). Setting \( z = 0 \), we find:

\[
5(0) - 2 = A(-1) \implies -2 = -A \implies A = 2.
\]

Setting \( z = 1 \), we find:

\[
5(1) - 2 = B(1) \implies 3 = B.
\]

Thus, the integrand becomes:

\[
\frac{5z - 2}{z(z - 1)} = \frac{2}{z} + \frac{3}{z - 1}.
\]

The integral around the contour \( |z| = 2 \) is evaluated using the Residue Theorem. The function has simple poles at \( z = 0 \) and \( z = 1 \), both of which lie inside the contour \( |z| = 2 \). The residues at these poles are the coefficients of \( \frac{1}{z} \) and \( \frac{1}{z - 1} \), which are 2 and 3, respectively. The Residue Theorem states that the integral is \( 2\pi i \) times the sum of the residues:

\[
\int_{|z| = 2} \frac{5z - 2}{z(z - 1)} \, dz = 2\pi i (2 + 3) = 10\pi i.
\]

The problem specifies that the answer is \( A i \), so \( A = 10\pi \). Numerically, \( 10\pi \approx 31.4 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest value is **31.4**, which corresponds to option **C**.
