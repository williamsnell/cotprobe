Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the reduction of a carbon particle in a fluidized reactor. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the setup is a reaction happening in the presence of air. The reactor is at 1200 K, and the limiting factor is the diffusion of oxygen against carbon monoxide formed at the particle surface. The particle is spherical, with a diameter of 2.0e-4 m. It's made of pure carbon, and the density is 1.35e3 kg/m³. The diffusivity of oxygen in the mixture is 1.5e-4 m²/s. We're assuming steady state, and we need to find the time it takes to reduce the diameter to 8e-5 m. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, okay, so this is a problem about the combustion of a carbon particle, where the reaction rate is limited by diffusion. I remember that in such cases, the rate of reaction is controlled by how fast oxygen can diffuse to the particle's surface. Since the carbon is being consumed, the diameter decreases over time.

I think the key here is to model the particle's shrinkage as a function of time. Since it's a sphere, the volume changes, but because it's homogeneous (same density throughout), the mass loss is directly related to the volume loss.

Let me outline the steps I think I'll need to take:

1. **Determine the initial and final radius.**
   The initial diameter is 2.0e-4 m, so initial radius r_initial = 1.0e-4 m. The final diameter is 8e-5 m, so final radius r_final = 4e-5 m.

2. **Find the rate of change of the radius.**
   Since the reaction is diffusion-controlled, the burning rate is determined by the diffusion of oxygen to the surface. I recall that for a diffusion-controlled reaction, the rate is given by the flux of the reactant (oxygen) to the surface.

3. **Relate the flux to the rate of consumption of carbon.**
   The flux of oxygen will determine how fast carbon is consumed. Let's think about the reaction: Carbon reacts with oxygen to form carbon monoxide. The reaction is C + O2 → CO. But wait, the stoichiometry might matter here. Alternatively, maybe it's more accurate to model this using the diffusion equation and the molar flux.

4. **Use the diffusion equation.**
   Oh right, Fick's law comes into play here. The molar flux J of oxygen to the surface would be (D * concentration gradient) / (thickness), but since this is in a sphere, perhaps the expression is adjusted. Alternatively, for a sphere, the steady-state diffusion flux is given by J = (D * C) / r, where C is the concentration of oxygen in the bulk, and r is the radius. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I should start from the basics. The rate of consumption of carbon is equal to the rate at which oxygen is diffusing to the surface. So the number of moles of O2 diffusing per unit time equals the number of moles of C consumed per unit time (considering stoichiometry).

Wait, but the reaction is C + O2 → CO. So for each mole of C consumed, one mole of O2 is needed. So the molar flux of O2 should equal the molar consumption rate of C.

Wait, but wait a second, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for C and O2 in this reaction. So the molar flux of O2 into the sphere equals the molar rate at which C is consumed.

So, the molar flux J (mol/(m²·s)) would be the rate per unit area. But for a sphere, the total rate would be J multiplied by the surface area.

Alternatively, the rate of consumption of carbon (in moles per second) is equal to the product of the molar flux of O2 and the surface area of the particle.

Wait, but another approach is to model the rate of change of the radius as a function of time. Since the reaction is diffusion-limited, the rate of radius decrease is determined by the diffusion rate.

I remember that for a spherical particle undergoing a reaction limited by external diffusion (like in a fluidized bed), the time for the particle to shrink can be calculated using the formula derived from Fick's law.

The formula I think is:

t = (ρ * r_initial^2 - ρ * r_final^2) / (2 * M_C * D_O2 * C_O2)

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the time to reduce the radius from r0 to rf is given by integrating the rate of change over time.

Let me try to formulate this. The rate of change of the radius is dr/dt, which is related to the flux of O2. The flux J is the molar flux, which is (D * C_O2) / (r), perhaps, considering steady-state diffusion.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the molar consumption rate. Let me consider the particle's surface: the rate at which O2 reaches the surface is given by Fick's law of diffusion. For a sphere, the diffusion flux is J = (D * C_O2) / r, where r is the radius at time t.

But wait, the units don't seem to add up. The flux J has units of mol/(m²·s), and D has m²/s, C_O2 is mol/m³. So (D [m²/s] * C_O2 [mol/m³]) would give mol/(m·s), and dividing by r (m) gives mol/(m²·s), which matches the flux units. So yes, J = (D * C_O2) / r.

Now, the total moles of O2 per second diffusing into the sphere is J multiplied by the surface area (4πr²). So the molar rate is (D * C_O2 / r) ) * 4πr² = 4π D C_O2 r.

This rate equals the molar rate of consumption of C. Since each mole of O2 consumes one mole of C, the rate of C consumption is 4π D C_O2 r.

Wait, but wait, the molar rate of consumption of C is d(n_C)/dt, where n_C is the number of moles in the particle. Since the particle is shrinking, n_C(t) = (mass of C) / M_C, and mass is density * volume. So,

n_C(t) = (ρ * (4/3) π r(t)^3) / M_C

Taking the derivative with respect to time,

dn_C/dt = (ρ * 4π r² dr/dt) / M_C

But dn_C/dt is negative, since the particle is losing mass. The rate of consumption (positive) is equal to the molar rate from O2, which is 4π D C_O2 r.

So,

(ρ * 4π r² (dr/dt) ) / M_C = 4π D C_O2 r

Simplify this equation:

Divide both sides by 4π r:

(ρ r dr/dt) / M_C = D C_O2

Then,

dr/dt = (D C_O2 M_C) / (ρ r)

Wait, this gives dr/dt proportional to 1/r. Hmm, let me check the algebra again.

Wait, from the earlier step:

(ρ * 4π r² (dr/dt) ) / M_C = 4π D C_O2 r

We can cancel 4π from both sides:

(ρ r² dr/dt) / M_C = D C_O2 r

Then, multiply both sides by M_C:

ρ r² dr/dt = D C_O2 M_C r

Divide both sides by r²:

ρ dr/dt = (D C_O2 M_C ) / r

Wait, that would make dr/dt = (D C_O2 M_C) / (ρ r² )

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I should have:

From (ρ * 4π r² dr/dt) / M_C = 4π D C_O2 r

Divide both sides by 4π:

(ρ r² dr/dt) / M_C = D C_O2 r

Multiply both sides by M_C:

ρ r² dr/dt = D C_O2 r M_C

Then, divide both sides by r²:

ρ dr/dt = D C_O2 M_C / r

So, dr/dt = (D C_O2 M_C) / (ρ r² )

Hmm, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I should think of this as:

dr/dt = -(D C_O2 M_C) / (ρ r² )

Wait, but since the radius is decreasing, dr/dt is negative. So perhaps the equation is:

dr/dt = - (D C_O2 M_C) / (ρ r² )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign here. Let me proceed.

Now, to find the time t, I need to integrate dr/dt from r_initial to r_final.

So,

dt = - (ρ r² ) / (D C_O2 M_C ) dr

The negative sign because as t increases, r decreases. So when integrating from r_initial to r_final (which is smaller than initial), the limits will account for it.

So, integrate from t=0 to t=T, and r goes from r0 to rf.

Integrating,

T = ∫ (ρ r² ) / (D C_O2 M_C ) dr from r0 to rf

But wait, with the negative sign:

T = ∫ (from r0 to rf) [ (ρ r² ) / (D C_O2 M_C ) ] dr

Because dt = -(ρ r²)/(D C_O2 M_C) dr, and when r decreases, dr is negative, so T is positive.

So,

T = (ρ / (D C_O2 M_C )) ∫ (from r0 to rf) r² dr

Compute the integral:

∫ r² dr = [ r^3 / 3 ] evaluated from r0 to rf.

So,

T = (ρ / (D C_O2 M_C )) * ( rf^3/3 - r0^3/3 )

Factor out 1/3,

T = (ρ / (3 D C_O2 M_C )) ( rf^3 - r0^3 )

Wait, but wait a second, if rf < r0, then (rf^3 - r0^3) is negative. But time can't be negative, so perhaps I should take absolute value, or maybe I messed up the limits. Let me think again.

Wait, in the integration, when r goes from r0 to rf, which is smaller, so the integral from r0 to rf would be negative. But since T is positive, perhaps I should have:

T = (ρ / (3 D C_O2 M_C )) ( r0^3 - rf^3 )

Yes, that makes sense.

So,

T = (ρ (r0^3 - rf^3)) / (3 D C_O2 M_C )

Wait, but I need to know the concentration of oxygen, C_O2. The problem doesn't give it, but perhaps it's assumed that the oxygen is in abundance, and the concentration is taken as a standard value or perhaps it's part of the diffusion coefficient in a way that the product D*C is known. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify C_O2, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should use the ideal gas law to find the concentration of O2 in the air at 1200 K.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the pressure, but perhaps it's at atmospheric pressure, say 1 atm. Let me check the problem statement again.

Ah, the problem says "presence of air", but it doesn't specify the partial pressure of O2. Wait, but maybe I can assume that the concentration of O2 in air is 21% by volume, so the mole fraction is 0.21. But without knowing the pressure, I can't compute the exact concentration. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a standard value for C_O2.

Wait, but looking back, the problem gives the diffusivity D as 1.5e-4 m²/s, but without knowing C_O2, I can't compute the flux. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration is such that the product D*C_O2 is a known value, but it's not provided in the question. Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Wait, maybe I should model this without needing C_O2, perhaps by using the concept of the mass transfer coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is written in such a way that the concentration of O2 is considered as 1 in some normalized terms, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the problem is considering the reaction as the diffusion of O2 through a stationary layer of CO, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration of O2 at the surface is zero because it's reacting completely, and the concentration in the bulk is some value, but without knowing that, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem gives the diffusivity D of O2 in the mixture. But without the concentration, how can I compute the flux? Maybe I'm missing a key assumption here.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the partial pressure of O2 is such that its concentration is C = P/(R T), where P is pressure, R is gas constant, and T is temperature. But since the pressure isn't given, perhaps it's 1 atm.

Wait, okay, let's try that. Let's assume that the oxygen is at 1 atm (101325 Pa), temperature is 1200 K. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT → n/V = P/(RT) → concentration C_O2 = P/(R T).

So, R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K). So,

C_O2 = 101325 / (8.314 * 1200) ≈ let's compute that.

Compute denominator: 8.314 * 1200 ≈ 9976.8

So, 101325 / 9976.8 ≈ 10.16 mol/m³.

Wait, but the pressure might be in Pascals, and R in J/(mol·K), which uses Pascals. So yes, that should work.

So, C_O2 ≈ 10.16 mol/m³.

Now, I can plug this into the equation for T.

So,

T = (ρ (r0³ - rf³)) / (3 D C_O2 M_C )

I have all the values now:

ρ = 1350 kg/m³ (wait, 1.35e3 is 1350 kg/m³)
r0 = 1.0e-4 m (since initial diameter is 2e-4 m)
rf = 4e-5 m (since final diameter is 8e-5 m)
D = 1.5e-4 m²/s
C_O2 = approx 10.16 mol/m³
M_C = molar mass of carbon, which is 0.012 kg/mol (12 g/mol)

Plugging these into the equation:

T = (1350 * ( (1.0e-4)^3 - (4e-5)^3 )) / (3 * 1.5e-4 * 10.16 * 0.012 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute r0³ and rf³.

r0 = 1e-4 m → r0³ = (1e-4)^3 = 1e-12 m³
rf = 4e-5 m → rf³ = (4e-5)^3 = 64e-15 = 6.4e-14 m³

So, r0³ - rf³ = (1e-12) - (6.4e-14) = let's see, 1e-12 is 10e-12, minus 0.64e-12 → 9.36e-12 m³.

Wait, 1e-12 = 1e-12, 6.4e-14 is 0.64e-12, so 1e-12 - 0.64e-12 = 0.36e-12 → 3.6e-13 m³.

Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately:

(1e-4)^3 = 1e-12
(4e-5)^3 = 64e-15 = 6.4e-14
So, 1e-12 = 10e-12, 6.4e-14 = 0.64e-12.

So 10e-12 - 0.64e-12 = 9.36e-12 m³? Wait, no: 1e-12 is 1.0e-12, 6.4e-14 is 0.064e-12, so subtracting gives 0.936e-12 m³.

Wait, wait: 1e-12 = 1.0e-12, 6.4e-14 is 0.64e-12 (because 6.4e-14 = 6.4 * 1e-14 = 0.64 * 1e-12). So 1.0e-12 - 0.64e-12 = 0.36e-12 m³.

Wait, no, 1.0 - 0.64 = 0.36, so it's 0.36e-12 m³ = 3.6e-13 m³.

Wait, perhaps I should do it numerically:

(1e-4)^3 = 1e-12
(4e-5)^3 = (4)^3 * (1e-5)^3 = 64 * 1e-15 = 6.4e-14

So, 1e-12 = 10e-12, 6.4e-14 = 0.64e-12. So 10e-12 - 0.64e-12 = 9.36e-12 m³.

Wait, that's correct. So,

r0³ - rf³ = 9.36e-12 m³.

Now, compute numerator: ρ * (r0³ - rf³) = 1350 kg/m³ * 9.36e-12 m³ = let's compute that.

1350 * 9.36e-12 = ?

135
