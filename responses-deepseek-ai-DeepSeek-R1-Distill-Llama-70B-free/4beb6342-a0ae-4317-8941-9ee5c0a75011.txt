Okay, so I've got this question about Epicurus and his philosophy. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which virtue Epicurus claims all other virtues spring from. The options are from A to J, with various virtues listed.

First, I remember that Epicurus was a Greek philosopher who founded Epicureanism. His teachings focused a lot on attaining happiness and living a virtuous life, but he had some specific ideas about what virtue meant. I think he didn't believe in the Platonic form of virtues being abstract and separate. Instead, he probably thought of them as qualities that help achieve a good life.

Epicurus talked about the four cardinal virtues, if I'm not mistaken. Wait, no, maybe that's the Stoics. Or was it Plato? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Anyway, the key point is that he might have considered one virtue as the foundation for others.

I recall that for Epicurus, wisdom was really important. He believed that wisdom is the principal virtue because it's the one that helps individuals make decisions that lead to a tranquil and happy life. So wisdom would be the starting point from which other virtues like courage, justice, and temperance stem.

Let me think about each option. A: temperance. That's more about moderation, right? B: self-control. Similar to temperance. C: humility, not sure if that's a key term for Epicurus. D: faith, doesn't sound right because Epicureanism wasn't about religious faith. E: integrity, that's more about honesty and being whole, maybe not the root. F: courage, perhaps, but I don't think it's the primary one. G: honesty, again, more of a subset. H: wisdom. Yeah, that rings a bell. I: justice, maybe, but I think it's more about the social contract for Epicurus. J: prudence, which is similar to wisdom but maybe more about practicality.

Wait, prudence is about making good judgments, which is part of wisdom. But I think Epicurus specifically emphasized wisdom as the key. So the answer should be H: wisdom.
