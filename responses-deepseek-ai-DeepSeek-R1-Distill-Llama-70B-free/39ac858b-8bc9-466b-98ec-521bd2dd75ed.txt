Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide when its weight percent in water is 50%. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, first, I remember that mole fraction is the ratio of the moles of a component to the total moles in the solution. So, for NaOH in water, I need to find moles of NaOH divided by total moles (NaOH + H2O).

The weight percent is 50%, which means that in 100 grams of solution, 50 grams are NaOH and 50 grams are water. That makes sense. So I can assume a 100g solution for simplicity.

Wait, but I need to convert those grams into moles to find the mole fraction. Right, because mole fraction is based on moles, not mass.

So, I need the molar masses. Sodium hydroxide, NaOH: Sodium is about 23 g/mol, Oxygen is 16, Hydrogen is 1. So 23 +16 +1 = 40 g/mol. Water is H2O: 2(1) +16=18 g/mol.

So for NaOH: 50g /40 g/mol = 1.25 moles. And for water: 50g /18 g/mol ≈ 2.7778 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 50 divided by 18 is approximately 2.777... Yeah.

So total moles = 1.25 + 2.7778 ≈ 4.0278 moles. Then the mole fraction of NaOH is 1.25 /4.0278. Let me calculate that.

1.25 divided by 4.0278. Let me do this division. 4.0278 times 0.3 is approximately 1.2083. Hmm, 0.3 would be 1.2083, which is a bit less than 1.25. So maybe 0.31 or 0.311? Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 4.0278 times 0.31 equals 1.2486. That's really close to 1.25. So 0.31 would give 1.2486, which is just a tiny bit less than 1.25. The actual value would be approximately 0.31. So the mole fraction is about 0.311.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.311. That seems to match my calculation. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, did I mix up the numerator and denominator? No, mole fraction is moles of solute (NaOH) over total moles. So 1.25/(1.25 +2.7778) is correct. Yep, that's right.

So the answer should be A: 0.311.

To calculate the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in a solution where the weight percent of NaOH is 50%, we proceed as follows:

1. **Understand the problem**: A 50% weight percent means that in 100 g of solution, 50 g is NaOH and 50 g is water (H₂O).

2. **Convert masses to moles**:
   - Molar mass of NaOH = 23 (Na) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) = 40 g/mol.  
     Moles of NaOH = \( \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Molar mass of H₂O = 2(1) + 16 = 18 g/mol.  
     Moles of H₂O = \( \frac{50}{18} \approx 2.7778 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate total moles**:  
   Total moles = \( 1.25 + 2.7778 \approx 4.0278 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Determine mole fraction of NaOH**:  
   Mole fraction = \( \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{1.25}{4.0278} \approx 0.311 \).

5. **Match with options**: The closest option is **A: 0.311**.

Thus, the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide is **0.311**.
