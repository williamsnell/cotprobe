Okay, so I've got this problem about a 3-phase line with three 0000 solid conductors arranged in an equilateral triangle, each side being 4 feet. I need to find the reactance drop per conductor per mile when 120-amp, 25-cycle AC current is flowing. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that for three-phase systems, especially when the conductors are spaced apart, we need to calculate the inductance of each phase. Since each conductor is in an equilateral triangle, the distance between any two conductors is 4 feet. But wait, in a 3-phase system, each conductor's reactance depends on the self-inductance and the mutual inductances between the conductors.

Wait, but for a balanced 3-phase system, the mutual inductances might cancel out because of the symmetry. So maybe I can treat each conductor's reactance as just its self-reactance plus some term from mutual inductance. Or maybe in this case, since the line is transposed, the mutual effects average out, and I can just consider each phase as having the same reactance. I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but let's proceed.

I think the formula for the reactance of a single-phase line is X = 2πf * L, where L is the inductance per unit length. For three-phase lines, the inductance per phase can be calculated using the geometric mean of the distances between the conductors. Oh wait, but in a 3-phase system with three conductors, each pair has the same spacing because it's an equilateral triangle. So each phase's inductance should be the same.

The inductance of a single conductor is given by L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(2r)), but wait, I'm mixing up the formulas. Wait, the inductance per unit length for a single conductor is (μ₀ μr)/(2π) * ln(D/(r)), where D is the distance between the conductor and its return path. But in a three-phase system, each conductor's return current is in the other two, so the effective inductance is calculated considering the distances between each pair of conductors.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inductance matrix. For a three-phase line with symmetric spacing, the inductance matrix is such that each self-inductance L is the same, and each mutual inductance M is the same. But in a balanced system, when calculating the reactance per phase, the mutual terms might affect the total inductance. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, I remember that for a three-phase line, the inductance per phase (L) can be found using the formula L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(GMR)), where D is the distance between the conductors, and GMR is the geometric mean radius. Hmm, wait, but for a 3-phase line, each conductor has a certain GMR, but when considering the distance between phases, perhaps each phase's inductance is based on the distance to the other two.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each phase's inductance being determined by the distances between the conductors. Since it's an equilateral triangle, each conductor is 4 ft from the others. So for each conductor, the inductance per unit length would involve the logarithm of the distance between the conductors divided by the conductor's radius.

Wait, but I need to remember the formula for the inductance of a three-phase line. Oh right, for a three-phase line, the inductance per phase per unit length is given by L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)), where D is the distance between the conductors, and r is the radius of each conductor. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because each phase's current affects the others. Alternatively, for a balanced system, the inductance per phase is given by L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(GMR)), where GMR is the geometric mean radius of the conductor.

Wait, but the problem gives the conductors as 0000 solid, so I need to find their radius. The 0000 (also known as 4/0) AWG has a diameter of about 0.46 inches, so the radius is 0.23 inches. Let me convert that to feet because the spacing is in feet. 0.23 inches is 0.23/12 = approximately 0.019167 feet.

So, each conductor has a radius r = 0.019167 ft. The spacing between any two conductors is 4 ft, as each side of the triangle is 4 ft. So D = 4 ft.

Now, I think the formula for inductance per phase per unit length in a three-phase system where the conductors form an equilateral triangle is L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)). Wait, but wait, I think for three-phase lines, the inductance per phase is actually the same as if each conductor were isolated, except that the mutual inductances affect the overall inductance. But maybe in this problem, since it's an equilateral arrangement, the inductance per phase can be calculated using the distance to the other two conductors.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. I think the standard approach is to calculate the inductance per phase as L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)), where D is the distance between conductors. So for each phase, the inductance would be calculated with D being 4 ft, and r the conductor's radius.

So, let's plug in the numbers. The permeability of free space μ₀ is 4π x 1e-7 H/m. But since we're working in feet, maybe we should convert units. Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the inductance formula in terms of henrys per mile.

Wait, another approach: The reactance X per mile is given by X = 2πf * L, where L is inductance per mile in henrys.

The inductance per mile for a single-phase line is L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) * length in meters. Wait, but the problem is in feet and miles. Let me think in consistent units.

Alternatively, I remember a formula for the inductive reactance of a single-phase line:

X = 2πf * (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) * (length in meters) 

But wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the reactance per mile for a 3-phase line. I think the formula for the reactance of a 3-phase line per phase is X = 2πf * (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) * (length in miles) converted to meters.

Wait, maybe I should look up the standard formula. I remember that for a three-phase line, each phase's inductance is given by L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) * length, and then the reactance is X = 2πf * L.

But wait, I'm getting confused between the units. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, the conductors are 0000 AWG solid, which have a certain radius. I looked up that 0000 AWG has a diameter of 0.46 inches, so radius is 0.23 inches, which is 0.23/12 = 0.019167 feet.

The distance D between the conductors is 4 feet, as each side of the equilateral triangle is 4 ft.

The relative permeability μr for copper is 1, assuming non-magnetic materials.

The permeability of free space μ₀ is 4π x 1e-7 H/m. But I might need to convert this to henrys per foot or something compatible with feet.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the inductance per mile. Let's think in miles. One mile is 5280 feet.

The inductance per mile L (in H/mi) is given by:

L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) * (1 mile in meters) ?

Wait, no. Let me think. The formula for inductance per unit length (henrys per foot) is:

L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) 

But wait, I think the correct formula for the inductance per unit length (in H/ft) is:

L = (2π x μ₀ μr) / (2π) * (1/(2π)) * ln(D/(r)) 

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. I think I'm getting mixed up here. Let me recall: The inductance of a straight conductor is given by L = μ₀ μr * (length) * (ln(b/a)), where a is the radius, and b is the distance from the conductor to the return path. But for a single-phase two-wire line, the inductance is L = (μ₀ μr * l) / (π) * ln(D/(r)), where D is the distance between the wires. Wait, no, I think for a two-wire line, the inductance per unit length is L = (μ₀ μr) / (π) * ln(D/(r)).

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing inductance formulas. Let me think. For a single-phase two-wire line, the inductance per unit length is:

L = (2π x μ₀ μr) / (2π) * (1/(2π)) * ln(D/(r)) 

Wait, that's not right. Let me look up the correct formula. Oh wait, in my notes, the inductance per unit length for a two-wire line is L = (μ₀ μr) / (π) * ln(D/(r)), where D is the center-to-center distance between the two wires, and r is the radius of each wire. But since we're dealing with a three-phase line, maybe the approach is different.

Wait, perhaps for a three-phase line, each conductor's inductance is calculated considering the other two conductors as return paths. So the total inductance for each phase would be based on the mutual inductances between each pair.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a three-phase line with equilateral spacing, the inductance per phase is the same as if each conductor were isolated, but perhaps that's not accurate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for the inductance of a three-phase line. The inductance per phase per unit length for a three-phase line with conductors arranged in an equilateral triangle is given by L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)), where D is the distance between conductors, and r is the radius of each conductor. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because in a three-phase system, each phase's current affects the others. But perhaps due to symmetry, the mutual inductances average out, and each phase's inductance is as given by that formula.

So let's proceed with that. So L per phase per mile would be:

L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) 

But wait, that would be in henrys per unit length. Since we're looking per mile, we need to calculate L per mile.

Wait, let me get the units straight. The permeability μ₀ is in H/m. So let's make sure all units are consistent.

Wait, let's see. Let me convert D and r into meters because μ₀ is in H/m.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to use the formula in terms of natural units. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the reactance directly.

Wait, another approach: The inductive reactance per mile per conductor is given by X = 2πf * L, where L is the inductance per mile.

The inductance per mile for each conductor in a 3-phase system can be calculated using the formula:

L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) 

But wait, I think in this case, for the three-phase line, the inductance per phase is L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that for a three-phase line, the inductance per phase is L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(GMR)), where GMR is the geometric mean radius. But for a solid conductor, the GMR is equal to the radius of the conductor. So that would simplify to the same formula as before.

So, L per mile would be:

L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) * length in miles?

Wait, no, because inductance is per unit length. So for a mile, it's:

L = (μ₀ μr) / (2π) * ln(D/(r)) * (1 mile) ?

But μ₀ is in H/m, and 1 mile is 1609.34 meters. Wait, perhaps I should convert everything to meters.

Wait, let's convert D and r into meters.

D = 4 feet = 4 * 0.3048 meters ≈ 1.2192 meters.

r = 0.23 inches = 0.23 * 0.0254 meters ≈ 0.00584 meters.

So now, μ₀ is 4πe-7 H/m.

So L per mile would be:

L = (4πe-7 H/m) / (2π) * ln(1.2192 / 0.00584) * (1609.34 meters)

Wait, because per mile, it's 1609.34 meters. Wait, no, wait. Wait, inductance per unit length is in H/m. So per mile, it's L_total = L_per_meter * miles_in_meters.

Wait, yes. Because if L is H/m, then for a mile, it's L * 1609.34 m/mile.

So putting it all together:

L = (4πe-7) / (2π) * ln(D/r) * 1609.34

Simplify the constants:

4πe-7 / (2π) = 2e-7.

So L = 2e-7 * ln(D/r) * 1609.34.

Wait, let me compute ln(D/r):

D/r = 1.2192 / 0.00584 ≈ 208.6.

ln(208.6) ≈ 5.34.

So L = 2e-7 * 5.34 * 1609.34.

Compute this:

First, 2e-7 * 5.34 = 1.068e-6.

Then, 1.068e-6 * 1609.34 ≈ 0.001718 H/mile.

Wait, that seems low. Now, the reactance X is 2πf * L.

Given f = 25 Hz.

So X = 2π *25 * 0.001718 H.

Compute that:

2π *25 ≈ 157.08.

157.08 * 0.001718 ≈ 0.270 ohms per mile.

Wait, that can't be right because the answer options are in volts. Oh wait, no, because the question is about the reactance drop per conductor per mile, which would be V = I * X.

So the voltage drop would be I * X.

I is 120 A.

So V = 120 A * 0.270 ohms ≈ 32.4 volts.

Hmm, but looking at the options, that's not exactly matching. The closest options are C:33.8, D:35, E:36.5, F:37.2, G:31.4, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the steps. Let me double-check the calculations.

First, D =4 ft =1.2192 m, r=0.23 inches=0.00584 m.

D/r = 1.2192 / 0.00584 ≈ 208.6.

ln(208.6)=5.34.

Then, L = (4πe-7)/(2π) * ln(D/r) * 1609.34.

Simplify:

(4πe-7)/(2π) = 2e-7.

So L = 2e-7 * 5.34 * 1609.34.

Compute 2e-7 *5.34 = 1.068e-6.

Then 1.068e-6 * 1609.34 ≈ 1.068e-6 *1.60934e3 = 1.068 *1.60934e-3 ≈ 1.720e-3 H/mile.

So X =2πf L =2π*25 *1.720e-3 = 50π *1.720e-3.

50 *3.1416≈157.08.

157.08 *1.720e-3 ≈ 0.2705 ohms/mile.

Then V=I*X=120 *0.2705≈32.46 volts.

Hmm, the closest option is C:33.8, but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps I should have used D in feet and converted μ₀ to foot units. Let me try that approach.

μ₀ in H/m is 4πe-7. Let's convert μ₀ to H/ft.

1 m = 3.28084 ft, so 1 H/m = 1/(3.28084) H/ft ≈ 0.3048 H/ft.

So μ₀ =4πe-7 H/m =4πe-7 * 0.3048 H/ft ≈ 1.2566e-7 H/ft.

Now, D is 4 ft, r is 0.019167 ft.

So ln(D/r) = ln(4 / 0.019167) ≈ ln(208.6) ≈5.34.

Then, L = (μ₀)/(2π) * ln(D/r) * length in ft.

Wait, the formula is L = (μ₀ μr)/(2π) * ln(D/r) * length.

Since μr=1, L = (1.2566e-7 H/ft) / (2π) *5.34 * 5280 ft (since it's per mile).

Wait, no, because per mile, the length is 5280 ft
