Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that one pound of a gas in a piston-cylinder setup undergoes compression from 500 psia to 50 psia. The initial volume is 3 cubic feet per pound. The variation of p and v is such that pv^1.4 is a constant. I need to calculate the change in internal energy when the work performed is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings.

Hmm, I remember that when work done is equal to heat transferred, the internal energy change would be zero because the first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = Q - W. If Q equals W, then ΔU would be zero. But wait, wait... no, that's only if the system is doing work. Let me think again.

Wait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. In this case, the problem says the work performed (I assume by the system) is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. So Q is positive because heat is leaving the system (since it's transferred to the surroundings). So Q = W. Then ΔU = W - W = 0? But wait, no, because here it's the work performed. Wait, in some contexts, when work is done on the system, it's considered negative. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me clarify the sign conventions. In thermodynamics, when the system does work on the surroundings, W is positive. If work is done on the system, W is negative. Similarly, Q is positive when heat is added to the system. So in this problem, the work performed is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. So Q is negative because heat is leaving the system (since it's transferred to surroundings). So Q = -W. Then the first law is ΔU = Q - W. Substituting Q = -W, we get ΔU = (-W) - W = -2W. But wait, the problem says the work performed is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. So maybe I should think of it as W = Q. So Q is the heat leaving the system, so Q is negative. So W would be the work done by the system, which is positive when the system does work.

But wait, the problem states: "the work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred to the surroundings." So the work done (W) is equal to Q. But since Q is heat leaving, Q is negative. So W would be equal in magnitude but positive, because the system is doing work on the surroundings. So W = |Q|. So ΔU = Q - W = (-|W|) - |W| = -2|W|. So internal energy decreases by twice the work done.

Wait, but the problem is about compression. When a gas is compressed, work is done on the gas, right? So the system (gas) is having work done on it. So in that case, the work W would be negative because it's work done on the system. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, let me think again. For compression, the piston is moving in, so the surroundings are doing work on the system (gas). So the work done by the system is negative. So W is negative. So if the work done by the system is negative, and heat is being transferred to the surroundings, Q is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the first law: ΔU = Q - W. But in some textbooks, the first law is written as ΔU = Q + W, where W is work done on the system. So I need to be careful with the sign conventions.

Let me get this straight. The standard formula is ΔU = Q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the system does work (expansion), W is positive. If work is done on the system (compression), W is negative.

In this problem, the gas undergoes compression, so the system is having work done on it. So W is negative. The problem says that the work performed (I think this refers to work done by the system) is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. Wait, maybe the wording is tricky. So if the work performed by the system equals the heat transferred out, then Q = -W.

Wait, the problem says, "the work performed is equal to the amount of heat transferred to the surroundings." So work done by the system (W) equals Q, but Q is heat leaving the system, so Q is negative. So W = Q, but Q is negative, so W is negative as well. So ΔU = Q - W. Let's substitute W for Q: since Q = W (but W is negative), that would make ΔU = W - W = 0? Wait, that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the equation should be ΔU = Q - W, and since W (work done by the system) is equal to Q (heat leaving, so negative), then:

Let me write it numerically. Suppose W = 100 ft·lbf. Then Q = -100 ft·lbf because it's heat leaving. So ΔU = (-100) - (100) = -200 ft·lbf.

Wait, but that would make ΔU negative. So the internal energy decreases. But in compression, for an ideal gas, if it's being compressed, the internal energy should increase because temperature increases. Unless the heat is being released in such a way that the internal energy change is negative.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the signs. Let me think about the process. The gas is being compressed, so the volume decreases. The process follows pv^1.4 = constant, which suggests it's a reversible adiabatic process? No, wait, because in an adiabatic process, Q=0. But here, Q is not zero because heat is being transferred.

Wait, the process here is not adiabatic because Q is not zero. So the equation pv^1.4 = constant is just the relation between p and v for this process, which is a polytropic process with n=1.4.

So to find the change in internal energy, I can use the formula for a polytropic process. The change in internal energy for an ideal gas undergoing a polytropic process can be found using the relation:

ΔU = (P2V2 - P1V1)/(γ - 1), where γ is the heat capacity ratio, which is 1.4 in this case (since n=γ=1.4). Or wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, for a polytropic process, PV^n = constant. The formula for the work done is (P2V2 - P1V1)/(1 - n). But for internal energy, since for an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv ΔT. Alternatively, since ΔU = (ΔQ - ΔW) for the system, but perhaps it's easier to use the internal energy expression in terms of P and V.

Wait, another approach: for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So if I can find the change in temperature, I can find ΔU.

The ideal gas law is PV = mRT. Here, m is mass (1 lbm), R is specific gas constant. So T = PV/(mR).

The change in internal energy ΔU is m Cv (T2 - T1). But since m is 1 lbm, it's just Cv (T2 - T1).

But I need to find T2 and T1. Let's compute them.

Initial state: P1 = 500 psia, V1 = 3 cu.ft/lbm.

Final state: P2 = 50 psia, V2 is unknown, but we can find it using the polytropic relation.

Since PV^1.4 = constant, so P1 V1^1.4 = P2 V2^1.4.

So V2 = [ (P1 / P2) * V1^1.4 ]^(1/1.4)

Plugging in the numbers:

P1 = 500 psia, P2=50 psia.

So (500/50) =10. So 10 * (3)^1.4.

Wait, let me compute that. 3^1.4: let's see, 3^1 =3, 3^0.4 is approximately 3^0.4 = e^(0.4 ln3) ≈ e^(0.4*1.0986) ≈ e^0.439 ≈ 1.552. So 3^1.4 ≈3 *1.552≈4.656.

So 10 * 4.656 ≈46.56. So V2 = (46.56)^(1/1.4).

Now, 1/1.4 ≈0.714. Let me compute 46.56^0.714.

Hmm, log(46.56) ≈ 1.667. Multiply by 0.714: 1.667 *0.714≈1.190.

So 10^1.190 ≈10^(1) *10^0.19 ≈10 * 1.549 ≈15.49 cu.ft/lbm.

Wait, no, wait: actually, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using natural logs.

Wait, maybe a better approach. Let me think: 46.56^(1/1.4) = e^{(ln(46.56))/1.4}.

ln(46.56)= approximately 3.842.

3.842 /1.4 ≈ 2.744. So e^2.744≈15.56.

So V2≈15.56 cu.ft/lbm.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when you compress a gas, the volume should decrease, but here P increases from 500 to 50? Wait no, wait no, wait, initial P is 500 psia, final P is 50 psia. So the pressure is decreasing, so volume should increase. So yes, V increases from 3 to about 15.56. So that makes sense.

Now, compute T1 and T2 using PV=RT.

T1 = (P1 V1)/(R). Similarly, T2 = (P2 V2)/(R).

Since R is specific gas constant. For air, R is about 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R). But wait, the units here need to be consistent.

Wait, P is in psia, V in cu.ft/lbm, so R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R). So let me compute T1 and T2.

T1 = (500 psia * 3 ft³/lbm) / (53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R)) )

Wait, psia is pounds per square inch absolute. To convert to lbf/ft², since 1 psi = 144 psf (pounds per square foot). So 500 psi is 500 * 144 = 72,000 psf.

So T1 = (72000 psf * 3 ft³/lbm) / (53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R)) )

Wait, but units might be getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of T2 to T1.

Since for an ideal gas, T is proportional to PV. So T2/T1 = (P2 V2) / (P1 V1).

From the polytropic relation, since P1 V1^1.4 = P2 V2^1.4, so V2 = V1 (P1/P2)^(1/1.4).

So T2/T1 = (P2 V2)/(P1 V1) = [P2 * V1 (P1/P2)^(1/1.4) ] / (P1 V1) )

Simplify:

= [V1 * P2 * (P1^{1/1.4} / P2^{1/1.4}) ) ] / (P1 V1 )

= [ P2^{(1 - 1/1.4)} * P1^{1/1.4} ) ] / P1

= P2^{(0.4/1.4)} * P1^{(1/1.4 -1)} }

Wait, but 1 - 1/1.4 = (1.4 -1)/1.4 = 0.4/1.4.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

Let me re-express:

T2/T1 = (P2 V2)/(P1 V1) 

But V2 = V1 (P1/P2)^(1/n), where n=1.4.

So substituting:

= (P2 * V1 (P1/P2)^(1/n) ) / (P1 V1 )

= (P2 / P1) * (P1/P2)^(1/n) ) 

= (P1/P2)^{1 - (1/n)} * (P2/P1)^0 ? 

Wait, perhaps better to write as:

= [ (P2) * (P1/P2)^(1/n) ) ] / P1

= P2^{1 - 1/n} * P1^{1/n -1}.

So let me compute it numerically.

n=1.4, P1=500, P2=50.

So 1-1/n = 1 - 1/1.4 = (1.4 -1)/1.4 = 0.4/1.4 ≈ 0.2857.

Similarly, 1/n -1 = (1 -1.4)/1.4 = (-0.4)/1.4 ≈ -0.2857.

So T2/T1 = (50/500)^(0.2857) ? Wait, no, let's compute:

Wait, T2/T1 = (P2/P1)^{1 - 1/n} * (P1/P2)^{something} ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Alternatively, using the exponents:

= (P2)^{1 - 1/n} * P1^{1/n -1}.

= (P2)^{ (n-1)/n } * (P1)^{ (1-n)/n }

= [ (P2) / (P1) )^{ (n-1)/n } ]

Because (P2)^a * (P1)^b where a=(n-1)/n and b=(1-n)/n = a * (P2/P1)^a.

So [ (P2/P1) ]^{(n-1)/n}.

Here, P2/P1 = 50/500 = 0.1.

n-1=0.4, so (n-1)/n = 0.4/1.4 ≈ 0.2857.

So T2/T1 = (0.1)^{0.2857}.

Compute 0.1^0.2857: 0.1 is 10^-1, so exponent is (-1)*0.2857 ≈ -0.2857.

So 10^(-0.2857) ≈ 10^(-0.2857). Let's compute that.

10^0.2857 is approximately e^{0.2857 * ln10} ≈ e^{0.2857*2.3026} ≈ e^{0.6578} ≈ 1.930.

So 10^-0.2857 ≈ 1/1.930 ≈ 0.518.

So T2/T1 ≈ 0.518. So T2 ≈ 0.518 T1.

Wait, but wait, since the volume increases (from 3 to about 15.56), and pressure decreases, the temperature would decrease. So T2 is less than T1, which matches with the ratio being 0.518.

So the temperature decreases. Therefore, internal energy decreases because ΔU = Cv (T2 - T1) = Cv (negative value).

Wait, but the problem states that the work done is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. So in this case, Q = W.

But wait, the first law is ΔU = Q - W. So if Q equals W, then ΔU would be zero? Because Q = W, so ΔU = W - W = 0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if W is negative (work done on the system), and Q is negative (heat leaving), then ΔU would be (Q - W) = (-W) - W = -2W. But perhaps if W is the work done by the system, then in this case, the work done by the system is negative, so W is negative. So Q would be negative as heat is leaving.

Wait, suppose W is the work done by the system. If the system is compressed, the work done by the system is negative, so W is negative. So Q = W → Q is negative (heat is leaving the system). So ΔU = Q - W = (-|W|) - (-|W|) → because W is negative, so -W is positive.

Wait, let me substitute with numbers. Suppose W (work done by system) is -100 ft·lbf (since work is done on the system). Then Q = W = -100 ft·lbf (heat is leaving the system). So ΔU = (-100) - (-100) = 0.

Wait, so ΔU is zero. So the internal energy doesn't change.

But earlier, I thought that T2 is less than T1, so ΔU should be negative. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in that approach.

Wait, but according to the first law, when Q=W, ΔU=0. So regardless of the process, as long as Q=W, the internal energy change is zero.

So perhaps the answer is I: 0 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is "0 Btu/lbm (no change in internal energy)".

So that's the answer. But wait, why did the earlier approach with temperature suggest a decrease? Because in that approach, I assumed Q was not equal to W. So perhaps the confusion arises when the conditions are such that Q=W.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The problem says that the work performed is equal to the heat transferred to the surroundings. So the heat Q is leaving the system (since it's transferred to surroundings). So Q is negative, and the work done is equal to that, so W (work done by the system) is negative as well.

So substituting into the first law: ΔU = Q - W. Since Q = W (both negative), then Q - W = W - W = 0. So ΔU=0.

Therefore, the change in internal energy is zero, which is option I.

But wait, another thought: in the polytropic process where
