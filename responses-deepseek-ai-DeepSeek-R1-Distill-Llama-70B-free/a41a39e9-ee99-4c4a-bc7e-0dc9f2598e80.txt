Okay, so I've got this question about menarche and when it occurs. Menarche, I remember, is the first menstrual cycle, or the first period, that a female experiences. It's a sign of puberty. So the question is asking at what age this typically happens.

The options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says 12 in males only. Wait, no, menarche is for females, so males wouldn't have it. So A can't be right.

Option B: 10 in both sexes. Again, males don't have menarche, so B is incorrect.

Option C: 12 in females and 14 in males. Hmm, but males don't experience menarche. So this option is mixing something else maybe, like the start of male puberty signs, but the question is about menarche specifically. So C is wrong.

Option D: 12 in both sexes. Again, males don't have menarche, so D is out.

Option E: 14 in both sexes. Same issue as D and B, because menarche isn't for males. So E is incorrect.

Option F: 12 in females only. This makes sense. I remember that in females, menarche typically occurs around 12 years old. So F could be the right answer.

Option G: 10 in females only. Some girls start earlier, but on average, it's around 12. So G is not the average.

Option H: 12 in males and 14 in females. No, males don't have menarche, so H is wrong.

Option I: 14 in females only. That's later than the average, so probably not the correct answer.

Option J: 12 in males and 10 in females. Again, males don't have menarche, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F: 12 in females only.

The correct answer is F: 12 in females only. Menarche refers to the first menstrual cycle in females, typically occurring around age 12. Since menarche is specific to females, any options involving males are incorrect.

Answer: F
