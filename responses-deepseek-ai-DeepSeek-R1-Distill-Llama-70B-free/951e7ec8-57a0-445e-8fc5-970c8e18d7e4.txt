Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question. The question is about why Arthur doesn't think the poor have a right to aid from the affluent. I need to select the correct option from A to J.

So, I remember that this is probably related to ethical theories. Maybe something about rights and obligations. Let me think about different philosophers and their views.

I recall that some philosophers argue about positive and negative rights. Negative rights are about freedom from interference, like the right to free speech. Positive rights require others to provide something, like aid or support.

If Arthur doesn't believe the poor have a right to aid, maybe he's arguing against positive rights. So perhaps he thinks that rights should only be negative, not positive. That would mean he doesn't support the idea that the affluent have an obligation to help the poor because it's a positive right, which requires action from others.

Looking at the options, option D says, "The right to aid is a negative right." Wait, that doesn't make sense because aid is something you give, which is a positive action. So maybe D is not the right choice.

Alternatively, maybe Arthur believes that rights can't impose obligations on others. So if someone has a right to aid, that would mean others are obligated to provide it, which might go against his beliefs about individual responsibility or the type of rights that exist.

Wait, another angle. Robert Nozick was a libertarian who believed in minimal state intervention and that people have rights to life, liberty, and property. He argued against redistributive policies because they violate the rights of the affluent by forcing them to help others. So maybe Arthur's reasoning is similar to Nozick's, thinking that redistributing wealth (through aid) infringes on the affluent's rights.

If that's the case, then the reason would be that providing aid requires a contract or agreement, and since the affluent haven't agreed to such, the poor don't have the right. Looking at the options, option B says, "This kind of right would require a contract or agreement, and the affluent haven't entered into a contract or agreement with the poor." That sounds like it could be the reason.

Alternatively, option J says, "Persons can never have a right to aid from anyone." That's a strong statement. If Arthur thinks that rights to aid don't exist at all, that's possible. But I'm not sure if that's the main reason.

Wait, the question is about why Arthur doesn't think the poor have a right. So maybe he's against the concept that the poor can claim aid as a right, perhaps because it's not a natural right or because it requires others' action. So, if the right to aid is a positive right, and Arthur doesn't believe in positive rights, then he would oppose it.

Alternatively, if he thinks that rights must be based on contracts, then since there's no contract between the poor and the affluent, the right doesn't exist. So option B seems to fit that reasoning.

Another option is F: "Arthur believes that the affluent have earned their wealth and should not be obligated to share it." That's more about merit and desert, but the question is about the right to aid, not about whether they should share based on merit.

So considering all this, option B seems to be the best fit.

The main reason Arthur doesn't think the poor have a right to aid from the affluent is that such a right would require a contract or agreement, which the affluent have not entered into with the poor. This aligns with the idea that rights, especially positive rights requiring action from others, must be based on mutual agreements or contracts. Since no such agreement exists, Arthur argues that the poor do not have a right to aid. 

Answer: B
