Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to compute the covariance between two variables, x and y. The data given is x = (1,2,3,4) and y = (2,3,4,5). Hmm, I remember that covariance measures how much two variables change together. But wait, how exactly do I compute that?

I think the formula for covariance involves the means of x and y. Right, the covariance formula is the expectation of (x - x_mean)(y - y_mean) for each pair. So for each data point, I subtract the mean of x and the mean of y, multiply them together, and then average all those products.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I need to find the mean of x and the mean of y.

For x: the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4. Adding them up gives 1+2=3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10. There are 4 numbers, so the mean is 10/4 = 2.5.

For y: the numbers are 2,3,4,5. Adding them gives 2+3=5, +4=9, +5=14. So the mean is 14/4 = 3.5.

Okay, now I need to compute (x_i - x_mean) and (y_i - y_mean) for each i, multiply them, and sum all those products, then divide by n-1 or n? Wait, covariance can be sample or population. Since the problem just says compute covariance, I'm not sure if it's sample (divided by n-1) or population (divided by n). Wait, in the options, some are in fractions, like 0.5, 0.75. Let me think. If I use sample covariance, it's divided by n-1, which is 3 here. But if I use population, it's divided by 4.

Wait, let me check the standard formula. Oh right, the population covariance divides by N, and the sample covariance divides by N-1. So the question doesn't specify, but looking at the options, let's see which one would make sense.

Let me compute both ways and see which option matches.

First, compute each (x_i - x_mean)(y_i - y_mean):

For the first pair (1,2):
x_i - mean_x = 1 - 2.5 = -1.5
y_i - mean_y = 2 - 3.5 = -1.5
Product: (-1.5)*(-1.5) = 2.25

Second pair (2,3):
x: 2 - 2.5 = -0.5
y: 3 - 3.5 = -0.5
Product: (-0.5)*(-0.5) = 0.25

Third pair (3,4):
x: 3-2.5 = 0.5
y:4-3.5=0.5
Product: 0.25

Fourth pair (4,5):
x:4-2.5=1.5
y:5-3.5=1.5
Product: 2.25

Now, sum all these products: 2.25 + 0.25 = 2.5; 2.5 +0.25=2.75; 2.75 +2.25=5.

So the sum is 5.

If I'm treating this as population covariance, I divide by 4: 5/4 = 1.25.

If it's sample covariance, I divide by 3: 5/3 ≈ 1.666..., which is about 1.67.

Looking at the options: option E is 1.25, option F is 1.67.

Wait, but which one is correct? The problem says to compute covariance. I'm a bit confused because sometimes in statistics, when data is a sample, we use n-1, but if it's the entire population, use n.

But in this question, the data given is x and y as four data points each. Are these the entire population or a sample? The question doesn't specify, so I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for covariance can be written as:

Cov(x,y) = E[(x - E[x])(y - E[y])]

Which is the population covariance, so that would be dividing by N.

So in this case, N=4, so 5/4=1.25, which is option E.

But wait, another thought: some textbooks or sources might define sample covariance with n-1. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps in this question, since the data is given as four points each, perhaps it's considered a sample, so using n-1.

So 5 divided by 3 is approximately 1.666..., which is option F (1.67). Hmm, but some of the options are exact fractions.

Wait, 5/4 is 1.25, which is option E. 5/3 is 1.666..., which is option F.

So which one is correct? The question says "compute covariance". Without specifying, I think it's safer to assume population covariance, which uses N. So 1.25, option E.

But wait, let me see if any of the options match that. Option E is 1.25. So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate each term:

For (1,2):

(1-2.5) = -1.5; (2-3.5)= -1.5. Product: (-1.5)^2=2.25.

(2,3):

(2-2.5)= -0.5; (3-3.5)= -0.5. Product: 0.25.

(3,4):

(3-2.5)=0.5; (4-3.5)=0.5. Product: 0.25.

(4,5):

(4-2.5)=1.5; (5-3.5)=1.5. Product: 2.25.

Sum: 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5.

Yes, that's correct. So sum is 5.

So population covariance is 5/4=1.25 (option E), sample is 5/3≈1.666 (option F).

The question doesn't specify whether it's a population or sample. Hmm.

Wait, sometimes, in problems like this, if the data is given as the entire dataset, they consider it population. Otherwise, if it's a sample from a larger dataset, they use sample covariance.

In this case, the data is x=(1,2,3,4) and y=(2,3,4,5). It seems like these are all the data points, implying population, so covariance would be 1.25.

So the answer should be option E: 1.25.

To compute the covariance between \( x = (1, 2, 3, 4) \) and \( y = (2, 3, 4, 5) \), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Cov}(x, y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}),
\]

where \( \bar{x} \) and \( \bar{y} \) are the means of \( x \) and \( y \), respectively. 

### Step 1: Compute the means
- For \( x \):  
  \[
  \bar{x} = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5.
  \]
- For \( y \):  
  \[
  \bar{y} = \frac{2 + 3 + 4 + 5}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5.
  \]

### Step 2: Compute \((x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})\) for each pair
- For \((1, 2)\):  
  \[
  (1 - 2.5)(2 - 3.5) = (-1.5)(-1.5) = 2.25.
  \]
- For \((2, 3)\):  
  \[
  (2 - 2.5)(3 - 3.5) = (-0.5)(-0.5) = 0.25.
  \]
- For \((3, 4)\):  
  \[
  (3 - 2.5)(4 - 3.5) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25.
  \]
- For \((4, 5)\):  
  \[
  (4 - 2.5)(5 - 3.5) = (1.5)(1.5) = 2.25.
  \]

### Step 3: Sum the products
\[
\text{Sum} = 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 = 5.
\]

### Step 4: Divide by \( N \) (population covariance)
Since the problem does not specify whether the data is a sample or population, we assume it is the entire population. Thus, we divide by \( N = 4 \):

\[
\text{Cov}(x, y) = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The computed covariance is \( 1.25 \), which corresponds to **option E**.
