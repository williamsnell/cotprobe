Okay, so I need to figure out which of these options is true. Let me go through each one by one, but I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these concepts, so I'll have to think carefully.

First, I remember that in cost curves, there are fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs don't change with output, like rent. Variable costs do change, such as materials or labor. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: TFC = AVC at all levels of output. Wait, TFC is total fixed cost, which is the same no matter how much you produce. AVC is average variable cost, which does change with output. So they can't be equal at all levels. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: AVC + AFC = TC. Hmm. AVC is average variable cost, which is variable cost per unit. AFC is average fixed cost, fixed cost per unit. TC is total cost. Wait, adding AVC and AFC would give me average total cost (ATC), right? Because ATC = AFC + AVC. But that's average per unit, whereas TC is total. So B is wrong because adding AVC and AFC gives ATC, not TC. Unless they multiply by Q, but B doesn't have Q. So B is incorrect.

Option C: TFC = TC at all levels of output. No, because TC is total fixed plus total variable costs. Unless variable costs are zero, which isn't the case except at zero output maybe. So C is wrong.

Option D: MC = AVC + AFC. MC is marginal cost, which is the change in variable costs. AVC is average variable, and AFC is average fixed. I think the correct relationship is that MC equals AVC when producing beyond a certain point, but adding AFC doesnâ€™t sound right. Because AFC is fixed cost per unit, which doesn't affect marginal cost. So probably D is wrong.

Option E: AFC = TC - AVC. Let me think. AFC is average fixed cost, which is TFC divided by Q. TC is total cost, which is TFC + TVC. AVC is TVC/Q. So TC - AVC would be (TFC + TVC) - (TVC/Q). That's not the same as AFC (TFC/Q). So E doesn't look right. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me write it out: AFC = TFC/Q. TC is TFC + TVC. So TC - AVC would be (TFC + TVC) - (TVC/Q). That's not the same as TFC/Q. So E is wrong.

Option F: ATC = TC - AFC. Wait, ATC is average total cost, which is TC/Q. If I take TC and subtract AFC (which is TFC/Q), that's not the same as ATC. So F is incorrect.

Option G: MC = TC - TFC. Wait, no. MC is the derivative of TC with respect to Q, but also, I think, MC equals the change in TVC. Because TFC is fixed, so the marginal cost is the change in variable costs. So MC is actually equal to TVC's derivative, not TC minus TFC. Because TC is TFC + TVC. So if you subtract TFC, you get TVC. But TVC is a total, not marginal. So G is incorrect.

Option H: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q. Let's see, AVC is TVC/Q, AFC is TFC/Q. So AVC + AFC is (TVC + TFC)/Q. Multiplying by Q gives TVC + TFC, which is indeed TC. So H seems correct. So H is a true statement.

Wait, but I should check the other options just in case.

Option I: TC = MC * Q. No, because MC is the marginal cost, which is the derivative. So for example, if MC is constant, then TC would be MC * Q, but generally, MC is the slope of TC. So TC is the integral of MC over Q, but not necessarily MC * Q. So I is only true if MC is constant, but not generally, so I is incorrect.

Option J: AVC = TC - TFC. AVC is average variable cost, which is TVC/Q. TC is TFC + TVC. So TC - TFC is TVC. So AVC is TVC/Q, which is (TC - TFC)/Q. So J is saying AVC = TC - TFC, which would only be true if Q=1, but generally, no. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer is H. Wait, let me double-check option H. Because (AVC + AFC) * Q equals (AVC*Q) + (AFC*Q) = TVC + TFC = TC. Yes, that's correct. So H is correct.

To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option carefully:

- **Option A**: TFC = AVC at all levels of output.  
  This is incorrect because TFC (Total Fixed Cost) remains constant regardless of output, while AVC (Average Variable Cost) changes with output. They cannot be equal at all levels.

- **Option B**: AVC + AFC = TC.  
  This is incorrect because AVC (Average Variable Cost) + AFC (Average Fixed Cost) equals ATC (Average Total Cost), not TC (Total Cost). TC is the sum of TFC (Total Fixed Cost) and TVC (Total Variable Cost).

- **Option C**: TFC = TC at all levels of output.  
  This is incorrect because TC includes both TFC and TVC. TFC only equals TC if TVC is zero, which is not possible except at zero output.

- **Option D**: MC = AVC + AFC.  
  This is incorrect because MC (Marginal Cost) represents the change in variable costs, while AVC and AFC are average costs. MC is not equal to the sum of AVC and AFC.

- **Option E**: AFC = TC - AVC.  
  This is incorrect because AFC (Average Fixed Cost) is TFC/Q, while TC - AVC would be (TFC + TVC) - (TVC/Q), which is not the same as AFC.

- **Option F**: ATC = TC - AFC.  
  This is incorrect because ATC (Average Total Cost) is TC/Q, not TC - AFC.

- **Option G**: MC = TC - TFC.  
  This is incorrect because MC is the derivative of TVC, not TC - TFC. TC - TFC equals TVC, which is a total, not marginal.

- **Option H**: TC = (AVC + AFC) * Q.  
  This is correct. AVC (TVC/Q) + AFC (TFC/Q) equals (TVC + TFC)/Q, and multiplying by Q gives TC, which is TVC + TFC.

- **Option I**: TC = MC * Q.  
  This is incorrect because TC is not simply MC * Q. MC is the derivative of TC with respect to Q, and TC is the integral of MC over Q.

- **Option J**: AVC = TC - TFC.  
  This is incorrect because AVC is TVC/Q, while TC - TFC equals TVC. AVC is not equal to TVC unless Q = 1.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately represents the relationship between TC, AVC, AFC, and Q.
