Okay, so I have this problem about finding the degree of skewness in a given distribution. The data is presented in a table with class limits and their corresponding frequencies. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. A distribution can be positively skewed (right skewed) or negatively skewed (left skewed). The value of the skewness tells us the direction and extent of this asymmetry.

The formula for skewness, if I recall correctly, involves the mean, the standard deviation, and the third moment of the data. The formula is something like skewness (γ) equals the average of the cubed deviations from the mean divided by the cubed standard deviation. Mathematically, γ = E[(X - μ)^3] / σ^3. Alternatively, if I'm not using the population but a sample, I might need to use a sample-based formula, which involves n, n-1, and other factors, but I think the basic approach is the same.

So, to calculate the skewness, I need to find the mean (μ), the standard deviation (σ), and then compute the third moment around the mean.

Looking at the data provided:

The classes are:
- 49 - 54 with frequency 6 and midpoint 51.5
- 55 - 60 with frequency 15 and midpoint 57.5
- 61 - 66 with frequency 24 and midpoint 63.5
- 67 - 72 with frequency 33 and midpoint 69.5
- 73 - 78 with frequency 22 and midpoint 75.5

Wait, but these midpoints are given, which I can use as the class marks (xi) for each interval. So each xi is the center point of the class interval.

So, the plan is:
1. Calculate the mean (μ) using the class data.
2. Calculate the standard deviation (σ).
3. Calculate the third moment around the mean.
4. Compute the skewness using the formula.

Alternatively, I can use the grouped data method which might involve computing the required sums more efficiently.

Let me proceed step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the mean.

The mean (μ) for grouped data is calculated as the sum of (fi * xi) divided by the total number of observations (N).

First, I'll compute fi * xi for each class.

Compute each fi * xi:

1. 6 * 51.5 = 309
2. 15 * 57.5 = 862.5
3. 24 * 63.5 = 1524
4. 33 * 69.5 = 2295.5
5. 22 * 75.5 = 1651

Now, sum all these up to get the total.

309 + 862.5 = 1171.5
1171.5 + 1524 = 2695.5
2695.5 + 2295.5 = 4991
4991 + 1651 = 6642

Total N (sum of frequencies) is 6 + 15 = 21, 21 +24=45, 45+33=78, 78+22=100. So N=100.

So, μ = 6642 / 100 = 66.42

Wait, let me confirm:

fi sum: 6+15=21, +24=45, +33=78, +22=100. Yes.

Now, the sum of fi*xi is 309 + 862.5 = 1171.5. Then +1524 = 2695.5. Then +2295.5 = 4991. Then +1651 = 6642. Correct.

So μ = 6642 / 100 = 66.42.

Step 2: Compute the standard deviation.

Standard deviation (σ) is the square root of the variance. Variance is calculated as the average of the squared deviations from the mean.

But for grouped data, the formula for variance is:

Variance = [sum(fi*(xi - μ)^2)] / N

So I need to compute (xi - μ)^2 for each class, multiply by fi, sum them, then divide by N and take square root.

Let me compute each (xi - μ)^2 * fi.

First, for each class:

1. xi =51.5, μ=66.42. So (51.5 -66.42) = -14.92. Squared is (-14.92)^2 ≈ 222.7764. Multiply by fi=6: 222.7764 *6 ≈ 1336.6584.

2. xi=57.5. 57.5 -66.42 = -8.92. Squared: 79.5264. Multiply by 15: 79.5264 *15 ≈ 1192.896.

3. xi=63.5. 63.5-66.42 = -2.92. Squared: 8.5264. Multiply by 24: 8.5264 *24 ≈ 204.6336.

4. xi=69.5. 69.5-66.42 = 3.08. Squared: 9.4864. Multiply by 33: 9.4864 *33 ≈ 313.0712.

5. xi=75.5. 75.5-66.42=9.08. Squared ≈ 82.4264. Multiply by 22: 82.4264 *22 ≈ 1813.3808.

Now, sum all these up:

1336.6584 + 1192.896 = 2529.5544

2529.5544 + 204.6336 = 2734.188

2734.188 + 313.0712 = 3047.2592

3047.2592 + 1813.3808 = 4860.64

So sum of fi*(xi - μ)^2 = 4860.64.

Variance = 4860.64 / 100 = 48.6064.

Standard deviation σ = sqrt(48.6064) ≈ 6.97.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(48.6064). Let me see: 7^2 is 49. So sqrt(48.6064) is just a bit less than 7. Let me compute it accurately.

Compute 6.97^2: 6.97 *6.97.

6 *6=36, 6*0.97=5.82, 0.97*6=5.82, 0.97^2=0.9409.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 6.97^2:

= (7 - 0.03)^2 = 49 - 2*7*0.03 + (0.03)^2 = 49 - 0.42 + 0.0009 = 48.5809.

But our variance is 48.6064. So 6.97^2 is 48.5809, which is less than 48.6064. The difference is 48.6064 -48.5809 = 0.0255.

So let's try 6.97 + delta. Let delta be x, such that (6.97 + x)^2 =48.6064.

We have 6.97^2 + 2*6.97*x + x^2 =48.6064.

We can ignore x^2 because x will be small.

So 48.5809 + 13.94 x ≈ 48.6064 → 13.94 x ≈ 0.0255 → x≈0.0255/13.94 ≈ 0.00183.

So σ ≈6.97 +0.00183≈6.9718. Let's say approximately 6.972.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator would be more accurate, but since this is a thought process, let's proceed with σ ≈6.97.

Step 3: Compute the third moment around the mean.

The third moment is sum of [fi*(xi - μ)^3] divided by N.

So I need to compute (xi - μ)^3 for each class, multiply by fi, sum them, then divide by N.

Let me compute each term:

1. xi=51.5, μ=66.42 → (51.5-66.42)= -14.92. Cube it: (-14.92)^3 = -14.92 *14.92 *14.92.

Wait, let me compute 14.92^3:

First, compute 14^3 = 2744.

But 14.92 is a bit more than 14, so let's compute accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps approximate:

But maybe it's easier to compute (-14.92)^3 = - (14.92)^3.

Compute 14.92 *14.92 first. Let's do that:

14.92 *14.92:

Let me compute 14 *14 =196.

14 *0.92 =12.88.

0.92 *14=12.88.

0.92 *0.92=0.8464.

So 14.92 *14.92 = (14 +0.92)^2 =14^2 + 2*14*0.92 +0.92^2= 196 +25.76 +0.8464= 222.6064.

So 14.92^2 ≈222.6064.

Now, 14.92^3 =14.92 *222.6064.

Compute that:

Let me break it down:

14 *222.6064 =3116.4896.

0.92 *222.6064 ≈204.4077.

So total ≈3116.4896 +204.4077 ≈3320.8973.

So (-14.92)^3 ≈-3320.8973.

Multiply by fi=6: -3320.8973 *6 ≈-19925.384.

Wait, that's a large negative number. Let me proceed.

2. xi=57.5, μ=66.42 →57.5-66.42= -8.92. Cube: (-8.92)^3 =- (8.92)^3.

Compute 8.92^3: 8^3=512, 0.92^3≈0.778688, but let's compute accurately.

Compute 8.92 *8.92 =79.5264 (as before). Then multiply by 8.92 again:

79.5264 *8.92.

Let me compute 79.5264 *8 =636.2112.

79.5264 *0.92 =73.133888.

Total ≈636.2112 +73.133888 ≈709.345088.

So (-8.92)^3 ≈-709.3451.

Multiply by fi=15: -709.3451 *15 ≈-10640.1765.

3. xi=63.5, μ=66.42 →63.5-66.42= -2.92. Cube: (-2.92)^3= -24.4096 (since 2.92^3=24.4096).

Multiply by fi=24: -24.4096 *24 ≈-585.8304.

4. xi=69.5, μ=66.42 →3.08. Cube: 3.08^3.

Compute 3^3=27, but 3.08^3=3.08 *3.08=9.4864, then 9.4864 *3.08 ≈29.161952.

Multiply by fi=33: 29.161952 *33 ≈962.344736.

5. xi=75.5, μ=66.42 →9.08. Cube:9.08^3.

Compute 9^3=729. Now, 9.08^3: let's compute 9.08 *9.08 =82.4264, then *9.08 again.

82.4264 *9.08 = let's compute 82.4264 *9=741.8376 and 82.4264 *0.08=6.594112. Total ≈741.8376 +6.594112≈748.4317.

Multiply by fi=22:748.4317 *22≈16,465.5174.

Now, let's sum all these terms:

Term1: -19925.384

Term2: -10640.1765

Term3: -585.8304

Term4: +962.344736

Term5: +16,465.5174

Let me add them step by step.

Start with Term1 + Term2: -19925.384 -10640.1765 =-30565.5605

Add Term3: -30565.5605 -585.8304 ≈-31151.3909

Add Term4: -31151.3909 +962.3447 ≈-31151.3909 +962.3447 ≈-30189.0462

Add Term5: -30189.0462 +16,465.5174 ≈-30189.0462 +16465.5174 ≈-13723.5288.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in some of the computations. Let me recheck.

Wait, for term1: xi=51.5, (51.5-66.42)= -14.92, cube is (-14.92)^3=-3320.8973, multiplied by fi=6 gives -3320.8973 *6 =-19925.3838.

Term2: xi=57.5, (57.5-66.42)= -8.92, cube is (-8.92)^3=-709.3451, multiplied by 15 gives -10640.1765.

Term3: xi=63.5, (63.5-66.42)=-2.92, cube is (-2.92)^3=-24.4096, multiplied by 24 gives -585.8304.

Term4: xi=69.5, (69.5-66.42)=3.08, cube is 29.161952, multiplied by 33 gives 962.344736.

Term5: xi=75.5, (75.5-66.42)=9.08, cube is 748.4317, multiplied by 22 gives 16,465.5174.

Now sum all terms:

Term1: -19925.3838

Term2: -10640.1765 → total so far: -30565.5603

Term3: -585.8304 → total: -31151.3907

Term4: +962.3447 → total: -31151.3907 +962.3447≈-30189.046

Term5: +16,465.5174 → total: -30189.046 +16,465.5174≈-13723.5286.

So the total sum is approximately -13723.5286.

Now, the third moment (unstandardized) is this sum divided by N=100.

So third moment = -13723.5286 / 100 ≈-137.235286.

Wait, but wait: The formula for skewness is E[(X - μ)^3] / σ^3. So this is the third central moment divided by σ^3.

But wait, for a sample, sometimes it's multiplied by n/(n-1)(n-2) or similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if using the population formula, it's just the third central moment divided by σ^3.

Wait, let me clarify: the formula for sample skewness is often given by:

γ = [sum (fi*(xi - μ)^3)] / [n * σ^3]

But for grouped data, perhaps it's the same approach as individual data. So in this case, sum(fi*(xi - μ)^3) is the numerator, and since σ is computed as the population standard deviation (divided by n, not n-1), perhaps in this case we proceed as a population.

Wait, but in the question, it's the distribution of the data, so maybe it's treated as a population, not a sample. So we'd compute the third central moment as sum(fi*(xi - μ)^3) / N, and then divide by σ^3.

Wait, the formula for skewness is:

γ = [sum (f_i (x_i - μ)^3)] / (N * σ^3)

So in this case, sum(fi*(xi - μ)^3) is -13723.5286, N=100, σ≈6.97, σ^3≈6.97^3.

Compute σ^3: 6.97 *6.97 *6.97.

Wait, I know that 6.97^2 is approximately 48.5809. So 48.5809 *6.97 ≈ let's compute that.

48 *6.97 = 333.36

0.5809 *6.97 ≈4.045.

So total ≈333.36 +4.045 ≈337.405.

So σ^3 ≈337.405.

Now, the numerator is sum(fi*(xi - μ)^3) = -13723.5286.

So γ = (-13723.5286) / (100 * 337.405)

Compute denominator: 100 *337.405 =33740.5

So γ = -13723.5286 / 33740.5 ≈-0.4067.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

Compute numerator: -13723.5286.

Denominator: 33740.5.

So -13723.5286 / 33740.5 ≈ let's compute this division.

Let me compute 33740.5 *0.4 =13496.2.

So 0.4 *33740.5=13496.2.

Our numerator is -13723.5286, which is a bit more than 13496.2.

So 13496.2 is 0.4 times.

The difference is 13723.5286 -13496.2 =227.3286.

So 227.3286 /33740.5 ≈0.00674.

So total γ ≈- (0.4 +0.00674)= -0.40674.

Approximately -0.407.

Wait, but none of the options are exactly -0.407, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation somewhere.

Let me review the calculations again to check for errors.

First, compute sum(fi*(xi - μ)^3):

Term1: (51.5-66.42)= -14.92 → (-14.92)^3= -3320.8973 → 6*-3320.8973= -19925.3838
