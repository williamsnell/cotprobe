Okay, so I've got this question about muckraking journalism and the introduction of public relations in business. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history, but let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that muckraking was a type of journalism that exposed corruption and social issues. It was a big deal in the early 20th century. I think it was called that because the journalists were digging up dirt, like muck.

So the question is asking in which era this muckraking led businesses to adopt public relations widely. I guess businesses felt they needed to respond to all the negative exposure, so they started using PR to manage their image.

I'm trying to remember the different eras. The Progressive Era comes to mind. I think that was roughly from the 1890s to the 1920s. That's when a lot of reforms happened, and muckraking was part of that movement. Journalists like Ida Tarbell and Upton Sinclair were active then. They exposed things like child labor, poor working conditions, and corporate greed.

So businesses probably started using PR during this time to counteract the bad press. They wanted to look better and regain public trust. That makes sense because before this, companies might not have focused as much on their public image.

Looking at the options, option J is the Progressive Era, 1890-1920. That seems like the right fit. Let me just make sure the other options don't make more sense.

Option E is the Seedbed Era from 1900-1917. That's part of the Progressive Era, but maybe the broader period is better because muckraking started a bit earlier. Also, public relations probably became more widespread as the Progressive Era went on.

The Gilded Age was earlier, from 1870-1900, which I think was more about industrialization and the robber barons. Muckraking came after that.

The Roaring Twenties, option H, was the 1920s. I'm not sure if that's when PR started or if it was already established. Plus, the muckraking movement was in the Progressive Era, which ends around 1920.

The Great Depression and New Deal eras are later, so probably not the answer here.

So I think the correct answer is J, the Progressive Era.

The correct answer is J: The Progressive Era, 1890 - 1920.

During the Progressive Era, muckraking journalism gained prominence as journalists exposed social and corporate injustices, prompting businesses to adopt public relations strategies to manage their public image and counter negative perceptions. This period aligns with the rise of PR as a response to the scrutiny brought by muckrakers.
