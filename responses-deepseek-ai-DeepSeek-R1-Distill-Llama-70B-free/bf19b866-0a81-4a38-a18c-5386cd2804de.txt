Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a potato peeling solution is 2.56 M in NaOH, and we need to find out what weight percent this corresponds to. The formula weight of NaOH is 40.0 g/mole, and the density of the solution is given as 1.10 g/ml. The options are from A to J, each representing different percentages.

Hmm, I remember that molarity is moles per liter, and weight percent is the mass of solute divided by the mass of the solution, times 100%. So I need to convert the molarity into weight percent.

Wait, right. The formula for weight percent is (mass of solute / mass of solution) * 100%. So I need to find the mass of NaOH in a certain volume of the solution and then find the total mass of that solution to calculate the percentage.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Find the mass of NaOH in one liter of solution.
2. Calculate the total mass of the solution using density.
3. Compute the weight percent.

Starting with step 1. Molarity is 2.56 M, which is 2.56 moles per liter. The molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol. So moles multiplied by molar mass gives grams.

So 2.56 mol/L * 40.0 g/mol = 102.4 g/L. That means in one liter of solution, there are 102.4 grams of NaOH.

Wait, but wait. Is the solution's density given? Yes, 1.10 g/ml. But density is mass per volume, so for 1 liter, I can find the mass of the solution.

One liter is 1000 ml, right? So mass of solution is density * volume. So 1.10 g/ml * 1000 ml = 1100 grams. Oh wait, no, because 1 liter is 1000 ml, so 1000 ml * 1.10 g/ml is 1100 grams total solution mass.

So in 1100 grams of solution, there's 102.4 grams of NaOH. So the weight percent is (102.4 / 1100) * 100%.

Let me calculate that. 102.4 divided by 1100. Let's see, 102.4 / 1100 ≈ 0.09309, so 9.309%. Oh, so about 9.3% by weight.

Wait, let me double-check. Let's compute 102.4 / 1100. 1100 is 1.1e3. 102.4 divided by 1100: 1024/11000 is equal to approximately 0.093, so yeah, 9.3%.

Looking at the options, option J is 9.3% by weight. So would the answer be J?

But wait, let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the total mass of the solution. So for one liter, the solution's mass is density times volume. Volume is 1 L = 0.001 m³? No, wait, 1 L is 1 dm³, which is 1000 ml. So 1 liter is 1000 ml. So 1000 ml * 1.10 g/ml = 1100 g.

So in that 1100 g solution, 102.4 g is the NaOH. So (102.4 / 1100) * 100 = (1024 / 11000) * 100 ≈ (approx 9.3%).

So yes, that's 9.3% by weight. So the answer should be J.

To determine the weight percent of a 2.56 M NaOH solution, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mass of NaOH in 1 liter of solution**:  
   Molarity = 2.56 M = 2.56 moles/L.  
   Molar mass of NaOH = 40.0 g/mol.  
   Mass of NaOH = Molarity × Molar mass = \( 2.56 \, \text{mol/L} \times 40.0 \, \text{g/mol} = 102.4 \, \text{g/L} \).

2. **Calculate the total mass of the solution**:  
   Density of the solution = \( 1.10 \, \text{g/ml} \).  
   Volume = \( 1 \, \text{L} = 1000 \, \text{ml} \).  
   Total mass of solution = Density × Volume = \( 1.10 \, \text{g/ml} \times 1000 \, \text{ml} = 1100 \, \text{g} \).

3. **Calculate the weight percent**:  
   Weight percent = \( \frac{\text{Mass of NaOH}}{\text{Total mass of solution}} \times 100 \).  
   Weight percent = \( \frac{102.4 \, \text{g}}{1100 \, \text{g}} \times 100 \approx 9.3\% \).

Thus, the weight percent of the 2.56 M NaOH solution is approximately **9.3% by weight**. Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 9.3% by weight**
