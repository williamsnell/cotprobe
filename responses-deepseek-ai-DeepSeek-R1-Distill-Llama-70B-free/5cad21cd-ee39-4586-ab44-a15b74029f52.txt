Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the molarity of a sulfuric acid solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that 15.0 mL of H2SO4 is neutralized by 26.5 mL of 0.100 M NaOH. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form salt and water. Since H2SO4 is a strong acid and NaOH is a strong base, they should react completely.

Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, right? That means each molecule can donate two protons. So when it reacts with NaOH, which is a monobasic base (each molecule provides one hydroxide ion), the reaction should go like this:

H2SO4 + 2NaOH → Na2SO4 + 2H2O

Oh right, the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of H2SO4 reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. So the mole ratio is 1:2.

Now, I need to find the molarity of the H2SO4 solution. Molarity is moles per liter. So I think I should calculate the moles of NaOH used because I know its volume and concentration.

The volume of NaOH is 26.5 mL, which is 0.0265 liters. The concentration is 0.100 M, so moles of NaOH = Molarity × Volume = 0.100 mol/L × 0.0265 L.

Let me calculate that: 0.100 * 0.0265 = 0.00265 moles of NaOH.

But since the reaction ratio is 1 mole of H2SO4 to 2 moles of NaOH, the moles of H2SO4 must be half that. So 0.00265 / 2 = 0.001325 moles of H2SO4.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me double-check. Each H2SO4 provides 2 H+ ions, so each mole of H2SO4 needs 2 moles of NaOH. So yes, for every mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of NaOH are needed. Therefore, moles of H2SO4 = moles of NaOH / 2.

So that's 0.00265 / 2 = 0.001325 moles.

Now, the volume of H2SO4 solution used is 15.0 mL, which is 0.015 liters. So the molarity of H2SO4 is moles divided by liters.

Molarity = 0.001325 mol / 0.015 L.

Let me compute that. 0.001325 ÷ 0.015. Hmm. Let's see, 0.001325 divided by 0.015. Let me convert them to fractions to make it easier.

0.001325 is 1.325e-3, and 0.015 is 1.5e-2. So 1.325e-3 / 1.5e-2 = (1.325 / 15) × 10^(-3 +2) ) → 1.325/15 = 0.088333..., and 10^-1, so 0.088333... M.

Wait, that's approximately 0.0883 M. Let me check the options. Option H is 0.088 M. Close enough, considering significant figures.

But wait, let me go through the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Moles of NaOH: 0.100 M * 0.0265 L = 0.00265 moles.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.00265 / 2 = 0.001325 moles.

Volume of H2SO4: 15 mL = 0.015 L.

Molarity: 0.001325 / 0.015 = 0.0883 M. Yep, that's correct.

Looking at the options again. Option H is 0.088 M, which matches. So the answer should be H.

To determine the molarity of the H₂SO₄ solution, we start with the neutralization reaction:

\[
\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2\text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{SO}_4 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of H₂SO₄ reacts with 2 moles of NaOH. The problem states that 26.5 mL of 0.100 M NaOH is used to neutralize 15.0 mL of the H₂SO₄ solution.

1. **Calculate moles of NaOH:**
   \[
   \text{Moles of NaOH} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.100 \, \text{M} \times 0.0265 \, \text{L} = 0.00265 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Determine moles of H₂SO₄:**
   Since the reaction ratio is 1:2 (H₂SO₄:NaOH), the moles of H₂SO₄ are:
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{2} = \frac{0.00265}{2} = 0.001325 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Calculate molarity of H₂SO₄:**
   The volume of the H₂SO₄ solution is 15.0 mL, or 0.0150 L. Molarity is given by:
   \[
   \text{Molarity of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \frac{\text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4}{\text{Volume of H}_2\text{SO}_4} = \frac{0.001325}{0.0150} = 0.0883 \, \text{M}
   \]

Thus, the molarity of the H₂SO₄ solution is approximately **0.088 M**, which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
