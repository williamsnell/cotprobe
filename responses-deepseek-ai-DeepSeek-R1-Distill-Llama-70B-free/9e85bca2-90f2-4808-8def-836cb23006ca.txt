Question:

What is utility? What is marginal utility?

Options:

A: Utility is the measure of usefulness or pleasure. Marginal utility is the decrease in usefulness or pleasure as more units are consumed.
B: Utility is the quantity of a product. Marginal utility is the increase in quantity which a consumer gets from an additional unit of a specific good.
C: Utility is the power to satisfy a want. Marginal utility is the extra utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.
D: Utility is the duration of time a product can be used. Marginal utility is the increase in usage time with each additional unit consumed.
E: Utility is the measure of scarcity of a good. Marginal utility is the change in scarcity when one more unit of the good is produced.
F: Utility is the weight of a product. Marginal utility is the additional weight a consumer perceives when purchasing an extra unit of a specific good.
G: Utility is the power to make a good. Marginal utility is the extra power which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good.
H: Utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount of a good. Marginal utility is the satisfaction gained from the last unit consumed, holding the level of consumption constant.
I: Utility is the price of a good. Marginal utility is the increase in price which a consumer pays for an additional unit of a specific good.
J: Utility is the demand for a product. Marginal utility is the change in demand as the supply of a specific good increases.

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about utility and marginal utility. I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question is asking what utility is and what marginal utility is. The options are A through J, so I need to pick the right pair.

I remember that utility in economics is about the satisfaction or pleasure a consumer gets from a good or service. It's not about the actual usefulness in a practical sense, but more about how much it satisfies a want or need. So utility is a measure of satisfaction.

Now, marginal utility is a related concept. I think it refers to the additional satisfaction you get from consuming one more unit of a good. So it's the change in utility when you consume an extra unit. And I remember something about the law of diminishing marginal utility, where each additional unit gives less satisfaction than the previous one. So marginal utility decreases as you consume more.

Looking at the options:

Option A says utility is the measure of usefulness or pleasure. That sounds right for utility. Then marginal utility is the decrease as more units are consumed. Wait, but marginal utility is the additional utility from one more unit, which could be positive or negative. So if you consume more, marginal utility might decrease, but the option says it's the decrease in usefulness. Hmm, maybe, but let me check others.

Option B: Utility is quantity of product. No, that doesn't sound right. Utility is about satisfaction, not quantity.

Option C: Utility is the power to satisfy a want. That fits with what I remember. Then marginal utility is the extra utility from an additional unit. That sounds correct too. So C might be the right answer.

Option H: Utility is total satisfaction, and marginal is the last unit. That also sounds correct. Let me think. Total utility is the overall satisfaction from all units consumed, and marginal utility is the satisfaction from the last unit. So H could be correct as well.

Wait, the definitions I was thinking: utility can be total or marginal. So in C, utility is the power to satisfy a want, which is a bit abstract. While H defines utility as total satisfaction, which is more precise. Marginal utility in H is the satisfaction from the last unit, which aligns with the concept.

So now I'm a bit confused between C and H.

Let me think again. Option C says marginal utility is the extra utility from an additional unit. That's correct. Option H describes marginal utility as the satisfaction from the last unit, holding consumption constant. That's also correct. So both C and H have correct parts.

Wait, the question defines utility first. Option C says utility is the power to satisfy a want. That's a standard definition. Option H says utility is total satisfaction. So which is right?

Wait, in economics, utility is often used in two ways: total utility (the overall satisfaction) and marginal utility (the additional from one more unit). So the question is asking what utility is in general, not specifically total.

So the first part of each option is the definition of utility. So option C says utility is the power to satisfy a want, which is a standard definition. Option H says utility is the total satisfaction received, which is more about total utility than utility in general.

So the correct answer would be C. Because the question is defining utility, not total utility.

Wait, but sometimes utility refers to the total, and marginal is the extra. So maybe H is correct.

Wait, the first part of the question asks "what is utility?" So for example, in option H, utility is the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount of a good. That's total utility. So the question is about utility in general. So I think the first part of C is correct: utility is the power to satisfy a want.

So the correct answer is C.

Utility is a concept in economics that refers to the satisfaction or pleasure a consumer derives from consuming a good or service. It is often described as the "power to satisfy a want." Marginal utility, on the other hand, is the additional satisfaction a consumer gains from consuming one more unit of a good. It is the change in utility that results from the consumption of an extra unit.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: While it correctly states that utility is a measure of usefulness or pleasure, its definition of marginal utility as a "decrease in usefulness" is incomplete, as marginal utility can also increase or remain constant depending on the context.
- **Option C**: This option accurately defines utility as "the power to satisfy a want" and marginal utility as "the extra utility, or satisfaction, which a consumer derives from an additional unit of a specific good." Both definitions align well with standard economic concepts.
- **Option H**: While it correctly describes marginal utility as "the satisfaction gained from the last unit consumed," its definition of utility as "the total satisfaction received from consuming a certain amount of a good" refers specifically to total utility, not utility in general.

Given that the question asks for the general definition of utility, **Option C** is the most accurate and comprehensive choice.
