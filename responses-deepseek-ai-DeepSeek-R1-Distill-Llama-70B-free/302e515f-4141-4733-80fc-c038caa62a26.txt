Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about the component cost of preferred stock. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned in class. I think the component cost of capital is the cost that a company incurs when it issues a particular type of security. Since this is about preferred stock, I should focus on that.

The question gives me a few details. The preferred stock has a par value of $100. It just paid an annual dividend of $10 per share. Oh wait, so the dividend is $10 each year. The current market price is $96 a share. The company's marginal tax rate is 40%, which is combined federal and state. Also, they plan to keep their capital structure the same in the future.

I remember that the formula for the cost of preferred stock is a bit different because, unlike debt, the dividends on preferred stock aren't tax-deductible. Wait, no, wait. Actually, for preferred stock, the dividends are considered a cost of capital, but they aren't tax-deductible. So the tax shield applies to interest on debt but not to preferred dividends. So when calculating the cost of preferred stock, it's just the dividend divided by the market price.

But wait, no, the formula I think is Cost of Preferred Stock (r_p) = Dividend per share / Market price per share. That makes sense because the company is paying out dividends, and the cost is what it's effectively costing the company to raise that money. Since there's no tax deduction, we don't adjust it by the tax rate like we do for debt.

So let's plug in the numbers. The dividend is $10 annually, and the market price is $96. So that would be 10 divided by 96. Let me calculate that. 10/96 is approximately 0.104166... So that's about 10.4166%. Looking at the options, option E is 10.4%, which is very close. But wait, why would the tax rate be given then? Oh, because sometimes the formula might factor in the tax rate if there's some tax advantage. Wait, no, preferred stock dividends are not tax-deductible. So the tax rate shouldn't affect the cost of preferred stock.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the 40% tax rate is a red herring here. Because for debt, we have an after-tax cost because interest is tax-deductible. But for preferred stock, since dividends aren't tax-deductible, the cost is just the raw dividend yield, without any tax adjustment.

So the calculation is simply 10/96 = 0.104166, which is about 10.4%. So the closest option is E, 10.4%. 

Let me check the options again. Option A is 10%, which is close but not exact. Option E is 10.4%, which is exact. So the answer should be E. 

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the formula is expressed as (D + (P0 - Pn)/Pn) / (1 - T), but that's for when there's a buyback or something. No, wait, that's not right. For perpetuity, the cost is just D / P0, because the stock is assumed to have an infinite life and the dividend is constant. So yeah, it's definitely 10 / 96.

So the correct answer should be E, 10.4 percent.

The component cost of preferred stock is calculated using the formula:

\[
r_p = \frac{\text{Dividend per share}}{\text{Market price per share}}
\]

Here, the annual dividend per share is $10, and the current market price per share is $96. Plugging in these values:

\[
r_p = \frac{10}{96} \approx 0.104166 \, \text{or} \, 10.4166\%
\]

This is approximately 10.4%, which corresponds to option E. The marginal tax rate (40%) is irrelevant in this calculation because dividends on preferred stock are not tax-deductible, unlike interest on debt. Therefore, no tax adjustment is needed.

The closest answer is **E: 10.4 percent**.

Answer: E
