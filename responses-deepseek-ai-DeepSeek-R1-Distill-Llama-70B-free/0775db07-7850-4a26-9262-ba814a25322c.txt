Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about why the set of all real numbers under usual multiplication isn't a group. Hmm.

First, I remember that a group must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for every element. So I need to check each of these for the real numbers under multiplication.

Wait, real numbers under multiplication. Let me think. Closure would mean that when you multiply any two real numbers, the result is still a real number. That's true because multiplying reals gives a real. So closure is satisfied. So option G, which says the set is not closed, must be incorrect.

Associativity is next. Multiplication of real numbers is associative because (a*b)*c = a*(b*c) for all real a, b, c. So option A, which claims multiplication isn't associative, is wrong.

Identity element. The multiplicative identity is 1, right? Because any real number multiplied by 1 remains the same. So there's an identity element. Option F says identity doesn't exist, which is incorrect.

Inverses. Now, this is where I think the problem lies. For a group, every element must have an inverse in the set. But wait, in real numbers under multiplication, the inverse of a number a is 1/a, but this only works if a is not zero. Because zero doesn't have an inverse; 1/0 is undefined. So zero is a real number, but it doesn't have an inverse under multiplication. Thus, the set of all real numbers lacks inverses for at least one element. Which option covers this?

Looking at the options, option J says zero has no inverse. That's exactly the issue. So the real numbers under multiplication fail the group test because they don't have inverses for all elements, specifically zero.

Let me just glance through the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option B says negative numbers have no inverse. Wait, negatives do have inverses in multiplication. For example, -2 has inverse -0.5 because (-2)*(-0.5) = 1. So B is incorrect.

Option C says the set isn't finite. Well, whether it's finite or not doesn't affect group properties. There are infinite groups, like the real numbers under addition. So C isn't the reason.

Option D says multiplication isn't a binary operation. No, multiplication is a binary operation because it takes two elements and gives another. So D is wrong.

Option E is about distributive property. Wait, that's a property of fields, not groups. Groups don't require distributivity. So E is irrelevant here.

Option H says multiplication isn't commutative. Oh wait, real multiplication is commutative. a*b = b*a for all real a and b. So H is incorrect.

Option I says the operation isn't well-defined. But multiplication is perfectly well-defined for real numbers. So I is wrong.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is J: zero has no inverse.

The set of all real numbers under usual multiplication is not a group because not every element has an inverse. Specifically, the element zero does not have a multiplicative inverse, as division by zero is undefined. This violates one of the group axioms, which requires every element to have an inverse within the set. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Multiplication is associative for real numbers.
- **B**: Incorrect. Negative numbers do have inverses (e.g., the inverse of -2 is -0.5).
- **C**: Incorrect. The set being infinite does not disqualify it from being a group.
- **D**: Incorrect. Multiplication is a binary operation.
- **E**: Incorrect. The distributive property is not a group axiom.
- **F**: Incorrect. The identity element (1) exists for multiplication.
- **G**: Incorrect. The set is closed under multiplication.
- **H**: Incorrect. Multiplication is commutative for real numbers.
- **I**: Incorrect. Multiplication is well-defined for real numbers.
- **J**: Correct. Zero does not have a multiplicative inverse.

The correct answer is **J**.
