Question:

One of the two most common ingredients in medication designed for the relief of excess stomach acidity is aluminum hydroxide (Al (OH)_3, formula weight = 78 g/mole). If a patient suffering from a duodenal ulcer displays a hydrochloric acid (HCI, formula weight = 36.5 g/mole), concentration of 80 × 10^-3 M in his gastric juice and he produces 3 liters of gastric juice per day, how much medication containing 2.6 g Al(OH)_3 per 100 ml of solution must he consume per day to neutralize the acid?

Options:

A: 240 ml
B: 750 ml
C: 120 ml
D: 420 ml
E: 180 ml
F: 540 ml
G: 360 ml
H: 600 ml
I: 480 ml

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry isn't my strongest suit, but I'll give it a shot. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about neutralizing stomach acid with aluminum hydroxide. The patient has a certain concentration of HCl in their gastric juice, and we need to find out how much medication they should take daily. The medication contains a specific amount of Al(OH)3, so I think I'll need to figure out the moles involved in the reaction.

First, let's note down all the given data.

The patient's HCl concentration is 80e-3 M. Oh wait, 80 times 10^-3, which is 0.08 M. And he produces 3 liters of this per day. So the total moles of HCl in a day would be concentration times volume. But wait, volume is in liters, so that's easy.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles HCl = M * V = 0.08 mol/L * 3 L = 0.24 moles of HCl per day.

Now, I remember that Al(OH)3 is used to neutralize the acid. So I need the reaction between Al(OH)3 and HCl. Let me think about that. Aluminum hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce aluminum chloride, water, and maybe some hydrogen gas? Wait, no, wait. Let me write the balanced equation.

The reaction is probably:

Al(OH)3 + HCl → AlCl3 + H2O

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the stoichiometry. Let me balance it properly.

Al(OH)3 has Al, O, H. HCl has H, Cl.

The products are AlCl3 and H2O. So let's write it:

Al(OH)3 + HCl → AlCl3 + H2O

Now, balancing the equation. Aluminum is balanced (1 on each side). Let's look at Cl on the right: 3 Cl from AlCl3. So on the left, HCl must provide 3 Cl, meaning 3 HCl molecules.

So:

Al(OH)3 + 3 HCl → AlCl3 + 3 H2O

Wait, let me check. Al: 1 each. O: 3 on the left (from Al(OH)3) and 3 on the right (3 H2O). H: on the left, 3 from Al(OH)3 and 3*1 from HCl, total 6 H. On the right, 3 H2O gives 6 H (3*2). So hydrogens are balanced. Chlorine: 3 HCl gives 3 Cl, which matches AlCl3's 3 Cl. So the balanced equation is correct.

So from the equation, 1 mole of Al(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl.

So the mole ratio is 1 Al(OH)3 : 3 HCl.

Now, the moles of HCl the patient has is 0.24 moles per day. So we need to find out how much Al(OH)3 is needed to neutralize that.

Since 1 mole of Al(OH)3 neutralizes 3 moles of HCl, then the moles of Al(OH)3 needed would be (0.24 moles HCl) * (1 mole Al(OH)3 / 3 moles HCl).

Calculating that: 0.24 / 3 = 0.08 moles of Al(OH)3 needed per day.

Now, the formula weight of Al(OH)3 is given as 78 g/mol. So the mass needed is moles * molar mass.

0.08 moles * 78 g/mol = 6.24 grams of Al(OH)3 per day.

But the medication is given as 2.6 grams of Al(OH)3 per 100 ml of solution. So we need to find the volume that contains 6.24 grams.

Each 100 ml has 2.6 grams. So the number of 100 ml portions needed is 6.24 g / 2.6 g per 100 ml.

Calculating that: 6.24 / 2.6 = let's see. 2.6 * 2 = 5.2, which is less than 6.24. 2.4 * 2.6 = 6.24. Oh wait, 2.6 * 2.4 = 6.24. So that would be 240 ml.

Wait, no, wait: 2.6 grams per 100 ml, so how many 100 ml are in 6.24 g? Let me compute 6.24 /2.6 = 2.4. So 2.4 times 100 ml is 240 ml.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Alternatively, 2.6 g per 100 ml is equivalent to 26 g per liter, right? So 6.24 g would be (6.24 g) * (100 ml / 2.6 g) )= 6.24 * (100/2.6) ml.

Calculating 100/2.6 is approximately 38.4615. So 6.24 * 38.4615 ≈ let's see:

6 * 38.4615 is about 230.769, and 0.24 *38.4615 is about 9.23. So total around 240 ml.

So the volume needed is 240 ml, which is option A.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.

Wait, the balanced equation was 1 Al(OH)3 to 3 HCl, correct. So moles of Al(OH)3 is 0.24 /3 = 0.08, correct.

Mass of Al(OH)3 = 0.08 *78 = 6.24 grams, correct.

Medication is 2.6 grams in 100 ml, so 6.24 /2.6 = 2.4 *100 ml = 240 ml, yes.

Looking at the options, option A is 240 ml, so that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, the options include some other choices. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers.

Alternative approach: Maybe I made a mistake in the HCl moles.

HCl concentration is 0.08 M, volume is 3 liters, so moles HCl = 0.08 *3 =0.24, correct.

Molar ratio is 1:3, so Al(OH)3 is 0.24/3=0.08 moles. Correct.

Mass is 0.08 *78 =6.24 grams.

Med is 2.6 g per 100 ml. So 6.24 /2.6 =2.4, 2.4 *100=240 ml. So yes.

So the correct answer is A: 240 ml.

To determine how much medication the patient must consume daily to neutralize the excess stomach acidity, we start by calculating the total moles of HCl in the gastric juice. The concentration of HCl is given as \( 80 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \) (or \( 0.08 \, \text{M} \)), and the volume of gastric juice produced per day is \( 3 \, \text{L} \). The moles of HCl are:

\[
\text{Moles of HCl} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.08 \, \text{mol/L} \times 3 \, \text{L} = 0.24 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Next, we consider the reaction between aluminum hydroxide (\( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \)) and hydrochloric acid (\( \text{HCl} \)):

\[
\text{Al(OH)}_3 + 3 \, \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{AlCl}_3 + 3 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

From the balanced equation, 1 mole of \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \) reacts with 3 moles of \( \text{HCl} \). Therefore, the moles of \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \) required to neutralize \( 0.24 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{HCl} \) are:

\[
\text{Moles of Al(OH)}_3 = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{3} = \frac{0.24}{3} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The formula weight of \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \) is \( 78 \, \text{g/mol} \), so the mass of \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \) required is:

\[
\text{Mass of Al(OH)}_3 = \text{Moles} \times \text{Formula Weight} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \times 78 \, \text{g/mol} = 6.24 \, \text{g}.
\]

The medication contains \( 2.6 \, \text{g} \) of \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \) per \( 100 \, \text{ml} \) of solution. To find the volume of medication needed to deliver \( 6.24 \, \text{g} \) of \( \text{Al(OH)}_3 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{Volume of medication} = \frac{\text{Mass of Al(OH)}_3}{\text{Concentration of Al(OH)}_3} = \frac{6.24 \, \text{g}}{2.6 \, \text{g/100 ml}} = 2.4 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 240 \, \text{ml}.
\]

Thus, the patient must consume \( 240 \, \text{ml} \) of the medication per day to neutralize the acid. The correct answer is:

**A: 240 ml**
