Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this family therapy question. Let's see, the scenario is about a 14-year-old boy who's been arrested three times for shoplifting. His family's reaction is what's in question here.

The mother says he's just going through a phase, which doesn't seem very concerned. The father goes fishing on the court day, so he's not attending. The sister can't come because of homework. Hmm, so the family isn't really showing up for him, especially in a time when he's in trouble.

The question is from the perspective of structural family therapy, which I think focuses on the family's structure, boundaries, and how they interact. The options are various terms like closed, disengaged, enmeshed, etc.

I remember that in structural family therapy, a disengaged family is one where the members are emotionally distant and don't really support each other. They might not show much involvement in each other's lives. So in this case, the parents aren't taking the boy's issues seriously. The father is absent, and the sister isn't attending the hearing either. That sounds like they're not engaged with each other's problems.

Other options: Enmeshed families are too involved, which is the opposite. Triangulated would involve a third person getting drawn into a conflict, like maybe if the sister was mediating between the parents, but that's not the case here. Codependent is more about one person enabling another's behavior, which might not fit here. Closed and emotionally cut-off might relate, but I think disengaged is more about the lack of involvement.

So putting it all together, the family seems disengaged because they're not actively supporting the boy or showing concern. Each member is kind of doing their own thing without much regard for the others' issues.

The family in this scenario exhibits behaviors characteristic of a disengaged family system. The mother minimizes the boy's issues, the father is absent during a critical time, and the sister is unavailable. These actions demonstrate a lack of emotional support and involvement, aligning with the concept of a disengaged family in structural family therapy.
