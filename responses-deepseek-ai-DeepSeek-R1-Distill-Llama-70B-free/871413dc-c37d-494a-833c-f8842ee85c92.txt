Okay, so I've got this problem here: H(z) is the integral from 0 to 1 of e^(-z² t²) dt. And I need to find H'(1), which is the derivative of H with respect to z evaluated at z=1. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when you have a function defined as an integral with parameters, taking the derivative with respect to the parameter involves using Leibniz's rule. Leibniz's rule allows you to differentiate under the integral sign. The formula is something like the derivative of H(z) is the integral from a(z) to b(z) of the partial derivative of the integrand with respect to z, multiplied by the derivative of the upper limit minus the lower limit times the integrand evaluated at the lower limit. Wait, no, wait, actually, if the limits are constants, which they are here (0 to 1), then the formula simplifies.

Right, when the limits are constants, the derivative of H with respect to z is just the integral from 0 to 1 of the partial derivative of the integrand with respect to z, dt. So I don't have to worry about the other terms involving the derivatives of the limits because they're zero here.

So the integrand is e^(-z² t²). Let me compute the partial derivative of this with respect to z. The derivative of e^u is e^u times the derivative of u. Here, u is -z² t², so the derivative du/dz is -2 z t². So the partial derivative of the integrand is e^(-z² t²) * (-2 z t²).

Putting this together, H'(z) = integral from 0 to 1 of (-2 z t²) e^(-z² t²) dt. So that's the expression I get.

But wait, I need to evaluate this at z=1, so H'(1) = integral from 0 to 1 of (-2 * 1 * t²) e^(-1² t²) dt. Which simplifies to -2 times the integral of t² e^(-t²) dt from 0 to 1.

Hmm, okay, now I need to compute this integral. I'm trying to remember if there's a standard integral that looks like ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt. I know that ∫ e^{-t²} dt is the error function, but what about with t squared?

I recall that ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1 can be expressed using the error function or perhaps through integration by parts. Let me try integration by parts.

Let me set u = t, dv = t e^{-t²} dt. Wait, no, maybe a better substitution. Let's think: Let u = t, dv = t e^{-t²} dt. Then du = dt, and v is the integral of t e^{-t²} dt. Let me compute v.

The integral of t e^{-t²} dt is straightforward substitution. Let w = -t², dw = -2t dt. So ∫ t e^{-t²} dt = -1/2 e^{-t²} + C. So v = - (e^{-t²}) / 2.

Wait, but then integration by parts formula is ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du. So in this case, our original integral is ∫ t^2 e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1. Let me set u = t, dv = t e^{-t²} dt. Then du = dt, and v is as we found, - (e^{-t²})/2.

So putting it into the formula: [u v ] from 0 to 1 minus ∫ v du. So:

[ (t) * (-e^{-t²}/2) ) ] from 0 to 1 - ∫ (-e^{-t²}/2) * dt.

Simplify the first term: at t=1, it's (1)(-e^{-1}/2) = -e^{-1}/2. At t=0, it's 0 * ... which is 0. So the first part is (-e^{-1}/2 - 0) = -e^{-1}/2.

The second term is - ∫ (-e^{-t²}/2) dt = 1/2 ∫ e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1.

So putting it all together:

Integral from 0 to 1 of t² e^{-t²} dt = (-e^{-1}/2) + (1/2) ∫_0^1 e^{-t²} dt.

I know that ∫ e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1 is equal to (sqrt(π)/2) * erf(1), where erf is the error function. But maybe I don't need the exact expression because I can compute it numerically.

Wait, but the question might have an exact form or perhaps an approximate value. Let's see. So let's compute this integral numerically.

First, let me compute ∫_0^1 e^{-t²} dt. I remember that ∫_0^1 e^{-t²} dt is approximately 0.7468. Let me confirm this value. Yes, because the error function erf(1) is approximately 0.8427, and since ∫ e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1 is (sqrt(π)/2) * erf(1) ≈ (0.8862) * 0.8427 ≈ 0.7468.

So ∫ e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1 ≈ 0.7468.

So back to our integral:

Integral t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1 = (-e^{-1}/2) + (1/2)(0.7468).

Compute each part:

e^{-1} is approximately 0.3679. So -e^{-1}/2 ≈ -0.3679 / 2 ≈ -0.18395.

Then (1/2)(0.7468) ≈ 0.3734.

Adding these together: -0.18395 + 0.3734 ≈ 0.18945.

So the integral of t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to 1 is approximately 0.18945.

Now, going back to H'(1): H'(1) = -2 * 0.18945 ≈ -0.3789.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

We have H'(z) = -2z ∫ t² e^{-z² t²} dt from 0 to1.

At z=1, it becomes -2 ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt from 0 to1.

Which we found to be approximately -2 * 0.18945 ≈ -0.3789.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.3789, which would be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the integration by parts.

Alternative approach: Maybe there's a substitution that can be used. Let me see.

Another way: Let me think about the integral ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt. Let me consider substitution u = t, dv = t e^{-t²} dt, but I think that's the same as I did before.

Wait, perhaps another substitution. Let me think about the integral of t^2 e^{-t²} dt.

I also know that ∫ t^{2n} e^{-t^2} dt can be expressed in terms of the gamma function, but perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, considering that ∫ t^2 e^{-t^2} dt from 0 to 1 is equal to [t/2 e^{-t^2} - ∫ (1/2) e^{-t^2} dt ] from 0 to 1, which is the same as the integration by parts I did earlier. So yes, that part seems correct.

So the integral is indeed approximately 0.18945, so H'(1) is approximately -0.3789, which is option C.

To find \( H'(1) \) where \( H(z) = \int_0^1 e^{-z^2 t^2} dt \), we use Leibniz's rule for differentiation under the integral sign. Since the limits of integration are constants (0 to 1), the derivative of \( H(z) \) is given by:

\[
H'(z) = \int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( e^{-z^2 t^2} \right) dt.
\]

The integrand is \( e^{-z^2 t^2} \), and its partial derivative with respect to \( z \) is:

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( e^{-z^2 t^2} \right) = e^{-z^2 t^2} \cdot (-2zt^2).
\]

Thus, the derivative becomes:

\[
H'(z) = -2z \int_0^1 t^2 e^{-z^2 t^2} dt.
\]

At \( z = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
H'(1) = -2 \int_0^1 t^2 e^{-t^2} dt.
\]

To evaluate \( \int_0^1 t^2 e^{-t^2} dt \), we use integration by parts. Let \( u = t \) and \( dv = t e^{-t^2} dt \). Then \( du = dt \) and \( v = -\frac{1}{2} e^{-t^2} \). Applying integration by parts:

\[
\int t^2 e^{-t^2} dt = \left[ -\frac{t}{2} e^{-t^2} \right]_0^1 + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 e^{-t^2} dt.
\]

The first term evaluates to:

\[
\left[ -\frac{t}{2} e^{-t^2} \right]_0^1 = -\frac{1}{2} e^{-1} - 0 = -\frac{1}{2} e^{-1}.
\]

The second term involves \( \int_0^1 e^{-t^2} dt \), which is known to be approximately \( 0.7468 \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^1 t^2 e^{-t^2} dt = -\frac{1}{2} e^{-1} + \frac{1}{2} (0.7468).
\]

Substituting \( e^{-1} \approx 0.3679 \):

\[
-\frac{1}{2} e^{-1} \approx -0.18395, \quad \frac{1}{2} (0.7468) \approx 0.3734.
\]

Adding these:

\[
\int_0^1 t^2 e^{-t^2} dt \approx -0.18395 + 0.3734 = 0.18945.
\]

Finally, substituting this result into \( H'(1) \):

\[
H'(1) = -2 \cdot 0.18945 \approx -0.3789.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: -0.3789**
