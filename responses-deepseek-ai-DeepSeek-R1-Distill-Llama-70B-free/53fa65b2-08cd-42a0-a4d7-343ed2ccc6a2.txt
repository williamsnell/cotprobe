Okay, so I've got this problem about a generator, and I need to figure out the number of pole-face conductors in each pole of a compensating winding. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the given data. The generator is rated at 2,500 kW, 600 volts, and has 16 poles. The armature is lap-wound with 2,360 conductors. The pole faces cover 65% of the entire circumference. So, I need to find the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me recall what a compensating winding is. Oh right, it's used in DC generators to reduce armature reaction effects. The compensating winding is placed in the pole faces and has conductors embedded in the pole shoes. Its purpose is to neutralize the demagnetizing effect of the armature reaction.

But how do I calculate the number of conductors in each pole? I remember something about the number of conductors in the armature and the percentage coverage of the pole faces.

So, the generator has 16 poles. Each pole has a certain number of conductors. Since the pole faces cover 65% of the circumference, that probably means each pole's conductors are spread over 65% of the armature's circumference.

Wait, maybe the number of conductors per pole is related to the total number of conductors and the percentage coverage. Let me think: the total conductors in the armature (2,360) are distributed among the poles, but each pole only covers 65% of the circumference. So, for each pole, the number of conductors under that pole's face would be a fraction of the total.

But wait, the armature is lap wound. In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths equals the number of poles. So, A = P, where A is the number of parallel paths. So here, A = 16.

Each parallel path would have a certain number of conductors. The total number of conductors is 2,360. So, each parallel path has 2,360 / 16 = 147.5 conductors. Wait, that can't be right because you can't have half a conductor. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: 2,360 divided by 16... 16*147 is 2,352, so 2,360-2,352 is 8, so 147.5. Hmm, perhaps that's correct, but I'm not sure how that helps me with the compensating winding.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of conductors per pole in the armature. Each pole's face covers 65% of the circumference, so maybe the number of conductors under that face is 65% of the total conductors per pole.

Wait, but wait a second. The total number of conductors is 2,360. But for a lap winding, the number of conductors per pole is (total conductors)/(number of poles) * (number of conductors per segment). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about how the conductors are distributed around the armature.

The armature has 2,360 conductors. The circumference is divided into segments, each under a pole face. Since there are 16 poles, but each pole covers 65% of the circumference. Wait, no, that can't be right. If each pole covers 65%, but there are 16 poles, they can't each cover 65% because that would overlap a lot. Wait, perhaps each pole face covers 65% of the total circumference, but the way it's arranged, the 16 poles are placed around the circumference, each taking up 65% of the circumference. That doesn't make sense because 16*65% is way more than 100%. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Ah, wait. Maybe the pole face covers 65% of the 'pole span' or the space between two adjacent poles. Or perhaps the pole coverage is 65% of the total circumference per pole. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors under each pole face is 65% of the total armature conductors divided by the number of poles. Let me try that.

Wait, the total conductors are 2,360. So per pole, the number of conductors would be (2,360 / 16) = 147.5. Then, 65% of this is 0.65 * 147.5. Let me calculate that: 0.65 * 147.5 = 95.875. That's about 96 conductors per pole. But looking at the options, none of them are close to 96. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the compensating winding's conductors per pole are calculated based on the percentage coverage but per slot or something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the number of slots per pole.

Wait, the number of slots in the armature would be the same as the number of conductors, assuming each slot has one conductor. So, 2,360 slots. But wait, each pole has a certain number of slots under it. The number of slots per pole would be (number of conductors) * (percentage coverage) / 100.

Wait, but if each pole covers 65% of the circumference, and the total number of conductors is 2,360, then the number of conductors per pole face is 0.65 * 2,360 = 1,534. But that can't be right because each pole can't have more conductors than the total.

Wait, no, because the conductors are spread across all poles. So perhaps each pole has 2,360 / 16 = 147.5 conductors, and 65% of those are under the pole face for the compensating winding. So 0.65 * 147.5 = 95.875, which is about 96. But again, that's not matching any options. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the compensating winding uses a different approach. Oh, right, the compensating winding is placed in the pole shoes, and the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is equal to the number of armature conductors per pole multiplied by the percentage coverage. But wait, perhaps it's the number of slots per pole multiplied by the percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is the same as the number of conductors in the armature per pole multiplied by the percentage coverage.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to think differently.

The formula for the number of conductors in a compensating winding per pole is given by (Z * C) / (2 * P), where Z is the number of armature conductors, C is the percentage coverage, and P is the number of poles. Wait, is that correct? Or maybe it's (Z * C) / (P * 100). Hmm.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. Z is 2,360. C is 65%, so 0.65. P is 16.

So (2360 * 0.65) / 16 = ?

Calculating numerator: 2360 * 0.65 = 1,534.

Then 1,534 / 16 = 95.875. Again, that's around 96, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe it's (Z * C) / (2 * P). Let's try that.

2360 * 0.65 = 1,534. Divide by (2*16)=32. 1,534 /32 = 47.9375. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Z * C) / (A), where A is the number of parallel paths. Since A=16, 1,534 /16 = 95.875, same result.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Oh, wait, the question says it's a lap-wound armature. So the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles P, which is 16. So each parallel path has Z/A = 2360 /16 = 147.5 conductors. But since you can't have half a conductor, perhaps it's 147 or 148. Hmm, but I still don't see how that helps with the compensating winding.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors in each pole's compensating winding is equal to the number of conductors per parallel path multiplied by the percentage coverage.

So 147.5 (conductors per path) * 0.65 = 95.875, which again doesn't match any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors in the compensating winding is (Z * C) / (2P). Let me try that again. 2360 *0.65=1534, divided by (2*16)=32. 1534/32=47.9375. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Z * C) / (P). So 2360 * 0.65 =1534, divided by 16 is 95.875. Still not matching.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think if there's another approach. Maybe the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is equal to the number of conductors per pole in the armature, multiplied by the percentage coverage.

Wait, the armature has 2,360 conductors. Number of conductors per pole in the armature would be 2,360 /16 =147.5. So 65% of that is 147.5 *0.65 =95.875, again same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm calculating per pole in the armature, but the compensating winding is different. Oh, wait, perhaps the compensating winding uses as many conductors as the armature has per pole, so the number is 147.5, but since we can't have half, maybe it's 148, but that's still not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should consider the number of slots per pole. Each pole covers 65% of the circumference, so the number of slots per pole is 0.65 * total slots / number of poles. Wait, total slots are 2,360, so 0.65 * 2360 /16.

Wait, 2360 *0.65=1534. 1534/16=95.875. So 95.875 slots per pole. But that's the same number again. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is actually asking about the number of conductors in the compensating winding, which is a separate winding from the armature. Oh, right, the compensating winding's conductors are placed in the pole shoes, and their number depends on the armature's conductors.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is equal to the number of armature conductors per pole multiplied by the coverage. But that brings us back to the same calculation.

Wait, the options are all in single or low double digits, like up to 20. So maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let me think again.

Another way: the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is given by (Z * C) / (2 * A), where A is the number of parallel paths. Since A=16, so (2360 * 0.65) / (2 *16) = (1534)/32=47.9375. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (Z * C) / (P * 100) * something. Let me try (2360 * 65) / (16 * 100). That would be (153400) / 1600=95.875. Same as before.

Wait, maybe I should consider that in a lap winding, each conductor is part of two parallel paths. So maybe the calculation involves that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is the same as the number of coils per pole in the armature. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the number is simply (Z * C)/ (P * 100). So, (2360 *65)/(16 *100)= (153400)/(1600)=95.875. Again, same.

Wait, but all the options are way smaller than that. So I must be making a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the number of conductors in the compensating winding is per pole face, and each pole face has a certain number of conductors, but perhaps it's calculated differently.

Wait, another approach: the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is equal to the number of armature conductors per pole multiplied by the percentage coverage.

Wait, but that's what I did before.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the options again. They are all in single digits except for option I (12), J (14). So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Z * C) / (2 * P). Let me compute that: 2360 * 0.65 =1534. 1534/(2*16)=1534/32=47.9375. No.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding, and the compensating winding has as many conductors as the armature has per pole, but only for the percentage covered. So, perhaps it's (Z * C) / (P * 100) * something.

Wait, let's try this: The total number of conductors is 2360. Each pole's face covers 65% of the circumference, so the number of conductors under each pole face is 0.65 * 2360 =1534. Since there are 16 poles, each pole has 1534 /16 =95.875 conductors. Again same result.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe I should think in terms of the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding being half of that, or something.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Z * C) / (2 * P). So 2360 *0.65=1534. 1534/(2*16)=1534/32=47.9375. Still no.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors in the compensating winding is (Z * C) / (2P). So same as before. 47.9375, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think about the purpose of the compensating winding. It's placed in the pole shoes, and it carries a current that neutralizes the armature reaction. The number of conductors would relate to the number of armature conductors covered by each pole.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors per pole in the compensating winding is equal to the number of armature conductors per pole multiplied by the percentage coverage, but considering that each conductor in the compensating winding corresponds to two armature conductors (since each slot has two conductors, perhaps). Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (Z * C) / (P * 100) * (number of conductors per slot). But I don't have info on slots.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of conductors in the compensating winding is given by (Z * C) / (2 * P). Let me try that again.

Z=2360, C=65%=0.65, P=16.

So 2360 *0.65=1534.

Divide by (2 *16)=32: 1534/32=47.9375.

Wait, but the options are way smaller. So maybe I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, perhaps the lap winding has A=16 parallel paths, so the number of conductors per path is 2360/16=147.5. Then, the number of conductors per pole face in the compensating winding is 147.5 *0.65=95.875, but again, not matching options.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to find a formula or think differently.

Wait, perhaps the number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole is (Z * C) / (2 * P). Let me compute that again: 2360*0.65=1534. Divided by 32, 1534/32=47.9375. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is (Z * C) / (P). So 1534/16=95.875. Still no.

Hmm, maybe the answer is 95.875, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (Z * C) / (number of poles * number of parallel paths). Since number of parallel paths is 16, that would be 2360 *0.65 / (16*16)=1534/(256)=5.98, approximately 6. So option H is 6.

Wait, that makes sense. So 1534 divided by (16*16)=256 is about 5.98, which rounds to 6. So the answer would be H:6.

Wait, let me check that. Because if the number of conductors per pole is (Z * C) / (A^2), where A is the number of parallel paths. So 2360*0.65=1534. A=16, so 1534/(16*16)=1534/256≈5.98≈6. So option H:6 conductors.

That seems to fit one of the options. So I think that's the correct approach.
</think>

To determine the number of pole-face conductors in each pole of the compensating winding, we start with the given data:

- Total armature conductors, \( Z = 2360 \)
- Number of poles, \( P = 16 \)
- Percentage coverage of pole faces, \( C = 65\% = 0.65 \)

The compensating winding is designed to neutralize the armature reaction, and its conductors are placed in the pole shoes. The number of conductors in the compensating winding per pole can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Conductors per pole in compensating winding} = \frac{Z \cdot C}{P}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Conductors per pole in compensating winding} = \frac{2360 \cdot 0.65}{16}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2360 \cdot 0.65 = 1534
\]

Now divide by the number of poles:

\[
\frac{1534}{16} = 95.875
\]
