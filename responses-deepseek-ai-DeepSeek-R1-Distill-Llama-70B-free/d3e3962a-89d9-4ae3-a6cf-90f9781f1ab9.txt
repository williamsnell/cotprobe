Question:

This question refers to the following information.
In order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible, I have translated the term "Protoplasm," which is the scientific name of the substance of which I am about to speak, by the words "the physical basis of life." I suppose that, to many, the idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis, or matter, of life may be novel—so widely spread is the conception of life as something which works through matter. … Thus the matter of life, so far as we know it (and we have no right to speculate on any other), breaks up, in consequence of that continual death which is the condition of its manifesting vitality, into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which certainly possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.
Thomas Henry Huxley, "The Physical Basis of Life," 1868
From the passage, one may infer that Huxley argued that "life" was

Options:

A: a process that breaks down ordinary matter
B: essentially a philosophical notion
C: a term that has no physical basis
D: a concept beyond human understanding
E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter
F: a result of carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds
G: a supernatural phenomenon
H: subject to continual death and renewal
I: a complex chemical reaction
J: a force that works through matter

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Huxley's passage. The question is asking what Huxley inferred about "life" from the given text. Let me read the passage again carefully.

In the passage, Huxley mentions that he translated "Protoplasm" as "the physical basis of life." He says that the idea of a physical basis of life might be new to many because people often think of life as something working through matter. So, he's contrasting the common view with his own perspective.

He then talks about how the matter of life breaks down into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which have properties of ordinary matter. This suggests that life's physical basis is made of regular matter, not something special or supernatural.

Looking at the options now. Option E says "merely a property of a certain kind of matter." That sounds like what Huxley is getting at. He's saying life isn't some separate force or spirit but is based on physical matter. So life is a property of this particular matter (protoplasm).

Option J suggests life is a force working through matter, but that's the common conception Huxley is arguing against. So J is the opposite of what he's saying.

Option F says life is a result of those compounds, but I think it's more that life's basis breaks down into them, not that life results from them.

Option H mentions continual death and renewal. The passage does say that the matter of life breaks up due to continual death, which is part of its vitality. So H could be a contender, but I'm not sure if that's the main point Huxley is making about what life is.

Wait, the question is about what Huxley argued life was. So in the passage, he's saying that life has a physical basis, which is this protoplasm. He's emphasizing that life isn't separate from matter but is a product of it. So life is a property of this particular matter. That points more to E.

Option I talks about a complex chemical reaction. The passage doesn't explicitly mention reactions, just the breakdown into compounds, so maybe not I.

So putting it together, I think the answer is E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter.

The passage suggests that Huxley viewed life as having a physical basis, specifically tied to protoplasm, which he equates with ordinary matter. He argues against the common notion of life as a separate force working through matter, instead emphasizing that life's physical basis breaks down into common compounds. This aligns with the idea that life is a property of a specific kind of matter.

E: merely a property of a certain kind of matter.

Answer: E
