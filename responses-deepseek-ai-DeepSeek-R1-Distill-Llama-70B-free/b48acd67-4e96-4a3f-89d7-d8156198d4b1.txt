The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Here is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has "the world before her." Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the "early and improvident marriage," against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. "I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day," said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.
—Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890

Okay, so I've got this question about a passage from Jacob Riis's "How the Other Half Lives," and I need to figure out which group's situation is most comparable. Let me read the passage again to get a good grasp.

The passage describes a young woman working in a Broadway house's manufacturing department. She earns about three dollars a week. She pays $1.50 for her room, which is half her income. She can't afford lunch, so she only has one meal a day. The author is pointing out that her situation is so dire that it's almost a miracle she doesn't turn to something drastic, like an early marriage, just to escape her poverty. It also mentions that some women end up seeking domestic service because they're starving, and they can't afford to go hungry anymore.

So, the key points here are low wages, poor working conditions, inadequate food, and the struggle to survive. The women are in a tough spot, with limited options to improve their situation.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find a group that faced similar circumstances. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Jewish immigrants in New York in the 1880s. That's around the same time as the passage, which is 1890. Jewish immigrants often worked in sweatshops and faced similar poor working conditions. They had low wages and struggled with poverty, so this could be a match.

Option B: Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s. That's the Great Depression era. While they faced economic hardship, the context is different—industrial workers in manufacturing, but the time period is later. Plus, the auto industry might have had different issues, like unionization efforts.

Option C: Populist farmers in the 1890s. These were mainly rural workers dealing with agricultural issues, like debt and crop prices. Not directly comparable to urban, industrial workers.

Option D: Factory workers in the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution was in the 18th and early 19th centuries, primarily in Britain. The passage is from 1890, so later, but the working conditions—low wages, long hours, poor conditions—might be similar. So this could be a contender.

Option E: British soldiers in the 1800s. Soldiers have a different context; their situation is more about military life rather than economic struggle in the workforce.

Option F: Coal miners in the 1900s. They faced dangerous working conditions and low pay, but again, a different industry and time. The early 1900s is after the passage's time, but closer than some others.

Option G: Civil Rights activists in the 1960s. Their struggle was more about racial equality and social justice, not directly about economic working conditions.

Option H: Women suffragettes in the early 20th century. They were fighting for voting rights, so their issues were more about gender equality and political rights rather than economic survival.

Option I: American revolutionaries in the 1770s. They were involved in a war for independence, so not comparable in terms of working conditions.

Option J: Slaves in the antebellum South. Slavery is a unique situation involving forced labor without pay, which is more extreme than the passage describes. The women in the passage are exploited but not enslaved.

So, considering all the options, the closest comparisons would be between options A, D, and F. The passage is from 1890, so looking at the same time period: option A is 1880s, which is close. Factory workers during the Industrial Revolution (D) are from a bit earlier but had similar issues with low wages and poor conditions.

The women in the passage are in manufacturing, working for very low wages, struggling to afford even basic needs. This situation is reminiscent of the exploitation during the Industrial Revolution in Britain, where workers, especially women and children, worked long hours for little pay and in poor conditions. So comparing to factory workers in the Industrial Revolution makes sense.

Option A is Jewish immigrants in the same era, but the passage doesn't specify immigrants; it's about Broadway house workers, possibly native-born. But the conditions are quite similar. However, the broader context of the Industrial Revolution's factory system might be a better fit because it's a well-known example of such exploitation.

So I'm leaning towards option D: Factory workers in the Industrial Revolution. But I'm a bit torn between A and D. Option A is closer in time and location, but D is more about the working conditions regardless of the exact time period.

Wait, the passage is from 1890, which is post-Industrial Revolution in the US, but the Industrial Revolution started in Britain in the late 18th century and spread. So the US in the late 19th century was still experiencing industrialization, so the comparison makes sense.

Therefore, I think the answer is D.

The passage describes the dire working conditions and poverty faced by a young woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house in 1890. She earns very low wages, struggles to afford basic necessities like food and housing, and is driven to desperate measures to escape her situation. The key themes include exploitation, inadequate wages, and the struggle for survival.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Jewish immigrants in New York in the 1880s**  
  This group faced similar economic hardships and poor working conditions, particularly in sweatshops, and the time period is close to the passage. However, the passage does not specifically mention immigrants, making this less directly comparable.

- **B: Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s**  
  While this group faced economic hardship during the Great Depression, the context is different, focusing more on industrial unionization efforts rather than the specific struggles of low-wage workers in the 1890s.

- **C: Populist farmers in the 1890s**  
  These farmers dealt with rural economic issues like debt and crop prices, which are distinct from the urban, industrial struggles described in the passage.

- **D: Factory workers in the Industrial Revolution**  
  This group faced similar exploitation, with low wages, long hours, and poor working conditions. Although the Industrial Revolution began earlier, its legacy of worker exploitation aligns closely with the situation described in the passage.

- **E: British soldiers in the 1800s**  
  Soldiers' struggles were related to military life rather than economic hardship in the workforce, making this option less relevant.

- **F: Coal miners in the 1900s**  
  While coal miners faced dangerous conditions and low pay, this option is slightly outside the time period and industry of the passage.

- **G: Civil Rights activists in the 1960s**  
  Their struggles were centered on racial equality and social justice, not economic working conditions.

- **H: Women suffragettes in the early 20th century**  
  This group focused on gender equality and voting rights, not the economic survival described in the passage.

- **I: American revolutionaries in the 1770s**  
  Their context was war and independence, not labor exploitation.

- **J: Slaves in the antebellum South**  
  Slavery involved forced labor without pay, which is a more extreme and different context than the exploitation described in the passage.

The most direct comparison is to **factory workers in the Industrial Revolution**, as both groups faced exploitation, low wages, and poor working conditions. While Jewish immigrants in the 1880s (Option A) are close in time and location, the broader context of industrial exploitation makes Option D the best fit.

Answer: D
