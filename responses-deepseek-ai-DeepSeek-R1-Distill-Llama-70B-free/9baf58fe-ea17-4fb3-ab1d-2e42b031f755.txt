Question:

Characterize and differentiate capital widening from capi-tal deepening.

Options:

A: Capital widening is when more workers are provided with capital goods to increase their productivity, while capital deepening is when each worker is provided with a greater amount of capital goods to be more productive.
B: Capital widening refers to the increase in technology to boost productivity, while capital deepening is the investment in human capital to improve worker efficiency.
C: Capital widening is the practice of reducing capital investment to focus on labor-intensive production, while capital deepening involves increasing automation and capital intensity.
D: Capital widening is when more capital goods are provided to the same number of workers, while capital deepening is when the number of workers is increased without changing the amount of capital goods.
E: Capital widening occurs when the same amount of capital is spread over a larger workforce, leading to a potential decrease in productivity, while capital deepening is when additional capital is used to upgrade existing workers' tools and machinery.
F: Capital widening and capital deepening both refer to the addition of more capital goods to increase productivity.
G: Capital widening is when each worker is provided with a greater amount of capital goods to be more productive, while capital deepening is when more workers are provided with capital goods to increase their productivity.
H: Capital widening is the process of diversifying investments across different sectors to reduce risk, while capital deepening is the concentration of investments within a particular sector to increase specialization.
I: Capital widening is the expansion of capital to new geographic regions, while capital deepening is the enhancement of capital within existing production facilities.
J: Capital widening is when the overall investment in the economy increases without regard to the labor force, while capital deepening is when investment is focused on innovation rather than on increasing the capital per worker.

Okay, so I have this question about capital widening and capital deepening. I'm a bit rusty on economics terms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

From what I remember, both terms have to do with how capital is used in production to increase productivity. I think they're related to how capital is allocated per worker or across the workforce. Let me try to recall.

Capital deepening, if I'm not wrong, refers to each worker getting more capital goods. So like, instead of each worker having one tool, they have two or more. This should make each worker more productive because they have better equipment. It's about increasing the capital per worker.

Then there's capital widening. I think this is when the number of workers increases, but each worker gets the same amount of capital. So it's more about spreading the existing capital over more workers. Wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Or maybe it's adding more capital without changing the number of workers. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I remember a formula from the production function. The production function is something like Y = K^a * L^b. Capital deepening would mean increasing K relative to L, so each unit of labor has more capital. Capital widening would be increasing K and L proportionally, so the ratio remains the same. Or maybe it's increasing K without changing L, which would still be capital deepening. No, wait, if you increase K and L, keeping K/L the same, that's widening. So widening is when you have more workers and more capital, but the capital per worker doesn't change. Deepening is when capital per worker increases, so K increases more than L, or L stays the same.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says capital widening is providing more workers with capital, increasing productivity. Capital deepening is each worker getting more capital. That aligns with what I was thinking. So A seems correct.

Option G is the opposite: each worker gets more capital (which would be deepening) as widening, and more workers as deepening. So G is reversed, so probably wrong.

Option E says capital widening is spreading the same amount over more workers, possibly decreasing productivity. That doesn't sound right because adding more workers could mean more output, but maybe per capita productivity decreases. Or maybe not. Wait, if you have more workers but same capital, then each worker has less capital, which might lower productivity per worker. But I'm not sure if that's part of the definitions.

Option A seems correct based on my earlier understanding. Let me think about the other options to make sure.

Option B talks about technology and human capital. I don't think that's right because those are different concepts. Capital deepening is more about physical capital.

Option C is about reducing capital and automation. Doesn't fit.

Option D says capital widening is more capital to same workers, and deepening is more workers without changing capital. That sounds opposite to what I thought. Because if you have more capital to same workers, that's deepening, not widening. So D is wrong.

Option E: Widening spreads same capital to more workers, so each has less, maybe lowering productivity. Deepening is adding capital to existing workers. That sounds plausible, but I thought widening was adding capital and workers proportionally.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. Capital widening is when the amount of capital increases in the same proportion as the labor force. So if you have more workers and more capital, but the ratio K/L stays the same. That doesn't change the capital per worker, so productivity per worker (from capital) doesn't change. Capital deepening is when K increases more than L, so K/L rises, leading to higher productivity per worker.

So in that case, option A says capital widening is more workers with capital, which would mean same K/L ratio. Capital deepening is each worker getting more capital, which increases K/L. So A correctly describes both.

Option E says capital widening spreads same capital over more workers, which would lower K/L. That might not be correct because widening should be when K and L increase together, keeping K/L same. So E is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

Capital widening and capital deepening are two concepts in economics that describe how capital is allocated to increase productivity. Capital deepening refers to increasing the amount of capital per worker, which enhances productivity by providing workers with more or better tools and machinery. On the other hand, capital widening involves increasing the number of workers who have access to capital goods, while keeping the amount of capital per worker the same. This means that the capital-to-labor ratio remains unchanged, and productivity gains are primarily due to the expansion of the workforce.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that capital widening is about providing more workers with capital goods, while capital deepening is about increasing the amount of capital per worker. This aligns with the definitions of both concepts.
- **Option G** reverses the definitions, incorrectly describing capital widening as increasing capital per worker and capital deepening as adding more workers, which is not accurate.
- **Option E** suggests that capital widening spreads the same amount of capital over more workers, potentially lowering productivity. However, capital widening typically involves increasing both capital and labor proportionally, keeping the capital-to-labor ratio constant, rather than spreading the same capital over more workers.
- Other options either misdefine the concepts or conflate them with unrelated ideas, such as technology or human capital.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it accurately differentiates between capital widening and capital deepening.
