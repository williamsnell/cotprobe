Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and charges. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question says there's a charged cloud system creating an electric field near Earth's surface. A particle with a charge of -2.0e-9 C is placed in this field and experiences a downward electrostatic force of 3.0e-6 N. I need to find the magnitude of the electric field. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that electric field (E) is related to force and charge. Oh right, the formula is E = F / q. Wait, yes, because the electric field is the force per unit charge. So if I have the force and the charge, dividing them should give me the electric field.

Wait, but wait. The charge is negative here. Does that affect anything? Oh, right, because the question is asking for the magnitude of the electric field. So the sign of the charge would affect the direction, but the magnitude is just the absolute value. So I don't need to worry about the negative sign here.

So let's write down the values. The force F is 3.0e-6 N, and the charge q is -2.0e-9 C. But since we're calculating magnitude, I'll take the absolute value of both.

So E = (3.0e-6 N) / (2.0e-9 C). Let me compute that. Let's see:

3e-6 divided by 2e-9. Hmm, 3/2 is 1.5. And 1e-6 divided by 1e-9 is 1e3, because each exponent down reduces the exponent by 3. So 1e-6 / 1e-9 = (1e-6) * (1e9) )= 1e3. So 1.5 * 1e3 is 1.5e3 N/C.

Wait, wait, 1e3 is 1000. So 1.5 times that is 1500. So 1.5e3 N/C.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option B is 1.5e3 N/C. Option E is 1.0e3. So B should be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think: Electric field is force divided by charge. So yes, F is 3e-6, q is 2e-9. So 3e-6 / 2e-9 equals (3/2) * (1e-6 / 1e-9) = 1.5 * 1e3, which is 1500 N/C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Since the force is downward, and the charge is negative, the electric field direction is... Oh, but the question only asks for the magnitude, so direction doesn't matter. So yeah, 1.5e3 N/C is correct.

Looking back at the options, B is 1.5e3. So I think that's the right choice.

To determine the magnitude of the electric field, we use the formula:

\[
E = \frac{F}{q}
\]

Here, the force \( F \) is \( 3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{N} \), and the charge \( q \) is \( -2.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} \). Since the question asks for the magnitude of the electric field, we take the absolute value of the charge:

\[
E = \frac{3.0 \times 10^{-6}}{2.0 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
E = \frac{3.0}{2.0} \times \frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-9}} = 1.5 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the electric field is \( 1.5 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{N/C} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: \( 1.5 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{N/C} \)**.
