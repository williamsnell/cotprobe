Okay, so I need to find the supplement of a 40-degree angle. Hmm, what's a supplement angle again? I remember that supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Oh right, because they form a straight line. So if one angle is 40 degrees, the other angle that adds up to 180 would be the supplement.

Let me do the math. 180 minus 40 is... 140. So the supplement should be 140 degrees. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options: A is 100, B is 160, C is 140. Oh, there it is, option C. So the answer should be C.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up with complementary angles. Complementary add up to 90, right? So 40 plus complementary would be 50, which is option G. But the question is about supplement, so yeah, 140 is correct.

The supplement of a 40° angle is calculated by subtracting 40° from 180°, which equals 140°. Among the given options, 140° corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
