Okay, so I've got this question about Anorexia Nervosa and I need to figure out which of the options isn't a diagnostic feature. Hmm, I remember that Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight, leading to restricted food intake. 

The options are A to H. Let me go through them one by one.

A: Sleep disorders. I think I've heard that people with anorexia might have trouble sleeping, maybe because of stress or other related factors. So sleep disorders could be a related issue, but is it a diagnostic feature? I'm not sure.

B: Rapid heartbeat. Wait, anorexia often leads to physical complications. I think when you're underweight, your heart might not function properly. Rapid heartbeat might be a symptom, but I'm not certain if it's a diagnostic criterion.

C: High blood pressure. Hmm, I thought that people with anorexia might actually have low blood pressure because of being underweight. High blood pressure doesn't ring a bell as a common symptom. Maybe that's the one that's not a feature.

D: Obsession with physical activity. Oh yeah, hyperactivity is a thing. Some people with anorexia exercise excessively to burn calories. So this is definitely a diagnostic feature.

E: Significant Weight Loss. That's a key diagnostic feature. You have to be underweight, so significant weight loss is a must.

F: Depressive symptoms. I think many people with anorexia also experience depression. So this is a common comorbidity, but I'm not sure if it's a diagnostic criterion per se. Or maybe it's part of the specifier.

G: Fear of becoming fat. That's one of the core diagnostic criteria. The intense fear of gaining weight is central to anorexia.

H: Body Image Distortion. Yes, another core feature. They have a distorted perception of their body weight or shape.

Now, the question is which is NOT a diagnostic feature. So, looking back, high blood pressure (C) stands out. I think anorexia is more associated with hypotension (low BP) rather than high. So the correct answer would be C, high blood pressure.

The question asks which of the listed options is not a diagnostic feature of Anorexia Nervosa. Anorexia Nervosa is characterized by significant weight loss, a fear of becoming fat, body image distortion, and obsessive behaviors like excessive physical activity. Depressive symptoms and sleep disorders are commonly associated with the condition. Rapid heartbeat can occur due to physical complications, but high blood pressure is not typically associated with Anorexia Nervosa; instead, individuals often experience low blood pressure due to being underweight. Therefore, high blood pressure is the correct answer as it is not a diagnostic feature.

Answer: C
