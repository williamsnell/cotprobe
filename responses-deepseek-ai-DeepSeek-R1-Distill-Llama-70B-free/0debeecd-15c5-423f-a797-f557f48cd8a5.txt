Question:

Describe scheme, assimilation and accommodation as defined by Jean Piaget.

Options:

A: Schemes are learned responses to new stimuli. Assimilation is ignoring new environment. Accommodation is early infant behaviors.
B: Schemes are complex behaviors learned in adulthood. Assimilation is learning completely new responses to stimuli. Accommodation is ignoring new stimuli.
C: Schemes are innate reflexes that cannot be changed. Assimilation is adapting new stimuli to fit into existing schemes. Accommodation is the rejection of new stimuli that don't fit into existing schemes.
D: Schemes are mental representations of the world. Assimilation is the process of integrating new information into existing schemes without changing the schemes. Accommodation is the adjustment of existing schemes to incorporate new information.
E: Schemes are the only form of infant learning. Assimilation is the process of ignoring differences between stimuli. Accommodation is the process of retaining old behaviors in the face of new challenges.
F: Schemes are unconscious behaviors. Assimilation is changing previous behaviors to fit new environment. Accommodation is learning previously known methods.
G: Schemes are fixed psychological structures that determine behavior. Assimilation is the modification of the environment to fit pre-existing schemes. Accommodation is the alteration of schemes to adhere to societal norms.
H: Schemes are early behaviors such as sucking, looking, crying. Assimilation is when an individual uses previously learned responses to new stimuli. Accommodation is when an individual must learn new methods to cope with a new environment.
I: Schemes are the final stage of cognitive development. Assimilation is the refusal to alter cognitive structures in response to new information. Accommodation is the persistence of using known behaviors despite their ineffectiveness.
J: Schemes are temporary cognitive structures. Assimilation is the blending of new experiences with old memories. Accommodation is the discarding of obsolete schemes in favor of new ones.

Okay, so I have this question about Jean Piaget's concepts: schemes, assimilation, and accommodation. Hmm, I need to remember what each of these terms means. Let me think.

I remember that Piaget was a developmental psychologist who talked about how children construct their understanding of the world. He proposed that children go through stages of cognitive development. The terms in question are part of his theory about how children adapt and learn.

So, schemes—what are those? I think they're like mental frameworks or patterns that help organize information. They're the ways children think about and understand the world. For example, a baby has a sucking scheme, which is a reflex at first, but as they grow, their schemes become more complex. So schemes are like the building blocks of their cognitive structures.

Assimilation and accommodation are the processes by which these schemes change. Assimilation, if I recall correctly, is when a child takes in new information and fits it into their existing schemes. So they're adding new info without changing their current frameworks. Like when a kid sees a new animal and thinks it's a dog because that's their existing scheme for similar animals.

Accommodation is a bit the opposite. It's when the existing schemes don't fit the new information, so the child has to change their schemes to accommodate the new info. So, if the new animal doesn't fit the dog scheme, they might create a new category, like a different kind of pet. This process is more about changing the existing structures to fit new experiences.

Looking at the options:

Option D says schemes are mental representations, assimilation is integrating new info without changing schemes, and accommodation is adjusting schemes to fit new info. That sounds right.

Option C says schemes are innate reflexes and can't be changed. Wait, no, schemes can change as the child develops, so C is probably wrong.

Option H says schemes are early behaviors like sucking. That's part of it—early schemes are reflexes, but they expand beyond that. Assimilation is using old responses to new stimuli, which fits. Accommodation is learning new methods, which also fits. But the first part of H might be too narrow because schemes are more than just early behaviors; they evolve.

Option D seems to capture the broader idea. Schemes as mental representations, which they are. Assimilation as fitting new info into existing structures, and accommodation as changing the structures when necessary.

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is:

D: Schemes are mental representations of the world. Assimilation is the process of integrating new information into existing schemes without changing the schemes. Accommodation is the adjustment of existing schemes to incorporate new information.

Answer: D
