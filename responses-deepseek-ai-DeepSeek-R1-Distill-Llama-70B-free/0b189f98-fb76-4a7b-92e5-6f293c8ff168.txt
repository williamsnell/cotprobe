Question:

A defendant and his friend were down on their luck. They decided they would make some extra cash by robbing the local liquor store. The friend didn't like guns and decided to use a toy gun, which looked like a real gun, but only shot water. The defendant was aware that the gun was not real. Their plan fixed, they walked into the liquor store late one afternoon when few customers were in the store. The friend produced the toy pistol and pointed it at the customers and the clerk. The defendant ordered everyone to the floor, and the clerk began to rummage behind the counter for the key to the register. While his head was ducked, the clerk pulled a shotgun from behind the counter and fired it at the defendant and his friend. The defendant dived to the side, but his friend was shot and killed. If the defendant is subsequently charged with his friend's death he should be found

Options:

A: guilty of felony murder.
B: not guilty, because the clerk was justified in killing the friend.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill his friend.
D: guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon.
E: guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
F: guilty of second degree murder.
G: guilty of voluntary manslaughter.
H: guilty of first degree murder.
I: guilty, because the defendant was involved in the commission of a felony when his friend was killed.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with felony murder. Okay, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal law, but I'll try to think it through.

The scenario is about a defendant and his friend who decide to rob a liquor store. The friend uses a toy gun that looks real but only shoots water. The defendant knows it's not a real gun. They go into the store, the friend points the toy pistol at people, and the defendant orders everyone to the floor. The clerk, while getting the key, grabs a shotgun and shoots the friend, killing him. Now, the defendant is charged with his friend's death. The question is about whether he's guilty and under what charge.

First, I need to recall the felony murder rule. From what I remember, felony murder is when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the defendant can be held liable even if the death wasn't intentional. The idea is that the felony is so dangerous that any death resulting from it makes the participants guilty of murder.

But wait, there are some exceptions and specific rules here. I think the felony murder rule applies when the death is a foreseeable result of the felony. Also, the "merger rule" might come into play, where if the underlying felony is an assault, it might merge with the murder charge, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

In this case, the underlying felony is robbery. Robbery is a felony, so that's a good starting point. The friend was using a toy gun, but it looked real. So, the victims would reasonably believe it's a real gun, which is why the clerk reacted by shooting.

Now, the clerk shot and killed the friend. The question is whether the defendant can be held liable for the friend's death. Under the felony murder doctrine, all participants in the felony can be held responsible for deaths that occur during the commission of the crime, even if it's a co-felon who dies.

Wait, but I remember something about the "deadly force in self-defense" affecting this. If the clerk was justified in using deadly force against the friend because he reasonably believed there was an imminent threat, then maybe that affects the felony murder charge. But I'm a bit confused about that.

Alternatively, I think that under the felony murder rule, it doesn't matter who caused the death; even if a third party (like the clerk) kills a co-felon, the other participants can still be held liable. Because the death occurred during the commission of the felony, which was inherently dangerous.

Looking at the options:

Option A: guilty of felony murder. That would fit if the felony murder rule applies here.

Option B: Not guilty because the clerk was justified. But I don't think the clerk's justification would negate the felony murder charge because the felony was still being committed, making the death a foreseeable consequence.

Option C: Not guilty because no intent to kill. But felony murder doesn't require intent; it's about the death occurring during a felony.

Option D: guilty because a felon can be convicted of a co-felon's murder. That sounds like the felony murder rule.

Option E: Involuntary manslaughter. That's a lower charge, but I don't think it applies here because the felony murder rule would take precedence.

Option I: guilty because involved in a felony when friend was killed. That also aligns with felony murder.

Wait, so what's the exact rule here? I think the key point is that the defendant and his friend were committing a robbery, a felony. During the commission of that felony, a death occurred (the friend's death by the clerk). The clerk's action was in response to the robbery. So, under the felony murder rule, the defendant can be held responsible for the death, even though the clerk pulled the trigger.

But wait, the clerk's actions might be considered a justifiable homicide. If the clerk was legally justified in using deadly force, does that affect the felony murder charge? I think some jurisdictions have rules that if the killing was done by a third party in self-defense, the felony murder charge might not apply. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the "felony murder" applies regardless of who actually caused the death, as long as it's in furtherance of the felony. So, the fact that the clerk shot the friend doesn't break the chain of causation. The robbery created the situation where the clerk felt the need to use deadly force.

So, looking back at the options, D says guilty because a felon can be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. That seems accurate because the defendant was part of the felony, and the friend was also a participant, but the death is still chargeable as murder under the felony murder rule.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the friend was the one with the toy gun, and the clerk aimed at both the defendant and the friend. The friend was killed, but the defendant wasn't. So, the death was of the co-felon. So, under the felony murder rule, the defendant can be guilty of murder for the death of his co-felon.

So, the correct answer seems to be either A, D, or I. Let me think again:

Option A: guilty of felony murder. That's straightforward.

Option D: guilty because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. That's a more specific statement, which is correct under the felony murder rule.

Option I: guilty because involved in a felony when friend was killed. Also correct, but perhaps less specific than D.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the felony murder rule applies when the death is caused by a co-felon, but if it's caused by a third party (like the clerk), the rule might not apply. Or does it still apply because the third party's action was a foreseeable consequence of the felony?

I think the traditional felony murder rule includes deaths caused by any person, including third parties, as long as it's during the commission of the felony and a natural and probable consequence. So, the clerk's action was a direct response to the robbery, which the defendant was committing. Therefore, the defendant can still be held liable.

So, the defendant is guilty of felony murder, which would make option A correct. But looking at the options again, option D says "guilty because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon." That's a bit different. Wait, the co-felon was the friend, who was killed. So, the defendant is a felon (committing robbery) and the victim is a co-felon. So, under the felony murder rule, the defendant can be convicted of the murder of his co-felon.

So, both A and D are pointing towards the same concept. But the felony murder rule would make the defendant guilty of murder, so A would be the charge.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is more precise because it's about the murder of a co-felon, which is a specific application of the felony murder rule.

Wait, but the question is about what the defendant is charged with. The options include "guilty of felony murder" (A) and "guilty because a felon may be convicted..." (D). So, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about another angle: the "felony murder" charge requires that the death occurs during the commission of the felony and that the felony is inherently dangerous. Robbery is a felony, and it's dangerous, so the felony murder applies.

So, the answer should be A: guilty of felony murder.

Wait, but another point: the friend used a toy gun, but the defendant knew it wasn't real. Does that affect the felony murder charge? I don't think so, because the robbery was still being committed, and the use of what appears to be a firearm (even if it's fake) in a robbery constitutes the felony. The fact that the gun wasn't real might affect the robbery charge in terms of whether it's first or second degree, but for felony murder, the underlying felony is still robbery, so the rule applies.

So, the defendant is guilty of felony murder because the death occurred during the commission of the robbery, which is a felony. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D says "guilty, because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon." That's a specific application, so perhaps that's the intended correct answer. Or is D a trick? Because in some cases, the death of a co-felon is treated differently.

Wait, I think the key here is that the felony murder rule applies regardless of who causes the death, as long as it's in the course of the felony. So, if the clerk, a third party, kills the co-felon, the defendant is still guilty under felony murder.

Thus, the correct answer is A: guilty of felony murder.

But I'm a bit torn between A and D. Let me check what each option says.

Option A: guilty of felony murder. That's the general rule.

Option D: guilty because a felon may be convicted of the murder of a co-felon. That's a specific scenario where the victim is a co-felon.

I think both A and D are correct statements, but the question is about the charge. So, the defendant would be charged with felony murder, making A the correct answer. Alternatively, D is a correct statement of law, but the charge is felony murder.

Wait, perhaps D is more accurate because it's about the murder of a co-felon. But the charge is still felony murder, so the answer would be A.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is A.

The scenario involves a defendant and his friend committing a robbery, during which the friend is killed by a clerk who used deadly force in response to the perceived threat. The question revolves around whether the defendant can be held liable for the friend's death under the felony murder rule.

The felony murder rule applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, and the defendant can be held liable regardless of intent or who caused the death. In this case, the underlying felony is robbery, which is inherently dangerous. The friend's death, caused by the clerk, was a foreseeable consequence of the robbery, as the clerk's actions were a direct response to the perceived threat posed by the robbery.

Although the friend used a toy gun, the robbery was still being committed, and the use of a toy gun that appeared real constitutes the felony. The clerk's justification for using deadly force does not negate the application of the felony murder rule, as the death occurred during the commission of the felony.

Option A states "guilty of felony murder," which aligns with the application of the felony murder rule in this scenario. Option D, while correct as a statement of law, is less specific to the charge. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of felony murder.

Answer: A
