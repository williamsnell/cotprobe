Question:

A nephew inherited a large parcel of unimproved land from his uncle. In need of cash, the nephew decided to sell the parcel. He contacted a real estate agent in the area about listing the parcel for sale. The nephew and the agent entered into a valid written contract whereby the agent promised to undertake best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel. The contract also provided that the agent was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent succeeded in finding a buyer for the parcel. The agent notified the nephew that he had found a developer who wanted to purchase the parcel for $500,000. The agent handed the nephew a real estate sales contract, signed by the developer, in which the developer agreed to pay $500,000 for the purchase of the parcel. The nephew then signed the agreement himself. However, before consummation of the sale and transfer of title, the developer, without cause, repudiated the contract. Despite the agent's insistence, the nephew refused to either sue the developer to enforce the land sale contract or pay the agent his commission. If the agent sues the nephew for breach of the brokerage agreement, which of the following, if anything, is the agent's proper measure of recovery?

Options:

A: Nothing, because the nephew did not breach the brokerage agreement.
B: $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for $500,000, because all conditions precedent to the nephew's duty to pay the commission were substantially fulfilled when the nephew and the developer entered into the land sale contract.
C: $10,000, as a partial commission due to the agent's work done before the sale was cancelled.
D: $12,500, or half the commission, because the sale reached the halfway point when the nephew and the developer signed the contract.
E: Nothing, because as a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the nephew and the developer, the agent can enforce the contract only against the developer, but not against the nephew.
F: $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$500,000, because fulfillment of the consummation condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.
G: $25,000, because the agent provided a buyer and thus fulfilled his part of the contract.
H: Nothing, because the sale did not go through and hence no commission is due.
I: Nothing, because the consummation condition has not been fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal to sue the developer will not excuse that condition.
J: $25,000, because the agent upheld his end of the contract in making his best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel.

Okay, so I have this question about real estate law, specifically dealing with brokerage agreements and commissions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that a nephew inherited land and wants to sell it. He hires a real estate agent under a written contract. The agent's job is to use best efforts to find a buyer. The commission is 5% on the gross sale price, but only after the sale is consummated and title is transferred. So, the agent finds a buyer who offers $500k. The nephew and the buyer sign the sales contract, but then the buyer backs out without cause. The nephew refuses to sue the buyer or pay the commission.

The question is asking what the agent can recover if he sues the nephew for breach of the brokerage agreement. The options are A to J, each suggesting different outcomes.

First, I need to understand the terms of the brokerage agreement. The agent's commission is contingent upon the sale being consummated. So, if the sale doesn't go through, does the agent still get paid?

In real estate, typically, a broker's commission is earned when they produce a ready, willing, and able buyer. But sometimes, the contract might specify that the commission is only due upon closing. Here, the contract says the agent is paid "following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title." So, the commission is conditioned on the sale being completed.

In this case, the agent found a buyer, the nephew accepted the offer by signing the contract, but then the buyer repudiated the deal. The nephew didn't go through with the sale, so the condition for paying the commission wasn't met.

So, looking at the options:

Option A says the agent gets nothing because there was no breach. But the nephew didn't breach; he just didn't fulfill the condition. So maybe A is possible, but let me check others.

Option B suggests the agent gets the full commission because the conditions were substantially fulfilled when the contract was signed. But the condition was consummation, which didn't happen. So B might not be correct.

Option C: $10k as partial. But the contract was for 5%, so partial might not be due unless the contract allows it, which it doesn't seem to.

Option D: Half commission. Again, unless the contract specifies, which it doesn't, so likely not.

Option E: Agent can't sue nephew because he's a third-party beneficiary of the buyer contract. That doesn't make sense because the brokerage agreement is between agent and nephew. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Agent gets commission because the condition was prevented by an event beyond control. The buyer backing out is a failure of the buyer, which is beyond the agent's control. So maybe this applies. But does the law allow the agent to recover in such cases?

Option G: Agent gets commission because he found a buyer. But again, the condition was consummation. So unless the agent can argue that the nephew's refusal to enforce is a breach, but the nephew isn't obligated to sue the buyer; the contract just requires the sale to go through.

Option H: No commission because sale didn't happen. That aligns with the contract terms.

Option I: No commission because the condition wasn't met, and the nephew not suing doesn't change that. So the condition is a condition precedent, and it wasn't fulfilled.

Option J: Agent gets commission because he did his part. But the commission is contingent on the sale, so maybe no.

So, the key here is whether the agent's commission is due upon producing a buyer or upon the sale closing. The contract says upon closing, so even though the agent did his part, if the sale doesn't close, no commission.

But wait, sometimes the law says that if the buyer is ready, willing, and able, and the seller breaches, the broker can still get the commission. But in this case, the buyer breached, not the seller. So the nephew didn't breach the sale contract; the buyer did.

Wait, but the agent's agreement is with the nephew, not the buyer. So the agent is suing the nephew for breach of their agreement. The agreement says the agent gets paid upon sale. So if the sale doesn't happen, the condition isn't met, so no commission.

But what about when the failure to close is due to the buyer's breach? Does that affect the agent's right to commission? I'm trying to recall. In some cases, the commission is due if the agent procures a buyer who is ready, willing, and able, even if the sale doesn't close because of the seller's actions. But if the buyer is the one who breaches, and the seller is willing to go through, maybe the agent still gets the commission because the seller is at fault by not enforcing the contract.

Wait, in this case, the nephew refused to sue the developer. So the nephew could have enforced the sale but chose not to. Does that make the nephew in breach of the brokerage agreement?

The brokerage agreement requires the agent to use best efforts, which he did. The commission is due upon closing. But if the closing didn't happen because the nephew refused to enforce, perhaps the nephew is in breach of some implied duty. Or maybe the agent can argue that the condition (closing) was frustrated by the nephew's actions, so the condition is excused.

Alternatively, in some jurisdictions, if the seller's voluntary act prevents the closing (like refusing to sue), then the seller is considered to have breached the brokerage agreement, and the agent can recover the commission.

So, in this scenario, the agent found a buyer, the nephew agreed, but then the buyer backed out. If the nephew doesn't sue to enforce, can the agent still claim the commission?

Hmm, I think the general rule is that the agent must prove that the sale was completed or that the seller's actions prevented it. If the seller's inaction (not suing) causes the sale to fail, does that mean the seller is liable for the commission?

I'm trying to remember the concept of "procuring cause." The agent is the procuring cause if their efforts led directly to the sale. But if the sale doesn't close, does that affect it?

Wait, the agent's contract is with the nephew, not the buyer. So the agent's right to the commission depends on the terms of that contract. Here, the contract says commission is paid upon closing. So unless the contract is breached by the nephew, the agent can't get the commission.

But the nephew didn't breach the brokerage agreement. The agreement was to pay upon closing. The nephew didn't cause the closing not to happen; the buyer did. So the condition wasn't met, so no commission.

Wait, but if the buyer breached, and the nephew could have enforced the contract but didn't, does that mean the nephew is in breach of the brokerage agreement? Or is the nephew allowed to choose not to pursue the sale?

I think the nephew isn't required to enforce the sale contract. His obligation under the brokerage agreement is to pay the commission upon closing. If the closing doesn't happen due to buyer's breach, and the nephew doesn't enforce, the agent can't get the commission because the condition wasn't met.

So looking back at the options, option I says nothing because the condition wasn't fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal doesn't excuse it. That makes sense. Alternatively, option F says the condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control, so the agent can recover. But does that apply here?

Wait, in contract law, if a condition is prevented by the action of one party, that party can't take advantage of the failure of the condition. So if the nephew's inaction (not suing the buyer) caused the condition (closing) not to occur, then the condition is deemed fulfilled. So the agent could argue that the nephew's failure to enforce the sale contract prevented the condition, so the agent is entitled to the commission.

But I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might hold that the agent can recover if the seller's voluntary act prevents the sale. But others might say that the risk of the buyer's breach is on the agent unless the agent has a guarantee.

Wait, the agent's agreement is to use best efforts, but not to guarantee a sale. So if the agent finds a buyer who backs out, the agent doesn't get paid unless the contract provides otherwise.

In this case, the contract says payment is upon closing. So unless the nephew's action (not suing) constitutes a breach of the brokerage agreement, the agent can't recover.

Alternatively, the agent might argue that the nephew's refusal to sue the buyer amounts to a breach because it prevented the sale from going through, thus preventing the agent from earning his commission. But I think the nephew isn't obligated to sue the buyer; it's the nephew's decision whether to enforce the sale contract.

So, the condition wasn't met because the sale didn't close, and the nephew didn't breach any duty under the brokerage agreement. Therefore, the agent can't recover the commission.

Looking at the options, option I says nothing because the condition wasn't fulfilled, and the nephew not suing doesn't change that. So I think option I is correct. Alternatively, option F says the agent can recover because the condition was prevented by an event beyond his control. But is the nephew's refusal to sue considered an event beyond the agent's control? Or is it the nephew's own action, which might make him responsible.

Wait, under the doctrine of prevention, if a party's action prevents the fulfillment of a condition, that party can't benefit from the non-occurrence. So if the nephew's refusal to sue the buyer (a third party) prevented the condition (sale), does that mean the condition is considered fulfilled for the purposes of the agent's commission?

I'm a bit confused here. The nephew's refusal to enforce the sale against the buyer might be seen as an act that prevented the sale from closing. But the buyer's breach is the initial cause. However, the nephew's inaction could be a factor.

If the agent can argue that the nephew's inaction was a breach of the brokerage agreement, then maybe the agent can recover. But the brokerage agreement doesn't require the nephew to enforce the sale; it only requires him to pay upon closing.

So, perhaps the correct answer is that the agent cannot recover because the condition wasn't met, and the nephew didn't breach any obligation. So option I or H.

Option I says the condition hasn't been fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal doesn't excuse it. So the agent gets nothing.

Option H says the sale didn't go through, so no commission.

So, between H and I. Both seem similar, but I think the reasoning is that the condition precedent (closing) wasn't met, so no commission. So the correct answer would be either H or I.

Wait, option F says the agent can recover because the condition was prevented by an event beyond his control. The developer's repudiation was beyond the agent's control, but the nephew's refusal to sue is the nephew's action. So perhaps the agent can argue that the nephew's inaction prevented the condition, so the agent should get the commission.

In that case, option F would be the answer.

I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the rules again. The general rule is that a broker's commission is due when the broker procures a ready, willing, and able buyer, even if the sale doesn't close because of the seller's actions. But if the buyer is the one who backs out, and the seller is willing but the buyer isn't, then the commission isn't due unless the seller's actions prevented the sale.

In this case, the seller (nephew) didn't cause the buyer to back out; the buyer did so without cause. The nephew then chose not to enforce the contract. Does that make the nephew liable for the commission?

I think the key is whether the agent can argue that the nephew's failure to enforce the sale contract constitutes a breach of the brokerage agreement. The brokerage agreement requires the agent to find a buyer, which he did, but the commission is contingent on the sale closing. If the sale doesn't close due to the buyer's breach, and the seller doesn't enforce, then the condition isn't met, so no commission.

Alternatively, some courts might hold that the seller's failure to take legal action to enforce the sale doesn't relieve the seller of the obligation to pay the commission because the agent has already earned it by procuring the buyer.

Wait, but the contract explicitly states that the commission is due upon closing. So unless the agent can argue that the nephew's actions prevented the closing, thereby making the nephew responsible, he can't get the commission.

So, if the nephew's refusal to sue the buyer is a breach, then the agent can recover. But if the nephew isn't obligated to sue, then it's not a breach.

I think the nephew isn't obligated to sue. So the agent can't recover. Therefore, the answer would be H or I.

But another angle: in some jurisdictions, when a seller refuses to consummate a transaction after the buyer breaches, the broker may still be entitled to a commission because the broker has done everything required under the contract, and the failure to close is due to the seller's inaction.

Wait, no, because the commission is tied to the closing. So unless the contract is breached by the seller, the commission isn't due.

In this case, the nephew didn't breach the brokerage agreement. He didn't refuse to sell; the buyer refused to buy. So the condition wasn't met through no fault of the nephew, so no commission.

So, the correct answer is H: Nothing, because the sale didn't go through, hence no commission is due.

Alternatively, some might argue that the agent is entitled to the commission because he procured a buyer, and the nephew's refusal to enforce doesn't affect that. But I think that's not the case because the contract ties payment to closing.

Wait, let me think of a case where the seller backs out. If the seller breaches, the agent can recover. But here, the buyer breached, and the seller didn't enforce. So the agent might argue that the seller's inaction caused the sale not to close, thus the commission should be paid.

But under the brokerage agreement, the agent's commission is conditioned on the sale. So unless the seller's inaction is a breach, the agent can't recover.

I think the correct answer is that the agent cannot recover because the condition wasn't met, and the nephew didn't breach the agreement. So the answer is H.

Wait, but option I says the condition wasn't fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal doesn't excuse it. So I is also a possible correct answer.

The difference between H and I is the reasoning. H says because the sale didn't go through, no commission. I says because the condition wasn't fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal doesn't change that.

I think both H and I are similar, but I might be more precise. Because the condition (consummation) wasn't met, the agent can't recover, regardless of the nephew's refusal to sue. So the answer is I.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to make a decision. Based on the contract terms, the commission is due upon closing. The sale didn't close because the buyer breached. The nephew didn't breach the brokerage agreement. Therefore, the agent can't recover the commission. So the answer is H or I.

But looking at the options, option I states that the condition hasn't been fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal doesn't excuse that. So I is the better answer because it addresses the condition precedent not being met, and the nephew not being at fault.

The question revolves around a real estate brokerage agreement where the agent's commission is contingent upon the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent found a buyer, and the nephew and the buyer signed a sales contract for $500,000. However, the buyer repudiated the contract without cause, and the nephew refused to sue the buyer or pay the commission. The issue is whether the agent can recover the commission under these circumstances.

The brokerage agreement explicitly ties the commission to the consummation of the sale. Since the sale did not close due to the buyer's breach, the condition precedent for the commission was not fulfilled. The nephew's refusal to sue the buyer does not constitute a breach of the brokerage agreement, as the agreement does not obligate the nephew to enforce the sale contract. The agent's right to the commission depends on the sale being completed, which did not occur.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The nephew did not breach the brokerage agreement; the sale simply did not close.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The conditions precedent to the commission were not substantially fulfilled because the sale was not consummated.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The contract does not provide for a partial commission, and the agent's work does not entitle him to partial payment.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no basis in the contract for paying half the commission.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The agent is not a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the nephew and the buyer; the agent's rights are governed by the brokerage agreement with the nephew.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While the buyer's repudiation was beyond the agent's control, the commission is still contingent on the sale closing, which did not occur.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The agent's duty was to use best efforts to find a buyer, but the commission is explicitly tied to the sale closing.
- **Option H**: Correct. The sale did not go through, and the commission is contingent on consummation, so no commission is due.
- **Option I**: Correct. The condition precedent (consummation) was not fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal to sue the buyer does not excuse this failure.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While the agent fulfilled his duty to find a buyer, the commission is still contingent on the sale closing.

Between **H** and **I**, **I** is more precise because it emphasizes that the condition precedent (consummation) was not fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal to sue the buyer does not alter this outcome. Therefore, the agent cannot recover the commission.

Answer: I
