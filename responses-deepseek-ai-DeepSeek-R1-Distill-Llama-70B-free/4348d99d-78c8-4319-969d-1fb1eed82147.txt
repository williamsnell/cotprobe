Question:

A highway patrol officer stopped a driver for speeding and found that her license was suspended. He arrested her for driving while under suspension and secured her in the rear seat of the squad car. He then searched the car where he found several bags of cocaine inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat; he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?

Options:

A: Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.
B: No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.
C: No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.
D: Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.
E: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have probable cause to search the car.
F: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had the right to search the car for his own safety.
G: No, the motion will be denied because the officer had probable cause to search the car due to the driver's suspended license.
H: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not see the cocaine in plain view before searching the car.
I: Yes, the motion will be granted because the officer did not have the driver's consent to search the car.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the trial court will grant the driver's motion to suppress the cocaine found in her car. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A highway patrol officer stops a driver for speeding. He finds her license is suspended, so he arrests her for driving under suspension. He puts her in the rear seat of his squad car. Then he searches the car and finds cocaine in a coat on the rear seat, leading to more charges.

The driver is moving to suppress the cocaine evidence. I need to determine if the court will grant this motion.

I remember that searches and seizures are governed by the Fourth Amendment, which requires probable cause and usually a warrant, but there are exceptions. So the key here is whether the officer's search was lawful.

Let's look at the facts. The officer stopped her for speeding, which is a valid reason for a traffic stop. He then found her license was suspended and arrested her. At that point, she's under arrest and secured in the squad car.

Now, the officer searches the car. Under what authority? I think about the exceptions to the warrant requirement. One big exception is a search incident to a lawful arrest. Under the Supreme Court case New York v. Belton, when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest of the occupants of a car, the officer may search the entire passenger compartment and any containers therein as a search incident to arrest.

Wait, but in this case, the officer arrested her and put her in the rear seat. So he's arresting her, and then searching the car. Does the search incident to arrest apply here?

Wait a second, the recent case of Arizona v. Gant might have changed this a bit. I think Gant limited the Belton rule. In Gant, the Supreme Court held that police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search or if it's reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense for which the person was arrested.

In this problem, the driver was secured in the rear seat of the squad car. So she's not in the car anymore. So under Gant, the officer could search the car only if there's reason to believe it contains evidence related to the offense of driving under suspension.

Wait, but driving with a suspended license isn't likely to have evidence in the car, unless maybe the officer had some other reason. Alternatively, maybe the search was justified under another exception, like probable cause.

Wait, the officer found her license was suspended, which led to the arrest. After that, he searched the car. Did he have probable cause to search the car before finding the cocaine? Or was there another reason?

Another angle: when an officer makes a lawful arrest, they can search the arrestee and the area within their immediate control. But once the arrestee is secured, like in the squad car, the justification for searching the car under the search incident to arrest might not apply unless there's a reason to believe the car contains evidence of the crime.

So in this case, the crime was driving under suspension. The evidence of that crime would be her license, which she probably already provided. So the officer might not have had probable cause to search the car for evidence of that offense.

Alternatively, maybe the officer had probable cause to search the car for other reasons. But the problem doesn't mention any other factors, like suspicious behavior or smells, that might give probable cause for drugs.

Wait, but the officer didn't know about the cocaine until he searched. So unless there was something else, like the smell of drugs or something in plain view, he might not have had probable cause.

But the question is whether the search was lawful. Let's look at the options.

Option A says it must be suppressed because it's an unreasonable, warrantless search. If the search wasn't justified under any exception, then yes. But if it was under a valid exception, then no.

Option C says no because it's a search incident to arrest. But under Gant, that might not apply here. Since the driver was secured in the squad car, the search incident to arrest might not justify searching the entire car unless there's a reason to believe evidence is present.

Wait, but the initial offense was driving under suspension. There's no nexus between that offense and the presence of cocaine in the car. So the officer wouldn't have probable cause to search for evidence of that offense. Unless he had other reasons, like seeing drug paraphernalia or smelling something.

But the problem doesn't mention any of that. So perhaps the search wasn't justified under either probable cause or as a search incident to arrest.

Alternatively, if the officer had probable cause to search the car, maybe because he saw the coat and suspected something, but that's not stated.

Wait, another point: when an officer arrests someone, they can search the area within the suspect's reach. But once the suspect is secured, like in the back of a patrol car, the justification for searching the car diminishes unless there's a reason to believe evidence is there.

So in this case, the officer searched the car and found the cocaine in a coat on the rear seat. If the driver was already in custody, the search incident to arrest exception might not apply. Unless the search was based on probable cause.

So without probable cause, the search would be unlawful. Therefore, the suppression motion would be granted.

Looking at the options:

Option E says yes because the officer didn't have probable cause. That might be the case. But wait, did the officer have any probable cause to search the car before finding the cocaine? The problem doesn't say he had any reason to believe there were drugs. He found her license was suspended, which led to the arrest, but that's not related to the drugs.

So the search might have been unlawful because it was without a warrant and without probable cause, and the search incident to arrest exception doesn't apply because she was already secured.

So the correct answer would be that the motion to suppress is granted because the officer didn't have probable cause and the search wasn't otherwise justified.

Looking at the options again:

Option E says yes because no probable cause. Option C says no because it's incident to arrest. But under Gant, that's not applicable here. So the correct answer is likely E.

Alternatively, option A says it must be suppressed because it's an unreasonable warrantless search. But sometimes warrantless searches are okay if they fall under exceptions. Here, the exception doesn't apply, so it's unreasonable.

So perhaps either A or E is correct.

Wait, the difference between A and E: A says it's unreasonable and warrantless, so must be suppressed. E says because no probable cause.

In this scenario, the officer didn't have probable cause to search the car for drugs. The arrest was for driving under suspension, and he didn't have any reason to believe the car contained evidence of that offense beyond the license, which he already had.

So the search wasn't justified by probable cause, making it an unlawful warrantless search. Therefore, the motion to suppress would be granted.

So the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around whether the trial court will grant the driver's motion to suppress the cocaine found in her car during a search by the highway patrol officer. The key issue is whether the search was lawful under the Fourth Amendment, which requires probable cause and a warrant unless an exception applies.

The officer stopped the driver for speeding, a valid traffic stop, and arrested her for driving under a suspended license. After securing her in the rear seat of the squad car, he searched the car and found cocaine in a coat. The legality of this search depends on whether it fell under an exception to the warrant requirement, such as a search incident to arrest or probable cause.

Under **New York v. Belton**, a search incident to arrest allows an officer to search the passenger compartment and containers within the arrestee's reach. However, **Arizona v. Gant** limited this exception, requiring that the arrestee be within reaching distance of the vehicle or that there be a reasonable belief that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense for which the person was arrested. Here, the driver was secured in the squad car, so the search incident to arrest exception does not apply unless there was a reason to believe the car contained evidence of driving under suspension.

The offense of driving under suspension does not inherently create a nexus for searching the car for cocaine. The problem does not mention any additional factors, such as probable cause (e.g., seeing drug paraphernalia or smelling drugs), that would justify the search. Without probable cause or another valid exception, the search was unlawful.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correctly states that the search was unreasonable and warrantless, but the reasoning should focus on the lack of probable cause.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because the search incident to arrest exception does not apply under **Gant**, as the driver was secured in the squad car.
- **Option E**: Correct because the officer lacked probable cause to search the car for drugs, and no other exception justified the search.

The most accurate answer is **Option E**, as the search was unlawful due to the absence of probable cause.

Answer: E
