Okay, so I've got this problem here: What is the remainder when 2^87 + 3 is divided by 7? Hmm, I need to find (2^87 +3) mod 7. Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

I remember that when dealing with exponents modulo a number, there's something called modular exponentiation. Maybe I can find a pattern in the powers of 2 modulo 7. Let me try calculating the first few powers of 2 modulo 7 and see if there's a cycle or pattern.

So, 2^1 is 2. Modulo 7, that's 2. 2^2 is 4, mod7 is 4. 2^3 is 8, which is 1 mod7 because 8-7=1. Okay, 2^3 ≡1 mod7.

Now, 2^4 would be 2^3 * 2 = 1*2=2 mod7. 2^5 is 2^4 *2=2*2=4 mod7. 2^6 is 4*2=8≡1 mod7 again. Oh, wait, so the cycle repeats every 3 exponents. So the pattern is 2,4,1,2,4,1... and so on.

So the cycle length is 3. That means every exponent that's a multiple of 3 will be 1 mod7. So for 2^87, I can see if 87 is a multiple of 3. 3 times 29 is 87, yes. So 2^87 ≡1 mod7.

So 2^87 is 1 mod7. Then I add 3: 1 +3 =4. So the total is 4 mod7. Wait, but wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, 2^3 is 8, which is 1 mod7. 2^6 would be (2^3)^2 =1^2=1 mod7. 2^9=1 again. So every exponent that's a multiple of 3 gives 1. 87 is 3*29, so 2^87 is indeed 1 mod7.

So 2^87 +3 ≡1 +3=4 mod7. Oh wait, but looking at the options, option I is 4. So the remainder should be 4.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Because sometimes when I'm doing these modular things, it's easy to slip up.

Let me recheck: 2^1 mod7=2. 2^2=4, 2^3=8 mod7=1. 2^4=2^3 *2=1*2=2. 2^5=4, 2^6=8 mod7=1. So yes, the cycle is 3. So 87 divided by 3 is exactly 29, so exponent 87 is in the same position as exponent 3, which is 1.

So 2^87 mod7=1. Adding 3: 1+3=4. So 4 mod7 is 4. So the remainder is 4. Looking at the options, option I is 4. So the answer should be I.

To determine the remainder when \(2^{87} + 3\) is divided by 7, we start by analyzing the powers of 2 modulo 7. Calculating the first few powers:

\[
\begin{align*}
2^1 &\equiv 2 \mod 7, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \mod 7, \\
2^3 &\equiv 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7.
\end{align*}
\]

We observe that the powers of 2 modulo 7 repeat every 3 exponents: \(2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, \dots\). This periodicity means \(2^n \mod 7\) depends on \(n \mod 3\). Since \(87 = 3 \times 29\), we have:

\[
2^{87} \equiv 2^{3 \times 29} \equiv (2^3)^{29} \equiv 1^{29} \equiv 1 \mod 7.
\]

Adding 3 to this result:

\[
2^{87} + 3 \equiv 1 + 3 \equiv 4 \mod 7.
\]

Thus, the remainder when \(2^{87} + 3\) is divided by 7 is 4. From the given options, the correct answer is:

I: 4.
