Question:

What is validity?

Options:

A: Validity is the extent to which a test can be administered in different languages.
B: Validity is whether the test measures what the examiner wants it to measure and how well it measures it.
C: Validity is based solely on empirical evidence.
D: Validity is the degree to which a test predicts future performance.
E: Validity is the reliability of a test.
F: Validity is the level of difficulty of a test.
G: Validity is the length of time a test remains applicable.
H: Validity is the ease with which test results can be compared across different populations.
I: Validity is the consistency of test results over time.
J: Validity is the subjective interpretation of a test.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about validity, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on my testing and measurement concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking, "What is validity?" with options from A to J. Let me start by recalling what I know about validity. From what I remember, validity in testing refers to whether a test actually measures what it's supposed to measure. It's about the accuracy and relevance of the test. So, it's not just about whether the test is reliable (which is more about consistency), but whether it's measuring the right thing.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says validity is about administering a test in different languages. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I think that's more related to the test's accessibility or maybe cultural bias, not validity itself. So probably not A.

Option B states that validity is whether the test measures what the examiner wants and how well it does so. That aligns with what I was thinking. It's about measuring the intended construct accurately. So B seems like a strong candidate.

Option C mentions validity being based solely on empirical evidence. Well, I remember that validity can be based on both empirical evidence and theoretical considerations. For example, face validity is about whether a test appears to measure what it should, which is more theoretical or subjective. So C might be incorrect because it's too narrow, focusing only on empirical data.

Option D says validity is the degree to which a test predicts future performance. Wait, that sounds familiar. Isn't that called predictive validity? Predictive validity is a type of validity where the test's results predict future outcomes, like job performance. But validity itself is a broader concept than just prediction. So D might be a type of validity, but not the definition of validity as a whole.

Option E claims validity is the reliability of a test. No, that's confusing two different concepts. Reliability is about consistency of results, like getting the same score each time you take the test. Validity is about accuracy and measuring the right thing. So E is definitely wrong.

Option F talks about the level of difficulty. That's more about the test's difficulty, perhaps related to norms or scaling, but not validity. So F isn't right.

Option G refers to the length of time a test remains applicable. That sounds like it could relate to test shelf life or perhaps stability over time, but I'm not sure that's validity. Maybe it's about the test's lifespan, but I don't think that's the same as validity.

Option H is about ease of comparing results across populations. That might be related to norms or standardization, but not validity. Validity is more about what the test measures, not how it compares across groups.

Option I says validity is the consistency of test results over time. Wait, that's reliability again. Consistency over time is test-retest reliability, a type of reliability, not validity. So I is incorrect.

Option J suggests validity is subjective interpretation. That doesn't sound right. Validity is more objective, based on evidence and theory, not just personal opinions.

So, putting it all together, the best answer seems to be option B. It directly addresses whether the test measures what it's supposed to and how well it does that, which fits with the definition of validity I remember.

The correct answer is the option that defines validity as whether a test measures what it is intended to measure and how well it does so.

**B: Validity is whether the test measures what the examiner wants it to measure and how well it measures it.**

B
