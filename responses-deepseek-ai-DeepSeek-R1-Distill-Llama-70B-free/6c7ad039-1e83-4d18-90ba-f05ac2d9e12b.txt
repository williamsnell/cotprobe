Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capacitors and electric fields. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The setup is a spherical shell of paraffin between two conductors. The inner sphere has a radius of 0.60 meters, and the outer sphere has an inner radius of 0.70 meters. So the paraffin is the dielectric material between them.

The problem has four parts: a, b, c, d. Let's start with part a, which asks for the capacitance between the conductors.

I remember that the capacitance of a spherical capacitor is given by the formula C = (4πε₀) * (r₁ r₂)/(r₂ - r₁), where r₁ is the radius of the inner sphere and r₂ is the radius of the outer sphere. But wait, since there's a dielectric material (paraffin) in between, the capacitance should be multiplied by the dielectric constant κ. So the formula becomes C = κ * (4πε₀) * (r₁ r₂)/(r₂ - r₁).

Wait, I should double-check the formula. Oh right, the capacitance for a spherical capacitor with dielectric is indeed κ times the vacuum capacitance. So that's correct.

What's the dielectric constant for paraffin? I think it's around 2 or 3. Oh wait, I remember paraffin has a dielectric constant of about 2.1 or something like that. Let me confirm: I think it's approximately 2.1. So κ ≈ 2.1.

Now plugging in the numbers. r₁ is 0.60 meters, r₂ is 0.70 meters. So r₁ r₂ is 0.6 * 0.7 = 0.42. The difference r₂ - r₁ is 0.70 - 0.60 = 0.10 meters.

So the capacitance without the dielectric would be (4πε₀) * (0.42)/(0.10) ). 4πε₀ is approximately 1.11265e-10 F/m, but wait, more accurately, 1/(4πε₀) is about 9e9, so 4πε₀ is 1/(9e9) ) ≈ 1.11e-10 F·m⁻¹.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The capacitance in vacuum for spherical capacitors is C0 = 4πε₀ * (r₁ r₂)/(r₂ - r₁). But when you have a dielectric, you multiply this by κ, so C = κ * C0.

So plugging in the numbers:

C0 = (4πε₀) * (0.6 * 0.7) / (0.7 - 0.6) )

= (4πε₀) * (0.42) / 0.1 )

= 4πε₀ * 4.2 

Wait, 0.42 divided by 0.1 is 4.2? Wait 0.42 / 0.1 is 4.2? No, 0.42 / 0.1 is 4.2, yes. So 4.2 times (4πε₀) ?

Wait, 4πε₀ is 1.11265e-10 F/m, so 4.2 * 1.11265e-10 = approximately 4.671e-10 F.

Then multiply by κ = 2.1: 4.671e-10 * 2.1 = around 9.81e-10 F. Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 4.671e-10 * 2 = 9.34e-10, plus 4.671e-10 * 0.1 = 4.671e-11. So total is about 9.81e-10 F. 

But wait, 9.81e-10 F is the same as 0.981 nF. Wait, no, 1e-9 is a nano. So 9.81e-10 is 0.981 nF, which is 0.000981 microfarad. Because 1 microfarad is 1e-6 F, 1 nano is 1e-9.

Wait, wait, 1 microfarad is 1e-6 F. So 9.81e-10 F is 0.981e-3 microfarad, because 1e-6 is micro. Oh, wait no, 9.81e-10 F = 0.981e-3 microfarad? Wait, no. Let me think:

1 microfarad = 1e-6 F.

So 9.81e-10 F = 9.81e-10 / 1e-6 = 0.981e-4 microfarad, which is 0.000981 microfarad. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 9.81e-10 F = 0.981e-9 F, which is 0.981 nano farad. To get microfarad, divide by 1e3. So 0.981e-3 microfarad, which is 0.000981 microfarad. Hmm, but looking at the options, the first part (a) of the options are in the range of 0.00078 to 0.0015 microfarad. So 0.00098 is close to 0.001 microfarad.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, 4πε₀ is 1.11265e-10 F/m. So:

C0 = 4πε₀ * (r₁ r₂)/(r₂ - r₁) = 1.11265e-10 * (0.6 * 0.7) / (0.1) )

Compute 0.6 * 0.7 = 0.42. 0.42 / 0.1 = 4.2.

So C0 = 1.11265e-10 * 4.2 = approx 4.671e-10 F.

Multiply by κ = 2.1: 4.671e-10 * 2.1 = let's compute that.

4 * 2.1 = 8.4, 0.671 * 2.1 = approx 1.4091. So total is 8.4 +1.4091 = 9.8091e-10 F.

So 9.8091e-10 F is 0.98091e-9 F, which is 0.98091 nF, or 0.00098091 microfarad.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.00092 microfarad, which is very close. Option A is 0.00085, J is 0.00078. So perhaps my calculation is correct, but maybe I made a mistake in the dielectric constant.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dielectric constant of paraffin is different. I thought it was around 2.1, but perhaps it's 2.0 or 2.2. Let me check. Oh wait, maybe the dielectric constant for paraffin is 2.0. Or paraffin wax is about 2.0. If that's the case, then κ=2.0. Let me recalculate.

C = κ * 4πε₀ * (r1 r2)/(r2 - r1)

So κ=2.0, then C0 is 4.671e-10 F. Multiply by 2 gives 9.342e-10 F, which is 0.9342e-9 F, or 0.9342 nF, which is 0.0009342 microfarad. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 0.00085, option H is 0.00092.

Wait, maybe I should check the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, the formula for spherical capacitor is correct, right? So perhaps I should proceed.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more precisely.

Compute 0.6 *0.7 = 0.42. 0.42 / 0.1 =4.2.

C0 =4πε₀ *4.2. 4πε₀ is about 1.112650056e-10 F/m.

So 1.112650056e-10 *4.2 = let's compute that.

1.112650056e-10 *4 =4.450600224e-10.

1.112650056e-10 *0.2=0.222530011e-10.

Adding together: 4.450600224e-10 +0.222530011e-10=4.673130235e-10 F.

Multiply by κ=2.1 gives 4.67313e-10 *2.1 = ?

4.67313e-10 *2=9.34626e-10.

4.67313e-10 *0.1=4.67313e-11.

Adding: 9.34626e-10 +4.67313e-11 = 9.8136e-10 F.

So 9.8136e-10 F is 0.98136e-9 F, which is 0.98136 nF, or 0.00098136 microfarad.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.00092, which is a bit lower than this. Option A is 0.00085, which is lower. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for κ. Let me check the dielectric constant again.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the dielectric constant for paraffin. Paraffin wax typically has a dielectric constant around 2.0 to 2.3. Let me confirm: online sources say paraffin has a dielectric constant of approximately 2.0. So maybe I should use κ=2.0.

So with κ=2.0, capacitance would be 4.67313e-10 *2 =9.34626e-10 F, which is 0.9346e-9 F, or 0.9346 nF, 0.0009346 microfarad. So that's approximately 0.000935 microfarad. None of the options exactly match that.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.00085, H is 0.00092. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem treats the space as a parallel plate capacitor? No, no, it's spherical. So the formula I used should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the formula for a spherical capacitor is C = 4π ε0 (r1 r2)/(r2 - r1) * κ. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

r1=0.6 m, r2=0.7 m.

r1*r2=0.42.

r2 - r1=0.1 m.

So (r1 r2)/(r2 - r1)=4.2.

Multiply by 4π ε0: 4π ε0 is 1.11265e-10 F/m, so 1.11265e-10 *4.2 = 4.67313e-10 F.

Multiply by κ=2.1: 9.8136e-10 F, which is 0.981 microfarad * 1e-6? Wait wait no, 9.8136e-10 F is 0.98136e-9 F, which is 0.98136 nF, which is 0.00098136 microfarad.

So the correct capacitance is approximately 0.000981 microfarad. Looking at the options, none of them exactly match, but option H is 0.00092, which is a bit lower. Option E is 0.00103, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the dielectric constant. Maybe it's 2.2? Let's try that.

κ=2.2: 4.67313e-10 *2.2= 10.281486e-10 F =1.0281486e-9 F =1.028 microfarad? No, wait, 1e-9 is nano, so 1.028e-9 is 1.028 nF, which is 0.001028 microfarad. Hmm, that's closer to option E (0.00103) or option D (0.00110). So perhaps the dielectric constant is 2.2, making the capacitance around 0.00103 microfarad, which matches option E.

But I thought paraffin's κ was around 2.0. Maybe the problem uses κ=2.1? Let me calculate with κ=2.1.

4.67313e-10 *2.1=9.8136e-10 F=0.98136e-9 F=0.00098136 microfarad.

Hmm, perhaps the given options rounded it, so looking for the closest match. Option H is 0.00092, which is 0.00092, which is 0.92e-3 microfarad. 0.92 is a bit lower than 0.981. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-examine the formula. Oh wait, the formula is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the reciprocal of (1/r1 +1/r2) or something else, but no, for spherical capacitors, the formula is as I used.

Wait another approach: The formula for C is κ * 4πε0 * (r1 r2)/(r2 - r1).

Plugging in numbers:

r1=0.6, r2=0.7.

r1 r2=0.42.

r2 - r1=0.1.

So (r1 r2)/(r2 - r1)=4.2.

Multiply by 4π ε0: 4.2 * 1.11265e-10 =4.67313e-10.

Multiply by κ=2.1: 9.8136e-10 F, which is 0.98136e-9 F, 0.00098136 microfarad.

So perhaps the correct option isn't exactly listed, but looking at the options, option E has 0.00103 microfarad. That's 0.00103, which is 1.03e-3. Our calculation is 0.981e-3, which is 0.000981. So 0.00103 is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the value of 4πε₀ is more accurately 1.112650056e-10 F/m.

So 4π ε0 = 1.112650056e-10 F/m.

So 4.2 * 1.112650056e-10 = 4.673130235e-10 F.

Multiply by κ=2.1: 4.67313e-10 *2.1 = 9.8136e-10 F.

So 9.8136e-10 F is 0.98136e-9 F = 0.98136 nF = 0.00098136 microfarad.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.00092, which is 0.92e-3 microfarad. So perhaps the intended answer is option H, but I'm getting 0.000981, which is closer to 0.001, so maybe the actual correct option is not present, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses κ=2.0, which would give C=9.346e-10 F, which is 0.9346e-9 F, 0.0009346 microfarad. Option H is 0.00092, which is 0.92e-3, which is 0.00092, which is very close to 0.0009346.

So perhaps the intended answer for part a is 0.00092 microfarad, which is option H. But I'm a bit confused because the calculation gives a higher value.

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I miscalculated 4π ε0 * 4.2.

4π ε0 is approximately 1.11265e-10 F/m.

4.2 * 1.11265e-10 = ?

1.11265e-10 *4 =4.4506e-10

1.11265e-10 *0.2=0.22253e-10

Adding: 4.4506e-10 + 0.22253e-10 =4.67313e-10 F/m.

Multiply by κ=2.1: 4.67313e-10 *2.1=9.8136e-10 F.

Hmm. So perhaps I should look for an option that's around 0.00098 microfarad, but none of the options match exactly. Wait, let's look again.

Options:

A: 0.00085 microfarad

H: 0.00092 microfarad

E: 0.00103 microfarad.

So perhaps the intended answer is option E, but my calculation with κ=2.1 gives higher. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different κ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the dielectric is paraffin, which has a breakdown electric field. But wait, that's part (b). Let me proceed to part (b) now.

Part (b) asks for the largest electric potential difference that can be applied without dielectric breakdown.

I know that the breakdown electric field for paraffin is around 1e6 V/m, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe it's higher. I think for paraffin, the dielectric strength is about 1e6 V/m. Let me confirm: I think it's around 1 MV/m, but perhaps it's higher, like 3e6 V/m. Wait, no, that's probably for other materials. Let me think: Air is about 3 MV/m, but paraffin is a better insulator, so maybe higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's 3e6 V/m.

Wait, no, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again: The dielectric strength of paraffin is about 1e6 V/m. Or perhaps 2e6 V/m. I'm a bit uncertain, but I think for this problem, it's given as a known value. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps it's a standard value. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1e6
