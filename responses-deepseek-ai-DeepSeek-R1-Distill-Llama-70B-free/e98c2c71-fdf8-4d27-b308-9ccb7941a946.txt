Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing, specifically regarding the objectivity of an internal auditor from the perspective of an independent auditor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

The question is asking what an independent auditor should do when assessing the internal auditor's objectivity. Objectivity here probably refers to whether the internal auditor is unbiased and can perform their duties without conflicts of interest.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Perform tests of controls to determine if significant internal control activities are properly maintained. I think tests of controls are more about evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls, not directly about the internal auditor's objectivity. So maybe not A.

Option B: Review the internal auditor's educational background and certifications. Well, that's about their qualifications, not objectivity. Like, knowing if they're certified might say they're competent, but not if they're unbiased.

Option C: Evaluate the internal auditor's personal financial statements. Oh, that's interesting. If the internal auditor has a financial interest in the company or related parties, that could impair their objectivity. But wait, as an independent auditor, would they have access to the internal auditor's personal financials? I'm not sure. It might be an invasion of privacy unless there's a clear policy allowing it. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Option D: Consider the internal auditor's relationship with external regulatory bodies. I'm not sure how this ties into objectivity. Maybe if they're too close to regulators, but that doesn't immediately scream conflict of interest regarding their internal duties.

Option E: Review the internal auditor's reports to verify that the conclusions reached are consistent with the procedures performed. This sounds more like assessing the quality of their work, not their objectivity. It's about the accuracy of their reports, not whether they're biased.

Option F: Analyze the risk factors related to misstatements from misappropriation of assets. This is about assessing fraud risks, not directly about the internal auditor's objectivity.

Option G: Assess the frequency and severity of past audit findings. Again, this might relate to the effectiveness of the internal audit function, but not directly to the objectivity of the individual auditor.

Option H: Consider the policies that prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed in key management positions. Oh, this makes sense. If the internal auditor has a relative in a key position they're auditing, that's a clear conflict of interest. So the independent auditor would check if there are policies in place to prevent such situations, ensuring the internal auditor's objectivity.

Wait, but the question is about assessing the internal auditor's objectivity. So the independent auditor would look for factors that might impair that objectivity. One key factor is whether the internal auditor could be influenced by personal relationships, like family members in positions they audit. So if the company has policies preventing such conflicts, that supports the internal auditor's independence and objectivity.

So the correct answer would be H. Because it's about checking for potential conflicts of interest that could affect objectivity. Other options don't directly address this.

When assessing an internal auditor's objectivity, the independent auditor should focus on identifying potential conflicts of interest that could impair the internal auditor's ability to remain unbiased. Among the options provided, the most relevant is considering policies that prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed in key management positions. This directly addresses potential personal relationships that could influence the internal auditor's judgment and thereby affect their objectivity.

Answer: H
