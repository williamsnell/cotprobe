Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's give it a shot.

The problem says that we have a system of 2.0 moles of CO2 gas. Initially, it's at 25°C (which is 298 K) and 10 atm pressure. It's confined in a cylinder with a cross-section of 10.0 cm². The gas is allowed to expand adiabatically against an external pressure of 1.0 atm, and the piston moves 20 cm outward. We need to calculate the change in entropy, ΔS.

Hmm, okay, I remember that for an adiabatic process, the heat exchange Q is zero. But wait, entropy change is given by ΔS = Q_rev / T. Oh wait, so in an adiabatic process, if it's reversible, then Q is zero and ΔS would be zero. But wait, this expansion is against a constant external pressure, which might make it an irreversible process. Oh right, because in reversible processes, the external pressure is almost equal to the internal pressure. So in this case, the process is irreversible.

So for irreversible adiabatic expansion, the change in entropy isn't zero. I think the formula used is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(P1/P2). Wait, no, that's for a reversible process at constant pressure or something else. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, another approach: since the process is adiabatic, Q=0. But entropy change is for the universe (system + surroundings). But since the problem only asks for the system's entropy change, perhaps I can find that. But wait, in an adiabatic process, the entropy change of the system equals the entropy generated (since for the surroundings, Q is zero, and for the system, the entropy change is due to irreversibility).

Alternatively, since the process is adiabatic but irreversible, I can model it as such.

Wait, let me think about the process. The gas expands against a constant external pressure. So the work done is P_ext * ΔV. But for an adiabatic process, the first law says ΔU = -W, where W is work done by the system. So I can find the work done, then find the change in internal energy, and then find the temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, but since CO2 is a perfect gas, I can relate temperatures and volumes or pressures. Hmm.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the initial volume of the gas.
2. Calculate the final volume after expansion.
3. Find the work done during expansion.
4. Since the process is adiabatic, the change in internal energy ΔU equals -W. For an ideal gas, ΔU is n Cv ΔT. So I can find the final temperature T2.
5. Then, with T1 and T2, calculate the entropy change using ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Wait, but wait, I think the formula might be different. Because for entropy, the formula when both T and V change is ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1). Alternatively, since for ideal gases, entropy change can also be written as ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1).

But wait, in irreversible processes, is that formula still valid? Because those formulas are typically for reversible processes. Oh, right, but entropy is a state function, so the change only depends on initial and final states, not the path. So yes, I can use those equations regardless of the process path.

So, let's proceed step by step.

First, initial volume. The initial pressure is 10 atm, temperature is 298 K, and we have 2.0 moles. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? Or sometimes it's 8.314 J/mol·K, but since we're dealing with atm and liters, 0.0821 is better.

So initial volume V1 = nRT / P.

n = 2.0 mol, R=0.0821, T=298 K, P=10 atm.

V1 = (2.0)(0.0821)(298) / 10.

Let me compute that:

2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642.

0.1642 * 298 ≈ 48.91 (since 0.1642 * 300 is 49.26, minus 0.1642*2=0.3284, so 49.26 - 0.3284 = 48.9316).

Then V1 = 48.9316 / 10 = 4.89316 L. So about 4.893 liters.

Wait, but the cylinder's cross-section is 10 cm², which is 0.0010 m² (since 1 m² is 10^4 cm², so 10 cm² is 10e-4 m², which is 0.0001 m² or 1e-4 m²). Wait, wait, no. 1 m² is 10^4 dm²? No, wait, 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10^4 cm². So 10 cm² is 10 / 1e4 = 1e-3 m²? No, wait, 10 cm² is 10*(1e-2 m)^2 = 10*(1e-4 m²) )= 1e-3 m². So 10 cm² = 0.001 m² = 1e-3 m². But wait, 1 m² is 1e4 dm², and 1 dm² is 100 cm², so maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me just check:

1 m = 100 cm. So, 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10000 cm². So, 10 cm² is 10 / 10000 m² = 0.001 m². So, 1e-3 m².

But wait, the piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. So the change in volume ΔV is cross-section area multiplied by the distance moved.

So ΔV = A * d = 0.001 m² * 0.2 m = 0.0002 m³.

Wait, 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So 0.0002 m³ is 0.2 liters. So the final volume V2 is V1 + ΔV.

V1 was approximately 4.89316 L, and ΔV is 0.2 L, so V2 = 5.09316 L.

Wait, no. Wait, the cross-section is 10 cm², which is 10e-4 m², because 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 10 cm² is 10 * 1e-4 = 1e-3 m². So the area is 1e-3 m². The piston moves 20 cm, which is 0.2 m. So the change in volume is 1e-3 m² * 0.2 m = 2e-4 m³. Since 1 m³ is 1000 L, 2e-4 m³ is 0.2 L, yes. So V2 = V1 + 0.2 L ≈ 4.89316 + 0.2 = 5.09316 L.

So work done W is P_ext * ΔV. P_ext is 1.0 atm. So W = (1 atm) * (0.2 L) = 0.2 L·atm.

Wait, but the formula for work done is W = -P_ext * ΔV. Because when the system does work on the surroundings, it's negative from the system's point of view. But since it's expanding, ΔV is positive, so W is negative. Wait, but in the first law, ΔU = q + w. Wait, no, the first law is ΔU = q + W, where W is work done on the system. So if the system does work, W is negative. So in this case, the work done by the system is positive, so W in the equation would be negative. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check this.

Alternatively, for expansion work, the formula is W = -P_ext ΔV because the system is doing work on the surroundings. So in this case, W = - (1 atm) * (0.2 L) = -0.2 L·atm.

But to convert this work into joules, I need to use the conversion factor. 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J. So W = -0.2 * 101.325 ≈ -20.265 J.

Wait, but let's make it precise: 1 L·atm = 101.325 J. So 0.2 L·atm is 20.265 J. So W is -20.265 J.

Now, since the process is adiabatic, Q=0, so ΔU = W. ΔU is the change in internal energy, which for an ideal gas is n Cv ΔT.

So ΔU = n Cv (T2 - T1) = W = -20.265 J.

We can solve for T2.

n = 2.0 mol. Cv for CO2 is given as 28.8 J/(mol·K).

So,

2 * 28.8 * (T2 - 298) = -20.265

Calculating 2*28.8 = 57.6.

So,

57.6 (T2 - 298) = -20.265

Divide both sides by 57.6:

T2 -298 = -20.265 / 57.6 ≈ -0.3516 K.

So T2 ≈ 298 - 0.3516 ≈ 297.648 K.

Wait, so the temperature drops a bit. That makes sense because the gas is doing work against an external pressure, losing internal energy, so temperature decreases.

Now, with T1=298 K, T2≈297.648 K, we can compute the entropy change.

The formula for entropy change for an ideal gas when both temperature and volume change is:

ΔS = n Cv ln(T2/T1) + n R ln(V2/V1)

Alternatively, since in the process, the pressure changes as well, another formula is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

But perhaps using the first formula is better because I have V1 and V2.

Let me compute V1 and V2 again:

V1 was 4.893 L, V2 is 5.093 L.

So V2/V1 = 5.093 / 4.893 ≈ 1.0407.

So, n=2, Cv=28.8.

ΔS = 2 * 28.8 * ln(297.648 / 298) + 2 * R * ln(5.093/4.893)

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: 2 * 28.8 * ln(T2/T1)

T2/T1 is 297.648 / 298 ≈ 0.99885.

ln(0.99885) ≈ -0.00115 (since ln(1 - x) ≈ -x for small x, and 0.99885 is 1 - 0.00115).

So,

2 * 28.8 * (-0.00115) ≈ 57.6 * (-0.00115) ≈ -0.06624 J/K.

Second term: 2 * R * ln(1.0407)

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

ln(1.0407) ≈ 0.0396.

So,

2 * 8.314 * 0.0396 ≈ 16.628 * 0.0396 ≈ 0.658 J/K.

So total ΔS ≈ (-0.06624) + 0.658 ≈ 0.5918 J/K.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: +0.30, which is lower, and option H: +0.45, but wait, option D is +1.5, which is much higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, let's compute ln(T2/T1):

T2 = 297.648, T1=298.

So T2/T1 ≈ 0.99885.

ln(0.99885) is approximately:

Using a calculator, ln(0.99885) ≈ -0.00115. So that's correct.

First term: 2 * 28.8 * (-0.00115) = 57.6 * (-0.00115) = let's compute:

57.6 * 0.001 = 0.0576. So 57.6 * 0.00115 = 0.0576 + (57.6 * 0.00015) = 0.0576 + 0.00864 = 0.06624. But since it's negative, it's -0.06624 J/K.

Second term: 2 * 8.314 * ln(5.093/4.893)

5.093/4.893 = approx 1.0407.

ln(1.0407) is approximately 0.0396.

So 2 * 8.314 = 16.628.

16.628 * 0.0396 ≈ let's compute 16 * 0.0396 = 0.6336, and 0.628 * 0.0396 ≈ 0.0249. So total ≈ 0.6336 + 0.0249 ≈ 0.6585.

So the total ΔS ≈ (-0.06624) + 0.6585 ≈ 0.592 J/K. So approximately 0.59 J/K. Looking at the options, the options are A:0.3, B:0.9, C:0.6, D:1.5, etc.

Wait, so 0.59 is close to 0.6, which is option C: +0.60 J/K^-1.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistake in the calculation?

Wait, another thing: perhaps I should compute the volumes more accurately, or check the work done correctly.

Wait, the initial volume V1 was 4.893 L, and the change in volume is 0.2 L, so V2 is 5.093 L. So the ratio V2/V1 is 5.093/4.893 ≈ 1.0407, which seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the work done more carefully. Let me recheck that.

Work done in expansion against a constant external pressure is W = -P_ext * ΔV.

ΔV is 0.2 L, P_ext is 1 atm. So W = -1 atm * 0.2 L = -0.2 L·atm.

Convert W to joules: 0.2 L·atm * 101.325 J/(L·atm) = 20.265 J. So W is -20.265 J.

Then, ΔU = W. For an ideal gas, ΔU = n Cv ΔT.

So, 2 * 28.8 (T2 - 298) = -20.265.

So T2 = [(-20.265) / (2 * 28.8)] + 298.

Compute denominator: 2 * 28.8 = 57.6.

-20.265 /57.6 ≈ -0.3516 K.

So T2 ≈ 298 - 0.3516 ≈ 297.648 K. That's correct.

So the temperature change is about -0.35 K.

So for the entropy calculation, I think the approach is correct.

Hmm. So the ΔS is approximately 0.59 J/K, which is near option C: +0.60 J/K^-1.

But wait, the options don't list C as 0.60 J/K, let me check.

Looking back:

Options:

A: +0.30

B: +0.90

C: +0.60

D: +1.50

E: -0.60

F: +0.75

G: -0.90

H: +0.45

I: -0.75

J: +1.20

So option C is +0.60 J/K^-1.

Wait, but in my calculation, I got approximately 0.59, which would round to 0.6. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps I should use the formula for entropy change in terms of pressure and temperature. Let's try that and see if I get the same result.

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

But wait, do I know P2?

Alternatively, since we know V2 and T2, perhaps we can compute P2 using the ideal gas law.

Compute P2 = n R T2 / V2.

n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T2=297.648 K, V2=5.093 L.

So P2 = (2)(0.0821)(297.648) / 5.093.

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642.

0.1642 * 297.648 ≈ let's compute:

0.1642 * 300 = 49.26, but subtract 0.1642 * (300 - 297.648) = 0.1642 * 2.352 ≈ 0.386.

So 49.26 - 0.386 ≈ 48.874.

So P2 = 48.874 / 5.093 ≈ 9.59 atm.

So P2 ≈ 9.59 atm.

Then, using the entropy formula:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Wait, because for an ideal gas, Cp = Cv + R. So Cp = 28.8 + 8.314 ≈ 37.114 J/mol·K.

So,

ΔS = 2 * 37.114 * ln(297.648/298) - 2 * 8.314 * ln(9.59 / 10)

Compute each term.

First term: 2 * 37.114 *
