Question:

After a wife found out about her husband's infidelity, she decided to have him killed. The defendant approached a hit man to solicit his assistance in carrying out the planned murder. Although the wife believed that he was a hit man, he was, in fact, an undercover agent. The wife told the undercovr agent she would pay him $20,000 if he accepted the job and an additional $20,000 after the killing was completed. Upon hearing the wife's proposal, the undercover agent told the wife he would kill her husband. However, the undercover agent secretly intended not to go through with the plan, and he merely feigned agreement because he wished to trap the wife. The wife told the undercover agent that she would deliver the first payment the next day. However, before making the initial payment, the wife learned that the hit man was really an undercover agent. Fearful that she might be prosecuted for planning her husband's murder, the wife contacted the police and renounced her participation in the criminal endeavor. The defendant will most likely be found

Options:

A: not guilty of either solicitation or conspiracy to commit murder.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with solicitation and conspiracy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll think through it step by step.

The scenario is about a wife who wants her husband killed. She approaches someone she thinks is a hitman, offering him $20,000 upfront and another $20,000 after the job is done. Unbeknownst to her, this hitman is actually an undercover agent. The agent agrees to do the job, but he's just pretending to catch her. Then, before she makes the first payment, she finds out he's an undercover agent and gets scared. So she contacts the police and renounces her involvement.

The question is asking what the defendant (the wife) will most likely be found guilty of, if anything.

Alright, let's start by recalling the elements of the crimes involved here. The options include solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt.

First, solicitation. Solicitation typically involves offering someone to commit a crime with the intent that the crime be committed. So, the wife offered money to someone to kill her husband. She intended for him to do it, so that should satisfy the intent requirement. The fact that the person she approached was an undercover agent doesn't negate the solicitation because what matters is her intent, not whether the crime was actually possible to commit. So she could be guilty of solicitation.

Next, conspiracy. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to commit it. Here, the wife thought she was agreeing with a hitman, but it was an undercover agent. The agent, however, didn't actually agree because he had no intention of going through with it. In most jurisdictions, conspiracy requires a meeting of the minds, meaning both parties must intend to commit the crime. If the agent was just feigning agreement to trap her, then there was no real agreement. So she might not be guilty of conspiracy because the other party didn't have the necessary intent.

Attempt requires that the defendant took a substantial step towards committing the crime with the intent to do so. But for attempt, the defendant must have gone beyond mere preparation and taken a step that is strongly corroborative of their intent. In this case, she approached the hitman, offered money, but didn't actually pay anything yet. She was about to make the first payment but then backed out. So did she take a substantial step? Offering to pay and agreeing might not be enough for attempt—solicitation is a completed offense, but attempt might require more. I'm not sure about this part.

Now, the wife contacted the police and renounced her participation before making the payment. Does that affect anything? Well, in some cases, renunciation can be a defense if it's complete and before any furthering of the crime. But here, she had already solicited the hitman. So the renunciation might not undo the solicitation, which was already completed when she made the offer.

Looking at the options:

Option F says guilty of solicitation. That seems possible because she offered money intending the crime to happen.

Option A says not guilty of either. That might not be right because she did commit solicitation.

Option H says not guilty of conspiracy but guilty of solicitation. That aligns with what I thought earlier—no conspiracy because the agent didn't agree, but guilty of solicitation.

Option D says guilty of both. But since the agent didn't agree, I don't think conspiracy applies.

Option E says not guilty due to renouncing. But I think the renunciation comes after the solicitation, so she's still guilty of that.

So putting it all together, the wife is guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy. So the correct answer would be option F or H.

Wait, option F is guilty of solicitation only, and H is guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy.

Wait, the options are:

H: not guilty of conspiracy, but guilty of solicitation.

Yes, that's more precise. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but I thought the answer was F. Let me double-check.

Wait, the question is about the defendant (the wife) and what she's guilty of. She solicited the undercover agent. So she's guilty of solicitation.

As for conspiracy, since the agent didn't agree, there was no conspiracy. So she's guilty of solicitation and not conspiracy. So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the elements of conspiracy. Conspiracy requires an agreement, but if the other party is a government agent who doesn't intend to go through with it, does that negate the conspiracy? Because both parties must have the intent. So yes, she intended, but the agent didn't, so no conspiracy. Therefore, she can't be guilty of conspiracy.

So the correct answer would be H: not guilty of conspiracy, but guilty of solicitation.

The question revolves around the criminal liability of a wife who solicited an undercover agent to murder her husband. The key legal issues involve solicitation, conspiracy, and the potential impact of the wife's renunciation of the plan.

1. **Solicitation**: Solicitation requires offering someone to commit a crime with the intent that the crime be carried out. The wife offered $20,000 to the undercover agent to kill her husband, demonstrating her intent for the crime to occur. The fact that the agent was undercover does not negate the solicitation, as the focus is on the defendant's intent, not the actual possibility of the crime. Therefore, the wife is guilty of solicitation.

2. **Conspiracy**: Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to do so. In this case, the undercover agent feigned agreement to trap the wife but had no intention of committing the crime. Without a "meeting of the minds" between the wife and the agent, the necessary elements of conspiracy are not met. Thus, the wife is not guilty of conspiracy.

3. **Attempt**: Attempt requires taking a substantial step toward committing a crime with the intent to complete it. The wife had not yet made the initial payment or taken any concrete action beyond solicitation. Therefore, her actions do not meet the threshold for attempt.

4. **Renunciation**: The wife contacted the police and renounced her participation before making the first payment. However, renunciation does not undo the completed act of solicitation, which had already occurred when she offered the money to the undercover agent.

Given these considerations, the wife is guilty of solicitation but not conspiracy. The correct answer is:

**H: Not guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but guilty of solicitation.**

Answer: H
