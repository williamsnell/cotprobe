Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Wurtz reaction. Hmm, I need to figure out how much hexane is produced when n-propylchloride reacts with excess sodium. The given mass is 10.0 grams of n-propylchloride, and the yield is 70%. 

Wait, right, the Wurtz reaction is when alkyl halides react with sodium metal in dry ether to form alkanes. The general reaction is 2 R-X + 2 Na → R-R + 2 NaX. So each molecule of alkyl halide gives half a molecule of the alkane because two molecules combine.

So first, I need to find out the moles of n-propylchloride. The formula for n-propylchloride is C3H7Cl. Let me calculate its molar mass. Carbon is 12, so 3*12=36, Hydrogen is 7*1=7, and Chlorine is about 35.5. So total is 36 +7 +35.5 = 78.5 g/mol.

Wait, wait, wait—actually, wait, n-propyl chloride is C3H7Cl. So the molar mass is (3*12) + (7*1) + 35.45. Let me calculate accurately. 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 35.45 is Cl. So 36+7=43, 43+35.45=78.45 g/mol.

So 10.0 grams of n-propylchloride divided by 78.45 g/mol gives the moles. Let me compute that: 10 / 78.45 ≈ 0.1275 moles. Let's say approximately 0.1275 mol.

In the reaction, two moles of n-propylchloride give one mole of hexane. Because n-propyl is C3H7, so two of them would make C6H14, which is hexane. So the mole ratio is 2:1.

So moles of hexane produced would be (0.1275 mol) * (1/2) = 0.06375 mol. But wait, that's only if the reaction goes to 100% yield. But the problem says 70% yield. So actual moles = 0.06375 * 0.7 = let's compute that. 0.06375 * 0.7 is 0.044625 moles.

Now, the molar mass of hexane (C6H14) is 6*12 +14*1 =72 +14=86 g/mol.

So mass of hexane is moles * molar mass: 0.044625 mol *86 g/mol ≈ 3.84 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. The options given are A through J. Let me check what's close to 3.84 grams.

Option B is 3.82 g, which is very close. So I think the correct answer is B. But wait, did I do the calculations correctly?

Wait, let me double-check the moles of n-propylchloride. 10g divided by 78.45 is approximately 0.1275. Yes. Then moles of hexane would be half that, so 0.06375. Multiply by 0.7 gives 0.044625. Molar mass of hexane is 86, so 0.044625 *86 = let's compute that exactly.

0.044625 *80 is 3.57, and 0.044625 *6 is 0.26775, so total is 3.57 +0.26775=3.83775 grams, which is approximately 3.84 grams. So option B is 3.82, which is the closest. Wait, but why isn't it 3.84? Maybe I made a slight error in the molar mass calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the molar mass of n-propylchloride more precisely. Carbon: 12.01 *3 =36.03. Hydrogen: 1.008*7=7.056. Chlorine: approx 35.45. So 36.03 +7.056=43.086 + 35.45=78.536 g/mol. So the exact moles are 10.0 /78.536 ≈ 0.12742 mol.

Then moles of hexane at 100% yield: 0.12742 /2 =0.06371. At 70% yield: 0.06371 *0.7 = 0.044597 moles.

Hexane's molar mass is 86.18 g/mol (since C is 12.01, H is 1.008. So 6*12.01=72.06, 14*1.008=14.112. 72.06+14.112=86.172 g/mol.

So exact mass is 0.044597 mol *86.172 g/mol = let me compute that.

0.044597 *86.172.

Let me compute 0.04 *86.172 =3.44688.

0.004597 *86.172 = Let's see. 0.004 *86.172 is 0.344688. 0.000597 *86.172 ≈ approx 0.0514.

So adding: 3.44688 +0.344688=3.791568, plus 0.0514 gives 3.842968 grams. So approximately 3.843 grams.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.82, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should check if I mixed up the yield.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial calculation used 78.5 g/mol as molar mass. Let me try that.

10.0 g /78.5 g/mol ≈ 0.12746 mol.

Half of that is 0.06373 moles.

70% yield: 0.06373 *0.7=0.04461 mol.

0.04461 *86 = 3.836 grams.

So it's about 3.84 grams, but the closest option is B:3.82. Hmm, but why isn't there an option with 3.84?

Wait, did I miscalculate somewhere else?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the theoretical yield first and then apply the 70%.

Wait, another way: Let me calculate the theoretical moles of hexane and then multiply by 0.7.

Theoretical moles: (10.0 g /78.45 g/mol) * (1 mol hexane / 2 mol propyl chloride) = (0.1275) *0.5 =0.06375 mol.

Mass of hexane = 0.06375 *86.18 =5.47 grams.

Wait, wait, wait—no, wait. That's at 100% yield. So with 70% yield, it's 5.47 * 0.7 = 3.83 grams. Oh wait, 5.47 times 0.7 is 3.829, which is approximately 3.83 grams.

So the answer should be around 3.83 grams, which matches option B (3.82) closely.

But wait, why the discrepancy? Let me compute 0.04461 *86.18.

0.04 *86.18=3.4472

0.00461 *86.18: let's compute 0.004 *86.18=0.34472, 0.00061*86.18≈0.0525.

Total: 3.4472 +0.34472=3.79192 +0.0525=3.8444 grams.

So it's 3.844 grams. So the closest option is B: 3.82. But why isn't it exactly 3.84? Are the options perhaps approximate?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial molar mass of propyl chloride.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the exact moles.

n-propyl chloride: C3H7Cl.

Molar mass: (3×12.01) + (7×1.008) +35.45.

3×12.01=36.03; 7×1.008=7.056; +35.45=36.03+7.056=43.086 +35.45=78.536 g/mol.

So 10.0g /78.536 g/mol = 10 /78.536 = approx 0.1275 mol.

So two moles make one mole of hexane. So 0.1275 /2 =0.06375 mol. Then 70% of that is 0.044625 mol.

Hexane's molar mass: 86.178 g/mol.

So 0.044625 ×86.178= let's compute this exactly.

0.04 ×86.178=3.44712

0.004625 ×86.178: Let's compute 0.004×86.178=0.344712; 0.000625×86.178=0.05392375.

Adding all together: 3.44712 + 0.344712 =3.791832 +0.05392375=3.84575575 grams.

So approximately 3.846 grams.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:3.82g, but none of the options exactly match 3.846. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:8.67

B:3.82

C:5.11

D:3.00

E:4.45

F:9.50

G:4.20

H:7.90

I:2.56

J:6.35

So option B is 3.82, which is just 0.026 grams less than our calculated 3.846. That's a small difference, perhaps due to rounding in the molar masses.

Alternatively, perhaps during calculation, the molar masses were approximated. Let me see.

Using approximate molar masses:

n-propyl chloride: C=12, H=1, Cl=35.5.

So 3×12=36 +7×1=7 +35.5=78.5 g/mol.

Moles of propyl chloride: 10/78.5≈0.1275.

Moles of hexane without yield: 0.1275/2=0.06375.

With 70%:0.06375×0.7=0.044625.

Hexane molar mass: 86 g/mol.

Mass=0.044625 ×86=3.83625 g, which is approximately 3.84 grams.

So 3.84 grams is the answer, but the options don't have that. The closest is B:3.82. Wait, perhaps the calculation used more precise molar masses and ended up with 3.82.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait another thing: wait, the Wurtz reaction produces an alkane by coupling two alkyl groups. So n-propyl chloride (C3H7Cl) would form C6H14 (hexane).

So the reaction is 2 C3H7Cl + 2 Na → C6H14 + 2 NaCl.

So the stoichiometry is correct; 2 moles of chloride give 1 mole of hexane.

Hmm. So I think my calculations are correct, which leads to approximately 3.84 grams. But the closest option is B:3.82g.

Wait, perhaps the molar mass of hexane I used was a bit high. Let me check that again.

Hexane is C6H14. So molar mass is:

6*(12.01) =72.06

14*(1.008)=14.112

Total=72.06 +14.112=86.172 g/mol.

So that's accurate. So 0.044625 *86.172 is indeed 3.844 grams.

Hmm, so perhaps the intended answer is B:3.82g, but maybe during calculation, the molar masses were slightly different.

Wait, another approach: let me compute using exact numbers without rounding too early.

Molar masses:

n-propyl chloride: (3×12.01) + (7×1.008) +35.45 = 36.03 +7.056 +35.45=78.536 g/mol.

Molar mass of hexane:6×12.01 +14×1.008=72.06 +14.112=86.172 g/mol.

So moles of n-propyl chloride:10.0 /78.536=0.12745 mol.

Moles of hexane (theoretical):0.12745 /2=0.063725 mol.

70% yield: 0.063725 ×0.7=0.0446075 mol.

Mass of hexane:0.0446075 ×86.172=?

Let me do this multiplication precisely.

0.0446075 ×86.172:

Break it down:

0.04 ×86.172 =3.44688

0.0046075 ×86.172:

Let me compute 0.004 ×86.172=0.344688

0.0006075 ×86.172=0.05236 approximately.

So total for 0.0046075 is 0.344688 +0.05236=0.397048.

Wait, wait, no: 0.0046075 is 0.004 +0.0006075.

So 0.004 ×86.172=0.344688

0.0006075 ×86.172= let's compute 0.0006 *86.172=0.0517032, and 0.0000075 *86.172=0.000646295. So total 0.0517032 +0.000646295≈0.0523495.

So 0.344688 +0.0523495≈0.3970375.

So total for 0.0446075 is 3.44688 (from 0.04) plus 0.3970375 (from 0.0046075) =3.44688 +0.3970375=3.8439175 grams.

So approximately 3.844 grams. 

Looking at the options, the closest is B:3.82 grams. But that's about 0.023 grams less. Maybe the question used slightly different molar masses, like using 35.5 for Cl instead of 35.45, which would change the moles slightly.

Let me try with Cl as 35.5.

n-propyl chloride molar mass:3*12 +7*1 +35.5=36+7+35.5=78.5 g/mol.

Moles:10/78.5≈0.12746.

Moles of hexane:0.06373.

70% yield:0.06373 *0.7=0.044611 mol.

Mass:0.044611 *86.172=3.844 grams.

Same result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to not consider the chloride's chlorine in the product, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, 10 grams divided by 78.536 g/mol is exactly 0.12745 mol.

So 0.12745 /2 =0.063725 moles of hexane theoretically.

70% of that is 0.0445075 mol.

Mass is 0.0445075 *86.172=?

Let me compute 0.0445075 *86.172.

0.04 *86.172=3.44688

0.0045075 *86.172: 0.004 *86.172=0.344688, 0.0005075 *86.172≈0.04375.

So 0.344688 +0.04375≈0.388438.

Total is 3.44688 +0.388438=3.835318 grams, which is 3.835 grams.

So approximately 3.835 grams. Which is 3.84 grams when rounded to three decimal places.

So the closest option is B:3.82 grams. But wait, 3.835 is closer to 3.84 than to 3.82. So perhaps the intended answer is B, but why is there a 3.84 grams not present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the reaction uses two equivalents of sodium, but that doesn't affect the stoichiometry between the alkyl halide and the product.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the molar ratio differently. But no, the reaction is 2 R-X → R-R, so 1 mole R-R from 2 moles R-X.

Wait, perhaps the product is hexane but in another state? No, the product is just hexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the molar mass of hexane was taken as 84 or something else. Wait, no, hexane is C6H14, which is 86.18 g/mol.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the initial calculation used 78 g/mol for n-propyl chloride.

n-propyl chloride's molar mass as 78 g/mol: 10/78=0.1282 mol.

Molar ratio:0.1282/2=0.0641 mol.

70% yield: 0.0641 *0.7=0.04487 mol.

Mass:0.04487 *86=3.858 grams.

So 3.86 grams, which is still closest to option B:3.82.

Wait, but perhaps the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reaction equation.

Wait, another thought: Wait, n-propyl chloride is C3H7Cl. When it reacts in the Wurtz reaction, it forms C6H14, but what if it's a different alkane? No, no, n-propyl would form hexane.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation using exact numbers.

n-propyl chloride: 10.0 g /78.536 g/mol = 0.12745 mol.

Hexane moles:0.12745 /2 =0.063725.

70%:0.04451 moles.

Mass: 0.04451 *86.172=?

Let me compute 0.04451 ×86.172.

Breakdown:

0.04 ×86.172 =3.44688

0.00451 ×86.172.

Compute 0.004 ×86.172=0.344688

0.00051 ×86.172=0.04397892.

So 0.344688 +0.04397892=0.38866692.

Total:3.44688 +0.38866692=
