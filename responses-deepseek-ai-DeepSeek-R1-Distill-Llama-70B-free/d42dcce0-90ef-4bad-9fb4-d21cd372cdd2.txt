Okay, so I need to solve this problem about an investment strategy and find the value of gamma that maximizes the overall factor. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The strategy is given as (γ, 0, 0). I'm not exactly sure what that means, but from the context, I think it's related to some kind of investment where you allocate a fraction γ to a certain asset, and the rest (0 and 0) to others. Maybe it's a two-asset or three-asset portfolio, but since the other two are zero, perhaps it's just one asset being invested in each step.

The overall factor after n steps is given as (1 + 2γ)^(n/2) * (1 - γ)^(n/2). Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think about it. If each step applies a factor, then after n steps, it's the product of each step's factor. So perhaps each step alternates between two outcomes? Like, one step you get (1 + 2γ) and the next you get (1 - γ), but that would alternate each step. But in the formula, both are raised to n/2, which suggests that each happens half the time. So maybe each step has a 50% chance of each factor? Or perhaps it's deterministic, and for even steps, you apply each factor n/2 times each. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "the overall factor multiplying your money after n steps is likely to be..." So maybe it's an expected value or average case. So each step could have some probability of applying (1 + 2γ) and (1 - γ), but each happening with 50% chance each time, so over n steps, each happens n/2 times on average.

Alternatively, maybe the strategy is such that half the steps use (1 + 2γ) and half use (1 - γ). But regardless, the formula is given as [(1 + 2γ) * (1 - γ)]^(n/2). Wait, because when you multiply (1 + 2γ) and (1 - γ), you get (1 + 2γ)(1 - γ) = 1 + 2γ - γ - 2γ² = 1 + γ - 2γ². But the formula is (1 + 2γ)^(n/2) * (1 - γ)^(n/2) = [ (1+2γ)(1-γ) ) ]^{n/2}.

Wait, no. Because (a^b * c^b) = (a c)^b. So yes, that product inside becomes (1 +2γ)(1 - γ) all raised to the n/2 power.

So the overall factor is [(1 + 2γ)(1 - γ)]^{n/2}.

But the problem says to find the gamma that maximizes this factor. Since n is a positive integer, and the exponent is n/2, the factor will be maximized when the base [(1 + 2γ)(1 - γ)] is maximized. So I can focus on maximizing the expression (1 + 2γ)(1 - γ).

Let me compute that expression: (1 + 2γ)(1 - γ) = 1*(1 - γ) + 2γ*(1 - γ) = 1 - γ + 2γ - 2γ². Simplify: 1 + γ - 2γ².

So the expression to maximize is 1 + γ - 2γ².

That's a quadratic equation in terms of gamma. The quadratic is -2γ² + γ +1. To find the maximum, since the coefficient of γ² is negative (-2), the parabola opens downward, so the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex of a quadratic aγ² + bγ + c is at γ = -b/(2a). Here, a is -2, b is 1.

So gamma = - (1) / (2 * -2) ) = -1 / (-4) = 1/4 = 0.25.

So the gamma that maximizes the factor is 0.25.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.25. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given investment strategy of the form $(\gamma, 0, 0)$ and aim to maximize the overall factor multiplying the money after $n$ steps. The factor is given as:

\[
(1 + 2\gamma)^{n/2} (1 - \gamma)^{n/2}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\left[(1 + 2\gamma)(1 - \gamma)\right]^{n/2}.
\]

To maximize this expression, we focus on maximizing the base of the exponent:

\[
(1 + 2\gamma)(1 - \gamma).
\]

Expanding this:

\[
(1 + 2\gamma)(1 - \gamma) = 1 + \gamma - 2\gamma^2.
\]

This is a quadratic function of $\gamma$: 

\[
f(\gamma) = -2\gamma^2 + \gamma + 1.
\]

Since the coefficient of $\gamma^2$ is negative, the parabola opens downward, and the maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic $a\gamma^2 + b\gamma + c$ is located at:

\[
\gamma = -\frac{b}{2a}.
\]

Here, $a = -2$ and $b = 1$, so:

\[
\gamma = -\frac{1}{2(-2)} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25.
\]

Thus, the value of $\gamma$ that maximizes the overall factor is $0.25$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 0.25.**
