Okay, so I have this physics problem here about thin film interference. Hmm, I remember that thin films like oil on water or glass can cause colors to appear because of interference between reflected light waves. The question is about blue light with a wavelength of 480 nanometers being reflected off an oil film on glass. I need to find the minimum thickness of the oil film, other than zero.

First, I should recall the concept of thin film interference. I think it involves the path difference and phase changes upon reflection. Let me try to remember the formula. Oh right, when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees, or half a wavelength. Conversely, if it reflects off a medium with a lower refractive index, there's no phase shift.

In this scenario, the oil is on glass. The oil has a refractive index of 1.2, and glass is 1.6. So light first goes from air into oil, then from oil into glass. Let's think about the reflections. The first reflection is air to oil. Air has a lower refractive index (around 1.0) than oil (1.2), so this reflection will cause a phase shift of 180 degrees. The second reflection is oil to glass. The oil's index is 1.2, glass is 1.6, so higher. Thus, this reflection also causes a phase shift of 180 degrees.

Wait, but wait. So both reflections have phase shifts. That means the two reflected waves (from the top and bottom of the oil film) both have a phase shift of 180 degrees. So the total phase difference between them would be zero? Because each has a 180 shift. But wait, there's also the path difference due to the film's thickness.

The path difference is twice the thickness of the film (because the wave goes down and then up), multiplied by the refractive index of the film. Oh right, because the wavelength inside the medium is λ/n, where n is the refractive index.

So the condition for constructive interference (which is what's causing the strong reflection) is that the path difference plus any phase shifts results in a whole number of wavelengths. But wait, what's the exact condition?

In this setup, since both reflections have a phase shift of 180 degrees, the two waves are inverted by the same amount. So the net effect is that the phase difference from reflections is zero. Therefore, the path difference must equal an integer multiple of the wavelength for constructive interference.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When considering thin film interference, the formula is 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ for destructive interference when there's a phase shift. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let's get this straight.

The general condition for constructive interference (bright colors) in thin films is when the path difference is an odd multiple of half-wavelengths. But I think I need to account for phase shifts upon reflection.

So the two reflections: the first is air-oil (low to high n), which causes a 180 phase shift. The second is oil-glass (low to high n), another 180 phase shift. Since both have the same phase shift, the reflections end up in phase with each other. But wait, the path difference comes into play.

The path difference is 2t (twice the thickness) multiplied by the refractive index of the oil, because the light travels through the oil twice (down and back up). Since wavelength λ is in vacuum, but inside the medium it's λ/n. So the physical path difference is 2nt, which corresponds to 2nt / (λ/n) )= 2n² t / λ in terms of wavelengths? Wait, no. Wait, the path length is 2t, and each wavelength in the medium is λ/n. So the number of wavelengths in the path is (2t) / (λ/n) ) = 2nt/λ.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The wavelength inside the oil is λ0 / n, where λ0 is 480 nm. So when the light travels through the oil, the effective wavelength is shorter.

The total path difference for the two reflected waves (from top and bottom surfaces) is 2t * n, because each traversal through the film adds t * n to the optical path. So 2t * n is the path difference. But wait, no, because the wavelength inside the film is λ/n. So the number of wavelengths in the path is (2t) / (λ/n) ) = 2nt/λ.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the conditions for constructive interference. When there's a phase shift due to reflection, the formula changes.

In general, the condition for constructive interference (bright) when there are two phase shifts (both 180 degrees) is that the path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength. Because each reflection gives a phase shift of π (180 degrees), so two phase shifts give 2π, which is equivalent to no phase shift. Therefore, the path difference must be an integer number of wavelengths for constructive interference.

Wait, no, wait. Because each reflection introduces a 180-degree shift, but the path difference adds a phase difference as well. Let me model this with math.

The total phase difference between the two waves is: phase shift due to reflection plus phase shift due to path difference.

Since both reflections cause a phase shift of 180 degrees, the total from reflections is 180 + 180 = 360 degrees, which is same as 0 degrees (since 360 mod 360 is 0). So the only phase difference comes from the path difference.

The path difference is 2nt (since the wave goes through the film twice, and each time the optical path is n*t, so 2nt). The phase difference from this is (2π / λ) * 2nt, where λ is the wavelength in vacuum.

Wait, no, because inside the medium, the wavelength is λ/n. So the phase change per meter is 2π/(λ/n) ) = 2π n / λ.

Thus, the phase difference due to path length is (2π n / λ) * 2t = (4 π n t) / λ.

Wait, I think I should re-express this. The phase difference from the path is (2π / (λ/n)) * 2t) = (2π n / λ) * 2t = 4 π n t / λ.

Hmm, but maybe I'm complicating it. Let's think in terms of constructive interference conditions.

Because both reflected waves undergo a phase shift of 180 degrees, their net phase shift from reflections is zero. So for constructive interference, the path difference must be an integer number of wavelengths. That is, 2nt = mλ, where m is an integer (m=1,2,3...).

Wait, but wait—another approach: the condition for constructive interference in thin films when both reflections cause a phase shift of 180 degrees is 2nt = (m - 1/2)λ? Or is it 2nt = mλ?

No, wait, when there's a phase shift of 180 degrees for both reflections, the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength. Because the phase shifts cancel each other (both are 180, so 360, which is 0 mod 2π), so the path difference must cause constructive interference on its own.

So the equation becomes 2nt = mλ, where m is an integer (m=1,2,3,...). This is because the path difference, when an integer number of wavelengths, leads to constructive interference.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the condition depends on whether the number of phase inversions is even or odd. Let me think.

In general, when light reflects off a medium with higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees (λ/2). So if both reflections cause a phase shift, that's a total of λ/2 + λ/2 = λ. Which is the same as no phase shift (since it's modulo λ). So the condition for constructive interference is that the path difference is mλ.

But if only one reflection causes a phase shift, then the condition would be 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ.

So in this problem, since both reflections have a phase shift of 180 degrees, the condition is 2nt = mλ.

We are looking for the minimum thickness (other than zero), so m=1.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem is about the reflected light being most strongly reflected, which is constructive interference in reflection. So the equation is 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ or 2nt = mλ, depending on phase shifts.

Wait, perhaps I should get this straight. Let me try to recall: when there's a phase shift upon reflection, the condition changes.

Case 1: One reflection causes a phase shift, the other doesn't.

The condition for constructive interference is 2nt = (m + 1/2)λ.

Case 2: Both reflections cause a phase shift, or neither.

Then, the condition is 2nt = mλ.

In our problem, both reflections cause a phase shift of 180 degrees, so case 2 applies.

So 2nt = mλ.

We need to find the minimum thickness, so m=1.

So t = (m λ) / (2n).

Given:

λ = 480 nm,

n = 1.2.

So t = (1 * 480 nm) / (2 * 1.2) )

Compute denominator: 2 * 1.2 = 2.4.

So 480 / 2.4 = 200 nm.

Wait, 480 divided by 2.4: Let's compute.

2.4 * 200 = 480? 2.4 * 200 = 480 yes, because 2 * 200 =400, 0.4*200=80, total 480.

So t=200 nm.

Looking at the options, option I is 200 nm.

But wait, wait a second. Wait another thing. Oh wait, wait, the film is on glass, but oil is the film. So the light goes air (n=1) → oil (n=1.2) → glass (n=1.6).

So for the first reflection (air/oil), since oil has higher n than air, reflection causes a 180 phase shift.

The second reflection (oil/glass): glass has higher n than oil, so again a 180 phase shift.

So both reflections have a phase shift, so the condition is 2nt = mλ.

Yes.

So for m=1, t=200 nm. So answer is I.
</think>

To determine the minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) that results in constructive interference for blue light of wavelength 480 nm, we analyze the situation using the principles of thin-film interference.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Refractive Indices**: The oil has a refractive index of \( n_{\text{oil}} = 1.2 \), and the glass has \( n_{\text{glass}} = 1.6 \). Light travels from air (\( n_{\text{air}} = 1.0 \)) into the oil and then into the glass.

2. **Phase Shifts Upon Reflection**:
   - At the air-oil interface: Since \( n_{\text{oil}} > n_{\text{air}} \), the reflected light undergoes a phase shift of \( 180^\circ \) (equivalent to \( \lambda/2 \)).
   - At the oil-glass interface: Since \( n_{\text{glass}} > n_{\text{oil}} \), the reflected light also undergoes a phase shift of \( 180^\circ \) (equivalent to \( \lambda/2 \)).
   - The total phase shift due to reflections is \( 360^\circ \), which is equivalent to no net phase shift.

3. **Path Difference**: The light wave travels through the oil film twice (down and back up), so the optical path difference is \( 2nt \), where \( t \) is the thickness of the oil film and \( n_{\text{oil}} = 1.2 \).

4. **Condition for Constructive Interference**: Since there is no net phase shift from reflections, the condition for constructive interference is:
   \[
   2nt = m\lambda
   \]
   where \( m \) is an integer ( \( m = 1, 2, 3, \dots \) ). For the minimum thickness (other than zero), we set \( m = 1 \).

5. **Solve for \( t \)**:
   Substituting \( n = 1.2 \) and \( \lambda = 480 \, \text{nm} \):
   \[
   t = \frac{m\lambda}{2n} = \frac{1 \cdot 480}{2 \cdot 1.2} = \frac{480}{2.4} = 200 \, \text{nm}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The minimum thickness of the oil film (other than zero) is \( 200 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
