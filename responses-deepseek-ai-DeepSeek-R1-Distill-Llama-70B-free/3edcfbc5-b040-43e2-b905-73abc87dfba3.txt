Question:

In summer squash, spheroid fruit genes are dominant over genes for elongated fruit. A cross between two different homozygous spheroid-fruited varieties results in the following F_2: 89 disc62 spheroid11elongated Ascertain the fit of this data to a reasonable modified dihybrid ratio using chi-square analysis. Explain the pattern of inheritance, the F_1 genotype and phenotype, and the F_2 genotypes .

Options:

A: The pattern of inheritance is codominance at one locus and complete dominance at the other.
B: The data fits a 15:1 ratio, suggesting that one gene is completely dominant over the other and that there is no interaction between genes.
C: The data fits a 3:1 ratio
D: The data fits a 9:6:1 ratio with a 90 percent probability. There is complete dominance at both gene loci. Interaction between two dominants produces a new disc phenotype.
E: The data fits a 12:3:1 ratio indicating dominant epistasis.
F: The data fits a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is the expected ratio for a typical dihybrid cross with no gene interaction.
G: There is incomplete dominance at both gene loci
H: Interaction between two recessive genes produces a new disc phenotype
I: The data fits a 1:2:1 ratio suggesting incomplete dominance and no epistasis.
J: The F_2 genotypes indicate multiple alleles are involved at one gene locus.

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about summer squash and the shape of their fruits. It says that spheroid fruit genes are dominant over elongated ones. So, dominant means that if a plant has the allele for spheroid (let's say 'S'), it'll show the spheroid trait. Elongated would be recessive, so 's' maybe.

The setup is a cross between two different homozygous spheroid varieties. Wait, if both parents are homozygous for spheroid, what does that mean for their genotypes? Homo means same, so they must both have two copies of the dominant allele. So each parent is SS, right?

But wait, the F2 data is given as 89 disc, 62 spheroid, and 11 elongated. Hmm, wait, that adds up to 89+62+11=162. So in F2, there are three phenotypes: disc, spheroid, and elongated. Interesting. Because when I think about a typical dihybrid cross, I usually expect four phenotypes, but here it's three. So maybe there's some gene interaction going on here.

The question is about doing a chi-square analysis to see if this data fits a modified dihybrid ratio. So I need to figure out what the expected ratio is and then see if the observed data matches it statistically.

Let's think about the parents. They're both homozygous spheroid, but they're different varieties. So maybe they're homozygous for different genes? Like, if each parent is homozygous for a different gene that contributes to the spheroid shape.

Wait, hold on. Squash fruit shape is determined by two genes, perhaps? So maybe each gene contributes to the shape. Let me think. One gene could be for spheroid versus elongated, and another gene might determine something else, like whether it's disc-shaped or not. Because that's a third phenotype here.

So perhaps the F1 from crossing two homozygous spheroid plants would be something else. Let me outline this:

Assuming two genes, let's say Gene A and Gene B. Both are involved in fruit shape. Let's say that when both dominant alleles are present (A_B_), the fruit is spheroid. If one is recessive, maybe it's elongated. But wait, the data says we have a disc phenotype too.

Wait, maybe it's a case of epistasis. Epistasis is when the expression of one gene is dependent on another gene. Like, one gene masks or modifies the expression of another.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of incomplete dominance, but I don't think so because the F1 from two homozygous parents would typically be homozygous themselves, but that's only if they're the same parents. Wait, the parents are two different homozygous varieties. Oh, wait, perhaps each is homozygous for a different gene. Like, one is AA and the other is aa for Gene A, and perhaps in Gene B, they have different homozygosity.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again. The parents are both spheroid, but when crossed, their F1 might produce an F2 where three phenotypes appear. So perhaps each parent is homozygous for a different gene. Like, Parent 1 is homozygous for Gene A (AA) and Parent 2 is homozygous for Gene B (BB), but perhaps in their F1, they combine to AaBb or something. Or maybe it's more like each parent is homozygous for different alleles of the same gene, but that wouldn't produce new phenotypes unless there's more to it.

Wait, no. The parents are both spheroid, but they're different homozygous varieties. So maybe each has a different homozygous genotype for two genes. Let's say the first parent is AABB and the second is aabb. Wait, but that wouldn't make sense because if both are spheroid, perhaps only one gene determines spheroid versus elongated. Alternatively, maybe each is homozygous for one gene but heterozygous for another. But the question says they're both homozygous, so maybe each is homozygous for a different gene.

Wait, perhaps the two parents are homozygous for different traits. For example, suppose there are two genes involved: one for spheroid (S) vs. elongated (s), and another for disc (D) vs. not (d). But I'm not sure how that would interact.

Alternatively, maybe the spheroid shape is dominant, and when two recessive alleles are present, you get elongated. But that's just a single gene. But the F2 has three phenotypes, which suggests two genes. So perhaps two genes are involved, each contributing to the shape.

Wait, maybe it's a 9:6:1 ratio. Let me think: a typical dihybrid cross with two genes (independent assortment, no epistasis) gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But if some phenotypes are merging, maybe it becomes 9:6:1. For example, if the presence of either dominant allele A or B leads to one phenotype, and only when both are recessive do you get another. Wait, but in our case, we have three phenotypes, not two. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at the F2 data: 89 disc, 62 spheroid, 11 elongated. So the ratio is roughly 89:62:11. Let me compute the approximate ratio. 89 is about 8 parts, 62 about 5.5, and 11 about 1. So maybe it's close to 8:5:1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the expected ratio is 15:1, but that's when one gene is epistatic over the other, such as in dominant epistasis where one dominant allele masks the other gene entirely, leading to two phenotypes. But here, we have three, so that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one gene is epistatic in a recessive manner. So when both recessive alleles are present (like aa), it might produce a different phenotype. Let me think: if A is epistatic and only when aa do you get a different phenotype. So, let's say A_B_ gives spheroid, A_bb gives spheroid, aaB_ gives disc, and aabb gives elongated. So the F2 ratio would be 9 spheroid (A_B_), 3 disc (aaB_), 3 spheroid (A_bb), and 1 elongated (aabb). Wait, but that would be 12 spheroid, 3 disc, 1 elongated. So the ratio would be 12:3:1. But the data is 89:62:11. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the correct ratio is 9:6:1. Let me think: 9 +6 +1 = 16. So 9/16, 6/16, 1/16. So 9:6:1. How would that happen? Maybe when both dominant alleles are present, it's one phenotype, when one dominant is present, another, and both recessive, the third. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two genes interact such that when either A or B is present, it's spheroid, when A is present and B is not, disc, and when both are recessive, elongated. So A_ B_: spheroid, A_ bb: disc, aa __: elongated. But then, the ratio would be (9+3+3) for spheroid, 3 for disc, and 1 for elongated. Wait, that would be 15:3:1. Hmm, but the observed data doesn't match that.

Wait, in the observed data, disc is the highest, followed by spheroid, then elongated. So disc is 89, which is the largest, then spheroid at 62, then elongated at 11. So the ratio is approximately disc: spheroid: elongated as 8:5.5:1.

Wait, another possibility: maybe each gene contributes additively, so that when both are present, you get spheroid, when one is present, you get disc, and when neither is present, elongated. So the ratio would be 9:6:1, which is 9 (A_B_) : 6 (A_bb + aaB_) : 1 (aabb). So in that case, the F2 would have three phenotypes: spheroid (9), disc (6), and elongated (1). But wait, in the observed data, disc is higher than spheroid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the phenotypes. Let me try to model this. Let's say Gene A and Gene B both contribute to the fruit shape. Only when both dominant alleles (A and B) are present does the fruit become spheroid. If either A or B is not present, it's disc-shaped, and if neither is present, it's elongated. Wait, that doesn't make sense because in that case, A_B_ would be spheroid, A_bb and aaB_ would be disc, and aabb would be elongated. So the ratio would be 9:6:1 (since A_B_ is 9, A_bb and aaB_ are 3 each, so 6 together, and aabb is 1). So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 spheroid : 6 disc : 1 elongated. 

But in the observed data, the disc is higher than spheroid (89 vs 62). So in the expected ratio, spheroid would be higher than disc. But in the data, disc is higher. So this model doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the disc phenotype occurs when only one of the genes is homozygous recessive. Let me think differently. Suppose that the disc shape occurs when both A and B are present, spheroid when only A is present, and elongated when only B is present. No, that's getting complicated. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the F1 is double heterozygous, like AaBb. Then in F2, it would produce a certain ratio. Let's think about the F1. If the parents are both homozygous spheroid but different varieties, perhaps F1 is AaBb. Then, when they self, F2 would be AaBb x AaBb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the two genes. But that would produce four phenotypes unless some phenotypes are merging.

Wait, but in the data, there are three phenotypes, which suggests that two of the four possible phenotypic categories are merging. So perhaps when A is present, regardless of B, one phenotype occurs. Or maybe when B is present, regardless of A, another phenotype.

Wait, another angle. The question mentions that spheroid is dominant over elongated. So perhaps one gene (S/s) controls spheroid vs elongated, and another gene (D/d) controls disc vs not. But I'm not sure how that would interact.

Wait, let me think about the possible F1 and F2. Since the parents are both homozygous spheroid, but different varieties, perhaps each contributes a different gene. For example, Parent 1 is SS DD, and Parent 2 is ss dd. Wait, but then their F1 would be Ss Dd. Then F2 would be (Ss x Ss) x (Dd x Dd), which is 3:1 for S and 3:1 for D. But if the two are independent, the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in the observed data, it's three phenotypes. So perhaps the phenotypic ratios are merging in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the F1 is homozygous for one gene and heterozygous for another. Or maybe both are heterozygous. Wait, but the parents are both homozygous, so F1 would be heterozygous for both genes only if each parent is homozygous for different alleles.

Wait, maybe each parent is homozygous for different genes. Like, Parent 1 is AABB and Parent 2 is aabb. Then F1 would be AaBb. Then F2 would be AaBb x AaBb, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But again, four phenotypes, not three. So perhaps some of the phenotypes are the same. For example, if A_B_ is spheroid, A_bb is disc, aaB_ is spheroid, and aabb is elongated. Then the ratio would be (9 + 3) : 3 : 1 → 12:3:1. But the observed data is 89:62:11, which isn't matching 12:3:1.

Wait, maybe the correct ratio is 9:6:1. Let me think again: if A_B_ is spheroid, A_bb and aaB_ are disc, and aabb is elongated. So spheroid would be 9, disc would be 3+3=6, and elongated 1. So ratio 9:6:1. But the observed data is disc (89) > spheroid (62) > elongated (11). So disc is higher than spheroid, which in the expected ratio is the opposite. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the phenotypes wrong. What if when both dominant alleles are present, you get disc, when only one dominant, spheroid, and when none, elongated. So A_B_ → disc, A_bb or aaB_ → spheroid, aabb → elongated. Then the ratio would be 9 disc : 6 spheroid : 1 elongated. That would fit the observed data, because disc is higher than spheroid. So in the F2, 9/16 are disc, 6/16 spheroid, and 1/16 elongated.

Looking at the observed numbers: 89 disc, 62 spheroid, 11 elongated. The expected numbers under 9:6:1 would be (assuming 16 parts):

Total = 162 → each part is 162/16 ≈ 10.125.

Expected:

- Disc: 9 * 10.125 ≈ 91.125
- Spheroid: 6 * 10.125 ≈ 60.75
- Elongated: 1 * 10.125 ≈ 10.125

The observed are 89 disc, 62 spheroid, 11 elongated. These are very close to the expected, so the data fits a 9:6:1 ratio.

Now, what does that ratio indicate about the genetic interaction? It suggests that two genes are involved, and that their interaction produces three phenotypes. The 9:6:1 ratio is a modified dihybrid ratio, which usually comes from dominant epistasis. Wait, no, dominant epistasis gives a 12:3:1 ratio. Recessive epistasis would give 9:3:4, I think. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, 9:6:1 is when one gene is epistatic in a recessive manner. Let me think: if gene A is epistatic to gene B in a recessive way. So, when A is present (A_), the phenotype is determined by B. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic gene only shows its effect when homozygous recessive. So if the genotype at locus A is aa, then the phenotype is disc, regardless of B. Otherwise, the phenotype depends on B. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, in this scenario, A_B_ would be disc, A_bb would be spheroid, aaB_ would be something else, and aabb would be elongated. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the correct way to think about it is that when both A and B are present, you get disc. If either A or B is not present, you get spheroid. And when neither is present, elongated. So A_B_ → disc, A_bb → spheroid, aaB_ → spheroid, aabb → elongated. That would give a 9:6:1 ratio because A_B_ is 9, A_bb and aaB_ are 3 each, totaling 6, and aabb is 1.

So in this case, the presence of both A and B leads to disc. Presence of A without B or B without A leads to spheroid, and absence of both leads to elongated.

This would mean that the two genes are involved in the pathway, and both are necessary to produce the disc phenotype. So it's a case of recessive epistasis perhaps, where the double presence of dominant alleles produces a new phenotype.

Now, the F1 would have the genotype AaBb, because each parent was homozygous for different genes. So if Parent 1 is AABB and Parent 2 is aabb, their F1 would be AaBb. Then F2 would result from AaBb x AaBb, leading to the 9:6:1 ratio as above.

So the F1 phenotype would be disc, because it has both A and B (AaBb).

The F2 phenotypes would be disc (A_B_), spheroid (A_bb or aaB_), and elongated (aabb).

In terms of the options, looking at the choices:

Option D: The data fits a 9:6:1 ratio with a 90 percent probability. There is complete dominance at both gene loci. Interaction between two dominants produces a new disc phenotype.

Yes, that matches what I thought. So option D would be correct.

Now, let's look at the other options to make sure. 

Option E says 12:3:1, which is dominant epistasis, but that usually gives two phenotypes, not three. So probably not.

Option B: 15:1, which would suggest that one gene is epistatic, but that would only produce two phenotypes, which doesn't fit the three here.

Option F: 9:3:3:1, which is the standard dihybrid without interaction, but that's four phenotypes, not three. So no.

Option A: Codominance at one locus and complete dominance at another. That would probably lead to more than three phenotypes, maybe.

Option H: Interaction between two recessive genes. Hmm, maybe, but the ratio doesn't fit. The 9:6:
