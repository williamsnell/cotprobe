Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and charges on a conducting sphere. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is about finding the net charge on a conducting sphere based on the electric field at a certain distance from its center.

So the sphere has a radius of 10 cm, and the electric field is measured at 15 cm from the center. Wait, 15 cm is outside the sphere because the radius is 10 cm. Right, because conductors have their charges on the surface, so outside the sphere, the electric field should behave as if all the charge were at the center. Oh, right, that's Gauss's Law stuff.

The electric field is given as 3.0e3 N/C and it's directed radially inward. Inward direction means the field is pointing towards the center, so the charge must be negative because electric fields point towards negative charges.

So the formula for electric field outside a charged sphere (since it's a conductor, the charge is on the surface) is E = (kQ)/r². Wait, but wait, r here is the distance from the center where the field is measured, right? So in this case, r is 15 cm, which is 0.15 meters. And E is 3e3 N/C.

So I can rearrange the formula to solve for Q. Q equals E * r² / k. What's k? Coulomb's constant, I think it's about 8.988e9 N·m²/C², but sometimes approximated as 9e9 for simplicity.

Let me plug in the numbers. E is 3e3, r is 0.15 m. So r squared is 0.15^2 = 0.0225 m². Multiply that by E: 3e3 * 0.0225 = 67.5. Then divide by k, which is 9e9. So Q = 67.5 / 9e9 = let's see. 67.5 divided by 9 is 7.5. So 7.5 divided by 1e9 is 7.5e-9 C. Oh wait, that's 7.5 nC. But wait, the field is directed inward, which means the charge is negative. So Q is -7.5e-9 C, which is -7.5 nC.

Looking at the options, option D is -7.5 nC. So the answer should be D.

Wait, did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check. Radius is 10 cm, distance r is 15 cm, so yes, outside. Using E = kQ/r². Yes, E is 3e3, r is 0.15 m. Calculations: 0.15^2 is 0.0225. 3e3 * 0.0225 is 67.5. 67.5 / 9e9 is indeed 7.5e-9. And the charge is negative because E is inward. So yes, D is correct.

To determine the net charge on the conducting sphere, we use the formula for the electric field outside a charged sphere:

\[
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
\]

Here:
- \( E = 3.0 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{N/C} \) (electric field magnitude),
- \( r = 0.15 \, \mathrm{m} \) (distance from the center where the field is measured),
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) (Coulomb's constant, approximated as \( 9.0 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) for simplicity),
- \( Q \) is the net charge on the sphere.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( Q \):

\[
Q = \frac{E \cdot r^2}{k}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( r^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 \, \mathrm{m^2} \),
- \( E \cdot r^2 = (3.0 \times 10^3) \cdot 0.0225 = 67.5 \),
- \( Q = \frac{67.5}{9.0 \times 10^9} = 7.5 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} = 7.5 \, \mathrm{nC} \).

Since the electric field is directed radially inward, the charge must be negative. Thus, the net charge on the sphere is:

\[
Q = -7.5 \, \mathrm{nC}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: \(-7.5 \, \mathrm{nC}\)**

Answer: D
