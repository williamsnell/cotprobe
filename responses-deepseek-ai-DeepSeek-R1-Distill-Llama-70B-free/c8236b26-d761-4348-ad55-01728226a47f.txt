Okay, so I've got this problem here about minimizing the surface area of a right-circular cylinder with a fixed volume. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my calculus, but let me try to work through this.

Alright, the problem is about finding the ratio of the radius R to the height H that minimizes the surface area, given that the volume V is fixed. So I remember that for optimization problems like this, calculus, specifically derivatives, are the way to go. I think I'll need to express the surface area in terms of one variable and then find its minimum by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

First, let me write down what I know. The volume V of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πR²H. And the surface area A of a right-circular cylinder (which includes the top and bottom circles) is A = 2πR² + 2πRH. Wait, but sometimes depending on the problem, the surface area might exclude the top or bottom, but the question says "surface area," so I think it includes both.

But wait, I think when people talk about minimizing the surface area for a fixed volume, they often end up with a cylinder where the height is twice the radius or something like that. But I'm not sure, so let me do the math properly.

Since the volume is fixed, I can express H in terms of R and V. From V = πR²H, solving for H gives H = V/(πR²). That way, I can substitute H into the surface area formula, so that A becomes a function of R only.

So substituting H into A: A(R) = 2πR² + 2πR*(V/(πR²)). Let me simplify this. The second term becomes 2πR * V/(πR²) = 2V/(R). So A(R) = 2πR² + (2V)/R.

Now, to find the minimum, I need to take the derivative of A with respect to R and set it to zero. Let's compute dA/dR.

The derivative of 2πR² with respect to R is 4πR. The derivative of (2V)/R with respect to R is -2V/R². So overall, dA/dR = 4πR - (2V)/R².

Setting this equal to zero for minimization: 4πR = (2V)/R². Let's solve for R.

Multiply both sides by R²: 4πR^3 = 2V. Then divide both sides by 4π: R^3 = (2V)/(4π) → R^3 = V/(2π).

Hmm, but I want to relate R and H. I know that H = V/(πR²). Let's substitute R^3 from the previous equation. Since R^3 = V/(2π), then R^3 = V/(2π) → V = 2πR^3.

Substituting V back into H: H = (2πR^3) / (πR²) ) → H = 2R. So H equals 2R, which means R = H/2.

Wait, so the ratio R/H is (H/2)/H = 1/2. So R/H is 1/2. So the ratio R to H is 1:2, meaning R = (1/2) H.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I mix up ratios. So R is half of H. So the ratio R/H is 1/2. So the answer should be option A, which is (1/2)H.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra. Let me go back.

From 4πR = 2V/R² → 4πR^3 = 2V → R^3 = (2V)/(4π) → R^3 = V/(2π). So V = 2π R^3.

Then H = V/(π R²) = (2π R^3) / (π R²) )= 2 R.

So yes, H = 2R → R = H/2.

Thus, R/H = 1/2. So the ratio is 1/2, which is option A.

To find the ratio of the radius \( R \) to the height \( H \) of a right-circular cylinder with a fixed volume \( V \) that minimizes the surface area \( A \), we start by expressing the volume and surface area in terms of \( R \) and \( H \). The volume is given by:

\[
V = \pi R^2 H
\]

From this, we can solve for \( H \) in terms of \( R \) and \( V \):

\[
H = \frac{V}{\pi R^2}
\]

The surface area \( A \) of the cylinder (including the top and bottom) is:

\[
A = 2\pi R^2 + 2\pi R H
\]

Substituting \( H = \frac{V}{\pi R^2} \) into the surface area formula gives:

\[
A(R) = 2\pi R^2 + \frac{2V}{R}
\]

To minimize \( A \), we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( R \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{dA}{dR} = 4\pi R - \frac{2V}{R^2}
\]

Setting \( \frac{dA}{dR} = 0 \):

\[
4\pi R = \frac{2V}{R^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
4\pi R^3 = 2V \quad \Rightarrow \quad R^3 = \frac{V}{2\pi}
\]

Thus:

\[
R = \left(\frac{V}{2\pi}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \( R^3 = \frac{V}{2\pi} \) into \( H = \frac{V}{\pi R^2} \):

\[
H = \frac{\pi R^2}{\pi R^2} \cdot \frac{V}{\pi R^2} = 2R
\]

This shows that \( H = 2R \), or equivalently \( R = \frac{H}{2} \). Therefore, the ratio \( \frac{R}{H} \) is:

\[
\frac{R}{H} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

This corresponds to option **A**.
