Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to function composition and inverses, but I'll try to work through it methodically.

So, the problem says we have two functions: f(x) = 3x + 4 and g(x) = 2x - 3. We're supposed to find h(x) which is the composition of f and g, meaning h(x) = f(g(x)). After finding h(x), we need to determine its inverse.

First, I remember that function composition means plugging one function into another. So f(g(x)) means I substitute g(x) wherever there's an x in f(x). Let me write that out.

f(g(x)) = 3*(g(x)) + 4. Since g(x) is 2x -3, substituting gives 3*(2x -3) +4. Let's compute that.

3*(2x) is 6x, and 3*(-3) is -9. So, 6x -9 +4. Combining like terms, that's 6x -5. So h(x) = 6x -5.

Now, the next step is finding the inverse of h(x). I'm a bit fuzzy on inverses, but I think the inverse function, h⁻¹(x), is the function that undoes h(x). So if h takes x to 6x-5, h⁻¹ should take y back to x.

To find the inverse, I'll set y = h(x), which is y = 6x -5. Then I'll solve this equation for x in terms of y, and then swap x and y to get the inverse function.

So starting with y = 6x -5.

First, add 5 to both sides: y +5 = 6x.

Then, divide both sides by 6: (y +5)/6 = x.

So, x is (y +5)/6. Therefore, the inverse function h⁻¹(y) is (y +5)/6. But usually, we write functions in terms of x, so replacing y with x gives h⁻¹(x) = (x +5)/6.

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Start with h(x) = 6x -5.

Set y = 6x -5.

Add 5 to both sides: y +5 =6x.

Divide by 6: x = (y +5)/6.

So the inverse is h⁻¹(y) = (y +5)/6. Then, replacing y with x (since functions are typically written as f(x)), it becomes h⁻¹(x) = (x +5)/6.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option H is (x +5)/6. Option G is (x +5)/3. So, H is the one that matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial composition. Let me compute h(x) again.

h(x) = f(g(x)).

f(x) =3x+4, so f(g(x)) =3*(g(x)) +4.

g(x) is 2x-3, so 3*(2x-3) is 6x-9. Adding 4 gives 6x -5. Yes, that's correct.

So the inverse is (x +5)/6, which is option H.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we start by finding the composition of the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Given \( f(x) = 3x + 4 \) and \( g(x) = 2x - 3 \), the composition \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \) is computed as follows:

\[
h(x) = f(g(x)) = f(2x - 3) = 3(2x - 3) + 4 = 6x - 9 + 4 = 6x - 5.
\]

Next, we need to find the inverse of \( h(x) \), denoted as \( h^{-1}(x) \). To do this, we start with the equation:

\[
y = 6x - 5.
\]

Solving for \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
y + 5 = 6x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{y + 5}{6}.
\]

Thus, the inverse function is:

\[
h^{-1}(x) = \frac{x + 5}{6}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, we see that it matches option H: \( \frac{x + 5}{6} \).
