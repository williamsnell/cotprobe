Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, it's about a ladder leaning against a building. The foot of the ladder is moving away at 3 feet per second. I need to find how fast the top is moving down when the foot is 10 feet away.

Alright, I remember this is a related rates problem. So, I should probably start by drawing a diagram. Let me visualize it: the ladder is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The two legs are the distance from the building (let's call that x) and the height on the building (let's say y). The ladder's length is 26 feet, which doesn't change because it's just leaning, not stretching or shrinking.

So, the Pythagorean theorem applies here. x squared plus y squared equals 26 squared. So, x² + y² = 676.

Now, the problem gives me the rate at which the foot is moving away, which is dx/dt. It says dx/dt is 3 feet per second. I need to find dy/dt when x is 10 feet.

Wait, right. So, I should differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t to relate the rates.

Differentiating x² gives 2x dx/dt, and differentiating y² gives 2y dy/dt. The derivative of 676 is zero because it's a constant. So, putting it together: 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0.

Hmm, simplifying that, I can divide both sides by 2: x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0. Then, solving for dy/dt: dy/dt = - (x/y) dx/dt.

Wait, but I need to find dy/dt when x is 10. So I need to find y at that moment. Using the Pythagorean theorem again: when x=10, y = sqrt(26² -10²). Let me calculate that.

26 squared is 676, and 10 squared is 100. So 676 - 100 is 576. The square root of 576 is 24. So y=24 when x=10.

Okay, so plugging back into dy/dt: dy/dt = - (10/24) * 3. Let me compute that. 10/24 is 5/12. Multiply by 3 gives (5/12)*3 = 5/4. But wait, there's a negative sign, so dy/dt is -5/4. But the question asks for the rate at which the top is moving down, which would be the absolute value. So r is 5/4.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I mix up x and y anywhere? Let me see: x is the base, moving away, dx/dt is positive 3. The top is moving down, so dy/dt is negative. But when I plug in, I get dy/dt as -5/4, which would mean the top is moving down at 5/4 ft/s. So r is 5/4. Let me look at the options. Option C is 5/4. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing it as a related rates problem involving a right triangle. The ladder, building, and ground form a right triangle where the ladder is the hypotenuse (26 feet), the distance of the ladder's foot from the building is \( x \), and the height of the ladder on the building is \( y \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 26^2 = 676.
\]

We are given that the foot of the ladder is moving away from the building at a rate of \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 3 \, \text{ft/s} \). The goal is to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down, \( \frac{dy}{dt} \), when \( x = 10 \, \text{ft} \).

First, differentiate both sides of the Pythagorean equation with respect to time \( t \):

\[
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0.
\]

Simplify by dividing through by 2:

\[
x \frac{dx}{dt} + y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0.
\]

Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dt} \):

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{x}{y} \frac{dx}{dt}.
\]

At the moment when \( x = 10 \, \text{ft} \), we calculate \( y \) using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
y = \sqrt{26^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{676 - 100} = \sqrt{576} = 24 \, \text{ft}.
\]

Substitute \( x = 10 \), \( y = 24 \), and \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 3 \) into the equation for \( \frac{dy}{dt} \):

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{10}{24} \cdot 3 = -\frac{30}{24} = -\frac{5}{4}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that the top of the ladder is moving downward. The rate at which the top is moving down is therefore \( \frac{5}{4} \, \text{ft/s} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: \( \frac{5}{4} \)**.
