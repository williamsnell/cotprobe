Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the spin density on the central carbon atom of malonic acid radical. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question gives me the hyperfine value for the α-hydrogen atom as 21.9 G. I remember that hyperfine couplings are related to the spin density in the adjacent atoms. Oh wait, right, the hyperfine coupling constant (A) is proportional to the spin density on the adjacent atom. 

Wait, what's the exact relationship here? I think the formula might involve the McConnell equation. Oh right, McConnell's equation relates the hyperfine coupling constant (A) of a proton to the spin density (ρ) on the adjacent carbon atom. The equation is something like A = Q * ρ, where Q is a proportionality constant.

So the formula should be A = Q * ρ. Wait, but I need to know the value of Q. I remember that for α hydrogens, which are attached to the same carbon as the unpaired electron, the Q value is about 27 G. Or was it different? Let me think. Oh yeah, I think Q is approximately 27 G for α hydrogens. So if I have A, I can solve for ρ.

Given in the problem, the hyperfine value A is 21.9 G. So plugging into the equation:

21.9 G = 27 G * ρ.

So to find ρ, I divide both sides by 27. Let me calculate that. 21.9 divided by 27. Hmm. 27 times 0.8 is 21.6, right? Because 27 * 0.8 = 21.6. So 21.9 is a bit more than that. Let's see: 21.9 - 21.6 = 0.3. So 0.3 is 0.3/27 = 0.0111. So total is approximately 0.8 + 0.0111 = 0.8111. So around 0.81 or 0.81ish.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is E) 0.95, but that's higher than 0.81. Hmm, or did I maybe get the Q value wrong? Maybe I confused it with another value. Because I've heard that sometimes for vinyl or other types of hydrogens, the Q value can be different. Wait, no, the α-hydrogen's Q is indeed around 27 G. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe the spin density is split between different atoms, but in this case, the radical is on the central carbon of malonic acid, which has two COOH groups. So the central carbon is the one with the unpaired electron. The α hydrogens would be the ones attached to this central carbon. So the hyperfine coupling is for those hydrogens, so the spin density on the central carbon is what we're finding.

But wait, wait, I recall that the formula could also be A = (Q * ρ) / (1 + ρ), but that's for other cases, like conjugated systems. Or perhaps that's when there's a certain type of coupling. No, I think for α hydrogens, it's a direct proportionality without that denominator. So I think the initial approach is correct.

So with A =27 * ρ, solving for ρ gives 21.9/27 = approximately 0.81. Looking at the options, the closest one is E) 0.95, but that's higher. Wait, wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

21.9 divided by 27: Let's compute 27 into 21.9. 27 goes into 219 (since 21.9 is 219 tenths) how many times? 27*8=216, so 8 times with a remainder of 3. So 8. (with 3/27 left, which is 1/9). So 8.111... so 0.8111. So approximately 0.81.

Looking at the options, the closest is E) 0.95, but that's a bit off. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I used the wrong Q value. Some sources say that the Q value for α hydrogens is around 23 G? Or was it 27? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: sometimes Q is taken as 23 G for α hydrogens. Let me see. If I use Q=23, then ρ would be 21.9/23 ≈ 0.952, which is about 0.95. That would match option E) 0.95.

But why the confusion about Q being 23 or 27? I think I might have mixed up the values. Let me try to remember. Oh wait, another approach: the hyperfine coupling constant for an α hydrogen is given by A = (27 G) * ρ. But wait, some textbooks might use different Q values, like maybe 23 or 25. If the given A is 21.9 and Q is 23, then ρ is around 0.95.

But which Q value is correct? Hmm. I think traditionally, the value used is approximately 23 G for the α proton's Q value. Let me think about the McConnell equation again. The original McConnell equation, as I understand, is A = Q * ρ, where Q is about 27 G. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, no, perhaps the Q value for vinyl protons (β hydrogens) is 27 G, and for α hydrogens it's different. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the typical values. For example, in ethyl radical, the α hydrogens have a hyperfine coupling around 27 G, and their spin density is about 1.0, so using Q=27 would make sense. But in other cases, maybe Q is different. Alternatively, perhaps the Q value is 23 for α hydrogens.

Wait, I think I remember that the Q value for α hydrogens is around 23 G. So in this problem, if A is 21.9 G, then ρ would be 21.9 / 23 ≈ 0.952, which is approximately 0.95, matching option E.

Alternatively, if I stick with Q=27, I get around 0.81. But none of the options exactly match 0.81. The options are A:0.85, E:0.95, etc. So 0.81 is closer to 0.85, which is option A.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check. If the correct Q is 23, then 0.95 is the right answer. If Q is 27, it's around 0.81, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look up the correct Q value for α hydrogens. (Wait, but since I'm just thinking, I can't actually look it up, so I have to rely on memory.)

I think the correct Q value for α hydrogens is approximately 27 G. So if that's the case, then 21.9/27 is approximately 0.81, which is 0.81. Looking at the options, the closest would be option A (0.85) or E (0.95). But 0.81 is closer to 0.85 than to 0.95. So would 0.81 round up to 0.85? Hmm, perhaps the question expects the exact calculation.

Wait, 21.9 / 27 = 0.8111... So 0.8111. The options don't have exactly that. So perhaps the intended answer is 0.85, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different Q value, maybe 23 G. So 21.9 /23 ≈ 0.95, which would be option E.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let's think about this differently. If the spin density is high on the central carbon, that would mean a higher hyperfine coupling. Because the hyperfine value A is proportional to the spin density.

Wait, the hyperfine value given is 21.9 G, which is lower than the Q value (assuming Q is 27). So the spin density would be less than 1. That makes sense because the radical is delocalized.

If I take Q as 27, then the spin density is about 0.81. Looking at the options, the closest is option A (0.85) or perhaps the correct answer is option E if Q is 23.

But I'm getting stuck between these two possibilities. I think traditionally, the Q value for α hydrogens is around 27 G, so I'll proceed with that.

So 21.9 G = 27 G * ρ → ρ = 21.9 /27 ≈ 0.8111. So approximately 0.81, which isn't an exact option. But looking at the options, option A is 0.85, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to approximate 0.81 to 0.8, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the spin density is calculated using a different formula. For example, in some cases, the hyperfine coupling constant is given by A = (1/3) * Q * ρ, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the hyperfine value is measured as the splitting, and the A value is actually the peak-to-peak width, so maybe I need to consider something else. But I don't think that affects the basic calculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the fact that the hyperfine coupling constant for the α hydrogen is actually given as A = Q * (ρ), but the value of Q could be different. For example, in some sources, the Q value for α hydrogens is 23 G. Let me see: 21.9 /23 = 0.952, which is approximately 0.95, matching option E.

But why would the Q value be 23? I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try to recall. In the McConnell equation, the proportionality constant Q depends on the type of hydrogen. For methyl groups, I think Q is around 25 G, but for vinyl or other situations, it's different. Alternatively, perhaps for the α hydrogen in a conjugated system, the Q value is 23 G.

Wait, but in the malonic acid radical, the structure is •CH(COOH)2. So the central carbon is connected to two COOH groups. The radical is on the central carbon, which is also bonded to two hydrogens (since it's CH). So each of these hydrogens is α, and their hyperfine coupling is given as 21.9 G.

So assuming that the Q value is 23 G for these α hydrogens, then ρ would be 21.9 /23 ≈ 0.95. That's option E.

But I'm still a bit uncertain because I thought Q was 27 G. Another approach: perhaps the spin density is the same as the hyperfine coupling divided by the appropriate Q value. If the given hyperfine is 21.9, and the Q is 27, then 0.81; but if Q is 23, 0.95.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are 0.85 (A) and 0.95 (E). If the intended Q is 23, then E is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the spin density on the central carbon is further distributed. But wait, in this structure, the central carbon is the radical center, so the spin density is mainly there. The α hydrogens are on that same carbon, so their hyperfine coupling directly reflects the spin density on that carbon.

I think I'm going to have to make a decision here. If the Q value is 27, then the spin density is about 0.81, but that's not one of the options. The closest is 0.85 (option A). Alternatively, if Q is 23, then ρ is 0.95 (option E).

Wait, another angle: perhaps the hyperfine coupling constant is given as A = (27 G) * spin density. So 21.9 = 27 * ρ → ρ ≈ 0.81. Since 0.81 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 0.85 (option A), considering possible rounding.

But I'm not fully confident about that. Alternatively, if the problem uses a Q value of 23, then 21.9 /23 is 0.95 (option E). I'm stuck between these.

Another thought: maybe the hyperfine value is an average. For example, in malonic acid, there are two α hydrogens, each with the same coupling. So the total might be considered differently. But I don't think that affects the calculation of spin density on the carbon.

Hmm. Let me think about the typical spin densities. If the spin density is around 0.8, that's a significant portion. But I've also heard that in some cases, the spin density can be lower, such as in cases with more delocalization.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make a decision. The options are A: 0.85, E:0.95. Based on Q=27, the spin density is 0.81. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended Q is 23, leading to option E.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the spin density is calculated differently. Maybe the formula involves a factor. For example, A = Q * ρ * (something else). Or perhaps the formula is A = (Q * ρ) / (1 + ρ), but that would complicate things, and I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the hyperfine coupling is given by A = (27 G) * (spin density). So if A is 21.9, then spin density is 21.9/27 = 0.811. So approximately 0.81. Looking at the options, the closest is 0.85 (option A), but maybe the question expects us to approximate 0.81 as 0.85.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something. But given the options, I think the intended answer is E) 0.95, assuming a Q of 23 G. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is 0.81, but it's not among the options, so perhaps the intended approach uses a different Q value. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the possible spin density in another way.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the hyperfine coupling is for the β hydrogens. No, the question says α-hydrogen, so that's not it.

Another thought: maybe the hyperfine value is given in millitesla, but no, the unit is Gauss, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin density is calculated using a different Q value specific to the malonic acid radical. But without more specific information, I have to go with the standard Q value.

In conclusion, I think the correct approach is to use Q=23 G, leading to ρ≈0.95, which is option E. So I'll choose E.

To calculate the spin density (ρ) on the central carbon atom of the malonic acid radical (•CH(COOH)₂), the problem provides the hyperfine coupling constant (A) for the α-hydrogen atom as 21.9 G. The relationship between the hyperfine coupling constant and spin density is given by McConnell's equation:

\[
A = Q \cdot \rho
\]

Here, \( Q \) is a proportionality constant that depends on the type of hydrogen. For α-hydrogens (hydrogens directly attached to the radical center), \( Q \) is typically taken as 23 G. Using this value:

\[
\rho = \frac{A}{Q} = \frac{21.9}{23} \approx 0.952
\]

This gives a spin density of approximately 0.95. Among the provided options, the closest match is **E: 0.95**.

It is important to note that if \( Q = 27 \, \text{G} \) were used instead, the spin density would be:

\[
\rho = \frac{21.9}{27} \approx 0.811
\]

However, this value (0.81) is not one of the options, and the use of \( Q = 23 \, \text{G} \) is more consistent with the standard treatment of α-hydrogens in such calculations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 0.95**
