Okay, so I've got this statistics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the sampling distribution of sample means. The population has a total cholesterol level that's strongly skewed to the right. The mean is 210 mg/dL, and the standard deviation is 15 mg/dL. They're taking random samples of size 16 repeatedly, and I need to describe the sampling distribution of these sample means.

Hmm, I remember something about the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) from my studies. The CLT says that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, even if the population distribution isn't normal, as long as the sample size is large enough. Oh wait, but wait—what's considered a large enough sample? I think it's usually around 30 or more. Here, the sample size is 16. So is 16 enough for the CLT to kick in?

Wait, the population is strongly skewed right. So the original distribution isn't normal. But the CLT still applies when n is large. But with n=16, I'm not sure. Maybe the sampling distribution won't be perfectly normal, but it should be somewhat normal, right? Or maybe the question expects me to go with the CLT regardless?

I also remember that the mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the population mean. So the mean should be 210 mg/dL. That's straightforward.

For the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, which is the standard error, I think it's calculated as the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. So that would be 15 divided by sqrt(16). The square root of 16 is 4, so 15/4 is 3.75. So the standard error should be 3.75 mg/dL.

Now, about the shape. Since the population is skewed right, but the sample size is 16—would that affect the shape of the sampling distribution? Because the CLT says that as n increases, the sampling distribution becomes more normal, regardless of the population's shape. But with n=16, which is moderate, maybe it's not perfectly normal. But I'm not sure whether the options would consider it as normal or not.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Shape somewhat skewed left, mean 210, SD 3.75. Hmm, why would it skew left? If the population is skewed right, maybe the sampling distribution is less skewed. But I don't think it would reverse direction. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: Strongly skewed left. That seems unlikely for the same reason as A. The sampling distribution shouldn't be more skewed in the opposite direction. So probably not B.

Option C: Approximately normal, mean 210, SD 3.75. This fits with the CLT. Even if n=16 isn't huge, it's probably large enough for the sampling distribution to be approximately normal, especially since the question says "repeatedly drawn" which implies a lot of samples. So C is a strong candidate.

Option D: Approximately normal, mean 200, SD 3.75. No, the mean should stay the same as population mean, which is 210. So D is wrong.

Option E: Strongly skewed right, mean 225. No, because the mean should be 210, and the shape should be more normal than the population. So E is out.

Option F: Approximately normal, mean 210, SD 15. Wait, no. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is 3.75, not 15. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Unknown shape, mean 210, SD 15. No, because the mean is 210, but the SD is 3.75. Also, the shape should be approximately normal because of the CLT, so G is wrong.

Option H: Approximately normal, mean 210, SD 7.5. Hmm, where would 7.5 come from? Oh wait, maybe they used sqrt(16*2)=sqrt(32)~5.66, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe they thought the sample size was 8, so sqrt(8)=2.828, 15/2.828≈5.3. But that's not 7.5. So probably, H is incorrect.

Option I: Somewhat skewed right. Well, if the sample size is 16, maybe the sampling distribution isn't perfectly normal yet. So it might still be a bit skewed but not as much as the population. But the options mention "approximately normal" which I think is the key here. So I'm a bit stuck between C and I.

Option J: Strongly skewed right, mean 210, SD 15. No, because the SD should be 3.75, and the shape should be more normal. So J is wrong.

So now, the main options are C and I. C says approximately normal, I says somewhat skewed right.

Wait, the original population is strongly right-skewed. With a sample size of 16, the CLT would make the sampling distribution more normal, but perhaps not perfectly. So maybe it's still somewhat skewed but not strongly. Or perhaps in the options, 'approximately normal' is acceptable. Because when you take samples of size 16, even if the population is skewed, the CLT would cause the sampling distribution to be somewhat normal.

I'm leaning towards option C because the question states that samples are repeatedly drawn, implying a large number of samples, which would make the distribution more normal. But wait, the number of samples doesn't affect the shape; the sample size (n) does. So n=16, which is moderate. So perhaps the shape is approximately normal.

Another thought: some textbooks might say that for the CLT to apply, n should be at least 30. But others might accept n=16 as sufficient, especially if the population isn't extremely skewed. So if this is an intro question, perhaps they expect option C.

So putting it all together: the sampling distribution has mean 210, SD 3.75, and approximately normal shape. So the correct answer should be option C.

The question involves describing the sampling distribution of sample means for total cholesterol levels in a population that is strongly skewed right. The population has a mean of 210 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 15 mg/dL, with random samples of size 16 repeatedly drawn. 

Key points to consider:

1. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** The CLT states that the sampling distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, regardless of the population's shape, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large. While the sample size of 16 is moderate, it is likely large enough for the CLT to apply, making the sampling distribution approximately normal.

2. **Mean of the Sampling Distribution:** The mean of the sampling distribution will always be equal to the population mean, which is 210 mg/dL.

3. **Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution (Standard Error):** The standard error is calculated as the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Here, it is \( \frac{15}{\sqrt{16}} = 3.75 \) mg/dL.

4. **Shape of the Sampling Distribution:** Although the population is strongly skewed right, the CLT ensures that the sampling distribution will be more normal than the population distribution. With a sample size of 16, the sampling distribution is expected to be approximately normal, even if not perfectly so.

Analysis of the options:

- **Option A and B:** These suggest the shape is skewed left, which is incorrect because the sampling distribution will not reverse the skewness of the population.
- **Option C:** Correctly states that the shape is approximately normal, with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75, consistent with the CLT.
- **Option D:** Incorrect because the mean is stated as 200, which does not match the population mean.
- **Option E:** Incorrect because it suggests the shape is strongly skewed right and the mean is 225, both of which are inconsistent with the CLT.
- **Option F:** Incorrect because it states the standard deviation is 15, which is the population standard deviation, not the standard error.
- **Option G:** Incorrect because it states the shape is unknown and the standard deviation is 15, both of which are inconsistent with the CLT.
- **Option H:** Incorrect because it states the standard deviation is 7.5, which is not consistent with the calculation of the standard error.
- **Option I:** Suggests the shape is somewhat skewed right, but the CLT ensures the sampling distribution will be approximately normal, making this option less accurate than C.
- **Option J:** Incorrect because it suggests the shape is strongly skewed right and the standard deviation is 15, both of which are inconsistent with the CLT.

The best answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the sampling distribution as approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75.
