Okay, so I've got this problem about forced convection in a tube, and I need to find the exit temperature of the air. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's read the problem again. The tube is 1 ft long with an internal diameter of 2 inches. The wall temperature is constant at 80°F. The pressure drop is 0.02 inches of water. The air flows at 20 ft/s, and the entrance temperature is 300°F. The density of air is given as 0.08 lbm/ft³. I need to find the exit temperature.

Wait, I remember that in forced convection, the heat transfer depends on things like the Reynolds number, which tells us if the flow is laminar or turbulent. But I'm not sure how to apply that here. Maybe I should start by calculating the Reynolds number.

Reynolds number (Re) is (velocity * diameter) / kinematic viscosity. But wait, the units here are a mix of imperial and maybe some metric. I need to make sure all units are consistent.

The diameter is 2 inches, which is 2/12 ft = 0.1667 ft. The velocity is 20 ft/s. The density of air is 0.08 lbm/ft³. Oh, right, I also need the viscosity of air. I don't remember the exact value, but I think at around room temperature, the dynamic viscosity of air is about 0.00002 lbm/ft·s. Wait, but temperature might affect that. Since the air is entering at 300°F, which is hotter, the viscosity would be higher. Hmm, I might need to adjust for temperature, but maybe for this problem, they'll consider the viscosity at the film temperature. Film temperature is the average of the wall and bulk temperatures. The wall is at 80°F, and the air starts at 300°F, so maybe the film temp is (300 + 80)/2 = 190°F. I think the viscosity of air increases with temperature, but I'm not exactly sure how. Maybe I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a standard value. Let's proceed with 0.00002 lbm/ft·s for now, but I might have to revisit this if my calculations don't match the options.

So Re = (density * velocity * diameter) / viscosity. Plugging in the numbers: density is 0.08 lbm/ft³, velocity is 20 ft/s, diameter is 0.1667 ft, and viscosity is 0.00002 lbm/ft·s.

Re = (0.08 * 20 * 0.1667) / 0.00002. Let me compute that. 0.08 *20 is 1.6, times 0.1667 is about 0.2667. Divide by 0.00002: 0.2667 / 0.00002 = 13,335. So Re is approximately 13,335. Now, I remember that Re above 4000 is turbulent. So this flow is turbulent.

In turbulent flow, the Nusselt number (Nu) can be calculated using the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3. But wait, I need the Prandtl number (Pr) for air. I think Pr for air is around 0.7 to 0.8. Let me assume Pr = 0.7 for now.

So Nu = 0.023 * (13335)^0.8 * (0.7)^0.3. Hmm, calculating exponents can be tricky. Let's compute (13335)^0.8 first.

Wait, 13335 is approximately 1.3335e4. So log10(13335) is about 4.125. 0.8 * 4.125 is 3.3. 10^3.3 is about 1995 (since 10^3=1000, 10^0.3≈2). So (1e4)^(0.8) would be (1e3.2)= about 1584, but wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of known values. At Re=10,000, which is close to our Re, the Nu is about 25 for Pr=0.7. Wait, maybe I can use a correlation or a table. Alternatively, perhaps I can just proceed with the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 13335^0.8:

Let me take natural logs: ln(13335) ≈ ln(13000) ≈ 9.4727. Multiply by 0.8: 7.5782. Exponentiate: e^7.5782 ≈ 2000. Because e^7 is about 1096, e^7.5 is about 1808, e^7.6 is about 1980, so 7.5782 is around 2000.

So 0.023 * 2000 * (0.7)^0.3.

Now, (0.7)^0.3 is approximately? Let me compute. 0.7^0.3 is e^(0.3 * ln 0.7). ln(0.7)= -0.3567. Multiply by 0.3: -0.107. e^-0.107 ≈ 0.898. So approximately 0.9.

So Nu ≈ 0.023 * 2000 * 0.9 = 0.023 * 1800 = 41.4.

So Nu is about 41.4. Now, Nu is h * D / k, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, D is diameter, and k is thermal conductivity of air.

So h = (Nu * k) / D. I need the thermal conductivity of air. I think at around 300°F (which is roughly 150°C), the thermal conductivity of air is about 0.017 W/m·K. Wait, but we're using imperial units here. Let me convert that. 0.017 W/m·K is roughly 0.0106 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F). Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check the value.

Wait, alternatively, I might remember that at 60°F, the thermal conductivity of air is about 0.013 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F), and it increases with temperature. At higher temps, maybe around 0.015 or 0.017? Hmm, for this problem, perhaps I should use k = 0.014 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F) or something similar. Wait, but maybe I should look up the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a certain value, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed with k = 0.014 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F).

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise. The thermal conductivity of air at 300°F (which is about 427 K) is approximately 0.029 W/m·K. Converting that to imperial units: 1 W/m·K is about 0.5778 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F). So 0.029 W/m·K * 0.5778 ≈ 0.01675 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F). So I'll use k ≈ 0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F).

Now, D is the diameter in feet: 2 inches = 0.1667 ft.

So h = (Nu * k) / D. Plugging in: Nu=41.4, k=0.0168, D=0.1667 ft.

h = (41.4 * 0.0168) / 0.1667.

Compute numerator: 41.4 * 0.0168 ≈ 0.696.

Divide by 0.1667: 0.696 / 0.1667 ≈ 4.176. So h ≈ 4.176 BTU/(ft²·h·°F).

Wait, but wait, units: Let me make sure. Because k is in BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F), and D is in ft. So h would be (unitless * (BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F)) ) / ft. So that's (BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F)) / ft = BTU/(ft³·h·°F). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Did I mess up the units?

Wait, no, let me think again. Nu is h * D / k. So h = (Nu * k) / D. The units of h would be ( (unitless) * (k units) ) / (D units). So k is BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F), D is ft. So h = ( (BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F)) ) / ft. So that's BTU/(ft³·h·°F). Hmm, but that's not the standard unit for h, which is usually BTU/(ft²·h·°F). Wait, that suggests I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of k. Let me double-check. Thermal conductivity in metric is W/(m·K), which is equivalent to (J/s)/(m·K). To convert to imperial units, 1 W/(m·K) is approximately 0.57782 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F). So that part was correct. So, perhaps the issue is that in the formula, the diameter should be in inches? Wait, no, because in the formula, all units should be consistent. So if D is in ft, then k is in BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F), which is BTU/(ft·h·°F) per inch? Hmm, maybe I should convert D to inches to match the units of k.

Wait, maybe it's easier to convert everything into inches and hours for consistency. Let me try that approach.

So D is 2 inches. So h = (Nu * k) / D, where k is in BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F), D is in inches.

So h = (41.4 * 0.0168) / 2. Wait, wait, no, because k's unit is BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F). So when I multiply by D (in inches), I have to make sure the inches are converted to ft. Because 1 inch = 1/12 ft. So D = 2 inches = 2/12 ft = 1/6 ft.

Wait, maybe it's better to adjust the units before calculation. Let me see:

h = (Nu * k) / D

Nu is unitless.

k is 0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F)

D is 0.1667 ft, which is 2 inches.

So:

h = (41.4 * 0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F)) / 0.1667 ft

The inches in the numerator and the denominator in ft: Let's convert ft to inches. Since 1 ft = 12 in, 0.1667 ft = 2 in. So:

h = (41.4 * 0.0168 * 2 in) ) / (0.1667 ft) * (1 ft / 12 in)

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert k into units of BTU/(ft·h·°F) so that when I multiply by D in ft, I get the correct units.

Wait, k is 0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F). To convert to BTU/(ft·h·°F), I divide by 12 in/ft: 0.0168 / 12 = 0.0014 BTU/(ft·h·°F).

So now, h = (Nu * k) / D = (41.4 * 0.0014) / 0.1667.

Compute numerator: 41.4 * 0.0014 = 0.05796.

Divide by 0.1667: 0.05796 / 0.1667 ≈ 0.3479 BTU/(ft²·h·°F).

Wait, that doesn't seem very high. I thought h would be higher for turbulent flow. Maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using the Dittus-Boelter equation was correct, but maybe I should have used a different Prandtl number. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the viscosity correction for temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the energy balance equation.

The problem involves heat transfer from the tube wall to the air, causing the air to cool down as it flows through the tube. But wait, the wall is at a lower temperature than the air, so the air will lose heat, so the exit temperature should be lower than the entrance temperature of 300°F. But looking at the options, I see that the options are all below 300°F, so that makes sense.

The energy balance would be based on the heat lost by the air equals the heat gained from the walls. But wait, more accurately, the heat transfer from the walls to the air would cause the air to lose heat, so the air would cool down.

Wait, no, wait: the wall is at 80°F, and the air enters at 300°F. So the air will lose heat to the wall, so the air will cool. So the exit temperature should be lower than 300°F. But looking at the options, they are all lower than 300°F. So that's correct.

The heat transfer rate can be calculated using Q = h * A * ΔT, where A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference. But since the flow is along the tube, there's a temperature gradient along the tube.

Wait, perhaps I should use the concept of the logarithmic mean temperature difference (LMTD) for a continuous flow situation. But since the flow is at a steady state, perhaps I can model it using the energy equation for the fluid.

The energy equation for a fluid in a tube under steady-state conditions would be:

Q = m * c_p * (T_in - T_out)

Where m is the mass flow rate, c_p is specific heat, and T_in and T_out are the inlet and outlet temperatures.

Q is also equal to the heat transfer from the wall to the fluid, which is Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_avg), but wait, no: actually, the driving temperature difference is from the wall to the fluid. But since the fluid is cooling, the heat lost by the fluid is Q = h * A * (T_avg_fluid - T_wall), where T_avg_fluid is the average fluid temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this using the effectiveness-NTU method. The effectiveness (ε) of a heat exchanger is given by ε = (T_in - T_out) / (T_in - T_wall). The NTU (number of transfer units) is given by NTU = (h * A) / (m * c_p).

But to use that, I need to find m (mass flow rate), c_p (specific heat of air), and A (surface area).

First, let's compute the mass flow rate. The volumetric flow rate Q_dot is velocity * cross-sectional area. The diameter is 2 inches, so radius is 1 inch = 1/12 ft. Area is π r² = π (1/12)^2 = π/144 ≈ 0.0217 ft². Velocity is 20 ft/s, so Q_dot = 0.0217 * 20 ≈ 0.434 ft³/s. Mass flow rate m_dot is density * Q_dot. Density is 0.08 lbm/ft³, so m_dot = 0.08 * 0.434 ≈ 0.0347 lbm/s.

Now, specific heat of air at around 300°F. I think c_p for air is about 0.24 BTU/(lbm·°F). Let me confirm: yes, at low pressures, c_p for air is approximately 0.24 BTU/(lbm·°F).

Next, compute the surface area A. The tube is 1 ft long, and the circumference is π * diameter. Diameter is 2 inches = 0.1667 ft, so circumference is π * 0.1667 ≈ 0.5236 ft. So A = 0.5236 ft * 1 ft = 0.5236 ft².

Now, we have h from earlier, which I calculated as approximately 0.3479 BTU/(ft²·h·°F). Wait, but earlier calculations led to confusion about the units. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute h correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h. Let's retry that. So, Nu = h * D / k → h = Nu * k / D.

Nu is 41.4, D is 0.1667 ft, and k is 0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F). So:

h = 41.4 * 0.0168 / 0.1667.

Wait, but the units here: k is in BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F), D is in ft.

So, h = (41.4) * (0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F)) / 0.1667 ft.

The inches in the numerator and ft in the denominator: 1 ft = 12 inches. So, 0.1667 ft = 2 inches.

So, 0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F) / 0.1667 ft → let's convert 0.1667 ft to inches: 0.1667 * 12 = 2 inches.

So, 0.0168 / 2 = 0.0084 BTU/(ft²·h·°F). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's convert k to BTU/(ft·h·°F):

k = 0.0168 BTU·in/(ft²·h·°F) = 0.0168 / 12 BTU/(ft·h·°F) = 0.0014 BTU/(ft·h·°F
