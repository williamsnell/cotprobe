Question:

Rainmaking Lawfirm regularly purchased its office supplies from catalogs. Marty Manager saw an advertising catalog from Costco offering 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. He immediately sent a purchase order which stated "our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF."¬ù Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated "Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes." If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:

Options:

A: A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.
B: A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.
C: No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.
D: No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.

Alright, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and acceptances. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

So the situation is between Rainmaking Lawfirm and Costco. Marty Manager from Rainmaking saw an ad in a Costco catalog offering 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. He sent a purchase order accepting that offer. Then Costco sent back an order confirmation that added a $50 per thousand loading charge. Now, they're disagreeing about the contract, so the question is what a court would rule.

First, I need to recall some contract law basics. The mirror image rule is important here. Under this rule, the acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer exactly. If the response deviates, it's considered a counteroffer, not an acceptance. That would mean there's no contract unless the original offeror accepts the new terms.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Costco's catalog offer: 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF. CIF stands for Cost, Insurance, and Freight. From what I remember, CIF includes all costs up to delivery, including loading charges. So, the $1,000 should cover everything, right?

2. Rainmaking sent a purchase order stating they accept the $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes CIF. So, their acceptance seems to mirror the offer.

3. Costco then sent an order confirmation adding a $50 per thousand loading charge. That's an extra $500 on top of the $1,000, making it $1,500. But wait, since the original offer was CIF, does that mean loading charges are already included?

If the original offer was CIF, then adding a loading charge might be a new term. So when Rainmaking accepted, they were agreeing to the $1,000 CIF. But Costco's response added an extra charge, which changes the terms. 

Under the mirror image rule, an acceptance that adds new terms is a counteroffer. So, Rainmaking's purchase order was an acceptance, but Costco's response with the loading charge is a counteroffer. Since Rainmaking didn't agree to that, there's no contract unless they accept the new terms.

Wait, but the options are about whether a contract exists or not. Option C says no contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer not accepted. Option D says no contract because the purchase order was the offer, which doesn't fit because the original offer was from Costco.

Wait, let me think again. Who made the offer? Costco's catalog was an offer. Rainmaking's purchase order was an acceptance. Then Costco sent a confirmation with new terms. But is that confirmation an acceptance or a counteroffer?

Wait, the order of events: Offer by Costco, Acceptance by Rainmaking, then Costco sends a confirmation with additional terms. So, after the acceptance, adding new terms might be considered a counteroffer. But once there's an acceptance, does the other party have the power to make a counteroffer? Or does it just modify the contract?

Alternatively, under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies to the sale of goods, the rules are a bit more flexible. The UCC allows for additional terms unless they're material. But in this case, the original agreement was for a specific price, and the additional term is a charge, which affects the price. That's a material term. So, under UCC 2-207, even if the additional terms are proposed, they don't become part of the contract unless accepted.

But wait, in this scenario, the original offer was from Costco, and Rainmaking accepted it. So the contract was formed at that point. Then Costco sends a confirmation with extra charges. So, perhaps that's a proposal to modify the contract. But unless Rainmaking agrees, the modification isn't valid. So, the contract would still be at $1,000.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Option A says contract at $1,000 because CIF includes all charges. That makes sense because CIF would cover loading. So the extra charge shouldn't apply.

Alternatively, if the original offer was CIF, then the $1,000 includes all costs. So when Costco adds a loading charge, that's either a mistake or an attempt to change the terms. If Rainmaking didn't agree, then the contract remains at $1,000.

But the question is about whether a contract exists. The options C and D suggest no contract. But if Rainmaking accepted the offer, then a contract was formed. So options A or B would imply a contract exists, but at different prices.

Wait, let me go back. The original offer: $1,000 CIF. So that includes loading charges. So when Rainmaking accepted, the contract is formed at $1,000. Costco's subsequent confirmation adding $50 per thousand would be an attempt to modify, which Rainmaking hasn't accepted. So the contract remains at $1,000. So the court would rule that the contract is for $1,000.

Looking at the options:

A: Contract at $1,000 because CIF includes all loading charges.

C: No contract because counteroffer.

But wait, the purchase order was an acceptance, forming a contract. So option C would be incorrect because a contract was formed. So the correct answer would be A.

Alternatively, if the mirror image rule applies strictly, and Costco's response was a counteroffer, but since the original contract was already formed, perhaps the counteroffer doesn't negate the existing contract.

Wait, no. Once the contract is formed (when Rainmaking accepted), any subsequent attempt to add terms would require mutual agreement. So the contract exists at $1,000, and the extra charge isn't part of it unless agreed.

So the answer should be A.

But wait, another angle: Did the purchase order include the exact terms? The purchase order stated "our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF." So that's mirroring the offer. So the contract is formed at that point. Then Costco's confirmation adds a term. Under common law, this might be a counteroffer, but since the contract was already formed, perhaps it's just a request to modify, which Rainmaking can ignore.

So the contract is valid at $1,000. So the answer is A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C says no contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer not accepted. But the contract was already formed when Rainmaking accepted the offer. So the subsequent counteroffer doesn't undo the contract. Therefore, a contract exists, so options C and D are incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around contract formation and the terms of the agreement between Rainmaking Lawfirm and Costco. Costco's catalog offered 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight), which inherently includes all costs such as loading charges. Rainmaking accepted this offer in their purchase order, which mirrored the terms of the offer. At this point, a contract was formed at $1,000 under the terms of the offer.

Costco then sent an order confirmation that added a $50 per thousand loading charge, which would increase the total price to $1,500. However, under the mirror image rule, an acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer exactly. By adding a new term (the loading charge), Costco's response constituted a counteroffer. Since Rainmaking did not accept this counteroffer, the additional term is not part of the contract. The original contract remains valid at $1,000 CIF, as the loading charge was already included in the original offer.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The contract is at $1,000 because CIF includes all costs, including loading charges.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The loading charge is already included in the $1,000 CIF price.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. A contract was formed when Rainmaking accepted the offer; Costco's counteroffer does not negate the existing contract.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The purchase order was not the offer; it was the acceptance of Costco's offer.  

Thus, the court would rule that the contract is valid at $1,000 because CIF includes all loading charges.
