Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is asking which proposition is an immediate one-step consequence of the given premises. The premises are:

1. (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q)
2. P ⊃ (N ⊃ ~O)
3. N ⊃ P

And the options are from A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to understand each premise and see how they can lead to a conclusion in one step. I remember that in propositional logic (PL), there are various rules of inference like modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, etc. Maybe one of these can be applied here.

Let me list out the premises again for clarity.

Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)
Premise 2: P → (N → ~O)
Premise 3: N → P

I'm thinking about how these can connect. Maybe I can use premise 3 and premise 2 together. Let's see.

Premise 3 says N → P. So if N is true, then P must be true. Now, looking at premise 2: P → (N → ~O). So if P is true, then N → ~O is true. Wait, but from premise 3, if N is true, then P is true. So combining these two, if N is true, then from premise 3, P is true, and then from premise 2, N → ~O is true. But wait, N → ~O means "if N then not O". But if N is true, then ~O must be true. So from N, we can get ~O via these two premises.

But wait, that's two steps. The question is about an immediate one-step consequence. So maybe I should look for a way to combine these premises in a single step.

Alternatively, maybe I can use hypothetical syllogism. Hypothetical syllogism is when you have (A → B) and (B → C), and you can conclude (A → C). Let me see if any of the premises fit this structure.

Looking at premise 3: N → P, and premise 2: P → (N → ~O). So if I have N → P, and P → (N → ~O), then by hypothetical syllogism, I can combine them to get N → (N → ~O). Wait, but that doesn't seem immediately helpful. Or maybe I can do something else with it.

Wait, perhaps I can use modus ponens. Modus ponens says that if you have A → B and A, then you can conclude B. So let's see if any of the premises can be used that way.

From premise 3, N → P. So if we have N as a premise, we can get P. But we don't have N as a premise; premise 3 is a conditional. So maybe that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I can derive N → ~O from the premises. Because premise 2 is P → (N → ~O), and premise 3 is N → P. So if I have N, then from premise 3, P follows, and then from premise 2, since P is true, N → ~O must be true. But again, that's two steps. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can combine premise 2 and premise 3 in a single step. Let's think: premise 3 is N → P, and premise 2 is P → (N → ~O). So combining these, we can get N → (N → ~O) via hypothetical syllogism. But N → (N → ~O) is equivalent to N → (~O ∨ N), by material implication. Wait, but that's a bit more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to derive something else. Let me think about the contrapositive. The contrapositive of premise 2 is ~(N → ~O) → ~P. But that might not be helpful here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the first premise. Let me look at premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So if I can derive N → ~O, then I can use modus ponens on premise 1 to get O ∨ Q. But how can I get N → ~O?

Wait, from premises 2 and 3, can I derive N → ~O? Let's see. From premise 3, N → P. From premise 2, P → (N → ~O). So combining these, I can get N → (N → ~O). Wait, that's N implies (N implies ~O). Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

But I think I can use hypothetical syllogism here. Hypothetical syllogism says that if A → B and B → C, then A → C. So here, A is N, B is P, and C is (N → ~O). So yes, N → (N → ~O). But that's not exactly N → ~O. Unless I can somehow get rid of the nested implication.

Wait, perhaps I can use another rule. Let me think: if I have N → (N → ~O), can I derive N → ~O from that? Let's see. Suppose N is true. Then from N → (N → ~O), we have N → ~O. So if N is true, then from N → (N → ~O), which is our derived statement, we can infer N → ~O. But that's using modus ponens again, which would be another step. So that's two steps again.

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me try a different approach.

Looking at the options, option G is N → ~O. So perhaps that's the answer. Because from premises 2 and 3, can I derive N → ~O in one step?

Wait, premise 3 is N → P, and premise 2 is P → (N → ~O). So combining these, perhaps via hypothetical syllogism, we can get N → (N → ~O). But that's not exactly N → ~O. Unless I can further simplify that.

Wait, let me think about the logical equivalence. N → (N → ~O) is equivalent to ~N ∨ (N → ~O). Which is equivalent to ~N ∨ (~N ∨ ~O), because N → ~O is ~N ∨ ~O. So combining the disjuncts, it's ~N ∨ ~N ∨ ~O, which simplifies to ~N ∨ ~O. Which is equivalent to N → ~O. Oh wait, that's right! Because N → ~O is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O. So N → (N → ~O) simplifies to N → ~O.

Wait, does it? Let me check. Let me write it out:

N → (N → ~O) is equivalent to ~N ∨ (N → ~O). And N → ~O is ~N ∨ ~O. So ~N ∨ (N → ~O) becomes ~N ∨ (~N ∨ ~O), which is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O, because ∨ is associative and commutative. So yes, N → (N → ~O) is equivalent to ~N ∨ ~O, which is N → ~O. So in that case, from N → (N → ~O), we can conclude N → ~O.

Wait, but how did we get N → (N → ~O)? From premises 2 and 3 via hypothetical syllogism. So that's one step. So then, from that, we can conclude N → ~O as a one-step consequence. Because N → (N → ~O) is equivalent to N → ~O.

Wait, but that seems like two steps: first, using hypothetical syllogism to get N → (N → ~O), then using logical equivalence to simplify to N → ~O. But the question says "immediate (one-step) consequence". So maybe that's allowed, because the equivalence is considered a single step.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option G: N → ~O. So that's one possibility.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option B is O ∨ Q. Let me see if that can be derived. From premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So if I can derive N → ~O, then I can use modus ponens on premise 1 to get O ∨ Q.

Wait, but from the earlier steps, we can derive N → ~O. So then, using premise 1 and N → ~O, we can get O ∨ Q. So that would be two steps: first deriving N → ~O, then using premise 1 to get O ∨ Q.

But the question asks for an immediate one-step consequence. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but maybe there's another way to look at it. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is N → Q. Hmm, not sure how that would come about.

Option G is N → ~O, which seems possible.

Wait, let me recap. From premises 2 and 3, using hypothetical syllogism, we get N → (N → ~O), which is equivalent to N → ~O. So that's one step. So then, option G would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the options and see which one is a direct consequence.

Wait, looking at premises 2 and 3 again:

Premise 2: P → (N → ~O)
Premise 3: N → P

So from 3, N → P. From 2, P → (N → ~O). So using hypothetical syllogism, N → (N → ~O), which is equivalent to N → ~O. So that's one step, so option G is correct.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A: P ⊃ O
B: O ∨ Q
C: N ⊃ Q
D: O ∨ P
E: ~N
F: P
G: N ⊃ ~O
H: P ⊃ Q
I: ~O ∨ Q
J: ~P

So option G is N → ~O, which we've derived from premises 2 and 3 using hypothetical syllogism in one step.

Alternatively, let me think if any other options can be derived in one step.

Looking at premise 3: N → P. So from this, can I derive anything else in one step? Well, if I have N as a premise, I could get P, but we don't have N as a premise. So perhaps not.

Premise 2: P → (N → ~O). So again, without P, we can't do much directly.

Premise 1: (N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q). So if we can get N → ~O, then we can get O ∨ Q. But to get N → ~O, we need to use premises 2 and 3, which we've already done.

Wait, but what about option I: ~O ∨ Q. That's the same as O ∨ Q, which is option B. So perhaps both B and I are equivalent, but I don't think that's the case because the order doesn't matter in disjunction. So O ∨ Q is the same as Q ∨ O.

Wait, but from premise 1, if we have N → ~O, then we can get O ∨ Q. So if we have N → ~O, which is option G, then from premise 1, we can get O ∨ Q, which is option B. But that would be two steps, so perhaps not the immediate consequence.

So the immediate consequence would be option G: N → ~O.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me check if any other options can be derived in one step.

Option A: P → O. Does that follow? From the premises, I don't think so. Because premise 2 says P → (N → ~O), which is different from P → O. So probably not.

Option C: N → Q. Hmm, not sure where that would come from. Because from N → ~O, we can't directly get Q unless we have more information. So perhaps not.

Option D: O ∨ P. I don't see how that follows directly.

Option E: ~N. That would require that N is false, but the premises don't necessarily lead to that.

Option F: P. Well, from premise 3, if we had N, we could get P, but without N, we can't conclude P.

Option H: P → Q. I don't see how that follows.

Option J: ~P. Again, without knowing if P is true or false, we can't conclude this.

So, after evaluating all options, it seems that option G: N → ~O is the correct answer because it's a one-step consequence using hypothetical syllogism from premises 2 and 3.

To determine which proposition is an immediate (one-step) consequence of the given premises, we analyze the premises and apply rules of inference in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. **(N → ~O) → (O ∨ Q)**  
2. **P → (N → ~O)**  
3. **N → P**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise 3 (N → P)** and **Premise 2 (P → (N → ~O))**:  
   Using the rule of **hypothetical syllogism**, which states that if we have **A → B** and **B → C**, we can infer **A → C**, we combine these two premises.  
   - From **N → P** (Premise 3) and **P → (N → ~O)** (Premise 2), we derive **N → (N → ~O)**.  

2. **Simplifying N → (N → ~O)**:  
   The statement **N → (N → ~O)** is logically equivalent to **N → ~O**. This is because **N → (N → ~O)** simplifies to **~N ∨ (N → ~O)**, and further to **~N ∨ ~O**, which is equivalent to **N → ~O**.

Thus, **N → ~O** is an immediate one-step consequence of the premises.

### Evaluation of Options:

- **A: P → O**  
  This does not follow from the premises. Premise 2 states **P → (N → ~O)**, which is different from **P → O**.

- **B: O ∨ Q**  
  While **O ∨ Q** could be derived from **N → ~O** using Premise 1, this would require two steps (first deriving **N → ~O**, then applying Premise 1). It is not an immediate consequence.

- **C: N → Q**  
  There is no direct way to derive **N → Q** from the premises.

- **D: O ∨ P**  
  This does not follow from the premises.

- **E: ~N**  
  The premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude **~N**.

- **F: P**  
  From Premise 3 (**N → P**), **P** could only be derived if **N** were true, but **N** is not given as a premise.

- **G: N → ~O**  
  This is directly derived from Premises 2 and 3 using hypothetical syllogism, as shown above.

- **H: P → Q**  
  There is no basis in the premises to derive **P → Q**.

- **I: ~O ∨ Q**  
  This is equivalent to **O ∨ Q**, which could be derived from **N → ~O** using Premise 1, but this would require two steps.

- **J: ~P**  
  The premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude **~P**.

### Conclusion:

The correct answer is **G: N → ~O**, as it is an immediate one-step consequence of the premises.

**Answer: G**
