Question:

How are whales adapted for their life in cold waters?

Options:

A: They have gills that extract oxygen from water and help regulate body temperature
B: They hibernate during cold weather
C: They maintain a constant internal body temperature and have a tremendous amount of subcutaneous fat serving an insulating function
D: They have a special layer of fur for insulation
E: They produce antifreeze proteins to prevent their blood from freezing
F: They utilize blubber to generate heat through a shivering mechanism

Okay, so I've got this question about whales and their adaptations to cold water. Hmm, I remember that whales are mammals, right? So they must have some specific features that help them survive in cold environments. Let me think about what I know about whales and marine mammals in general.

The question is asking how whales are adapted for life in cold waters. The options are A through F. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says they have gills. Wait, no, whales don't have gills. They're mammals, so they have lungs. They surface to breathe air. So A is wrong because gills are for fish. Plus, extracting oxygen from water isn't part of their adaptation for cold, but for being in water in general.

Option B: They hibernate during cold weather. Hmm, I don't think whales hibernate. Hibernation is more common in land mammals like bears. Whales are active all year round, I believe. They might migrate to warmer waters when it's too cold, but hibernation isn't their thing. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: They maintain a constant internal temperature and have subcutaneous fat for insulation. That makes sense. Whales are endothermic, meaning they keep a constant body temperature. Subcutaneous fat, which is like blubber, would help insulate them. I remember that blubber is a thick layer of fat that keeps them warm in cold water. So C sounds correct, but I'll check the other options too.

Option D: A special layer of fur. Wait, whales don't have fur. They have a thick layer of blubber, but not fur. Fur is for animals like seals or polar bears. So D is wrong.

Option E: They produce antifreeze proteins. I think some fish do that, like the icefish in Antarctica. But whales, being mammals, probably don't need that because they don't let their body fluids freeze. Their body temperature is regulated, so E doesn't seem right.

Option F: Use blubber to generate heat via shivering. I know that blubber is insulation, not a heat generator. Shivering is a muscle activity that generates heat. So maybe whales do shiver, but F says blubber does that, which I don't think is accurate. Blubber is for insulation, not generating heat through shivering. So F might be incorrect.

So putting it all together, the best option is C. Whales maintain their internal temperature and have subcutaneous fat (blubber) for insulation. That keeps them warm in cold water.

Whales are adapted to cold waters through their ability to maintain a constant internal body temperature and their thick layer of subcutaneous fat, known as blubber, which serves as insulation. This combination allows them to retain heat efficiently in cold environments.

Answer: C
