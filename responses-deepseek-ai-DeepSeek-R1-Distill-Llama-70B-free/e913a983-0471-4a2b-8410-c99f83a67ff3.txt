Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating real NNP for different years using a base year. Hmm, I remember that real values adjust for price changes, right? Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem gives me data for the years 1929 and 1933. For 1929, the money NNP is $96 billion, and the price index is 100 because it's the base year. For 1933, the money NNP is $48 billion, and the price index is 75. Wait, no, wait, the price index is 75? Or is that the other way around? Oh wait, the question says the Price Index is 1929 base. So in 1929, the index is 100, and in 1933, it's 75. So prices have gone down by 25% from 1929 to 1933. That makes sense because the Great Depression happened around then, so prices probably fell.

Part a) asks for the real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as the base. I remember that the formula for real NNP (or any real value) is money NNP divided by the price index of the year, multiplied by 100 (or just divided by the price index if it's already in index form). So the formula should be Real NNP = (Money NNP) / (Price Index / Base Index) × Base Index? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of ratios.

Wait, the base is 1929, which has a price index of 100. So for 1933, the price index is 75. So to find the real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as the base, I take the money NNP of 1933, which is $48 billion, and divide it by (75/100). That's because the price level in 1933 is 75% of the base year. So dividing by 0.75 should give me the real NNP.

Let me compute that. 48 divided by 0.75 equals... 48 divided by 3/4 is the same as 48 multiplied by 4/3. 48 * 4 is 192, divided by 3 is 64. So real NNP in 1933 would be $64 billion.

Now part b) is trickier. It asks for the real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as the base. Hmm, that's a bit less straightforward. So the base is now 1933, whose price index is 75. So I need to express 1929's NNP in terms of 1933's prices.

The money NNP in 1929 is $96 billion. The price index in 1929 is 100, and in 1933, it's 75. So to find the real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as the base, I think I need to adjust the 1929 money NNP to what it would be in 1933's price level.

Wait, the formula for real NNP when the base is the current year is (Money NNP) × (Base Year Price Index / Current Year Price Index). Wait, no, that's when you're using a different base. Let me think again.

When calculating real NNP with a new base, say base year is 1933, then real NNP for 1929 would be (Money NNP of 1929) × (Price Index of 1933 / Price Index of 1929). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, it might be (Money NNP) divided by the price index of the base year, but scaled appropriately.

Alternatively, the formula is Real NNP = (Nominal NNP) × (Base Year Price Index / Current Year Price Index). So for part a), using 1929 as base: 48 × (100/75) = 64.

For part b), using 1933 as base: 96 × (75/100) = 72. Wait, but that can't be right because that would give 72, but looking at the options, that's one of the choices. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the formula might actually be different. Because when you change the base, you're expressing the earlier year in terms of the later year's prices. So in part a), to get real NNP for 1933 in base 1929, you take (48 / 75) * 100, which is the same as 48 * (100/75) = 64.

For part b), real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as base would be (96 / 100) * 75 = 72. Wait, that seems correct because you're taking the 1929 nominal value and deflating it using the 1933 price index as the base.

Wait, but let me make sure. The price index in 1933 is 75, so it's lower than 1929's 100. So in 1933's terms, the 1929 NNP would be worth more because 1929 was a time of higher prices. So if in 1929, nominal NNP is 96, and prices were higher, then in 1933's lower price level, the same nominal amount would have more purchasing power, so the real NNP should be higher than 96. Wait, that doesn't make sense because using 1933 as the base, so perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, think in terms of the GDP deflator. The real NNP in base year B is (Nominal NNP) / (GDP deflator with base B). So for 1929, when the base is 1933, the GDP deflator for 1929 would be 100/75 = 1.333... So real NNP = 96 / (100/75) = 96 * 75/100 = 72. So that's 72, which is higher than the nominal because the deflator is less than 1.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if the price level was higher in 1929 than in 1933, then when you express 1929's NNP in 1933's prices, the real NNP should be lower than the nominal. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, perhaps I have it backward. Let me think about it. Let's say a basket of goods costs $100 in 1929 and $75 in 1933. So in 1933, the same basket is cheaper. So if in 1929, the nominal NNP is $96 billion, how much would that be in terms of 1933's prices?

Think of it as how many units of 1933's price basket can the 1929 NNP buy. Since each basket is cheaper in 1933, $96 billion in 1929 would be equivalent to more in 1933's terms. Wait no, because in 1929, each dollar is worth more in terms of goods. So when you express 1929's NNP in 1933's dollars, you have to adjust for the price difference.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use the formula:

Real NNP (base 1933) = Nominal NNP (1929) × (Price Index 1933 / Price Index 1929).

So that's 96 × (75/100) = 72.

Wait, but that would make the real NNP in 1929 (expressed in 1933's base) as 72, which is lower than the nominal NNP of 96. But that doesn't make sense because 1929 had higher prices. So when you deflate 1929's nominal NNP to 1933's lower price level, the real NNP should be higher. So maybe I've got the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Real NNP (base year B) = Nominal NNP × (Price Index B / Price Index of the year). So when the base is 1933, for 1929, it's 96 × (75/100) = 72. But that would mean that the real NNP is lower, which doesn't align with my intuition.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is Real NNP = Nominal NNP / (Price Index / Base Index). So for part b), using 1933 as the base (75), the price index for 1929 is 100. So Real NNP = 96 / (100/75) = 96 * (75/100) = 72. So that's what I get again.

But wait, if in 1929, things were more expensive, then $96 billion in 1929 should be equivalent to more in 1933's cheaper dollars. So perhaps the real NNP should be higher than 96. But according to the calculation, it's 72, which is lower. That doesn't make sense. So maybe I've inverted the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be (Nominal NNP) × (Base Year Index / Current Year Index). So for part a), with base 1929, 48 × (100/75) = 64. For part b), base 1933, 96 × (75/100) = 72. But I'm getting confused about whether that's correct.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think in terms of purchasing power. In 1929, the price index is 100, in 1933, it's 75. So the same basket of goods that cost $100 in 1929 costs $75 in 1933. So $1 in 1929 has the same purchasing power as $1 * (100/75) = $1.333 in 1933.

Wait, no, actually, it's the opposite. Because in 1933, things are cheaper. So $1 in 1933 could buy more than $1 in 1929. So $1 in 1929 is equivalent to $0.75 in 1933 money, because 1929's dollar is stronger. So to find the real NNP of 1929 in 1933 terms, you take the 1929 NNP of 96 and multiply by 0.75, which gives 72. So 72 is the real NNP in 1933's terms. But wait, that would mean that 1929's economy was smaller in real terms when using 1933 as the base, which might not make sense because the economy was bigger in 1929 than in 1933. Wait, but in real terms, maybe it's different.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because we're using different base years, and the real NNP reflects the volume of goods and services. So when using 1933 as the base, the real NNP of 1929 is lower than the nominal because prices were higher then. So if 1929's nominal NNP is 96, and prices were higher, the real NNP in 1933 terms would be lower. So 72 makes sense. Because in 1933's cheaper prices, the same nominal amount would buy more, but in terms of real output, 1929's economy was actually smaller when measured in 1933's prices.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the Great Depression caused a significant decline in economic output. So 1929 was a peak, and 1933 was a trough. So real NNP in 1929 should be higher than in 1933, regardless of the base. So when using 1929 as the base, real NNP in 1933 is 64, which is lower than 96, as expected. But when using 1933 as the base, real NNP in 1929 should be higher than real NNP in 1933.

Wait, in 1933, the real NNP using 1933 as the base would be the nominal NNP divided by the price index (which is 100 in 1933). So 48 / (75/100) = 48 * (100/75) = 64. So real NNP in 1933 with base 1933 is 64. But wait, in part a), when using base 1929, real NNP in 1933 is 64. So that's the same number, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no, perhaps the real NNP when using the same year as the base is the same as the nominal NNP. Wait, no, because the price index is 100, so real NNP would be (Nominal NNP) / (Price Index / 100). So if the price index is 100, real NNP equals nominal NNP. So in 1933, if we use 1933 as the base, real NNP is 48 / (75/100) = 64. So that's correct.

So in part a), real NNP in 1933 using 1929 base is 64. In part b), real NNP in 1929 using 1933 base is 72.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is $64 and $72. So a) is 64, b) is 72. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. For part a), 1933 real NNP with base 1929: (48) / (75/100) = 64. Correct.

For part b), 1929 real NNP with base 1933: (96) / (100/75) = 96 * (75/100) = 72. So yes, 72.

So the answers are a) 64 and b)72. Looking at the options, option A is 64 and 72. So the correct answer is A.

To calculate the real NNP for the given years using the provided data, we use the formula for real NNP:

\[
\text{Real NNP} = \frac{\text{Money NNP}}{\text{Price Index of the year}} \times \text{Base Year Price Index}
\]

### Part (a): Real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as the base
- **Money NNP in 1933**: $48 billion
- **Price Index in 1933**: 75
- **Base Year Price Index (1929)**: 100

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Real NNP in 1933} = \frac{48}{75} \times 100 = 64
\]

Thus, the real NNP in 1933 using 1929 as the base is **$64 billion**.

### Part (b): Real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as the base
- **Money NNP in 1929**: $96 billion
- **Price Index in 1929**: 100
- **Base Year Price Index (1933)**: 75

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Real NNP in 1929} = \frac{96}{100} \times 75 = 72
\]

Thus, the real NNP in 1929 using 1933 as the base is **$72 billion**.

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Part (a): $64 billion
- Part (b): $72 billion

The correct option is **A: $64 and $72**.
