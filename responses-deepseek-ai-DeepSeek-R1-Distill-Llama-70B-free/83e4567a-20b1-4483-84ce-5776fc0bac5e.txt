Okay, so I have this math problem here: If x minus 3 equals 6, what is the value of x? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit new to algebra, so I need to think this through carefully.

Alright, the equation is x - 3 = 6. I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side. So, the goal is to get x by itself. Right now, it's being subtracted by 3. To undo that subtraction, I should do the opposite operation, which is addition. So, I'll add 3 to both sides of the equation to keep it balanced.

Let me write that down in my head. If I add 3 to both sides, the left side becomes x - 3 + 3, which simplifies to just x because the -3 and +3 cancel each other out. On the right side, 6 plus 3 is 9. So, x equals 9. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Sometimes I get mixed up with signs. So, if x is 9, then plugging it back into the original equation should work. Let's test it: 9 minus 3 is 6. Yep, that's correct. So x is definitely 9.

Looking at the options, E is 9. So the answer should be E. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Another way to think about it: if I have some number x, and when I subtract 3, it's 6. So to find x, I need to figure out what number, when I take away 3, leaves me with 6. It's like reverse engineering. So, 6 plus 3 is 9. Yep, that makes sense.

I think I'm confident now. The answer is E.

The equation is x - 3 = 6. To solve for x, add 3 to both sides:

x - 3 + 3 = 6 + 3  
x = 9  

Verifying by substituting x = 9 into the original equation: 9 - 3 = 6, which is correct.  

The correct answer is E: 9.  

E
