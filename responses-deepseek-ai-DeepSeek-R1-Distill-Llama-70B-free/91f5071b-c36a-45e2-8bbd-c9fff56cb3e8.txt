Okay, so I have this question about financial statements, specifically which ones require a statement of cash flows. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about a government entity. So, the options are various types of financial statements, and I need to pick the correct one where a statement of cash flows is required.

I remember that different types of funds and entities have different reporting requirements. Let me break down the options.

Option A: Corporate financial statements. Well, I know that for-profit companies do include a statement of cash flows. It's one of the primary financial statements under GAAP. But the question is about a government entity, so maybe this isn't the right one unless the government entity is using corporate-like reporting.

Option B: Governmental fund financial statements. Governmental funds are one of the types in government accounting. I think they use the modified accrual basis. But I'm not sure if they require a cash flow statement. I remember that governmental funds focus more on the availability of funds rather than profitability, so maybe they don't need a cash flow statement. Or perhaps they do, but I'm not certain.

Option C: Fiduciary fund financial statements. Fiduciary funds include trust funds and agency funds. I think these are reported on a full accrual basis. But again, I'm not sure about the cash flow statement here. I believe that fiduciary funds might require a cash flow statement because they're more like trust arrangements, but I'm not entirely certain.

Option D: Pension fund financial statements. Pension funds are a type of fiduciary fund, right? So maybe they do require a cash flow statement. I think pension funds do provide a statement of cash flows because they have to show inflows and outflows of cash for the fund's operations.

Option E: Municipal bond financial statements. I'm not sure what this refers to. Maybe the financial statements accompanying a bond issue? I don't think this is a standard set of statements, but perhaps it's a term I'm not familiar with. I'll have to think more about this.

Option F: Private company financial statements. Like option A, private companies do have a statement of cash flows in their financials. But again, the question is about a government entity. So unless the government entity is a private company, which it's not, this might not apply.

Option G: Non-profit organization financial statements. Non-profits do have a statement of cash flows, but the question is specifically about government entities, so maybe this isn't the correct choice unless the government entity is a non-profit, which might not be the case.

Option H: Government-wide financial statements. Government-wide statements present information for the government as a whole, combining all funds. I think these are prepared on the accrual basis. Do they include a cash flow statement? I'm trying to remember. I think government-wide statements do include a statement of net position, a statement of activities, and maybe a statement of cash flows. Or wait, maybe they don't require it. I'm a bit confused here.

Option I: Proprietary fund financial statements. Proprietary funds are for activities that resemble businesses, like utilities or hospitals. They are reported on a full accrual basis, similar to private companies. I do remember that proprietary funds require a statement of cash flows because they operate more like businesses. So, this might be the correct answer.

Option J: Public school financial statements. I'm not sure about this one. Public schools might be part of the government, so perhaps their financial statements fall under one of the other categories. But I'm not certain if they specifically require a cash flow statement.

Let me try to piece this together. The question is about which financial statements include a statement of cash flows. The options are about different types of funds or entities.

I know that for-profit companies (options A, F) include cash flow statements. Non-profits (G) do as well. Pension funds (D) might, being fiduciary funds.

In government accounting, I think the main funds are governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary. Governmental funds don't typically include a cash flow statement because they focus on current financial position rather than cash flows. Proprietary funds, however, do, because they're more business-like.

So the government entity, if it's a proprietary fund, would include a cash flow statement. Looking back at the options, option I is Proprietary fund financial statements. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but what about government-wide statements (H)? I think government-wide statements don't require a cash flow statement. They present a statement of net position and a statement of activities, but not cash flows. Cash flows are more relevant at the fund level for proprietary funds.

So the answer should be I: Proprietary fund financial statements.

The question asks which financial statements of a government entity are required to include a statement of cash flows. To determine the correct answer, it's important to analyze the reporting requirements for different types of funds and entities.

- **Option A: Corporate financial statements**  
  For-profit companies, including corporate financial statements, do include a statement of cash flows. However, the question specifically pertains to a government entity, so this option is not applicable.

- **Option B: Governmental fund financial statements**  
  Governmental funds focus on the modified accrual basis and emphasize the availability of funds rather than profitability. They typically do not require a statement of cash flows.

- **Option C: Fiduciary fund financial statements**  
  Fiduciary funds, such as trust funds, are reported on a full accrual basis. While they may include a statement of cash flows, this is not universally required across all fiduciary funds.

- **Option D: Pension fund financial statements**  
  Pension funds, as a type of fiduciary fund, may include a statement of cash flows to track inflows and outflows of cash. However, the question is broader and not specific to pension funds.

- **Option E: Municipal bond financial statements**  
  This term is not standard, and it is unclear whether it refers to a specific set of financial statements. It is unlikely to be the correct answer.

- **Option F: Private company financial statements**  
  Private companies include a statement of cash flows, but the question is about government entities, making this option irrelevant.

- **Option G: Non-profit organization financial statements**  
  Non-profit organizations do include a statement of cash flows, but the question is specifically about government entities, so this option does not apply.

- **Option H: Government-wide financial statements**  
  Government-wide statements present information for the government as a whole and are prepared on the accrual basis. They typically include a statement of net position and a statement of activities but do not require a statement of cash flows.

- **Option I: Proprietary fund financial statements**  
  Proprietary funds are used for activities that resemble businesses, such as utilities or hospitals, and are reported on a full accrual basis. These funds are required to include a statement of cash flows because they operate similarly to private businesses.

- **Option J: Public school financial statements**  
  Public schools are part of the government, and their financial statements likely fall under another category. There is no indication that they specifically require a statement of cash flows.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **Option I: Proprietary fund financial statements**, as these are the financial statements of a government entity that require a statement of cash flows.
