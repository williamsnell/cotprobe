Okay, so I have this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure out what consumers' surplus means. I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what consumers' surplus is, and there are several options to choose from, labeled A to H. I remember that surplus in economics usually refers to the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. But let me break it down more clearly.

I think consumers' surplus arises from the demand curve. The demand curve shows how much quantity people are willing to buy at different prices. So, when you buy something, you pay the market price for it, but if you were willing to pay more for some units, the difference is your surplus.

Wait, let me think of an example to clarify. Suppose I want to buy a concert ticket, and I'm willing to pay up to $100. But the ticket is selling for $80. So I buy it for $80, but I would have paid more. The extra $20 I saved is my consumers' surplus.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says it's a tax on consumers. No, that's not right. Taxes are separate and usually go to the government.

Option B mentions extra cost due to high demand. That doesn't sound right. High demand might lead to higher prices, but surplus is about the difference between willingness to pay and actual price.

Option C says it's goods received for free in promotions. That sounds more like a marketing tactic, not surplus.

Option D talks about savings from choosing cheaper options. While that involves saving money, I'm not sure if that's exactly what consumers' surplus is about. Surplus is more about the value over what you paid, not just choosing cheaper things.

Option E: "the surplus of value consumers receive from all prior units, which have higher (marginal) utilities than the last unit bought." Hmm, that sounds familiar. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from each unit. So if the last unit gives you less utility, the earlier units provided more than what you paid for. So the total value from all units minus what you paid would be the surplus.

Option F: additional utility from luxury items. I don't think that's right. Luxury items might have high utility, but surplus isn't specifically about luxury.

Option G: discounts during sales. That's a seller's action to lower prices, not the surplus itself.

Option H: additional profit for sellers. No, that's producer surplus, I think.

Wait, so the key here is that consumers' surplus is the difference between the maximum they're willing to pay (their marginal utility for each unit) and the price they actually pay. So for each unit before the last one, they're getting more value than they paid. So the total of all these differences across all units bought is the consumers' surplus.

So looking back, option E says it's the surplus of value from all prior units with higher marginal utilities than the last. That fits because the last unit's marginal utility equals the price (assuming equilibrium), so all units before that have higher utility, thus contributing to the surplus.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be E.

Consumers' surplus refers to the difference between the maximum amount consumers are willing to pay for a product and the actual price they pay. It arises when consumers derive more value from a product than its market price. For example, if a consumer is willing to pay $100 for a concert ticket but buys it for $80, the $20 difference is their surplus. This concept is tied to the demand curve and marginal utility, where earlier units purchased provide higher utility than the last unit bought, which equals the market price. 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer is E: "Consumers' surplus is the surplus of value consumers receive from all prior units, which have higher (marginal) utilities than the last unit bought." This accurately captures the essence of consumers' surplus as the additional value gained from units purchased before the last one, which has lower marginal utility.

Answer: E
