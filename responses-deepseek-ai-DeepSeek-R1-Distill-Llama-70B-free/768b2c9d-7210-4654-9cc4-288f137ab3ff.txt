Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve. Hmm, I remember Gibbs free energy change when pressure changes is related to some equation. Let me think. Oh right, for an ideal gas, the change in molar Gibbs energy when you change the pressure isothermally can be calculated with the formula ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, it's not exactly that. Because I think for Gibbs energy, when the process is isothermal, the formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, that's for calculating the change when a gas is compressed or expanded. But wait, isn't it also related to the equation for the change in Gibbs energy when you change pressure?

Wait, another thought. Oh, right, Gibbs energy change for a gas when pressure changes at constant temperature is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because for an ideal gas, the Gibbs energy change when changing pressure at constant T is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because I remember that the Gibbs free energy for a reaction under non-standard conditions is given by ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q. But in this case, it's just a single gas changing pressure, so perhaps that formula applies differently.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. The Gibbs free energy change for a system when the pressure changes is calculated using the equation ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, only when the change is from a certain pressure to another, and I think for ideal gases, it's applicable. But wait, wait, no, wait. Because for a process at constant temperature, the change in Gibbs free energy for an ideal gas is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, wait, because when you increase the pressure, the Gibbs energy increases if the gas is compressed. Because for an ideal gas, the entropy decreases when compressed, and since ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, and for compression, the system is doing work, so maybe the enthalpy increases? Or wait, maybe not. Because for ideal gases, the enthalpy only depends on temperature. So at constant T, ΔH is zero. So ΔG would be -TΔS. But when you compress a gas, the entropy decreases, so ΔS is negative, making ΔG positive because it's -T*(-ΔS positive).

Wait, but using the formula directly. Let me make sure. The formula: for an ideal gas changing pressure at constant T, the change in Gibbs energy is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). Wait, but wait, I think that's for when the process is reversible and isothermal, right?

Alternatively, another approach. The Gibbs free energy change when the pressure of a gas changes is given by the integral of V dP at constant T. For an ideal gas, V = nRT/P. So ΔG = integral from P1 to P2 of nRT/P dP. Which is nRT ln(P2/P1). So yes, that's correct.

So for this problem, hydrogen gas is being compressed isothermally from 1 atm to 100 atm. So n is 1 mole because we're talking about molar Gibbs energy. R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol·K. T is 298 K.

So plugging in: ΔG = (1 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (298 K) * ln(100/1).

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate ln(100). Since 100 is 10^2, ln(100) = ln(10^2) = 2 ln(10). And ln(10) is approximately 2.302585. So 2 * 2.302585 ≈ 4.60517.

So ln(100) ≈ 4.60517.

Now, ΔG = 1 * 8.314 * 298 * 4.60517.

Let me compute each step:

8.314 * 298 ≈ ?

Well, 8 * 300 is 2400, but let's compute accurately.

8.314 * 298:

Compute 8 * 298 = 2384.

0.314 * 298: 0.3 *298=89.4, 0.014*298=4.172. So 89.4+4.172=93.572.

So 2384 + 93.572 = 2477.572 J/mol.

Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, 8.314 * 298 = ?

Let me compute 8 * 298 = 2384.

0.314 * 298: Let's compute 0.3 * 298 = 89.4.

0.014 * 298 = 4.172.

So 89.4 + 4.172 = 93.572.

So total is 2384 + 93.572 = 2477.572 J/mol.

So now, 2477.572 J/mol multiplied by 4.60517.

So 2477.572 * 4.60517 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2477.572 *4 = 9910.288.

2477.572 * 0.60517 ≈ Let's compute 2477.572 * 0.6 = 1486.5432.

2477.572 * 0.00517 ≈ approximately 12.827.

So 1486.5432 + 12.827 ≈ 1499.37.

So total is 9910.288 + 1499.37 = 11409.658 J/mol.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1 atm to 100 atm is a big jump, so the ΔG is positive and in the tens of kJ.

But wait, 11,409 J is 11.409 kJ. But the options are all in the +5 to +23 kJ range. Looking at the options, the highest is C at +23, then F at +21, G at +19, etc.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute 8.314 * 298 first.

8.314 * 298:

Compute 8 * 298 = 2384.

0.314 * 298 = 93.772.

Wait, 0.3 *298 is 89.4, 0.014 *298 is 4.172, so 89.4 +4.172 = 93.572. So 2384 +93.572 = 2477.572 J/mol.

Then, multiply by ln(100) = 4.60517.

So 2477.572 * 4.60517 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

First, multiply 2477.572 by 4.60517:

= 2477.572 *4 = 9910.288.

2477.572 *0.6 = 1486.5432.

2477.572 * 0.00517 = let's compute 2477.572 *0.005 = 12.38786, and 2477.572 *0.00017 = 0.4210.

So 12.38786 + 0.4210 ≈ 12.80886.

So 1486.5432 + 12.80886 = 1499.35206.

Now add to 9910.288:

9910.288 + 1499.35206 = 11409.64006 J/mol.

Which is 11,409.64 J/mol, which is 11.40964 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the options don't have 11 kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: +17 kJ

B: +7

C: +23

D: +9

E: +13

F: +21

G: +19

H: +5

I: +11

J: +15

So, option I is +11 kJ/mol. So that would be the answer.

But wait, wait a second, wait. Because in thermodynamics, the Gibbs energy change for a gas when compressed is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, wait, wait, no. Because I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me recheck.

Wait, the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) when the change is from P1 to P2, but wait, another part of me remembers that the Gibbs energy of a gas under pressure is given by ΔG = RT ln(P/P°), where P° is standard pressure (1 atm). So in this case, if the gas is being compressed from 1 atm to 100 atm, P2=100, P1=1.

So the formula is correct: ΔG = nRT ln(100/1) = nRT ln(100).

But wait, wait another thought: For an ideal gas, the Gibbs energy change when changing pressure is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). So yes, I did that right.

So 11.4 kJ/mol would be approximately 11.4, which is option I: +11 kJ/mol.

But wait, let me think again about units. R is 8.314 J/mol·K, which is about 8.314 J. So when I compute, I get 11,409 J, which is 11.409 kJ.

But I thought the options have I as +11, which fits.

So the answer should be I.

But wait, looking back, the question says "change in the molar Gibbs energy". So yes, n is 1, so it's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Gibbs energy change for a process where pressure increases is positive, which matches with all the options being positive, so that's correct.

So I think the correct answer is I, +11 kJ/mol.

To calculate the change in the molar Gibbs energy of hydrogen gas when its pressure is increased isothermally from $1.0 \mathrm{~atm}$ to $100.0 \mathrm{~atm}$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$, we use the formula for the Gibbs energy change of an ideal gas under isothermal conditions:

\[
\Delta G = nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

Here:
- $n = 1$ (since we are calculating the molar Gibbs energy),
- $R = 8.314 \mathrm{~J~mol^{-1}~K^{-1}}$ (ideal gas constant),
- $T = 298 \mathrm{~K}$ (temperature),
- $P_1 = 1.0 \mathrm{~atm}$ (initial pressure),
- $P_2 = 100.0 \mathrm{~atm}$ (final pressure).

First, calculate $\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)$:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{100}{1}\right) = \ln(100) = 4.60517
\]

Next, calculate $\Delta G$:
\[
\Delta G = (1)(8.314)(298)(4.60517)
\]

1. Compute $8.314 \times 298$:
\[
8.314 \times 298 = 2477.572 \mathrm{~J~mol^{-1}}
\]

2. Multiply by $4.60517$:
\[
2477.572 \times 4.60517 = 11409.64 \mathrm{~J~mol^{-1}} = 11.40964 \mathrm{~kJ~mol^{-1}}
\]

Thus, the change in molar Gibbs energy is approximately $+11 \mathrm{~kJ~mol^{-1}}$.

From the given options:
- **A:** +17 kJ/mol
- **B:** +7 kJ/mol
- **C:** +23 kJ/mol
- **D:** +9 kJ/mol
- **E:** +13 kJ/mol
- **F:** +21 kJ/mol
- **G:** +19 kJ/mol
- **H:** +5 kJ/mol
- **I:** +11 kJ/mol
- **J:** +15 kJ/mol

The correct answer is **I: +11 kJ/mol**, as it matches the calculated value.
