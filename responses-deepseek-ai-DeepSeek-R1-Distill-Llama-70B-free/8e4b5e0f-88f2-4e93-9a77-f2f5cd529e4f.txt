Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the net price of a calculator after some discounts. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. Alright, the calculator is list-priced at $100.00, and there are two discounts: 40% and 25%. I need to find the net price after applying both discounts.

Wait, so first, I guess I should figure out the first discount. The first discount is 40% off. So 40% of $100 is... let me calculate that. 40% as a decimal is 0.4, so 0.4 times 100 is $40. So if I subtract that from $100, the price after the first discount would be $60.

Now, the second discount is 25%. But wait, is this 25% off the original price or the already discounted price? The question isn't entirely clear on that. Oh, but usually, when multiple discounts are applied, they're applied successively. So I think the second discount is applied to the price after the first discount.

So the second discount is 25% off of $60. Let me compute that. 25% is 0.25, so 0.25 times 60 is... 15. So the second discount is $15. Subtract that from $60, and the net price would be $45.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I can think of it another way. Sometimes, discounts can be combined, but I don't think that's the case here. Because 40% and 25% are applied one after the other, not as a combined percentage. So the first discount brings it down to $60, then 25% off that gives $45. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option C is $45. So I think that's the correct answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. 40% of 100 is definitely 40, so 100-40=60. Then 25% of 60 is 15, so 60-15=45. Yep, that's right. So option C should be the correct choice.

The calculator is initially priced at $100.00. After applying a 40% discount, the price becomes $60.00. A subsequent 25% discount is then applied to this reduced price, resulting in a final price of $45.00. 

Options:
C: $45
