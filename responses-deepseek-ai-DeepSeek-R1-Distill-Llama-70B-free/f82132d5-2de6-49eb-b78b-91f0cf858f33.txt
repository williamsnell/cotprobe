Okay, so I need to figure out George Henderson's gross earnings for last week. Let's see, I remember that when someone works more than the standard 40 hours, they get overtime pay. Overtime is usually time and a half, which means 1.5 times the base rate. 

George worked 46 hours. The standard work week is 40 hours, so the first 40 are at the base rate, and the remaining 6 hours would be overtime. His base rate is $3.00 per hour. 

Wait, let me break this down. For the first 40 hours, he gets $3 per hour. So 40 times 3 is 120. That's straightforward. 

Now, the overtime. He worked 6 hours beyond 40. Overtime pay is time and a half, so that's 1.5 times his base rate. So 3 times 1.5 is 4.50 per hour for overtime. 

So for 6 hours of overtime, that's 6 times 4.50. Let's calculate that: 6 * 4.50. Hmm, 4.50 plus 4.50 is 9 for 2 hours, so 6 is 3 times that. 9 times 3 is 27. So the overtime pay is $27.

Adding the base pay and overtime together: 120 + 27 equals 147. So his total gross earnings should be $147.00.

Looking at the options, option A is $147.00. So the answer should be A.

To calculate George Henderson's gross earnings for working 46 hours last week, we break it down as follows:

1. **Base Pay (40 hours):**  
   George earns $3.00 per hour for the first 40 hours.  
   \( 40 \text{ hours} \times \$3.00/\text{hour} = \$120.00 \).

2. **Overtime Pay (6 hours):**  
   Overtime is calculated at "time and a half," which is \( 1.5 \times \$3.00 = \$4.50 \) per hour.  
   For 6 hours of overtime:  
   \( 6 \text{ hours} \times \$4.50/\text{hour} = \$27.00 \).

3. **Total Gross Earnings:**  
   Adding base pay and overtime pay:  
   \( \$120.00 + \$27.00 = \$147.00 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **A: \$147.00**.
