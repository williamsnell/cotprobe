Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says, Simon used 3 pears and 9 apples to make a fruit salad. The question is asking for the ratio of the number of pears to apples. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, ratios. I remember ratios compare two quantities. So the ratio of pears to apples would be how many pears there are for every apple, right? In this case, Simon used 3 pears and 9 apples. So I think the ratio is pears : apples, which would be 3:9. But wait, ratios are usually simplified, aren't they? Like, you divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor to make it as simple as possible.

So 3 and 9, the GCD is 3. So dividing both by 3, 3/3 is 1 and 9/3 is 3. So the simplified ratio is 1:3. Let me check the options to see which one matches that.

Looking at the options:

A: 1:02 - That's 1:2, no.
B: 1:06 - 1:6, no.
C: 1:03 - Oh wait, 1:03 is like 1:3, right? Because 03 is just 3. So that's option C.
D: 2:09 - 2:9, doesn't match.
E:3:01 - Nope.
F:1:09 - That's 1:9, not it.
G:1:04 - 1:4, no.
H:1:05 - 1:5, no.
I:3:09 - 3:9, which is the same as 1:3, but is it simplified?
Wait, but in the options, option C is 1:03, which is 1:3. So that's the simplified version, so that's correct.

Wait a second, option I is 3:09, which can be simplified. So does the question want the simplified ratio or just the direct count? Well, ratios are usually presented in the simplest form, so option C is the right choice.

Wait, but looking again, the options: option C is 1:03, which is the same as 1:3. Yes. So the correct answer should be option C.

The ratio of pears to apples is 3:9, which simplifies to 1:3. Among the options, 1:03 corresponds to the simplified ratio.

Answer: C
