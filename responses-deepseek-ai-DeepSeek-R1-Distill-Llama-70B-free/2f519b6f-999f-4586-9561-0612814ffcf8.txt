Okay, so I've got this problem here about using Chebyshev's inequality to find a lower bound for the probability P(23 < X < 43). The random variable X has a mean of 33 and a variance of 16. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Chebyshev's inequality gives a bound on the probability that a random variable is within a certain number of standard deviations away from its mean. The general formula is P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/(k²), where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation. But wait, I think it's often stated as the complement: P(|X - μ| < kσ) ≥ 1 - 1/k². Oh right, because Chebyshev gives an upper bound on the probability of being far from the mean, so the lower bound on being close is 1 minus that.

But in this problem, I'm being asked about the probability that X is between 23 and 43. Let's see, the mean is 33. So 33 minus 23 is 10, and 43 minus 33 is also 10. So X is within 10 units of the mean. Now, I need to relate this to the standard deviation.

Wait, variance is 16, so the standard deviation σ is the square root of 16, which is 4. Oh right, σ=4. So the range we're looking at, 23 to 43, is ±10 from the mean. But in terms of standard deviations, that's 10 divided by 4, which is 2.5σ. So k would be 2.5 in this case.

So applying Chebyshev's inequality, the probability that X is within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean is at least 1 - 1/(k²). Plugging in k=2.5, so 1/(2.5)^2 is 1/6.25, which is 0.16. Therefore, 1 - 0.16 is 0.84. So the lower bound is 0.84.

Wait a second, but Chebyshev gives a lower bound for the probability that X is within kσ of the mean, so in our case, 23 to 43 is exactly that range. So the probability P(23 < X < 43) is at least 0.84.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.84. So I think the answer is I.

But wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the interval 23 to 43 is symmetric around the mean 33. Because 33-23=10 and 43-33=10. So the distance from the mean is 10 on each side. Variance is 16, so standard deviation is 4. So 10 is 2.5σ. So k=2.5.

Chebyshev says that the probability of being within kσ is ≥ 1 - 1/(k²). So yes, 1 - 1/(6.25) = 0.84.

So the lower bound is 0.84, which is option I.

To solve the problem using Chebyshev's inequality, we start by noting that the random variable \( X \) has a mean \( \mu = 33 \) and variance \( \sigma^2 = 16 \), so the standard deviation is \( \sigma = 4 \). The interval \( 23 < X < 43 \) is symmetric around the mean, with a distance of \( 10 \) on either side. 

In terms of standard deviations, this distance is \( k = \frac{10}{\sigma} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \). Chebyshev's inequality states that:

\[
P(|X - \mu| < k\sigma) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}.
\]

Substituting \( k = 2.5 \), we calculate:

\[
P(23 < X < 43) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{(2.5)^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{6.25} = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84.
\]

Thus, the lower bound for \( P(23 < X < 43) \) is \( 0.84 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

I: 0.84.
