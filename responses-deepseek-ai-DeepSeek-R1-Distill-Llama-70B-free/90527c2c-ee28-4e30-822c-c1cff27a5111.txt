Okay, so I have this problem about transmission lines and pulses, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a 50V pulse incident on a load. The load has a resistance of 30 ohms, and the line has a characteristic resistance of 50 ohms. I remember that when a pulse hits a load, some of it reflects, and the rest is transmitted. So I need to find several things: the incident current, reflection coefficient, reflected voltage, reflected current, and the net voltage and current at the load.

Wait, what's the incident current first. Oh right, the incident current is calculated using Ohm's law. The incident voltage is 50V, and the characteristic impedance is 50 ohms. So current is voltage over resistance. 50V divided by 50 ohms is 1 Amp. So the incident current pulse should be 1 A. Looking at the options, I see that options A, F, H, I, and J have incident currents of 1, 1.5, etc. So maybe looking for 1 A. Let's see which options have that. Option C has 0.75, which is 50/ (50*1.5?) Hmm no, I think I calculated it right. So options with 1 A are A, F, H, I, J. Wait, no, option A's incident current is 1.5 A. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. The line has a characteristic resistance of 50 ohms. So when the pulse is incident, before hitting the load, the line is essentially the same as the source impedance. So the incident current would be V_incident divided by Z0. So 50V / 50Ω equals 1 A. So the incident current is 1 A. So looking for that in the options.

Next, the reflection coefficient. The formula for reflection coefficient when a wave hits a load is (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0). Wait, no, the reflection coefficient Γ is (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0) when it's from the incident side. So Z_L is the load impedance. Here, Z_L is 30 ohms, and Z0 is 50 ohms. So Γ = (30 -50)/(30+50) = (-20)/80 = -0.25. Oh, so reflection coefficient is -0.25. So which options have that? Looking, option I has reflection coefficient -0.25.

Wait, let me check other options. Option B: -0.5? No. Option E: -0.1. Option G: -0.2. Option I: -0.25. So that's a point towards option I.

So moving on, the reflected voltage pulse is Γ multiplied by the incident voltage. So 50V times (-0.25) gives -12.5 V. So the reflected voltage is -12.5 V. Looking at the options, option I says reflected voltage is -12.5 V. That matches.

The reflected current pulse would be the reflected voltage divided by the characteristic impedance, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Oh wait, the reflected current is the reflection coefficient multiplied by the incident current. Because the current reflection is given by Γ. So since incident current is 1 A, reflected current is Γ times that. So 1 A multiplied by -0.25 is -0.25 A. But wait, wait. Alternatively, since voltage is V = I * Z. Reflected voltage is Γ * V_inc, and reflected current is Γ * I_inc. Wait, let me think again. The incident current is I_inc = V_inc / Z0. The reflected current I_refl is Γ * I_inc, but with a negative sign because the current reflects in the opposite direction. Wait, no, the reflection coefficient for current is actually -Γ. Because when a wave reflects, the voltage and current have opposite signs.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me recall: The reflection coefficient for voltage is Γ = (Z_L - Z0)/(Z_L + Z0). For current, the reflection coefficient is -Γ. Because when the voltage is reflected, the current's reflection is opposite. So the reflected current I_reflect is -Γ * I_inc.

Wait no, another approach. The reflected current is (V_reflected) / Z0. Since V_reflected is Γ * V_incident, and V_incident is I_incident * Z0. So V_reflected is Γ * I_inc * Z0. Then I_reflected is V_reflected / Z0 = Γ * I_inc.

Wait, that would mean I_reflected is Γ * I_inc. So if Γ is -0.25, then I_reflected is -0.25 * 1 A = -0.25 A. But wait, some sources say that the reflected current is negative because it's going in the opposite direction. So in terms of magnitude, the reflected current is 0.25 A, but direction is opposite.

But in terms of the actual value, the reflected current is -0.25 A. But looking at the options, option I says Reflected Current Pulse is 0.25 Amperes. Wait, that's positive 0.25. Hmm, but according to our calculation, it's -0.25. So why is it positive in the option? Maybe the question is just giving the magnitude, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of phasors or just magnitudes. The reflection coefficient is negative, so the reflected current is in the opposite direction. But the options are probably giving the magnitude for the current. So maybe the reflected current is 0.25 A, but direction is opposite. So in option I, the reflected current is 0.25 A. So that matches.

So for option I: Reflected Current Pulse is 0.25 Amperes. That seems correct.

Now, the net voltage at the load. The net voltage is the sum of the incident and reflected voltage. So V_net = V_incident + V_reflected. V_incident is 50 V, V_reflected is -12.5 V. So 50 -12.5 = 37.5 V. So net voltage is 37.5 V. Option I says Net voltage is 37.5 V. That's correct.

Net current at the load: It's the incident current minus the reflected current. Because the incident current is going into the load, and the reflected current is coming back. So I_net = I_incident - I_reflected.

Wait, I_incident is 1 A. I_reflected is 0.25 A (but direction is opposite, so when you subtract, it's 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 A? Or perhaps I_incident is 1 A, and I_reflected is -0.25 A. So net current is 1 + (-0.25) = 0.75 A? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the current flows in the line as incident and reflected. The net current is the incident current minus the reflected current because the reflected is in the opposite direction. So I_net = I_inc - I_ref.

Wait, if I_inc is 1 A forward, and I_ref is 0.25 A backward, then the net current is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 A forward. But according to option I, the net current is 1.25 A. Hmm, that doesn't match. So what did I do wrong here?

Wait, maybe I got the direction mixed up. Let me think again. The incident current I_inc is 1 A. The reflected current I_ref is -0.25 A, because it's going in the opposite direction. So when you add them, the net current is 1 + (-0.25) = 0.75 A. But option I says net current is 1.25 A. That's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating the net current. Let me think differently. The net current is I_inc + I_ref, but considering their directions. Alternatively, the net current entering the load is the incident current minus the reflected current.

Wait, the correct formula is that the net current is I_incident minus the reflected current. Because the reflected current is flowing back. So I_net = I_inc - |I_ref|. So if I_inc is 1 A, and I_ref is 0.25 A, then I_net is 0.75 A. So option I says net current is 1.25 A, which doesn't match. Hmm, so that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formulas. Let me double-check. The correct approach: The load impedance is Z_L. The incident voltage is V_inc, and the reflected voltage is V_ref. The net voltage is V_inc + V_ref. V_inc is 50 V, V_ref is -12.5 V, so net is 37.5 V. The net current is (V_inc - V_ref)/Z0? No, wait, the net current is the current flowing into the load, which is V_net divided by Z_L. Oh right! Because the load is Z_L, so current is voltage over resistance.

So I_net = V_net / Z_L = 37.5 V / 30 Ω = 1.25 A. Oh, that's where the 1.25 comes from. So in option I, the net current is indeed 1.25 A. So that matches.

Wait, why did I think it was 0.75 earlier? Because I was adding the currents directly, which was a mistake. Instead, the correct approach is to find the net voltage, then divide by the load resistance to get the current. So that makes sense.

So now, let me recap the findings:

Incident Current: 1 A (only in options A, F, H, I, J)

Reflection Coefficient: -0.25 (only in option I)

Reflected Voltage: -12.5 V (only in I)

Reflected Current: 0.25 A (only in I)

Net Voltage: 37.5 V (only in I)

Net Current: 37.5 /30 = 1.25 A (only in I)

So all these match option I.

Looking at the other options, none of them have all these correct. For example, option A has reflection coefficient -0.3, which is wrong. Option C has reflection coefficient 0, which would be if Z_L=Z0, but that's not the case here. Option G has reflection coefficient -0.2, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer is option I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation where a 50 V pulse is incident on a 30 Ω load in a transmission line with a characteristic resistance of 50 Ω. The goal is to determine the incident current, reflection coefficient, reflected voltage, reflected current, and the net voltage and current at the load.

### Step 1: Incident Current
The incident current is calculated using Ohm's law:  
\[
I_{\text{incident}} = \frac{V_{\text{incident}}}{Z_0} = \frac{50 \, \text{V}}{50 \, \Omega} = 1 \, \text{A}.
\]  
This matches options A, F, H, I, and J.

### Step 2: Reflection Coefficient
The reflection coefficient is given by:  
\[
\Gamma = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0} = \frac{30 - 50}{30 + 50} = \frac{-20}{80} = -0.25.
\]  
This matches option I. Other options have incorrect reflection coefficients.

### Step 3: Reflected Voltage
The reflected voltage is calculated as:  
\[
V_{\text{reflected}} = \Gamma \cdot V_{\text{incident}} = -0.25 \cdot 50 \, \text{V} = -12.5 \, \text{V}.
\]  
This matches option I.

### Step 4: Reflected Current
The reflected current is calculated as:  
\[
I_{\text{reflected}} = \Gamma \cdot I_{\text{incident}} = -0.25 \cdot 1 \, \text{A} = -0.25 \, \text{A}.
\]  
Option I gives the magnitude of the reflected current as \( 0.25 \, \text{A} \), which is consistent with the calculation.

### Step 5: Net Voltage at the Load
The net voltage at the load is the sum of the incident and reflected voltages:  
\[
V_{\text{net}} = V_{\text{incident}} + V_{\text{reflected}} = 50 \, \text{V} + (-12.5 \, \text{V}) = 37.5 \, \text{V}.
\]  
This matches option I.

### Step 6: Net Current at the Load
The net current at the load is determined by dividing the net voltage by the load resistance:  
\[
I_{\text{net}} = \frac{V_{\text{net}}}{Z_L} = \frac{37.5 \, \text{V}}{30 \, \Omega} = 1.25 \, \text{A}.
\]  
This matches option I.

### Final Answer
Option I is the only choice that correctly calculates all the required quantities:  
- Incident Current: \( 1 \, \text{A} \)  
- Reflection Coefficient: \( -0.25 \)  
- Reflected Voltage: \( -12.5 \, \text{V} \)  
- Reflected Current: \( 0.25 \, \text{A} \)  
- Net Voltage: \( 37.5 \, \text{V} \)  
- Net Current: \( 1.25 \, \text{A} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I**
