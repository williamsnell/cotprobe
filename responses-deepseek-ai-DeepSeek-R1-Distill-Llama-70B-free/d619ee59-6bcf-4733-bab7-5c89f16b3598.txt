Okay, so I've got this question about the frustration-displaced aggression theory of prejudice. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that theories about prejudice try to explain why people have these biased attitudes or behaviors towards others. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The question gives me multiple choices, from A to J. I need to pick the correct one that describes the frustration-displaced aggression theory. Let's think about each option.

Option A says it's about a lack of understanding other cultures. That sounds more like a contact hypothesis or cultural awareness issue, not frustration. So probably not A.

Option B suggests it's learned behavior from parents or society. Oh wait, that's more like the social learning theory, where people learn prejudice through observation and imitation. So B is likely not the correct answer here.

Option C claims prejudice is based on personality type, unaffected by external factors. I think that's more related to the authoritarian personality theory, which links certain rigid personalities to prejudice. So C is probably not it.

Option D says prejudice is innate and can't change. I don't think that's any specific theory I know. Most theories suggest it's learned or influenced by environment, not innate. So D is probably wrong.

Option E is a bit lengthy. It says that frustration towards a goal leads to aggression, and if the source is unavailable, the aggression is displaced onto a scapegoat. Oh yeah, that rings a bell. The frustration-aggression hypothesis was proposed by Dollard and others, right? It says that when people can't address the real source of their frustration, they take it out on others, often minority groups. So E sounds correct.

Option F links prejudice to stress levels. I'm not sure about a direct theory here. Maybe stress can contribute, but I don't think that's the specific name of this theory. So F is probably not it.

Option G talks about competition for resources. That's the realistic conflict theory, where groups compete for resources leading to prejudice. So G is a different theory.

Option H says it's a defense mechanism for self-esteem. That's more like the psychodynamic perspective where people might use prejudice to boost their self-image. But I don't think that's the frustration-displaced aggression theory.

Option I mentions feeling powerless leading to prejudice. Maybe that's part of some other theory, but I don't recall it being the main point of this specific theory.

Option J is about justifying attitudes with logic or morality. That sounds like rationalization or maybe cognitive dissonance, but not directly related to frustration causing displaced aggression.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. It's the one that directly ties frustration leading to displaced aggression onto a scapegoat when the original source is unavailable.

The frustration-displaced aggression theory of prejudice is best described by option E. It explains that when individuals experience frustration due to obstacles in achieving their goals, they may displace their aggression onto a scapegoat, especially if the actual source of frustration is unavailable or threatening. This aligns with the frustration-aggression hypothesis proposed by Dollard and others.
