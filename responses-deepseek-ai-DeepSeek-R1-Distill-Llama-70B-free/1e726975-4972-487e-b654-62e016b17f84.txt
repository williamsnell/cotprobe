Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Although in Protestant Europe, [Peter the Great] was surrounded by evidence of the new civil and political rights of individual men embodied in constitutions, bills of rights and parliaments, he did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.
—Robert K. Massie, Peter the Great: His Life and World

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Peter the Great and his policies when he ruled Russia. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking which practice Peter continued. The options are A through I, each representing a different policy or system. The passage provided gives some clues about his approach.

In the passage, it says that although Peter was exposed to constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments in Protestant Europe, he didn't bring back the idea of sharing power. Instead, he was determined to change Russia himself, providing direction and force. It mentions he might flog the nation forward if necessary, which suggests he was pretty authoritarian.

So, Peter didn't introduce constitutions (A) or parliaments (I), nor did he promote democratic governance (C) or decentralization (D). Those options don't fit because the passage says he didn't share power. Also, he wasn't about abolishing the monarchy (G) because he was the ruler, so that's out.

Options B and H are about free trade and isolationism. The passage doesn't really talk about economic policies like trade, so I'm not sure about B or H. But since the focus is on governance and power, maybe these aren't the right choices.

Now, E is serfdom and F is emancipation. The passage doesn't explicitly mention serfs, but I remember that Peter the Great actually increased the control over serfs. He didn't free them; in fact, serfdom became more entrenched during his reign. So F is about emancipation, which wasn't happening then, so E is more likely correct.

Wait, but the options are about continuing a practice. If Peter continued serfdom, that would make sense because he didn't reform that area. He was more focused on modernizing the state and military, but kept the existing social structures in place, including serfdom.

So the answer should be E: Serfdom.

The passage describes Peter the Great's authoritarian approach to ruling Russia, emphasizing his determination to direct and force change without sharing power. This aligns with the continuation of serfdom, as he maintained the existing social structures. 

Answer: E
