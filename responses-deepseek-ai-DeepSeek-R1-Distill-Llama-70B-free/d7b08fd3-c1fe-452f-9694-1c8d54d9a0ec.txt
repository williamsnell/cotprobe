Okay, so I need to figure out which of these games isn't played with cards. Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A is euchre. I think that's a card game, probably trick-taking like bridge or hearts. So it uses cards.

Option B is craps. Hmm, I'm pretty sure craps is a dice game. You roll dice, right? So that's probably the one without cards.

Option C is bridge. Definitely a card game, it's a popular one with bidding and tricks.

Option D is solitaire. That's also a card game, often played alone with a deck.

Option E is poker. Obviously uses cards, with different hands and betting.

Option F is blackjack. Also a card game, where you try to get 21 without busting.

Option G is hearts. Another card game, similar to spades or bridge, where you pass cards around.

Option H is baccarat. That's a card game too, often found in casinos, comparing hands of banker and player.

Option I is rummy. Definitely a card game where you make sets and runs.

So putting it all together, the only game not played with cards is craps, which uses dice. So the answer should be B.
