Okay, so I have this problem about a DC machine operating as a motor. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know. The machine was originally a generator, but now it's being used as a motor. I need to find the back EMF, the required armature current, and the armature voltage when it's supplying a certain load.

Alright, let's start by listing the given information. The generator has 6 poles and 30 slots with a lap-wound armature. The armature constant, Ka, is 9.55. The field flux per pole is 0.04 Weber. The speed is 3000 rpm when it's a generator, but as a motor, the speed is 4000 rpm. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says when it's operated as a motor, the speed is 4000 rpm, and it needs to supply a torque of 50 N-m. The armature resistance is 0.075 ohms.

Wait, I think when it's a generator, the no-load voltage is given as 418.9 V, but as a motor, the flux is the same, 0.04 Wb per pole. So I probably don't need the generator data except for the Ka value. Maybe the Ka is the same when it's a motor?

Wait, Ka is the armature constant, which relates to the winding. Since it's lap wound, Ka is probably (P/A), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Ka is often given as the number of conductors multiplied by flux and other factors. Wait, I think the formula for induced voltage in a generator is E = (PφNZ)/(60A), where P is poles, φ flux per pole, N speed in rpm, Z number of conductors, A number of parallel paths. But for a lap winding, A = P, right? Because each pole has one parallel path.

Wait, the machine is lap wound, so number of parallel paths (A) equals the number of poles (P). So in this case, P is 6, so A is 6. So for the generator, the no-load voltage is given as 418.9 V. Let me see if that makes sense. Let me try to calculate that.

Wait, the generator's voltage E is given by E = (K_a * φ * N) / 60. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, E = (PφNZ)/(60A). But K_a might be a different term. Maybe K_a is PφZ/(60), so E = K_a * N / A. Hmm, not sure. Let me try using the given K_a.

Wait, the problem says the armature constant K_a is 9.55. Oh wait, I think for a DC machine, when used as a generator, the generated voltage E is E = K_a * I_f * speed. Or is that for motors? Wait, no, for generators, E = (φ Z P N)/(60 A). And for motors, the back EMF is E_b = (φ Z P N)/(60 A).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get back to the problem. Since the machine is now a motor, I need to find the back EMF when it's running at 4000 rpm.

Wait, the back EMF in a motor is given by E_b = (φ Z P N)/(60 A). But I don't know Z, the number of armature conductors. Hmm, but perhaps I can find Z from the generator data.

Wait, the generator has 30 slots, and it's lap wound, so the number of conductors per path is Z/A, which is Z/6. But wait, in a lap winding, each parallel path has Z/P conductors. So for 30 slots, each slot has two conductors (assuming it's a wave winding?), no, wait, lap windings usually have as many parallel paths as poles, so each path has Z/6 conductors. Wait, but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe I can find Z from the generator's no-load voltage. Let's think: when the machine was a generator, the no-load voltage is 418.9 V. Using the formula E = (φ Z P N)/(60 A). We know φ is 0.04 Wb, P=6, N=3000 rpm, A=6 (since lap wound). So plugging in:

E = (0.04 * Z * 6 * 3000) / (60 * 6). Let me compute that. So 0.04 * Z * 6 * 3000 = 0.04*6*3000 * Z = 720 Z. Then divide by (60*6)=360. So 720 Z / 360 = 2 Z. So E = 2Z = 418.9 V. So Z is 418.9 / 2 = 209.45. Wait, that can't be right because the number of conductors should be an integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the formula is E = (φ Z N P) / (60 A). So let's recalculate. So E = (0.04 * Z * 3000 * 6) / (60 * 6). So 0.04 * 3000 is 120, multiplied by Z *6 is 720 Z. Divide by 60 *6 = 360. So 720 Z / 360 = 2 Z. So 2 Z =418.9 V → Z=209.45. Hmm, same result. But that's not an integer, which is odd. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe K_a is given as 9.55, and E = K_a * I_f * N. But I don't know I_f. Alternatively, maybe the generator's E is given by E = K_a * N. Let me try that: E = 9.55 * N. Wait, but N is in rpm, which is 3000. 9.55 * 3000 is 28650 V, which is way too high. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me check the formula for the armature constant K_a. Wait, I think K_a is given by (φ Z)/(60 A) ), so E = K_a * P * N. Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Alternatively, maybe K_a is (P * φ * Z) / (60 * A).

Wait, let me see. The standard formula for generated voltage (E) is E = (φ Z N P) / (60 A). So rearranging, K_a could be (φ Z P) / (60 A). So E = K_a * N. So in the generator case, E = K_a * N. So when it's a generator, E = 9.55 * 3000 rpm. Let me compute that: 9.55 * 3000 = 28650 volts. But the given no-load voltage is 418.9 V. That's way off. So I must be misunderstanding K_a.

Wait, perhaps K_a is defined differently. Alternatively, maybe K_a is (φ Z) / (2A), because for a motor, torque is T = (P φ I_a Z) / (2π A). Or something like that. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, when the machine is a motor, the back EMF E_b is calculated as E_b = (φ Z P N) / (60 A). But I don't know Z, but maybe I can compute Z from the generator data.

In the generator, no-load voltage E = (φ Z P N) / (60 A) = 418.9 V.

Given φ=0.04 Wb, P=6, N=3000 rpm, A=6.

So let me plug in the numbers:

418.9 = (0.04 * Z * 6 * 3000) / (60 * 6).

Calculating denominator: 60 *6=360.

Numerator: 0.04 *6 *3000 = 720; so 720 * Z.

So 720 Z / 360 = 2 Z.

So 2 Z =418.9 → Z=209.45. Hmm, but that's not a whole number, which seems odd. Wait, perhaps the slots are 30, so number of conductors is 30 * 2 =60, because each slot has two conductors (assuming two layers). So Z would be 60? Or maybe that's not correct.

Wait, in a DC machine, the number of armature conductors Z is typically twice the number of slots because each slot has two conductors (one on each side). So for 30 slots, Z=60. Let me try that.

So if Z=60, then E = (0.04 *60 *6 *3000) / (60 *6 ) → 0.04*60=2.4, 2.4*6=14.4, 14.4*3000=43200. Divide by 60*6=360. So 43200/360=120 V. But wait, the given E is 418.9 V, which is higher than 120 V. So that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering Z.

Alternatively, maybe the number of conductors is 30 because it's lap wound. No, that doesn't make sense because each coil would have two conductors. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, when it's a motor, the torque is given as 50 Nm at 4000 rpm. So I can use the torque equation to find the armature current, then find the back EMF and the required voltage.

The torque equation for a DC motor is T = (P φ I_a Z) / (2π A). Or perhaps T = (I_a φ Z P)/(6 A). Wait, I think the correct formula is T = (I_a * φ * Z * P) / (2π A). Or maybe T = (I_a * φ * Z * P) / (6 * A). I'm getting confused.

Wait, the general formula for torque in a DC motor is T = (P φ I_a Z) / (6 A), where P is the number of poles, φ is flux per pole, I_a is armature current, Z is number of conductors, and A is number of parallel paths. Since it's a lap winding, A = P =6.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I've seen torque expressed as T = (I_a * φ * Z * P) / (2π * A). But I'm not certain.

Wait, another formula I remember is T = (I_a * K_a * speed) / (2π), but that might not be correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, for a motor, the induced voltage (back EMF) is E_b = (φ Z P N) / (60 A). And the mechanical power is E_b * I_a, but considering losses. Also, the torque can be found from T = (Power) / (ω), where ω is angular velocity in radians per second.

Wait, let's try that approach. So if I can find the back EMF E_b, then E_b = (φ Z P N) / (60 A). Once I have E_b, then the armature current I_a can be found from the torque equation. So T = (E_b * I_a * η) / (ω), but I'm not sure about the efficiency η. Alternatively, since the armature resistance is given, I can use the voltage and current relationship.

Wait, let me think step by step.

First, part (a) is to find the back EMF when the motor is operating at 4000 rpm. So E_b would be (φ Z P N) / (60 A). But I don't know Z yet. Alternatively, maybe I can find Z from the generator's no-load voltage.

Wait, when it's a generator, E = (φ Z P N) / (60 A). So 418.9 V = (0.04 * Z *6 *3000) / (60 *6).

Wait, let's compute this again. φ=0.04, P=6, N=3000, A=6.

So E = (0.04 * Z *6 *3000) / (60 *6).

Simplify denominator: 60 *6=360.

Numerator: 0.04 *6=0.24, 0.24 *3000=720. So 720*Z.

720Z /360 = 2Z.

So 2Z =418.9 → Z=209.45. Hmm, fractional conductors? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the generator's no-load voltage is 418.9 V, which is E = V + I_a R_a. But no, at no load, I_a is zero, so E=V. So E is 418.9 V in that case.

Wait, maybe the armature constant K_a is given as 9.55, so perhaps E = K_a * N. Let me try that: 9.55 *3000 = 28650 V, which is way too high. So that's not correct.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to find Z another way. Alternatively, perhaps the number of conductors Z can be found from the slots. Since the machine has 30 slots and it's lap wound, each parallel path has Z/A = Z/6 conductors. But for a lap winding, the number of conductors per path is usually (number of slots × number of conductors per slot) / number of poles. Wait, assuming each slot has two conductors (because in a lap winding, each coil has two sides), so Z=30 ×2=60. So Z=60.

If Z=60, let's compute E in the generator case:

E = (0.04 *60 *6 *3000)/(60 *6) → Let's compute step by step.

0.04 *60 =2.4.

2.4 *6=14.4.

14.4 *3000=43200.

Denominator: 60 *6=360.

So 43200 /360=120 V. But the given E is 418.9 V. So 120 V is way lower. So this suggests that Z is not 60. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about Z. Perhaps Z is 30? Then E would be (0.04 *30 *6 *3000)/(60*6) → 0.04*30=1.2, 1.2 *6=7.2, 7.2*3000=21600. Divided by 360 → 60 V. Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The armature constant K_a is given as 9.55. Maybe K_a is (φ Z P)/(60 A). So E = K_a * N. Let's test that. When N=3000, E=9.55 *3000=28650 V. But the given E is 418.9 V. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps K_a is (φ Z P )/(60 A). So then E = K_a * N. So 9.55 *3000=28650 V. But that's way higher than 418.9 V. So perhaps K_a is defined differently.

Alternatively, perhaps K_a is (φ Z )/(60 A). Then E = K_a * P * N. So E= (φ Z/(60 A)) * P * N. So that would be E= (φ Z P N )/(60 A), which is the standard formula. So if K_a is (φ Z)/(60 A), then K_a is (0.04 * Z )/(60 *6) )= (0.04 Z )/360.

Given K_a is 9.55, so 0.04 Z /360 = 9.55 → Z = (9.55 *360 ) /0.04.

Calculating that: 9.55 *360=3438, 3438 /0.04= 85950. That can't be right. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I should give up on finding Z and instead use the fact that when the machine is a motor, the back EMF is given by the same formula as when it was a generator, just at a different speed. Because the flux is the same, and the winding is the same, so Z, P, A are the same.

Wait, in the generator case, E = (φ Z P N_gen)/(60 A) =418.9 V.

As a motor, E_b = (φ Z P N_motor)/(60 A).

So the ratio of E_b to E would be (N_motor / N_gen). So E_b =418.9 V * (4000/3000 )=418.9 * (4/3)≈ 418.9 *1.3333≈ 559.2 V. But wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the back EMF is around 150-200 V. So maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, no, that's because the generator's E is at 3000 rpm, but the motor is operating at 4000 rpm. So E_b = E_gen * (N_motor / N_gen) =418.9 * (4000/3000) = 418.9*(4/3)≈ 559 V. But that's way higher than any of the options, which suggests I'm doing something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the armature resistance is involved. Wait, but no, the back EMF is independent of the resistance. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the armature constant K_a is given as 9.55, which is (φ Z P )/(60 A). So K_a=9.55=(0.04 * Z *6 )/(60 *6 )= (0.04 Z )/(60 ). So 0.04 Z /60 =9.55 → Z= (9.55 *60 )/0.04 = 9.55 *1500=14325. That can't be right. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps K_a is (φ Z )/(60 A). So K_a= (0.04 * Z )/(60 *6 )= (0.04 Z )/(360 )=9.55.

So 0.04 Z =9.55 *360 → Z=(9.55 *360 )/0.04 = (3438)/0.04= 85950. Again, impossible.

I'm stuck on finding Z. Maybe I can approach the problem differently. Since the machine is operating as a motor, I can use torque to find the current, then use that to find E_b and the
