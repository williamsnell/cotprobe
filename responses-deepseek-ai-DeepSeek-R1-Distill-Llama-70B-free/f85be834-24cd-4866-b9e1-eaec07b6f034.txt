Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this psychology question about World War II and scapegoating. I remember that the question is about identifying which psychological concept explains blaming a minority group for societal problems. Let's break it down.

The question says that millions of Jews and others were slaughtered because they were blamed for Germany's financial and social issues. So the scenario is about a group being scapegoated for problems they didn't cause. I need to match this scenario to the correct psychological term.

I think the key here is understanding the defense mechanisms. Let me recall some of them. There's displacement, projection, rationalization, repression, and others. 

Scapegoating is when a person or group is blamed for the wrongs of others. This sounds a lot like a defense mechanism. Now, which one?

Projection is when someone attributes their own unacceptable desires or feelings to someone else. Like if someone is angry but can't express it, they might accuse others of being angry. But in this case, the Germans are blaming Jews for their country's problems, not necessarily their own feelings.

Displacement is redirecting emotions to a different target. For example, if someone is mad at their boss but takes it out on their family. So if the Germans were frustrated with their economy and took it out on Jews, that could be displacement because they're redirecting their anger towards a different group.

Rationalization is making excuses to justify behavior. Like if someone fails a test and says it's because the questions were unfair, not because they didn't study. But in this case, the blaming is more about redirecting anger, not justifying it with reasons.

Wait, could it be projection? If the Germans had negative qualities they didn't want to acknowledge and projected them onto Jews, that might fit. But the question seems more about the action of blaming others for their problems, not necessarily the projection of their own qualities.

Alternatively, displacement makes sense because the target of their frustration (economic issues) is being redirected to an unrelated group (Jews). They're not addressing the real issues but displacing their anger.

So the options given are A to J, and the correct term is displacement. Looking at the options, J is displacement. So the answer should be J.

The scenario describes scapegoating, where a group is blamed for societal problems they didn't cause. This aligns with displacement, a defense mechanism where emotions are redirected toward a different target. The correct answer is:

J: displacement

Answer: J
