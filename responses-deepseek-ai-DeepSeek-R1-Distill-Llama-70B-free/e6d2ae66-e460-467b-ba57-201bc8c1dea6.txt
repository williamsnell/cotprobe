Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the rotational partition function of an asymmetric rotor molecule. The molecule is NOF, and it has three rotational constants: 3.1752 cm⁻¹, 0.3951 cm⁻¹, and 0.3505 cm⁻¹. The temperature is 25°C, which is 298.15 K. Hmm, I remember that the rotational partition function for an asymmetric rotor has a specific formula, but wait, what is it again?

Wait, I think for diatomic molecules, it's something like q = (T/(θ_rot)) * something, but that's for diatomic. Oh right, for a linear molecule, the rotational partition function is (8π² (k T)/(h²))^(something) times the moment of inertia. But NOF is an asymmetric rotor, which is a nonlinear molecule. So it's a different formula.

Oh right! For an asymmetric rotor, the rotational partition function is given by q = (8π² (k T)/(h²))^(3/2) * sqrt( (I_a I_b I_c) ) / sigma. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think for linear molecules (diatomic) it's (T/(θ_rot)) terms. For nonlinear molecules, including asymmetric rotors, the formula is different.

Wait, I should get this right. Let me think. The general formula for the rotational partition function of a nonlinear molecule is q_rot = (sqrt(π)/σ) * ( (8π² k T)/(h²) )^(3/2) * sqrt( I_a I_b I_c ), where I_a, I_b, I_c are the principal moments of inertia, and σ is the symmetry number.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the moments of inertia are expressed in terms of the rotational constants. Oh right, because rotational constants B are related to the moments of inertia as B = h/(8π² c I), so I = h/(8π² c B). So each I is inversely proportional to the corresponding B.

So substituting I_a, I_b, I_c into the formula, let's see. Let me write the formula:

q_rot = (sqrt(π)/σ) * ( (8π² k T)/(h²) )^(3/2) * sqrt( (h/(8π² c B_a)) * (h/(8π² c B_b)) * (h/(8π² c B_c)) ) )

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me simplify this step by step.

First, the term (8π² k T / h²)^(3/2) is one part. Then, the moments of inertia product is I_a I_b I_c. So, substituting I = h/(8π² c B) for each:

I_a I_b I_c = [ h/(8π² c B_a) ) ] * [ h/(8π² c B_b) ) ] * [ h/(8π² c B_c) ) ]

That's (h^3) / ( (8π² c)^3 B_a B_b B_c )

So, sqrt(I_a I_b I_c) = sqrt( h^3 / (8π² c)^3 B_a B_b B_c ) )

Which is h^(3/2) / [ (8π² c)^(3/2) (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2) ) ]

Putting this back into q_rot:

q_rot = (sqrt(π) / σ) * ( (8π² k T / h²) )^(3/2) * [ h^(3/2) / ( (8π² c)^(3/2) (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2) ) ) ]

Hmm, let's see. Let's break down the terms:

The first part is (sqrt(π)/σ).

The second part is (8π² k T / h² )^(3/2) which can be written as (8π²)^(3/2) (k T)^(3/2) / h^3.

Wait, (a^b)^c = a^(b*c), so ( (8π² k T)/(h²) )^(3/2) = (8π²)^(3/2) (k T)^(3/2) / h^3.

Then, the third part is h^(3/2) divided by (8π² c)^(3/2) times (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2).

So putting it together:

q_rot = [sqrt(π) / σ ] * [ (8π²)^(3/2) (k T)^(3/2) / h^3 ] * [ h^(3/2) / ( (8π² c)^(3/2) (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2) ) ) ]

Simplify term by term.

First, the (8π²)^(3/2) divided by (8π² c)^(3/2) ?

Wait, (8π²)^(3/2) / (8π² c)^(3/2) = [ (8π²) / (8π² c) ) ]^(3/2 ) = (1/c)^(3/2) = 1/(c^(3/2)).

Then, the h terms: denominator has h^3, numerator has h^(3/2). So h^(3/2) / h^3 = 1/h^(3 - 3/2) ) = 1/h^(3/2) ?

Wait, h^(3/2) divided by h^3 is h^(3/2 -3) = h^(-3/2) = 1/h^(3/2).

Wait, let me recheck.

(Second term numerator is (k T)^(3/2) )
(Second term denominator is h^3 )

Third term numerator is h^(3/2)
Third term denominator is (8π² c)^(3/2) (B... )^(1/2)

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect all the terms and see.

So, term1: sqrt(π)/σ

term2: (8π²)^(3/2) (k T)^(3/2) / h^3

term3: h^(3/2) / [ (8π² c)^(3/2) (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2) ]

Multiply all together:

term1 * term2 * term3 =

sqrt(π)/(σ) * [ (8π²)^(3/2) (k T)^(3/2) / h^3 ] * [ h^(3/2) / ( (8π² c)^(3/2) (B... )^(1/2) ) ) ]

Now, let's multiply numerators and denominators:

Numerators:

sqrt(π) * (8π²)^(3/2) * (k T)^(3/2) * h^(3/2)

Denominators:

σ * h^3 * (8π² c)^(3/2) * (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2)

Simplify each part.

First, (8π²)^(3/2) divided by (8π² c)^(3/2) is (8π² / (8π² c))^(3/2) ) = (1/c)^(3/2) = 1/(c^(3/2)).

Then, h^(3/2) in numerator and h^3 in denominator: h^(3/2 -3) = h^(-3/2) = 1/h^(3/2).

So now, the expression becomes:

sqrt(π)/(σ) * (k T)^(3/2) * [ 1/(c^(3/2) ) ] * [ 1/h^(3/2) ) ] * [ 1/( (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2) ) ]

Wait, let me reorganize:

= [ sqrt(π) / σ ] * [ (k T)^(3/2) ) ] * [ 1/( c^(3/2) h^(3/2) (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2) ) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps factor out the exponents:

= [ sqrt(π) / σ ] * [ (k T) / ( c h (B_a B_b B_c )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(3/2 )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let's express everything in terms of the rotational constants.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since B = h/(8π² c I), rearranged, I = h/(8π² c B). So I_a I_b I_c = h^3 / ( (8π² c)^3 B_a B_b B_c )

So, sqrt(I_a I_b I_c) = h^(3/2) / ( (8π² c)^(3/2) (B_a B_b B_c)^(1/2) )

Then, the general formula is:

q_rot = (sqrt(π) / σ) * ( (8π² k T )/( h² ) )^(3/2 ) * sqrt( I_a I_b I_c )

Substituting sqrt(I_a I_b I_c):

= (sqrt(π)/σ) * ( (8π² k T )/( h² ) )^(3/2 ) * [ h^(3/2) / ( (8π² c )^(3/2) ( B_a B_b B_c )^(1/2) ) ) ]

Hmm, let's compute term by term.

The term ( (8π² k T )/( h² ) )^(3/2 ) equals (8π²)^(3/2) (k T)^(3/2) / h^3.

So when we multiply this by sqrt( I_a I_b I_c ), which is h^(3/2) / ( (8π² c )^(3/2) (B ... )^(1/2) )

Putting together:

sqrt(π)/σ * [ (8π²)^(3/2) (k T)^(3/2) / h^3 ] * [ h^(3/2) / ( (8π² c )^(3/2) (B ... )^(1/2) ) ]

Let me multiply the terms:

- (8π²)^(3/2) divided by (8π² c)^(3/2) is [ (8π²) / (8π² c) ) ]^(3/2) = (1/c)^(3/2).

- (k T)^(3/2) remains.

- h^3 in denominator, h^(3/2) in numerator: h^(3/2) / h^3 = 1 / h^(3/2).

Wait, but we have h^(3/2) in numerator and h^3 in denominator, so 1/h^(3/2) overall.

So putting it all together:

sqrt(π)/(σ) * (1/c^(3/2)) * (k T)^(3/2) * (1/h^(3/2)) * (1/( B_a B_b B_c )^(1/2) )

Hmm, let's factor these terms:

= sqrt(π) / σ * (k T / (c h ))^(3/2) * 1/( B_a B_b B_c )^(1/2 )

Wait, because (k T)^(3/2) / (c^(3/2) h^(3/2)) ) = (k T / (c h ))^(3/2).

And 1/( B_a B_b B_c )^(1/2 ) is the square root of the inverse of the product of the rotational constants.

So, q_rot = sqrt(π)/(σ) * (k T/(c h ))^(3/2) / sqrt( B_a B_b B_c )

Wait, but what's the value of the constants here? Let's recall the values.

k is Boltzmann's constant, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light.

But wait, I think there's a way to express this in terms of the rotational temperature, but perhaps it's easier to compute it numerically.

Given that, let's note down the constants:

k = 1.380649 × 10⁻²³ J/K

h = 6.62607015 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s

c = 2.99792458 × 10^10 cm/s

T is 298.15 K.

Rotational constants are given as 3.1752 cm⁻¹, 0.3951 cm⁻¹, and 0.3505 cm⁻¹.

But wait, B is usually given in cm⁻¹, which is energy per unit spin? Or rather, the rotational constant B is related to the energy levels as E_J = B J (J+1), I think.

But the unit of B is cm⁻¹, which is energy (since E = h c B, where B is in cm⁻¹), so h c B has units of energy.

So, now, let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute (k T) / (c h )

k T: 1.380649e-23 J/K * 298.15 K ≈ 4.114e-21 J.

c h: (2.9979e10 cm/s) * (6.62607e-34 J·s) = let's compute that.

Wait, cm is 0.01 m, so 2.9979e10 cm/s = 2.9979e8 m/s.

So, c = 2.9979e8 m/s.

h = 6.62607e-34 J·s.

So c h = 2.9979e8 m/s * 6.62607e-34 J·s = ?

Let me compute that:

2.9979e8 * 6.62607e-34 = Let's compute 3e8 * 6.6e-34 = 1.98e-25, but more accurately.

2.9979e8 = 2.9979 * 1e8.

6.62607e-34 = 6.62607 * 1e-34.

Multiply 2.9979 * 6.62607 ≈ let's compute 3 *6.626 is about 19.878, but 2.9979 is 3 -0.0021, so 2.9979 *6.62607 = ?

Let me compute 3 *6.62607 = 19.87821

But subtract 0.0021 * 6.62607 = 0.013933.

So 19.87821 - 0.013933 ≈ 19.86428.

So 2.9979e8 * 6.62607e-34 = 19.86428e(8-34) )= 1.986428e-25 J·m.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J·m is kg·m³/s².

But perhaps the units will cancel out later. Let's proceed.

So, kT is 4.114e-21 J.

c h is 1.9864e-25 J·m.

Wait, but in the term (k T) / (c h ), the units would be (J) / ( J·m ) ) = 1/m. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I messed up the units. Let me think again.

Wait, c is in cm/s, h in J·s.

So c h has units cm·J, but J is kg·m²/s², so cm·kg·m²/s².

But k T is in J (kg·m²/s²).

So (k T) / (c h ) has units [kg·m²/s²] / [ cm·kg·m²/s² ] ) = 1/cm.

Which is cm⁻¹, which makes sense because B is in cm⁻¹, so perhaps in the next step, when we have (kT/(c h ))^(3/2), it would have units cm^(-3/2).

But perhaps I should just proceed with the numbers.

So, (k T) = 4.114e-21 J.

c h = 2.9979e10 cm/s * 6.626e-34 J·s = 2.9979e10 * 6.626e-34 = ?

Let me compute 2.9979e10 *6.626e-34 = (2.9979 *6.626) * 1e(10-34) ) = 19.86 * 1e-24 = 1.986e-23 J·cm.

Wait, no: cm/s * J·s = (cm * J ) / s * s → cm·J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², cm is 1e-2 m. So cm·J is 1e-2 m * kg·m²/s² = 1e-2 kg·m³/s².

But perhaps it's easier to compute the numerical value.

So, 2.9979e10 cm/s * 6.626e-34 J·s = (2.9979 *6.626e(10-34) ) J·cm.

Wait, 2.9979e10 = 2.9979 * 1e10, 6.626e-34 is 6.626 *1e-34.

So 2.9979 *6.626 = approx 19.86, as before.

So 19.86e(10-34) = 1.986e-23 J·cm.

So c h = 1.986e-23 J·cm.

Now, (k T) / (c h ) = (4.114e-21 J ) / (1.986e-23 J·cm ) ) = (4.114 / 1.986 )e( -21 +23 ) cm⁻¹.

Compute 4.114/1.986: approximately 2.07 (since 2*1.986=3.97, and 4.114-3.97=0.144, so 0.144/1.986≈0.0725 → total approx 2.0725).

Exponent is 2 (because 10^(-21+23)=10^2=100).

So (k T)/(c h ) ≈ 2.0725 * 1e2 cm⁻¹ → 207.25 cm⁻¹.

Wait, that's a big number. But wait, rotational constants of NO
