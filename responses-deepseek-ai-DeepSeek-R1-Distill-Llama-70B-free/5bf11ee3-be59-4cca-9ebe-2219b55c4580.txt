Okay, so I've got this question about the three-box information processing model and where memories are first stored. Hmm, I remember this model from my psychology class. Let's see, the model has three main parts: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. 

Wait, the question is asking about the first place memories are stored. So I think it's the very first step when information comes in. Oh right, when we perceive something through our senses like sight or hearing, it's stored briefly in sensory memory. That's like a super short storage before we even process it. For example, when you see something, it's in your sensory memory for a split second before you either ignore it or pay attention.

So the options are A to J. Looking at the options, B is sensory memory, which I think is the correct answer. The other options don't fit as the first storage. Short-term memory is next, like when you hold info for a few seconds. Long-term is after that. Eidetic memory is a type of exceptional memory, but not the first storage. Episodic, explicit, semantic, implicit, procedural are all types of long-term memory categories, I believe.

So the first place must be sensory memory, which is option B.

The first place memories are stored in the three-box information processing model is sensory memory. This is where sensory information is briefly held before being processed further. 

Answer: B
