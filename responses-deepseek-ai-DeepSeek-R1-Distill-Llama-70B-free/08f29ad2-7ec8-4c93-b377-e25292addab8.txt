Question:

During a two-month span, there were 15 bank robberies in the city area. The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery. The prosecution seeks to introduce the ski mask and the money found in his home into evidence. A motion by the defendant's attorney to exclude the items will be

Options:

A: granted with respect to the money, but denied with respect to the ski mask.
B: granted, if the defendant can prove that the police did not have a valid warrant.
C: denied, if the prosecution can prove that the police had a valid warrant.
D: granted with respect to the money, if it can be proven that it was not obtained from the robberies.
E: granted with respect to the ski mask, but denied with respect to the money.
F: denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.
G: denied with respect to the money, if it can be proven that it was obtained from the robberies.
H: granted with respect to the ski mask, if it can be proven that it was obtained illegally.
I: denied with respect to the ski mask, if it can be proven that it was used in the robberies.
J: granted with respect to both the ski mask and the money.

Okay, so I've got this question about criminal procedure and evidence law. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. The scenario involves a defendant who's been arrested for bank robberies, and the police found some evidence in his home. The question is about whether that evidence will be admissible in court.

Alright, let's start by understanding the facts. There were 15 bank robberies, all done by one guy wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police got a tip from a reliable informant that the defendant was the one, so they got an arrest warrant. They went to his home, arrested him when he opened the door. He was in his underwear, asked to put on clothes. An officer asked if anyone else was there; he said no. The officer went with him to the bedroom. Defendant asked to get pants from the closet, but the officer checked the closet first, saw the ski mask, confiscated it.

Then, while they were in the bedroom, the other officer did a protective sweep of the rest of the house. In a storage room, found a box of $100 bills, which was part of the stolen money. Now, the prosecution wants to introduce both the ski mask and the money as evidence. The defendant's attorney is moving to exclude them.

So the question is whether the motion will be granted or denied, and for which items.

I remember that when police arrest someone in their home, certain searches are allowed without a separate search warrant. Let me think about the rules here.

First, the arrest was lawful because they had a valid arrest warrant. So entering the home to arrest him was okay. Now, when they're arresting him, they can conduct a search incident to arrest, but that's usually limited to the person and the area within his immediate control. Wait, but in this case, the officer accompanied him to the bedroom. So when the defendant asked to go into the closet, the officer searched it first. Is that a valid search?

I think that when a person is under arrest, police can search the areas immediately surrounding the person to ensure officer safety. But in this case, the closet was part of the bedroom where the arrest was happening. So the officer's search of the closet might be permissible as part of a protective sweep or search incident to arrest.

Wait, but the search incident to arrest (Chimel v. California) allows police to search the person and the area within their immediate reach. So in the bedroom, when the defendant is about to get clothes, the officer checking the closet could be seen as within the area the defendant could access, so maybe it's allowed. Therefore, the ski mask found in the closet would be admissible because the search was lawful.

Next, the other officer did a protective sweep of the house. I recall that a protective sweep is allowed after an arrest if the police have a reasonable belief that there are other dangerous people present. Here, the defendant said he was alone, but maybe the officer wasn't sure. Wait, but in Maryland v. Buie, protective sweeps are permitted if the officers have a reasonable suspicion that there are other dangerous people present. But in this case, the defendant said he was alone. So does that negate the reasonable suspicion?

Wait, but the police had just arrested a bank robber who was known to carry a machine gun. So even if the defendant said he was alone, the officers might still have a reasonable fear that there could be accomplices. So the protective sweep of the house might be justified.

But wait, the protective sweep is usually limited to areas immediately adjoining where the arrest occurs and places where someone might be hiding to ambush the officers. The storage room might be part of that. So when the officer went into the storage room and saw the box of money in plain sight, that would be admissible under the plain view doctrine.

Wait, but the plain view doctrine requires that the officer be lawfully present in the area where the evidence is found, and that the incriminating nature of the evidence is immediately apparent. So if the officer was lawfully in the storage room during a protective sweep, and the money was in a box visible, then it's admissible.

But wait, the money was in a box. If it's closed, maybe not plain view. But the question says the officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. So perhaps the box was open, or maybe the officer had to open it. Oh, but if the box was closed, the officer would need probable cause to search it, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, in a protective sweep, the officer can look for people, but not conduct a full search. So if the box was in plain view, but closed, the officer can't just open it without a warrant unless there's probable cause.

Wait, the question says "saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills." So perhaps the box was open, so the money was visible. Alternatively, maybe the box was transparent or the officer could see inside. If the money was in plain view, then the seizure is okay. But if the box was closed, then without opening it, the officer wouldn't know it's stolen money. Hmm.

But wait, the question states that the money was later determined to be part of the stolen money. So maybe the officer didn't know that at the time, but the box had a large amount, which might give him probable cause. Alternatively, perhaps the protective sweep allows the officer to look into places where people could hide, but not to search for evidence. So maybe the money in the box wasn't in plain view, but the officer had to open the box, which would be a search beyond the protective sweep.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The officer's partner did a protective sweep. During that, he entered a storage room and saw the box. If the box was in plain view and the contents were obvious (like if it was open or transparent), then the plain view applies, and the money can be seized. If the box was closed, then the officer would need a warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances to search it. But since the question doesn't specify whether the box was open, maybe I need to make an assumption based on the given information.

Alternatively, perhaps the money was in plain view, so the seizure was proper. But if the box was closed, then the officer might have needed a warrant, but perhaps the protective sweep allows a limited search.

Wait, no. A protective sweep allows officers to look for people, not to search for evidence. So if the box was closed, the officer wouldn't be allowed to open it without probable cause. But since the money was found, perhaps the box was open, making the contents visible. So the plain view doctrine would apply.

Alternatively, maybe the officer had probable cause to believe the box contained evidence of a crime, so he could search it under the automobile exception or something else. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but in the case of a protective sweep, the officer's search is limited. So if the box was in a closet or storage room, and the officer, while looking for people, sees the box and has probable cause to believe it contains evidence, maybe he can seize it without opening, but I think that's not how it works. The plain view doctrine requires that the incriminating nature be immediately apparent. So if the box is closed, the officer can't tell without opening it, so it wouldn't be plain view.

Wait, but the question says the officer "saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills." So perhaps the box was open, or the money was visible through it. So the officer could see the money in plain view, making the seizure lawful.

Putting this together: the ski mask was found during a search incident to arrest in the closet, so that's admissible. The money was found during a protective sweep, in plain view, so that's also admissible. Therefore, both items would be admitted, so the defendant's motion to exclude them would be denied.

Looking at the options, option F says denied with respect to both. Option C says denied if the prosecution can prove a valid warrant, but the warrant here was an arrest warrant, not a search warrant. Wait, but the initial entry was based on the arrest warrant. So the arrest was valid, and the subsequent searches were incident to that.

Wait, but when the officer searched the closet, was that a valid search? Because after the arrest, the defendant was under custody, so the area within his reach could be searched. The closet was part of the bedroom where the arrest was happening, so perhaps that's allowed.

So the ski mask was properly seized. The money, if in plain view during a lawful protective sweep, was also properly seized. So both are admissible, so the motion is denied. So option F is the correct answer.

The scenario involves a defendant arrested for bank robberies, and the police found evidence (a ski mask and money) in his home. The question is whether this evidence will be admissible in court. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Ski Mask**:  
   The police had a valid arrest warrant and lawfully entered the defendant's home. When the defendant asked to change clothes, the officer accompanied him to the bedroom. The officer searched the closet before allowing the defendant to enter, finding the ski mask. This search falls under the doctrine of search incident to arrest, which allows police to search areas within the defendant's immediate control for officer safety. Since the closet was part of the arrest scene, the search was lawful, and the ski mask is admissible.

2. **Money**:  
   While conducting a protective sweep of the house, the officer found a box containing a large amount of $100 bills in a storage room. A protective sweep is permissible if officers have a reasonable belief that others might be present to pose a danger. Although the defendant claimed to be alone, the officers could still have a reasonable suspicion due to the nature of the crime (bank robbery). The money was found in plain view, satisfying the plain view doctrine, which requires lawful presence, immediate visibility, and obvious incriminating nature. Thus, the money is also admissible.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   Both the ski mask and the money were lawfully seized, making them admissible as evidence. The defendant's motion to exclude them will be denied.

**Correct Answer: F**  
Denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.
