Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Chodorow's theory on gender socialization. I remember that Chodorow is a sociologist who wrote about how gender roles develop in children, especially focusing on the differences between boys and girls. 

From what I recall, Chodorow's argument is based on the idea that children form attachments to their primary caregivers, which are usually their mothers. She suggested that because women are typically the ones taking care of infants, both boys and girls initially form close bonds with their mothers. 

Now, here's where it gets a bit tricky. Chodorow's main point, if I'm not mistaken, is about how this attachment affects the psychological development of boys and girls differently. For girls, since their primary caregiver is the same gender, they can more easily identify with their mother's role and develop a sense of self that's connected to nurturing and relationships. 

But for boys, the situation is different because their primary caregiver is of the opposite gender. Chodorow argues that boys have to separate from this early attachment to develop their male identity. This separation is necessary for them to form a sense of self that's more independent and less focused on emotional connection, which aligns with traditional masculine roles. 

So looking at the options, the question is about how gender socialization occurs through which process. The key here is that both boys and girls are closely attached to their mothers initially, but then boys have to break away. 

Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A: Both attached to parents, girls break away. Hmm, I don't think that's right because the focus is on the mother, not parents in general. Plus, I think it's the boys who break away.

Option B: Both attached to fathers, boys break away. No, the primary caregiver is the mother, so this doesn't fit.

Option C: Both attached to fathers, girls break away. Also not right for the same reason as B.

Option D: Girls attached to mothers, then break away. No, because Chodorow says girls don't need to break away as much as boys do.

Option E: Both attached to mothers, boys break away. Yes, this aligns with what I was thinking. Both start with the mother, then boys separate.

Option F: Boys attached to mothers, girls break away. No, that's the opposite.

Option G: Boys attached to mothers then break away. That's partially correct, but the question is about both genders initially attached.

Option H: Attached to siblings. Doesn't fit; the theory is about parents, not siblings.

Options I and J: Attach to same or opposite gender parents. Not the process described.

So the correct answer should be E: both boys and girls being closely attached to their mothers, but then boys breaking away.
