Question:

What properties of water make it an essential component of living matter?

Options:

A: Water serves as a poor solvent
B: Water has a high compressibility that allows it to act as a cushion for cellular structures.
C: Water is a strong acid, contributing to the chemical reactions in the cell.
D: Water is scarce in cells
E: Water is a poor conductor of electricity, which is essential for nerve impulse transmission.
F: Water is the most abundant molecule in the cell, an excellent solvent, has a high heat capacity, serves in heat regulation, as a lubricant, and in the transport of nutrients.
G: Water has a low surface tension, which does not support capillary action.
H: Water is immiscible with many organic compounds, preventing reactions within cells.
I: Water has a low boiling point, which helps to maintain cellular temperature under extreme heat conditions.
J: Water has a low heat capacity

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about water's properties and why it's essential for living things. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is asking which properties make water essential. I remember that water has several key characteristics that are vital for life. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Water serves as a poor solvent. Wait, no, I think water is actually a really good solvent. It's called the universal solvent because it can dissolve so many substances. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: High compressibility as a cushion. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. I know water is almost incompressible, which is why it's used in hydraulic systems. High compressibility would mean it gets compressed easily, which doesn't sound right. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Water is a strong acid. No, water is a weak acid. It can dissociate into H+ and OH- ions, but it's not a strong acid like HCl. So C is wrong.

Option D: Water is scarce in cells. No way, I remember that water is the most abundant molecule in cells. So D is definitely incorrect.

Option E: Poor conductor of electricity for nerve impulses. Wait, water itself isn't a great conductor, but when ions are dissolved, the solution conducts electricity. Nerve impulses involve ion movements, so maybe this isn't the key point. Not sure yet, but E might not be the main reason water is essential.

Option F: This option lists several properties. It says water is the most abundant molecule, excellent solvent, high heat capacity, involved in heat regulation, acts as a lubricant, and transports nutrients. All of these sound familiar. High heat capacity helps regulate temperature, which is crucial. Being a solvent helps in chemical reactions and transporting substances. Lubricant properties might help in joints and cellular movements. So F seems like a strong candidate.

Option G: Low surface tension. Wait, water has high surface tension. That's why it can form droplets and support capillary action, like in plants. So G is incorrect because it states the opposite.

Option H: Immiscible with organics. No, water mixes with many organic compounds, but others not so much. However, water's miscibility is part of why it's a good solvent. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Low boiling point. Water's boiling point is 100Â°C, which is actually high. This allows it to remain liquid in many environments. So I is wrong because it says low boiling point.

Option J: Low heat capacity. No, water has high heat capacity, which means it resists temperature changes. This is important for climate regulation. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer must be option F. It lists all the key properties that make water essential: abundance, solvent ability, heat capacity, regulation, lubrication, and transport.

The correct answer is F because it accurately lists the key properties of water that make it essential for living matter: water is the most abundant molecule in cells, an excellent solvent, has a high heat capacity (which aids in heat regulation), acts as a lubricant, and plays a role in transporting nutrients. These properties are crucial for various biological processes and maintaining life.

Answer: F
