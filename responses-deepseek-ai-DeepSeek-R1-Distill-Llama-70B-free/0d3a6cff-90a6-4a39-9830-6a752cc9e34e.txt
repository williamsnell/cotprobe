Okay, so I have this question about real property law, specifically dealing with covenants in a deed and who is liable when something goes wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a farmer conveyed 100 acres to a landscaper. The deed from the farmer had three covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. Then, the landscaper sells the property to a buyer using a warranty deed. But later, the buyer gets evicted by a woman because she has a paramount title. Now, the buyer is suing the farmer for breach of covenants.

So, the question is about whether the buyer can successfully sue the farmer, and if so, which covenants were breached.

First, I remember that when a deed is given, certain covenants are included. These can be present covenants and future covenants. Present covenants are guarantees that are in effect at the time of the conveyance, like seisin (meaning the grantor has the right to convey the property), right to convey (which I think is similar to seisin), and against encumbrances (that there are no liens or encumbrances on the property).

Future covenants are about what might happen later, like warranty, which involves defending the title against others' claims. So, future covenants are ongoing, and the grantor is responsible for any claims that arise later.

Now, when the farmer sold to the landscaper, he provided covenants (1) seisin, (2) right to convey, and (3) against encumbrances. These are present covenants because they are about the state of the title at the time of the conveyance.

Then the landscaper sells to the buyer with a warranty deed. I think the warranty deed includes present covenants (like seisin, against encumbrances) and future covenants (like warranty). But the issue here is between the buyer and the farmer, not the landscaper.

The buyer was evicted because of a paramount title. So, someone else (the woman) had a better title than the buyer. That means the title the farmer conveyed was defective. So, the problem is that the farmer's title wasn't good, which is a breach of a present covenant.

Now, when the buyer is suing the farmer, we need to see which covenants are breached. The present covenants, if breached, would allow the buyer to sue the farmer, but wait—do the covenants run with the land?

I remember that present covenants (seisin, right to convey, against encumbrances) are considered real covenants, meaning they run with the land and can be enforced by subsequent purchasers. Future covenants (like warranty) are personal and don't run with the land, so only the immediate grantee can sue on them.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing that up. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Present covenants are breaches that occur at the time of the conveyance, and future covenants are about later events. Present covenants can be enforced by the grantee and subsequent grantees because they are considered to run with the land. Future covenants are considered to be personal and don't run, so only the immediate grantee can sue on them.

So in this case, the covenants against encumbrances, seisin, and right to convey are present covenants. If the farmer breached these, the buyer, as a subsequent purchaser, can sue the farmer because these covenants run with the land.

Wait, but another point: the farmer sold to the landscaper, then the landscaper sold to the buyer. The buyer is not in privity with the farmer, except through the chain of title. But since the covenants run with the land, privity of estate exists, so the buyer can sue the farmer.

So, the eviction happened because the farmer didn't have good title, which is a breach of the covenant of seisin and right to convey. The covenant against encumbrances would be if there was a lien or mortgage, but here it's a paramount title, so it's more about the farmer not having the right to convey in the first place.

So, the farmer's covenants of seisin (that he had the right to convey) and right to convey were breached. The covenant against encumbrances is about liens, which isn't the issue here.

So, the buyer can sue the farmer for breach of the covenants of seisin and right to convey. Those are present covenants that run with the land, so the buyer can recover.

Looking at the options:

Option A: the buyer, but only for the covenants of seisin and right to convey. That seems correct.

Option B: the buyer, because those two covenants were breached. So that also seems correct. Wait, option B says because the covenants of seisin and right to convey were breached. So that's the same as option A, but the reasoning in A is limiting to only those covenants, which is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The covenants against encumbrances weren't breached here. The problem was the title, not any liens. So the breach is of seisin and right to convey, not against encumbrances.

So option B says the buyer wins because those two covenants were breached. Option A says the buyer wins, but only for those two. So both options A and B have the same outcome, but perhaps the reasoning is different.

Wait, looking again:

Option A: the buyer, but only for the covenants of seisin and right to convey.

Option B: the buyer, because the covenants of seisin and right to convey were breached by the farmer.

So both A and B are about those two covenants. So why are they different?

Ah, perhaps the question is about which covenants were breached. The eviction is due to paramount title, which is a problem with the farmer's seisin. So the farmer didn't have the right to convey a good title, breaching the covenant of seisin and perhaps right to convey.

Wait, but the covenant against encumbrances is about liens, mortgages, etc., not about the title itself. So that's not breached here.

So the farmer is liable for breaching the covenants of seisin and right to convey, which are present covenants, and thus the buyer can recover.

So looking at the options:

Option B says the buyer wins because those two covenants were breached.

Option A says the buyer wins but only for those two.

Wait, perhaps the two covenants are the same? Maybe the covenant of seisin and right to convey are overlapping. Or perhaps they're separate.

Wait, I think the covenant of seisin is the same as the covenant of right to convey. Or are they different?

Wait, in real property, the covenants are:

1. Seisin: That the grantor has the right to convey the property.

2. Right to Convey: Similar to seisin, perhaps, or maybe that the grantor has the authority to sell.

3. Against Encumbrances: No liens or encumbrances.

4. Warranty: Future covenant, grantor will defend title.

5. Quiet Enjoyment: Present covenant, that the grantee will possess the property without disturbance.

Wait, so perhaps the covenant of seisin is the same as the covenant that the grantor has the right to convey. But some sources say that the covenant of seisin and the covenant of right to convey are separate. Or maybe they're the same thing.

Wait, perhaps the covenant of seisin refers to whether the grantor actually owned the property (seisin), while the right to convey is about having the legal right to transfer it. But in many cases, they might be treated similarly.

In any case, the issue here is that the farmer didn't have good title, so both the covenants of seisin and right to convey would be breached.

So the buyer can sue the farmer for breach of those two covenants. So in the options, the correct one is either A or B.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the buyer wins because those two covenants were breached.

Option A says the buyer wins but only for those two.

Wait, perhaps both are correct in terms of the outcome, but the reasoning in the options may differ. But since the only two covenants that were breached are those two, and the buyer is entitled to recover for both, then both options A and B would indicate the buyer wins, but the difference is in the reasoning.

Wait, let me look again. The question is about whether the buyer can successfully sue the farmer. Since the two covenants are present and run with the land, the buyer can sue. So the judgment is for the buyer.

Now, looking at the options, option B says the buyer wins because those two were breached. Option A says the buyer wins but only for those two. So both are correct, but perhaps the answer is option B because it states the reason.

Wait, but perhaps the correct reasoning is that both covenants were breached, so the buyer can recover for both. So the judgment is for the buyer because the farmer breached those two covenants.

So option B would be correct.

Wait, but let me think about the other options.

Option C: the farmer, because the buyer should have done a title search. But the covenants are meant to assure the buyer of the title, so the buyer relies on them instead of doing a title search. So C is not correct.

Option D: the buyer because against encumbrances was breached. No, because the issue is title, not encumbrances.

Option E: farmer because buyer didn't buy directly. No, because the covenants run with the land, so privity of estate exists.

Option F: farmer because no privity of estate. But privity of estate exists through the chain of title, so F is wrong.

Option G: farmer because eviction due to another issue. But the eviction was due to paramount title, which is a breach of the farmer's covenants.

Option H: farmer because covenants are personal. No, present covenants run with the land.

Option I: buyer because warranty deed guarantees clear title. Wait, the warranty deed was from the landscaper to the buyer. The farmer's deed had the three covenants. So the buyer's warranty is from the landscaper, but the farmer's covenants are the ones in question here. So I is incorrect.

So the correct answer is either A or B. Now, the question is, does the buyer recover for both covenants or only those two? Since both covenants were breached, the buyer can recover for both. So between A and B, which is correct?

Option A says the buyer wins, but only for those two covenants. Option B says the buyer wins because those two were breached.

So in the case, the farmer's breach was of those two covenants, so the buyer can recover. So the judgment is for the buyer because the covenants of seisin and right to convey were breached.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the covenant against encumbrances is also a present covenant. If the title was bad, does that mean there's an encumbrance? No, because an encumbrance is a lien or mortgage, not a defect in title. So the against encumbrances covenant wasn't breached.

So the only breached covenants are seisin and right to convey.

So the buyer can recover for those, which is what option B says.

So I think the correct answer is option B.

The question revolves around real property law, specifically the covenants in a deed and liability when a buyer is evicted due to a paramount title. The farmer conveyed 100 acres to a landscaper with a deed containing three covenants: (1) seisin, (2) right to convey, and (3) against encumbrances. The landscaper then sold the property to the buyer via a warranty deed. The buyer was later evicted by a woman with a paramount title and sued the farmer for breach of covenants.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Covenants in the Deed**: 
   - **Seisin**: Guarantees the grantor has the right to convey the property.
   - **Right to Convey**: Similar to seisin, ensuring the grantor has the legal authority to transfer the property.
   - **Against Encumbrances**: Assures there are no liens or encumbrances on the property.

2. **Present vs. Future Covenants**:
   - Present covenants (seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances) are guarantees about the state of the title at the time of conveyance and run with the land, meaning subsequent purchasers can enforce them.
   - Future covenants (e.g., warranty) are personal and do not run with the land.

3. **Breach of Covenants**:
   - The buyer was evicted due to a paramount title, indicating the farmer did not have good title to convey. This constitutes a breach of the covenants of seisin and right to convey.
   - The covenant against encumbrances was not breached, as the issue was a defect in title, not a lien or encumbrance.

4. **Privity and Liability**:
   - Although the buyer did not purchase directly from the farmer, present covenants run with the land, creating privity of estate. Thus, the buyer can sue the farmer for breach of the covenants of seisin and right to convey.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Correct in stating the buyer wins but only for the covenants of seisin and right to convey. However, it unnecessarily limits the scope of the buyer’s recovery.
- **Option B**: Correctly identifies that the buyer wins because the covenants of seisin and right to convey were breached. This aligns with the analysis that these covenants were violated due to the defective title.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as the buyer relies on the covenants in the deed and is not required to conduct a title search.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the covenant against encumbrances was not breached.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as the covenants run with the land, allowing the buyer to sue the farmer despite not purchasing directly.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as privity of estate exists through the chain of title.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as the eviction was due to a breach of the covenants of seisin and right to convey.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as present covenants run with the land.
- **Option I**: Incorrect, as the warranty deed from the landscaper to the buyer is irrelevant to the farmer’s liability.

### Conclusion:
The buyer is entitled to recover from the farmer for the breach of the covenants of seisin and right to convey. The correct answer is:

**B: the buyer, because the covenants of seisin and right to convey were breached by the farmer.**
