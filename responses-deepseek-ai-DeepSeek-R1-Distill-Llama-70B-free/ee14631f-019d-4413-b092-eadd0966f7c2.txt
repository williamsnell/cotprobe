Okay, so I have this linear algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: Let V be the real vector space of all real 2x3 matrices, and W be the real vector space of all real 4x1 column vectors. T is a linear transformation from V onto W. I need to find the dimension of the kernel of T, which is also called the nullspace.

Hmm, I remember that for a linear transformation T: V â†’ W, the dimension of the kernel (nullspace) plus the dimension of the image equals the dimension of the domain V. This is from the Rank-Nullity Theorem. So the formula should be:

dim(ker T) + dim(im T) = dim V.

Since T is onto W, that means the image of T is all of W. So dim(im T) is the same as dim W.

First, I need to find the dimensions of V and W.

V is the space of 2x3 real matrices. Each matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns, so that's 6 elements in total. So dim V is 6.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. For an m x n matrix, the dimension as a vector space is m*n. So yeah, 2*3=6. So dim V=6.

W is the space of 4x1 column vectors. Each column vector has 4 entries, so dim W is 4.

So applying the Rank-Nullity Theorem:

dim(ker T) = dim V - dim(im T) = dim V - dim W.

Because T is onto, im T = W, so dim(im T)=4.

So dim(ker T) = 6 -4 =2. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, 6-4 is 2? No, wait, 6-4 is 2, yes. But wait, no, wait, I think I might have gotten this wrong.

Wait, wait no, 6-4 is 2, but that would make the answer 2. Let me see the options. The options are A to J, with E as 2. So the answer would be E:2. But wait, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait no, I think I made a mistake in the dimensions. Because wait, V is the space of 2x3 matrices, which is 6-dimensional, yes. W is 4-dimensional. So according to the Rank-Nullity Theorem, dim ker T is 6 - 4 = 2. So the kernel is 2-dimensional. So the answer should be E:2.

But wait, wait another thought. Wait, the question says T is a linear transformation from V onto W. So yes, that makes the image W. So dim(im T)=4. So 6-4=2. So the kernel's dimension is 2. So the answer is E.

Wait, but looking back at the options, E is 2. So that's correct. So the answer is E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the spaces. Sometimes I confuse whether it's V to W or W to V. But no, T is from V to W, so the domain is V (dim 6), and codomain is W (dim 4). So the calculation is correct.

To determine the dimension of the kernel of the linear transformation \( T: V \to W \), we use the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which states:

\[
\dim(\ker T) + \dim(\text{im } T) = \dim V.
\]

Here:
- \( V \) is the vector space of all real \( 2 \times 3 \) matrices. The dimension of \( V \) is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
- \( W \) is the vector space of all real \( 4 \times 1 \) column vectors. The dimension of \( W \) is \( 4 \).
- Since \( T \) is a linear transformation from \( V \) onto \( W \), the image of \( T \) is all of \( W \), so \( \dim(\text{im } T) = \dim W = 4 \).

Substituting into the Rank-Nullity Theorem:

\[
\dim(\ker T) = \dim V - \dim(\text{im } T) = 6 - 4 = 2.
\]

Thus, the dimension of the kernel of \( T \) is 2.
