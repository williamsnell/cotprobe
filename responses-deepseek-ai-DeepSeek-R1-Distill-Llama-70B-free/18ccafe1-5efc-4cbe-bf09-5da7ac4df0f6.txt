Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question. The question is about Amy's therapist responding in a certain way, and I need to determine which treatment she's experiencing. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that Amy's therapist is shaking her head affirmatively and saying, "Yes, uh huh," as Amy talks about her problems. So, I'm thinking about what this behavior signifies. Shaking the head affirmatively usually means the therapist is showing agreement, acknowledgment, or support. The verbal cues like "uh huh" suggest active listening.

Now, I need to match this behavior to a type of psychotherapy. Let me go through each option and see which one fits best.

Option A: Behavior Therapy. This focuses on changing maladaptive behaviors through techniques like conditioning. I'm not sure if active listening is a hallmark here. It's more about behavior techniques.

Option B: Exposure Therapy. This is a type of behavior therapy where the patient is exposed to the feared object or situation. Again, it's more about behavior than verbal interaction.

Option C: Cognitive Therapy. This focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns. Therapists might help patients challenge their thoughts, but does that involve a lot of head nodding and verbal affirmations?

Option D: Psychoanalysis. This is the Freudian approach, focusing on unconscious thoughts and past experiences. Therapists might be more reserved, encouraging free association. I don't think they'd be nodding and making verbal affirmations as much.

Option E: Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT). This is similar to cognitive therapy, focusing on irrational beliefs. The therapist might challenge the patient's thoughts actively, but again, not sure about the head nodding.

Option F: Gestalt Therapy. This approach emphasizes the present moment and personal responsibility. Techniques might include role-playing or empty chair exercises. Active listening is part of it, but I'm not certain if the specific affirmative responses are a key indicator here.

Option G: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT combines cognitive and behavioral techniques. It's more about identifying and changing thoughts and behaviors. While CBT therapists do listen, I'm not sure if the specific behaviors described are unique to CBT.

Option H: Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). This is a form of CBT that focuses on emotional regulation and coping skills. It might involve validation techniques, which include active listening and affirmations. So this could be a possibility.

Option I: Humanistic Therapy. This approach emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and empathy. Therapists like Carl Rogers use active listening, reflection, and unconditional positive regard. Nodding and verbal affirmations fit here as they show empathy and support.

Option J: Interpersonal Therapy (IPT). This focuses on improving communication skills and addressing interpersonal issues. It's more about the patient's relationships, but I'm not sure if the affirmative responses are a key part of IPT.

So, the therapist's behavior here—nodding and verbal affirmations—is about showing support and active listening. That makes me think of humanistic therapy, which emphasizes empathy and genuineness. Carl Rogers, a key figure in humanistic psychology, stressed the importance of the therapeutic relationship, including active listening.

Wait, but could it also be something like cognitive behavioral therapy? I'm a bit confused because CBT does involve a supportive relationship, but I think the key difference is the focus. Humanistic therapy is more about providing a supportive, non-judgmental environment, which aligns with the behaviors described.

Alternatively, DBT (Option H) uses validation, which includes acknowledging the patient's feelings. But DBT is more specific about teaching skills and managing emotions, whereas the question doesn't mention any specific techniques beyond the therapist's affirmations.

So between I and H. But since the question is about the therapist's affirmative head shaking and verbal cues while the patient talks about problems, it's more about the therapeutic alliance and active listening, which is a hallmark of humanistic therapy.

I think the answer is I: humanistic therapy.

The therapist's behavior of shaking her head affirmatively and saying, "Yes, uh huh," indicates active listening and support. This aligns with humanistic therapy, which emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and a supportive therapeutic relationship. Active listening is a key component of humanistic approaches, as seen in the work of Carl Rogers. While other therapies like DBT involve validation, the specific focus here on supportive verbal cues and active listening points most directly to humanistic therapy.
