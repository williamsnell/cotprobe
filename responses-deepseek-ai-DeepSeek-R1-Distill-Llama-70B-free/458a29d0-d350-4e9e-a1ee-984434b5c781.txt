Question:

Co-defendants were dealers at a casino. They had been employed by the casino for four years. One day, they were unexpectedly fired by the casino's new manager. Apparently, the casino hired the new manager to get rid of some of the old-time employees and replace them with new personnel at a lower wage. Angered by their firing, the codefendants vowed to get back at the casino. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the casino and demand $1,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the casino should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, one of the co-defendants, who was an electronics expert, built the bomb himself. He alone then drove to the casino where he placed the bomb in a hallway closet. Shortly thereafter, the other co-defendant phoned the casino and made a demand for the money. He said a bomb was in the casino and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The casino treated their demand as a crank call and refused to make any payment. With their plans having gone awry, the codefendants agreed that one of them should return to the casino and defuse the bomb. As one of the co-defendants was driving back to the casino, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. A subsequent investigation revealed that a faulty wire caused the bomb to detonate prematurely. A state statute provides that detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony. If the co-defendants are charged with violating the aforementioned statute, which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: Both are guilty, because each participated in the planning of the crime.
B: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he physically placed the bomb in the casino.
C: Neither is guilty, because they did not intend for anyone to be killed, but the bomb exploded prematurely.
D: The co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty, because he built and transported the bomb, but the other co-defendant is not guilty, because his phone call was not a substantial step in the furtherance of the crime.
E: Both are guilty, but only the one who made the phone call is guilty of a felony.
F: Both are not guilty, because they intended to defuse the bomb before it exploded.
G: Both are guilty, but only the one who built the bomb is guilty of a felony.
H: Neither is guilty, because the faulty wire, an unforeseeable circumstance, caused the bomb to explode.
I: Neither is guilty, because the casino's gross negligence in failing to heed the telephone warning constituted an independent intervening cause of the explosion.
J: The co-defendant who made the phone call is guilty, because he made the demand for the money.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with co-defendants and their liability under a state statute related to detonating bombs. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The scenario involves two co-defendants who were dealers at a casino. They got fired, decided to plant a bomb as revenge, and then things went wrong. The bomb exploded prematurely, killing 30 people. The state statute makes it a felony to detonate or attempt to detonate a bomb in or near a building or dwelling.

So, the question is about whether each co-defendant is guilty under this statute. The options are A through J, each presenting a different scenario.

Let me think about the elements of the crime here. The statute criminalizes detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb. So, the actus reus would be the detonation or attempted detonation, and the mens rea would likely be the intent to cause the detonation. But wait, sometimes statutes can be strict liability, but I think in this context, it's probably intentional or knowing.

Looking at the facts: The co-defendants built the bomb, placed it, and then tried to extort money by threatening to detonate it. But the bomb went off early because of a faulty wire, killing people. They had intended to give a warning and defuse it, but their plan failed.

So, the key points are: who actually did the act of detonation? Because the bomb was planted, but it exploded prematurely. So, who is responsible for the detonation?

Wait, the co-defendant who built the bomb placed it in the casino. So, he took a substantial step towards detonating it by placing it there. The other co-defendant called in the threat, which might be an attempt to detonate, but did that constitute an attempt?

Under the law of attempts, a person can be guilty if they take a substantial step towards the commission of the crime with the intent to complete it. So, building and placing the bomb would be a substantial step. Similarly, making the phone call threatening to detonate it might also be a substantial step, depending on the jurisdiction's view.

But wait, the actual detonation was accidental, due to a faulty wire. So, did either of them actually cause the detonation? The person who built the bomb placed it, but the detonation was premature. So, perhaps the act of placing the bomb was an attempt to detonate it, intending that it would explode later. But if the explosion happened without their direct action, does that count as detonating under the statute?

Alternatively, the statute might criminalize both the act of detonation and the attempt. So, if they attempted to detonate it, they could be guilty of the attempt. But the explosion actually happened, so would that be considered a completed offense?

Wait, the wording of the statute is: "detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling is a felony." So, both actions are criminal. So, if someone attempts to detonate, they're guilty, and if they successfully detonate, they're guilty.

In this case, the bomb was placed with the intent to explode it later, so that's an attempt. But then it did explode, though earlier than intended. So, does that count as a completed detonation?

Wait, but the explosion was due to a faulty wire, not any action they took. So, perhaps the detonation was accidental from their perspective. But legally, if they set the bomb to go off, even if it goes off earlier, they might still be responsible for the detonation.

Alternatively, if they had taken steps to defuse it, maybe that affects their intent. But in this case, after the casino didn't pay, one of them was on the way to defuse it when the bomb exploded. So, their intent was to have it explode after they gave the warning, but it blew up before they could defuse it.

But legally, when they placed the bomb, they had the intent for it to detonate. The fact that it detonated earlier might not matter because their initial act was to set it to explode. So, perhaps the act of placing the bomb with the intent to have it explode later constitutes detonating under the statute.

Alternatively, some might argue that detonation requires an intentional act to cause the explosion, but I don't think that's the case. The placement with a timing device might suffice as an attempt, and the actual explosion fulfills the completed offense.

So, considering that both co-defendants were involved in the planning, and one built and placed the bomb, while the other made the threatening call. The question is whether both are guilty under the statute.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both are guilty because each participated in the planning. Planning alone might not be sufficient; they need to have taken a substantial step.

Option B: Only the bomb builder is guilty because he placed it. But the other might have also taken a step by making the threat, which could be an attempt.

Option C: Neither guilty because they didn't intend to kill. But the statute is about detonating, not about the intent to kill. So, even if they didn't intend to kill, if they intended to detonate, that's enough.

Option D: Builder guilty, caller not because the call wasn't a substantial step. But making a threat could be a substantial step in furtherance.

Option E: Both guilty, but only the caller guilty of felony. Doesn't make sense if both are guilty of the same offense.

Option F: Both not guilty because they intended to defuse. But they still placed the bomb with intent to detonate.

Option G: Both guilty, but only the builder guilty of felony. Not sure about this split.

Option H: Neither guilty because of the faulty wire. But the faulty wire is just the cause; their act of placing the bomb is still the proximate cause.

Option I: Casino's negligence is an intervening cause. But in criminal law, an intervening cause doesn't usually relieve liability unless it's unforeseeable and breaks the chain. Here, the bomb going off might still be considered a foreseeable result.

Option J: Only the caller guilty because he made the demand. But the builder actually placed the bomb.

So, thinking again, the key is that both co-defendants took substantial steps. The one who built and placed the bomb clearly did so. The other made the threat, which could be seen as an attempt to extort money by threatening detonation. But does making the threat constitute an attempt under the statute?

Wait, the statute is about detonating or attempting to detonate. So, the act of making the threat might not be an attempt to detonate, unless the threat was part of an attempt. Alternatively, the threat could be part of the plan to extort, but the actual attempt to detonate was placing the bomb.

Hmm, perhaps the co-defendant who made the phone call didn't take a substantial step towards detonating the bomb. His action was more about the extortion rather than the detonation. So, maybe he's guilty of attempted extortion, but not under this specific bomb statute.

Wait, but the question is about the bomb statute, not about other crimes. So, the phone call might not directly relate to attempting to detonate the bomb. Instead, the act of placing the bomb is the attempt to detonate. So, the builder is guilty, but the caller might not be.

Alternatively, if the caller's action was part of the plan to detonate, maybe he's also guilty. But I'm not sure. The caller's action was more about the threat to get money, not directly causing the detonation.

Wait, but the statute includes attempting to detonate, which could involve making a threat if that threat is intended to cause the detonation. But in this case, the threat was to get money, not to cause the detonation. The detonation was supposed to happen regardless unless the money was paid.

Hmm, perhaps the threat was a communication that the bomb would explode unless the money was paid, which could be seen as part of the attempt to detonate. Alternatively, it's more of a means to an end (extortion), not the attempt itself.

So, perhaps only the co-defendant who built and placed the bomb is guilty under the statute, as he's the one who took the substantial step towards detonation. The other co-defendant's phone call might not meet the actus reus for the bomb statute.

Looking back at the options, option D says the builder is guilty because he built and transported, but the caller isn't because the call wasn't a substantial step. That might make sense.

But wait, the builder placed the bomb, which is a substantial step towards detonation. The caller's threat might not be a physical step towards detonation. So, perhaps the caller isn't guilty under the bomb statute but maybe under another statute for making a false threat or extortion.

But the question is about the specific bomb statute. So, in that case, only the builder would be guilty.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the bomb did detonate, so does that mean they both are guilty of the completed offense? Or is it that the act of placing the bomb was an attempt, and the explosion makes it a completed crime.

The statute criminalizes both attempting and completing. So, if they attempted, they're guilty, and if it completed, they're guilty as well. But in this case, the bomb was placed with the intent to explode, so that's an attempt. Then it actually exploded, so that's the completed offense.

But who is responsible for the completed offense? The builder placed it, so he's guilty of attempt. When it exploded, that's the completed offense. So, he would be guilty of that as well.

But what about the other co-defendant? Did he take any action that would make him guilty of attempt or the completed offense? His action was making the phone call. If that's not a substantial step towards detonation, then he might not be guilty under this statute.

So, perhaps only the builder is guilty. Looking at the options again, option B says only the builder is guilty because he placed it. Option D says the builder is guilty, the other isn't because the call wasn't a substantial step.

But wait, the question says both co-defendants are charged with violating the statute. So, it's about whether each of them is guilty.

I think the correct answer is that both are guilty. Because they both participated in the plan, and each took actions that were substantial steps. The builder built and placed the bomb, the caller made the threat which could be seen as an attempt to extort but also as part of the attempt to detonate.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The caller's action might not be a substantial step towards detonation, more towards the extortion. So, maybe only the builder is guilty. But then, the completed offense of detonation might require that the explosion was a result of their actions.

Wait, the bomb exploded because of a faulty wire, but it was their bomb. So, the act of placing it caused the detonation, even if it was earlier than intended. So, they're responsible for the detonation.

But does that mean both are guilty? Because they were both in on the plan. So, under conspiracy or aiding and abetting, perhaps both are guilty.

Wait, but the question is about the specific statute, not about conspiracy. So, each of their actions must individually meet the elements of the offense.

The builder's action of placing the bomb is clearly a substantial step towards detonation. The caller's threat might not be, unless the threat was intended to cause the detonation, which it wasn't. The threat was to extort money, with the detonation being the consequence if the money wasn't paid.

So, perhaps the caller's action isn't a substantial step towards detonation but towards extortion. Therefore, under the bomb statute, only the builder is guilty.

But wait, another angle: the caller's threat could be seen as an attempt to cause the detonation by setting in motion the plan. So, if they had intended to detonate if the money wasn't paid, the threat is part of the attempt.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. But I think the correct approach is that both are guilty because they each took substantial steps in the plan. The builder built and placed the bomb, which is a clear attempt. The caller's threat, as part of the plan to detonate, might also be a substantial step.

Wait, but the threat is more about the extortion. So, perhaps the caller isn't guilty under this specific statute but under another, like making a terrorist threat. But the question is about the bomb statute.

So, perhaps the answer is that both are guilty because they both participated in the planning and execution. But I'm not entirely sure.

Looking at the options again, option A says both are guilty because they participated in planning. But planning alone isn't enough; they need to take a substantial step.

Option B: Only the builder is guilty because he placed the bomb.

Option D: Builder guilty, caller not.

I think the correct answer is B or D. But I'm leaning towards B because the builder placed the bomb, which is the substantial step. The caller's action doesn't directly relate to detonating the bomb, so he's not guilty under this statute.

Wait, no, the caller's action is part of the attempt to detonate. Because without the threat, the bomb wouldn't have been set to go off. Wait, no, the bomb was set to go off regardless of the threat. The threat was to get the money to prevent it from exploding.

So, the detonation was going to happen unless the money was paid, which it wasn't. So, the threat is part of the plan to allow the detonation. Therefore, the caller's action is a substantial step towards the detonation because it's part of the plan to let the bomb explode if the money isn't paid.

So, both of them took substantial steps: the builder built and placed it, the caller made the threat to further the plan. Therefore, both are guilty under the statute.

Looking back at the options, option A says both are guilty because each participated in the planning. But planning isn't enough; they need to take a substantial step. However, in this case, they did take substantial steps beyond planning.

So, perhaps the correct answer is A because both participated in the planning and took actions. But I'm not sure if planning is sufficient without the substantial step.

Wait, but I think both took substantial steps. The builder built and placed the bomb, which is a clear substantial step. The caller made the threat, which could be seen as a substantial step in furtherance of the detonation plan. So, option A might be correct.

Alternatively, the caller's action might not be a substantial step towards detonation, making option B correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another approach is to think about the elements of the crime. The statute requires either detonating or attempting to detonate. So, to be guilty, each co-defendant must have individually attempted to detonate or actually detonated.

The builder placed the bomb, which is an attempt. The caller's threat, if it was intended to cause detonation, could be an attempt. But the caller's intent was to get money, not to detonate. So, perhaps the caller didn't have the intent to detonate, only the builder did.

Wait, but they both agreed to the plan. So, the caller's threat was part of the plan to detonate the bomb if the money wasn't paid. So, the caller's action was in furtherance of the detonation plan. Therefore, he also took a substantial step towards detonation.

So, both are guilty under the statute. So, the answer would be A.

But wait, another thought: the caller's action was a communication, which might not be considered a substantial step unless it's part of the actual attempt. For example, in some cases, making a threat without more isn't enough for an attempt. But here, the threat was part of a plan that included placing the bomb, so maybe it's sufficient.

Alternatively, the caller's threat could be seen as an attempt to cause the detonation by giving an ultimatum. So, perhaps it's a substantial step.

So, considering all that, I think the correct answer is A: Both are guilty because each participated in the planning. Wait, no, planning is not enough. They must have taken substantial steps. So, perhaps the better answer is that both are guilty because they each took substantial steps, which would make option A incorrect because it cites planning, not the steps.

Wait, looking at the options again, option A says both are guilty because each participated in the planning. That's not accurate because planning isn't sufficient; they need to take a substantial step.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty because he physically placed it. Because the other's action wasn't a substantial step.

Alternatively, option D says the builder is guilty, the caller isn't because the call wasn't a substantial step.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the statute. The statute criminalizes detonating or attempting to detonate. The builder placed the bomb, which is an attempt. The caller made the threat, which might not be an attempt to detonate but an attempt to extort. So, the caller isn't guilty under this specific statute.

Therefore, the answer is B: Only the co-defendant who built the bomb is guilty because he placed it.

Wait, but the bomb did explode, so the builder is guilty of detonation, and the caller isn't guilty of anything under this statute. So, the answer would be B.

Alternatively, if both are guilty because they both took substantial steps, then A would be correct. But I think the threat isn't enough for the caller to be guilty under this statute.

So, I think the answer is B.

The question revolves around the liability of two co-defendants under a state statute that criminalizes detonating or attempting to detonate a bomb or explosive device in or near a building or dwelling. The co-defendants planted a bomb in a casino as part of a revenge plan, but the bomb exploded prematurely due to a faulty wire, killing 30 people. The key issue is whether both co-defendants are guilty under the statute, and if so, on what basis.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Statutory Elements**: The statute criminalizes both the act of detonation and the attempt to detonate. For liability, each co-defendant must have individually satisfied the elements of the crime, either by completing the act of detonation or taking a substantial step toward detonation.

2. **Actions of the Co-Defendants**:
   - The co-defendant who built and placed the bomb took a clear substantial step toward detonation by physically placing the bomb in the casino. This action satisfies the attempt provision of the statute.
   - The co-defendant who made the threatening phone call was part of the plan but did not directly take a substantial step toward detonation. The call was primarily an attempt to extort money, not an attempt to detonate the bomb. While the call was part of the overall plan, it does not constitute a substantial step toward detonation under the statute.

3. **Premature Detonation**: The bomb exploded due to a faulty wire, but this does not absolve the co-defendant who placed the bomb of liability. The act of placing
