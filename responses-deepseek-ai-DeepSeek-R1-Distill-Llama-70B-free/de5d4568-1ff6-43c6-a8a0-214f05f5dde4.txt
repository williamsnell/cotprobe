Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about differences between Asian/Asian-American therapy clients and Anglo clients. The question asks what experts frequently point out regarding the former group. The options are from A to H.

First, I need to remember what I know about cultural differences in therapy. I recall that different cultures might have varying preferences and expressions when it comes to mental health issues.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: They tend to prefer a less directive therapeutic approach. Wait, I'm not sure. I think some cultures might prefer more directive approaches where the therapist gives more advice, especially if they come from a more hierarchical culture. But I'm not certain if that's the case here.

Option B: They are grounded more in the here-and-now. I think Western therapies often focus on the present, while some other cultures might focus more on past or future. But I'm not sure which group does which.

Option C: Likely to express emotional problems as verbal symptoms. Hmm, I remember that some cultures express emotional distress through physical symptoms rather than talking about emotions. So maybe this isn't correct.

Option D: Respond better when goal-setting is immediate. I'm not too sure about this. It might relate to how some cultures value quick results, but I'm not certain.

Option E: Grounded more in the past or future than the present. This is the opposite of option B. If B is incorrect, maybe E is correct. But I need to think about which group is which.

Option F: Likely to express emotional problems as somatic symptoms. Yes, this rings a bell. I've heard that in many Asian cultures, mental health issues are often expressed through physical complaints, like headaches or stomachaches, rather than openly discussing emotional feelings. So this might be the correct answer.

Option G: Prefer group therapy over individual. I'm not sure. Western cultures might prefer individual therapy because of the emphasis on personal space and individualism. Asian cultures, which might be more collectivist, could prefer group settings. But I'm not certain if that's a common observation.

Option H: Respond better when goal-setting is delayed. Not sure. Maybe if they prefer a more gradual approach, but I don't have enough info on this.

So, focusing back, the main point I remember is that Asian clients often present somatic symptoms when they're experiencing emotional issues. That would point to option F as the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. I've read that in many Asian cultures, there's a stigma attached to mental health issues, so people might not openly discuss emotional problems. Instead, they might talk about physical symptoms. That aligns with option F.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F.
