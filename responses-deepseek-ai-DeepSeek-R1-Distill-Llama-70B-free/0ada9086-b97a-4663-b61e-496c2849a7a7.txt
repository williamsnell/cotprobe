Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is: Calculate the volume of 0.3 N base necessary to neutralize 3 liters of 0.01 N nitric acid. And then there are several options to choose from, labeled A to J.

Hmm, right. So I'm dealing with a neutralization reaction between an acid and a base. I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve an acid and a base reacting to produce a salt and water. But wait, I should probably think about the specific reaction here.

Nitric acid is HNO3, which is a strong acid. So it should dissociate completely in water. The base isn't specified, but since the problem gives normality values, I might need to use the concept of equivalents to solve this.

Wait, what's normality (N) again? I think normality is related to molarity but takes into account the number of equivalents. For acids, the number of equivalents is based on the number of H+ ions they can donate. Since HNO3 is monoprotic (it donates one H+ per molecule), its normality would be the same as its molarity. Similarly, for a base, if it's hydroxide like NaOH, which accepts one H+ per molecule (monobasic), then its normality equals its molarity as well. But if the base is something like Mg(OH)2, which is dibasic, then the normality would be twice the molarity because each Mg(OH)2 can provide two OH- ions.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the base, so maybe I can assume it's a monobasic hydroxide like NaOH. That would make things simpler. So for both the acid and the base, their normality is equal to their molarity in this case.

So the problem says we have 3 liters of 0.01 N HNO3. I need to find out how much volume of 0.3 N base is required to neutralize it.

I remember that neutralization reactions are about the equivalents of acid and base. The idea is that the equivalents of acid should equal the equivalents of base for complete neutralization.

The formula I think I should use is:

Equivalents of acid = Equivalents of base

Because in neutralization, H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base in a 1:1 ratio.

So, Equivalents (or Normality × Volume in liters) for acid equals that for the base.

Let me write that down:

N_acid × V_acid = N_base × V_base

Where V_acid is the volume of acid, N_acid its normality, V_base the volume of base needed, and N_base its normality.

So plugging in the numbers:

N_acid is 0.01 N, V_acid is 3 liters, N_base is 0.3 N. We're solving for V_base.

So 0.01 N * 3 L = 0.3 N * V_base

Calculate left side: 0.01 * 3 = 0.03 equivalents.

So 0.03 = 0.3 * V_base

To find V_base, divide both sides by 0.3: V_base = 0.03 / 0.3 = 0.1 liters.

Wait, 0.1 liters is 100 ml, which is one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option I is 0.1 liter. So the answer should be I.

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, the acid is 3 L of 0.01 N. So the equivalents are 0.01 *3 = 0.03 equivalents.

The base is 0.3 N, so to get 0.03 equivalents, volume would be 0.03 / 0.3 = 0.1 L. Yeah, that seems correct.

Alternatively, think in terms of molarity. Wait, if the base is monobasic, then normality equals molarity. So for HNO3, which is 0.01 M because it's monoprotic. The base is 0.3 M (assuming it's monobasic like NaOH). The reaction is HNO3 + NaOH → NaNO3 + H2O. So for every mole of HNO3, one mole of NaOH is needed.

So moles of HNO3 = Molarity × Volume = 0.01 M * 3 L = 0.03 moles.

Moles of NaOH needed = 0.03 moles. Since the NaOH solution is 0.3 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.03 / 0.3 = 0.1 L.

Same answer as before. So I think I'm confident that the correct option is I: 0.1 liter.

To calculate the volume of 0.3 N base necessary to neutralize 3 liters of 0.01 N nitric acid, we use the principle that the equivalents of acid must equal the equivalents of base for complete neutralization. The formula is:

\[
N_{\text{acid}} \times V_{\text{acid}} = N_{\text{base}} \times V_{\text{base}}
\]

Here:
- \(N_{\text{acid}} = 0.01 \, \text{N}\),
- \(V_{\text{acid}} = 3 \, \text{liters}\),
- \(N_{\text{base}} = 0.3 \, \text{N}\),
- \(V_{\text{base}}\) is the unknown volume of the base.

Substituting the values:

\[
0.01 \times 3 = 0.3 \times V_{\text{base}}
\]

\[
0.03 = 0.3 \times V_{\text{base}}
\]

Solving for \(V_{\text{base}}\):

\[
V_{\text{base}} = \frac{0.03}{0.3} = 0.1 \, \text{liters}
\]

Thus, the volume of 0.3 N base required is 0.1 liters. This corresponds to option **I**.
