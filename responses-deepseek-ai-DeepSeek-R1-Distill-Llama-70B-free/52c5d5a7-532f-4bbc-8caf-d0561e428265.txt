Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. 

The question says that a store manager orders 81 shirts from the warehouse. These shirts are packed into boxes and sent to the store. Each shipping box can hold 9 shirts. The question is asking how many shipping boxes are needed for all the shirts ordered. And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I think this is a division problem. Because when you have a certain number of items and you want to split them into groups of a specific size, you use division. So here, we have 81 shirts and each box holds 9 shirts. So the number of boxes should be 81 divided by 9.

Let me write that down. 81 รท 9 equals... well, 9 times 9 is 81, right? So 81 divided by 9 would be 9. So that would mean 9 boxes are needed. But wait, I should double-check that because sometimes with division, if there's a remainder, you might need an extra box. But in this case, 9 times 9 is exactly 81, so there's no remainder. So 9 boxes should be enough.

Looking at the options, option A is 9. So that's probably the correct answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The shirts are 81, each box takes 9. So 9 boxes of 9 shirts each would give 81 shirts total. Yep, that makes sense. 

I don't think any of the other options make sense. Let's see, option E is 10. That would be if, say, the shirts didn't divide evenly. Like if it was 82 shirts, then you'd need 10 boxes because 9 boxes would hold 81, and one more shirt would need a tenth box. But since it's exactly 81, 9 is correct.

Wait, just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. Option B is 90, which is way too high. Option C is 45, that's half of 90, still way too big. Option D is 81, which would imply each box holds one shirt, but that's not the case here. Option F is 27, which is 3 times 9, but 27 times 9 would be 243 shirts, which is way more than we have. Option G is 8, which is less than 9, but 8 boxes times 9 shirts is 72, which is less than 81. So that's not enough. Option H is 18, which is double of 9, so that would hold 162 shirts, which is more than needed but not the minimum. Option I is 72, which is 8 times 9, but that's 72 shirts, so way too low. Option J is 12, which would be 108 shirts, which is more than needed but again not the minimum. So yeah, 9 is the right answer.

I think I've thought this through. The calculation is straightforward, and I don't see any complications here. So the answer should be A:9.

To determine how many shipping boxes are needed, divide the total number of shirts (81) by the number of shirts each box can hold (9). 

\[ 81 \div 9 = 9 \]

Since 9 boxes can exactly hold 81 shirts with no remainder, the correct answer is **A: 9**.

The other options are incorrect because they do not match the calculation. For example:
- Option E (10) would be needed if there were a remainder, but since 81 is exactly divisible by 9, it's unnecessary.
- Options like B (90), C (45), and others are far too high or low compared to the correct calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 9**.

Answer: A
