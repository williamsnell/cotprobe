Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the effusion rates of two gases, HBr and CH4. Hmm, I remember that effusion has something to do with how fast gases escape through a tiny opening. Oh right, Graham's Law of Effusion! That's the one. 

So the question says that HBr effuses at 4 ml per second, and I need to find the rate for CH4. I think Graham's Law relates the rates of effusion to their molecular weights. The formula is something like rate1 over rate2 equals the square root of (molecular weight2 over molecular weight1). Or was it the other way around? Let me get that straight.

Wait, the formula is (Rate1)/(Rate2) = sqrt(MW2/MW1). No, wait, no. Because lighter molecules effuse faster. So if a lighter gas has a higher rate, then the ratio of their rates is the square root of the inverse ratio of their molecular weights. So actually, it's Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(MW2/MW1). Or maybe I should write it as Rate = k * sqrt(1/MW), where k is a constant. That makes sense because lower molecular weight means higher rate.

In this problem, HBr has a molecular weight of 81, and CH4 is 16. So HBr is heavier. Since HBr's rate is 4 ml/sec, CH4 should effuse faster. 

So let's set up the equation. Let Rate of HBr be 4, Rate of CH4 be R. 

So according to Graham's Law, 4/R = sqrt( (MW of CH4) / (MW of HBr) )? Wait, no, I think I might have it mixed up. Let me think again. The correct formula is Rate1 / Rate2 = sqrt( MW2 / MW1 ). Because the lighter gas (lower MW) has a higher rate.

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right. Graham's Law says that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight. So Rate ∝ 1/√MW. So the ratio of the rates is Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(MW2/MW1). Because if gas 2 is lighter, then MW2 is smaller, so MW2/MW1 is a fraction, and the square root of that fraction would be less than 1, meaning Rate1 is less than Rate2, which doesn't make sense. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think in terms of example. If Gas A is lighter than Gas B, then Gas A should effuse faster. So if Rate A is higher than Rate B, then Rate A / Rate B = sqrt(MW B / MW A). Because if MW B is bigger than MW A, then sqrt that ratio is bigger than 1, so Rate A is bigger than Rate B. That makes sense. So formula is Rate A / Rate B = sqrt( (MW_B) / (MW_A) )

So in this problem, HBr has MW 81, CH4 has MW 16. So if HBr's rate is 4 ml/s, CH4's rate would be higher. Let me set up the equation.

Let me call HBr as Gas 1 and CH4 as Gas 2. So Rate1 = 4, MW1 =81. Rate2 is what I'm solving for, MW2=16.

So Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(MW2/MW1) → 4 / Rate2 = sqrt(16/81)

Calculating the sqrt(16/81) is sqrt(16)/sqrt(81) = 4/9. So 4/Rate2 = 4/9 → Multiply both sides by Rate2: 4 = (4/9) Rate2 → Divide both sides by 4: 1 = (1/9) Rate2 → Rate2 = 9.

Wait, that would make CH4's rate 9 ml/s. Let me check the options. Option J is 9 ml/s. So the answer would be J.

Wait wait, wait a second. Did I set up the equation correctly? Let me double-check. So Rate of HBr is 4, which is for the heavier gas, so CH4 should have a higher rate. So if the ratio is correct, 4 / R = 4/9 → R=9, which is higher than 4. That makes sense because CH4 is lighter. So the answer is J.

To determine the effusion rate of CH₄ relative to HBr, we use Graham's Law of Effusion, which states:

\[
\frac{\text{Rate}_1}{\text{Rate}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{MW}_2}{\text{MW}_1}}
\]

Here:
- **Rate₁** = 4 ml/sec (rate of HBr),
- **MW₁** = 81 (molecular weight of HBr),
- **MW₂** = 16 (molecular weight of CH₄),
- **Rate₂** = ? (rate of CH₄).

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{4}{\text{Rate}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{16}{81}}
\]

Simplify the square root:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{16}{81}} = \frac{4}{9}
\]

Now solve for **Rate₂**:

\[
\frac{4}{\text{Rate}_2} = \frac{4}{9}
\]

Multiply both sides by **Rate₂**:

\[
4 = \frac{4}{9} \cdot \text{Rate}_2
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
1 = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \text{Rate}_2
\]

Multiply both sides by 9:

\[
\text{Rate}_2 = 9 \, \text{ml/sec}
\]

Thus, the rate at which CH₄ effuses through the same opening is 9 ml/sec. This corresponds to option **J**.
