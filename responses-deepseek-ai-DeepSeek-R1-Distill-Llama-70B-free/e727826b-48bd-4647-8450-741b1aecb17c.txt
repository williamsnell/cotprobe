Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically dealing with social and private costs and benefits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the options A through J is true. I remember that in economics, when there are externalities, the social costs and benefits can differ from the private ones. Externalities are costs or benefits that affect a third party not involved in the transaction. Negative externalities impose costs on others, like pollution, while positive externalities confer benefits, like a neighbor's nice garden.

So, the key here is to recall the relationships between marginal social cost (MSC), marginal private cost (MPC), marginal social benefit (MSB), marginal private benefit (MPB), and how externalities factor in.

I think the basic idea is that if there's a negative externality, the social cost is higher than the private cost. Because the private cost doesn't account for the externality. So, the formula should be something like MSC = MPC + negative externality. Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me make sure.

Yes, when a firm produces a good that creates a negative externality, the marginal social cost is the marginal private cost plus the marginal external cost (which is the negative externality). So, the equation would be MSC = MPC + Externality (where the externality here is a cost, so it's positive in value terms). 

Looking at the options, option G says "Marginal social cost = marginal private cost + negative externality." Wait, but wait, negative externality is a cost, so that makes sense. So G seems correct.

Wait, let me go through the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A: MSB = MPC + negative externality. No, that doesn't sound right. MSB is more about benefits, not costs. So probably not.

Option B: Value of externality = MSC. No, I don't think so. The value of the externality would be the difference between something, perhaps between social and private costs or benefits.

Option C: MPC = MSC + MSB. That doesn't make sense. Costs and benefits aren't directly added like that.

Option D: MSC = negative externality - MPC. No, that would imply a negative value, which doesn't fit. Because the externality adds to the cost, not subtracts.

Option E: MSC = MSB - positive externality. Hmm, maybe in some cases, but I don't think this is the general formula. Not sure, but I don't think this is the correct one.

Option F: MSB = MPB + positive externality. Oh, right, when there's a positive externality, the social benefit is higher than the private benefit. So MSB = MPB + positive externality. So F would be correct if the question were about benefits, but the question is about cost. So F is a correct statement, but it's not the answer here because the question is about which is true, and I think G is also correct.

Wait, the question is which of the following is true. So both F and G could be correct statements, but let's look at the options provided.

Wait, the question is asking which of the following is true, not which is false. So if both F and G are correct, but looking at the options, each option is a separate possibility. Let me check.

The options are each separate, so maybe both F and G are correct, but let me make sure. Wait, the options don't have both F and G as possible answers in one question, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is about which is true. Let me go back. The question is about cost, so G is about cost, F is about benefit.

So the correct formula for cost is G: MSC = MPC + negative externality.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, let me just make sure I'm not confusing anything. When there's a negative externality, the social cost is higher. So yes, G is correct.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be option G.

To determine which statement is true, we analyze the relationships between marginal social cost (MSC), marginal private cost (MPC), and externalities. Externalities are costs or benefits that affect third parties not involved in a transaction. A negative externality imposes additional costs on society, which are not accounted for in the private cost.

The correct relationship for negative externalities is:

**Marginal Social Cost (MSC) = Marginal Private Cost (MPC) + Negative Externality**

This means that when a negative externality exists, the social cost is higher than the private cost because it includes the external harm caused. 

Now, evaluating the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Marginal social benefit (MSB) is unrelated to marginal private cost (MPC) and negative externalities in this context.
- **B**: Incorrect. The value of an externality is not equal to marginal social costs; it represents the difference between social and private costs or benefits.
- **C**: Incorrect. Marginal private cost (MPC) is not equal to the sum of marginal social cost (MSC) and marginal social benefit (MSB).
- **D**: Incorrect. Marginal social cost (MSC) is not calculated by subtracting marginal private cost (MPC) from a negative externality.
- **E**: Incorrect. Marginal social cost (MSC) is not derived by subtracting a positive externality from marginal social benefit (MSB).
- **F**: Correct in a different context. Marginal social benefit (MSB) equals marginal private benefit (MPB) plus a positive externality, but this question focuses on cost, not benefit.
- **G**: Correct. This is the standard formula for marginal social cost (MSC) when a negative externality is present.
- **H**: Incorrect. The value of an externality is not equal to marginal private costs.
- **I**: Incorrect. Marginal social cost (MSC) is not the sum of marginal social benefit (MSB) and a negative externality.
- **J**: Incorrect. Marginal social cost (MSC) is not the sum of marginal private cost (MPC) and marginal social benefits.

The correct answer is **G**, as it accurately reflects the relationship between marginal social cost, marginal private cost, and negative externalities.
