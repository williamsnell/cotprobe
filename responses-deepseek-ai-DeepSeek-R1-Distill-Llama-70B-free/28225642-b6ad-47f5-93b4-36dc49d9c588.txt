Okay, so I've got this question about Carruthers and our duties to animals. Hmm, I remember that Carruthers wrote about animal rights, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

Wait, I think Carruthers argues that animals don't have moral rights in the same way humans do. He's a bit of a skeptic on that front. Oh right, he's associated with the idea that our duties to animals are indirect. So that would mean that we don't have direct moral obligations towards animals, but rather our duties come from somewhere else, maybe from human-centered reasons.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says duties are indirect. Let's see: option E is "indirect but fundamental." Option I is "indirect and derivative." Hmm, what's the difference between those?

Carruthers, as I recall, believes that our duties to animals are based on human concerns. For example, being kind to animals might be because it's good for human character, not because animals have inherent rights. So the duties aren't direct to the animals themselves but are derivative from human moral principles. 

So "indirect and derivative" sounds more accurate. That would be option I. Option E says indirect but fundamental, which might imply that the duties are still primary, just not direct. But I think Carruthers sees them as derivative, meaning they come from other sources, not as fundamental duties towards animals themselves.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. Carruthers is often contrasted with someone like Singer or Regan. Singer talks about direct duties based on sentience, while Carruthers says duties are indirect. So the correct term would be indirect and derivative. So I think option I is the right choice.

The correct answer is I: indirect and derivative.
