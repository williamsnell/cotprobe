Okay, so I need to figure out this multiple-choice question about Altman and speech codes justifications. The question is asking which kind of harm justifications have the best prospects according to Altman. The options are A: causal, B: expressive, C: both, D: auxiliary.

Hmm, I remember that Altman wrote about this in the context of freedom of speech and its limits. Speech codes are policies that restrict certain types of speech, often on campuses or workplaces, usually intended to prevent harassment or discrimination.

Wait, Altman's argument probably distinguishes between different types of harm. Let me think. There's causal harm, which would be direct harm like inciting violence or causing physical injury. Then there's expressive harm, which relates to the message conveyed by the speech, like offensive or discriminatory content.

I think Altman argues that justifications based on causal harm are stronger because they can be more objectively measured. Like, if speech directly causes imminent harm, it's easier to justify restricting it. For example, the classic "shouting fire in a crowded theater" scenario.

On the other hand, expressive harm is more about the impact on dignity or the message itself. Some might see this as more subjective. Altman might say that relying solely on expressive harm as a justification isn't as strong because it's harder to define and could lead to more censorship.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up. I think Altman actually supports considering both, but maybe he prioritizes one. Or perhaps he thinks that causal harm is a better basis because it's more tangible, whereas expressive harm is more controversial.

Wait, the question is about which justifications have the best prospects for success. So maybe Altman argues that justifications that include both causal and expressive harm are more likely to succeed because they cover a broader range of harms.

Or does he think that only one is better? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. Altman's work might suggest that when justifications can point to actual causal harm, the speech codes are more defensible because they prevent real, measurable harm. Expressive harm might be seen as less concrete, making it harder to justify restrictions.

Alternatively, maybe he believes that expressive harm is a valid consideration. For example, hate speech can cause emotional harm, which is a form of expressive harm. But some legal scholars argue that such justifications infringe upon free speech protections because they're based on the content's message rather than any direct action.

Wait, the question is about which justifications have the best prospects. So, if the justification is based on causal harm, it's more likely to succeed because courts often recognize imminent physical harm as a valid reason to restrict speech. Expressive harm might not hold up as well because it's more about the ideas expressed, and free speech protections are stronger against content-based restrictions.

So, the answer might be A: causal harm. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: sometimes, the law does consider emotional harm, like in cases of harassment. But I think Altman's point is that relying on causal harm provides a clearer, more objective standard, making the justification stronger.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: expressive harm, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, I think the better argument is that causal harm justifications are more likely to succeed because they're based on actual, tangible effects, making the restriction more defensible.

So, I'm leaning towards A being the correct answer. But wait, I'm a bit uncertain because I might be mixing up different scholars. Another thought: sometimes, the Supreme Court has allowed restrictions based on secondary effects, like in the case of indecency, but that's a bit different.

Wait, the option D is auxiliary harm. I don't recall Altman discussing that term specifically. So probably not D.

Putting it all together, I think the answer is A: causal harm.

The question asks which kind of harm justifications for speech codes have the best prospects for success according to Altman. The options are causal harm, expressive harm, both, or auxiliary harm.

Altman's work suggests that justifications based on **causal harm** are more likely to succeed because they involve direct, tangible harm, such as inciting violence or physical injury. Courts often recognize such harm as a valid reason to restrict speech. In contrast, expressive harm, which relates to the impact of the speech's message (e.g., offensive content), is more subjective and may face stronger free speech protections. Auxiliary harm is not a term prominently discussed by Altman, making it less likely to be the answer.

Thus, the best answer is **A: causal harm**.

Answer: A
