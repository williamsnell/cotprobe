Okay, so I've got this problem here about partial pressures of gases in a container. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I think I can figure this out.

The problem says there's a sealed, rigid container with three gases: nitrogen, argon, and water vapor. The masses are given as 28.0 grams of nitrogen, 40.0 grams of argon, and 36.0 grams of water vapor. The total pressure is 2.0 atm, and we need to find the partial pressure of nitrogen.

Wait, I remember that partial pressure is the pressure each gas would exert if it were alone in the container. Oh right, Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures! It states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. So P_total = P_nitrogen + P_argon + P_water.

But to find each partial pressure, I think I need to find the mole fraction of each gas. Because the partial pressure of a gas is its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure. So P = X_gas * P_total.

So I need to calculate the moles of each gas first. Moles are calculated as mass divided by molar mass. Let's get the molar masses right.

Nitrogen (N2) has a molar mass of 28.0 g/mol. So moles of N2 are 28.0g / 28.0 g/mol = 1 mole.

Argon (Ar) has a molar mass of about 40.0 g/mol. So 40.0g / 40.0 g/mol = 1 mole again.

Water vapor is H2O. Its molar mass is 2*(1.008) + 16.00 = around 18.016 g/mol. So 36.0g / 18.016 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 36 divided by 18 is 2, but wait, 18.016 is a bit more than 18, so it's a bit less than 2. Let me compute: 36 / 18.016. Hmm, 18.016 times 2 is 36.032, which is just slightly more than 36. So 36/18.016 is about 1.997 moles, which is roughly 2.0 moles.

Wait, but let me be precise. 18.016 * 2 = 36.032. So 36.0 / 18.016 = (36.032 - 0.032)/18.016 = 2 - (0.032/18.016). 0.032 /18 is about 0.00177, so approximately 1.998 moles. Close enough to 2.0 for our purposes, I think.

So total moles = 1 (N2) + 1 (Ar) + 2 (H2O) = 4 moles.

Mole fractions are each gas's moles divided by total moles.

So mole fraction of nitrogen is 1/4 = 0.25.

Then partial pressure of nitrogen is X_N2 * P_total. So 0.25 * 2.0 atm = 0.5 atm.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might mix up molar masses. Nitrogen is N2, molar mass 28.0, correct. Argon is monatomic, so 40.0. Water is 18.0, yeah, so 36g is 2 moles.

So moles: 1,1,2. Sum to 4. So each's mole fraction is 1/4, 1/4, 2/4=0.5.

Wait, no, wait: mole fractions are each divided by the total. So nitrogen's mole fraction is 1/4, so 0.25. So partial pressure is 0.25 * 2 atm = 0.5 atm.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.50 atm. So the answer should be B.

But wait, another thought. Are all the gases ideal? The problem states it's a sealed rigid container, so volume and temperature are constant. But assuming ideal gas behavior, the partial pressures would just depend on moles. Oh yes, because under ideal conditions, pressure is proportional to moles when volume and temperature are constant.

So yes, the approach is correct. So the partial pressure of nitrogen is 0.5 atm.

To determine the partial pressure of nitrogen in the sealed, rigid container, we use Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, which states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. The partial pressure of a gas is calculated as its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure.

First, we calculate the moles of each gas:

1. **Nitrogen (N₂):**  
   Molar mass of N₂ = 28.0 g/mol.  
   Moles of N₂ = mass / molar mass = 28.0 g / 28.0 g/mol = 1 mole.

2. **Argon (Ar):**  
   Molar mass of Ar = 40.0 g/mol.  
   Moles of Ar = 40.0 g / 40.0 g/mol = 1 mole.

3. **Water vapor (H₂O):**  
   Molar mass of H₂O = 18.016 g/mol.  
   Moles of H₂O = 36.0 g / 18.016 g/mol ≈ 2.0 moles.

The total moles of gas in the container are:  
\[
\text{Total moles} = 1 \, (\text{N}_2) + 1 \, (\text{Ar}) + 2 \, (\text{H}_2\text{O}) = 4 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Next, we calculate the mole fraction of nitrogen:  
\[
\text{Mole fraction of N}_2 = \frac{\text{Moles of N}_2}{\text{Total moles}} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25.
\]

Using Dalton's Law, the partial pressure of nitrogen is:  
\[
P_{\text{N}_2} = \text{Mole fraction of N}_2 \times \text{Total pressure} = 0.25 \times 2.0 \, \text{atm} = 0.50 \, \text{atm}.
\]

Thus, the partial pressure of nitrogen is **0.50 atm**, which corresponds to option **B**.
