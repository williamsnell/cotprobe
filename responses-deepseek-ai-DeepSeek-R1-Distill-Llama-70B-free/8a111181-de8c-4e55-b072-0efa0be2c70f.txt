Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of ammonium hydrogen sulfide, NH4HS. Hmm, let's see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty on equilibrium problems, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's tackle part (a) first. The reaction given is NH4HS(s) decomposing into NH3(g) and H2S(g). The setup is that 0.06 moles of solid NH4HS are placed in a 2.4-liter flask at 20°C. I need to find the percentage of the solid that decomposes at equilibrium.

Wait, right, when dealing with solids in equilibrium, their concentrations don't really change because the amount of solid is considered constant. So the expression for K will only involve the gaseous products. The balanced equation is already written as 1:1 for NH3 and H2S.

Let me think about setting up the ICE table. Let's let the change be 'x' moles of NH4HS that decompose. So initially, the moles of NH3 and H2S are zero because it's a solid. As the reaction proceeds, each will increase by x.

But wait, the initial moles of solid NH4HS are 0.06, but since it's a solid, it's considered to have an activity of 1 and doesn't appear in the K expression. So the K expression is K = [NH3][H2S].

The problem is to find the percentage decomposition, which would be (x / 0.06) * 100%. So I need to find x in terms of K and the volume.

But wait, I don't know the value of K at 20°C. Hmm, maybe it's provided elsewhere, or perhaps I can calculate it from given data? Oh, wait, the problem doesn't give me K, so maybe I'm supposed to look it up or it's part of the given options. Wait, no—the options are for the answers, but I don't think K is given. Hmm, maybe I should figure it out using standard methods.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to make an assumption or perhaps use a simplification. Wait, if the decomposition is not too extensive, perhaps x is much smaller than the initial amount. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the initial moles are 0.06, but since it's a solid, the amount that decomposes doesn't affect the solid's concentration. So the ICE table would look like:

Initial:
[NH3] = 0
[H2S] = 0
NH4HS(s) = 0.06 mol

Change:
NH4HS(s) → x mol decomposes
So, [NH3] increases by x, [H2S] increases by x.

At equilibrium:
[NH3] = x/V
[H2S] = x/V
Where V is 2.4 L.

So K = (x/V)^2.

But without knowing K, I can't calculate x. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Oh wait, maybe the problem expects me to know the K value for NH4HS at 20°C, or perhaps it's given in the problem somewhere. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the problem doesn't provide K, so I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe there's a standard K value I should be aware of. Wait, I'm trying to remember, but I don't recall the exact K for this reaction. Hmm, perhaps I can proceed symbolically.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to assume that the solid's decomposition is such that the solution can be found without knowing K? Or maybe I should express the answer in terms of K, but the options are numerical. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem gives me a solid, so the only thing in the K expression is the product of the concentrations of NH3 and H2S. So K = (x/V)^2.

But without K, I can't compute x. So perhaps the problem expects me to use an approximation or perhaps it's a standard value. Alternatively, maybe I can find K using the solubility product or something else.

Wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps the problem expects me to treat the solid as a source of ions, but no, in this case, it's decomposing into gases. So maybe the K is the same as the solubility product, but no, for a solid that dissociates into a gas, the K would be different.

Wait, maybe I should look up the K value for NH4HS decomposition. Oh, but I can't do that right now. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate it using the Van 't Hoff equation if given delta H, but I don't have that information either.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed without knowing K and see if I can find another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to use the ideal gas law to find the pressure, but I don't see how that would directly help.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the amount of solid present doesn't affect the equilibrium because it's a solid. So the position of equilibrium only depends on K, which is a constant at a given temperature. So without knowing K, I can't proceed numerically. But the problem expects an answer, so perhaps the value of K is implicitly provided, or maybe it's assumed that x is small.

Wait another thought: Maybe the problem is using Kp instead of Kc, but I don't think that helps without knowing K.

Wait, perhaps I can find the K value from standard tables. Let me try to recall. I think for NH4HS, the K at 20°C is around 1.2 × 10^-5 or something like that. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use K = 1.2e-5 or some value like that.

Wait, but I'm just making this up since I don't have the data. Maybe I should think differently. Let's say that K is [NH3][H2S] = (x/V)^2.

If I can express x in terms of K and V, but without knowing K, I can't find x. So perhaps the problem gave K elsewhere, but I must have missed it.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, no, it doesn't provide K. Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to use the fact that the solution is in the options, so perhaps I can work backward.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose K is (x/V)^2. So K = (x/(2.4))^2.

Now, the percentage decomposition is (x / 0.06) * 100 = (x * 100) / 0.06 ≈ 1666.67 x.

So, if I can find x, I can find the percentage.

But without K, I can't find x. Hmm, perhaps I need to make an assumption. Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the solution is dilute, so x is small, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can express the percentage in terms of K.

Percentage = (x/0.06)*100.

But x = sqrt(K) * V.

Wait, because K = (x/V)^2 → x = V * sqrt(K).

So x = 2.4 * sqrt(K).

Then, percentage is (2.4 * sqrt(K) / 0.06) * 100 = (40 * sqrt(K)) * 100 → wait, no, let me calculate correctly.

Wait, 2.4 / 0.06 is 40. So x = 40 * sqrt(K).

Thus, percentage is (40 * sqrt(K) ) * 100% → 4000 * sqrt(K) %.

Hmm, but without knowing K, I can't compute this. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem provides K indirectly. Let's think, perhaps the problem is a standard one, and the K value for NH4HS at 20°C is known to be around 1.1e-5 or something like that.

Wait, I think I remember that the K for NH4HS is approximately 1.1 × 10^-5 at 20°C. Let me proceed with that.

So K = (x/(2.4))^2 = 1.1e-5.

Taking square roots on both sides:

x/(2.4) = sqrt(1.1e-5) → sqrt(1.1e-5) is approximately 0.0033166.

So x = 2.4 * 0.0033166 ≈ 0.0079598 moles.

Then, the percentage decomposition is (0.0079598 / 0.06) * 100 ≈ 13.266%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, perhaps I got the K value wrong.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the K value is higher, like 1.5e-5.

Let me try K = 1.5e-5.

Then, x/(2.4) = sqrt(1.5e-5) ≈ 0.00387298.

x ≈ 2.4 * 0.00387298 ≈ 0.00929 moles.

Percentage: (0.00929 / 0.06)*100 ≈ 15.48%.

Still not matching any options. Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong K.

Wait, maybe the actual K is higher. Let me think again. Suppose K is around 3e-5.

x/(2.4) = sqrt(3e-5) ≈ 0.005477.

x ≈ 2.4 * 0.005477 ≈ 0.01314 moles.

Percentage: (0.01314 / 0.06)*100 ≈ 21.9%, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should think of K as (x^2)/(V^2) = K → x = V*sqrt(K).

Wait, perhaps I took the reciprocal by mistake. Wait, no, K = [NH3][H2S] = (x/V)^2.

Wait, perhaps the K is expressed differently. Alternatively, maybe I should find K from the solubility, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Ksp of NH4HS, but wait, Ksp is for dissociation in solution, but here it's a decomposition into gases. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing concepts.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the K for NH4HS(s) ⇌ NH3(g) + H2S(g). Let me think: I recall that the K for this reaction at 20°C is approximately 1.2 × 10^-5.

Wait, let me go back. Using K = 1.2e-5:

x = 2.4 * sqrt(1.2e-5) → sqrt(1.2e-5)= approx 0.003464.

So x = 2.4 * 0.003464 ≈ 0.0083136 mol.

Percentage: (0.0083136 / 0.06)*100 ≈ 13.856%.

Hmm, not matching options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong K. Alternatively, maybe the K is given in the problem and I missed it.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate K using the standard Gibbs free energy or something, but without data, that's impossible.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's say the percentage is around 37% as in option D: 37.33%.

If the percentage is 37.33%, then x = 0.06 * 0.3733 ≈ 0.0224 mol.

So, [NH3] = 0.0224 / 2.4 ≈ 0.009333 M.

So, K = (0.009333)^2 ≈ 8.7e-5.

Hmm, that's higher than what I thought earlier. So perhaps K is around 8.7e-5.

Wait, but earlier I thought K was 1.2e-5, which would give a lower percentage. So perhaps the correct K is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without knowing K and see if any of the options make sense.

Wait, let's check the options to see if any of them, when plugged back, would give a reasonable K.

For example, option D says 37.33% decomposition.

So x = 0.06 * 0.3733 ≈ 0.0224 mol.

Concentration of each gas is 0.0224 / 2.4 ≈ 0.009333 M.

Thus, K = (0.009333)^2 ≈ 8.7e-5.

If K is indeed around 8.7e-5, then option D would make sense. But without knowing K, I can't be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is considering the reverse reaction, but no, the reaction is written as the decomposition into NH3 and H2S.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing Kp and Kc. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the decomposition is 100%, but that's not possible because the solid would completely decompose, but that's not the case as it's an equilibrium.

Wait, I'm stuck on part (a) because without knowing K, I can't compute the percentage. So perhaps I should look at part (b) and see if it can help.

Part (b) asks: Calculate the number of moles of ammonia that would have to be added to the flask to reduce the decomposition of the solid to 1%.

Hmm, so initially, at equilibrium, without adding any ammonia, the decomposition is, say, x moles. But when we add ammonia, the system shifts to left, decreasing decomposition.

So, the idea is to add enough NH3 so that only 1% of the solid decomposes.

Wait, so in part (a), the decomposition is higher, and in part (b), we add NH3 to make it 1%. 

But perhaps I can relate the two parts. Let me think about how adding NH3 affects the equilibrium.

If I add 'n' moles of NH3, then the concentration of NH3 becomes (x + n)/V, but wait, no. Wait, the decomposition of the solid produces x moles of NH3 and x moles of H2S. But if I add 'n' moles of NH3, then the total [NH3] becomes (x + n)/V.

But wait, no: when you add NH3, it shifts the equilibrium. Let me set up the ICE table again, including the added NH3.

Wait, initial moles after adding NH3:

NH4HS(s): 0.06 mol

NH3: n moles added.

H2S: 0.

But as the solid decomposes, it produces x moles of NH3 and x moles of H2S. So at equilibrium, NH3 is (n + x), H2S is x.

So the K expression is K = [(n + x)/V] * [x/V].

But in part (b), we want the decomposition to be 1%, so x = 0.01 * 0.06 = 0.0006 mol.

So x = 0.0006 mol.

Thus, K = [(n + 0.0006)/2.4] * [0.0006/2.4].

We can plug in x=0.0006 and solve for n.

But again, without knowing K, I can't compute n. So perhaps I should use the value of K from part (a), assuming that K is the same.

Wait, but if I can solve part (a) and (b) together, perhaps I can express n in terms of K.

Let's denote:

In part (a), x = V * sqrt(K).

In part (b), with x=0.0006, K = [(n + 0.0006)/V] * [0.0006/V].

But K is the same in both cases.

So, from part (a): K = (x_a / V)^2.

From part (b): K = [(n + x_b)/V] * [x_b / V], where x_b = 0.0006.

So, equate the two expressions:

(x_a / V)^2 = [(n + 0.0006)/V] * [0.0006/V].

Simplify:

(x_a)^2 = (n + 0.0006) * 0.0006.

But x_a is 0.06 * (percentage from part a) / 100.

Wait, this is getting complicated, but perhaps I can proceed.

Let me write:

x_a = 0.06 * (percent_a / 100).

Then, (0.06 * percent_a / 100)^2 = (n + 0.0006) * 0.0006.

But without knowing percent_a, I can't proceed further. So perhaps I should make an assumption that percent_a is around 37%, as in option D.

So, x_a = 0.06 * 0.3733 ≈ 0.0224 mol.

Thus, K = (0.0224 / 2.4)^2 ≈ (0.009333)^2 ≈ 8.7e-5.

Now, in part (b), K = 8.7e-5 = [(n + 0.0006)/2.4] * [0.0006/2.4].

So, compute:

[(n + 0.0006)/2.4] * [0.0006/2.4] = 8.7e-5.

Compute the right side:

(n + 0.0006) * 0.0006 / (2.4 * 2.4) = 8.7e-5.

Calculate denominator: 2.4^2 = 5.76.

So,

(n + 0.0006) * 0.0006 / 5.76 = 8.7e-5.

Multiply both sides by 5.76:

(n + 0.0006) * 0.0006 = 8.7e-5 * 5.76.

Calculate RHS: 8.7e-5 * 5.76 ≈ 0.00050112.

So,

(n + 0.0006) * 0.0006 = 0.00050112.

Divide both sides by 0.0006:

n + 0.0006 = 0.00050112 / 0.0006 ≈ 0.8352.

Thus, n ≈ 0.8352 - 0.0006 ≈ 0.8346 mol.

Looking at the options, option D has 0.
