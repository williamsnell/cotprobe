Question:

If GNP = $2,000 billion and the velocity of money is 4, what isthe money supply?

Options:

B: $250 billion
C: $700 billion
D: $1000 billion
E: $200 billion
F: $800 billion
G: $450 billion
H: $600 billion
I: $400 billion
J: $500 billion

Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the money supply given the GNP and the velocity of money. Hmm, I remember from my studies that there's a formula connecting these variables. Let me think.

I think the formula is something like GNP equals the money supply multiplied by the velocity of money. Oh wait, right! The equation is GNP = M * V. So, M stands for the money supply, V is velocity, and GNP is the gross national product.

So the question gives me GNP as $2,000 billion. Wait, no, wait a second, 2,000 billion would be 2 followed by 9 zeros, so that's like 2 trillion. But maybe the units are okay as given. Anyway, the velocity is 4.

I need to find M, the money supply. So rearranging the formula, M should be GNP divided by V. So M = GNP / V.

Plugging in the numbers, that's 2,000 billion divided by 4. Let me do that math. 2000 divided by 4 is 500. So 2000 billion divided by 4 is 500 billion. So the money supply should be $500 billion.

Looking at the options, option J is $500 billion. So I think the answer is J.

To determine the money supply, we use the formula:

\[
GNP = M \times V
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{GNP}{V}
\]

Given \( GNP = \$2,000 \text{ billion} \) and \( V = 4 \):

\[
M = \frac{2,000}{4} = 500 \text{ billion}
\]

Thus, the money supply is \$500 billion, which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
