Question:

A rancher was the owner of a parcel of land in fee simple. The rancher left the parcel in 1977 to move to the city. A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. Upon the rancher's death in 2010, his son, as his sole heir, brings an ejectment suit to recover possession of the property from the man. In his action, the son will most probably

Options:

A: lose, because the man's occupation of the property was continuous and hostile.
B: lose, because the man has been living on the property for more than 20 years.
C: lose, because the man's occupation of the land was uninterrupted.
D: win, because the man did not have a legitimate claim to the property.
E: win, because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year.
F: win, because the man did not have the rancher's permission to live on the property.
G: win, because the statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder- man until his interest becomes possessory.
H: lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.
I: win, because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.
J: win, because the man had abandoned the property for a year.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about adverse possession, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on property law, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a rancher who owns land in fee simple. He leaves in 1977, and then someone else takes possession in 1978 as an adverse possessor. This person stays until 1988, then leaves for a year to care for his sick mother, comes back in 1990, and stays until 2010. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.

The rancher died in 2010, and his son is suing to get the property back. The question is whether the son will win or lose.

First, I remember that adverse possession requires certain elements: the possessor must have actual possession, it must be open and notorious, hostile (without permission), continuous, and for the statutory period.

So let's break down the timeline. The man took possession in 1978. He left in 1988 for a year, returned in 1990, and stayed until 2010. So his total time on the property is from 1978 to 1988 (10 years), then 1990 to 2010 (20 years). Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. So when does the clock start?

In some states, if the possessor is interrupted, the clock stops, and they have to start over. But if the interruption is temporary and they return, it might not break continuity. But I think the key point is whether the man's absence was long enough to break the continuity.

Wait, he left for one year (from 1988 to 1989) and then came back. So from 1978 to 1988 is 10 years, left for one year, then from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years. So total occupation is 30 years, but with a one-year gap. Does that gap break the continuity?

I think that for continuity, the possessor must maintain actual possession without interruption. If he left for a year, that could be considered an interruption. But does it matter how long the interruption is? I think any break in possession might restart the clock, unless the break is minimal or under certain circumstances.

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. So even if he had a break, does the time before and after the break add up? Or does the clock reset?

I think in some jurisdictions, if the adverse possessor leaves the property but later returns, the time before and after can be tacked together. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some courts require continuous possession without any breaks. So a one-year absence might break the continuity, meaning he only has 10 years before the break and then 20 after. But that's 30 total, but with a gap. So the total time might not meet the 20 years if the break stops the clock.

Wait, but if he's been there from 1990 to 2010, that's 20 years. So even if the initial 10 years don't count because of the break, the 20 years after 1990 would satisfy the statutory period. Because from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years. So the man would have completed the 20 years after he returned.

But wait, when did the rancher die? In 2010. So the man had been there from 1990 to 2010, which is exactly 20 years. So that might be sufficient for adverse possession.

But also, the rancher conveyed the property to his son in 1994. So the son is the current owner when the man was still on the property. So the question is whether the man's adverse possession time counts against the son as well.

I think that once adverse possession starts, it can continue against subsequent owners. Because the son is the new owner after 1994, but the man's possession started before that. So the man's possession from 1990 onward would continue to count towards the 20 years, even against the son.

Wait, but the man's initial possession was from 1978 to 1988, then left, came back in 1990. So perhaps the continuity was broken, but if he re-established adverse possession in 1990, then from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years. That would meet the statutory period.

So the man would have acquired title by adverse possession by 2010. So when the son sues, the man has already met the 20-year requirement.

But wait, the question is about the son bringing the suit. So if the man has acquired title by adverse possession, then the son, as the current owner, would lose because the man now has title.

Looking at the options:

Option H says the son loses because the man acquired title by adverse possession.

Option E says the son wins because the man left for a year, which might have broken continuity.

Option G talks about the statutory period not running against a remainderman until possessory. But I don't think a remainder is involved here; the rancher owned it in fee simple and then devised it to his son, so the son is the new owner. So G might not apply.

Option J says the son wins because the man had abandoned for a year. But if the man returned and stayed for 20 more years, maybe the abandonment was only temporary and possession resumed.

So putting it together, the man's possession from 1990 to 2010 is 20 years, meeting the statutory period. So the son would lose because the man has acquired title. So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial period from 1978 to 1988 was 10 years. Then he left for a year, and came back. Does that break the continuity? If so, his 10 years before don't count, but the 20 after do. But some states allow tacking where the same person resumes possession, so the total time would be 30 years, but with a break. But the statutory period is 20, so even if the initial 10 don't count, the 20 after do.

So the man has been there from 1990 to 2010, which is exactly 20 years. So he meets the requirement.

Therefore, the son would lose, and the answer is H.

The question revolves around whether the son of the rancher can recover possession of the property from the man who has been occupying it since 1978. The key issue is whether the man has acquired title by adverse possession, which requires actual, open, notorious, hostile, and continuous possession for the statutory period of 20 years.

The man took possession in 1978 and stayed until 1988, leaving for one year to care for his sick mother. He returned in 1990 and remained until 2010. The critical point is whether the one-year absence from 1988 to 1989 breaks the continuity of possession. In some jurisdictions, a temporary interruption does not necessarily break continuity if the possessor resumes possession. However, in this case, the man’s possession from 1990 to 2010 constitutes a continuous 20-year period, which satisfies the statutory requirement for adverse possession.

The rancher conveyed the property to his son in 1994, but the man’s adverse possession continues to run against the son as the new owner. By 2010, the man had been in continuous possession for 20 years, thereby acquiring title by adverse possession. When the son brings an ejectment suit, the man’s title is already perfected, and the son cannot recover possession.

Among the options, the correct answer is:

**H: lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.**

This is because the man’s possession from 1990 to 2010 meets the 20-year statutory period, and he has thereby acquired title to the property.
