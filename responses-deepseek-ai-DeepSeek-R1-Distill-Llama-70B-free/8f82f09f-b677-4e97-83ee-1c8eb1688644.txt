Okay, so I've got this question about Cicero and his philosophical views. Let me try to work through this step by step. The question is asking what Cicero argues will keep us from going morally astray. The options are from A to J, each representing a different guide for moral behavior.

First, I remember that Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman. He was a Stoic, I think, or at least influenced by Stoic thought. Stoicism emphasizes reason and the natural order of the universe. So maybe his views align with following nature.

Looking at the options:

A: Religious edicts. I'm not sure if Cicero focused much on religious dictates. He might have discussed natural law, which could be seen as separate from religious edicts.

B: Historical precedents. That sounds more like looking at past events to guide decisions, which I don't recall being Cicero's main point.

C: Teachings of philosophers. Well, he was a philosopher himself, but I don't think he said that following philosophers in general is the key. Maybe more about a specific principle.

D: Nature as our guide. This rings a bell. I think Cicero talked about natural law, which is based on reason and the natural order. So following nature would mean adhering to this universal law.

E: Conscience. While conscience is important, I'm not certain if Cicero specifically said that as the primary guide.

F: Laws. He might have respected the law, but laws can vary and might not always align with morality, so maybe not the answer.

G: Personal desires. That sounds more like Epicureanism, which is different from Stoicism. So probably not this.

H: Instincts. I'm not sure about this one. Instincts can be unreliable and vary between individuals.

I: Societal norms. These can change and might not always be moral, so I don't think Cicero would advocate following them blindly.

J: Friends and family. That seems too subjective and variable, so unlikely.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is D: follow Nature as our guide. Because Cicero's philosophy, influenced by Stoicism, would emphasize living in accordance with nature and natural law as the moral path.

The correct answer is D: follow Nature as our guide. Cicero, influenced by Stoic philosophy, emphasized living in accordance with nature and natural law as the key to moral guidance.
