Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. I need to figure out which statement about parametric tests is incorrect. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that parametric tests have certain assumptions. They usually assume that the data follows a specific distribution, often the normal distribution. So for example, t-tests and ANOVA are parametric because they rely on the data being normally distributed.

Looking at the options, let's go one by one.

Option A: They are more robust and flexible. Wait, I thought nonparametric tests are more robust because they don't rely on distribution assumptions. Parametric tests are less robust because they can be sensitive if their assumptions aren't met. So A might be incorrect because parametric tests aren't more robust.

Option B: They are based on homogeneity of variance. Yeah, that's right. Many parametric tests, like ANOVA, assume that the variance is the same across groups. So B is correct.

Option C: They are used for ordinal and nominal data. Wait, no. Parametric tests typically require data to be at least interval or ratio. Ordinal and nominal data are usually handled with nonparametric tests. So C might be incorrect. Because parametric tests are generally for continuous data, not categorical.

Option D: They are less sensitive to outliers. No, parametric tests can be more sensitive to outliers because they assume a specific distribution. Outliers can really affect means, which are used in parametric tests. So D is incorrect because parametric tests are more sensitive, not less.

Option E: They do not assume an underlying population distribution. No, that's wrong. Parametric tests do assume a specific distribution, like normality. So E is incorrect. So parametric tests do assume an underlying distribution, so E is a wrong statement about them.

Option F: They are based on independence of observations. Yes, most statistical tests, including parametric ones, require that observations are independent. So F is correct.

Option G: They are based on normal distribution. Yes, many parametric tests assume normality. So G is correct.

Option H: They can be used when data is not normally distributed. Wait, no. If the data isn't normal, parametric tests may not be appropriate, unless you have a large sample size maybe. So H is incorrect because parametric tests assume normality, but sometimes you can use them with very large samples due to the Central Limit Theorem.

Option I: They are used when the sample size is small. Hmm, no. When sample size is small, especially with non-normal data, nonparametric tests are often preferred because parametric tests' assumptions might not hold. So I is incorrect.

Wait, the question is asking which statement cannot be correct about parametric tests. So I need to find the option that's incorrect.

Let me summarize:

Parametric tests assume a distribution (like normal), require certain conditions (like homogeneity of variance, independence), are more sensitive to outliers, are used for interval/ratio data, can be less flexible because of these assumptions.

So looking at the options:

A: More robust? No, parametric are less robust because they rely on assumptions. So A is incorrect.

C: Used for ordinal/nominal? No, that's nonparametric. So C is incorrect.

D: Less sensitive to outliers? No, parametric tests are more sensitive. So D is incorrect.

E: Do not assume distribution? No, they do. So E is incorrect.

H: Can be used when data is not normal? Sometimes, but generally no. So H is incorrect.

I: Used when sample size is small? No, usually the opposite. So I is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is not correct about parametric tests. So which one is false.

The question is looking for the incorrect statement about parametric tests. So which option is something that parametric tests don't have.

Looking back, option E says they do not assume an underlying population distribution. That's incorrect, because parametric tests do assume an underlying distribution. So E is wrong.

Wait, the question asks which statement cannot be correct about parametric tests. So the correct answer is the statement that is not true.

So the incorrect statement is the one that says something that's not true about parametric tests.

So option E is incorrect because parametric tests do assume an underlying distribution.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is which statement can not be correct. So which of the following is not a correct statement about parametric tests.

Looking at each option again:

A: More robust? No, so incorrect. So A is a wrong statement.

C: Used for ordinal/nominal? No, so incorrect.

E: Do not assume distribution? No, incorrect.

So the options that are incorrect (so the statements that cannot be correct about parametric tests) are A, C, D, E, H, I.

The question is asking which one is not correct. So the correct answer is the one that is an incorrect statement about parametric tests.

So looking at the options, E says parametric tests do not assume an underlying distribution. That's the opposite of the truth. Parametric tests do assume a distribution. So E is incorrect.

So the answer is E.

Wait, but let me check all options again.

Option H: They can be used when data is not normally distributed. Well, sometimes people use parametric tests with non-normal data if the sample size is large, but generally, it's a violation. So H is not a correct statement about parametric tests because they are based on the assumption of normality.

But then, the question is about which statement cannot be correct. So both E and H are incorrect statements about parametric tests. So which one is the answer?

Wait, the question is phrased as "which statement can not be correct". So the options are about parametric tests. So which of these is incorrect.

Looking again, E is definitely incorrect because parametric tests require an assumed distribution.

H: They can be used when data is not normally distributed. Well, sometimes they are used, but it's a misuse. So the statement H is not correct about parametric tests because they are supposed to be used when data is normally distributed, not when it isn't. So H is incorrect.

Wait, but let's think about the options given. The question is which statement cannot be correct.

So the question is looking for the incorrect statement.

Let me list the options again:

A: They are more robust and flexible. (Parametric are less robust, so A is incorrect.)

B: Based on homogeneity of variance. (True for some tests like ANOVA, so B is correct.)

C: Used for ordinal and nominal data. (No, used for continuous, so C is incorrect.)

D: Less sensitive to outliers. (No, more sensitive, so D is incorrect.)

E: Do not assume underlying distribution. (No, they do, so E is incorrect.)

F: Based on independence. (True, so F is correct.)

G: Based on normal distribution. (True, G correct.)

H: Can be used when data is not normally distributed. (Generally not, though sometimes with large n. So H is incorrect.)

I: Used when sample size is small. (No, small samples often require nonparametric, so I is incorrect.)

So the options A, C, D, E, H, and I are incorrect statements about parametric tests.

But only one option is correct as the answer. So looking back at the question, which one is not correct, i.e., which statement is false.

The possible options in the question are A to I, and the correct answer is the incorrect statement.

Wait, the question asks which statement CANNOT be correct about parametric tests. So which of the options is an incorrect statement.

So let me think about each option again.

Option E says "They do not assume an underlying population distribution." That's wrong because parametric tests do require an assumption about the distribution, like normality.

Option H says they can be used when data isn't normally distributed. Well, in practice, sometimes people do, but it's not correct. So H's statement is incorrect about parametric tests.

But which one is the answer? The question provides options, and only one is correct.

Looking back, the initial question says that nonparametric tests are less powerful, which is correct.

So the incorrect statement about parametric tests is E: They do not assume an underlying population distribution. Because parametric tests do assume a distribution.

So the correct answer is E.

To determine which statement cannot be correct about parametric tests, let us analyze each option:

- **A: They are more robust and flexible.**  
  This is incorrect because parametric tests are less robust and flexible compared to nonparametric tests. Parametric tests rely on specific assumptions, such as normality, which can make them sensitive to violations.

- **B: They are based on homogeneity of variance.**  
  This is correct. Many parametric tests, such as ANOVA, assume homogeneity of variance across groups.

- **C: They are used for ordinal and nominal data.**  
  This is incorrect. Parametric tests are typically used for continuous (interval or ratio) data, not ordinal or nominal data, which are handled by nonparametric tests.

- **D: They are less sensitive to outliers.**  
  This is incorrect. Parametric tests are generally more sensitive to outliers because they rely on means and distributions that can be heavily influenced by outliers.

- **E: They do not assume an underlying population distribution.**  
  This is incorrect. Parametric tests do assume an underlying population distribution, such as normality, which is a key characteristic of these tests.

- **F: They are based on independence of observations.**  
  This is correct. Parametric tests require independence of observations, as do most statistical tests.

- **G: They are based on normal distribution.**  
  This is correct. Many parametric tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, assume that the data follows a normal distribution.

- **H: They can be used when data is not normally distributed.**  
  This is incorrect. While parametric tests can sometimes be used with non-normal data under certain conditions (e.g., large sample sizes), they are generally designed for normally distributed data. Using them for non-normal data is often a misuse.

- **I: They are used when the sample size is small.**  
  This is incorrect. Parametric tests are not preferred for small sample sizes, especially with non-normal data, as their assumptions may not hold. Nonparametric tests are often used in such cases.

The question asks for the statement that cannot be correct about parametric tests. Among the options, **E** stands out as the most clearly incorrect statement because parametric tests fundamentally rely on assuming an underlying population distribution, such as normality. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E**
