Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how Monetarists would stabilize the economy. Hmm, I remember that Monetarism is an economic theory, right? I think it's associated with Milton Friedman. Let me recall what I know about their views.

Monetarists focus a lot on the money supply. They believe that the money supply has a significant impact on economic activity. I remember something about the quantity theory of money, which says that the general price level is directly related to the money supply. So, if the money supply grows too quickly, inflation happens, and if it's too slow, maybe deflation.

So the question is asking how Monetarists would stabilize economic fluctuations. Stabilizing would mean keeping the economy on an even keel, avoiding big ups and downs like booms and recessions. Monetarists aren't too keen on active government intervention, if I recall correctly. They prefer a more hands-off approach, maybe using rules rather than discretion.

I think their main policy recommendation is about the growth rate of the money supply. Like, they suggest that the central bank should aim for a steady, predictable increase in the money supply. This is because if the money supply grows steadily, it supports economic growth without causing inflation. So instead of changing the money supply a lot in response to current economic conditions, which could cause unpredictability, they'd set a consistent growth rate.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: Decreasing the money supply. That doesn't sound right because it's a specific action, not a rule. Plus, decreasing might lead to deflation.

Option B: Stabilizing the growth rate of the money supply. This aligns with what I was thinking. They'd want a stable, predictable growth rate.

Option C: Manipulating exchange rates. That's more of a tool for open-economy macro policies, maybe not the main monetarist approach.

Option D: Imposing tariffs. That's a trade policy, probably more related to protectionism than monetarism.

Option E: Adjusting tax rates frequently. That's fiscal policy, which monetarists might not emphasize as much. They focus more on monetary policy.

Option F: Providing subsidies. Again, that's fiscal policy and direct intervention, which monetarists might oppose.

Option G: Wage-price guidelines. That's like incomes policy, which I think Keynesians might support more, not monetarists.

Option H: Increasing government spending. That's fiscal policy again, and monetarists are more about monetary tools.

Option I: Price controls. That's a direct intervention in markets, which I don't think monetarists favor.

Option J: Increasing interest rates. Well, central banks do set interest rates, but monetarists are more about the money supply growth. Raising rates might be a tool, but the goal is to stabilize the money supply growth, not just adjust rates frequently.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option B: By stabilizing the growth rate of the money supply.

Monetarists focus on the money supply as a key driver of economic activity and advocate for stabilizing its growth rate to prevent economic fluctuations. They believe that a steady, predictable increase in the money supply supports economic growth without causing inflation, rather than using discretionary policies. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

B: By stabilizing the growth rate of the money supply.

Answer: B
