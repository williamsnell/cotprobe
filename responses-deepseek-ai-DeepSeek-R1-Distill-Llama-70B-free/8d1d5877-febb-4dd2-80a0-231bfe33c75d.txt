Okay, so I need to compute the product (20)(-8) in Z_26. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on modular arithmetic, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that Z_26 means the integers modulo 26. So all operations are done with respect to mod 26.

The problem is (20) * (-8) in Z_26. So I should multiply 20 and -8 first, and then take the result modulo 26.

Wait, but wait, no, actually, I think in modular arithmetic, you can reduce each number modulo 26 first before multiplying, but since 20 is already less than 26, and -8 is the same as 18 mod 26 (because -8 +26=18). Wait, is that right? Let me check: -8 mod 26 is indeed 18 because 26-8=18.

So another way to look at this is that -8 is equivalent to 18 in Z_26. So the product becomes 20 * 18 mod 26.

Alternatively, I could compute 20*(-8) and then take mod 26. Let's try both ways to see if I get the same result.

First method: 20 * (-8) = -160. Now, to find -160 mod 26.

Wait, how do I compute that? Modulus can be a bit tricky with negative numbers. I think the way to do it is to find how many times 26 goes into 160 and then adjust accordingly.

Let me compute 160 divided by 26. 26*6=156, which is 6*26=156. 160-156=4. So 26*6=156, 26*6+4=160. So 160 mod26 is 4. So -160 mod26 would be -4 mod26. But wait, mod26 can't be negative, so I add 26 to -4 to make it positive. So -4 +26=22. So -160 mod26 is 22.

Wait, but let me check that again. So 26*6=156, 156+4=160, so 160=26*6 +4. So 160 mod26 is 4, so -160 mod26 is -4, which is equivalent to 22 mod26. That makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 20 * 18 mod26.

20*18 = 360. Now compute 360 mod26.

Let me see, 26*13=338, because 26*10=260, 26*3=78, so 260+78=338. So 26*13=338.

360-338=22. So 360 mod26 is22.

Wait, so both methods give me 22. So the product (20)*(-8) in Z_26 is 22.

Looking back at the options, the options are A through J, with I being 22.

So the correct answer should be I:22.

To compute the product \((20)(-8)\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_{26}\), we first recognize that operations in \(\mathbb{Z}_{26}\) are performed modulo 26. 

1. **Convert \(-8\) to a positive equivalent in \(\mathbb{Z}_{26}\):**  
   \(-8 + 26 = 18\), so \(-8 \equiv 18 \pmod{26}\).

2. **Multiply the two numbers:**  
   \(20 \times 18 = 360\).

3. **Compute \(360 \mod 26\):**  
   Divide 360 by 26: \(26 \times 13 = 338\), and \(360 - 338 = 22\). Thus, \(360 \equiv 22 \pmod{26}\).

Therefore, the product \((20)(-8)\) in \(\mathbb{Z}_{26}\) is \(22\), which corresponds to option I.
