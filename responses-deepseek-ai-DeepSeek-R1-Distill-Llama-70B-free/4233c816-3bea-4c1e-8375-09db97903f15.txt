Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Mill and his views on justice versus other moral obligations. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what distinction Mill claims corresponds perfectly with the difference between justice and other moral obligations. The options are from A to J, each pairing different terms.

First, I remember that John Stuart Mill was a utilitarian philosopher. Utilitarianism is about the greatest happiness for the greatest number, right? So in his ethical theory, actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they don't.

Now, the specific topic here is justice. I think Mill discussed justice in his work, probably in Utilitarianism. I recall that he tried to reconcile utilitarianism with the concept of justice, which some critics argued was incompatible.

Wait, justice is often associated with rights and duties. Mill must have addressed how justice fits into his utilitarian framework. I think he said that justice is a subset of moral obligations, specifically the ones that are perfect duties. Oh wait, what's a perfect duty? I think in ethics, a perfect duty is one that is specific, well-defined, and incumbent on everyone in certain circumstances. Like the duty not to kill or harm others.

Imperfect duties, on the other hand, are more about general principles rather than specific actions. For example, charity is an imperfect duty because you should give to those in need, but there's no specific amount or who exactly you must give to. So, it's more open-ended.

So if justice corresponds to perfect duties, then the other moral obligations would be imperfect. Let me check the options. Option I says perfect and imperfect obligations. That seems to fit.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not confusing this with other philosophers. Kant, for example, talked about perfect and imperfect duties as part of his deontological ethics. But Mill, being a utilitarian, might have a different take. However, I think Mill does use the perfect/imperfect distinction. He argues that justice involves duties that are perfect because they're based on rights, which people can demand from others. Other moral obligations are imperfect because they're about what's good to do but not strictly required.

Let me think about the other options to make sure. Option A: strong and weak duties. I'm not sure about that. Strong duties might imply something else, maybe more binding, but I don't recall Mill using that terminology.

Option B: personal and public. Doesn't ring a bell with Mill's justice discussion.

Option E: positive and negative duties. Positive duties are about doing something (like helping), negative about not doing harm. But I think that's more related to the act utilitarian versus rule utilitarian debate, not specifically Mill's view on justice.

Wait, could it be E? Because justice often involves negative duties, like not infringing on others' rights. But no, the question is about the distinction between justice and other moral obligations. So if justice is about negative duties, other obligations would be positive. But I'm not sure if that's the exact distinction Mill made.

Alternatively, I remember reading that Mill considered justice to be about those duties that, when violated, justify punishment. These are perfect duties because they are specific and based on others' rights. Other moral duties don't carry the same weight and are more about what's morally good but not necessarily enforceable.

So that brings me back to option I: perfect and imperfect obligations. That seems correct.

I think I can confidently go with option I.

The question asks about Mill's distinction between justice and other moral obligations. Mill, a utilitarian philosopher, discussed justice in the context of moral duties. He argued that justice corresponds to perfect duties, which are specific, well-defined, and based on rights that others can demand. In contrast, other moral obligations are imperfect duties, which are more general and open-ended, such as charity. This distinction aligns with option I, which pairs perfect and imperfect obligations.

Answer: I
