Okay, so I need to figure out what Lyotard's statement means. The quote is "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives." Hmm, I remember that Lyotard was a French philosopher associated with postmodernism. So, what's a meta-narrative?

From what I've read before, meta-narratives are like big, overarching stories or theories that explain everything. They're universal and claim to be true for everyone. Examples might include things like the Enlightenment idea of progress, Marxism's historical dialectic, or religious doctrines that explain the world.

So, when Lyotard says there's incredulity towards these meta-narratives, he's talking about a skepticism or distrust. Postmodernism questions these grand, universal explanations. It doesn't accept them at face value anymore.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one:

Option A: Postmodernism disregards individual stories. Wait, no. I think postmodernism actually focuses more on individual narratives rather than dismissing them. It's the big stories that are doubted, not the small ones.

Option B: Universal values are meaningless. That's possible. If you don't believe in the big narratives that often underpin universal values, maybe those values lose their meaning. But I'm not sure if that's the direct meaning here.

Option C: Literature reproduces repression. I'm not too familiar with this point. I think some postmodern critics talk about how certain narratives can be oppressive, but Lyotard's quote doesn't directly say that literature does this. So maybe C isn't the best fit.

Option D: The concept of truth is objective and undeniable. That seems opposite. Postmodernism is more about questioning objective truth, so D doesn't fit.

Option E: The law is static. I don't see how that relates. The quote is about meta-narratives, not specifically about laws or their nature.

Option F: Individual stories are suspect. Wait, no. The incredulity is toward meta-narratives, not individual stories. In fact, I think postmodernism often emphasizes individual narratives over the grand ones. So F might be the opposite.

Option G: Postmodernism promotes the acceptance of all narratives. Hmm, that could be. If meta-narratives are distrusted, maybe all smaller narratives are accepted as equally valid. But wait, isn't that more about relativism? I'm not sure; maybe G is a possible answer.

Option H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. That seems a bit broad. While it's true that postmodernism challenges many forms of authority, especially those tied to meta-narratives, does it reject all forms? Maybe not entirely, but this could be a possibility.

Wait, going back to the original statement. It's about incredulity towards meta-narratives, which are often the big, authoritative explanations. So, the rejection is specifically of these grand narratives, not necessarily all individual stories or all authority in every form.

Looking at the options again, the correct answer should capture that distrust in the big stories, but not necessarily dismiss individual ones.

Option B says universal values are meaningless. If meta-narratives are the ones providing universal values, then doubting them would make those values seem meaningless. That makes sense.

Option G suggests accepting all narratives, which would mean no hierarchy, just multiple small stories. But that's more about relativism than the distrust in the big ones.

Wait, the quote isn't about accepting all narratives but being skeptical of the big ones. So the answer is more about the distrust in meta-narratives, which are often the sources of universal values.

So, the correct answer is B: Universal values are meaningless. Because without belief in the meta-narratives that support them, those universal values lose their credibility.

Wait, but another thought: Option B says "universal values are meaningless," which is a strong statement. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F: Individual stories are suspect. Wait no, because the distrust is in the meta-narratives, not the individual. So F is not correct.

Another option is H: Postmodernism rejects all forms of authority. But that might be too broad. The quote is specifically about meta-narratives, which are a form of authority, but not necessarily all forms.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The key point is that meta-narratives are no longer believed. So, in the absence of these big stories, people might focus more on smaller, individual narratives, but the question is about what the dictum means.

Looking at each option:

Option B: Universal values are meaningless. Because if you don't trust the meta-narratives that support universal values, then those values don't hold.

Option G: Promotes acceptance of all narratives. That would be more like saying all are equally valid, which is different from being skeptical of the big ones.

So, I think the correct answer is B: Universal values are meaningless.

Lyotard's statement, "I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives," highlights a skepticism toward grand, overarching narratives that claim universal truth. These meta-narratives often underpin universal values, such as those associated with the Enlightenment or Marxism. When these meta-narratives are doubted, the universal values they support lose their credibility and become meaningless. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because postmodernism does not disregard individual stories; it often emphasizes them over meta-narratives.
- **B** aligns with the idea that universal values, which rely on meta-narratives, become meaningless when these narratives are questioned.
- **C** is unrelated to Lyotard's statement, as it focuses on literature's role in repression, which is not addressed here.
- **D** is incorrect because postmodernism questions objective truth rather than affirming it.
- **E** is irrelevant, as the statement does not discuss the nature of law.
- **F** is incorrect because the distrust is directed at meta-narratives, not individual stories.
- **G** suggests relativism but does not capture the specific skepticism toward meta-narratives.
- **H** is too broad, as postmodernism does not reject all forms of authority, only those tied to meta-narratives.

Thus, the correct interpretation is that universal values are meaningless when meta-narratives are distrusted.
