Question:

A buffer is made from equal concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Doubling the volume of the buffer solution by adding water has what effect on its pH?

Options:

A: It causes the pH to fluctuate unpredictably.
B: It causes the pH to equalize with the water's pH.
C: It causes the pH to become extremely basic.
D: It neutralizes the pH completely.
E: It significantly decreases the pH.
F: It has little effect.
G: It significantly increases the pH.
H: It doubles the pH value.
I: It changes the pH asymptotically to the pKa of the acid.
J: It causes the pH to become extremely acidic.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about buffers and how their pH changes when you dilute them. Hmm, I remember that buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH when you add acids or bases. They're usually made from a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

The question says the buffer is made from equal concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Oh right, when the concentrations are equal, the pH should be equal to the pKa of the acid. Because the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So if [base] = [acid], the log term is zero, and pH = pKa.

Now, the question is about what happens when you double the volume by adding water. I think diluting a buffer affects the concentrations of both the acid and the conjugate base equally. Because when you add water, both will be diluted by the same factor. Let's say initially, the concentrations were both 0.1 M. After doubling the volume, they become 0.05 M each.

Wait, because both are being diluted the same way, the ratio of base to acid remains the same. So in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the [base]/[acid] ratio is still 1, so log(1) is zero. Therefore, the pH should stay the same as before, which was equal to the pKa.

So if that's the case, the pH doesn't change much. It has little effect on the pH. So the correct answer would be the option that says it has little effect.

Looking at the options, option F says "It has little effect." That seems right. The other options don't make sense. For example, options E and G suggest significant changes, but diluting a buffer doesn't change the pH much because the buffer resists changes. Option I says it changes asymptotically to pKa, but the pH was already at pKa before dilution, so it stays there. Options B, C, D, H, J are all about extreme changes which shouldn't happen.

When a buffer is made from equal concentrations of a weak acid and its conjugate base, its pH is equal to the pKa of the acid, as per the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: 

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right).
\]

If \([base] = [acid]\), the ratio \(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\) is 1, and \(\log(1) = 0\), so \(\text{pH} = \text{pKa}\).

When the volume of the buffer is doubled by adding water, both the weak acid and its conjugate base are diluted equally. This means their concentrations decrease by the same factor, but their ratio remains unchanged. Since the ratio \(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\) stays the same, the pH of the buffer remains equal to the pKa of the acid. Therefore, the pH is not significantly affected by this dilution.

Option F, "It has little effect," is correct because the pH remains stable due to the buffer's resistance to pH changes. Other options suggesting extreme or significant changes are incorrect because the buffer's pH remains close to its original value.

Answer: F
