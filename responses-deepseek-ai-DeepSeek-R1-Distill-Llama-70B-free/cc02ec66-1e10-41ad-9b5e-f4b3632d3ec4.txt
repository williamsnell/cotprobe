Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about antithetic variates in Monte Carlo experiments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

So the question lists four statements, i to iv, and I need to pick which ones are correct. The options are combinations of these statements. Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement i: "Antithetic variates work by reducing the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space." Wait, I remember that Monte Carlo methods often involve a lot of simulations because they rely on random sampling. Antithetic variates are a variance reduction technique. They help reduce the variance of the estimates, which means you might need fewer replications to get a precise result. So statement i seems correct.

Statement ii: "Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically." Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. Antithetic variates are about using pairs of random numbers that are mirror images. Like, if you have a random number u, you also use (1-u). These are called antithetic because they're opposites. So the properties of these antithetic variables might be easier to compute because they're related. So maybe statement ii is correct. I think that's right because using them can make the variance calculation easier since their correlation is known.

Statement iii: "Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws." Okay, so if I have a random draw u, the antithetic would be -u? Wait, no, I thought it's 1-u, especially for uniform variables. Because if u is between 0 and 1, then 1-u reflects the other end of the distribution. But negative might not always make sense, especially for variables that are non-negative. So statement iii might be incorrect because it's about using negatives. Or wait, maybe in some cases, like normal distributions, you can take the negative. But for others, like uniform, that's not the case. So perhaps statement iii is not correct as a general rule.

Statement iv: "Antithetic variates involve taking one over each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws." Wait, taking 1/u as the antithetic? That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think that's a common practice. Antithetic is more about symmetry around the mean, not taking reciprocals. So statement iv is probably incorrect.

Now, let's recap:

i) Correct. Antithetic variates help reduce the number of needed replications by reducing variance.

ii) Correct. They use similar variables but with known properties.

iii) Incorrect. It's not about using the negative, but more like 1-u for uniform variables.

iv) Incorrect. Taking reciprocals isn't part of antithetic variates.

So the correct statements are i and ii. Wait, but wait! Let me double-check. Because statement iii: using the negative. Oh wait, maybe in some cases, like for symmetric distributions around zero, using the negative would make sense. So for example, if your variable is normally distributed with mean zero, using -u would be antithetic. But for a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, the antithetic is 1-u, not -u. So statement iii is not universally correct, only applies in certain cases. So if the question is about the general case, statement iii is wrong.

So looking back at the options, which option includes i and ii but not iii and iv? Let's look at the options:

Option A: i, iii, iv → includes iii and iv which I think are wrong.

Option B: ii and iii → includes iii which I think is wrong.

Option C: iii and iv → both wrong.

Option D: i and iv → iv is wrong.

Option E: ii, iii, iv → all except i, but i is correct.

Option F: i, ii, iv → iv is wrong.

Option G: all four → nope.

Option H: i and iii → iii is wrong.

Option I: i, ii, iii → iii is wrong.

Option J: ii and iv → iv is wrong.

Wait, none of the options include just i and ii. So that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement iii.

Wait, maybe statement iii is correct in some way. Let me think again. Antithetic variates can be generated by using mirrored values. For example, in a standard normal distribution, if you generate z, the antithetic would be -z. So in that case, statement iii is correct. But if the variable is from a distribution that doesn't support negative values (like uniform 0-1), then using 1-u is the way to go. So statement iii is correct only in specific cases. But the question is about general statements, so if statement iii says "using the negative of each of the random draws", that's only correct for symmetric distributions around zero. So as a general statement, iii is not always correct.

Hmm, but the question doesn't specify the type of distribution. So, in general, statement iii would not be correct because it depends. So the correct statements are i and ii.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that includes only i and ii. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: i,iii,iv → no.

B: ii,iii → no.

C: iii,iv → no.

D: i,iv → no.

E: ii,iii,iv → no.

F: i,ii,iv → includes iv wrong.

G: all → no.

H: i,iii → no.

I: i,ii,iii → no.

J: ii,iv → no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about statement ii.

Statement ii says: "antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically."

Wait, no, antithetic variates don't use a similar variable. They use transformed versions of the same variable. The idea is to have two variables that are negatively correlated, which reduces variance. So statement ii might be incorrect because they're not a similar variable but transformed versions.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe statement ii is incorrect because I'm not sure about that. Let me try to recall.

No, wait. Antithetic variates are used in the same simulation. For example, if you're simulating a variable X, the antithetic variate would be (for uniform) 1 - X. So the properties of X and 1 - X are related. Since X is uniform, 1-X is also uniform, and their properties are known analytically. So statement ii is correct because the antithetic variate is a similar variable (same distribution) with known properties.

So statements i and ii are correct, iii is sometimes correct but not generally, iv is incorrect.

So the correct statements are i and ii.

But looking back at the options, is there any option that includes i and ii without including any incorrect statements? Let me check:

Looking again, none of the options have only i and ii. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating statement iii.

Wait, statement iii says: "using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws."

Ah, wait! Another approach: In antithetic variates, you pair each random draw with its antithetic counterpart. So for each u, you also use (1 - u). But if the variable is from a symmetric distribution around 0, then the antithetic would be -u.

So, for a standard normal variable, using -u is correct. So statement iii is correct in that context. So perhaps statement iii is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the general case. The statements don't specify the distribution. So statement iii is correct if the underlying variable is symmetric, but not if it's, say, uniform from 0 to 1.

Hmm, so if the question is about whether the statements are correct in general, then statement iii is not universally correct.

Wait, but the question says "concerning the use of antithetic variates". So perhaps in the method, whether you use negative or 1-u depends on the distribution. So statement iii is a possible approach but not the only one. So whether statement iii is correct depends on context.

Wait, perhaps the way statement iii is phrased is incorrect. Statement iii says that you use the negative of each of the random draws. So if the draws are from a distribution that isn't symmetric around zero, this might not be appropriate.

So I think statement iii is not correct in general. Therefore, the correct statements are i and ii.

But looking at the options, none have i and ii alone. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's read the question again. The question is which statements are correct. So perhaps statement iii is correct in some contexts, making it sometimes correct. But if the statement says "involve using the negative...", implying that's the method, then it's not universally correct.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assessment of statement ii is wrong.

Wait, statement ii: "Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically." Hmm, perhaps that's not correct because antithetic variates don't employ a similar variable, but rather a transformed version of the same variable. So perhaps statement ii is incorrect.

If statement ii is incorrect, then only statement i is correct. But looking at the options, none have just i.

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Let me try to think of the correct points about antithetic variates.

Antithetic variates method:

- It's a variance reduction technique.
- For each random number u generated, you also use (1 - u) as its antithetic variate.
- This works because if u is high, (1-u) is low, leading to lower variance when averaged.
- It's particularly useful for simulations where the outcome is monotonic in the random variable. For example, in option pricing, if the option value increases with the underlying asset price, using antithetic variates can help reduce variance.
- It doesn't reduce the number of required replications but reduces the variance, making the estimate more precise with the same number of runs. Wait, no, because with lower variance, you might need fewer runs to achieve a certain precision. So statement i says they reduce the number of replications needed, which is correct.

So regarding the statements:

i) Correct.

ii) Hmm, employing a similar variable whose properties are known. Well, the antithetic variate is a transformation of the original variable. The properties are known because they're based on the same variable. So statement ii is correct. Because you know how u and (1-u) are related.

So statements i and ii are correct.

Now, looking at statement iii: using the negative. As I said, for symmetric distributions (like normal), it's correct. For others, like uniform, it's not. So statement iii is not universally correct, so the statement is incorrect as a general assertion.

Statement iv: taking one over each draw. That doesn't sound right. I don't recall antithetic variates involving reciprocals. So iv is incorrect.

So correct statements: i and ii.

Now, looking at the options, which one includes i and ii?

Looking back:

Option F: i, ii, iv → includes iv which is wrong.

Option I: i, ii, iii → includes iii which is wrong.

Option J: only ii and iv → no.

Wait, none of the options have i and ii alone. But perhaps I'm missing an option.

Wait, let me look again:

Options:

A: i, iii, iv → no.

B: ii and iii → no.

C: iii and iv → no.

D: i and iv → no.

E: ii, iii, iv → no.

F: i, ii, iv → no.

G: all → no.

H: i and iii → no.

I: i, ii, iii → no.

J: ii and iv → no.

Hmm, so none of the options have just i and ii. Did I make a mistake in evaluating something?

Wait, perhaps statement ii is incorrect. Let me think again.

Statement ii: "Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable... but whose properties are known analytically."

Wait, no, because antithetic variates don't employ a different variable; they use a transformed version of the same variable. So perhaps statement ii is incorrect.

If statement ii is incorrect, then only i is correct. But none of the options have only i.

Alternatively, perhaps statement iii is correct in some contexts, making it a correct statement.

Wait, the question is about which statements are correct. So if statement iii is correct in some cases, but not all, then the statement as written is incorrect as a general rule.

Wait, perhaps statement iii is correct when the random variable can take negative values. So for a standard normal variable, yes, taking the negative is correct. But for a uniform variable on (0,1), it's not. So statement iii is conditionally correct, but the question doesn't specify. So as a general statement, it's incorrect.

So, if only statement i is correct, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering what antithetic variates are.

Wait, another approach: The antithetic variate method pairs each random draw u with its antithetic counterpart (like 1-u for uniform). This tends to reduce variance because high and low values are paired. So the method doesn't require knowing the properties of another variable; it's about transforming the same variable.

So statement ii says they involve a similar variable but with known properties. Does that apply? Well, 1-u is a similar variable (same distribution as u for uniform), and their properties are known. So statement ii is correct.

So statements i and ii are correct.

But looking at the options, none of them include just i and ii. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about statement iii.

Wait, perhaps statement iii is correct in some contexts. For example, in a standard normal distribution, using the negative is correct. So in that case, statement iii is correct for some situations.

So perhaps statements i, ii, and iii are correct, but iv is not.

Wait, statement iii is correct only for symmetric distributions, but the question is about general statements. So I'm back to the conclusion that statement iii is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is I (i, ii, iii), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps statement iii is incorrect because it's about using negatives, but the correct approach is to use 1-u for uniform variables.

So, in conclusion, the correct statements are i and ii, but since no option has just i and ii, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that option I is (i, ii, iii), but I think statement iii is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should consider the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: (ii) and (iii) only.

Option I: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.

Wait, perhaps statement iii is correct in some contexts, making it a correct statement in general. For example, in some distributions, using the negative is the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps statement iii is incorrect because it's not about using the negative but about using a transformation that reflects the variable's range. So for variables that can be negative, you can use the negative. For others, like 0 to 1, you use 1-u.

So perhaps statement iii is correct only in specific cases, making the general statement incorrect.

So in the end, the correct statements are i and ii. But the given options don't include i and ii together without others. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps statement i is incorrect. Statement i says that antithetic variates reduce the number of replications needed. But variance reduction techniques like antithetic variates allow you to achieve the same precision with fewer replications. So statement i is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps statement i is incorrect. Because antithetic variates don't reduce the number of replications needed but make the simulation more efficient by reducing variance. Wait, actually, by reducing variance, you can achieve the same accuracy with fewer replications. So statement i is correct.

So I'm back to statements i and ii being correct. But again, the options don't have an option with i and ii only.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.

Option I: (i), (ii), and (iii) → includes iii which I think is incorrect.

Option F: (i), (ii), and (iv) → includes iv which is incorrect.

Option B: (ii) and (iii) → includes iii which I think is incorrect.

Option J: (ii) and (iv) → both incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is E: (ii), (iii), and (iv). But I thought iv is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about what antithetic variates are again.

Antithetic variates method:

- For each random number u, compute the antithetic variate, typically 1-u for uniform variables.
- For variables that can be negative, you might use -u as the antithetic.
- The purpose is to have the variates negatively correlated, which reduces the overall variance of the simulation results.

So statements:

i) Correct. They reduce the number of replications needed by reducing variance.

ii) Correct. Because the antithetic variate is a similar variable (same distribution) with known properties.

iii) Partially correct. It depends on the distribution. For symmetric variables, using -u is correct. But for uniform, it's 1-u. So statement iii is not universally correct, thus incorrect as a general statement.

iv) Incorrect. Taking reciprocals isn't part of antithetic variates.

So only statements i and ii are correct.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that includes iii. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps statement iii is correct. Because in some contexts, using the negative is the right approach. So statement iii is correct in some cases, making the statement correct as a possibility. But the question is about correct statements in general.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is that statements i, ii, and iii are correct, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for another angle. The antithetic variate method involves pairing each random draw with another that is in some way opposite. For a uniform distribution on (0,1), the antithetic is 1-u. For a normal distribution N(0,1), the antithetic is -u. So statement iii is correct for the normal case.

So, in general, statement iii is correct, but only for certain distributions. But the question doesn't specify the distribution, so statement iii is conditionally correct.

Wait, but the question
