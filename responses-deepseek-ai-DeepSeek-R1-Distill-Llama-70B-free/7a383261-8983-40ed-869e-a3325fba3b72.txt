Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about different schools of legal thought, and I need to figure out which one supports the view that a custom becomes law when it's recognized by courts. Hmm, let's break this down.

The question is asking which school says that a custom becomes law when courts give it their stamp of approval. So, I remember that in legal theory, there are several schools, each with different perspectives on what law is and how it's formed.

Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A is the Critical Legal Studies School. From what I recall, CLS is more about criticizing the existing legal system, arguing that law is used to maintain power structures and that it's inherently political. They might not focus so much on customs becoming law through courts.

Option B is Legal Realism. Legal Realists, I think, focus on how the law is actually applied by judges and the practical outcomes of cases. They might emphasize judicial decisions over abstract rules, but I'm not sure if that's exactly about customs becoming law.

Option C is the Historical School. The Historical School, led by people like Savigny, believes that law develops over time based on the history and culture of a people. They might say that customs are part of the organic development of law, but I'm not certain if they require court recognition for it to become law.

Option D is Natural Law School. Natural Law is about higher, universal principles. They'd probably say law is based on morality or nature, not so much on customs being validated by courts.

Option E is Analytical School. I think the Analytical School, also known as Legal Positivism, focuses on the analysis of legal concepts and the structure of law. They might discuss how law is made through official channels, like legislation or court decisions.

Option F is Law and Economics. This school applies economic principles to legal issues, focusing on efficiency and cost-benefit analysis. Not directly related to customs becoming law through courts, I think.

Option G is Sociological School. Sociological Jurisprudence looks at law in society, how it interacts with social structures. They might discuss how customs influence law, but I'm not sure if they require court recognition for it to be law.

Option H is Normative School. Normative theories are about what the law should be, focusing on moral and ethical aspects. They might discuss ideals rather than the process of customs becoming law.

Option I is Feminist Jurisprudence. This perspective critiques law from a feminist viewpoint, examining how it affects women and marginalized groups. Not directly about customs and court recognition.

Option J is Positivist School. Positivists believe that law is a set of rules created by human authorities, like legislatures or courts. They often say that something is law because it's been officially recognized. So if a custom is recognized by courts, it becomes law according to them.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the Analytical School (Option E) being part of Positivism. Let me clarify. The Analytical School is indeed a form of Legal Positivism, which holds that law is based on social facts, like court decisions and statutes. So their view would be that a custom becomes law when it's recognized by the courts because that's the official stamp of approval.

Wait, but the question is about which school supports that view. So is it the Positivist School (J) or another? Because I think Positivists, especially in the tradition of H.L.A. Hart, would say that law is based on social rules, including court decisions. So if a custom is recognized by courts, it becomes part of the law.

Alternatively, the Sociological School (G) might look at how customs influence the law, but they might not require court recognition. The Historical School (C) might see customs as part of the law without needing court approval.

Wait, but the question says "receives the stamp of judicial recognition by courts." So the idea is that the courts' recognition makes it law. That sounds like a positivist approach because positivists emphasize that law is what is declared by official bodies, like courts.

So, between options E and J. Wait, option E is Analytical School, which is a type of Positivism. So perhaps both E and J could be correct, but looking at the options, J is Positivist School, and E is Analytical.

Wait, the Positivist School (J) is broader and includes the Analytical approach. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

But wait, another angle: the Historical School (C) believes that law grows out of the people's customs and traditions. They might say that customs are law because they're part of the culture, regardless of court recognition. So they might not require judicial stamp.

The Sociological School (G) might see law as part of society's norms, so again, maybe not requiring court recognition.

Therefore, the school that requires court recognition is the Positivist School, which is option J.

The question asks which school of legal thought supports the view that a custom becomes law when it receives judicial recognition by courts. To determine the correct answer, it is important to analyze the key perspectives of each school:

- **Critical Legal Studies School (A):** Focuses on critiquing the legal system as a tool of power, not on customs becoming law through court recognition.  
- **Legal Realism School (B):** Emphasizes how law is applied by judges in practice but does not specifically address customs becoming law through court recognition.  
- **Historical School (C):** Views law as evolving from a people's history and culture but does not necessarily require court recognition for customs to become law.  
- **Natural Law School (D):** Grounds law in universal moral principles rather than customs or judicial decisions.  
- **Analytical School (E):** Part of Legal Positivism, focusing on legal concepts and structure. While related, the broader Positivist School (J) is more directly aligned with the idea that court recognition makes customs law.  
- **Law and Economics School (F):** Applies economic principles to legal issues, unrelated to the question.  
- **Sociological School (G):** Examines law in its social context but does not emphasize court recognition as a requirement for customs to become law.  
- **Normative School (H):** Focuses on what law should be, based on moral and ethical considerations, rather than the process of customs becoming law.  
- **Feminist Jurisprudence School (I):** Critiques law from a feminist perspective, not relevant to the question.  
- **Positivist School (J):** Holds that law is derived from human authorities, such as courts and legislatures. This school explicitly supports the view that customs become law when recognized by courts, as court decisions are a key source of legal validity.

Given the emphasis on judicial recognition as the mechanism by which customs become law, the **Positivist School (J)** is the correct answer. While the Analytical School (E) is related, the broader Positivist School more directly aligns with the question.

Answer: J
