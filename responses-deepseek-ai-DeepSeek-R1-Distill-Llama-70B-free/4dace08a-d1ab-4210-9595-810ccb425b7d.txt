Question:

William Safire in American Heritage Magazine (December 1987): ...The greatness of Lincoln was his purposefulness. He saw something that few others saw: that the democratic experiment centered on the Union and that majority rule was everything. The minute you allowed secession, you made democracy an absurdity---because what would happen would be continued subdivision.

Options:

A: Questionable Analogy
B: Red Herring
C: Appeal to Ignorance
D: Appeal to Authority
E: Ad Hominem
F: Slippery Slope
G: Circular Argument
H: False Dilemma
I: Straw Man
J: Hasty Generalization

Okay, so I've got this question about a quote from William Safire discussing Lincoln's greatness. The question is asking which logical fallacy or rhetorical device is being used here. The options are from A to J, each representing different fallacies or devices.

First, I need to understand the context of the quote. Safire is talking about Lincoln's belief in the importance of the Union and majority rule. He argues that allowing secession would make democracy absurd because it would lead to continued subdivision, implying a slippery slope where allowing one secession would lead to more and more divisions, destabilizing the democracy.

Now, looking at the options, I'm trying to match each one to what's happening in the quote.

Option A: Questionable Analogy. I'm not sure if there's an analogy here. Safire is making a causal argument, not comparing two things directly.

Option B: Red Herring. That's when someone introduces an unrelated topic to divert attention. Doesn't seem to fit because he's talking about the direct consequences of secession.

Option C: Appeal to Ignorance. This is when someone argues that because something isn't proven false, it's true. Safire isn't doing that here.

Option D: Appeal to Authority. He's quoting Lincoln, but he's using Lincoln's opinion to support his argument. Wait, but the question is about the type of argument, not citing an authority. Hmm, maybe not the best fit.

Option E: Ad Hominem. Attacks the person, not the argument. Safire is praising Lincoln, so that's not it.

Option F: Slippery Slope. This is when an argument suggests that a relatively small first step will lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant effect. Safire is saying that allowing secession would lead to more subdivisions, which fits this description.

Option G: Circular Argument. That's when the argument uses what it's trying to prove as part of the premise. Not the case here.

Option H: False Dilemma. Presenting only two options when more are available. He's arguing against secession leading to subdivisions, but I don't see a false either/or setup.

Option I: Straw Man. Misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack. Doesn't apply here since he's stating his own argument.

Option J: Hasty Generalization. Making a broad conclusion from limited evidence. He's making a general statement about the consequences of secession, but it's more about a chain of events than a generalization from specific instances.

Putting it all together, the argument is that allowing secession would lead to a series of negative events (continued subdivision), which is a classic slippery slope argument. So the correct answer should be F.

The quote discusses Lincoln's belief in the Union and majority rule, arguing that allowing secession would lead to further subdivisions, making democracy unstable. This is an example of a slippery slope argument, where a small action is claimed to lead to significant negative consequences.

Answer: F
