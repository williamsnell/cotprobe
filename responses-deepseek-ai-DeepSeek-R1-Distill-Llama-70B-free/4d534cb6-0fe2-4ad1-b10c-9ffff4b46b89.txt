Okay, so I have this problem here about a sequence defined by x₁ = 2 and x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/(1 + x_n). The question is asking, if the sequence converges, what its limit would be in decimals, and there are multiple-choice options provided.

Hmm, I remember that when a sequence converges, the limit should satisfy the same recursive relation as the sequence itself. So if the sequence approaches a limit L, then both x_n and x_{n+1} approach L. So I can set up an equation using that idea.

Let me write that down. If x_n approaches L, then x_{n+1} also approaches L. According to the recursive formula, x_{n+1} is 1 plus 1 divided by (1 + x_n). So substituting L into both sides, I get L = 1 + 1/(1 + L).

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check. Oh, no, wait—right, x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/(1 + x_n), so when n approaches infinity, x_{n} is L, so substituting gives L equals 1 plus 1 over (1 plus L). Yeah, that's correct.

So now I have the equation L = 1 + 1/(1 + L). I need to solve this for L. Let me rewrite that equation step by step.

First, subtract 1 from both sides to get L - 1 = 1/(1 + L). Then, take reciprocals of both sides. Wait, no, maybe it's better to multiply both sides by (1 + L) to eliminate the denominator.

So, multiply both sides by (1 + L):

L*(1 + L) = 1*(1 + L) + 1? Wait, wait, no. Let me do that again. Starting from L = 1 + [1/(1 + L)].

So, L - 1 = 1/(1 + L). Then, multiply both sides by (1 + L):

(L - 1)(1 + L) = 1.

Expanding the left side: (L -1)(L +1) is L^2 - 1. So:

L^2 - 1 = 1.

Then, bring the 1 to the left side: L^2 - 2 = 0.

So L^2 = 2, which leads to L = sqrt(2) or L = -sqrt(2). But wait, the initial term x₁ is 2, and looking at the recursive formula, each term is positive because 1/(1 + x_n) is positive since x_n is positive. So the limit must be positive. Therefore, L = sqrt(2).

Wait, sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, right? Let me check the options. Option B is 1.414, which matches sqrt(2). But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 2.235, which is close to sqrt(5), but I'm getting sqrt(2).

Wait, did I make a mistake in setting up the equation? Let me go through this again.

The recursion is x_{n+1} = 1 + 1/(1 + x_n). So assuming x_n approaches L, then x_{n+1} approaches L as well. So L = 1 + 1/(1 + L).

So L = 1 + [1/(1 + L)]. Let me solve this again.

Multiply both sides by (1 + L):

L*(1 + L) = (1 + L) * [1 + 1/(1 + L)]? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when I have L = 1 + 1/(1 + L), I can subtract 1 from both sides:

L - 1 = 1/(1 + L).

Then, take reciprocal: 1/(L - 1) = 1 + L.

Wait, no, taking reciprocal isn't the right approach because it's not an equation like A = B; taking reciprocal would change things. Let me instead cross multiply.

So from L - 1 = 1/(1 + L), cross-multiplying:

(L - 1)(1 + L) = 1.

Which gives L^2 - 1 = 1, so L^2 = 2, so L = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.

But wait, let me plug this value back into the original equation to check.

Left side: L = 1.414.

Right side: 1 + 1/(1 + 1.414) = 1 + 1/(2.414). What's 1/2.414? Approximately 0.414. So 1 + 0.414 = 1.414, which equals L. So that seems correct.

So the limit is sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414, option B.

Wait a minute, but wait. Let me think about the sequence's behavior. The initial term is 2. Let's compute the next few terms to see if it's approaching 1.414.

x₁ = 2.

x₂ = 1 + 1/(1 + 2) = 1 + 1/3 ≈ 1.333.

x₃ = 1 + 1/(1 + 1.333) = 1 + 1/2.333 ≈ 1 + 0.4286 ≈ 1.4286.

x₄ = 1 + 1/(1 + 1.4286) = 1 + 1/2.4286 ≈ 1 + 0.4118 ≈ 1.4118.

x₅ = 1 + 1/(1 + 1.4118) ≈ 1 + 1/2.4118 ≈ 1 + 0.4147 ≈ 1.4147.

x₆ = 1 + 1/(1 + 1.4147) ≈ 1 + 1/2.4147 ≈ 1 + 0.4142 ≈ 1.4142.

Hmm, it's oscillating around 1.414, getting closer each time. So that's consistent with the limit being sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414.

Looking back at the options, option B is 1.414, which is sqrt(2). So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when solving for fixed points, there might be more than one solution, but in this case, the other solution is negative, which doesn't make sense here since all terms are positive.

So yeah, I'm confident the correct answer is B, 1.414.

To determine the limit of the sequence \((x_n)\) defined by \(x_1 = 2\) and \(x_{n+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + x_n}\), we assume the sequence converges to a limit \(L\). If the sequence converges, then both \(x_n\) and \(x_{n+1}\) approach \(L\). Substituting \(L\) into the recursive formula gives:

\[
L = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + L}.
\]

To solve for \(L\), subtract 1 from both sides:

\[
L - 1 = \frac{1}{1 + L}.
\]

Next, multiply both sides by \(1 + L\) to eliminate the denominator:

\[
(L - 1)(1 + L) = 1.
\]

Expanding the left-hand side:

\[
L^2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
L^2 = 2.
\]

Thus, \(L = \sqrt{2}\) or \(L = -\sqrt{2}\). Since all terms of the sequence are positive, the limit must also be positive. Therefore, \(L = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\).

To verify, we compute the first few terms of the sequence:

- \(x_1 = 2\),
- \(x_2 = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + 2} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} \approx 1.333\),
- \(x_3 = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + 1.333} \approx 1.4286\),
- \(x_4 = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + 1.4286} \approx 1.4118\),
- \(x_5 = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + 1.4118} \approx 1.4147\),
- \(x_6 = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + 1.4147} \approx 1.4142\).

The sequence converges to approximately \(1.414\), which matches \(\sqrt{2}\). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: 1.414**.
