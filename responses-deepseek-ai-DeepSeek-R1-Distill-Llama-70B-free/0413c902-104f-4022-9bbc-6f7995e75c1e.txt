Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about Thomas Aquinas and self-evident propositions. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but let me think this through.

So the question is asking which of the options is NOT an example Aquinas gives of a self-evident proposition. The options are from A to J. I remember that Aquinas talked about different types of propositions, especially in the context of theology and philosophy.

Self-evident propositions are those that are known to be true by understanding the meaning of the terms involved. Like, for example, "All bachelors are unmarried" is self-evident because once you know what a bachelor is, you know the statement is true without needing proof.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "Man is a rational being." Hmm, I think Aquinas would consider this more of a factual statement rather than self-evident. It's something that might require demonstration, like through observation or reasoning about human nature.

Option B: "All bachelors are unmarried." That's a classic example of a self-evident proposition. The predicate is contained within the definition of the subject. So B is definitely an example Aquinas would use.

Option C: "Night follows day." Wait, this seems more like an empirical fact based on observation. It's not something you can deduce just by understanding the terms. So this might not be a self-evident proposition according to Aquinas.

Option D: "The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees." This is a geometric truth, but I think it's not self-evident. You have to prove it, like in Euclidean geometry. So D is probably not a self-evident proposition.

Option E: "The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time." That sounds like the law of non-contradiction, which is a fundamental logical principle. I'm pretty sure Aquinas would consider this self-evident.

Option F: "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us." This looks like a quote from the Bible, maybe Psalm 4. It's a theological statement, not a logical or philosophical proposition. So Aquinas wouldn't list this as a self-evident proposition in his philosophical works.

Option G: "A square has four sides." This is self-evident because the definition of a square includes having four sides. So G is an example.

Option H: "Every whole is greater than its part." This is a metaphysical principle that Aquinas would probably consider self-evident once understood.

Option I: "Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another." That's the transitive property of equality, a self-evident axiom in mathematics.

Option J: "An effect depends on its cause." This is a fundamental principle in causality, which Aquinas would likely consider self-evident.

So, the question is to pick the option that's NOT an example. Let's recap:

The non-examples would be statements that require proof or are empirical. So looking at the options, I think both C and D and maybe F are not self-evident. Wait, the options given are A to J, and the question is which is NOT an example.

Let me think again. "Man is a rational being." Is that self-evident? Or does it require proof? I think Aquinas would say it's a matter of natural knowledge, but perhaps not self-evident. Or maybe it's considered self-evident in a certain context.

Wait, but I remember that Aquinas in his works, like the Summa Theologiae, when discussing the nature of man, he would say that certain things are known through revelation or through reasoning. The proposition "Man is a rational being" is more of a definitional statement, but I'm not sure if he considered it self-evident or if it requires some reasoning to establish.

Wait, another approach: self-evident propositions are either those that are known in themselves (per se nota) or those known through experience. So, for example, "Man is a rational being" might be known through experience or demonstration, so it's not self-evident.

Alternatively, "All bachelors are unmarried" is per se nota because it's true by definition.

So looking at the options, which ones are not self-evident. Let's list which are self-evident:

B: Yes.

E: Yes.

G: Yes.

H: Yes.

I: Yes.

J: Yes.

D: No, because it's a mathematical truth that needs proof.

C: No, it's an empirical observation.

F: No, it's a theological statement, not a logical proposition.

A: Maybe no, because it's more of a factual statement.

The question is which is NOT an example. So the options that are not self-evident are A, C, D, F.

Now, the question is which one is the correct answer. The options given are A to J.

Wait, the question is which is NOT an example. So the correct answer should be the one that Aquinas does NOT give as a self-evident proposition.

Looking back, the options: I think option C is "Night follows day." That's more of an observed fact, not self-evident.

Option F is a religious statement, not a philosophical proposition.

Option A: "Man is a rational being." I'm not sure. Maybe Aquinas would consider this self-evident because it's part of the definition of man. Or perhaps he would say it's known through reasoning, not self-evident.

Wait, in the Summa Theologiae, Aquinas argues about the nature of man, and that we know man is rational through observation of his actions, not as a self-evident proposition.

So perhaps A is not self-evident. Or maybe he does consider it self-evident.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C or D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about each option again.

Self-evident propositions are those where the predicate is included in the concept of the subject. So "All bachelors are unmarried" fits because 'unmarried' is part of what 'bachelor' means.

Similarly, "A square has four sides" is self-evident.

"Every whole is greater than its part" is a principle that Aquinas would accept as self-evident.

"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another" is an axiom, so self-evident.

"An effect depends on its cause" is a principle of causality, which is considered self-evident.

"The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time" is the law of non-contradiction, which is fundamental and self-evident.

So B, E, G, H, I, J are all self-evident.

Now, the others: A, C, D, F.

"Man is a rational being." Is this self-evident? Or does it require proof? I think Aquinas would say that it's not self-evident to everyone, but perhaps it's self-evident in the sense that once you understand human nature, it becomes clear. Or maybe it's a matter of natural knowledge but not self-evident. So perhaps A is not considered self-evident by Aquinas.

"Night follows day." That's more of an empirical fact based on the Earth's rotation. It's not something you can know just by understanding the terms; it's observed. So C is not self-evident.

"The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees." This is a mathematical truth that is proven, not self-evident, so D is not self-evident.

Option F is a theological statement, not a logical or philosophical proposition, so it's not an example of a self-evident proposition in Aquinas's philosophy.

The question is to choose which one is NOT an example. So which of these is the correct answer.

Looking back at the question, the options are A through J. The question asks which is not an example Aquinas gives.

I think the answer is either C or F.

Wait, the options are:

A: "Man is a rational being." Possibly not self-evident.

B: Definitely self-evident.

C: "Night follows day." Not self-evident.

D: Mathematical, not self-evident.

E: Self-evident.

F: Theological, not a proposition in this context.

G: Self-evident.

H: Self-evident.

I: Self-evident.

J: Self-evident.

So the options that are not self-evident are A, C, D, F.

The question is which is not an example. So the correct answer would be one of these.

Now, I need to recall if Aquinas ever gave "Man is a rational being" as a self-evident proposition.

Wait, in Aquinas's thought, certain truths are self-evident, like the existence of God is not self-evident to us, but some truths about God are. But about man, perhaps he would say that "Man is a rational being" is known through observation, not self-evident.

Alternatively, perhaps "Man is a rational being" is considered self-evident because it's part of the definition of man. So I'm a bit torn on A.

But looking at the options, the one that stands out as not self-evident is "Night follows day." That's an empirical fact, not a self-evident proposition. So option C.

Wait, but option F is a quote from the Bible, so it's not a proposition in the logical sense. So F is also not a self-evident proposition in Aquinas's examples.

So between C and F.

The question is which is not an example. I think the answer is F because it's a theological statement, not a logical proposition. Alternatively, C is an empirical fact.

Wait, but the question is about self-evident propositions, which are logical in nature. So F is a statement of faith, not a proposition in logic or philosophy, so it's not an example.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, which is a factual statement.

Wait, another approach: in Aquinas's works, he gives examples of self-evident propositions. For example, in the Summa Theologica, he discusses the first principles of demonstration. He says that some things are self-evident to all, like "the same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time." Others are self-evident to the wise, but not to everyone.

So which of the options are not self-evident. Let's go through each:

A: "Man is a rational being." I think Aquinas would consider this as something that can be known through natural reason, but I'm not sure if it's self-evident. It might require some reasoning to establish.

B: Definitely self-evident.

C: Empirical, not self-evident.

D: Mathematical, needs proof.

E: Self-evident.

F: Theological, not a logical proposition.

G: Self-evident.

H: Self-evident.

I: Self-evident.

J: Self-evident.

So the options that are not self-evident are A, C, D, F.

The question is which one is not an example.

Now, I think the answer is either C or F.

Wait, the question is which is not an example Aquinas gives. So if Aquinas gives F as an example, then F is not the answer. But F is a quote from Psalms, so it's a statement of faith, not a self-evident proposition in philosophy.

So F is not an example of a self-evident proposition.

Alternatively, C is "Night follows day." That's a statement about the natural world, which is known through sense experience, not through self-evidence.

So which one is the correct answer?

I think the correct answer is C: "Night follows day."

Because it's an empirical fact, not a self-evident proposition. While F is a religious statement, not a proposition in the logical sense.

Wait, but the question is about self-evident propositions. So F is not a proposition in that context. So F would not be an example.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should look for the most obvious non-self-evident proposition.

Let me think about it again. Self-evident propositions are those where the truth is evident from the terms themselves.

So "All bachelors are unmarried" is self-evident.

"Every whole is greater than its part" is self-evident.

"The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time" is self-evident.

"A square has four sides" is self-evident.

"Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another" is self-evident.

"An effect depends on its cause" is self-evident.

Now, "Man is a rational being" may be considered self-evident in a certain context, but perhaps not universally. It might require some reasoning to establish, so maybe it's not considered self-evident by Aquinas.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps "The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees" is a mathematical truth that needs to be proven, so it's not self-evident.

But the question is which is not an example, so the correct answer would be the option that is not self-evident.

Wait, the option that is not self-evident is either C or D or F.

I think D is a mathematical statement that requires proof, so it's not self-evident.

But the question is which is NOT an example, so perhaps D is the answer.

Wait, no, because the options are about which Aquinas gives as an example. So if Aquinas used D as an example, then it's not the answer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that the answer is G, but no, G is self-evident.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because it's a quote from Scripture, not a logical proposition.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The most likely answer is C: "Night follows day." Because it's an empirical fact, not a self-evident proposition.

So I'll go with C.
</think>

To determine which option is not an example of a self-evident proposition according to Aquinas, we analyze each option in light of the concept of self-evident propositions. Self-evident propositions are those whose truth is evident from the understanding of the terms themselves, without requiring external proof or demonstration. Let us evaluate each option:

- **A: "Man is a rational being."** This could be considered a factual or definitional statement, but Aquinas might not classify it as self-evident, as it may require reasoning or observation to establish. It is less clear whether Aquinas would include this as self-evident.

- **B: "All bachelors are unmarried."** This is a classic example of a self-evident proposition, as the predicate ("unmarried") is contained within the definition of the subject ("bachelor"). Aquinas would likely accept this as self-evident.

- **C: "Night follows day."** This is an empirical fact based on observation of the natural world. It is not self-evident because its truth depends on sensory experience rather than the meaning of the terms involved.

- **D: "The sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees."** This is a mathematical truth that requires proof or demonstration. It is not self-evident.

- **E: "The same thing cannot be affirmed and denied at the same time."** This is the law of non-contradiction, a fundamental logical principle that Aquinas would consider self-evident.

- **F: "The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us."** This is a theological statement from Scripture (Psalm 4:6-7) and not a logical or philosophical proposition. It is not an example of a self-evident proposition in Aquinas's philosophical framework.

- **G: "A square has four sides."** This is self-evident because the definition of a square includes having four sides.

- **H: "Every whole is greater than its part."** This is a metaphysical principle that Aquinas would likely consider self-evident.

- **I: "Things equal to one and the same are equal to one another."** This is the transitive property of equality, an axiom in mathematics that is self-evident.

- **J: "An effect depends on its cause."** This is a fundamental principle of causality that Aquinas would consider self-evident.

From this analysis, the options that are not self-evident are **A, C, D, and F**. Among these, **C: "Night follows day"** stands out as the most clearly empirical and not self-evident, as its truth depends on observation rather than the meaning of the terms. While **F** is a theological statement and not a philosophical proposition, **C** is the stronger candidate for the answer because it is a factual statement that is not self-evident in the philosophical sense.

**Answer: C**
