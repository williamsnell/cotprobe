Okay, so I've got this question about quasi-experimental designs versus true experimental designs. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that experimental designs have something to do with how participants are assigned to groups. Let me think.

Wait, true experiments usually involve random assignment, right? Like, the researcher randomly puts people into either the experimental group or the control group. That way, any differences between the groups are probably because of the treatment they received. But what about quasi-experiments?

Oh right, quasi-experiments are when you can't randomly assign participants. Maybe because of ethical reasons or practical limitations. For example, if you're studying the effect of a new teaching method, you can't just randomly assign students to different classes because the school might already have them in specific classes. So in that case, you might compare two existing groups where one uses the new method and the other doesn't.

So the key difference is random assignment. True experiments have it, quasi-experiments don't. Let me look at the options. The question is asking what distinguishes them.

Option G says random assignment, which is a feature of true experiments. So if the question is about what distinguishes quasi from true, then the answer would be that quasi doesn't have random assignment. But the question's phrasing is a bit tricky. It asks on the basis of whether there is... So it's about what true experiments have that quasi don't.

Wait, the question is about the distinction. So the correct answer is that true experiments have random assignment, whereas quasi do not. So the distinguishing factor is the presence or absence of random assignment.

Looking at the options again, option G is random assignment, which is present in true experiments. So the question is asking what makes quasi-experimental designs different, so the answer would be that they don't have random assignment, but which option reflects that.

Wait, the question says: "on the basis of whether there is..." So maybe it's about whether random assignment is present.

So the correct answer would be G: random assignment of participants to groups. Because true experiments have it, and quasi don't. So the distinguishing factor is the presence of random assignment.

The distinguishing factor between quasi-experimental designs and true experimental designs is the presence or absence of random assignment. True experimental designs involve random assignment of participants to groups, ensuring that any differences between groups can be attributed to the treatment. In contrast, quasi-experimental designs lack random assignment, often due to ethical or practical constraints, and instead use existing groups or non-random selection methods. Therefore, the key difference lies in whether random assignment is utilized.

The correct answer is:

G: random assignment of participants to groups

Answer: G
