Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm supposed to find the value of π times x₁ squared. Let's see what the question says. 

The sequence xₙ satisfies xₙ multiplied by x_{n+1} equals n for all n ≥ 1. Also, the limit as n approaches infinity of (xₙ / x_{n+1}) is 1. My task is to find πx₁², and the options are given as A to J.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. So, for each n, xₙ * x_{n+1} = n. That's a recursive relation. And the limit condition says that as n gets really large, the ratio of consecutive terms approaches 1. So xₙ and x_{n+1} become very similar in the limit.

I think I should find a general expression for xₙ, or at least find x₁. Once I have x₁, I can compute π times x₁ squared.

Let me think about the recursion. We have xₙ * x_{n+1} = n. Maybe I can express x_{n+1} in terms of xₙ. So, x_{n+1} = n / xₙ.

Wait, perhaps I can find a pattern by writing out the first few terms. Let's see:

We know x₁ * x₂ = 1 (since n=1). So x₂ = 1/x₁.

Then x₂ * x₃ = 2, so x₃ = 2/x₂ = 2/(1/x₁) )= 2x₁.

Similarly, x₃ * x₄ =3 → x₄=3/x₃=3/(2x₁).

x₄ * x₅=4 → x₅=4/(3/(2x₁)) )= (4 * 2x₁)/3 = 8x₁/3.

Hmm, let's list these out:

x₁ = x₁

x₂ = 1/x₁

x₃ = 2x₁

x₄ = 3/(2x₁)

x₅ = 8x₁/3

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see if we can find a general expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence alternates between terms involving x₁ and terms not. Let me think about the product of x₁ and x₂, then x₃ and x₄, etc.

Wait, for even and odd terms. Let's try to find a general formula for x_{2k-1} and x_{2k}.

Looking at the terms:

x₁ = x₁

x₂ = 1/x₁

x₃ = 2x₁

x₄ = 3/(2x₁)

x₅ = (8/3)x₁

x₆ = 5/( (8/3)x₁ ) = (15)/(8x₁ )

Hmm, looking at x₁, x₃, x₅: x₁, 2x₁, (8/3)x₁. Wait, 2 is 2, 8/3 is approx 2.666. Not sure I see a pattern there.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product of terms two at a time. Like, x₁x₂=1, x₃x₄=3, x₅x₆=5, etc. So for each k, x_{2k-1} * x_{2k} = 2k-1.

Wait, wait. Let me check:

n=1: x₁x₂=1 → 1.

n=2: x₂x₃=2 → 2.

n=3: x₃x₄=3 →3.

n=4: x₄x₅=4 →4.

So for any n, xₙx_{n+1}=n.

That's given, so perhaps it's useful to consider the product of even and odd terms.

Wait, perhaps considering the ratio of x_{n+1} to xₙ. The limit as n approaches infinity of xₙ/x_{n+1} is 1. So in the limit, x_{n} ≈ x_{n+1}.

But according to the recursion, x_{n} x_{n+1} =n. So if x_{n} ≈x_{n+1}, then x_{n}² ≈n. So x_{n} ≈ sqrt(n).

Wait, but then x_{n+1} ≈ sqrt(n), but x_{n+1} should be sqrt(n+1). Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps more accurately, as n becomes large, x_{n} approaches sqrt(n). But let's see.

Wait, if x_{n} x_{n+1} =n, and x_{n} ≈x_{n+1} (since the ratio approaches 1), then x_{n}^2 ≈n, so x_{n}≈sqrt(n). But then x_{n+1}≈ sqrt(n+1). So the ratio x_{n}/x_{n+1} would be sqrt(n)/sqrt(n+1) )= sqrt( n/(n+1) ) ≈1 - 1/(2n) for large n. So the limit as n approaches infinity is indeed 1, which fits the condition.

So, the leading behavior is that x_n is approximately sqrt(n) for large n.

But we need to find x₁. So perhaps the general term can be expressed in terms of x₁, and using the leading behavior, we can solve for x₁.

Alternatively, maybe the sequence can be expressed in terms of factorials or double factorials, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: Maybe write the product of terms in the sequence.

Let me try to write the product from n=1 to N of x_n x_{n+1} = product from n=1 to N of n. So product x_n x_{n+1} = N! .

But wait, x_n x_{n+1} =n, so the product from n=1 to N of x_n x_{n+1} } = product from n=1 to N of n = N! .

But the product can be rearranged as (x₁ x₂)(x₂ x₃)(x₃ x₄)...(x_N x_{N+1}) )= (x₁ x_{N+1}) (x₂ x₃ ...x_N )^2 )= N! ?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the product of x_n from n=1 to N and the product of x_{n+1} from n=1 to N.

Wait, the product from n=1 to N of x_n x_{n+1} = product x_n * product x_{n+1} }= [product x_n from 1 to N] [product x_{n} from 2 to N+1} ].

So, that's (x₁ x₂ ...x_N) (x₂ x₃ ...x_{N+1} ) )= x₁ x_{N+1} (x₂ x₃ ...x_N )^2 ) = product.

But this is equal to N! as per the given condition.

So, [x₁ x_{N+1} (product x₂ to x_N )^2 ] = N! .

Hmm. Not sure if this is helpful yet.

Alternatively, perhaps taking the product up to N terms and then take the square root or something. But perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach. Let's try to express x_{n} in terms of x_{n-2}, or something.

Wait, perhaps for even and odd terms. Let me think about it.

From the recursion, x_{n} x_{n+1} =n.

So, x_{n+1} = n /x_n.

Similarly, x_{n} = (n-1)/x_{n-1}.

Wait, substituting this into the expression for x_{n+1}, we get x_{n+1}=n/( (n-1)/x_{n-1} ) )= n x_{n-1}/(n-1).

So, x_{n+1} = (n/(n-1)) x_{n-1}.

Hmm, this is a recursive relation for x_{n+1} in terms of x_{n-1}.

This suggests that the even and odd terms form separate sequences.

For example, let's look at the odd terms. Let me define y_k =x_{2k-1}.

Similarly, for even terms, z_k =x_{2k}.

Then, perhaps we can write a recursion for y_k.

From above, x_{n+1} = (n/(n-1)) x_{n-1}.

So, for n=2k, x_{2k+1} = (2k/(2k-1)) x_{2k-1}.

Which gives y_{k+1} = (2k/(2k-1)) y_k.

Similarly, for the even terms, let's see.

From x_{n} x_{n+1}=n.

For n=2k-1, x_{2k-1} x_{2k} =2k-1.

But x_{2k} = z_k, and x_{2k-1}= y_k.

So, y_k z_k = 2k-1.

Similarly, for n=2k, x_{2k} x_{2k+1} }=2k.

So, z_k y_{k+1} = 2k.

But from earlier, y_{k+1} = (2k/(2k-1)) y_k.

So substituting, z_k * (2k/(2k-1)) y_k = 2k.

Simplify: z_k y_k (2k)/(2k-1) )= 2k.

Divide both sides by 2k: z_k y_k / (2k-1) )=1.

But from earlier, y_k z_k = 2k-1.

So substituting, (2k-1)/(2k-1) )=1, which holds. So consistency check passed.

But perhaps we can find a general expression for y_k.

We have y_{k+1} = (2k/(2k-1)) y_k.

This is a recursion where each term is a multiple of the previous term. So, perhaps we can express y_k as a product.

Let me write the recursion as y_{k} = y_1 * product_{m=1}^{k-1} (2m/(2m-1)) ).

Wait, because each step, y_{k} = (2(k-1)/(2(k-1)-1)) ) y_{k-1}.

So y_{k} = y_1 multiplied by product from m=1 to k-1 of [2m/(2m-1)].

Similarly, for the even terms, perhaps z_k can be expressed in terms of y_k.

But maybe it's easier to focus on the y sequence for now.

So, y_k = y_1 * product_{m=1}^{k-1} [2m/(2m-1)].

But what is y_1? y_1 is x_1, right? Because y_1 =x_{2*1-1}=x₁.

So, y_k =x₁ * product_{m=1}^{k-1} [2m/(2m-1)].

Hmm. Let's compute this product. It's a telescoping product perhaps.

Wait, product_{m=1}^{k-1} [2m/(2m-1)] = [2/(1)] * [4/3] * [6/5] * ... * [2(k-1)/(2(k-1)-1)].

Which can be written as [2*4*6*...*2(k-1)] / [1*3*5*...*(2k-3)].

The numerator is 2^{k-1} (k-1)!.

The denominator is the product of the first (k-1) odd numbers. Hmm, which is (2k-2)! )/( 2^{k-1} (k-1)! )). Wait, because the product of the first m odd numbers is (2m)! )/( 2^m m! ). Let me see:

Wait, for example, product of first 2 odd numbers:1*3=3. (2*2)! )/(2^2 2! )=24/(4*2)=24/8=3. Yes.

Similarly, product of first 3 odds:1*3*5=15. (6! )/(2^3 3! )=720/(8*6)=720/48=15. Correct.

So, the denominator is (2(k-1))! )/( 2^{k-1} (k-1)! ).

So, the product becomes [2^{k-1} (k-1)! ] / [ (2(k-1))! )/( 2^{k-1} (k-1)! ) ) ].

Wait, that's [2^{k-1} (k-1)! ] * [2^{k-1} (k-1)! ) / (2(k-1))! ) ].

So, this becomes [2^{2(k-1)} ( (k-1)! )^2 ) ] / (2(k-1))! )

But (2(k-1))! ) = (2k-2)!.

So, the product is [2^{2(k-1)} ( (k-1)! )^2 ) ] / (2k-2)! ).

So, putting it all together, y_k =x₁ * [2^{2(k-1)} ( (k-1)! )^2 ) ] / (2k-2)! ).

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simplification here.

Wait, perhaps using the double factorial notation. Alternatively, maybe Stirling's approximation could help, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for large k, y_k behaves in a certain way, and using the limit condition, we can find x₁.

Given that the limit as n approaches infinity of x_n /x_{n+1} is 1, which implies that for large k, y_k ≈ y_{k+1}.

Wait, y_{k} and y_{k+1} are terms in the odd positions. So perhaps for large k, y_{k} ≈ y_{k+1}.

But from the recursion, y_{k+1} = [2k/(2k-1)] y_k.

So, if y_{k} ≈ y_{k+1}, then [2k/(2k-1)] y_k ≈ y_{k}.

Which would imply that 2k/(2k-1) ≈1, which is true as k becomes large.

But perhaps more importantly, the ratio y_{k+1}/y_k = 2k/(2k-1) →1 as k→∞.

Now, perhaps considering the behavior for large k, and using the approximation that y_k ≈ sqrt(2k-1), based on the earlier thought that x_n ≈ sqrt(n). Wait, but let me check that.

Wait, for large k, y_k is x_{2k-1}.

If x_n ≈ sqrt(n), then y_k = x_{2k-1} ≈ sqrt(2k-1).

Similarly, the recursion y_{k+1} = [2k/(2k-1)] y_k.

If y_k ≈ sqrt(2k-1), then y_{k+1} ≈ sqrt(2k+1).

So, substituting into the recursion: sqrt(2k+1) ≈ [2k/(2k-1)] * sqrt(2k-1).

Simplify the RHS: [2k/(2k-1)] * sqrt(2k-1) )= 2k * sqrt(2k-1) / (2k-1) )= 2k / sqrt(2k-1).

So, comparing to LHS sqrt(2k+1):

sqrt(2k+1) ≈ 2k / sqrt(2k-1).

Square both sides:

(2k+1) ≈ (4k²) / (2k-1).

Multiply both sides by (2k-1):

(2k+1)(2k-1) ≈4k².

Left side: (2k)^2 -1^2=4k² -1.

So, 4k² -1 ≈4k² → which holds in the leading order.

So, the approximation y_k ≈ sqrt(2k-1) is consistent with the recursion and the limit condition.

Therefore, for large k, y_k ≈ sqrt(2k-1).

Now, from the expression we have for y_k:

y_k = x₁ * [2^{2(k-1)} ( (k-1)! )^2 ] / (2k-2)! )

We can take the ratio y_k / sqrt(2k-1) and see what x₁ should be to make this ratio approach 1 as k→infty.

So,

y_k / sqrt(2k-1) = x₁ * [2^{2(k-1)} ( (k-1)! )^2 ] / ( (2k-2)! ) * 1/sqrt(2k-1).

We need this to approach 1 as k→infty.

So, perhaps x₁ times [2^{2(k-1)} ( (k-1)! )^2 / (2k-2)! ) ] / sqrt(2k-1) →1.

Let me compute the limit as k→infty of [2^{2(k-1)} ( (k-1)! )^2 ] / [ (2k-2)! sqrt(2k-1) ) ].

Hmm, maybe using Stirling's approximation: n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) (n/e)^n.

So, let's compute each factorial using Stirling's approx.

First, (k-1)! ≈ sqrt(2π(k-1)) ( (k-1)/e )^{k-1}.

Similarly, (2k-2)! ≈ sqrt(2π(2k-2)) ( (2k-2)/e )^{2k-2}.

And sqrt(2k-1) is just as is.

So, plug these into the expression:

[2^{2(k-1)} * (sqrt(2π(k-1)) ( (k-1)/e )^{k-1} )^2 ] / [ sqrt(2π(2k-2)) ( (2k-2)/e )^{2k-2} * sqrt(2k-1) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

2^{2(k-
