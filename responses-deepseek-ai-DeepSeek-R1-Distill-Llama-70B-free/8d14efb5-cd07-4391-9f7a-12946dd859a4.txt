Okay, so I've got this problem here about Max Flaum and a discounted note. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these finance calculations, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, Max has a note for $2400, and he discounted it 30 days before it was due. The bank paid him $2389, and I need to find the discount rate. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Wait, discounting a note... I remember that when a note is discounted, the bank pays the present value, and the discount is based on the interest rate. So the bank takes the face value minus the discount, which gives them their interest for the period.

The formula I think is: Present Value (PV) = Face Value (FV) / (1 + (rate * time)). But wait, time here is in years, right? Because 30 days is a fraction of a year.

So, let's see. Max gets $2389, which is the present value. The face value is $2400. The time is 30 days. So I need to find the rate.

Wait, the formula might also be expressed as PV = FV * (1 - discount rate * time). Or maybe it's better to think in terms of simple interest. Oh right, for a discounted note, the interest is calculated on the face value for the time period. So the discount is the interest, and the present value is face value minus discount.

So the discount D is FV * rate * time. Then PV = FV - D.

So rearranging, D = FV - PV. Let me plug in the numbers.

D = 2400 - 2389 = $11. So the discount is $11.

Now, D = FV * rate * time. So rate = D / (FV * time).

Time is 30 days. I need to convert that into years because the rate is annual. So 30 days is 30/360, which is 1/12 of a year. Or wait, sometimes it's 30/365. The problem doesn't specify, so I'll have to assume. Probably 30/360 for simplicity, which is 0.083333 years.

So rate = 11 / (2400 * (30/360)).

Let me compute that denominator first. 2400 * (30/360) = 2400 * (1/12) = 200.

So rate = 11 / 200 = 0.055, which is 5.5%.

Looking at the options, option F is 5½%, which is 5.5%. So the answer should be F.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my time assumption. If the time was based on 365 days, then 30/365 is approximately 0.08219 years. Let me recalculate with that.

So denominator would be 2400 * (30/365) ≈ 2400 * 0.08219 ≈ 197.66.

So rate ≈ 11 / 197.66 ≈ 0.05567, which is about 5.567%. That's still approximately 5.5%, so option F is still correct.

Hmm, but wait, another thought. Some conventions use 360 days a year, others 365. The problem doesn't specify, but in banking, often it's 360 days. So the first calculation holds, giving exactly 5.5%, which is option F.

So I think the correct answer is F: 5½%.

To determine the discount rate, we use the formula for the discount on a note:

\[
\text{Discount (D)} = \text{Face Value (FV)} \times \text{rate} \times \text{time}
\]

Rearranging to solve for the rate:

\[
\text{rate} = \frac{\text{Discount (D)}}{\text{Face Value (FV)} \times \text{time}}
\]

Given:
- Face Value (FV) = $2400
- Present Value (PV) = $2389
- Time = 30 days

First, calculate the discount:

\[
\text{Discount (D)} = \text{FV} - \text{PV} = 2400 - 2389 = 11
\]

Next, convert the time into years. Assuming a 360-day year (common in banking):

\[
\text{time} = \frac{30}{360} = \frac{1}{12} \approx 0.08333
\]

Now, substitute the values into the formula for the rate:

\[
\text{rate} = \frac{11}{2400 \times 0.08333} = \frac{11}{200} = 0.055 = 5.5\%
\]

This matches option F, which is 5½%. Even if using a 365-day year for time (\( \text{time} = \frac{30}{365} \approx 0.08219 \)), the rate remains approximately 5.567%, which is still closest to 5.5%.

Thus, the discount rate is **5½%**, corresponding to option F.

Answer: F
