The defendant's attorney makes a motion to strike the plaintiff's answer. The trial judge should rule the plaintiff's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, because the son is available as a witness.
B: admissible, if the son's testimony corroborates the plaintiff's statement.
C: inadmissible, because the statement can be considered secondhand information.
D: admissible, because it gives context to the magnitude of the explosion.
E: inadmissible under the excited utterance exception, because it can be a product of reflection and deliberation.
F: admissible, because it provides relevant details about the incident.
G: admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness.
H: inadmissible, because the plaintiff's statement is based on the son's account.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about a trial where a plaintiff is testifying. The topic is the magnitude of an explosion at an oil refinery. On direct examination, the plaintiff was asked if he remembered the explosion. He answered by saying, "I recall my son running into the home and screaming that the car windows just shattered." Now, the son was available to testify. The defense attorney is moving to strike that answer, and we need to decide if the trial judge should allow it or not.

The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should break down what's happening here. The plaintiff's statement includes something his son said. So, the plaintiff is recounting the son's statement in court. That sounds like hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted—the explosion was so big it shattered the car windows.

But wait, there are exceptions to hearsay. One of them is the excited utterance exception under FRE 803(2). An excited utterance is a statement made under the stress or excitement of a startling event, and it's admissible if the statement relates to the event.

In this case, the son's statement was made right when the explosion happened. The son ran in and screamed about the windows shattering, probably right after the explosion. That seems like it was made in the heat of the moment, so it might qualify as an excited utterance.

However, the plaintiff is testifying about what his son said. So, the plaintiff's statement includes hearsay within hearsay? Wait, no, the plaintiff is recounting his own memory of the event, which includes the son's statement. So the son's statement is the hearsay part, and the plaintiff's recounting of it is just the way the information is being presented.

But wait, the son is available to testify. Usually, for hearsay exceptions like excited utterances, the declarant's availability isn't a requirement. The exception applies regardless of whether the declarant is available or not, unless it's a situation where the declarant is unavailable, which isn't the case here.

So, the defense is moving to strike the plaintiff's answer. The question is whether the statement should be admissible or not.

Looking at the options:

Option I says inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But if the son's statement is an excited utterance, then it would fall under an exception. So I don't think I is correct.

Option E says inadmissible under the excited utterance exception because it could be a product of reflection. Hmm, but excited utterances are supposed to be spontaneous, not the result of reflection. If the son's statement was made while still under the stress of the event, then it's admissible. So E might be incorrect because it's suggesting it's inadmissible, but if it's a valid excited utterance, E is wrong.

Option D says admissible because it gives context to the explosion's magnitude. That's a reason, but the real issue is whether it's hearsay. So if it's admissible under an exception, then D could be a correct reason, but I'm not sure if the option is correct.

Option G says admissible regardless of the son's availability. Since the excited utterance exception doesn't depend on the declarant's availability, G might be a contender. But wait, the plaintiff is testifying about the son's statement. The son's availability might affect whether the plaintiff can testify about it, but under the rules, the exception doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable.

Wait, but another angle: the plaintiff's own statement is not hearsay. He's testifying about his own memory of the event—his son running in and screaming. So the plaintiff's testimony is about what he perceived, which is the son's actions and words. The son's statement is hearsay, but offered under the excited utterance exception.

So the key is whether the son's statement is admissible as an excited utterance. If yes, then the plaintiff can testify about it. So the statement should be admissible.

Looking at the options again:

Option G is "admissible, whether or not the son is available as a witness." That seems correct because excited utterance doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable.

Option D: It's about giving context, which is a bit more about relevance than admissibility. So probably not the best choice.

Option I is incorrect because there's an exception.

Wait, but another thought—could the plaintiff's testimony be considered first-hand? The plaintiff is recounting what he saw and heard, so his testimony is based on his own perception. The son's statement is an out-of-court statement that's being offered for the truth, so it's hearsay. But if it's within the excited utterance exception, it's admissible.

So the statement is admissible, making options like G or D correct.

Option G says admissible regardless of the son's availability. Since the son is available, but the exception applies regardless, G would be correct.

Alternatively, option D says it's admissible because it gives context. That's a reason, but the primary legal reason is the excited utterance exception, making G more accurate.

Wait, but the options don't mention the exception directly. Let me check the options again.

Option G: admissible whether or not the son is available. That's correct because the excited utterance exception doesn't require unavailability.

So the correct ruling would be that the testimony is admissible, making the motion to strike incorrect.

Looking at the options, A says admissible because the son is available. But that's the opposite; availability isn't the reason. So A is incorrect.

So the answer should be G.

Wait, but another thought: Is the plaintiff's statement hearsay? No, the plaintiff is testifying about his own memory. The hearsay is the son's statement within the plaintiff's testimony. So the plaintiff's statement includes hearsay, but if the hearsay exception applies, then the entire testimony is admissible.

So the judge should overrule the motion to strike, so the testimony is admissible. Therefore, the correct option is G: admissible, whether or not the son is available.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the plaintiff's testimony, which includes a statement made by his son ("the car windows just shattered") in response to an explosion at an oil refinery. The defense moves to strike the testimony, and the issue is whether the son's statement qualifies as admissible evidence.

The key points are as follows:

1. **Hearsay and Exceptions**: The son's statement is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (the magnitude of the explosion). However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under a recognized exception. The excited utterance exception (FRE 803(2)) applies here because the son's statement was made immediately after the startling event (the explosion) and relates to the event itself. This exception does not depend on the declarant's availability.

2. **Plaintiff's Testimony**: The plaintiff is recounting his own memory of the event, including his perception of the son's statement. While the son's statement is hearsay, it is admissible under the excited utterance exception. The plaintiff's testimony is therefore admissible.

3. **Son's Availability**: The son's availability to testify is irrelevant to the admissibility of the statement under the excited utterance exception. The exception applies regardless of whether the declarant is available or not.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The admissibility of the statement does not depend on the son's availability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The son's testimony is not required to corroborate the plaintiff's statement for it to be admissible.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The statement is not inadmissible as secondhand information because it qualifies under the excited utterance exception.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the statement provides context, the primary legal basis for admissibility is the excited utterance exception.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The statement is not inadmissible under the excited utterance exception; it is admissible because it was made spontaneously during the event.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The statement is admissible because it falls under the excited utterance exception, not merely because it provides relevant details.
- **Option G**: Correct. The statement is admissible whether or not the son is available to testify, as the excited utterance exception does not require the declarant's unavailability.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The plaintiff's testimony is not inadmissible simply because it is based on the son's account; the son's statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception, so it is not inadmissible as hearsay without an exception.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The son's account does not need to be presented as evidence for the statement to be admissible.

The correct answer is **G** because the statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception, regardless of the son's availability.

**Answer: G**
