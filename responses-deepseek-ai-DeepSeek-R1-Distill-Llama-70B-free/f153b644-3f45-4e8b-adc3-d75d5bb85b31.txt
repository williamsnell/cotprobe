Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the mean translational kinetic energy of an ideal gas molecule in eV. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

I remember that the average translational kinetic energy of a molecule in an ideal gas is related to temperature. Oh right, the formula is something like (3/2)kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Wait, but wait, the question gives the answer in eV. Oh, right, because sometimes when we talk about energies at the molecular level, electron volts are more convenient than joules.

So the standard formula is (3/2)kT. Now, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. But since we need the answer in eV, I should probably convert that. I think 1 eV is about 1.6 x 10^-19 joules. So let me see, how much is k in eV per Kelvin?

Let me calculate that. So k = 1.38e-23 J/K. To convert to eV, divide by 1.6e-19 J/eV. So 1.38e-23 / 1.6e-19 = (1.38/1.6) x 1e-4. Let me compute 1.38 divided by 1.6. 1.38/1.6 is 0.8625. So that gives 0.8625e-4 eV/K, which is 8.625e-5 eV/K.

Wait, maybe I should double-check that calculation. Oh wait, 1.38 divided by 1.6: yeah, 1.6 times 0.8 is 1.28, and 1.38-1.28 is 0.10, so 0.10/1.6 is 0.0625. So total is 0.8625, yeah, so 8.625e-5 eV/K. Okay, that seems right.

Now, the temperature. The problem doesn't specify temperature, so I must assume it's at standard temperature, which is probably room temperature, around 300 K. Or wait, maybe it's at 0 degrees Celsius, which is 273 K. Or perhaps in some contexts, it's taken as 300 K as a standard. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in the kinetic theory, when people talk about room temperature, it's often around 300 K. Let me go with 300 K for this calculation.

So plugging into the formula: (3/2) * k * T. So that's (3/2) times 8.625e-5 eV/K times 300 K. Let me compute that.

First, compute (3/2) * 300. That's 450. So 450 multiplied by 8.625e-5 eV.

Wait, 450 * 8.625e-5. Let me compute that. 450 times 8.625 is... Well, 450 *8 is 3600, 450 *0.625 is 281.25, so total 3600 + 281.25 = 3881.25. But since it's 450 * 8.625e-5, that's 3881.25e-5 eV. Which is 0.0388125 eV, approximately 0.0388 eV.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options. Option D is 0.038, which is very close. So that would make sense. But wait, let me think again about the temperature. If I assumed 300 K, but what if the standard is different?

Wait, another thought. Some sources use 25 degrees Celsius as standard conditions, which is 298 K. Let me recalculate with 298 K to see if it makes a difference.

So T = 298 K.

So (3/2) * k * T = (3/2) * 8.625e-5 eV/K * 298 K.

Compute (3/2) *298 = 447.

447 * 8.625e-5 = let's compute 400*8.625e-5 is 3.45e-2, 47*8.625e-5 is approximately 4.06375e-3. So total is 3.45e-2 + 0.406e-2 = 3.856e-2, which is 0.03856 eV. So approximately 0.0386 eV, which is about 0.039. So option D is 0.038, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes a temperature of 300 K, making it exactly 0.0388 eV, which would round to 0.039, but perhaps the options have 0.038 as D. Hmm, but perhaps the exact value is 0.038.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Maybe I should remember the value. I think that at room temperature, around 300 K, the average translational kinetic energy per molecule is about 0.038 eV, which matches option D.

But wait, some sources might use a slightly different temperature. Let me think, the standard molar volume at STP is 22.4 L/mol at 273 K and 1 atm. So maybe the temperature used is 273 K. Let's try that.

At T=273 K.

(3/2) *8.625e-5 eV/K * 273 K.

(3/2)*273 = 409.5.

409.5 * 8.625e-5 = Let's compute.

400 *8.625e-5 = 0.0345 eV.

9.5 *8.625e-5 = approximately 0.000819375 eV.

Adding together: 0.0345 + 0.000819 = 0.035319 eV. So around 0.0353 eV. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options except perhaps option D is 0.038, which would be when using T=300 K.

Wait, but the options given are:

A:0.005, B:0.58, C:1.5, D:0.038, E:1.20, F:0.12, G:0.95, H:2.5, I:0.025, J:0.75.

So D is 0.038, which aligns with the T=300 K case. So I think the intended answer is D.

But wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, the translational kinetic energy is given per degree of freedom. Oh wait, no, the translational part is 3/2 kT, which accounts for the three translational degrees of freedom. So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thing: the question says 'mean translational kinetic energy of a single ideal gas molecule'. So that's correct, as I used the formula for a single molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in a different unit conversion. Let me double-check my unit conversion.

k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to get k in eV/K: 1.38e-23 / 1.602e-19 = approximately 8.617e-5 eV/K. So that's accurate.

So at 300 K, (3/2)*8.617e-5 *300 = (3/2)*300 = 450; 450 *8.617e-5 = let's compute this.

450 *8.617e-5 = (4.5e2)*(8.617e-5) = 4.5 *8.617 * 1e-3.

4.5 *8.617 is approximately 38.8275. So 38.8275e-3 = 0.0388275 eV, which is about 0.0388 eV. So option D is 0.038, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses k as 8.62e-5 eV/K, leading to the same result.

So I think the correct answer is D:0.038.

To compute the mean translational kinetic energy of a single ideal gas molecule in eV, we use the formula:

\[
\langle E_k \rangle = \frac{3}{2} k T
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant and \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin. Boltzmann's constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and 1 eV is equivalent to \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). Converting \( k \) to eV/K:

\[
k = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-23}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.625 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}.
\]

Assuming standard room temperature \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \), we calculate:

\[
\langle E_k \rangle = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 8.625 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 300.
\]

First, compute \( \frac{3}{2} \cdot 300 = 450 \). Then:

\[
\langle E_k \rangle = 450 \cdot 8.625 \times 10^{-5} \approx 0.0388 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This value is very close to option D: \( 0.038 \, \text{eV} \). Even if the temperature is slightly adjusted (e.g., \( T = 273 \, \text{K} \) or \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \)), the result remains consistent with option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 0.038**
