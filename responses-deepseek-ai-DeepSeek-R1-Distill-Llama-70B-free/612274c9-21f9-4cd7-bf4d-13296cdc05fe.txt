Okay, so I've got this question about operator norms, which is a topic I'm still trying to wrap my head around. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about the operator T defined as T f(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt. We're considering T as a linear operator from H to X, where H is L¹[0,2] and X is C[0,2]. Then, also as an operator from H to H. For each case, I need to find the norm of T.

Hmm, so first I should recall what the operator norm is. The operator norm of T, denoted as ||T||, is the smallest number M such that for all f in H, ||Tf|| ≤ M ||f||. Or, in other words, the supremum of ||Tf|| over all f with ||f|| ≤ 1.

Let's tackle the first part: T from H to X, where H is L¹[0,2] and X is C[0,2].

So, for any f in L¹, Tf is a continuous function on [0,2] because the integral of an L¹ function is absolutely continuous, hence continuous. Now, the norm in X is the sup norm, which is the maximum absolute value of the function on the interval.

So, ||Tf||_X = sup_{x ∈ [0,2]} |∫₀ˣ f(t) dt|.

I need to find the operator norm, which is the supremum of ||Tf||_X for all f with ||f||_H = 1 (since H is L¹, ||f|| is the integral of |f| over [0,2]).

Wait, but how do I relate this sup of the integral to the L¹ norm of f?

I remember that for functions in L¹, the integral over [0,x] can be bounded using the L¹ norm. Let me think about the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The function F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt is absolutely continuous, and its derivative is f almost everywhere.

But I'm dealing with the maximum of |F(x)|. I think I can use the fact that |F(x)| ≤ ||f||_L¹ for all x. Because |∫₀ˣ f(t) dt| ≤ ∫₀ˣ |f(t)| dt ≤ ∫₀² |f(t)| dt = ||f||_L¹.

Wait, that's not correct for all x. Because for x=2, it's exactly ||f||_L¹. For x less than 2, it's the integral up to x, which could be less. So the maximum of |F(x)| would be at x=2, because as x increases, the integral accumulates more. So the maximum is ||f||_L¹.

But wait, that's only true if f is non-negative, right? Because if f can be positive and negative, the integral could oscillate. So maybe the maximum |F(x)| isn't necessarily ||f||_L¹, but perhaps something else.

Wait, no. Because even if f can be positive and negative, the integral from 0 to x can't exceed the total integral of |f| over [0,x], which is less than or equal to ||f||_L¹ on [0,2].

Wait, but the maximum |F(x)| could be achieved at x=2, but it's possible that for some f, the integral at x=2 is zero, but at some other x it's larger. For example, if f is positive on [0,a] and negative on [a,2], then F(a) would be the maximum positive value, and F(2) could be lower or even negative.

So the maximum of |F(x)| over [0,2] isn't necessarily equal to ||f||_L¹, but I'm trying to find the supremum over all f with ||f||_L¹ = 1.

Wait, maybe I should consider Hölder's inequality. Since L¹ is the dual of C[0,2] in some sense, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the operator T is an integral operator.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's try to compute the operator norm when T is from L¹ to C.

So, operator norm is the supremum over all f in L¹ with ||f||_1 = 1 of ||Tf||_∞.

We can write ||Tf||_∞ as the maximum of |∫₀ˣ f(t) dt| over x in [0,2].

We need to find the maximum possible value of this for all f with ∫₀² |f(t)| dt = 1.

I think the maximum occurs when f is a delta function, but wait, delta functions aren't in L¹. So I can't use that. Alternatively, perhaps when f is a characteristic function.

Wait, suppose f is 1 on [0,a] and -1 on (a,2], adjusted so that the integral of |f| is 1.

Wait, maybe I should think of f as a simple function. Let's see, to maximize the integral ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt, we can set f to be 1 on [0,c] and 0 elsewhere, for some c. Then, ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt is min(x, c). The maximum of this is c. But ∫ |f| dt = c, so if c=1, then the maximum of Tf is 1, and ||f||_1 is 1. That would give ||Tf||_∞ =1.

But wait, could there be a function f where the maximum is greater than 1? Let's see.

Suppose f is such that it's 2 on [0, 0.5] and 0 elsewhere. Then ∫ |f| dt = 1, because 2 * 0.5 =1. Then Tf(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt. So at x=0.5, it's 1, and beyond that, it stays at 1. So the maximum is 1, same as before.

Wait, but what if f is a very tall spike on a very small interval? For example, f_n(t) = n on [0, 1/n], and 0 elsewhere. Then ||f_n||_1 = 1 for all n. Now, Tf_n(x) = ∫₀^x f_n(t) dt. For x >= 1/n, this is 1, and for x < 1/n, it's n x. The maximum of Tf_n is 1, achieved at x=1/n.

So in that case, the sup is always 1. So perhaps the operator norm is 1 when T is from L¹ to C.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it could be higher. Let me think again. Suppose f is such that F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt reaches a maximum at some point x0, but then F(2) is less than that. So the maximum of |F(x)| would be at x0, but the integral of |f| is 1. So how big can F(x0) be?

Wait, let's model this. Let's say F(x) increases up to x0 and then decreases. For F(x0) to be as large as possible, we'd want F(x0) to be maximum. But the constraint is that ∫₀² |f(t)| dt =1.

Wait, but F(x) is the integral of f(t) from 0 to x. So F(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt. Then, F'(x) = f(x) almost everywhere. So if f is positive on [0,x0] and negative on (x0,2], then F(x0) would be the maximum.

But the integral of |f(t)| dt would be ∫₀^{x0} f(t) dt + ∫_{x0}^2 (-f(t)) dt = F(x0) + (F(2) - F(x0)).

Wait, but F(2) is ∫₀² f(t) dt, which could be anything. But if F(x0) is the maximum, then F(2) would be less than or equal to F(x0), depending on how f behaves after x0.

Wait, but I'm trying to maximize F(x0), given that ∫ |f| dt =1.

Let me think of f as being a positive function on [0,a] and negative on [a,2], such that the total area under |f| is 1. Then F(a) would be the maximum positive value.

Let’s say f(t) = c on [0,a], and f(t) = -d on (a,2], where c and d are positive constants. Then, ∫₀² |f(t)| dt = c a + d (2 - a) =1.

We want to maximize F(a) = ∫₀^a c dt = c a.

Now, c a is to be maximized under the constraint c a + d (2 - a) =1.

But we can choose d as small as possible to make c a as large as possible. The smallest d can be is zero, but wait, if d=0, then f(t) = c on [0,a], and zero on (a,2]. Then, ∫ |f| dt = c a =1, so c=1/a. Then F(a) = c a =1.

But wait, if d is zero, then the function is c on [0,a] and zero elsewhere. Then, the integral of |f| is c a =1, so F(a)=1. So the maximum F(a) is 1.

But if I allow d to be positive, then perhaps F(a) could be higher? Let me check. Suppose d is positive. Then, from the constraint, c a + d (2 - a) =1. We want to maximize c a.

If I fix a, then to maximize c a, I can set d as small as possible. The minimum d can be is zero, so the maximum c a is 1. So even when allowing d to be positive, the maximum F(a) is 1.

Wait, that makes sense. So regardless of how we choose f (positive on some part, negative on others), the maximum of F(x) can't exceed 1 if ||f||_1=1. Hence, the operator norm from L¹ to C is 1.

Now, moving on to the second part: T as an operator from H to H, where H is L¹[0,2]. So now, both the domain and codomain are L¹ spaces.

The operator norm here is the supremum of ||Tf||_L¹ over all f with ||f||_L¹=1.

So, ||Tf||_L¹ is the integral from 0 to 2 of |∫₀ˣ f(t) dt| dx.

We need to find the maximum of this integral for all f with ∫ |f(t)| dt =1.

Hmm, this seems trickier. Let me think about it.

I know that |∫₀ˣ f(t) dt| ≤ ∫₀ˣ |f(t)| dt ≤ ∫₀² |f(t)| dt =1. So, |Tf(x)| ≤1 for all x, but that's a pointwise bound, not an integral bound.

Wait, but I'm integrating |Tf(x)| over x from 0 to 2. So, I need to compute ∫₀² |∫₀ˣ f(t) dt| dx.

Let me think of this as integrating the absolute value of the integral. Hmm.

I remember that for functions in L¹, the integral of their integrals can be bounded, but I'm not sure exactly how.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use Hölder's inequality. Wait, Hölder's is usually for products, but here we're dealing with an integral of an integral.

Wait, let's try to compute it for specific functions f to get an idea.

First, let’s take f(t) =1 on [0,1], and f(t)=0 on (1,2]. Then, ||f||_1=1.

Tf(x) = ∫₀ˣ f(t) dt. For x ≤1, it's x. For x>1, it's 1.

So, |Tf(x)| is x for x ≤1, and 1 for x>1.

So, ∫₀² |Tf(x)| dx = ∫₀¹ x dx + ∫₁² 1 dx = [x²/2]₀¹ + [x]₁² = (1/2 -0) + (2-1) = 1/2 +1= 3/2.

So, the norm here is 3/2. But is this the maximum?

Let me try another function. Suppose f(t)=2 on [0, 0.5], and f(t)=0 elsewhere. Then, ||f||_1=2 * 0.5=1.

Tf(x) is ∫₀ˣ f(t)dt. For x ≤0.5, it's 2x. For x>0.5, it's 1.

So, |Tf(x)| is 2x up to 0.5, then 1 beyond.

So, ∫₀² |Tf(x)| dx = ∫₀^0.5 2x dx + ∫_{0.5}^2 1 dx.

Calculating:

First integral: 2*(x²/2) from 0 to 0.5 → (0.5²) = 0.25.

Second integral: (2 - 0.5)*1 =1.5.

Total: 0.25 +1.5=1.75, which is 7/4=1.75.

Wait, that's larger than 3/2 which is 1.5.

Hmm, so maybe the norm is higher than 3/2. Let's try with a smaller interval.

Let’s take f_n(t) =n on [0,1/n], and 0 elsewhere. Then, ||f_n||_1= n*(1/n)=1.

Tf_n(x) = ∫₀ˣ f_n(t) dt. For x ≤1/n: n x. For x>1/n: 1.

So, |Tf_n(x)| is n x up to 1/n, then 1 beyond.

Compute ∫₀² |Tf_n(x)| dx = ∫₀^{1/n} n x dx + ∫_{1/n}^2 1 dx.

First integral: n * (x²/2) from 0 to 1/n → n*( (1/n²)/2 )= n*(1/(2n²))=1/(2n).

Second integral: (2 - 1/n)*1 =2 -1/n.

So total integral: 1/(2n) +2 -1/n =2 - (1/(2n)).

As n approaches infinity, 1/(2n) approaches 0, so the integral approaches 2.

Wait, that's interesting. So as n increases, the integral approaches 2. So the operator norm from L¹ to L¹ must be 2.

Wait, but can we achieve 2? Let me see.

If I take the limit as n approaches infinity, the function f_n becomes more like a delta function at 0, but in L¹, it's still valid. The integral of |f_n| is 1, and the integral of |Tf_n(x)| over x approaches 2.

Hence, the operator norm is 2.

But wait, let me think again. Because when f is approaching a delta function, Tf approaches a step function that jumps to 1 at x=0 and stays there. But wait, no— the integral of a delta function at 0 would make Tf(x) =1 for x>0, and 0 at x=0. So Tf would be the characteristic function of (0,2], which is 1 almost everywhere on (0,2]. But the integral of |Tf(x)| from 0 to 2 would be ∫₀² 1 dx=2, but the function Tf is 1 almost everywhere, except at 0. So in that case, ||Tf||_L¹ would be 2.

But since f_n approaches this behavior as n→∞, and the integral approaches 2, the operator norm is 2.

Therefore, the norm of T as an operator from L¹ to L¹ is 2.

Wait, but let me confirm this. Is there a function f where the integral of |Tf(x)| dx is exactly 2? Well, in the limit as n approaches infinity, f approaches a delta function, which isn't in L¹, but we can approach it arbitrarily closely with functions in L¹. So the supremum is 2.

So putting it all together:

First question (T from L¹ to C): norm is 1.

Second question (T from L¹ to L¹): norm is 2.

So the answer is [1,2], which is option A.
</think>

To determine the norm of the operator \( T \) defined as \( (Tf)(x) = \int_0^x f(t) dt \), we analyze it in two cases: as an operator from \( L^1[0,2] \) to \( C[0,2] \), and as an operator from \( L^1[0,2] \) to itself.

### Case 1: \( T \) from \( L^1[0,2] \) to \( C[0,2] \)
The norm in \( C[0,2] \) is the sup norm, \( \|Tf\|_\infty = \sup_{x \in [0,2]} |Tf(x)| \). For \( f \in L^1[0,2] \), we have:
\[
|Tf(x)| = \left| \int_0^x f(t) dt \right| \leq \int_0^x |f(t)| dt \leq \int_0^2 |f(t)| dt = \|f\|_1.
\]
Thus, \( \|Tf\|_\infty \leq \|f\|_1 \). To find the operator norm, we consider the supremum of \( \|Tf\|_\infty \) over all \( f \) with \( \|f\|_1 = 1 \). By examining specific functions, such as \( f \) being a characteristic function or a spike function, we find that the maximum value of \( \|Tf\|_\infty \) is 1. Therefore, the operator
