Question:

A buyer filed a lawsuit against a seller based on a written contract allegedly executed at the time of the sale of the seller's hot dog stand to the buyer. Under the terms of the contract, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand for a period of two years within a distance of two miles of the old hot dog stand, now owned by the buyer. The buyer alleged in his complaint that the seller violated the contract by opening a hot dog stand one-half mile from the old location. The original contract was lost prior to trial. At trial, the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy of the written contract. The seller objects as to the authenticity of the original written contract. The copy is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the seller contests the authenticity of the written contract.
B: inadmissible, because the best evidence rule requires that the original contract always be used as evidence.
C: admissible, because the duplicate is a carbon copy.
D: admissible, because the original contract was lost.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the best evidence rule. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The scenario is that a buyer is suing a seller over a contract. The contract was written, and under its terms, the seller agreed not to open a hot dog stand within two miles for two years. But the buyer claims the seller violated this by opening one half a mile away. Now, the original contract is lost before trial, and the buyer wants to introduce a duplicate carbon copy. The seller objects, saying the original's authenticity is in question.

The question is whether the copy is admissible.

I remember that the best evidence rule (sometimes called the original writing rule) generally requires the original document to be produced if the content of the writing is at issue. But there are exceptions. Like, if the original is lost or destroyed, a copy can be used. Also, sometimes duplicates are admissible without needing the original if certain conditions are met.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible because the seller contests authenticity. But wait, I think the best evidence rule is more about the content of the document, not necessarily its authenticity. If the original is lost, and a duplicate is available, the duplicate can be admitted if it's properly authenticated. The objection here is about the authenticity, but the best evidence rule might not bar it just because someone contests it. I might be mixing up authentication rules with the best evidence rule here.

Option B says it's inadmissible because the best evidence rule requires the original. But I recall that when the original is lost, a copy can be used. So B might not be correct because the original is lost, which is an exception.

Option C says it's admissible because it's a carbon copy. I think under the best evidence rule, a duplicate (like a carbon copy) is admissible if the original is unavailable. But it depends on the reason the original isn't available. Also, the rule might require that the copy be shown to be accurate.

Option D says it's admissible because the original was lost. Well, that's one of the exceptions to the best evidence rule. If the original is lost, a copy can be used as evidence.

Wait, but there's more. The best evidence rule applies when the terms of the writing are in dispute. Here, the seller is objecting to the authenticity, which I think goes to whether the contract was actually made, not just the terms. So if the original isn't available, and a duplicate exists, it can be admitted under FRE 1002 and the exceptions in 1004.

So, under FRE 1004, if the original is lost or destroyed, a copy is admissible. But it's not just about the loss; the proponent must show that the copy is accurate. Also, the copy needs to be authenticated, perhaps through testimony or other means.

In this case, the buyer is offering a carbon copy. Carbon copies are considered duplicates under the Federal Rules. So, if the original is lost, the duplicate can be admitted. But wait, the seller is objecting to the authenticity of the original contract. Does that affect the admissibility of the copy?

I think the best evidence rule is satisfied by the duplicate if the original is unavailable. The authenticity objection would go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. So the court would allow the copy in, and then the seller can challenge whether the original actually existed or was genuine. But for admissibility under the best evidence rule, the duplicate suffices when the original is lost.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be D: admissible because the original was lost. Alternatively, maybe C is correct because it's a carbon copy. Hmm.

Wait, the options are C and D. Option C says admissible because it's a carbon copy. Option D says because the original was lost.

I think the better reason is that the original was lost, making the copy admissible under the exception. So D would be the correct choice.

Wait, but another thought: under the best evidence rule, when you're trying to prove the content of a writing, you need the original unless reasons are shown why it's unavailable. So here, the original is lost, so the copy can be used. So yes, D makes sense. Also, the duplicate is a carbon, which is a type that's considered reliable, so that supports its admissibility.

So the answer should be D.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a duplicate carbon copy of a lost contract under the best evidence rule. The best evidence rule generally requires the original document when the content of the writing is at issue. However, there are exceptions, such as when the original is lost or destroyed. In this case, the original contract was lost prior to trial, which satisfies one of the exceptions to the best evidence rule. The duplicate carbon copy is admissible because the original is unavailable, and the copy is considered a reliable duplicate under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Option A is incorrect because the best evidence rule does not bar admissibility simply because the seller contests the authenticity of the contract. Such objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Option B is also incorrect because the best evidence rule does not require the original when it is lost or destroyed. Option C, while partially correct in noting that the copy is a carbon copy, does not address the key reason for admissibility, which is the loss of the original. Therefore, Option D is the most accurate answer, as it directly addresses the exception to the best evidence rule due to the loss of the original contract.

Answer: D
