Question:

Genetic studies of the two primary varieties of rice, japonica (short-grained), and indica (long-grained), suggest that:

Options:

A: each is more closely related to one another than their local wild ancestors, suggesting that these modern varieties of rice were developed recently in east Asia.
B: each is more closely related to local wild ancestors than one another, suggesting that these modern varieties of rice were domesticated separately in east Asia and south Asia.
C: each is unrelated to one another, suggesting that these modern varieties of rice were domesticated independently in east Asia and western Europe.
D: each is closely related to their local wild ancestors, suggesting that domestication must have occurred very recently and no earlier than 2,000 years ago.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this genetics question about rice varieties. Hmm, I remember that rice has different types, like japonica and indica. Japonica is short-grained, often used in sushi, and indica is long-grained, which I think is more common in places like India.

The question is about their genetic relationship. It says that genetic studies suggest something about their origins. The options are A through D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Option A says each variety is more closely related to each other than to their wild ancestors, and that they were developed recently in east Asia. Wait, but I thought japonica and indica were domesticated separately. If they were each more closely related to each other than their wild types, that might suggest a single domestication event. But I'm not sure.

Option B states that each is more closely related to their local wild ancestors than to each other, implying separate domestications in east and south Asia. That makes sense because japonica is from east Asia (like China), and indica from south Asia (like India). So maybe they were domesticated separately, each from their own wild rice species or populations.

Option C claims they're unrelated and were domesticated in east Asia and western Europe. Wait, no, I don't think rice was domesticated in Europe. Europe doesn't have wild rice in the same way. So this is probably wrong.

Option D says each is closely related to their wild ancestors, suggesting domestication was very recent, like no earlier than 2000 years ago. I'm not sure about the timing. I thought domestication of rice was older, maybe around 8,000 years ago in China. So D might not be right.

So, based on what I remember, japonica and indica were domesticated separately. So their genetic studies would show each is closer to their local wild types than each other. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but I should think about the wild ancestors. Japonica probably comes from wild species in China, and indica from those in the Indian subcontinent or Southeast Asia. So their wild ancestors are different. That supports the idea of separate domestications.

So the answer should be B. Each is more closely related to their local wild ancestors, so they were domesticated separately in east and south Asia.

Genetic studies of japonica and indica rice varieties suggest that each is more closely related to their local wild ancestors than to each other. This indicates that these modern varieties were domesticated separately in different regions: japonica in east Asia and indica in south Asia. This conclusion aligns with the understanding that japonica originated from wild rice in China, while indica traces back to wild ancestors in the Indian subcontinent or Southeast Asia. 

Option B correctly captures this relationship, as it reflects the separate domestication events in distinct geographical regions. Other options either misrepresent the genetic relationships, suggest incorrect domestication locations, or propose an overly recent domestication timeline.

Answer: B
