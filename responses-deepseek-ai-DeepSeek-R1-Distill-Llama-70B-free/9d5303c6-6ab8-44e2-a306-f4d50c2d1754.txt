Question:

A debtor owed a creditor $12,000 under a promissory note. Under the applicable statute of limitations, a suit to collect on the promissory note had to have been filed by September 30 of last year. On June 1 of this year, the creditor received a letter from the debtor stating, "I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you. " However, the debtor failed to make the payment on July 1. If, on August 1, the creditor brings suit against the debtor and the debtor asserts the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense and refuses to pay the creditor anything, which of the following accurately states the creditor's legal rights against the debtor?

Options:

B: On June 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.
C: The creditor is entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $5,000, regardless of the date.
D: On August 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $12,000.
E: The creditor is entitled to a judgment against the debtor for $7,000, the remaining amount after the promised $5,000 payment.
F: On July 1, the creditor became entitled to a judgment against the debtor for the full $12,000, due to the debtor's failure to pay.
G: The creditor is not entitled to anything, due to the statute of limitations expiring.

Okay, so I've got this legal question in front of me about the statute of limitations and a promissory note. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the situation is that a debtor owes a creditor $12,000 under a promissory note. The statute of limitations for filing a suit to collect was September 30 of last year. Now, the creditor received a letter from the debtor on June 1 of this year. The letter says, "I shall pay you $5,000 on July 1 in full satisfaction of what I owe you." But the debtor didn't make the payment on July 1. Then, on August 1, the creditor sues, and the debtor claims the statute of limitations has expired and refuses to pay anything.

So the question is about the creditor's legal rights now. The options are from A to J, but I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me think about the key points here. The statute of limitations for the debt was September 30 of last year. That means the creditor had to file a lawsuit by that date to enforce the promissory note. After that, generally, the claim is barred. But wait, sometimes there are things that can toll (suspend) or revive the statute of limitations.

In this case, the creditor didn't file by September 30, so on October 1, the statute would have expired, right? Unless something happened to extend it. Now, the debtor sent a letter on June 1 this year. What's the effect of that letter?

I remember that under the statute of limitations, if the debtor makes a payment or acknowledges the debt in writing, it can restart the clock. But in this case, the debtor didn't pay anything; they just promised to pay. So does a promise to pay reset the statute of limitations?

Wait, in some jurisdictions, a written promise by the debtor to pay can toll the statute. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The general rule is that a partial payment or an acknowledgment of the debt can restart the statute. But a promise to pay in the future might not be sufficient. Because the debtor hasn't actually made a payment yet, just a promise.

So if the creditor didn't file by the original deadline, but the debtor made a written promise after that, does that affect the statute? Hmm. Let me see.

In some states, a written promise signed by the debtor can be enough to take the case out of the statute of limitations, but I think that's when the promise is made within the limitations period. But in this case, the promise was made after the statute had already run, because September was last year, and the promise was this year on June 1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me lay out the timeline:

- Debt is $12,000, due under a promissory note.
- Statute of limitations ran out on September 30 last year. So any suit had to be filed by then.
- June 1 this year: debtor sends a letter promising to pay $5,000 on July 1 as full satisfaction.
- July 1: debtor doesn't pay.
- August 1: creditor sues.

So the issue is whether the creditor's claim is barred by the statute of limitations when they sue on August 1.

If the statute ran on September 30 last year, and the creditor didn't sue by then, their claim would normally be barred. But if the debtor did something to reset the clock, then maybe the statute starts anew.

But the debtor's promise was made after the statute had already expired. So would that even matter? Because the statute had already run its course.

Wait, but there's a concept called "tolling" which can pause the running of the statute, and "revival" which can bring it back after it's expired. But I think in most jurisdictions, once the statute has run, a subsequent acknowledgment by the debtor doesn't revive it. The debtor's actions have to occur before the statute runs to reset the clock.

So in this case, the debtor's letter was written after the statute had expired. Therefore, the promise doesn't help the creditor. So the creditor's claim would be barred by the statute of limitations.

But wait, let me think again. The letter was sent on June 1 this year, after the statute had expired. The creditor didn't sue until August 1 this year.

So when the creditor sues on August 1, the statute had already expired on September 30 last year. The debtor's letter promising payment was after that, so it doesn't help the creditor. Therefore, the creditor's lawsuit is too late, and the debtor can assert the statute of limitations as a defense.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes a written acknowledgment can restart the clock, but only if it's made during the limitations period. Since the debtor's letter was after, it wouldn't help. So the creditor's claim is barred.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the creditor is not entitled to anything because the statute of limitations has expired. That would make sense if the creditor can't sue anymore.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the debtor's letter was an offer to settle, but the creditor didn't accept it. The creditor's rights under the original note would still be $12,000, but if the statute has expired, they can't collect.

So when the creditor sues on August 1, the debtor can raise the statute of limitations as a defense, and the creditor can't collect because the time to sue had passed.

But wait, let me check the options again:

Option G: creditor is not entitled to anything, due to the statute expiring.

Option I: creditor is not entitled to anything, on either June 1 or July 1.

Wait, but could there be another angle? Like, does the debtor's promise constitute an accord, which would mean that the original debt is replaced by a new obligation? But for an accord to be valid, I think there has to be a new consideration. The debtor just promising to pay part of the debt as full satisfaction might not be enough without consideration from the creditor.

Alternatively, if the creditor accepted the offer, then there's an accord and satisfaction. But in this case, the creditor didn't accept the offer; the creditor waited until August 1 to sue, implying they didn't agree to the $5,000 settlement.

So the original debt remains at $12,000, but the creditor's right to sue expired on September 30 last year. The debtor's letter promising payment doesn't reset the statute because it was made after the statute had already run.

So when the creditor sues on August 1, the statute has already expired, so the debtor can assert it as a defense, and the creditor can't collect anything.

So the correct answer would be option G: the creditor is not entitled to anything due to the statute of limitations expiring.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: On July 1, creditor entitled to $12k. But that doesn't make sense because the statute had already expired.

Option B: On June 1, creditor entitled to $12k. No, the statute had run before that.

Option C: Creditor gets $5k regardless. But the payment wasn't made, and the statute has run.

Option D: On August 1, creditor entitled to $12k. But the statute had expired, so no.

Option E: $7k. No, because the payment wasn't made, and the statute has run.

Option F: On July 1, creditor entitled to full $12k. But the statute had run, so no.

Option H: On July 1, creditor gets $5k. But again, the statute had run, so the creditor can't collect.

Option I: Creditor gets nothing on either date. Wait, this is similar to G, but maybe G is more accurate because it's due to the statute.

Wait, but let me think again. The creditor's right to sue on the original note was barred as of September 30 last year. The debtor's letter came after that. So when the creditor sues on August 1 this year, the suit is barred.

So the creditor can't collect anything. So options G and I are in play.

Option G: ...due to the statute of limitations expiring.

Option I: ...on either June 1 or July 1.

Wait, what's the difference between G and I? I says the creditor isn't entitled to anything on either June 1 or July 1.

But the creditor didn't sue on those dates. They sued on August 1.

So when the creditor sues on August 1, the statute has expired, so the creditor can't collect. So G would be correct.

Wait, but I might be mixing up. Let me think: The suit was filed on August 1 this year, which is after the statute of limitations had run (September 30 last year). So the claim is barred, meaning the creditor can't collect anything. So the correct answer is G.

But wait, another thought: when the debtor sent the letter on June 1, did that somehow restart the statute? If the statute had already expired, does that even matter?

I think that once the statute has run, subsequent actions by the debtor (like a promise) don't revive the creditor's right to sue. So the creditor can't benefit from that.

Therefore, the creditor's lawsuit on August 1 is too late, and the statute applies, so the creditor gets nothing.

Thus, the correct answer is G.
</think>

The debtor owed the creditor $12,000 under a promissory note, and the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit to collect the debt expired on September 30 of last year. After the statute had expired, the debtor sent a letter on June 1 of this year, promising to pay $5,000 on July 1 as full satisfaction of the debt. However, the debtor failed to make the payment, and the creditor filed a lawsuit on August 1. The debtor asserted the statute of limitations as a defense.

Key points to consider:

1. **Statute of Limitations**: The creditor had to file a lawsuit by September 30 of last year to enforce the promissory note. After that date, the claim was barred unless the statute was tolled or revived.

2. **Debtor's Letter**: The debtor's letter on June 1 this year, promising to pay $5,000, was sent after the statute of limitations had already expired. In most jurisdictions, a written promise made after the statute has run does not toll or revive the statute.

3. **Creditor's Lawsuit**: The creditor filed the lawsuit on August 1 this year, which was after the statute of limitations had expired. Since the debtor's promise did not reset the clock, the creditor's claim is barred by the statute of limitations.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option G**: Correct. The creditor is not entitled to anything because the statute of limitations has expired.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. While the creditor is not entitled to anything, this option unnecessarily specifies "on either June 1 or July 1," which is irrelevant since the lawsuit was filed on August 1.

Thus, the creditor's claim is barred by the statute of limitations, and the creditor is not entitled to anything.
