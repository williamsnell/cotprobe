Okay, so I have this problem here about probability and convergence in distribution. Hmm. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

So, the setup is that we have these independent variables X₁, X₂, and so on. Each X_k can be +1 or -1, each with probability 1/2. So they're like fair coin flips, right? Each has an equal chance of being heads or tails, which we're representing as +1 or -1.

The question is about the convergence of a certain sum as n goes to infinity. The expression given is sqrt(3/n³) multiplied by the sum from k=1 to n of k times X_k. And we know that this converges in distribution to a normal distribution N(a, b). Our task is to find a and b, the expectation and variance of this normal distribution.

Wait, but when a sum converges in distribution to a normal, it's probably because of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), right? But the CLT usually applies to sums of random variables scaled appropriately, often involving the variance and the number of terms. Let me think about how the CLT applies here.

First, let's break down the sum inside the expression. The sum is S_n = sum_{k=1}^n k X_k. Each term is k multiplied by X_k. So each term is a random variable itself. Let me think about the properties of each term.

Each X_k has expectation E[X_k] = (1)(1/2) + (-1)(1/2) = 0. So each X_k has mean 0. The variance of X_k is E[X_k²] - (E[X_k])². Since X_k² is always 1, E[X_k²] = 1, so variance is 1 - 0 = 1.

Now, looking at each term in the sum: k X_k. So each term has expectation E[k X_k] = k E[X_k] = 0, because E[X_k] is zero. The variance of each term k X_k is E[(k X_k)^2] - (E[k X_k])^2. Since E[X_k^2] is 1, (k X_k)^2 is k², so E[(k X_k)^2] = k² * E[X_k^2] = k² * 1 = k². And since the expectation of k X_k is zero, the variance is just k².

Wait, but the sum S_n is the sum of these terms, each with different variances. So S_n is a sum of independent random variables with varying variances. Because each X_k is independent, their scaled versions (k X_k) are also independent.

So, the sum S_n is sum_{k=1}^n k X_k. Each term has mean 0 and variance k². So the total sum S_n has mean 0, since each term's mean is zero. The variance of S_n is the sum of the variances, because the variables are independent. So Var(S_n) = sum_{k=1}^n Var(k X_k) = sum_{k=1}^n k².

Sum of squares from 1 to n is known to be n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. So Var(S_n) = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

Now, the expression we're looking at is sqrt(3/n³) * S_n. Let me denote this as Z_n = sqrt(3/n³) * S_n.

We need to find the limit in distribution of Z_n as n approaches infinity. According to the problem, this converges to N(a, b). So we need to find a and b, which are the mean and variance of the limiting normal distribution.

First, let's compute the expectation of Z_n. Since E[S_n] = 0, E[Z_n] = sqrt(3/n³) * E[S_n] = 0. So a = 0.

Next, the variance of Z_n. Var(Z_n) = [sqrt(3/n³)]² * Var(S_n) = (3/n³) * Var(S_n). We already have Var(S_n) = sum_{k=1}^n k² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.

So substituting Var(S_n) into Var(Z_n):

Var(Z_n) = (3/n³) * [n(n+1)(2n+1)/6]

Let me simplify this expression:

First, let's expand the numerator:

n(n+1)(2n+1) = n*(n+1)*(2n+1) 

But let's compute it step by step.

Multiply (n+1)(2n+1) first:

= n*(2n+1) + 1*(2n+1)
= 2n² + n + 2n + 1
= 2n² + 3n + 1

Then multiply by n:

n*(2n² +3n +1) = 2n³ +3n² +n

So Var(S_n) = (2n³ +3n² +n)/6.

Now, Var(Z_n) = (3/n³) * (2n³ +3n² +n)/(6)

Simplify numerator: 3*(2n³ +3n² +n) = 6n³ +9n² +3n.

Denominator: n³ *6.

So Var(Z_n) = (6n³ +9n² +3n) / (6n³)

We can factor out n in numerator:

= [n(6n² +9n +3)]/(6n³)
= (6n² +9n +3)/(6n²)

Divide each term by 6n²:

= (6n²)/(6n²) + (9n)/(6n²) + 3/(6n²)
= 1 + (3)/(2n) + 1/(2n²)

Now, as n approaches infinity, the terms with 1/n and 1/n² go to zero. So the limit of Var(Z_n) as n→∞ is 1.

So the variance of the limiting distribution is 1, and the mean is 0. Therefore, the normal distribution is N(0, 1).

Looking at the options, option B is [0,1], which matches our result.

The problem involves independent random variables \( X_1, X_2, \dots \), each taking values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \) with equal probabilities \( 1/2 \). The expression \( \sqrt{3/n^3} \cdot \sum_{k=1}^n k X_k \) is known to converge in distribution to a normal distribution \( N(a, b) \) as \( n \to \infty \). The goal is to determine the values of \( a \) (the expectation) and \( b \) (the variance) of this limiting distribution.

1. **Properties of \( X_k \):**
   - Each \( X_k \) has expectation \( E[X_k] = 0 \) and variance \( \text{Var}(X_k) = 1 \).

2. **Sum \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k X_k \):**
   - Each term \( k X_k \) has expectation \( E[k X_k] = 0 \) and variance \( \text{Var}(k X_k) = k^2 \).
   - Since the \( X_k \) are independent, the variance of \( S_n \) is the sum of the variances of the individual terms:  
     \[
     \text{Var}(S_n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \text{Var}(k X_k) = \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
     \]

3. **Scaled sum \( Z_n = \sqrt{3/n^3} \cdot S_n \):**
   - The expectation of \( Z_n \) is \( E[Z_n] = \sqrt{3/n^3} \cdot E[S_n] = 0 \), so \( a = 0 \).
   - The variance of \( Z_n \) is:  
     \[
     \text{Var}(Z_n) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{n^3}}\right)^2 \cdot \text{Var}(S_n) = \frac{3}{n^3} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Var}(Z_n) = \frac{3}{n^3} \cdot \frac{2n^3 + 3n^2 + n}{6} = \frac{6n^3 + 9n^2 + 3n}{6n^3} = 1 + \frac{3}{2n} + \frac{1}{2n^2}.
     \]
     As \( n \to \infty \), the terms \( \frac{3}{2n} \) and \( \frac{1}{2n^2} \) vanish, so \( \text{Var}(Z_n) \to 1 \). Thus, \( b = 1 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The limiting distribution is \( N(0, 1) \), so \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 1 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: [0, 1]**.
