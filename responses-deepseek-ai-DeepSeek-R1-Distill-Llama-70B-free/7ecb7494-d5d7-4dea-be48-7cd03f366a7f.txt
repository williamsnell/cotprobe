Okay, so I have this problem about fluid dynamics, specifically dealing with a three-dimensional incompressible vortex flow. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me two components of velocity: the axial velocity w and the circumferential velocity v_theta. I need to find the radial velocity v_r. Hmm, I remember that for incompressible flows, the continuity equation plays a key role.

Wait, what's the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates again? Oh right, in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z), the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid is:

∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂v_θ/∂θ + ∂v_z/∂z = 0

But wait, in this problem, the flow is axisymmetric, I think. Because it's a vortex flow, which usually depends on r and z but not θ. So the partial derivative with respect to θ should be zero. That simplifies things a bit.

So the equation reduces to:

∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂w/∂z = 0

Because I'm assuming the velocity doesn't depend on θ, so the second term (∂v_θ/∂θ) is zero.

Now, looking at the given velocities:

w = 2 a z. So the derivative of w with respect to z is ∂w/∂z = 2a. That's straightforward.

v_theta is given as (A/r) [1 - exp(-a r)^2]. Wait, is that (A/r)[1 - exp( - (a r)^2 ) ]? Or maybe (A/r) [1 - exp(-a r^2)]. Hmm, the way it's written is a bit unclear. But I think it's the former, because when you have a vortex, the exponential term often involves r squared. So I'll proceed under the assumption that it's (A/r) [1 - exp(-a² r²)] or something like that, but perhaps more accurately, (A/r)[1 - e^{- (a r)^2} ].

Wait, no, let me read it again. The problem states v_theta = (A/r)[1 - exp(- a r)^2 ]. Oh wait, that's ambiguous. Is the exponent (a r)^2 or (a r squared)? Hmm, maybe it's (a r)^2, so exp(- (a r)^2 ) = e^{-a² r²}. Or perhaps the exponent is -a r squared. So perhaps it's [1 - exp(- (a r^2) ) ]? Hmm, the notation is a bit confusing.

Wait, the way it's written is (A/r)[1 - exp (- ar)^2]. So the exponent is (-a r) squared, which is a² r^2. So exp(-a² r²). So the term is (A/r)(1 - e^{-a² r²}).

But wait, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, it's possible that the exponent is -a r², so exp(-a r²), which would be written as exp(- a r^2). But the way it's written in the problem is (A/r)[1 - exp (- ar)^2]. Oh, wait, the exponent is ( - a r ) squared, which is positive. So it's e^{a² r²}, but with a negative sign in the exponent, making it e^{-a² r²}.

So v_theta is (A / r) [1 - e^{-a² r²} ].

But wait, for the continuity equation, I don't think v_theta comes into play directly, because the equation I have only involves v_r and w. So perhaps I can proceed without needing the explicit form of v_theta beyond knowing that the problem is axisymmetric.

So the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates, under axisymmetric conditions, is ∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂w/∂z = 0.

We know that ∂w/∂z = 2a.

So the equation becomes:

d(r v_r)/dr + 2a = 0.

So integrating this equation with respect to r should give me r v_r.

Let me write this as d(r v_r)/dr = -2a.

Integrating both sides with respect to r:

∫ d(r v_r) = ∫ -2a dr

So r v_r = -2a r + C, where C is the constant of integration.

Hmm, but wait, integrating the left side gives r v_r, and the right side is -2a r plus a constant.

Wait, but what's the constant of integration here? It would depend on boundary conditions. For example, as r approaches zero, perhaps v_r should behave in a certain way.

Wait, probably I can consider the behavior at r=0. Let me think: if the flow is physical, at r=0, the radial velocity might be zero, or perhaps the solution must remain finite. Let me see.

So, r v_r = -2a r + C.

So v_r = (-2a r + C) / r = -2a + C/(r).

If I want v_r to be finite as r approaches zero, then the term C/(r) would go to infinity unless C is zero. So perhaps C must be zero. But wait, if C is zero, then v_r = -2a, a constant. But that's not possible because the units don't match. Wait, no, because a has units? Let me double-check the variables.

Wait, the variables: w is given as 2 a z, which has units of velocity (m/s). So a must have units of 1/time, perhaps? Because w is m/s, z is meters: so 2 a z → a has 1/s. Wait, 2a z → a has units (m/s)/m → 1/s. So a is 1/s.

Similarly, v_theta is given as (A/r) [ ... ], so A must have units of (velocity × length) → m²/s, perhaps.

Wait, but in the continuity equation, the term ∂(r v_r)/∂r is a derivative of (r v_r) with respect to r. So r v_r has units m*(m/s) )= m²/s. The derivative would be (m²/s)/m → m/s, which matches the other term ∂w/∂z, which is 2a, with a in 1/s, so 2a is 1/s.

So the equation is correct in terms of units.

So, back to the integration. We have:

r v_r = -2a r + C.

Which gives v_r = (-2a r + C)/r = -2a + C/(r).

But for v_r to be finite at r → 0, the term C/(r) must not blow up. So unless C is zero, v_r would go to infinity or negative infinity as r approaches zero, which is not physical. So C must be zero. Therefore, v_r = -2a.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is v_r = -2a r, which would be -2a multiplied by r. But according to this, v_r is -2a, a constant, not proportional to r. None of the options seem to match that. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: v_r = - a r

B: v_r = - 2 a r

C: v_r = a r²

D: v_r = a / r

E: v_r = 0

F: v_r = 2a / r

G: v_r = 2 a r

H: v_r = -2a / r²

I: v_r = a r

J: v_r = -a / r²

Hmm, none of these match v_r = -2a. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I missed something in the continuity equation. Let me double-check the equation.

The continuity equation is:

∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρ v) = 0.

For incompressible flow, ρ is constant, so it's just ∇·v = 0.

In cylindrical coordinates, the divergence is:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + (1/r) ∂v_θ/∂θ + ∂v_z/∂z = 0.

Since the flow is axisymmetric, the ∂v_θ/∂θ term is zero. So the equation becomes:

(1/r) ∂(r v_r)/∂r + ∂v_z/∂z = 0.

Ah, I forgot the 1/r factor in the first term. That's where I went wrong earlier.

So the correct equation is:

(1/r) d(r v_r)/dr + dw/dz = 0.

So, substituting dw/dz = 2a:

(1/r) d(r v_r)/dr + 2a = 0.

So, d(r v_r)/dr = -2a r.

Now, integrating both sides with respect to r:

∫ d(r v_r) = ∫ (-2a r) dr.

So, r v_r = -2a (r² / 2) ) + C.

Wait, integral of -2a r dr is -a r² + C.

So, r v_r = -a r² + C.

Thus, v_r = (-a r² + C) / r = -a r + C/(r).

Hmm, again, the constant C. Let's think about boundary conditions. As r approaches zero, we want v_r to remain finite. So the term C/(r) would cause a problem unless C is zero.

So perhaps C=0, leading to v_r = -a r.

Looking at the options, option A is v_r = -a r. But wait, let me check if that makes sense.

Wait, wait a minute. So according to this, v_r = -a r.

But let's think about the physical meaning. If the radial velocity is negative, that means the flow is towards the axis (since v_r is negative). That might make sense in a vortex flow, perhaps, but I'm not entirely sure. But according to the math, that's the result.

Wait, but let me double-check the integration steps.

Starting again:

From the continuity equation, for axisymmetric flow,

(1/r) d(r v_r)/dr + dw/dz = 0.

Given that dw/dz = 2a,

(1/r) d(r v_r)/dr = -2a.

Multiply both sides by r:

d(r v_r)/dr = -2a r.

Integrate both sides:

r v_r = ∫ (-2a r) dr = -a r^2 + C.

So,

v_r = (-a r^2 + C) / r = -a r + C/(r).

As before. So unless C is zero, we have a problem at r=0.

But perhaps there's another boundary condition. Suppose as r approaches infinity, the radial velocity tends to zero. So when r → ∞, v_r → 0.

But in the expression v_r = -a r + C/(r), as r approaches infinity, the term -a r dominates, which would make v_r approach -infinity, which isn't physical. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem gives both w and v_theta, but in the continuity equation, only v_r and w are involved because of axisymmetry.

Wait a second, perhaps there's more to this. Maybe the presence of v_theta affects the continuity equation somehow. But no, because the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates only involves the divergence, which for axisymmetric flow is as I wrote.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider if the problem is in cylindrical coordinates, so the velocities are in their respective directions. So the given v_theta is correct, but maybe the problem is that the flow is three-dimensional, so maybe the continuity equation isn't the only thing to consider. Or perhaps I should check for any possible errors in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for another approach, perhaps using streamlines or other methods.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the radial velocity is zero, but that would require certain conditions. For instance, if the flow is purely axial and circumferential, but that's not the case here.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration. Let me re-express the equation:

After integrating, I have r v_r = -a r² + C.

So v_r = (-a r² + C)/r = -a r + C/(r).

Now, considering the behavior as r approaches zero. To have v_r finite, C must be zero, so v_r = -a r.

In that case, as r approaches zero, v_r approaches zero, which is acceptable.

So then the radial velocity is v_r = -a r.

Looking at the options, option A is v_r = -a r. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The given options have option E as v_r = 0. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the flow is only in the axial and circumferential directions, implying that the radial velocity is zero. But that's not necessarily the case; the continuity equation must be satisfied.

Wait, perhaps the given velocity field already satisfies the continuity equation without any radial flow. Let me check that.

If v_r is zero, then the continuity equation would require:

(1/r) * d(0)/dr + dw/dz = 0 → dw/dz = 0.

But in our problem, dw/dz is 2a, which is not zero. Therefore, v_r cannot be zero. So option E is incorrect.

So yes, the correct answer seems to be A: v_r = -a r.

But wait, what about the given v_theta? I didn't use it in my calculation. Did I miss something? Because the problem gives v_theta, but in the continuity equation, only v_r and w are present. So maybe the v_theta doesn't affect the radial velocity in this case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more complex, involving the curl of the velocity field, but I don't think that's necessary here. The continuity equation gives v_r directly in terms of the other components.

So I think the correct answer is A: v_r = -a r.

To determine the radial velocity \( v_r \) for the given three-dimensional incompressible vortex flow, we use the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates under the assumption of axisymmetry. The continuity equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r v_r)}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0.
\]

### Given Data:
1. Axial velocity: \( w = 2az \), so \( \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 2a \).
2. Circumferential velocity: \( v_\theta = \frac{A}{r} \left[ 1 - \exp(-a^2 r^2) \right] \) (interpreted as \( \exp(-a^2 r^2) \)).

Since the flow is axisymmetric, \( \frac{\partial v_\theta}{\partial \theta} = 0 \), and the continuity equation reduces to:

\[
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r v_r)}{\partial r} + 2a = 0.
\]

### Solving for \( v_r \):
1. Multiply through by \( r \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial (r v_r)}{\partial r} = -2a r.
   \]

2. Integrate with respect to \( r \):
   \[
   r v_r = -a r^2 + C,
   \]
   where \( C \) is the constant of integration.

3. Solve for \( v_r \):
   \[
   v_r = -a r + \frac{C}{r}.
   \]

4. Apply boundary conditions:
   - As \( r \to 0 \), \( v_r \) must remain finite. This requires \( C = 0 \), as the term \( \frac{C}{r} \) would otherwise diverge.
   - Thus, \( v_r = -a r \).

### Final Answer:
The radial velocity is \( v_r = -a r \), which corresponds to **option A**.
