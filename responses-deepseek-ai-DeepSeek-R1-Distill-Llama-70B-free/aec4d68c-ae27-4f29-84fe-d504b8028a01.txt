Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the position of stable equilibrium for a particle under a conservative force. The potential energy function is given as U(x) = (x – 2)^3 – 12x. Hmm, I remember that for a stable equilibrium, the potential energy should be at a minimum, right? So I need to find where the function U(x) has a minimum point.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the first derivative of U(x) with respect to x gives the force, because F = -dU/dx. So at equilibrium points, the force must be zero. That means I need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of U(x) and setting it equal to zero.

Let me compute the first derivative. U(x) is (x-2)^3 minus 12x. So the derivative dU/dx is 3(x-2)^2 * 1 minus 12. That simplifies to 3(x-2)^2 - 12.

Setting that equal to zero for equilibrium: 3(x-2)^2 -12 = 0. Let's solve for x. Adding 12 to both sides: 3(x-2)^2 = 12. Divide both sides by 3: (x-2)^2 = 4. Taking square roots: x-2 = ±2. So x can be 2+2=4 or 2-2=0. So the critical points are at x=4 and x=0. Are there any other points? Let me think, maybe I should check if the derivative exists everywhere, which it does because it's a polynomial function.

So the possible equilibrium points are x=4 and x=0. Now, I need to determine which of these are stable. I remember that for a stable equilibrium, the second derivative at that point should be positive. Because if the second derivative is positive, the potential is curving upwards, meaning it's a minimum, which is stable.

Let me compute the second derivative. The first derivative was 3(x-2)^2 -12. So the second derivative is the derivative of that, which is 6(x-2). 

Now, evaluate the second derivative at each critical point.

First, at x=4: 6*(4-2) = 6*2=12. Since 12 is positive, this point is a local minimum. So x=4 is a position of stable equilibrium.

Next, at x=0: 6*(0-2)=6*(-2)=-12. Negative, so this is a local maximum, which means it's an unstable equilibrium point.

So the only stable equilibrium is at x=4.

Looking back at the options, option G is x=4. So the answer should be G.

To determine the position of stable equilibrium for a particle under the conservative force with potential energy function \( U(x) = (x - 2)^3 - 12x \), we analyze the critical points and their nature.

1. **First Derivative (Force):**  
   The force is given by \( F = -\frac{dU}{dx} \). Computing the derivative:  
   \[
   \frac{dU}{dx} = 3(x - 2)^2 - 12.
   \]  
   Setting \( \frac{dU}{dx} = 0 \) to find equilibrium points:  
   \[
   3(x - 2)^2 - 12 = 0 \implies (x - 2)^2 = 4 \implies x = 4 \text{ or } x = 0.
   \]  
   Thus, the critical points are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = 0 \).

2. **Second Derivative (Stability):**  
   The second derivative is:  
   \[
   \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(x - 2).
   \]  
   Evaluating at the critical points:  
   - At \( x = 4 \):  
     \[
     \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(4 - 2) = 12 > 0.
     \]  
     Since the second derivative is positive, \( x = 4 \) is a local minimum, indicating stable equilibrium.  
   - At \( x = 0 \):  
     \[
     \frac{d^2U}{dx^2} = 6(0 - 2) = -12 < 0.
     \]  
     Since the second derivative is negative, \( x = 0 \) is a local maximum, indicating unstable equilibrium.

From the analysis, the only position of stable equilibrium is \( x = 4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: x = 4**
