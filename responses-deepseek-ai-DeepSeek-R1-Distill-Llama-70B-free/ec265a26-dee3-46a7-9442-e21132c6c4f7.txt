Okay, so I've got this problem here about fluid flow in an annulus, and I need to find the Reynolds number. Hmm, Reynolds number, right. I remember that Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity used to predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. It's defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the formula for Reynolds number is Re = (v * D * rho) / mu, where v is the velocity, D is the characteristic diameter, rho is the density, and mu is the dynamic viscosity. Oh wait, but wait—since this is an annulus, maybe I'm not using the same diameter as a regular pipe. I think for an annulus, the characteristic diameter is the hydraulic diameter. Oh right, hydraulic diameter, Dh. So what's the hydraulic diameter for an annulus?

Hydraulic diameter is usually defined as four times the cross-sectional area divided by the wetted perimeter. But wait, in an annulus, the cross-sectional area is the area of the larger pipe minus the area of the smaller pipe. So A = π(R² - r²), where R is the radius of the larger pipe and r is the radius of the smaller. The wetted perimeter would be the sum of the circumferences of both the inner and outer pipes. So P = 2πR + 2πr = 2π(R + r). So putting it together, Dh = (4A) / P.

Let me calculate that. So substituting A and P: Dh = 4 * π(R² - r²) / [2π(R + r)] ). The π cancels out, and the 4 and 2 simplify. So 4π(R² - r²) divided by 2π(R + r) becomes [4(R² - r²)] / [2(R + r)] ). Simplify numerator and denominator: 4 divided by 2 is 2. So 2(R² - r²) / (R + r). Wait, R² - r² factors into (R - r)(R + r), so this becomes 2(R - r)(R + r) / (R + r). The (R + r) terms cancel out, leaving 2(R - r). So Dh = 2(R - r). Oh, that's simpler than I thought.

Wait, so the diameters given are the inner diameter of the larger pipe and the outer diameter of the smaller pipe. Let me check the problem statement again. The inner diameter of the larger pipe is 2 ft, so its radius R is 1 ft. The outer diameter of the smaller pipe is 1.5 ft, so radius r is 0.75 ft. So R is 1 ft, r is 0.75 ft. So R - r is 0.25 ft. Then Dh is 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 ft. So the characteristic diameter is 0.5 ft.

Now, the velocity given is 10 ft/s. That's the average velocity through the annulus, I think. So v is 10 ft/s.

Next, the specific gravity is given as 0.9. Oh right, specific gravity is the ratio of the fluid's density to the density of water. So rho = specific gravity * rho_water. At standard conditions, rho_water is about 62.4 lb/ft³. So rho = 0.9 * 62.4 = let's calculate that. 0.9 times 60 is 54, 0.9 times 2.4 is 2.16, so 54 + 2.16 = 56.16 lb/ft³. So rho is 56.16 lb/ft³.

The viscosity is given as 20 centipoise. Oh wait, centipoise to poise is 1 cP = 0.01 Poise. But wait, the units in the Reynolds number formula should be consistent. Let me think about the unit conversion. Alternatively, I can use the conversion factor directly. I remember that 1 Poise (P) is equal to 0.00209 slug/(ft·s) in the English system. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula with units carefully.

Wait, another approach: Reynolds number can be calculated using the formula Re = (v * D * rho) / mu. But I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Let me figure out the units for each variable.

Velocity v is in ft/s. D is in ft. Rho is in lb/ft³. Mu is in centipoise, which I need to convert to lb/ft·s. Because in the English system, dynamic viscosity mu has units of lb·s/ft², or equivalently lb/ft·s when you think of it as (force per area per velocity gradient), but I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight.

Wait, dynamic viscosity mu in the English system is typically expressed in centipoise. 1 Poise = 1 dyne·s/cm². But to convert to English units: 1 Poise = 0.00209 slug/(ft·s). Wait, no, wait, let me think again. The unit conversion for viscosity from centipoise to lb/ft·s is as follows: 1 cP = 0.000672 lb/ft·s. Because 1 P = 1 cP * 100 = 0.1 lb/(ft·s) * (some factor), wait I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, I can remember that 1 cP = 0.001 Pa·s, but that's SI units, which might not help here. Let me find the conversion factor from centipoise to lb/ft·s.

Wait, I think 1 cP equals 0.000021167 lb/ft·s. Or maybe it's 0.000672 lb/(ft·s). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of unit conversion.

We know that 1 Pa = 1 N/s²/m², and 1 N = 0.2248 lb-force. So 1 Pa = 0.2248 lb-force/(ft²) / ( (s²) (m²) ). Wait, no, better to approach it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the formula with the given units directly. Since the problem gives viscosity in centipoise, and I'm working in the English system, I can use the following approach.

The formula for Reynolds number is Re = (v * D * rho) / mu.

But mu must be in consistent units with the others. Let me see:

v is in ft/s.

D is in ft.

rho is in lb/ft³.

mu is in lb/(ft·s).

So let's check the units: (ft/s) * ft * (lb/ft³) ) divided by (lb/(ft·s)).

So numerator: ft * ft * lb/ft³ = (ft²) * lb/ft³) = lb/ft.

Denominator: lb/(ft·s).

So (lb/ft) / (lb/(ft·s)) ) = (lb/ft) * (ft·s)/(lb) ) = s.

Wait, but Reynolds number is dimensionless, so the units should cancel out. So the formula must be correct.

So, the key is to convert the viscosity from centipoise to lb/(ft·s).

I think the conversion factor is 1 cP = 0.000021167 lb/(ft·s). Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, I found a reference that says:

1 cP = 0.001 Pa·s, and 1 Pa·s = 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s).

So 1 cP = 0.001 * 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s) = 2.1707e-7 lb/(ft·s). Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1 Pa·s = 1 kg/(m·s²) * s = kg/(m·s). Hmm, perhaps I should look for a more direct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with SI units, but I don't think that's the case here. The problem is presented in English units, so it's better to stick with that.

Wait, perhaps I can find the conversion factor from centipoise to lb/ft·s.

Here's a useful conversion: 1 cP = 0.000021167 lb/(ft·s). So yes, that's correct.

So given that the viscosity is 20 cP, that's 20 * 0.000021167 lb/(ft·s) = 0.00042334 lb/(ft·s).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express it as mu = 20 cP = 20 * 0.000021167 = 0.00042334 lb/(ft·s).

Wait, let me calculate that: 20 * 0.000021167 = 0.00042334 lb/(ft·s). So that's correct.

Now, putting it all together:

v = 10 ft/s.

Dh = 0.5 ft.

rho = 56.16 lb/ft³.

mu = 0.00042334 lb/(ft·s).

So Re = (v * Dh * rho) / mu.

Plugging in the numbers:

Re = (10 * 0.5 * 56.16) / 0.00042334.

Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

First, numerator: 10 * 0.5 = 5. 5 * 56.16 = 280.8.

Denominator: 0.00042334.

So Re = 280.8 / 0.00042334.

Hmm, let me compute that. 280.8 divided by 0.00042334.

Alternatively, 280.8 / 0.00042334 ≈

Well, 280.8 / 0.0004 is 704,000. But since denominator is 0.00042334, which is about 0.0004 * 1.05835.

So 280.8 / 0.00042334 ≈ 280.8 / 0.0004 = 704,000, but since denominator is a bit larger, the result will be a bit less than 704,000.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.00042334 is 4.2334e-4.

So 280.8 / 4.2334e-4 = ?

Let me compute 280.8 / 0.00042334.

Divide 280.8 by 0.00042334:

Compute 280.8 / 0.00042334.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e4 to make it 2808000 / 4.2334.

Now, 4.2334 * 600,000 = 2,540,040. Hmm, but that's too low. Alternatively, perhaps 4.2334 * 660,000 = ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 2808000 / 4.2334.

Let me do it step by step.

4.2334 * 663,000 = ?

Well, 4 * 663,000 = 2,652,000.

0.2334 * 663,000 ≈ 154, 800 (since 0.2 * 663,000 is 132,600; 0.0334 * 663,000 ≈ 22, 160). So 132,600 +22,160 = 154,760. So total is 2,652,000 +154,760 = 2,806,760. That's very close to 2,808,000.

So 4.2334 * 663,000 ≈ 2,806,760, which is 2,808,000. So approximately 663,000.

Wait, but 4.2334 * 663,000 is 2,806,760, which is 240 less than 2,808,000. So 663,000 plus 240 /4.2334 ≈ 56.78.

So approximately 663,056.78.

So the result is approximately 663,000. Wait, but that would make Re around 663,000. But looking at the options, the highest is 35,000. So clearly something is wrong here.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake. Because my calculation is giving me way over the options provided. So perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Let me re-examine my steps.

First, I calculated the hydraulic diameter correctly. R is 1 ft, r is 0.75 ft, so R - r is 0.25 ft, Dh is 2*(R - r) = 0.5 ft. That seems correct.

Velocity is given as 10 ft/s, so that's correct.

Specific gravity is 0.9, so rho is 0.9 * 62.4 lb/ft³ = 56.16 lb/ft³. Correct.

Viscosity is 20 cP. Now, 1 cP is 0.000021167 lb/(ft·s), so 20 cP is 20 * 0.000021167 = 0.00042334 lb/(ft·s). That seems correct.

So the formula Re = (v * Dh * rho) / mu.

Plugging in the numbers: (10 ft/s) * (0.5 ft) * (56.16 lb/ft³) divided by 0.00042334 lb/(ft·s).

Compute numerator: 10 * 0.5 =5; 5 *56.16=280.8 lb·ft/s.

Wait, no, the units: v is ft/s, Dh is ft, rho is lb/ft³. So v * Dh gives (ft/s * ft) = ft²/s. Multiply by rho (lb/ft³) gives (ft²/s * lb/ft³) )= lb/(ft·s). So the numerator is in lb/(ft·s), denominator is also lb/(ft·s). So the units cancel, giving a dimensionless Re. Correct.

So the calculation is 280.8 lb/(ft·s) divided by 0.00042334 lb/(ft·s) = 280.8 / 0.00042334.

Wait, wait, 280.8 divided by 0.00042334 equals approximately 663,000. But the options go up to 35,000. So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps I got the conversion factor wrong. Let me double-check the conversion from centipoise to lb/(ft·s).

Alternative approach: 1 Pa = 1 N/s²/m². Since 1 N = 0.2248 lb, and 1 m = 3.28084 ft.

So 1 Pa = 0.2248 lb/(s²·m²) = 0.2248 lb/(s² * (3.28084 ft)^2 ) = 0.2248 / (10.7639 ft²) ) lb/(s²·ft²) ) = 0.020885 lb/(ft·s²).

Wait, but Pa is kg/(m·s²), so 1 Pa·s is kg/(m·s). Which is the same as (kg/(m·s)) * (1/(3.28084)) )= kg/(ft·s). But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conversion that 1 cP = 0.001 Pa·s, and then convert Pa·s to lb/(ft·s).

1 Pa = 0.0208855 lb/ft².

So 1 Pa·s = 0.0208855 lb/(ft²·s).

But 1 lb/(ft²·s) is equal to 1 lb/(ft·s) divided by ft. So 1 Pa·s = 0.0208855 / 1 ft * lb/(ft·s) ) = 0.0208855 lb/(ft·s).

Wait, no, let me think again. Maybe I should use the unit conversion factor directly.

Wait, according to some sources, 1 Pa·s = 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s). Let me check that.

Yes, I found a reference that says 1 Pa·s = 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s).

So, since 1 cP = 0.001 Pa·s, then 1 cP = 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s).

Wait, wait no. Because 1 Pa·s = 1000 cP. So 1 cP = 0.001 Pa·s.

So then 1 cP = 0.001 * 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s) = 2.1707e-7 lb/(ft·s). Wait, that would make 20 cP equal to 20 * 2.1707e-7 = 4.3414e-6 lb/(ft·s). Which is 0.0000043414 lb/(ft·s). Wait, that's way smaller than before. But earlier I thought 1 cP = 0.000021167 lb/(ft·s). So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me re-express it.

We have 1 Pa = 0.0208855 lb/ft². So 1 Pa·s = 0.0208855 lb/(ft²·s).

But lb/(ft²·s) is equal to (lb/(ft·s)) * (1/ft).

So 1 Pa·s = 0.0208855 / ft * lb/(ft·s).

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of unit conversion:

We have 1 Pa = 1 kg/(m·s²) = 0.001 kg/(dm·s²) = 0.001 g/(cm·s²) = 1 cP. So 1 cP = 0.001 Pa·s.

But to convert Pa·s to lb/(ft·s), we can use the conversion factor.

We know that 1 Pa·s = 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s).

So 1 cP = 0.001 Pa·s = 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s) * 0.001? No, wait, that can't be right because then it would be even smaller. Wait, no—wait, 1 cP is 0.001 Pa·s, so 1 cP = 0.001 * 0.00021707 lb/(ft·s) = 2.1707e-7 lb/(ft·s).

Wait, but that would
