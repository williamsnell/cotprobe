Okay, so I have this economics question here about the relationship between Net National Product (NNP) and Gross National Product (GNP). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that GNP measures the total economic output of a country, including all the final goods and services produced by the country's factors of production, whether they're within the country or abroad. But then there's NNP, which I think is a bit different. Oh right, NNP is GNP minus depreciation. Depreciation is the value of the wear and tear on capital goods, like machinery and buildings, right?

So if GNP is the broader measure that includes all production, then NNP adjusts that by subtracting the depreciation. Because depreciation represents the consumption of fixed capital, so NNP gives a clearer picture of the actual new production without the loss from asset degradation.

So the formula should be NNP = GNP minus depreciation. Let me check the options. Option D says NNP = GNP - Depreciation. That matches what I was thinking. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up with GDP. Oh wait, GDP is Gross Domestic Product, which is different because it's within the country only, but the relationship between GNP and NNP should still hold the same way as GDP and NNP.

Wait, let me think again. GNP includes income from abroad, right? But regardless, the subtraction of depreciation to get NNP should still apply. So yes, the correct formula is NNP equals GNP minus depreciation. So looking at the options, D is the right choice.

The relationship between Net National Product (NNP) and Gross National Product (GNP) is defined by the subtraction of depreciation from GNP to calculate NNP. Depreciation accounts for the wear and tear on capital goods over time. Therefore, the formula is:

NNP = GNP - Depreciation.

Among the given options, the correct one is:

D: NNP = GNP - Depreciation.

Answer: D
