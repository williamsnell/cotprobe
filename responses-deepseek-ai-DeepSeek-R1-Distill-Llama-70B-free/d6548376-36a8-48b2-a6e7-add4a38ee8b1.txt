Okay, so I've got this question about vegans and vitamin B12 deficiency. Hmm, I need to figure out what proportion of vegans are likely to be deficient in B12. The options are A through J, with percentages ranging from 3% to 85%. 

First, I remember that vitamin B12 is mainly found in animal products. So vegans, who don't eat any animal-derived foods, are at a higher risk of deficiency unless they supplement or eat fortified foods. 

Wait, I think I've heard that a significant portion of vegans are deficient. But I'm not exactly sure of the percentage. I recall reading somewhere that it's a majority, like more than half. Maybe around 70-80%? Or was it less?

I should consider factors like whether the vegans take supplements. If they do, their deficiency rates would be lower. But not all vegans might be taking B12 supplements regularly. Some might rely on fortified foods, but maybe that's not enough.

I've also heard that the absorption of B12 can be an issue, especially as people age, but that's more general, not specific to vegans. 

I think I remember a study or some data that showed a high percentage, like around 80-85% of vegans being deficient. That would make sense because without animal products, it's hard to get enough B12. Unless they are really careful with their diet and supplements, which many might not be.

Looking at the options, D is 85%, which fits with what I was thinking. But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Could it be lower? Maybe 75%? That's option F. But I think the figure I remember was higher than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is lower because some vegans do take supplements. But I think the deficiency is still quite prevalent. Another point is that B12 deficiency can take time to develop, so even if someone is a vegan for a few years, they might not show symptoms yet, but their levels could be low.

So putting it all together, I'm leaning towards the higher percentages. The options are D:85% and F:75%. Which one is more accurate?

I think I've read that up to 90% of vegans might be deficient, but that's not one of the options. So 85% is the closest, which would be option D.

The question asks about the proportion of vegans likely to be deficient in vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, and vegans, who exclude all animal-derived foods, are at a higher risk of deficiency unless they consume fortified foods or supplements. While not all vegans may consistently take supplements or rely on fortified foods, studies suggest a significant prevalence of deficiency among vegans.

Considering the options provided, the highest percentages are D (85%) and F (75%). Based on prior knowledge, the figure often cited for B12 deficiency among vegans is around 80-85%, making D the most accurate choice.

Answer: D
