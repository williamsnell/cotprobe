Alright, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how many unique numbers can be made by creating a fraction where the numerator is one of 2, 3, 4, or 6, and the denominator is also one of those numbers. Hmm, okay.

First, I think I should list out all possible fractions. Since both numerator and denominator can be 2,3,4,6, there are 4 choices for numerator and 4 for denominator. So that makes 16 possible fractions in total. But wait, the question is about unique numbers, so some of these fractions must simplify to the same value.

Let me list all the fractions:

Numerator 2:
2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 2/6

Numerator 3:
3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 3/6

Numerator 4:
4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6

Numerator 6:
6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6

Now, I need to simplify each of these and see which ones are unique.

Starting with numerator 2:
2/2 = 1
2/3 is already in simplest form.
2/4 simplifies to 1/2.
2/6 simplifies to 1/3.

Numerator 3:
3/2 is simplest.
3/3 =1
3/4 is simplest.
3/6 simplifies to 1/2.

Numerator4:
4/2 = 2
4/3 is simplest.
4/4=1
4/6 simplifies to 2/3.

Numerator6:
6/2=3
6/3=2
6/4 simplifies to 3/2.
6/6=1

Now let me list all the simplified forms:

From numerator 2:
1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3.

From numerator 3:
3/2, 1, 3/4, 1/2.

From numerator4:
2, 4/3, 1, 2/3.

From numerator6:
3, 2, 3/2, 1.

Now I'll collect all the unique values. Let's go through each and see.

Looking at them:

1 appears multiple times.
2/3 appears in numerator 2 and 4.
1/2 appears in numerator 2 and 3.
1/3 appears in numerator 2.
3/2 appears in numerator3 and 6.
3/4 appears in numerator3.
2 appears in numerator4 and 6.
3 appears in numerator6.
4/3 appears in numerator4.
Wait, wait, 4/3 is from 4/3 and 6/4? Let me confirm.

Wait, numerator4: 4/3 is 4/3. Numerator6: 6/4 is 3/2, which is the same as 3/2.
Wait, no. 6/4 is 3/2, which is same as 3/2. So 4/3 is a different value.

So let's list all the unique ones:

1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 3/2, 3/4, 2, 4/3, 3.

Wait, let's count:

1. 1
2. 2/3
3. 1/2
4. 1/3
5. 3/2
6. 3/4
7. 2
8. 4/3
9. 3

Wait, that's 9 unique numbers. But wait, let me double-check if I missed any.

Wait, in the fractions:

From numerator2: 1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3.

From numerator3: 3/2, 1, 3/4, 1/2.

From numerator4: 2, 4/3, 1, 2/3.

From numerator6:3, 2, 3/2, 1.

So when I collect all, the values are:

1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 3/2, 3/4, 2, 4/3, 3. So that's 9 unique values.

Wait, but let me see if any others are the same. For example, 2 is the same as 2/1, but that's not in the list. 3 is the same as 3/1.

Wait, but are there any duplicates beyond what I've considered? Let me see:

Looking at each simplified fraction:

1: yes, appears multiple times.

2/3, 1/2, 1/3: only in numerator2.

3/2, 3/4: only in numerator3.

2: in numerator4 and 6.

4/3: only in numerator4.

3: only in numerator6.

So that's 9 unique fractions.

Wait, but the options have G as 9. So the answer would be G.

But wait, let me double-check in case I missed any duplicates.

Wait, 4/3 and 3/2 are different, correct.

Let me think about each possible simplified fraction:

1. 1 (from 2/2, 3/3,4/4,6/6)
2. 1/3 (from 2/6)
3. 1/2 (from 2/4, 3/6)
4. 2 (from 4/2,6/3)
5. 2/3 (from 2/3, 4/6)
6. 3 (from 6/2)
7. 3/2 (from 3/2,6/4)
8. 3/4 (from 3/4)
9. 4/3 (from4/3)

Yes, that's 9. So the answer is G:9.

To determine how many unique numbers can be made by creating a fraction with $2, 3, 4,$ or $6$ in the numerator and $2, 3, 4,$ or $6$ in the denominator, we first list all possible fractions and simplify them:

### Fractions and Simplifications:
1. **Numerator 2**:
   - $2/2 = 1$
   - $2/3$ (already in simplest form)
   - $2/4 = 1/2$
   - $2/6 = 1/3$

2. **Numerator 3**:
   - $3/2$ (already in simplest form)
   - $3/3 = 1$
   - $3/4$ (already in simplest form)
   - $3/6 = 1/2$

3. **Numerator 4**:
   - $4/2 = 2$
   - $4/3$ (already in simplest form)
   - $4/4 = 1$
   - $4/6 = 2/3$

4. **Numerator 6**:
   - $6/2 = 3$
   - $6/3 = 2$
   - $6/4 = 3/2$
   - $6/6 = 1$

### Unique Simplified Values:
After simplifying, the unique values are:
1. $1$
2. $1/3$
3. $1/2$
4. $2/3$
5. $3/2$
6. $3/4$
7. $2$
8. $3$
9. $4/3$

Thus, there are **9 unique numbers** that can be formed.

### Final Answer:
G: 9
