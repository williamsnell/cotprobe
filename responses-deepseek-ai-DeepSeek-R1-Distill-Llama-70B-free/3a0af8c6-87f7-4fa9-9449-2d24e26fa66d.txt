To solve for \( T(-3, 2) \), we first need to determine the general form of the function \( T(x, y) \). The problem provides two specific values: \( T(1, 0) = 3 \) and \( T(0, 1) = -5 \). 

Since \( T: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \), we can assume that \( T(x, y) \) is a linear function of the form:
\[
T(x, y) = ax + by + c
\]
However, given that \( T(1, 0) = 3 \) and \( T(0, 1) = -5 \), we can simplify the function by setting \( c = 0 \) (as there is no constant term provided in the problem). Thus:
\[
T(x, y) = ax + by
\]

Using the given values:
1. For \( T(1, 0) = 3 \):
\[
a(1) + b(0) = 3 \implies a = 3
\]

2. For \( T(0, 1) = -5 \):
\[
a(0) + b(1) = -5 \implies b = -5
\]

Now, the function is:
\[
T(x, y) = 3x - 5y
\]

To find \( T(-3, 2) \):
\[
T(-3, 2) = 3(-3) - 5(2) = -9 - 10 = -19
\]

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{-19}
\]

The correct option is **I**.
