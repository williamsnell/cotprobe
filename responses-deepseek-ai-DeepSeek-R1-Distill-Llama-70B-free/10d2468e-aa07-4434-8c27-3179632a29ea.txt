Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. The question is about which proposition is an immediate consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. A ⊃ (B • C)
2. ~(B • C)
3. A ∨ (D ∨ B)

And the options are A through J, each representing a different proposition.

Alright, first, I need to understand what each premise means and how they relate to each other. Let's break them down.

Premise 1: A implies (B and C). So if A is true, then both B and C must be true. This is a material implication, right? So A ⊃ (B • C) is logically equivalent to ~A ∨ (B • C), but I'm not sure if that's useful yet.

Premise 2: The negation of (B and C). So ~(B • C) means it's not the case that both B and C are true. By De Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to ~B ∨ ~C. So either B is false, or C is false, or both.

Premise 3: A or (D or B). So this is A ∨ D ∨ B. Because ∨ is associative, the grouping doesn't matter. So if any of A, D, or B is true, this premise is true.

Now, the question is which of the options is an immediate consequence. An immediate consequence would be something that can be derived in one step from the premises. So I should look for something that follows directly without needing multiple steps.

Looking at the premises, I notice that premise 1 and premise 2 might be related. Since premise 1 is A implies (B and C), and premise 2 is the negation of (B and C), perhaps we can use modus tollens here. Modus tollens is the rule that if we have A ➔ Q and ~Q, then we can conclude ~A.

So applying modus tollens to premise 1 and 2:

Premise 1: A ⊃ (B • C)
Premise 2: ~(B • C)
Therefore, ~A.

So that would mean that ~A is an immediate consequence. Looking at the options, option C is ~A. So that's a possible answer.

But wait, let's check the other premises to make sure there isn't another immediate consequence. Let's look at premise 3: A ∨ D ∨ B.

If we have ~A from the first two premises, then in premise 3, since A is false, the disjunction A ∨ (D ∨ B) simplifies to (D ∨ B). Because if A is false, for the whole disjunction to be true, either D or B must be true. So from premise 3 and ~A, we can conclude D ∨ B.

But wait, the question is about an immediate consequence in one step. So the first step gives us ~A. Then, using ~A with premise 3, we could get D ∨ B, but that's two steps. So the immediate consequence from the premises without any intermediate steps would be ~A.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~A, which matches what I derived. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any other immediate consequences? Let's see. From premise 2, ~(B • C), which is equivalent to ~B ∨ ~C. So any immediate consequences from that? Well, alone, it doesn't directly give us ~B or ~C, but in combination with other premises, perhaps.

But the question is about an immediate consequence from the given premises, not necessarily combining them. So perhaps ~A is the only direct one. Alternatively, could there be another conclusion from combining premises 2 and 3?

Wait, premise 3 is A ∨ (D ∨ B). If we have ~A from premises 1 and 2, then substituting into premise 3, we get ~A ∨ (D ∨ B), which is a tautology because ~A ∨ anything is true if ~A is true. So that doesn't give us new information. Alternatively, from premise 3, since it's A ∨ (D ∨ B), and if we have ~A, then we can infer D ∨ B. But that's a two-step process: first, get ~A, then apply it to premise 3.

So the immediate consequence is ~A, which is option C. Therefore, the answer should be C.

The question asks which proposition is an immediate (one-step) consequence of the given premises in propositional logic (PL). The premises are:

1. \( A \supset (B \cdot C) \)
2. \( \neg (B \cdot C) \)
3. \( A \lor (D \lor B) \)

### Analysis of the Premises:
- **Premise 1**: \( A \supset (B \cdot C) \) means that if \( A \) is true, then both \( B \) and \( C \) must be true. This is logically equivalent to \( \neg A \lor (B \cdot C) \).
- **Premise 2**: \( \neg (B \cdot C) \) means it is not the case that both \( B \) and \( C \) are true. By De Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to \( \neg B \lor \neg C \).
- **Premise 3**: \( A \lor (D \lor B) \) is a disjunction that can be simplified to \( A \lor D \lor B \) due to the associativity of \( \lor \).

### Deriving Immediate Consequences:
1. **From Premises 1 and 2**:
   - Using **modus tollens**, if \( A \supset (B \cdot C) \) (Premise 1) and \( \neg (B \cdot C) \) (Premise 2), then \( \neg A \) can be directly inferred. This is an immediate consequence.

2. **From Premise 3**:
   - While \( A \lor D \lor B \) (Premise 3) could be used in conjunction with \( \neg A \) to infer \( D \lor B \), this would require two steps: first deriving \( \neg A \) and then applying it to Premise 3. Thus, \( D \lor B \) is not an immediate consequence.

### Conclusion:
The only immediate consequence of the premises in one step is \( \neg A \), which corresponds to option **C**.
