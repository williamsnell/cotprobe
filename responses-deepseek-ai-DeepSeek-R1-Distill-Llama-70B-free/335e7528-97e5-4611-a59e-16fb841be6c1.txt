Question:

A law bookstore entered into a written contract to purchase from the publisher 100 copies of the latest edition of a certain casebook for $10 per book. Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is

Options:

A: unenforceable, because the original contract terms should prevail.
B: enforceable, if the publisher could prove the existence of a calculation error.
C: unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.
D: unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.
E: unenforceable, because the increase in price was not agreed upon at the time the contract was formed.
F: enforceable, because the owner agreed to the new terms.
G: enforceable, because the publisher had the right to correct his mistake.
H: enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.
I: enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the problem carefully.

The scenario is about a law bookstore that entered into a written contract with a publisher. The contract was for 100 copies of a casebook at $10 each. So, total would be $1000. Three days after the contract was formed, the publisher calls and says there was a calculation error; the price should have been $11 each. They tell the owner that they won't deliver unless the owner agrees to the new price. The owner reluctantly agrees.

The question is about whether this new agreement is enforceable. The options are from A to I, and I need to choose the right one.

Hmm, I think this has to do with contract modifications. I remember that under common law, a modification to a contract requires new consideration to be enforceable. The pre-existing duty rule says that if you're just doing what you were already supposed to do, there's no new consideration, so the modification isn't binding.

Wait, but wait—this might be about the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) because it's about the sale of goods. The UCC has different rules, right? Under UCC § 2-209, a contract can be modified without additional consideration if the modification is made in good faith. So even if there's no new consideration, as long as the party isn't taking advantage, the modification can be enforceable.

But in this case, the publisher is trying to increase the price because of their own calculation error. So was the publisher acting in good faith? If the mistake was theirs, is that a valid reason to modify the contract under UCC?

Wait, the UCC allows for modifications even without consideration as long as they're done in good faith. So if the publisher made a mistake in pricing and tried to correct it, that could be seen as a good faith modification.

But wait, another point: the original contract was for $10. The publisher now wants $11. The bookstore agreed reluctantly. So is this a valid modification under UCC 2-209?

I think another consideration is whether this is a sale of goods. Since it's about books, yes, it's a good, so UCC applies.

So, under UCC 2-209(1), a modification doesn't require consideration to be binding. So even if the bookstore didn't get anything extra, the modification could still be enforceable if done in good faith.

But wait, the modification here is the publisher trying to correct their own mistake. So if they made a mistake in the original contract price, can they now demand a higher price? Is that allowed under the UCC?

Alternatively, there's the concept of mistake in contract law. If the publisher made a unilateral mistake (their own error) in the contract, can they now enforce a change? But for unilateral mistake, the general rule is that it doesn't make the contract voidable unless certain conditions are met, like the other party knew or had reason to know about the mistake.

In this case, the bookstore owner probably didn't know about the publisher's error until they were told. So maybe the publisher can't enforce the change based on mistake. But that's separate from the modification under UCC 2-209.

So, the key issue is whether the modification is enforceable. Under UCC 2-209, even without consideration, it's enforceable if done in good faith. So the publisher here is trying to correct a mistake. If that's in good faith, the modification is allowed.

Wait, but the publisher is trying to increase the price after the fact because of their own error. So, is that considered in bad faith? Like, if a seller makes a mistake in pricing and then tries to charge more, that might be seen as opportunistic, which could be bad faith.

Alternatively, maybe the publisher can argue that they made a computational error, so they have a right to correct it, perhaps under the doctrine of mistake. But I think for unilateral mistake, the contract isn't voidable unless the non-mistaken party knew about it or it was a mistake that a reasonable person would recognize.

In this case, the bookstore agreed after the publisher told them about the error. So perhaps the modification is valid if it's done in good faith.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think through the answer options.

Option A says it's unenforceable because the original terms should prevail. That would be the case if the modification isn't allowed without consideration, but under UCC, that's not necessarily the case.

Option B: enforceable if calculation error is proven. Maybe, but is that the right reason? The UCC allows modifications without consideration, so the existence of the error might be an issue of good faith.

Option C: unenforceable under the statute of frauds. I don't think so. The original contract was written, so any modification would also need to be in writing to be enforceable, but the question doesn't say anything about that. Also, the statute of frauds applies to the original contract, not necessarily to its modification unless it's for a quantity change beyond what's allowed.

Option D: unenforceable because the error was the publisher's computational mistake. Hmm, maybe that's the case. If the error was their fault, can they now change the terms? Under common law, without consideration, no. But under UCC, if in good faith, maybe yes. But if the error was their mistake, perhaps that's bad faith.

Option E: unenforceable because the price increase wasn't agreed upon initially. That seems similar to A. The question is whether the subsequent agreement is valid.

Option F: enforceable because the owner agreed. But under UCC, even without consideration, if agreed and in good faith, it's enforceable. But the owner's agreement was reluctant, but that doesn't necessarily make it invalid.

Option G: enforceable because the publisher had the right to correct their mistake. I'm not sure about that. Mistake doesn't automatically give the right to change the contract unless the other party agrees.

Option H: enforceable under promissory estoppel. I don't think that applies here. Promissory estoppel is when a promise is enforced even without consideration when the other party relied on it. But in this case, the publisher is trying to enforce a modification, not a third party.

Option I: enforceable because no new consideration. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If it's enforceable because no new consideration, that's incorrect because under common law, you need consideration, but under UCC, you don't. But I think this option is trying to trick you because it says "because it was not supported by any new consideration." But under UCC, that's okay as long as it's in good faith, so the lack of consideration doesn't make it unenforceable. So this option is incorrect.

Wait, so going back to the UCC: even without consideration, the modification is enforceable as long as it's done in good faith. So the key is whether the publisher acted in good faith. If the publisher made a computational error and then tried to correct it, that could be in good faith. So the modification would be enforceable.

But another angle: the original contract was for $10. The publisher now wants $11. The bookstore agreed. So under UCC 2-209, the modification is allowed without consideration. So the agreement to pay $11 is enforceable because the modification was made in good faith.

So looking at the options:

Option F says enforceable because the owner agreed. But under UCC, the owner's agreement is enough (as long as in good faith), so F could be correct.

Option G says enforceable because the publisher had the right to correct their mistake. I'm not sure about that. Mistake in pricing usually doesn't give a right to change the contract without the other party's agreement. But here, the other party did agree.

So the main issue is whether the modification is enforceable. Since UCC allows modifications without consideration if in good faith, and assuming the publisher was acting in good faith (they made an honest error), then the modification is enforceable.

So the answer would be F: enforceable because the owner agreed.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: under the common law, a modification without consideration is not enforceable because of the pre-existing duty rule. But since this is a sale of goods, UCC applies, so the modification is enforceable.

So the correct answer would be F.

But looking back at the options:

Option F: enforceable, because the owner agreed.

Option B: enforceable if the publisher can prove calculation error.

Wait, but under UCC, the publisher doesn't need to prove the error; they just need to show that the modification was done in good faith. So perhaps the existence of the error supports the good faith. So B could also be a contender.

But the question is whether the owner's agreement is enforceable. The UCC says that a modification is enforceable as long as it's in good faith, regardless of consideration. So even if the publisher made a mistake, as long as it's a good faith modification, it's enforceable. So the owner's agreement would make it enforceable.

Wait, but the owner's agreement to the modification is the key. So if the publisher proposed the modification and the owner agreed, then under UCC, it's enforceable, regardless of consideration, provided it's in good faith.

So in that case, the correct answer would be F: enforceable because the owner agreed.

So looking at the options, F is the one that states that the agreement is enforceable because the owner agreed, which aligns with UCC 2-209.

Wait, but another point: the modification was a price increase. UCC 2-209(2) says that when a modification is in good faith, course of dealing, usage of trade, etc., are factors. So if the publisher was trying to take advantage, it might not be in good faith. But in this case, the publisher was correcting their own error, which would likely be in good faith.

So yes, the modification is enforceable because the owner agreed, making option F correct.

The scenario involves a written contract between a law bookstore and a publisher for the purchase of 100 casebooks at $10 each. Three days later, the publisher informed the bookstore that due to a calculation error, the price should have been $11 per book and insisted on the new price for delivery. The bookstore reluctantly agreed. The question is whether the bookstore's agreement to pay $11 per book is enforceable.

This case involves the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) because it concerns the sale of goods. Under UCC § 2-209, contract modifications do not require additional consideration to be enforceable, provided the modification is made in good faith. Here, the publisher sought to correct their own computational error, which could be considered a good faith modification. The bookstore's agreement to the new terms further supports the enforceability of the modification.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The original contract terms do not automatically prevail under UCC § 2-209, as modifications are allowed without consideration if made in good faith.
- **B**: Incorrect. While the calculation error may support good faith, the enforceability of the modification does not depend on proving the error.
- **C**: Incorrect. The statute of frauds does not apply here, as the original contract was already in writing, and the modification does not fall outside the scope of the statute.
- **D**: Incorrect. The publisher's computational error does not inherently make the modification unenforceable; the focus is on whether the modification was made in good faith.
- **E**: Incorrect. The enforceability of the modification is not based on whether the price increase was agreed upon initially but on whether the subsequent agreement was valid under UCC § 2-209.
- **F**: Correct. The bookstore's agreement to the new terms, combined with the publisher's good faith in correcting their error, makes the modification enforceable under UCC § 2-209.
- **G**: Incorrect. The publisher does not have an inherent right to correct mistakes; the enforceability depends on the modification being in good faith and agreed upon.
- **H**: Incorrect. Promissory estoppel does not apply here, as there is no third-party reliance or injustice requiring its application.
- **I**: Incorrect. The lack of new consideration does not make the modification unenforceable under UCC § 2-209.

The correct answer is that the bookstore's agreement to pay $11 per book is enforceable because the owner agreed to the new terms, which aligns with UCC § 2-209. 

**Answer: F**
