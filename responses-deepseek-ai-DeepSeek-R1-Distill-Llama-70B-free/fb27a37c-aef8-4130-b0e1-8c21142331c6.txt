Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sexual fantasies and their relation to sexual orientation. Hmm, okay, I need to think this through carefully. Let me read it again.

The question says: "Heterosexual fantasies about sexual activity never involve someone _________, and gay and lesbian fantasies never involve persons of __________." And then there are several options from A to J.

Wait, so the blanks are about what each type of fantasy never involves. Let me break it down. The first part is about heterosexual fantasies, the second about gay and lesbian.

First, I remember that sexual orientation typically refers to the gender(s) one is attracted to. Heterosexual refers to being attracted to the opposite gender, while homosexual (gay/lesbian) refers to being attracted to the same gender.

But wait, the question is about fantasies. So, do heterosexual people only fantasize about the opposite gender? Or do they sometimes include the same gender? And similarly for gay people?

I think that's where it gets a bit tricky. Because people's fantasies don't always align perfectly with their stated orientation. But I believe the question is making a general statement, perhaps based on stereotypes or traditional views.

So, the first blank: heterosexual fantasies never involve someone of... what? If someone is heterosexual, their fantasies are about the opposite gender. So, would they never involve someone of the same gender? Or is that not necessarily the case?

Wait, but the question says "never involve someone". So the idea is that in their fantasies, they don't have people of a certain gender. So if you're heterosexual, your fantasies are about the opposite gender, so they never involve someone of the same gender. But wait, that's not necessarily true. Some people might have occasional same-gender fantasies but still identify as heterosexual. But I think the question is set up in a way that assumes a strict division.

Similarly, for the second part, gay and lesbian fantasies never involve persons of... the opposite gender? Because they're attracted to the same gender. So their fantasies wouldn't include opposite gender people.

Wait, but let me think about the options. Let's look at option A: "of the other gender; of the same gender." That would mean heterosexuals never involve other gender, which doesn't make sense because they're attracted to the opposite (so same as the other gender? Wait, no. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing.

Wait, in the question, the first blank is for heterosexual fantasies. So the statement would be: Heterosexual fantasies never involve someone [something], and gay/lesbian never involve [something else].

If I'm heterosexual, my fantasies are about the opposite gender. So they never involve someone of the same gender. So the first blank would be "of the same gender." Because that's what they never involve.

Similarly, for gay and lesbian, their fantasies are about the same gender, so they never involve someone of the opposite gender.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Let's check each option.

Option A: of the other gender; of the same gender.

Wait, other gender? Wait, no. Because for heterosexuals, their attraction is to the opposite gender, which would be the 'other' gender compared to themselves. So if someone is a heterosexual male, opposite is female. So their fantasies involve the other gender. So the first part, the blank, is something they never involve. Oh wait, noâ€” the question says "never involve someone _________."

Wait, the question is phrased as "never involve someone..." So for heterosexuals, their fantasies never involve someone of the same gender. Because they are attracted to the opposite. So the first blank is same gender.

Similarly, for gays and lesbians, their fantasies never involve someone of the opposite gender.

Looking at the options, let's find which one matches.

Option A: other gender; same gender.

So first blank is other gender. So that would mean heterosexuals never involve other gender? That can't be right because they do involve the other gender. So option A is incorrect.

Option J: of the opposite gender; of the same gender.

Wait, no, let's check each option correctly.

Let me list the options:

Option A: other gender; same gender.

Option B: opposite gender; opposite gender.

Option C: same gender; same gender.

Option D: same gender; other gender.

Option E: other gender; other gender.

Option F: same gender; opposite gender.

Option G: Both may involve same or other.

Option H: Both involve same only.

Option I: Both involve opposite only.

Option J: opposite; same.

Wait, the correct answer would be that the first blank is same gender, the second is opposite gender.

So looking for an option where first blank is same, second is opposite.

Looking through the options:

Option D: same; other gender.

Wait, other gender is the same as opposite, right? Because "other" in this context refers to the opposite gender. So option D would be same gender and other gender.

Wait, no. Wait, the first part is for hetero: never involve same gender. The second part is for gay: never involve opposite gender.

So the blanks would be same and opposite.

Looking at the options, option D says same; other. If "other" is opposite, that would fit. So option D would be same; other.

But let me check the options again.

Option D: of the same gender; of the other gender.

Yes. So the first blank is same gender (hetero never involves same), the second is other (opposite) gender, which gay/lesbian never involve.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me confirm. The question is phrased as "heterosexual fantasies never involve someone...", so that someone would be of a gender they're not attracted to. So hetero: opposite is their attraction, so same is the one they never involve. Gay: same is their attraction, so opposite is the one they never involve.

So the blanks are same and opposite.

Looking at the options, option D is same; other. Since other is opposite, that's correct.

So the answer is D.

The question asks about the genders that heterosexual and gay/lesbian fantasies never involve. Heterosexual individuals are typically attracted to the opposite gender, so their fantasies never involve someone of the same gender. Similarly, gay and lesbian individuals are attracted to the same gender, so their fantasies never involve someone of the opposite gender. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice must reflect this logic: the first blank should be "of the same gender" (for heterosexual fantasies), and the second blank should be "of the other gender" (for gay and lesbian fantasies). Option D matches this reasoning, as it states "of the same gender; of the other gender."

Answer: D
