Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the change in volume of an aluminum sphere when it's heated from 0 to 300 degrees Celsius. Hmm, I remember that when materials are heated, they expand. So the volume will increase, and I need to calculate how much it increases by.

Alright, I think the formula for volume expansion is delta V equals beta times V times delta T. Beta is the coefficient of volume expansion, right? Wait, but sometimes I get confused with linear expansion. Oh yeah, the linear expansion coefficient alpha is for length, and beta is for volume. And I think the relationship is beta equals 3 times alpha because volume has three dimensions.

So first, I need to find the radius of the sphere. Oh wait, the radius is given as 5.0 cm. The initial temperature is 0°C, and it goes up to 300°C, so delta T is 300 degrees. 

But wait, what's the value of beta for aluminum? I'm not exactly sure of the exact number, but I remember that for aluminum, the linear expansion coefficient alpha is around 23e-6 per degree Celsius. So beta would be 3 times that, which is about 69e-6 per °C.

Wait, let me make sure I get the numbers right. I think alpha for aluminum is 23 x 10^-6 /°C. So beta is 3*23e-6 = 69e-6 /°C.

Now, the initial volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. The radius is 5 cm, so plugging that in:

V = (4/3)*π*(5)^3. Let's calculate that. 5 cubed is 125. (4/3)*π*125 is (500/3)*π. Since π is approximately 3.1416, let's compute 500/3 first. 500 divided by 3 is about 166.6667. Multiply by π gives roughly 166.6667 * 3.1416 ≈ 523.6 cm³. Wait, wait, wait, 500/3 is approximately 166.6667, and 166.6667 multiplied by 3.1416 is let's see:

166.6667 * 3 is about 500, 166.6667 * 0.1416 is about 23.56. So total is approximately 523.6 cm³. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I should use exact values or approximate here. Maybe I should keep it symbolic for more accurate calculation.

So delta V equals beta * V * delta T. Beta is 69e-6 /°C, V is (4/3)πr³, delta T is 300°C.

Putting it all together, delta V = 69e-6 * (4/3 π (5)^3) * 300.

Let me compute this step by step. First, compute (4/3)π(5)^3: that's (4/3)*π*125 = 500/3 * π ≈ 523.599 cm³ as I did before.

So delta V is 69e-6 * 523.599 * 300.

Compute 69e-6 * 300 first. 69e-6 is 0.000069. Multiply by 300 gives 0.0207.

Then multiply that by 523.599:

0.0207 * 523.599 ≈ let's compute 523.6 * 0.02 is 10.472, and 523.6 * 0.0007 is approximately 0.3665. So total is around 10.472 + 0.3665 ≈ 10.8385 cm³.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I make arithmetic errors. Alternatively, maybe using exact expressions would be better.

Alternatively, let's compute 69e-6 * 300 = 0.0207, then 0.0207 * (4/3 π (5)^3).

Wait, 5^3 is 125. So 4/3 * 125 is 500/3. So 500/3 * π is approximately 523.5988.

So 0.0207 * 523.5988 equals approximately (0.02 * 523.5988) + (0.0007 * 523.5988).

0.02 * 523.5988 is 10.471976.

0.0007 * 523.5988 is 0.36661916.

Adding them gives 10.471976 + 0.36661916 ≈ 10.838595 cm³.

So approximately 10.84 cm³. Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 10 cm³, but wait, another thought: perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, another way to compute 69e-6 * 523.5988 * 300.

Alternatively, 69e-6 is 6.9e-5. So 6.9e-5 * 523.5988 is 6.9 * 523.5988 * 1e-5.

Compute 6.9 * 523.5988: Let's see, 500*6.9 is 3450, 23.5988 *6.9 is about 162.914. So total is about 3450 + 162.914 = 3612.914. Then multiply by 1e-5 gives 0.03612914.

Then multiply by 300: 0.03612914 * 300 = 10.83842 cm³. So about 10.838 cm³. So approximately 10.84 cm³.

Looking at the options, the options are A:35, B:25, C:8, D:12, E:5, F:20, G:30, H:18, I:15, J:10.

Hmm, 10.84 is closest to option J:10. But wait, perhaps I made an error somewhere. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial volume calculation again. The radius is 5 cm, so the volume is (4/3)πr³.

r=5, so r³=125, (4/3)*125 = 500/3. 500/3 is approximately 166.6667. Multiply by π (3.1416), 166.6667 * 3.1416 ≈ 523.5988 cm³. That seems correct.

Beta is 3 * alpha, and alpha for aluminum is 23e-6 /°C, so beta is 69e-6. Correct.

So delta V = 69e-6 * 523.5988 * 300.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 69e-6 * 300 first. 69e-6 is 0.000069. 0.000069 * 300 = 0.0207.

Then 0.0207 * 523.5988 = let me compute this more accurately.

0.02 *523.5988 = 10.471976.

0.0007 *523.5988 = 0.366619.

Adding them gives 10.838595 cm³.

So about 10.84 cm³. The options don't have 10.84, but option J is 10, which is the closest. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use more precise values for alpha. Let me check: the linear expansion coefficient (alpha) for aluminum is about 22.2e-6 /°C, not 23. So beta would be 3 *22.2e-6 = 66.6e-6.

Let me recalculate with beta=66.6e-6.

Delta V =66.6e-6 * 523.5988 * 300.

Compute 66.6e-6 * 300 = 66.6 * 300 *1e-6 = 19980e-6 = 0.01998.

Then 0.01998 *523.5988 = let's compute that.

0.01998 * 500 = 9.99.

0.01998 *23.5988 = approximately 0.01998 *23 = 0.45954; 0.01998 *0.5988≈0.01196.

So total is 9.99 + 0.45954 + 0.01196 ≈ 10.4615 cm³.

Hmm, that's about 10.46 cm³, which is still close to 10. So perhaps the correct answer is option J:10 cm³.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me compute with more precise numbers. Let me compute 66.6e-6 * 523.5988 * 300.

Compute each step:

First, 66.6e-6 is 0.0000666.

Multiply by 300: 0.0000666 *300 = 0.01998.

Then multiply by 523.5988: 0.01998 *523.5988.

Let me compute this as:

= (0.01 *523.5988) + (0.00998 *523.5988)
= 5.235988 + (approx 0.00998 *523.5988)
Compute 0.00998 *523.5988:

523.5988 * 0.01 =5.235988
So 0.00998 is 0.01 - 0.00002, so 5.235988 - (523.5988 *0.00002) = 5.235988 - 0.010479776 ≈5.225508.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps a better way: 0.00998 = 0.01 - 0.00002.

So 0.00998 *523.5988 = 0.01*523.5988 - 0.00002*523.5988.

0.01 *523.5988 =5.235988.

0.00002*523.5988=0.010479776.

So subtracting, 5.235988 - 0.010479776≈5.225508224.

So the total is 5.235988 (from 0.01) +5.225508224 (from 0.00998) =10.461496 cm³.

So approximately 10.46 cm³, which is about 10.5 cm³. But the options don't have a 10.5; the closest is J:10 cm³. However, perhaps the initial approximation of beta being 23e-6 was correct, leading to around 10.8 cm³, which is still closest to J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise numbers. Let me check the exact value of alpha for aluminum. Maybe I can look it up in my memory. Oh wait, I think alpha for aluminum is 22.2e-6 /°C, so beta is 66.6e-6. Using that, the result is 10.46 cm³, which is approximately 10.5 cm³. But the options only go to J:10. So perhaps the intended answer is J:10 cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using beta= 6.0e-5 (which is 60e-6). Wait, that would make sense if alpha is 20e-6, then beta=60e-6. Let me try that.

If beta is 60e-6, then delta V =60e-6 *523.5988 *300.

Compute 60e-6 *300 = 0.018.

0.018 *523.5988 =0.018 *500=9, 0.018 *23.5988≈0.42475.

Total is 9 + 0.42475≈9.42475 cm³, which is around 9.42 and closer to 9.5. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the intended answer is J:10.

Alternatively, perhaps I should redo the calculations with more precise steps.

Let me compute delta V step by step:

Given:
r =5 cm
T_initial=0°C
T_final=300°C
delta T=300°C
alpha for Al=23e-6 /°C
beta=3*alpha=69e-6 /°C

Volume V=(4/3)πr³ = (4/3)*π*(5)^3= (4/3)*π*125=500/3 * π ≈166.6667 *3.1415927 ≈523.5988 cm³.

delta V= beta * V * delta T =69e-6 *523.5988 *300.

Compute 69e-6 *300=69*300 *1e-6=20700 *1e-6=0.0207.

Then 0.0207 *523.5988.

Compute 0.02 *523.5988 =10.471976.

0.0007 *523.5988=0.36661916.

Adding gives 10.471976 + 0.36661916=10.838595≈10.84 cm³.

Hmm, so that's about 10.84 cm³, which is closest to option J:10, but perhaps the options have rounded to the nearest 5, making 10 the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the coefficient. Let me double-check the coefficient of expansion.

Wait, I'm pretty sure that the linear expansion coefficient for aluminum is about 23e-6 /°C. So beta=69e-6 is correct. So delta V is about 10.84 cm³. So the correct answer would be around 10.84, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is J:10.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use beta as 72e-6, but that would be for a different material. No, I think I must proceed with the calculation as is.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the radius. The radius is 5 cm, so the diameter is 10 cm. But for volume, radius is what's used, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using exact numbers without approximations.

Let me compute delta V precisely.

delta V = beta * V * delta T.

beta=69e-6 /°C.

V= (4/3)π(5)^3= (500/3)π cm³.

delta T=300°C.

So,

delta V=69e-6 * (500/3)π *300.

Compute each part:

First, 500/3 ≈166.6667.

Multiply by 300: 166.6667 *300=50000.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 69e-6 * (500/3)π *300.

Let me compute 69e-6 *300 = 0.0207.

Then, multiply by (500/3)π.

So, 0.0207 * (500/3)π.

500/3 is approximately 166.6667.

So 0.0207 *166.6667 = approx 3.456 (since 0.02 *166.6667=3.3333, 0.0007*166.6667≈0.116666; total ≈3.45).

Then multiply by π: 3.45 *3.1416≈10.837 cm³.

So again, it's around 10.84 cm³.

Looking at the options, the closest is J:10. So perhaps the intended answer is J.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula used is the linear expansion formula, but that's for length. For volume, it's area expansion times length or using beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the volume expansion coefficient as 0.000069 (which is 69e-6). So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the answer should be approximately 10.8 cm³, but since it's not an option, the closest is J:10.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute 69e-6 *523.5988 *300.

Compute 69 * 523.5988 = let's see:

523.5988 *70=36,651.916, subtract 523.5988 to get 69 *523.5988.

36,651.916 - 523.5988=36,128.3172.

So 69 *523.5988=36,128.3172.

Then multiply by 1e-6 *300: that's 36,128.3172 *300 *1e-6.

36,128.3172 *300=10,838,495.16.

Multiply by 1e-6: 10,838,495.16e-6=10.838495 cm³.

So that's precise: 10.8385 cm³.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is J:10.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the change in volume is approx 10.8 cm³, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct choice is J:10 cm³.

To determine the change in volume of an aluminum sphere when heated from 0°C to 300°C, we use the formula for thermal volume expansion:

\[
\Delta V = \beta \cdot V \cdot \Delta T
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- Radius of the sphere: \( r = 5.0 \, \text{cm} \)
- Temperature change: \( \Delta T = 300^\circ \text{C} \)
- Coefficient of linear expansion for aluminum: \( \alpha = 23 \times 10^{-6} \, ^\circ \text{C}^{-1} \)
- Coefficient of volume expansion: \( \beta = 3 \alpha = 69 \times 10^{-6} \, ^\circ \text{C}^{-1} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the initial volume of the sphere
The volume of a sphere is given by:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]

Substituting \( r = 5.0 \, \text{cm} \):

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (5)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (125) = \frac{500}{3} \pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[
V \approx \frac{500}{3} \cdot 3.1416 \approx 523.6 \, \text{cm
