Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and charges. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

The question says there's an electric field near Earth's surface pointing downward with a magnitude of about 150 N/C. We need to float a sulfur sphere that weighs 4.4 N by charging it. I have to find the right charge, both the magnitude and the sign.

Wait, right. So floating means the forces balance out. The sphere will experience two forces: the gravitational force pulling it down and the electric force pushing it up, or vice versa, depending on the charge.

Wait, gravitational force is the weight, which is 4.4 N downward. To float, the electric force must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the electric force needs to be 4.4 N upward.

Electric force is given by F = qE. But wait, I have to consider the direction. Since the electric field is downward, the force on a positive charge would be in the same direction as the field. So if E is down, then a positive charge would feel a force down, and a negative charge would feel a force up.

Oh right, because F = qE. So if q is negative, F would be opposite to E. So to get an upward force, the charge must be negative. Because then the electric force would be against the field direction.

So the magnitude is such that qE equals the weight, but in opposite direction. Let me write that down.

The electric force F must be equal to the weight, but in the opposite direction. So F = 4.4 N upward. But F = |q| * E, because the direction is determined by the sign of q.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The electric force is qE. Since E is downward, if q is negative, then F is upward. So the magnitude is |q| * E = 4.4 N.

So setting up the equation: |q| * 150 N/C = 4.4 N.

Solving for |q|: q = 4.4 / 150. Let me compute that.

4.4 divided by 150. Hmm, 150 goes into 4.4 how many times? 150 * 0.029 is 4.35, because 150 * 0.03 is 4.5, which is a bit more than 4.4. Wait, let me calculate it properly.

4.4 / 150 = ?

Well, 150 * 0.029 is 4.35. 4.4 - 4.35 is 0.05. So 0.05 is 0.000333... in terms of 150. So 0.05/150 is approximately 0.000333, but wait, that's not right. Wait, 150 * 0.000333 is about 0.05.

Wait, no, perhaps a better way: 4.4 / 150 = 0.029333... approximately 0.02933 C.

So |q| is approximately 0.0293 C. Since the force needs to be upward, the charge must be negative. So the charge is -0.0293 C.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are:

E: 0.029 C

J: -0.029 C

So the correct answer is J.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. 150 multiplied by 0.0293 is 4.395, which is a bit more than 4.4? No, wait, wait. 150 * 0.0293 is (150 * 0.02) + (150 * 0.0093) = 3 + 1.395 = 4.395 N. Oh wait, 4.395 is just under 4.4, so maybe a more precise calculation is needed.

Alternatively, 4.4 / 150 = 0.029333... So 0.029333 C. But the options have 0.029 C (option E) as positive, and J is -0.029 C.

So the magnitude is approximately 0.0293 C, which matches option E or J, but considering the sign, it's negative, so J.

But wait, another thought. Maybe the exact value is 4.4 / 150. Let me compute that precisely.

4.4 divided by 150.

150 goes into 4.4 zero times. Add a decimal: 44.0 divided by 150.

Wait, 150 * 0.02 is 3.0, so 0.029 is 4.35, as before. So 4.4 is 0.029333... So 0.0293 C. So the closest option is E (0.029) but positive, or J (-0.029).

So yeah, the correct charge is negative, so J is the answer.

To solve the problem, we need to balance the gravitational force acting on the sulfur sphere with the electric force. The gravitational force (weight) is given as \( F_g = 4.4 \, \mathrm{N} \) downward. To float, the electric force \( F_e \) must be equal in magnitude (\( 4.4 \, \mathrm{N} \)) but opposite in direction (upward).

The electric force is given by \( F_e = |q| \cdot E \), where \( E = 150 \, \mathrm{N/C} \) is the magnitude of the electric field. Setting \( F_e = F_g \), we have:

\[
|q| \cdot 150 = 4.4
\]

Solving for \( |q| \):

\[
|q| = \frac{4.4}{150} \approx 0.0293 \, \mathrm{C}
\]

The direction of the electric field is downward, so to produce an upward electric force, the charge \( q \) must be negative. Thus, the required charge is \( q = -0.0293 \, \mathrm{C} \).

From the given options, the closest match is \( q = -0.029 \, \mathrm{C} \), which corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
