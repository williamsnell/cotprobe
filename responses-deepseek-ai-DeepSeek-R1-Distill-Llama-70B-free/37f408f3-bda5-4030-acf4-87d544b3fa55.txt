Okay, I'm trying to solve this economics problem about cost functions and productivity. Hmm, I remember that productivity in this context refers to marginal productivity, which is related to how the cost changes as output increases. So the question is about determining whether each product's production is under conditions of constant, increasing, or decreasing productivity.

Each product has a total cost function, and I think I need to find the marginal cost function for each. Marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost with respect to output X. And from the marginal cost, I can determine the productivity trend.

Let me start with Product A. Its total cost is 56 + 2X. So the derivative of that would be d(TC)/dX = 2. Since this is a constant, the marginal cost is constant. So Product A has constant marginal costs. If marginal productivity is constant, then productivity is constant. So Product A is constant.

Next, Product B's total cost is 56 + 2X + 4X². Taking the derivative, that's d(TC)/dX = 2 + 8X. So the marginal cost increases as X increases because the derivative is positive and increasing (since the second derivative is 8, which is positive). Wait, wait. Wait, no: marginal cost is increasing because as X increases, MC goes up. But what does that say about productivity? Oh right, marginal productivity is inversely related to marginal cost. So if MC is increasing, that implies diminishing marginal productivity, which is decreasing productivity. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. I might be getting this mixed up.

I think when marginal cost is rising, it's because each additional unit is more costly, which suggests that marginal productivity is decreasing. Because if you have to pay more for each extra unit, it's harder to produce each additional unit, so productivity is decreasing. So for Product B, since MC is increasing (as X increases), productivity is decreasing.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the marginal cost is increasing, it means that each additional unit is more expensive to produce. That implies that the firm is experiencing diminishing returns, so marginal productivity is decreasing. Because when you have diminishing returns, each additional worker adds less output. So higher MC (as X increases) corresponds to lower productivity gains, so productivity is decreasing. So Product B has decreasing productivity.

Wait wait, no. Wait, Product B's MC is 2 + 8X. So as X increases, MC increases. So the cost of producing each additional unit is rising. Which would mean that it's becoming harder to produce more, so productivity is decreasing. So yes, Product B has decreasing productivity.

Now Product C's total cost is 56 + 2X -4X². Taking the derivative: d(TC)/dX = 2 -8X. So the marginal cost is 2 -8X. Hmm, as X increases, the MC decreases because each additional X subtracts more. For example, at X=0, MC is 2. At X=1, MC is 2-8= -6? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, negative marginal cost? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, wait, negative MC would imply that producing more reduces cost, which might not be realistic, but perhaps in this problem, it's possible.

But how does this relate to productivity? So the MC is 2-8X. Let's think about the behavior. As X increases, MC becomes lower. So each additional unit is cheaper to produce. That suggests that the firm is experiencing increasing marginal productivity because each additional unit adds more (but wait, that seems conflicting). Wait, no. Wait, marginal cost is the cost of the next unit. If MC is falling as X increases, that implies that each additional unit is cheaper. So the firm is getting more efficient as it produces more. So that would mean increasing productivity because as you produce more, each unit is cheaper, so your productivity is increasing.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let's think: if marginal cost is decreasing as output increases, then the firm is becoming more efficient. So marginal productivity is increasing—each additional unit adds more than the previous. So Product C would have increasing productivity.

Wait, but let me get this straight. Let's relate MC to productivity. In production, the marginal product (MP) is the additional output per additional input. The marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost of producing one more unit. In a competitive market, firms set P = MC, but that's not directly relevant here.

But in terms of the relationship between MC and MP: MC is inversely related to the marginal product of labor (or the variable input). Because if MP is high, you get more output per additional input, so cost per additional unit (MC) is lower. So if MP is increasing, MC would be decreasing. So if MC is decreasing as X increases, that implies that MP is increasing, which means productivity is increasing.

So for Product C, MC is 2 -8X. As X increases, 8X becomes larger, so MC decreases. So as X increases, MC is falling, which implies that MP is rising. So Product C's productivity is increasing.

Wait, but let me think about the signs. Suppose X is a small number, say X=0. Then MC is 2. At X=0.25, MC= 2-8*(0.25) = 2-2=0. At X=0.3, MC=2-8*0.3=2-2.4= -0.4. Negative MC doesn't make much sense, but in the context of the problem, perhaps it's acceptable. But regardless, the trend is that as X increases, MC is decreasing.

So Product C has increasing productivity.

Now, let's summarize:

Product A: Constant MC → Constant productivity.

Product B: Increasing MC → Decreasing productivity.

Product C: Decreasing MC → Increasing productivity.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Product C. If the total cost function is 56 + 2X -4X^2, then the derivative is 2 -8X. So as X increases, the marginal cost decreases. So the more you produce, the cheaper each additional unit is. That implies that each additional unit is easier to produce than the last, which would mean increasing marginal productivity. So yes, Product C has increasing productivity.

Wait, but earlier I thought Product B's MC is increasing, which implies decreasing productivity, and Product C's MC is decreasing, implying increasing productivity.

But looking back at the options, let's check which options match.

Looking at the options:

The options are in the form Product A, Product B, Product C.

We have:

Product A: Constant

Product B: Decreasing

Product C: Increasing

Looking at the options:

Option G: Product A: constant, Product B: decreasing, Product C: increasing.

Wait, let's look at the options again. The options are:

A: A: decr, B: incr, C: const.

B: A: incr, B: const, C: decr.

C: A: incr, B: decr, C: const.

D: A: decr, B: decr, C: const.

E: A: const, B: const, C: decr.

F: A: incr, B: incr, C: decr.

G: A: const, B: decr, C: incr.

H: A: const, B: incr, C: decr.

I: A: decr, B: incr, C: incr.

J: A: decr, B: const, C: incr.

So the correct pattern is A: const, B: decr, C: incr. Which is option G.

So the correct answer is option G.

To determine whether the productivity of each product is constant, increasing, or decreasing, we analyze the total cost functions provided for Products A, B, and C. Productivity is inferred from the behavior of marginal cost (MC), which is the derivative of the total cost function with respect to the number of units produced (X). Here's the analysis:

### Product A: Total Cost = $56 + 2X  
- The marginal cost is calculated as the derivative of the total cost:  
  \[
  MC = \frac{d(TC)}{dX} = 2
  \]  
  Since the marginal cost is constant, the productivity is **constant**.

### Product B: Total Cost = $56 + 2X + 4X^2  
- The marginal cost is calculated as the derivative of the total cost:  
  \[
  MC = \frac{d(TC)}{dX} = 2 + 8X
  \]  
  As \(X\) increases, \(MC\) increases. Rising marginal cost indicates diminishing marginal productivity, meaning the productivity is **decreasing**.

### Product C: Total Cost = $56 + 2X - 4X^2  
- The marginal cost is calculated as the derivative of the total cost:  
  \[
  MC = \frac{d(TC)}{dX} = 2 - 8X
  \]  
  As \(X\) increases, \(MC\) decreases. Falling marginal cost indicates increasing marginal productivity, meaning the productivity is **increasing**.

### Summary of Results:
- **Product A**: Constant productivity  
- **Product B**: Decreasing productivity  
- **Product C**: Increasing productivity  

### Matching with Options:
The correct option that matches this pattern is **Option G**:  
- Product A: constant  
- Product B: decreasing  
- Product C: increasing
