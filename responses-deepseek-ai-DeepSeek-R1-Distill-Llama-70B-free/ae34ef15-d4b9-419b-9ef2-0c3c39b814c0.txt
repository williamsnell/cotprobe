Okay, so I've got this Fourier series problem to solve. Let's see what it says. The given function is f(t) expressed as an infinite sum from k equals negative infinity to positive infinity. The term inside the sum is (1)/(1 + jk) multiplied by e^{jkt}. And the question is to convert this into its trigonometric form. The options are A through I, each presenting a different trigonometric series.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Fourier series, but I remember that the exponential form can be converted to trigonometric form by combining terms. Oh right, because the exponential terms can be written using Euler's formula as cosines and sines.

So the general idea is that the Fourier series in exponential form is the sum over all integers k of c_k e^{jkt}, where c_k are the Fourier coefficients. To get the trigonometric form, we need to express this sum in terms of cosine and sine terms.

Wait, the given series is sum_{k=-infty}^{infty} [1/(1 + jk)] e^{jkt}. So, each term is a coefficient multiplied by a complex exponential.

I think the first step is to separate the sum into positive and negative k terms. Because when k is negative, e^{jkt} becomes e^{-j|k|t}, which can be written as cos(|k|t) - j sin(|k|t). Similarly for positive k, it's cos(kt) + j sin(kt).

But wait, the coefficients might complicate things. Let me think: for each k, the term is 1/(1 + jk) e^{jkt}. So when k is positive, it's 1/(1 + jk) e^{jkt}, and when k is negative, say k = -n where n is positive, then it's 1/(1 - jn) e^{-jnt}.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum by recognizing it as the sum of a geometric series or something else. Alternatively, perhaps computing the Fourier coefficients and then expressing them in terms of sine and cosine.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the sum by grouping terms for positive and negative k. Let me split the sum into k=0, k>0, and k<0.

When k=0: the term is 1/(1 + 0) e^{0} = 1. So that's just 1.

For k positive: sum_{k=1}^infty [1/(1 + jk)] e^{jkt}.

For k negative: Let me substitute k = -m where m >0. So the term becomes [1/(1 - jm)] e^{-jmt}.

So the entire sum is 1 + sum_{k=1}^infty [1/(1 + jk) e^{jkt} + 1/(1 - jk) e^{-jkt} }.

Wait, 1/(1 - jk) is the same as 1/(1 + j(-k)), so when k is positive, 1/(1 - jk) would be 1/(1 - jk) = [1 + jk]/(1 +k^2) because multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + jk):

(1/(1 - jk)) = (1 + jk)/( (1)^2 + (k)^2 ) ) = (1 + jk)/(1 + k²).

Wait, wait. Let me compute 1/(1 + jk) + 1/(1 - jk). Let's compute this sum.

1/(1+jk) + 1/(1-jk) = [ (1-jk) + (1+jk) ] / ( (1 +jk)(1-jk) )

The numerator is 2, denominator is 1 + (jk)^2 = 1 + j²k² = 1 - k² (since j² = -1).

Wait, that can't be right because (1 + jk)(1-jk) = 1 - (jk)^2 = 1 - (-k²) = 1 + k².

Wait, no: (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Here, a is 1, b is jk. So (1)^2 - (jk)^2 = 1 - j²k². Since j² is -1, this becomes 1 - (-1)k² = 1 + k².

So the sum becomes 2 / (1 +k²).

Wait, but that's just the sum of the coefficients. But each term is multiplied by e^{jkt} and e^{-jkt} respectively.

Wait, no. Let me correct. For each positive k, the term is [1/(1+jk)] e^{jkt} + [1/(1-jk)] e^{-jkt}.

So substituting 1/(1-jk) as (1 + jk)/(1 +k²):

So each pair becomes:

[ (1/(1+jk)) e^{jkt} + (1/(1-jk)) e^{-jkt} ]

= [ (1 - jk)/( (1 + jk)(1 - jk) ) ) e^{jkt} + (1 + jk)/( (1 +jk)(1-jk) ) ) e^{-jkt} ]

Wait, no, perhaps an easier approach is to express each term as [1/(1+jk)] e^{jkt} + [1/(1-jk)] e^{-jkt}.

But let me compute this:

Let me write 1/(1 + jk) as (1 - jk)/(1 +k²), because multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - jk):

1/(1 + jk) = (1 - jk)/( (1 +jk)(1-jk) ) ) = (1-jk)/(1 +k²).

Similarly, 1/(1 -jk) = (1 + jk)/(1 +k²).

So each term becomes:

(1 - jk)/(1 +k²) * e^{jkt} + (1 + jk)/(1 +k²) * e^{-jkt}.

Factor out 1/(1 +k²):

[ (1 - jk) e^{jkt} + (1 + jk) e^{-jkt} ] / (1 +k²).

Let me expand the numerator:

(1 - jk) e^{jkt} = e^{jkt} - jk e^{jkt}.

Similarly, (1 + jk) e^{-jkt} = e^{-jkt} + jk e^{-jkt}.

Adding them together:

e^{jkt} + e^{-jkt} - jk e^{jkt} + jk e^{-jkt}.

Now, group terms:

[e^{jkt} + e^{-jkt}] + jk [ -e^{jkt} + e^{-jkt} ].

We know that e^{jkt} + e^{-jkt} = 2 cos(kt).

And -e^{jkt} + e^{-jkt} = -2j sin(kt), because e^{jθ} - e^{-jθ} = 2j sinθ, so -(e^{jθ} - e^{-jθ}) = -2j sinθ. Wait, wait:

Wait, e^{jkt} - e^{-jkt} = 2j sin(kt). So - (e^{jkt} - e^{-jkt}) ) = -2j sin(kt). Therefore:

The numerator becomes 2 cos(kt) + jk * (-2j sin(kt)).

Wait, jk * (-2j sin kt) = (-2j^2 k sin kt) = since j^2 = -1, this becomes 2k sin kt.

So numerator is 2 cos(kt) + 2k sin(kt).

So the entire term becomes [2 cos(kt) + 2k sin(kt)] / (1 +k²).

So putting it all together, the sum for k from 1 to infinity of these terms is sum [ (2 cos(kt) + 2k sin(kt)) / (1 +k²) ].

Wait, but the original sum was for k from negative infinity to positive infinity, and we split it into k=0, and k positive and negative. Wait no, I think I already included the k=0 term as 1, and then for each positive k, we have the sum as (2 cos(kt) + 2k sin(kt))/(1 +k²).

Wait, no. In my earlier steps, I considered the sum from k=1 to infinity of [ terms for k and -k ], which when added to the k=0 term (which is 1) gives the entire f(t).

Wait, let me be precise. The original sum is sum_{k=-infty}^{infty} [1/(1+jk)] e^{jkt}.

We split this into three parts: k=0, k positive, and k negative.

The k=0 term is 1/(1+0) * e^0 = 1.

For k positive, the terms are [1/(1+jk)] e^{jkt} and [1/(1-jk)] e^{-jkt}.

So for each positive k, the sum is [1/(1+jk)] e^{jkt} + [1/(1-jk)] e^{-jkt}.

Which, as we computed, becomes [2 cos(kt) + 2k sin(kt)]/(1 +k²).

So for each positive k, that's the contribution. So the entire sum would be 1 plus the sum from k=1 to infinity of [ (2 cos(kt) + 2k sin(kt)) / (1 +k²) ].

Wait, but that would make the entire f(t) equal to 1 + sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (2 cos(kt) + 2k sin(kt)) / (1 + k²) ].

Alternatively, factor out the 2:

1 + 2 sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (cos(kt) + k sin(kt)) / (1 + k^2) ].

Looking at the options, let me check which one matches.

Option D is: 1 + 2 sum_{k=1}^\infty [ (cos kt + k sin kt)/(1 +k^2) ].

Yes, that matches what I derived.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: f(t) =1 + 2 sum_{k=1}^infty [ (cos kt +k sin kt)/(1 +k^2) ].

Yes, that's exactly what I have here.

So the correct answer would be option D.

To convert the given Fourier series 

\[
f(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + jk} e^{jkt}
\]

into trigonometric form, we start by splitting the sum into three parts: \(k=0\), \(k>0\), and \(k<0\). 

1. **For \(k=0\):**  
   The term is \(\frac{1}{1 + j(0)} e^{j(0)t} = 1\).

2. **For \(k>0\):**  
   The terms are \(\frac{1}{1 + jk} e^{jkt}\) and \(\frac{1}{1 - jk} e^{-jkt}\). Using the fact that \(\frac{1}{1 + jk} = \frac{1 - jk}{1 + k^2}\) and \(\frac{1}{1 - jk} = \frac{1 + jk}{1 + k^2}\), we combine these terms:

   \[
   \frac{1}{1 + jk} e^{jkt} + \frac{1}{1 - jk} e^{-jkt} = \frac{(1 - jk)e^{jkt} + (1 + jk)e^{-jkt}}{1 + k^2}.
   \]

   Expanding the numerator:

   \[
   (1 - jk)e^{jkt} + (1 + jk)e^{-jkt} = e^{jkt} + e^{-jkt} - jk(e^{jkt} - e^{-jkt}).
   \]

   Using Euler's formula, \(e^{jkt} + e^{-jkt} = 2\cos(kt)\) and \(e^{jkt} - e^{-jkt} = 2j\sin(kt)\), the numerator becomes:

   \[
   2\cos(kt) + 2k\sin(kt).
   \]

   Thus, the combined term is:

   \[
   \frac{2\cos(kt) + 2k\sin(kt)}{1 + k^2}.
   \]

3. **Summing over \(k>0\):**  
   The total contribution from \(k>0\) is:

   \[
   \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2\cos(kt) + 2k\sin(kt)}{1 + k^2}.
   \]

4. **Combining all parts:**  
   Adding the \(k=0\) term (1) and the \(k>0\) terms, the trigonometric form of \(f(t)\) is:

   \[
   f(t) = 1 + 2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(kt) + k\sin(kt)}{1 + k^2}.
   \]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: \(f(t) = 1 + 2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(kt) + k\sin(kt)}{1 + k^2}\).**
