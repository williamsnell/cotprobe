Okay, so I've got this question here about estimating the mass transfer coefficient for liquid ammonia evaporating into air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the evaporation is happening at 80°F and 1 atm. The heat transfer coefficient given is 810 Btu/hr·ft²·°F under the same conditions. I remember that there's a relationship between heat and mass transfer coefficients, probably involving some properties of the fluids involved.

Wait, right! The key here is the analogy between heat and mass transfer. I think the Lewis analogy might be what I need here. From what I recall, the Lewis equation relates the mass transfer coefficient (k_g) to the heat transfer coefficient (h) using the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to the thermal diffusivity, or something like that. 

The formula I think is k_g = h / (c_p * (Le)^0.5), but wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Alternatively, I remember that the mass transfer coefficient can be found using the Chilton-Colburn analogy. Oh wait, the Colburn analogy uses the relation between the Stanton numbers for heat and mass transfer. 

The Colburn analogy says that (St_m) = (St_h) * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3), where St is the Stanton number. But I'm not sure if I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, the mass transfer coefficient might be calculated using k_g = (h * D)/(k * Sc), but that doesn't directly help without more info.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use the relation k_g = h * (D / k) / (c_p * (Sc / Pr)^(1/3)) ), but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should think about the formula differently. Oh wait, I think the formula is k_g = (h / c_p) * (D / α)^(1/3), where D is the diffusion coefficient of ammonia in air, and α is the thermal diffusivity of air. But I don't have the values for D and α. 

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the fact that the Lewis number (Le) is the ratio of the thermal diffusivity to the mass diffusivity, Le = α/D. So if I have the Lewis number, I can relate h and k_g. 

I think another approach is to use the equation k_g = h / (c_p * (Le)^(1/3)) ). But I'm not entirely certain about this. Alternatively, I've heard that the mass transfer coefficient can be approximated as k_g = h / (c_p * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3)) ), since Sc is the Schmidt number (Sc = μ/(ρD)) and Pr is the Prandtl number (Pr = μ c_p /k). So Sc/Pr = (μ/(ρD)) / (μ c_p /k) ) = k/(ρ c_p D). Hmm, maybe I'm getting too deep into the properties without knowing their values.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula again. Oh right, the Chilton-Colburn analogy for mass transfer is j_m = j_h * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3). The j factors are the Colburn factors, which are dimensionless. The j_h for heat is h / (c_p * G * c), where G is the mass flow rate per area, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, the Stanton number for mass transfer (St_m) is (k_g * c_p) / h. But I'm getting myself confused. Wait, the Chilton-Colburn analogy says that j_m = j_h * (Sc/Pr)^(1/3), and j_m is St_m * Pr^(2/3) and j_h is St_h * Pr^(2/3). Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.

Wait, another approach: the relation between mass and heat transfer coefficients is given by the equation:

k_g = (h) / (c_p) * (D / α)^(1/3)

But I don't have D or α, so maybe I need to assume that the Lewis number (Le) is 1, but that's only true for certain conditions. Wait, Le = α/D. If Le is approximately 1, then D = α, so (D/α)^(1/3) is 1. But I don't know if that's a valid assumption here.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for gases, the Lewis number is around 1, but I'm not certain. Let's think: ammonia in air at 80°F. Air's thermal diffusivity at around 80°F (which is about 26°C) is roughly 0.22 cm²/s. The diffusion coefficient of ammonia in air is about 0.23 cm²/s at 25°C. Wait, that would make Le = α/D ≈ 0.22 / 0.23 ≈ 0.96, which is close to 1. So perhaps for this problem, Le is approximately 1, so (Le)^(1/3) is about 1.

If that's the case, then the formula simplifies to k_g = h / (c_p)

Wait, but what's c_p here? Is it the specific heat at constant pressure of the gas? So, if the gas is air, then c_p for air is about 0.24 BTU/lb·°F. Wait, or is it per mole? Hmm, no, I think it's per unit mass. So if we're using the units correctly, perhaps it's 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F).

Wait, but the heat transfer coefficient h is given in BTU/hr·ft²·°F, and we need to find the mass transfer coefficient k_g in lb moles/hr·ft²·atm. So the units need to work out.

Let me write down the formula again. If Le is 1, then k_g = h / (c_p). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's k_g = h / (c_p * (Le)^(1/3)) ), which would be h/c_p if Le is 1.

So with h = 810 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F), and c_p of air is 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). Wait, but wait, I'm mixing units. Because k_g is in lb moles/(hr·ft²·atm), I need to make sure the units work.

Wait, what's the correct formula? Another approach: the mass transfer coefficient can be calculated using the equation:

k_g = (h) * (M) / (c_p * R * T)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between the heat transfer and mass transfer coefficients through the Lewis number.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula that directly relates h to k_g using the specific heat and molecular weight. 

Another thought: the mass transfer coefficient (k_g) for a gas can be estimated using the heat transfer coefficient (h) with the formula:

k_g = h/(c_p) * (M)/(R T)

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

k_g = (h * D) / (k * (1 + (M1/M2))) 

But I don't have D or k here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the mass transfer coefficient can be found using the equation:

k_g = (h) / (c_p) * (1 / (R T))^{1/3} ?

No, I'm not confident about that. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the basic approach.

In the analogy between heat and mass transfer, the key is to relate the two using the properties of the substances. The basic idea is that the mass transfer coefficient k_g can be found from the heat transfer coefficient h using the formula:

k_g = h / (c_p) * (D / α)^(1/3)

But without knowing D and α, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that D/α is 1, making (D/α)^(1/3) equal to 1. Then k_g = h / c_p.

Wait, but what's c_p in this case? Is it the specific heat of the gas (air) or the specific heat of the vapor (ammonia)? Hmm, I'm not sure. Because the evaporation is ammonia into air, so the surrounding fluid is air, so perhaps c_p is that of air.

Assuming that, c_p for air is approximately 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F). So h is 810, so k_g would be 810 / 0.24. Let's calculate that: 810 / 0.24 = 3375 lb/(hr·ft²·°F). Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. The options are in lb moles/(hr·ft²·atm), not lb mass.

Oh wait, so I'm missing something here. Because the mass transfer coefficient has units involving moles, I probably need to account for the molecular weight of ammonia. Oh, right! Because when dealing with molar transfer, you have to consider the molar mass.

So perhaps the correct formula includes the molecular weight. Let me think. The mass transfer coefficient in molar terms would involve the molecular weight. Maybe the formula is:

k_g (molar) = k_g (mass) / M

Where M is the molecular weight in lb per mole.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula might be:

k_g = (h / (c_p)) * (1 / (M)) * (something else?)

Wait, maybe I should think about the units. The heat transfer coefficient h has units of BTU/(hr·ft²·°F). The mass transfer coefficient in molar terms has units of lb-mole/(hr·ft²·atm).

So, the formula to get from h to k_g (molar) would need to include factors that account for the conversion between heat and mass, which involves the molar enthalpy (like latent heat), but since this is mass transfer, maybe it's the molar concentration and diffusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

k_g = (h * M) / (c_p * R * T)

Where M is the molecular weight, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in absolute units.

Wait, let me think about the units. h has units of [energy/(time·area·temperature)]. Let's get the units right.

h is in BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

To get k_g in lb-mole/(hr·ft²·atm), we need to convert h into terms involving moles.

Considering that the latent heat of vaporization (which I don't have here) is involved, but in this problem, it's about mass transfer, not heat required for phase change. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation that involves the specific heat and molecular weight. Let me try to write the formula step by step.

The heat transfer coefficient h is related to the mass transfer coefficient k_g through the formula:

h = k_g * M * c_p * (R T / p)

Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, considering the analogy, the mass transfer can be linked via:

k_g = (h) / (c_p) * (1 / (M)) * (something with R and T?)

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula in terms of the Schmidt and Prandtl numbers.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. There's a formula that relates the mass transfer coefficient to the heat transfer coefficient using the specific heat, molecular weight, and the gas constant.

The formula is:

k_g = (h) / (c_p) * (M) / (R T)

Wait, let me check the units. h is BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

c_p is BTU/(lb·°F).

M is lb per lb-mole (since M is molecular weight in lb/lb-mole).

R is in BTU/(lb-mole·R·°F). Wait, no. The gas constant R for air is about 53.35 ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R), but that's not matching the units. Alternatively, R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mole·R).

Wait, maybe I'm getting the units wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should use R in consistent units with h and c_p.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a formula that directly gives k_g from h.

I found online that a common approach is to use the formula:

k_g = (h / (c_p)) * (D / α)^(1/3) * (M / (R T))

Wait, but without knowing D and α, maybe the problem expects me to use an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the Lewis number Le is equal to 1, so (D/α)^(1/3) is 1, and thus k_g = h/(c_p) * M/(R T).

Wait, but then I have to find M, R, and T.

M for ammonia is 17.031 lb/lb-mole.

R is the universal gas constant, but in units that match. Let's see, R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mole·R), but I need to convert it into BTU units.

Hmm, 1 BTU is approximately 778 ft·lbf. So R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mole·R). Since 1 psi = 1 lbf/in², and 1 ft² = 144 in², so 1 psi·ft³ = 144 lbf·ft³. Wait, no, 1 psi is 1 lbf per square inch, so 1 psi·ft³ = 1 lbf/in² * 144 in²/ft² * ft³ = 144 lbf·ft.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to convert R into BTU units. Alternatively, perhaps using R as 1.986 cal/(mol·K), but I'm getting too deep into unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. So, at standard conditions, but we're at 80°F and 1 atm.

Wait, perhaps T is in absolute units. 80°F is 300 K (approximately, because 80°F is (80 + 459.67) = 539.67 R, which is about 300 K).

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should accept that without knowing exact property values, the problem expects me to make an approximation. Let's try plugging in the numbers.

Assuming that k_g = h/(c_p) * (M)/(R T).

h = 810 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F).

c_p for air is 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F).

M for ammonia is 17.031 lb/lb-mole.

R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mole·R). But I'm not sure if that's the right R. Alternatively, R is 1.986 BTU/(lb-mole·R)·something. Wait, no, R is 1.986 cal/(mol·K), but I need to convert that into BTU units.

Wait, 1 BTU is about 778.169 ft·lbf, and 1 cal is about 4.184 joules. So, 1.986 cal/(mol·K) is approximately 1.986 * 4.184 J/(mol·K) = about 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is the standard value for R. So 8.314 J/(mol·K) is 8.314 (m³·Pa)/(mol·K), but I'm not sure how that translates to the units I need.

Alternatively, perhaps R for ammonia in air is taken as 0.73 times the universal gas constant. Wait, no, that's for the specific gas constant. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Let's try to proceed with the formula as k_g = h/(c_p) * (M)/(R T), using R as the universal gas constant in appropriate units.

M = 17.031 lb/lbmol.

R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Let me convert R into BTU units. Since 1 psi·ft³ is 1 lbf·ft² * ft³ = ft·lbf. And 1 BTU is 778.169 ft·lbf. So 1 psi·ft³ = 778.169 / 144 BTU approximately? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find R in units of BTU/(lbmol·R).

Wait, the universal gas constant R is approximately 1.986 BTU/(lbmol·R). So R = 1.986 BTU/(lbmol·R).

Wait, I'm getting this from a table: R for air is about 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Let me convert that to BTU.

1 psi·ft³ = 1 lbf·ft² * ft³ = ft·lbf. 1 BTU = 778.169 ft·lbf. So 1 psi·ft³ = 1/778.169 BTU.

So R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) = 10.7316 / 778.169 BTU/(lbmol·R) ≈ 0.0138 BTU/(lbmol·R).

Wait, that seems too small. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in unit conversion. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use R = 0.7302 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) for ammonia. Wait, no, ammonia has a specific gas constant, but the surrounding is air. Hmm, perhaps I should use R as 0.7302 for ammonia, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try plugging in the numbers:

k_g = (h / c_p) * (M) / (R * T)

h = 810 BTU/(hr·ft²·°F)
c_p = 0.24 BTU/(lb·°F)
M = 17.031 lb/lbmol
R = 1.986 BTU/(lbmol·R) (if that's correct)
T = 80°F = 539.67 R

So plugging in:

k_g = (810 / 0.24) * (17.031) / (1.986 * 539
