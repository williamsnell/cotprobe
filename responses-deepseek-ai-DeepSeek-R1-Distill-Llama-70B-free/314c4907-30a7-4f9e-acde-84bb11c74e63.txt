Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 2.16 divided by 0.06. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on division with decimals, but let's see if I can work this out.

First, I remember that dividing decimals can be tricky, but maybe I can convert them into whole numbers to make it easier. How do I do that? Oh right, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same power of ten until both become whole numbers. 

So the problem is 2.16 ÷ 0.06. Let me count the decimal places. 2.16 has two decimal places, and 0.06 has two as well. Wait, no, 0.06 has two decimal places? Let me check: 0 is the units place, then 0 is tenths, 6 is hundredths. So yes, two decimal places for both.

But wait, another approach: I can adjust the divisor so that it becomes a whole number. To turn 0.06 into a whole number, I need to multiply it by 100 because it's two decimal places. So I multiply both numerator and denominator by 100. 

So 2.16 * 100 is 216, and 0.06 * 100 is 6. Now the problem becomes 216 ÷ 6. Oh, that's easier. 

What's 216 divided by 6? Let me think. 6 times 30 is 180. 216 minus 180 is 36. 36 divided by 6 is 6. So 30 plus 6 is 36. So 216 ÷ 6 equals 36. 

So the quotient is 36. Looking at the options, H is 36. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I could approach this by moving the decimal points. When I divide by a decimal, I can make the divisor a whole number by moving the decimal. So 0.06 becomes 6 after moving two places. But I have to remember to move the decimal in the dividend the same number of places. So 2.16 becomes 216 when I move two places. Then 216 ÷ 6 is 36. Yep, same result.

Another way: Let's think in terms of fractions. 2.16 is the same as 216/100, and 0.06 is 6/100. So dividing them is (216/100) ÷ (6/100). That's the same as (216/100) * (100/6). The 100s cancel out, so 216 ÷ 6 is 36. Yep, same answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake with the decimal places. Sometimes I get confused with how many places to move. So another approach: how many times does 0.06 go into 2.16?

Well, 0.06 times 30 is 1.8, and 0.06 times 36 is 2.16. Oh, right, because 0.06 * 30 is 1.80, and 0.06 * 6 is 0.36, adding up to 2.16. So 30 +6=36. That checks out.

So I'm confident the answer is 36, which is option H.

The problem is to find the quotient of 2.16 ÷ 0.06. To simplify the division of decimals, both the numerator and the denominator can be converted into whole numbers by multiplying by 100 (since both have two decimal places). This transforms the problem into 216 ÷ 6, which equals 36. Verifying through alternative methods, such as moving decimal points or using fractions, confirms the result. 

The correct answer is **H: 36**.
