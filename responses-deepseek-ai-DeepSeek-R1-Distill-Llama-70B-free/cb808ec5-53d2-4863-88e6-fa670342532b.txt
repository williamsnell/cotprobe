Question:

With respect to the relationship between achievement and anxiety in schoolchildren, it appears that

Options:

A: some anxiety normally facilitates learning, and only for a few learners is there a point beyond which anxiety impedes learning
B: non-anxious children are better achievers than mildly anxious ones
C: mildly anxious children are better achievers than more anxious ones
D: there is no systematic relationship; anxiety measures are of no help in predicting achievement
E: highly anxious children are better achievers than mildly anxious ones
F: mildly anxious children are worse achievers than non-anxious ones
G: the level of anxiety does not affect the achievement of children
H: the relationship between anxiety and achievement is dependent on the subject being studied
I: only non-anxious children can achieve better learning outcomes
J: highly anxious children are unable to achieve any learning outcomes

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the relationship between achievement and anxiety in schoolchildren. Hmm, I remember that anxiety can have different effects on learning. Let me think about what I've learned before.

I think there's this idea that a little bit of anxiety might actually help some students. Like, if you're a bit nervous before a test, it might make you study harder or perform better. But if the anxiety gets too high, it could interfere with their ability to think clearly, right? So maybe there's an optimal level where some anxiety is good, but too much is bad.

Looking at the options, option A says that some anxiety normally facilitates learning, and only a few learners have a point where anxiety starts to impede learning. That makes sense because it suggests that up to a point, anxiety helps, but beyond that, it's a problem. So A could be the right answer.

Option B says non-anxious children are better achievers than mildly anxious ones. Wait, that would mean no anxiety is better, but I thought a little anxiety can be helpful. So B might not be correct because it's saying non-anxious are better, which doesn't account for the possible benefits of mild anxiety.

Option C says mildly anxious kids do better than more anxious ones. That aligns with the idea that too much anxiety is bad, so C could be correct. But wait, option A also includes that some anxiety is good, which might be a more comprehensive answer.

Option D claims there's no systematic relationship, but I remember reading that there is a correlation, so D is probably wrong.

Option E suggests highly anxious children achieve better than mildly anxious. That seems unlikely because high anxiety is usually a hindrance. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F says mildly anxious are worse than non-anxious. Again, this contradicts the idea that mild anxiety can be beneficial. So F is probably not right.

Option G says anxiety level doesn't affect achievement, which I don't think is true. So G is incorrect.

Option H says the relationship depends on the subject. Maybe in some cases, but the question is general about schoolchildren, not specific subjects. So I don't think H is the best choice here.

Options I and J are extreme. I says only non-anxious can achieve better, which doesn't fit with the idea that some anxiety can help. J says highly anxious can't achieve anything, which seems too absolute. So both I and J are probably wrong.

So now I'm between options A and C. Option A says some anxiety facilitates learning, which points to the idea that a little is good. Option C is about mildly anxious doing better than more anxious, which is also correct but doesn't capture the initial facilitating part.

Wait, the question is about what "appears" to be the relationship. From what I remember, the Yerkes-Dodson Law comes into play here. It states that there's an optimal level of arousal (which can include anxiety) for performance. Too little or too much can be detrimental. So for schoolchildren, a moderate level might be best, but a little anxiety can be helpful.

So looking back, option A says some anxiety normally facilitates learning, and only a few go beyond that point where it impedes. That fits with Yerkes-Dodson because for most, the curve is such that after a certain point, anxiety becomes negative. But for some, maybe even a little is too much.

So I think the correct answer is A.

The relationship between achievement and anxiety in schoolchildren can be understood through the lens of the Yerkes-Dodson Law, which suggests that there is an optimal level of arousal (including anxiety) for performance. A moderate level of anxiety can facilitate learning and performance, but when anxiety becomes too intense, it can impede achievement. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** aligns with this understanding, as it states that some anxiety normally facilitates learning, and only for a few learners does anxiety become detrimental. This captures the idea of an optimal level of anxiety.
- **Option C**, while partially correct in suggesting that mildly anxious children perform better than more anxious ones, does not account for the potential benefits of mild anxiety.
- Other options (B, D, E, F, G, I, J) either contradict the idea that mild anxiety can be beneficial or present overly extreme or incorrect views.

Thus, the most comprehensive and accurate answer is **A**.

Answer: A
