Question:

A 3-week-old male infant is brought to the office by his mother because of a 2-day history of white lesions in the mouth. The infant was born at term via uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery; he has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. At birth, he weighed 3289 g (7 lb 4 oz; 30th percentile). Today, he weighs 3629 kg (8 lb; 25th percentile). He appears adequately hydrated. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Fluconazole
B: Valacyclovir
C: Ketoconazole
D: Acyclovir
E: Miconazole
F: Amphotericin B
G: Terbinafine
H: Clotrimazole
I: Nystatin
J: Voriconazole

Okay, so I've got this question about a 3-week-old infant with white lesions in his mouth. Hmm, I remember that oral thrush is pretty common in babies. Let me think about what causes it. Oh right, it's usually caused by Candida, a type of fungus. So the question is about the appropriate medication.

The baby was born at term, is breast-feeding well, and seems healthy otherwise. The white patches don't come off when scraped, which is a classic sign of thrush. So I need to pick an antifungal.

Looking at the options, I see a bunch of antifungals. Let's go through them. Fluconazole is an oral antifungal, I think it's used for various fungal infections. Valacyclovir and Acyclovir are antivirals, so they wouldn't work for thrush. Ketoconazole is another antifungal, but I remember it's not usually the first choice for oral thrush, especially in infants, because of potential liver issues.

Miconazole is an option, often used topically. Clotrimazole is another one, also a topical antifungal. Terbinafine is more for skin and nail infections, probably not first-line for oral. Amphotericin B is a strong antifungal but usually reserved for more severe cases, maybe systemic infections, not oral thrush in this scenario.

Nystatin comes to mind. I've heard it's commonly used for oral thrush in infants. It's available as a suspension that you swish around the mouth. And it's safe for babies because it's not absorbed well from the mouth. So that's probably the right choice.

Fluconazole is an option too, but I think it's more for when the infection doesn't respond to topical treatments or in more severe cases. Since this is a straightforward presentation, nystatin would be the go-to.

So the options are either E (Miconazole), H (Clotrimazole), I (Nystatin). Wait, another thought: sometimes miconazole comes in a gel form for oral use, but nystatin is the classic treatment. Oh, and I think the first-line is usually nystatin suspension because it's effective and has a good safety profile for infants.

So the answer should be I: Nystatin.

The infant presents with white patches in the mouth that do not come off when scraped, which is characteristic of oral thrush caused by Candida. Oral thrush in infants is commonly treated with topical antifungal agents. Among the options, nystatin is the first-line treatment due to its efficacy, safety, and lack of systemic absorption when used as a suspension. Other options like miconazole or clotrimazole are also antifungals but are less commonly used as first-line treatments compared to nystatin in this context.

Answer: I
