Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the percentage of the total wet weight of a hepatocyte contributed by the cell membrane. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the cell is a cube with an edge length of 20 micrometers (μm). Wait, I need to convert that into centimeters or meters because sometimes units get tricky. Oh wait, maybe not, because the membrane thickness is given in Angstroms, which is a different unit. Let me think about converting everything to the same unit system.

The cell is a cube, so its volume should be edge length cubed. But wait, the question is about wet weight, which relates to mass. Since the specific gravity is 1.0, the density is 1 g/cm³. So, mass is density times volume. But I need to calculate the mass of the cell membrane and the total cell mass.

Let me start by calculating the volume of the entire cell. The edge is 20 μm. Oh wait, micrometers to centimeters: 1 μm is 1e-4 cm. So 20 μm is 20e-4 cm, which is 0.002 cm. Volume is (0.002 cm)^3. Let me compute that.

0.002 cm cubed is (2e-3 cm)^3 = 8e-9 cm³. Oh wait, no, 0.002 is 2e-3, so (2e-3)^3 = 8e-9 cm³. So the volume of the cell is 8e-9 cm³. Since density is 1 g/cm³, the mass of the cell is 8e-9 g.

Wait, but the cell membrane is a thin layer around the cube. How do I find the volume of the membrane? Maybe think of it as the outer layer. So the membrane's volume would be the volume of the entire cell minus the volume of the inner cube without the membrane.

Wait, the membrane is 90 Å thick. Angstrom is 1e-8 cm. So 90 Å is 9e-9 cm, or 0.9e-8 cm. Let me make sure about the conversion: 1 Å = 1e-8 cm, so 90 Å = 90e-8 cm = 9e-7 cm? Wait, wait no. 1e-8 cm is 0.00000001 cm, so 90e-8 cm is 9e-7 cm. Wait, no, 90 times 1e-8 is 9e-7 cm? Wait, 90e-8 is 9e-7? No, 90e-8 is 9e-7? Hmm, wait 90e-8 cm is 9e-7 cm? Wait 90e-8 is 9 * 10^-7 cm, yes. Because 90 * 1e-8 = 9 * 10 * 1e-8 = 9e-7 cm.

So the membrane is 9e-7 cm thick. Now, the cell is a cube of 20 μm edge length, which is 20e-4 cm.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. 20 micrometers is 20e-4 cm, yes. Because 1 cm is 10,000 micrometers, so 20 μm is 20/1e4 cm = 0.002 cm = 2e-3 cm.

So the volume of the cell is (2e-3 cm)^3 = 8e-9 cm³.

Now, the membrane is 9e-7 cm thick. So, when you have a cube with a thick membrane, the membrane's volume is approximately the surface area of the cube multiplied by the thickness of the membrane.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for a thin layer, the volume is the area times the thickness. So for a cube, the surface area is 6*(edge length)^2.

So surface area SA = 6 * (2e-3 cm)^2.

Let me compute that. (2e-3)^2 is 4e-6 cm². Multiply by 6: 24e-6 cm², which is 2.4e-5 cm².

Then, the volume of the membrane is SA * thickness. The thickness is 9e-7 cm. So 2.4e-5 cm² * 9e-7 cm = 2.16e-11 cm³.

Wait, that seems really small. But let me double-check. So 6*(edge)^2 is 6*(20e-4 cm)^2. So 20e-4 is 0.002 cm. Squared is 4e-6, times 6 is 24e-6 cm², which is 2.4e-5 cm². Multiply by 9e-7 cm, so 2.4e-5 *9e-7 = let's compute 2.4*9=21.6, and 1e-5 *1e-7 is 1e-12. So 21.6e-12 = 2.16e-11 cm³.

So membrane volume is 2.16e-11 cm³.

Now, the mass of the membrane is volume * density. The density is 1 g/cm³, so 2.16e-11 g.

The total cell mass is 8e-9 g.

The percentage is (membrane mass / total mass) * 100.

So (2.16e-11 /8e-9 ) *100.

Calculating 2.16e-11 /8e-9 = (2.16/8) * 1e-2 = 0.27 * 0.01 = 0.0027.

Multiply by 100 gives 0.27%.

Wait, that's 0.27 percent. So looking at the options, option E is 0.27%.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes approximations can be tricky.

Wait, the method I used assumes that the membrane is a thin layer, and so the volume is surface area times thickness. But another approach is to calculate the volume of the entire cell, and the volume of the cell without the membrane, then subtract them to get the membrane volume.

So the original cell has edge length a = 20 μm. The inner cell (without membrane) would have edge length a' = a - 2*thickness. Because the membrane is on both sides.

Wait, but wait, the thickness is 90 Å. 90 Å is 0.09 μm, because 1 μm is 10^4 Å. So 90 Å = 0.09 μm.

So the inner cube's edge would be 20 μm - 2*0.09 μm = 20 - 0.18 = 19.82 μm.

But wait, 20 μm is 20e-4 cm, and 0.09 μm is 0.09e-4 cm. So the inner edge is 20e-4 cm - 2*(0.09e-4 cm) = (20 -0.18)e-4 cm = 19.82e-4 cm.

So the volume of the inner cell is (19.82e-4 cm)^3.

Compute that: (19.82e-4)^3 = let's compute (20e-4 - 0.18e-4)^3. But perhaps an approximate way is better.

Compute 19.82^3 = ?

Wait, 20^3 is 8000. 19.82 is 20 - 0.18.

Using binomial approximation, (a - b)^3 ≈ a^3 - 3a²b + 3ab² - b^3.

So a=20, b=0.18.

a^3=8000.

3a²b = 3*(400)*(0.18)= 3*400*0.18= 3*72=216.

3ab²= 3*(20)*(0.18)^2 = 60*(0.0324)= 1.944.

b^3=0.18^3=0.005832.

So (a-b)^3 ≈ 8000 - 216 + 1.944 - 0.005832 = 8000 - 216 is 7784, plus 1.944 is 7785.944, minus 0.0058 is ~7785.938.

So (19.82)^3 ≈7785.938, but since the unit is 1e-4 cm, the volume is (19.82e-4 cm)^3 = (19.82)^3 * (1e-4 cm)^3 = 7785.938 * 1e-12 cm³ = 7.785938e-9 cm³.

Original cell volume is 8e-9 cm³. So the membrane volume is 8e-9 -7.785938e-9 = 0.214062e-9 cm³ = 2.14062e-10 cm³.

Wait, that's different from the earlier method. Hmm, so which approach is correct?

Earlier, using surface area times thickness gave 2.16e-11 cm³. Now, this method gives 2.14e-10 cm³, which is ten times larger. So which one is right?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Because the first approach assumes the membrane is a thin layer, and so the volume is surface area multiplied by thickness. But for a cube, this is an approximation that works when the membrane is very thin compared to the cell size.

But wait, in the first approach, the volume was 2.16e-11, which is 0.2161e-10. The second approach gives 2.14e-10, which is ten times larger. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-calculate the first method.

Surface area of the cube: 6*(edge length)^2.

Edge length is 20e-4 cm. So (20e-4)^2 is 400e-8 cm². Multiply by 6: 2400e-8 = 2.4e-5 cm².

Multiply by thickness: 9e-7 cm.

So 2.4e-5 cm² * 9e-7 cm = 2.16e-11 cm³.

But the second method, which calculates the difference between the outer and inner cube, gives 2.14e-10 cm³.

Wait, why the difference? Because the first method assumes that the membrane is a thin layer, so volume is surface area times thickness. But the second method accounts for the exact difference.

Wait, what's the correct approach here? Hmm. Let me think about the relative sizes. The cell is 20 μm, and the membrane is 90 Å, which is 0.09 μm. So the membrane is 0.09/20 = 0.0045, or 0.45% of the cell's edge length. That's a small fraction, so maybe the thin layer approximation is valid.

Wait, but the two methods are giving results that are an order of magnitude apart. That's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, in the second approach, I got the inner volume as 7.785938e-9 cm³, so the membrane volume is 8e-9 -7.785938e-9 = 0.214062e-9 = 2.14062e-10 cm³.

Wait, 2.14e-10 is 0.214e-9, which is 214e-12, or 214 picoliters? Hmm, the first method gave 2.16e-11, which is 21.6 picoliters. So the second method gives a membrane volume about ten times larger.

This suggests something is wrong. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, in the second approach, when I computed (19.82e-4)^3, I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 19.82^3 more accurately.

Let me compute 19.82 * 19.82 first. 20*20 is 400. 19.82 is 20 - 0.18.

So 19.82 * 19.82 = (20 - 0.18)(20 - 0.18) = 20² - 2*20*0.18 + 0.18² = 400 - 7.2 + 0.0324 = 392.8324.

Then multiply by 19.82 again: 392.8324 * 19.82.

Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but perhaps I can approximate.

392.8324 * 20 is 7,856.648. But since it's 19.82, which is 20 - 0.18, so 392.8324 * (20 -0.18) = 7,856.648 - 392.8324 * 0.18.

Compute 392.8324 * 0.18: 0.1 *392.8324 is 39.28324; 0.08 *392.8324 is 31.426592. Sum is 70.709832.

So 7,856.648 -70.709832 = 7,785.938168 cm³. So the volume is 7,785.938 * (1e-4 cm)^3.

Wait, no, (19.82e-4 cm)^3 is 19.82^3 * (1e-4)^3 cm³. 1e-4 cm is 0.0001 cm. So (1e-4)^3 is 1e-12 cm³.

So 7,785.938 * 1e-12 cm³ = 7.785938e-9 cm³.

Thus, the cell volume is 8e-9 cm³, so the membrane volume is 8e-9 -7.785938e-9 = 0.214062e-9 cm³ = 2.14062e-10 cm³.

So that's the correct volume via the second method.

But wait, the first method, surface area times thickness, gave 2.16e-11 cm³, which is an order of magnitude smaller.

So which method is correct? Hmm.

Wait, in the thin membrane approximation, the volume should be approximately equal to surface area times thickness. But perhaps I'm miscalculating the surface area.

Wait, the surface area of the cube is 6*(edge)^2. Edge is 20e-4 cm, so (20e-4)^2 is 400e-8 cm². Multiply by 6: 2400e-8 cm² = 2.4e-5 cm².

Multiply by thickness 9e-7 cm: 2.4e-5 *9e-7 = 2.16e-11 cm³.

But according to the second method, the correct volume is 2.14e-10, which is ten times larger.

Ah, I see the problem now. The second method accounts for the fact that the membrane is on all six faces, but perhaps the thin layer approximation isn't considering that the edges and corners might contribute more. Or perhaps the calculation in the thin layer is correct, but the second method is wrong.

Wait, no, the thin layer approximation should hold when the membrane is much thinner than the cell. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the volume of a thin layer around a cube is indeed 6*(edge)^2 * thickness. Because each face contributes edge^2 * thickness, and there are six faces. So that's correct.

Alternatively, when the membrane is thick, the exact method is better. So perhaps the thin layer approximation is underestimating the volume when the membrane is a significant fraction of the cell size.

Wait, but in our case, the membrane is 0.09 μm, cell is 20 μm. So 0.09 is 0.45% of 20. So the approximation should hold, but why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the second method. Let me check again.

Wait, the inner edge is 20 - 2*0.09 = 19.82 μm. So yes. The volume is (19.82e-4 cm)^3.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (19.82e-4 cm)^3 numerically.

Compute 19.82e-4 cm = 0.001982 cm.

0.001982^3 = ?

Well, 0.002^3 is 8e-9 cm³, which is the original cell volume. 0.001982 is slightly smaller, so 0.001982^3 is 7.853e-9 cm³.

So the membrane volume is 8e-9 -7.853e-9 = 1.47e-10 cm³.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.001982^3 is:

Let me compute 0.001982 * 0.001982 = ?

0.001982 * 0.001982: Let's compute 1982e-7 * 1982e-7 = (1982)^2 * 1e-14.

1982 squared is approx 1980²= (2000-20)²= 4e6 - 2*2000*20 +20²= 4e6 -80,000 +400= 3,920,400.

So 1982² ≈3,928,324 (exact value not needed; let's approximate as 3.928e6).

So 3.928e6 *1e-14 = 3.928e-8 cm².

Now multiply by 0.001982 cm:

3.928e-8 cm² * 0.001982 cm = 7.786e-11 cm³.

So the inner volume is approximately 7.786e-11 cm³? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.001982 cm is 1.982e-3 cm.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Let me compute 0.001982^3:

0.001 *0.001 *0.001 = 1e-9.

0.001982 is 1.982e-3.

So (1.982e-3)^3 = (1.982)^3 *1e-9.

1.982^3 is approximately 7.8, so 7.8e-9 cm³. So the inner volume is 7.8e-9 cm³.

Thus, the membrane volume is 8e-9 -7.8e-9 = 0.2e-9 cm³ = 2e-10 cm³.
