Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about an electromagnetic wave radiated by an antenna. The wave has a frequency of 40 kHz, and it needs to reach a point that's 60 kilometers away. I need to find the time it takes for the wave to get there. The options are from A to J, with various milliseconds as choices.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is the speed of light, which is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. But wait, does that apply here? I think so, because radio waves (like those from an antenna) are electromagnetic and travel at that speed in air, which is similar enough to a vacuum for this problem.

So the basic idea is to use the formula: time = distance / speed. But wait, I need to make sure the units are compatible. The distance is given in kilometers, and the speed is in meters per second. Let me convert the distance to meters.

60 kilometers is 60,000 meters. Right, because 1 km is 1000 meters. So the distance (d) is 60,000 m.

The speed (v) is 3.00e8 m/s. So plugging into the formula, time (t) equals d over v. So t = 60000 / 3e8.

Let me compute that. 60000 divided by 300,000,000. Let's see, 6e4 divided by 3e8. That's the same as (6/3) * (1e4 / 1e8) = 2 * 1e-4 = 2e-4 seconds. Wait, 2e-4 is 0.0002 seconds. How much is that in milliseconds?

Oh right, because 1 millisecond is 1e-3 seconds. So 0.0002 seconds is 0.2 milliseconds. Let me double-check that. 1e-3 is a millisec, so 0.2e-3 is 0.2 milliseconds.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.2 msec. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait a second. The frequency is given as 40 kHz. Oh, does that matter here? Hmm. Because the frequency of the wave affects its wavelength, but when calculating the time it takes for the wave to reach a point, we're just considering the speed of the wave, not the frequency. Because the wave's speed is determined by the medium, not the frequency. So whether it's 40 kHz or any other frequency, as long as it's in the same medium (like air), the speed is the same. So the frequency given in the question might be a red herring, or maybe it's there for another calculation, but in this case, it's not needed.

So the calculation was correct. Time is 0.2 milliseconds, which is option I.

To determine the time taken by the electromagnetic wave to reach the point 60 km away, we use the formula:

\[
t = \frac{d}{v}
\]

Where:
- \(d = 60 \, \text{km} = 60,000 \, \text{m}\) (distance converted to meters),
- \(v = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) (speed of light in a vacuum).

Substituting the values:

\[
t = \frac{60,000}{3.00 \times 10^8} = 2.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Converting to milliseconds (\(1 \, \text{ms} = 10^{-3} \, \text{s}\)):

\[
t = 0.2 \, \text{ms}.
\]

The frequency of the wave (40 kHz) does not affect the calculation, as the speed of electromagnetic waves in air is constant. Thus, the correct answer is:

I: 0.2 msec.
