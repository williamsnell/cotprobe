Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

James makes a written offer to Fred to sell land for $100,000. The offer says, "This offer will not be revocable for a ten-day period of time." It was signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and Fred received it on April 5.

The question is about what happens in different scenarios regarding the offer and acceptance. The options are A through F.

Hmm, I remember that offers can be revoked unless they're firm offers, which are also called options. A firm offer can't be revoked for a certain period, even if the offeror tries. But how does that work with when the offer is sent versus when it's received?

So James's offer says it's not revocable for ten days. I think that makes it a firm offer. Normally, offers can be revoked any time before acceptance unless it's a firm offer. So James can't revoke it for ten days from when he signed it, right?

Wait, wait. Wait, when does the ten-day period start? Is it from the date he signed it (April 1) or when Fred received it (April 5)? Because sometimes the timing of when the offer becomes effective can matter, like in cases of revocation.

In most cases, the offer becomes effective when the offeree receives it. But wait, for revocation, the key is that the revocation must be communicated to the offeree before they accept. But in this case, since it's a firm offer, James can't revoke it for ten days from when? I think the ten-day period starts when the offer is made (signed) unless stated otherwise. So from April 1, the ten days would end on April 11.

Wait, no, wait. The offer was made when it's communicated to the offeree, right? Because an offer is made when the offeree receives it. So if James signed it on April 1, mailed on April 3, and Fred got it on April 5, the ten-day period would start on April 5. So the offer can't be revoked until April 15 (10 days after April 5). But wait, the offer says "ten-day period of time" from when? The question says, "This offer will not be revocable for a ten-day period of time." It doesn't specify, but in contract law, a firm offer is usually irrevocable from the time it's made (i.e., when it's received by the offeree) for the stated period.

Wait, but sometimes the offer is considered made when it's signed, but that doesn't make much sense because the offeree hasn't received it yet. So I think the ten-day period starts when the offer is received, so April 5. So the offer is open and irrevocable until April 15.

Wait, but what about mailing and when it's effective? Let me think. For revocation, the general rule is that an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance or before it's lapse. But if it's a firm offer, the revocation is suspended for the specified period.

Wait, the UCC might have different rules, but this is about real estate, so probably common law. Under common law, a firm offer (option) is created if the offeror promises to keep it open, and consideration is provided. But in this case, the offer says it's not revocable for ten days, but there's no mention of consideration. Wait, does that matter? I think under common law, to make a firm offer without consideration, it's still binding if the offeror states that it's firm. Hmm, but I might be mixing up UCC and common law rules.

Wait, maybe I should approach each option one by one.

Option A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.

So the offer was received on April 5. James died on April 4, which is before Fred received the offer. But does James's death affect the offer? If James dies before the offer is accepted, but after the offer was made, the offer can still be accepted. Because the offer is still open. So if Fred accepts on April 5, which is after James's death, but before the offer's expiration, would that be a valid contract?

Wait, no. Because when James dies, the offer is revoked by operation of law? Or does the offer remain open? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that the death of the offeror terminates the offer if the offer is one that cannot be performed by the offeror's estate, like personal services. But in this case, it's the sale of land, which is property. So the estate can convey the land. So the offer wouldn't be automatically revoked upon James's death. Thus, Fred could still accept the offer even after James's death, and the estate would be bound. So if James died on April 4, but the offer was received on April 5, and Fred accepts on April 5, the contract would be formed. So option A says it won't create a contract, which would be incorrect. So A is wrong.

Option B: Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 will not create a contract.

If Fred accepts on April 10, which is before the ten-day period ends (April 5 + 10 days is April 15), so the offer is still open. So why wouldn't it create a contract? Unless the offer has been revoked. But James can't revoke it during the ten days. So if Fred accepts on April 10, it should be effective, creating a contract. So B says it won't create a contract, which is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Fred stating on April 5, "I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000" creates a contract.

That's a qualified acceptance, which is a counteroffer. So it's not an acceptance. So no contract is formed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 11 will create a contract.

Wait, April 5 is when Fred received the offer. So ten days from April 5 would be April 15. So the offer is open until April 15. So if Fred accepts on April 11, that's within the ten-day period. So the offer is still open, and the acceptance would create a contract. So D says it creates a contract, which is correct. So D is a possible correct answer.

Option E: Fred stating on April 6, "I accept your offer, but will pay in 60 days" creates a contract.

Again, a qualified acceptance. It's adding a condition on payment terms. So it's a counteroffer. So no contract is formed. So E is incorrect.

Option F: James revoking the offer on April 4 will not invalidate the contract.

Wait, April 4 is before Fred received the offer on April 5. So James tried to revoke it on the 4th, but the offer wasn't received yet. So the revocation would be effective when it's communicated to Fred. But if James revokes on April 4, but Fred doesn't know about it until after he accepts, then the revocation might be effective only if it's communicated before acceptance.

Wait, but in this case, the offer is a firm offer. So James can't revoke it during the ten-day period. So any attempted revocation during that time is ineffective. So if James tried to revoke on April 4, which is before the offer was received, does that matter? Because the offer wasn't yet received. So perhaps the revocation is before the offer becomes effective.

Wait, the offer is made when it's received by the offeree. So before April 5, James can revoke it because the offer hasn't been made yet. Because until it's received, the offer isn't effective. So if James revokes on April 4, before Fred received it, then the offer is revoked, so when Fred tries to accept on April 5, there's no offer left. So in that case, if someone tried to revoke before the offer was received, the offer is effectively revoked. So in option F, if James revokes on April 4, that would prevent a contract from forming. So F says it will not invalidate the contract, meaning the contract is still valid. But if the revocation was effective, then the contract wouldn't form, making F incorrect.

Wait, but the offer was a firm offer. So if the offer is made (received on April 5), and the ten-day period starts, then James can't revoke it. But if he revokes before the offer is made, then the offer never becomes effective. So in this case, James's revocation on April 4, before the offer was received, would prevent the offer from being effective. So any acceptance would not create a contract.

So back to option F: James revokes on April 4. If he revokes before the offer is received, then the offer is revoked. So any acceptance by Fred would not create a contract. So F says that the revocation doesn't invalidate the contract, which would be wrong because it does invalidate it. So F is incorrect.

Wait, but if the offer is a firm offer, does that mean it can't be revoked even before it's received? Hmm, no. Because the firm offer only applies once the offer is made (i.e., received by the offeree). So the offeror can revoke an offer before it's received, because until it's received, the offeree hasn't had a chance to rely on it. So in this case, James revoking on April 4, before Fred received the offer on April 5, would effectively revoke the offer. So when Fred tries to accept, the offer is already revoked, so no contract.

So in option A, if James died on April 4, and Fred accepted on April 5, would that create a contract? Wait, earlier I thought that James's death wouldn't revoke the offer because the estate can perform. So the offer is still open. So if the offer was still open, Fred's acceptance would create a contract. So A says it won't create a contract if James dies on April 4. But if the offer is still open, then it would create a contract, making A incorrect.

Wait, so the correct answer would be D: Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 11 creates a contract. Because the ten-day period runs from April 5 to April 15, so April 11 is within that period, so the offer is still open, and the acceptance would create a contract.

Wait, but wait another point. The offer was mailed on April 3 and received on April 5. The offer is not revocable for ten days. Does the ten-day period start when the offer is made (mailed) or when it's received?

I recall that the time period in an option usually starts when the offer is received. Because the offer is made when it's received. So the ten-day period would start on April 5, so it ends on April 15. So if Fred accepts on April 11, that's within the period, so it's valid.

So option D is correct.

Now, looking at the options, option D is correct because the acceptance is within the ten-day window, creating a contract. So the answer should be D.

To analyze the question, we must determine the validity of each option based on the rules of contract law, particularly focusing on firm offers and the timing of revocation, acceptance, and expiration.

### Key Points:
1. **Firm Offer**: James's written offer states it is "not revocable for a ten-day period of time," making it a firm offer. Under common law, a firm offer becomes irrevocable once received by the offeree (Fred) and remains open for the specified period (ten days in this case).
2. **Timing of the Offer**: The offer was signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and received by Fred on April 5. The ten-day irrevocable period begins on April 5 (when the offer is received) and ends on April 15.
3. **Revocation**: James cannot revoke the offer during the ten-day period. However, if James revokes the offer before it is received by Fred (e.g., on April 4), the revocation is effective because the offer is not yet binding until received.
4. **Acceptance**: For a contract to form, Fred's acceptance must be unqualified and occur before the offer expires (April 15). A qualified acceptance (e.g., changing terms) constitutes a counteroffer and does not create a contract.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **Option A**: If James dies on April 4 and Fred accepts on April 5, the contract would still be valid. The offer remains open because James's death does not automatically revoke the offer, especially since the estate can convey the land. Thus, A is incorrect.
  
- **Option B**: If Fred makes an unqualified acceptance on April 10, the offer is still valid (as it is within the ten-day period from April 5 to April 15). Therefore, a contract would be created, making B incorrect.

- **Option C**: Fred's statement, "I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000," is a qualified acceptance. This constitutes a counteroffer, not an acceptance, so no contract is formed. Thus, C is incorrect.

- **Option D**: If Fred makes an unqualified acceptance on April 11, it is within the ten-day period (April 5 to April 15). The offer is still open, so the acceptance creates a contract. Therefore, D is correct.

- **Option E**: Fred's statement, "I accept your offer, but will pay in 60 days," is a qualified acceptance. This is a counteroffer, not an acceptance, so no contract is formed. Thus, E is incorrect.

- **Option F**: If James revokes the offer on April 4 (before Fred receives it on April 5), the revocation is effective because the offer is not yet binding. Therefore, the revocation invalidates the offer, making F incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D**, as Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 11 creates a contract.
