Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Berkeley synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate particles, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. The question is about calculating the percentage increase in the proton mass due to relativistic effects. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic mass increase becomes significant. 

So the problem gives me the kinetic energy (KE) as 5.4 x 10^-11 J, and the speed is about 2e8 m/s. Wait, but I think I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy formula isn't the classical (1/2 mv²) anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. 

Wait, but maybe I should start by finding γ. The Lorentz factor is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). I know the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v is 2e8, which is 2/3 of c. Let me calculate v²/c²: (2e8)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (4e16)/(9e16) )= 4/9. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 4/9 = 5/9. So the square root of (5/9) is sqrt(5)/3. So γ would be 1 / (sqrt(5)/3) )= 3 / sqrt(5). Let me compute that numerically. sqrt(5) is about 2.236, so 3 divided by 2.236 is approximately 1.3416. 

So γ is about 1.3416. That means the relativistic mass is γ times the rest mass. The rest mass of a proton is about 1.67e-27 kg. But wait, I don't think I need the actual mass because I'm looking for the percentage increase. The mass increases by (γ - 1) times 100 percent. So γ is 1.3416, so (γ -1) is 0.3416, which is 34.16% increase. So the percentage increase is approximately 34%. Looking at the options, option D is 34 per cent. 

Wait, but another approach: using the kinetic energy formula. The kinetic energy is (γ -1) mc². Let's plug in the numbers. Mc² for a proton: m is 1.67e-27 kg, c squared is 9e16 m²/s². So mc² is 1.67e-27 * 9e16 = 1.503e-10 J. 

The given KE is 5.4e-11 J. So (γ -1) mc² = 5.4e-11. So (γ-1) = 5.4e-11 / 1.503e-10 ≈ 0.3596. So γ is 1.3596. Then the percentage increase is (1.3596 - 1)*100 = 35.96%, which is about 36%. Wait, that's a bit different from the previous 34%. Hmm, that's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate. Mc² is 1.67e-27 kg * (3e8)^2. Wait, 3e8 squared is 9e16. So 1.67e-27 * 9e16 = (1.67 *9) * 1e-11 = 15.03e-11, which is 1.503e-10 J. Correct. 

So (γ-1) = 5.4e-11 / 1.503e-10 = (5.4 /15.03) = approximately 0.3596. So γ is 1.3596. 

Wait, but earlier when I computed gamma using velocity, I got around 1.3416. So which one is correct? Which approach is right? Because both should give the same gamma. 

Ah, wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let's recheck that. 

v is 2e8 m/s, c is 3e8. So v/c is 2/3, so v²/c² is 4/9. So 1 - v²/c² is 5/9. So sqrt(5/9)=sqrt(5)/3≈2.236/3≈0.745. So 1/0.745 is approximately 1.3416. So that's correct. 

But wait, wait. The two approaches are giving slightly different gammas. That's a problem. Because they should agree. Let me see: the gamma from KE is about 1.3596, and from velocity, it's about 1.3416. Hmm, that suggests a discrepancy. Did I compute something wrong? 

Wait, let me re-calculate the (γ-1) from KE. 

KE = 5.4e-11 J = (γ-1) * 1.503e-10 J. So (γ-1)=5.4e-11 / 1.503e-10 = (5.4/15.03) ≈ 0.3596. So γ ≈ 1.3596. 

But from the velocity, gamma is 3/sqrt(5) ≈3/2.236≈1.3416. So which is the correct value? 

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the velocity approach. Let me recalculate gamma using the velocity. 

v = 2e8 m/s.

v/c = 2e8 / 3e8 = 2/3 ≈0.6667.

v²/c² = (2/3)^2 = 4/9 ≈0.4444.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556.

sqrt(0.5556) is sqrt(5/9) = sqrt(5)/3 ≈2.236/3≈0.745.

So gamma is 1/0.745 ≈1.3416. 

So why is there a discrepancy between the two methods? That's confusing. Because the gamma should be the same whether you compute it from velocity or from kinetic energy. 

Ah, wait, perhaps the velocity given is the non-relativistic velocity. Or maybe the question states that the speed is about 2e8 m/s, but perhaps that's the speed in the lab frame, but perhaps when you calculate gamma from the KE, you get a different speed? Hmm, perhaps I need to think about this more carefully. 

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity given in the question is not the relativistic velocity, but that can't be. Because the velocity is a given parameter. 

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the velocity from the relativistic kinetic energy and see if it matches. Let's think. 

KE = (γ-1) mc² = 5.4e-11 J.

We have mc² = 1.503e-10 J, so (γ-1) = 5.4e-11 / 1.503e-10 ≈0.3596, so γ≈1.3596.

Now, using gamma, what is the corresponding velocity?

We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So rearranged, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/gamma.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma².

v²/c² = 1 - (1/gamma²).

So v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

So let's compute that.

gamma is 1.3596.

1/gamma = 0.7353.

1/gamma squared is (0.7353)^2 ≈0.5405.

So 1 - 0.5405 = 0.4595.

So sqrt(0.4595) ≈0.6778.

So v ≈ c * 0.6778 ≈3e8 * 0.6778 ≈2.033e8 m/s.

Which is a bit higher than the given 2e8 m/s. So the given speed is 2e8, but according to the KE, it's around 2.033e8 m/s. So perhaps the given speed is an approximate value, so the gamma from KE is more accurate.

Wait, but the question says that the speed is about 2e8 m/s, which is a rough estimate. So perhaps for the purposes of the problem, we're to use that given speed to compute gamma, not the KE.

But then, why does the KE give a different gamma? Maybe the question expects me to use the given speed, not the KE, because the KE corresponds to a higher speed. But the problem says to take into account the relativistic mass increase, so perhaps the method using the given speed is the intended approach.

So if I proceed with the speed to calculate gamma, which is 1.3416, then the percentage increase is (1.3416 - 1) *100 = 34.16%, which is approximately 34%, matching option D.

But wait, the KE approach gives a higher gamma. So which should I choose?

Hmm, the question says that the kinetic energy corresponds to a speed of about 2e8 m/s. So perhaps the velocity given is an approximate value, and the actual gamma comes from the KE. But I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to compute gamma using the velocity and ignore the KE. Because the question provides the velocity as a given, so perhaps it's intended to use that approach.

So going back, using v=2e8 m/s, gamma is approximately 1.3416. So the mass increases by 34.16%, which is closest to option D:34%.

Wait, but earlier when I computed using the KE, I got a gamma of about 1.3596, which would give a 35.96% increase, which is about 36%. But none of the options is 36%, but D is 34%, which is 34.16%, and I is 22, etc. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the velocity, leading to 34%. So I think the correct answer is D.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation for gamma using velocity. So v=2e8, c=3e8.

v^2 = (2e8)^2 =4e16.

c^2=9e16.

v²/c² =4e16/9e16=4/9=0.444.

1 - v²/c²=0.5556.

sqrt(0.5556)= approx 0.745.

So gamma=1/0.745≈1.3416.

That's correct. So the increase is 34.16%, so D:34% is the answer.

To calculate the percentage increase in the proton mass due to relativistic effects in the Berkeley synchrocyclotron, we use the Lorentz factor, \( \gamma \), which accounts for relativistic mass increase. The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \) using the given velocity
The problem states that the proton speed is approximately \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). First, compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(2 \times 10^8)^2}{(3 \times 10^8)^2} = \frac{4 \times 10^{16}}{9 \times 10^{16}} = \frac{4}{9} \approx 0.444
\]

Next, calculate \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.444 = 0.556
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.556} \approx 0.745
\]

Finally, compute \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{0.745} \approx 1.3416
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage increase in mass
The relativistic mass increase is given by \( (\gamma - 1) \times 100\% \). Substituting \( \gamma \approx 1.3416 \):

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = (\gamma - 1) \times 100\% = (1.3416 - 1) \times 100\% \approx 34.16\%
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated percentage increase in mass is approximately \( 34.16\% \), which corresponds to option **D: 34 per cent**.

### Final Answer:
D
