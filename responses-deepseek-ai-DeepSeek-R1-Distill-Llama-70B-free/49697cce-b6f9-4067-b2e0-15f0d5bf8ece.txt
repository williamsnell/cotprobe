Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem about an RLC circuit, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the homogeneous solution for the voltage across a capacitor, v_C(t). 

Let me start by recalling what I know about RLC circuits. In a series RLC circuit, the voltage across the capacitor and inductor can be described by differential equations. Since the problem is about the capacitor voltage, I think the relevant equation would be the one derived from Kirchhoff's laws.

I remember that for a series RLC circuit, the differential equation governing the capacitor voltage is of second order. The general form is something like L * d²v_C/dt² + R * dv_C/dt + (1/C) * v_C = 0. Wait, no, maybe I got that mixed up. Oh right, the equation is L d²v_C/dt² + R dv_C/dt + (1/C) v_C = 0. Yeah, that's right because the capacitor's current is the integral of its voltage.

So the given parameters are R = 4 ohms, L = 4 henrys, and the capacitor is 1/2 farads. The initial conditions are i_L(0) = 1/4 A and v_C(0) = 0. Wait, i_L is the inductor current, which is the same as the capacitor current at any time t, right? Because in series, all components share the same current.

So the differential equation is:

4 * d²v_C/dt² + 4 * dv_C/dt + (1/(1/2)) v_C = 0

Simplifying that, 1/(1/2) is 2, so the equation becomes:

4 d²v_C/dt² +4 dv_C/dt + 2 v_C = 0

But wait, maybe I should write this in the standard form. Let me divide all terms by 4 to get it in terms of d²v/dt² + ... So:

d²v_C/dt² + (4/4) dv_C/dt + (2/4) v_C = 0 → d²v/dt² + dv/dt + 0.5 v = 0

So the characteristic equation would be r² + r + 0.5 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, r = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Here a=1, b=1, c=0.5.

Calculating the discriminant: b² -4ac = (1)^2 -4*(1)*(0.5) = 1 - 2 = -1. So the roots are complex: r = [-1 ± sqrt(-1)]/2 → (-1 ± i)/2. So the real part is -1/2, and the imaginary part is 1/2.

Therefore, the homogeneous solution is e^(-1/2 t) [ C1 cos( (1/2) t ) + C2 sin( (1/2) t ) ]

Wait, but wait. I think I might have miscalculated when I was scaling the equation. Let me double-check the differential equation.

Wait, the standard form for the RLC circuit is L d²v_C/dt² + R dv_C/dt + (1/C) v_C = 0.

Plugging in the values: L=4, R=4, C=0.5.

So 4 d²v_C/dt² +4 dv_C/dt + (1/0.5) v_C = 0 → 4 d²v/dt² +4 dv/dt + 2 v = 0.

Divide all terms by 4: d²v/dt² + dv/dt + 0.5 v = 0. So that's correct. So the characteristic equation is r² + r + 0.5 = 0, roots as (-1 ± i)/2. So the homogeneous solution is correct as I had before.

Now, looking at the options, the general form is e^(-1/2 t) times some combination of sine and cosine terms. Let's look at the options:

Option F is e^(-1/2 t) cos(1/2 t) V. Option H is e^(-1/2 t) sin(1/2 t) V. Option E has a different exponent, e^(-1/4 t), so probably wrong.

But wait, the actual homogeneous solution would have both sine and cosine terms, with constants determined by initial conditions. However, the question is only asking for the homogeneous solution, which is the general form, so any of the options that match this form would be correct. But looking at the options, it's possible that the answer is either F or H, but wait, the question just says "find the homogeneous solution"—the general solution. So perhaps the options don't list the sum of sine and cosine, but perhaps looking for one of the components.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as 'find the homogeneous solution', which is the complementary solution, which is the general form involving both sine and cosine. But none of the options have both sine and cosine. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, the homogeneous solution is indeed the general form, which includes both sine and cosine terms. But the options only present individual functions, not a sum. Hmm, perhaps the question is about the form, and the correct option would contain the exponential factor and the sine or cosine with the right argument.

Wait, but looking at the initial conditions might help determine which option is correct. The initial conditions are v_C(0) = 0 and i_L(0) = 1/4 A. Also, because i_L is the same as the current through the capacitor, which is the derivative of the charge, so i = C dv/dt. Wait, actually, the current in the capacitor is i_C = C dv/dt. But in a series circuit, i_C = i_L = i_R = i(t). So, since v_C(0)=0, and the inductor current is i_L(0) = 1/4 A, which equals the capacitor current at t=0.

Wait, the initial conditions are v_C(0) = 0 and dv_C/dt(0) = i_L(0) / C. Because i_C = C dv/dt → dv/dt = i_C / C. So at t=0, dv/dt(0) = i_L(0) / C = (1/4) / (1/2) = (1/4)*2 = 1/2 A/V? Wait, no, units might need checking, but perhaps I can proceed.

So, for the general solution: v_C(t) = e^(-1/2 t) [ C1 cos( (1/2) t ) + C2 sin( (1/2) t ) ]

Applying initial condition v(0)=0:

v(0) = e^0 [ C1 * 1 + C2 * 0 ] = C1 = 0 → C1 = 0.

So the solution simplifies to v(t) = C2 e^{-1/2 t} sin( (1/2) t )

Now, to find C2, we can take the derivative of v(t) and apply the initial condition for dv/dt at t=0.

v(t) = C2 e^{-t/2} sin(t/2)

dv/dt = C2 [ (-1/2) e^{-t/2} sin(t/2) + e^{-t/2} (1/2) cos(t/2) ]

At t=0:

dv/dt(0) = C2 [ (-1/2)(1)(0) + (1/2)(1)(1) ] = C2*(1/2) = 1/2.

So,  C2*(1/2) = 1/2 → C2 = 1.

Therefore, the solution is v(t) = e^{-t/2} sin(t/2).

Looking back at the options, which one matches this? Option H is e^{-1/2 t} sin(1/2 t) V. So option H.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option F is cosine, but since C1 is zero, the solution is purely sine. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but looking at the given options, let me make sure.

Option H: e^-(1/2)t sin(1/2) t V → Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer is option H.

To find the homogeneous solution for the voltage \( v_C(t) \) across the capacitor in the given series RLC circuit, we start with the differential equation governing the capacitor voltage:

\[
L \frac{d^2 v_C}{dt^2} + R \frac{dv_C}{dt} + \frac{1}{C} v_C = 0
\]

Substituting the given values \( R = 4 \, \Omega \), \( L = 4 \, \text{H} \), and \( C = \frac{1}{2} \, \text{F} \), the equation becomes:

\[
4 \frac{d^2 v_C}{dt^2} + 4 \frac{dv_C}{dt} + 2 v_C = 0
\]

Dividing through by 4 to simplify:

\[
\frac{d^2 v_C}{dt^2} + \frac{dv_C}{dt} + 0.5 v_C = 0
\]

The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:

\[
r^2 + r + 0.5 = 0
\]

Solving for \( r \) using the quadratic formula:

\[
r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \quad a = 1, \, b = 1, \, c = 0.5
\]

\[
r = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 2}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i}{2}
\]

Thus, the roots are complex: \( r = -\frac{1}{2} \pm i\frac{1}{2} \). The homogeneous solution is therefore:

\[
v_C(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \left[ C_1 \cos\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) + C_2 \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) \right]
\]

Applying the initial conditions:

1. \( v_C(0) = 0 \): Substituting \( t = 0 \) into the solution gives \( C_1 = 0 \).
2. \( \frac{dv_C}{dt}(0) = \frac{i_L(0)}{C} = \frac{1/4}{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} \): Differentiating \( v_C(t) \) and substituting \( t = 0 \) gives \( C_2 = 1 \).

Thus, the solution simplifies to:

\[
v_C(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right)
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) \, \text{V} \)**
