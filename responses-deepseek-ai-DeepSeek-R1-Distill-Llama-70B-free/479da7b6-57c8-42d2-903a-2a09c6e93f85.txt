Question:

Jones is arrested for driving under the influence of a controlled substance, marijuana. The prosecution wishes to introduce a videotape from a pot party Jones left just before his arrest. The recording shows Jones exhaling a giant cloud of smoke and stating, "that's really great weed, man." Jones testifies on his own behalf, "I'm an honest person. I absolutely did not drive erratically." On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks, "Isn't it true you lied in your divorce trial last year?" If Jones' attorney objects, the court will likely hold the prosecutor's question is

Options:

A: Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness.
B: Admissible, as it relates to the case at hand.
C: Admissible, so long as the prosecutor produces a certified copy of the conviction.
D: Admissible, because it showcases Jones' character.
E: Not admissible, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence.
F: Not admissible, as it is considered hearsay.
G: Admissible, because it demonstrates Jones' dishonesty.
H: Not admissible because it is irrelevant.
I: Not admissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, Jones was arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana. The prosecution has a videotape from a pot party Jones left just before his arrest. On the tape, Jones exhales smoke and says, "that's really great weed, man." He testifies in his own defense, saying he's honest and didn't drive erratically. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks if he lied in his divorce trial last year. Jones' attorney objects, and the question is about whether the prosecutor's question is admissible.

The options are from A to J, but the possible answers are A through I. So I need to think about the rules of evidence here.

First, I remember that when a witness testifies, their credibility can be attacked. One way to do that is by showing that they've been convicted of a crime that involves dishonesty, like perjury. But this question is about a specific instance of conduct, not a conviction.

Wait, the question is about whether the prosecutor can ask about him lying in his divorce trial. So the prosecutor is trying to impeach Jones' credibility by showing he lied under oath before. 

But under the Federal Rules of Evidence, you can attack a witness's credibility with specific instances of conduct that show dishonesty. However, I think there's a rule about whether you can use extrinsic evidence for that. Like, you can ask the witness about it on cross, but you can't bring in other evidence (like documents or other witnesses) to prove it unless it's a conviction.

So, if the prosecutor asks Jones directly if he lied in the divorce trial, that's allowed on cross-examination to challenge his credibility. But if the prosecutor tries to bring in evidence outside of the cross-examination, like a transcript, that might not be allowed unless it's a conviction.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the prosecutor's question, not whether extrinsic evidence is allowed. So the question is whether the question is admissible at all.

In cross-examination, the prosecutor can ask about specific instances of conduct that relate to truthfulness. So, for example, if Jones was convicted of perjury, that's a crime of dishonesty and can be used to impeach him. But here, it's about a specific act of lying in a divorce trial, not a conviction.

So the rule I remember is that specific instances of a witness's conduct, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness's character for truthfulness, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. But the question is about the cross-examination, not extrinsic evidence.

Wait, the rule is FRE 608(b): specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence unless they resulted in a criminal conviction. So on cross-examination, you can ask the witness about those instances, but you can't bring in other evidence to prove them unless it's a conviction.

So in this case, the prosecutor is asking Jones about lying in the divorce trial. That's allowed on cross-examination because it's a specific instance of conduct that bears on his credibility. The question is about admissibility of the question, not about whether extrinsic evidence can be used to prove it.

But wait, the options are about the admissibility of the question. So the options are whether the court will allow the question.

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness. That sounds correct because it's about his honesty.

B: Admissible as it relates to the case at hand. I don't think that's the main issue here. It's more about credibility.

C: Admissible if prosecutor produces a certified copy of conviction. But no conviction is mentioned here, it's just about an act of lying.

D: Admissible because it shows character. No, because you can't bring in specific acts to show character except for truthfulness.

E: Not admissible because specific instances cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence. Wait, this is about cross-examination, not extrinsic evidence. The question is whether the question is admissible, not whether extrinsic evidence can be used.

F: Not admissible as hearsay. I don't think so because this is cross-examination, and the question is whether the statement is admissible for impeachment, not for the truth of the matter.

G: Admissible because it shows dishonesty. That seems to align with A.

H: Not admissible because irrelevant. No, credibility is relevant.

I: Not admissible because it's prejudicial. Prejudice is a different issue; the question is more about the rules of evidence for impeachment.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. FRE 608(b) says that specific instances of a witness's conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence, but can be brought up on cross-examination. So the question is allowed on cross, but if the witness denies it, you can't bring in other evidence to prove it.

So the prosecutor's question is allowed because it's about a specific instance of conduct that relates to truthfulness. Therefore, the question is admissible, which would make options A, G, etc., correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says it's admissible because it goes to credibility. That's correct.

Option G says admissible because it shows dishonesty, which is also correct.

Wait, but the answer might be E. Because the question could be about whether extrinsic evidence is allowed. Wait, wait, no. The question is about whether the question is admissible. The question itself is allowed, but any extrinsic evidence (like a transcript) would not be allowed unless it's a conviction.

So the question is admissible on cross-examination. Therefore, the objection would be overruled, and the question is allowed.

So among the options:

A: Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness.

E: Not admissible, because specific instances cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence. But the question is about the admissibility of the question, not the extrinsic evidence.

So the correct answer should be A or G.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option E says it's not admissible because specific instances can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. But the question is about the admissibility of the cross-examination question, not extrinsic evidence. So the court will likely overrule the objection, making the question admissible. So the correct answer would be A or G.

Another thought: FRE 613 deals with prior statements, but that's more about consistency. FRE 608(b) is about specific instances of conduct for credibility.

So, under 608(b), you can ask about specific instances on cross, but you can't prove them with extrinsic evidence unless it's a conviction.

So the answer should be that the question is admissible to attack credibility. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me think again. If the question is about a prior bad act that's not a conviction, can you ask about it on cross?

Yes, under FRE 608(b), you can ask the witness about specific instances of conduct that bear on their credibility. However, you can't use extrinsic evidence to prove those acts unless they resulted in a conviction.

So the question is admissible, making the correct answer A.

But wait, looking at the options, E says it's not admissible because specific instances can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. But the question doesn't involve extrinsic evidence; it's just the cross-examination question. So E is incorrect because it's talking about extrinsic evidence, which isn't the case here.

So the answer should be A: Admissible because the question goes to credibility.

Wait, but another angle: In some jurisdictions, you can't impeach a witness with a prior bad act unless it's a felony conviction. But I think under federal rules, 608(b) allows for specific instances of conduct (not necessarily convictions) to be inquired into on cross-examination, but you can't use extrinsic evidence unless it's a conviction.

So the cross-examination question is allowed, making the answer A.

But looking at the options again, option G says "admissible because it demonstrates Jones' dishonesty." That also sounds correct because it's about credibility.

So which is the better answer between A and G?

Option A is more about credibility as a witness, which is the correct reasoning. G is also correct but perhaps A is more precise.

Alternatively, another thought: wait, FRE 608(b) says that specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence, but can be inquired into on cross-examination. So the question is allowed, which makes the prosecutor's question admissible, so the attorney's objection would be overruled.

So the answer is either A or G, but in the options, I think A is the correct one.

Wait, but in the options, I think the correct answer is E, but I'm confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question is whether the court will hold the prosecutor's question is admissible. So if the question is admissible, the objection is overruled. If not, the objection is sustained.

Given that, the correct answer should be that the question is admissible, so the options that say admissible (A, B, C, D, G) are possible.

But the issue is that the question is about a specific instance of conduct (lying in the divorce trial) that's not a conviction. However, under FRE 608(b), you can ask about it on cross, but you can't bring in extrinsic evidence unless it's a conviction.

Therefore, the question is admissible, making the answer A.

So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm second-guessing because I remember that specific instances of conduct that are not resulting in a conviction can be used on cross but not with extrinsic evidence. So yes, the question is allowed, meaning the objection is overruled. So the answer is A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a prosecutor's question during cross-examination, which asks Jones about lying in a prior divorce trial. The key issue is whether this line of questioning is permissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Under FRE 608(b), specific instances of a witness's conduct that bear on their credibility for truthfulness can be inquired into during cross-examination. However, extrinsic evidence (e.g., documents or other witnesses) cannot be used to prove those instances unless they resulted in a criminal conviction. In this case, the prosecutor's question is about a specific instance of conduct (lying in the divorce trial) and does not involve extrinsic evidence. Therefore, the question is admissible for the purpose of attacking Jones' credibility as a witness.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The question is admissible because it goes to Jones' credibility as a witness, which is proper under FRE 608(b).
- **B**: Incorrect. The question does not relate to the case at hand but rather to Jones' credibility.
- **C**: Incorrect. A certified copy of a conviction is not required here, as the question is about a specific instance of conduct, not a conviction.
- **D**: Incorrect. The question is not about Jones' character but rather his credibility.
- **E**: Incorrect. This option misapplies the rule about extrinsic evidence, which is not at issue here.
- **F**: Incorrect. The question is not hearsay; it is asked for the purpose of impeachment.
- **G**: Correct in substance but less precise than A. While it highlights dishonesty, A better captures the legal rationale.
- **H**: Incorrect. The question is relevant to Jones' credibility.
- **I**: Incorrect. The question is not barred as prejudicial; it is a valid impeachment tactic.

The best answer is **A**, as it accurately reflects the admissibility of the question under FRE 608(b) to attack Jones' credibility.
