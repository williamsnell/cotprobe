Question:

A previously healthy 22-year-old college student is brought to the emergency department by her parents 20 minutes after they observed her having a seizure. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. She has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/mm3 , a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Migraine with aura
B: Bacterial meningitis
C: Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis
D: Herpes simplex encephalitis
E: Influenza encephalopathy
F: Dextromethorphan intoxication
G: Viral meningitis
H: HIV encephalopathy
I: Lyme disease
J: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis

Okay, let's tackle this question. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the patient is a 22-year-old college student who had a seizure, confusion, and some difficulty with words after. She's been having a headache, cough, and fever for three days, treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temp is 38.9°C, which is pretty high. 

The neurological exam shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status, she's confused with short-term memory issues, trouble naming objects, and makes literal paraphasic errors. The MRI shows bitemporal hyperintensities. The lumbar puncture results are: erythrocyte count 340/mm³, leukocyte count 121/mm³ (88% monocytes), protein 78 mg/dL.

Hmm, I remember that in CSF analysis, certain numbers can indicate different conditions. Let's think about each part.

First, the presence of erythrocytes (RBCs) in the CSF suggests bleeding, like a subarachnoid hemorrhage. But in this case, she doesn't have any signs of trauma or other symptoms pointing to that. Alternatively, sometimes in herpes simplex encephalitis, you can see some RBCs because the infection can cause necrosis and bleeding. Wait, but usually, bacterial meningitis doesn't have RBCs unless it's very severe, but I'm not too sure about that.

The leukocyte count is 121, which is elevated. But the majority are monocytes (88%). So, it's more of a lymphocytic pleocytosis, which is typical of viral infections rather than bacterial. Bacterial meningitis usually has a high neutrophil count, not monocytes. So that points away from bacterial meningitis, option B. Also, the protein is elevated at 78, which can happen in various conditions, including infections and inflammation.

Her MRI shows bitemporal hyperintensities. I know that herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) classically affects the temporal lobes, often bilaterally. So that's a strong clue pointing towards HSE. It's also associated with seizures, which she had.

Looking at her symptoms: after the seizure, she had confusion and difficulty with words—aphasia and possibly dysphasia. This suggests involvement of areas responsible for language, which are in the temporal lobes. The paraphasic errors are common in aphasia.

The CSF in HSE usually shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis (so high monocytes/lymphocytes), elevated protein, and sometimes RBCs due to necrosis. So the numbers here fit: 88% monocytes, protein 78. The presence of RBCs (340) supports this because HSE can cause some bleeding.

What about other options? Let's go through them.

Option C: Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis. EBV can cause neurological issues, but it's less common than HSE. The presentation might be similar, but I'm not sure about the MRI findings. EBV might not specifically target the temporal lobes as much as HSE does.

Option D is Herpes Simplex Encephalitis, which fits well with the bitemporal changes and CSF findings.

Option E: Influenza encephalopathy. I think this is more associated with acute encephalopathy, maybe with seizures, but I'm not sure about the MRI findings. Not sure if it causes bitemporal hyperintensities.

Option F: Dextromethorphan intoxication. She was taking dextromethorphan, which can cause CNS effects. It's an NMDA antagonist and can lead to agitation, hallucinations, or even seizures in overdose. But her symptoms after the seizure (like aphasia) don't fit as well. Also, the CSF findings wouldn't explain the RBCs and such.

Option G: Viral meningitis. Typically presents with lymphocytic pleocytosis, but the protein might not be as high. Also, viral meningitis doesn't usually cause focal neurological deficits like aphasia or seizures. It's more of a meningeal irritation—like headache, stiff neck, fever.

Option J: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). It's a demyelinating disease, often post-infectious. MRI shows multifocal white matter lesions, not specifically bitemporal. So probably not this.

Option A: Migraine with aura. Migraines can have neurological symptoms, but they don't cause bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI or CSF changes like this.

Option I: Lyme disease. Lyme can cause neurological issues like meningitis, but again, the MRI findings here don't match. Lyme's CSF usually shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, but the MRI wouldn't have bitemporal hyperintensities.

Option H: HIV encephalopathy. This is more of a chronic condition and might not present with acute seizures and focal findings like this.

So putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is Herpes Simplex Encephalitis, option D.
</think>

The patient is a 22-year-old college student who presented with a seizure, confusion, difficulty with word-finding, and short-term memory deficits. She had been experiencing headache, cough, and fever for three days, treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. Her temperature was 38.9°C, and neurological examination revealed diffuse hyperreflexia. MRI showed bitemporal hyperintensities, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an erythrocyte count of 340/mm³, a leukocyte count of 121/mm³ (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL.

The key findings pointing to the diagnosis include:

1. **Bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI**: This is a hallmark of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), which has a predilection for the temporal lobes.
2. **CSF analysis**: The presence of lymphocytic pleocytosis (elevated monocytes), elevated protein, and erythrocytes is consistent with HSE, as the infection can cause necrosis and bleeding in the temporal lobes.
3. **Clinical presentation**: The patient’s symptoms, including seizure, aphasia (difficulty naming objects and literal paraphasic errors), and confusion, align with temporal lobe involvement, which is characteristic of HSE.

Other options were considered but ruled out:
- **Bacterial meningitis (B)**: Typically presents with neutrophilic pleocytosis, not lymphocytic, and is less likely to cause bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI.
- **Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis (C)**: Less common and does not typically present with bitemporal hyperintensities.
- **Influenza encephalopathy (E)**: More associated with acute encephalopathy and not specific to bitemporal changes.
- **Dextromethorphan intoxication (F)**: Can cause CNS effects but does not explain the MRI or CSF findings.
- **Viral meningitis (G)**: Typically presents with meningeal signs and does not cause focal neurological deficits like aphasia or seizures.
- **Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (J)**: Characterized by multifocal white matter lesions on MRI, not bitemporal hyperintensities.
- **Lyme disease (I)** and **HIV encephalopathy (H)**: Do not align with the acute presentation and MRI findings.
- **Migraine with aura (A)**: Does not cause CSF changes or bitemporal hyperintensities.

The most likely diagnosis is **Herpes Simplex Encephalitis**.
