Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about therapy, specifically concerning concurrent individual and group therapy. I'm not too familiar with this topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking about a major concern that therapists have when a patient is undergoing both individual and group therapy at the same time. The options are from A to F, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to understand what the question is getting at. Concurrent individual and group therapy means the patient is seeing a therapist one-on-one and also participating in group sessions, maybe with another therapist. Some therapists don't support this because they think it might cause problems. The question is about identifying one of the main issues they're worried about.

Looking at the options:

A: Screening procedures may be ignored because the therapist is recommending group experience. So, this suggests that when a therapist refers a patient to group therapy, they might skip the necessary screening steps. That could be a problem, but I'm not sure if that's the main concern here. I think screening is usually done before starting any therapy, so maybe this isn't the top issue.

B: Patients start with group therapy, find other support sources, and then stop individual therapy too early. So, if a patient joins a group and gets support from others, maybe they feel they don't need individual sessions anymore and leave early. That could be a concern because individual therapy might be more tailored to their specific needs. But I'm not certain if this is the major issue therapists are worried about.

C: Patients wait until individual sessions to react to what happened in group. Hmm, so maybe in group therapy, things come up, but the patient doesn't process them in the group. Instead, they wait to talk about it one-on-one with their individual therapist. I can see how this might be a problem because group therapy is meant to be interactive and processing things there can be beneficial. If they hold back, the group experience might not be as effective. But is this the main concern?

D: Patients become reliant on group therapy and ignore individual sessions. This is similar to B but focuses more on ignoring individual therapy. I'm not sure if this is a major issue because both therapies serve different purposes. Maybe some patients rely more on group support, but I'm not certain if this is the primary concern.

E: Patients use their two therapists' words to refute group members' suggestions. So, if a patient has two therapists (one for individual and one for group), they might use one's advice to argue against what others in the group suggest. For example, if their individual therapist says something different, they might use that to dismiss others' ideas in the group. This could hinder the group dynamic and the patient's ability to consider different perspectives. That sounds like a plausible concern.

F: Therapists find it hard to manage both individual and group sessions for the same patient. This is about the therapist's workload and ability to handle both types of therapy for one patient. Managing both could be challenging, but I'm not sure if this is the main concern mentioned in the question. The question is about the patients' issues, I think, more than the therapists' administrative challenges.

Now, trying to remember what I've heard about this. I think one of the issues with concurrent therapies is that the patient might split their treatment. For example, they might talk about certain issues in individual therapy and others in group, or vice versa. This could lead to inconsistency or not fully addressing all issues in one setting. But wait, that's more about the patient not integrating their experiences.

The question is about the major concern. Another thought: if a patient is in both, they might get conflicting advice or have divided loyalties. But that's more about the therapists not coordinating, which isn't one of the options here.

Wait, looking back at the options, option E says patients use their therapists' words to refute group suggestions. So, if the individual therapist says something, the patient might use that in the group to argue against others' advice. For example, in group, someone suggests a behavior change, and the patient says, "But my individual therapist said I shouldn't do that." This could create conflict in the group and undermine the group's effectiveness.

Alternatively, option C talks about waiting to process group issues in individual therapy. That could be a problem because group therapy is meant to be a space for immediate interaction and processing. If the patient doesn't engage in the group and saves everything for individual sessions, the group might not be as helpful for them, and others in the group might not get the chance to support them.

So which is a bigger concern? I'm a bit torn between C and E. Let me think. In group therapy, the idea is that the group itself is a therapeutic agent. If the patient doesn't engage in the group and processes everything in individual therapy, the group's potential isn't fully utilized. That could be a significant issue because the patient isn't benefiting from the group as intended.

On the other hand, option E is about using therapists' words to counter others, which might disrupt the group dynamics. But I'm not sure if that's as common or as major a concern as the processing issue in C.

Wait, another angle. The question says "many therapists do not support it" because of a major concern. I think the concern is that patients might not take the group seriously or might not engage properly, which would be more about option C. Because if they wait until individual sessions to react, the group isn't serving its purpose of immediate interaction and support.

Alternatively, some resources I've read mention that one risk is that patients might split their therapy, discussing different issues in each setting, which can lead to confusion or incomplete treatment. But that's not exactly any of the options provided.

Another thought: maybe the concern is that the patient might not take the group therapy seriously because they have individual sessions as a backup, so they don't engage fully in the group. That could align with option C, where they process things individually rather than in the group.

So, putting it all together, I'm leaning towards option C being the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option E could be a concern, but I think option C is more directly related to the therapeutic process in the group setting.

The question concerns a major concern therapists have regarding concurrent individual and group therapy. The analysis evaluates each option:

- **Option A**: Suggests screening procedures might be ignored, but screening typically occurs before therapy begins, making this less likely to be the primary concern.
- **Option B**: Proposes that patients might terminate individual therapy early after finding group support. While plausible, this doesn't directly address the therapeutic process's effectiveness.
- **Option C**: Indicates patients may wait until individual sessions to process group experiences, potentially undermining the group's immediate therapeutic benefits. This aligns with the idea that group therapy is meant for real-time interaction and processing.
- **Option D**: Suggests reliance on group therapy over individual sessions, but both therapies serve different purposes, making this less likely to be the main issue.
- **Option E**: Points to patients using therapists' words to refute group suggestions, which could disrupt group dynamics. While valid, this may not be as central as the processing issue in Option C.
- **Option F**: Focuses on therapists' difficulty managing both therapies, which is more about administrative challenges than patient-related concerns.

The key concern seems to be that patients may not fully engage in group therapy if they reserve processing for individual sessions, reducing the group's effectiveness. This makes **Option C** the most fitting answer.
