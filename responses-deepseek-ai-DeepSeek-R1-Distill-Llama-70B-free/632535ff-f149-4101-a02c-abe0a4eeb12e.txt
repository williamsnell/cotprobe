Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the air-fuel ratio when burning producer gas with 50% excess air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the air-fuel ratio is calculated based on the stoichiometric (theoretical) amount of air needed for complete combustion and then adding the excess air on top of that. Since the question specifies 50% excess, I'll have to account for that.

The producer gas composition is given per mole of fuel. Let me list them out again to make sure I have all the values right:

- H2: 0.14 moles per mole fuel
- CO: 0.27 moles per mole fuel
- CH4: 0.03 moles per mole fuel
- O2: 0.006 moles per mole fuel
- N2: 0.509 moles per mole fuel
- CO2: 0.045 moles per mole fuel

Wait, so the fuel is a mixture of these gases. I need to write the combustion reactions for each component. The goal is to find the total moles of oxygen required for complete combustion, then determine the air required, considering the excess.

Let me recall the combustion reactions:

1. For Hydrogen (H2): 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
   So each mole of H2 needs 0.5 moles of O2.

2. Carbon monoxide (CO): 2CO + O2 → 2CO2
   Each mole of CO needs 0.5 moles of O2.

3. Methane (CH4): CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O
   Each mole of CH4 needs 2 moles of O2.

4. Oxygen (O2) in the fuel will actually subtract from the required oxygen, since it's already present.

5. Nitrogen (N2) is inert in combustion, so it doesn't react. Similarly, CO2 in the fuel is a product, so it doesn't need to react.

So the approach is to calculate the total moles of O2 needed for each combustible component, subtract the available O2 in the fuel, then find the total O2 needed from air. Then, since air is 23.2% O2 (approximately), I can find the moles of air required. After that, considering the 50% excess, multiply by 1.5.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate moles of O2 required:

Each component:

H2: 0.14 moles/fuel mole → needs 0.14 * 0.5 = 0.07 moles O2.

CO: 0.27 * 0.5 = 0.135 moles O2.

CH4: 0.03 * 2 = 0.06 moles O2.

Now sum these up: 0.07 + 0.135 + 0.06 = 0.265 moles O2 required.

But wait, the fuel already contains some O2. The fuel has 0.006 moles O2 per mole fuel. So that O2 can be used towards the required O2.

So the net O2 needed is 0.265 - 0.006 = 0.259 moles O2.

Wait, no, wait. No, because the O2 present in the fuel is part of the reactants. So when the fuel is burned, the available O2 in the fuel contributes to the combustion. So the total O2 required is the sum of what each combustible component needs, minus the O2 available in the fuel.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The O2 in the fuel is already present, so when the fuel is burned, the O2 in the fuel can be used for combustion. So the total O2 required from the air is the total needed by the fuel components minus the O2 present in the fuel.

So for example, if the fuel's combustible parts need X moles O2, and the fuel itself has Y moles O2, then the O2 needed from air is X - Y, but if X > Y. If Y > X, then perhaps there's excess O2, but I think in this case it's unlikely because the O2 in the fuel is small.

So, in this problem, X is 0.265, Y is 0.006. So O2 needed from air is 0.265 - 0.006 = 0.259 moles.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The O2 in the fuel is part of the combustion reaction. So the total O2 available is what's in the fuel plus what's in the air. So if the combustion requires a certain amount of O2, the O2 in the fuel can contribute to that requirement.

So the stoichiometric air would provide (O2 required - O2 in fuel). But if O2 required is less than O2 in fuel, that would imply excess O2, but that's not typical in a fuel.

In any case, let's proceed with the calculation.

So, O2 needed from air is 0.265 - 0.006 = 0.259 moles per mole fuel.

But wait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me reconsider: the O2 in the fuel is already present, so the amount of O2 needed from the air is the total O2 required minus the O2 in the fuel.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the O2 in the fuel is part of the fuel mixture. So when the fuel is burned, the O2 in the fuel is available to react. So for instance, if the fuel has O2, that O2 can be used for combustion, so the air doesn't need to supply as much.

So, for each mole of fuel, the O2 in the fuel is 0.006 moles. The combustion reactions require 0.265 moles O2. So the O2 needed from the air is 0.265 - 0.006 = 0.259 moles.

But wait, perhaps I should think of the total O2 required as the sum of the O2 needed by H2, CO, and CH4, but then subtract the O2 present in the fuel because that's already available.

Yes, that makes sense. So O2 needed from air is 0.259 moles per mole of fuel.

Now, the next step is to find out how much air is needed to supply this O2.

Air is approximately 23.2% O2 by mass, but wait, that's by mass. Alternatively, by mole, air is about 21% O2. Hmm, wait, I think I might be confusing mass and mole percentages. Let me clarify.

Molar composition of air is about 21% O2, 78% N2, and 1% other gases. So by mole, O2 is 21% or 0.21 in air.

So, if I have a certain number of moles of O2 needed, I can find the moles of air needed by dividing by 0.21.

Wait, but the problem asks for the air-fuel ratio in lbm air per lbm fuel, so I might need to calculate using molar masses.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute everything in terms of moles first, then convert to mass.

So, moles of O2 needed from air: 0.259 moles per mole fuel.

Moles of air needed (stoichiometric) = 0.259 / 0.21 ≈ 1.233 moles air per mole fuel.

But wait, that's without considering excess air. The problem states 50% excess air, which means the actual air is 1.5 times the stoichiometric amount.

So total moles of air = 1.233 * 1.5 = 1.85 moles air per mole fuel.

Wait, but that's the moles. Now, to find the mass ratio, I need to find the mass of air and mass of fuel.

So, molar mass of air is approximately 28.97 g/mol (roughly 29 g/mol). Let's use 28.97 for accuracy.

Mass of air per mole of fuel = 1.85 moles * 28.97 g/mol = let's compute that.

1.85 * 28.97 = ?

Well, 1.8 * 28.97 is approximately 52.146. 0.05 *28.97=1.4485. So total ≈53.5945 g.

Mass of fuel: I need to find the molar mass of the fuel. The fuel is a mixture of gases, so I'll calculate the average molar mass.

The fuel composition is given per mole of fuel:

H2: 0.14 moles → molar mass 2 g/mol → 0.14 *2=0.28 g
CO: 0.27 → 28 g/mol → 0.27*28=7.56 g
CH4: 0.03 → 16 g/mol → 0.03*16=0.48 g
O2:0.006 →32 g/mol →0.006*32=0.192 g
N2:0.509 →28 g/mol →0.509*28≈14.252 g
CO2:0.045 →44 g/mol →0.045*44≈1.98 g

Sum these up: 0.28 +7.56=7.84; +0.48=8.32; +0.192=8.512; +14.252=22.764; +1.98=24.744 g/mol.

So the molar mass of the fuel is approximately 24.744 g/mol.

Now, the mass of air per mole fuel is 53.5945 g, and mass of fuel is 24.744 g. So the air-fuel ratio by mass is 53.5945 /24.744 ≈ let's compute that.

53.5945 ÷24.744 ≈ let's see:

24.744 * 2 =49.488 → 53.5945-49.488=4.1065 → 4.1065/24.744≈0.166 → so total is ≈2.166.

Wait, that's approximately 2.166 lbm air per lbm fuel.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.17 lbm air/lbm fuel, which matches this calculation.

But wait a minute, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, calculating O2 needed:

H2: 0.14 * 0.5 =0.07
CO:0.27*0.5=0.135
CH4:0.03 *2=0.06
Total O2 needed: 0.07+0.135+0.06=0.265

Subtract O2 in fuel: 0.006 → 0.265-0.006=0.259

Moles of air (stoich) =0.259 /0.21=1.2333

With 50% excess, multiply by 1.5: 1.2333 *1.5=1.85 moles air.

Mass of air: 1.85 *28.97≈53.5945 g

Molar mass of fuel: sum of each component's (moles * molar mass) as above, which was 24.744 g/mol.

Mass ratio:53.5945 /24.744 ≈2.166 → ~2.17 lbm air/lbm fuel.

So the correct answer should be option A: 2.17 lbm air/lbm fuel.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 1.85 lbm air/lbm fuel, but that's the moles I calculated before converting to mass. So that's not it. So yeah, the correct option is A.

To determine the air-fuel ratio for the combustion of the given producer gas with 50% excess air, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the moles of oxygen required for complete combustion**:
   - Hydrogen (H₂): \( 0.14 \, \text{moles} \times 0.5 = 0.07 \, \text{moles O}_2 \)
   - Carbon monoxide (CO): \( 0.27 \, \text{moles} \times 0.5 = 0.135 \, \text{moles O}_2 \)
   - Methane (CH₄): \( 0.03 \, \text{moles} \times 2 = 0.06 \, \text{moles O}_2 \)
   - Total O₂ required: \( 0.07 + 0.135 + 0.06 = 0.265 \, \text{moles O}_2 \)

2. **Account for the oxygen present in the fuel**:
   - The fuel contains \( 0.006 \, \text{moles O}_2 \), which reduces the O₂ needed from air:  
     \( 0.265 - 0.006 = 0.259 \, \text{moles O}_2 \).

3. **Calculate the moles of air required**:
   - Air is approximately 21% oxygen by mole, so the moles of air needed (stoichiometric) are:  
     \( \frac{0.259}{0.21} \approx 1.233 \, \text{moles air} \).

4. **Include 50% excess air**:
   - Total moles of air = \( 1.233 \times 1.5 = 1.85 \, \text{moles air} \).

5. **Convert moles of air to mass**:
   - The molar mass of air is approximately \( 28.97 \, \text{g/mol} \), so the mass of air is:  
     \( 1.85 \times 28.97 \approx 53.5945 \, \text{g} \).

6. **Calculate the molar mass of the fuel**:
   - Using the given composition:
     - H₂: \( 0.14 \times 2 = 0.28 \, \text{g} \)
     - CO: \( 0.27 \times 28 = 7.56 \, \text{g} \)
     - CH₄: \( 0.03 \times 16 = 0.48 \, \text{g} \)
     - O₂: \( 0.006 \times 32 = 0.192 \, \text{g} \)
     - N₂: \( 0.509 \times 28 = 14.252 \, \text{g} \)
     - CO₂: \( 0.045 \times 44 = 1.98 \, \text{g} \)
   - Total molar mass of fuel: \( 0.28 + 7.56 + 0.48 + 0.192 + 14.252 + 1.98 = 24.744 \, \text{g/mol} \).

7. **Calculate the air-fuel mass ratio**:
   - Mass of air per mass of fuel:  
     \( \frac{53.5945}{24.744} \approx 2.166 \, \text{lbm air/lbm fuel} \).

8. **Final result**:
   - The closest option to the calculated value is **2.17 lbm air/lbm fuel**.
