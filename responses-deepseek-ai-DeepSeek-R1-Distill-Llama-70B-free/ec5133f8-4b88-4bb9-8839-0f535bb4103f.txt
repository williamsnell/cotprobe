Okay, so I've got this question about psychology treatments for anorexia nervosa. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that Zoe's doctors used three approaches: intravenous feeding tubes, trying to change her irrational belief that she's too fat, and discussing her early family relationships. I need to figure out which psychological approach this combination falls under.

First, let me break down each part of the treatment.

1. **Intravenous feeding tubes**: That seems like a medical intervention. It's probably to ensure she's getting the nutrients she needs because she's not eating enough. This is more of a biological or medical approach, maybe.

2. **Changing irrational beliefs**: Hmm, that sounds familiar. I remember that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns. So that's the cognitive part—helping her see that her belief about being fat isn't realistic.

3. **Discussing early family relationships**: This makes me think of psychoanalysis or psychodynamic therapy. Those approaches look at how past experiences, especially in early life and family dynamics, influence current behavior and thoughts. So exploring how her family upbringing might have contributed to her anorexia fits here.

Now, putting it all together. The treatment uses three methods: a biological/medical intervention, cognitive techniques, and exploring past family issues. That sounds like an approach that combines different methods. I'm trying to remember the different therapeutic approaches.

Behaviorist approaches focus on observable behaviors and learning, using techniques like conditioning. That doesn't seem to fit here because there's more going on than just behavior—cognition and past experiences are involved.

Cognitive Behavioral (CBT) would cover the part about changing irrational beliefs but doesn't usually include the family history aspect or the medical feeding. So maybe not just CBT.

Humanistic approaches, like person-centered therapy, focus on personal growth and self-actualization, with a non-judgmental therapist. I don't think that's what's happening here because the doctors are actively intervening with specific techniques.

Psychoanalytic or Psychodynamic therapy emphasizes unconscious thoughts and past experiences. The part about family relationships fits, but the other two parts (feeding and cognitive) don't quite match. So maybe not purely psychoanalytic.

Socio-cultural approaches consider the impact of societal and cultural factors. The question doesn't mention anything about society or culture, so probably not this.

Eclectic approach means using a variety of methods from different theories. The treatment here uses medical, cognitive, and psychodynamic elements. So that sounds like an eclectic approach because it's combining multiple methods.

Wait, but the options are A through J, so I need to check if eclectic is one of them. Looking back, option G is eclectic.

Alternatively, could this be a form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? Because CBT does sometimes incorporate some behavioral techniques and maybe some exploration of thoughts, but I'm not sure if it includes discussing early family relationships as a primary focus. Also, the IV feeding is a medical intervention, which isn't a part of CBT itself.

So the treatment uses multiple approaches: medical for feeding, cognitive for beliefs, and psychodynamic for family history. That makes me think it's eclectic, using whatever methods are effective from different theories.

So the answer should be G: eclectic.

The treatment approach for Zoe's anorexia nervosa combines three distinct methods: intravenous feeding (a biological/medical intervention), changing irrational beliefs (cognitive techniques), and exploring early family relationships (psychodynamic elements). This integration of multiple therapeutic strategies—medical, cognitive, and psychodynamic—indicates an eclectic approach, which draws from various theories to tailor treatment to the individual's needs.

Answer: G
