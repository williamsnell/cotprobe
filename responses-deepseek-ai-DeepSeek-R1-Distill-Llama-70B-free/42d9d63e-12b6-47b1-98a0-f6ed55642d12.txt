Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about finding the smallest positive integer n, where n is greater than 1, such that the product of its positive divisors equals n raised to the 6th power. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down.

Alright, I remember something about the product of the divisors of a number. I think the formula involves the number of divisors. Oh right, for a number n, if it has k divisors, then the product of all the divisors is n^(k/2). Because each divisor pairs with another to multiply to n. So like, if d is a divisor, then n/d is also a divisor, and their product is n. So for k divisors, you have k/2 such pairs, making the total product n^(k/2).

So according to the problem, the product of the divisors is n^6. That means n^(k/2) equals n^6. So I can set up the equation n^(k/2) = n^6. Wait, but wait a second, n is the same on both sides, so as long as n isn't 1 (which it isn't because n>1), I can equate the exponents. So k/2 must equal 6. That means k equals 12. So the number of divisors of n must be 12.

So now the problem reduces to finding the smallest n>1 that has exactly 12 divisors. Because the product of its divisors will then be n^6.

Now I need to recall how to find the number of divisors a number has based on its prime factorization. Oh right, if a number n is factored into primes as n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then the number of divisors k is (a1+1)(a2+1)...(an+1). So for k=12, I need to find exponents a1, a2, etc., such that their increments multiply to 12.

So I have to find all possible combinations of exponents (a1, a2, ...) where each ai is a positive integer, and (a1+1)(a2+1)... =12. Then, for each combination, compute the corresponding n and find the smallest one.

Let me list all the factorizations of 12 into integers greater than 1, since each (ai+1) must be at least 2.

12 can be broken down as:
- 12 → which would mean a single prime with exponent 11. So n would be 2^11 = 2048.
- 6 * 2 → this would correspond to exponents 5 and 1. So n would be 2^5 *3^1 = 32*3=96, or 2^5 *3^1=96? Alternatively, could it be 2^1 *3^5, which is 2*243=486, which is bigger than 96.
- 4 * 3 → exponents 3 and 2. So n would be 2^3 *3^2=8*9=72. Or 2^2 *3^3=4*27=108, which is bigger than 72.
- 3 * 2 * 2 → exponents 2,1,1. So n would be 2^2 *3^1 *5^1=4*3*5=60. Or other combinations like 2^1 *3^2 *5^1= 2*9*5=90, which is bigger than 60.

So now I can list all the possible n's:

1. 2^11=2048
2. 2^5 *3=96
3. 2^3 *3^2=72
4. 2^2 *3*5=60

Wait, I also need to check if there are any other factor combinations. Let me see. 12 can also be 12= 2*2*3, which is the same as the 3,2,2 case. So I think I have all the cases.

Now among these possible n's, which is the smallest? Let's list them:

2048, 96, 72, 60. So 60 is the smallest among these. Wait, but wait, I think I might have missed some other factorizations. Let me see.

Wait, 12 can also be 12= (3)(4), which is the same as the exponents 2 and 3. So that gives 3^2 *2^3=9*8=72, which we have.

Alternatively, 12= (2)(6), exponents 1 and 5, giving 2^5 *3^1=32*3=96, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: 12 can also be (2)(2)(3), which is the same as exponents 1,1,2. So n would be 2^1 *3^1 *5^2= 2*3*25=150, which is larger than 60. Alternatively, exponents 1,1,2 assigned differently: 2^2 *3^1 *5^1=4*3*5=60. Oh wait, so that is the same as the (3,2,2) case. So 60 is indeed the minimal.

So the options given are A:2048, B:30, C:60, D:120, E:36, F:72, G:20, H:12, I:10, J:64.

Looking at these, 60 is option C. So the answer is C:60. But wait, I should double-check.

Wait, let me calculate the number of divisors for each option and see if it's 12.

Option B is 30. Let's factorize 30. 30=2*3*5. So exponents are 1,1,1. Number of divisors is (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=2*2*2=8. Not 12.

Option C:60. 60=2^2 *3^1 *5^1. So exponents 2,1,1. Number of divisors is (2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=3*2*2=12. Yes, that's correct.

Option E:36. 36=2^2 *3^2. So exponents 2 and 2. Number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1)=9. Not 12.

Option F:72. 72=2^3 *3^2. So exponents 3 and 2. Number of divisors (3+1)(2+1)=4*3=12. So 72 also has 12 divisors. But 60 is smaller than 72, so 60 is better.

Option G:20. 20=2^2 *5^1. Exponents 2,1. Divisors: (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6. Not 12.

Option H:12. 12=2^2 *3^1. Exponents 2,1. Divisors: (2+1)(1+1)=6. Not 12.

Option I:10. 10=2*5. Exponents 1,1. Divisors: 4. Not 12.

Option J:64. 64=2^6. Exponents 6. Divisors: 6+1=7. Not 12.

So the only options with exactly 12 divisors are C (60) and F (72). Between them, 60 is smaller, so the correct answer is C:60.

Wait, but looking back, I thought earlier that 60 was the minimal n with 12 divisors. So that's correct.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n > 1 \) such that the product of its positive divisors equals \( n^6 \). 

The product of the divisors of \( n \) is given by \( n^{k/2} \), where \( k \) is the number of divisors of \( n \). Setting \( n^{k/2} = n^6 \), we find \( k/2 = 6 \), so \( k = 12 \). Therefore, \( n \) must have exactly 12 divisors.

The number of divisors \( k \) of a number \( n \) with prime factorization \( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \dots p_m^{a_m} \) is given by \( k = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \dots (a_m + 1) \). To find the smallest \( n \) with \( k = 12 \), we consider the factorizations of 12:

1. \( 12 = 12 \): This corresponds to \( n = p^{11} \). The smallest \( n \) in this case is \( 2^{11} = 2048 \).
2. \( 12 = 6 \times 2 \): This corresponds to \( n = p^5 q \). The smallest \( n \) is \( 2^5 \cdot 3 = 96 \).
3. \( 12 = 4 \times 3 \): This corresponds to \( n = p^3 q^2 \). The smallest \( n \) is \( 2^3 \cdot 3^2 = 72 \).
4. \( 12 = 3 \times 2 \times 2 \): This corresponds to \( n = p^2 q r \). The smallest \( n \) is \( 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 60 \).

Among these, the smallest \( n \) is \( 60 \). Verifying the number of divisors for \( n = 60 \), its prime factorization is \( 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \), and the number of divisors is \( (2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12 \), confirming it has exactly 12 divisors.

Thus, the smallest \( n \) is \( 60 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
