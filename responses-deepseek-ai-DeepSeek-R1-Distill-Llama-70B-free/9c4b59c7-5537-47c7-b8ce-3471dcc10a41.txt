Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It says that the temperature of the fireball in a thermonuclear explosion is about 10^7 K, and I need to find the corresponding wavelength lambda_max. The options are from A to J, each with different values in meters.

Hmm, I remember something about blackbody radiation and wavelength. Oh right, there's Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law, I think. It states that the product of the peak wavelength (lambda_max) and the temperature (T) of a blackbody is a constant. The formula is lambda_max * T = b, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

Wait, what's the value of that constant? I think it's approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K. Yeah, that sounds right. So I can rearrange the formula to solve for lambda_max. That would be lambda_max = b / T.

The temperature given is 10^7 K. Let me plug that into the formula. So lambda_max = (2.898e-3 m·K) / (1e7 K). 

Let me calculate that. Let's see, 2.898e-3 divided by 1e7. Dividing by 1e7 is the same as multiplying by 1e-7. So 2.898e-3 * 1e-7 = 2.898e-10. Oh wait, but wait, actually, the calculation is (2.898e-3) / (1e7) = (2.898 / 1e10) ) = 2.898e-10 meters.

So that's 2.898 times 10^-10 meters. Looking at the options, I need to find the closest one. Let's see the options again.

Option A is 2e-10, B is 1e-10, C is 7e-10, D is 6e-10, E is4e-10, F is 0.5e-10, G is8e-10, H is3e-10, I is5e-10, J is 2.5e-10.

Wait, 2.898e-10 is approximately 2.9e-10. So the closest option would be A: 2e-10, J:2.5e-10, or none? Let me check the options again.

Option A is 2e-10. Option J is 2.5e-10. Hmm, 2.9 is closer to 3. Wait, but none of the options exactly match 2.9e-10. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait. 2.898e-3 divided by 1e7 is 2.898e-3 /1e7 = (2.898 / 1e10) = 2.898e-10. Yes, that's correct. So 2.898e-10 meters is the value.

Looking at the options, the closest one is either A (2e-10) or J (2.5e-10). 2.9 is closer to 3, but 3e-10 is option H. Wait, but option H is 3e-10. Hmm, but 2.898 is nearly 2.9, which is closer to 3.

Wait, but I'm getting lambda_max as approximately 2.9e-10 m. So the options don't have exactly 2.9. So maybe I should choose the closest one. The options don't have 2.9e-10, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Wien's constant is 2.8977719e-3 m·K. So exact value is approximately 2.898e-3 m·K.

So lambda_max = (2.898e-3) / (1e7) = 2.898e-10 m. So 2.898e-10 is 2.898 x10^-10 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest one would be option J, which is 2.5e-10, but that's 0.4e-10 less. Option A is 2e-10, which is 0.898e-10 less. Wait, 2.898 is closer to 3, but the options for 3 are option H, which is 3e-10. So 2.898 is 0.102 away from 3, whereas 2.898 is 0.898 away from 2. So which is closer?

Alternatively, perhaps I should see which option is just below 2.898e-10. Let me see: 2e-10 is option A, 2.5e-10 is J, 3e-10 is H. So 2.898 is between 2.5 and 3. The difference between 2.898 and 2.5 is 0.398e-10, and between 2.898 and 3 is 0.102e-10. So 2.898 is closer to 3e-10 than to 2.5e-10.

Wait, no, wait, 2.898 is 2.898, so 2.5 is 0.398 units away, 3 is 0.102 units away. So 3 is closer. So the correct answer would be the option with 3e-10 m. Looking at the options, option H is 3e-10. So the correct choice would be H.

But wait, the initial calculation gave me 2.898e-10, which is closer to 2.9, which is near 3. But wait, none of the other options are 2.9. So I have to pick the closest option. So between 2.5 and 3, which is it closer to?

Wait, 2.898 is 2.898, so 2.9 is nearly 3. So option H is 3e-10. Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the significant figures. The temperature is given as 1e7 K, which is one significant figure. Wien's constant is known to more significant figures, but when using it in calculations, the result's precision is determined by the given data.

Wait, let me think about significant figures. The temperature is 1e7 K, which could be written as 10^7. That's one significant figure. Wien's constant is about 2.898e-3, which has four significant figures. So when we divide, the result should have one significant figure.

So lambda_max would be approximately 3e-10 meters when rounded to one significant figure. Because 2.898e-10 is approximately 3e-10. So the correct answer would be H: 3e-10 m.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 3e-10 m. So that's the choice.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused because I thought the calculation was 2.898e-10, but considering significant figures, it's 3e-10. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the wavelength $\lambda_{\max}$ corresponding to a temperature of $T = 10^7 \, \mathrm{K}$, we use Wien's displacement law:

\[
\lambda_{\max} T = b
\]

where $b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m \cdot K}$ is Wien's displacement constant. Rearranging for $\lambda_{\max}$:

\[
\lambda_{\max} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

Substituting $b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m \cdot K}$ and $T = 10^7 \, \mathrm{K}$:

\[
\lambda_{\max} = \frac{2.898 \times 10^{-3}}{10^7} = 2.898 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

This value, $2.898 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$, is closest to $3 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ when rounded to one significant figure, as the temperature $T = 10^7 \, \mathrm{K}$ is given with one significant figure. Among the provided options:

- **Option A:** $2 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too low.
- **Option B:** $1 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too low.
- **Option C:** $7 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too high.
- **Option D:** $6 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too high.
- **Option E:** $4 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too high.
- **Option F:** $0.5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too low.
- **Option G:** $8 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too high.
- **Option H:** $3 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Closest to $2.898 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$.
- **Option I:** $5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Too high.
- **Option J:** $2.5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ — Slightly closer than $2 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$ but still not as close as $3 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$.

Thus, the best match is **Option H: $3 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}$**.
