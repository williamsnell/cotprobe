Okay, so I have this problem about mixing ethanol and water and the change in volume when they're mixed. Hmm, I remember that when you mix two liquids, sometimes the total volume isn't just the sum of the individual volumes because the molecules can pack together more efficiently or something like that. So the question is about the change in volume relative to the pure components.

The problem gives me the densities of pure water and ethanol. Water is 997 kg/m³ and ethanol is 789 kg/m³. Wait, but I think I might need molar masses to calculate moles. Oh wait, the problem also gives partial molar volumes for each in the solution. Partial molar volume is the change in volume when you add a mole of substance to a large volume of the solution. So maybe I don't need the densities for calculating moles after all. Maybe the question is more about using the partial molar volumes directly.

The mole fraction of ethanol is 0.35. So in the solution, the mole fraction of water must be 0.65 because they add up to 1. 

The problem asks to calculate the change in volume when 2.50 L of this solution is prepared. So I think I need to find the total volume of the pure components before mixing and subtract the volume of the solution. The difference would be the change.

Wait, no, wait. The change in volume is the volume of the solution minus the sum of the volumes of the pure components. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. When you mix, if the solution's volume is less than the sum, the change is negative. So the change ΔV is V_solution - (V_water_pure + V_ethanol_pure). So if the solution is less, ΔV is negative, meaning volume decreases.

But how do I find the moles of each component in the solution? Because I have the partial molar volumes, which are given as 55.2 L/mol for ethanol and 17.8 mL/mol for water. Wait, let me check the units again. Oh, 17.8 ×10^-3 L/mol. So ethanol is 55.2e-3 L/mol? Wait no, wait. Wait, 55.2 is ×10^something? Let me look again. Oh, the question says 55.2 and 17.8 ×10^-3 L/mol. Oh wait, no. The question says 55.2 L/mol for ethanol and 17.8 ×10^-3 L/mol for water. Wait, no, let me read again:

"The partial molar volumes of ethanol and water are 55.2 and 17.8 ×10^-3 L mol^-1, respectively." So ethanol is 55.2 L/mol? That seems really high because molar volume of water is around 18 mL/mol, which matches the 17.8 here. But ethanol's molar volume as 55 L/mol would be 55,000 mL/mol, which seems way too high. Because the molar mass of ethanol is about 46 g/mol. So density is 789 kg/m³, which is 789 g/L. So molar volume is (46 g/mol) / (789 g/L) ≈ 0.0583 L/mol, which is 58.3 mL/mol. Hmm, but the partial molar volume given is 55.2 mL/mol, which is close. Wait, maybe the question has a typo, or perhaps the units are different. Let me not get stuck on that.

So, I'm to calculate the change in volume. So for the solution, the total volume is 2.50 L. But if I were to take pure water and pure ethanol and mix them to get the same number of moles as in the solution, their combined volume would be different. The change is the difference between these two.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles. The solution's volume is sum of n_ethanol * Vm_ethanol + n_water * Vm_water. But wait, no, the partial molar volume is the contribution of each mole to the solution's volume. So the total volume is n1V1 + n2V2, where V1 and V2 are the partial molar volumes.

But to find the change, I need to compare it to the volumes of the pure substances. So for each mole of ethanol and water in the solution, what would their volume have been as pure substances?

So, for pure ethanol, the molar volume is (molar mass)/(density). Let me calculate that.

Molar mass of ethanol is approx 46.07 g/mol. Density is 789 kg/m³ = 789 g/L. So pure ethanol's molar volume is 46.07 g/mol / (789 g/L) ≈ 0.0583 L/mol, which is 58.3 mL/mol.

Similarly, for water: molar mass is 18.015 g/mol, density 997 kg/m³=997 g/L. So molar volume is 18.015 /997 ≈ 0.01807 L/mol, which is 18.07 mL/mol.

So for pure components, the molar volumes are about 58.3 mL/mol (ethanol) and 18.07 mL/mol (water). But in the solution, their partial molar volumes are 55.2 mL/mol (ethanol) and 17.8 mL/mol (water). Wait, that's a bit lower than pure. So when you mix, each component's molar volume decreases a bit. So the solution's volume would be less than the sum of the pure volumes, I think.

Wait, but the problem states that for x_ethanol=0.35, the partial molar volumes are 55.2 and 17.8 ×10^-3 L/mol. So ethanol's partial molar volume is 55.2 mL/mol (since 0.0552 L/mol is 55.2 mL/mol?), wait no, wait: 55.2 ×10^-3 L/mol is 55.2 mL/mol. Similarly, 17.8 ×10^-3 L/mol is 17.8 mL/mol.

So, the solution's volume is 2.50 L. But if I had the same moles of ethanol and water in their pure forms, their combined volume would be higher or lower?

Hmm. Let's see. Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the moles of ethanol and water in the solution.
2. Calculate the volume each would occupy as pure substances.
3. Sum those volumes.
4. Subtract the solution's volume (2.50 L) to find the change.

So first, find moles in the solution.

The solution has a mole fraction of ethanol x_ethanol = 0.35, so mole fraction of water is 0.65.

Let n_total be the total moles in the solution. Then moles of ethanol, n_e = 0.35 n_total, and moles of water, n_w = 0.65 n_total.

The total volume of the solution is V = n_e * Vm_e + n_w * Vm_w.

Vm_e is 55.2 mL/mol (0.0552 L/mol), and Vm_w is 17.8 mL/mol (0.0178 L/mol).

So V (in L) = (n_e * 0.0552) + (n_w * 0.0178 )

But n_e = 0.35 n_total, n_w = 0.65 n_total.

So V = n_total [0.35 *0.0552 + 0.65 *0.0178 ].

Plugging in the numbers:

0.35 * 0.0552 = let's calculate: 0.35 * 0.0552 = 0.01932.

0.65 * 0.0178 = 0.01157.

Sum is 0.01932 + 0.01157 = 0.03089 L/mol.

So V = n_total * 0.03089 L/mol.

We know V is 2.50 L, so:

n_total = 2.50 / 0.03089 ≈ let's compute that.

2.50 / 0.03089 ≈ approx 80.93 moles.

Wait, wait, 0.03089 L per mole, so 1 mole is 0.03089 L. So 2.50 L is 2.50 / 0.03089 ≈ 80.93 moles total.

So n_total ≈80.93 mol.

Then, moles of ethanol n_e = 0.35 *80.93 ≈ 28.326 mol.

Moles of water n_w = 0.65 *80.93≈52.6045 mol.

Now, for the pure components, the volume each would occupy:

Volume_eth_pure = n_e * (Vm_eth_pure) = 28.326 mol * (0.0583 L/mol) → because earlier we calculated pure ethanol's molar volume as ~0.0583 L/mol.

Wait, let me compute that.

28.326 * 0.0583 ≈ hmm. 28 *0.0583 is about 1.6324, and 0.326*0.0583≈0.0190. So total ≈1.6514 L.

Similarly, for water: n_w * Vm_water_pure.

Vm_water_pure is 0.01807 L/mol.

52.6045 mol * 0.01807 L/mol ≈ let's compute.

50 mol * 0.01807 = 0.9035 L.

2.6045 mol * 0.01807 ≈ approx 0.04705 L.

Total ≈0.9035 +0.04705=0.95055 L.

So the total volume of pure components is approx 1.6514 +0.95055 =2.60195 L.

The solution's volume is 2.50 L. So the change in volume is solution volume minus sum of pure volumes.

ΔV = 2.50 L - 2.60195 L ≈ -0.10195 L, which is approximately -0.102 L.

Looking at the options, option D is -0.10 L, option G is -0.05, etc. So the closest is D: -0.10 L.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are a bit messy.

Alternative approach: Maybe I can compute the volume contraction without going through moles.

Wait, perhaps a quicker way. Since the partial molar volume is the contribution to the solution's volume, and the pure molar volumes are known, perhaps the change in volume can be found by (n_e (Vm_e_solution - Vm_e_pure) ) + (n_w (Vm_w_solution - Vm_w_pure) )).

So ΔV = n_e (55.2 mL - pure_ethanol_molar_volume) + n_w (17.8 mL - pure_water_molar_volume).

Wait, but wait, because the pure molar volumes in mL are 58.3 mL/mol for ethanol and 18.07 mL/mol for water.

So,

ΔV = n_e (55.2 -58.3) + n_w (17.8 -18.07)

= n_e (-3.1) + n_w (-0.27)

But n_e is 28.326, n_w is 52.6045.

So, ΔV = 28.326*(-3.1) +52.6045*(-0.27)

Compute each term:

28.326 * (-3.1) = approx -87.81 mL.

52.6045 * (-0.27) = approx -14.203 mL.

Total ΔV ≈-87.81 -14.203 = -101.013 mL → which is -0.101 L.

So the change is about -0.101 L, which is approximately -0.10 L.

So the answer should be D: -0.10 L.

To calculate the change in volume when 2.50 L of a solution with $x_{\text{ethanol}} = 0.35$ is prepared, we compare the volume of the solution to the combined volume of the pure components. The partial molar volumes of ethanol and water in the solution are given as $55.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{L/mol}$ and $17.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{L/mol}$, respectively. The molar volumes of pure ethanol and water are calculated using their molar masses and densities:

- Pure ethanol: $\frac{46.07 \, \mathrm{g/mol}}{789 \, \mathrm{g/L}} = 0.0583 \, \mathrm{L/mol} = 58.3 \, \mathrm{mL/mol}$  
- Pure water: $\frac{18.015 \, \mathrm{g/mol}}{997 \, \mathrm{g/L}} = 0.01807 \, \mathrm{L/mol} = 18.07 \, \mathrm{mL/mol}$.

### Step 1: Calculate the total moles in the solution
The total volume of the solution is $2.50 \, \mathrm{L}$. Using the partial molar volumes and mole fractions ($x_{\text{ethanol}} = 0.35$, $x_{\text{water}} = 0.65$), the total molar volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{m, total}} = (0.35 \times 0.0552) + (0.65 \times 0.0178) = 0.03089 \, \mathrm{L/mol}.
\]

The total moles in the solution are:

\[
n_{\text{total}} = \frac{V_{\text{solution}}}{V_{\text{m, total}}} = \frac{2.50}{0.03089} \approx 80.93 \, \mathrm{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of ethanol and water
Using the mole fractions:

\[
n_{\text{ethanol}} = 0.35 \times 80.93 \approx 28.326 \, \mathrm{mol}, \quad n_{\text{water}} = 0.65 \times 80.93 \approx 52.6045 \, \mathrm{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the volume of pure components
The volume of pure ethanol is:

\[
V_{\text{ethanol, pure}} = n_{\text{ethanol}} \times V_{\text{m, ethanol, pure}} = 28.326 \times 0.0583 \approx 1.6514 \, \mathrm{L}.
\]

The volume of pure water is:

\[
V_{\text{water, pure}} = n_{\text{water}} \times V_{\text{m, water, pure}} = 52.6045 \times 0.01807 \approx 0.95055 \, \mathrm{L}.
\]

The total volume of the pure components is:

\[
V_{\text{pure, total}} = V_{\text{ethanol, pure}} + V_{\text{water, pure}} = 1.6514 + 0.95055 \approx 2.60195 \, \mathrm{L}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the change in volume
The change in volume is the difference between the solution volume and the total volume of the pure components:

\[
\Delta V = V_{\text{solution}} - V_{\text{pure, total}} = 2.50 - 2.60195 \approx -0.10195 \, \mathrm{L}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, $\Delta V \approx -0.10 \, \mathrm{L}$.

### Final Answer:
The change in volume is approximately $-0.10 \, \mathrm{L}$, which corresponds to **option D**.
