Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of N₂O₄ into NO₂. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stoichiometry, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question says that at 273 K and 1 atm, 1 liter of N₂O₄ decomposes. The reaction is N₂O₄ ⇌ 2 NO₂. We need to find out to what extent the decomposition has proceeded when the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. Wait, that wording is a bit tricky. Let me clarify.

So initially, we have 1 liter of N₂O₄. As it decomposes, it produces NO₂. The volume changes because the number of moles of gas changes. Since gases at the same temperature and pressure have volumes proportional to their moles, I can track the volume changes to find out how much decomposition has occurred.

The problem states that the original volume (which was 1 liter) is 25% less than the existing volume after decomposition. Wait, no, the wording is: "when the original volume is 25 percent less than the existing volume." Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me parse it again.

Oh wait, the original volume is 1 liter. After decomposition, the volume is higher because each mole of N₂O₄ produces two moles of NO₂. So if the original volume is V_initial = 1 L, and after decomposition, the volume V_final is such that V_initial is 25% less than V_final. Wait, that would mean V_initial = V_final - 0.25 V_final = 0.75 V_final. So 1 L = 0.75 V_final → V_final = 1 / 0.75 ≈ 1.333... liters.

Wait, that makes sense because decomposition increases the volume. So when 1 L is 75% of the new volume, the new volume is 1.333 L, which is a 33.3% increase. Because 1 L to 1.333 L is an increase of 0.333 L, which is 33.3% of the original volume.

So now I need to model the decomposition. Let me set up some variables.

Let’s say that the extent of decomposition is x. Wait, how is x defined here? Let's think in terms of the change in moles.

Initially, we have 1 mole of N₂O₄ (assuming 1 liter at STP is 1 mole, but wait, STP is 273 K and 1 atm, so 1 mole occupies 22.4 liters. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, the initial volume is 1 liter. Oh wait, that complicates things because at STP, 1 mole is 22.4 L. So if the initial volume is 1 L, that's less than a mole. Hmm, but maybe I can proceed without considering that, as the problem gives volumes directly.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of moles, but since the problem states volumes, perhaps it's easier to model the reaction using volume changes.

Let me think: the reaction is N₂O₄ → 2 NO₂.

Let’s let the initial volume of N₂O₄ be 1 liter. Let’s say that 'x' is the fraction that decomposes. So, the initial volume is 1 L N₂O₄, and after decomposition, the volume changes.

Wait, but in the reaction, 1 volume of N₂O₄ decomposes into 2 volumes of NO₂. So for every liter of N₂O₄ that decomposes, we get 2 liters of NO₂. So the total volume increases.

Let’s model this. Let’s let x be the fraction of N₂O₄ that has decomposed. So:

Moles of N₂O₄ remaining = (1 - x) * initial moles.

Moles of NO₂ produced = 2x * initial moles.

Wait, but since we're dealing with volumes, perhaps it's easier to model in terms of volumes. Let's consider the initial volume as 1 L of N₂O₄.

After decomposition, the volume of N₂O₄ is (1 - x) liters, and the volume of NO₂ is 2x liters. So the total volume V_total = (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x liters.

Wait, but the problem says that the original volume (1 L) is 25% less than the existing volume. So V_initial = 1 L = V_final - 0.25 V_final → 1 = 0.75 V_final → V_final = 4/3 L ≈ 1.333 L.

So according to my earlier equation, V_total = 1 + x → 1 + x = 4/3 → x = 1/3 ≈ 0.333, which is 33.3% decomposition.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 33% decomposition, which would be 1/3 or 33.3%. So that would suggest the answer is A.

Wait a second, but let me double-check because sometimes I might get confused between moles and volumes.

Wait, another approach: Let's let the initial volume be 1 L N₂O₄. At decomposition, x is the amount decomposed. So moles of N₂O₄ remaining: 1 - x. Moles of NO₂ formed: 2x.

So the total volume is (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x.

The problem states that the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. So original V = 1 L.

Existing V = V_final = (100% / (100% -25%)) * original V → (1 / 0.75) * 1 L = 1.333 L.

So 1 + x = 1.333 → x = 0.333 → 33.3% decomposition.

So that would correspond to option A: 33% decomposition.

But wait, another thought: The problem says the original volume is 25% less than the existing volume. Let me make sure I have this phrasing correct.

So, original volume = existing volume minus 25% of existing volume.

So, 1 L = V_final - 0.25 V_final → 1 = 0.75 V_final → V_final = 1 / 0.75 = 4/3 L.

Yes, that's correct. So V_final is 4/3 L. So the change in volume is 1/3 L, which comes from the decomposition.

So the decomposition leads to an increase in volume by x, where x is the fraction decomposed. So 1 + x = 4/3 → x=1/3 → 33.3% decomposition.

Looking back at the options, option A is 33% decomposition.

Wait, but wait another thing: I assumed that x is the fraction of N₂O₄ decomposed, so each x of N₂O₄ produces 2x of NO₂. Therefore, the total volume after decomposition is 1 + x. So when V_final is 4/3, x=1/3.

Yes, that makes sense. So the decomposition is 33%, which is option A.

But wait, another way to think about it: Let's say initially, the volume is 1 L (all N₂O₄). At equilibrium, the volume is V = 1 + x, where x is the amount decomposed (in liters). So the total volume is 1 + x.

But according to the problem statement, the existing volume is such that the original volume (1 L) is 25% less than the existing. So 1 = 0.75 * V → V = 4/3 L.

So 1 + x = 4/3 → x = 1/3 L. Since the initial volume was 1 L, the fraction decomposed is (1/3)/1 = 1/3, which is 33.3%.

So the answer should be A: 33% decomposition.

Hmm, but wait, let me think about whether I might have made a mistake in the way the decomposition affects the volume.

If 1 mole of N₂O₄ decomposes into 2 moles of NO₂, the number of moles doubles for that fraction. So, the change in moles would be 2x - x = x (since 1 mole becomes 2, so net change is +x). But wait, in terms of volume, since the volume is directly proportional to moles, the same applies.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try using variables more carefully.

Let’s define the initial volume as V_initial = 1 L N₂O₄.

At decomposition, let’s say that a fraction 'x' of N₂O₄ has decomposed. So, the volume of N₂O₄ remaining is (1 - x) L.

The volume of NO₂ produced is 2x L (since each liter of N₂O₄ produces 2 liters of NO₂).

So total volume V_final = (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x liters.

We know that V_initial is 25% less than V_final. So V_initial = V_final - 0.25 V_final → V_initial = 0.75 V_final.

Plugging in the numbers: 1 L = 0.75 * V_final → V_final = 1 / 0.75 = 4/3 L.

So, 1 + x = 4/3 → x = 1/3 → 33.3%.

So yes, that's 33% decomposition, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decomposition reaction:

\[
\text{N}_2\text{O}_4 \rightleftharpoons 2\text{NO}_2
\]

Initially, we have 1 liter of N₂O₄. Let the fraction of N₂O₄ that decomposes be \( x \). After decomposition:

- The volume of N₂O₄ remaining is \( 1 - x \) liters.
- The volume of NO₂ produced is \( 2x \) liters.

The total volume after decomposition is:

\[
V_{\text{final}} = (1 - x) + 2x = 1 + x \, \text{liters}.
\]

The problem states that the original volume (1 liter) is 25% less than the existing volume. This means:

\[
V_{\text{initial}} = V_{\text{final}} - 0.25V_{\text{final}} \implies 1 = 0.75V_{\text{final}}.
\]

Solving for \( V_{\text{final}} \):

\[
V_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{0.75} = \frac{4}{3} \, \text{liters}.
\]

Equating \( V_{\text{final}} = 1 + x \) to \( \frac{4}{3} \):

\[
1 + x = \frac{4}{3} \implies x = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.333.
\]

Thus, 33.3% of the N₂O₄ has decomposed. Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is:

**A: 33% decomposition.**
