Question:

A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The rancher, because the drought conditions give him priority access to the water.
B: The millionaire, as he was using the water first for his estate's needs.
C: The millionaire, because he has a right to the water for irrigation purposes.
D: Neither, because both have equal rights to the water as it runs through both of their properties.
E: The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.
F: The rancher, because the millionaire's use of the water is excessive and unnecessary.
G: The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.
H: The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.
I: The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.
J: The millionaire, because he has been using the water for a longer period of time.

Alright, so I've got this water rights question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me break it down step by step. 

Okay, the setup is about a rancher and a millionaire whose properties are along a stream. The stream starts on the rancher's mountain and flows down to the millionaire's estate. The millionaire has been using the water since 1956 for irrigation on the southern part of his property. The rancher started taking water in 1986 for domestic use. Now, in 1996, there's a drought, and there's not enough water for both. The millionaire is suing to get priority, and the question is about who has the superior right under common law riparian rights.

Wait, so they're not following the prior appropriation doctrine, which is the "first in time, first in right" system. Instead, it's the common law of riparian rights. I remember that under riparian law, the key factors are that the water must be used on the riparian land (land adjacent to the watercourse) and that the use must be reasonable and not harmful to other riparian owners.

So both the millionaire and the rancher are riparian owners since their properties are within the watershed. The stream runs through both properties, so they both have riparian rights.

Now, the millionaire started using water in 1956, and the rancher started in 1986. But under riparian law, priority isn't necessarily based on who was first in time. Instead, it's about the reasonableness of the use. However, in some jurisdictions, there's the concept of "prescription," where long-term use can establish a right. The question mentions a prescription period of 15 years. The millionaire has been using the water continuously since 1956, so that's 40 years, well beyond the 15-year period. So he might have an easement by prescription.

But wait, does that mean he can take all the water? Or just the amount he's been using? Because prescription usually gives the right to the specific use that was done during the period. So the millionaire might have a right to the water he's been using since 1956, but the rancher's use is more recent.

Another point is the type of use. The millionaire is using it for irrigation, and the rancher for domestic. Under common law, domestic use is typically considered more senior than agricultural. So even if the millionaire was first, the rancher's domestic use might take priority. But wait, no, because under riparian rights, each owner can use the water as long as it's reasonable and doesn't unreasonably interfere with others. So it's about balancing the needs.

But wait, the millionaire's use started before the rancher's. So when the rancher started taking water in 1986, the millionaire's use was already established. The rancher's use came later. So in a situation where the water is limited, does the prior use get priority, or is it based on the type of use?

Hmm, I think under common law, the prior user might have a better claim, especially if they've acquired a prescriptive right. Since the millionaire used the water continuously for over 15 years, he might have an easement by prescription. So when the rancher started taking water in 1986, the millionaire's right was already established, giving him seniority.

Wait, but the question is about who has the superior right when the water becomes scarce. If the millionaire has a prescriptive right to the water he's been using, then the rancher's later use can't interfere with that. So in times of drought, the millionaire's prior right would be protected, and the rancher would have to reduce his use.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions under riparian law hold that each owner can use the water as long as it's reasonable and doesn't harm others. But when water is scarce, the courts might look at which use is more essential. However, I think the key here is the prescriptive right because the millionaire used it for so long, exceeding the 15-year period. So he has an established right that the rancher can't interfere with.

So looking at the options:

Option E says the millionaire has a right because he used the water beneficially before the rancher and continuously. Option B says he was first. Option G says he has an easement by prescription.

Wait, the prescriptive easement would require that the use was open, continuous, and without permission for the statutory period (15 years). The millionaire started in 1956, so by 1971, he had his 15 years. Since he continued without interruption, he has a prescriptive right to the water as he's been using it. So in 1986, when the rancher started, the millionaire already had this easement. So the rancher's use can't interfere with that.

Therefore, the millionaire can take the water he's been using, and the rancher has to take what's left. But in the drought, there's only enough for either the millionaire's irrigation or the rancher's domestic plus a quarter of the millionaire's needs. So the millionaire's easement would allow him to take his usual amount, leaving little for the rancher.

Wait, but the question says that the millionaire wants the full flow, but that might be more than he's been using. Or does his prescriptive right entitle him to the full flow? No, I think it's for the amount he's been using. So perhaps he can take the amount he's been using since 1956, and the rancher can take the rest.

But the answer options don't specify that. Let me look again at the options.

Option E: The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.

Option G: The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.

Wait, if he's obtained an easement by prescription, does that mean he can take as much as he needs, or only what he's been using? I think it's the latter. So he can take the amount he's been using, not necessarily the full flow. But the question says the millionaire moves to have the full flow passed to him. So if he doesn't have a right to the full flow, but only to his historical use, then perhaps the court would limit him to that. But the question is about which party's rights are superior.

Alternatively, under riparian law, the millionaire's right is not necessarily to the full flow but to a reasonable use. So the court would have to balance both uses. But given that the millionaire has a prescriptive right, his use would be protected.

Wait, but the rancher is upstream. In some riparian systems, upstream users can affect downstream, but under common law, each riparian owner has the right to have the water flow in its natural condition. So if the rancher is upstream and takes water, it might affect the downstream millionaire. But I think the priority in common law is based on ownership along the watercourse, not necessarily upstream vs downstream. Wait, no, in riparian law, each owner has equal rights, but when water is scarce, the uses are compared.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is that the millionaire has an easement by prescription, giving him the right to the specific amount of water he's been using. Therefore, the rancher can only take what's left after the millionaire's use.

In that case, the millionaire would have a superior right to the water he's been using, making option E or G correct.

Option E says it's because he used it first and continuously. Option G says he got an easement by prescription.

So the argument is that the millionaire's use has ripened into a prescriptive right, so he can take the water regardless of the rancher's later use.

Looking back, the millionaire used the water continuously since 1956, which is more than 15 years, so by prescription he has a right to that water. So when the rancher started in 1986, the millionaire's right was already established, making the rancher's use subordinate.

So in the drought, the millionaire can take his usual amount, leaving insufficient water for the rancher's needs. Thus, the millionaire's rights are superior.

Looking at the options, option E and G are possible. Option G says he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much as he needs. But I think the easement would be for the specific amount he had been using, not unlimited. However, the question says the millionaire moves to have the full flow passed to him, which might not be supported unless his prescriptive right covers that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, because he used it beneficially first and continuously, which under riparian law would give him priority, even without considering prescription.

Wait, but riparian law doesn't prioritize based on who was first in time. It's about the reasonableness of the use. However, when one user has a prescriptive right, that takes precedence.

So I'm leaning towards option G being correct because the millionaire has a prescriptive easement, giving him the right to the water he's been using for over 15 years.

Wait, but the options don't mention the specific amount; option G says he can remove as much as he may need. That might be inaccurate because prescription would only give him the right to what he's been using, not more.

Hmm, perhaps the better answer is E, because he was first to use it beneficially and continuously, which is more aligned with riparian law's approach, even without prescription.

Wait, but the question states that the jurisdiction has a 15-year prescription period, so the millionaire's use since 1956 (over 15 years) would have ripened into a prescriptive right. So option G would be correct because he has the easement by prescription.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Under common law, riparian rights don't depend on priority in time. However, when a user has obtained a prescriptive right, that's an easement that can be enforced even against other riparian owners. So the millionaire's use, being continuous and open for over 15 years, would give him an easement by prescription, which would allow him to take the water regardless of the rancher's later use.

So in this case, the millionaire's right via prescription would take precedence. Therefore, the correct answer is G: The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.

Wait, but does the easement by prescription allow him to take as much as he needs, or only the amount he's been using? Because prescription is based on the use he had during the prescriptive period. So he can take what he's been using, not more. But the question says the millionaire wants the full flow, which might be more than he's been using. So perhaps the court wouldn't grant him the full flow, but only his established amount.

But the question is about whether the millionaire's rights are superior. So even if he can't take the full flow, his right to his usual amount would be superior to the rancher's, leaving the rancher with less.

In that case, the correct answer would be E, because he used it first and continuously, making his use prior and therefore protected.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap:

- Riparian rights: each owner can use water reasonably on their land, in a way that doesn't harm others.

- When water is scarce, the court decides based on reasonableness and sometimes the priority of the use.

- The millionaire used water since 1956, so over 40 years, which is beyond the 15-year prescription period. So he has a prescriptive easement to take the water as he has been (the amount he's been using).

- The rancher started in 1986, so his use is junior to the millionaire's prescriptive right.

Therefore, the millionaire's right is superior because of prescription, allowing him to take his usual amount, leaving less for the rancher.

So the answer should be option E: The millionaire, because he put the water to beneficial use prior and has continuously used it.

Wait, but option G is about prescription. So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps under common law, the prior user has priority, regardless of prescription. But prescription would give the millionaire a right even against other riparian owners, making G correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the millionaire has a prescriptive easement, so his right is superior, making option G correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option G: The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.

But actually, prescription would only give him the specific use he had during the period, not unlimited. So maybe G is incorrect because it says "as much as he may need," implying more than he used before.

In that case, the correct reasoning is that the millionaire's use was prior and continuous, giving him priority under riparian law, even without considering prescription. So option E would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: under common law, when water is scarce, the court looks at which use is more necessary. Domestic use is usually considered more essential than irrigation. So the rancher's domestic use might take priority over the millionaire's irrigation.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier points about prescription. So which takes precedence: the prescriptive right or the type of use?

I think the prescriptive right would take precedence because it's an established legal right, even over the type of use. So the millionaire can enforce his prescriptive right, making his use superior.

But if the court decides based on the necessity of the use, domestic might come first. However, the question states that the jurisdiction follows the common law of riparian rights, not prior appropriation. So under riparian law, the type of use can affect the reasonableness, but a prescriptive right would be a stronger claim.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the correct answer is E or G. Since the millionaire's use has been continuous and beneficial, and he has a prescriptive right, I think G is the better option because it directly addresses the prescriptive easement.

Wait, but the prescriptive easement is for the specific use, so in times of scarcity, he can take that specific amount. The question says the millionaire moves to have the full flow passed to him, which might not be supported unless he's entitled to it. But perhaps the full flow isn't necessary for his use, so the court would only grant him his prescriptive amount.

But the options don't specify that. So perhaps the correct answer is E: because he used it first and continuously, making his right superior.

Alternatively, since the millionaire has a prescriptive right, option G would be correct.

I think I'll go with option E because it's about the prior beneficial use and continuous use, which under riparian law would give him priority. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, considering prescription, option G might be the correct answer. 

Wait, let me think again: under common law riparian rights, the key is that each owner can use the water as long as it's reasonable and doesn't unreasonably interfere with others. The first user doesn't necessarily have priority, but if they've acquired a prescriptive right, that's a different matter. So in this case, the millionaire's use became fixed through prescription, so his right is superior.
</think>

Under common law riparian rights, each landowner adjacent to a watercourse has the right to use water in a reasonable manner, provided it does not unreasonably interfere with other riparian owners. The millionaire began using the water in 1956 for irrigation, while the rancher started using it in 1986 for domestic purposes. The jurisdiction recognizes a prescription period of 15 years, and the millionaire's continuous and open use of the water since 1956 establishes a prescriptive easement. This easement entitles him to the specific amount of water he has historically used, as prescription rights are based on the use during the prescriptive period.

Although domestic use is often considered more essential than agricultural use under riparian law, the millionaire's prescriptive right takes precedence because it is a legally established right. The rancher's later use cannot interfere with the millionaire's prescriptive easement. Therefore, the millionaire's rights to the water are superior, as his use has been continuous, beneficial, and protected by prescription.

The correct answer is **E: The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.**

Answer: E
