Okay, so I have this question about ammonia absorption in a column, and I need to find the transfer rate per unit area. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is a column absorbing ammonia from a feed of air and ammonia. The conditions are 1 atm and 0°C. The resistance is entirely in the gas phase, specifically in a gas film that's 1.5 mm thick. The partial pressure of NH3 at a point is 55 mm Hg. The diffusivity given is 0.198 cm²/sec at 0°C.

Wait, I remember that when resistance is in the gas phase, we can model this using Fick's Law of diffusion. Oh right, Fick's Law for mass transfer rate. The formula I think is N = (D * A * (p1 - p2)) / (thickness * R * T), but wait, maybe I should double-check the exact formula.

Wait, no. Fick's Law in mass transfer is often written as N = (D / δ) * (C1 - C2), where δ is the film thickness. But since the gas is involved, perhaps we should use partial pressures and the ideal gas law to relate concentration to partial pressure.

So, the concentration C is (P)/(R*T), right? Because PV = nRT, so n/V = P/(RT). So concentration is proportional to partial pressure.

So, the molar flux N (moles per area per time) would be D * (C1 - C2) / δ. But since C is P/(RT), then N = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (δ * R * T).

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The general form when using partial pressures is N = (D / δ) * (y1 - y2) * (P / (R T)), where y is the mole fraction. But in this case, maybe it's just a binary system, so maybe the equation simplifies.

Alternatively, I've heard of the formula N = (D * (P_NH3 - P_i)) / (δ * R * T), where P_i is the interface partial pressure. But wait, in this problem, the resistance is entirely in the gas phase, so maybe we're assuming the gas film is the controlling factor, and the liquid phase doesn't contribute. So the concentration gradient is across the gas film, from the bulk gas (partial pressure P) to the interface (which I guess is in equilibrium with the liquid).

Wait, but the problem states that the partial pressure of NH3 is 55 mm Hg at one point. Hmm, maybe that's the partial pressure in the bulk gas, and the interface is where NH3 is being absorbed into water, so the partial pressure at the interface would be zero (if it's completely absorbed). Or wait, no, because in reality, NH3 will have some solubility, so the interface would have a partial pressure p_i. But since the problem says resistance is completely in the gas phase, perhaps the liquid phase is perfectly mixed and the interface has a negligible resistance. So maybe the concentration gradient is from the bulk gas (55 mm Hg) to the interface, which is at a much lower partial pressure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the transfer rate per unit area is the molar flux, which is given by N = (D / δ) * (ΔC), where ΔC is the concentration difference across the film.

But since the gas is ideal, ΔC would be (P / (R T)) for each partial pressure. So the difference in partial pressures is P - p_i, but since the problem states that the resistance is entirely in the gas phase, perhaps the liquid is such that the partial pressure at the interface is zero. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, because in gas absorption, the NH3 dissolves into the liquid, so the partial pressure at the interface would be the vapor pressure of the solution. But if the solution is very dilute, perhaps that's negligible. But I don't think we can assume that. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the resistance is completely in the gas phase, which I think implies that the liquid-phase resistance is negligible. So the rate is determined by the gas-phase film. So maybe the partial pressure at the interface is zero. But that doesn't sound right because, in reality, the interface would have some finite partial pressure based on Henry's law.

Wait, perhaps I should model it correctly. Let me think: the flux N is given by (D / δ) * (y1 - y2) * (P / (R T)), where y is the mole fraction.

Alternatively, since the total pressure is 1 atm, and the partial pressure of NH3 is 55 mm Hg, perhaps the concentration in the bulk is C1 = (55 mm Hg) / (R T), and at the interface, it's C2 = (p_i) / (R T). But without knowing p_i, maybe it's assumed that the liquid is such that p_i is zero. Or perhaps the question is giving the partial pressure in the bulk, and the interface is in equilibrium, so the driving force is the difference between the bulk and interface partial pressures.

Wait, but the problem says that the resistance is in the gas phase. So perhaps the rate is determined solely by the diffusion through the gas film. So maybe the flux N is (D / δ) * (C_bulk - C_interface), and since C is P/(R T), and if C_interface is zero, then C = P/(R T). But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is giving the partial pressure in the bulk as 55 mm Hg, and the partial pressure at the interface is zero, assuming that the NH3 is quickly absorbed into the liquid. So the concentration difference would be 55 mm Hg.

Alternatively, maybe the interface is at equilibrium, so the partial pressure there is zero because the solution is such that NH3 is completely absorbed. Hmm, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute N as (D * (P - p_i)) / (δ * R T). But I don't know p_i, but the problem gives P as 55 mm Hg. So maybe p_i is negligible, or perhaps the question is assuming that the concentration gradient is across the entire film, with P being the bulk and p_i being zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the partial pressure difference as the driving force, so the flux is (D / δ) * (P / (R T)).

Wait, maybe I should proceed with the calculation.

Given:

D = 0.198 cm²/s.

δ = 1.5 mm = 0.15 cm.

Partial pressure P = 55 mm Hg.

R is the gas constant, which is 82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K) when using cm units.

Temperature T is 0°C = 273.15 K.

So, I think the formula is N = (D / δ) * (P / (R T)).

Wait, let me make sure. Because Fick's Law in mass transfer for gases is N = (D / δ) * (y1 - y2) * (P_total / (R T)).

But if the total pressure is 1 atm, then y = P_i / P_total, so (y1 - y2) * P_total = (P1 - P2).

So, N = (D * (P1 - P2)) / (δ * R T).

In this problem, if we're assuming that the partial pressure at the interface is zero (because the liquid is absorbing all the NH3), then P2 = 0. Thus, N = (D * P1) / (δ * R T).

So let's plug in the numbers.

D = 0.198 cm²/s.

δ = 0.15 cm (because 1.5 mm is 0.15 cm).

P1 = 55 mm Hg.

R = 82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K).

T = 273.15 K.

But wait, the units of pressure need to be consistent. Since R is in cm³·atm/(mol·K), I should convert P from mm Hg to atm.

We know that 1 atm = 760 mm Hg. So 55 mm Hg is 55/760 atm.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute P1 in atm: 55 / 760 = approx 0.072368 atm.

Compute R*T: 82.057 * 273.15 ≈ let's calculate that.

82.057 * 273.15:

Well, 80 * 273 = 21,840. 2.057 * 273 ≈ 561. So total around 21,840 + 561 = 22,401 cm³·atm/(mol).

Wait, 82.057 * 273.15:

Let me compute it more accurately.

273.15 * 82.057:

= (270 * 82.057) + (3.15 * 82.057)

270 * 82.057 = Let's compute 82.057 * 200 = 16,411.4; 82.057 * 70 = 5,744. So 16,411.4 + 5,744 = 22,155.4.

3.15 * 82.057 ≈ 258.68.

So total ≈ 22,155.4 + 258.68 ≈ 22,414.08 cm³·atm/mol.

So R*T ≈ 22,414.08 cm³·atm/mol.

Now, N = (0.198 cm²/s) * (0.072368 atm) / (0.15 cm * 22,414.08 cm³·atm/mol)

Wait, let's compute the denominator first: 0.15 cm * 22,414.08 cm³·atm/mol.

0.15 * 22,414.08 = approximately 3,362.12 cm^4·atm/(mol·s)?

Wait, no.

Wait, the denominator is δ * R T = 0.15 cm * 22,414.08 cm³·atm/(mol·K) * K → but T is in K, but R has K in denominator, so it's (cm * cm³·atm/mol) = cm^4·atm/mol.

Wait, let me think about units to make sure.

D is cm²/s.

P is atm.

δ is cm.

R is cm³·atm/(mol·K).

T is K.

So N has units of (cm²/s) * (atm) / (cm * (cm³·atm/(mol·K)) * K) )

Let me compute the denominator units:

cm * (cm³·atm/mol) → (cm^4·atm)/mol.

So the overall units would be (cm²/s) * atm / (cm^4·atm/mol) = (cm² * atm) / (s * cm^4 * atm/mol) ) → (1) / (s * cm² / mol) ) → mol/(s·cm²), which is correct for molar flux.

So the calculation is:

N = (D * P) / (δ * R T)

Plugging in the numbers:

(0.198 cm²/s) * 0.072368 atm / (0.15 cm * 22,414.08 cm³·atm/mol)

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 0.198 * 0.072368 ≈ 0.01432 cm²·atm/s.

Denominator: 0.15 * 22,414.08 ≈ 3,362.12 cm^4·atm/mol.

So N ≈ 0.01432 / 3,362.12 ≈ 4.26e-6 mol/(cm²·s).

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.198 * 0.072368 = ?

0.198 * 0.07 = 0.01386.

0.198 * 0.002368 = approx 0.000469.

So total ≈ 0.01386 + 0.000469 = 0.014329 cm²·atm/s.

Denominator: 0.15 * 22,414.08 = 3,362.12 cm^4·atm/mol.

So N = 0.014329 / 3,362.12 ≈ 4.26e-6 mol/(cm²·s).

Looking at the options, option A is 5.4e-6, option B is 7.1e-6, option C is 2.8e-6, D is 6.2e-6, E is 1.6e-6, F is 3.9e-6, G is 8.5e-6, H is 3.5e-6, I is 4.4e-6, J is 5e-6.

Hmm, 4.26e-6 is closest to option I (4.4e-6) but maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units for R. Let me confirm R.

R is 82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K). Yes, that's correct.

Wait, and T is 273.15 K.

So R*T is 82.057 * 273.15 ≈ 22,414 cm³·atm/mol.

Yes, correct.

D is 0.198 cm²/s.

P is 55 mm Hg = 55/760 atm = 0.072368 atm.

So N = (0.198 * 0.072368) / (0.15 * 22,414).

Compute numerator: 0.198 * 0.072368.

Let me compute 0.198 * 0.072368 exactly.

0.198 * 0.07 = 0.01386.

0.198 * 0.002368 = let's compute:

0.198 * 0.002 = 0.000396.

0.198 * 0.000368 = approx 0.0000728.

So total 0.000396 + 0.0000728 = 0.0004688.

So numerator is 0.01386 + 0.0004688 = 0.0143288 cm²·atm/s.

Denominator: 0.15 * 22,414.08 = 3,362.12 cm^4·atm/mol.

So N = 0.0143288 / 3,362.12 ≈ 4.26e-6 mol/cm²·s.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match 4.26e-6. Let me see the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A:5.4e-6

B:7.1e-6

C:2.8e-6

D:6.2e-6

E:1.6e-6

F:3.9e-6

G:8.5e-6

H:3.5e-6

I:4.4e-6

J:5.0e-6

Hmm, 4.26e-6 is close to I (4.4e-6), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the film thickness more accurately. δ is 1.5 mm, which is 0.15 cm. Correct.

Wait another thing: What if the formula should have (P - p_i), and p_i is not zero? Because in reality, the interface would have some partial pressure based on the Henry's law. But the problem states that the resistance is entirely in the gas phase, so maybe the liquid phase's resistance is negligible, which would imply that the concentration in the liquid is zero, but that doesn't directly translate to p_i being zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the entire partial pressure as the driving force, so P = 55 mm Hg, and p_i is zero.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula is N = (D * (P - p_i)) / (δ * R T), but since the resistance is only in the gas phase, the liquid offers no resistance, so p_i would be zero. Thus, N = D * P / (δ R T).

Wait, but then my initial calculation is correct, leading to approximately 4.26e-6, which is close to option I (4.4e-6). However, maybe I should check if I made any errors in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula with the correct units.

Wait, another possible mistake: Did I mix up cm and meters? No, all units are in cm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute R*T more accurately.

Compute R*T: 82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K) * 273.15 K.

Exactly:

82.057 * 273.15 = ?

Let me compute 82 * 273 = 22,386.

0.057 * 273 ≈ 15.561.

0.057 * 0.15 = 0.00855.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 82.057 * 273.15.

Compute 82 * 273.15: 82 * 273 = 22,386; 82 * 0.15 = 12.3 → total 22,398.3.

Then 0.057 * 273.15 = 15.58.

So total R*T ≈ 22,398.3 + 15.58 ≈ 22,413.88 cm³·atm/mol.

So denominator is 0.15 cm * 22,413.88 cm³·atm/mol = 3,362.082 cm^4·atm/mol.

Numerator is 0.198 * 0.072368 = 0.01432864 cm²·atm/s.

So N = 0.01432864 / 3,362.082 ≈ 4.26e-6 mol/(cm²·s).

Hmm, that's still 4.26e-6.

Looking at the options, the closest is I (4.4e-6). But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator.

Denominator: δ * R T = 0.15 cm * 82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K) * 273.15 K.

Wait, no, because R is in cm³·atm/(mol·K), and T is in K, so R*T is cm³·atm/mol.

δ is in cm, so δ * (R*T) is cm * cm³·atm/mol = cm^4·atm/mol.

So denominator is 0.15 * 82.057 * 273.
