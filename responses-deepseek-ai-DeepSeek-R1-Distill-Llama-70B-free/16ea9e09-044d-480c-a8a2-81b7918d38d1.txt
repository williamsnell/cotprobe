Question:

Mutation of homeotic cluster genes often results in which of the following developmental defects in Drosophila?

Options:

A: Complete absence of segmentation
B: Hindrance in the development of the nervous system
C: Inability to undergo metamorphosis
D: Absence of a group of contiguous segments
E: Tumor formation in imaginal discs
F: Formation of extra segments
G: Polarity defects in every segment along the anterior-posterior axis
H: Transformation of one segment into another
I: Transformation of the posterior segment into the anterior
J: Inability to form imaginal discs

Okay, so I've got this question about Drosophila genetics and homeotic cluster genes. Hmm, I remember that homeotic genes are involved in the development of body segments. Oh wait, the homeotic cluster is part of the Hox genes, right? They determine the identity of each segment along the body axis.

The question is asking what happens when these genes mutate. My notes say that homeotic mutations cause segments to transform into others. Like, maybe a leg growing where an antenna should be, but that's more like in the Ultrabithorax or Antennapedia examples. So, a mutation in the homeotic cluster would make a segment look like another segment.

Looking at the options, option H says transformation of one segment into another. That sounds right. But wait, are there other possibilities? Let me think.

Option D is absence of contiguous segments. That doesn't sound like homeotic. Maybe that's more like a gap gene issue? Like if a gap gene is mutated, you lose a group of segments because the gene isn't active in that region. So D could be a gap gene mutation effect, not homeotic.

Option F is extra segments. That might be more a problem with pair-rule genes or segment polarity genes. Pair-rule genes determine where each segment will form, so mutations there could cause extra or fewer segments. Or maybe if something like the Wingless signaling is off, but I'm not sure.

Option G is polarity defects in every segment. That sounds like the segment polarity genes, like engrailed or hedgehog. They affect the anterior-posterior polarity within each segment. So if those mutate, each segment might have issues with polarity.

Option I says transformation of the posterior into the anterior. That sounds specific, maybe like a mutation in a caudal gene or something that determines the posterior identity. Or perhaps the terminal gene group.

Option H seems more general, which fits the homeotic cluster. Because each Hox gene determines what each segment becomes. So if a Hox gene is mutated, that segment will take on the identity of another. For example, in the Ultrabithorax mutation, the third thoracic segment becomes more like the second, so you get an extra wing.

So the correct answer should be H: Transformation of one segment into another.

Homeotic cluster genes, part of the Hox genes, are responsible for determining the identity of body segments in Drosophila. When these genes mutate, segments can transform into the identity of other segments. For example, a mutation in the Ultrabithorax gene can cause the third thoracic segment to develop like the second, resulting in an extra wing. This transformation is characteristic of homeotic mutations.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J**: These options describe effects unrelated to homeotic cluster gene mutations. For instance, absence of segmentation (A) or extra segments (F) are more associated with gap or pair-rule genes, while polarity defects (G) relate to segment polarity genes.
- **D**: Absence of contiguous segments is typically linked to gap gene mutations, not homeotic cluster genes.
- **H**: Transformation of one segment into another is the hallmark of homeotic cluster gene mutations, as these genes dictate segment identity.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: Transformation of one segment into another**.

Answer: H
