Question:

An elderly woman underwent major surgery and spent two weeks in the hospital. The woman continued to take powerful pain medication for several weeks after she returned home. During her recovery, she offered to sell her car for $450 to her neighbor, who owned a house-cleaning service. The neighbor said, "That's great! I need a car to transport all the people who work for me to their job sites." In fact, the woman's car was worth $3,000, and the neighbor knew this. He was also aware that the woman had undergone surgery and noted that she seemed "out of it" because of the medication she was taking. Several days later, the woman's son found out about the deal and contacted the neighbor, telling him that the woman would sell him the car, but for $3,450. The next day, when the neighbor tendered $450 and demanded that the woman give him the car, she refused. If the neighbor sues the woman for breach of contract, will he be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.
B: No, because the woman was under the influence of medication at the time of the agreement.
C: Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.
D: Yes, because the son has no authority to change the terms of the agreement.
E: Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.
F: Yes, because the woman had the mental capacity to make a decision.
G: No, because the woman put nothing in writing.
H: No, because the neighbor took advantage of the woman's condition.
I: No, because there was no legal documentation of the agreement.
J: Yes, because the neighbor had already agreed to the initial price.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's an elderly woman who just had major surgery and was on powerful pain meds for several weeks after returning home. She offers to sell her car to her neighbor for $450. The neighbor runs a house-cleaning service and says he needs the car to transport his workers. But the car is actually worth $3,000, and the neighbor knows that. He also noticed she seemed "out of it" because of the medication.

A few days later, the woman's son finds out about the deal and tells the neighbor she'll sell it for $3,450 instead. The next day, the neighbor offers $450 and demands the car, but she refuses. Now, the neighbor is suing for breach of contract.

The question is, will the neighbor win?

Hmm. So, the key issues here are about the validity of the contract. I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be mutual assent, consideration, capacity, etc.

The woman was on pain medication, which might affect her capacity. Capacity is a big deal. If someone doesn't have the mental capacity to understand the terms, the contract can be voidable. So, if she was incapacitated, the contract could be voidable at her option.

She was offering the car for way below its valueâ€”$450 vs. $3,000. That's a huge difference. The neighbor knew the car's value and that she was medicated and seemed out of it. So, he might have taken advantage of her vulnerable state.

Under contract law, if someone takes unfair advantage of another's incapacity, the contract can be voidable. This is about undue influence or exploitation. So, even if she technically agreed, if she wasn't in a state to make an informed decision, the contract isn't valid.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because the contract was voidable due to apparent incapacity. That seems possible because she was on meds and the neighbor noticed she was out of it.

B: No, because she was under medication. This is similar to A, but maybe more about intoxication. But I think the capacity issue is broader than just being under influence.

C: Yes, because reliance makes it enforceable. I don't think reliance alone is enough if there's incapacity. Pre-existing doctrine like promissory estoppel might require more, but the main issue is capacity.

D: Yes, because the son can't change terms. But the son's action might not matter if the original contract was voidable. So maybe D isn't the main issue.

E: Yes, because offer and acceptance. But if capacity is lacking, it doesn't matter.

F: Yes, because she had capacity. But I think she didn't, given the meds.

G: No, because no writing. But the question doesn't mention the Statute of Frauds. The car is a goods over $500, so normally, the sale of goods for $500 or more requires a writing. But this is a private sale, maybe. Hmm, but the offer was $450, which is under $500. So the Statute of Frauds might not apply. So G might not be the right reason.

H: No, because neighbor took advantage. This sounds like undue influence or exploitation, which ties into capacity and unfair advantage.

I: No, because no legal documentation. Similar to G, but again, maybe not applicable because of the amount.

J: Yes, because neighbor agreed to the initial price. But if the contract was voidable, the woman can back out regardless.

So, between A, B, H, and maybe G or I.

But the main issue is capacity. The woman's mental state due to medication affected her capacity. The neighbor knew she was "out of it" and still took advantage, offering a much lower price. So, the contract is voidable because of her incapacity, and the neighbor's knowledge of it.

So, the answer would be either A or H.

Looking at the options:

A says the contract is voidable due to apparent incapacity.

H says no because neighbor took advantage.

Wait, in contract law, if someone takes advantage of another's incapacity, that makes the contract voidable. So H is about the neighbor taking advantage, which is a form of undue influence or exploitation. So both A and H could be correct reasons.

But the question is about whether the contract is enforceable. The woman can avoid the contract because she lacked capacity, which was apparent, and the neighbor knew.

So, I think A is the correct answer. Alternatively, H also points to the same result, but the reasoning is different.

Wait, the options are:

A: Contract voidable due to apparent incapacity.

H: No because neighbor took advantage.

In this scenario, both points are valid. But the primary doctrine here is capacity. So answer A is correct.

Option B says because she was under medication. That's a bit more specific, but the broader concept is capacity.

So the answer should be A or H. But which one?

I think the correct answer is H, because the neighbor knew she was incapacitated and took unfair advantage. So, even if she had capacity, the unfairness would make it unenforceable.

Wait, but the question is about whether the contract is void or voidable. So, if the woman was incapacitated, she can void the contract. So the contract is voidable, making A correct. Alternatively, the neighbor's exploitation makes it unenforceable as well.

But I think the main issue is her capacity. So, the correct answer is A.

Wait, but looking again, H says no because the neighbor took advantage. So that refers to undue influence. So, the question is whether the contract can be avoided on grounds of either incapacity or undue influence.

In this case, the woman's condition made her vulnerable, and the neighbor took advantage. So H could be the reason.

But I'm a bit confused between A and H.

Alternatively, perhaps both A and H are correct, but the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, let me think about what makes a contract voidable. Incapacity, undue influence, duress, misrepresentation. So, if the woman lacked capacity, the contract is voidable. Additionally, the neighbor's taking advantage (undue influence) would also make it voidable.

So, the woman can avoid the contract on either ground.

Now, looking at the options, which one is correct.

The question is whether the neighbor will prevail. So, if the contract is voidable, the woman can choose to avoid it. Therefore, the neighbor won't prevail.

So, option A says no because the contract is voidable due to apparent incapacity. That's correct.

Option H says no because the neighbor took advantage, which is also correct in terms of undue influence.

So, which is the better answer?

In the context of the facts, the woman's condition (medication) made her lack capacity, which was apparent to the neighbor. So, the contract is voidable because of her incapacity. So, A is the correct answer.

Alternatively, H could be correct if the court focuses on the unfairness and exploitation. But I think the primary reason is her capacity.

So, I think the answer is A.

The question revolves around the enforceability of a contract between an elderly woman and her neighbor. The woman, recovering from surgery and on powerful pain medication, offered to sell her car for $450, far below its $3,000 value. The neighbor, aware of her condition and the car's true value, accepted the offer. When the woman later refused to honor the deal, the neighbor sued for breach of contract.

For a contract to be enforceable, it must meet certain criteria, including mutual assent, consideration, and capacity. In this case, the woman's capacity is in question due to her medication, which likely impaired her ability to make informed decisions. The neighbor's awareness of her condition and his decision to take advantage of it further complicates the issue, raising concerns about undue influence or exploitation.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: The contract is voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity. This is a strong argument because her medication likely affected her mental capacity, and the neighbor was aware of her state.
- **B**: The woman's condition due to medication is a subset of the broader issue of capacity but is less precise than option A.
- **C**: Reliance alone does not make a voidable contract enforceable, especially when capacity is lacking.
- **D**: The son's actions are irrelevant if the original contract was voidable due to incapacity.
- **E**: Offer and acceptance are insufficient if capacity is lacking.
- **F**: The woman likely did not have the capacity to make an informed decision.
- **G**: The Statute of Frauds may not apply here because the car was offered for $450, below the $500 threshold.
- **H**: The neighbor took advantage of the woman's condition, which could also make the contract unenforceable due to undue influence.
- **I**: Lack of legal documentation is not the primary issue here.
- **J**: The neighbor's agreement to the initial price does not override the woman's ability to void the contract due to incapacity.

The key issue is the woman's capacity, as her medication likely impaired her ability to understand the agreement. The neighbor's awareness of her condition and his decision to take advantage of it further support the argument that the contract is voidable. While both A and H are valid reasons, the primary legal doctrine at play is the woman's apparent incapacity, making **A** the most accurate answer.

Answer: A
