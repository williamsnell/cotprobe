Okay, so I've got this problem here about Circle Electronics and their calculator production. I'm a bit new to this kind of thing, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that Circle Electronics can produce and sell x number of calculators each month. The cost to produce x calculators is x squared dollars. So if they make, say, 10 calculators, it costs them 100 dollars. Each calculator is sold at $100 wholesale. The goal is to find out how many calculators they should produce monthly to maximize their profit.

Hmm. I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So I need to find expressions for both revenue and cost, then subtract to get profit. Then I can find the maximum profit by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

First, let's break down the variables. Let x be the number of calculators produced and sold each month.

The total revenue (R) is the number of calculators sold multiplied by the selling price per calculator. Since each is sold at $100, R = x * 100. So R = 100x.

The total cost (C) is given as x squared dollars. So C = x².

Profit (P) is revenue minus cost. So P = R - C = 100x - x².

Now, to find the maximum profit, I think I need to find the maximum point of the profit function. Since this is a quadratic equation, it should open downward because the x² term is negative. The maximum of a quadratic function ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). 

In this case, the profit function is P = -x² +100x. So a = -1 and b = 100.

Plugging into the formula: x = -b/(2a) = -100/(2*(-1)) = -100 / (-2) = 50.

So x is 50. So producing 50 calculators a month would maximize the profit.

Looking at the options, option H is 50. So the answer should be H.

To determine how many calculators Circle Electronics should produce monthly to maximize profit, we start by defining the profit function. Let \( x \) represent the number of calculators produced and sold each month. 

The total revenue (\( R \)) is calculated as the number of calculators sold multiplied by the wholesale price per calculator:  
\[
R = 100x
\]

The total cost (\( C \)) to produce \( x \) calculators is given as \( x^2 \):  
\[
C = x^2
\]

The profit (\( P \)) is the difference between total revenue and total cost:  
\[
P = R - C = 100x - x^2
\]

This is a quadratic function of the form \( P = -x^2 + 100x \), which opens downward. The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is located at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 100 \), so:  
\[
x = -\frac{100}{2(-1)} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
\]

Thus, producing 50 calculators per month maximizes the profit. Among the given options, the correct answer is **H: 50**.
