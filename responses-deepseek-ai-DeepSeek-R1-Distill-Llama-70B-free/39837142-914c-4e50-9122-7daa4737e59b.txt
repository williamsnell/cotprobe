Question:

Consider that in horses a single pair of genes controls gait. Some horses can only exhibit a trotting gait, while others exhibit only a pacing gait. In an attempt to determine the pattern of inheritance displayed by this trait, a horse breeder crossed a stallion (\male) that came from a long line of pacers to several mares (\venus) that were trotters. All of the foals were trotters. Which gait is under the control of the dominant gene? Using the letters T and t to represent the dominant and recessive genes, respectively, identify the genotypes of the stallion, the mares and the foals.

Options:

A: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
B: Pacing gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
C: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
D: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
E: Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is TT.
F: Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
G: Trotting gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is tt.
H: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is Tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
I: Pacing gait is controlled by the recessive gene, t. The genotype of the stallion is Tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.
J: Pacing gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is TT, that of the mares is tt, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt.

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem about horses and their gaits. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question says that a single pair of genes controls the gaitâ€”either trotting or pacing. So, it's a simple Mendelian trait, I think. 

The setup is that a stallion from a long line of pacers was crossed with several mares that were trotters. All the foals ended up being trotters. I need to determine which gait is dominant and figure out the genotypes of the stallion, mares, and foals.

Wait, okay. So let's break it down. Let's assume that one allele is dominant (T) and the other recessive (t). But I don't know which trait each corresponds to yet.

The stallion is a pacer, and his line is all pacers. That suggests that the trait is either dominant or recessive, but since they're all pacers, maybe it's a homozygous condition. The mares are all trotters, so perhaps they're the opposite genotype.

When they mate, all the foals are trotters. So the stallion must be contributing a gene that, when combined with the mares' genes, results in the foals having the same trait as the mares.

Let me think about possible crosses. Let's say the stallion is TT or Tt, and the mares are tt or TT. Wait, but the foals are all trotters. So if the mares are tt, and the stallion is TT, then all foals would be Tt, which would be whichever trait is dominant. Alternatively, if the mares are TT and the stallion is tt, then all foals would be Tt as well.

Wait, but in this case, the foals are all trotters. So the mares are trotters, and the foals are also trotters. So let's think about if the mares are homozygous recessive (tt) and the stallion is homozygous dominant (TT). Then, the foals would all be Tt. If T is dominant, then Tt would express the dominant trait, which would be pacing if T is pacing. But in this case, the foals are trotters, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if T is for trotting, then Tt would be trotters. Wait, but the stallion in that case is TT (homozygous dominant), and mares are tt (recessive). So foals would be Tt, and if T is dominant and for trotting, then the foals are trotters. That makes sense.

Wait, but the stallion is a pacer. So that would mean that TT is pacing? No, because if T is dominant, TT would show the dominant trait. But in this scenario, if the stallion is TT and a pacer, then T would be the pacing gene. Wait, but the mares are tt, which would make them express the recessive trait. So, if T is pacing (dominant), then tt would be the recessive, which is trotting. So when the TT stallion (pacer) is crossed with tt mares (trotters), the foals would be Tt, which would express the dominant trait, which is pacing. But the problem says all the foals are trotters. So that can't be right.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me try another angle. Suppose the pacing is the recessive trait. So only when an individual is tt do they pace. If the mares are TT (trotters, dominant), and the stallion is tt (pacer, recessive). Then, the foals would get T from the mares and t from the stallion, so Tt. Since T is dominant, the foals would be TT? Wait, no, because mares are TT (so only give T) and stallion is tt (so only gives t), so all foals would be Tt. If T is dominant and represents trotting, then Tt would be trotters, which matches the problem statement.

Wait, but in this case, the stallion is tt (homozygous recessive), so he is a pacer. The mares are TT (homozygous dominant), so they're trotters. Their foals would all be Tt (heterozygous), which express the dominant trait, which is trotting. That fits because the foals are all trotters.

So, in this scenario, the dominant gene T controls trotting, and the recessive t controls pacing. The stallion's genotype is tt (pacer), the mares are TT (trotters), and the foals are Tt (trotters because T is dominant).

Wait, but let me check the options to see which one matches this. Looking at the options:

Option F says: Trotting is dominant (T). Stallion is tt, mares TT, foals Tt. That's exactly what I just concluded. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another possibility: if the pacing were dominant, what would happen.

If T is pacing (dominant), then the stallion, being a pacer, could be TT or Tt. The mares are tt (trotters). Foals would get T from stallion and t from mares, so Tt, which would be pacers. But the problem says foals are all trotters. So that can't be the case. So pacing can't be dominant because the foals would have the dominant trait and be pacers, which contradicts the outcome.

So yes, the correct scenario is that T is for trotting, dominant. Stallion is tt (pacer), mares are TT (trotters), and foals are Tt (trotters because T is dominant).

Looking back at the options, option F says exactly that. So the correct answer is F.

To determine the pattern of inheritance for the gait in horses, we analyze the given information:

1. **Key Observations**:  
   - A stallion from a long line of pacers (pacing gait) was crossed with mares that were trotters (trotting gait).  
   - All the resulting foals exhibited the trotting gait.  

2. **Genetic Analysis**:  
   - Since the foals all exhibit the trotting gait, this suggests that the mares are contributing a dominant allele (T) for trotting, while the stallion is contributing a recessive allele (t) for pacing.  
   - If the stallion were homozygous dominant (TT) or heterozygous (Tt), the foals would likely exhibit the pacing gait if pacing were dominant, which contradicts the observation.  
   - Therefore, the stallion must be homozygous recessive (tt) for pacing, and the mares must be homozygous dominant (TT) for trotting.  
   - The foals inherit one dominant allele (T) from the mares and one recessive allele (t) from the stallion, resulting in a heterozygous genotype (Tt). Since trotting is dominant, all foals exhibit the trotting gait.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   - Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene (T).  
   - The genotype of the stallion is **tt** (pacer), the genotype of the mares is **TT** (trotters), and the genotype of the foals is **Tt** (trotters).  

4. **Correct Option**:  
   - Option **F** matches this analysis: "Trotting gait is controlled by the dominant gene, T. The genotype of the stallion is tt, that of the mares is TT, and the genotypes of the foals is Tt."
