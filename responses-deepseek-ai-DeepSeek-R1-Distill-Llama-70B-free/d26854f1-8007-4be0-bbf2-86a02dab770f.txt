Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I have to find 1/6 plus 1/8. Hmm, I remember that when adding fractions, you need a common denominator. Let me think about how to do that.

First, I need to find the least common denominator (LCD) for 6 and 8. The denominators are 6 and 8. What's the smallest number that both 6 and 8 can divide into without a remainder? Let me list the multiples. 

Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc.
Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, etc.
Oh, I see, 24 is the first common multiple they share. So the LCD is 24.

Now, I need to convert both fractions to have this denominator. 

Starting with 1/6: To get from 6 to 24 in the denominator, I multiply by 4. So I have to multiply the numerator by 4 as well. 1 times 4 is 4, so 1/6 becomes 4/24.

Next, 1/8: To get from 8 to 24, I multiply by 3. So the numerator 1 times 3 is 3, making the fraction 3/24.

Now, I can add them together. 4/24 + 3/24. Since the denominators are the same, I just add the numerators. 4 + 3 is 7, so the sum is 7/24.

Let me double-check my work. 1/6 is approximately 0.1667, and 1/8 is 0.125. Adding them together gives roughly 0.2917. Now, 7 divided by 24 is about 0.2917, which matches. So that seems right.

Looking at the answer options: 

Option E is 7/24, which matches what I got. So the correct answer should be E.

To solve \( \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{8} \), we first find a common denominator. The least common denominator of 6 and 8 is 24. Converting each fraction:

\[
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{24}, \quad \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{24}.
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
\frac{4}{24} + \frac{3}{24} = \frac{7}{24}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.
