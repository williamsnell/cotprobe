Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about auction rules. Let me start by recalling what I know about auctions and the terminology involved.

The question is about Fernandez attending an auction of Cross & Black's assets. The specific point is about the rules that apply during the auction. The options are A through G, each stating a different rule.

I remember that in auctions, there are two main types: with reserve and without reserve. 

In an auction with reserve, the seller (or auctioneer) has the right to withdraw the item if the bidding doesn't meet a certain minimum price (the reserve). So if the highest bid is below the reserve, the auctioneer can pull the item back. 

On the other hand, an auction without reserve means the item will be sold to the highest bidder regardless of the price. In such cases, I think once the auction starts, the auctioneer can't withdraw the item because it's committed to selling.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: A bidder can retract his bid even after the fall of the hammer. I don't think that's right. Once the hammer falls, the sale is usually final. So a bidder can't retract after that.

Option B: If the auction is with reserve, the auctioneer cannot withdraw the article at any time. Wait, no. In a reserve auction, the auctioneer can withdraw the item if the bids aren't high enough. So B is incorrect because it says the auctioneer cannot withdraw, which contradicts what I know.

Option C: The retraction of a bid by a bidder automatically ends the auction. That doesn't make sense. If one bidder retracts, the auction would continue with others. So C is wrong.

Option D: A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer. I think this is correct. Bidders can usually withdraw their bids before the hammer falls, but not after. So D seems right.

Option E: The auctioneer can increase the bidding price at any time during the auction. No, the auctioneer facilitates the bidding but doesn't set or increase the price. It's the bidders who do that. So E is incorrect.

Option F: If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer. Wait, no. Without reserve means they can't withdraw once bidding starts. So F is wrong.

Option G: All bids are final and cannot be retracted under any circumstances. No, because as I thought earlier, retraction is allowed before the hammer falls. So G is incorrect.

So putting it together, the correct rule is D: A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer.

The correct answer is based on understanding auction rules, particularly the ability of bidders to retract their bids before the hammer falls. In auctions, bidders generally have the right to withdraw their bids at any time until the sale is finalized with the hammer strike. This makes option D the correct choice.

Answer: D
