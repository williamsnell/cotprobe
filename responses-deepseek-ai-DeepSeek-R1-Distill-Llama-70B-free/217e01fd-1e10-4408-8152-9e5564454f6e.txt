Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat: if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not? During the course of the last long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, "Logan is the friend of the white man." I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked; murdered all the relations of Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.

Okay, so I have this question about a speech attributed to Logan, an Indian leader from 1774. I need to figure out his perspective based on the passage provided. Let me read the passage again carefully.

Alright, the passage starts with Logan appealing to white men, asking if they ever came hungry and he didn't feed them, or cold and he didn't clothe them. That makes me think he's highlighting his kindness and friendship towards the whites. He says he remained idle in his cabin advocating for peace during the long and bloody war. So he was for peace and tried to stay out of the conflict.

Then he mentions that his countrymen pointed at him and called him the friend of the white man, showing that others saw him as an ally. He even thought of living with the whites, but then Colonel Cresap murdered his family in cold blood. That's a turning point. Logan says he sought revenge, killing many, glutting his vengeance. But then he says he's glad for the peace and that his joy isn't from fear; he's fearless.

At the end, he asks who mourns for him, and says not one, indicating he's alone now.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Strength in unity among Indians. The passage doesn't mention unity; it's more about his personal actions and feelings.

B: Superiority over whites. I don't see that. He was friendly, then sought revenge, but not because he felt superior.

C: Believes in peaceful negotiation. He did advocate for peace initially, but after the murder, he took revenge. So maybe he's not against war entirely, but he tried peace first.

D: Stop British expansion. The text doesn't explicitly talk about stopping settlements, just his personal situation.

E: Regrets revenge. He says he fully glutted his vengeance, so he doesn't seem to regret it.

F: Laments loss of family. Yes, he's clearly mourning the death of his family, which led to his revenge.

G: Wants peaceful coexistence. He did before the murder, but after that, he sought revenge, so maybe he's not focused on that anymore.

H: Opposes peace treaty. He rejoices at peace, so he's not opposing it.

I: Incite war against whites. He killed many in revenge, but does he want to continue war? The passage ends with him accepting peace but saying his joy isn't from fear.

Wait, the question is about his perspective in the passage. So in the beginning, he was a friend, but after the tragedy, he took revenge. But in the end, he's glad for peace, but he's not afraid.

So, his main points are his past friendship, the betrayal, his revenge, and current acceptance of peace.

Looking at the options again, F says he laments the loss of his family. That's definitely true because he was motivated by their murder. But does that capture his overall perspective? Or is it more about his stance on peace vs. revenge.

Option C is about believing in peaceful negotiation. He was an advocate for peace, but after the attack, he resorted to revenge. So maybe he still believes in peace but was pushed to violence.

Alternatively, option G is about wanting peaceful coexistence. He did before, but after the event, he's not necessarily expressing that anymore. The passage's tone shifts from friendship to revenge, but he does mention rejoicing in peace. So maybe he's still for peace but is just stating his actions.

But the question is about his perspective in the passage as a whole. He starts with friendship, moves to revenge, but ends with peace.

Wait, another angle: the passage is often referred to as Logan's Lament. He's expressing sorrow and anger over the loss of his family. So F might be correct because he's lamenting their loss.

But let's look at the options again. The question is which option best expresses his perspective. His speech starts by showing his past friendship and the betrayal, leading to revenge, but he's now at peace. But the overall tone is one of sorrow and justified revenge rather than a call for future actions.

Option F says he laments the loss of his family. That's clearly a big part of the speech. But other options might also fit.

Option G says he wants peaceful coexistence. Before the murder, yes, but after, he's more about revenge. So maybe G isn't the best fit.

Option C is about believing in peaceful negotiation over war. He was an advocate for peace, but after being wronged, he took matters into his own hands. So maybe he still believes in peace, but it's not the main point now.

Option I says he seeks to incite war. He already took revenge, so he's not seeking to incite further war now. The passage ends with him accepting peace.

So, putting it together, the main emotions are his initial friendship, the betrayal, his revenge, and his current state of mind. He's not necessarily seeking to continue war, nor is he seeking to establish new peace. He's more reflecting on his situation.

Option F is about lamenting the loss of his family, which is a significant part of the passage. But another angle is that he's expressing that he's not afraid and that he's avenged his family, so he's at peace now. But the question is about his perspective—what's the main point he's conveying.

Wait, the options are about what best expresses his perspective. So, considering the entire passage, he's explaining why he acted the way he did. He starts by showing his friendship, then the betrayal, leading to revenge. But at the end, he's rejoicing in peace, but he's not afraid.

So perhaps his perspective is that he believes in the power of peaceful negotiation, but when that fails, one must take action. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, he's expressing that he's a man who doesn't fear death and has avenged his family.

Alternatively, looking at the options, F is about lamenting the loss of family, which is clearly present. But the passage is more about explaining his actions and his feelings about the situation.

Wait, the question is about the perspective, which is his overall viewpoint. So perhaps the best fit is F: Logan laments the loss of his family. Because that's the emotional core driving his actions.

Alternatively, another angle: he's explaining why he went to war, but now that he's avenged, he's at peace. But the options don't capture that exactly.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Strength in unity.

B: Superiority.

C: Peaceful negotiation.

D: Stop expansion.

E: Regrets revenge.

F: Laments loss.

G: Peaceful coexistence.

H: Opposes treaty.

I: Incite war.

He doesn't mention anything about unity or stopping expansion. He's not expressing regret for revenge. He's not inciting further war; he's done with it. He's not opposing a treaty, as he's glad for peace.

So, the main points are his past friendship, the murder of his family, his revenge, and his current acceptance of peace without fear.

So, his perspective is that he was a friend, but was betrayed, leading him to seek revenge, but now he's at peace. The passage is his justification and explanation.

So, the options that fit are F (lamenting loss) and C (peaceful negotiation). But he's not necessarily advocating for negotiation anymore, just explaining his past stance.

Alternatively, option G is about peaceful coexistence, which he wanted before but not after the betrayal.

Wait, the passage says he rejoices at the beams of peace. So he's happy peace is here. So perhaps he still believes in peaceful coexistence, but the murder made him take action. So his perspective is that he wants peace but was forced into revenge.

Hmm, but the question is which option best expresses his perspective. So, the passage shows that Logan is a man who was peaceful, tried to coexist, but was driven to revenge by the murder of his family. So his main perspective is that he wants peaceful coexistence but was wronged.

Wait, but option G says he wants to establish peaceful coexistence. The passage shows that he tried, but after the event, he took revenge. So now, he's at peace but perhaps not actively seeking to establish coexistence anymore.

Alternatively, the passage ends with him saying he's glad for peace, so maybe he still supports it.

I think the best fit is F: Logan laments the loss of his family. Because the entire speech is motivated by that loss and his subsequent actions. He's expressing his sorrow and explaining why he acted.

Wait, but the passage is more about explaining his actions and justifying revenge, rather than just lamenting. So perhaps the primary perspective is that he believes in peaceful negotiation but was forced into revenge.

Wait, the options are about what best expresses the perspective. So, considering that, the passage starts by highlighting his peaceful nature and friendship, then the betrayal, leading to revenge, but he's now at peace. So his perspective is that he believes in peaceful negotiation over war. But after being wronged, he had to resort to violence.

So option C says he believes in the power of peaceful negotiation over war. That seems to fit because he was an advocate for peace, tried to stay out of the war, and only acted violently when his family was killed. So his perspective is that negotiation is better, but sometimes revenge is necessary.

But the question is about the best expression of his perspective in the passage. The passage shows that he believes in peace but was driven to war because of personal tragedy.

Alternatively, the passage is a lament, so F might be the best fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between C and F. Let me read the passage again.

He starts by saying he was a friend, fed the hungry, etc. Then during the war, he was idle, advocating peace. His countrymen called him friend of whites. He even thought of living with them but for Cresap's actions. Then he took revenge, glutting vengeance. Now, he's glad for peace, but not out of fear. He's fearless.

So, the main points: past friendship and peace, betrayal leading to revenge, current acceptance of peace without fear.

So, his perspective is that he was a peaceful man who was wronged, leading him to seek revenge, but he's now at peace. So, the best answer might be F: he laments the loss of his family. But he's more explaining his actions than just lamenting.

Alternatively, option C: believes in peaceful negotiation. Because he tried that first before resorting to revenge.

Wait, the passage doesn't explicitly say he believes in negotiation, but shows that he tried to live peacefully. So perhaps option G: wants peaceful coexistence. But after the event, he's not seeking that anymore.

Alternatively, the passage ends with him rejoicing at peace, so perhaps he still wants coexistence.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option C is about believing in peaceful negotiation over war. The passage shows he did advocate for peace, so that fits.

Option F is about lamenting the loss of family, which is also true.

Which is the best fit? The question is about his perspective. So, the passage is his address explaining why he acted. He explains that he was a friend, but was wronged, leading to revenge. So, his perspective is that he believes in peace but was forced into war.

Therefore, the best option is C: Logan believes in the power of peaceful negotiation over war.

Wait, but he only resorted to war after the murder. So perhaps he does believe in negotiation, but when that fails, he takes action.

Alternatively, the passage is more about his personal story than his belief in negotiation. So the best fit might be F, as the loss of family is the core of his speech.

I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I should look for keywords in the passage that align with the options.

He says, "I had even thought to have lived with you but for the injuries of one man." So he wanted to coexist, but the injury (murder) stopped that. So he wanted peaceful coexistence, which is option G. But after the event, he took revenge, so perhaps he no longer seeks coexistence.

Wait, but at the end, he says, "For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace." So he's happy that peace has come. So maybe he still supports peace.

Hmm, this is tricky. Another approach: what is the main theme of the speech? It's a speech about betrayal and revenge, but also about the loss leading to his actions. So the main perspective is his lament for his family and explaining his actions.

Therefore, the best option is F: Logan laments the loss of his family.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: the options are about what he expresses in the passage. He talks about his family's murder, his revenge, and his current stance on peace.

Option F is about lamenting the loss, which is definitely present. Option C is about believing in negotiation. He did try to stay peaceful, but does that mean he believes in it as a solution?

I think the answer is F.

The passage attributed to Logan, an Indian leader, expresses his perspective through a narrative of past friendship with white settlers, betrayal, revenge, and ultimate acceptance of peace. Logan begins by highlighting his kindness and advocacy for peace, even as others labeled him a friend to the white man. However, the murder of his family by Colonel Cresap becomes a turning point, driving him to seek revenge. Despite this, he concludes by rejoicing in the peace that has come, emphasizing that his joy is not born of fear.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Logan does not mention unity among Indians, so this is irrelevant.  
- **B**: There is no indication of superiority over whites; his tone is one of sorrow and betrayal.  
- **C**: While Logan initially advocates for peace, the passage focuses more on his personal story of loss and revenge rather than a broader belief in negotiation.  
- **D**: The passage does not discuss stopping British expansion, making this option irrelevant.  
- **E**: Logan does not express regret for seeking revenge; he states it was necessary.  
- **F**: The loss of his family is central to the passage, driving his actions and emotions, making this a strong fit.  
- **G**: While Logan initially desired peaceful coexistence, the betrayal and revenge overshadow this aspect by the end.  
- **H**: Logan rejoices in peace, so he does not oppose a peace treaty.  
- **I**: Logan does not seek to incite further war; he has already satisfied his vengeance.

The core of Logan's perspective is his lament for the loss of his family, which motivates his actions and explains his shift from peace to revenge. While he rejoices in the return of peace, the emotional heart of the passage is his sorrow over the murder of his loved ones. Thus, the best answer is:

**F: Logan laments the loss of his family.**

Answer: F
