Question:

Ann, Bea, and Carla were three friends who lived in the same neighborhood. While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement?

Options:

A: Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.
B: Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.
C: Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
D: Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.

Alright, so I've got this contract law question here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my contracts, but I'll think through it.

Okay, the situation involves three friends: Ann, Bea, and Carla. Let's recap the facts. Ann's garage was broken into, and her golf clubs were stolen. Then, Ann asks Bea to borrow her golf clubs for a vacation, and Bea agrees. But Ann doesn't return them and keeps using them. Later, Bea finds out that Carla owes Ann $4,000, but Carla can't pay because she lost her job. So Bea offers to repay the debt on Carla's behalf.

They make a written agreement where Bea promises to pay Ann $400 a month for the $4,000 debt. In the same agreement, Ann promises to return Bea's golf clubs. Ann didn't promise to forbear suing Carla, and Bea didn't ask her to. After signing, Ann returns the clubs, and Bea makes payments for six months. Then Bea stops paying, and Ann sues her. The statute of limitations on Ann's claim against Carla expired the day before Ann sued Bea.

The question is about whether Bea is liable under their agreement. The options suggest various defenses Bea might have.

I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be consideration. Consideration requires a bargained-for exchange, meaning each party gives something of legal value. Also, pre-existing duties can affect consideration. Like, if you're already supposed to do something, doing it isn't consideration.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ann didn't expressly promise to forbear suing Carla, so her forbearance can't be consideration. But Ann did forbear for six months. I think forbearance can be consideration if it's what was bargained for. But since Ann didn't promise to forbear, maybe her actual forbearance doesn't count. Or does it count as part of the consideration?

Option B: The written agreement has an imbalance in value. But consideration doesn't require equality, just sufficiency. So even if it's one-sided, as long as there's some consideration, it's okay. So this might not be a good argument.

Option C: Carla had a pre-existing duty to repay Ann, so Bea's promise lacks consideration. Wait, Carla's duty is to Ann, but Bea is making the promise. So Bea's promise is a new duty, not based on Carla's. So this might not apply. Because Carla's obligation doesn't affect Bea's consideration.

Option D: Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs. So when Ann agreed to return them, that's not consideration because it's what she was already supposed to do. So if Ann's promise to return the clubs was her only consideration, and that's a pre-existing duty, then there's no consideration for Bea's promise.

Wait, so the agreement had two parts: Bea promises to pay $4k at $400/month, and Ann promises to return the clubs. So each promise must be supported by consideration.

If Ann was already supposed to return the clubs (because she borrowed them and promised to return after vacation), then her promise to return them now is not new consideration. Because she was already under a duty to return them. So if Ann's only consideration is returning the clubs, which she was already obliged to do, then there's no consideration from Ann. Without consideration, Bea's promise isn't supported, so the contract isn't enforceable.

So the issue is whether Ann's promise to return the clubs counts as consideration. Since she was already supposed to return them, it's not new consideration. Therefore, there's no consideration for Bea's promise. So Bea's promise isn't supported by consideration, making the contract unenforceable.

So looking at the options, D seems to be the right answer. Because Ann had a pre-existing duty to return the clubs, so her promise in the agreement doesn't count as consideration. Thus, Bea's promise to pay the debt isn't supported by consideration, so Bea isn't liable.

The question revolves around whether Bea is liable to Ann under their written agreement, focusing on the concept of consideration in contract law. For a contract to be enforceable, each party must provide something of legal value that is bargained for. If a party does something they are already legally obligated to do, it does not constitute consideration.

In this case, the written agreement between Ann and Bea included two promises: (1) Bea promised to pay Ann $400 monthly to settle Carla's $4,000 debt, and (2) Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs. The key issue is whether Ann's promise to return the golf clubs counts as valid consideration. Ann had previously borrowed the golf clubs from Bea and was already under a legal obligation to return them. Therefore, her promise to return the clubs in the agreement was not a new obligation but rather the fulfillment of a pre-existing duty. Without valid consideration from Ann, Bea's promise to pay the debt lacks the necessary legal support.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: While Ann did not expressly promise to forbear suing Carla, her actual forbearance for six months could still constitute consideration if it was bargained for. However, the agreement did not include such a promise, making this argument less persuasive.
- **Option B**: The imbalance in the value of the promises does not invalidate the contract, as consideration only requires sufficiency, not equality. This argument is weak.
- **Option C**: Carla's pre-existing duty to repay the debt does not directly affect Bea's promise, as Bea's obligation is independent of Carla's. This is not a strong argument.
- **Option D**: Ann's promise to return the golf clubs was a pre-existing duty, as she had already borrowed and promised to return them. This means her promise in the agreement does not constitute valid consideration. Without consideration, Bea's promise to pay the debt is not enforceable.

The most persuasive argument is that Ann's promise to return the golf clubs was not valid consideration because it was based on a pre-existing duty. Therefore, Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement.
