The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man suffered frostbite when he spilled a soft drink on his lap that he had purchased from a restaurant. The man sued the restaurant for negligence and damages. At trial, the man's attorney calls a witness to testify that the witness also suffered frostbite when she spilled a soft drink in her lap that she had purchased at the restaurant two weeks earlier. The witness also states that she told the restaurant about her injury immediately after suffering it. Upon objection by the restaurant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the witness's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, but only to prove the restaurant's negligence and not for any claims of damages.
B: inadmissible, as it is an unrelated incident and does not prove the restaurant's negligence in the man's case.
C: admissible, as it is a similar occurrence and can prove a pattern of negligence by the restaurant.
D: inadmissible, as it is hearsay and not directly related to the man's case.
E: admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger of frostbite posed by its soft drinks.
F: inadmissible, because it is not probative of a fact in issue.
G: admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence, provided that the court gives a cautionary instruction that the testimony should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages.
H: inadmissible, because it seeks to put into evidence separate, unrelated transactions with a third party.
I: admissible, as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk associated with their soft drinks.
J: inadmissible, because it constitutes character evidence against the restaurant.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the witness's testimony is admissible in this case. Let me break it down step by step.

The situation is that a man sued a restaurant for negligence after spilling a soft drink on his lap and suffering frostbite. His attorney called a witness who had a similar experience two weeks earlier, also suffering frostbite and informing the restaurant immediately.

The question is about the admissibility of this testimony. The options are A through J, each with different reasons.

First, I remember that evidence of prior incidents can sometimes be used to show negligence, especially if it's similar and shows a pattern or knowledge on the defendant's part.

I think about the rules of evidence. Specifically, I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), evidence of prior acts isn't admissible to prove the character of a person (like a restaurant) to show they were negligent. That's FRE 404(a). But there are exceptions. For example, prior incidents can be admissible to show notice or knowledge, or to establish a pattern of behavior that indicates negligence.

Here, the witness's testimony is about a similar incidentâ€”spilling a soft drink leading to frostbite. That seems relevant. The fact that she told the restaurant right after suggests the restaurant had notice. So this could be used to show the restaurant knew about the risk and failed to act, which ties into negligence.

Wait, but is this evidence being used to prove the restaurant is generally negligent (which would be character evidence) or specifically that they had notice and failed to warn or fix the problem? The latter would make it admissible because it's not about the restaurant's character but about their specific knowledge and actions.

So looking at the options, option E says it's admissible to prove the restaurant should have been aware of the danger. That sounds right because it's about notice, a key element in negligence cases. 

Option C says it's admissible as a similar occurrence showing a pattern. I think that's also a possibility, but I need to see if it's being used for that purpose or just to show notice.

Option I says it's admissible as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk. That also seems correct, similar to E.

Wait, the witness's testimony includes that she told the restaurant immediately. So the restaurant had actual notice two weeks before the man's incident. That makes it directly relevant to whether the restaurant was negligent in not addressing the issue after being informed.

So the testimony is being used to show that the restaurant knew about the problem and didn't fix it, which makes their negligence more likely. That would make the evidence admissible for that purpose.

Looking at the options again, E and I seem relevant. Let me read them:

E: admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger.

I: admissible as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk.

Hmm. The witness told the restaurant, so that's actual knowledge, not just constructive knowledge (should have known). So E says "should have been aware," which is constructive, but I is about demonstrating their actual knowledge.

Wait, the witness informed them, so it's actual knowledge. So the testimony shows the restaurant had actual notice. Therefore, option I would be more appropriate because it's about their actual knowledge, not just what they should have known.

But looking at the options, the testimony's admissibility hinges on whether it's being used for the right purpose. The key issue is whether this prior incident is admissible to prove negligence in the current case.

Also, I should consider whether such evidence is barred under FRE 402 as not being relevant. But it's relevant because it shows the restaurant's knowledge and possible failure to act, which is a factor in determining negligence.

So option I seems correct, but wait, let me check the options again.

Option E: admissible to prove the restaurant should have been aware.

Option I: admissible as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge.

Since the witness told them, that's actual knowledge, making E less accurate because E is about what they should have known, not what they actually knew. So I is better.

But wait, the options may not all be correct. Let me see the possible answer choices again.

Wait, the question is about whether the trial judge should rule the testimony admissible or not. So the correct reasoning is that the prior incident is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge, which is a key element in proving negligence.

So the correct answer should be E or I. Wait, the options are:

E: admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger.

I: admissible as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk.

But wait, the witness's testimony includes that she told the restaurant, so that's evidence of actual knowledge, not just that they should have known. Therefore, the purpose is to show they had actual knowledge. So E is about "should have been aware," which is constructive knowledge, but I is about demonstrating their actual knowledge.

So the correct option would be I, because it's about the restaurant's actual knowledge, which makes their failure to act negligent.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E is about showing they should have been aware. Option I is about demonstrating their knowledge.

I think the better fit here is E because the prior incident, even if the restaurant was told, might be used to show that they had notice and thus should have taken action. Alternatively, it could be both.

Wait, perhaps the answer is E, because the prior incident allows the court to infer that the restaurant should have been aware, whether or not they were actually told. But in this case, the witness did inform them, so it's actual knowledge.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that evidence of prior similar incidents is admissible to show the defendant's knowledge or negligence.

So the correct answer is E or I. Alternatively, option C says it's admissible as a similar occurrence and can prove a pattern of negligence.

Wait, but pattern of negligence is more about showing that the defendant has a tendency, which might be character evidence under FRE 404(a), which is generally inadmissible. So using it to show a pattern might not be allowed unless it's for another purpose, like notice.

So perhaps option E is better because it's about proving the restaurant's awareness, which is a specific purpose.

Wait, but the fact that the witness told the restaurant makes it actual knowledge, so perhaps E is about constructive knowledge, which isn't as strong as actual. So maybe the correct answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because even if the restaurant was told, the prior incident itself (the frostbite) could show that they should have known without being told, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the rules again.

FRE 402: Relevant evidence is admissible unless the rules say otherwise.

FRE 403: Even relevant evidence can be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by prejudice, confusion, etc.

FRE 404(a): Evidence of a person's character or character trait is inadmissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character or trait. But there are exceptions, like for the accused in a criminal case, or for showing knowledge, intent, etc.

FRE 405(a): In cases where character evidence is admissible, it must be via reputation or opinion, not specific instances. But when character isn't the primary issue, specific instances can be used for other purposes.

In this case, the prior incident is being used to show the restaurant's knowledge or notice, so it's admissible under FRE 404(b), which allows evidence of other acts for purposes such as proof of knowledge, intent, preparation, plan, etc.

Wait, but I think FRE 404(b) is about specific instances for certain purposes, not for showing propensity. So the prior incident can be used to show that the restaurant had knowledge of the dangerous condition, which is relevant to their negligence.

So the testimony is admissible for that purpose, making options E or I correct.

Option E: to prove the restaurant should have been aware.

Option I: demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge.

Since the witness told the restaurant, the latter is about actual knowledge, making I the better choice.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option E is about the restaurant's awareness (should have been aware), which is about constructive knowledge.

Option I is about demonstrating their knowledge, which could be actual.

So the correct answer would be I, because the witness informed them, showing actual knowledge.

Wait, but the options don't explicitly state that. Let me look at the options again.

Option I says: "admissible, as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk associated with their soft drinks."

Yes, that fits because the witness told them, showing they knew.

So the answer should be I.

Wait, but another angle: Is the prior incident too remote in time? It happened two weeks earlier. Time proximity can affect admissibility, but two weeks isn't that long, so it's likely admissible.

Another point: The testimony is about a third party's experience, but that's okay if it's for the purpose of showing the defendant's knowledge or negligence, not for showing the defendant's propensity to be negligent.

So the witness's testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge, hence option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn between E and I. Let me see what each option states.

Option E: admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger.

Option I: admissible as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge.

Since the witness told them, it's actual knowledge, so I is better.

Therefore, the correct answer is I.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony from a witness who experienced a similar incident of frostbite from a soft drink purchased at the same restaurant two weeks earlier. The witness also informed the restaurant about her injury immediately. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), prior incidents can be admissible if they serve a purpose other than showing the defendant's propensity for negligence, such as demonstrating notice, knowledge, or a failure to act. Here, the witness's testimony is relevant because it shows that the restaurant had actual knowledge of the risk (since the witness informed them) and failed to address it, which is directly tied to the negligence claim.

Option E suggests the testimony is admissible to prove the restaurant "should have been aware" of the danger, which implies constructive knowledge. However, the witness's notification makes this about actual knowledge, not just what the restaurant should have known. Option I, on the other hand, states the testimony is admissible because it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk, which aligns with the fact that the witness informed the restaurant, establishing actual knowledge.

Given that the testimony is used to show the restaurant's actual knowledge and failure to act, the correct answer is:

**I**

Answer: I
