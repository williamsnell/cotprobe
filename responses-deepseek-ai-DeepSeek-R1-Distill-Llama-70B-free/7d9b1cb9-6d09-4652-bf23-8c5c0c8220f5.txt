Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about social psychology, specifically about attitudes and persuasion. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is: Exposing individuals to arguments against their views, which are then strongly refuted, may serve to... and then there are several options.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that there's a concept called "inoculation theory." I think it's about how people can be protected against persuasion attempts. So, if someone is presented with counterarguments to their existing views, but those counterarguments are then refuted effectively, it might make their original views stronger. 

Wait, so the idea is that by exposing people to opposing views and then refuting them, you're kind of vaccinating them against future persuasion. Like how a vaccine inoculates you against a disease. So in this case, the person becomes more resistant to changing their views later on because they've already been "inoculated" against those arguments.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Make them more argumentative. I don't think so. Inoculation isn't about making people more likely to argue; it's about making their beliefs more resistant to change.

Option B: Make them more susceptible to accepting opposing views. That seems the opposite of inoculation. If they're inoculated, they should be less likely to accept opposing views, not more.

Option C: Weaken their resistance to later persuasive appeals. Wait, no, inoculation strengthens resistance, so this is the opposite. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Increase their attitudinal ambivalence. Ambivalence means having mixed feelings. I'm not sure. If you refute arguments, maybe people become more confident, so less ambivalent. Or maybe it depends. Not sure yet.

Option E: Strengthen their existing views. That sounds right. If their views are challenged but then refuted, they might feel more confident in their original stance. So E is a possible answer.

Option F: Lead them to develop new, unrelated opinions. Doesn't seem related. The question is about the same attitude, not new opinions.

Option G: Render them indifferent to the attitude object. Indifferent means not caring. I don't think that's the case. They might care more if their views are strengthened.

Option H: Inoculate them against later persuasive appeals. Oh, yes! This is exactly what I was thinking earlier. So H is another possible answer.

Option I: Confuse them about their original beliefs. Maybe, but I think the refutation would clarify and strengthen, not confuse.

Option J: Cause them to reject all future arguments. That seems too extreme. Inoculation makes them resistant, but not necessarily rejecting all arguments.

So now I'm a bit stuck between E and H. Let me think again. The process of inoculation involves presenting counterarguments and refuting them, which makes the person's existing attitudes stronger and more resistant to future persuasion. So in that case, the effect would be that they're inoculated against later persuasive appeals, which is option H.

Wait, but option E says it strengthens their existing views, which is also correct. But the question is asking what does exposing them to arguments and then refuting them serve to do. So the process serves to inoculate them, making their views stronger and more resistant. So H is about inoculating against future persuasion, while E is about strengthening. Both could be correct, but I think the primary effect in inoculation theory is about protection against future persuasion, which is H.

Wait, but wait another moment. The question is phrased as "may serve to..." So the intended correct answer is probably H, because inoculation is the term that directly relates to this process. Strengthening their existing views is a part of it, but the function is to inoculate them against future persuasion.

Alternatively, maybe both H and E are correct, but looking at the options, I have to choose one. Let me recall the textbook. I think the main idea is that inoculation increases resistance, so the answer would be H.

The question revolves around the concept of inoculation theory in social psychology, which suggests that exposing individuals to counterarguments and then refuting them can make their existing views more resistant to future persuasion. This process is akin to a vaccine, where individuals are "inoculated" against later persuasive appeals. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J** are incorrect because they either contradict the concept of inoculation or do not align with the strengthening of resistance to persuasion.
- **E** (strengthen their existing views) is partially correct, as inoculation does strengthen beliefs, but it is not the primary focus of the process.
- **H** (inoculate them against later persuasive appeals) directly captures the essence of inoculation theory, emphasizing the protection against future persuasion.

Thus, the most accurate answer is **H**, as it reflects the core mechanism of inoculation.

Answer: H
