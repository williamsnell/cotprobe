Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about auditing and substantive tests related to stock options granted to senior management. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully.

The question is asking what an auditor would most likely do when performing substantive tests regarding the granting of stock options. Substantive tests are procedures that focus on whether the financial data is accurate and whether the transactions are valid. These tests help the auditor gather evidence to support their opinion on the financial statements.

The options given are A through J. Let me go through each one and see which makes the most sense.

Option A: Interview senior management to determine their knowledge of stock options. Interviews are part of audit procedures, but I'm not sure if this is a substantive test. It might be more of a preliminary step to understand the process rather than verifying the transactions themselves.

Option B: Confirm with the issuer's legal counsel whether the options were legally granted. That sounds like a way to check compliance with laws, which is important. But is this the most direct way to perform a substantive test? It might be more about legal compliance than verifying the financial records.

Option C: Review the public records of the SEC to determine whether the options were properly reported. This seems more like a check on disclosure rather than the substantive aspect of whether the options were correctly granted and accounted for. It's about reporting to the SEC, not the internal granting process.

Option D: Trace the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval. This sounds promising. Substantive tests often involve tracing transactions back to their authorization. If the board approved the stock options, the auditor would want to ensure that the options were indeed authorized. So tracing the authorization makes sense here.

Option E: Confirm with those members of management as to whether they are actually option holders. This is about verifying the existence of option holders, which is a valid point. However, it might be more of an existence test (like checking if assets exist) rather than a substantive test focused on the granting process.

Option F: Review the issuer's tax records to determine the tax implications. Tax implications are important, but this seems more related to tax auditing rather than substantive tests on the stock option grants themselves.

Option G: Verify the existence of option holders in the issuer's payroll and human resources records. This is about ensuring that the people receiving the options are actual employees. Again, this seems like an existence and accuracy test rather than focusing on the authorization of the grants.

Option H: Review the minutes of the board of directors' meetings to determine if the options were discussed. This is similar to option D. If the minutes show discussion and approval, that's a good indication. But the question is about the authorization for the options granted, so looking at the minutes could help, but maybe option D is more direct about tracing the authorization.

Option I: Analyze the financial reports to determine the impact of the stock options on the company's profitability. This is about the financial statement impact, which is part of substantive procedures. However, the question is specifically about the granting of the options, not their financial impact.

Option J: Inspect the company's employee handbook to verify the policy on stock options. This would help understand the company's policies but might not directly address whether the specific grants were properly authorized.

So, putting it all together, the auditor needs to perform a substantive test to verify that the stock options were granted with proper authorization. That would involve checking that the board of directors approved the grants. Option D says to trace the authorization to the board's approval, which seems like the correct approach. Option H is about reviewing minutes, which might also be relevant, but option D is more about the authorization process itself. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is D.

The auditor's primary goal in performing substantive tests regarding the granting of stock options is to verify that the transactions are valid and properly authorized. Among the options, tracing the authorization for the options granted to the board of directors' approval (Option D) directly addresses this by ensuring that the stock options were approved at the appropriate level. While reviewing the minutes (Option H) could provide supporting evidence, Option D is more specific to the authorization process, making it the most appropriate choice.

Answer: D
