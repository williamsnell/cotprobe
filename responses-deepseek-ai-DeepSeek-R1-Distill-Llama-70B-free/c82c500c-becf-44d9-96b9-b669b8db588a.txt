Alright, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The function is h(x) = (x^(-1/2) + 2x)(7 - x^(-1)), and I need to find h'(x) when x = 4. The answer choices are given from A to J, so I'll need to compute the derivative correctly and see which one matches.

Okay, first, I remember that to find the derivative of a product of two functions, I should use the product rule. The product rule states that if you have h(x) = f(x) * g(x), then h'(x) = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x). So I'll need to split h(x) into two parts: f(x) and g(x).

Looking at h(x), I can let f(x) = x^(-1/2) + 2x and g(x) = 7 - x^(-1). That seems reasonable because it breaks the product into two separate functions.

Now, I'll find the derivatives f'(x) and g'(x) separately.

Starting with f(x) = x^(-1/2) + 2x. The derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1), so:

- The derivative of x^(-1/2) is (-1/2)*x^(-3/2) = -1/(2x^(3/2)).
- The derivative of 2x is 2*1 = 2.

So f'(x) = -1/(2x^(3/2)) + 2.

Next, g(x) = 7 - x^(-1). Let's find g'(x):

- The derivative of 7 is 0.
- The derivative of -x^(-1) is (-1)*(-1)x^(-2) = 1/x^2.

So g'(x) = 1/x^2.

Now, applying the product rule: h'(x) = f'(x)*g(x) + f(x)*g'(x).

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, f'(x)*g(x):

f'(x) = -1/(2x^(3/2)) + 2
g(x) = 7 - x^(-1) = 7 - 1/x

So f'(x)*g(x) = [ -1/(2x^(3/2)) + 2 ] * [7 - 1/x ]

I'll expand this multiplication:

= (-1/(2x^(3/2)))*7 + (-1/(2x^(3/2)))*(-1/x) + 2*7 + 2*(-1/x)
= -7/(2x^(3/2)) + 1/(2x^(5/2)) + 14 - 2/x

Next, f(x)*g'(x):

f(x) = x^(-1/2) + 2x
g'(x) = 1/x^2

So f(x)*g'(x) = [x^(-1/2) + 2x] * (1/x^2)
= x^(-1/2)/x^2 + 2x/x^2
= x^(-5/2) + 2x^(-1)
= 1/(x^(5/2)) + 2/x

Now, combine both parts:

h'(x) = [ -7/(2x^(3/2)) + 1/(2x^(5/2)) + 14 - 2/x ] + [ 1/(x^(5/2)) + 2/x ]

Let's combine like terms:

- The terms with x^(-5/2): 1/(2x^(5/2)) + 1/(x^(5/2)) = (1/2 + 1) * 1/x^(5/2) = (3/2)/x^(5/2)
- The terms with x^(-3/2): -7/(2x^(3/2))
- The constant term: 14
- The terms with x^(-1): (-2/x) + 2/x = 0

So h'(x) simplifies to:

h'(x) = (3/(2x^(5/2))) - (7/(2x^(3/2))) + 14

Now, I need to evaluate this at x = 4.

Plugging in x = 4:

h'(4) = [3/(2*(4)^(5/2))] - [7/(2*(4)^(3/2))] + 14

First, compute 4^(5/2) and 4^(3/2):

4^(1/2) = 2
4^(3/2) = (4^(1/2))^3 = 2^3 = 8
4^(5/2) = (4^(1/2))^5 = 2^5 = 32

Now substitute back:

h'(4) = [3/(2*32)] - [7/(2*8)] + 14
= (3/64) - (7/16) + 14

Now, let's compute each fraction:

3/64 ≈ 0.046875
7/16 ≈ 0.4375

So:

= 0.046875 - 0.4375 + 14
= (-0.390625) + 14
= 13.609375

Looking at the answer choices, option I is 13.609, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, checking the derivatives:

f(x) = x^(-1/2) + 2x
f'(x) = (-1/2)x^(-3/2) + 2 → correct.

g(x) =7 - x^(-1)
g'(x) = x^(-2) → correct.

Product rule applied correctly.

Then, expanding f'(x)*g(x):

[-1/(2x^(3/2)) +2][7 -1/x] → expanded correctly.

Then f(x)*g'(x) = [x^(-1/2) + 2x]*(1/x^2) → correctly expanded.

Combining all terms and simplifying, the x^(-1) terms cancel out, which seems right.

At x=4, calculations for 4^(3/2)=8 and 4^(5/2)=32 are correct.

So 3/(2*32)=3/64≈0.046875, 7/(2*8)=7/16=0.4375.

So 0.046875 - 0.4375 = -0.390625 +14=13.609375, which matches option I.

I think that's correct.

To solve the problem, we start by expressing the function \( h(x) = (x^{-1/2} + 2x)(7 - x^{-1}) \) as a product of two functions: \( f(x) = x^{-1/2} + 2x \) and \( g(x) = 7 - x^{-1} \). Using the product rule, \( h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) \), we compute the derivatives \( f'(x) \) and \( g'(x) \).

1. **Derivative of \( f(x) \):**
   \[
   f(x) = x^{-1/2} + 2x
   \]
   \[
   f'(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x^{-3/2} + 2 = -\frac{1}{2x^{3/2}} + 2
   \]

2. **Derivative of \( g(x) \):**
   \[
   g(x) = 7 - x^{-1}
   \]
   \[
   g'(x) = x^{-2} = \frac{1}{x^2}
   \]

3. **Apply the product rule:**
   \[
   h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
   \]
   Substituting \( f'(x) \), \( g(x) \), \( f(x) \), and \( g'(x) \):
   \[
   h'(x) = \left(-\frac{1}{2x^{3/2}} + 2\right)(7 - \frac{1}{x}) + \left(x^{-1/2} + 2x\right)\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)
   \]

4. **Expand and simplify \( h'(x) \):**
   - First term: \( \left(-\frac{1}{2x^{3/2}} + 2\right)(7 - \frac{1}{x}) \)
     \[
     = -\frac{7}{2x^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{2x^{5/2}} + 14 - \frac{2}{x}
     \]
   - Second term: \( \left(x^{-1/2} + 2x\right)\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right) \)
     \[
     = \frac{1}{x^{5/2}} + \frac{2}{x}
     \]
   - Combine all terms:
     \[
     h'(x) = -\frac{7}{2x^{3/2}} + \frac{1}{2x^{5/2}} + 14 - \frac{2}{x} + \frac{1}{x^{5/2}} + \frac{2}{x}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     h'(x) = \frac{3}{2x^{5/2}} - \frac{7}{2x^{3/2}} + 14
     \]

5. **Evaluate \( h'(x) \) at \( x = 4 \):**
   - Compute \( 4^{3/2} = 8 \) and \( 4^{5/2} = 32 \):
     \[
     h'(4) = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 32} - \frac{7}{2 \cdot 8} + 14
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{3}{64} - \frac{7}{16} + 14
     \]
   - Convert to decimal:
     \[
     \frac{3}{64} \approx 0.046875, \quad \frac{7}{16} \approx 0.4375
     \]
     \[
     h'(4) = 0.046875 - 0.4375 + 14 = 13.609375
     \]

6. **Match with the answer choices:**
   The closest value to \( 13.609375 \) is \( 13.609 \), which corresponds to option **I**.

**Final Answer:** I
