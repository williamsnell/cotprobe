Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Roslyn has twenty boxes. Thirteen of the boxes contain pencils, nine have pens, and three have neither pens nor pencils. The question is asking how many boxes contain both pens and pencils. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Hmm. Alright, I think I need to use some kind of set theory or Venn diagram approach here. Because we're dealing with groups (pencils, pens) and their overlaps.

So the total number of boxes is 20. Out of these, 3 have neither pens nor pencils. That means the remaining boxes must have either pens, pencils, or both. Let me calculate that first.

Total boxes = 20
Boxes with neither = 3
So boxes with pens or pencils or both = 20 -3 = 17.

Oh, right! So the 17 boxes are the ones that have pens, pencils, or both. Now, the number of boxes with pencils is 13, and with pens is 9. But wait, if I just add 13 and 9, that's 22. But we only have 17 boxes in this category. So that means there's an overlap. 

I remember the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula is: 
Number of boxes with pens or pencils = Number with pencils + Number with pens - Number with both.

Let me write that down. Let's let P be pencils, E be pens. So:

|P ∪ E| = |P| + |E| - |P ∩ E|

We know |P ∪ E| is 17, |P| is 13, |E| is 9. Plugging those in:

17 = 13 + 9 - |P ∩ E|

Wait, 13 plus 9 is 22. So 17 equals 22 minus the overlap. So subtracting 17 from 22 gives us 5. So the number of boxes that have both is 5. 

Wait, let me double-check. If 5 boxes have both, then the number of boxes with only pencils is 13-5=8, and only pens is 9-5=4. Adding those up: 8 +4=12, plus the 5 that have both makes 17. Yep, that matches. So the answer should be 5, which is option H.

To determine how many boxes contain both pens and pencils, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

1. **Total boxes**: 20  
   - Boxes with neither pens nor pencils: 3  
   - Therefore, boxes with pens, pencils, or both: \( 20 - 3 = 17 \).

2. **Number of boxes with pencils**: 13  
   **Number of boxes with pens**: 9  

3. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:  
   \[
   |P \cup E| = |P| + |E| - |P \cap E|
   \]  
   Substituting the known values:  
   \[
   17 = 13 + 9 - |P \cap E|
   \]  
   Solving for \( |P \cap E| \):  
   \[
   |P \cap E| = 13 + 9 - 17 = 5
   \]

Thus, the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils is **5**.
