Okay, let's see. I have this problem where a programmer earns $6.50 an hour. His take-home pay is 81% of his gross pay. I need to find a function for the take-home pay and determine how many hours he must work to take home $200. The options are from A to J, and I need to select the correct one.

First, I think I should model the problem. So, his gross pay is the amount he earns before any deductions, right? That would be his hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours he works. So if he works 'h' hours, his gross pay is 6.50 * h.

Now, his take-home pay is 81% of that gross amount. So the function for take-home pay (let's call it THP) would be THP = 0.81 * gross pay. Substituting the gross pay, it becomes THP = 0.81 * 6.50 * h. That should be the function.

The next part is to find out how many hours he needs to work to take home $200. So I set THP equal to 200 and solve for h.

Let's write that equation: 200 = 0.81 * 6.50 * h.

I think I should calculate 0.81 multiplied by 6.50 first. Let me do that. 0.81 * 6.50. Hmm, 6.50 times 0.8 is 5.2, and 6.50 times 0.01 is 0.065, so adding those gives 5.2 + 0.065 = 5.265. So 0.81 * 6.50 is 5.265.

So the equation becomes 200 = 5.265 * h. To find h, I divide both sides by 5.265. So h = 200 / 5.265.

Let me compute that. 200 divided by 5.265. I can approximate this. Let me think, 5.265 times 38 is what? 5 * 38 is 190, 0.265 * 38. Let's calculate 0.265 * 38: 0.2 *38=7.6, 0.06*38=2.28, 0.005*38=0.19. Adding those: 7.6+2.28=9.88+0.19=10.07. So 5.265 * 38 = 190 +10.07=200.07. Oh, that's very close to 200. So h is approximately 38 hours.

Wait, but let me check. Because 5.265 * 38 is about 200.07, which is just a bit over 200. So 38 hours would give him just slightly more than $200. But since we're talking about take-home pay, perhaps he can't work a fraction of an hour, so he'd need to work 38 hours to reach at least $200.

Looking at the options, option D is 38 hours. So the answer should be D.

To determine how many hours the programmer must work to take home $200, we first express the take-home pay (THP) as a function of the hours worked (h). The gross pay is $6.50 per hour, and the take-home pay is 81% of the gross pay. Thus:

\[
\text{THP} = 0.81 \times 6.50 \times h
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{THP} = 5.265 \times h
\]

We need to find the value of \( h \) when \(\text{THP} = 200\):

\[
200 = 5.265 \times h
\]

Solving for \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{200}{5.265} \approx 38 \, \text{hours}
\]

Thus, the programmer must work approximately 38 hours to take home $200. The correct answer is:

D: 38 hours
