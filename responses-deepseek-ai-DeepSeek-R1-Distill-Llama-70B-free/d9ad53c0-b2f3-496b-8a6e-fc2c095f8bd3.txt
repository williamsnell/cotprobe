Okay, so I've got this physics problem about lenses and image projection. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says a lens is used to project a lantern slide image onto a screen 160 feet away. The image is 100 times larger than the slide. Then the screen moves 100 inches closer, and I need to find how much the slide must be moved relative to the lens to keep the image sharp.

Wait, I remember something about the lens equation. Oh right, the thin lens formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.

But wait, the image is 100 times larger. So the magnification m is di/do = 100. Oh wait, no, wait. Magnification is the height of the image divided by the height of the object. But for real images, the magnification is negative, but maybe here we're just considering the absolute value.

So m = di/do = 100. So di = 100 * do.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Because if the image is larger, the image distance is longer than the object distance. So for a lantern slide, the object is placed just beyond the focal point, so the image is real and inverted. So yeah, di = m * do, where m is positive if the image is inverted relative to the object. But magnification m is positive here because it's 100 times larger, so di is 100 times do.

Wait no, magnification is actually (image height)/(object height) = -di/do. So if the image is 100 times larger and inverted, m = -100. So -di/do = 100. So di = -100 do. But distances are positive, so maybe we can take the magnitude. So di = 100 do.

But maybe for the purpose of calculating distances, I can ignore the sign and just take the ratio as 100:1.

So initially, the screen is 160 feet away. So di_initial = 160 feet. Since di = 100 do_initial, then do_initial = di / 100 = 160 / 100 = 1.6 feet.

Wait, converting units: 1 foot is 12 inches. So 1.6 feet is 19.2 inches. So the initial object distance is 19.2 inches from the lens.

Now, the screen is moved 100 inches closer. So the new di is 160 feet - 100 inches. Wait, I need to have consistent units. Let's convert everything to inches.

160 feet is 160 * 12 = 1920 inches. So initial di is 1920 inches.

After moving 100 inches closer, the new di is 1920 - 100 = 1820 inches.

Now, using the lens formula again. The focal length f of the lens must remain the same because it's the same lens.

So initially, 1/f = 1/do_initial + 1/di_initial.

We had do_initial = 1.6 feet = 19.2 inches, di_initial = 1920 inches.

So 1/f = 1/19.2 + 1/1920.

Let me compute that. 1/19.2 is approximately 0.052083333, and 1/1920 is approximately 0.0005208333.

Adding them together, 0.052083333 + 0.0005208333 ≈ 0.052604166.

So 1/f ≈ 0.052604, which means f ≈ 19.027 inches approximately. Let's maybe keep more precise values.

Wait, let me do exact fractions. 19.2 is 96/5 inches. So 1/(96/5) = 5/96.

1920 is 96*20 * 10? Wait, 1920 divided by 96 is 20. So 1920 is 96 * 20. So 1/1920 = 1/(96*20) = (1/96)*(1/20) = (5/480)*(1/20) [Wait, maybe another approach].

So 1/(96/5) = 5/96, and 1/1920 = 1/(96 * 20) = (1/96) * (1/20) = (5/96) * (1/100) ? Hmm, maybe better to compute numerically.

Wait, 5/96 is approximately 0.052083333, and 1/1920 is 0.0005208333.

So 0.052083333 + 0.0005208333 = 0.0526041666... So f is 1/0.0526041666.

Calculating that: 1 / 0.052604166 ≈ around 19.027 inches. Let's say approximately 19.027 inches.

Now, after moving the screen, di_new is 1820 inches. The focal length f is the same, so 1/f = 1/do_new + 1/di_new.

Wait, but I can compute 1/do_new as 1/f - 1/di_new.

So 1/do_new = (1/f) - (1/di_new).

We have 1/f = 0.052604166, and 1/di_new is 1/1820 ≈ 0.00054945.

So 1/do_new = 0.052604166 - 0.00054945 ≈ 0.052054716.

So do_new = 1 / 0.052054716 ≈ approximately 19.22 inches.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 1/0.052054716 = ?

Let me calculate 1 / 0.052054716.

Well, 0.052 is about 19.23 (since 1/0.052 ≈ 19.23).

Wait, let me compute 0.052054716 * 19.22:

0.052054716 * 19.22 = Let's see.

19 * 0.052054716 = 0.989 (approx). 0.22 * 0.052054716 ≈ 0.011411. So total ≈ 1.0004. So 0.052054716 * 19.22 ≈ 1.0004, so 1/0.052054716 ≈ 19.22 inches.

So do_new is approximately 19.22 inches.

Wait, initial do was 19.2 inches, now it's 19.22 inches. So the change is 0.02 inches.

Wait, wait, no. Because the initial do_initial was 19.2 inches, and the new do_new is 19.22 inches. So the slide must be moved from 19.2 to 19.22 inches. So the movement is 0.02 inches. But wait, which direction?

Because when the image distance decreases (the screen moved closer), the object distance must adjust. Hmm. So initially, the object was at do_initial = 19.2 inches. Now, the image is at 1820 inches, so the object is now at 19.22 inches. So the slide needs to be moved a little further away from the lens, by 0.02 inches.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.02 inches. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with units.

Wait, the initial di was 160 feet. 160 feet is 1920 inches. So di_initial = 1920 in. The initial do_initial = di_initial / 100 = 1920 / 100 = 19.2 inches.

Then, after moving the screen 100 inches closer, di_new = 1920 - 100 = 1820 inches.

Now, using the lens formula again.

1/f = 1/do_new + 1/di_new.

We can compute f from the initial setup:

1/f = 1/19.2 + 1/1920.

Compute 1/19.2 and 1/1920.

1/19.2 = 5/96 = approximately 0.052083333.

1/1920 ≈ 0.0005208333.

Adding them gives 0.052604166.

So f = 1 / 0.052604166 ≈ 19.027 inches.

Now, with di_new = 1820 inches:

1/do_new = 1/f - 1/di_new.

1/f = 0.052604166, 1/di_new = 1/1820 ≈ 0.00054945.

So 1/do_new = 0.052604166 - 0.00054945 = 0.052054716.

do_new = 1 / 0.052054716 ≈ 19.22 inches.

So the change in do is 19.22 - 19.2 = 0.02 inches. So the slide needs to be moved 0.02 inches further away from the lens.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.02 inches. So the answer is D.

To solve the problem, we use the thin lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

where \( f \) is the focal length, \( d_o \) is the object distance, and \( d_i \) is the image distance. The magnification \( m \) is related to the distances by:

\[
m = \frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]

### Step 1: Initial setup
- The image is 100 times larger than the object, so \( m = 100 \), and \( d_i = 100 \cdot d_o \).
- The screen is initially 160 feet away, which is \( d_i = 1920 \, \text{inches} \) (since \( 1 \, \text{foot} = 12 \, \text{inches} \)).
- Using \( d_i = 100 \cdot d_o \), the initial object distance is:

\[
d_o = \frac{d_i}{100} = \frac{1920}{100} = 19.2 \, \text{inches}.
\]

### Step 2: Focal length calculation
Using the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Substitute \( d_o = 19.2 \, \text{inches} \) and \( d_i = 1920 \, \text{inches} \):

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{19.2} + \frac{1}{1920}
\]

Convert to decimals:

\[
\frac{1}{19.2} \approx 0.052083333, \quad \frac{1}{1920} \approx 0.000520833
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f} \approx 0.052083333 + 0.000520833 = 0.052604166
\]

Thus, the focal length is:

\[
f = \frac{1}{0.052604166} \approx 19.027 \, \text{inches}.
\]

### Step 3: New setup after moving the screen
The screen is moved 100 inches closer, so the new image distance is:

\[
d_i = 1920 - 100 = 1820 \, \text{inches}.
\]

Using the lens formula again:

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Substitute \( f = 19.027 \, \text{inches} \) and \( d_i = 1820 \, \text{inches} \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} = 0.052604166 - \frac{1}{1820}
\]

Calculate \( \frac{1}{1820} \):

\[
\frac{1}{1820} \approx 0.00054945
\]

\[
\frac{1}{d_o} \approx 0.052604166 - 0.00054945 = 0.052054716
\]

Thus, the new object distance is:

\[
d_o = \frac{1}{0.052054716} \approx 19.22 \, \text{inches}.
\]

### Step 4: Change in object distance
The initial object distance was \( d_o = 19.2 \, \text{inches} \), and the new object distance is \( d_o = 19.22 \, \text{inches} \). The slide must be moved:

\[
\Delta d_o = 19.22 - 19.2 = 0.02 \, \text{inches}.
\]

Thus, the lantern slide must be moved **0.02 inches** relative to the lens to keep the image in sharp focus.

### Final Answer:
