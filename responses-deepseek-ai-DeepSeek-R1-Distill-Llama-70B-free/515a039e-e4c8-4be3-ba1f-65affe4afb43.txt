Okay, so I've got this logic question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the antecedent of a conditional proposition. Hmm, I remember that in logic, a conditional statement is usually in the form "If P, then Q," where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. So the antecedent is the part that comes before the "if" or the condition that must be met.

The proposition given is: "The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." Wait, that's a bit more complex than a simple if-then statement. I think "if and only if" makes it a biconditional statement, meaning both directions are true. So it's like saying P if and only if Q, which translates to P → Q and Q → P. But I'm not sure if that affects finding the antecedent.

Let me break down the sentence. The main statement is "The university raises tuition" and the condition is "if, and only if, both the governor approves and the board recommends it." So in logical terms, it's structured as: The university raises tuition ↔ (Governor approves ∧ Board recommends).

Wait, but the question is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition. So I think I need to identify the P in P → Q. But in this case, the structure is a bit different because it's an "if and only if," which is a biconditional. But regardless, the antecedent is typically the part that's the condition. So in a standard conditional, it's the part after "if," but here it's phrased as "if and only if."

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me rephrase the statement. It's saying that the university raises tuition occurs exactly when both the governor approves and the board recommends it. So in logical terms, it's (Gov approves ∧ Board recommends) → (University raises tuition) and vice versa. So the antecedent would be the condition part, which is "both the governor approves and the board recommends it."

But looking at the options, the choices are A to D. Option A is "The university raises tuition," which would be the consequent, not the antecedent. B is "The governor approves of it," and C is "The board recommends it." But the antecedent here is the combination of both B and C, right? Because it's "both...and..." So the antecedent isn't just one of them, but both together.

Wait, but the options don't have an option that combines B and C. The options are individual. So perhaps the correct answer is D: None of the above. Because the antecedent is the entire condition that both must be true, and none of the options A, B, or C capture that.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think again. The statement is "The university raises tuition if and only if (both the governor approves and the board recommends it)." So in terms of P ↔ Q, P is "The university raises tuition," and Q is "both the governor approves and the board recommends it." But the question is about the antecedent of the conditional proposition. So in the conditional (if-then) part, which is part of the biconditional, the antecedent would be Q, right? Because in P ↔ Q, it's (Q → P) and (P → Q). So in each conditional, the antecedent would be the condition. So in the original statement, the antecedent is the condition that both the governor and board must approve.

But the options don't have that as an option. They only have individual parts. So the antecedent isn't any of A, B, or C. So the answer would be D.

Another way to think about it: the antecedent is the part that's the 'if' part. So in "A if and only if B," the antecedent is B. But in this case, B is a compound statement. Since none of the options represent that compound statement, the correct answer is D.

The question asks to identify the antecedent of the conditional proposition: "The university raises tuition if, and only if, both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." 

In logic, the antecedent of a conditional statement is the condition that must be met for the consequent to follow. Here, the statement is a biconditional ("if and only if"), meaning it can be broken down into two implications:  
1. If the university raises tuition, then both the governor approves and the board recommends it.  
2. If both the governor approves and the board recommends it, then the university raises tuition.  

In both cases, the antecedent is the condition: "both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." This is a compound statement requiring both conditions to be true simultaneously.  

Analyzing the options:  
- **A:** "The university raises tuition" is the consequent, not the antecedent.  
- **B:** "The governor approves of it" is only part of the antecedent.  
- **C:** "The board of trustees recommends it" is also only part of the antecedent.  
- **D:** "None of the above" is correct because the antecedent is the compound statement "both the governor approves and the board recommends it," which is not listed as an option.  

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
