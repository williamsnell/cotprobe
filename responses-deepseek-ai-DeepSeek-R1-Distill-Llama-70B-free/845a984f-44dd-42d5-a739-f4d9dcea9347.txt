Question:

A writer sent a four-page synopsis of an idea for a new television series to a Hollywood producer. He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work." She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?

Options:

A: The court will rule that there can be no contract as the writer didn't explicitly state his expectation for compensation for the idea itself.
B: The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.
C: The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.
D: The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.
E: The court will rule that there was a unilateral contract, with the producer obligated to pay only if he used the idea.
F: The court will rule that the writer's case is invalid as there was no written agreement.
G: The court will rule that the producer's assistant lacked the authority to form a contract, and thus, no contract exists.
H: There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.
I: The court will rule that the phone call between the writer and the producer's assistant formed a verbal contract.

Okay, so I've got this legal question about contracts, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the scenario is.

So, a writer sent a four-page synopsis for a TV series idea to a Hollywood producer. He sent it in response to an ad the producer placed in an industry publication looking for new ideas. Then, he had a phone call with the producer's assistant. During that call, the writer mentioned his expectation of compensation. The assistant said, "Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work." She also mentioned she'd go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series with a nearly identical plot and characters. He sued the producer for breach of contract, but the producer claims there was no contract. The question is about how the court would rule.

Hmm. So the main issue here is whether a contract was formed. For a contract to exist, there needs to be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, in some cases, the contract must be in writing, but I don't think that applies here because this is about an idea submission, not something like a sale of goods over a certain amount.

The writer sent the synopsis after seeing an ad. So the ad could be considered an invitation to treat or maybe an offer. But usually, ads are invitations to treat, not offers. But when the writer submitted his synopsis, that might have been an offer. Then, the producer's assistant's response might count as acceptance. But what exactly was accepted?

In the phone call, the writer mentioned expecting compensation, and the assistant said they always pay for a writer's work. So that seems like an agreement on payment. So perhaps there was mutual assent. The assistant's statement could imply that if they use the idea, they'll pay. But is that enough for a contract?

Wait, contracts can be express or implied. Express contracts are where the terms are explicitly stated. Implied contracts are based on the parties' conduct. So here, the writer submitted the idea, the assistant said they pay for writers' work, which might imply that if they use it, they'll pay. So maybe an implied contract exists.

Another point is consideration. The writer provided the synopsis, which is the consideration. The producer's consideration would be the payment if they use the idea. So there's a bargained-for exchange.

Now, the possible options:

Option A says there's no contract because the writer didn't explicitly state compensation for the idea itself. But the assistant did say they pay, so maybe that's enough.

Option B suggests an implied in fact contract based on conduct. That makes sense because the actions and statements imply an agreement.

Option C argues no consideration, but the writer did provide the synopsis, which is consideration.

Option D says it's an express contract because of mutual assent, but I'm not sure if the terms were explicitly agreed upon. The assistant's statement was general.

Option E is a unilateral contract, where the producer pays only if they use the idea. That could be possible, but unilateral contracts are usually where one party makes an offer, and the other's action is the acceptance. Not sure if that fits here.

Option F says no written agreement, but contracts can be oral, so this might not apply.

Option G claims the assistant lacked authority. But if the assistant was acting within their role, like handling submissions, then the producer could be bound.

Option H says too many terms were missing. But courts can sometimes imply terms, especially in implied contracts.

Option I says a verbal contract was formed. That's possible, but the question is about the type of contract.

So, putting it together, the court would likely find an implied contract based on the parties' conduct. The writer submitted the synopsis, the assistant's statement about paying, and the subsequent use of the idea. So Option B seems correct.

The court will likely rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on their conduct. The writer submitted the synopsis in response to the producer's ad, which can be seen as an offer. The producer's assistant's statement that "we always pay for a writer's work" and the subsequent use of the idea imply acceptance and mutual assent. The consideration is present, as the writer provided the synopsis, and the producer's payment would follow if the idea was used. While the contract was not explicitly stated, the parties' actions and communications suggest an implied agreement. Therefore, the court is likely to find that an implied in fact contract existed.
