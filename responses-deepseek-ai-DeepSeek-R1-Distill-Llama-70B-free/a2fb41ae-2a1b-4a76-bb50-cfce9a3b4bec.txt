To determine which option lists the numbers in order from least to greatest, we need to compare the given fractions and decimals. Let's analyze each number:

1. **0.75**: This is a decimal and can be converted to a fraction. 0.75 equals 3/4.
2. **5/6**: This fraction is slightly less than 1. To compare it with others, we'll keep it as is for now.
3. **1/8**: This is a smaller fraction, equivalent to 0.125.
4. **1/3**: This fraction is approximately 0.333.

Now, let's convert all numbers to decimals for easier comparison:
- 0.75 = 0.75
- 5/6 ≈ 0.833
- 1/8 = 0.125
- 1/3 ≈ 0.333

Next, we arrange these decimals in ascending order:
- 0.125 (1/8)
- 0.333 (1/3)
- 0.75 (0.75)
- 0.833 (5/6)

So, the correct order from least to greatest is: **1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6**.

Now, let's check the options to find the one that matches this order:
- **Option B**: 1/8, 1/3, 0.75, 5/6 → This matches our determined order.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.
