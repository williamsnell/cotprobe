Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about three dice being tossed. The numbers obtained are a, b, c, and I need to find the probability that the product abc equals 180. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that when we're dealing with dice, each die has numbers from 1 to 6. So each of a, b, c can be any integer between 1 and 6, inclusive. Now, the total number of possible outcomes when tossing three dice would be 6 * 6 * 6, which is 216. So the denominator of the probability is going to be 216, I think.

The tricky part is figuring out the numerator, which is the number of favorable outcomes where the product a*b*c equals 180. So I need to find all possible ordered triplets (a, b, c) such that when I multiply them, I get 180.

Let me think about the factors of 180. Let's factorize 180 into its prime factors. 180 is 18 * 10, which breaks down further into 2 * 3^2 * 5. So the prime factors are 2, 3, 3, 5. Now, I need to distribute these prime factors among a, b, c, making sure that each of them is between 1 and 6.

Wait, but since a, b, c are each at least 1 and at most 6, their possible values are limited. So I have to find all combinations where the product is 180, but no single die shows a number higher than 6.

Let me think about the possible triplets. One approach is to list all the possible triplets where a, b, c are between 1 and 6, and their product is 180. But that might take a while, so maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, I can think about the possible values each die can take. Since 5 is a prime factor, at least one of the numbers must be 5 because 5 is a prime and can't be formed by multiplying smaller numbers (since 2 and 3 can't make 5). So one of the dice must be 5. That leaves us with the remaining factors: 2 * 3 * 3 = 18. So now I need two numbers whose product is 18, but each can't exceed 6.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify: the product of the three numbers is 180. So if one of them is 5, the product of the other two must be 36 (since 180 /5 =36). So now we have two numbers a and b, each between 1 and 6, such that a*b=36. But wait, the maximum a die can show is 6. So 36 can't be achieved with two dice because 6*6=36, but wait, 6*6 is 36. Oh wait, so a and b could be 6 and 6. So that gives us (5,6,6) as a possible triplet, but the order matters because dice are distinct.

Wait, but 5 can be in any of the three positions. So let's think about all possible permutations.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's consider that if one die is 5, the other two need to multiply to 36. But 36 can be broken down into 6*6, or other factors. Let me list the possible pairs (a, b) where a*b=36, with a and b between 1 and 6.

Possible pairs would be (6,6), because 6*6=36. Are there any other pairs? Let's see: 36 can be 9*4, but 9 is larger than 6, so that's not possible. 12*3—nope, 12 is too big. So the only possible pair is (6,6). So that means that the triplet must include 5, 6, and 6, but in any order.

Wait, but what if the triplet doesn't include 5? That can't be because 180 is divisible by 5, so one of the numbers must be 5. So all triplets must include 5.

So the possible triplets are those where two numbers are 6 and one is 5. Now, how many such ordered triplets are there?

Since the dice are ordered, the number of permutations would be 3 because the 5 can be in any of the three positions. So the possible ordered triplets are (5,6,6), (6,5,6), and (6,6,5). So that's 3 favorable outcomes.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other triplets. Let me think if there's another way to get a product of 180 with three numbers between 1 and 6, without having a 5.

Hmm, 180 factors into 2^2 * 3^2 *5. So without a 5, the product would be missing that prime factor, so it's impossible to get 180 without including a 5. So yes, all triplets must include exactly one 5 and two 6s.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could there be a triplet where one die is 5, another is 6, and the third is another number that's not 6, but their product is 180?

Let me check. Suppose one die is 5, another is 6, and the third is x. Then the product is 5*6*x=30x. We need 30x=180, so x=6. So yes, the third die must be 6. So the only possible triplets are those with 5,6,6 in some order.

So the number of favorable outcomes is 3.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think about other possibilities. For example, what if one die is 5, another is 3, and the third is... Let me compute 5*3*x=15x. 15x=180 so x=12, which is impossible because a die can't show 12. So that's not possible.

What about 5*4*x=20x=180 → x=9, which is too big. So no. 5*2*x=10x=180 → x=18, nope. 5*1*x=5x=180 → x=36, nope.

So yes, the only possible way is when two of the numbers are 6, and the third is 5.

So that gives us 3 favorable ordered triplets.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other triplets where the product is 180 without using two 6s and one 5?

Another approach: Let's list all possible triplets (a, b, c) where a, b, c are between 1 and 6, and their product is 180.

Let me think of the possible factors of 180 and see which can be arranged into triplets.

180 can be factored into 5 * 6 * 6, as before.

Are there any other triplet combinations?

Let me think about 5, 3, 12 → but 12 is too big.

5,4,9 → 9 is too big.

5,2,18 → 18 too big.

5,1,36 → nope.

Alternatively, 6, 5, 6 → as before.

What about 3,5,12 → again, 12 is too big.

Wait, perhaps 5, 3, 12 is invalid. So I think the only triplet possible is 5,6,6 and its permutations.

So the number of favorable outcomes is 3.

So the probability is 3 / 216, which simplifies to 1/72.

Wait, but let me check: 3 divided by 216 is 1/72, yes.

So looking at the options, option F is 1/72.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other possible triplet.

Wait, another thought: 180 can be written as 5 * 6 * 6, but could it also be written as, say, 5 * (some other factors)?

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose one die is 5, and the other two multiply to 36. We thought only 6*6 works, but are there other possibilities?

Wait, 36 can also be 9*4, but 9 is too big for a die. 12*3 is too big. 18*2 is too big. So no, only 6*6.

So yes, the only triplet is 5,6,6 in some order.

So that's 3 favorable cases.

So the probability is 3/216 = 1/72.

So the correct answer should be option F: 1/72.

To determine the probability that the product \(abc = 180\) when three standard dice are tossed, we start by noting that each die can show a number between 1 and 6. The total number of possible outcomes is \(6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216\).

Next, we factorize 180 into its prime factors:  
\[
180 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5
\]  
Since 5 is a prime factor, one of the dice must show a 5. This leaves the product of the other two dice as:  
\[
\frac{180}{5} = 36
\]  
We now need two numbers between 1 and 6 whose product is 36. The only possible pair is (6, 6), as \(6 \times 6 = 36\). Thus, the triplet must include one 5 and two 6s.

The possible ordered triplets are \((5, 6, 6)\), \((6, 5, 6)\), and \((6, 6, 5)\). Since the dice are distinct, there are 3 favorable outcomes.

The probability is therefore:  
\[
\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{216} = \frac{1}{72}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **F: \(\frac{1}{72}\)**.

F
