Question:

Describe the McCollough Effect. How does it support, the theorythat there are colored-line detectors in the human system ?

Options:

A: The McCollough Effect suggests that color and line detection are processed in separate, independent areas of the brain
B: The McCollough Effect reveals that color detection is influenced by motion detectors, not colored-line detectors
C: The McCollough Effect has nothing to do with colored-line detectors
D: The McCollough Effect indicates that color perception is solely dependent on context and lighting
E: The McCollough Effect demonstrates the existence of two complementary systems sensitive to certain colors, providing evidence for the colored-line detectors theory.
F: The McCollough Effect shows a temporal change in color perception, unrelated to any detectors
G: The McCollough Effect is an auditory phenomenon that does not involve color or line detection
H: The McCollough Effect proves the existence of only one system sensitive to color
I: The McCollough Effect supports the theory that color perception is a learned response with no specific detectors involved
J: The McCollough Effect disproves the existence of colored-line detectors

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the McCollough Effect and how it supports the theory of colored-line detectors in the human visual system. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the McCollough Effect is a visual illusion or phenomenon. I think it has something to do with seeing colors after looking at certain patterns for a while. From what I recall, the effect involves alternating black and white lines or something similar, and after staring, you see colored patterns. But wait, more specifically, I think it's about colored lines. Like, if you look at red and black lines for a while, then look at black and white lines, you might see green lines instead. Or maybe it's the other way around.

I think the effect is related to how the brain processes color and line orientation. Now, the question is about colored-line detectors. So, detectors in the visual system that are specialized for detecting lines of certain colors. I remember something about neurons in the visual cortex being tuned to specific orientations and colors. So, maybe the McCollough Effect shows that these detectors are fatigued or adapted after prolonged exposure.

So, the theory is that the human visual system has these detectors that are sensitive to both color and the orientation of lines. When you stare at, say, red vertical lines and green horizontal lines, the detectors for those specific color and line combinations get tired. Then, when you look at a different pattern, like black and white lines, those tired detectors don't respond as much, making you perceive different colors than what's actually there.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this. Let me go through them:

Option A: Says color and line detection are separate. But I thought the effect shows they're connected, so maybe not A.

Option B: Color influenced by motion, not line detectors. Hmm, not sure. McCollough seems more about color and lines, not motion.

Option C: No relation to colored-line detectors. No, the question is about supporting the theory, so C is probably wrong.

Option D: Color perception based solely on context and lighting. I don't think that's it. The effect is more about adaptation in detectors.

Option E: Demonstrates two complementary systems sensitive to certain colors, supporting colored-line detectors. This sounds right. Like, the brain has systems that when fatigued, show the effect, indicating specific detectors.

Option F: Temporal change unrelated to detectors. No, the effect is about detectors being involved.

Option G: Auditory phenomenon. No, it's visual.

Option H: Only one system sensitive to color. Doesn't fit with two complementary systems idea.

Option I: Learned response, no detectors. No, the effect is about physiological detectors, not learning.

Option J: Disproves colored-line detectors. Opposite of what the question is asking.

So, the correct answer must be E. The McCollough Effect shows that there are detectors sensitive to specific colors and lines, and when they're adapted, the perception changes, which supports the theory of colored-line detectors.

The McCollough Effect is a visual phenomenon where prolonged exposure to colored lines (e.g., red vertical and green horizontal lines) leads to altered color perception when viewing black and white lines afterward. This effect supports the theory that the human visual system contains specialized detectors sensitive to both color and line orientation. These detectors become fatigued after extended stimulation, altering perception. The effect demonstrates the existence of two complementary systems sensitive to specific colors, providing evidence for the presence of colored-line detectors.

The correct answer is **E**.
