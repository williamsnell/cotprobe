Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about aggregate demand and aggregate supply in the short run. Hmm, I remember that aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) are key concepts in macroeconomics.

The question says that both the short-run aggregate supply and aggregate demand increase. I need to determine what happens to the price level and real GDP for certain. The options are from A to J, each giving different outcomes.

Alright, let's think. I remember that in the short run, the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, while the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping. When both AS and AD shift, the effects on price and GDP depend on how much each shifts.

If both AS and AD increase, let's imagine the graph. Suppose AD shifts to the right and AS also shifts to the right. Where they intersect will determine the new equilibrium. Now, if both shift right, the new equilibrium could vary. The price level might go up, down, or stay the same, depending on the shifts.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let's think again. If AD increases, it tends to increase both GDP and the price level because a higher AD means more spending, which drives up prices and production. Similarly, if AS increases, that means businesses can produce more at every price level. So an increase in AS would lower the price level (since more supply at same price) and increase GDP.

But when both happen, their effects can oppose each other. For example, AD increasing tends to increase prices, while AS increasing tends to decrease prices. So the overall effect on the price level isn't certain. It depends on which shift is stronger. If AD increases more, prices might rise. If AS increases more, prices might fall.

What about real GDP? AD increasing leads to higher GDP because more demand means more production to meet that demand. AS increasing also leads to higher GDP because the economy can produce more. So regardless of the shifts, if both AD and AS increase, real GDP should increase. Because both shifts are pushing GDP up.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Aggregate demand is the total spending in the economy, so if it increases, businesses produce more, so GDP goes up. Aggregate supply is the total production, so if that increases, the economy's capacity to produce increases, leading to higher GDP. So in both cases, whether AD or AS increases, real GDP goes up, assuming the other doesn't decrease.

So in this scenario, both AD and AS are increasing, so their combined effect on GDP is an increase. But for the price level, it's uncertain because the AD shift would push prices up, and AS shift would push them down. So the price could go up, down, or stay the same depending on the magnitude of each shift.

So looking at the options, the correct answer should say that real GDP rises, but the change in the price level is uncertain. Let's look at the options again.

Option I says, "Real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain." That sounds right. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option B: Price rises, GDP uncertain. No, because GDP should definitely rise.
Option C: Price falls, GDP uncertain. Again, GDP should rise.
Option I is the only one where GDP rises and price change is uncertain. So the answer should be I.

When both short-run aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase, the effects on the economy can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Aggregate Demand (AD) Increase**: A rise in AD leads to higher total spending in the economy, which tends to increase both the price level and real GDP. As households and businesses spend more, businesses produce more to meet the higher demand.

2. **Aggregate Supply (AS) Increase**: A rise in AS means businesses can produce more at every price level, which tends to lower the price level and increase real GDP. An increase in AS reflects greater productivity or lower production costs.

3. **Combined Effect**: When both AD and AS increase, the impact on real GDP is clearâ€”both shifts lead to an increase in real GDP. However, the effect on the price level is uncertain because the AD increase tends to raise prices, while the AS increase tends to lower prices. The final outcome for the price level depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts in AD and AS.

Given this analysis, the correct answer is the option that states real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.

**Answer: I**
