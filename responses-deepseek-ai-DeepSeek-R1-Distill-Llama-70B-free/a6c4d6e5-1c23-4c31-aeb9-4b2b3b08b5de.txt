Alright, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about urban geography theories. The question is asking which theorist proposed that cities grow outward from a core using several nodes of growth. The options are A through J, each corresponding to a different theorist.

First, I'll try to remember what each of these theorists is known for. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Christaller. I think Christaller is associated with the Central Place Theory. His model focuses on the hierarchy of cities based on their size and the services they provide. So it's more about the distribution and spacing of towns rather than the outward growth from a core with nodes.

Option B: Ravenstein. Ravenstein is known for his work on migration patterns, specifically the laws of migration. Not directly related to city growth patterns in this context.

Option C: Hotelling. Hotelling's theory is about economic competition and how businesses locate themselves. His model involves the idea of spatial competition, like the Hotelling's law or the principle of minimum differentiation. Doesn't seem to fit the question about city growth nodes.

Option D: Hoyt. Hoyt's theory comes to mind as the sector model or the Hoyt model. He proposed that cities grow in sectors or wedges extending outward from the central business district, influenced by transportation routes and social factors. This seems closer to the idea of nodes of growth.

Option E: Burgess. Burgess is known for the concentric zone model. He described cities as growing outward in concentric rings, with the central business district at the core, surrounded by zones like the transition zone, working-class residences, etc. This model doesn't specifically mention nodes of growth, so maybe not the right answer.

Option F: Losch. Losch built on Christaller's work with his own theory of the economic locations. He focused on the arrangement of economic activities in space, but again, more about the distribution and less about outward growth nodes.

Option G: Weber. Weber's work is on industrial location theory, explaining where industries locate based on transportation and resource costs. Not directly about city growth from a core with nodes.

Option H: von Th端nen. Von Th端nen's model is the Isolated State theory, which explains the spatial distribution of agricultural land uses around a city. It's about rings of different land uses around a central city, but not about nodes of growth.

Option I: Harris and Ullmann. They proposed the multiple nuclei model. This theory suggests that cities develop around multiple nuclei or nodes of growth, such as industrial areas or commercial centers, rather than a single central business district. This sounds exactly like what the question is describing.

Option J: Rostow. Rostow is an economist known for his stages of economic growth model, not related to urban geography theories.

Wait, so the question is about growth from a core using several nodes. So the multiple nuclei model (Harris and Ullmann) fits because it's about growth around multiple nuclei. But earlier I thought Hoyt's sector model was about sectors extending from the core. Which one uses nodes?

In the multiple nuclei model, growth occurs around different nuclei, which can be various centers like industrial parks, shopping centers, etc. So the city doesn't grow uniformly from a single core but from multiple points. So the correct answer might be I.

Wait but the question says 'outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth'. So perhaps they're referring to a model where the city has a core but grows outward using multiple nodes. That sounds like the multiple nuclei model because it's about multiple cores or nuclei. Alternatively, maybe it's the sector model which has sectors (like transportation lines) leading out from the core, but each sector is a node of growth.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The multiple nuclei model (Harris and Ullman) suggests that a city may develop around several centers rather than a single central business district. So growth can occur around these multiple nodes, which are spread out. In contrast, Hoyt's sector model has growth along specific sectors or transportation corridors extending from the core, but each sector might be considered a node.

Wait, so the question says the city uses several nodes of growth. So in the multiple nuclei model, the nodes are separate centers, while in the sector model, the nodes are along lines extending from the core.

I'm a bit torn between D (Hoyt) and I (Harris and Ullmann). The question's wording mentions "several nodes of growth". The multiple nuclei model explicitly uses multiple nuclei as the nodes. So the correct answer would be I.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the idea that cities expand from a core with multiple nodes, which sounds more like the multiple nuclei model. So I think the answer is I: Harris and Ullmann.

The question asks which theorist proposed that cities grow outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth. To determine the correct answer, it is important to analyze the contributions of each theorist:

- **Christaller (A):** Known for the Central Place Theory, which focuses on the hierarchy and distribution of cities based on services, not outward growth from a core with nodes.  
- **Ravenstein (B):** Associated with migration patterns, unrelated to city growth models.  
- **Hotelling (C):** Focuses on spatial competition and economic location, not city growth.  
- **Hoyt (D):** Proposed the sector model, where cities grow in sectors or wedges from the core, influenced by transportation and social factors. While this involves growth from the core, it does not explicitly emphasize "nodes of growth."  
- **Burgess (E):** Known for the concentric zone model, which describes cities growing outward in rings around the central business district, not nodes.  
- **Losch (F):** Expanded on Christaller's work, focusing on economic locations and distribution, not outward growth with nodes.  
- **Weber (G):** Focuses on industrial location theory, unrelated to city growth models.  
- **von Th端nen (H):** Proposed the Isolated State theory, describing agricultural land use around a city, not urban growth nodes.  
- **Harris and Ullmann (I):** Introduced the multiple nuclei model, which describes cities growing around several nodes or nuclei, such as industrial or commercial centers, rather than a single core. This aligns with the idea of growth from a core utilizing several nodes.  
- **Rostow (J):** Known for stages of economic growth, unrelated to urban geography.

The multiple nuclei model (Harris and Ullmann) explicitly describes city growth around several nodes, making it the most fitting answer. While Hoyt's sector model involves growth from the core, it does not emphasize nodes in the same way. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: Harris and Ullmann.**
