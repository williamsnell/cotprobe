Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about assessing power in the arms. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question is about the MRC scale, muscles, and their functions related to the arms. I'm a bit rusty on some of these details, but I'll try to think it through.

Option A: Extension at the elbow is produced by the biceps muscle. Wait, I remember that the biceps is responsible for flexion, not extension. The triceps does extension. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Grade 3/5 represents movement only when gravity is eliminated. I think the MRC scale goes like this: Grade 0 is no movement, 1 is a flicker, 2 is movement with gravity eliminated, 3 is movement against gravity but not resistance, 4 is movement against resistance, and 5 is normal. So B says 3/5 is with gravity eliminated, but I thought that's grade 2. So B is wrong.

Option C: Grade 2/5 is movement only against gravity. No, wait, grade 2 is when you can move only if gravity is eliminated. So C says against gravity, which would be grade 3. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Brachioradialis is responsible for shoulder abduction. No, brachioradialis is a forearm muscle, mainly involved in flexion when the forearm is in a mid-prone position. Shoulder abduction is done by the deltoid, so D is wrong.

Option E: Grade 0/5 is full range with resistance. No, grade 0 is no movement at all. E is incorrect.

Option F: Root value of shoulder abduction is C5. Wait, I recall that the deltoid muscle is innervated by the axillary nerve, which is from C5 and C6. So the root value for shoulder abduction would be C5, I think. So F might be correct.

Option G: Flexion at the elbow by triceps. No, triceps do extension. Flexion is done by biceps and brachioradialis. So G is wrong.

Option H: Grade 5/5 is movement only when gravity eliminated. No, grade 5 is normal strength against gravity and resistance. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Root value of shoulder abduction is C7. Wait, no, that's not right. Axillary nerve is C5, so I must be wrong. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Grade 1/5 is no movement or contraction. No, grade 1 is a flicker or trace of contraction, but no movement. So J is correct because grade 1 is 'some contraction' but no movement, but wait, what's the exact definition? Grade 0 is no contraction, 1 is a flicker. So J says 'no movement or contraction'â€”that's grade 0. Oh wait, no, J says grade 1 represents no movement or contraction. Which is incorrect because grade 1 is a flicker. So J is wrong.

Wait, so going back. Let's recap:

The MRC scale:

0: No movement or contraction.

1: Flicker or trace of contraction, no movement.

2: Movement possible only if gravity is eliminated (e.g., lifting on the plane, but not against gravity).

3: Movement against gravity, but not against resistance.

4: Movement against resistance with less than normal strength.

5: Normal strength.

So looking at the options again.

Option F: Root value of shoulder abduction is C5. Correct, because deltoid is C5.

Option J: Grade 1/5 is no movement or contraction. No, that's grade 0. So J is wrong.

So correct options are F and maybe J is wrong. Let me check the other options again.

Option B: 3/5 is movement when gravity is eliminated. No, 3/5 is against gravity. So B is wrong.

So the correct answers are F and J? Wait, no. The question asks which is true, so only one option is correct.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option F: The root value of shoulder abduction is C5. Yes, that's correct because the deltoid is innervated by C5.

Another option is J: Grade 1/5 is no movement or contraction. Which is wrong, because grade 1 is 'some contraction, but no movement'. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be F and maybe another option. Wait, what's option I? I says the root value is C7. No, that's for other muscles, like the median nerve muscles perhaps.

So the correct answer is option F: The root value of shoulder abduction is C5.

Wait, but wait another thing: the root value for shoulder abduction. The deltoid is primarily responsible, and its innervation is from the axillary nerve, which comes from C5 and C6. So the root value is C5 because if C5 is damaged, shoulder abduction is impaired. So yes, F is correct.

Wait, but I also thought about option J. Let me recheck. Option J: Grade 1/5 power represents no movement or muscle contraction.

No, that's grade 0. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer is F and perhaps another option.

Wait, looking back. The question asks which is true. Are there other correct options?

Option J is incorrect.

So only F and J are candidates, but J is wrong. So only F is correct.

Wait, but let me check another option. Option B says 3/5 represents movement only when gravity is eliminated. I thought 3/5 is movement against gravity. So B is wrong.

So the correct answer is F.

To determine which statement is true regarding the assessment of power in the arms, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Extension at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle, not the biceps. The biceps is responsible for flexion.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Grade 3/5 on the MRC scale represents movement against gravity but not against resistance. It does not require gravity to be eliminated.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Grade 2/5 represents movement only when gravity is eliminated, not against gravity. Movement against gravity corresponds to Grade 3/5.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The brachioradialis muscle is primarily involved in forearm flexion, not shoulder abduction. Shoulder abduction is performed by the deltoid muscle.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Grade 0/5 represents no movement or muscle contraction, not full range of motion with resistance.
- **Option F**: Correct. The root value of shoulder abduction is C5 because the deltoid muscle, which performs this action, is innervated by the axillary nerve (C5).
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Flexion at the elbow is produced by the biceps and brachioradialis muscles, not the triceps. The triceps is responsible for extension.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Grade 5/5 represents normal strength, with movement possible against gravity and resistance. It does not require gravity to be eliminated.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The root value of shoulder abduction is C5, not C7. C7 is associated with other muscle groups.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Grade 1/5 represents a flicker or trace of muscle contraction, but no movement. It does not represent "no movement or muscle contraction," which corresponds to Grade 0/5.

The correct answer is **Option F**, as it accurately states that the root value of shoulder abduction is C5. 

**Answer: F**
