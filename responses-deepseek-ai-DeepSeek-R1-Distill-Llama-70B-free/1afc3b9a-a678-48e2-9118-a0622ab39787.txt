Okay, so I have this question about Islamic history, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is, "Who declared Muhammad a prophet?" The options are A through J, each being a different name. I'm a bit rusty on my Islamic history, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that Muhammad received his first revelation through the Angel Gabriel. I think that's when he was in the Cave of Hira, right? So Gabriel is the one who told him he was a prophet. But wait, the question is asking who declared him a prophet. Does that mean the person who recognized or announced it first among humans?

Wait, no, the declaration would come from the divine, right? So maybe the answer is Gabriel, but looking at the options, I see that option I is Gabriel. So that might be the answer. But let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's someone else. I remember that Khadijah, Muhammad's wife, was the first person to believe in him. She was supportive and perhaps the first to recognize him as a prophet. So option C is Khadijah. But wait, did she declare him a prophet, or did she just believe in him?

Another thought: when Muhammad received the revelation, he was unsure at first, and it was Khadijah who took him to her cousin Waraqah, who was a Christian and knew the scriptures. Waraqah confirmed that Muhammad was indeed the prophet. So option F is Waraqah. But did Waraqah declare him a prophet, or just confirm it to Muhammad and Khadijah?

Hmm, the question is about who declared Muhammad a prophet. So if Waraqah told them that he was the prophet, maybe that's the declaration. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another angle: in Islamic belief, it's Allah who appoints prophets through His messengers. So Gabriel, being the messenger, would have declared Muhammad a prophet by delivering the revelation. So that would make option I the correct answer.

But I'm a bit confused because the first people to recognize him as a prophet were Khadijah and maybe Waraqah. But the actual declaration from the divine side would be Gabriel. So the answer should be I: Gabriel.

Wait, but sometimes in religious contexts, the declaration is considered to be from the divine, so the angel is the one who brings the message. So yes, Gabriel declared Muhammad a prophet.

Alternatively, if the question is about who among the people first recognized him, then it would be Khadijah or Waraqah. But I think the question is more about the divine declaration, so Gabriel is the one.

So I think the answer is I: Gabriel.

The question asks who declared Muhammad a prophet. Considering Islamic beliefs, the divine declaration comes through the Angel Gabriel, who delivered the revelation to Muhammad in the Cave of Hira. While Khadijah was the first human to believe in him and Waraqah confirmed his prophethood, the actual divine declaration was through Gabriel. 

Answer: I
