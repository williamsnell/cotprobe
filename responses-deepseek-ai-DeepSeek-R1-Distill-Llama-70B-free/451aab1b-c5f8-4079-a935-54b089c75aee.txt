Okay, so I have this question about what psychology is, and I need to choose the right answer from options A to J. Let me think through this step by step.

I remember that psychology is a social science, right? It's about understanding people, their behaviors, and their minds. So the question is asking for a definition, and I need to pick the best option.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's about the legal system and its effects. Hmm, that sounds more like criminology or sociology, maybe? Not sure, but I don't think psychology is mainly about the legal system.

Option B is the study of the behavior of living organisms. That's broader, including humans and animals. I've heard that psychology does look at behavior, but isn't it more specific to humans? Or does it include other animals too? I think some areas of psychology, like comparative psychology, do study animal behavior, so B might be a possibility.

Option C is about human interaction. That sounds more like sociology or maybe social psychology. Psychology does cover interactions, but is that the whole picture? I think psychology is more than just interactions between people.

Option D is about chemical processes in a lab. That sounds like chemistry or maybe biochemistry. Not psychology. Unless it's referring to biological psychology, but even then, it's not just lab chemicals.

Option E is plant life. That's botany. Definitely not psychology.

Option F is the study of the mind. I've heard that before. Psychology is often called the study of the mind, but wait, isn't it also about behavior? I remember hearing that psychology is both the study of the mind and behavior.

Option G says it's the science of behavior. That rings a bell. I think the formal definition includes behavior. So psychology is a science that studies behavior and mental processes.

Option H is about historical events. That's history, not psychology.

Option I is planetary systems, so that's astronomy.

Option J is about the physical body. That's more like biology or physiology. Although health psychology might touch on the body, the overall field isn't just that.

So narrowing it down, I'm between B, F, and G.

Option B says living organisms' behavior. Psychology does include humans and sometimes animals, so that's accurate.

Option F is about the mind. But I think the definition is more comprehensive than that. Because psychology includes both the mind (thoughts, feelings) and behavior.

Option G says it's the science of behavior. Wait, but doesn't that leave out the mind part? Or is behavior considered to include both observable actions and mental processes?

Wait, I think the formal definition of psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. So G says science of behavior, but maybe it's a bit narrow. Alternatively, F is about the mind, which is also part of it.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Some sources define psychology as the study of behavior and mental processes, others as the study of the mind. But looking at the options, which one fits best.

Option G: "the science of behavior." That's a common way to describe it. Another option is F: "study of the mind." But I think the more accurate and broader definition includes both behavior and mental processes, so perhaps G is better because it's about behavior, and F is only about the mind.

Wait, no, the question is asking for "what is psychology?" and the options are each a single statement. So which one is correct.

I think the correct answer is that psychology is the science of behavior, which would be option G. Or is it option B, which is behavior of living organisms?

Wait, option B says "study of the behavior of living organisms." That's broader and includes all behaviors, including animals. Psychology does include the study of animal behavior, but it's more focused on humans. So perhaps B is correct as well.

Alternatively, I remember that William James described psychology as the science of mental life, which would align more with option F. But modern psychology includes both mind and behavior.

Wait, another angle: the formal definition. Psychology is often defined as the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. So which option aligns with that?

Option G: "the science of behavior" covers the behavior part but not the mental processes. Option F is about the mind, which covers the mental part but not behavior.

Hmm, the options don't have a perfect fit. But perhaps the question is using a more general approach. Let me think about common course descriptions.

In introductory psych classes, they often say that psychology is the study of behavior and mental processes. But the options don't have that exact wording. So looking for the closest match.

Option G says "the science of behavior." So that covers one part. Option F is "the study of the mind," which covers the other. But which one is more correct as an overall definition.

Alternatively, another approach: looking for the options that are definitely incorrect.

Option A is about the legal system—no. Option C is about human interaction—more specific than psychology. Option D is chemistry—no. E is plants—no. H is history—no. I is astronomy—no. J is physical body—no.

So options left are B, F, G.

Option B: behavior of living organisms. That's a broad statement, including all animals. So if psychology includes animal behavior studies, then B is correct. But if the question is more about the general definition, maybe G is better.

Wait, what do I know about the options:

Option B is broader, including all living organisms. So if the question is about the study of behavior in all living beings, then B would be correct. But psychology primarily focuses on humans, though some areas do look at animals.

Option G is "the science of behavior." Since psychology is a science, and it studies behavior, that seems accurate. It doesn't mention mental processes, but perhaps the question is simplifying it.

I think the correct answer is G: Psychology is the science of behavior. Or maybe F: the study of the mind. Wait, I'm a bit split.

Wait, I think the most accurate among the options is G. Because the formal definition is the science of behavior and mental processes, but since the options don't include both, G is more encompassing as it's about behavior, which includes observable actions, and sometimes mental processes are inferred from behavior.

Alternatively, some textbooks define psychology as the study of behavior and mental processes. But given the options, G seems correct.

Wait, another approach: the word "behavior." Option B is about behavior of living organisms, which is correct, but perhaps too broad. Option G is the science of behavior, which is more precise and aligns with the discipline's status as a science.

So I think the answer is G.

Psychology is a social science that seeks to understand individuals and their behaviors through the study of mental processes and observable actions. Among the provided options, several are considered:

- **Option A** refers to the legal system, which is more relevant to criminology or sociology.
- **Option B** mentions the behavior of living organisms, which is accurate but overly broad, as psychology primarily focuses on humans, though it can include animals.
- **Option C** focuses on human interaction, which aligns more with sociology or social psychology.
- **Option D** refers to chemical processes, which pertains to chemistry or biochemistry.
- **Option E** is about plant life, which is botany.
- **Option F** defines psychology as the study of the mind, which is partially correct but incomplete, as psychology also encompasses behavior.
- **Option G** describes psychology as the science of behavior, which aligns well with the discipline's focus on observable actions and its status as a science.
- **Option H** refers to historical events, which is history.
- **Option I** is about planetary systems, which is astronomy.
- **Option J** focuses on the physical body, which is biology or physiology.

The most accurate and comprehensive definition among the options is **Option G**, as it captures the scientific study of behavior, which is central to psychology. While the field also includes mental processes, the term "science of behavior" is a concise and fitting description.

Answer: G
