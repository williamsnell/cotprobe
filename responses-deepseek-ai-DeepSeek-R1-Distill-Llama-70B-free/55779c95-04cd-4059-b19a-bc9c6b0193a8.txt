Okay, so I have this question about comparing the ionic bond strength of NaCl and KF. Hmm, I remember that ionic bond strength is related to the lattice energy of the ionic compound. The higher the lattice energy, the stronger the bond.

Wait, right, lattice energy depends on the charges of the ions and the size of the ions. The formula I think is something like lattice energy proportional to (charge of cation * charge of anion) divided by the sum of their ionic radii. Oh wait, no, the actual formula is more precise. The lattice energy (U) can be estimated using the Born-Lande equation or the Kapustinskii equation, but for a quick comparison, we can use U proportional to (Z+ * Z-)/(r+ + r-), where Z is the charge and r is the radius.

So both NaCl and KF are 1:1 salts. NaCl is Na+ and Cl-; KF is K+ and F-. The charges are the same: Na+ is +1, Cl- is -1, same for K+ and F-. So the charge product is the same (1*1=1) for both.

So the main factor here is the sum of the ionic radii. The smaller the sum, the higher the lattice energy because the ions are closer together, leading to a stronger bond.

Looking at the given radii: Na+ is 0.097 nm, Cl- is 0.181 nm. So NaCl's sum is 0.097 + 0.181 = 0.278 nm.

For KF: K+ is 0.133, F- is 0.133. Sum is 0.133 + 0.133 = 0.266 nm.

Oh wait, because 0.266 is smaller than 0.278, the lattice energy for KF should be higher than NaCl. So the bond strength of KF is stronger than NaCl.

But the question is asking for the percentage of NaCl's bond strength compared to KF. So I need to calculate which is stronger, then find what percent NaCl is of KF.

Since KF has a smaller sum of radii, its lattice energy is higher. So KF is stronger. So the bond strength of NaCl is (NaCl's U) divided by (KF's U) times 100.

Given that U is inversely proportional to (r+ + r-), because U = k * (Z+Z-)/(r+ + r-), and since Z is the same for both, we can say U ∝ 1/(r_sum).

So U_NaCl = k/(0.278)
U_KF = k/(0.266)

So the ratio U_NaCl / U_KF = (0.266)/(0.278) ≈ 0.9568.

So that's about 95.68% of KF's strength. Looking at the options, the closest is option I:96.2%, but wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 0.266 / 0.278 more precisely.

0.266 divided by 0.278:

Well, 0.278 is 278 in thousandths. Let's compute 266 / 278.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 133/139.

What is 133 ÷ 139?

139 × 0.95 = 132.05. Because 139 *0.9=125.1, 0.95=132.05.

133 is 0.95 of 139. 133 is 0.95 something... 0.95 is 132.05, so 133 is 0.95 + (0.95/139) ?

Wait, maybe use a calculator approach.

Compute 133 ÷ 139.

I can write this as 133 ÷ 139 ≈ ?

Let me compute 139 × 0.956: 139 *0.9=125.1, 0.05*139=6.95, 0.006*139=0.834. So 125.1 +6.95=132.05, +0.834=132.884. That's 0.956 gives 132.884, which is less than 133. So 0.956 gives ~132.884. The difference is 133 -132.884=0.116. So how much more than 0.956?

Each 0.001 increase adds 0.139 to the product. So 0.116 /0.139 ≈ 0.835 of 0.001. So approximately 0.956 +0.000835 ≈0.9568.

So 0.9568, which is 95.68%. So about 95.7%.

Looking at the options: let's see which is close.

Option C is 97.5% : higher than our value. Option I is 96.2%, which is about 0.5% higher than our calculation. Option H is 94.8%, which is lower. Option G is 95.6%, which is 95.6—close.

Wait, 95.68 is approximately 95.7. The options are:

A:88.4%

B:90.6%

C:97.5%

D:87.9%

E:89.5%

F:92.3%

G:95.6%

H:94.8%

I:96.2%

J:93.7%

So 95.7 is closest to option G (95.6%) and I (96.2%). Hmm. 0.1% difference. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me redo the division. Maybe I did it wrong.

Compute 266/278.

Wait wait, no: the sum for NaCl is 0.097 + 0.181 = 0.278.

KF sum is 0.133 + 0.133 = 0.266.

So the ratio is 0.266/0.278 = ?

Wait no, U is proportional to 1/(sum), so for NaCl, U is 1/0.278, for KF it's 1/0.266.

So the ratio of U_NaCl to U_KF is (1/0.278)/(1/0.266) ) = 0.266 /0.278.

So 266/278 = 0.9568… 95.68%.

Looking again, option I is 96.2, which is about 0.5% higher. Option G is 95.6, 0.08% less. Wait, 95.68 is closer to 95.7, so 95.6 is 0.08% less, 96.2 is 0.52% higher. So which is closer? 0.08 off vs 0.52. So 95.6 is closer.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider whether the ionic charges are the same. Both have 1:1 charges, so the charge product is same. So it's correct to compare based on the sum of the radii.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the actual formula with constants, but I don't think the problem expects that. The question is a comparison, so the proportional approach should suffice.

Therefore, the bond strength of NaCl is approximately 95.7% of KF's. The closest option is G:95.6% or I:96.2%.

Wait, the options don't have 95.7, but option G is 95.6, which is 0.1% less. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the charge consideration. Wait, no, both are 1:1.

Wait another thought: perhaps the lattice energy also depends on the charges, but in this case both have same product (1*1=1). So the only variable is the sum of radii.

So the calculation remains as 0.266/0.278 = approximately 95.68%.

Looking at the options, the closest is either G (95.6) or I (96.2). The actual value is 95.68, which is 95.7. So the options don't have 95.7, but perhaps the given options require a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 266 divided by 278 more precisely.

Let me compute 266 ÷ 278.

Let me write it as 266 ÷ 278.

But 278 is larger than 266, so it's 0. something.

Compute 266 ÷ 278:

278 goes into 266 zero times. Add a decimal point, and consider 2660 ÷ 278.

How many times does 278 go into 2660?

Let me compute 278 *9 = 2502. 278*9=2502.

2502 from 2660 leaves 158.

Bring down a zero: 1580.

278 *5=1390. Subtract from 1580: 190.

Bring down a zero: 1900.

278 *6=1668. 1900-1668=232.

Bring down a zero: 2320.

278*8=2224. 2320-2224=96.

Bring down a zero: 960.

278*3=834. 960-834=126.

Bring down a zero: 1260.

278*4=1112. 1260-1112=148.

Bring down a zero:1480.

278*5=1390. 1480-1390=90.

So putting it all together: 0.9568... So 0.9568 approximately 0.9568, which is 95.68%.

So 95.68% is the percentage. So the closest option is G:95.6% (95.6) or I:96.2 (96.2). 95.68 is closer to 95.6 (difference of 0.08) than to 96.2 (difference of 0.52). So the correct answer would be G:95.6%.

Wait, but wait, let me check again: 0.266 divided by 0.278.

Wait, now I'm a bit confused. Because 0.266 is the sum for KF, and 0.278 is NaCl's sum.

So U_NaCl is proportional to 1/0.278, U_KF is 1/0.266.

The ratio is (1/0.278)/(1/0.266) )= 0.266/0.278 ≈ 0.9568.

So NaCl's bond strength is 95.68% of KF's.

Looking at the options:

G is 95.6%, which is 0.08% less than 95.68.

I is 96.2%, which is 0.52% higher.

So 95.68 is closer to 95.6 than 96.2, so the correct option is G (95.6%).

Wait, but wait, looking back, the problem statement says "the ionic bond strength of NaCl to KF". So NaCl's strength is X% of KF's. So 95.68%. The options are A through J, and option G is 95.6%, which is 0.08% less.

Alternatively, perhaps I should invert something. Wait, no, because KF has a smaller sum, so higher U. So NaCl's U is 95.68% of KF's.

So which option is 95.6%? Option G.

But wait, some sources mention that bond strength is sometimes expressed as the lattice energy, which would have other factors, like the Born exponent, but I think that's beyond the scope here. The question gives the radii and expects a simple comparison.
</think>

To compare the ionic bond strength of NaCl and KF, we use the relationship between lattice energy (U) and ionic radii. Lattice energy is inversely proportional to the sum of the ionic radii, as \( U \propto \frac{1}{r_{\text{sum}}} \), where \( r_{\text{sum}} = r_+ + r_- \). Since both compounds are 1:1 salts with identical charges (\( Z_+ \cdot Z_- = 1 \)), the difference in bond strength arises from the difference in \( r_{\text{sum}} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( r_{\text{sum}} \) for NaCl and KF
- For NaCl: \( r_{\text{Na}^+} = 0.097 \, \text{nm}, \, r_{\text{Cl}^-} = 0.181 \, \text{nm} \)
  \[
  r_{\text{sum, NaCl}} = 0.097 + 0.181 = 0.278 \, \text{nm}
  \]
- For KF: \( r_{\text{K}^+} = 0.133 \, \text{nm}, \, r_{\text{F}^-} = 0.133 \, \text{nm} \)
  \[
  r_{\text{sum, KF}} = 0.133 + 0.133 = 0.266 \, \text{nm}
  \]

### Step 2: Compare bond strengths
Since \( U \propto \frac{1}{r_{\text{sum}}} \), the ratio of bond strengths is:
\[
\frac{U_{\text{NaCl}}}{U_{\text{KF}}} = \frac{r_{\text{sum, KF}}}{r_{\text{sum, NaCl}}} = \frac{0.266}{0.278}
\]
Performing the division:
\[
\frac{0.266}{0.278} \approx 0.9568 \, \text{or} \, 95.68\%
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of 95.68% is closest to **95.6%** (Option G). While 96.2% (Option I) is also nearby, 95.6% is only 0.08% less than 95.68%, making it the most accurate choice.

### Final Answer
G: 95.6%  
\boxed{G}
