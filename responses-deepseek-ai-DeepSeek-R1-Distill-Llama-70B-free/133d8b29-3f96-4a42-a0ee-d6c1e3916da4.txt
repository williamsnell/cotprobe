Question:

Joe Troy purchased a chain saw for $1,200 for his lumber mill. The saw will last 6 years and have no residual value. Mr. Troy wishes to use the straight-line method of depreciation. Find the depreciation and book value for the first two years.

Options:

A: $350 per year, $850 after first year, $500 after second year
B: $100 per year, $1100 after first year, $1000 after second year
C: $400 per year, $800 after first year, $400 after second year
D: $250 per year, $950 after first year, $700 after second year
E: $600 per year, $600 after first year, $0 after second year
F: $500 per year, $700 after first year, $200 after second year
G: $150 per year, $1050 after first year, $900 after second year
H: $200 per year, $1000 after first year, $800 after second year
I: $300 per year, $900 after first year, $600 after second year
J: $450 per year, $750 after first year, $300 after second year

Okay, so I have this question about depreciation, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Joe Troy bought a chainsaw for $1,200 for his lumber mill. It's going to last 6 years and have no residual value. He wants to use the straight-line method. I need to find the depreciation and book value for the first two years.

Hmm, straight-line depreciation. I remember that's where you spread the cost evenly over the useful life. So, no residual value means that the asset is fully depreciated at the end. 

The formula for straight-line depreciation is (Cost - Residual Value) / Useful Life. Since residual is zero, it's just 1200 divided by 6. Let me calculate that. 1200 / 6 equals 200. So each year, the depreciation is $200.

Wait, but the options don't all have $200 as the first part. Let me check the options again. Option H says $200 per year, which matches. Let's look at the book value after each year.

Book value after the first year would be the initial cost minus depreciation for the first year. So 1200 - 200 = 1000. Then after the second year, another 200 depreciation, so 1000 - 200 = 800. 

Looking at option H: $200 per year, first book value $1000, second $800. Yep, that matches. 

Wait, are there any other options that have $200? Let me quickly glance. Option G has $150, so no. Option I is $300. So H seems right. 

I think that's it. So the answer should be H. But wait, I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check the calculations. 

Depreciation per year: 1200 /6 = 200. So each year, subtract 200. After first year: 1200-200=1000. After second: 1000-200=800. Yep, correct. So the correct option is H.

The question involves calculating the depreciation and book value of a chain saw using the straight-line method. The chain saw costs $1,200, has a useful life of 6 years, and no residual value. 

Using the straight-line method, the annual depreciation is calculated as:

\[
\text{Depreciation per year} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{1,200 - 0}{6} = 200
\]

Thus, the depreciation per year is $200. 

The book value after the first year is:

\[
\text{Book Value after first year} = \text{Initial Cost} - \text{Depreciation for the first year} = 1,200 - 200 = 1,000
\]

The book value after the second year is:

\[
\text{Book Value after second year} = \text{Book Value after first year} - \text{Depreciation for the second year} = 1,000 - 200 = 800
\]

Among the options provided, only Option H matches these calculations: $200 per year depreciation, $1,000 after the first year, and $800 after the second year.

Answer: H
