Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about preparing chlorine gas using KClO3 and HCl. Hmm, the reaction equation is given as KClO3 + 6HCl → KCl + 3Cl2 + 3H2O. I need to find the weight of KClO3 required to produce 1.0 liter of Cl2 at STP. Oh wait, STP means standard temperature and pressure, right? So that's 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atm pressure.

Wait, right, at STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. But wait, the question says 1.0 liter of Cl2. So that's 1/22.4 moles of Cl2. Let me jot that down. Moles of Cl2 = 1.0 L / 22.4 L/mol ≈ 0.0446 mol.

Looking at the balanced equation, KClO3 reacts with 6 HCl to produce 3 Cl2. So the mole ratio of KClO3 to Cl2 is 1 to 3. So for every mole of KClO3, we get 3 moles of Cl2. Therefore, moles of KClO3 needed = moles of Cl2 / 3 = 0.0446 / 3 ≈ 0.01487 mol.

Now, I need the molar mass of KClO3 to find the weight. Let me calculate that. K is about 39.1 g/mol, Cl is 35.45, and O3 is 3 * 16 = 48 g/mol. Adding them up: 39.1 + 35.45 = 74.55, plus 48 gives 122.55 g/mol.

So weight of KClO3 = moles * molar mass = 0.01487 mol * 122.55 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.01487 * 122.55. Hmm, let me see. 0.01 * 122.55 is 1.2255. 0.00487 * 122.55 ≈ 0.00487 * 120 = 0.5844, and 0.00487*2.55≈0.0124. So adding them up: 1.2255 + 0.5844 = 1.8099 + 0.0124 ≈ 1.8223 g. Wait, but let me double-check my multiplication.

Wait, alternatively, 0.01487 * 122.55. Let me compute this accurately. 122.55 * 0.01 is 1.2255. 122.55 * 0.004 is 0.4902. 122.55 * 0.00087 is approximately 0.1064. Adding them together: 1.2255 + 0.4902 = 1.7157 + 0.1064 = 1.8221 g. So approximately 1.82 grams.

Looking at the options, option J is 1.84 g. Hmm, that's close. Wait, did I make a calculation error? Let me recalculate the moles of Cl2.

Wait, 1.0 L at STP is 1 /22.4 = 0.04464 moles. Moles of KClO3 needed is 0.04464 /3 = 0.01488 moles. Molar mass of KClO3: K (39.10), Cl (35.45), O (16*3=48). 39.10 +35.45=74.55 +48=122.55 g/mol.

So 0.01488 * 122.55 = let me compute it step by step.

122.55 * 0.01 is 1.2255.

122.55 * 0.004 is 0.4902.

122.55 * 0.00088 is approximately 0.1078.

Adding these: 1.2255 + 0.4902 = 1.7157 + 0.1078 = 1.8235 grams. So approximately 1.82 g.

The closest option is J:1.84 g, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me check if the mole ratio is correct.

The reaction is 1 KClO3 → 3 Cl2. So yes, moles KClO3 = moles Cl2 /3.

Wait, but wait, another thought—did I consider stoichiometry correctly? Let me look again. The equation shows 1 mole KClO3 gives 3 moles Cl2. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, is there another approach using the ideal gas law? The problem gives R as 0.082 L·atm/mol·K. Oh, wait, but since it's at STP, the volume corresponds to nRT/P, but STP is 0°C and 1 atm. So for Cl2, n = PV/(RT) = (1 atm * 1 L)/(0.082 * 273) ≈ 1/(0.082*273) ≈ 1/22.4 ≈ 0.0446 moles, which matches what I did earlier.

So the calculation seems correct. So the weight is approximately 1.82 g. Looking at the options, the closest is J:1.84 g. Maybe I should check if I did the multiplication accurately.

Wait, 0.01488 * 122.55. Let me compute 0.01488 * 122.55.

Hmm, 122.55 * 0.01 is 1.2255.

122.55 * 0.004 is 0.4902.

122.55 *0.0008 = 0.09804.

122.55 *0.00008 = ~0.009804.

So adding 0.01488 as 0.01 +0.004 +0.0008 +0.00008.

1.2255 +0.4902 = 1.7157.

1.7157 +0.09804 = 1.81374.

1.81374 + 0.009804 ≈ 1.8235 grams.

Hmm, so 1.82 g. But the option J is 1.84 g. So perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation.

Wait, molar mass of KClO3.

K is 39.10 g/mol.

Cl is 35.45.

O is 16.00 each, 3 O's, so 48.00.

39.10 +35.45=74.55 +48=122.55 g/mol. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the ideal gas calculation again. Wait, another approach: using PV = nRT.

At STP, T is 273 K, P=1 atm, R=0.082. So n = PV/(RT) = (1 * 1)/(0.082 *273) = 1/(22.4) ≈ 0.04464 moles Cl2.

So 0.04464 moles Cl2. Moles KClO3 = 0.04464 /3 = 0.01488 moles.

Mass KClO3 = 0.01488 * 122.55 ≈ 1.8235 g.

Hmm, I'm thinking, perhaps the options have some rounding. So why is J 1.84?

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the moles. Let me compute 1.8235, which is approximately 1.82 g. The options don't have 1.82, but J is 1.84. Are the options precise? Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: 2.75g

B:1.50g

C:3.00g

D:0.92g

E:2.50g

F:1.00g

G:1.20g

H:2.10g

I:3.68g

J:1.84g.

So the closest to 1.82 is J:1.84. But why is it 1.84 and not 1.82? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different molar mass for KClO3. Let me double-check that.

K: 39.10 g/mol.

Cl: 35.45 g/mol.

O: 16.00 each, so 3 *16=48.00.

So 39.10 +35.45 =74.55 plus 48 is 122.55 g/mol. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.04464 /3 *122.55.

0.04464 /3 is 0.01488.

0.01488 *122.55.

Let me compute 0.01488 *122.55.

Compute 0.01 *122.55 =1.2255.

0.004 *122.55=0.4902.

0.0008 *122.55=0.09804.

0.00008 *122.55=0.009804.

Adding those: 1.2255 +0.4902=1.7157.

1.7157 +0.09804=1.81374.

1.81374 +0.009804=1.82354.

So 1.8235 grams. So 1.82g. So the closest option is J:1.84g. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't balanced correctly? Let me check the equation again.

The given equation is KClO3 +6HCl → KCl +3Cl2 +3H2O. So that's 1 mole KClO3 producing 3 moles Cl2. So 1:3 ratio. So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait a moment. The problem says 1.0 liter of Cl2. At STP, that's 1/22.4 moles. So 0.04464 moles. So 0.01488 moles KClO3.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the volume to be at different conditions, but the question clearly states STP, so 22.4 L/mol.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the step where I compute the moles of KClO3. Alternatively, perhaps the given R is a typo, but no, the problem states R is 0.082.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using R=0.0821, but that would only change the result a little.

Wait, n = PV/(RT) = (1 atm *1 L)/(0.0821 *273.15). Let me compute that more accurately.

0.0821 *273.15 ≈ let's compute 0.0821 *273 = 22.41 L·atm/mol. So n = 1 /22.41 ≈0.0446 moles Cl2. So that's correct.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the weight is approximately 1.82g. Since the options don't have 1.82, perhaps the intended answer is J:1.84g. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculations somewhere.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Let me compute 122.55 g/mol multiplied by 0.01488 mol.

0.01488 *122.55:

Let me compute 122.55 * 0.01 =1.2255.

122.55 * 0.004 =0.4902.

122.55 * 0.0008 =0.09804.

122.55 * 0.00008 =0.009804.

Adding them: 1.2255 +0.4902=1.7157.

1.7157 + 0.09804=1.81374.

1.81374 +0.009804=1.8235 g.

So yeah, 1.8235 grams. So the closest option is J:1.84g. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects rounding up to two decimal places, 1.82 would round to 1.82, but the option is 1.84, which is a bit higher.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should check if the molar volume at STP is taken as 22.4 L/mol, but sometimes it's approximated as 22.414 L/mol, but that's negligible here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.8235 grams and see which option is closer. 1.82 is closer to 1.82 than 1.84, but the options don't have 1.82. So perhaps the intended answer is J:1.84g. Maybe the original calculation had slight differences due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the molar volume to be 24 L/mol, but that's wrong. No, STP is definitely 22.4 L/mol.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem uses 22.7 L/mol as the molar volume, but that's at 25°C and 1 atm. No, the question says STP, which is 0°C and 1 atm, so 22.4 L/mol.

Hmm, perhaps the given options are approximated, and J is the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the stoichiometry is different. Wait, the reaction equation is KClO3 +6HCl → KCl +3Cl2 +3H2O. So for each mole of KClO3, 3 moles Cl2 are produced. So the ratio is 1:3. So 1 mole KClO3 gives 3 moles Cl2.

So 1/3 moles KClO3 per mole Cl2.

Wait, perhaps I should express it as moles of KClO3 = (1/3) * moles Cl2.

Yes, that's correct.

So 0.04464 moles Cl2 * (1/3) =0.01488 moles KClO3.

Yes, that's correct.

So, I think my calculation is correct, and the closest option is J:1.84g. But wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the KClO3 molar mass.

Wait, K's atomic weight is about 39.1, Cl about 35.5, O about 16. So 39.1 +35.5 =74.6 +48=122.6 g/mol.

Yes, that's correct.

So, perhaps the intended answer is J, 1.84g, considering possible rounding differences. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a step, but I can't see where.

To determine the weight of KClO₃ required to produce 1.0 liter of Cl₂ gas at STP, we start by analyzing the given reaction:

\[
\text{KClO}_3 + 6\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{KCl} + 3\text{Cl}_2 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Cl₂
At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, 1.0 liter of Cl₂ corresponds to:

\[
\text{Moles of Cl}_2 = \frac{1.0 \, \text{L}}{22.4 \, \text{L/mol}} \approx 0.04464 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Use stoichiometry to find moles of KClO₃
From the balanced equation, 1 mole of KClO₃ produces 3 moles of Cl₂. Thus, the moles of KClO₃ required are:

\[
\text{Moles of KClO}_3 = \frac{\text{Moles of Cl}_2}{3} = \frac{0.04464}{3} \approx 0.01488 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the molar mass of KClO₃
The molar mass of KClO₃ is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Molar mass of KClO}_3 = 39.10 \, (\text{K}) + 35.45 \, (\text{Cl}) + 3 \times 16.00 \, (\text{O}) = 122.55 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the weight of KClO₃
The weight of KClO₃ is given by:

\[
\text{Weight of KClO}_3 = \text{Moles of KClO}_3 \times \text{Molar mass of KClO}_3 = 0.01488 \, \text{mol} \times 122.55 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
0.01488 \times 122.55 \approx 1.8235 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated weight of KClO₃ is approximately 1.82 g. Among the given options, the closest value is **1.84 g (Option J)**. The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding differences in intermediate steps or constants.

### Final Answer:
J
