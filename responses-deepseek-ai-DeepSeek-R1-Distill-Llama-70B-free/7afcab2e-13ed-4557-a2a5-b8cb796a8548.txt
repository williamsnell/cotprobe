Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the Gulf of Tonkin resolution question. Hmm, I remember that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a significant event in the Vietnam War. I think it happened in the 60s, maybe 1964? Right, because that's when the US involvement started ramping up.

Wait, the resolution itself was passed after some naval incidents where US ships were involved. I think there was a reported attack by North Vietnamese torpedo boats. But wasn't there some controversy about whether the second attack actually happened? Like maybe it was mistaken or exaggerated? Oh, right, but at the time, President Johnson used it as a pretext to escalate US involvement.

So the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a joint resolution by Congress. I remember that it authorized the president to take military action without a formal declaration of war. So it was a way for the president to get the power to commit troops and start bombing without going through the full war declaration process.

Looking at the options, option C says it allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam. That makes sense because after this resolution, the US started sending ground troops and increasing airstrikes. So this was a pivotal moment where the US moved from just advising to direct involvement.

Other options: A says it triggered global protests. I'm not sure about the timing. Protests against the war did happen, but I think they came later, maybe around 1967 or so. So the resolution itself was more about starting the escalation than causing protests.

Option B says it reduced US troops. No, that's the opposite. It led to an increase. Option E talks about diplomatic negotiations, but I don't think the resolution was about that. It was more about military action.

Option F says it enhanced Congressional control. No, actually, the resolution gave the president more power, so Congress was kind of handing authority over. So F is probably incorrect.

Options G and J talk about ending the war, which definitely wasn't the case. The war went on for many years after that.

So putting it all together, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution was crucial because it allowed President Johnson to intensify US involvement in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. So the answer should be C.

The Gulf of Tonkin resolution, passed in 1964, was a pivotal moment in the Vietnam War. It authorized President Lyndon B. Johnson to take military action in Southeast Asia without a formal declaration of war, effectively escalating U.S. involvement. The resolution was triggered by reported attacks on U.S. naval vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin, though the second attack was later disputed. Its significance lies in granting the president the authority to intensify U.S. military presence, including deploying ground troops and increasing airstrikes. This marked a shift from advisory roles to direct involvement, making option C the correct choice.

Answer: C
