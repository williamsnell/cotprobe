Okay, so I've got this physics question here about magnetic fields around a current-carrying wire. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when electricity flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field. But wait, what shape does that field take?

I think it's something to do with circles. Oh right, the right-hand rule! If you grab the wire with your thumb pointing in the direction of the current, your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field. So that would mean the field lines are circular around the wire.

Wait, what's the other option? Oh, the question gives 'circles' as option H, and 'straight lines' as F. Oh, no, straight lines are probably electric fields or something else. Yeah, the magnetic field lines form circles around the wire.

So the answer should be H: circles.

The magnetic field lines around a current-carrying wire form circles, as determined by the right-hand rule. When current flows through the wire, the magnetic field lines encircle the wire in a circular pattern. 

Answer: H
