Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of calculations. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about doubly charged alpha particles being emitted from something, probably a nucleus during decay. The given energy is 6.048 MeV. I need to find their velocity and the magnetic field that would bend them into a circular path with a radius of 40 cm.

Hmm, right. So the particles are moving in a magnetic field, which applies a force perpendicular to their velocity, causing them to move in a circular path. I remember that the magnetic force provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion, so that should be a key equation here.

First, I think I should calculate the velocity of the alpha particles. The energy given is their kinetic energy, right? Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². But wait, the energy is given in MeV, which is mega-electron volts. I need to convert that into standard units to work with SI units for velocity in m/s.

So, 6.048 MeV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602×10^-19 joules. So 6.048 MeV would be 6.048 × 10^6 eV. Multiply that by 1.602e-19 J/eV to get the energy in joules.

Let me calculate that. 6.048e6 * 1.602e-19 = let's see. 6 * 1.6 is about 9.6, but more accurately, 6.048 * 1.602 is approximately 9.686. Then, 10^6 * 10^-19 is 10^-13. So the energy is about 9.686e-13 J.

Wait, wait, wait. But wait, the alpha particles are doubly charged. Oh, but the charge shouldn't affect the kinetic energy directly. The energy given is the kinetic energy, so that's the total energy, regardless of the charge. So the charge will come into play when calculating the magnetic field, but for the velocity, it's just the KE.

Now, the mass of the alpha particle is given as 6.64 ×10^-27 kg. Right, that's about 4 times the mass of a proton, since each alpha is a helium-4 nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons).

So, KE = (1/2) m v².

We can rearrange this to find v: v = sqrt(2KE/m).

So, plugging in the values: KE is 9.686e-13 J, m is 6.64e-27 kg.

Let me compute 2KE/m first. 2 * 9.686e-13 is about 1.937e-12. Divide that by 6.64e-27: 1.937e-12 / 6.64e-27 = let's see, 1.937 /6.64 is approximately 0.2916, and 10^-12 /10^-27 is 10^15. So 0.2916e15 = 2.916e14. So 2KE/m is 2.916e14 m²/s².

Taking the square root of that gives v = sqrt(2.916e14). Hmm, the square root of 1e14 is 1e7, so sqrt(2.916) is about 1.708, so 1.708e7 m/s. So that's roughly 1.708 ×10^7 m/s.

Looking at the options, I see that option G and option J have 1.709e7 m/s, which is very close. So the velocity must be approximately 1.71e7 m/s.

Now, moving on to the magnetic field part. The particles are moving perpendicular to the magnetic field, so the magnetic force is qvB, and this provides the centripetal force, which is mv²/r.

So, setting them equal: qvB = mv²/r.

We can cancel a v from both sides, so B = (mv)/(q r).

Wait, no, wait. Let me write that again. So qvB = mv²/r => B = (mv)/(q r).

Wait, right. Because velocity is in the numerator, and since q is in the denominator, B is proportional to velocity. Let me make sure I have the formula correctly.

So, B = (m v) / (q r).

Now, the charge q is the charge of the alpha particle. Since it's doubly charged, q = 2e, where e is the elementary charge (1.602e-19 C). So q = 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C.

The radius r is 40 cm, which is 0.4 meters.

We already have the velocity from the first part, approximately 1.71e7 m/s. Let me plug all the numbers into the formula.

B = (6.64e-27 kg * 1.71e7 m/s) / (3.204e-19 C * 0.4 m).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 6.64e-27 * 1.71e7 = 6.64 *1.71 = approx 11.37. 10^-27 *10^7 =10^-20. So 11.37e-20 =1.137e-19 kg·m/s.

Denominator: 3.204e-19 * 0.4 = 3.204 *0.4 =1.2816e-19.

So B = (1.137e-19) / (1.2816e-19) ) = approximately 0.887 Tesla. Because 1.137 /1.2816 is about 0.887.

Looking at the options, which option has a velocity around 1.71e7 and B around 0.885?

Looking back, option G is velocity 1.709e7, B 0.885 Wb/m² (which is Tesla, since 1 Wb/m² is 1 T). So option G matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to see if I made any mistakes.

First, the kinetic energy: 6.048 MeV is 6.048e6 eV. Multiply by 1.602e-19 J/eV: 6.048e6 * 1.602e-19 = let's compute 6.048 * 1.602 = let's do it accurately.

6 * 1.602 is 9.612. 0.048 *1.602 is approximately 0.0768. So total is 9.612 + 0.0768 = 9.6888. So 9.6888e-13 J.

So KE = 9.6888e-13 J.

Then, velocity v = sqrt(2 * 9.6888e-13 / 6.64e-27).

Compute denominator: 6.64e-27.

So 2*9.6888e-13 = 1.937776e-12.

1.937776e-12 / 6.64e-27 = 1.937776 /6.64 * 1e15.

1.937776 /6.64 = let me compute that. 6.64 goes into 19.37776 how many times?

6.64 * 2.9 is 19.236. So that's 2.916 times approximately, because 6.64 *2.916 is 6.64 *2=13.28, 6.64*0.916= approx 6.08 (since 0.9*6.64=5.976, 0.016*6.64=0.106, so total 6.082). So 13.28 +6.082=19.362. So 2.916 *6.64e-27 gives 1.937e-12. So the division is about 2.916e15.

Wait, no, wait: 1.937776e-12 /6.64e-27 = (1.937776 /6.64) *e( -12 +27 )= (0.2916) *e15. So 0.2916e15 = 2.916e14. So 2KE/m is 2.916e14.

So v = sqrt(2.916e14 )= sqrt(2.916)*1e7 m/s.

Sqrt(2.916) is approximately 1.708, so v≈1.708e7 m/s. That's correct.

Now for the magnetic field, B = (m v)/(q r).

m=6.64e-27 kg, v=1.708e7 m/s, q=3.204e-19 C, r=0.4 m.

Compute numerator: 6.64e-27 *1.708e7 = 6.64 *1.708 = let's compute.

6 *1.708=10.248, 0.64*1.708=1.093. So total 11.341. So 11.341e-20 kg·m/s (since 1e-27 *1e7=1e-20).

Denominator: 3.204e-19 *0.4 = 1.2816e-19.

So B = 11.341e-20 / 1.2816e-19 = (11.341 /12.816) ) since 1e-20 /1e-19 is 0.1. Wait, wait, no: 11.341e-20 /1.2816e-19 = 11.341/(12.816) * (1e-20 / 1e-19) )= (11.341/12.816)*0.1.

Wait, no, 1e-20 /1e-19 is 0.1, correct. So (11.341 /12.816) *0.1.

Wait, wait, maybe it's better to compute it as (11.341e-20) / (1.2816e-19 )= (11.341 / 128.16 ) *1e1? Hmm, perhaps I should do it differently.

Alternatively, 11.341e-20 /1.2816e-19 = (11.341 / 1.2816) ) * (1e-20 /1e-19 )= (8.84) * (0.1) )= 0.884.

Wait, 11.341 divided by 1.2816 is approximately 8.84? Let me check: 1.2816 *8 =10.2528, which is less than 11.341. 1.2816*8.8= let's compute:

1.2816 *8 =10.2528

1.2816 *0.8=1.02528

So 10.2528 +1.02528=11.278, which is close to 11.341. So 8.8 gives 11.278, so 8.8 plus 0.06 more would be 8.86, because 1.2816 *0.06=0.076896. So 11.278+0.0769=11.3549, which is a bit higher than 11.341. So maybe 8.85.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 11.341 /1.2816.

Let me do this division step by step.

1.2816 × 8 = 10.2528 → 11.341 -10.2528=1.0882 left.

Bring down a zero (since we're dealing with decimals). So 10.882 divided by 1.2816.

1.2816 × 8 =10.2528 → but 10.882 is more than that. So 8?

But wait, 1.2816 × 0.85 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator method.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that 11.341 divided by 1.2816 is approximately 8.84, and then when multiplied by 0.1 (from the exponents), gives 0.884. So B ≈ 0.884 T.

Looking at the options, option G has B=0.885 Wb/m², which is 0.885 T, and velocity 1.709e7, which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer must be option G.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the velocity of the doubly charged alpha particles using their kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is given as \( 6.048 \, \text{MeV} \), which is converted to joules:

\[
1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}, \quad 6.048 \, \text{MeV} = 6.048 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV}.
\]

\[
\text{Energy in joules} = 6.048 \times 10^6 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 9.686 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}.
\]

The velocity \( v \) is determined using the kinetic energy formula:

\[
\text{KE} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \, \text{KE}}{m}}.
\]

Given the mass of the alpha particle \( m = 6.64 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), we calculate:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 9.686 \times 10^{-13}}{6.64 \times 10^{-27}}}.
\]

\[
\frac{2 \times 9.686 \times 10^{-13}}{6.64 \times 10^{-27}} = 2.916 \times 10^{14} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2, \quad v = \sqrt{2.916 \times 10^{14}} \approx 1.708 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Thus, the velocity is approximately \( 1.708 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \).

Next, we calculate the magnetic field \( B \) that bends the beam into a circular path of radius \( r = 40 \, \text{cm} = 0.4 \, \text{m} \). The magnetic force provides the centripetal force:

\[
q v B = \frac{m v^2}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad B = \frac{m v}{q r}.
\]

The charge of a doubly charged alpha particle is \( q = 2e = 2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). Substituting the values:

\[
B = \frac{6.64 \times 10^{-27} \times 1.708 \times 10^7}{3.204 \times 10^{-19} \times 0.4}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
6.64 \times 10^{-27} \times 1.708 \times 10^7 = 1.137 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
3.204 \times 10^{-19} \times 0.4 = 1.2816 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C·m}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
B = \frac{1.137 \times 10^{-19}}{1.2816 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 0.887 \, \text{T}.
\]

Thus, the magnetic field is approximately \( 0.887 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \).

From the options, the velocity \( 1.709 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \) and magnetic field \( 0.885 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \) match most closely with option G.
