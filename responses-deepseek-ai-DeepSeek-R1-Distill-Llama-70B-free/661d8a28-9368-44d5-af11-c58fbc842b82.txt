Question:

Loretta Gould has been offered a position as salesperson for the Houston Oil Company. Her manager estimates that her sales will amount to approximately $80,000 the first year. She may accept one of two pay schedules: (1) a salary of $8,000 plus commission of 1% of sales or (2) a salary of $5,800 plus a commission of 5% of sales over $30,000. Which pay schedule is better? By how much is it better?

Options:

A: Both schedules are the same
B: Schedule (1) is better by $300
C: Both schedules are better by different amounts depending on sales
D: Schedule (1) is better by $1,200
E: Schedule (2) is better by $1,200
F: Schedule (2) is better by $700
G: Schedule (1) is better by $700
H: Schedule (1) is better by $500
I: Schedule (2) is better by $500
J: Schedule (2) is better by $300

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Loretta Gould choosing between two pay schedules. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I need to understand what each pay schedule offers. The first option is a salary of $8,000 plus a commission of 1% on her sales. The second option is a salary of $5,800 plus a commission of 5% on sales over $30,000. Her estimated sales are $80,000 in the first year.

So, I'll calculate the total pay for each schedule separately. 

Starting with Schedule (1): The salary is $8,000, and then 1% of $80,000. Let me compute that. 1% of 80k is 0.01 * 80,000 = $800. So adding that to the salary, 8,000 + 800 = $8,800 total.

Now for Schedule (2): The salary is lower at $5,800, but the commission structure is different. It's 5% on sales over $30,000. So I need to figure out how much that commission would be. Her sales are $80k, so the amount over $30k is 80,000 - 30,000 = $50,000. 5% of 50,000 is 0.05 * 50,000 = $2,500. Adding that to the base salary: 5,800 + 2,500 = $8,300 total.

Wait, wait. That can't be right because $8,300 is less than $8,800. So Schedule (1) seems better. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For Schedule (1): 8,000 + (80,000 * 0.01) = 8,000 + 800 = 8,800. Yep, that's correct.

For Schedule (2): 5,800 + ( (80,000 - 30,000) * 0.05 ) = 5,800 + (50,000 * 0.05) = 5,800 + 2,500 = 8,300. That's also correct.

So Schedule (1) gives her $8,800, and Schedule (2) gives $8,300. So Schedule (1) is better by 8,800 - 8,300 = $500. 

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check again. The options are: 

A: same
B: 1 better by 300
D: 1 better by 1200
E: 2 better by 1200
F: 2 better by 700
G: 1 better by 700
H: 1 better by 500
I: 2 better by 500
J: 2 better by 300

So according to my calculation, Schedule (1) is better by $500. That would be option H.

But wait, did I compute it correctly? Because if she makes 80k, the commission in option 2 is only on the amount over 30k, which is 50k. 5% of 50k is indeed 2,500. So 5,800 + 2,500 = 8,300. And option 1 is 8,800. So the difference is 500. So option H is correct.

I think that's it. So the answer should be H.

To determine which pay schedule is better for Loretta Gould, we calculate the total compensation for each option based on her estimated sales of $80,000.

**Schedule (1):**
- Base salary: $8,000
- Commission: 1% of $80,000 = $800
- Total compensation: $8,000 + $800 = **$8,800**

**Schedule (2):**
- Base salary: $5,800
- Commission: 5% of sales over $30,000 = 5% of $50,000 = $2,500
- Total compensation: $5,800 + $2,500 = **$8,300**

Comparing the two schedules:
- Schedule (1) provides $8,800, while Schedule (2) provides $8,300.
- The difference is $8,800 - $8,300 = **$500**.

Thus, Schedule (1) is better by $500.

**Answer: H**
