Okay, so I need to figure out the correct selling price per unit for this company. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

First, let me list out all the given information to make sure I don't miss anything. The company wants a 20% return on investment before taxes. The target sales volume is 80% of capacity. The annual capacity is 200,000 units, so 80% of that would be the number of units they plan to produce and sell. The fixed annual costs are $200,000. Variable cost per unit is $9. The company's investment is $1,400,000.

I remember that the formula for return on investment (ROI) is (Net Income / Investment) * 100. They want this ROI to be 20%, so Net Income should be 20% of $1,400,000.

Let me calculate the required Net Income first. 20% of $1,400,000 is 0.2 * 1.4e6 = $280,000. So the company needs a Net Income of $280,000 before taxes.

Next, I'll think about the revenues and costs. The Net Income is calculated as EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) minus taxes, but since the ROI is before taxes, maybe I should calculate EBIT as Net Income plus taxes. Wait, actually, wait. The question says "return on investment before taxes," which I think refers to EBIT. So maybe I should focus on EBIT being 20% of the investment.

Wait, no, ROI is typically Net Income / Investment, but since it's before taxes, perhaps it's EBIT / Investment. Hmm, maybe I should clarify. Let me think: ROI can sometimes be calculated as EBIT divided by total investment. Because EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes, which is closer to the operational profit.

In any case, the way the question is phrased, I think they're considering EBIT as the measure for ROI. Alternatively, perhaps we should compute the required EBIT to get a 20% ROI.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The required profit (which would be EBIT) would be 20% of the investment. So 20% of $1,400,000 is $280,000. So EBIT needs to be $280,000.

Now, EBIT is calculated as Sales Revenue minus Total Costs (fixed and variable). So EBIT = (Selling Price * Quantity Sold) - (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs * Quantity).

Let me note down the variables:

- Quantity Sold = 80% of 200,000 units = 0.8 * 200,000 = 160,000 units.
- Fixed Costs (FC) = $200,000.
- Variable Costs (VC) per unit = $9.
- So Total Variable Costs = 160,000 * 9 = $1,440,000.
- Total Costs (TC) = FC + TVC = 200,000 + 1,440,000 = $1,640,000.

Wait, but EBIT is Sales Revenue minus Total Costs. So EBIT = (S * Q) - TC. And we know EBIT should be $280,000.

So, 280,000 = (S * 160,000) - 1,640,000.

Let me solve for S:

(S * 160,000) = 280,000 + 1,640,000 = 1,920,000.

So S = 1,920,000 / 160,000 = 12.

Wait, that gives S as $12. Looking at the options, option G is $12. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, maybe I confused Net Income with EBIT. Let me reevaluate.

If ROI is based on Net Income, then Net Income would be 20% of investment, which is $280,000. But then, to get Net Income, we have to subtract taxes. Oh wait, the question says "before taxes", so perhaps we don't need to consider taxes here. So maybe EBIT is the correct measure.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is Net Income = (Selling Price * Quantity) - Fixed Costs - Variable Costs * Quantity.

Wait, no, Fixed and Variable Costs are both part of the cost of goods sold and operating expenses. So EBIT is indeed (Sales) - (Fixed + Variable Costs).

So yes, EBIT = (S * Q) - (FC + VC*Q). So in that case, EBIT is 280,000.

So:

S * Q = EBIT + FC + VC*Q.

Wait, plugging in the numbers:

S = (EBIT + FC + (VC * Q)) / Q.

But wait, that's the same as (EBIT + Total Costs) / Q.

Which would be (280,000 + 1,640,000) / 160,000 = 1,920,000 / 160,000 = 12.

So S would be $12. That's option G.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is $12, so that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the required profit differently. Let me try another approach.

Total revenue needed would be EBIT + Total Costs.

Total Costs are $200,000 fixed plus (160,000 units * $9) variable.

So, 200,000 + (160,000 *9) = 200,000 + 1,440,000 = 1,640,000.

So, EBIT is $280,000.

Thus, Total Revenue = EBIT + Total Costs = 280,000 + 1,640,000 = 1,920,000.

Total Revenue is Selling Price per unit times Quantity Sold, which is S * 160,000.

So, 1,920,000 = S * 160,000 â†’ S = 1,920,000 / 160,000 = 12.

Yes, that's correct.

So the selling price per unit should be $12, which is option G.
</think>

To determine the selling price per unit, we start by calculating the required EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) to achieve a 20% return on investment (ROI) before taxes. The company's investment is $1,400,000, so the required EBIT is:

\[
\text{EBIT} = 0.20 \times 1,400,000 = 280,000.
\]

Next, we calculate the total costs. The fixed annual costs are $200,000, and the variable costs per unit are $9. At 80% of capacity, the production and sales volume is:

\[
\text{Quantity Sold} = 0.80 \times 200,000 = 160,000 \, \text{units}.
\]

The total variable costs are:

\[
\text{Total Variable Costs} = 160,000 \times 9 = 1,440,000.
\]

Thus, the total costs (fixed + variable) are:

\[
\text{Total Costs} = 200,000 + 1,440,000 = 1,640,000.
\]

The total revenue required to achieve the desired EBIT is:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{EBIT} + \text{Total Costs} = 280,000 + 1,640,000 = 1,920,000.
\]

Since total revenue is the product of the selling price per unit (\(S\)) and the quantity sold, we solve for \(S\):

\[
S = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Quantity Sold}} = \frac{1,920,000}{160,000} = 12.
\]

Thus, the selling price per unit is $12, which corresponds to option **G**.
