Question:

Police officers received an anonymous tip that two men were selling cocaine from the back of a restaurant. The tipster stated to the police that the two men were both tall white men who were wearing jeans and black shirts, the uniform of the restaurant. The tipster also said that one of the men had red hair and was wearing a tan ball cap and the other man had black hair and was wearing a red ball cap. The police set up surveillance on the back of the restaurant and saw the two men make several hand- to-hand transactions. Upon receiving authority to make the arrest from their commanding officer, they waited for the two men to come out again. About two hours later, the two men came out again, this time with a woman. The officers arrested the two men and detained the woman to determine her involvement. The officers took the woman's purse without her consent and searched it for illegal narcotics. In her purse they found three grams of crack cocaine, digital scales, a small glass pipe used for inhaling crack cocaine, and a balloon of black tar heroin. The woman was then arrested on the various drug charges. The woman was thereafter prosecuted and charged with illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. She filed a motion to exclude the drugs and the paraphernalia from evidence. Her motion will most likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that she was involved in the drug transactions.
B: denied, because the search was justified, since she was about to leave the scene of the crime.
C: granted, because the woman was not given a chance to refuse the search of her purse.
D: granted, because the police violated her right to privacy by searching her purse without her consent.
E: denied, because the woman was in a public place where she had a reduced expectation of privacy.
F: denied, because the police were acting in the interest of public safety.
G: denied, because she was sufficiently close or proximate to the crime scene to justifi the warrantless search.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before conducting the search.
I: granted, because the police should have asked for her consent before searching her purse.
J: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to conduct the search of her purse.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about the woman's motion to suppress evidence. Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the situation: Police got an anonymous tip about two men selling cocaine. The tip described them as tall white men in jeans and black shirts, which matches the restaurant's uniform. One had red hair with a tan cap, the other black hair with a red cap. Police set up surveillance and saw them making hand-to-hand transactions, which probably looked like drug deals. They got authority to arrest and waited. Later, the two men come out with a woman. The police arrest the men and detain the woman to check her involvement. Then, without her consent, they take her purse and search it, finding drugs and paraphernalia. She's charged and now wants to exclude the evidence.

The question is about whether her motion will be granted or denied. The options are from A to J.

So, I'm thinking about the legality of the search. The key issue here is whether the police had the right to search her purse without her consent.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, searches without a warrant are generally unreasonable unless an exception applies. One such exception is the search incident to a lawful arrest, but that typically applies to the person arrested and the area within their immediate control. However, in this case, the woman wasn't under arrest at the time of the search; she was just detained. So the search incident to arrest might not apply here.

Another exception is probable cause with exigent circumstances, which allows warrantless searches when there's an emergency. But the facts don't mention any exigency here. They took her purse and searched it after detaining her, but unless there was a fear she'd destroy evidence, that might not apply.

Then there's the issue of reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop. The police can detain someone if they have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. But even then, a Terry stop doesn't allow a full search; it's more of a pat-down for weapons. Searching her purse would require more than that.

Wait, but in this case, the police had already seen the two men making transactions, so they had probable cause to arrest them. When the woman comes out with them, the police might suspect she's involved. However, being with someone suspected of a crime doesn't automatically give probable cause against her. They need specific articulable facts.

So when they detain her, do they have reasonable suspicion to search her purse? Or do they need probable cause? I'm a bit fuzzy here. If they have probable cause to believe the purse contains evidence of a crime, they can search it without a warrant. But if not, they might need consent or a warrant.

In this scenario, the police might argue that because she was with the two men who were selling drugs, there's probable cause. But that's a bit of a stretch. Mere association doesn't necessarily establish probable cause. They need more specific reasons.

So, without her consent, the search might be unconstitutional. Unless the police had probable cause to search her purse, which they might not have had. The fact that they found drugs in her purse doesn't retroactively justify the search if the search itself was unlawful.

Looking at the options:

Option J says the motion will be granted because the police didn't have probable cause to search her purse. That seems to fit because without probable cause or consent, the search was illegal.

Other options: 

A says reasonable suspicion. That's for a Terry stop, but not for a full search. 

B talks about her leaving the scene, but that's not an exigent circumstance I think.

C says she wasn't given a chance to refuse, but that's about consent. If she didn't consent, but the search was without a warrant, that's the issue.

D is about right to privacy, but the purse is a personal effect; the search would need justification.

E is about public place, but even in public, a purse search needs a reason.

F is public safety, which I don't think applies here.

G is proximity to the crime scene. I'm not sure that's enough for probable cause.

H is about no warrant, but warrantless searches can be okay under exceptions.

I says police should have asked for consent. If they didn't, the search is illegal if no exception applies.

So the main issue is whether the police had probable cause to search her purse. Since she was just with the two men, but there's no indication she was involved beyond that, the search without consent or probable cause would be unconstitutional. So the evidence would be suppressed, and her motion granted.

The question revolves around the legality of the police searching the woman's purse without her consent and whether the evidence obtained should be excluded. Under the Fourth Amendment, warrantless searches are generally unreasonable unless an exception applies, such as probable cause or exigent circumstances. 

The police detained the woman to investigate her involvement but did not arrest her. A search incident to arrest does not apply here because she was not under arrest at the time of the search. Additionally, there is no indication of exigent circumstances, such as an immediate threat or fear of evidence destruction, to justify the warrantless search. 

The key issue is whether the police had probable cause to search her purse. Mere association with individuals suspected of a crime does not establish probable cause. The police would need specific articulable facts to justify searching her purse. Since the facts do not indicate such specifics, the search likely violated her Fourth Amendment rights. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Reasonable suspicion justifies a Terry stop, not a full search of her purse.  
- **B**: Incorrect. There is no indication that she was about to leave the scene, and this does not constitute exigent circumstances.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The issue is not about her refusal but the lack of probable cause or consent.  
- **D**: Incorrect. While privacy rights are at play, the search would still need justification.  
- **E**: Incorrect. Even in a public place, searching a purse requires probable cause or consent.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Public safety does not apply here.  
- **G**: Incorrect. Proximity to the crime scene alone does not establish probable cause.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Warrantless searches can be valid under exceptions, but none apply here.  
- **I**: Incorrect. While consent is ideal, the primary issue is the lack of probable cause.  
- **J**: Correct. The police did not have probable cause to search her purse, making the search unconstitutional.

The motion to exclude the evidence will most likely be granted because the police lacked probable cause to search her purse.

Answer: J
