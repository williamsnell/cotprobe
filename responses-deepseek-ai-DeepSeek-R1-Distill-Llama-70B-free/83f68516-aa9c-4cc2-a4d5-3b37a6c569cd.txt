Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is asking how many moles of propane (C3H8) are there in 6.2 grams of propane. Hmm, moles and grams, right? I remember that to convert between grams and moles, I need to use the molar mass. 

Wait, what's the molar mass of propane? Propane is C3H8. Carbon has an atomic weight of about 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is about 1 g/mol. So for each molecule of propane, there are 3 carbons and 8 hydrogens. 

Let me calculate that. So 3 carbons would be 3 * 12 = 36 g/mol. And 8 hydrogens would be 8 * 1 = 8 g/mol. Adding those together, 36 + 8 equals 44 g/mol. Oh wait, wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake there. Because 3 times 12 is 36, yes, and 8 times 1 is 8, so 36+8=44 g/mol. So the molar mass of propane is 44 grams per mole.

Now, the problem gives me 6.2 grams of propane. I need to find out how many moles that is. Moles are calculated by dividing the mass by the molar mass. So moles = mass / molar mass.

Plugging in the numbers: moles = 6.2 g / 44 g/mol. Let me do that division. 6.2 divided by 44. Hmm, 44 goes into 6.2 how many times? Let's see, 44 times 0.14 is 6.16 because 44 * 0.1 is 4.4, and 44 * 0.04 is 1.76. So 4.4 + 1.76 = 6.16. Oh wait, 6.2 is a bit more than 6.16, so 0.14 something. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 44 * 0.14 = 6.16, as I said. So 6.2 - 6.16 is 0.04. So that's 0.04 grams remaining. To find the exact decimal, 0.04 /44 = 0.000909... So adding that to 0.14 gives approximately 0.1409 moles. So approximately 0.141 moles.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which option matches this. Let me look through the choices:

Option A: 14.1 mol → That's way too big.
Option B:7.1 mol → Also way too high.
Option C:71 mol → No, even bigger.
Option D:14.1 ×10^-1 → That's 1.41 mol. Hmm, no, that's bigger than what I calculated.
Option E:1.4 ×10^-1 → That's 0.14 mol. Close, but my calculation was about 0.141, which is a bit higher.
Option F:1.41 ×10^2 → That's 141 mol, way too big.
Option G:7.1 ×10^-1 → 0.71 mol, which is about five times larger than I got.
Option H:0.71 mol → Also higher than 0.141.
Option I:1.4 mol → No, that's ten times higher.
Option J:141 mol → No way.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check. Oh wait, 6.2 divided by 44.

Alternatively, maybe I should write it as a division problem. 44 goes into 62 (after moving the decimal) how many times? 44 * 1 is 44, subtract, 18. Bring down a zero: 180. 44*4 is 176, so 4 times. That gives 176, subtract from 180, remainder 4. Bring down a zero: 40. 44 goes into 40 zero times, so next digit is 0. Bring down another zero: 400? Wait, maybe I should do this more carefully.

Wait, 6.2 grams divided by 44 g/mol.

So 6.2 / 44 = ?

Well, 44 is 4.4e1. So 6.2 divided by 44 equals approximately 0.1409 mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: 1.4e-1, which is 0.14. But my calculation gives 0.1409, which is closer to 0.141. None of the options exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Wait option G is 7.1e-1 which is 0.71. That's higher than what I have. Option H is 0.71, same as G. Option E is 0.14. So 0.14 is option E, but my calculation is 0.1409, which is approximately 0.141. So perhaps the options expect rounding to two significant figures.

Wait, the given mass is 6.2 grams, which has two significant figures. The molar mass of propane is 44.0 g/mol, which is three significant figures. So the calculation should be to two significant figures.

So 6.2 /44 = 0.1409... which, to two sig figs, is 0.14 mol. So the correct answer would be 0.14 mol. Looking at the options, option E is 1.4e-1, which is 0.14 mol. So option E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the molar mass calculation. C3H8: 3*(12.01) + 8*(1.008). Let's calculate it precisely.

Carbon: 3 * 12.01 = 36.03 g/mol.
Hydrogen: 8 * 1.008 = 8.064 g/mol.
Total molar mass: 36.03 +8.064 =44.094 g/mol.

So 6.2 g /44.094 g/mol = approximately 0.1405 mol. Which is about 0.1405, so 0.1405. Rounded to two sig figs is 0.14. So the answer is 0.14 mol, which is option E:1.4 ×10^-1 mol.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 0.71, which is 7.1e-1, but that's higher. So yeah, option E is the correct one.

To determine how many moles of propane (C₃H₈) are in 6.2 g of propane, we use the molar mass of propane. The molar mass is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of } C_3H_8 = (3 \times 12.01) + (8 \times 1.008) = 36.03 + 8.064 = 44.094 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles is then calculated by dividing the given mass by the molar mass:

\[
\text{Moles of propane} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{6.2}{44.094} \approx 0.1405 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the given mass (6.2 g) has two significant figures, the result should also be rounded to two significant figures:

\[
\text{Moles of propane} \approx 0.14 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Now, comparing this result to the provided options:

- **A: 14.1 mol** → Too large.
- **B: 7.1 mol** → Too large.
- **C: 71 mol** → Too large.
- **D: \(14.1 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{mol}\)** → \(1.41 \, \text{mol}\), too large.
- **E: \(1.4 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{mol}\)** → \(0.14 \, \text{mol}\), matches the calculated value.
- **F: \(1.41 \times 10^2 \, \text{mol}\)** → \(141 \, \text{mol}\), too large.
- **G: \(7.1 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{mol}\)** → \(0.71 \, \text{mol}\), too large.
- **H: 0.71 mol** → Too large.
- **I: 1.4 mol** → Too large.
- **J: 141 mol** → Too large.

The correct answer is **E: \(1.4 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{mol}\)**, which is equivalent to \(0.14 \, \text{mol}\).

**Answer: E**
