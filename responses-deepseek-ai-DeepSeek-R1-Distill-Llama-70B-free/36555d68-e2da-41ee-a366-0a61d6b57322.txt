Okay, so I've got this problem about a baseball park with three sections, and I need to find out the total number of people that can sit there. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the red section seats 200 people. That's straightforward. So red is 200.

Next, the blue section. It says blue seats 20 fewer people than red. So I subtract 20 from red's 200. Let me calculate that: 200 minus 20 is 180. So blue can seat 180 people.

Now the green section. It says green seats twice as many as blue. Oh wait, so I take the blue's 180 and multiply by two. 180 times 2 is 360. So green can accommodate 360 people.

Now I need to find the total. So I add up all three sections. Red is 200, blue is 180, green is 360. Let me add them one by one. 200 plus 180 is 380, and then add 360 to that. 380 plus 360 is 740. So the total should be 740 people.

Looking at the options, option E is 740. So the answer should be E.

The red section seats 200 people. The blue section seats 20 fewer than red, so 200 - 20 = 180. The green section seats twice as many as blue, so 180 * 2 = 360. Adding them together: 200 + 180 + 360 = 740.

Answer: E
