Okay, so I have this legal question about contracts and rewards. Let me try to think it through. The scenario is about a man whose brother was murdered, and he published a reward notice offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer. Then there's this amateur detective who didn't know about the reward and started investigating because he was curious due to the sensationalism of the case. A week later, the detective found information that led to the arrest and conviction. But during the trial, he found out about the reward and now wants the $10,000.

The question is whether the detective can successfully claim the reward. The options are A through J, each giving different reasons.

I remember that reward notices typically constitute a unilateral contract. In unilateral contracts, the offer is made to the public, and the way to accept is by performing the required action. So when someone performs the action, they automatically accept the offer, and a contract is formed.

In this case, the man offered a reward for information leading to arrest and conviction. The detective provided such information without knowing about the reward. But he still performed the action that the offer requested.

Wait, but does knowledge of the offer matter? I think that in unilateral contracts, the offeree doesn't need to know about the offer when they perform the act. It's enough that the act is done, and the knowledge comes after. The reasoning is that the offer is an invitation to anyone who can perform, regardless of their knowledge at the time.

So looking at the options:

Option E says he'll succeed because the reward was a unilateral contract. That sounds right because unilateral contracts don't require the offeree to know beforehand; performance is acceptance.

Option C says he won't succeed because he didn't know about the reward. But I think that's incorrect because in unilateral contracts, knowledge isn't required at the time of performance.

Option B says he didn't accept before fulfilling the conditions. But in unilateral contracts, acceptance is the act itself, so that's not necessary.

Option A says he'll succeed because his actions led to arrest and conviction, which is true, but the reasoning is more about the unilateral contract.

So the correct answer should be E. The detective didn't know about the reward, but his performance of the required act (providing information) constitutes acceptance, forming a contract. Therefore, he's entitled to the reward.

The detective will succeed in claiming the reward because the notice constituted a unilateral contract. In such contracts, the offer is accepted through performance of the specified act, regardless of whether the offeree knew about the offer at the time of performance. The detective's actions fulfilled the conditions, creating a binding contract.

E: succeed, because the reward notice was a unilateral contract.

Answer: E
