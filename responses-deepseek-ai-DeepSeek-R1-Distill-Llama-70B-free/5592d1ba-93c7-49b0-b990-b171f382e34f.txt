Okay, so I've got this economics question here about automatic stabilizers and what happens to government expenditures and taxes during an economic expansion. Hmm, I remember that automatic stabilizers are policies that automatically adjust without the government needing to take explicit action. They help stabilize the economy by changing government spending or taxes as economic conditions change.

Wait, during an economic expansion, the economy is growing, right? So when the economy expands, incomes rise. And I think taxes are based on income. So if people are earning more, the government collects more taxes. That would mean taxes rise during an expansion because tax revenues increase as incomes go up.

Now, what about government expenditures? I remember that some government programs, like unemployment benefits, are automatic stabilizers. When the economy is bad, unemployment is high, so government spending on these programs increases. But in an expansion, unemployment drops, so spending on these programs would decrease. So government expenditures would fall because fewer people are claiming benefits.

Wait, but the question is about government expenditures in general. Are there other types of automatic stabilizers that affect spending? Or is it mainly through programs like unemployment? I think it's mainly through transfers like unemployment, so when the economy is good, the government spends less on these because fewer people need them. So expenditures fall.

Putting it together: during expansion, taxes rise (because higher incomes mean more tax revenue) and government expenditures fall (because less spent on assistance programs). So looking at the options, let's see.

The options are about how government expenditures and taxes change. The question asks what happens to government expenditures as a result of automatic stabilizers during expansions. So the first part is about expenditures, the second about taxes.

Looking at the options:

Option G says "fall and taxes rise." That matches what I was thinking. Let me double-check.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Are taxes automatically rising because of the stabilizers, or is it just that tax revenues rise because income is higher? Oh right, automatic stabilizers include the tax system. Progressive taxes mean that when income rises, taxes take a larger share, so tax revenues increase. So yes, taxes rise.

So the correct answer should be the option where expenditures fall and taxes rise. Looking at the options, that's option G.

Wait, let me look again. Option G is "fall and taxes rise." So yeah, that's correct.

During an economic expansion, automatic stabilizers play a crucial role in stabilizing the economy. As incomes rise due to economic growth, tax revenues automatically increase because the tax system is progressiveâ€”higher incomes result in a larger share of taxes being paid. Simultaneously, government expenditures on certain programs, such as unemployment benefits, decrease because fewer individuals require financial assistance during prosperous times. This dynamic means that government expenditures fall while taxes rise during economic expansions.

The correct answer is the option where government expenditures fall and taxes rise, which corresponds to **G**.

Answer: G
