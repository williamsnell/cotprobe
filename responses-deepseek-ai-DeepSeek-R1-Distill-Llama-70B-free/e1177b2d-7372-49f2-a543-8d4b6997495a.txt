Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question is about a sinusoidal signal being sampled and quantized, and then calculating some parameters related to its transmission. There are three parts: (a) finding the time between samples, (b) determining the number of bits and error probability for a binary PCM encoding, and (c) the error probability when using orthogonal signals. The options are A through J, each giving different values for these parameters.

Let me take it step by step. 

First, part (a): The time between samples, T. I remember that when sampling a signal, the Nyquist rate is twice the highest frequency component. The given frequency range is from 0.4 kHz to 4.4 kHz. So the highest frequency is 4.4 kHz, which is 4400 Hz. The Nyquist rate would be 2 * 4400 = 8800 Hz. But wait, the question says the sampling rate is four times the Nyquist rate. So the sampling frequency f_s is 4 * 8800 = 35200 Hz. 

Wait, no, wait a second. Nyquist rate is the minimum sampling rate to avoid aliasing, which is twice the maximum frequency. So the Nyquist rate is 2 * 4.4 kHz = 8.8 kHz. So if they're sampling at four times the Nyquist rate, that would be 4 * 8.8 kHz = 35.2 kHz. So the sampling frequency is 35,200 Hz. 

The time between samples T is the reciprocal of the sampling frequency. So T = 1 / f_s. Let me calculate that. 1 / 35,200 = approximately 2.84e-5 seconds. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute this correctly.

Wait, 1/35200 Hz is in seconds. Let me compute 35,200 Hz as 35200 samples per second. So T is 1/35200 seconds. Let me convert that to microseconds. Since 1 second is 1e6 microseconds, T is (1e6 / 35200) microseconds. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 35,200 is 3.52e4, so 1e6 / 3.52e4 = (1e6)/(3.52e4) = approx 28.4 microseconds? Wait, that can't be right because looking at the options, the times are in the range of 1.25 to 5.125 microseconds. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait. 1 / 35,200 Hz is the time between samples. Let me compute 35,200 as 3.52e4. So 1 / 3.52e4 = approximately 2.84e-5 seconds. To convert to microseconds, multiply by 1e6: 2.84e-5 * 1e6 = 28.4 microseconds. But that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe I misunderstood the first part. Let me read it again. The sampling rate is four times the Nyquist rate. Oh! Wait, the Nyquist rate is twice the highest frequency. So maximum frequency is 4.4 kHz. So Nyquist rate is 8.8 kHz. So four times that is 35.2 kHz. So yes, same as before. So T is 1/35200 = approx 2.84e-5 seconds, which is 28.4 microseconds. But none of the options are anywhere near that. So I must have messed up.

Wait, the options don't have 28.4. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the Nyquist rate. Let me think again. The frequency range is from 0.4 kHz to 4.4 kHz. So the highest frequency is 4.4 kHz. So Nyquist rate is 2 * 4.4 kHz = 8.8 kHz. So four times Nyquist would be 4 * 8.8 kHz = 35.2 kHz. So T is 1/35.2e3 Hz = 1/(35200) seconds. Let me compute that.

Wait, 35,200 is 3.52e4. So 1/3.52e4 = approx 2.84e-5 s. Hmm, 2.84e-5 seconds equals 28.4e-6 s, which is 28.4 microseconds. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe the sampling rate is four times the maximum frequency, not the Nyquist rate. Because sometimes people might confuse the terms. Let me check that possibility. If the maximum frequency is 4.4 kHz, then four times that is 17.6 kHz. Then T would be 1/17600 = approx 5.68e-5 s which is 56.8 microseconds. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question meant that the sampling rate is four times the highest frequency, not the Nyquist rate. Let me try that. So 4.4 kHz is 4400 Hz. Four times that is 17,600 Hz. So T is 1/17600 = 5.68e-5 seconds = 56.8e-6 s, which is 56.8 microseconds. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, I must be missing something. Let me re-examine the question statement. Oh wait, the signal is in the range 0.4 to 4.4 KHz. So the highest frequency is 4.4 KHz. So the Nyquist rate is 8.8 KHz. So four times that is 35.2 KHz. So T is 1/35.2e3 = approx 28.4 microseconds. But the options don't have that. So maybe the question is saying the sampling rate is four times the Nyquist rate of the signal. Wait, Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency. So I think my initial approach was correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute 35.2 kHz in terms of time. Let me compute 1/35200 exactly. 35200 is 3.52e4. So 1/3.52e4 = (1e4)/(3.52e4) * 1e-4? Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 35,200 = 3.52e4. 1e6 / 3.52e4 = (1e6)/(35200) = 1000000 / 35200. Let me compute that division.

Dividing 1,000,000 by 35,200:

35,200 x 28 = 985,600. Because 35,200 x 20 is 704,000. 35,200 x8 is 281,600. So 704k + 281.6k = 985,600. The remainder is 14,400.

So 35,200 x 0.408 ≈ 14,400 (since 35,200 * 0.4 = 14,080; 0.008 * 35,200 is 281.6; total 14,361.6). So approximately 0.408. So 28.408.

So 28.4 microseconds. But the options don't have this. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to take the highest frequency as 4.4 kHz, Nyquist rate 8.8 kHz, and the sampling rate is four times the Nyquist rate, so 4 * 8.8 kHz = 35.2 kHz. So T=1/35200 = 0.0000284 seconds = 28.4 microseconds. But none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the options again. Let's see:

Option A: T = 5.125 µs.

Option B: 3.125 µs.

Option C: 3.75 µs.

Option D: 2.5 µs.

Option F: 2.25 µs.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the math. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating 1/35,200.

Wait, 35,200 Hz is 3.52e4 Hz. So time is 1/(3.52e4) seconds. Let me compute that:

1/(3.52e4) = (1e-4)/3.52 = approx 2.84e-5 seconds. So 2.84e-5 s = 28.4e-6 s = 28.4 µs. Hmm, that's what I had before.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I got the question wrong. Let me re-examine the question statement again.

Wait, the question says the sampling rate is four times the Nyquistrate. Wait, is the Nyquistrate the same as the Nyquist rate? Or is it something else? Oh, Nyquistrate is another term for the Nyquist rate, I think. So yes, four times that.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the bandwidth as 4.4 kHz - 0.4 kHz = 4.0 kHz. So the bandwidth is 4 kHz. Then the highest frequency is 4.4, so the Nyquist rate is 8.8 kHz. Then four times that is 35.2 kHz, same as before.

So I'm stuck because none of the options have T around 28 µs. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Nyquist rate being the highest frequency, not twice. So Nyquistrate would be 4.4 kHz, and four times that is 17.6 kHz. Then T is 1/17600 ≈ 5.68e-5 s = 56.8 µs. Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to take the Nyquistrate as the highest frequency, which would be 4.4 kHz, and four times that is 17.6 kHz. So T would be 1/17600 = 5.68e-5 s = 56.8 µs, which is 5.68e-5 s. Hmm, that's 56.8 µs. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the maximum frequency as 4.4 kHz, so Nyquistrate is 8.8 kHz, and four times that is 35.2 kHz. So T is 1/35200 ≈ 2.84e-5 s = 28.4 µs.

But the options don't have anything near 28, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the question is about the signal being received after quantization, but that shouldn't affect the sampling rate. Or perhaps the signal-to-noise ratio affects the answer, but part (a) is solely about the sampling rate. So perhaps I should proceed, assuming that in part (a) the correct T is 28.4 µs, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options and see which one could fit. Let's see the options:

Option B: T=3.125 µs, which is 3.125e-6 s.

What's 1/3.125e-6? 3.125e-6 is 3.125 µs, so 1/(3.125e-6) = 320,000 Hz. So 320 kHz. So if the sampling rate is 320 kHz, then that's 4 times Nyquistrate. So Nyquistrate would be 80 kHz. That's way higher than the signal's maximum frequency. That can't be right.

Option F: T=2.25 µs. So 1/2.25e-6 s = approx 444,444 Hz, 0.444 MHz. So 4 times Nyquistrate would be 444,444 Hz, so Nyquistrate is 111,111 Hz, which is 111 kHz. Again, way higher than the signal's 4.4 kHz.

Wait, perhaps the Nyquistrate is 2 times the bandwidth? Let me think. The bandwidth is 4 kHz (from 0.4 to 4.4). So Nyquistrate is 8 kHz. Then four times Nyquistrate is 32 kHz. T would be 1/32,000 = 31.25 µs. But that's not in the options either.

Wait, 32 kHz would give 31.25 µs. Let me check if any option has that. Option A is 5.125, option E is 2.875, option D is 2.5. No, 31.25 isn't there.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the question has a typo, but I doubt it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the options' sampling rates and see which one makes sense.

For example, option B has T=3.125 µs. So f_s = 1 / 3.125e-6 = 320,000 Hz = 320 kHz. That's 4 times the Nyquistrate, so Nyquistrate would be 80 kHz. But the signal's maximum frequency is 4.4 kHz, so Nyquistrate should be 8.8 kHz. 4 times 8.8 kHz is 35.2 kHz. So that's way less than 320 kHz. So option B's T would imply a much higher sampling rate than needed.

Option D: T=2.5 µs. f_s=400,000 Hz. 4 times Nyquistrate would be 400 kHz, so Nyquistrate is 100 kHz. Again, way higher than needed.

Option F: T=2.25 µs. f_s= approx 444,444 Hz. So 4 times Nyquistrate is 444,444, so Nyquistrate is 111,111 Hz, which is 111 kHz. Not matching.

Option J: T=3.5 µs. f_s= approx 285,714 Hz. So 4 times Nyquistrate is 285,714 Hz, so Nyquistrate is 71,428 Hz, which is 71 kHz. Still higher than needed.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me compute 4 times the Nyquistrate (8.8 kHz) which is 35.2 kHz. So f_s=35.2 kHz. So T is 1/35.2e3 = 0.0000284 s = 28.4 µs. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the bandwidth as 4 kHz (4.4 - 0.4), and so the Nyquistrate is 8 kHz. So four times that is 32 kHz. So T=1/32,000 = 31.25 µs. Still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question uses the maximum frequency, not the Nyquistrate. So if the maximum frequency is 4.4 kHz, four times that is 17.6 kHz. So T=1/17,600 = approximately 5.68e-5 s, which is 56.8 µs. Not in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the minimum frequency for the Nyquistrate. No, that doesn't make sense. The Nyquistrate is determined by the highest frequency in the signal.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should move on to part (b) and see if that helps. 

Part (b) asks for the number of bits N and the probability of error if the quantized signal is encoded into a binary PCM waveform. The signal-to-noise ratio (s_i/η) is given as 10^6 after quantization.

I remember that the signal-to-quantization noise ratio (SQNR) for a sinusoidal signal is given by SQNR = (3 * 2^(2N)) / (L^2 - 1), where L is the number of levels. Wait, but I might be mixing up some formulas here.

Alternatively, the SQNR for a uniform quantizer with 2N bits is SQNR = 3 * (2^(2N)) * (signal power) / (quantization noise power). Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the formula correctly.

The SQNR in dB is approximately 6N dB for a sinusoidal signal, assuming optimal quantization (when the signal peaks are at the quantization levels). But this is an approximation.

But in this case, the SQNR is given as 10^6. Let me convert that to dB to make it easier. 10^6 is a ratio, so in dB it's 10*log10(1e6) = 10*6 = 60 dB.

If SQNR is approximately 6N dB, then 6N = 60, so N=10. But wait, that's for a sinusoidal signal. Alternatively, the exact formula is SQNR = (3 * 2^(2N)) ) / ( (2^N - 1)^2 ) * (some factor), but perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, the exact formula for SQNR of a sinusoidal signal is SQNR = (3 * (4^N)) ) / ( (2^N - 1)^2 ), but that might not be correct. Alternatively, for a full-scale sine wave, the SQNR is approximately 1.5*N dB, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: The number of levels is 256, which is 2^8. So N is 8 bits. So if the quantizer uses 256 levels, that requires 8 bits. So part (b) is asking for N and the probability of error when encoded into binary PCM.

Wait, but the SQNR is given as 10^6, which is 60 dB. For a 256-level quantizer (8 bits), the SQNR would be approximately 6*8=48 dB, which is less than 60 dB. So perhaps the calculation isn't matching, but maybe the given SQNR is after some other factor.

Wait, perhaps the signal to quantization noise ratio is given by SQNR = 3 * (2^(2N)) / (L^2 -1), where L is the number of levels. Since L=256, L^2-1 is (256)^2 -1 ≈ 65536. So SQNR = 3 * (2^(2N)) / 65536.

Wait, let me compute that. For N=8, 2^(2N)=2^16=
