Question:

A defendant was going out to dinner, and she parked her car at a parking lot across the street from the restaurant. The parking attendant directed the defendant to leave her keys in the car, and he handed her a receipt as she left. Following dinner, the defendant went back to the parking lot and handed her receipt to the attendant who informed her that the parking charge would be $14. Visibly irate, she told the attendant that $14 was much too high for a two-hour parking fee. The parking attendant responded that unless she paid the $14, he could not return her car. She adamantly refused to pay the $14, and her friend, with whom she was having dinner, drove the defendant home in her car. Later that same night, the defendant decided to regain possession of her car with a spare set of keys. She returned to the lot and drove her car home. If the defendant is subsequently charged with larceny, she will most likely be found

Options:

A: not guilty, because she did not take possession of another person's property.
B: guilty, because she intentionally avoided paying the parking fee by using her spare keys.
C: guilty, because she acted with the intent to deprive the parking lot of its rightful fee.
D: guilty, because she was under a binding contractual obligation to pay the parking fee.
E: not guilty, because the parking attendant did not have a legal right to withhold her car.
F: not guilty, because the parking lot's charges were not agreed upon in advance.
G: not guilty, because the $14 charge was excessively high.
H: guilty, because she failed to pay the $14 before regaining possession of her car.
I: guilty, because she knowingly took her car without the consent of the parking attendant.
J: not guilty, because the defendant cannot be charged with larceny of her own motor vehicle.

Okay, so I've got this question about larceny, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the scenario step by step.

Alright, the defendant parks her car in a lot, leaves the keys with the attendant, and gets a receipt. After dinner, she goes back, shows the receipt, but the attendant says she has to pay $14. She argues it's too high but then her friend drives her home in her own car. Later, she uses a spare key to take her car back. Now she's charged with larceny.

Hmm, larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. So, the key elements are taking without consent, intent to deprive, and it's someone else's property.

Wait, but the car is hers. She's the owner. So, can she commit larceny of her own property? I think generally, you can't steal your own stuff. So that might be a point in her favor. But let me think more.

When she parked, she gave the keys to the attendant. So, maybe the parking lot has a lien or some right to hold the car until payment. But is that the case here? I'm not entirely sure about the laws on that. If the parking lot has a contractual right to hold the car until the fee is paid, then maybe she was unauthorized to take it without paying.

But wait, the question is about larceny, not breach of contract. So, even if she had a contract, does that make her taking the car without paying larceny? Or is it a civil matter?

I remember that for larceny, the property has to be taken without consent. If the attendant refused to give the car back without payment, and she took it anyway, was she taking it without consent? But she's the owner. So, the attendant's consent isn't required because it's her property. Unless the attendant had some legal authority to hold it.

Another angle: when she parked, she gave the keys, but she took the car back later. So, she didn't take the attendant's property; she took her own. So, larceny would require taking someone else's property. Since it's her own, she can't be guilty. So, the answer would hinge on ownership.

Looking at the options, option J says she can't be guilty because it's her own car. That makes sense because larceny requires taking another's property.

But wait, what about the argument that she was trying to avoid paying the fee? That might relate to theft of services or something else, but not larceny of the car itself. Larceny is about the taking of property, not about avoiding payment for services.

So, the correct answer is J: not guilty because she can't be charged with larceny of her own car.

The defendant cannot be found guilty of larceny because larceny requires the unlawful taking and carrying away of another person's property. Since the car belongs to the defendant, she cannot be guilty of stealing her own property. The issue of avoiding payment for services is a separate matter and does not constitute larceny in this context.

Answer: J
