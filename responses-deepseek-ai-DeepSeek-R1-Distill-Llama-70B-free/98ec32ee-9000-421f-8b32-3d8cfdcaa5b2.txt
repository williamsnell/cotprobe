Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about ResNets and Transformers. I'm a bit rusty on my neural network architectures, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says that the original ResNets and Transformers are feedforward neural networks. Statement 2 claims that the original Transformers use self-attention, but ResNet does not.

First, I remember that ResNets, or Residual Networks, were introduced to help with the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. They do this using residual connections, which allow the network to learn much deeper models than before. ResNets are definitely feedforward because each layer's output is just passed to the next without any loops or recurrence. So Statement 1's first part is correct for ResNets.

Now, Transformers. They were a game-changer in NLP, right? The original Transformer model introduced self-attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence relative to each other. So Transformers definitely use self-attention. But are they feedforward? Yes, because the data flows only forward through the layersâ€”there's no recurrence or feedback loops like in RNNs or LSTMs. So the Transformer part of Statement 1 is also correct.

So Statement 1 is True because both ResNets and Transformers are feedforward networks.

Moving to Statement 2: It says Transformers use self-attention, which I know is true. But does ResNet use self-attention? I don't think so. ResNet relies on residual connections and convolutional layers, not self-attention. Self-attention is more about how each part of the input relates to others, which is a key feature of Transformers. So Statement 2 is True as well.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Did any variant of ResNet use self-attention later on? I think some variants might have incorporated attention mechanisms, but the original ResNet paper didn't. The original ResNet uses basic blocks with residual connections and convolutions. So yes, Statement 2 is correct.

So both statements are True. Looking at the options, option A is "True, True". So the answer should be A.

The original ResNets and Transformers are both feedforward neural networks. ResNets introduced residual connections to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, while Transformers revolutionized sequence modeling with self-attention. Statement 1 is true because both architectures are feedforward. Statement 2 is also true as Transformers use self-attention, whereas the original ResNet does not. 

Answer: A
