Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The mean of 7 numbers is 15. Then, when an 8th number is added, the mean drops to 12. I need to find what that 8th number is. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break this down. Mean is calculated by the sum of the numbers divided by how many there are. So, in the first case, with 7 numbers, the mean is 15. That means the total sum of those 7 numbers must be 7 multiplied by 15. Let me do that math: 7 times 15 is 105. So the sum is 105.

Now, when an 8th number is added, the mean becomes 12. So now there are 8 numbers. The new mean is 12, so the total sum now is 8 times 12. Let me calculate that: 8 times 12 is 96. Wait, that's less than 105? Oh, that makes sense because the mean decreased. So the total sum after adding the 8th number is 96.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the original sum was 105 and the new sum is 96, that would imply that the 8th number is negative. Because adding a number and the total sum goes down. Let me double-check. Oh wait, yes, because 96 is less than 105, so the difference is 105 minus 96, which is 9. But since the sum is lower, the 8th number must be negative. So the 8th number is 96 minus 105, but wait, that's negative. Let me think carefully.

Let me represent this with variables. Let S be the sum of the first 7 numbers. So S = 7 * 15 = 105. When I add an 8th number, let's call it x, the new sum becomes S + x. The new mean is (S + x)/8 = 12. So S + x = 12 * 8 = 96.

So substituting S as 105, I have 105 + x = 96. Solving for x: x = 96 - 105 = -9. So the 8th number is -9.

Looking at the options, option B is -9. So the correct answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total sum of the first 7 numbers. Since the mean is 15, the sum is:

\[
\text{Sum of 7 numbers} = 7 \times 15 = 105
\]

When an 8th number is added, the mean of the 8 numbers becomes 12. Therefore, the new total sum is:

\[
\text{Sum of 8 numbers} = 8 \times 12 = 96
\]

The 8th number can be found by subtracting the original sum from the new sum:

\[
\text{8th number} = 96 - 105 = -9
\]

Thus, the 8th number is \(-9\), which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
