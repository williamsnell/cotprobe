Okay, so I've got this question about the monetary tools of the Federal Reserve, and I need to figure out which option isn't one of them. Let's see... I remember that the Fed uses several tools to influence the economy. The main ones I can think of are open market operations, the discount rate, and reserve requirements.

Option A is changing the reserve ratio. Yeah, that sounds familiar. The Fed can change the percentage of reserves that banks must hold, which affects how much they can lend. So that's definitely a tool they use.

Option B is changing the discount rate. I'm pretty sure the discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans. So yes, adjusting that is another tool.

Option C is increasing the federal funds rate. Wait, the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed doesn't directly set this, but they influence it through their tools, like open market operations. So when the Fed sells securities, it can increase the federal funds rate. So C is related to their tools.

Options D and E are about selling or buying Treasury securities. Oh right, that's open market operations. When the Fed sells securities to banks, it reduces the banks' reserves and can increase interest rates. Buying them injects money into the system. So D and E are both tools they use.

Now, option F: changing tariffs and quotas. Tariffs and quotas are trade policies, right? They're used to control imports and exports. Those are tools of fiscal policy, not monetary. The Fed doesn't handle trade policies; that's more the realm of the executive branch or Congress, like setting tariffs. So F isn't a monetary tool.

So the question is asking which is not a tool. The answer should be F.

The monetary tools of the Federal Reserve include changing the reserve ratio (A), changing the discount rate (B), influencing the federal funds rate (C), and conducting open market operations through selling (D) or buying (E) Treasury securities. However, changing tariffs and quotas (F) pertains to trade policy and is not a monetary tool of the Federal Reserve. 

Answer: F
