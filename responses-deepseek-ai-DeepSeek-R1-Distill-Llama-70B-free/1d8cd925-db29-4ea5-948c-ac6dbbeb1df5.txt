Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about elements with partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals. It's asking which one is the exception, meaning it doesn't have partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals.

The options are A: Eu, B: Gd, C: Am, D: Cu.

Hmm, I remember that the f-block elements are the lanthanides and actinides. The lanthanides have 4f orbitals, and the actinides have 5f. So the question is about elements that have partially filled orbitals in either of these.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Eu. I think Eu is Europium. Europium is a lanthanide, right? So it should have 4f electrons. What's its electron configuration? Europium has atomic number 63. Let me recall: the lanthanides start at cerium (58) and go up. Europium would be Eu, so its configuration is [Xe] 4f^7 6s^2 maybe? So the 4f is partially filled, so it's included. So Eu has partially filled 4f, so it's not the exception.

Option B: Gd. That's Gadolinium. Also a lanthanide, atomic number 64. Its electron configuration is [Xe] 4f^7 5d^1 6s^2? Wait, no, wait. Gadolinium is after Eu. So Eu is 63, Gd is 64. So Eu has 4f^6? Or 4f^7? Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think again. The filling order for lanthanides: each element adds an electron to the 4f orbital. So starting from Ce (58) as 4f^1, then Pr (59) 4f^2, Nd (60) 4f^3, Pm (61) 4f^4, Sm (62) 4f^5, Eu (63) 4f^6? Or 4f^7? Wait, I'm a bit shaky here. Alternatively, maybe Eu is 4f^6 6s^2? Because I remember that Eu has a +2 oxidation state commonly, which would mean losing two electrons from the 6s orbital, leaving the 4f electrons. So if Eu is 4f^6, then that's partially filled. So Gd, which is next, would have 4f^7? Because 63 is Eu, 4f^6, then 64 is Gd with 4f^7, and perhaps a 5d electron. So Gd has 4f^7, which is still partially filled because the 4f can hold up to 14 electrons. So Gd has partially filled 4f, so it's included, not the exception.

Option C: Am. That's Americium. Americium is an actinide, right? Actinides have 5f orbitals. So Am is element 95. Let me think about its electron configuration. Actinides start at Thorium (90) with 5f^0 (I think), then Protactinium (91) 5f^1, Uranium (92) 5f^3, then Np (93) 5f^4, Pu (94) 5f^6, Am (95) 5f^7. So Am has 5f^7, which is partially filled. So it's included, meaning it's not the exception.

Option D: Cu. Copper. Hmm. Copper is a transition metal, right? It's in the d-block. Its atomic number is 29. Electron configuration is [Ar] 3d^10 4s^1 or 4s^2? Wait, copper has an electron configuration where the 3d is filled. The normal would be 3d^9 4s^2, but copper actually has 3d^10 4s^1 because of the stability of the filled d subshell. So for copper, the 4f orbital isn't filled at all. Because f orbitals come after d. So 4f would be in the same period as 5s, which comes after 4d. So 4f starts filling around lanthanum and cerium. So copper is much earlier. So copper doesn't have any 4f electrons. Similarly, 5f is way beyond, so no 5f electrons either. So copper doesn't have partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals. So it's the exception.

So the question is which one is the exception. So the correct answer is D: Cu.

The question asks which element does not have partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **A: Eu (Europium)**: Europium is a lanthanide with atomic number 63. Its electron configuration is [Xe] 4f⁶ 6s², meaning it has partially filled 4f orbitals. Therefore, it is included and not the exception.

- **B: Gd (Gadolinium)**: Gadolinium is also a lanthanide with atomic number 64. Its electron configuration is [Xe] 4f⁷ 5d¹ 6s², so it has partially filled 4f orbitals. Thus, it is included and not the exception.

- **C: Am (Americium)**: Americium is an actinide with atomic number 95. Its electron configuration is [Rn] 5f⁷ 7s², meaning it has partially filled 5f orbitals. Therefore, it is included and not the exception.

- **D: Cu (Copper)**: Copper is a transition metal with atomic number 29. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹, meaning it does not have any 4f or 5f electrons. As a result, it does not have partially filled 4f or 5f orbitals and is the exception.

The correct answer is **D: Cu**.
