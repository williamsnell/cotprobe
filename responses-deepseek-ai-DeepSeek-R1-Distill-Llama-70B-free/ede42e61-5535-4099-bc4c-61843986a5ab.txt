Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jane's quiz scores, and I need to find her mean score. Hmm, mean is average, right? So I think I need to add up all her scores and then divide by how many there are.

Let me look at the scores again. They are 98, 97, 92, 85, and 93. So that's five scores total. I should add them up first.

Starting with 98 and 97. 98 plus 97 is... let me think. 98 plus 90 is 188, and then plus 7 more is 195. So 195 so far.

Next is 92. Adding that to 195. 195 plus 90 is 285, plus 2 is 287. Now the total is 287.

Then comes 85. Adding that to 287. 287 plus 80 is 367, plus 5 is 372. So now the total is 372.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait, because I added 98+97=195, then +92=287, then +85=372. But wait, I think I missed the last score, which is 93. Oh right, because the scores are five in total. So after adding 85, I have to add 93 as well.

So 372 plus 93. Let me break it down. 372 plus 90 is 462, then plus 3 is 465. So the total sum of all her scores is 465.

Now, since there are five quizzes, the mean is the total divided by 5. So 465 divided by 5. Let me do that division.

5 goes into 465 how many times? 5 times 90 is 450, which leaves 15. 5 goes into 15 three times. So 90 plus 3 is 93. So 93 is the mean.

Wait wait, but let me double-check my addition because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's add them again:

98 + 97 = 195.

195 +92= 287.

287 +85= 372.

372 +93=465.

Yes, that's correct. So 465 divided by 5 is indeed 93.

Looking back at the options, option F is 93. So that should be the answer.

The mean score is calculated by summing all the quiz scores and dividing by the number of scores. Jane's scores are 98, 97, 92, 85, and 93. Adding them together:

98 + 97 = 195  
195 + 92 = 287  
287 + 85 = 372  
372 + 93 = 465  

The total sum is 465. Since there are 5 scores, the mean is:

465 รท 5 = 93  

Thus, Jane's mean score is 93. The correct option is F.

Answer: F
