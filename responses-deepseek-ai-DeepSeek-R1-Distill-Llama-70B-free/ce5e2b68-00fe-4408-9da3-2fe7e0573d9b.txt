Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about belt drives and whether the belt will slip based on certain conditions. Hmm, I remember that belt slip has to do with the maximum power that can be transmitted without slipping. If the required power exceeds this maximum, the belt slips.

The problem gives me an engine running at 1100 rpm, which drives a line shaft with a belt. The engine pulley has a diameter of 9 inches, and it needs to transmit 25 horsepower. The coefficient of friction between the belt and pulley is 0.25. I need to check for two angles of contact: 150 degrees and 100 degrees.

I think the key here is to calculate the maximum horsepower the belt can transmit without slipping for each angle and see if 25 hp is within that limit. If the required power is higher than the maximum, then the belt will slip.

Wait, how do I calculate the maximum power? Oh right, the formula for maximum power transmitted by a belt is:

Power (P) = (T1 - T2) * v

Where T1 is the tension on the tight side, T2 on the slack side, and v is the belt speed.

But another formula I remember relates the maximum power to the angle of contact. Oh right, the maximum power a belt can transmit without slipping is given by:

P_max = (μ * θ) * (π/180) * (D * N)^2 / (184000)

Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Another approach: the power transmitted depends on the belt tension and the speed. The belt speed v can be calculated from the pulley diameter and rpm.

The pulley diameter is 9 inches, so radius r is 4.5 inches. But wait, for linear speed, v = π * D * N / 60, right? Because D is in inches, N in rpm. So v in inches per minute would be π * 9 * 1100 / 60. Let me compute that.

v = (π * 9 * 1100) / 60
= (9 * 1100) / 60 * π
Let me compute 9*1100 = 9900. 9900/60 is 165. So v = 165π inches per minute. But wait, to convert to feet per minute, since 1 foot is 12 inches. So 165π inches is 165/12 = 13.75 ft/min approximately? Wait, no, 165 inches is 13.75 feet, but since it's per minute, v is 165π inches per minute, which is (165/12) * π feet per minute, so about 13.75 * π ft/min. But maybe I should keep it in inches for the calculations.

Wait, I think the formula for maximum power is P_max = (μ * θ (in radians)) * (T) * v, where T is the belt tension. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the standard formula for maximum power without slip is:

P_max = (μ * θ (rad)) * (k) * (N^2 * D^2) / (184000)

Wait, another formula I recall is that the maximum horsepower that can be transmitted without slip is given by:

HP_max = (μ * θ_rad) * (D^2 * N^2) / (184000)

Where D is in inches, N is in rpm, θ_rad is in radians, and μ is the coefficient of friction.

Let me check the units. D is in inches, N in rpm, so D*N is inches per minute? Wait, no, inches * rpm would be a bit odd. Hmm, perhaps the formula is correct when considering the appropriate unit conversions.

So, first, I need to convert the angle of contact from degrees to radians. For part (a), θ is 150 degrees. So radians would be 150 * (π/180) ≈ 2.61799 radians. For part (b), 100 degrees is about 1.745 radians.

So for each angle, compute HP_max and see if it's greater than 25 HP. If HP_max is greater than 25, then no slip. If less, then slip occurs.

Let me compute HP_max for both angles.

μ is 0.25. D is 9 inches, N is 1100 rpm.

So HP_max = (0.25 * θ_rad) * (9^2 * 1100^2) / 184000

Let's compute this step by step.

First, calculate 9^2: 81.

1100^2 is 1,210,000.

So 81 * 1,210,000 = let's compute that. 81 * 1.21e6 = 81 * 1.21 * 1e6. 81 * 1.21 = 98.01. So 98.01e6, which is 98,010,000.

Now, multiply by μ and theta_rad.

So for θ = 150 degrees (2.61799 radians):

HP_max = 0.25 * 2.61799 * 98,010,000 / 184,000.

Wait, let me compute numerator first: 0.25 * 2.61799 ≈ 0.6545. Then multiply by 98,010,000:

0.6545 * 98,010,000 = ?

Let me compute 98,010,000 * 0.6545.

Approximately, 98,010,000 * 0.6 is 58,806,000.

98,010,000 * 0.05 is 4,900,500.

98,010,000 * 0.0045 is 441,045.

So adding them: 58,806,000 +4,900,500 =63,706,500 +441,045 =64,147,545.

So numerator is about 64,147,545.

Now divide by 184,000.

64,147,545 / 184,000 ≈ ?

Let me compute 64,147,545 ÷ 184,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 64,147.545 / 184 ≈ 348.8.

So approximately 348.8 HP.

Wait, that's way higher than 25 HP. So for 150 degrees, the maximum power is about 348 HP, so 25 is well within. So no slip.

Now for part (b), θ is 100 degrees, which is 1.745 radians.

HP_max = 0.25 * 1.745 * 98,010,000 / 184,000.

Compute 0.25 * 1.745 = 0.43625.

Multiply by 98,010,000: 0.43625 * 98,010,000.

Let me compute 98,010,000 * 0.4 is 39,204,000.

98,010,000 * 0.03625 = ?

0.03625 is 3/83 approximately. Wait, 0.03625 is 3.625% of 98 million.

So 1% is 980,100. So 3.625% is 3.625 * 980,100 = let's compute.

3 * 980,100 = 2,940,300.

0.625 * 980,100 = 612,562.5.

So total 2,940,300 + 612,562.5 = 3,552,862.5.

So 0.43625 * 98 million is 39,204,000 +3,552,862.5 =42,756,862.5.

Now divide by 184,000.

42,756,862.5 / 184,000 ≈ ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 1k: 42,756.8625 / 184.

42,756.8625 ÷ 184 ≈ 232.6.

So HP_max is approximately 232.6.

Again, 25 HP is much less than 232, so no slip in this case as well.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Both 150 and 100 degrees have HP_max way higher than 25, so the belt won't slip in either case.

Looking back at the options, option G says the belt will not slip at both angles. So the answer should be G.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because the numbers seem too high. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula I used is HP_max = (μ * θ_rad) * (D² N²) / 184000.

Wait, is that correct? I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: The power transmitted by a belt is given by P = T (tight) * v, where v is the belt speed in ft/min.

But the maximum tension difference (T1 - T2) is determined by the coefficient of friction and the angle of contact.

The formula for the maximum tension ratio is (T1/T2) = e^(μθ), where θ is in radians.

Assuming the belt is just about to slip, T1 = μ T2 * something. Wait, actually, the tension ratio T1/T2 = e^(μθ), so the difference T1 - T2 = T2 (e^(μθ) - 1).

But without knowing the actual tensions, perhaps it's easier to use the HP_max formula I used earlier.

Wait, maybe the formula is HP_max = (μ θ_rad) * (k) * (N D)^2 / 184000, where k is a constant. Let me check the units.

Wait, another formula I found online is:

HP = (F × v) / 33000, where F is the force in pounds and v in feet per minute.

But the maximum force is related to the belt tensions. The maximum difference in tension is F = T1 - T2 = T2 (e^(μθ) - 1).

But perhaps using the formula HP_max = (μ θ) (D^2 N^2) / (184000) is correct.

Wait, let me recompute for 150 degrees.

θ = 150 degrees = 5π/6 radians ≈ 2.618.

So:

HP_max = (0.25 * 2.618) * (9^2 * 1100^2) / 184000.

Compute 9^2 = 81; 1100^2 = 1,210,000.

Multiply 81 * 1,210,000 = 98,010,000.

Multiply by 0.25 * 2.618 = 0.6545.

So 98,010,000 * 0.6545 = approx 64,147,000.

Divide by 184,000:

64,147,000 / 184,000 ≈ 348.5 HP.

Yes, same as before.

Similarly, for 100 degrees, 1.745 radians:

0.25 * 1.745 = 0.43625.

Multiply by 98,010,000: 42,756,862.5.

Divide by 184,000: ≈232.6 HP.

Wait, so in both cases, the maximum HP is way above 25. So 25 HP is well within, so no slip occurs in either case.

So the answer would be option G: The belt will not slip at both 150° and 100°.

Looking at the options, option G is correct.
</think>

To determine whether the belt will slip, we calculate the maximum horsepower (HP_max) that can be transmitted without slipping for each angle of contact and compare it to the required power (25 HP). The formula used is:

\[
HP_{\text{max}} = \frac{\mu \cdot \theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot (D^2 \cdot N^2)}{184,000}
\]

Where:
- \( \mu = 0.25 \) (coefficient of friction),
- \( \theta_{\text{rad}} \) is the angle of contact in radians,
- \( D = 9 \, \text{inches} \) (pulley diameter),
- \( N = 1100 \, \text{rpm} \) (engine speed).

### Step 1: Convert angles to radians
- For \( 150^\circ \): \( \theta_{\text{rad}} = \frac{150 \cdot \pi}{180} \approx 2.618 \, \text{radians} \),
- For \( 100^\circ \): \( \theta_{\text{rad}} = \frac{100 \cdot \pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \, \text{radians} \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( HP_{\text{max}} \) for each angle
1. **For \( 150^\circ \):**
   \[
   HP_{\text{max}} = \frac{0.25 \cdot 2.618 \cdot (9^2 \cdot 1100^2)}{184,000}
   \]
   - \( 9^2 = 81 \), \( 1100^2 = 1,210,000 \),
   - \( 81 \cdot 1,210,000 = 98,010,000 \),
   - \( 0.25 \cdot 2.618 = 0.6545 \),
   - \( 0.6545 \cdot 98,010,000 = 64,147,545 \),
   - \( \frac{64,147,545}{184,000} \approx 348.8 \, \text{HP} \).

2. **For \( 100^\circ \):**
   \[
   HP_{\text{max}} = \frac{0.25 \cdot 1.745 \cdot (9^2 \cdot 1100^2)}{184,000}
   \]
   - \( 0.25 \cdot 1.745 = 0.43625 \),
   - \( 0.43625 \cdot 98,010,000 = 42,756,862.5 \),
   - \( \frac{42,756,862.5}{184,000} \approx 232.6 \, \text{HP} \).

### Step 3: Compare \( HP_{\text{max}} \) with the required power
- For \( 150^\circ \): \( HP_{\text{max}} \approx 348.8 \, \text{HP} \), which is much greater than \( 25 \, \text{HP} \). No slip occurs.
- For \( 100^\circ \): \( HP_{\text{max}} \approx 232.6 \, \text{HP} \), which is also much greater than \( 25 \, \text{HP} \). No slip occurs.

### Conclusion
Since \( HP_{\text{max}} \) is greater than \( 25 \, \text{HP} \) for both angles of contact, the belt will not slip at either \( 150^\circ \) or \( 100^\circ \).

The correct answer is **G: The belt will not slip at both 150° and 100°**.
