Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a container ship and figuring out how much weight of containers can be added before the draft reaches a certain point. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a ship is floating, it displaces water equal to its own weight. So, the principle of buoyancy says that the weight of the displaced water equals the weight of the ship plus whatever cargo it's carrying. Right.

The question gives me some numbers. The cross-sectional area at the waterline is 3,000 m² when the draft is 9 meters. Then, they're asking how much weight of containers can be added before the normal draft of 9.2 meters is reached. Oh, and the water is saltwater with a weight density of 10 kN/m³.

Wait, cross-sectional area at the waterline—so I think that's the area of the part of the ship that's under the water. Since the ship floats, the submerged part displaces water. So, the cross-sectional area would relate to the volume of water displaced.

I need to find the additional weight the ship can carry when the draft increases from 9m to 9.2m. So the change in draft is 0.2 meters.

Let me visualize this. The cross-sectional area is given, so if the draft increases by a small amount, the volume of water displaced will increase by that area multiplied by the change in draft. Because the cross-sectional area is the same along the length of the ship, I suppose.

Wait, or is the cross-sectional area the area at the waterline, meaning that as the ship settles deeper into the water, the actual shape might change? Oh, but for small changes in draft, maybe we can approximate the volume change as the area times the change in draft. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the volume increase would be the cross-sectional area multiplied by the change in draft. Let me write that down.

Volume change (ΔV) = cross-sectional area (A) * change in draft (Δd)

Given:
A = 3000 m²
Δd = 9.2 m - 9 m = 0.2 m

So ΔV = 3000 * 0.2 = 600 m³.

Now, the weight of the displaced water is equal to the weight of the containers added. The weight density of saltwater is 10 kN/m³, so the weight of the displaced water (which equals the weight of the containers) is:

Weight (W) = ΔV * density

So W = 600 m³ * 10 kN/m³ = 6000 kN.

Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 6000kN. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check if I did everything right. The cross-sectional area is given at the initial draft, 9m. So when the draft increases by 0.2m, the added volume is the area multiplied by that 0.2m. Yeah, that makes sense because the ship is getting longer in the water. So, the displaced volume increases by that much.

And the density of saltwater is 10 kN/m³, so each cubic meter adds 10kN of displaced water, which translates to the weight the ship can carry. So 600 m³ * 10 = 6000 kN. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I missed anything here. So the answer should be E: 6000kN.

To determine how much weight of containers can be added to the ship before the draft reaches 9.2 m, we use the principle of buoyancy. The weight of the displaced water equals the weight of the containers added. 

1. **Given Data**:
   - Cross-sectional area at the waterline (\(A\)) = \(3000 \, \text{m}^2\)
   - Initial draft (\(d_1\)) = \(9 \, \text{m}\)
   - Final draft (\(d_2\)) = \(9.2 \, \text{m}\)
   - Weight density of saltwater (\(\rho\)) = \(10 \, \text{kN/m}^3\)

2. **Change in Draft**:
   \[
   \Delta d = d_2 - d_1 = 9.2 \, \text{m} - 9 \, \text{m} = 0.2 \, \text{m}
   \]

3. **Change in Volume of Displaced Water**:
   The additional volume of water displaced is approximately the cross-sectional area multiplied by the change in draft:
   \[
   \Delta V = A \cdot \Delta d = 3000 \, \text{m}^2 \cdot 0.2 \, \text{m} = 600 \, \text{m}^3
   \]

4. **Weight of Containers**:
   The weight of the displaced water equals the weight of the containers. Using the weight density of saltwater:
   \[
   W = \Delta V \cdot \rho = 600 \, \text{m}^3 \cdot 10 \, \text{kN/m}^3 = 6000 \, \text{kN}
   \]

Thus, the weight of containers that can be added before the draft reaches 9.2 m is **6000 kN**.
