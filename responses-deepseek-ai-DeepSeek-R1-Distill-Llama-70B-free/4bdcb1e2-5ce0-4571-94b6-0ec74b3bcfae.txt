Okay, so I have this problem about frequency modulation, and I need to find the correct expression for the new modulated signal after some changes. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in frequency modulation (FM), the general form of the modulated signal is something like v(t) = A_c * cos(2πf_c t + β * m(t)), where A_c is the carrier amplitude, f_c is the carrier frequency, β is the modulation index, and m(t) is the modulating signal. Oh wait, actually, I think the phase term is usually written with the integral of the modulating signal, but maybe in this case, it's simplified because the modulating signal is sinusoidal.

The initial setup is a carrier with amplitude 4 volts and frequency f_c = 2 MHz. So f_c is 2,000,000 Hz. The modulating signal is m(t) = sin(1000π t), which I think has a frequency of 1000/(2π) Hz? Wait, no, the general form of a sine wave is sin(2πf t), so if it's sin(1000π t), that would be sin(2π * (500) t), so the frequency is 500 Hz. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's see: 1000π t = 2π * f * t. Solving for f gives f = 1000π / (2π) ) = 500 Hz. So the initial modulating frequency is 500 Hz. Oh wait, but the problem says the modulating signal is m(t) = sin(1000π t), so that's a 500 Hz signal, right?

The amplitude of the modulating signal is 2 volts, and the frequency deviation is 1 kHz. Oh, frequency deviation Δf is 1 kHz, which is 1000 Hz. So the modulation index β is Δf divided by the frequency of the modulating signal. Wait, the modulation index is usually β = Δf / f_m, where f_m is the modulating frequency. So initial β is 1000 Hz / 500 Hz = 2. So β is 2.

So the initial modulated signal would be v(t) = 4 cos(2π * 2e6 t + β * sin(2π f_m t)). Wait, but in the options, I see expressions like 4 cos(4π × 1e6 t + ... ), which would be 2π * 2e6 t = 4πe6 t. So yes, the carrier term is 4πe6 t.

Wait, let me think again. The carrier frequency is 2 MHz, which is 2e6 Hz. So the carrier's angular frequency is ω_c = 2π * 2e6 = 4πe6 rad/s. So the carrier term is 4πe6 t.

Now, the modulating signal is m(t) = sin(1000π t) = sin(2π * 500 t), so f_m is 500 Hz. The frequency deviation Δf is 1 kHz, so the modulation index β is Δf / f_m = 1000 / 500 = 2.

So the phase modulation term is β * m(t) = 2 * sin(1000π t). So the initial modulated signal is v(t) = 4 cos(4πe6 t + 2 sin(1000π t)).

But wait, the question is about changing the modulating signal's amplitude and frequency. The new amplitude is 8 volts, and the new frequency is 2 kHz. So the new modulating signal is m'(t) = sin(2π * 2000 t) = sin(4000π t), since 2π * 2000 = 4000π. Wait, wait, 2π f t where f is 2000 Hz. So m'(t) = sin(4000π t).

Wait no, 2π * 2000 Hz is 4000π rad/s. So m'(t) = sin(4000π t). But wait, the amplitude of the modulating signal was 2 V before and now is 8 V. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the modulating signal's amplitude is 2 volts initially, and it's increased to 8 volts. So the new m'(t) has an amplitude of 8 volts. So m'(t) = 8 sin(4000π t), perhaps?

Wait, but in FM, the amplitude of the modulating signal affects the frequency deviation. Because the frequency deviation Δf is equal to β * A_m, where A_m is the amplitude of the modulating signal. Or wait, no, I think the relation is β = Δf / f_m. So when the amplitude of m(t) changes, that affects the maximum frequency deviation.

Wait, no, β is defined as the ratio of the frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. So β = Δf / f_m. But the maximum phase deviation is β times the maximum amplitude of m(t). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with phase modulation versus frequency modulation.

Wait, in FM, the instantaneous frequency is f_c + Δf * m(t). So the frequency deviation is proportional to the modulating signal. So if the amplitude of m(t) is A_m, then the maximum frequency deviation is Δf = β * A_m?

Wait no, actually, in the standard equation for FM, the frequency deviation Δf is equal to the modulation index multiplied by the modulating frequency. Or wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. The standard FM equation is:

v(t) = A_c cos(2πf_c t + β sin(2πf_m t))

where β is the modulation index, and β = (Δf) / f_m.

So if β is fixed, then increasing the modulating frequency f_m would require Δf to increase proportionally. But in this problem, the modulating frequency is changing, and the amplitude is also changing.

Wait, but in the problem statement, when the amplitude and frequency of the modulating signal are increased, what happens to the frequency deviation? Oh wait, in the problem, the initial frequency deviation was given as 1 kHz. Now, if the modulating signal's amplitude is increased to 8 volts from 2 volts, and the frequency is increased to 2 kHz from 500 Hz, how does this affect the new frequency deviation?

Wait, the problem states that the amplitude of the modulating signal is increased to 8 volts and the frequency to 2 kHz. So what is the new Δf?

Hmm, I think I need to recalculate β. Wait, in the initial scenario, β was 2. Because the initial frequency deviation was 1 kHz, and the initial modulating frequency was 500 Hz. So β = 1000 / 500 = 2.

But now, the modulating frequency f_m is 2000 Hz. If the same β applies, then the new Δf would be β * f_m = 2 * 2000 = 4000 Hz. But wait, does β stay the same?

Wait, wait, no. The modulation index β is defined as the maximum frequency deviation divided by the modulating frequency. So β = Δf / f_m. So if the problem doesn't mention changing β, but changes the modulating signal's amplitude and frequency, perhaps β changes.

Wait, but in the initial case, the amplitude of m(t) was 2 volts, and the frequency deviation was 1 kHz. So maybe the frequency deviation is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal.

Wait, I think in FM, the frequency deviation Δf is equal to the modulation index times the modulating signal's amplitude. Or is it that the maximum frequency deviation is equal to β times the modulating frequency?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me clarify:

In FM, the instantaneous frequency is given by:

f(t) = f_c + Δf * m(t)

where m(t) is the modulating signal, which is typically a normalized waveform (like between -1 and 1). So if m(t) has amplitude A_m, then the maximum frequency deviation would be Δf_max = Δf * A_m.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because if m(t) is sin(2πf_mt), which has amplitude 1, then the maximum frequency deviation would be Δf. So if the modulating signal's amplitude is A_m, then the maximum frequency deviation would be Δf * A_m.

Wait, but that's not how it's usually defined. Normally, the modulating signal is assumed to be normalized (like amplitude 1), and Δf is the maximum frequency deviation. So if the modulating signal's amplitude is A_m, then you need to scale it accordingly.

Alternatively, the general formula is:

v(t) = A_c cos(2πf_c t + (Δf / f_m) * A_m sin(2πf_m t))

Wait, maybe. Because the modulation index β is Δf / f_m, and the argument would be β * A_m sin(...). Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The standard formula when the modulating signal is m(t) with amplitude A_m is:

v(t) = A_c cos(2πf_c t + β m(t))

where β is the modulation index. But sometimes, β is defined as (Δf / f_m), where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation. So if m(t) has amplitude A_m, then the maximum phase deviation is β * A_m. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, suppose the modulating signal is m(t) = A_m sin(2πf_m t). Then the maximum value of m(t) is A_m. So the phase term would be β * m(t) = β A_m sin(...). And the maximum phase deviation is β A_m.

But in the context of FM, the frequency deviation is given by Δf = (β A_m) * f_m ?

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me look for a formula.

Wait, another approach: The instantaneous frequency in FM is f_c + Δf * m(t). Since m(t) is a sinusoidal signal with amplitude A_m, the maximum frequency deviation is Δf * A_m. So the maximum Δf_total is Δf * A_m.

Wait, but in the standard case, when m(t) is taken as a normalized signal (A_m =1), the maximum Δf is just Δf.

So perhaps when the problem says the amplitude of the modulating signal is 2 volts, and frequency deviation is 1 kHz, that 1 kHz is the maximum Δf, so Δf = A_m * β * f_m? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the modulated signal. The general expression for an FM signal is:

v(t) = A_c cos[2πf_c t + β sin(2πf_m t)]

where β is the modulation index, defined as β = Δf / f_m.

In this initial case, the modulating signal is m(t) = sin(1000π t). Wait, that's 500 Hz. So f_m_initial = 500 Hz. The amplitude of m(t) is 2 V, but in the formula, the sine function is unit amplitude. So if our m(t) is 2 sin(...), does that affect β?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up two things: the amplitude of the modulating signal and the modulation index. Let me think again.

Suppose the modulating signal is v_m(t) = A_m sin(2πf_m t). The maximum frequency deviation is Δf = β * f_m.

But in the formula for the FM signal, the phase term is β * (v_m(t)/A_m) * 2π f_m t? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the frequency deviation is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal.

In the initial case:

v_m(t) = 2 sin(2π * 500 t)

Frequency deviation Δf_initial = 1 kHz.

So Δf_initial = (β_initial) * f_m_initial.

β_initial = Δf_initial / f_m_initial = 1000 / 500 = 2.

So the initial modulated signal is v(t) = 4 cos(4πe6 t + β_initial * v_m(t)).

Wait, but v_m(t) is 2 sin(...). So β_initial * v_m(t) would be 2 * 2 sin(...) = 4 sin(...). So the phase term is 4 sin(1000π t).

Wait, but in general, the FM signal is expressed as v(t) = A_c cos(2πf_c t + β sin(2πf_m t)).

Wait, but in that case, the β would be Δf / f_m. So if the modulating signal has amplitude A_m, then the phase term would be (Δf / f_m) * A_m sin(2πf_m t).

Wait, maybe. Let me try to clarify.

Suppose the modulating signal is v_m(t) = A_m sin(2πf_m t).

The frequency deviation is given by Δf = (β) * f_m. So β = Δf / f_m.

The phase term in the FM signal is then β * v_m(t) = (Δf / f_m) * A_m sin(2πf_m t).

So the overall signal is:

v(t) = A_c cos(2πf_c t + (Δf A_m / f_m) sin(2πf_m t)).

Wait, but that doesn't seem quite right, because if A_m increases, Δf would increase as well, since Δf = (β f_m). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the maximum frequency deviation Δf is equal to the modulation index β multiplied by the modulating frequency f_m.

So, β = Δf / f_m.

In this case, when the modulating signal's amplitude increases, does β change? Or is β a function of the modulating signal's amplitude?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the problem again.

After the change, the modulating signal's amplitude is 8 V (up from 2 V), and the frequency is 2 kHz (up from 500 Hz). I need to find the new modulated signal.

In the initial setup, the frequency deviation was 1 kHz when the modulating amplitude was 2 V and frequency 500 Hz.

Assuming that the same modulation index β is used, which was β = Δf / f_m = 1000 / 500 = 2.

Now, with the new parameters:

f_m_new = 2000 Hz.

If β remains the same, then the new Δf would be β * f_m_new = 2 * 2000 = 4000 Hz.

But wait, the problem says the amplitude and frequency of the modulating signal are increased. So perhaps the amplitude of the modulating signal affects the frequency deviation.

Wait, in the initial case, the modulating signal's amplitude was 2 V, which led to a frequency deviation of 1 kHz. So the relationship might be Δf = (A_m / A_ref) * Δf_initial, where A_ref is some reference amplitude.

Alternatively, since the amplitude quadruples (from 2 to 8 V), the frequency deviation would also quadruple, from 1 kHz to 4 kHz, assuming linearity. But wait, initially, the frequency deviation was 1 kHz for 2 V. So 8 V would give (8/2)*1 kHz = 4 kHz.

But then the modulating frequency is 2 kHz now, so β would be Δf / f_m = 4000 / 2000 = 2. So same β as before.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the modulation index is the ratio of frequency deviation to modulating frequency. So increasing both the frequency deviation and the modulating frequency by the same factor would keep β the same.

So with the new parameters:

A_c remains 4 V. The new modulating signal is m(t) = 8 sin(2π * 2000 t) = 8 sin(4000π t).

The frequency deviation is Δf = 4 kHz (since (8V / 2V) * 1 kHz = 4 kHz).

So the new modulation index β is Δf / f_m = 4000 / 2000 = 2, same as before.

So the new modulated signal would be v(t) = 4 cos(4πe6 t + 2 * (8 sin(4000π t))).

Wait, no. Wait, in the initial case, the phase term was β * m(t). So if m(t) has an amplitude of 8 V, then the phase term is β * 8 sin(...).

Wait, but in the initial case, m(t) was 2 V amplitude, and the phase term was 2 * 2 sin(...), which is 4 sin(...). So in the new case, with m(t) being 8 V and β still 2, the phase term is 2 * 8 sin(...) = 16 sin(...).

Wait, that can't be right because looking at the answer options, none of them have 16 except option E and J. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 4 cos(4πe6 t + 16 sin(... 2000t)).

Option J: 4 cos(4πe6 t + 8 sin(... 2000t)).

Wait, but wait: in the initial case, the phase term was 2 * sin(1000π t) because m(t) was 2 sin(...), so β=2, so 2 * 2 =4? No, initial phase term was 2 sin(1000π t). Let me recheck.

Wait, initial m(t) is 2 sin(1000π t). The phase term is β * m(t) = 2 * 2 sin(1000π t) = 4 sin(1000π t). So the initial modulated signal was 4 cos(4πe6 t + 4 sin(1000π t)).

But none of the options exactly match that. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the phase term is just β times the sine term, without considering the amplitude of m(t). Because in the standard formula, m(t) is taken as a unit amplitude. So if m(t) has amplitude A_m, then the phase term would be β * A_m * sin(...). Because in the standard formula, the sine is multiplied by β, assuming m(t) is unit amplitude.

So, in the initial case, m(t) = 2 sin(1000π t). So the phase term would be β * (2 sin(...)) = 2 * 2 sin(...) = 4 sin(...), as I thought earlier.

So after the change, m(t) =8 sin(4000π t), so the
