Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question says that x and y are inversely proportional. Hmm, I remember that inverse proportionality means that as one increases, the other decreases proportionally. The formula for inverse proportionality is x * y = k, where k is a constant. So, whenever x changes, y changes such that their product remains k.

The problem then states that when the sum of x and y is 42, x is twice y. Let's denote this scenario as the initial condition. So, I can set up two equations based on this information.

First, the sum equation: x + y = 42. And the second equation from the proportionality: x = 2y. So, substituting the second into the first, I get 2y + y = 42. That simplifies to 3y = 42, so y must be 14. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 2y + y is 3y, which equals 42, so y = 14. Then x is 28 because x = 2y, right?

Wait, but let me double-check that. If y is 14, then x is 2 * 14 = 28. Yes, and 28 +14 is 42, so that checks out. So, in this initial condition, x is 28 and y is 14.

Now, because x and y are inversely proportional, their product should be a constant. So, k = x * y. Plugging in the initial values, k = 28 * 14. Let me calculate that. 28 times 10 is 280, and 28 times 4 is 112, so 280 + 112 is 392. So, k is 392.

Now, the question asks for the value of y when x is -8. Since x and y are inversely proportional, their product should still be 392. So, when x is -8, I can set up the equation: (-8) * y = 392. To find y, I'll divide both sides by -8.

So, y = 392 / (-8). Let me compute that. 392 divided by 8 is 49, so 392 divided by -8 is -49. Therefore, y should be -49.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So, inverse proportionality implies x*y = k. At initial state, x=28, y=14, so k=392. Then, when x=-8, y = 392 / (-8) = -49. That makes sense. So the answer should be option F, which is -49.

I'll just go through the steps again to be sure. Sum is 42, x=2y. So 3y=42, y=14, x=28. k=28*14=392. When x=-8, y=392/(-8)=-49. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is F.

The numbers \(x\) and \(y\) are inversely proportional, meaning \(x \cdot y = k\), where \(k\) is a constant. Initially, when \(x + y = 42\) and \(x = 2y\), substituting \(x = 2y\) into \(x + y = 42\) gives \(3y = 42\), so \(y = 14\). Then, \(x = 2y = 28\). The constant \(k\) is calculated as \(k = x \cdot y = 28 \cdot 14 = 392\).

When \(x = -8\), the relationship \(x \cdot y = k\) still holds. Substituting \(x = -8\) into \(x \cdot y = 392\) gives \(-8 \cdot y = 392\). Solving for \(y\), we find \(y = \frac{392}{-8} = -49\).

Thus, the value of \(y\) when \(x = -8\) is \(-49\).
