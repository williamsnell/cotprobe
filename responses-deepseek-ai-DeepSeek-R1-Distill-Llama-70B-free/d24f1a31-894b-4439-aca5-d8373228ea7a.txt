E: Changing the meaning of a word or phrase from one part of the argument to another.

Okay, I need to figure out which option correctly describes the fallacy of style over substance. Hmm, I remember that style over substance is when someone is more focused on how something is presented rather than the actual content or validity of the argument. So it's like when you're convinced because the argument sounds good or is presented in an appealing way, not because it's logically sound or supported by evidence.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Rejecting a claim because it's poorly argued or a fallacy. Wait, isn't that more like the inverse? If someone rejects a claim because it's poorly argued, that's actually a good thing, not a fallacy. Or maybe it's a fallacy if the rejection is based on the presentation rather than the actual validity. I'm not sure. Maybe A isn't the right choice.

Option B: Making a claim based on evidence that's as likely to be false as true. That sounds like using unproven or weak evidence, but I don't think that's specifically style over substance. It might be another fallacy, like insufficient evidence or something else.

Option C: Making assumptions about a group based on a few individuals. Oh, that's the hasty generalization fallacy. So C is not the one.

Option D: Assuming two things occurring together implies causation. That's correlation implying causation, a common fallacy. Not related to style over substance.

Option E: Changing the meaning of a word in an argument. That's equivocation. Not what I'm looking for.

Option F: Confusing figurative and literal language. That's a different issue, maybe a literary fallacy, but not style over substance.

Option G: Assuming what's true of the whole is true of the parts. That's the fallacy of composition. Not relevant here.

Option H: Reasoning that ideas presented appealingly are correct regardless of content. Oh, that sounds right. Style over substance is about being swayed by how the argument is presented rather than its actual merits. So H fits.

Option I: Believing something because an authority says so. That's appeal to authority, another fallacy, but not the one in question.

Option J: Using emotionally charged language without proper argument. That's more about emotional appeals, which is a different fallacy, like appeal to emotion or loaded language.

So the correct answer should be H. It's about the presentation's appeal determining the judgment of the argument's validity, rather than the substance.

The fallacy of style over substance occurs when an argument is judged as correct based on its appealing presentation rather than its actual content or validity. This is best described by option H, which states that ideas presented in an appealing manner are assumed to be correct regardless of the message's content.

H
