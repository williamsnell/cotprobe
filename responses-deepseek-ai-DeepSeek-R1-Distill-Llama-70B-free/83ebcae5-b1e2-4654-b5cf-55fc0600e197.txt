Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistics problem about the weights of trucks. The question says that the weights are normally distributed. I remember that in a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. Also, the standard deviation tells us how spread out the data is.

The problem states that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds, and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds. I think I need to find the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) that fit these percentages.

Hmm, wait. Let me think. If 70% are above 12,000, that means 30% are below. Similarly, 80% above 10,000 means 20% below. So, these points correspond to certain percentiles in the normal distribution. 

I remember that in a normal distribution, the Z-score is calculated using (X - μ)/σ. The Z-score tells us how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean.

So, for X = 12,000 pounds, 30% of the data is below it. That would correspond to the 30th percentile. Similarly, X = 10,000 corresponds to the 20th percentile.

I think I should find the Z-scores for these percentiles. Let me recall the Z-table. The 20th percentile is around Z = -0.84 because the area to the left is 0.20. Similarly, the 30th percentile is Z ≈ -0.52 because the area to the left is 0.30.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Oh right, the Z-scores for the cumulative probabilities. For 0.20, the Z is approximately -0.84, and for 0.30, it's about -0.52.

So, setting up the equations:

For X = 10,000:
Z = (10,000 - μ) / σ = -0.84

For X = 12,000:
Z = (12,000 - μ) / σ = -0.52

Now I have two equations:
1) (10,000 - μ) = -0.84σ
2) (12,000 - μ) = -0.52σ

I can rearrange both equations to express them in terms of μ and σ.

From equation 1:
10,000 - μ = -0.84σ
=> μ = 10,000 + 0.84σ

From equation 2:
12,000 - μ = -0.52σ
=> μ = 12,000 + 0.52σ

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the equations again. Oh wait, no, when you move μ to the other side, the signs change.

Wait, more accurately:

Equation 1: 10,000 = μ - 0.84σ → μ = 10,000 + 0.84σ

Equation 2: 12,000 = μ - 0.52σ → μ = 12,000 + 0.52σ

Wait a minute, that can't be right because if I set both expressions for μ equal, I get:

10,000 + 0.84σ = 12,000 + 0.52σ

Wait, solving this:

10,000 -12,000 = 0.52σ - 0.84σ
-2,000 = (-0.32)σ
So σ = (-2000)/(-0.32) = 2000 / 0.32.

Hmm, 2000 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that: 2000 / 0.32 = 6250. So σ is 6250.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see σ=6250. Let me check my math again.

Wait, 2000 divided by 0.32: 2000 / 0.32. Let me compute it step by step. 0.32 times 6 is 1.92. So 0.32 * 6250 = 2000. Because 6250 * 0.32 = (6250 * 32)/100 = (200,000)/100 = 2000. Yes, correct. So σ is 6250.

Then, plug σ back into one of the equations to find μ. Let's take μ = 12,000 + 0.52σ.

So μ = 12,000 + 0.52 * 6250.

Compute 0.52 * 6250: 6250 * 0.5 is 3125, and 6250 * 0.02 is 125. So 3125 + 125 = 3250. So μ = 12,000 + 3250 = 15,250.

Wait but looking at the options, I don't see 15,250 and 6250. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Options are A to J. Let me scan:

Option D: μ=15,300; σ=6300.

Option F: μ=15,100; σ=6200.

Option H: μ=14,700; σ=6000.

Option E: μ=15,500; σ=6400.

Hmm, none have σ=6250. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the Z-scores. Let me double-check the percentiles.

For 20th percentile (0.20), the Z-score is approximately -0.84. Right.

30th percentile (0.30), Z-score is about -0.52. Let me confirm: the cumulative probability for Z=-0.52 is about 0.30, yes.

So my equations were correct. So solving gives σ=6250 and μ=15,250.

Wait, but the options don't have this combination. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the percentiles. Because if 70% are above 12,000, that means 30% are below. So 12,000 is the 30th percentile. Similarly, 80% above 10,000 means 20% below, so 10,000 is the 20th percentile. So my initial setup was correct.

Wait, perhaps the Z-scores I used were incorrect. Let me check a Z-table again.

Wait, the Z-score for 0.20 is indeed about -0.84, and for 0.30, it's about -0.52. So that part should be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the equations differently. Wait, when X is at the 20th percentile, the area to the left is 0.20. So Z = -0.84.

So (10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.84 → 10,000 - μ = -0.84σ → μ = 10,000 + 0.84σ.

Similarly, (12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.52 → 12,000 - μ = -0.52σ → μ = 12,000 + 0.52σ.

Setting them equal: 10,000 + 0.84σ = 12,000 + 0.52σ → 0.32σ = 2000 → σ = 6250.

So that part is correct. μ = 12,000 + 0.52 * 6250 = 12,000 + (0.5 *6250) + (0.02*6250) → 3125 + 125 = 3250 → 12,000 + 3250 = 15,250.

So μ=15,250 and σ=6250.

Looking again, none of the options have exactly 6250 for σ. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, did I miscalculate 0.52 *6250?

Wait, 6250 * 0.52 is 6250 * (0.5 + 0.02) = 3125 + 125=3250, yes. So 12,000 +3250=15,250.

Hmm, but let's check if I have the equations correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Because if 70% are above 12,000, that means 30% are below, which is correct. But perhaps I should think in terms of right tail. Wait, no, the left side is the lower values.

Wait another approach: Maybe I should draw the normal distribution curve. The mean is somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000. Let me see.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should set up the equations correctly. Let me write them again.

Let me denote:

P(X <10,000) = 0.20 → Z1 = (10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.84

P(X <12,000) = 0.30 → Z2 = (12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.52

So two equations:

10,000 = μ - 0.84σ --> equation 1

12,000 = μ - 0.52σ --> equation 2

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(12,000 -10,000) = (μ -0.52σ) - (μ -0.84σ)

2000 = 0.32σ → σ = 2000 / 0.32 = 6250

So σ=6250, correct.

Then, from equation 1: μ=10,000 + 0.84 *6250

0.84 *6250: 6000*0.84=5040, 250*0.84=210 → total 5040+210=5250. So μ=10,000+5250=15,250.

So μ=15,250, σ=6250.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option F: μ=15,100; σ=6200.

Option D: μ=15,300; σ=6300.

Hmm, perhaps the Z-scores I used were approximate. Maybe using more precise Z-values would change the calculations.

Looking up exact Z-scores, for 0.20, Z is -0.8416, and for 0.30, Z is -0.5244.

Let me recalculate with more precise Z-scores.

So equation 1: (10,000 - μ)/σ = -0.8416 → 10,000 = μ - 0.8416σ → μ =10,000 +0.8416σ.

Equation 2: (12,000 - μ)/σ = -0.5244 → 12,000 = μ -0.5244σ → μ=12,000 + 0.5244σ.

Set equal:

10k +0.8416σ =12k +0.5244σ → 10k -12k =0.5244σ -0.8416σ → -2k = (-0.3172)σ → σ=2k /0.3172 → 2000 /0.3172 ≈ 6300.

Wait, 2000 / 0.3172 ≈ 6303. Let me compute it: 0.3172 *6300 = ?

0.3 *6300 = 1890, 0.0172*6300 ≈ 108.36 → total≈1998.36. Close enough.

So σ≈6300.

Then μ=12,000 + 0.5244 * 6300.

Compute 0.5244 *6300: 0.5 *6300=3150, 0.0244*6300≈153.72 → total ≈3150+153.72=3303.72.

So μ≈12,000 +3,303.72 =15,303.72, approximately 15,304.

Looking at the options, option D is μ=15,300; σ=6300. That's very close to our calculated values. So the answer should be D.

So I think I initially used approximate Z-scores which led me to 15,250 and 6250, but with more precise Z-scores, it's about 15,300 and 6300, which matches option D.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the weights of trucks follow a normal distribution. The problem states that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds. This means:

- 30% of the trucks weigh less than 12,000 pounds, so 12,000 pounds corresponds to the 30th percentile.
- 20% of the trucks weigh less than 10,000 pounds, so 10,000 pounds corresponds to the 20th percentile.

In a normal distribution, the Z-score is calculated as:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

where \(X\) is the value, \(\mu\) is the mean, and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation. For percentiles, the Z-scores are approximately:

- For the 20th percentile (\(P(X < 10,000)\)), \(Z \approx -0.84\).
- For the 30th percentile (\(P(X < 12,000)\)), \(Z \approx -0.52\).

Using these Z-scores, we set up the following equations:

1. For \(X = 10,000\):
   \[
   \frac{10,000 - \mu}{\sigma} = -0.84 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10,000 - \mu = -0.84\sigma \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu = 10,000 + 0.84\sigma
   \]

2. For \(X = 12,000\):
   \[
   \frac{12,000 - \mu}{\sigma} = -0.52 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 12,000 - \mu = -0.52\sigma \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu = 12,000 + 0.52\sigma
   \]

Equating the two expressions for \(\mu\):

\[
10,000 + 0.84\sigma = 12,000 + 0.52\sigma
\]

Simplifying:

\[
10,000 - 12,000 = 0.52\sigma - 0.84\sigma \quad \Rightarrow \quad -2,000 = -0.32\sigma \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sigma = \frac{2,000}{0.32} = 6,250
\]

Substituting \(\sigma = 6,250\) back into \(\mu = 12,000 + 0.52\sigma\):

\[
\mu = 12,000 + 0.52(6,250) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu = 12,000 + 3,250 = 15,250
\]

Thus, the calculated values are \(\mu = 15,250\) and \(\sigma = 6,250\). However, none of the options exactly match these values. To refine the result, we use more precise Z-scores:

- For the 20th percentile, \(Z \approx -0.8416\).
- For the 30th percentile, \(Z \approx -0.5244\).

Repeating the calculations with these precise Z-scores:

1. For \(X = 10,000\):
   \[
   \mu = 10,000 + 0.8416\sigma
   \]

2. For \(X = 12,000\):
   \[
   \mu = 12,000 + 0.5244\sigma
   \]

Equating the two expressions for \(\mu\):

\[
10,000 + 0.8416\sigma = 12,000 + 0.5244\sigma
\]

Simplifying:

\[
10,000 - 12,000 = 0.5244\sigma - 0.8416\sigma \quad \Rightarrow \quad -2,000 = -0.3172\sigma \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sigma = \frac{2,000}{0.3172} \approx 6,300
\]

Substituting \(\sigma = 6,300\) back into \(\mu = 12,000 + 0.5244\sigma\):

\[
\mu = 12,000 + 0.5244(6,300) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu \approx 12,000 + 3,303 = 15,303
\]

Thus, the refined values are \(\mu \approx 15,300\) and \(\sigma \approx 6,300\), which closely match **Option D: \(\mu = 15,300; \sigma = 6,300\)**.
