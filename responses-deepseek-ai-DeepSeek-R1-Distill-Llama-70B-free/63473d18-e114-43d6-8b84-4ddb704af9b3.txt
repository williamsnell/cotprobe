Question:

Bill, a single man, owned pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant. He also owned a condominium in Miami, which he held for investment. In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?

Options:

A: Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.
B: Julie receives the condominium due to her father's original will, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie.
C: Kathy gets the condominium due to the deed, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split evenly between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
D: Kathy, as the surviving spouse, gets the entire estate regardless of the prenuptial agreement.
E: Tommy and Julie split all assets equally, as the prenuptial agreement nullifies any changes made after the marriage.
F: Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.
G: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.
H: Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie, as Kathy signed a prenuptial agreement.
I: Tommy gets the pasture land, Kathy gets the condominium due to her husband's last wish, and the remaining estate is split between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
J: Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about estate distribution after someone dies. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

Bill was a single man who owned two properties: pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant, and a condominium in Miami that he held as an investment. In his will, he left the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condo to his daughter Julie. The rest of his assets were to be split equally between Tommy and Julie.

Then, Bill met Kathy and married her after she signed a prenuptial agreement. This agreement said she gives up any rights she might have otherwise had by marrying Bill. So, she's not getting anything through the marriage unless Bill specifically gives it to her.

On their honeymoon in Miami, they drove by the condo, and Kathy mentioned she'd love to live there. Bill, being happy, decided to give her the condo. After the honeymoon, he signed and delivered a deed conveying the condo to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety. They were planning to live there once the tenant moved out. But the next day, Bill died.

The question is about how the assets are distributed now.

So, the key points here are:

1. Bill had a will that left the pasture land to Tommy and the condo to Julie.
2. He married Kathy with a prenuptial agreement, so she can't claim any of his assets unless he gives them to her.
3. After the marriage, Bill deeded the condo to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety. That means they both own it together, right?
4. Bill died the next day.

I need to figure out the effect of the prenuptial agreement and the deed on the distribution of the assets.

First, the prenuptial agreement. Typically, a prenup can waive a spouse's rights to the other's property, including inheritance rights. But does it affect gifts made during the marriage?

Bill gave Kathy the condo after they were married. By deeding it as tenants by the entirety, that creates a joint ownership. So, upon his death, Kathy would own the condo entirely because in a tenancy by the entirety, the surviving spouse gets the whole property.

Wait, but in some states, if one spouse conveys property to both as tenants by the entirety, the other spouse gets the entire property upon death. So, Kathy would get the condo regardless of the will, because the deed was delivered during his lifetime.

But what about the prenup? The prenup says she relinquishes any rights she might have by marriage. Does that include the right to own property that Bill transfers to her? I'm a bit confused here.

In some jurisdictions, a spouse can't contract away their statutory rights through a prenup if it's against public policy. For example, a spouse might not be able to waive their right to elective share. But in this case, Bill is giving her the property outright, so maybe the prenup doesn't affect that.

Wait, no, the prenup was signed before the marriage, and it says she gives up any rights by marrying him. So, does that mean she can't take any share of his estate unless he gives it to her? But if he did give it to her during the marriage, does the prenup prevent that?

I think once Bill transferred the condo to both of them as tenants by the entirety, it's a completed gift. The prenup can't take that away because Kathy already has a legal interest in the property. So she would keep the condo.

Now, the pasture land was left to Tommy in the will. Bill didn't change that, right? So Tommy gets the pasture land.

The rest of Bill's assets are to be split equally between Tommy and Julie under the will. But wait, what about the condo? Since Bill gave it to Kathy, it's no longer part of his estate, so the residue doesn't include the condo.

So, the distribution would be:

- Condo: Kathy owns it through the deed as tenants by the entirety.
- Pasture land: Tommy, as per the will.
- The rest of the estate: split equally between Tommy and Julie.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option G says Kathy gets the condo, Tommy the pasture land, and the rest split between Tommy and Julie.

Option J says Tommy gets pasture, Julie the condo, and split the rest. But that doesn't fit because the deed gave the condo to Kathy.

Option B: Julie gets the condo, but the deed supersedes the will, so B is incorrect.

Option H: Julie gets the condo, but again, the deed would give it to Kathy.

Option A: Kathy gets condo, but the rest is split between Tommy and Julie. But A says the rest is split equally, which is correct.

Wait, option G says the rest is split between Tommy and Julie, which matches. So, option G.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option G: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenup, Tommy gets pasture, rest split between Tommy and Julie.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but what about the prenup? Does it affect anything else? The prenup only affects what she would have received through marriage, like intestate share or elective share. But since Bill gave her the condo during his life, she keeps it. So the prenup doesn't interfere with that.

So the answer should be option G.

To determine the distribution of Bill’s assets, we must analyze the legal implications of the events outlined:

1. **Bill’s Will**: Originally, Bill devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. The remainder of his estate was to pass equally to Tommy and Julie.

2. **Prenuptial Agreement**: Bill married Kathy after she signed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise have as his spouse. This means Kathy waived her statutory rights to Bill’s estate unless he explicitly transferred assets to her during the marriage.

3. **Deed to the Condominium**: After the marriage, Bill signed and delivered a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety. This created a joint ownership interest in the property. Upon Bill’s death, Kathy, as the surviving spouse in a tenancy by the entirety, automatically inherits the entire condominium. The prenuptial agreement does not affect this transfer because it was a completed gift during Bill’s lifetime.

4. **Pasture Land**: The pasture land was devised to Tommy in Bill’s will, and there is no indication that this was altered. Therefore, Tommy retains the pasture land.

5. **Remaining Assets**: The remainder of Bill’s estate, excluding the condominium and pasture land, passes as per the will, which directs that it be split equally between Tommy and Julie.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. While Kathy does get the condominium, the remainder of the estate is split equally between Tommy and Julie, not just based on Bill’s original intent to devise equally to his children.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Julie does not receive the condominium because the deed supersedes the will, and Kathy inherits the condominium as a tenant by the entirety.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The remainder of the estate is split only between Tommy and Julie, not including Kathy, as her interest is limited to the condominium.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Kathy does not receive the entire estate; she only receives the condominium through the deed.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The prenuptial agreement does not nullify the deed or the will; it only waives Kathy’s statutory rights to Bill’s estate.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Kathy is not a pretermitted spouse because she waived her rights via the prenuptial agreement, and the condominium was transferred to her during Bill’s lifetime.
- **Option G**: Correct. Kathy receives the condominium due to the deed, Tommy receives the pasture land, and the remainder of the estate is split equally between Tommy and Julie.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Julie does not receive the condominium; Kathy does due to the deed.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The remainder of the estate is split only between Tommy and Julie, not including Kathy.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Julie does not receive the condominium; Kathy does due to the deed.

### Conclusion:
The correct distribution is that Kathy receives the condominium, Tommy receives the pasture land, and the remainder of the estate is split equally between Tommy and Julie.
