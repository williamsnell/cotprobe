Okay, so I've got this question about perfectly competitive industries. Hmm, I remember that in economics, a perfectly competitive market has a lot of firms producing similar products. The key thing is that each firm is a price taker, meaning they can't influence the market price because there are so many competitors. 

The question is asking which statement is true for a firm in such an industry. The options are from A to J. Let me think through each one.

Option A says average revenue equals marginal revenue. Wait, I think I remember something about this. In perfect competition, the firm's demand curve is perfectly elastic, right? So the price they get is the same no matter how much they produce. That means average revenue (which is the same as price) is equal to marginal revenue because each additional unit sold brings in the same revenue. So A sounds correct.

Option B: Marginal revenue is always increasing. No, that doesn't make sense. If a firm increases production, in other market structures like monopoly, MR might decrease because of the demand curve slope. But in perfect competition, MR is constant because price is constant. So B is wrong.

Option C: Average revenue is always negative. That can't be right. Revenue is price times quantity, and both are positive, so average revenue (AR) can't be negative. Unless the price is negative, which doesn't happen in this context. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Marginal revenue equals total revenue. Let me think. Total revenue (TR) is price times quantity (P*Q). Marginal revenue (MR) is the change in TR when Q increases by one. In perfect competition, since P is constant, MR = P. But TR is P*Q, so MR would only equal TR if Q is 1, which isn't generally the case. So D is wrong.

Option E: Average revenue is initially negative and then becomes positive. No, as I thought before, average revenue is price, which is positive as long as the firm is selling the product. E doesn't make sense.

Option F: Marginal revenue is decreasing. This would be the case in a monopoly where MR decreases as Q increases, but in perfect competition, MR stays the same. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Total revenue always decreases. That's not true. When a firm increases output, TR increases as long as price stays the same. Unless price drops, but in perfect competition, the firm doesn't affect price, so if they produce more, TR increases. So G is wrong.

Option H: Total revenue increases and then decreases. That would be the case if MR becomes negative at some point, but in perfect competition, MR is always positive as long as price is positive. So TR would keep increasing as Q increases unless the firm stops producing. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Total revenue equals average revenue. Well, average revenue is TR divided by Q (AR = TR/Q). So unless Q is 1, they wouldn't be equal. Otherwise, it's not generally true. So I is wrong.

Option J: Marginal revenue is initially positive and then becomes negative. No, because in perfect competition, MR is always equal to the market price, which remains positive as long as the firm is operating. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be A: Average revenue equals marginal revenue.

In a perfectly competitive industry, firms are price takers, meaning they cannot influence the market price of their product. This results in the demand curve for the firm being perfectly elastic. Consequently, the price of the product (average revenue) remains constant regardless of the quantity sold. Marginal revenue, which represents the additional revenue generated from selling one more unit, is therefore equal to the average revenue since each additional unit sold does not change the price.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. In perfect competition, average revenue equals marginal revenue because the firm's price remains constant.
- **B**: Incorrect. Marginal revenue does not increase; it remains constant.
- **C**: Incorrect. Average revenue is not negative; it is equal to the market price, which is positive.
- **D**: Incorrect. Marginal revenue equals the price, while total revenue is price multiplied by quantity.
- **E**: Incorrect. Average revenue is always positive as long as the price is positive.
- **F**: Incorrect. Marginal revenue does not decrease; it remains constant.
- **G**: Incorrect. Total revenue increases as output increases, assuming the price remains constant.
- **H**: Incorrect. Total revenue does not decrease; it continues to increase with output.
- **I**: Incorrect. Total revenue is not equal to average revenue unless output is 1.
- **J**: Incorrect. Marginal revenue remains positive as long as the price is positive.

The correct answer is **A**.
