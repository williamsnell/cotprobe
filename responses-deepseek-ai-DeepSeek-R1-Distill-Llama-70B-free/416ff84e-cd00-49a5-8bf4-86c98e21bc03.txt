Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about a neutron colliding with a nucleus and then rebounding. I need to find the work done by the force of interaction and estimate the strength of that force. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think.

First, part (a) is about the work done. I remember that work is related to the change in kinetic energy. Oh right, the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the neutron. So I should calculate the initial and final kinetic energies and subtract them.

The neutron's mass is given as 1.67 × 10^-27 kg. Its initial speed is 2 × 10^3 m/s, and after the collision, it rebounds with 3 × 10^2 m/s. Wait, the direction of the velocity must have changed, so the final velocity is in the opposite direction. So the final speed is 3e2 m/s but in the opposite direction, making it -3e2 m/s. But wait, when calculating kinetic energy, speed is squared, so direction might not matter in the magnitude, but the change in velocity vector does affect the work done.

Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². So initial KE is (1/2) * m * (2e3)^2. Let's compute that. m is 1.67e-27 kg, v is 2e3 m/s.

Initial KE = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * (4e6) → 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * 4e6 = 0.5 * (6.68e-21) )= 3.34e-21 J.

Final KE is (1/2) * m * (3e2)^2. So that's 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * 9e4 = 0.5 * (1.503e-22) )= 7.515e-23 J.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the neutron rebounds, its velocity changes direction. So the initial velocity is, say, +2e3 m/s, the final is -3e2 m/s. So the change in velocity is from 2e3 to -3e2, which is a delta v of (-3e2 - 2e3) = -2.3e3 m/s. But for kinetic energy, it's the squares, so direction doesn't affect the magnitude in KE.

But for work done, it's the change in kinetic energy. So work done W is KE_final - KE_initial.

So W = (7.515e-23 J) - (3.34e-21 J) → 7.515e-23 is about 0.07515e-21. So 0.07515e-21 - 3.34e-21 = approximately -3.265e-21 J. Let me calculate more accurately.

Initial KE: (1/2)*1.67e-27*(2e3)^2 = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 *4e6 = 0.5 * 6.68e-21 = 3.34e-21 J.

Final KE: (1/2)*1.67e-27*(3e2)^2 = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 *9e4 = 0.5 *1.503e-22 = 7.515e-23 J.

So W = 7.515e-23 - 3.34e-21 = let me compute this in exponents. 3.34e-21 is 334e-23. 7.515e-23 is 7.515e-23. So 7.515 - 334 = -326.485, so -326.485e-23 J, which is -3.26485e-21 J. Approximately -3.265e-21 J. Looking at the options, the first part of option E is -3.27e-21 J, which is close. Option C is -2.17e-21 J, so that's a different number. Let me see if I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I inverted the initial and final KE. Because the work done by the force is the change in the neutron's KE. So if the neutron slows down, the work done on it would be negative, because it's losing energy. So our calculation is correct.

So part (a) is approximately -3.26e-21 J. Looking at the options, option E's first part is -3.27e-21 J, which is very close. Option D is -3.27e-22, which is an order lower. So option E would be a candidate for part (a).

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations. Let me compute the initial KE again.

Initial velocity is 2e3 m/s. So v squared is (2e3)^2 =4e6. Multiply by mass: 1.67e-27 *4e6 =6.68e-21. Half of that is 3.34e-21 J. That's correct.

Final velocity is 3e2 m/s, so v squared is 9e4. 1.67e-27 *9e4 = 1.503e-22. Half is 7.515e-23 J. So the difference is 7.515e-23 -3.34e-21 = -3.26485e-21 J, which rounds to -3.26e-21. So option E is -3.27e-21, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the exact numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with more precise steps.

Calculate initial KE:

(1/2) * 1.67e-27 kg * (2e3)^2 = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 *4e6 = 0.5 * (6.68e-21) )= 3.34e-21 J.

Final KE:

(1/2) *1.67e-27 * (3e2)^2 =0.5 *1.67e-27 *9e4 = 0.5 * (1.503e-22) =7.515e-23 J.

Work done W = 7.515e-23 -3.34e-21 = (7.515 - 334) *1e-23 = -326.485e-23 = -3.26485e-21 J. So approximately -3.26e-21 J. So the closest option is E: -3.27e-21 J.

Wait, but option C is -2.17e-21 J. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the initial speed is 2e3, and the final speed is 3e2 in the opposite direction. So the final velocity is -3e2, so the change in velocity is from +2e3 to -3e2, which is a delta_v of -2.3e3 m/s. But when calculating kinetic energy, the direction doesn't matter because it's squared. So our earlier calculation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the neutron's velocity as vectors, but for kinetic energy, it's the square of speed, not velocity. So our initial approach was correct.

So part (a) is -3.26e-21 J, which aligns with option E's first part.

Now part (b) is to find the strength of the force, given that the collision occurs over a distance of 2e-5 m? Wait, no, wait. The distance given is 2 × 10^5 m? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 2e5 meters is 200,000 meters, which is 200 kilometers. That seems way too large for a nuclear collision. Did I read that correctly? Oh wait, the question says 2 × 10^-5 m perhaps? Because 2e5 m is way too big. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says: "...distance over which the collision occurred is 2 × 10^5 m." No, it's 2e5 meters. That seems impossible because nuclear collisions happen at very small scales, like femtometers (1e-15 m) or so. 2e5 meters is 200 kilometers. That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 2e-15 m? But the question says 2e5 m. Hmm, perhaps it's a misprint. But I'll proceed with the given number.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in reading the exponent. Let me check again: the distance is 2 × 10^5 m. So yeah, 200,000 meters. That's unrealistic, but okay, perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario.

Work is also equal to force times distance, assuming the force is constant. So W = F * d. So F = W / d.

But wait, work done by the force is W, which we calculated as -3.26e-21 J. The distance is 2e5 m. So F = (-3.26e-21 J) / (2e5 m) = (-3.26e-21)/(2e5) = -1.63e-26 N. But wait, none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps I misapplied the formula.

Wait, another thought: the work done is the change in kinetic energy, which is correct. But in some cases, the average force can be calculated using the impulse, which is the change in momentum. But the problem says to estimate the strength of the force, so perhaps using work = F*d is appropriate, assuming the force is constant during the collision.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me compute F as W/d.

So W is approximately -3.26e-21 J, d is 2e5 m.

F = (-3.26e-21)/(2e5) = (-1.63e-26) N. That's a very small force. But looking at the options, let's see.

Looking at option E, the second part is -1.64e-6 N. That's much larger than what I just calculated. So perhaps I did something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent in the distance. Maybe the distance is 2e-5 m, not 2e5. Because 2e5 m is way too big. Let me recheck the question.

The question says: "distance over which the collision occurred is 2 × 10^5 m." So 2e5 meters. Hmm. That's 200,000 meters, which is way larger than any nuclear collision. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's 2e-15 m or something. But since the question says 2e5, I have to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the force. Let me compute it again.

F = W / d.

W is -3.26485e-21 J.

d is 2e5 m.

So F = (-3.26485e-21) / (2e5) = (-3.26485 / 2) * 1e-26 = (-1.6324e-26) N.

But none of the options are anywhere near that. All the options are in the order of 1e-6 to 1e-7 N. So there's something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the distance given is 2e-5 m, which is 2 cm. That would make more sense for a collision. Let me see what happens if d is 2e-5 m.

So F = (-3.26e-21 J) / (2e-5 m) = (-3.26e-21) / (2e-5) = (-1.63e-16) N. Hmm, that's still not matching the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option E: -3.27e-21 J, -1.64e-6 N.

Wait, if the distance is 2e-5 m, then F = (-3.26e-21) / (2e-5) = (-1.63e-16) N. That's not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute the impulse, which is the change in momentum, and then find the average force as delta_p / delta_t. But without time, that might not help. Alternatively, using the kinematic equations with the distance.

Wait, another approach: The work done is also equal to the average force multiplied by the distance over which it's applied. So W = F_avg * d.

So F_avg = W / d.

Given that, let's compute F_avg with W as -3.26e-21 J and d as 2e5 m.

So F_avg = (-3.26e-21) / (2e5) = (-1.63e-26) N. But this is way too small, and none of the options match this.

Alternatively, if d is 2e-5 m, then F_avg would be (-3.26e-21)/(2e-5) )= (-1.63e-16) N. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the work done. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial KE is (1/2)mv_i², and the final KE is (1/2)mv_f². But the velocity changes direction, so the final velocity is -v. But for KE, the square makes it positive, so the KE is same as (1/2)mv² whether v is positive or negative.

Wait, but when the neutron rebounds, its velocity is in the opposite direction, but for kinetic energy, the sign doesn't matter. So the change in KE is (1/2)m(v_f^2 - v_i^2). Wait, no, because v_f is in the opposite direction but its square is same as positive. So the change in KE is (1/2)m(v_final^2 - v_initial^2).

Wait, but in our case, the neutron slows down, so its final speed is less than initial. So v_initial is 2e3 m/s, v_final is 3e2 m/s, but in opposite direction. So the change in KE is (1/2)m( (3e2)^2 - (2e3)^2 ). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait. Because the final velocity is opposite, but the speed is 3e2. So the kinetic energy is (1/2) m (3e2)^2. So the change is (3e2)^2 - (2e3)^2 times (1/2)m.

So let me compute that.

(3e2)^2 =9e4.

(2e3)^2=4e6.

So 9e4 -4e6 = -3.91e6.

Multiply by (1/2)m: (1/2)*1.67e-27*(-3.91e6) = 0.835e-27 * (-3.91e6) = -3.264e-21 J.

Same result as before, so W is correct at -3.26e-21 J.

So I think the calculation for part (a) is correct, aligning with option E's first part.

But for part (b), none of the options match the force I calculated with the given distance. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the work done is actually the kinetic energy change, but the force involved is the nuclear force during the collision, which is a short-range force. So the distance over which the force acts is very small, like on the order of femtometers (1e-15 m). But the question gives 2e5 m, which is 2e5 meters. That's way too big, perhaps a typo.

Wait, maybe the distance is 2e-5 m, which is 2 cm. That's still too big for a nuclear collision, but let's see.

If d =2e-5 m,

F = (-3.26e-21 J ) / (2e-5 m) )= (-3.26e-21) / (2e-5) )= (-1.63e-16) N. That's a very small force, but the options have forces in the 1e-6 to 1e-7 range.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the absolute value of the work done. So F = |W| / d.

But even then, (3.26e-21) / (2e5) )= 1.63e-26 N, which is negligible.

Wait, perhaps the distance given is 2e-15 m, which is 2 femtometers. Let me try that.

d=2e-15 m.

F= (-3.26e-21) / (2e-15) )= (-1.63e-6) N. That's -1.63e-6 N, which matches option E's second part of -1.64e-6 N.

Wait, that would make sense. Because 2e-15 m is a typical distance for nuclear interactions. So perhaps the question intended the distance to be 2e-15 m, but there's a typo in the exponent.

Given that, if d=2e-15 m, then F is about -1.63e-6 N, which is close to option E's second value of -1.64e-6 N. So the correct option would be E.

But the given options have part (a) as -3.27e-21 J and part (b) as -1.64e-6 N, which matches our corrected calculation with d=2e-15 m.

So perhaps the intended distance was 2e-15 m, and the question has a typo. Therefore, the correct answer is option E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the work done by the force of interaction and estimate the force strength during the collision.

### Part (a): Work Done
The work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the neutron. The kinetic energy is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

where \( m = 1.67 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the neutron, and \( v \) is its velocity.

   \[
   KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1
