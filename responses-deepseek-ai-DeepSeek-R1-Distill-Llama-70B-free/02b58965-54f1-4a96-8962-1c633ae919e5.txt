Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the decomposition of sulfuryl chloride. The equation is SO2Cl2(g) ⇌ SO2(g) + Cl2(g). The problem gives me some data at 300 K and 1 atm pressure, and asks me to find the equilibrium constant Kp. Then, it also asks for the degree of dissociation when the pressure is increased to 10 atm.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what's given. The degree of dissociation is 0.121 at 1 atm and 300 K. So, I remember that the degree of dissociation (α) is the fraction of the reactant that dissociates into products.

I think I should first find the equilibrium constant Kp for the reaction under the initial conditions. Since the reaction is in the gas phase and we're dealing with partial pressures, Kp would be the ratio of the partial pressures of the products to the reactants, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients.

Let me write the expression for Kp. The reaction is SO2Cl2 ⇌ SO2 + Cl2. So, the Kp expression would be (P_SO2 * P_Cl2) / P_SO2Cl2.

Now, at equilibrium, let's assume the initial pressure of SO2Cl2 is P. Since it's at 1 atm, I think we can consider the total pressure as 1 atm, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of initial moles and changes.

Wait, another approach: Let’s let the initial pressure of SO2Cl2 be 1 atm. Then, as it dissociates, α moles dissociate. So, for every mole of SO2Cl2 that dissociates, you get one mole each of SO2 and Cl2.

So, at equilibrium:
- Pressure of SO2Cl2 = 1 - α
- Pressures of SO2 and Cl2 each = α

Wait, no, wait. Because for every one mole of SO2Cl2 that dissociates, you get one mole of SO2 and one mole of Cl2. So total moles at equilibrium would be (1 - α) + α + α = 1 + α.

But since pressure is proportional to moles (from PV=nRT, at constant V and T, P is proportional to n), the partial pressures would be:

P_SO2Cl2 = (1 - α) / (1 + α) * total pressure. Wait, but initially, the total pressure was 1 atm, right?

Wait, no, let me think again. The initial pressure is 1 atm of SO2Cl2. At equilibrium, the number of moles is (1 - α) + α (from SO2) + α (from Cl2) = 1 + α. So the total pressure is (1 + α) times the initial pressure, but wait, initial total pressure was 1 atm.

Wait, no, initial pressure is 1 atm of SO2Cl2. After dissociation, the moles are (1 - α) for SO2Cl2, α for SO2, and α for Cl2. So the total moles are (1 - α) + α + α = 1 + α. So the total pressure would be (1 + α) * P_initial / initial moles? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, considering that in a closed system, the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures. So initial pressure is 1 atm, and all from SO2Cl2. At equilibrium, the partial pressures are:

P_SO2Cl2 = (1 - α) * (1 atm) / (1 + α), because the total moles are 1 + α, so each mole contributes proportionally to the partial pressure. Wait, maybe not. Let me think about it differently.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it using mole fractions. Let’s say the degree of dissociation is α. So, for each mole of SO2Cl2 that dissociates:

Moles of SO2Cl2: 1 - α
Moles of SO2: α
Moles of Cl2: α
Total moles: 1 - α + α + α = 1 + α

So the partial pressures would be:

P_SO2Cl2 = (1 - α) / (1 + α) * P_total
P_SO2 = α / (1 + α) * P_total
P_Cl2 = α / (1 + α) * P_total

But the initial pressure is 1 atm, so after dissociation, the total pressure is (1 + α) * (initial pressure)/(initial moles). Wait, initial moles were 1 (since 1 atm), so P_total = (1 + α) * 1 atm? No, that can't be right, because when you have more moles, the pressure would increase. Oh wait, at constant volume and temperature, yes, pressure is proportional to moles. So initial pressure P_initial = n_initial RT/V. At equilibrium, n_total = 1 + α, so P_total = (1 + α) P_initial.

Wait, but the initial pressure P_initial is 1 atm. So P_total = (1 + α) * 1 atm = (1 + α) atm.

So then the partial pressures are:

P_SO2Cl2 = (1 - α) / (1 + α) * (1 + α) atm = (1 - α) atm.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because, if you have (1 - α) moles out of (1 + α) total, then their partial pressure would be ( (1 - α) / (1 + α) ) * P_total. But since P_total is (1 + α) atm, then (1 - α)/(1 + α) * (1 + α) = (1 - α) atm. So yes, P_SO2Cl2 = 1 - α atm.

Similarly, P_SO2 = (α)/(1 + α) * (1 + α) atm = α atm.

Same for P_Cl2 = α atm.

Wait, that's a big simplification. So the partial pressures are:

P_SO2Cl2 = 1 - α atm
P_SO2 = α atm
P_Cl2 = α atm

So the equilibrium expression Kp would be (P_SO2 * P_Cl2) / P_SO2Cl2.

Plugging in, we get (α * α) / (1 - α) = α² / (1 - α).

So Kp = α² / (1 - α).

Given that α is 0.121, let's compute Kp.

So Kp = (0.121)^2 / (1 - 0.121) = (0.014641) / (0.879) ≈ 0.01666...

Wait, let me calculate that more precisely.

0.121 squared: 0.121 * 0.121 = 0.014641.

1 - 0.121 = 0.879.

So Kp = 0.014641 / 0.879 ≈ 0.01666.

Wait, 0.014641 / 0.879: let me compute that.

Dividing 0.014641 by 0.879:

0.879 goes into 0.014641 how many times?

Well, 0.879 * 0.01666 is approximately equal to 0.879 * (1/60) ≈ 0.01465, which is close to 0.014641. So Kp ≈ 0.01666, which is about 1.666e-2.

But looking at the options, I see options like 1.49e-2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, 0.014641 / 0.879: let's compute it more accurately.

0.014641 ÷ 0.879.

Let me compute 0.014641 ÷ 0.879.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 14.641 / 879.

Compute 14.641 ÷ 879.

879 × 0.016 is 14.064. 0.016 × 879 = 14.064.

Subtract that from 14.641: 14.641 -14.064=0.577.

Bring down a zero: 5.770.

879 goes into 5.770 about 0.00657 times (since 879 *0.006=5.274; 879*0.0065=5.7135).

Wait, 879 × 0.0066 = 879*(6.6/1000) = (879*6.6)/1000.

Compute 879 *6 = 5274; 879*0.6=527.4. So 5274 +527.4=5801.4. Divide by 1000: 5.8014.

Wait, that's more than 5.770, so maybe 0.0065.

879 ×0.0065= (879 ×6.5)/1000 = (5700 + 439.5) = 6139.5? Wait, no, wait. 6.5 is 6 + 0.5. So 879 ×6 = 5274; 879 ×0.5=439.5. So total is 5274 +439.5=5713.5. Divided by 1000 gives 5.7135.

So 0.0065 gives 5.7135, which is less than 5.770. The difference is 5.770 -5.7135=0.0565.

So next, 879 ×0.000064 is approximately 0.056. Because 879 ×0.00006=0.05274. 879 ×0.000064=0.05274 + (879 *0.000004)=0.05274 + 0.003516=0.056256.

So adding up: 0.0166 +0.0065=0.0231, plus 0.000064 is 0.023164.

So approximately 0.023164?

Wait, wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 14.641 /879.

Let me use a calculator approach.

Compute 14.641 ÷879:

- 879 goes into 1464 once (since 879*1=879, 879*2=1758>1464). So 1.

1 *879=879; subtract from 1464: 1464-879=585.

Bring down the 1: 5851.

879 goes into 5851 6 times (6*879=5274). 5851-5274=577.

Bring down a 0: 5770.

879 goes into 5770 6 times (6*879=5274). 5770-5274=496.

Bring down a 0: 4960.

879 goes into 4960 5 times (5*879=4395). 4960-4395=565.

Bring down a 0: 5650.

879 goes into 5650 6 times (6*879=5274). 5650-5274=376.

Bring down a 0: 3760.

879 goes into 3760 4 times (4*879=3516). 3760-3516=244.

So putting it all together, it's 0.0166... So approximately 0.0166.

Wait, but earlier I thought 0.0166 is about 1.66e-2, which is 0.0166.

Looking at the options, there's an option A:1.49e-2, which is 0.0149. Hmm, that's a bit lower. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I messed up the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, is the setup correct? So the reaction is SO2Cl2 → SO2 + Cl2.

At initial: 1 atm SO2Cl2, 0 of others.

Change: -α, so SO2Cl2 becomes 1 - α.

But since pressure is proportional to moles, the total pressure P_total would be (1 - α) + α + α = 1 + α.

So the partial pressure of SO2Cl2 is (1 - α) / (1 + α) * P_total.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that the partial pressure of each is (moles of that species) * P_total / total moles.

So P_SO2Cl2 = (1 - α) * (P_total) / (1 + α).

And P_SO2 = α * P_total / (1 + α).

Same for Cl2.

Wait, but in this case, if P_total is (1 + α) atm, because initial pressure is 1 atm, and moles increase by α.

So then, P_SO2Cl2 = (1 - α) * (1 + α) atm / (1 + α) ) = 1 - α atm.

Similarly, P_SO2 = α * (1 + α) atm / (1 + α) )= α atm.

Same for Cl2.

So that setup seems correct. Therefore, Kp = (α^2) / (1 - α).

So with α=0.121, Kp = (0.121)^2 / (1 - 0.121) = (0.014641)/0.879 ≈ 0.01666.

But none of the options exactly match 0.01666. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.49e-2 → 0.0149.

Option E:1.49e-3 → 0.00149.

Option I:2.98e-2 → 0.0298.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Kp calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 0.121 squared is 0.014641.

Divide by (1 - 0.121) = 0.879.

So 0.014641 / 0.879.

Let me compute this more accurately.

0.014641 divided by 0.879.

Let me compute 0.014641 / 0.879.

Using calculator steps:

0.879 goes into 0.014641 how many times?

Multiply 0.879 by 0.01666: 0.879 * 0.016 = 0.014064.

0.014641 - 0.014064 = 0.000577.

So 0.016 gives 0.014064, and the remainder is 0.000577.

Now, 0.879 * 0.00066 is approximately 0.000579.

So 0.016 + 0.00066 = 0.01666, which gives a product of about 0.014643.

Which is very close to 0.014641, so Kp is approximately 0.01666, which is 1.666e-2.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1.49e-2, which is 0.0149. Option J is 1.49e-2, but option J's Kp is 1.49e-2 and the second part is 0.1200.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the expression for Kp is different.

Wait, another approach: Let's let the initial pressure be P, which is 1 atm. Let x be the degree of dissociation at equilibrium.

So for each mole of SO2Cl2 that dissociates, you get x moles of SO2 and x moles of Cl2.

So the total moles at equilibrium are (1 - x) + x + x = 1 + x.

So the total pressure is (1 + x) * P_initial / 1, because initially it was 1 mole, now it's 1 + x moles. So P_total = (1 + x) atm.

Then, the partial pressures are:

SO2Cl2: (1 - x) / (1 + x) * P_total → (1 - x)/(1 + x) * (1 + x) atm = (1 - x) atm.

SO2: x/(1 + x) * (1 + x) atm = x atm.

Cl2: same as SO2, x atm.

Thus, Kp = (x^2) / (1 - x).

So with x = 0.121, Kp = (0.121)^2 / (0.879) = 0.014641 / 0.879 ≈ 0.01666.

Hmm, but none of the options have this value. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating Kp. Let me compute 0.014641 / 0.879 more accurately.

0.014641 ÷ 0.879:

Let me use decimal division.

0.879 | 0.014641

We can write this as 14641e-6 ÷ 879e-3 = (14641 / 879) * 1e-3.

Compute 14641 ÷ 879.

Let me compute 879 ×16 = 14064.

14641 -14064 = 577.

So 16 with a remainder of 577.

Now, bring down a zero: 5770.

879 ×6=5274 → 6 * 879=5274.

5770-5274=496.

Bring down zero: 4960.

879 ×5=4395 → 5 *879=4395.

4960-4395=565.

Bring down zero: 5650.

879 ×6=5274.

5650-5274=376.

Bring down zero:3760.

879 ×4=3516.

3760-3516=244.

Bring down zero:2440.

879 ×2=1758.

2440-1758=682.

Bring down zero:6820.

879 ×7=6153.

6820-6153=667.

Bring down zero:6670.

879 ×7=6153.

6670-6153=517.

At this point, it's clear that 14641/879 ≈16.66...

So 0.014641 /0.879 = 0.01666..., which is 1.666...e-2.

Looking at the options, none of the Kp values exactly match this. The closest is option A with 1.49e-2, which is 0.0149. Hmm, perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem states that the degree of dissociation is 0.121. Is that under 1 atm? Yes. So Kp is as I calculated.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Kp=1.49e-2, which is 0.0149. So that's Kp=0.0149, which is lower than my calculated 0.0166.

Hmm. Maybe
