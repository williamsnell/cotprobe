Okay, so I have this quadratic equation to solve: x squared minus five x plus six equals zero. I'm a bit rusty on quadratic equations, but I remember they're of the form ax² + bx + c = 0. Oh right, the quadratic formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over 2a. Let me write that down.

So for the equation x² -5x +6 =0, the coefficients are a=1, b=-5, and c=6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard form is ax² + bx + c. So this equation is 1x² + (-5)x +6. So a is 1, b is -5, and c is 6.

Now applying the quadratic formula: x equals [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values: b is -5, so -b becomes 5. Then b squared is (-5) squared, which is 25. 4ac is 4*1*6, which is 24. So the discriminant, the part under the square root, is 25 minus 24. That equals 1. So the square root of 1 is 1. 

So now the formula becomes (5 ± 1) divided by (2*1), which is 2. So there are two solutions. The first is (5 +1)/2 =6/2=3. The second is (5-1)/2=4/2=2. So the solutions are x=3 and x=2.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Another way to solve quadratics is factoring. Let's see if this can be factored. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term c) and add up to -5 (the coefficient of x). Hmm, factors of 6 are 1 and 6, 2 and 3. Let's see, 2 and 3 add up to 5. But in the equation, the middle term is -5x, so maybe the factors are both negative. Because when you have (x - a)(x - b), the middle term is negative (a + b) if both a and b are positive. So (x-2)(x-3) would expand to x² -5x +6. So yes, that factors correctly. So setting each factor to zero gives x=2 and x=3.

So the solutions are x=2 and x=3. Now looking back at the options: option D is x=3 and x=2. Option F is 3 and 4. Option C is 1 and 2. Wait, option D is 3 and 2, which matches what I got. So the correct answer should be D.

To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), we identify the coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = 6 \). Substituting these values into the formula:

1. Compute the discriminant:  
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1
   \]
   The square root of the discriminant is \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \).

2. Solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-5) \pm 1}{2(1)} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}
   \]
   This gives two solutions:  
   \[
   x = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = 2
   \]

Thus, the solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 2 \). Factoring the quadratic as \( (x-2)(x-3) = 0 \) confirms these roots. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**D: x = 3 and x = 2**
