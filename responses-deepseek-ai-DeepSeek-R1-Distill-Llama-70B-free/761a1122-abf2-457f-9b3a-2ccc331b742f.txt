Question:

A landlord owned a three-story home in fee simple and leased it to his friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a professor, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the professor would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. After residing in the house for a year, the professor subleased the third floor to a student for a term of two years; the agreement provided that the professor would receive a monthly rental payment of $100. After the student had made regular rental payments to the professor for the first six months of the sublease, he defaulted. The following month, the professor sent the new owner $200 as payment for rent and notified him that he should collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refused to vacate the premises. In an action by the new owner against the student to recover the additional $100 for rent due, he will most probably

Options:

A: recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.
B: not recover, because the professor remains liable.
C: recover, because the new owner inherited all rights and responsibilities from the original landlord.
D: recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.
E: not recover, because the student is not directly responsible to the new owner.
F: not recover, because the student was not in privity of contract with the new owner.
G: not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.
H: not recover, because the professor is the one who subleased to the student.
I: recover, because the student is in direct violation of his sublease agreement.
J: recover, because the student defaulted on his rental payment.

Okay, so I've got this property law multiple-choice question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to think through each part carefully.

Alright, the scenario starts with a landlord who owns a three-story home in fee simple. He leased it to his friend for 10 years. The lease terms say the friend has to pay $300 monthly and pay the taxes during the lease. Also, the lease says the friend can't assign or sublease the premises. So, that's an important pointâ€”the lease has a restriction on assignments and subleases.

Then, after two years, the friend assigns his leasehold interest to a professor, even though he still owes the landlord three months' rent. The assignment is in writing and says the professor will pay the $300 monthly rent. But it doesn't mention anything about taxes. The landlord didn't object to this assignment. Hmm, so the landlord's silence might mean he's consenting, but I'm not sure. Because the lease prohibited assignments, but if the landlord doesn't object, maybe he's accepted it, making the assignment valid. Or does the landlord's lack of objection matter?

Wait, in property law, when a lease prohibits assignment, the tenant can't assign without the landlord's consent. But if the landlord doesn't object, that might imply consent. So the assignment might be valid here. So the professor becomes the new tenant, taking over the lease, but possibly subject to the original lease terms.

Then, six months later, the landlord sells the property to a new owner. So the new owner steps into the landlord's shoes, right? They get all the rights and responsibilities that the original landlord had. So the new owner now holds the same position regarding the lease.

The professor lives there for a year, then subleases the third floor to a student for two years. The sublease agreement says the student pays $100 monthly to the professor. So the professor is acting as a sublessor here. Now, the original lease (from the original landlord to the friend) prohibited assignment or subleasing. But the professor, as the assignee, is now subleasing, which might be a breach if the original terms still apply.

Wait, but the professor's lease (from the original landlord) prohibited assignment or subletting. So when the professor subleases, is that a breach? Because the original lease terms would carry over to the assignee. So the professor isn't allowed to sublease without the landlord's consent. But in this case, the new owner didn't object. Does that matter? Or does the original lease's terms still bind the professor?

After the sublease, the student pays rent for six months, then defaults. The professor then sends the new owner $200 and tells him to collect the remaining $100 from the student, who refuses to leave. Now, the new owner sues the student for the additional $100.

Okay, so the question is, can the new owner recover that $100 from the student?

Let me think about the relationships here. The original lease was between the landlord and the friend. The friend assigned to the professor, who then subleased to the student. The new owner is the current landlord.

In a typical lease scenario, when a tenant subleases, the subtenant is responsible to the tenant, not directly to the landlord, unless the landlord has agreed to recognize the subtenant as a tenant. But in this case, the original lease prohibits subletting, so any subletting by the professor would be a breach. But wait, the professor's assignment was done without the landlord's explicit consent, but the landlord didn't object. So maybe the assignment was valid, making the professor the new tenant, but the subletting would still be prohibited unless the landlord (now new owner) consents.

Wait, when the original landlord assigned the property to the new owner, the new owner takes subject to the lease terms. So the new owner's rights are based on the original lease. So the professor, as the assignee, is bound by the lease terms, including the no-subletting clause.

So when the professor subleases to the student, that's a breach of the lease terms because the lease prohibits subletting without consent. But the new owner didn't object to the sublease. Hmm, but does that matter? Because the lease terms require the tenant (professor) to not sublet without consent. If the professor does sublet without consent, that's a breach, but if the landlord (new owner) later consents, maybe that ratifies the sublease.

Alternatively, if the new owner accepts rent directly from the subtenant, that could create a new tenancy. But in this case, the professor sent $200 and told the new owner to collect $100 from the student. So the new owner might be trying to hold the student liable directly.

But in general, without the landlord's consent, a sublease doesn't create a direct liability from the subtenant to the landlord. The subtenant is liable to the tenant (professor), who in turn is liable to the landlord. So the landlord can't usually go after the subtenant unless they've agreed to it.

So the question is, after the professor subleases, and the student defaults, can the new owner go after the student for the $100?

I think the answer depends on whether there's privity of estate between the student and the new owner. Privity of estate means a direct legal relationship regarding the property. If the student is only a subtenant, then the new owner can't directly sue the student unless they've taken some action to make the student a tenant. 

But the original lease prohibits subletting, so any subletting without consent would be a breach, but the new owner might have the option to treat the subtenant as a tenant if they accept rent from them. But in this case, the new owner didn't accept rent from the student; the professor sent $200 and told the new owner to get the rest from the student. So the new owner isn't directly receiving rent from the student, so maybe there's no privity.

Wait, but the new owner might argue that since the student is in possession and the professor is in breach, the student is now holding over unlawfully, and the new owner can sue for rent. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the new owner could choose to evict the professor for breach of the lease terms (subletting without consent), but that's a different issue.

In terms of the options, let's look at them:

Option A: Recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.

I'm not sure. Without consent, the sublease might not be valid, so the student isn't liable to the new owner.

Option B: Not recover, because the professor remains liable.

This makes sense because the professor is the tenant, and the subtenant's obligations are to the professor, not the landlord.

Option C: Recover, because the new owner inherited all rights and responsibilities.

But inheriting rights doesn't automatically create a new tenancy with the subtenant unless the new owner accepts it.

Option D: Recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.

Wait, privity of estate would require a direct lease between the new owner and the student, which doesn't exist here.

Option E: Not recover, because the student is not directly responsible to the new owner.

This seems correct because the student's obligation is to the professor, not the new owner.

Option F: Not recover, because the student was not in privity of contract with the new owner.

This also seems correct, as there's no direct contract between them.

Option G: Not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.

That's similar to option B.

Option H: Not recover, because the professor is the one who subleased to the student.

This is another way of saying the same thing.

Option I: Recover, because the student is in direct violation of his sublease agreement.

But the new owner isn't a party to that agreement, so they can't enforce it.

Option J: Recover, because the student defaulted on his rental payment.

Again, the new owner isn't the one entitled to that rent unless they have privity.

So, from the options, I think either B, E, F, G, or H are possible. But the key is that the new owner can't recover from the student because there's no privity of contract or estate. The professor is still the tenant and remains liable.

Wait, but the new owner could potentially have a claim against the professor, but not the student. So the question is about suing the student, so the new owner can't recover from the student because the student isn't liable to the new owner.

Therefore, the correct answer should be that the new owner cannot recover from the student because the professor remains liable. So looking back, option B says: "not recover, because the professor remains liable."

Alternatively, option E says the student isn't directly responsible to the new owner. Both seem correct, but in terms of the answer options, which one is more accurate.

In the common law, a subtenant isn't liable to the landlord unless the landlord has accepted them as a tenant. Since the new owner didn't agree to the sublease and didn't accept rent from the student, the student's obligation is only to the professor. So the new owner can't sue the student; they can only go after the professor for the rent.

So the correct answer would be option B: not recover, because the professor remains liable.

Wait, another point: when the professor subleased, did that create a new lease? If the original lease prohibits subletting, then the sublease is invalid unless the landlord consents. But the new owner didn't consent, so the sublease might be considered a breach, but the student isn't liable to the new owner. So the new owner's remedy is against the professor.

So the new owner can't recover from the student because the student is only a subtenant and not directly liable to the new owner. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around a complex landlord-tenant scenario involving assignments, subleases, and the rights of a new owner. The original lease prohibited assignment or subletting without the landlord's consent. The friend assigned the lease to the professor without explicitly obtaining the landlord's consent, but the landlord did not object, potentially implying acceptance. The professor later subleased to the student, which violated the original lease terms since the lease prohibited subletting without consent. The new owner, who acquired the property, seeks to recover rent directly from the student after the student defaulted on payments to the professor.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Assignment and Sublease**: The original lease prohibited assignment or subletting. While the landlord's silence after the assignment to the professor might imply acceptance, the professor's subsequent sublease to the student violated the lease terms. Without the landlord's consent, the sublease was not valid, and the student was not directly liable to the new owner.

2. **Privity of Contract and Estate**: For the new owner to recover rent directly from the student, there must be privity of contract or estate between them. Since the student's agreement was with the professor (the sublease), and the new owner did not accept rent from the student or recognize them as a tenant, no such privity existed.

3. **Liability of the Professor**: The professor, as the tenant under the original lease, remained liable to the new owner for the rent. The student's obligations were solely to the professor, not the new owner.

4. **New Owner's Remedies**: The new owner's remedies lay against the professor for breaching the lease terms by subletting without consent. The new owner could not pursue the student directly, as the student was not in privity of contract or estate with the new owner.

Given these considerations, the new owner cannot recover the additional $100 from the student because the professor remains liable under the original lease. The correct answer is:

**B: Not recover, because the professor remains liable.**
