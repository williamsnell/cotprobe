Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about half-life and reaction orders. Hmm, I've kinda forgotten some of this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that the half-life for a reaction was halved when the initial concentration of a reactant was doubled. I need to find the order n for that component.

Wait, right, the half-life depends on the order of the reaction. I remember there are different formulas for different orders. Like, for a zero-order reaction, the half-life increases with initial concentration, right? And for first-order, the half-life is constant regardless of concentration. Oh wait, no, I think first-order has a half-life that's independent of concentration. So if concentration changes, the half-life doesn't change for first-order.

But in this problem, when the initial concentration is doubled, the half-life is halved. So that doesn't fit first-order. Because for first-order, half-life wouldn't change. So it's not n=1.

What about second-order reactions? Oh right, the half-life of a second-order reaction is inversely proportional to the initial concentration. So if you double the concentration, the half-life would be halved. Because, for second-order, t1/2 = 1/(k[A]₀). So if [A]₀ doubles, t1/2 becomes 1/(2k[A]₀) which is half the original t1/2.

So in this case, doubling [A]₀ causes t1/2 to be halved. So that matches the behavior of a second-order reaction. So n must be 2.

Looking at the options, J is 2. So the answer should be J.

The half-life of a reaction depends on the order of the reaction. For a first-order reaction, the half-life is independent of the initial concentration, so doubling the concentration would not affect the half-life. For a second-order reaction, the half-life is inversely proportional to the initial concentration, meaning that doubling the concentration would halve the half-life. This matches the scenario described in the question, where doubling the initial concentration halved the half-life. Therefore, the reaction is second-order, and the value of \( n \) is 2.

The correct answer is **J**.
