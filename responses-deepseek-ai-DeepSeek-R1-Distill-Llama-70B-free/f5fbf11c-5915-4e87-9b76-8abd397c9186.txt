Question:

A grantor conveyed his property to his son "for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs. " Two years later, the son entered into a real estate agreement for the sale of the property to his friend, whereby the son agreed to convey the premises to his friend in fee simple absolute. Prior to the settlement date, the friend contacted the son, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the son could not convey a fee simple. If the Rule in Shelley's Case is followed in this jurisdiction, the outcome of a suit by the son for specific performance of the real estate contract would result in

Options:

A: the son's succeeding, because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs.
B: the son's not succeeding, because his heirs have to join in the transaction in order to convey marketable title.
C: the son's succeeding, because the son's life estate merged with the contingent remainder to his heirs, creating a fee simple.
D: the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.
E: the son's not succeeding, because he could not convey marketable title.
F: the son's not succeeding, because the Rule in Shelley's Case invalidates the remainder to his heirs.
G: the son's not succeeding, as the friend was correct in asserting that the son could not convey a fee simple.
H: the son's succeeding, as the grantor's initial conveyance was implicitly in fee simple absolute.
I: the son's not succeeding, as the property was only granted to him for life.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with future interests and the Rule in Shelley's Case. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a grantor who conveyed his property to his son "for life, remainder after the son's death to his heirs." Then, two years later, the son tried to sell the property to his friend, agreeing to convey it in fee simple absolute. But the friend backed out, saying the son couldn't convey a fee simple. The question is about whether the son would succeed in a suit for specific performance, considering the Rule in Shelley's Case applies in this jurisdiction.

First, I need to recall what the Rule in Shelley's Case says. From what I remember, Shelley's Case applies when a grantor creates a life estate in a grantee with a remainder to the grantee's heirs. The rule says that the remainder to the heirs is interpreted as a remainder in fee simple, not a contingent remainder. So the grantee ends up with a fee simple absolute because the life estate and the remainder merge.

Wait, so in the original conveyance, the grantor gave the son a life estate, and the remainder is to his heirs. Under Shelley's Case, that would mean the son actually has a fee simple, right? Because the remainder to his heirs is a class that includes the son's own heirs, which effectively means the son gets the entire estate.

So when the son later tried to sell the property in fee simple, he actually could convey that because under Shelley's Case, he holds a fee simple absolute. But wait, the friend is saying he can't convey a fee simple. But if Shelley's applies, the son does have a fee simple. So the friend's argument doesn't hold.

Wait, but the son only has a life estate unless Shelley's applies. Let me get this straight. The grant was for life, then to the son's heirs. Without Shelley's, the son has a life estate, and the remainder is contingent on the son dying without heirs. But Shelley's changes that. It makes the remainder a vested remainder in fee simple, so the son's life estate plus the remainder in fee simple (which the son holds) would merge into a fee simple absolute.

So the son actually owns the property in fee simple, meaning he can convey the entire interest. Therefore, when he contracted to sell the fee simple, he was capable of doing so. The friend was wrong in saying he couldn't convey a fee simple.

But wait, the question is about specific performance. The son is suing for that. For specific performance, the son must be able to convey a marketable title. If the son actually holds a fee simple, then he can convey it, making the title marketable. So the friend's refusal was based on a mistake.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: Son succeeds because his conveyance divests the contingent remainder. Hmm, but under Shelley's, the remainder is not contingent; it's vested as a remainder in fee, so maybe this isn't correct.

Option B: Son doesn't succeed because heirs must join. But under Shelley's, the son has the fee simple, so the heirs don't have any interest anymore. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Son succeeds because life estate merged with contingent remainder, creating fee simple. Wait, under Shelley's, the remainder is vested, not contingent. So the merger happens, giving the son a fee. So C could be correct.

Option D: Son succeeds because he had fee simple. Yes, that seems right because of Shelley's. So D could be correct.

Option E: Son doesn't succeed because can't convey marketable title. But if he has fee simple, he can, so E is wrong.

Option F: Son doesn't succeed because Rule in Shelly invalidates the remainder. No, Shelley's doesn't invalidate; it interprets the remainder as vested in fee.

Option G: Son doesn't succeed because friend was correct. But friend was wrong because son has fee simple, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Son succeeds because grantor's conveyance was implicitly fee simple. Well, the grant was for life, but Shelley's makes it fee. So H is correct in outcome but maybe the reasoning is slightly off.

Option I: Son doesn't succeed because property was only for life. But Shelley's changes that, so I is incorrect.

Wait, so the possible correct options are C, D, and H. Let me clarify. The grant was "to son for life, remainder to his heirs." Under Shelley's, the son ends up with a fee simple absolute because the remainder is to his heirs, which the rule deems as a remainder in fee. So the life estate and the remainder merge into a fee simple. So the son owns the fee simple.

So when the son contracted to convey fee simple, he was able to do so. The friend's assertion was wrong. So the son can enforce specific performance because he can convey the fee. Therefore, the outcome would be that the son succeeds.

Looking at the options again:

Option C says merger because life estate and contingent remainder create fee. But under Shelley's, the remainder is vested, not contingent. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D says son had fee simple to convey. That's correct because of Shelley's.

Option H says the grant was implicitly fee simple, but the grant was for life, remainder to heirs. So H's reasoning is not accurate because it was Shelley's that made it fee, not an implicit grant.

So the correct answer is D: son's succeeding because he had a fee simple to convey.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me confirm. The original grant was for life, remainder to his heirs, which under Shelley's gives the son a fee simple. So yes, the son has the fee, so when he sells, he can convey fee simple. So when the friend says he can't, the friend is wrong. So the son can get specific performance.

Looking back at the options, D says he had fee simple, which is correct. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but option C says the life estate merged with the contingent remainder. But under Shelley's, the remainder is a vested remainder, so maybe merger is not the right term. Because when the grant is to A for life, then to A's heirs, that's a vested remainder in fee, so A has a fee simple. So the life estate doesn't merge with a contingent remainder but with a vested remainder, which still allows merger into fee simple.

So option C says it's a contingent remainder, which is incorrect. Shelley's makes it vested.

So the correct option is D.

The question revolves around the application of the Rule in Shelley's Case to a conveyance where a grantor gave his son a life estate with a remainder to the son's heirs. Under the Rule in Shelley's Case, when a grantor creates a life estate in a grantee with a remainder to the grantee's heirs, the remainder is interpreted as a vested remainder in fee simple, not a contingent remainder. This results in the life estate and the remainder merging into a fee simple absolute in the grantee (the son). Therefore, the son holds a fee simple absolute, not just a life estate.

When the son later entered into a contract to sell the property in fee simple absolute, he had the legal capacity to do so because he owned the fee simple. The friend's assertion that the son could not convey a fee simple was incorrect. For specific performance to be granted, the son must be able to convey a marketable title, which he could since he held a fee simple absolute.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The remainder is not contingent under Shelley's Case; it is vested in fee simple.
- **B**: Incorrect. The heirs do not need to join because the son holds a fee simple absolute under Shelley's Case.
- **C**: Incorrect. The remainder is vested, not contingent, so the reasoning about a "contingent remainder" is flawed.
- **D**: Correct. The son had a fee simple absolute to convey due to the application of Shelley's Case.
- **E**: Incorrect. The son could convey a marketable title because he held a fee simple absolute.
- **F**: Incorrect. Shelley's Case does not invalidate the remainder; it interprets it as vested in fee simple.
- **G**: Incorrect. The friend was wrong because the son could convey a fee simple.
- **H**: Incorrect. The grant was not implicitly in fee simple; it was the application of Shelley's Case that resulted in the fee simple.
- **I**: Incorrect. The son did not merely have a life estate; he held a fee simple absolute under Shelley's Case.

The correct answer is **D**, as the son had a fee simple absolute to convey, making the friend's objection without merit. 

Answer: D
