Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Nyquist rate and Nyquist interval for two different signals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question has two parts: (a) S_a(200t) and (b) [S_a(200t)] squared. I remember that the Nyquist rate is twice the highest frequency present in the signal to avoid aliasing. The Nyquist interval would then be the reciprocal of the Nyquist rate.

First, let's tackle part (a), S_a(200t). Wait, what does S_a(t) look like? Oh right, S_a is a standard function, probably a sine wave. So S_a(200t) would be a sine function with a frequency scaling. Let me think about the Fourier transform. The function S_a(t) is likely to be a sine wave, say sin(t), but with some scaling.

Wait, no, maybe it's a function with a certain bandwidth. Oh wait, S_a is probably a sine wave, so S_a(200t) would be sin(200t). Or perhaps it's a more complex function, but for the purposes of Nyquist, we're concerned with the highest frequency component.

Assuming S_a(t) is a sine wave, then S_a(200t) would have a frequency of 200/(2π) Hz because the general form is sin(2πft), so 200t = 2πf t → f = 200/(2π) = 100/π Hz. So the frequency here is 100/π cycles per second (Hz). 

Wait, Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency. So the Nyquist rate for S_a(200t) would be 2*(100/π) = 200/π Hz. So that's the Nyquist rate. The Nyquist interval is the inverse, so 1/(200/π) = π/200 seconds. But wait, I need to double-check that.

Wait, wait a second. If S_a(t) is a sine wave, then S_a(200t) is sin(200t). The Fourier transform of sin(200t) is two delta functions at ±200 rad/s. But when we talk about frequency in Hz, we divide by 2π. So 200 rad/s is 200/(2π) Hz = 100/π Hz. So yes, the maximum frequency is 100/π Hz. So Nyquist rate is 2*(100/π) = 200/π Hz. Nyquist interval is 1/(200/π) = π/(200) seconds. But wait, looking at the options, let me see:

Looking at the options, option A says Nyquist rate is 200/pi and interval pi/400. Hmm, because I calculated the interval as pi/200, but option A says pi/400. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, no. Wait, Nyquist interval is 1/(Nyquist rate), right? So if Nyquist rate is 200/pi, then Nyquist interval is pi/200. But option A says pi/400. That's a conflict. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the frequency calculation. Let me think again. Let's say S_a(t) is a sine wave with a certain frequency. For S_a(200t), the function becomes sin(200t). The frequency in terms of Hz would be 200/(2π) = 100/π Hz. So the maximum frequency is 100/π Hz. Nyquist rate is twice that, so 200/π Hz. Nyquist interval is 1/(200/π) = π/200 seconds.

Looking at the options, none of them seem to match. Let me look at the options again. Option D: Nyquist rate for Sa(200t) is 200/pi, interval pi/400. No, that's not matching what I have. Option F: Ny rate 100/pi, interval pi/200. That's lower than what I calculated. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe I need to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps S_a(t) isn't a sine wave? Or maybe I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to S_a as a different function. Wait, maybe S_a(t) is a square wave or a triangular wave, which would have higher frequency components. But that complicates things because then the Nyquist rate would be based on the highest harmonic. However, the question doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's a sine wave.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing angular frequency with Hz. Let me clarify. The function is S_a(200t). Suppose S_a(t) is sin(t), then S_a(200t) is sin(200t), which has an angular frequency of 200 rad/s. The corresponding frequency in Hz is 200/(2π) = 100/π Hz. So the maximum frequency is 100/π Hz, so the Nyquist rate is 200/π Hz, and interval is π/200 s.

Looking back at the options, I don't see any option that has Nyquist rate 200/pi and interval pi/200. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option D: Ny rate 200/pi and interval pi/400. So the interval is half what I thought. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reciprocal. Nyquist rate is 200/pi Hz, so the interval is 1/(200/pi) = pi/200. So that's correct. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: Ny rate 200/pi, interval pi/400.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the maximum frequency. Maybe S_a(200t) has a higher frequency. For example, if S_a(t) is a square wave, the fundamental is 200/(2π), but the harmonics go up. But since the question doesn't specify, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that it's a sine wave.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the function's argument differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the function S_a(200t) has a Fourier transform with a certain bandwidth. Let's say S_a(t) is a signal that is bandlimited to a certain frequency. For example, if S_a(t) is a sinc function, which is bandlimited. But without knowing S_a(t), it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the question is using S_a(t) as a sinusoid with a certain frequency. Let's say S_a(t) = sin(t). Then S_a(200t) = sin(200t). The frequency is 200/(2π) = 100/π Hz. So the maximum frequency is 100/π Hz. Therefore, Nyquist rate is 2*(100/π) = 200/pi Hz. Nyquist interval is 1/(200/pi) = pi/200 s.

Looking for this in the options:

Option D: Nyquist rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. So interval is pi/400, which is half of what I have. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the Nyquist interval. Nyquist interval is the sampling interval, which is the reciprocal of the Nyquist rate. So if Ny rate is 200/pi Hz, then Ny interval is 1/(200/pi) = pi/200 s. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, none of the options have that. Because looking at option A: Ny rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. That would imply that the Ny rate is 400/pi, because 1/(pi/400) is 400/pi. So maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the question defines the function differently. Maybe S_a(200t) is a function with a Fourier transform up to 200 Hz, not 200 rad/s. Oh, because sometimes in signal processing, the frequency is expressed in Hz directly. So if S_a(200t) has a bandwidth of 200 Hz, then the Nyquist rate would be 400 Hz, and interval 1/400 s = 0.0025 s. But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps S_a(200t) is a function whose highest frequency is 200 Hz, so Ny rate is 400 Hz. But none of the options here seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is referring to the function's argument as 200t, implying that the frequency is 200. But in that case, if it's in Hz, then the maximum frequency is 200 Hz, so Ny rate is 400 Hz. But the options don't have that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is S_a(2π*200t), which would make the frequency 200 Hz. Then Ny rate would be 400 Hz, Ny interval 0.0025 s. But again, options don't match.

Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's look at part (b) as well, which is [S_a(200t)] squared. Squaring a function can change its frequency components. Let's think: if S_a(200t) is a sine wave, then squaring it would produce a DC component and a double frequency component. So from sin^2(x), we get (1 - cos(2x))/2. So the highest frequency would now be 400 rad/s, which in Hz is 400/(2π) = 200/π Hz. So the maximum frequency is 200/pi Hz. So Nyquist rate would be 2*(200/pi) = 400/pi Hz. Ny interval is 1/(400/pi) )= pi/400 s.

Wait, but let's make sure. If S_a(200t) is sin(200t), then [S_a(200t)]^2 is sin²(200t) = (1 - cos(400t))/2. So the frequencies present are 0 (DC) and 400/(2π) = 200/pi Hz. So the maximum frequency is 200/pi Hz. Thus, Nyquist rate is 400/pi Hz, Ny interval pi/400 s.

Wait, so for part (a), the Nyquist rate is 200/pi Hz, interval pi/200 s. For part (b), Ny rate 400/pi, interval pi/400 s.

Looking at the options, let's see which matches.

Option A: Sa(200t): 200/pi, interval pi/400. [Sa]²: same as Sa. No, because [Sa]^2 would have a higher Ny rate.

Option B: Sa:50/pi, pi/100; [Sa]^2:400/pi, pi/800.

Option D: Sa:200/pi, pi/400; [Sa]^2:100/pi, pi/200.

Wait, what I calculated for part (b) is Ny rate 400/pi, interval pi/400. Looking for that in the options.

Looking at option A: [Sa]^2 has 200/pi rate, same as Sa. So no.

Option B: [Sa]^2 Ny rate 400/pi, interval pi/800. No, because I calculated pi/400.

Option D: [Sa]^2 Ny rate 100/pi, which is lower than Sa in part (a). That doesn't make sense because squaring increases the frequency. So D is incorrect.

Looking for someone with part (a) having Ny rate 200/pi and interval pi/200, and part (b) 400/pi and pi/400.

Wait, none of the options seem to have that. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let's double-check. If S_a(200t) is sin(200t), then the frequency is 200/(2π) Hz = 100/pi Hz. So Ny rate is 200/pi Hz, interval pi/(200) s.

Now, looking at the options, is there any option where part (a) has Ny rate 200/pi and interval pi/200?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ny rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. No, interval is pi/400.

Option D: Ny rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. Same issue.

Hmmm. Then perhaps I've made a mistake in my assumption about the function. Maybe S_a(t) isn't a sine wave but a different function. Or perhaps the question is considering the function S_a(200t) as having a certain maximum frequency.

Wait, maybe S_a(t) is a triangular wave with a certain frequency. But without knowing, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the function is a sinc function, which is bandlimited. But without more info, I have to proceed with what I have.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between radians and Hz. If S_a(200t) has a maximum angular frequency of 200 rad/s, then the Hz frequency is 200/(2π)= 100/pi Hz. So Ny rate is 200/pi Hz, interval pi/200 s.

But looking at the options, none have that.

Wait, let me look at option F. Option F says Ny rate for Sa is 100/pi and interval pi/200. That would imply that the maximum frequency is 50/pi Hz, which doesn't match. So that's not correct.

Option J: Ny rate pi/100, interval 200/pi for Sa. That would imply maximum freq is pi/200 Hz, which seems too low.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to look for part (a) and (b) together.

In part (a), the Ny rate is 200/pi, interval pi/200. In part (b), it's 400/pi, interval pi/400.

Looking for an option where part (a) is 200/pi and interval pi/200, and part (b) is 400/pi and interval pi/400.

But looking at the options, none of them have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the Nyquist rate for [Sa(200t)]^2 is not 400/pi but 200/pi. Because when you square a sine wave, the highest frequency is 2 times the original. So if the original Sa(200t) is 100/pi Hz, then squared would be 200/pi Hz. So Ny rate would be 2*(200/pi) = 400/pi Hz.

Wait, no, because the maximum frequency after squaring is 200/pi Hz, so Ny rate is 400/pi Hz. So that would be correct.

So then, the correct Ny rates and intervals would be:

(a) Ny rate 200/pi, interval pi/200.

(b) Ny rate 400/pi, interval pi/400.

Looking at the options, the only option that has part (a) as 200/pi and part (b) Ny rate 400/pi is option B. Let me check option B:

Option B: Sa: 50/pi, pi/100; [Sa]^2:400/pi, pi/800.

No, because part (a) in option B is 50/pi, which doesn't match.

Looking at option I:

Option I: Sa:300/pi, pi/600; [Sa]^2:150/pi, pi/300. No.

Option H: Sa:400/pi, pi/800; [Sa]^2:50/pi, pi/100. No.

Option E: Sa:150/pi, pi/300; [Sa]^2:300/pi, pi/600. No.

Option D: Sa:200/pi, pi/400; [Sa]^2:100/pi, pi/200.

Wait, that's not correct because [Sa]^2 should have higher Ny rate than Sa.

Wait, so none of the options seem to have both (a) and (b) correct as I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Alternative approach: Maybe the original function S_a(t) has a bandwidth of 100 Hz, so when it's S_a(200t), the bandwidth becomes 200 Hz. So maximum frequency is 200 Hz. Then Ny rate is 400 Hz. But that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the function S_a(t) has a Fourier transform with a maximum frequency of 200 rad/s. Then, the frequency in Hz is 200/(2pi) = 100/pi Hz. So Ny rate is 200/pi Hz, interval pi/200 s.

Wait, perhaps the correct option isn't present, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in part (b). Let me recalculate part (b).

When you square S_a(200t), you get [S_a(200t)]^2. If S_a(200t) is a sine wave, then as I said before, the square would be (1 - cos(400t))/2. So the frequency components are 0 and 400/(2pi) Hz = 200/pi Hz. So the maximum frequency is 200/pi Hz. Therefore, Ny rate is 400/pi Hz, and interval is pi/400 s.

Looking for an option where (a) is Ny rate 200/pi, and (b) is 400/pi.

Looking again:

Option B: (a) 50/pi, (b)400/pi.

No, because (a) is wrong.

Option A: (a) 200/pi, (b)200/pi. No, because (b) should be higher.

Option D: (a)200/pi, (b)100/pi. No, since (b) should be higher.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps when squaring, the maximum frequency is 200 Hz, not 200/pi Hz. Wait, that would be the case if the original maximum frequency was 100 Hz. Because squaring would take 100 Hz to 200 Hz. Then Ny rate would be 400 Hz, interval 0.0025 s.

But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the original function is S_a(200t) with maximum frequency 200/(2pi) Hz, which is 100/pi Hz. Squaring it, the maximum frequency becomes 200/pi Hz. So Ny rate is 400/pi Hz, interval pi/400 s.

So for part (a): Ny rate 200/pi, interval pi/200.

But looking at the options, I don't see any with that.

Wait, perhaps the options have the interval as pi/400 for part (a). So maybe I miscalculated the interval.

Wait, Nyquist interval is 1/(Ny rate). So if part (a) Ny rate is 200/pi, interval is pi/200, which is 0.0157 s approx. But some options have pi/400, which is half.

Wait, perhaps the Ny rate is twice the bandwidth, which is the maximum frequency. But in part (a), the maximum frequency is 100/pi Hz, so Ny rate is 200/pi, interval pi/200.

But looking at option D: Ny rate 200/pi, interval pi/400. So that's Ny interval of pi/400, which is 0.00785 s, implying a Ny rate of 400/pi, which is double what part (
