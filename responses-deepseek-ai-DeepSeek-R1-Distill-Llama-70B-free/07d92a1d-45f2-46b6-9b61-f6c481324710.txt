Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let me read it again. 

Shannon forgot her pillow while camping, so she had to sleep with her head flat on the ground. She didn't think to use her jeans and sweater as a substitute pillow. The question is asking what psychological concept this illustrates.

Hmm, I remember from my class that there are several cognitive biases and heuristics. Let me think about each option.

Option A is functional fixedness. I think that's when you can't see alternative uses for an object because you're stuck on its usual function. Like, if you have a hammer, you only think of it as something to hit nails, not maybe as a paperweight or something else. So Shannon didn't think to use her clothes as a pillow. That seems to fit. She was fixed on their usual function (wearing) and didn't see their alternative use as a pillow.

Option B is availability heuristic. That's when you judge the likelihood of something based on how easily examples come to mind. Like thinking plane crashes are more common than they are because they're more memorable. Doesn't seem to fit here.

Option C is overconfidence effect. That's when people are too confident in their judgments, even when they're wrong. Not sure how that applies here.

Option D is representativeness heuristic. That's judging the likelihood of something based on how closely it resembles a typical case, rather than the actual probabilities. For example, thinking a tall person is more likely to be a basketball player than a teacher. Doesn't fit this scenario.

Option E is confirmation bias. That's when you focus on information that confirms your existing beliefs. Not relevant here.

Option F is framing effect. That's how the way information is presented affects decisions. Like, "90% fat-free" versus "10% fat." Doesn't seem to apply.

Option G is hindsight bias. Thinking, after an event, that you would have predicted it. Like saying "I knew that would happen" when you didn't. Not directly related here.

Option H is illusion of control. Believing you can influence events that are actually random. Not matching the situation.

Option I is cognitive dissonance. That's discomfort when holding conflicting thoughts, leading to rationalization. Not fitting this example.

Option J is anchoring effect. Relying too much on the first piece of information given. Doesn't fit here.

So, putting it all together. Shannon didn't use her clothes as a pillow substitute. She was fixed on their usual function, which is functional fixedness. So the answer should be A.

The scenario describes Shannon failing to use her jeans and sweater as a makeshift pillow, which illustrates her inability to see alternative uses for these items beyond their typical function. This is a classic example of **functional fixedness**, where one's thinking is constrained by the usual purpose of an object, preventing the recognition of alternative uses.
