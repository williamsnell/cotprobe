Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: If the average distance the free electrons travel between collisions in copper is 4 × 10^-8 meters, how many collisions per second do the electrons make? And what's the time between collisions? They also give the average electron speed in copper as 1.21 × 10^6 m/s. Then there are ten options to choose from.

Alright, so I think the main idea here is about electron motion in metals, probably related to electrical conduction. From what I remember in my physics classes, electrons in a metal move around, but they frequently collide with atoms or other defects, which is why metals have electrical resistance. The average distance they travel before a collision is called the mean free path, I think.

So the given mean free path is lambda (λ) = 4e-8 m, and the average speed is v = 1.21e6 m/s. The question is asking for the number of collisions per second and the time between collisions. Hmm. Let's think about how these relate.

I remember that the number of collisions per second (let's call it f for frequency) would be how many times an electron collides each second. If the electron is moving at a certain speed and covers a certain distance between collisions, the number of collisions per second should relate to how much distance it covers per second divided by the mean free path.

Wait, because if the electron travels a distance λ between collisions, then in one second, it would have gone a distance of v. So the number of λ's in that distance would be v / λ. So f = v / λ. That makes sense because if you go v meters per second, and each collision is every λ meters, then the number of collisions per second is v divided by λ.

Once I have f, the number of collisions per second, the time between collisions (let's call it tau, τ) would just be the reciprocal of f. Because if you collide f times each second, the time between each collision is 1/f seconds.

So putting that into equations:

f = v / λ

τ = 1 / f = λ / v

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me make sure. Because if the speed is v and the distance between collisions is λ, then the time between collisions is the distance divided by the speed. So τ = λ / v.

Yes, that makes sense. Because time = distance / speed. So each collision happens after the electron has traveled λ meters, which at speed v takes λ/v seconds.

And then the number of collisions per second would be 1 divided by τ, so f = v / λ.

Ok, that's the plan. Now plug in the numbers.

Given λ = 4e-8 m, v = 1.21e6 m/s.

First, let's compute f.

f = v / λ = (1.21e6 m/s) / (4e-8 m)

Let me compute that.

1.21e6 divided by 4e-8.

Hmm, 1e6 / 1e-8 is 1e14. So 1.21e6 /4e-8 = (1.21/4) * 1e14.

What's 1.21 divided by 4? Let's see, 1.21 /4 = 0.3025. So 0.3025e14, which is 3.025e13 collisions per second.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at options:

Option B: 3.8e13 and 2.6e-14 s

Option F: 4.0e13 and 2.5e-14 s

Option I: 3.5e13 and 2.8e-14 s

Hmm, so my calculation gives approximately 3.025e13 collisions per second. None of the options exactly match that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division. Let me redo it.

1.21e6 / 4e-8 = (1.21 / 4) * (1e6 / 1e-8) )

1e6 / 1e-8 is 1e14, correct.

1.21 divided by 4 is 0.3025, so 0.3025e14 = 3.025e13.

Hmm, so 3.025e13 collisions per second.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option B: 3.8e13, which is higher. Option I: 3.5e13. Hmm, maybe I should check the calculation again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made an error in the exponent.

Wait, 1.21e6 divided by 4e-8 is (1.21 /4) * (1e6 / 1e-8) = 0.3025 * 1e14 = 3.025e13.

Yes, correct.

But none of the options have 3.025e13. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: wait, no, the formula is correct. So perhaps I should compute the time between collisions first.

Tau = λ / v.

λ is 4e-8 m. v is 1.21e6 m/s.

So Tau = 4e-8 / 1.21e6.

Let me compute that.

4e-8 divided by 1.21e6 is (4 / 1.21) * (1e-8 / 1e6) ) = (approx 3.306) * 1e-14.

Because 1e-8 / 1e6 is 1e-14.

So 3.306e-14 seconds.

Then the number of collisions per second f is 1 / tau = 1 / (3.306e-14) ≈ 3.025e13 per second.

Wait, same result as before.

Looking back at the options, none match exactly, but perhaps one of them is close. Option B is 3.8e13 collisions/s and 2.6e-14 s.

Wait, let me compute 3.8e13 collisions per second. The time between collisions would be 1/(3.8e13) ≈ 2.63e-14 seconds. So the tau is approximately 2.63e-14 s, which matches option B's time of 2.6e-14 s.

Wait, but my calculation for f gives 3.025e13, which is about 3.0e13. So perhaps I need to check the calculation again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the given numbers.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is 4e-8 m? Or perhaps I'm misplacing a decimal. Let me recheck the numbers.

The problem states: average distance is 4 × 10^-8 m, speed is 1.21 ×10^6 m/s.

So the calculation is correct. Hmm. So perhaps the options have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numbers more accurately.

Let me compute 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6.

Compute 4 / 1.21 = approx 3.306.

So 3.306e-14 s.

Which would be approximately 3.31e-14 s.

Then f = 1 / (3.306e-14) = approx 3.026e13 collisions per second.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 3.8e13, 2.6e-14 s.

Option F: 4.0e13, 2.5e-14 s.

Hmm, none of these match exactly. So perhaps I should think about whether the question is correct, or if I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the speed given is the root mean square speed, or maybe it's the drift velocity? No, the question says average electron speed, which I think is the drift velocity. But wait, in metals, the electrons move with a drift velocity which is much smaller than their thermal speeds. But in this question, it's given as 1.21e6 m/s, which seems high, but perhaps that's the correct value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the Fermi velocity, but that's another topic.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given speed is the average speed between collisions, which is the same as the drift velocity. So the approach is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation is more precise. Let's compute 4e-8 / 1.21e6 more precisely.

4 / 1.21 = let me compute that exactly.

1.21 × 3 = 3.63. 4 -3.63=0.37.

So 3 + 0.37 /1.21 → 0.37/1.21 ≈ 0.305.

So 3.3058 approximately.

So 3.3058e-14 s.

Which is approximately 3.306e-14 s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest time is option B's 2.6e-14 s, but that's lower than what I have. So perhaps I made a mistake in the speed or the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path is 4e-8 meters, which is 40 nanometers. That seems plausible for copper.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be f = v / lambda.

Wait, but I did that and got 3.025e13 collisions/s.

Looking at the options again, none of them have exactly that. Option B is 3.8e13, which is higher. Option I is 3.5e13, which is a bit higher than my result.

Hmm, perhaps I should check my calculation.

Wait, 1.21e6 divided by 4e-8 is?

Yes, 1.21e6 = 1,210,000.

4e-8 = 0.00000004.

So 1,210,000 / 0.00000004 = ?

Let me compute that.

Dividing 1,210,000 by 0.00000004.

Hmm, 1e6 / 4e-8 = 1e14 /4 = 2.5e13. But wait, no.

Wait, 1.21e6 ÷ 4e-8 = (1.21 /4) * 1e6 / 1e-8 → 0.3025 * 1e14 = 3.025e13.

Yes, correct.

But looking at the options, the only one close is option I: 3.5e13 collisions/s and 2.8e-14 s.

Wait, let me compute option I's time.

If f is 3.5e13, then time is 1/(3.5e13) ≈ 2.857e-14 s, which is approximately 2.86e-14 s. But option I says 2.8e-14 s, which matches.

So perhaps I should see which option gives the correct product: f * tau should equal 1.

Because f is per second, tau is in seconds, so f*tau is unitless, and should equal 1.

Let me check option B: f=3.8e13, tau=2.6e-14.

3.8e13 * 2.6e-14 = (3.8 * 2.6) * 1e-1 ≈9.88e-1, which is ~0.988, approximately 1. Close enough, considering rounding.

Option I: f=3.5e13, tau=2.8e-14. 3.5e13 * 2.8e-14 = (3.5*2.8) *1e-1 → 9.8e-1, so 0.98, which is also approximately 1. So both B and I are close.

But according to my calculation, f should be ~3.025e13, which is closer to 3.0e13. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 4e-8 /1.21e6.

Wait, 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6.

4 / 1.21 = 3.306.

So 3.306e-14 s.

So the time between collisions is approximately 3.3e-14 s.

Which would make f=1/(3.3e-14)= approx 3e13 collisions/s.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option B's 3.8e13 and 2.6e-14 s. Wait, no, because 1/(3.8e13) is 2.63e-14 s, which is what option B says. But that would give tau=2.63e-14 s, which is less than my calculated 3.3e-14 s.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should check what the product of each option's f and tau is, to see which equals 1.

Because f * tau should equal 1 second * (collisions/s * s/collision) )= unitless 1.

So for option B: 3.8e13 * 2.6e-14 = (3.8 * 2.6) * 1e-1 → 9.88 * 0.1= 0.988, which is ~0.99. Close to 1.

Option I: 3.5e13 * 2.8e-14 = (3.5 * 2.8) * 1e-1 → 9.8 * 0.1=0.98 → close to 1.

Option F: 4e13 * 2.5e-14 = (4 *2.5) *1e-1=10 *0.1=1 → exactly 1.

Wait, that's interesting.

So option F's product is exactly 1. So f=4e13, tau=2.5e-14.

So 4e13 *2.5e-14 =1e0.

Which is correct. So perhaps option F is the right answer.

Wait, but according to my calculation, f should be 3.025e13, which is lower than 4e13.

So what's going on here? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the mean free path and speed.

Wait, the mean free path is 4e-8 m, and speed is 1.21e6 m/s.

So time between collisions is lambda / v.

So 4e-8 / 1.21e6 = (4 / 1.21) * 1e-14 = approximately 3.306 * 1e-14 = 3.306e-14 s.

Which gives f = 1 / 3.306e-14 ≈ 3.025e13 collisions/s.

But in option F, f is 4e13, which is higher. So how does that match?

Wait, perhaps I have the formulas backward. Maybe the number of collisions is lambda divided by v? No, that doesn't make sense. Because higher speed would mean more collisions per second, which aligns with f= v/lambda.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. So perhaps the given data is different. Let me make sure I read the numbers correctly.

Question says: average distance is 4 ×10^-8 m, speed is 1.21×10^6 m/s.

Wait, perhaps I should check for any calculation errors.

Wait, 4e-8 / 1.21e6 = (4 / 1.21) * 1e-14.

4 divided by 1.21 is approximately 3.306, so 3.306e-14 s.

So f = 1 / 3.306e-14 ≈ 3.025e13.

So none of the options exactly match, but option B is 3.8e13 and 2.63e-14 s.

Wait, wait—let me compute 1.21e6 /4e-8.

1.21e6 is 1,210,000.

4e-8 is 0.00000004.

So 1,210,000 / 0.00000004 = ?

Let me compute that division.

1,210,000 ÷ 0.00000004 = 1,210,000 / 4e-8 = (1,210,000 /4) *1e8.

1,210,000 /4 = 302,500.

302500 * 1e8 = 3.025e13.

Yes, that's what I got earlier.

Hmm. So I'm confident in my calculation, but the options don't have that exact value. So perhaps the correct answer is closest to option B or I.

Wait, let's look again:

Option B: 3.8e13, 2.6e-14 s.

Option I:3.5e13, 2.8e-14 s.

Option F:4e13, 2.5e-14 s.

Wait, perhaps the calculation expects the use of drift velocity, which is lower than the actual speed. But in this case, the speed given is 1.21e6 m/s, which seems high. Wait, no, that's approximately the Fermi velocity for copper, which is about 1.56e6 m/s. So 1.21e6 might be a bit lower, but perhaps it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 4e-8 /1.21e6 again.

4e-8 = 4 * 1e-8 = 0.00000004.

1.21e6 = 1,210,000.

0.00000004 ÷ 1,210,000 = 4e-8 / 1.21e6.

Wait, 4e-8 divided by 1.21e6 is same as (4 /1.21) * (1e-8 / 1e6) )= 3.306 * 1e-14 =3.306e-14 s.

So tau is 3.306e-14 s, so f=1/tau=3.025e13.

Looking for an option where f is approx 3e13 and tau is approx 3.3e-14 s.

Looking again, none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the formula is correct: time between collisions
