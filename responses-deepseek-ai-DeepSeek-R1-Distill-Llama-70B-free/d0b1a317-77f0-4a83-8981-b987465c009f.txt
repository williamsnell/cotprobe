Okay, so I've got this problem here about heating water with an immersion heater. Hmm, let me think about what I know. I remember that when you heat water, you're transferring energy into it, which increases its temperature. The key here is probably calculating the heat added and then using that to find the temperature change.

The problem says the system is 82.5 grams of liquid water at 300 K. It's heated at constant pressure of 1.00 bar. The immersion heater uses a current of 1.75 A through a 25.0 ohm resistor for 100 seconds. I need to find the final temperature.

Wait, right, the formula for the energy transferred by electrical work is probably the key. Oh yeah, the power delivered by a resistor is P = I²R, where I is current and R resistance. Then the energy Q is power multiplied by time.

So first, let me calculate the energy. I is 1.75 A, R is 25 ohms. So P = (1.75)^2 * 25. Let me compute that. 1.75 squared is 3.0625. Multiply by 25: 3.0625 * 25. Hmm, 3 *25 is 75, 0.0625 *25 is 1.5625. So total is 76.5625 watts? Wait, no, wait, because the unit is in ohms, volts would be I*R, but power is I²R, so that's correct in watts.

Wait, but wait, the time is in seconds, so Q = P * t. So Q = 76.5625 W * 100 s = 7656.25 joules. But wait, let me double-check that. 1.75^2 is (7/4)^2 = 49/16, which is 3.0625. Multiply by 25 gives 76.5625. Multiply by 100 gives 7656.25 J. Yeah.

Now, this Q is the heat energy added to the water. But wait, at constant pressure, the heat Q is related to the temperature change by Q = m * c_p * ΔT. Oh wait, but wait, since it's at constant pressure, yes, we use the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p for water.

So I need the specific heat capacity of water at constant pressure. I remember that the specific heat of water is about 4.184 J/g·K, but wait, is that at constant pressure or volume? Oh right, at constant pressure, c_p for water is approximately 4.184 J/g·K. So that's what I'll use.

The mass m is 82.5 grams. So, rearranging the formula, ΔT = Q / (m * c_p).

Plugging in the numbers, Q is 7656.25 J, m is 82.5 g, c_p is 4.184 J/g·K.

So ΔT = 7656.25 / (82.5 * 4.184).

Let me compute the denominator first. 82.5 * 4.184. Let's see: 80 *4.184 is 335. 2.5 *4.184 is about 10.46. So total denominator is approx 335 + 10.46 = 345.46. Wait, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

82.5 *4.184: Let's compute 80 *4.184 = 335.0 (since 4.184 * 80 = 335.12?), wait, 4 *80=320, 0.184 *80=14.72, so 320+14.72=334.72. Then 2.5 *4.184 = 10.46. So total denominator is 334.72 +10.46 = 345.18 approximately.

So ΔT = 7656.25 / 345.18. Let me compute that. Let's divide 7656 by 345. Let's see, 345 *22 is 7590, right? Because 345 *20=6900, 345*2=690, so 20+2=22 gives 7590. 7656-7590=66. So 66/345 is about 0.191. So ΔT ≈22.191 K?

Wait, wait, that can't be right because 22 degrees increase would make the final temperature 322 K, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 7656.25 J divided by (82.5 *4.184) = 7656.25 / (345.18) ≈ 22.19 K. So the temperature change is about 22.19 degrees. So the initial temp is 300 K, so final is 300 +22.19 = 322.19 K. So approximately 322 K.

Looking at the options, option A is 322 K. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another way to compute 82.5 *4.184. Let me compute 82.5 *4 = 330, 82.5 *0.184: 82.5 *0.1=8.25, 82.5 *0.08=6.6, 82.5 *0.004=0.33. So 8.25+6.6=14.85 +0.33=15.18. So total is 330 +15.18=345.18 J/(g·K) *g = 345.18 J/K.

Wait, Q is 7656.25 J. So 7656.25 /345.18 = let me compute that more accurately.

Let me do it step by step. 345.18 * 22 = 345 *22 + 0.18*22 = (345*20=6900) + (345*2=690) → 7590, plus 3.96 →7593.96.

So 345.18 *22 = 7593.96.

So 7656.25 -7593.96 = 62.29 remaining. Now, 62.29 /345.18 ≈ 0.18. So total is 22.18 K. So ΔT≈22.18 K. So final T is 300 +22.18=322.18 K, which rounds to about 322 K. So the answer should be A:322 K.

To determine the final temperature of the water, we calculate the energy transferred to the water using the immersion heater and then use this energy to find the temperature change.

1. **Calculate the energy transferred (Q):**  
   The power delivered by the resistor is given by \( P = I^2 R \), where \( I = 1.75 \, \mathrm{A} \) and \( R = 25.0 \, \Omega \).  
   \[
   P = (1.75)^2 \cdot 25 = 3.0625 \cdot 25 = 76.5625 \, \mathrm{W}.
   \]  
   The energy transferred over \( t = 100 \, \mathrm{s} \) is:  
   \[
   Q = P \cdot t = 76.5625 \cdot 100 = 7656.25 \, \mathrm{J}.
   \]

2. **Relate energy to temperature change:**  
   At constant pressure, the heat energy is related to the temperature change by \( Q = m \cdot c_p \cdot \Delta T \), where \( m = 82.5 \, \mathrm{g} \) is the mass of water, and \( c_p = 4.184 \, \mathrm{J/g \cdot K} \) is the specific heat capacity of water at constant pressure. Rearranging for \( \Delta T \):  
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{Q}{m \cdot c_p}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{7656.25}{82.5 \cdot 4.184}.
   \]  
   First, calculate the denominator:  
   \[
   82.5 \cdot 4.184 = 345.18 \, \mathrm{J/K}.
   \]  
   Then, calculate \( \Delta T \):  
   \[
   \Delta T = \frac{7656.25}{345.18} \approx 22.19 \, \mathrm{K}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the final temperature:**  
   The initial temperature of the water is \( T_{\text{initial}} = 300 \, \mathrm{K} \). Adding the temperature change:  
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = T_{\text{initial}} + \Delta T = 300 + 22.19 = 322.19 \, \mathrm{K}.
   \]  
   Rounding to the nearest whole number, \( T_{\text{final}} \approx 322 \, \mathrm{K} \).

4. **Select the correct option:**  
   From the given options, the closest match is **A: 322 K**.
