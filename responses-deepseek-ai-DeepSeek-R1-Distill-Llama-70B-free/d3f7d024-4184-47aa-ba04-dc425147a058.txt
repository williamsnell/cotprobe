Question:

A riot broke out in a city, and many shops had been looted and some had been burned during the riots. Goods of all kinds were in piles or strewn about the sidewalk. During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should

Options:

A: affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.
B: affirm the conviction because the defendant was provided with an attorney, but reverse the reimbursement order.
C: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was not properly informed of his rights.
D: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not informed of the consequences of waiving his right to a jury trial, but affirm the reimbursement order.
E: reverse the conviction because the defendant was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement order.
F: affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.
G: reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.
H: reverse the reimbursement order because it exceeds the maximum fine for grand larceny, but affirm the conviction.
I: affirm the reimbursement order, but not the conviction.
J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.

Okay, so I have this question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the right to self-representation and reimbursement orders. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant who was involved in a riot where shops were looted and burned. He picked up a portable TV from the sidewalk and was arrested for grand larceny. The charges carry up to seven months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 

At his arraignment, the judge tells him about his right to an appointed attorney. But the defendant says he wants to represent himself and waive a jury trial. The judge questions him and isn't persuaded by his reasons, so he appoints an attorney anyway. The attorney later says the defendant wants a non-jury trial, but the prosecution requests a jury, which the court grants. The defendant is convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months. He's also ordered to pay $450 for the attorney's costs.

He appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The question is what the appellate court should do.

First, I need to think about the defendant's right to self-representation. I remember that the Supreme Court case Faretta v. California (1975) established that a defendant has the right to represent himself, but the court must ensure that the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. So the judge here questioned the defendant but didn't find his reasons persuasive and denied the request. Was the judge's decision correct?

In Faretta, the Court said that the trial judge has discretion to deny self-representation if it's not in the defendant's best interest, but the defendant's knowing waiver is key. Here, the defendant said he didn't trust lawyers and had no legal experience. The judge wasn't persuaded, so he appointed an attorney. I think the issue is whether the judge properly determined that the defendant's waiver was intelligent. Since the defendant was informed of his rights and the judge questioned him, maybe the denial was appropriate. So perhaps the conviction isn't reversed on self-representation grounds.

Next, the jury trial aspect. The defendant initially wanted to waive a jury trial, but later through his attorney, he again requested a non-jury trial, which the prosecution opposed, and the court impaneled a jury. Wait, but I thought that in some states, both the defendant and the prosecution must agree to waive a jury trial, or is it that the defendant has the right to demand a jury? Or is it the other way around?

Actually, under the Constitution, the right to a jury trial can be waived by the defendant, but the prosecution doesn't have a constitutional right to a jury trial. So if the defendant wants a bench trial, he can have it, unless the court for some reason denies it. But here, the defendant initially wanted to represent himself and waive the jury, but after the attorney was appointed, the attorney told the court he wanted a non-jury trial. However, the prosecution requested a jury, and the court granted that. So was the court's decision to impanel a jury against the defendant's wishes proper?

Wait, no. The right to a jury trial is the defendant's, and if the defendant (through his attorney) wants to waive it, the court should honor that, unless there's a good reason not to. But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the prosecution can force a jury trial against the defendant's will. I think that the defendant can unilaterally waive a jury trial, but the prosecution can't demand it. So if the defendant wanted a bench trial, the court shouldn't have granted the prosecution's request for a jury. So that might mean the conviction should be reversed because the court shouldn't have impaneled a jury against the defendant's wishes.

Wait, but in this scenario, the defendant initially wanted to represent himself and waive the jury. Then, after the attorney was appointed, the attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. So the defendant's position was consistent. But the court allowed the prosecution to have a jury. If the defendant's waiver was valid, then the court erred by not granting a bench trial. So that could mean the conviction is reversed.

Now, the second issue is the reimbursement order of $450. The question says this was pursuant to a relevant statute. I recall that under some statutes, the court can order a defendant to reimburse the state for the cost of appointed counsel. However, this is subject to certain limitations. For example, in Fuller v. Oregon (1976), the Supreme Court held that a defendant's ability to pay must be considered, but the state can impose such costs unless it's a violation of due process or equal protection. But more importantly, I think that when a defendant is acquitted, they can't be forced to reimburse costs, but when convicted, it's permissible.

But wait, another point: if the defendant was denied his right to self-representation, does that affect the reimbursement order? Because if he wasn't allowed to represent himself, and thus had to have an attorney, can the court then charge him for the attorney? Or is that a separate issue?

Alternatively, if the initial denial of self-representation was wrong, then the conviction would be reversed, but maybe the reimbursement order is a separate issue. Or if the court improperly forced an attorney on him, does that impact the reimbursement?

Wait, but in the scenario, the court appointed an attorney despite the defendant's waiver. So if the defendant was wrongly denied self-representation, then the entire trial is tainted, including the conviction and perhaps the reimbursement order. But I'm not sure if the reimbursement is directly tied to the validity of the conviction.

Alternatively, the reimbursement order is a separate issue. The statute allows it regardless of the trial's outcome, but I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option E says reverse the conviction because he was not allowed to represent himself, but affirm the reimbursement. That would fit if the self-representation denial was error, but the reimbursement is okay.

Option J says reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but affirm reimbursement.

Wait, but earlier I thought both the self-representation and the jury trial issues could be in play. But perhaps one of them is the main issue.

Wait, the initial problem is that the judge didn't allow the defendant to represent himself. So the court's decision to appoint an attorney despite the defendant's waiver may have been an error. But the standard is that the defendant must make a knowing and intelligent waiver. Here, the judge questioned him and found his reasons not persuasive. So maybe the judge's decision was correct, and the defendant didn't make a proper waiver.

Because the defendant had no legal experience and the judge didn't find his reasons persuasive, perhaps the court properly exercised its discretion to deny self-representation. So the conviction wouldn't be reversed on that ground.

But the jury trial issue: the defendant, through counsel, wanted a bench trial. The prosecution wanted a jury. The court granted the prosecution's request. But the defendant's right to a jury trial is a personal right; he can waive it. So if the defendant wanted a bench trial, the court should have granted it, unless there's a state law that requires both parties to agree. Wait, but in federal courts, the defendant can unilaterally waive a jury trial. I think in most states, the defendant can waive a jury trial without the prosecution's consent. So the court erred by forcing a jury trial against the defendant's wishes.

So the conviction should be reversed because the court shouldn't have impaneled a jury when the defendant wanted a bench trial.

Now, regarding the reimbursement order: the defendant was convicted, so the state can order reimbursement if the statute allows. But in this case, the conviction is being reversed because of the jury trial issue. So does that mean the reimbursement order is also reversed? Or is the reimbursement a separate issue that stands even if the conviction is overturned?

I think that if the conviction is reversed, the case would be remanded, possibly for a new trial. But the reimbursement is tied to the conviction. If the conviction is reversed, perhaps the reimbursement order is also reversed because it's part of the sentence.

But looking at the options, let's see.

Option D: reverse the conviction because not informed of consequences of waiving jury, affirm reimbursement.

Wait, the issue here is not about waiving jury trial but being forced to have one. So D might not be the right fit.

Option J: reverse conviction because denied non-jury trial, affirm reimbursement.

If the conviction is reversed, the sentence (including reimbursement) might be vacated as well. So if the appellate court reverses the conviction, the reimbursement order would likely be reversed too.

Wait, but the options don't all have both reversed. Let me look again.

Option E: reverse conviction (self-representation), affirm reimbursement.

Option J: reverse conviction (jury trial), affirm reimbursement.

Option G: reverse both, but that's about self-representation.

Wait, but in this case, the main issue I think is the jury trial, not the self-representation. Because the self-representation denial was perhaps correct.

Wait, the initial issue: the defendant was not allowed to represent himself, but the judge's decision was based on the defendant's lack of experience and the judge not finding his reasons persuasive. So the court's decision to appoint an attorney despite the waiver would be upheld if the waiver wasn't knowing and intelligent.

In Faretta, the court must determine whether the defendant fully understands the consequences. If the defendant doesn't, the waiver isn't valid. Here, the judge questioned him and found the reasons unpersuasive. It's possible that the waiver wasn't intelligent, so the court's decision was correct. Therefore, the self-representation issue isn't a problem.

So the main issue is the jury trial. The defendant wanted a bench trial, but the court granted the prosecution's request for a jury. That would be error because the defendant has the right to waive a jury trial. So the conviction should be reversed on that ground.

Now, the reimbursement: since the conviction is reversed, the order for reimbursement would also be vacated. Because the reimbursement is part of the sentence, which is being overturned. So both would be reversed.

Looking at the options again, option J says reverse conviction (jury), affirm reimbursement. That's not what I concluded.

Option D: reverse conviction (jury waiver consequences), affirm reimbursement.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating two issues. Let me think again.

If the defendant's conviction is reversed because the court wrongly allowed a jury trial, then on remand, the case would be retried, possibly with a bench trial. The reimbursement order is for the appointed counsel in the first trial. If the first trial is deemed invalid, does that mean the defendant shouldn't have to pay for the attorney? Or can the state still seek reimbursement?

I'm not entirely sure, but I think that if the conviction is reversed, the sentence, including the reimbursement, is also vacated. So if the appellate court reverses the conviction, the reimbursement order would also be reversed.

Looking at the options, none of them say reverse both. Let me check:

Option C: reverse both because not informed of rights. But the defendant was informed of his rights.

Option G: reverse both because denied self-rep. But I don't think that's the case.

Option E: reverse conviction (self-rep), affirm reimbursement.

Option J: reverse conviction (jury), affirm reimbursement.

Wait, perhaps the reimbursement order is a separate issue. The statute allows it regardless of the outcome of the trial. So even if the conviction is reversed, the state can still seek reimbursement for the costs of the attorney during the invalid trial. But that doesn't seem right because the defendant shouldn't be penalized for the state's mistake.

Alternatively, the reimbursement is part of the sentence and must be reversed along with the conviction.

But the options don't have an option that reverses both the conviction and the reimbursement. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options, I see:

Option E: reverse conviction (self-rep), affirm reimbursement.

Option J: reverse conviction (jury), affirm reimbursement.

Option D: reverse conviction (jury waiver), affirm reimbursement.

Option G: reverse both because self-rep.

Option H: reverse reimbursement because it exceeds max fine, but affirm conviction.

Wait, the max fine was $1000, and the reimbursement was $450. So it's under, so H's reasoning is wrong.

Wait, the question says the maximum penalty is seven months and a $1000 fine. The defendant was sentenced to six months and ordered to pay $450. So the reimbursement is within the fine limit. So H is incorrect.

So the issue is whether the reimbursement order can stand even if the conviction is reversed.

Maybe the reimbursement isn't automatically reversed. Because the defendant did have an attorney appointed, regardless of the trial's outcome. So even if the trial was flawed, the state might still be able to seek reimbursement for the costs incurred.

But I'm not certain about this. In some jurisdictions, if the conviction is reversed, the defendant might not have to pay the reimbursement because the case is being retried or dismissed. But in other cases, the cost of the attorney is a separate matter.

But in the scenario, the reimbursement was made pursuant to a statute. So the statute's validity would be a factor. However, the issue here isn't the statute's constitutionality but whether the order can stand after the conviction is reversed.

I think that the reimbursement order is part of the sentence and would be vacated upon reversal of the conviction. So both would be reversed. But looking at the options, none of them have both reversed except G, which is about self-representation.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the self-representation denial was correct, so G is not the right option.

So perhaps the correct answer is J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but affirm the reimbursement order. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reimbursement order is valid regardless of the conviction's outcome because it's based on the defendant's indigency and the services provided. So even if the conviction is reversed, the defendant still received the services and has to pay. But I think that's not the case; the reimbursement is part of the sentence, which is overturned.

So I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to think of it another way.

The main issues are:

1. Was the defendant properly allowed to represent himself? The judge didn't think so, but the defendant's waiver might have been valid. If the waiver was invalid, then the court's appointment was correct.

2. Was the defendant's right to a bench trial violated when the court impaneled a jury over his objection? If yes, then the conviction should be reversed.

Assuming the second issue is the main problem, then the conviction is reversed. As for the reimbursement, it's tied to the conviction, so it's also reversed. But none of the options say both are reversed except G, which is based on self-rep.

Wait, perhaps the reimbursement order is a separate civil matter, but in this case, it's part of the criminal sentence. So when the conviction is reversed, the sentence, including the reimbursement, is vacated.

But looking at the options again, let's see which one fits.

Option E: reverse conviction (self-rep), affirm reimbursement.

Option J: reverse conviction (jury), affirm reimbursement.

Option D: reverse conviction (jury waiver), affirm reimbursement.

But none of these say reverse both. So perhaps the answer is E or J, but the reasoning is that the reimbursement stands even if the conviction is reversed.

Alternatively, maybe the reimbursement is not affected because it's a separate order based on the statute, regardless of the trial outcome. So even if the defendant is retried, he still has to pay for the attorney in the first trial.

Hmm. Maybe in that case, the reimbursement order is affirmed even if the conviction is reversed.

So the answer would be J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but affirm the reimbursement order.

Wait, but the question says the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450. If the conviction is reversed, would that order still stand? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's considered a separate order that isn't necessarily tied to the conviction.

Alternatively, the reimbursement is part of the sentence, so it's vacated when the conviction is reversed. But I'm not certain.

If I have to choose between the options, I think the main issue is the jury trial, so the conviction is reversed, but the reimbursement order is a separate matter that could still stand. So the answer would be J.

Wait, no, because the defendant's right to a non-jury trial is a fundamental right, so the conviction should be reversed. The reimbursement order, though, is based on the statute and the fact that an attorney was provided, regardless of the trial's outcome. So perhaps it's affirmed.

So the answer would be J: reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.

Wait, no, option J says 'but not the reimbursement order.' So that means the reimbursement is affirmed.

I think that's the correct approach. So I'll go with option J.
</think>

The question revolves around two main issues: the defendant's right to self-representation and the right to a non-jury trial, as well as the validity of the reimbursement order for the cost of appointed counsel. Here's the analysis:

### 1. **Right to Self-Representation**
The defendant initially waived his right to counsel and requested to represent himself. However, the judge, after questioning the defendant, determined that his waiver was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, citing his lack of legal experience and unpersuasive reasons for self-representation. Under **Faretta v. California (1975)**, a defendant's waiver of counsel must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. While the defendant expressed distrust in lawyers, the judge's decision to appoint counsel appears justified given the defendant's lack of legal expertise and the complexity of the case. Therefore, the denial of self-representation does not constitute reversible error.

### 2. **Right to a Non-Jury Trial**
The defendant, through his appointed attorney, consistently requested a bench trial. However, the prosecution requested a jury trial, which the court granted. The Constitution guarantees the defendant's right to waive a jury trial, and this right is personal to the defendant. The prosecution does not have a constitutional right to demand a jury trial. By forcing a jury trial over the defendant's objection, the court violated the defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment. This error requires reversal of the conviction.

### 3. **Reimbursement Order**
The defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 for the cost of appointed counsel. This order was made pursuant to a statute, and such reimbursement orders are generally permissible if the defendant is convicted, provided the amount does not exceed the defendant's ability to pay. Although the conviction is being reversed due to the jury trial error, the reimbursement order is a separate issue. The defendant received the services of an attorney, and the statute allows for reimbursement regardless of the trial's outcome. Therefore, the reimbursement order should be affirmed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The conviction cannot stand due to the violation of the defendant's right to a non-jury trial.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the conviction should be reversed, the reimbursement order is valid and should be affirmed.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The defendant was properly informed of his rights, so this is not a basis for reversal.
-
