Question:

Dr. Sam Solo is the only psychologist in a small town, and his son is enrolled in the town's only elementary school. Dr. Solo receives a call from his son's teacher who says she would like to begin therapy with him. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Solo should:

Options:

A: tell the teacher that he can only see her if she agrees to switch his son to a different class.
B: begin therapy with her but avoid discussing his son or any school-related matters.
C: begin therapy with her and discuss the potential for conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions.
D: suggest that the teacher seek therapy with a different professional to avoid any potential conflict of interest.
E: refuse therapy and refer her to a psychologist in a neighboring town.
F: accept the teacher as a client, but only after discussing the situation with the school board.
G: tell the teacher that he is ethically prohibited from seeing her because to do so would constitute a multiple (dual) relationship.

Okay, so I have this question about ethics in psychology. Let me read it carefully.

Dr. Sam Solo is the only psychologist in a small town, and his son is in the town's only elementary school. The teacher calls him to start therapy. The question is about what Dr. Solo should do ethically.

The options are A through G. Let me think about each one.

First, I remember that psychologists have ethical guidelines, especially regarding dual relationships. A dual relationship is when a psychologist has another relationship with a client outside of therapy, which can create conflicts of interest or impair judgment.

In this case, Dr. Solo's son is a student of the teacher. So if he takes the teacher as a client, there's a potential dual relationship because the teacher has a direct impact on his son's education and well-being. That could create a conflict. For example, if the teacher is his client, Dr. Solo might feel pressured to treat her differently, or she might feel uncomfortable evaluating his son fairly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: He tells the teacher she must switch his son's class. That seems coercive. Making demands like that isn't ethical, especially since it's not the teacher's fault. Plus, that could harm his son's education. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: He begins therapy but avoids discussing his son or school matters. But that might not be possible. Issues related to the son could come up in therapy, and avoiding them might hinder the teacher's treatment. Also, ignoring the elephant in the room isn't addressing the conflict. So B might not be the best choice.

Option C: He starts therapy and discusses potential conflicts in the initial session. That sounds proactive. They could talk about how the dual relationship might affect things and maybe set boundaries. But wait, the problem is that the dual relationship itself is a conflict of interest. Even if they discuss it, does that make it okay? I'm not sure. I think the ethical guidelines might actually advise against entering into such a dual relationship if it's unavoidable, especially when there's a clear power imbalance or potential for harm.

Option D: Suggest she sees another professional. That makes sense because it avoids the conflict of interest. Since he's the only psychologist in town, maybe he can refer her to someone else nearby. But the question says he's the only one in town. So maybe he can refer her to a neighboring town's psychologist.

Option E: Refuse and refer her elsewhere. This is similar to D. Wait, E says refuse and refer to a neighboring town. So that's possible. But if E is an option, why would D be correct? Let me look again. Option D says "suggest that the teacher seek therapy with a different professional to avoid any potential conflict of interest." So D is about suggesting a different professional, which could be in the same town or elsewhere. But since he's the only one, he'd have to refer outside.

Option F: Accept but discuss with the school board. That seems unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate. The school board's involvement might not be required unless there's a policy, but ethically, the psychologist should handle it without involving others unless necessary.

Option G: He says he can't see her because it's a dual relationship. That's similar to E and D. But G is a statement about being prohibited, which might not always be the case. It's possible to have dual relationships, but they're generally discouraged unless the benefits outweigh the risks, and other options are unavailable.

Thinking about the APA Ethics Code, specifically Standard 3.06, which talks about conflict of interest. Psychologists should avoid taking on roles where their personal interests could impair their judgment. Here, Dr. Solo's son's education is a significant personal interest. So, taking on the teacher as a client could create a conflict.

Standard 3.05 about multiple relationships (dual relationships) says that psychologists should avoid them if it could impair their work or exploit the client. So, the best course is to avoid entering into the dual relationship.

So, the ethical decision would be to not take her on as a client. Now, the options are D and E. D suggests referring to another professional, which might not be possible since he's the only psychologist in town. So, E says refuse and refer to a neighboring town. That would be the right action.

Alternatively, if he can suggest another professional, but since he's the only one, he might have to refer elsewhere, making E the correct choice.

Wait, but another thought: Option C suggests discussing the conflict. Maybe that's acceptable if they can navigate it. But given the potential for significant conflict, it's better to avoid it entirely. So, the best ethical action is to refuse and refer elsewhere.

So the correct answer is E: refuse therapy and refer her to another psychologist in a neighboring town.

Dr. Sam Solo faces an ethical dilemma as the only psychologist in a small town where his son is enrolled in the elementary school. The teacher, who has influence over his son's education, requests therapy. Ethical guidelines in psychology, particularly those related to dual relationships (Standard 3.05) and conflict of interest (Standard 3.06), caution against entering into professional relationships that could impair judgment or create exploitation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is coercive and unethical, as it involves making demands that could harm his son's education.
- **Option B** avoids discussing the conflict, which is not ideal as it ignores the potential impact of the dual relationship on therapy.
- **Option C** involves discussing the conflict but does not resolve the inherent ethical issue of the dual relationship.
- **Option D** suggests referring the teacher to another professional, which aligns with ethical principles but may not be feasible since Dr. Solo is the only psychologist in town.
- **Option E** involves refusing therapy and referring the teacher to a psychologist in a neighboring town, which effectively avoids the conflict of interest and adheres to ethical guidelines.
- **Option F** unnecessarily involves the school board and does not directly address the ethical issue.
- **Option G** correctly identifies the dual relationship but does not provide a constructive solution.

Given the potential for significant conflict of interest and the ethical imperative to avoid dual relationships, the most appropriate course of action is to refuse therapy and refer the teacher to a psychologist in a neighboring town. This ensures that ethical standards are upheld and avoids any potential harm or bias.

**Answer: E**
