Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy change during the vaporization of water. Hmm. Let me think about what I know. Entropy change, right. I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder, and when a substance goes from liquid to gas, the disorder increases, so the entropy should be positive.

The question gives the molar heat of vaporization as +43.9 kJ. Wait, molar heat of vaporization is the amount of energy required to vaporize a mole of liquid. Oh right, it's the enthalpy change (ΔH) for vaporization. And since it's positive, that means energy is absorbed, which makes sense because you need to add heat to turn water into steam.

Now, the formula I think I need is ΔS = q_rev / T. But wait, q_rev is the heat at a reversible process, which would be at a constant temperature, right? Since vaporization at a certain temperature, we can use the molar heat and the temperature.

But what's the temperature here? Oh, right, the standard molar heat of vaporization is measured at the boiling point. So for water, the boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius, which is 373 Kelvin.

So plugging the numbers in. The ΔH is 43.9 kJ per mole. Oh wait, the formula uses the heat at constant pressure, which I think is the same as ΔH here. So ΔS = ΔH_vap / T.

Let me calculate that. ΔH is 43.9 kJ/mol, which is 43900 J/mol. Temperature is 373 K.

So ΔS = 43900 J/mol / 373 K. Let me do that division. Hmm, 43900 divided by 373. Let's see, 373 times 100 is 37,300. 373*117 is let me calculate: 373 * 100 = 37300, 373*17= 6341, so total 43641. Oh wait, that's close to 43900. So 373 * 117 = 43641. The difference is 43900 - 43641 = 259. So 259/373 is roughly 0.694. So total is approximately 117.694, which is about 117.7 J/(mol·K).

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 117. Hmm. Let me check the options again. Option H is 118 J/mol K. Oh yeah, that's very close to my calculation. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait a second. The molar heat of vaporization given is 43.9 kJ, but sometimes I might confuse whether it's in kJ or J. Oh no, the calculation was correct because I converted 43.9 kJ to 43900 J.

Wait another thing. The question says the molar heat is +43.9 kJ. So that's correct. And using 373 K is right because that's the boiling point in Kelvin. 

So the calculation was 43900 / 373 ≈ 117.7, which is approximately 118. So the correct answer should be option H.

I think that's it. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me redo the division. 373 into 43900.

373 * 100 = 37300. Subtract that from 43900, you get 6600. 373 * 17 is 6341. 6600 - 6341 is 259. So 100+17=117, and 259/373 is about 0.7. So 117.7, which rounds to 118. Yep, so H is correct.

To determine the entropy change (ΔS) for the vaporization of water, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{T}
\]

Here, the molar heat of vaporization (\(\Delta H_{\text{vap}}\)) is given as \(+43.9 \, \text{kJ/mol}\), which is converted to \(43900 \, \text{J/mol}\). The temperature (\(T\)) is the boiling point of water, which is \(373 \, \text{K}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{43900 \, \text{J/mol}}{373 \, \text{K}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta S \approx 117.7 \, \text{J mol}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1}
\]

This value is very close to \(118 \, \text{J mol}^{-1} \text{K}^{-1}\), which corresponds to option H. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: 118 J mol\(^{-1}\) K\(^{-1}\).
