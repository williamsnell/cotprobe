Okay, so I have this problem about Robert Rogers, the real estate salesman. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question is asking about Robert's gross earnings, standard deductions, and net earnings. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, so what do I know? Robert's commission is 3.5% of his sales. His sales last month were $256,225. So his gross earnings must be that 3.5% of 256,225. Let me calculate that.

Calculating 3.5% of 256,225. To find a percentage, I can multiply the total by the decimal form. 3.5% is 0.035. So 256,225 * 0.035. Let me do that math.

Hmm, 256,225 times 0.035. Let me see, 256,225 * 0.03 is 7,686.75, and 256,225 * 0.005 is 1,281.125. Adding those together: 7,686.75 + 1,281.125 equals 8,967.875. So that's approximately $8,967.88. Okay, so his gross earnings are $8,967.88. Looking at the options, that narrows it down a bit. Options A, C, E, I, J have this as the first number. So others like B, D, F, G, H have different first numbers so they can be considered incorrect for now.

Next part: standard deductions. He's married and claims three exemptions. I remember that standard deductions depend on filing status and the number of exemptions. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me think. For the 2023 tax year, the standard deduction for married filing jointly is... was it around $12,950? But wait, that's without considering exemptions. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Oh wait, the standard deduction might just be a flat amount based on filing status, not the number of exemptions. Or are exemptions part of itemized deductions?

Wait, I think the standard deduction is a fixed amount, and personal exemptions are additional. But wait, didn't the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) change this? Oh right, from 2018 to 2025, personal exemptions are suspended. So you can't claim personal exemptions anymore. But you can claim the standard deduction. So in this case, Robert is married and claims three exemptions, but wait, if he's using the standard deduction, the number of exemptions might not affect the standard deduction. Or maybe the question is using an older tax system where you could claim exemptions.

Wait, the question says "standard deductions." Hmm, maybe it's not the standard deduction but the total deductions, which would include exemptions. Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is a fixed amount plus exemptions.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me clarify. In the past, the standard deduction was based on filing status, and you could also deduct personal exemptions. But under TCJA, the standard deduction increased, and personal exemptions were eliminated. So if the question is set in a time where personal exemptions are allowed, then the total deduction would be the standard deduction plus exemptions. But if it's under TCJA, then only the standard deduction applies.

But the question doesn't specify the year. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. Oh wait, the question says "standard deductions," which I think refers to the standard deduction amount. So perhaps it's $6,350 for single and $12,700 for married filing jointly for 2023. Wait, no, in 2023, the standard deduction for married filing jointly is $27,700? No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me look up the standard deductions for recent years. For 2022, the standard deduction was $12,950 for married filing jointly. In 2023, it's $13,850. But wait, the question is probably using older numbers because the options are lower than that. Let's look at the options:

Looking at the options, the standard deductions are in the $2,000 range. So perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the standard deductions here refer to the total of standard deduction and exemptions. Because looking at the options, the standard deductions are around $2,586 or $2,075, etc. So maybe each exemption is worth a certain amount.

Wait, in older tax systems, each personal exemption was a certain deduction. For example, in 2017, each exemption was $4,050. But with the TCJA, exemptions were eliminated from 2018 onwards. So perhaps the question is using the pre-TCJA rules.

So let's assume that. So for a married person with three exemptions, the standard deduction would be the married standard deduction plus three times the exemption amount.

Wait, no, actually, the standard deduction is separate from exemptions. So the standard deduction is a fixed amount based on filing status. Then, you can also subtract personal exemptions, which are per person. So for 2017, for example, the standard deduction for married filing jointly was $12,700, and each exemption was $4,050. So if he's married and claims three exemptions, his total deductions would be $12,700 (standard) + 3 * $4,050 (exemptions).

Wait, but the options have a second number of around $2,586. Let me compute 3 * $4,050: that's $12,150. Adding that to $12,700 would make $24,850, which is way higher than the options given. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let's read it again.

The question says: What were Robert's gross earnings, standard deductions, and net earnings?

Wait, perhaps "standard deductions" here refers to the total amount deducted from gross income, which would include the standard deduction plus exemptions. Or perhaps it's just the standard deduction, and then the exemptions are treated differently.

Wait, perhaps the term "standard deductions" in the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the question is using an older system where the standard deduction is lower, and each exemption is a fixed amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is $6,300 for married filing jointly, and each exemption is $1,000. So three exemptions would be $3,000, making the total standard deductions $6,300 + $3,000 = $9,300. But the options have $2,586, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the standard deduction is calculated based on the number of exemptions. Wait, I don't think that's correct. The standard deduction is a fixed amount, and exemptions are separate, but under TCJA, exemptions are gone.

Wait, let's consider that perhaps the standard deduction here is $6,350 (which was the 2023 single standard deduction, but married is higher). Hmm, but the options have $2,586. Let's see, $2,586.84. That's about a quarter of $10,000. Maybe it's based on something else.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is not the federal one, but maybe state or something else. Or perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is being calculated as a percentage of gross income. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Standard deductions are fixed.

Wait, let's think about the numbers. The options for standard deductions are around $2,586. So let's calculate 4% of $8,967.88: 0.04 * 8967.88 = 358.71, which is not near. Alternatively, perhaps 28% of something? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the standard deduction is based on the number of dependents. Let's see, if each exemption is $500, for example, then three would be $1,500, but the standard deduction would be a base plus that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is calculated as follows: For a married couple, the standard deduction is $3,000, and each exemption is $500, so three exemptions would add $1,500, making the total standard deduction $4,500. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is calculated as $1,000 per person plus $500 per exemption. So for Robert, married, so two people, that's $2,000, plus three exemptions, $1,500, totaling $3,500. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me look at the options again. The second number in the options is either around $2,586 or other numbers like $2,075 or $3,000.

Wait, $2,586.84. Let me calculate 25% of $10,347.36, which would be $2,586.84. But why 25%? Alternatively, perhaps it's the result of some tax calculation.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is calculated as the sum of the standard deduction and the exemptions. Let's see. Suppose the standard deduction is $6,000, and each exemption is $862.84, so three would be $2,586.52. Adding to $6,000 would give $8,586.52, but that's not matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is $2,586.84, which would be the sum. So perhaps the standard deduction is $2,586.84, but that seems low for a married couple.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is $2,586.84, and that's it. So the second number is the standard deduction. So maybe the answer is option A or C, etc.

Wait, but let's think about the tax brackets. Robert's gross earnings are $8,967.88. So his taxable income would be gross minus standard deductions. Then, the net earnings would be gross minus taxes.

Wait, perhaps we should calculate the taxes. So first, calculate the taxable income: $8,967.88 minus standard deductions. Then, calculate the tax based on that.

But without knowing the tax brackets, it's hard. Alternatively, the question might assume a flat tax rate, but I don't think so. Or perhaps it's using a specific tax bracket.

Wait, perhaps the standard deductions are the sum of the standard deduction and exemptions. Let's say the standard deduction is $6,000, and each exemption is $862.84. So three exemptions would add $2,586.84, making the total deductions $8,586.84. But that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is $2,586.84, which is the second number. So if the standard deduction is that, then the taxable income is $8,967.88 minus $2,586.84, which equals $6,381.04.

Then, the tax would be calculated on $6,381.04. Assuming the tax rate, perhaps 15%, but let's see. 10% of 6,381 is $638.10, 12% is $765.73, 15% is $957.56. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the net earnings are gross minus (standard deduction plus tax). Wait, no, the net earnings would be gross minus taxes and deductions.

Wait, perhaps the net earnings are calculated by subtracting the standard deduction and then subtracting the taxes. But without knowing the tax rate, it's difficult. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a 20% tax bracket.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction is $2,586.84 and the tax is 15% on the taxable income. Let me try that.

So taxable income is $8,967.88 (gross) minus $2,586.84 (standard deduction) = $6,381.04. Then, 15% tax on that is 0.15 * 6,381.04 = $956.16. So net earnings would be $6,381.04 (taxable income) minus $956.16 (tax) = $5,424.88. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is 25%. 0.25 * 6,381.04 = $1,595.26. Net would be $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 - $1,595.26 = $4,785.78. Still doesn't match the options.

Wait, maybe I'm going about this wrong. Let me look at the options. Option C is:

C: $8967.88, $2586.84, $6381.04

So net earnings are $6,381.04. That's exactly the taxable income I calculated earlier. So does that mean that the tax is zero? That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the net earnings are calculated as gross minus standard deduction. So $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 = $6,381.04. So net earnings would be $6,381.04. So option C shows that. But that would mean that the tax is zero, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is treating the standard deduction as the only deduction, and not accounting for taxes, so net earnings are after deductions only. But that doesn't make much sense in real terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that Robert's earnings are below a certain threshold, so he doesn't owe any taxes. But for 2023, the standard deduction is $13,850 for married filing jointly. So if his income is $8,967, that's below the standard deduction, so he wouldn't owe taxes. Oh! That might be it.

Wait, if his taxable income is zero because his gross is below the standard deduction, then he doesn't pay taxes, and his net earnings are the same as his gross. But wait, in the options, the net earnings are less than the gross. So that can't be.

Wait, let's clarify. The standard deduction is $13,850 for married filing jointly. If Robert's gross is $8,967.88, then his taxable income would be $8,967.88 minus $13,850, which is negative. So he doesn't owe any taxes. So his net earnings would be the same as his gross, $8,967.88. But none of the options have the net as that. So perhaps the question is using a different standard deduction.

Wait, perhaps the standard deduction here is $2,586.84, which is the second number. So maybe the question is using a much lower standard deduction, perhaps state tax or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is based on his commission rate. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the standard deductions include both federal and state. But this is getting too complicated, and I'm probably overcomplicating it.

Let me try a different approach. Let me look at the options and see if any make sense.

Option A: $8,967.88, $2,586.84, $7,381.04

So the standard deduction is $2,586.84. Then, net earnings are $7,381.04. So subtracting standard deduction from gross: $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 = $6,381.04. Then, subtracting taxes to get to $7,381.04? That doesn't add up. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, maybe net earnings are calculated after subtracting both the standard deduction and the taxes. So, for example, gross minus (taxes + deductions). But without knowing the tax rate, I can't compute that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering only the standard deduction as the deduction, and then calculates the net earnings as gross minus standard deduction minus some tax. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deduction is a flat $2,586.84, and the tax is calculated on the gross minus that. Let's try that.

So taxable income is $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 = $6,381.04. Let's say the tax rate is 10%, so tax would be $638.10. So net earnings would be $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 (deduction) - $638.10 (tax) = $8,967.88 - $3,224.94 = $5,742.94. None of the options have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is 15%, so 0.15 * 6,381.04 = $956.16. Net would be $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 - $956.16 = $5,424.88. Again, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the tax is 25%, so 0.25 * 6,381.04 = $1,595.26. Net would be $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 - $1,595.26 = $4,785.78. Still not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider that the standard deduction might be $2,586.84, and the net earnings are $6,381.04, which is the taxable income. So perhaps the tax is zero, but that would mean he doesn't pay any taxes, which is possible if the taxable income is below a certain threshold.

Wait, for the 2023 tax year, the standard deduction is $13,850 for married filing jointly. So if Robert's taxable income after deductions is $6,381.04, that's below the standard deduction, so he doesn't owe taxes. So his net earnings would be his gross earnings minus any taxes. But if he doesn't owe taxes, then his net would be the same as his gross, $8,967.88. But in option C, the net is $6,381.04, which is the taxable income. That doesn't add up because net earnings should be after taxes.

Wait, perhaps the question is not accounting for federal income tax but only for other deductions, like state tax or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the standard deduction as the only deduction and not accounting for taxes at all, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering that Robert's only income is from commissions, and the standard deduction is $2,586.84, and then the net earnings are after the standard deduction but before taxes. But that doesn't seem right because net earnings usually refer to after taxes.

Wait, maybe the question is structured so that the standard deduction is the total allowed, and the net earnings are calculated as gross minus standard deduction. So $8,967.88 - $2,586.84 = $6,381.04, which is option C's net earnings. But that would mean that the taxes are zero, which as I said earlier, is possible if taxable income is below the standard deduction. But in that case, the net would be the same as the gross, not after subtracting the standard deduction.

I'm getting a bit stuck here.
