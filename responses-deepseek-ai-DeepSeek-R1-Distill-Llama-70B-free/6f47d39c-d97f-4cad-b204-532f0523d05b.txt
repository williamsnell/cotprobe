Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Dr. Delbert Dinwoody inviting the client's wife to couple therapy. The client is a 35-year-old diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence, and the wife is being invited with the client's permission. The question is about whether this action is acceptable or not, and under what conditions.

Hmm, I remember that in therapy, especially couple therapy, it's common to involve family members if it's beneficial for the client's treatment. But there must be some ethical considerations here. Let me think about the possible issues.

The options are from A to J. I need to pick the correct one. So, the question is about the acceptability of involving the wife in therapy. Let's go through each option.

Option A says it's acceptable as long as the client and wife aren't separated or getting divorced. I'm not sure if marital status is the main issue here. It might be acceptable regardless, as long as both agree.

Option B: The wife shouldn't be seeing another professional. I don't think that's a restriction. Clients can see multiple therapists if needed, but the main issue is whether it's beneficial, not whether she's seeing someone else.

Option C: Unacceptable because the wife is vulnerable to undue influence. Wait, why would that be? If the therapist is inviting her with the client's permission, it's more about supporting the client, not influencing her against her will. I'm not sure about this one.

Option D: Only if she also has Alcohol Dependence. That seems too restrictive. Couple therapy can be helpful even if she doesn't have the same diagnosis. It's about supporting the client's recovery, not just treating her.

Option E: Acceptable if the therapist believes it benefits the client. That sounds reasonable. Therapists often involve family members if it aids the patient's progress. So this might be the correct choice.

Option F: Unacceptable because she should seek her own help. That doesn't make sense. She can participate in couple therapy and seek her own help if needed. It's not either/or.

Option G: Unacceptable because of a conflict of interest. I'm not sure. The therapist's primary client is the individual, but in couple therapy, the focus shifts to the relationship. But with the client's permission, maybe it's okay.

Option H: Needs her written consent. Well, informed consent is important, but the question says the client gave permission. Maybe the wife's consent is also needed, but the option says written consent. I'm not certain if that's required here.

Option I: Unacceptable because it may bias the therapist. I don't see why involving the wife would create bias. The therapist should remain neutral, so this doesn't seem right.

Option J: Unacceptable because it infringes on individual therapy. But couple therapy can complement individual therapy without infringing. So this doesn't seem correct.

So, focusing on the main points. The key issue is whether inviting the wife is ethically acceptable. From what I remember, therapists can involve family members in treatment if it's beneficial, as long as confidentiality and consent are handled properly. So the main condition is that the therapist believes it will help the client, which is option E.

Wait, but what about Option H, written consent. The question says the client gave permission, but does the wife need to consent as well? I think so, but the question is about the acceptability of the action, not the legal requirements. So the primary issue is whether it's acceptable in the first place, which is yes, if the therapist thinks it's beneficial.

So the correct answer should be E: acceptable as long as he believes couple therapy will benefit the client's progress.

The question revolves around the ethical acceptability of Dr. Dinwoody inviting the client's wife to participate in couple therapy, given the client's diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence. The key consideration is whether this action is appropriate and under what conditions.

- **Option A** suggests acceptability depends on the couple's marital status, but this is not the primary ethical concern.  
- **Option B** implies the wife cannot be seeing another professional, which is unnecessary as clients can engage with multiple therapists if beneficial.  
- **Option C** claims it's unacceptable due to the wife being vulnerable to undue influence, but there's no indication of coercion; the invitation is to support the client's recovery.  
- **Option D** restricts participation to cases where the wife also has Alcohol Dependence, which is overly restrictive since couple therapy can benefit the client regardless of the wife's diagnosis.  
- **Option E** states it's acceptable if the therapist believes it will benefit the client, which aligns with ethical practices where involving family members is done in the client's best interest.  
- **Option F** argues the wife should seek her own help, but this doesn't preclude her participation in couple therapy.  
- **Option G** mentions a conflict of interest, but this is unlikely if the therapist maintains professional boundaries and focuses on the client's recovery.  
- **Option H** requires written consent, which, while important, is not the focus of the question.  
- **Option I** suggests it may bias the therapist, but a professional should remain neutral.  
- **Option J** claims it infringes on individual therapy, but couple therapy can complement it without interference.

The most appropriate answer is **Option E**, as it reflects the ethical practice of involving family members in therapy when it is believed to benefit the client's progress. 

Answer: E
