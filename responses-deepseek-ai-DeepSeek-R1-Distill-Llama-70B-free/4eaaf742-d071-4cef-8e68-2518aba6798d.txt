Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing, specifically looking for unrecorded liabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking what an auditor would most likely examine when searching for unrecorded liabilities. The options are A through I. I remember that unrecorded liabilities usually refer to obligations that the company has incurred but hasn't yet recorded in their books. Examples might include goods received but not invoiced, or services used but not billed yet.

So, thinking about each option:

Option A: Cash receipts recorded in books but not by the bank. Wait, that sounds more like a cash receipts issue, maybe related to larceny or something, but not directly about liabilities. Liabilities are about what the company owes, not what they're receiving.

Option B: Bank reconciliation statements for unrecorded transactions. Bank reconciliations help find discrepancies between the company's books and the bank's records. Unrecorded transactions here might relate to both assets and liabilities. But I'm not sure if this is the most direct way to find unrecorded liabilities.

Option C: Cutoff bank statements for deposits recorded in books but not by the bank. Cutoff procedures are about ensuring that transactions around the year-end are recorded in the correct period. If a deposit is in the books but not the bank, maybe it's a timing difference. Not sure if this is about liabilities.

Option D: Receiving reports for items received before year-end but not recorded. Oh, wait, if goods were received but not recorded, that could mean the company has an unrecorded liability because they have the goods but haven't processed the invoice. So the accounts payable would be understated. That sounds relevant.

Option E: Details of accounts receivable confirmations as exceptions. Accounts receivable exceptions might relate to unrecorded revenue or bad debts, but not directly to liabilities.

Option F: Sales invoices issued just after year-end. Those would relate to revenue after the cutoff date, possibly affecting receivables, but not liabilities.

Option G: Files of purchase requisitions for items ordered just before year-end. Purchase requisitions are requests to purchase, but until the items are received and invoiced, there's no liability. So maybe if items were ordered but not yet received, there's no liability. But if they were received but not invoiced, that's a liability. So maybe this isn't directly it, unless the requisition leads to an actual receipt.

Option H: Files of sales orders for items sold just before year-end. Sales orders would relate to revenue, not liabilities.

Option I: Details of accounts payable confirmations as exceptions. Accounts payable confirmations are when the auditor checks with suppliers to see if the recorded payables match. Exceptions here might indicate discrepancies, possibly unrecorded liabilities if the payable wasn't recorded.

Wait, so between options D, G, and I. D is about receiving goods before year-end but not recorded. That would mean the company has the asset (inventory) but hasn't recorded the liability (accounts payable). So the auditor would look at receiving reports to find this.

Option I is about accounts payable confirmations. If during confirmation, the supplier says the company owes more than what's recorded, that's an unrecorded liability. So both D and I could be relevant.

Hmm, but what's the primary method auditors use? I think that when looking for unrecorded liabilities, especially accruals, the auditor might examine the receiving reports. Because for goods received but not invoiced, the company should accrue the expense and liability. So the receiving report would show that the goods were received, but perhaps the invoice hasn't come in yet, and the company hasn't recorded it.

On the other hand, accounts payable confirmations (option I) would directly show if there are payables that the company hasn't recorded. So if the auditor gets a confirmation from the supplier and it doesn't match the company's records, that's an exception indicating an unrecorded liability.

Wait, the question is about 'most likely' examine. So which option is more directly about finding unrecorded liabilities.

Another angle: unrecorded liabilities could be in the form of accruals, like accrued expenses. These often relate to goods or services received but not yet billed. So the auditor would look for evidence of receiving goods without a corresponding vendor invoice. Receiving reports (D) would show items received, and if the auditor checks if those have been recorded as liabilities, that could uncover unrecorded ones.

Alternatively, during the audit, the auditor might send confirmation letters to suppliers (accounts payable confirmations). If the supplier's response doesn't match the company's records, that's an exception (I). So option I would be about finding discrepancies, indicating unrecorded liabilities.

Wait, but the options are about what the auditor would examine. So for D, the auditor would examine receiving reports to find items received but not invoiced, hence not recorded as a liability. For I, the auditor would look at the results of the confirmations (exceptions) to find unrecorded payables.

Which one is more directly linked to searching for unrecorded liabilities? I'm a bit torn. But I think that examining receiving reports (D) is a method used to find unrecorded liabilities because it's about the cutoff and accruals. Alternatively, purchase orders or requisitions (G) might not be enough because they haven't been received yet.

So, the correct answer is either D or I.

Wait, the question is phrased as "searching for unrecorded liabilities an auditor most likely would examine the..." So which option best fits that?

I think that when looking for unrecorded liabilities, the auditor would check for goods received but not yet billed. So the receiving reports would show items received near year-end. If the company hasn't recorded the invoice, then it's an unrecorded liability. Therefore, option D is about receiving reports for items received before year-end but not recorded.

Alternatively, option I is about accounts payable confirmations. If the confirmation comes back and shows an amount higher than what's recorded, that's an unrecorded liability. So in that case, the auditor would look at the details of the confirmations classified as exceptions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The main methods to detect unrecorded liabilities are:

1. Reviewing the cutoff procedures to ensure that transactions around year-end are properly recorded. For example, if goods were received before year-end but the invoice came after, the company should accrue the expense and liability.

2. Sending confirmation letters to suppliers (accounts payable) to verify the balances. If the supplier states a higher amount, that indicates an unrecorded liability.

3. Examining purchase commitments or orders placed but not yet received, but I'm not sure about that.

So between D and I. The question is, which is more directly related.

I think both D and I are relevant, but the question is about what the auditor would examine. The receiving reports (D) would help find goods received but not recorded as a liability, which is an unrecorded liability. The accounts payable confirmations (I) would find discrepancies between what the company has recorded and what the supplier says is owed, indicating an unrecorded liability.

So both D and I could be correct. But I'm not sure which is more likely the answer.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D: Receiving reports for items received before year end but not yet recorded.

So the auditor would compare receiving reports to the purchase invoices. If there are receiving reports without corresponding invoices in the accounts payable, that suggests an unrecorded liability.

Option I: Details of accounts payable confirmations that are classified as exceptions.

So when the auditor sends out confirmations, any exceptions (like discrepancies) would indicate unrecorded liabilities.

I think in an audit, both methods are used, but the question is which is more likely. The receiving reports (D) are more about the company's internal records and cutoff, while the confirmations (I) are about external verification.

Hmm... I'm a bit stuck, but I think the answer might be D. Because when looking for unrecorded liabilities, especially accruals, the auditor would check if there are goods received but not yet invoiced. So examining receiving reports would help identify that.

Alternatively, the accounts payable confirmations (I) directly relate to finding unrecorded payables, so that might be a more direct method.

I'm going to pick option D as the answer, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it could be I. Wait, another thought: unrecorded liabilities might also include items that the company hasn't recorded because they didn't receive an invoice yet, but the goods were received. So the auditor would look at the receiving reports to find such cases.

Alternatively, the accounts payable confirmation would catch cases where the company forgot to record an invoice they received. So both are possible.

Wait, the question is about the most likely. I think that examining receiving reports (D) is a standard procedure to detect unrecorded liabilities. So I'll go with D.

In searching for unrecorded liabilities, an auditor is primarily looking for obligations that the company has incurred but has not yet recorded in its books. Examples include goods or services received but not invoiced, or expenses incurred but not recorded. The options provided can be analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Cash receipts recorded in the books but not by the bank relate to cash discrepancies, not liabilities.
- **Option B**: Bank reconciliation statements help identify discrepancies between the company's books and the bank's records but are not directly focused on unrecorded liabilities.
- **Option C**: Cutoff bank statements for deposits recorded in the books but not by the bank relate to timing differences in cash transactions, not liabilities.
- **Option D**: Receiving reports for items received before year-end but not yet recorded are directly relevant because they can reveal goods received but not invoiced, indicating an unrecorded liability.
- **Option E**: Accounts receivable confirmations classified as exceptions relate to revenue or receivables, not liabilities.
- **Option F**: Sales invoices issued just after the year-end relate to revenue recognition, not liabilities.
- **Option G**: Purchase requisitions for items ordered but not received do not represent liabilities since the goods or services have not been received.
- **Option H**: Sales orders for items sold just before year-end relate to revenue, not liabilities.
- **Option I**: Accounts payable confirmations classified as exceptions can reveal discrepancies between the company's records and supplier records, indicating unrecorded liabilities.

Both **Option D** and **Option I** are relevant to identifying unrecorded liabilities. However, **Option D** is more directly focused on internal records and cutoff procedures, which are standard methods for detecting unrecorded liabilities related to goods received but not invoiced. Therefore, examining receiving reports (D) is the most likely approach an auditor would take.

Answer: D
