Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychology, specifically regarding adult development. The question is about discontinuous changes. Hmm, I remember that in psychology, development can be viewed in two main ways: continuous and discontinuous. Continuous development is like gradual changes, like getting a little taller each year. Discontinuous changes are more about stages or steps where there's a significant shift at certain points.

The question asks for an example of a discontinuous change in adults. The options are A through J. I need to think about each option and decide which one fits best.

Option A: Personality. I think personality is usually seen as pretty continuous. Like, you might become more set in your ways as you age, but it's a gradual process, right? So maybe not discontinuous.

Option B: Skin elasticity. That's something that decreases over time, probably gradually as we age. So continuous change.

Option C: Physical strength. This likely peaks in early adulthood and then declines. But the decline is usually a steady process, so continuous.

Option D: Male hormone levels. Testosterone levels do decrease as men age, but I think it's a gradual process. So again, continuous.

Option E: Hair color. Ah, hair color changes, like going gray. That's something that happens over time, but is it a sudden change? Maybe it starts to appear gray in certain areas and progresses. I'm not sure if it's discontinuous or just a steady change.

Option F: Working memory. This tends to decline with age, but again, it's a gradual process. So continuous.

Option G: Female hormone levels. This one might be different. Women go through menopause, which is a significant and relatively sudden change in hormone levels, particularly estrogen. Menopause is a stage, so the drop in hormones is a discontinuous change because it happens during a specific phase, not just a steady decline over years.

Option H: Male sexuality. I think sexual function may decline gradually, so continuous. Though there might be individual variations, overall, it's a steady change.

Option I: Vision acuity. This usually declines with age, starting maybe in the 40s with presbyopia. It's a gradual process, so continuous.

Option J: Sleep patterns. These do change as people age, like older adults might sleep less or have different sleep cycles. But I believe these changes happen gradually over time, so continuous.

So putting it all together, the question is about discontinuous changes. Discontinuous implies a stage or abrupt shift. Menopause in women is a stage where hormone levels drop significantly, making option G a discontinuous change.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Male hormone levels (option D) might decrease more gradually, like starting around 40 with a slow decline. Female hormones, especially estrogen, drop sharply during menopause. So G is the discontinuous example.

The question asks for an example of a discontinuous change in adults, which refers to significant shifts occurring at specific stages rather than gradual changes. Discontinuous changes are abrupt or step-like, unlike continuous changes that happen steadily over time.

- **A: Personality** and **B: Skin elasticity** are continuous changes, as they develop gradually.
- **C: Physical strength**, **D: Male hormone levels**, **F: Working memory**, **H: Male sexuality**, **I: Vision acuity**, and **J: Sleep patterns** also involve gradual changes over time.
- **E: Hair color** changes over time but is typically a steady process.
- **G: Female hormone levels** stand out because women experience menopause, a specific stage where hormone levels, particularly estrogen, drop sharply. This is a clear example of a discontinuous change.

Thus, the best answer is **G: Female hormone levels**.
