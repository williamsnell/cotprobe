Okay, so I've got this question about brain scans and which one would disprove the statement that "most people only use 10 percent of their brains." Hmm, I remember hearing that this 10% thing is a myth. I think the idea is that people believe only a small portion of the brain is active, but in reality, most of it is used, maybe just not all at once.

The question is asking which type of brain scan would be best to show this. So I need to think about what each of these scanning techniques does. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A is CAT, which I think stands for CT scan. CT scans use X-rays to create images of the brain structure. They're good for seeing injuries or abnormalities like tumors or bleeding. But I don't think they show brain activity, more the physical structure.

Option B is X-ray. X-rays are even more basic; they can show bones and some tissues but not detailed brain structures. Definitely not about activity.

Option C is EEG, electroencephalogram. EEG measures electrical activity in the brain. It's used for things like diagnosing epilepsy. It can show which areas are active when someone is doing tasks. But I'm not sure how detailed it is. It measures surface activity, so maybe it doesn't show the full picture of all brain regions being active.

Option D is PET scan, positron emission tomography. PET scans use a radioactive tracer to show brain activity by measuring blood flow. When parts of the brain are active, they use more glucose, so PET can show areas of high activity. This could be useful because if the brain is mostly active, PET would show that most areas have some activity, not just 10%.

Option E is MRI, magnetic resonance imaging. MRI gives detailed structural images of the brain. It can show different tissues and structures but doesn't typically show real-time activity unless it's a functional MRI (fMRI). So regular MRI might not be the best for this purpose.

Option F is SPECT, single photon emission computed tomography. Similar to PET, it uses radioactive tracers to image blood flow in the brain. It's another way to look at activity levels in different brain regions. So SPECT could also be useful, but I'm not sure how it compares to PET or fMRI.

Option G is MRA, magnetic resonance angiography. That's for looking at blood vessels and their structure, not brain activity. So probably not relevant here.

Option H is ultrasound. I don't think ultrasound is used much for detailed brain imaging in adults because the skull gets in the way. It's more for things like babies' brains or peripheral vessels, so not useful for this.

Option I is DTI, diffusion tensor imaging. DTI is a type of MRI that looks at the white matter tracts and how they connect. It's more about brain structure and connectivity rather than activity.

Option J is fMRI, functional MRI. This measures changes in blood flow to map brain activity. It shows which areas are active during different tasks. So if someone is using more than 10% of their brain, fMRI would show lots of areas lighting up when they perform various functions.

The question is about disproving the 10% myth. So the scan needs to show that most of the brain is active. PET and fMRI both show activity. Which one is more suited for this? I think fMRI is more detailed and commonly used for mapping brain activity in real-time during tasks. It can show that many areas are active even when a person is performing tasks that might seem simple, indicating that more than 10% is used.

Also, I remember that PET scans are good but maybe less precise in showing such widespread activity compared to fMRI. Plus, fMRI doesn't require radioactive tracers, which might make it more practical for such studies.

So the best option would be J, fMRI.

To determine which brain scan would be most useful in disproving the statement "Most people only use 10 percent of their brains," it is important to evaluate the capabilities of each imaging technique:

- **A: CAT (CT scan)**: Provides structural images but does not show brain activity.  
- **B: X-ray**: Limited to basic imaging of bones and some tissues, not brain activity.  
- **C: EEG**: Measures electrical activity but only on the brain's surface, lacking detailed regional activity.  
- **D: PET scan**: Measures blood flow and activity using a radioactive tracer, showing active brain regions.  
- **E: MRI**: Offers detailed structural images but does not typically show real-time activity unless it's functional MRI (fMRI).  
- **F: SPECT**: Similar to PET, it uses radioactive tracers to image blood flow but may be less precise than fMRI.  
- **G: MRA**: Focuses on blood vessel structure, not brain activity.  
- **H: Ultrasound**: Not suitable for detailed brain imaging in adults.  
- **I: DTI**: Examines white matter tracts and connectivity, not activity.  
- **J: fMRI**: Measures blood flow changes to map brain activity in real-time, providing detailed evidence of widespread brain usage.

Given the need to demonstrate that most of the brain is active, **fMRI** is the most suitable choice. It provides detailed, real-time mapping of brain activity, showing that multiple regions are engaged even during simple tasks, effectively disproving the 10% myth.
