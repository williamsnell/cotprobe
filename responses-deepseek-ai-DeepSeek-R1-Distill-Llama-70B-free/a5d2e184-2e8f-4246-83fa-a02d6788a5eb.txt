Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the partial-fraction expansion of F(s) = (s² + 3s + 1) / [(s + 1)^3 (s + 2)^2]. Hmm, partial fractions can be a bit tricky, but I think I remember the general approach.

Alright, let me start by recalling that when you have repeated linear factors in the denominator, you need to decompose each into multiple terms. For each (s + a) raised to the power n, you'll have terms from (s + a) to (s + a)^n. So here, the denominator is (s+1)^3 and (s+2)^2. That means the partial fraction decomposition should look something like:

F(s) = A/(s+1) + B/(s+1)^2 + C/(s+1)^3 + D/(s+2) + E/(s+2)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the denominator is (s+1)^3 and (s+2)^2. So for (s+1)^3, I'll have three terms: A/(s+1), B/(s+1)^2, C/(s+1)^3. And for (s+2)^2, two terms: D/(s+2) and E/(s+2)^2. So the setup is correct.

So I can write F(s) as:

(s² +3s +1) / [(s+1)^3 (s+2)^2] = A/(s+1) + B/(s+1)^2 + C/(s+1)^3 + D/(s+2) + E/(s+2)^2.

Now, to find A, B, C, D, E, I need to combine these fractions and equate the numerator to the given s² +3s +1.

Let me combine the right-hand side into a single fraction. The common denominator is (s+1)^3 (s+2)^2.

So, multiply each term by the common denominator:

A*(s+1)^2 (s+2)^2 + B*(s+1)(s+2)^2 + C*(s+2)^2 + D*(s+1)^3 (s+2) + E*(s+1)^3 = s² +3s +1.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but I can expand each term and collect like terms to equate coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to substitute specific values of s to get equations for the coefficients. But because the factors are higher than one, I might need to use derivatives for multiple roots. Let's think.

Wait, for (s+1)^3, when s approaches -1, the terms with (s+1) will vanish. So maybe plugging s = -1 and s = -2 would help, but since these are multiple roots, I might need to take derivatives as well.

Alternatively, expand all the terms and compare coefficients. Let me attempt that.

First, expand each term on the left:

A*(s+1)^2 (s+2)^2 = A*(s² + 2s +1)(s² +4s +4) = A*(s^4 + 6s^3 + 13s^2 + 12s +4).

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me try expanding each term step by step.

Wait no, perhaps a better approach is to write each term as a polynomial in s and then collect the coefficients.

Let me compute each term:

1. A*(s+1)^2 (s+2)^2:

Let me expand (s+1)^2 = s² + 2s +1; (s+2)^2 = s² +4s +4.

Multiply them together:

(s² + 2s +1)(s² +4s +4) = s^4 + 4s^3 +4s^2 + 2s^3 +8s^2 +8s + s^2 +4s +4.

Combine like terms:

s^4 + (4+2)s^3 + (4+8+1)s^2 + (8+4)s +4 = s^4 +6s^3 +13s^2 +12s +4.

Multiply by A: A s^4 +6A s^3 +13A s^2 +12A s +4A.

2. B*(s+1)(s+2)^2:

Expand (s+1) = s+1; (s+2)^2 = s² +4s +4.

Multiply them: (s)(s²+4s+4) +1*(s²+4s+4) = s^3 +4s^2 +4s + s² +4s +4 = s^3 +5s^2 +8s +4.

Multiply by B: B s^3 +5B s^2 +8B s +4B.

3. C*(s+2)^2:

(s+2)^2 = s² +4s +4. So multiplied by C: C s^2 +4C s +4C.

4. D*(s+1)^3 (s+2):

(s+1)^3 = s^3 +3s^2 +3s +1; (s+2) = s+2.

Multiply them: (s^3)(s+2) +3s^2(s+2) +3s(s+2) +1*(s+2) =

s^4 +2s^3 +3s^3 +6s^2 +3s^2 +6s +s +2.

Combine: s^4 + (2+3)s^3 + (6+3)s^2 + (6+1)s +2 → s^4 +5s^3 +9s^2 +7s +2.

Multiply by D: D s^4 +5D s^3 +9D s^2 +7D s +2D.

5. E*(s+1)^3:

(s+1)^3 = s^3 +3s^2 +3s +1. Multiply by E: E s^3 +3E s^2 +3E s +E.

Now, add all these terms together:

Term 1:
A s^4 +6A s^3 +13A s^2 +12A s +4A.

Term 2:
+ B s^3 +5B s^2 +8B s +4B.

Term3:
+ C s^2 +4C s +4C.

Term4:
+ D s^4 +5D s^3 +9D s^2 +7D s +2D.

Term5:
+ E s^3 +3E s^2 +3E s +E.

Now, combine all like terms:

s^4 terms: (A + D) s^4.

s^3 terms: (6A + B +5D + E) s^3.

s^2 terms: (13A +5B + C +9D +3E) s^2.

s terms: (12A +8B +4C +7D +3E) s.

constant terms: 4A +4B +4C +2D +E.

This entire sum equals the numerator on the left side, which is s^2 +3s +1.

So, the resulting polynomial must be equal to s² +3s +1. Therefore, the coefficients for each power of s must match on both sides.

So, we can set up the following equations:

For s^4: A + D = 0.        (1)

For s^3: 6A + B +5D + E = 0.  (2)

For s^2:13A +5B + C +9D +3E = 1.  (3)

For s: 12A +8B +4C +7D +3E =3.  (4)

For the constant term:4A +4B +4C +2D +E =1.  (5)

Now, we have a system of 5 equations with 5 unknowns (A, B, C, D, E). Let's solve them step by step.

Equation (1): A + D =0 → D = -A.

Let me substitute D = -A into the other equations.

Equation (2): 6A + B +5*(-A) + E =0 →6A + B -5A + E =0 → A + B + E=0. (2a)

Equation (3):13A +5B + C +9*(-A) +3E =1 →13A +5B +C -9A +3E =1 → (4A) +5B + C +3E=1. (3a)

Equation (4):12A +8B +4C +7*(-A) +3E =3 →12A +8B +4C -7A +3E =3 →5A +8B +4C +3E=3. (4a)

Equation (5):4A +4B +4C +2*(-A) +E=1 →4A +4B +4C -2A +E =1 →2A +4B +4C +E=1. (5a)

Now, our equations are:

(1) D = -A.

(2a) A + B + E =0.

(3a) 4A +5B + C +3E =1.

(4a)5A +8B +4C +3E =3.

(5a)2A +4B +4C +E =1.

Let me try to express E from (2a): E = -A - B.

Substitute E into the other equations.

Substitute E into (3a):

4A +5B + C +3*(-A - B)=1 →4A +5B + C -3A -3B =1 → (A) + (2B) + C =1. (3b)

Similarly, substitute E into (4a):

5A +8B +4C +3*(-A - B)=3 →5A +8B +4C -3A -3B=3 →2A +5B +4C=3. (4b)

Substitute E into (5a):

2A +4B +4C + (-A -B) =1 → (2A -A) + (4B -B) +4C =1 →A +3B +4C =1. (5b)

Now, let's rewrite the equations after substitution:

Equation (3b): A + 2B + C = 1.

Equation (4b): 2A +5B +4C =3.

Equation (5b): A +3B +4C =1.

Hmm, let's see. Now I have three equations (3b,4b,5b) with variables A, B, C.

Let me list them:

(3b): A +2B + C =1.

(4b): 2A +5B +4C =3.

(5b): A +3B +4C =1.

I can try to solve these equations. Let me subtract (5b) from (4b):

(4b - 5b): (2A -A) + (5B -3B) + (4C -4C) =3 -1 →A +2B =2. (6)

So equation (6): A + 2B =2.

Wait, equation (3b) is A +2B + C =1. So from equation (6), A+2B=2. Substitute into (3b):

(2) + C =1 → C= -1.

So C= -1.

Now, knowing that C=-1, we can substitute into (3b): A +2B -1 =1 → A +2B =2. Which is consistent with equation (6). So no new info there.

Now, let's use equation (5b): A +3B +4*(-1)=1 → A +3B -4=1 →A +3B=5. (7)

Equation (6): A +2B=2.

Subtract equation (6) from equation (7):

(A +3B) - (A +2B) )=5-2 → B=3.

So B=3.

Substitute B=3 into equation (6): A +2*3=2 → A +6=2 → A= -4.

So A= -4.

Now, from equation (2a), E= -A - B → E= -(-4) -3=4 -3=1.

So E=1.

Now, from equation (1), D= -A → D=4.

So D=4.

So the coefficients are:

A= -4,

B=3,

C= -1,

D=4,

E=1.

Wait, let me check if these values satisfy all equations.

Let me substitute back into equation (5a):

2A +4B +4C +E =1 → 2*(-4) +4*3 +4*(-1) +1 =-8 +12 -4 +1= (12-8)=4; (4-4)=0; 0 +1=1. So 1=1, correct.

Equation (4a):5A +8B +4C +3E=3 →5*(-4)= -20; 8*3=24; 4*(-1)=-4; 3*1=3. Sum: (-20 +24)=4; 4 -4=0; 0+3=3. So 3=3, correct.

Equation (3a):4A +5B +C +3E =1 →4*(-4)=-16; 5*3=15; C=-1; 3*1=3. Sum: -16+15= -1; -1 -1= -2; -2 +3=1. Correct.

Equation (2a):A +B + E= -4 +3 +1=0. Correct.

Equation (1): D=4= -A → -(-4)=4. Correct.

So all equations are satisfied.

So now, the partial fraction expansion is:

F(s) = A/(s+1) + B/(s+1)^2 + C/(s+1)^3 + D/(s+2) + E/(s+2)^2.

Plugging in the values:

A= -4 → term: (-4)/(s+1).

B=3 → 3/(s+1)^2.

C= -1 → (-1)/(s+1)^3.

D=4 →4/(s+2).

E=1 →1/(s+2)^2.

So putting it all together:

F(s) = (-4)/(s+1) + 3/(s+1)^2 -1/(s+1)^3 +4/(s+2) +1/(s+2)^2.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check which option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (-1)/(s+1)^3 +3/(s+1)^2 -4/(s+1) -1/(s+2)^2 +4/(s+2).

Hmm, our C is -1, so term is -1/(s+1)^3. That's correct. B is 3/(s+1)^2, correct.

A is -4/(s+1), which is -4/(s+1), so that's correct. D is 4/(s+2), correct. E is 1/(s+2)^2, so term is +1/(s+2)^2.

So our expansion is:

-1/(s+1)^3 +3/(s+1)^2 -4/(s+1) +4/(s+2) +1/(s+2)^2.

Looking at the options:

Option D reads:

[(- 1) / (s + 1)^3] + [3 / (s + 1)^2] - [4 / (s + 1)] + [1 / (s + 2)^2] + [4 / (s + 2)]

Which is exactly what I have. So option D matches.

Alternatively, let me double-check the other options.

Option E seems to have the same except for the (s+2) terms, but let me check:

Option E: [1/(s+1)^3] +3/(s+1)^2 -4/(s+1) +1/(s+2)^2 +4/(s+2). No, the (s+1)^3 term is positive 1, which doesn't match.

Option J: has -4/(s+2), which doesn't match.

Option D: matches exactly.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To find the partial-fraction expansion of \( F(s) = \frac{s^2 + 3s + 1}{(s + 1)^3 (s + 2)^2} \), we start by expressing it in the form:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s+1} + \frac{B}{(s+1)^2} + \frac{C}{(s+1)^3} + \frac{D}{s+2} + \frac{E}{(s+2)^2}.
\]

Multiplying through by the common denominator \((s+1)^3 (s+2)^2\) and equating coefficients of like powers of \(s\), we derive the following system of equations:

1. \( A + D = 0 \),
2. \( 6A + B + 5D + E = 0 \),
3. \( 13A + 5B + C + 9D + 3E = 1 \),
4. \( 12A + 8B + 4C + 7D + 3E = 3 \),
5. \( 4A + 4B + 4C + 2D + E = 1 \).

Solving this system:

- From \( A + D = 0 \), we find \( D = -A \).
- Substituting \( D = -A \) into the other equations and solving, we find:
  - \( A = -4 \),
  - \( B = 3 \),
  - \( C = -1 \),
  - \( D = 4 \),
  - \( E = 1 \).

Substituting these values into the partial-fraction expansion, we get:

\[
F(s) = \frac{-4}{s+1} + \
