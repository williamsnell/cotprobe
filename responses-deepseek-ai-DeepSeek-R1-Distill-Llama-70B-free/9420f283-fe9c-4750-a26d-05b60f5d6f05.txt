Okay, so I've got this problem to convert two logical expressions into reverse Polish notation, also known as postfix notation. Hmm, I remember that reverse Polish notation is where the operator comes after the operands. So for example, instead of writing A + B, you write AB+. 

The problem has two parts, (a) and (b), and I need to convert each into RPN. Then I have to look at the options provided and pick the correct one. Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): (Z ↓ ((((X) ⊙ Y) / (X ⊙ (Z))) > ((Y) ≡ X)))

Wait, let me parse that. The structure is a bit complex. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the entire expression is Z ↓ (something). The something is a comparison: (((X⊙Y)/(X⊙Z)) > (Y≡X)). So the structure is Z ↓ (condition), which I think is a logical implication or something.

Wait, the operator ↓ might be the logical NAND or something else. But regardless, the main focus is the structure. So the main operator is ↓, which takes two arguments: Z and the result of the comparison.

So, the comparison is (A > B), where A is ((X⊙Y)/(X⊙Z)), and B is (Y≡X). 

Let me handle A first. A is (X⊙Y) divided by (X⊙Z). Wait, in RPN, each operator follows its operands. So for X⊙Y, it would be X Y ⊙. Then, X⊙Z is X Z ⊙. Then, dividing these two would be (X Y ⊙) (X Z ⊙) /.

But wait, in the original expression, it's ((X⊙Y) / (X⊙Z)), so that's (A) divided by (B), which would be A B /.

So putting it together, X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ /.

Then, B is (Y ≡ X), which is Y X ≡.

So the comparison is A > B, which translates to (A B >). So putting it together, (X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ /) (Y X ≡) >. 

Now, the entire expression is Z ↓ (A > B). So the RPN would be Z followed by the comparison part, then ↓. 

Wait, wait. No, because the operator ↓ takes Z and the result of the comparison as operands. So in RPN, it's Z [comparison] ↓. 

Wait no, RPN is processed left to right, so the operands come first. So for Z ↓ (condition), the condition is a subexpression. So the structure is (condition) Z ↓? Or Z (condition) ↓?

Wait, no. Let's think about operator precedence. The entire expression is Z ↓ (condition), so Z is the left operand, and the condition is the right operand. So in RPN, we process Z first, then the condition, then apply ↓. So RPN order would be Z [condition] ↓.

So putting it all together, the RPN for part (a) would be:

Z, then the comparison part, which is (X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ >), then ↓. So:

ZX Y⊙ XZ⊙ / YX≡> ↓

Wait, let me write each step clearly.

First, the condition is ((X⊙Y)/(X⊙Z)) > (Y≡X). 

Breaking down the condition:

1. X⊙Y → X Y ⊙
2. X⊙Z → X Z ⊙
3. Divide them: step1 and step2 → (X Y ⊙) (X Z ⊙) / 
4. Y≡X → Y X ≡
5. Compare step3 and step4: (result of step3) (result of step4) > 

So the condition in RPN is X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ >.

Then, the entire expression is Z ↓ (condition), so Z followed by the condition, then ↓.

So the RPN for part (a) is Z X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓.

Wait, but wait: the condition is (A > B), which in RPN is A B >. So correct.

Now, part (a) would be: Z followed by A followed by B, then >, then ↓. So the RPN is Z [A] [B] > ↓?

Wait no, because the structure is Z ↓ (A > B). So the order is Z, then the result of (A > B), then ↓.

Wait, but in RPN, each operator follows its operands. So the way to write Z ↓ (condition) is to write Z, condition, ↓.

But the condition itself is (A > B), which is A B >.

So the RPN for the entire part (a) would be: Z X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me write it step by step.

The main structure is Z ↓ ( ... ). The ... is (A > B).

So the RPN would process Z first, then evaluate the (A > B), then apply ↓. So:

Z [A] [B] > ↓.

But wait, the way RPN works is that each operator acts on the immediately preceding operands. So in Z ↓ (A > B), the operator ↓ has two operands: Z and (A > B). So in RPN, Z comes first, then A > B (as a subexpression), then ↓.

So the RPN is Z (X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ >) ↓.

Which when written without parentheses becomes Z X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓.

Wait, but that's a bit ambiguous without parentheses. So the RPN for part (a) is ZX Y⊙ XZ⊙ / YX≡> ↓, as I thought.

Now moving on to part (b): (X / Y) / ((X / X) / (Y / Y))

This looks like a division of two expressions. Let me parse this.

The main structure is (A) / (B), where A is (X/Y), and B is ((X/X)/(Y/Y)).

So, A is X/Y → X Y /.

B is (X/X) / (Y/Y). Let's break that down:

X/X → X X /.

Y/Y → Y Y /.

Then, (X/X) / (Y/Y) → (X X /) (Y Y /) /.

So, B is X X / Y Y / /.

So the entire expression is (X Y /) / (B), which is (X Y /) (X X / Y Y / /) /.

So in RPN, it's X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

Wait, let me write it step by step.

1. X / Y → X Y /.

2. X / X → X X /.

3. Y / Y → Y Y /.

4. (X/X) / (Y/Y) → (X X /) (Y Y /) / → so the RPN is X X / Y Y / /.

5. Then, the entire expression is (X/Y) / (that) → (X Y /) (X X / Y Y / /) / → so RPN is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

So putting it all together, part (b) RPN is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

Now, let me look at the options provided. The options are labeled A through J, each with two parts separated by a comma. The first part is the RPN for (a), and the second for (b).

Looking at the options, let's compare each to what I have.

For part (a), my RPN is Z X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ZXY ⊙ XZ ⊙ / Y ≡ X > ↓ ... 

Wait, in my RPN, after Z, it's X Y ⊙, then X Z ⊙, then /, and so on. Option A starts with Z X Y ⊙, which is correct, but then X Z ⊙ /, which matches. Then Y ≡ X and >.

Wait, in my RPN, it's Y X ≡, because the operator ≡ is Y followed by X, which is Y X ≡. Option A has Y ≡ X, which would be Y X in RPN, which is correct. Then >, then ↓.

So for part (a), option A's RPN is ZXY ⊙ XZ ⊙ / Y ≡ X > ↓.

Wait, but in my RPN, it's Z followed by X Y ⊙, which is in order, so the option correctly writes Z X Y ⊙.

But looking at the options, some have different arrangements. Let me check each option's part (a):

Option A: ZXY \odot XZ \odot / Y \equiv X > \downarrow

So in RPN, that's Z X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓. That's exactly what I have for part (a). 

For part (b), option A's second part is YX / XX / YY / / /.

Wait, in my RPN for (b), I have X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

Option A's part (b) is Y X / X X / Y Y / / /, which is YX/ XX/ YY/ / /.

Wait, but in my RPN, it's X Y / first, then X X /, then Y Y /, then two /.

Option A's part (b) is YX / XX / YY / / /. That would be (Y/X) divided by ((X/X)/(Y/Y)), which is different from the original expression.

Wait, the original expression is (X/Y)/(((X/X)/(Y/Y))). So the RPN should start with X Y /, not Y X /.

So that means option A's part (b) is incorrect because it starts with Y X / instead of X Y /.

Hmm, so let's look at the other options.

Option B: (a) ZXY⊙ XZ⊙ / YX≡> ↓, (b) XY / XX / YY / / /

Wait, part (a) of option B is Z X Y ⊙ X Z ⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓. Which is the same as mine for part (a). But part (b) is XY / XX / YY / / /, which is (X/Y) / (X/X) / (Y/Y) / /, which doesn't match. Because the original part (b) is (X/Y) / ((X/X)/(Y/Y)), which in RPN is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /, as I had.

Option B's part (b) is XY/XX/YY///, which would be (X/Y) / (X/X) / (Y/Y) / /, which is incorrect because the denominator is (X/X / Y/Y), which is ((X/X) / (Y/Y)).

Wait, let me clarify. The original part (b) is (X/Y) / [ (X/X) / (Y/Y) ]. So in RPN, it's X Y / [ X X / Y Y / ] /.

Which is written as X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

So looking for an option where part (b) is XY/XX/YY////, but let's see:

Option E's part (b): XX / XY / YY / / /

Wait, no, let's check each option's part (b):

Option A: YX / XX / YY / / / → incorrect, starts with YX/ instead of XY/.

Option B: XY / XX / YY / / / → incorrect, because it's (X/Y) / (X/X) / (Y/Y) / / → which would be (((X/Y)/(X/X))/(Y/Y)), which is not the original expression.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The original is (A) / (B), where A is X/Y, and B is (C)/(D), where C is X/X, D is Y/Y.

So the RPN would be A B / → (A is X Y / ), (B is C D / → C is X X /, D is Y Y /, so B is X X / Y Y / / ). So the overall is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

Looking at the options:

Which option's part (b) is XY/XX/YY//// ?

Looking through the options:

Option E: part (b) is XX / XY / YY / / /

No, that's not it.

Option F: part (b) is XY / YY / XX / / /

No.

Option G: part (b) is XY / XX / YY / / /

Yes, option G's part (b) is XY / XX / YY / / /.

Wait, no, let me check each option:

Option A: part (b) is YX / XX / YY / / / → No.

Option B: part (b) is XY / XX / YY / / / → Yes, that's correct. Wait, no. Because if part (b) is (X/Y) / ((X/X)/(Y/Y)), then the RPN is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /, which is option B's part (b) as XY/XX/YY//// → No, because option B's part (b) is XY / XX / YY / / /, which is four /, but wait, the way it's written is "XY / XX / YY / / /", which would be XY/ followed by XX/, YY/, then two more /.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with how the options are written.

Wait, the option for part (b) is written as "XY / XX / YY / / /", which translates to:

(X Y / ) (X X / ) (Y Y / ) / / /.

Wait, no, because in RPN, each operator acts on the previous two operands. So let's parse it step by step.

Option B's part (b) is XY / XX / YY / / /.

So, the first part is X Y / → A.

Then, X X / → B.

Then, Y Y / → C.

Then, we have /, which would take B and C → (B/C).

Then, another /, which would take A and (B/C) → A/(B/C).

Wait, that's correct because the original expression is A / (B/C), which is A * (B/C)^-1, but in RPN, it's A B/C / → which is written as A B C / / /.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

The expression is (X/Y) divided by ((X/X)/(Y/Y)).

Which is (X/Y) / [ (X/X) / (Y/Y) ].

In RPN, the denominator is computed first as (X/X) (Y/Y) / → let's call this D.

Then the entire expression is (X/Y) D /.

So RPN is X Y / X X / Y Y / / / → because you compute X Y /, then X X /, then Y Y /, then divide the last two to get D, then divide X Y / by D.

So the correct RPN for part (b) is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

Looking back at the options:

Which option's part (b) is XY/XX/YY//// ?

Looking at each option's part (b):

Option A: YX / XX / YY / / / → No, starts with YX/ which is wrong.

Option B: XY / XX / YY / / / → Yes, this matches what I need.

So option B's part (b) is correct.

But earlier, I thought option B's part (a) was correct.

Wait, let's check option B's part (a):

Option B's part (a) is ZXY⊙ XZ⊙ / YX≡> ↓ → So in RPN, it's Z X Y⊙ X Z⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓.

Which matches my earlier calculation for part (a).

So for part (a), option B's RPN is correct, and for part (b), option B's RPN is correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that option A had part (a) correct, but part (b) wrong, and option B has part (a) correct and part (b) correct.

Wait, but in my initial analysis of option A, part (a) was correct, and part (b) wrong. Option B's part (a) is correct, part (b) also correct.

Wait, but looking again, option B's part (a) is written as Z X Y⊙ X Z⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓.

Which is same as what I have for (a): Z X Y⊙ X Z⊙ / Y X ≡ > ↓.

So both parts (a) and (b) in option B seem correct.

Wait, but let me double-check part (b). Because I might have made a mistake earlier.

The original part (b) is (X/Y) / [ (X/X) / (Y/Y) ].

In RPN:

Compute X/Y → X Y /.

Compute X/X → X X /.

Compute Y/Y → Y Y /.

Compute (X/X) / (Y/Y) → (X X /) (Y Y /) / → so that's X X / Y Y / /.

Then, compute (X/Y) divided by that result → (X Y /) (X X / Y Y / /) / → which is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

So the RPN is X Y / X X / Y Y / / /.

Which matches option B's part (b): XY / XX / YY / / /.

So option B has both parts correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought option A's part (a) was correct, but part (b) wrong.

Wait, let me check option B again.

Option B:

(a) ZXY⊙ XZ⊙ / YX≡> ↓

(b) XY / XX / YY / / /

Which matches what I have.

So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, looking back, the options provided might have different structures.

Wait, another thing to check: the operator precedence and the order of operands.

In part (a), the condition is ((X⊙Y)/(X⊙Z)) > (Y≡X).

In RPN, the left
