Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about the reaction between lithium oxide (Li2O) and water (H2O) producing lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The question asks what mass of Li2O is needed to completely react with 24 liters of H2O. The options provided are from A to J, each with different masses in kilograms.

Hmm, first, I think I need to write down the balanced chemical equation. The reaction given is Li2O + H2O → 2 LiOH. Let me check if it's balanced. On the left, there are 2 Li atoms, 2 O from Li2O, and H2O has H2 and O. On the right, each LiOH has Li, O, and H, so 2 LiOH gives 2 Li, 2 O, and 2 H2O? Wait, wait, let me count again.

In Li2O, there's Li2 and O. H2O is H2O. On the product side, 2 LiOH means 2 Li, 2 O, and 2 H (since each LiOH has one H). Wait, maybe I should write each side properly.

Left side: Li2O has 2 Li and 1 O. H2O has 2 H and 1 O. So total Li: 2, O: 2 (1 from Li2O, 1 from H2O), H: 2.

Right side: 2 LiOH has 2 Li, 2 O, and 2 H. So yeah, each molecule has Li, O, and H. So the equation is balanced as written. Okay, so the equation is 1 Li2O + 1 H2O → 2 LiOH.

Now, the next step is to figure out how much Li2O is needed for 24 liters of H2O. Wait, but water's volume is given in liters, and the problem gives the density of water as 1.0 g/cm³. So I can find the mass of water from its volume.

Wait, 24 liters... but wait, 1 liter is 1000 cm³, right? So 24 liters would be 24,000 cm³. Since density is mass/volume, mass = density × volume. So mass of H2O is 1.0 g/cm³ × 24,000 cm³ = 24,000 grams, which is 24 kg. Oh, that's a lot.

Now, the next part is to find moles of H2O. The molecular weight of H2O is given as 18 g/mol. So moles = mass / molecular weight. So that's 24,000 g / 18 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 24,000 divided by 18 is... let me see. 18 times 1,333 is roughly 24,000 (since 18 * 1,333.33 is 24,000). So approximately 1,333.33 moles of H2O.

Now, looking at the balanced equation, the mole ratio between Li2O and H2O is 1:1. Because one mole of Li2O reacts with one mole of H2O to make two moles of LiOH. So the number of moles of Li2O needed is the same as the moles of H2O, which is 1,333.33 moles.

Now, the molecular weight of Li2O is given as 30 g/mol. So the mass needed is moles × molecular weight. So 1,333.33 moles × 30 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1,333.33 * 30. Hmm, 1,333 * 30 is 39,990 grams. Which is 39.99 kg, approximately 40 kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 40 kg. So I think the answer is F.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

First, volume of H2O is 24 liters. So 24 * 1000 cm³ = 24,000 cm³. Density 1 g/cm³, so mass is 24,000 grams, which is 24 kg. Moles of H2O: 24,000 g / 18 g/mol = 1,333.333... moles. Since the ratio is 1:1, moles of Li2O needed is the same, 1,333.333. Multiply by molecular weight of Li2O, 30 g/mol: 1,333.333 * 30 = 40,000 grams, which is 40 kg. Yes, that matches option F.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the problem, the reaction is written as Li2O + H2O → 2LiOH. So the ratio is indeed 1:1, so no problem there.

So yeah, the correct answer should be 40 kg, which is option F.

To determine the mass of lithium oxide (Li₂O) required to completely react with 24 liters of water (H₂O), we start by analyzing the given reaction:

\[
\text{Li}_2\text{O} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow 2\text{LiOH}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the mass of water (H₂O)
The density of water is given as \(1.0 \, \text{g/cm}^3\), and the volume of water is \(24 \, \text{liters}\). Since \(1 \, \text{liter} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3\), the volume in \(\text{cm}^3\) is:

\[
24 \, \text{liters} \times 1000 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{liter} = 24,000 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Using the formula for density (\(\text{mass} = \text{density} \times \text{volume}\)):

\[
\text{Mass of H}_2\text{O} = 1.0 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 24,000 \, \text{cm}^3 = 24,000 \, \text{g} = 24 \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the moles of water (H₂O)
The molecular weight of water is \(18 \, \text{g/mol}\). The number of moles of water is:

\[
\text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = \frac{\text{Mass of H}_2\text{O}}{\text{Molecular weight of H}_2\text{O}} = \frac{24,000 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} = 1,333.33 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Use the mole ratio to find moles of Li₂O
From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of Li₂O to H₂O is \(1:1\). Therefore, the moles of Li₂O required are:

\[
\text{Moles of Li}_2\text{O} = \text{Moles of H}_2\text{O} = 1,333.33 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mass of Li₂O
The molecular weight of Li₂O is \(30 \, \text{g/mol}\). The mass of Li₂O is:

\[
\text{Mass of Li}_2\text{O} = \text{Moles of Li}_2\text{O} \times \text{Molecular weight of Li}_2\text{O} = 1,333.33 \, \text{mol} \times 30 \, \text{g/mol} = 40,000 \, \text{g} = 40 \, \text{kg}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mass of Li₂O required to completely react with 24 liters of H₂O is **40 kg**, which corresponds to option **F**.
