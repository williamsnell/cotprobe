The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The state registrar of elections refused to put a candidate's name on the ballot because the registrar believed that the candidate was not a resident of the state. The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives "be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. " As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?

Options:

A: The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.
B: The federal court cannot intervene because it would disrupt the separation of powers.
C: Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.
D: The candidate lacks standing to sue because she was never officially a member of the House of Representatives.
E: The case should have been filed in the state court where the original residency determination was made.
F: The federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House of Representatives has exclusive authority to determine the qualifications of its members.
G: The case is moot because the term of office for which the candidate was elected has already ended.
H: There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.
I: The candidate's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
J: The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law and federal court jurisdiction. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

The scenario is about a candidate for the House of Representatives who faced a challenge regarding her residency. The state registrar refused to put her name on the ballot because they thought she wasn't a resident. She sued in state court, won, got on the ballot, and then won the election. But when she was supposed to be seated, the House of Representatives investigated and, by a two-thirds vote, decided she wasn't a resident and refused to seat her. Now she's suing in federal court for back pay and to be seated. The defendants are claiming the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and we need to pick the strongest constitutional argument supporting that.

The options are A through J, each presenting a different legal argument. I need to figure out which one is the best.

First, I remember that the Constitution gives each house of Congress the power to determine the qualifications of its members. Article I, Section 5 says each house shall be the judge of the qualifications of its own members. So, once the House has made a decision, can a federal court overturn that?

I also recall the concept of justiciability, which includes things like political questions. Some issues are considered political and are left to the other branches of government, not the judiciary. The Supreme Court has held that certain matters, especially those involving internal congressional rules or qualifications, are political questions that courts won't decide.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House has exclusive authority to determine qualifications. That seems related to the political question doctrine. But wait, is that entirely accurate? I think the House does have that authority, but does that mean the federal courts can't review it at all? Or is it more about whether it's a political question?

Option J is about the case presenting a nonjusticiable political question. That rings a bell. The classic case is Powell v. McCormack, where the Supreme Court held that while the House's decision to exclude a member can't be overturned on qualitative judgments about a member's fitness, but can be reviewed for certain constitutional requirements. Hmm, but that case allowed some judicial review. So maybe it's not a complete bar.

Wait, in this question, the House excluded her based on residency, which is a constitutional qualification. Article I, Section 2 sets the qualifications for the House (age, citizenship, inhabitant of the state). So the House is determining whether she meets those. The Supreme Court in Powell said that the Constitution gives the House the power to judge qualifications, but the Court can still determine whether the House applied the correct constitutional standards. So perhaps the Court can review whether the House's decision was based on constitutional grounds.

But in this case, the candidate is suing for back pay and to be seated. The defendants are claiming lack of jurisdiction. So the strongest argument would be that this is a political question, which courts can't decide because it's up to the House. But wait, the Court did decide in Powell that some aspects are reviewable. So maybe the issue here is that the plaintiff lacks standing or it's a political question.

Alternatively, the argument could be that the federal courts can't interfere because the House has exclusive jurisdiction over seating its members. But I think that's more about the political question doctrine, which is option J.

Option F says the House has exclusive authority, so the court lacks jurisdiction. But I've read that the courts have jurisdiction but may decline to exercise it on political question grounds. So the lack of jurisdiction (subject matter) isn't because the House has exclusive authority, but because it's a political question, making it nonjusticiable. Therefore, option J would be the stronger argument.

Other options:

Option D: She lacks standing because she's not a member. But she was elected, so she might have standing to challenge her exclusion.

Option B: Separation of powers. That's related, but the question is about subject matter jurisdiction, so it's more about the court's authority to hear the case.

Option C: Advisory opinions. Not applicable here because she's seeking specific relief.

Option G: The case is moot. The term hasn't ended, so it's not moot.

Option I: Eleventh Amendment bars the suit because it's against state officials. Wait, the defendants are the Speaker and House officers, who are federal officials, not state. So Eleventh Amendment wouldn't apply here.

So the remaining strong options are F and J. But Powell v. McCormack suggests that while the Court can review some aspects, others are nonjusticiable. Here, the House's decision is based on a constitutional qualification, so perhaps it's a political question, making option J the answer.

But another angle: If the House's decision was based on a constitutional requirement (residency), maybe the court can review it. In that case, F would be the argument, but if the court can't review it because it's a political question, then J applies.

Wait, in the question, the state courts already ruled she was a resident, but the House still refused to seat her. So she's challenging that decision. The defendants argue the court lacks jurisdiction. The strongest argument is that it's a political question, so option J.

Alternatively, the Constitution's text in Article I, Section 5 might give the House exclusive authority, making it a matter for the House, not the courts. But the Supreme Court has sometimes intervened, so perhaps J is better.

I'm a bit confused between F and J. Let me think again.

Option F: The court lacks jurisdiction because the House has exclusive authority. But jurisdiction is about the power to hear the case, while a political question is about whether the court should exercise that jurisdiction. So the strongest argument would be that it's a political question, making it nonjusticiable, so the court lacks jurisdiction.

Wait, no. If a case is a political question, the court doesn't decide it because it's not justiciable, which goes to the court's jurisdiction. So the strongest argument would be J, that it's a nonjusticiable political question.

Therefore, the answer should be J.

The question revolves around whether a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear a case where the House of Representatives refused to seat a candidate based on a residency determination. The strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer hinges on the concept of nonjusticiable political questions. Under Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, each house of Congress is granted the authority to determine the qualifications of its members. This power is broadly interpreted to include decisions about seating members, particularly when those decisions involve constitutional qualifications such as residency.

The Supreme Court has established that certain matters, especially those involving internal congressional decisions, are political questions that courts should not resolve. While the Court has intervened in cases where constitutional rights are at stake, the present scenario involves a qualitative judgment about residency, which is a constitutional qualification. This makes the issue a political question, as the House's decision is better left to the legislative branch under the separation of powers doctrine.

Other options, such as lack of standing (D) or mootness (G), do not apply here. The candidate has standing as she was elected and seeks specific relief, and the case is not moot since the term of office has not expired. The Eleventh Amendment (I) is irrelevant because the defendants are federal officials, not state actors. While the House's exclusive authority (F) is a related concept, the stronger argument is that the case presents a nonjusticiable political question (J), making it inappropriate for judicial review.

Thus, the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer is that the case presents a nonjusticiable political question.

**Answer: J**
