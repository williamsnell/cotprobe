Okay, so I have this problem here about Mary O'Grady's gross earnings for the week. Let's see, I need to calculate her total pay based on the hours she worked and the different pay rates for different days. Hmm, where do I start?

Alright, let me read the problem again carefully. Mary worked 44 hours during a regular Monday-Friday week. Then she worked 4 and a half hours on Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday. The payment structure is such that any hours over 40 during the regular week are paid at time and a half. All Saturday work is also paid at time and a half, and Sunday work is double time. Her regular rate is $3.10 per hour.

So, the key here is to break down her hours into regular pay, overtime, Saturday pay, and Sunday pay. Let me jot down the steps.

First, regular pay: she worked 44 hours during the week. The regular hours are up to 40, so she has 40 hours at the regular rate. The remaining 4 hours are overtime, which is time and a half.

Wait, wait. So 44 hours in the week: 40 regular hours, 4 overtime hours.

Overtime pay is 1.5 times the regular rate. So for those 4 hours, she gets 4 * (3.10 * 1.5).

Then, Saturday: she worked 4.5 hours. All Saturday hours are paid at time and a half. So that's 4.5 * (3.10 * 1.5).

Sunday: 3 hours, which is double time. So 3 * (3.10 * 2).

Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, regular pay: 40 hours * $3.10. That's easy. 40 * 3.10 = 124.00.

Next, the overtime during the week: 4 hours. Time and a half is 3.10 * 1.5. Let me calculate that. 3.10 * 1.5 is 4.65. So 4 * 4.65 = 18.60.

Saturday pay: 4.5 hours at time and a half. So same as before, 3.10 * 1.5 is 4.65. 4.5 * 4.65. Hmm, let's see. 4 * 4.65 is 18.60, and 0.5 * 4.65 is 2.325. Adding them together gives 20.925.

Sunday pay: 3 hours at double time. So 3.10 * 2 = 6.20. 3 * 6.20 = 18.60.

Now, adding all these amounts together: regular + overtime + Saturday + Sunday.

Regular: 124.00
Overtime: 18.60 → totals 142.60
Saturday: 20.925 → totals 163.525
Sunday: 18.60 → totals 182.125.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the math.

Regular is 40 * 3.10: 40 *3 is 120, 40 *0.10 is 4. So 124. Correct.

Overtime: 4 * (3.10 * 1.5) = 4 * 4.65 → 18.60. Correct.

Saturday: 4.5 * 4.65. Let me compute 4.5 *4 =18 and 4.5 *0.65=2.925 → 18+2.925=20.925.

Sunday: 3 *6.20=18.60.

Adding: 124 +18.6 =142.6. Then +20.925 → 163.525. Then +18.6 → 182.125.

Hmm, but looking at the options, D is $182.13. So that's probably the correct answer. But wait, perhaps I made a calculation error somewhere.

Let me recalculate the Saturday pay. 4.5 hours at 4.65 per hour.

4.5 *4 is 18. 0.5 *4.65 is 2.325. So 18 + 2.325 =20.325? Wait wait, wait. No, 4.65 multiplied by 0.5 is 2.325. Oh wait, wait, 4.5 is 4 +0.5. So 4 *4.65 is 18.60, and 0.5 *4.65 is 2.325, so 18.60 +2.325 =20.925. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but when I add up all the parts:

Regular: 124.00

Overtime: 18.60 → 124+18.6 =142.6

Saturday: 20.925 → 142.6 +20.925 =163.525

Sunday:18.60 → 163.525 +18.6=182.125.

So the total is $182.125, which would round to $182.13. So the correct option is D.

But wait, let me check if I accounted for all hours correctly. So the regular week is 44 hours, with 4 overtime. Saturday 4.5, Sunday 3. So total hours: 44 +4.5 +3 =51.5 hours. That seems right.

Another way to approach is calculating each part:

Regular pay: 40 *3.10=124

Overtime:4 * (3.10 *1.5)=4*4.65=18.6

Saturday:4.5*(3.10 *1.5)=4.5 *4.65=20.925

Sunday:3*(3.10 *2)=3*6.20=18.6

Adding all: 124 +18.6 → 142.6; +20.925 →163.525; +18.6 →182.125.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D: $182.13.

Mary O'Grady's gross earnings for the week are calculated based on her regular pay, overtime pay, Saturday pay, and Sunday pay. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Regular Pay**:  
   - 40 hours at the regular rate of $3.10/hour:  
     \( 40 \times 3.10 = 124.00 \).

2. **Overtime Pay**:  
   - 4 hours over 40 during the regular week, paid at time and a half:  
     \( 3.10 \times 1.5 = 4.65 \), so \( 4 \times 4.65 = 18.60 \).

3. **Saturday Pay**:  
   - 4.5 hours at time and a half:  
     \( 3.10 \times 1.5 = 4.65 \), so \( 4.5 \times 4.65 = 20.925 \).

4. **Sunday Pay**:  
   - 3 hours at double time:  
     \( 3.10 \times 2 = 6.20 \), so \( 3 \times 6.20 = 18.60 \).

Adding all components:  
\( 124.00 + 18.60 + 20.925 + 18.60 = 182.125 \).  

Rounding to two decimal places, the total gross earnings are **$182.13**.  

The correct answer is **D: $182.13**.
