Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!
What's this that you have done?
Is 't not a very naughty thing
To snatch the kaiser's crown?
Now you will have to stay away
Alike from Rhine and Prague,
And more than that-shame and dismay
Your days and nights will plague.
Right well you knew, and all the world,
Right well they know this thing,
That Ferdinand alone can be
Bohemia's lawful king.
So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go
To Ferdinand, your king,
And beg him graciously to show
Full pardon for your sin.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. The question is about a song from the seventeenth century called "Poor Winter King." The lyrics seem to be addressing someone named Winter King, criticizing him for taking the Kaiser's crown and suggesting he should beg pardon from Ferdinand, who is the lawful king of Bohemia.

First, I need to understand the historical context here. The Winter King is a nickname I've heard before. I think it refers to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. He was a Protestant prince who got involved in the Thirty Years' War. In 1619, he was offered the crown of Bohemia by Protestant nobles because they were opposing the Catholic Habsburg ruler, Ferdinand II. Frederick accepted, but his reign was short-lived, hence the name "Winter King" because his rule lasted only through the winter.

So, the song is likely from that period, around the early 17th century. The lyrics mention Ferdinand as the lawful king, which aligns with Ferdinand II, the Holy Roman Emperor and a staunch Catholic. The song is telling the Winter King to go back to Ferdinand and ask for pardon, implying that Ferdinand is the rightful ruler.

Now, the question is about the narrator's religious identity. The options are various religions: Roman Catholic, Muslim, Agnostic, Hindu, Atheist, Eastern Orthodox, Buddhist, Sikh, Protestant, Jewish.

Since Ferdinand II was a Catholic and the song is supporting his authority over Bohemia, the narrator is probably on Ferdinand's side. That suggests the narrator is Catholic. But wait, I should think again. The song is written in a way that's critical of the Winter King, who was Protestant. So the narrator is supporting Ferdinand, the Catholic king, against the Protestant Frederick.

But wait, could it be the other way around? If the song is from the Protestant perspective, they might be mocking the Winter King, but that doesn't make much sense because the Winter King was a Protestant leader. So it's more likely that the song is from a Catholic viewpoint, supporting Ferdinand and condemning Frederick's actions.

Alternatively, maybe the song is from the perspective of the people, but given the support for Ferdinand, it's more likely a Catholic perspective.

So looking at the options, option A is Roman Catholic. That seems to fit.

Wait, but another angle: the Winter King was a Protestant, so if the narrator is against him, maybe the narrator is Catholic. Alternatively, could the song be a Protestant song critical of their own leader? That seems less likely because the Winter King was a hero for many Protestants, even if his reign was short.

No, I think the song is written from the perspective of those loyal to Ferdinand, so the narrator is Roman Catholic.

The song "Poor Winter King" refers to Frederick V, the Protestant Elector Palatine, who was known as the Winter King for his brief rule in Bohemia. The lyrics criticize him for opposing Ferdinand II, a Catholic Habsburg ruler, and urge him to seek pardon from Ferdinand, recognizing Ferdinand as the lawful king. This indicates the narrator supports Ferdinand, who was a Catholic. Therefore, the narrator most likely identifies as Roman Catholic.

Answer: A
