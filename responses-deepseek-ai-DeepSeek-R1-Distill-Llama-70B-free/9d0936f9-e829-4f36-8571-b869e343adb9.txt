Question:

A city ordinance forbids washing vehicles parked on city streets. A man washes his car while it is parked on the street in front of his home. The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?

Options:

A: The man had already planned to dry the water before it froze, but was unable to because of an unexpected emergency.
B: The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.
C: The city had been warned about the icy conditions but had not salted the streets.
D: The driver is not a resident of the city.
E: The man had been washing his car on the street for years without any previous incidents.
F: The driver had previously been involved in multiple accidents due to reckless driving.
G: The man had placed a warning sign near the puddle to alert drivers of the potential hazard.
H: The man was not aware of the ordinance.
I: The driver was driving at an excessively high speed at the time of the accident.
J: The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.

Okay, so I've got this question about negligence per se, and I'm trying to figure out which additional fact would help the man the most. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that there's a city ordinance forbidding washing vehicles on city streets. The man washed his car on the street, and the water puddle froze, causing a car to crash. The driver is suing, claiming negligence per se.

Negligence per se is when a law is violated, and that violation is considered negligent in itself. So, the driver is arguing that the man's violation of the ordinance automatically makes him negligent. But the man wants to defend against that claim.

The question is asking which additional fact would help the man the most. So I need to think about what defenses are available against a negligence per se claim.

One defense I remember is that the plaintiff must be within the class of people the statute was meant to protect, and the harm must be the type the statute was trying to prevent. If the man can show that the ordinance wasn't intended to prevent this kind of harm, or that the driver isn't in the protected class, then maybe the negligence per se claim fails.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one.

Option A: The man planned to dry the water but couldn't due to an emergency. That might relate to due care, but since he violated the ordinance, it might not help much with negligence per se. It could be more about ordinary negligence, but the question is about per se.

Option B: The driver saw the man washing the car. Not sure how that helps. Maybe notice, but I don't see the connection to the defense against per se.

Option C: The city didn't salt the streets despite warnings. This points to the city's negligence, but does it help the man? Maybe in a way that the city's action contributed, but I'm not sure if that negates the man's per se liability. It could be about apportioning blame but not directly defeating the per se claim.

Option D: The driver isn't a city resident. Hmm, would that matter? The ordinance is for city streets, so maybe the driver isn't in the class the ordinance was meant to protect. Wait, but the ordinance is about washing cars on streets, which could affect anyone using the streets, residents or not. So perhaps D isn't the best.

Option E: The man had done this for years without issues. That might show it's not inherently dangerous, but the ordinance exists for a reason. So maybe it's relevant, but not the strongest defense against per se.

Option F: The driver has a history of reckless driving. This could show contributory negligence or assumption of risk, which might reduce liability but not necessarily negate the per se claim.

Option G: The man placed a warning sign. That shows he took some precaution, which could help in a regular negligence claim, but not sure if it affects per se. Because per se is about the violation itself, not the precautions taken after.

Option H: The man wasn't aware of the ordinance. Ignorance of the law is generally not a defense, so this probably doesn't help.

Option I: The driver was speeding. If the driver was going too fast, that could be contributory negligence. But again, does that defeat per se? I'm not sure. It might reduce damages but not eliminate liability.

Option J: The ordinance was enacted after someone was hit by a truck while washing their car. Wait, that's interesting. So the ordinance was created because of an incident where washing led to someone being hit by a truck. But in this case, the harm was from ice causing a crash. So the man can argue that the ordinance was intended to prevent a different kind of harm than what happened here.

So, in negligence per se, the harm must be the type the statute was designed to prevent. If the ordinance was made to prevent people from being hit by passing trucks while washing cars, then the ice causing a crash is a different kind of harm. Therefore, the man might argue that the statute's purpose wasn't to prevent this particular type of accident, so negligence per se doesn't apply.

So option J seems like the best choice because it goes to the heart of whether the harm is within the scope of the ordinance's intended protection.

To determine which additional fact would help the man the most in defending against a claim of negligence per se, it is important to focus on the elements of negligence per se. Negligence per se applies when a statute is violated, and the violation directly causes a harm that the statute was intended to prevent, to a class of people the statute was designed to protect. A valid defense would involve showing that the harm in question is not the type the statute was meant to address or that the plaintiff is not within the protected class.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The man's inability to dry the water due to an emergency might relate to ordinary negligence but does not directly challenge the applicability of negligence per se.
- **Option B**: The driver witnessing the man washing his car is irrelevant to whether the ordinance applies or the harm it was intended to prevent.
- **Option C**: The city's failure to salt the streets could point to contributory negligence by the city but does not negate the man's potential liability under negligence per se.
- **Option D**: The driver not being a city resident is unlikely to matter, as the ordinance applies to anyone using the streets, regardless of residency.
- **Option E**: The man's history of washing his car without incidents might suggest the ordinance is unnecessary, but it does not directly challenge the applicability of negligence per se.
- **Option F**: The driver's history of reckless driving could demonstrate contributory negligence but does not affect the per se claim.
- **Option G**: The man placing a warning sign shows precaution but does not negate the violation of the ordinance.
- **Option H**: Ignorance of the law is generally not a valid defense and would not help the man.
- **Option I**: The driver speeding could reduce liability through contributory negligence but does not eliminate the per se claim.
- **Option J**: If the ordinance was enacted to prevent a different harm (e.g., someone being hit by a truck while washing their car) than the one that occurred (a car crashing due to ice), this directly challenges the applicability of negligence per se. It highlights that the harm in question is not the type the statute was intended to prevent, making this the strongest defense.

Thus, the fact that the ordinance was enacted after an incident involving a truck collision, not ice-related harm, would most effectively help the man defend against the negligence per se claim.
