Question:

The kangaroo rat never drinks water, yet it survives in some of the hottest and driest regions of the world. Explain how it obtains and conserves water.

Options:

A: The kangaroo rat has a symbiotic relationship with a plant that provides it with water
B: The kangaroo rat consumes small pebbles that help it extract moisture from the food it eats
C: The kangaroo rat relies on a slow metabolism to minimize water loss
D: The kangaroo rat extracts water from the insects it eats
E: The kangaroo rat obtains all of its water from carbohydrate metabolism and its kidneys are modified to conserve as much water as possible.
F: The kangaroo rat drinks dew drops from plants
G: The kangaroo rat collects water in its fur during the night and licks it off
H: The kangaroo rat burrows deep underground to access moisture in the soil
I: The kangaroo rat has a special organ to absorb water from the air
J: The kangaroo rat stores water in its tail

Okay, so I need to figure out how the kangaroo rat gets and keeps water since it never drinks it. Hmm, I remember that desert animals have various adaptations to survive without much water.

First, I think about what the kangaroo rat eats. I recall they mainly eat seeds, which are pretty dry. So, if they don't drink water, they must get it from their food or metabolism. Oh wait, metabolism! When animals break down food, especially carbohydrates, they produce water as a byproduct. That's called metabolic water, I think.

But wait, how does that work exactly? Carbohydrates have a certain amount of oxygen, and when they're metabolized, the oxygen combines with hydrogen to form water. So, the kangaroo rat would get some water from this process. But is that enough?

Also, their kidneys must be efficient. I remember that many desert animals have highly concentrated urine to minimize water loss. So, the kidneys probably play a role in conserving water by reabsorbing as much as possible.

Looking at the options, option E says the kangaroo rat gets all its water from carbohydrate metabolism and has modified kidneys to conserve water. That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: Symbiotic relationship with a plant? I don't think so. They probably don't get water directly from plants like that.

Option B: Consumes pebbles to extract moisture. I don't recall that. Pebbles might help with digestion, like grinding food in the stomach, but not directly extracting water.

Option C: Slow metabolism. Maybe that reduces water loss through respiration, but I think the main thing is metabolic water and kidney efficiency.

Option D: Extracts water from insects. No, kangaroo rats eat seeds, not primarily insects.

Option F: Drinks dew drops. I don't think they do that. They don't drink water at all.

Option G: Collects water in fur and licks it. I haven't heard of that for kangaroo rats.

Option H: Burrows for moisture. Well, they do burrow, but I think that's more for shelter and escape from heat rather than accessing water.

Option I: Special organ to absorb air moisture. Some animals have that, like the Namib Desert beetle, but I don't think kangaroo rats do.

Option J: Stores water in tail. I'm pretty sure that's the camel's hump, not the kangaroo rat's tail.

So putting it all together, the kangaroo rat relies on metabolic water from their food's carbohydrates and has efficient kidneys to retain water. So the correct answer should be E.

The kangaroo rat survives in arid environments without drinking water by relying on metabolic processes and efficient water conservation mechanisms. It obtains water through the metabolism of carbohydrates, a process that produces water as a byproduct. Additionally, its kidneys are specialized to reabsorb as much water as possible, minimizing loss through excretion. This combination of metabolic water production and renal efficiency allows the kangaroo rat to thrive in dry conditions. 

Other options, such as drinking dew, storing water in its tail, or relying on symbiotic relationships, are not supported by the kangaroo rat's known adaptations. Thus, the correct explanation is that the kangaroo rat obtains all its water from carbohydrate metabolism and conserves it with modified kidneys.
