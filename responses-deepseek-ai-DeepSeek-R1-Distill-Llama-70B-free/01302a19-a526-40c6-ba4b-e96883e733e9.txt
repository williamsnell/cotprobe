Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about reactions that include energy as a reactant. Hmm, I remember that in biochemistry, energy is often involved in reactions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms.

Let me think. The question is asking what type of reaction includes energy as one of its reactants. The options are A to J, each with different terms like endergonic, catabolic, etc. I think I need to recall what each of these terms means.

Wait, so reactions can be exergonic or endergonic. Exergonic reactions release energy, right? And endergonic reactions absorb energy. Oh wait, but do they include energy as a reactant or a product? Because if a reaction is endergonic, it requires energy input. So energy is a reactant.

So the question is, which term describes a reaction that has energy as a reactant. So endergonic reactions. Because endergonic means energy is put into the system, so the reaction consumes energy. So those reactions require energy to proceed.

Looking back at the options, option A is endergonic reaction. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me just make sure. Catabolic reactions break down molecules, usually releasing energy. So those are exergonic. Anabolic reactions build up, which require energy, so they are endergonic. But the question is about including energy as a reactant. So anabolic would be that. But the question is about the term for the reaction, not whether it's anabolic or catabolic.

Wait, so the question isn't about the type being anabolic or catabolic, but the kind of reaction. So endergonic reactions are the ones that require energy, so energy is a reactant. So the correct term is endergonic.

So the answer should be A: endergonic reaction.

The question asks for the type of reaction that includes energy as one of its reactants. To determine this, it's important to understand the terms provided:

- **Endergonic reactions** require energy input to proceed, meaning energy acts as a reactant.
- **Exergonic reactions** release energy, so energy is a product, not a reactant.
- **Anabolic reactions** are a type of endergonic reaction, as they build complex molecules and require energy.
- Other terms like catabolic, redox, or hydrolysis reactions describe different aspects of reactions but do not specifically indicate energy as a reactant.

Since the question focuses on reactions where energy is a reactant, the correct term is **endergonic reaction**.

Answer: A
