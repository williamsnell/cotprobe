Okay, so I have this question here about coupons and their types. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which coupon is included in a package for later purchase. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that coupons come in various forms. There's in-store, mail-in, digital, etc. But the key here is that it's included in a package. So like, when you buy something, sometimes there's a coupon inside for next time.

Wait, I think there's a specific term for that. I've heard of something called a "bounce-back" coupon. Bounce-back... that rings a bell. It's when after you make a purchase, they give you a coupon that you can use next time you come back. So it's like encouraging you to return, hence "bounce back" to the store.

Let me go through the options to make sure. Option G is bounce-back coupon. That sounds right. But wait, are there other possibilities? Let me think about the other options.

Option J is a free-standing coupon. I think those are the ones that are separate, like in newspapers or flyers. Not inside the package. So probably not J.

Option H is peel-off coupon. Those are the stickers you peel off a product, maybe on the shelf, right? So they're on the product, but I'm not sure if that's the same as included in the package.

Option B is a rebate coupon, which I think is more about getting money back after purchase, not a discount for next time.

Option F, promotional coupon, is a bit vague. It could be any type used to promote, so not specific enough.

Option G still seems the most likely. Because it's about getting a coupon with your purchase to use on a future visit. So when you open the package, there's this coupon that you can use next time. That's the bounce-back.

I think the answer is G.

The correct answer is G: a bounce-back coupon. This type of coupon is provided with a purchase and intended to encourage a future visit or purchase.
