Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a divided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers."
Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961

Options:

A: A continent that needs French intervention to maintain peace
B: Important due to the Sahara's natural resources
C: An example of successful political union
D: A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War
E: An obstacle to French atomic tests in the Sahara
F: A strong political union
G: A threat to French power and influence
H: A continent too divided to be of significance
I: A collection of republics tottering into anarchy

Okay, so I've got this question about a speech by Kwame Nkrumah, and I need to figure out what the French saw Africa as, based on his words. Let me start by reading the question again and the provided text carefully.

The question is asking, "Based on the speech, the French saw Africa as which of the following?" with options from A to I.

Looking at the speech, Nkrumah talks about the importance of African unity to contribute to world peace and to gain respect from the world. He mentions that a united Africa would project the African personality more effectively and command respect because the world only respects size and influence.

Then he gives examples: the scant attention paid to African opposition to French atomic tests in the Sahara and the UN's handling of the Congo situation. He says these show the "callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers."

So, focusing on the part about the French atomic tests in the Sahara. Nkrumah is pointing out that when African countries opposed the tests, their opposition was largely ignored. This implies that the French didn't take African concerns seriously. Why? Because the Great Powers (like France) didn't care much about African independence; they were more focused on their own interests.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one aligns with this. The options are:

A: A continent that needs French intervention to maintain peace.
B: Important due to the Sahara's natural resources.
C: An example of successful political union.
D: A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War.
E: An obstacle to French atomic tests in the Sahara.
F: A strong political union.
G: A threat to French power and influence.
H: A continent too divided to be of significance.
I: A collection of republics tottering into anarchy.

From the speech, Nkrumah is critical of the French atomic tests and how the African opposition was ignored. So the French probably saw Africa as a place where they could conduct their tests without much resistance or concern for African opinions. That suggests that the French viewed Africa as a resource to be used for their own purposes, like enhancing their power, perhaps during the Cold War when such tests were significant.

Option D says "A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War." That makes sense because France was a major power and the Sahara tests were likely part of their strategic interests, maybe to assert their influence or test their nuclear capabilities.

Option E suggests that Africa was an obstacle, but the speech indicates the oppositeâ€”the French didn't face significant opposition because they disregarded African concerns.

Option G says a threat, but the speech doesn't indicate that the French felt threatened by Africa; instead, they were dismissive.

So, putting it together, the French viewed Africa as a resource to enhance their own power, especially in the context of the Cold War. So the correct answer should be D.

The French saw Africa as a resource for enhancing their power, particularly during the Cold War. This is evident from Nkrumah's mention of their disregard for African opposition to atomic tests in the Sahara, indicating Africa was viewed as a means to further French interests.

Answer: D
