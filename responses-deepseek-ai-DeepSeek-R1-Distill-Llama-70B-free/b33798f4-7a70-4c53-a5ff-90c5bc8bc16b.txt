Okay, so I have this question about where the TV show "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" is set. I'm not super familiar with all the details, but I'll try to think it through. 

First, I remember that Mary Tyler Moore was a popular sitcom. The main character, Mary Richards, works in television. I think she's a news producer or something like that. The show is known for being one of the first to feature a single, professional woman as the main character, which was a big deal at the time.

Now, the question is about the city where the show is set. The options are A: New York, B: Dallas, C: Seattle, D: San Francisco, E: Los Angeles, F: Boston, G: Philadelphia, H: Chicago, I: Minneapolis, J: Miami.

I don't recall the exact city, but I think it's a Midwestern city. Let me think about other clues. The show's setting might be a city that's not as commonly featured as New York or LA. Minneapolis rings a bell. I think I've heard that before in relation to this show. 

Wait, wasn't there a statue or something in Minneapolis related to the show? Like a Mary Tyler Moore statue? Oh right, I think there's a statue of Mary tossing her hat in the air, which is a famous scene from the opening credits. That scene was filmed in Minneapolis, so the show must be set there.

Also, the show's creator, I believe, was from the Midwest. Maybe that's why they chose Minneapolis. It's a major city in Minnesota, so that fits as the setting. 

Looking at the other options, New York is a common setting for many shows, but I don't think this one is. Dallas is more associated with the soap opera "Dallas." San Francisco has shows like "Full House" and "The Streets of San Francisco." Chicago has "The Good Wife" and "ER," but I don't think "Mary Tyler Moore" was set there. 

So putting it all together, I'm pretty confident the answer is Minneapolis, which is option I.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show is set in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This is supported by the show's opening credits, which feature Mary Richards tossing her hat in the air near a famous statue in Minneapolis, and the fact that the show's creator chose the Midwestern city for its setting.
