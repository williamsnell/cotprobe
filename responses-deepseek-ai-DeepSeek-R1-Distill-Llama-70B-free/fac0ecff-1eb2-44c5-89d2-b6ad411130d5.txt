Okay, so I've got this question here, and I need to figure out the difference between "caveat emptor" and "ceteris paribus". Hmm, I remember these are Latin phrases, but I'm a bit fuzzy on their exact meanings. Let me think through each one.

First, "caveat emptor". I think this is a legal term. From what I remember, it's something about buyers and sellers. Oh right, it's a principle that means the buyer is responsible for checking the quality of the goods before purchase. So the seller isn't necessarily required to disclose defects. The phrase itself translates to "let the buyer beware". So in simpler terms, it's like a warning to the buyer to be cautious and do their due diligence.

Now, "ceteris paribus" is another Latin term. I've heard this used in economics or when discussing variables in experiments. The phrase means "all other things being equal" or "holding other factors constant". It's used when analyzing the effect of one variable while assuming all others are held constant. So, for example, if you're studying how the price of a product affects demand, you might assume that other factors like consumer preferences or income levels remain unchanged.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: 'Caveat emptor' is 'Buyer's guarantee' – no, that's the opposite. It's more like the buyer has to beware, not that they are guaranteed anything. So A is wrong.

Option B: 'Caveat emptor' is 'Buyer beware' and 'Ceteris paribus' is 'all things constant'. I think that's partially correct. "Buyer beware" is right, and "all things constant" is close, but the exact translation is "all other things being equal". So maybe B is correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option C: 'Caveat emptor' is 'Let the buyer beware' and 'Ceteris paribus' is 'all other things being equal'. That sounds right. Both parts match what I remember.

Option D: 'Buyer beware' and 'other things unchanged' – similar to C, but the phrasing is a bit different. "Other things unchanged" is correct for ceteris paribus, but the first part is correct too. Wait, D says 'Let the buyer choose', which isn't right. So D is wrong.

Option E: 'Seller beware' – that's wrong. It's the buyer, not the seller. So E is incorrect.

Option F: 'Seller's warning' – no, that's not right. And 'everything else variable' is the opposite of ceteris paribus, which is about holding other variables constant. So F is wrong.

Option G: 'Seller is responsible' – that's the opposite of caveat emptor, which puts responsibility on the buyer. So G is wrong.

Option H: 'Buyer's choice' and 'equal rights' – both parts are incorrect. So H is wrong.

Option I: 'Guarantee for buyer' – no, because caveat emptor is about buyer beware, not a guarantee. So I is wrong.

Option J: 'Buyer decide' and 'with all other things' – not quite accurate. 'With all other things' isn't the exact meaning. So J is wrong.

So, the correct answer should be option C, because it correctly states both phrases: 'Let the buyer beware' for caveat emptor and 'all other things being equal' for ceteris paribus.

The correct answer is option C. 

C: 'Caveat emptor' is 'Let the buyer beware' and 'Ceteris paribus' is 'all other things being equal'.
