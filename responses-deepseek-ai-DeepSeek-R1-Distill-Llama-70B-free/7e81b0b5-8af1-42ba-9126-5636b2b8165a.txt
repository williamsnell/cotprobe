Okay, so I have this question about Hume and his view on justice. I'm a bit rusty on Hume, but I remember he was a Scottish philosopher, part of the Enlightenment era. I think he wrote about morality and ethics, right?

The question is asking what Hume believed about justice. The options are A through D. Let me think. I recall that Hume was a utilitarian in some sense, but wait, was he really? Or was it more about sentiments?

Wait, Hume's moral philosophy is based on sentiment rather than reason. He argued that moral distinctions are derived from our emotional reactions. So justice, as a moral concept, must tie into that.

I remember reading that Hume discussed the role of utility in justice. He probably saw justice as having value because it's useful. But I'm not sure if it's solely because of utility or if there's another aspect.

Looking at the options: Option B says it's valuable in part because it's useful to society. Option C says solely because it's useful to society. Option D is about the agent. Option A says no value, which I know isn't right because Hume did think justice was important.

So Hume's position, as I recall, is that justice arises from the usefulness it provides to society. But he might have also considered other factors. Wait, in his Treatise, he talks about how justice is an artificial virtue. It's not natural but arises from human conventions because of its utility. So the whole point of justice is the benefit it brings, which is the greater good for society.

But does that mean it's solely because of utility? Or is there another reason? I think he emphasizes that the value comes from its usefulness. So justice has value because it's useful, making society function better, promoting stability, etc.

So comparing the options, B says "in part" while C says "solely." I'm a bit stuck here. Did Hume think that utility was the main reason or the only reason? I think he might have said that the value comes solely from its utility. Because without the usefulness, there's no point to justice. So option C would be correct.

Wait, but another thought: Hume might have considered that justice also has value because it's part of our moral sentiments. But no, I think he more directly ties the value of justice to its utility. So the answer would be C.

But wait, option B says "in part because it is useful." Maybe Hume saw multiple factors contributing to its value, but I don't think so. I think for Hume, the primary or sole reason is utility. So the answer is C.

Hume's view on justice aligns with his broader moral philosophy, which emphasizes the role of utility and societal benefit. He considered justice an artificial virtue, arising from human conventions that promote social stability and well-being. The value of justice, according to Hume, is rooted in its usefulness to society, as it ensures the orderly functioning of human interactions and the protection of property and rights. While Hume's moral framework is sentiment-based, his discussion of justice specifically highlights its utility as the primary source of its value. Therefore, Hume's position is that justice has value solely because it is useful to society.

Answer: C
