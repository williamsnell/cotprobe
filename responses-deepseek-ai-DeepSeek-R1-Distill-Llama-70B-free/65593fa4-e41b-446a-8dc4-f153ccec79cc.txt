Okay, so I've got this question about withdrawal delirium and which substance has the highest risk when discontinued. Hmm, I need to think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that withdrawal delirium is a severe form of withdrawal, often involving confusion, hallucinations, and other cognitive disturbances. It's part of withdrawal syndromes for certain substances.

Let me go through each option:

A: Ecstasy. I don't recall ecstasy being commonly associated with withdrawal delirium. Maybe it's more about psychological effects rather than severe physical withdrawal.

B: Marijuana. I know marijuana can cause withdrawal symptoms like irritability and anxiety, but delirium? I don't think that's common. Most people don't experience severe delirium when stopping.

C: Alcohol. Oh right, alcohol withdrawal can be really serious. I've heard of delirium tremens (DTs), which is a severe form. It includes hallucinations and confusion, so that's a strong candidate.

D: Cocaine. Cocaine withdrawal is more about psychological symptoms like depression and anxiety. I don't think delirium is a major symptom here.

E: Tobacco. Withdrawal from nicotine can cause irritability and anxiety but not usually delirium. People might feel uncomfortable but not to the point of severe confusion.

F: Phenobarbital. This is a barbiturate. I think barbiturate withdrawal can be severe, similar to alcohol. It can cause seizures and delirium as well. So this might be a contender along with alcohol.

G: Heroin. Heroin withdrawal is known for being very uncomfortable, causing symptoms like nausea, sweating, and muscle aches. But I'm not sure about delirium. Maybe not the highest risk compared to others.

H: LSD. Hallucinogens can cause psychological effects, but withdrawal delirium? I don't think LSD has a significant physical withdrawal syndrome. It's more about the trip while using.

I: Methamphetamine. Meth withdrawal can cause severe psychological symptoms, like paranoia and hallucinations, but is delirium a prominent feature? I'm not certain. It might be, but I'm not sure if it's as high as alcohol.

J: Caffeine. Caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches and fatigue, but delirium is probably rare. Not a major concern here.

So, I'm trying to decide between C (Alcohol) and F (Phenobarbital). Both are known for severe withdrawal, but which one has the highest risk of delirium?

I remember that alcohol withdrawal is well-documented for delirium tremens, which is a medical emergency. Phenobarbital withdrawal can also cause delirium but maybe it's less commonly discussed than alcohol's DTs.

Wait, but in the options, the question is about the greatest risk. I think alcohol withdrawal is more commonly associated with delirium than any other substance listed here. So the answer would be C: Alcohol.

The risk of withdrawal delirium is greatest following discontinuation of alcohol. Alcohol withdrawal can lead to delirium tremens (DTs), a severe and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by hallucinations, confusion, and disorientation. While other substances like phenobarbital may also cause delirium during withdrawal, alcohol is the most commonly associated with this condition due to the well-documented severity of its withdrawal syndrome.

Answer: C
