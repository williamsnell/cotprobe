Okay, so I have this question about monopsony versus a competitive input market. Hmm, I remember that monopsony is when there's only one buyer in a market, right? Like, in the labor market, if there's only one employer, that's a monopsony. 

Wait, in a competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, so they can't influence prices much. So for labor, in a competitive market, firms would hire until the marginal revenue product equals the wage. But in a monopsony, since it's the only buyer, it has more power.

I think in a monopsony, the firm's decision to hire affects the wage because they're the only one buying. So the marginal cost of labor isn't just the wage rate; it's higher because when they hire more workers, they have to pay a higher wage to everyone. 

So in a competitive market, the supply curve is flat because each firm can hire at the market wage. But a monopsony faces an upward sloping supply curve. This means that to hire more workers, the monopsony has to pay a higher wage for all workers, not just the additional ones.

Wait, so how does this affect the hiring and wage compared to a competitive market? In competitive markets, firms pay the wage and hire based on where MRP equals the wage. In monopsony, since the marginal cost of labor is higher, the firm will hire less. Because they look at MRP and compare it to the higher marginal cost.

So compared to a competitive market, the monopsony hires fewer workers. What about the wage? Since the monopsony is a single buyer, they have the power to pay a lower wage. Wait, no, in a monopsony, the wage is determined where the supply curve meets the marginal factor cost (MFC). Or is it where MFC equals MRP?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In a competitive market, equilibrium is where the wage equals the MRP. But in monopsony, since the firm is the only buyer, the MFC (which is higher than the wage because of the upward sloping supply) is what matters. So the monopsony hires where MFC equals MRP. Since MFC is higher than the wage in the competitive case, the monopsony will hire fewer workers.

So in the competitive case, quantity is Q where wage (W) = MRP. In monopsony, quantity is Q' where MFC = MRP, and Q' < Q. What about the wage paid? In the competitive market, W is determined by the supply. In monopsony, the wage is determined by the supply curve at Q'. So since Q' is less than Q, and the supply curve is upward sloping, the wage in monopsony would be lower than the competitive wage. Because at a smaller Q, the wage is lower on the supply curve.

Wait, no. Wait, in a competitive market, the firms take the wage as given. So if the market supply curve is, say, increasing, then at higher Q, W is higher. So in the competitive case, they hire Q where MRP = W. In monopsony, they hire Q' where MRP = MFC, and MFC is higher than W at every Q except zero. So Q' is less than Q. The wage in monopsony is the wage corresponding to Q' on the supply curve. So the wage would be lower than the competitive wage because it's at a lower Q.

So putting it together: monopsony hires fewer workers and pays a lower wage compared to a competitive market.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that monopsony might pay a higher wage. No, that doesn't make sense. Because they're the sole buyer, they can pay lower. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think about the difference between monopsony and monopoly in product markets. In product monopoly, the firm is a sole seller, so they can charge higher prices and reduce quantity sold. So in monopsony, the firm is a sole buyer, so they can pay lower prices (wages) and hire fewer workers.

So yes, the monopsony pays less and hires fewer compared to a competitive market.

Looking at the options, the question asks: Relative to a competitive input market, a monopsony... So which option says pays less and hires fewer? Let's see the options.

Option G: pays less and hires fewer.

So the answer should be G.

In a competitive input market, firms operate where the marginal revenue product (MRP) equals the wage rate, hiring more workers as long as the additional worker's productivity (MRP) justifies the wage. In contrast, a monopsony—a market with only one buyer—faces an upward-sloping supply curve for labor. This means that to hire additional workers, the monopsony must pay a higher wage for all workers, not just the new ones. As a result, the monopsony equates the MRP to the marginal factor cost (MFC), which is higher than the wage rate at every level of employment except zero. Consequently, the monopsony hires fewer workers compared to a competitive market.

Additionally, since the monopsony faces an upward-sloping supply curve, the wage paid corresponds to the quantity of labor hired, which is lower than in the competitive market. Therefore, the monopsony pays a lower wage and hires fewer workers relative to a competitive input market.

The correct answer is **G: pays less and hires fewer**.
