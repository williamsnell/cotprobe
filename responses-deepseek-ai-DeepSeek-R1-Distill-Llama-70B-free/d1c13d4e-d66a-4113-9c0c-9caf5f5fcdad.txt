Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Okay, so the question is about a father taking out a term life insurance policy. The details given are: it's a 5-year term policy, the coverage is $15,000, and he's paying semiannual premiums. There are four parts to the question: (a) the semiannual premium amount, (b) total payment over five years, (c) what he receives at the end of five years, and (d) what the beneficiary gets if he dies at age 51.

First, I need to understand what a term life insurance policy typically entails. Term life provides coverage for a specific period (in this case, 5 years). If the insured dies during this period, the beneficiary receives the death benefit. If the policy term ends and the insured is still alive, usually there's no payout unless it's a return-of-premium policy, which isn't mentioned here.

So, for part (a), finding the semiannual premium. Since the policy is for 5 years, the total number of payments would be 5 years * 2 payments per year = 10 payments. But the question is asking for the amount of each semiannual premium. I don't have the exact premium rates, but looking at the options, I can infer based on the options given.

Wait, the question doesn't provide any tables or specific rates. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to know standard formulas or perhaps this is a typical question where the premiums are level and calculated based on the coverage amount. Alternatively, perhaps it's a group policy where the premium is calculated as a certain amount per thousand dollars of coverage.

Looking at the options, for part (a), the options are around $100 to $150 per semiannual payment. Let's think: if the total premium over five years is 10 payments, and coverage is $15,000, what would each payment be.

Wait, perhaps it's a term policy where the total premium for the term is the coverage amount. But that doesn't make much sense because usually, the premium is less than the coverage. Alternatively, maybe the premium is calculated as a certain rate per $1,000 of coverage.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's a 5-year term policy with annual premiums, but he's paying semiannually, so each payment is half the annual premium. But without the exact rate, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the total premium paid over five years is equal to the coverage amount. But that can't be right because for a $15,000 policy, paying $15,000 in premiums over five years would mean high premiums.

Wait, let's look at the options. Option E, for example, has a semiannual premium of $150. Over 10 payments, that's 10 * $150 = $1,500 total. But the coverage is $15,000. So that's much less than the coverage, which makes sense. Similarly, option A is $100.95 * 10 = ~$1,009.50.

But wait, the options for (b) are the total over five years. For example, option C says $1,209.50, which is 10 * $120.95, but wait, looking at option C's (a) is $100.95, which would make (b) 10 * 100.95 = $1,009.50. But option C's (b) is $1,209.50. Hmm, so that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Let me clarify each part:

(a) Semiannual premium: each payment is X.

(b) Total over five years: 10 * X.

(c) At end of five years: For term life, if the insured survives, usually there's no payout, so (c) should be $0. But some options have $15,000 here, which would be if it's a return-of-premium policy, but the question doesn't specify that. So I think (c) is $0.

(d) If he dies at 51: the policy is to age 50. Wait, the policy is taken out when he's age... Wait, the question says "policy to age 50". So the father's current age isn't given, but the policy is until he's 50. So if he dies at 51, the policy would have already ended, so the beneficiary wouldn't receive anything. So (d) would be $0.

Wait, but some options have $15,000 for (d). Let me think: if the policy is to age 50, and he dies at 51, that's beyond the policy term. So no payout. So in the options, (d) should be $0.

Looking at the options, let's match each part:

Looking for:

(a) semiannual premium: ?

(b) total over five years: 10 * (a)

(c) $0

(d) $0

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: (c) is $0, (d) $15,000. So (d) isn't 0, so A is out.

Option B: (c) $15k, which isn't right, (d) $0. But (c) is wrong.

Option C: (c) $15k, which is wrong.

Option D: (c) $0, (d) $15k. So (d) wrong.

Option E: (c) $0, (d) $15k. Again, (d) wrong.

Option F: (c) $15k, wrong.

Option G: (c) $0, (d) $15k.

Option H: (c) $15k, (d) $0. So (c) is wrong.

Option I: (c) $15k, wrong.

Option J: (c) $15k, wrong.

Wait, none of the options have (c) as $0 except A, D, E, G. But looking again:

Wait, option E: (c) is $0, (d) $15k. So (d) is wrong.

Option D: (c) $0, (d) $15k. So (d) is wrong.

Option G: (c) $0, (d) $15k. So again (d) wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-express the problem.

Policy is to age 50, 5-year term. So if he's, say, 45 when taking the policy, the policy ends at 50, so if he dies at 51, it's beyond the term. So (d) would be $0.

Looking again for options where (c) is 0 and (d) is 0. Hmm, none of the options have (c) and (d) both 0 except perhaps looking again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each option:

Option A: (c) 0, (d) 15k. So only (c) correct.

Option B: (c)=15k, (d)=0. So (c) wrong.

Option C: (c)=15k, (d)=15k. Both wrong.

Option D: (c)=0, (d)=15k.

Option E: (c)=0, (d)=15k.

Option F: (c)=15k, (d)=0.

Option G: (c)=0, (d)=15k.

Option H: (c)=15k, (d)=0.

Option I: (c)=15k, (d)=0.

Option J: (c)=15k, (d)=0.

Wait, I was hoping to find an option where both (c) and (d) are correct, but I don't see any. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the policy term. The policy is "to age 50", so coverage is until the father reaches 50. So if he dies at 51, which is after the policy has ended, the beneficiary gets nothing. So (d) is $0. So looking for options where (c)=0 and (d)=0.

Wait, but looking at the options again, none have both (c) and (d) as 0. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding part (c). Let me re-examine part (c): "How much will he receive at the end of the five years?"

In a standard term life policy, if the insured survives the term, they don't receive anything. So (c) should be $0. But some options have $15,000, which would be the case if it's a term policy that returns the premiums, but the question doesn't state that. So I think (c) is $0.

So, among the options, the ones with (c)=0 and (d)=0 don't exist. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking again at the options:

Option A: (c)=0, (d)=15k.

Option E: (c)=0, (d)=15k.

Option B: (c)=15k, (d)=0.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm wrong about (d). Let me think again. The policy is taken out for 5 years, so coverage is for 5 years. If the father takes the policy when he's, say, 45, the policy covers until he's 50. If he dies at 51, which is beyond the 5-year term, so no coverage. So (d) is 0.

Wait, but if the policy is "to age 50", that means it covers until his 50th birthday. So if he dies the day after turning 50, that's 51, so it's over. So (d) is 0.

So I'm looking for an option where (c)=0 and (d)=0. But none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps I need to recheck the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each option again:

Option A: (a) $100.95, (b) $1009.50, (c) $0, (d) $15,000.

So for (d), $15k. That would mean that the beneficiary receives the death benefit even after the policy term. So that's incorrect because the policy has ended.

Option B: (a) $150, (b) $1800, (c) $15k, (d) $0.

But (c) can't be $15k unless it's a return-of-premium policy, which we don't have info on.

Option C: (a) $100.95, (b) $1209.50, (c) $15k, (d) $15k. So (c) and (d) both wrong.

Option D: (a) $142.95, (b) $1429.50, (c) $0, (d) $15k. Again, (d) wrong.

Option E: (a) $150, (b) $1500, (c) $0, (d) $15k. (d) wrong.

Option F: (a) $142.95, (b) $1429.50, (c) $15k, (d) $0. (c) wrong.

Option G: (a) $120.50, (b) $1205, (c) $0, (d) $15k. (d) wrong.

Option H: (a) $120.50, (b) $1446, (c) $15k, (d) $0. (c) wrong.

Option I: (a) $142.95, (b) $1715.40, (c) $15k, (d) $0. (c) wrong.

Option J: (a) $100.95, (b) $1209.50, (c) $15k, (d) $0. (c) wrong.

Wait, none of the options have both (c) and (d) correct as 0. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding part (c). Perhaps part (c) refers to the return of premium, but the question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe part (c) is asking about the cash value, but term policies typically don't have cash value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that if the policy is for five years, the coverage is $15,000, so at the end of five years, the policy ends, and he doesn't receive anything. So (c) is $0.

But looking for an option where (c)=0 and (d)=0. But none have that. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the policy term. The policy is "to age 50", which might mean that the term is until he reaches 50. So if he bought the policy at age 45, it covers until he's 50, which is a 5-year term. So if he dies at 51, the policy has already ended, so (d)=0.

So the correct answers would be:

(a) semiannual premium: let's say it's X.

(b) 10 * X.

(c) $0.

(d) $0.

Looking at the options, none have both (c) and (d) as 0. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question considers that the policy is in force until just before he turns 51, so if he dies at 51, it's covered. Wait, that would depend on the exact terms. For example, if the policy is "to age 50", it might cover up to the day before his 50th birthday. So if he dies on his 50th birthday or after, it's not covered. If he dies at 51, definitely not covered.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the parts where I can find the correct numbers. Let's look at (b) and (a). For example, if in option E, (a) is $150, so (b) would be 10 * 150 = $1500, which matches option E's (b) as $1500. But (c) is 0 and (d) is 15k, which is wrong.

Option A: (a) 100.95, (b) 10 * 100.95 = 1009.50. So (b) matches. (c)=0, which is correct. (d)=15k, which is wrong.

Option C: (a) 100.95, (b) 10*100.95=1009.50, but option C's (b) is $1209.50, which doesn't match.

Option J: (a) 100.95, (b) 10*100.95=1009.50, but option J's (b) is $1209.50, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating because the payments are semiannual, so maybe the total is (5 years)*(2 payments) = 10 payments. So (b) should be 10 times (a).

Looking again:

Option A: (a) 100.95, (b) 1009.50. 100.95 *10=1009.5, correct.

Option E: (a)150, (b)1500. 150*10=1500, correct.

Option D: (a)142.95, (b)=1429.50, which is 10*142.95=1429.50, correct.

Option C: (a)=100.95, (b)=1209.50. 100.95*10=1009.5, which doesn't match 1209.50.

So options A, D, E have correct (a) and (b) relationships.

But earlier, we thought that (c) should be 0 and (d) should be 0.

Looking at option D: (c)=0, (d)=15k. So (d) is wrong.

Option E: (c)=0, (d)=15k. So (d) wrong.

Option A: (c)=0, (d)=15k. So (d) wrong.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in (d). If the father dies at age 51, and the policy is to age 50, then (d)=0. So none of the options have (d)=0 except B, F, H, I, J.

Wait, looking again:

Option B: (d)=0. But (c)=15k, which is wrong.

Option F: (d)=0. (c)=15k, wrong.

Option H: (d)=0. (c)=15k, wrong.

Option I: (d)=0. (c)=15k, wrong.

Option J: (d)=0. (c)=15k, wrong.

Hmm. So the only options with (d)=0 are B, F, H, I, J, but all have (c)=15k, which we think is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about (c). Maybe (c) is the return of premium. But the question doesn't state that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that at the end of five years, the policy ends, so the father stops paying premiums, but doesn't receive anything. So (c)=0.

But none of the options with (d)=0 have (c)=0.

Wait, perhaps I need to make a different approach. Let's think about what the correct answers are logically, and see which option matches.

(a) Semiannual premium: Let's say it's $100.95. Then (b) would be 10 * 100.95 = $1009.50.

(c) At end of five years: $0.

(d) Death at 51: $0.

Looking for an option where (a)=100.95, (b)=1009.50, (c)=0, (d)=0. But none of the options match this.

Wait, option A has (a)=100.95, (b)=1009.50, (c)=0, (d)=15k. So only (d) is wrong.

Option J: (a)=100.95, (b)=1209.50, which doesn't match 10 * 100.95.

So perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about each part:

(a) The semiannual premium is calculated based on the coverage. Some term policies have level premiums, so the same payment every period.

Assuming it's a 5-year term, $15,000 coverage. The total premium for the term is, say, $1,500 (as in option E: 5 years * 2 = 10 payments of $150 each, totaling $1,500).

But I don't have the actual rate, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct (a) is $142.95, which when multiplied by 10 gives $1,429.
