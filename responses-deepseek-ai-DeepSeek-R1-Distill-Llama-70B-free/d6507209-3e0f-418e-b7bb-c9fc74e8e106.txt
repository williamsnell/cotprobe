Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I marvel not a little, right worshipful, that since the first discovery of America (which is now full four score and ten years), after so great conquests and plantings of the Spaniards and Portuguese there, that we of England could never have the grace to set fast footing in such fertile and temperate places as are left as yet unpossessed of them. But . . . I conceive great hope that the time approacheth and now is that we of England may share and part stakes [divide the prize] (if we will ourselves) both with the Spaniard and the Portuguese in part of America and other regions as yet undiscovered.
"And surely if there were in us that desire to advance the honor of our country which ought to be in every good man, we would not all this while have [neglected] the possessing of these lands which of equity and right appertain unto us, as by the discourses that follow shall appear most plainly."
â€”Richard Hakluyt, Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent, 1582

Okay, so I've got this history question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a passage from Richard Hakluyt's "Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent," written in 1582. I need to determine which influence is reflected in the ideas expressed there.

Hmm, I remember that Richard Hakluyt was an English writer and a promoter of exploration and colonization, especially in the Americas. So the passage is probably about England wanting to establish colonies in America.

Looking at the passage, Hakluyt is talking about how the English haven't really set up a strong presence in the fertile and temperate regions of America, even though the Spanish and Portuguese have made great conquests and plantations there. He's expressing hope that the English can share in the prize, so to speak, by establishing themselves in these areas. He also mentions that these lands rightfully belong to England and that it's their duty to take them.

So the key ideas here are about exploration, colonization, and the belief that England has a right to these lands. Now, looking at the options provided, I need to match these ideas to one of the influences.

Option A is the Renaissance. The Renaissance was a cultural and intellectual movement that started in Italy and spread across Europe. It emphasized art, science, and humanism. While exploration was part of the Renaissance, I'm not sure if that's the main influence here. Hakluyt's focus seems more on colonization and economic gain rather than cultural or scientific discovery for its own sake.

Option B is the Enlightenment philosophy of natural rights. The Enlightenment was later, in the 17th and 18th centuries, focusing on reason, individual rights, and liberties. The passage doesn't really talk about individual rights but more about national rights to land, so maybe not B.

Option C is the social contract theory. That's more about government legitimacy coming from the people, again a bit later and more associated with thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. The passage here is about claiming land, not about governance structure.

Option D is the political philosophy of absolutism, which is about strong central authority and the divine right of kings. The passage doesn't seem to mention the king's authority directly, but rather England's right to the land. So maybe it's more about the nation's claim than the monarch's absolute power.

Option E is mercantilism. Mercantilism was an economic policy where the goal was to maximize exports and have a favorable balance of trade, often through colonies supplying raw materials to the mother country. It was a major driver of European colonization. Hakluyt's push for England to establish colonies to share in the wealth and resources of America fits well with mercantilist ideas.

Option F is capitalism, which is more about private enterprise and market-driven economies. While related, capitalism as a philosophy is broader, and the passage is more about national economic policy, which points more to mercantilism.

Option G is the religious philosophy of conversion. That's about converting native populations to Christianity. The passage doesn't mention religion or conversion, so probably not G.

Option H is predestination, a theological idea about being chosen by God. Again, not directly related here.

Option I is the divine right of kings, which ties back to D. It's about the king's authority being from God, but the passage is more about England's right to the land, not the king's divine authority.

Option J is the philosophy of colonialism. Colonialism is the practice of acquiring control over other countries, exploiting them economically. While the passage is about colonization, the specific influence being asked is which philosophy or movement. Mercantilism is an economic policy that drives colonialism, so maybe E is more precise.

Wait, but is the passage specifically about economic policy? Hakluyt does talk about the fertile lands and the potential for England to benefit, which aligns with mercantilist goals of gaining wealth and resources through colonies.

So putting it all together, the passage reflects the influence of mercantilism because it's about England establishing colonies to gain economic benefits, which was a key aspect of mercantilist policy during that time.

The passage from Richard Hakluyt's "Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent" reflects the influence of mercantilism. Mercantilism was an economic policy that emphasized maximizing exports, maintaining a favorable balance of trade, and acquiring wealth through colonial resources. Hakluyt's argument for England to establish colonies in America to share in the wealth and resources of the New World aligns closely with these mercantilist goals. While colonialism is a broader practice, the specific economic motivations highlighted in the passage point to mercantilism as the most precise influence.
