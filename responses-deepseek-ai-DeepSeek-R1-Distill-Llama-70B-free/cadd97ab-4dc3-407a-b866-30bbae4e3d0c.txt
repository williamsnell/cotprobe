Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about older workers and their tendencies in the workplace. Let's break it down.

The question is asking which option is something older workers are more likely to do or experience. The options are A through J. I'm not entirely sure about all of them, but I'll try to think through each one.

Starting with option A: Be absent from work. I've heard that older workers might have more health issues, so maybe they're absent more. But I'm not certain if that's the most accurate choice.

Option B: Be more prone to workplace accidents. I'm not sure. Younger workers might be more accident-prone because they're less experienced, or maybe older workers have more physical issues that could lead to accidents. This is a possibility, but I'm not sure it's the top choice.

Option C: Be less productive. I think this is a common stereotype, but I'm not sure if it's true. Some studies say older workers can be just as productive, maybe even more so due to experience.

Option D: Be less likely to learn new technology. That sounds like a stereotype too. I remember reading that older workers can learn new things, but maybe they might need a bit more time or different training methods. Not sure if this is the best answer.

Option E: Be less innovative. I'm not sure. Innovation can come from experience, so maybe older workers are just as innovative, perhaps in different ways.

Option F: Be resistant to change. Oh, this rings a bell. I think there's a common belief that older workers are more set in their ways and resist new changes or technologies. I've heard this in various contexts, like when companies try to adopt new software or processes.

Option G: Be laid off. I don't think age directly causes someone to be laid off more often, though maybe in certain industries or economic situations, but I'm not sure this is a general rule.

Option H: Retire early. Well, obviously, older workers are closer to retirement age, so they might retire, but the question is about what they're more likely to do while still working.

Option I: Be less motivated. I don't think that's necessarily true. Motivation can vary widely among individuals regardless of age.

Option J: Be dissatisfied with their jobs. Again, job satisfaction depends on many factors, not just age.

Putting it all together, the most likely option seems to be F: Be resistant to change. I think that's a common stereotype, even if it's not always accurate. So I'll go with F.

The most likely answer is F: Be resistant to change. Older workers are often stereotyped as being more set in their ways and resistant to new changes or technologies. 

Answer: F
