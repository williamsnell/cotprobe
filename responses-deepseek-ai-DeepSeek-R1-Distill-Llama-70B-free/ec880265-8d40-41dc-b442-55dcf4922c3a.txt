Okay, so I've got this question about telescopes and eyepieces. Hmm, I remember that telescopes use lenses to focus light, and the eyepiece is like the lens you look through to see the magnified image. The question is about calculating the focal length of the eyepiece needed to get a certain magnification.

Wait, the telescope has a focal length of 25 feet. The question asks what the eyepiece focal length should be to magnify a planetary object by 300 diameters. Oh right, magnification in telescopes is usually calculated using the formula M = (focal length of telescope) / (focal length of eyepiece). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, wait. I think the magnifying power M is actually given by the ratio of the telescope's focal length to the eyepiece's focal length. Yeah, M = F_telescope / F_eyepiece.

But wait, the units here are in feet and inches. Oh, right. The telescope is 25 ft, and the eyepiece options are given in inches. So I need to convert the units to make them consistent. Let me think, 1 foot is 12 inches, so 25 feet is 25 *12 = 300 inches. Oh right, that's easier.

So the magnification M is 300 diameters. Wait, sometimes magnification is expressed as diameters, which means the image is 300 times larger in diameter, so the linear magnification is 300x. So M is 300.

So using M = F_t / F_e, where F_t is 300 inches, and M is 300. So rearranging, F_e = F_t / M. Plugging in the numbers: F_e = 300 inches / 300 = 1 inch. Oh wait, so the eyepiece should have a focal length of 1 inch.

Looking at the options, option H is 1 inch. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait. Did I get the formula right? I'm a bit confused sometimes. Some sources say that the magnification is actually the telescope focal length divided by the eyepiece focal length. Yes, that's correct. So if M is 300, F_e is 300 inches / 300, which is 1 inch.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the required focal length of the eyepiece, we use the formula for magnification in telescopes:

\[
M = \frac{F_{\text{telescope}}}{F_{\text{eyepiece}}}
\]

Here, the magnification \( M \) is given as 300 diameters, and the telescope's focal length is 25 feet. Converting the telescope's focal length to inches (since the eyepiece options are in inches), we calculate:

\[
F_{\text{telescope}} = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 12 \, \frac{\text{inches}}{\text{foot}} = 300 \, \text{inches}.
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for the eyepiece's focal length:

\[
F_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{F_{\text{telescope}}}{M} = \frac{300 \, \text{inches}}{300} = 1 \, \text{inch}.
\]

Thus, the eyepiece must have a focal length of 1 inch. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 1 inch.**
