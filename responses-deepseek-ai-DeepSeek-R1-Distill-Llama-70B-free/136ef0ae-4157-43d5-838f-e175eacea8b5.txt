Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model. I remember that this model talks about different leadership styles based on the maturity of the team or the subordinates. 

The question is specifically asking about the Delegating Style. I think the model categorizes leadership into four main styles: Telling, Selling, Participating, and Delegating. Each style varies in terms of task orientation and relationship orientation.

I recall that task orientation is about how much the leader focuses on getting the job done, giving instructions, and making sure tasks are completed. Relationship orientation, on the other hand, is about building relationships, providing support, and considering the team's feelings and development.

So the Delegating style, if I remember correctly, is used when the team is highly mature. That means they're competent and confident, so they don't need much direction or support. In this case, the leader doesn't need to be high on task orientation because the team can handle the tasks on their own. Also, since the team is mature, the leader doesn't need to spend a lot of time on relationship building either because the team is self-motivated and works well together without needing much supervision or encouragement.

So the Delegating style would have low task orientation and low relationship orientation. Let me think about the options again. Option E is low task and low relationship. That sounds right because the leader is delegating tasks and doesn't need to be involved much in either direction.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not mixing it up. The four styles are:

1. Telling: High task, low relationship. This is for when the team is new and needs a lot of guidance.

2. Selling: High task, high relationship. This is for when the team has some ability but may lack confidence, so the leader still directs tasks but also provides support.

3. Participating: Low task, high relationship. Here, the team is capable but maybe not confident, so the leader focuses on building relationships and providing support rather than directing tasks.

4. Delegating: Low task, low relationship. The team is both capable and confident, so the leader just delegates and steps back.

Yes, that confirms it. So the Delegating style is low on both, which is option E.

The Delegating style in Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model is characterized by low task orientation and low relationship orientation. This style is appropriate when subordinates are highly mature, meaning they are both competent and confident. As a result, they require minimal direction and support, allowing the leader to step back and focus on delegating tasks without needing to emphasize either task guidance or relationship building.

E: low task orientation and low relationship orientation

Answer: E
