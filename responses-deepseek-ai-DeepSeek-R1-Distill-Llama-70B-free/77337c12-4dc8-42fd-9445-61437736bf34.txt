Okay, so I've got this problem here about resistors connected in parallel and calculating the maximum error in the total resistance R. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the formula given is 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3. Oh right, for parallel resistors, the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of each individual resistor. That makes sense because each resistor provides a path for the current, so the overall resistance is less than any individual one.

The given resistances are R1=25 Ω, R2=40 Ω, R3=50 Ω. Each has a possible error of 0.5%. I need to find the maximum error in R. Wait, how do I approach error propagation in this scenario?

I remember that when dealing with errors in calculations, especially for functions of multiple variables, we can use partial derivatives to estimate the error. So the general approach would be to find the total differential of R and then compute the maximum possible error based on the errors in R1, R2, R3.

Let me write that down. The formula is:

(1/R) = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3)

I'll need to find dR, the error in R, given the possible errors in each Ri. Let's denote the error in R as ΔR, and the errors in R1, R2, R3 as ΔR1, ΔR2, ΔR3 respectively.

Wait, but since all the errors are 0.5%, I can express each ΔRi as 0.005 * Ri. So ΔR1 = 0.005 * R1, same for the others.

But how do I relate ΔR to the ΔRi's? Let's take the differential of both sides of the equation. Taking the differential of 1/R:

d(1/R) = - (1/R²) dR

And the differential of the right side is:

d(1/R1) + d(1/R2) + d(1/R3) = (-1/R1²) dR1 + (-1/R2²) dR2 + (-1/R3²) dR3

So putting them together:

- (1/R²) dR = [ -1/R1² dR1 - 1/R2² dR2 - 1/R3² dR3 ]

Multiply both sides by -1:

(1/R²) dR = [ 1/R1² dR1 + 1/R2² dR2 + 1/R3² dR3 ]

Then, solving for dR:

dR = R² [ (dR1)/(R1²) + (dR2)/(R2²) + (dR3)/(R3²) ]

Hmm, so the error in R depends on the square of R times the sum of each (dRi)/(Ri²).

But wait, I should calculate R first. Let me compute R using the given values.

Calculating 1/R = 1/25 + 1/40 + 1/50.

Let me compute each term:

1/25 = 0.04
1/40 = 0.025
1/50 = 0.02

Adding them up: 0.04 + 0.025 = 0.065; 0.065 + 0.02 = 0.085. So 1/R = 0.085 → R = 1 / 0.085 ≈ 11.7647 Ω.

So R is approximately 11.7647 ohms.

Now, the next step is to compute the error dR. Let's plug everything into the equation for dR.

dR = R² [ (ΔR1)/(R1²) + (ΔR2)/(R2²) + (ΔR3)/(R3²) ]

Each ΔRi is 0.5% of Ri. So:

ΔR1 = 0.005 * 25 = 0.125 Ω
ΔR2 = 0.005 * 40 = 0.2 Ω
ΔR3 = 0.005 * 50 = 0.25 Ω

Now, compute each term inside the brackets:

Term1 = (0.125) / (25²) = 0.125 / 625 = 0.0002
Term2 = (0.2) / (40²) = 0.2 / 1600 = 0.000125
Term3 = (0.25) / (50²) = 0.25 / 2500 = 0.0001

Adding these terms: 0.0002 + 0.000125 + 0.0001 = 0.000425

So dR = (11.7647)^2 * 0.000425

First, compute (11.7647)^2. Let me approximate this. 12 squared is 144, but 11.7647 is a bit less.

Calculating 11.7647^2:

11 * 11 = 121.

But precise calculation:

11.7647 * 11.7647. Let me compute this step by step.

Alternatively, I can note that 11.7647 is approximately 11 + 0.7647.

But perhaps an easier approach is to compute 11.7647 squared:

11.7647 * 11.7647.

Well, 10^2 is 100. 1.7647^2 ≈ 3.11. But wait, that's not accurate. Let's compute it properly.

Alternatively, to compute 11.7647^2:

= (10 + 1.7647)^2 = 10^2 + 2*10*1.7647 + (1.7647)^2
= 100 + 35.294 + (3.112)
= 100 + 35.294 = 135.294 + 3.112 = 138.406.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 11.7647 × 11.7647 more accurately.

Hmm, perhaps I should use a calculator approach, but since I can't, I'll proceed with approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use R ≈ 11.7647. So R squared is approximately (11.7647)^2 = let's compute it as:

11.7647 × 11.7647:

Break it down: 11 × 11 = 121.

11 × 0.7647 = 8.4117

0.7647 × 11 = 8.4117

0.7647 × 0.7647 ≈ let's compute 0.76^2 is 0.5776, 0.0047^2 is negligible, so about 0.585.

So adding all: 121 + 8.4117 + 8.4117 + 0.585 ≈ 121 + 16.8234 + 0.585 ≈ 138.4084.

So approximately 138.408.

So R squared is about 138.408.

Then, dR = 138.408 * 0.000425.

Let me compute that.

138.408 * 0.000425 = ?

Well, 138 * 0.0004 is 0.0552.

138 * 0.000025 is 0.00345.

So 0.0552 + 0.00345 = 0.05865.

Wait, but also, 0.408 * 0.000425.

0.4 * 0.000425 is 0.00017. 0.008 * 0.000425 is 0.0000034. So total ≈ 0.0001734.

Adding that to 0.05865 gives approximately 0.0588234.

So dR ≈ 0.0588 Ω.

Wait, but the options are all fractions, like 1/20 is 0.05, 1/18 ≈ 0.0555, 1/17≈0.0588, 1/16=0.0625, etc.

Looking at the options, option H is 1/17 Ω, which is approximately 0.0588 Ω. That matches our calculated dR.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps because it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, R was calculated as 1/(sum of reciprocals) = 1/0.085 ≈ 11.7647 Ω.

Then, dR = R² [ (ΔR1/R1²) + (ΔR2/R2²) + (ΔR3/R3²) ]

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔR1 = 0.005 * 25 = 0.125

ΔR2 = 0.005 *40=0.2

ΔR3=0.005*50=0.25

So term1=0.125/(25^2)=0.125/625=0.0002

term2=0.2/(40^2)=0.2/1600=0.000125

term3=0.25/(50^2)=0.25/2500=0.0001

Sum=0.0002 +0.000125 +0.0001=0.000425

R^2= (11.7647)^2≈138.41

dR=138.41 *0.000425= approx 0.0588 Ω.

Which is 1/17 Ω, because 1/17≈0.0588.

Looking at the options, option H is 1/17 Ω.

So the correct answer should be H.

To estimate the maximum error in the calculated value of \( R \) for three resistors connected in parallel, we start with the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}
\]

The resistances are given as \( R_1 = 25 \, \Omega \), \( R_2 = 40 \, \Omega \), and \( R_3 = 50 \, \Omega \), each with a possible error of \( 0.5\% \). The goal is to calculate the maximum error in \( R \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( R \)
Using the formula for parallel resistors:

\[
\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{40} + \frac{1}{50}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{R} = 0.04 + 0.025 + 0.02 = 0.085
\]

\[
R = \frac{1}{0.085} \approx 11.7647 \, \Omega
\]

### Step 2: Error Propagation
The error in \( R \), denoted as \( \Delta R \), can be estimated using the total differential:

\[
\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3}
\]

Taking differentials:

\[
-\frac{1}{R^2} \Delta R = -\frac{\Delta R_1}{R_1^2} - \frac{\Delta R_2}{R_2^2} - \frac{\Delta R_3}{R_3^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\Delta R = R^2 \left( \frac{\Delta R_1}{R_1^2} + \frac{\Delta R_2}{R_2^2} + \frac{\Delta R_3}{R_3^2} \right)
\]

Each \( \Delta R_i \) is \( 0.5\% \) of \( R_i \):

\[
\Delta R_1 = 0.005 \cdot 25 = 0.125 \, \Omega, \quad \Delta R_2 = 0.005 \cdot 40 = 0.2 \, \Omega, \quad \Delta R_3 = 0.005 \cdot 50 = 0.25 \, \Omega
\]

Substituting into the error formula:

\[
\Delta R = R^2 \left( \frac{0.125}{25^2} + \frac{0.2}{40^2} + \frac{0.25}{50^2} \right)
\]

\[
\Delta R = R^2 \left( \frac{0.125}{625} + \frac{0.2}{1600} + \frac{0.25}{2500} \right)
\]

\[
\Delta R = R^2 \left( 0.0002 + 0.000125 + 0.0001 \right)
\]

\[
\Delta R = R^2 \cdot 0.000425
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta R \)
Using \( R^2 \approx 11.7647^2 \approx 138.41 \):

\[
\Delta R = 138.41 \cdot 0.000425 \approx 0.0588 \, \Omega
\]

### Step 4: Match with Options
The calculated error \( \Delta R \approx 0.0588 \, \Omega \) corresponds to \( \frac{1}{17} \, \Omega \), as \( \frac{1}{17} \approx 0.0588 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: \( \frac{1}{17} \, \Omega \)**
