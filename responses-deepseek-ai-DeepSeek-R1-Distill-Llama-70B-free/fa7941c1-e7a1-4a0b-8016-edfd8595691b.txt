Alright, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Moore and ethics. The question is asking what Moore considered the most fundamental question in all of ethics. The options are A through J, each presenting a different question or concept.

First, I need to recall what I know about G.E. Moore. He was a British philosopher known for his work in ethics, especially his book "Principia Ethica". In that book, Moore is famous for his concept of the "naturalistic fallacy," where he argues that you can't define 'good' in terms of natural properties because it's a non-natural property.

So, the question is about the most fundamental question in ethics. Moore emphasizes the importance of defining 'good'. He believed that ethics should focus on determining what 'good' is because all other ethical questions depend on this. For example, when we ask whether an action is right or wrong, we're really asking whether it leads to the greatest good.

Looking at the options, option F says, "how 'good' is to be defined." That seems to align with Moore's emphasis. Other options, like defining 'justice' (A) or 'evil' (J), are important but not as fundamental according to Moore. Similarly, whether ethics is a science (B) or if morality is subjective (C) or objective (I) are meta-ethical questions, but Moore's main focus was on the definition of 'good'.

Wait, but option G is "whether life is worth living," and H is about the meaning of life. Those are more existential questions, which might be more associated with philosophers like Camus or Sartre, not Moore. Option D is about God's existence, which relates to divine command theory, but Moore doesn't base his ethics on that; he's more of a non-theistic ethicist.

Option E is about humans being good or bad, which is more like a question discussed by philosophers such as Rousseau or Hobbes, but again, not central to Moore's ethics.

So putting it all together, the most fundamental question for Moore is defining 'good', which is option F.

The most fundamental question in ethics according to Moore is how "good" is defined, as he emphasizes that all ethical inquiries hinge on understanding this concept.

Answer: F
