Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is: "How many positive and negative integers is 12 a multiple of?" And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, wait. Let me make sure I understand the question correctly. When they say "positive and negative integers is 12 a multiple of," I think they're asking: for how many integers (both positive and negative) does 12 become a multiple of those integers. So, in other words, how many integers n are there such that 12 is a multiple of n. Because a multiple means that 12 = k * n for some integer k.

So, I need to find all integers n where n divides 12 exactly. That means n is a divisor of 12. But since the question includes both positive and negative integers, I should consider both.

Let me start by listing the positive divisors of 12. The positive divisors are the numbers that divide 12 without leaving a remainder. So, starting from 1:

1 divides 12 because 12/1 = 12, which is an integer.

2 divides 12 because 12/2 = 6.

3 divides 12 because 12/3 = 4.

4 divides 12 because 12/4 = 3.

6 divides 12 because 12/6 = 2.

12 divides itself, so that's also a factor.

So the positive divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. That's six positive integers.

Now, for each positive divisor, there's a corresponding negative divisor because negative times negative gives positive. So for each positive n, -n is also a divisor. So for each of the six positive divisors, there's a negative one: -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12.

So that's another six negative integers.

Wait, but wait a minute. Does zero count? Because zero is neither positive nor negative. But wait, can 12 be a multiple of zero? Let me think. The definition of a multiple is that 12 = k * n, where k is an integer. But if n is zero, then 12 = k * 0, which would imply 12=0, which is impossible. So n cannot be zero. So zero is not a divisor of 12. So we can ignore zero.

So total divisors are positive and negative ones. So 6 positive and 6 negative, making a total of 12.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A to J, with F being 12. So is the answer 12? But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

Wait, wait another thought. The question says "positive and negative integers is 12 a multiple of." So maybe the question is asking for the number of integers n where 12 is a multiple of n. So that's exactly what I thoughtâ€”divisors of 12, including negatives.

So positive divisors are 6 in number, negative divisors are 6, so total 12. So answer F:12.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 12, which would be the correct answer. But wait, let me just double-check if I missed any numbers or counted any extras.

Wait, positive divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. That's six. Negative divisors: -1,-2,-3,-4,-6,-12. That's another six. So 6+6=12 total. So yes, the answer should be 12.

So the correct option is F.

To determine how many positive and negative integers 12 is a multiple of, we need to identify all integers \( n \) such that \( 12 = k \cdot n \) for some integer \( k \). These \( n \) are the divisors of 12.

1. **Positive Divisors**: The positive integers that divide 12 without leaving a remainder are:
   \[
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
   \]
   This gives us 6 positive divisors.

2. **Negative Divisors**: For each positive divisor, there is a corresponding negative divisor. Thus, the negative divisors of 12 are:
   \[
   -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12
   \]
   This also gives us 6 negative divisors.

3. **Zero**: Zero is excluded because division by zero is undefined, and 12 cannot be a multiple of zero.

Adding the positive and negative divisors together, we get:
\[
6 \, (\text{positive}) + 6 \, (\text{negative}) = 12
\]

Thus, there are 12 integers (6 positive and 6 negative) for which 12 is a multiple. The correct answer is:

**F: 12**
