Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Gauthier and the morality he describes as facing a foundational crisis. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that David Gauthier is a philosopher known for his work in ethics and political philosophy. His book "Morals by Agreement" comes to mind. In that work, he discusses the idea of a social contract and the basis of morality.

The question is asking about the morality that's facing a foundational crisis. So, I need to recall what Gauthier argues about the nature of morality. I think he's critical of certain moral theories and argues that without a proper foundation, morality might be in trouble.

Gauthier's position is often associated with contractarianism, which is a form of ethical theory. Contractarians believe that moral principles are based on agreements or contracts between rational individuals. So, the idea is that morality arises from mutual agreements to cooperate because it's beneficial for everyone.

Now, the options given are various ethical theories. Let me go through them:

A: Consequentialism. That's the idea that the morality of an action depends on its consequences. Like utilitarianism. I don't think this is the one Gauthier is talking about.

B: Justified constraint. Hmm, not a term I'm too familiar with. Maybe related to constraints on actions being justified?

C: Pure altruism. That's acting solely for the benefit of others. Doesn't seem to fit with Gauthier's contractarian view, which is more about self-interest.

D: Divine command theory. That's the belief that morality comes from God's commands. I don't think Gauthier is addressing this here.

E: Virtue ethics. Focuses on character traits rather than actions. Not directly related to the crisis he's discussing.

F: Deontological ethics. This is about duties and rules, like Kant's theory. Gauthier's contractarianism is different.

G: Moral relativism. The idea that moral judgments are relative to culture. Not sure if this is the crisis he's pointing out.

H: Prima facie duties. A term from W.D. Ross, about duties that are binding unless overridden. Maybe part of deontological ethics, but not the main issue Gauthier addresses.

I: Enlightened egoism. This is acting in one's self-interest with a long-term view. Actually, Gauthier's contractarian approach is a form of enlightened egoism because individuals agree to moral rules for mutual benefit.

Wait, so the question is about the morality facing a crisis. Gauthier argues that traditional morality (which he might associate with something else) is in crisis because it lacks a solid foundation. He proposes that contractarianism provides the foundation. So the morality in crisis would be the one that's not based on mutual agreement.

Wait, I think in his critique, Gauthier might be pointing out that without a contractarian basis, other moral theories can't withstand challenges. So which of these options is the traditional morality that's in crisis?

Alternatively, maybe the crisis is because traditional morality is based on something other than mutual agreement, and that foundation is collapsing. For example, if morality was previously based on divine command (option D), and that's now in crisis, but I don't think that's what Gauthier is focusing on.

Wait, another angle: Gauthier's argument is that without a proper understanding of morality as based on rational agreement (contract), other forms of morality can't be justified. So the crisis is that people are realizing that traditional moral theories don't have a solid foundation.

Looking at the options again, 'justified constraint' (option B) sounds like it could relate to his idea of constraints on behavior being morally justified through mutual agreement. So if the morality is about constraints that are justified, and that's in crisis because the justification is lacking, that might be the case.

Alternatively, 'moral relativism' is a possible crisis, but I don't think that's the main point Gauthier makes. He's more focused on the rational basis of morality rather than its relativity.

Wait, in "Morals by Agreement," Gauthier argues that without an agreement-based approach, morality can't be rationally justified. So the traditional morality that's in crisis is the one that's not based on such agreements. So perhaps it's the morality that relies on constraints that aren't justified through mutual agreement.

Therefore, the answer would be option B: justified constraint. Because the morality facing a crisis is one that can't justify its constraints, and Gauthier offers contractarianism as the solution.

The question asks about the morality that Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis. David Gauthier, in his work "Morals by Agreement," critiques traditional moral theories and argues that morality must be grounded in rational agreements between individuals. He contends that without such a foundation, morality lacks justification and faces a crisis.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Consequentialism** focuses on consequences, which isn't central to Gauthier's critique.
- **B: Justified constraint** refers to constraints on behavior being morally justified. Gauthier argues that without a contractarian basis, such constraints lack proper justification, making this a plausible answer.
- **C: Pure altruism** involves acting solely for others, which doesn't align with Gauthier's contractarianism.
- **D: Divine command theory** is about morality deriving from divine authority, which isn't Gauthier's focus.
- **E: Virtue ethics** emphasizes character traits, unrelated to the crisis Gauthier describes.
- **F: Deontological ethics** involves duties and rules, which Gauthier's contractarianism critiques as lacking foundation.
- **G: Moral relativism** suggests morality varies by culture, not the crisis Gauthier addresses.
- **H: Prima facie duties** are part of deontological ethics, which Gauthier critiques.
- **I: Enlightened egoism** involves long-term self-interest, which aligns with Gauthier's contractarian approach but isn't the morality in crisis.

Gauthier's critique centers on the lack of justification for constraints in traditional morality. Therefore, the morality facing a foundational crisis is best described as **justified constraint**.
