Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically dealing with free abelian groups and their subgroups. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine whether each is true or false. Let's break them down one by one.

Statement 1 says: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian.

Wait, I remember that in group theory, a free abelian group is one that has no relations except those necessarily present in an abelian group. So it's like a free group, but with commutativity. And every subgroup of a free abelian group should also be free abelian. Oh right, because free abelian groups are Noetherian, and their subgroups are also free. But wait, is that only for finitely generated ones? I think that's right. Since the group is finitely generated and free abelian, any subgroup is also finitely generated and free. So Statement 1 should be true.

Now, Statement 2: If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G/K is free abelian.

Hmm. G is a finitely generated free abelian group, K is a subgroup. So G/K is a quotient group. I remember that for finitely generated abelian groups, the structure theorem tells us they can be decomposed into direct sums of cyclic groups. So if G is free abelian and finitely generated, it's isomorphic to Z^n for some n. 

Subgroups of Z^n are also free abelian, as per Statement 1, which we think is true. So K would be isomorphic to Z^k for some k ≤ n. The quotient group G/K would then be Z^n / Z^k. Wait, what does that look like? 

If k = n, then the quotient is trivial, which is free abelian (the trivial group is technically free). If k < n, then the quotient would be Z^{n - k}, which is free abelian. Oh wait, but wait a second. What if K isn't a direct summand? Or does it not matter? Because in Z^n, any subgroup is a direct summand. Because Z^n is a free abelian group of finite rank, and any subgroup is a free abelian group of lower rank. So when you take the quotient, it's isomorphic to Z^{n - k}, which is free abelian. 

So Statement 2 would be true as well. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Suppose G is Z^2, and K is the subgroup generated by (2,0). Then K is isomorphic to Z, so it's free abelian. The quotient G/K would consist of elements like (a,b) + K. But in this case, the quotient would be isomorphic to Z, because (1,0) + K would have order 2? Wait, no, wait. Let's compute G/K.

Wait, G is Z^2, which is like all pairs of integers. K is generated by (2,0). So in G/K, each coset is like (a,b) + K. Let's see what the elements look like. For any (a,b), we can subtract multiples of (2,0) to get (a mod 2, b). So each coset can be represented by (0 or 1, b). But in the quotient group, the operation is addition. So adding (1, b1) and (1, b2) gives (2, b1+b2), which is equivalent to (0, b1+b2) mod K. Hmm. So the group operation would effectively be adding the first components modulo 2 and the second components modulo nothing. Wait, no, because the second component isn't being quotiented. So maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the quotient G/K isn't free abelian. Because if K is generated by (2,0), then G/K would have elements where the first component is mod 2. So it's like Z/2Z × Z. But Z/2Z is a torsion group, not free abelian. So the quotient would have torsion, meaning it's not free abelian. Oh! So Statement 2 is false?

Wait, but wait a second. In my example, G is Z^2, K is generated by (2,0). So K is a free abelian group of rank 1. Then G/K is... Let me think about the structure. The quotient group would have elements of the form (a, b) + K. The operation is addition. So, for the first component, a can be 0 or 1 modulo 2 because adding (2,0) wraps around. But the second component is any integer. So the group is isomorphic to Z × Z/2Z. Oh wait, no, no. Because when you mod out by (2,0), the (0,1) element in G/K would have infinite order in the second component. But the first component is mod 2. So the group is isomorphic to Z × (Z/2Z), which is not free abelian because it has torsion elements (like (0,1) has order 2). So G/K is not free abelian in this case.

Wait, but I thought that in finitely generated abelian groups, the quotient of a free abelian group by a free abelian subgroup is projective, but not necessarily free. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that any subgroup of a free abelian group is a direct summand, but that's only for free abelian groups of finite rank? Or is that incorrect. Because in my example, K is not a direct summand. Because if it were, then G would be K ⊕ something, but in my case, K is generated by (2,0), which isn't a direct summand of Z^2. Because if it were, then Z^2 would split into K and another subgroup isomorphic to Z. But in reality, if you take K = (2,0)Z, then any complement would have to be generated by (1,0) and (0,1), but (1,0) isn't in K, but their combinations could give the whole group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should recall that in finitely generated free abelian groups, every subgroup is indeed free abelian (that's true), but the quotient isn't necessarily free. Because the quotient could have torsion, as in my example.

So putting it all together:

Statement 1: True.

Statement 2: False.

So looking back at the options, which option has Statement 1 as True and Statement 2 as False? Let's see.

Options:

A: False, True → No.

B: False, Undetermined → No.

C: True, False → Yes.

D: Both undetermined → No.

E: False, False → No.

F: Undetermined, True → No.

G: True, Undetermined → No.

H: S1 undetermined, S2 true → No.

I: True, True → No.

J: Undetermined, False → No.

So the correct option should be C: True, False.

Statement 1: If \( K \) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \( K \) is free abelian.  
This is true because all subgroups of free abelian groups are themselves free abelian. For finitely generated free abelian groups, this follows from the structure theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, which ensures that subgroups inherit the free abelian property.

Statement 2: If \( K \) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \( G / K \) is free abelian.  
This is false. While \( G \) is a finitely generated free abelian group and \( K \) is a free abelian subgroup, the quotient \( G / K \) is not necessarily free abelian. For example, if \( G = \mathbb{Z}^2 \) and \( K \) is generated by \( (2, 0) \), then \( G / K \) is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), which has torsion and is therefore not free abelian.

Thus, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.

The correct option is:

C: True, False
