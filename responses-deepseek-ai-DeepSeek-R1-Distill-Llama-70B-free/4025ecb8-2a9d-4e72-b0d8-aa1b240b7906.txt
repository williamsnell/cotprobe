Question:

A year ago, a very wealthy man died in a car accident. A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. The butler also testified that the wealthy man had often confided in him and told him shortly after the woman's birth that the woman was the wealthy man's daughter. Upon objection by the attorney for the executor of the wealthy man's estate, the court will most likely

Options:

A: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony is considered privileged communication and is therefore inadmissible.
B: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.
C: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony would be considered gossip and not admissible in court.
D: sustain the objection bc butler's testimony would be violative of hearsay rule.
E: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony is considered a statement against interest and is therefore admissible.
F: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony qualifies under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.
G: sustain the objection because the butler's testimony would be in violation of attorney-client privilege.
H: overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under the dying declaration doctrine.
I: overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
J: sustain, bc butler's testimony would be violative of Dead man's statute.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a wealthy man who died, and a woman is claiming to be his daughter. Her attorney calls the butler to testify. The butler says two things: first, that it was common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. Second, the butler testifies that the wealthy man told him shortly after the woman's birth that she was his daughter.

The question is about whether the court will sustain or overrule the objection from the executor's attorney. The options are A through J, each giving a different legal reason.

First, I need to identify what kind of evidence the butler is providing. The butler is recounting statements made by the wealthy man. That sounds like hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the woman is his daughter).

Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless there's an exception. So I need to think about which exceptions might apply here.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's privileged communication. That would apply if the statement was made in a confidential relationship, like attorney-client or doctor-patient. But butler and employer don't have such privilege, so A is probably not correct.

Option B says it's relevant to the ultimate issue, so overrule. Relevance is a factor, but the issue is whether it's hearsay, not just relevance. So B might not be the right reason.

Option C claims it's gossip. I'm not sure about that. Gossip might relate to reliability, but the butler's statement is about what the wealthy man told him directly, not just rumors.

Option D says it's hearsay. So if there's no exception, the objection would be sustained. But I'm trying to think if any exception applies.

Option E is about statement against interest. That applies when the declarant's statement is against their own interest at the time. Here, the wealthy man's statement was that he had a child, which might not necessarily be against his interest. It depends on the context, but I'm not sure this fits.

Option F refers to medical diagnosis. Doesn't apply here.

Option G is attorney-client privilege. Again, the butler isn't an attorney, so no.

Option H is dying declaration. That requires the declarant to believe they're about to die, which isn't indicated here.

Option I is pedigree exception. The pedigree exception allows statements about a person's family, like parentage, made in a family setting. So if the wealthy man made a statement about the woman being his daughter, that might fit under the pedigree exception.

Option J is the Dead Man's Statute, which generally prevents a party from testifying about a conversation with a deceased person if the other party is alive. But I think that's more about disqualifying the party from testifying, not the butler. So J might not apply here.

So, the key is whether the statement falls under the pedigree exception. The butler is testifying about the wealthy man's statement that the woman is his daughter. Since that's a statement about family lineage, it could qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.

Therefore, the objection would be overruled because the testimony is admissible under the pedigree exception. Looking at the options, option I says exactly that.

Wait, but I should double-check. The butler's testimony about the affair is common knowledge in the household. Is that hearsay? It might be, but perhaps it's being offered for a different purpose, like to show the woman's mother had access. But the main issue is the statement that the man said the woman was his daughter.

So the butler's testimony about what the man said is hearsay, but it's admissible under the pedigree exception. So the court would overrule the objection, making option I the correct answer.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the butler's testimony regarding statements made by the wealthy man about the woman being his daughter. The butler's testimony constitutes hearsay because it involves an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Privileged communication does not apply because there is no confidential relationship between the butler and the wealthy man that would create privilege.
- **Option B**: While relevance is important, the issue here is whether the testimony is admissible under hearsay rules, not just relevance.
- **Option C**: The testimony is not mere gossip; it is a direct statement from the wealthy man to the butler.
- **Option D**: The testimony is hearsay, but the question is whether an exception applies.
- **Option E**: Statement against interest does not fit because the wealthy man's statement does not appear to be against his own interest.
- **Option F**: The medical diagnosis exception is irrelevant here.
- **Option G**: Attorney-client privilege does not apply because the butler is not an attorney.
- **Option H**: Dying declaration requires the declarant to believe they are about to die, which is not indicated.
- **Option I**: The pedigree exception applies because the statement concerns family lineage (the woman being the wealthy man's daughter), which is admissible under this exception.
- **Option J**: The Dead Man's Statute does not apply because it typically prevents a party from testifying about a conversation with a deceased person, not a third party like the butler.

The butler's testimony about the wealthy man's statement that the woman is his daughter falls under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule. Therefore, the court would overrule the objection.

**Answer: I**
