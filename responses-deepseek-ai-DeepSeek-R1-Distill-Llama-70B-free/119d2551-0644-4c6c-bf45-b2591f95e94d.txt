Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: I need to find an integer n, where n is at least 1, such that the expression n times 2^(n+1) plus 1 is a perfect square. The options given are A through J, corresponding to numbers 1 to 10, but not in order. 

Hmm, okay. So I need to compute n * 2^(n+1) +1 for each n and check if the result is a perfect square. That sounds straightforward, but maybe there's a smarter way than just plugging in all the numbers. Let me think.

First, let's understand the expression: n * 2^(n+1) +1. Let's rewrite that as n*2^(n+1) = k^2 - 1, where k is some integer. So, k^2 = n*2^(n+1) + 1. Rearranging, that gives k^2 -1 = n*2^(n+1). 

Wait, k squared minus one factors into (k-1)(k+1). So, (k-1)(k+1) = n * 2^(n+1). 

Now, since 2^(n+1) is a power of two, and n is an integer ≥1, perhaps I can analyze the factors here. The product (k-1)(k+1) must be equal to n multiplied by a power of two. Also, since k-1 and k+1 are two consecutive even numbers (because they're two apart, so if k is even, then both are even; if k is odd, both are even as well), they are coprime except for a factor of 2. Wait, no, let's think: if k is even, then k-1 and k+1 are both odd, right? Because even minus one is odd, even plus one is odd. So if k is even, then both factors are odd. If k is odd, then k-1 and k+1 are even, so both factors are even. 

Wait, that's an important point. Let me clarify: 

If k is even: then k = 2m for some integer m. So k-1 = 2m-1 (odd), and k+1=2m+1 (odd). So their product is (2m-1)(2m+1) = 4m² -1. 

If k is odd: then k = 2m+1. So k-1=2m (even), k+1=2m+2=2(m+1) (also even). So their product is 2m*(2m+2) = 4m(m+1). 

In our case, the product (k-1)(k+1) = n * 2^{n+1}. Let's consider the cases when k is even and when k is odd.

Case 1: k is even. Then as above, (k-1)(k+1)=4m² -1. So 4m² -1 = n * 2^{n+1}. 

But 4m² is even, so 4m² -1 is odd. The right side is n*2^{n+1}, which is even because 2^{n+1} is even when n≥1. So the right side is even, left side is odd. That's a contradiction. So this case can't happen. Therefore, k must be odd.

Case 2: k is odd. Then as above, (k-1)(k+1)=4m(m+1). So 4m(m+1) = n * 2^{n+1}.

Wait, 4m(m+1) is 4 times m(m+1). Since m and m+1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even. So m(m+1) is even, so 4m(m+1) is 8 times something. So 4m(m+1) = 8 * [m(m+1)/2] = 8 * (some integer). 

But according to the equation, 4m(m+1) = n * 2^{n+1}.

So 8 divides the left side because 4m(m+1) is 8 * something. Therefore, n * 2^{n+1} must be divisible by 8, which implies that 2^{n+1} must be at least 2^3=8. So n+1 ≥3 → n≥2.

So possible n starts at 2 and up. Let's look at the options, which include n=1,2,3,...10. But the problem says n≥1, so n=1 is allowed. Let's check n=1 separately.

Wait, for n=1: 1 * 2^{2} +1 = 4 +1=5. 5 is not a perfect square, so n=1 (option E) is not a solution.

So back to when n≥2. Now, 4m(m+1) =n * 2^{n+1} → Let me divide both sides by 4: m(m+1) = n * 2^{n-1}.

So m(m+1) = n * 2^{n-1}.

Now, m and m+1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, each must be a multiple of a power of 2 and the other factors. Since their product is n * 2^{n-1}, and they are coprime, one of them must be equal to a * 2^{n-1}, and the other must be equal to b, where a*b =n, and a and b are coprime.

Wait, let me think again: because m and m+1 are coprime, and their product is n * 2^{n-1}, which is a product of a power of two and n. So the factors m and m+1 must each be powers of two times some factors of n. But since n could have factors beyond 2, perhaps we can consider that one of m or m+1 is a multiple of a higher power of two than the other.

Alternatively, considering that m and m+1 are consecutive, one is even and the other is odd. So the even one must be the multiple of 2^{n-1}, because the right side is n * 2^{n-1}.

Wait, let's see: since m and m+1 are consecutive, one is even and the other is odd. So in the product m(m+1) = n * 2^{n-1}, the even one must contribute all the factors of 2. Because the other factor is odd and can't contribute any 2s.

So, assuming without loss of generality that m is even, then m = 2^{n-1} * k, and m+1 = l, where k*l =n, and l is odd.

Alternatively, m could be the odd one, and m+1 the even one. Let me clarify:

If m is even, then m+1 is odd. So m = 2^{n-1} * a, and m+1 = b, where a*b =n, and a and b are coprime because m and m+1 are consecutive and thus coprime.

But m+1 = b = (2^{n-1} *a ) +1. Alternatively, if m is odd, then m+1 is even, so m+1 = 2^{n-1} *a, and m = b, so b = (2^{n-1} *a) -1. Then a*b =n.

So perhaps it's easier to model both scenarios.

Let me try to proceed with the first case where m is even, so m = 2^{n-1} * a, and m+1 = b, which is odd. Then, the product m*(m+1) = 2^{n-1} a * b = n * 2^{n-1}. So a*b =n.

Also, since m+1 = b = m +1 = 2^{n-1} a +1.

So, substituting, we have b = 2^{n-1} a +1, and a*b =n.

So, substituting b into the second equation, a*(2^{n-1} a +1) =n.

That's a quadratic in a: a² 2^{n-1} + a -n =0.

Hmm, solving for a would give a = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8 n 2^{n-1})]/(2^{n}).

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe trying small n values is better.

Wait, perhaps plugging in the options given would be more straightforward, given that the options are small integers from 1 to 10. Let's list the options and compute n * 2^{n+1} +1 for each. Then see if the result is a perfect square.

The options are:

A:5 → n=5

B:10 → n=10

C:8 →n=8

D:7 →n=7

E:1 →n=1

F:3 →n=3

G:2 →n=2

H:9 →n=9

I:4 →n=4

J:6 →n=6

So I'll compute for each n:

n=1: 1*2^(2)+1=4+1=5 → 5 is not a square.

n=2: 2*2^3 +1= 2*8+1=17 → 17 is not a square.

n=3:3*2^4 +1=3*16 +1=49 → 49 is 7². Oh wait, that's a square! So n=3 (option F) would be a solution. Hmm, but wait let's check others to see if there are more solutions.

n=4:4*2^5 +1=4*32 +1=128+1=129 → 129 is not a square (11²=121, 12²=144).

n=5:5*2^6 +1=5*64 +1=320+1=321 → Not a square (17²=289, 18²=324).

n=6:6*2^7 +1=6*128 +1=768+1=769 → 27²=729,28²=784 → not a square.

n=7:7*2^8 +1=7*256 +1=1792+1=1793 → 42²=1764,43²=1849 → nope.

n=8:8*2^9 +1=8*512+1=4096 +1=4097 → 64²=4096, so 4097 is 64² +1, not a square.

n=9:9*2^10 +1=9*1024 +1=9216 +1=9217 → 96²=9216, so 9217 is 96² +1, not a square.

n=10:10*2^11 +1=10*2048 +1=20480+1=20481 → let's see, 143²=20449, 144²=20736 → 20481 is in between, not a square.

Wait, so only n=3 gives a perfect square. So the correct answer should be F:3.

But wait, let me double-check n=3: 3 * 2^(4) +1 = 3*16 +1=48+1=49=7². Yep, that's correct.

So the answer is F.

To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \ge 1 \) such that \( n \cdot 2^{n+1} + 1 \) is a perfect square. The given options are \( n = 1, 2, 3, \dots, 10 \). 

### Approach:
1. For each \( n \), compute \( n \cdot 2^{n+1} + 1 \) and check if the result is a perfect square.
2. A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as \( k^2 \) for some integer \( k \).

### Calculations:
- **\( n = 1 \):** \( 1 \cdot 2^{2} + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 2 \):** \( 2 \cdot 2^{3} + 1 = 2 \cdot 8 + 1 = 17 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 3 \):** \( 3 \cdot 2^{4} + 1 = 3 \cdot 16 + 1 = 49 \). \( 49 = 7^2 \), which is a perfect square.
- **\( n = 4 \):** \( 4 \cdot 2^{5} + 1 = 4 \cdot 32 + 1 = 129 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 5 \):** \( 5 \cdot 2^{6} + 1 = 5 \cdot 64 + 1 = 321 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 6 \):** \( 6 \cdot 2^{7} + 1 = 6 \cdot 128 + 1 = 769 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 7 \):** \( 7 \cdot 2^{8} + 1 = 7 \cdot 256 + 1 = 1793 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 8 \):** \( 8 \cdot 2^{9} + 1 = 8 \cdot 512 + 1 = 4097 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 9 \):** \( 9 \cdot 2^{10} + 1 = 9 \cdot 1024 + 1 = 9217 \). Not a perfect square.
- **\( n = 10 \):** \( 10 \cdot 2^{11} + 1 = 10 \cdot 2048 + 1 = 20481 \). Not a perfect square.

### Conclusion:
From the calculations, only \( n = 3 \) results in a perfect square (\( 49 = 7^2 \)). Therefore, the correct answer is:

F
