Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about complex ion equilibria, which I think involves the dissociation of a copper-ammonia complex. The question has two parts, and I need to calculate the ratio of Cu²+ to the complex ion when NH3 is 1M, and then find the NH3 concentration needed for 50% conversion. 

Wait, the complex ion is Cu(NH3)²4+, right? I remember that the formation of such complexes is usually described by an equilibrium constant. Oh, right, the K_a here is given as 2e-13. Wait, K_a is usually the acid dissociation constant, but in this case, it's probably the dissociation constant for the complex. So the complex breaks down into Cu²+ and NH3.

Let me think about the first part. The ratio [Cu²+]/[Cu(NH3)²4+] in 1M NH3. Hmm.

The dissociation equation would be: Cu(NH3)²4+ ↔ Cu²+ + 4 NH3. Wait, no, wait. Actually, for a complex ion dissociation, each step might have its own K, but here they've given an overall K_a. So the reaction is the complex ion dissociating into Cu²+ and some NH3.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to write the formation of the complex. So the formation would be Cu²+ + 4 NH3 ↔ Cu(NH3)²4+. The formation constant Kf would be the reciprocal of K_a, I think. Because Kf is for formation, and K_a is for dissociation.

Wait, but the problem says K_a is 2e-13. So K_a is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the complex. So Kf would be 1/(2e-13), which is 5e12. But I'm not sure if I need that right now.

Wait, for part (1), the solution is 1 M in NH3. So we can assume that the concentration of NH3 is 1 M, and it's in large excess, so we can take it as constant. That would mean the concentration of NH3 doesn't change much, so the ratio can be calculated using the K_a.

So the dissociation is: Cu(NH3)²4+ ↔ Cu²+ + 4 NH3, but in solution, the NH3 is 1M. So the equilibrium expression is:

K_a = [Cu²+][NH3]^4 / [Cu(NH3)²4+]

Given K_a is 2e-13, and [NH3] is 1 M. So plugging that in:

2e-13 = [Cu²+][1]^4 / [Cu(NH3)²4+]

Which simplifies to [Cu²+]/[Cu(NH3)²4+] = 2e-13.

So the ratio is 2e-13. Wait, that's part (1) done. So the first part is 2e-13.

Now, part (2): the equilibrium concentration of NH3 needed to attain 50% conversion of Cu²+ to the complex.

Hmm. 50% conversion means that half of the Cu²+ has formed the complex. So let's think in terms of ICE table.

Let me denote the initial concentration of Cu²+ as, say, C. The initial complex is zero. Then, when some x amount reacts, the complex will form. But wait, at 50% conversion, the concentration of complex is x, and the remaining Cu²+ is C - x, but since it's 50%, that means x = (C - x), so 2x = C, so x = C/2.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model it with the equilibrium. Let me think about the total copper concentration. Let's say the total [Cu²+] + [Cu(NH3)²4+] = initial Cu²+ concentration, which let's call it C.

At 50% conversion, [Cu(NH3)²4+] = 0.5 C, and [Cu²+] = 0.5 C.

Then, the K_a expression is:

K_a = [Cu²+][NH3]^4 / [Cu(NH3)²4+]

Plugging in the values:

2e-13 = (0.5 C) [NH3]^4 / (0.5 C )

Oh wait, the C terms cancel out. So 2e-13 = [NH3]^4.

So [NH3] = (2e-13)^(1/4)

Wait, let me calculate that. 2e-13 is 2 times 10^-13.

The fourth root of 2 is approximately 1.189, and the fourth root of 10^-13 is 10^(-13/4) = 10^-3.25) which is about 5.62e-4.

So 1.189 * 5.62e-4 ≈ approximately 6.7e-4. Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 10^-3.25 is 10^(-3) * 10^(-0.25). 10^(-0.25) is about 0.5623. So 1e-3 * 0.5623 = 5.623e-4.

Then, multiply by 1.189 (fourth root of 2): 5.623e-4 * 1.189 ≈ 6.68e-4 M, which is 6.68e-4 M, or 6.7e-4. Wait, but looking at the options, the NH3 concentrations are in the 1e-2 to 1e-3 range.

Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, let's re-express. So the equilibrium concentrations are [Cu²+] = 0.5 C, [Cu(NH3)²4+] = 0.5 C, and [NH3] is what we're solving for.

Wait, but the reaction is the dissociation of the complex. So when the complex dissociates, it releases NH3. But wait, in this case, when we're forming the complex, we're starting with Cu²+ and NH3, right?

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem as the complex formation. Let me think again.

The formation of the complex is: Cu²+ + 4 NH3 ↔ Cu(NH3)²4+.

The formation constant Kf is 1/K_a = 1/(2e-13) = 5e12.

Wait, but we're at 50% conversion. So the initial concentration of Cu²+ is, say, C. Then, at equilibrium, half of it has formed the complex. So [Cu²+] = 0.5 C, [Cu(NH3)²4+] = 0.5 C.

The reaction consumes 4 moles of NH3 per mole of complex formed. So the NH3 concentration would decrease by 4*(0.5 C) = 2 C. But wait, if NH3 is in solution, its initial concentration is some value, let's say [NH3]_0. After reaction, it's [NH3]_0 - 4*(0.5 C) = [NH3]_0 - 2 C.

But wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it using the expression for the formation constant.

Kf = [Cu(NH3)²4+]/( [Cu²+][NH3]^4 )

We have Kf = 5e12.

At 50% conversion, the ratio [Cu(NH3)²4+]/[Cu²+] is 1, because they are equal. So Kf = (1) / ( [NH3]^4 )

So 5e12 = 1/[NH3]^4 → [NH3]^4 = 1/(5e12) → [NH3] = (1/(5e12))^(1/4)

Wait, let me compute that. (5e12)^(-1/4) = (5)^(-1/4) * (1e12)^(-1/4)

5^(-1/4) is approximately 1/(5^0.25). 5^0.5 is about 2.236, so 5^0.25 is sqrt(2.236) ≈ 1.495. So 1/1.495 ≈ 0.669.

(1e12)^(1/4) is 1e3, because (1e3)^4 is 1e12. So (1e12)^( -1/4 ) is 1e-3.

So [NH3] ≈ 0.669 * 1e-3 → approximately 6.69e-4 M. That's 6.7e-4 M, which is 0.00067 M, or 6.7e-4.

Wait, but looking at the options, the NH3 concentrations are mostly around 5e-3 or 6.7e-3, which is 0.0067 M, which is an order of magnitude higher than what I calculated here.

Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere. Let me check my approach again.

Wait, perhaps I confused K_a and Kf. Because the problem states that K_a is 2e-13, which is for the dissociation of the complex. So the correct Kf would be 1/(2e-13) = 5e12.

In the formation expression: Kf = [complex]/([Cu²+][NH3]^4 )

At 50% conversion, [complex] = [Cu²+] = 0.5 C.

So Kf = (0.5 C) / ( (0.5 C) [NH3]^4 ) ) → Kf = 1/[NH3]^4.

So 5e12 = 1/[NH3]^4 → [NH3]^4 = 1/(5e12) → [NH3] = (1/(5e12))^(1/4)

Hmm, that gives the same result as before. So [NH3] is about 6.7e-4 M, which is 0.00067 M.

Wait, but none of the options have that. Let me look at the options again.

Option F: [Cu²+]/[Cu(NH3)] = 2e-13, [NH3]=6.7e-3.

Option H: [Cu²+]/[Cu(NH3)] = 2e-13, [NH3]=8.7e-3.

Wait, but my calculation for part (2) gives [NH3]=~6.7e-4, which is 0.00067 M, but the options have 6.7e-3, which is ten times higher.

Wait, did I miscalculate the exponent? Let me redo the calculation.

Compute (5e12)^(-1/4) → which is 1/(5e12)^(1/4).

Wait, 5e12 is 5 x 1e12.

The fourth root of 1e12 is (1e12)^(1/4) = (1e3)^3)^(1/4) )= 1e^(3/4 * 12/4) ) Wait, perhaps another approach. 1e12 is (1e3)^4, because 1e3 is 10^3; (1e3)^4 = 1e12. So the fourth root of 1e12 is 1e3.

So (5e12)^(1/4) = (5)^(1/4) * (1e12)^(1/4) = 1.495 * 1e3 ≈ 1495.

So (5e12)^(1/4) is approximately 1495. Therefore, 1/(5e12)^(1/4) is 1/1495 ≈ 6.69e-4, which is 0.000669 M, or 6.69e-4 M.

Wait, that's 6.69e-4, which is 0.000669 M, but the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the 50% conversion refers to the complex being 50% dissociated, not 50% formed. Wait, the problem says "50% conversion of Cu²+ to Cu(NH3)²4+".

Hmm, that would mean that half of the Cu²+ is converted to the complex. So the concentration of complex is half of the initial Cu²+.

Let's model it again.

Initial: [Cu²+] = C; [complex] = 0.

At equilibrium: [Cu²+] = 0.5 C; [complex] = 0.5 C.

So in the formation reaction, for each mole of complex formed, 4 moles of NH3 are consumed.

So the change in NH3 is -4*(0.5 C) = -2 C.

So [NH3] = initial_NH3 - 2 C.

Wait, but I don't know the initial concentration of NH3. Unless perhaps the initial NH3 is in large excess, but in this problem, we're supposed to find the NH3 concentration at equilibrium for 50% conversion. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of NH3 is the same as the equilibrium concentration. Let me think about the expression again.

The formation constant Kf is [complex]/( [Cu²+][NH3]^4 )

At 50% conversion, [complex] = [Cu²+] = 0.5 C.

So Kf = (0.5 C) / ( (0.5 C) [NH3]^4 )

The C terms cancel, so Kf = 1/[NH3]^4.

So [NH3]^4 = 1/Kf = 1/(5e12) → [NH3] = (1/(5e12))^(1/4) ≈ 6.7e-4 M.

But none of the options have this. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the initial NH3 concentration. Because in part (2), we're to find the concentration of NH3 needed to achieve 50% conversion. So perhaps the solution isn't 1M NH3, but something else.

Looking back, in part (1), the solution is 1M NH3, but part (2) is asking for the equilibrium NH3 concentration needed to reach 50% conversion.

Wait, perhaps I should approach part (2) differently. Let's say the initial concentrations are [Cu²+] = C, [NH3] = x (what we're solving for), and [complex] = 0.

At equilibrium, [Cu²+] = 0.5 C, [complex] = 0.5 C, and [NH3] = x - 4*(0.5 C) = x - 2 C.

Wait, but without knowing C, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the solution assumes that the change in NH3 is negligible, but that might not be valid here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model it using the dissociation constant K_a, which is given.

Wait, the dissociation is Cu(NH3)²4+ ↔ Cu²+ + 4 NH3.

The K_a is 2e-13.

At 50% dissociation, [Cu(NH3)²4+] = [Cu²+] = 0.5 C.

But wait, no, because the problem is about the conversion of Cu²+ to the complex, so maybe it's the reverse situation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for 50% conversion, the concentration of the complex is equal to the concentration of the free Cu²+.

So, [complex] = [Cu²+] = 0.5 C_initial.

But then, using the K_a expression:

K_a = [Cu²+][NH3]^4 / [complex]

So 2e-13 = (0.5 C) [NH3]^4 / (0.5 C )

C cancels, so 2e-13 = [NH3]^4 → [NH3] = (2e-13)^(1/4)

Calculating that:

(2e-13)^(1/4) = (2)^(1/4) * (1e-13)^(1/4)

(2)^(1/4) is approximately 1.189.

(1e-13)^(1/4) is 1e-3.25 → as before, which is about 5.62e-4.

So 1.189 * 5.62e-4 ≈ 6.69e-4 M → 0.000669 M, which is 6.69e-4 M.

But looking at the options, the closest I see is option F, which has [NH3] =6.7e-3 M, which is ten times higher. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponent calculation.

Wait, wait, 1e-13's fourth root is 1e-3.25, which is 1e-3 * 1e-0.25 → 1e-3 * ~0.562 is 5.62e-4. Multiply by 1.189 gives 6.69e-4, which is 6.69e-4, or 0.000669 M.

But none of the options have this. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, perhaps the 50% conversion is not [Cu²+] being 50% of the initial, but that 50% of the complex has dissociated. Wait, no, the problem says "50% conversion of Cu²+ to Cu(NH3)²4+".

Hmm. Maybe the correct approach relates to the formation of the complex, and Kf.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the concentration of NH3 is not 1M in part (2), but varies, so part (1) is at 1M, and part (2) is the NH3 needed to get 50% conversion.

Wait, but the options give for part (1) a ratio of 2e-13, which matches what I calculated for part (1). So looking at the options, let's see.

Looking at the options, option F has [Cu²+]/[complex] =2e-13, which is what part (1) requires, and [NH3] =6.7e-3.

Wait, but in part (2), my calculation gave 6.7e-4, but option F is 6.7e-3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the Kf in part (2), not K_a.

Wait, another approach
