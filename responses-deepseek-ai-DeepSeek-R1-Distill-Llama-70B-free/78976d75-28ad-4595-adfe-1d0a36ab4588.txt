Alright, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Okay, there's a steel casting that's 34 kg, and it's at 427°C. It's being quenched in 136 kg of oil that's initially at 21°C. They say there's no heat loss, so all the heat from the steel goes into the oil. Both the steel and oil have constant specific heats: steel is 0.5024 kJ/kg-°K, and oil is 2.5121 kJ/kg-°K. I need to find the change in entropy for the system consisting of the oil and the casting. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, right. So entropy change, delta S, is calculated using the formula Q / T, but I remember that it's actually the integral of dQ over T, but in cases where the specific heat is constant and the temperature change isn't too drastic, we can approximate it as Q * average temperature or something. Wait, no, wait. Actually, for a process where the temperature changes, the entropy change is the mass times specific heat times the natural log of the final temperature over initial temperature. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Oh right, the formula for entropy change when there's a temperature change is ΔS = m * c * ln(T_final / T_initial), right? But wait, no, that's for a constant specific heat. But wait, actually, the correct formula is ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial) + m c (T_final - T_initial)/T_initial? No, no, wait another thing. The entropy change for a substance when it's heated or cooled is ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial) when the process is reversible and occurs at varying temperature. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me step back. Entropy change for heating or cooling is given by ΔS = ∫(dQ_rev)/T. For a process where the specific heat is constant, and the heat transfer is Q = m c (T_final - T_initial), the entropy change for a temperature change from T1 to T2 is ΔS = m c ln(T2 / T1) if it's a heating process, but wait, no, wait. Wait, when a substance is cooling, its entropy change would be negative, right? Because it's losing heat. And the other substance (the oil) is gaining heat, so its entropy increases.

Wait, but the system here is both the steel and the oil. So the total entropy change of the system is the sum of the entropy change of the steel and that of the oil.

So I think the correct approach is:

1. Calculate the heat lost by the steel (Q_steel) and the heat gained by the oil (Q_oil). Since it's a closed system with no heat loss, Q_steel = -Q_oil.

2. Find the final equilibrium temperature after they've exchanged heat.

3. Calculate the entropy change for the steel as it cools from T_steel_initial to T_final.

4. Calculate the entropy change for the oil as it warms from T_oil_initial to T_final.

5. Sum both entropy changes to get the total ΔS_system.

Wait, but to do that, I first need to find the final temperature. Because the heat lost by steel equals the heat gained by oil.

So let me write the equations.

Heat lost by steel: Q_steel = m_steel * c_steel * (T_final - T_steel_initial)

But since heat lost is negative, so Q_steel = m_steel * c_steel * (T_final - T_steel_initial). Wait, no. Wait, the formula for heat transfer when cooling is Q = m c (T_final - T_initial), but since the steel is losing heat, T_final will be less than T_initial, so Q_steel is negative. Similarly, the oil gains heat, so Q_oil is positive.

But, since the heat lost by steel is equal to the heat gained by oil (because no heat is lost to the surroundings), Q_steel = -Q_oil.

So:

m_steel * c_steel (T_final - T_steel_initial) + m_oil * c_oil (T_final - T_oil_initial) = 0

Wait, no. Because Q_steel is negative when the steel is losing heat. So:

m_steel * c_steel (T_steel_initial - T_final) = m_oil * c_oil (T_final - T_oil_initial)

Yes, that makes sense. Because the heat lost by steel (which is m c (T_initial - T_final) ) equals the heat gained by oil (m c (T_final - T_initial)).

So, plugging in the numbers:

m_steel = 34 kg
c_steel = 0.5024 kJ/kg·K
T_steel_initial = 427°C = 427 + 273.15 = 700.15 K
m_oil =136 kg
c_oil = 2.5121 kJ/kg·K
T_oil_initial =21°C = 294.15 K

So equation:

34 * 0.5024 * (700.15 - T_final) = 136 * 2.5121 * (T_final - 294.15)

Let me compute each side.

Left side: 34 * 0.5024 = let me calculate that. 34 * 0.5 is 17, 34 * 0.0024 is approx 0.0816. So total is approx 17.0816. So left side is 17.0816 * (700.15 - T_f)

Right side: 136 * 2.5121. Let me compute that. 136 * 2 is 272, 136 * 0.5121 is approx 136 * 0.5 =68, 136 *0.0121= approx 1.6456. So 272 +68=340 +1.6456=341.6456. So right side is 341.6456*(T_f -294.15)

So the equation is:

17.0816*(700.15 - T_f) = 341.6456*(T_f -294.15)

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: 17.0816 *700.15 = let's compute that.

700 *17.0816 = 11957.12, and 0.15 *17.0816≈2.56224. So total left side becomes 11957.12 + 2.56224 ≈11959.68224 -17.0816 T_f.

Right side: 341.6456*T_f - 341.6456*294.15.

Compute 341.6456 *294.15. Let me approximate this.

294 *341.6456 = let me see. 300*341.6456=102494.68, but minus 6*341.6456=2050.874, so 102494.68 -2050.874= 100443.806. Plus 0.15*341.6456≈51.2468. So total right side is 100443.806 +51.2468≈100,495.0528. So right side is 341.6456 T_f - 100,495.0528.

Putting it all together:

11959.68224 -17.0816 T_f = 341.6456 T_f -100,495.0528

Bring all terms to one side:

11959.68224 + 100,495.0528 = 341.6456 T_f +17.0816 T_f

Adding the left constants: 11959.68 +100495.05 = approx 112454.73.

On the right: (341.6456 +17.0816) T_f = 358.7272 T_f.

So:

112454.73 = 358.7272 T_f

T_f = 112454.73 / 358.7272 ≈ let me compute that.

Dividing 112454.73 / 358.7272.

Hmm, 358.7272 * 313 = let's see: 358 *313. 358*300=107,400, 358*13=4,654 → total 112,054. Close to 112,454. So 313 + (112454.73-112054.73)/358.7272 → 400/358.7272 ≈1.115. So T_f ≈314.115 K.

Wait, 358.7272 *314 = 358.7272*(300+14) = 107,418.16 + 5,020.181 ≈ 112,438.34. Which is close to 112,454.73. The difference is about 16.39. So 16.39 / 358.7272 ≈0.0457. So T_f≈314.115 +0.0457 ≈314.16 K.

Convert back to Celsius: 314.16 -273.15≈40.01°C.

Wait, so the final temperature is about 40°C. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recompute the equation:

From the initial equation:

34 *0.5024*(700.15 - T_f) =136 *2.5121*(T_f -294.15)

Compute left side:

34 *0.5024 = 17.0816.

Right side:

136 *2.5121 = let me compute precisely. 136 *2 =272, 136 *0.5121= 136*0.5=68, 136*(0.0121)=1.6456. So 68 +1.6456=69.6456. So 272 +69.6456=341.6456.

So equation is 17.0816 (700.15 - T_f) =341.6456 (T_f -294.15)

17.0816 *700.15 = let me compute accurately.

700.15 *17.0816 = let's compute:

700 *17.0816 =11,957.12

0.15 *17.0816=2.56224

Total=11,957.12 +2.56224=11,959.68224.

So 11,959.68224 -17.0816 T_f =341.6456 T_f - (341.6456 *294.15)

Compute 341.6456 *294.15:

Let me compute 341.6456 *294.15.

First, compute 341.6456 *200 =68,329.12.

341.6456 *94.15 = let's compute 341.6456 *90 =30,748.  0. Wait, no, 341.6456 *90=30,748.904, and 341.6456 *4.15= let's compute 341.6456 *4=1,366.5824 and 341.6456 *0.15=51.24684. So 1,366.5824 +51.24684=1,417.82924. So 90+4.15=94.15 gives 30,748.904 +1,417.82924=32,166.73324.

So 341.6456 *294.15=68,329.12 +32,166.73324=100,495.85324.

So equation becomes:

11,959.68224 -17.0816 T_f =341.6456 T_f -100,495.85324

Bring all terms to left side:

11,959.68224 +100,495.85324 = (341.6456 +17.0816) T_f

Sum the left side: 11,959.68224 +100,495.85324=112,455.53548.

On the right: (341.6456 +17.0816)=358.7272.

So 112,455.53548 =358.7272 T_f → T_f=112455.53548 /358.7272 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 358.7272 *313 = let's see: 358.7272 *300=107,618.16; 358.7272 *13=4,663.4536 → total 112,281.6136.

The target is 112,455.53548, which is 112,455.53548 -112,281.6136=173.92188 higher.

So how much is 358.7272 *x =173.92188 → x≈173.92188 /358.7272≈0.4846.

So T_f≈313 +0.4846=313.4846 K.

Wait, that's approximately 313.48 K, which is 40.33°C. Earlier I thought about 314.16 K, but this more precise calculation gives about 313.48 K, which is about 40.33°C.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I calculated 341.6456 *294.15, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me recompute that.

341.6456 *294.15: Let me break it down.

294.15 = 200 +94.15.

So 341.6456 *200 =68,329.12.

341.6456 *94.15 = ?

Wait, 341.6456 *94 = let's compute:

341.6456 *90 =30,748.904.

341.6456 *4 =1,366.5824.

So 90+4=94 → 30,748.904 +1,366.5824=32,115.4864.

Then, 341.6456 *0.15=51.24684.

So 32,115.4864 +51.24684=32,166.73324.

So 341.6456 *294.15=68,329.12 +32,166.73324=100,495.85324.

So that part was correct.

So equation: 11,959.68224 -17.0816 T_f =341.6456 T_f -100,495.85324.

Move all terms to left:

11,959.68224 +100,495.85324 = (341.6456 +17.0816) T_f → 112,455.53548 =358.7272 T_f.

So T_f=112,455.53548 /358.7272.

Let me compute this division.

112,455.53548 ÷ 358.7272.

Well, 358.7272 × 313 = 358.7272 ×300=107,618.16; 358.7272 ×13=4,663.4536. Total 107,618.16 +4,663.4536=112,281.6136.

So 358.7272 ×313=112,281.6136.

The target is 112,455.53548.

Difference: 112,455.53548 -112,281.6136=173.92188.

So 173.92188 /358.7272 ≈0.4846.

So T_f=313 +0.4846=313.4846 K.

313.4846 K is 313.4846 -273.15=40.3346°C.

So approximately 40.33°C.

Now, next step: calculate the entropy change for steel and oil.

Entropy change formula: ΔS = m c ln(T_final / T_initial).

But wait, for the steel, it's cooling, so T_final < T_initial. So its entropy change is negative. For the oil, it's heating, so T_final > T_initial, so entropy change is positive.

So for steel:

ΔS_steel = m_steel * c_steel * ln(T_final / T_initial)

Similarly, for oil:

ΔS_oil = m_oil * c_oil * ln(T_final / T_initial)

Wait, but wait. The temperatures must be in absolute (Kelvin) for the entropy calculation. Because entropy uses absolute temperatures.

Yes, that's correct. So we need to use T in Kelvin.

So let me compute each.

First, steel:

T_initial =700.15 K, T_final=313.4846 K.

So ln(313.4846 /700.15) → ln(0.4478) ≈-0.8045.

So ΔS_steel=34 kg *0.5024 kJ/kg·K * (-0.8045) → let's compute.

34 *0.5024=17.0816.

17.0816 * (-0.8045)= approx 17.0816 * (-0.8)= -13.6653, but let's compute accurately.

0.8045 =0.8 +0.0045.

17.0816 *0.8=13.66528.

17.0816 *0.0045=0.0766648.

So total is 13.66528 +0.0766648=13.7419448.

But with the negative sign, it's -13.7419448 kJ/°K.

Wait, wait, 34 *0.5024=17.0816, correct.

17.0816 * (-0.8045)= ?

Wait, 17.0816 * 0.8 =13.66528.

17.0816 * 0.0045=approx 0.07686.

So 0.8 +0.0045=0.8045 → 13.66528 +0.07686=13.74214. So 17.0816 * (-0.8045)= -13.74214.

So ΔS_steel≈-13.74 kJ/K.

Now, for the oil:

T_initial=294.15 K, T_final=313.4846 K.

So ln(313.4846 /294.15)= ln(1.0667)≈0.0647.

Let me compute it more accurately.

313.4846 /294.15 ≈1.0667.

Compute ln(1.0667): ln(1) is 0, ln(1.0667) is approximately 0.0645.

So ΔS_oil =136 kg *2.5121 kJ/kg·K *0.0645.

Compute 136 *2.5121= let's calculate that.

2.5121 *100=251.21, 2.5121 *36=90.4836 → 251.21 +90.4836=341.6936.

So 136 *2.5121=341.6936.

Multiply by
