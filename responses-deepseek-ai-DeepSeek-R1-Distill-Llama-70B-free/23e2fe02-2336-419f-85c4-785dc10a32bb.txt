Okay, let's tackle this multiple-choice question. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J, which in this case are options A through D since the options are given as A to D.

Let's look at Statement 1: "The back-propagation algorithm learns a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers." Wait, back-propagation is a common algorithm used for training neural networks, especially those with multiple layers. From what I remember, back-propagation uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function. But does it guarantee a globally optimal solution?

I think gradient descent can get stuck in local minima, especially in non-convex problems, which neural networks definitely are because they have multiple layers and non-linear activation functions. So back-propagation doesn't always find the global optimum. It might find a local minimum or even a saddle point. So Statement 1 is probably false.

Now, Statement 2: "The VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line." Hmm, the VC dimension (Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension) is a measure of the capacity of a statistical classification model. Specifically, it's the largest number of points that can be shattered by the model. For a line in two dimensions, I remember that the VC dimension is 3. 

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The VC dimension for a linear classifier in 2D is indeed 3. What does that mean? It means that any three points can be shattered, provided they are not colinear. Wait no, actually, for a line, if you have three points that are not colinear, a line can shatter them. Oh wait, no, wait. So the VC dimension is the maximum number of points that can be shattered. So a line can shatter up to 3 points. But can it always shatter any 3 points?

No, wait. No, because if you have three points that are colinear, a line can't shatter them into all possible labelings. Wait, no, if they're colinear, any line can separate them, but maybe not all possible dichotomies. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: the VC dimension for a line in 2D is 3. That means that for any set of 3 points in general position (no three on a line), a line can shatter them. But if I have three points that are colinear, then a line can't shatter them because for those three aligned points, you can't have all possible labelings. For example, if all three are on a straight line, you can't have a situation where the middle point is on one side and the two outer points are on the other. So in that case, the VC dimension is 3 because in general position, you can shatter any 3 points, but with colinear points, you can't. But the VC dimension considers the maximum possible, so it's 3.

Wait, but the statement says that the VC dimension is at most 2 because there's a case of 3 points that cannot be shattered. If the VC dimension is 3, that means that there exists at least one set of 3 points that can be shattered, but that doesn't mean all possible 3-point sets can be shattered. So the statement says that because there exists 3 points that can't be shattered, the VC is at most 2. But that's not correct because VC is about the maximum number that can be shattered, not the minimum. So the VC dimension being 3 means that any set of 3 points can be shattered if they're in the right position. So if someone says that because some 3 points can't be shattered, the VC is at most 2, that's incorrect because the VC is 3 regardless. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The VC dimension is the maximum number m such that there exists a set of m points that can be shattered. So if for m=3, there exists a set of 3 points that can be shattered, then the VC dimension is at least 3. But if for some 3 points, the line can't shatter them, that doesn't lower the VC dimension. Because the VC is about the existence of at least one set of m points that can be shattered. So even if some sets can't, as long as one set can, the VC is m. So for a line, the VC is 3, because you can arrange 3 points (not colinear) such that the line can shatter them. So Statement 2 claims that the VC is at most 2 because there exists a case where 3 points can't be shattered. But that's not correct because the VC is 3, so Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but the statement says "the VC dimension of a line should be at most 2, since I can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line." So if the VC was 3, that would mean that no, the statement is wrong. Because the VC being 3 means that some 3-point sets can be shattered, but others cannot. So the statement is using the existence of a non-shattered 3-point set to claim VC is at most 2, which is incorrect. Hence, Statement 2 is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is false (back-prop doesn't guarantee global optimum) and Statement 2 is false (VC of line is 3, not 2). So the options are A: False, False; B: True, True; C: False, True; D: True, False.

So the correct answer should be A: False, False.

Statement 1: The back-propagation algorithm does not guarantee a globally optimal neural network with hidden layers. This is because back-propagation uses gradient descent, which can get stuck in local minima or saddle points, especially in non-convex problems like training neural networks. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2: The VC dimension of a line is 3, meaning it can shatter any set of 3 points in general position (not colinear). While some specific sets of 3 points (e.g., colinear points) cannot be shattered, the VC dimension is defined as the maximum number of points that can be shattered, not the minimum. Thus, the claim that the VC dimension is at most 2 is incorrect. Therefore, Statement 2 is also false.

Both statements are false, so the correct answer is:

A: False, False

Answer: A
