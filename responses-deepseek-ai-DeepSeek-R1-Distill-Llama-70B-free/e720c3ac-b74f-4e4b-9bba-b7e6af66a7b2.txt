Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about chemical substances released by organisms that cause a physiological or behavioral response in others of the same species. Hmm, I remember from biology class that there are various types of chemical signals. Let's think about each option.

Option A: auxins. I think auxins are plant hormones, involved in growth, like making plants grow towards light. But they're within the plant, not between individuals, so probably not the answer.

Option B: neurotransmitters. These are chemicals that transmit signals across synapses in the nervous system. They're important for communication within an organism, especially in the brain and nervous system, but not between different organisms. So I don't think this is the right choice.

Option C: enzymes. Enzymes catalyze reactions, right? They speed up biochemical processes. But they don't act as signals between organisms. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: hormones. Hormones are internal signaling molecules, like insulin or adrenaline. They're produced by glands and affect other parts of the same organism. But the question is about substances released to affect others of the same species, so D might not be it, unless I'm mixing something up.

Option E: pheromones. Oh wait, pheromones! I remember that pheromones are chemicals released by an organism that affect the behavior or physiology of another organism of the same species. Like how certain smells attract mates, or mark territories. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing.

Option F: cytokines. These are involved in immune responses, helping cells communicate, but again, within the same organism. So F is probably not the answer.

Option G: antigens. Antigens are substances that trigger an immune response, like proteins on the surface of pathogens. Not related to signaling between organisms, so G is out.

Option H: proteins. Proteins have many functions, but as a general category, they don't specifically fit the description of signaling between organisms. Unless it's a specific type of protein, but the question is looking for a term that describes these substances.

Option I: antibodies. These are proteins produced by the immune system to fight pathogens. They don't act as signals between individuals, so I is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be E: pheromones. They are the chemicals that convey information between members of the same species, leading to specific responses.

The correct answer is E: pheromones. Pheromones are chemical substances released by organisms that elicit physiological or behavioral responses in other members of the same species, such as attracting mates or marking territories. 

Answer: E
