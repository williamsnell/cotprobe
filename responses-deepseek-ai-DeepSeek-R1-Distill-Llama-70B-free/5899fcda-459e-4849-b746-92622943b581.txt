Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem in front of me. It asks me to calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion for ethylbenzene, given that its standard enthalpy of formation is -12.5 kJ/mol. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, what's the standard enthalpy of combustion? Oh right, it's the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is completely burned in oxygen under standard conditions. So for ethylbenzene, the combustion reaction would produce CO2 and H2O, I think. 

The general formula for combustion is something like CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O. For ethylbenzene, the formula is C8H10. So the reaction should be C8H10(l) + something O2 → 8 CO2 + 5 H2O(l). Wait, but I need to balance the equation.

Let's write it out: C8H10 + O2 → 8 CO2 + 5 H2O. Now, let's balance the oxygen. On the product side, there are 8*2 = 16 O from CO2 and 5*1 =5 O from H2O, total 21 O. So the O2 on the reactant side should provide for that. Each O2 has 2 O atoms, so 21/2 = 10.5 O2 molecules. But we can't have half molecules, so multiply everything by 2 to eliminate the fraction.

So 2 C8H10 + 21 O2 → 16 CO2 + 10 H2O. Oh wait, but that's for two moles. Since we're calculating per mole, I can adjust. Alternatively, I can write it as C8H10 + (21/2) O2 → 8 CO2 + (5/2) H2O. Hmm, but maybe I should just keep it as 2 moles for the calculation and then adjust later.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of combustion is for one mole, so I should write the reaction for one mole. So:

C8H10(l) + (21/2) O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(l)

Now, to find the enthalpy change for this reaction. Enthalpy of combustion is calculated using the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is ΔH°comb = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants).

The reactants are C8H10 and O2. The ΔHf° of O2 is zero. So the reactant part is just ΔHf°(C8H10) multiplied by the moles used, which is 1 mole. So reactant part is 1*(-12.5 kJ/mol) = -12.5 kJ.

The products are CO2 and H2O. Their ΔHf° values are known. I remember that the standard enthalpy of formation for CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol, and for H2O(l) it's -285.8 kJ/mol. 

So for the products: 8 moles of CO2 contribute 8*(-393.5) = -3148 kJ. And 5 moles of H2O contribute 5*(-285.8) = -1429 kJ. So total products' contribution is -3148 -1429 = -4577 kJ.

Now, the ΔH°comb is products - reactants. So:

ΔH°comb = (-4577) - (-12.5) = -4577 +12.5 = -4564.5 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me check the exact values of the ΔHf° for CO2 and H2O. I'm pretty sure CO2 is -393.5, but sometimes different sources might have slightly different values. Oh wait, the question says to assume all data is at 298.15 K, so standard conditions. So I think I used the right numbers.

So my calculation gives approximately -4564.5 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, option A is -4564.7 kJ/mol. That's very close. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check the stoichiometry. The balanced equation for one mole is C8H10 + 21/2 O2 → 8 CO2 + 5 H2O. So the calculation I did is correct. So yes, the answer is A.

To calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion of ethylbenzene (C₈H₁₀), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{comb}} = \Sigma \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \Sigma \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

The combustion reaction for ethylbenzene is:

\[
\text{C}_8\text{H}_{10}(l) + \frac{21}{2} \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 8 \text{CO}_2(g) + 5 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
\]

### Step 1: Enthalpies of formation
- **Reactants**:
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{C}_8\text{H}_{10}) = -12.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{O}_2) = 0 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
  - Total for reactants: \(-12.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)

- **Products**:
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2) = -393.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
    - Contribution from 8 moles of CO₂: \(8 \times -393.5 = -3148 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
  - \(\Delta H_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}) = -285.8 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
    - Contribution from 5 moles of H₂O: \(5 \times -285.8 = -1429 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
  - Total for products: \(-3148 - 1429 = -4577 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)

### Step 2: Calculate \(\Delta H^\circ_{\text{comb}}\)
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{comb}} = \Sigma \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \Sigma \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{comb}} = -4577 - (-12.5) = -4577 + 12.5 = -4564.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \(-4564.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}\) is very close to option **A: -4564.7 kJ/mol**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A**
