Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about qualitative research and case studies. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement about case studies isn't correct. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is about case studies and identifying the incorrect statement. The options are A through I. I remember that case studies are a type of qualitative research, so they probably don't require large sample sizes because they focus on depth rather than breadth.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized. Wait, I thought case studies are often about specific cases and might not be generalizable. But sometimes they can provide insights that might apply elsewhere, but the assumption here is about generalization. I'm not sure, maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: Case studies do not rely on multiple sources of information. No, I think case studies often use multiple sources like interviews, documents, observations. So B might be incorrect because they do use multiple sources.

Option C: Always conducted over a short period. I think some case studies can be longitudinal, taking a long time. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Always require a large sample size. No, case studies usually involve a single case or a few cases, not large samples. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Only used in psychology. No, case studies are used in various fields like business, education, etc. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Detailed examination of a single case. That sounds correct. Case studies are in-depth analyses of a single case or a few cases.

Option G: Used for attitude measurement, etc. I think they can be, but they're more about understanding context and processes. Not sure if they're primarily for measurement.

Option H: Useful as a pilot study. Yes, I've heard that case studies can help identify variables for further research. So H is correct.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth understanding. That can't be right because case studies are all about in-depth analysis. So I is incorrect.

Wait, the question asks which statement can NOT be correct. So looking back:

The incorrect statements would be those that go against what case studies actually do.

Option B says they don't rely on multiple sources. But I think they do, so B is incorrect.

Option C says always short period. But some are long-term, so C is incorrect.

Option D: Large sample size is wrong because case studies usually have small samples, like one case.

Option E: Only psychology? No, used in many fields, so E is incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth understanding. That's wrong because case studies are meant for that, so I is incorrect.

So the question is which one cannot be correct. Let me look at each option again.

The question is about which is NOT correct about case studies.

So, the correct statements would be F, H, maybe G, etc. The incorrect statements are the ones that are wrong about case studies.

Looking at each option:

A: Can case studies be generalized? They sometimes aim for analytical generalization, not statistical. So A might be correct in some contexts.

B: They do rely on multiple sources, so B is incorrect.

C: They can take a long time, so C is incorrect.

D: They don't require large samples, so D is incorrect.

E: They're used in many fields, so E is incorrect.

F: Correct.

G: Maybe, but not their primary use. Not sure, but they can be used for that.

H: Correct.

I: Incorrect because they do provide in-depth understanding.

So the question is which option is NOT correct. So the incorrect ones are B, C, D, E, I.

The question is which of the options cannot be correct.

Looking back at the options, the question is about which statement can't be correct.

The question is in the context of qualitative research, where theory is developed from data, not before. So case studies fit here because they are used to build theory.

Which statement is incorrect about case studies.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says case studies always require a large sample size. That's definitely wrong because case studies usually involve a single case or a small number of cases. So D is incorrect.

Option C says they are always conducted over a short period. That's also incorrect because some case studies are longitudinal, taking years.

Option B says they don't use multiple sources. That's wrong because they do use multiple sources.

Option I says they don't provide in-depth understanding. That's wrong because that's their main purpose.

Option E is wrong because they're used in many fields.

So the question is about which is not correct. The options provided are A to I, and the possible incorrect statements are B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is asking which statement can NOT be correct. So which one is false about case studies.

Wait, the question says which cannot be correct. So for each option, is the statement correct or not.

Let me think again.

Option A: Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized. In qualitative research, generalization is often not the goal, but sometimes analytical generalization applies. So maybe A is incorrect because case studies don't assume statistical generalization.

Option B: They do not rely on multiple sources. No, they do. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Always short period. No, some take longer. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Always require large sample. No, case studies have small samples. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Only used in psychology. No, used elsewhere. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Correct.

Option G: Maybe true, but I'm unsure.

Option H: Correct.

Option I: Incorrect, as case studies provide depth.

So the question is which one is incorrect. Now, looking at the options, the question is about which cannot be correct.

So the answer options are the incorrect statements about case studies.

The question is multiple-choice, and I need to pick the one that cannot be correct.

Now, the options given as possible answers are A to I, but the question is which one is not correct.

I think the most clearly incorrect statements are D, B, C, E, I.

But the question is which one is not correct.

Wait, the question asks which statement cannot be correct. So which of the options is not a correct statement about case studies.

Let me think about each.

Option D: Case studies always require a large sample size. No, case studies typically focus on a single case or a small number of cases. So D is incorrect.

Option C: Always conducted over a short period. No, some are longitudinal. So C is incorrect.

Option B: Do not rely on multiple sources. No, they do. So B is incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth understanding. No, they do. So I is incorrect.

Option E: Only used in psychology. No, used in other fields. So E is incorrect.

Option A: Assumption of generalization. Not exactly, but sometimes. So A might be incorrect.

But the question is about which is not correct.

So looking for the option that is incorrect.

The question is about which one cannot be correct, so the wrong statements are possible.

Now, looking at the options, the question is about which cannot be correct.

Wait, the correct answer is the one that is not correct about case studies.

So the incorrect options are B, C, D, E, I.

Which of these is among the options given?

The options are A to I, so the incorrect ones are B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is to pick one.

So the question is which is not correct about case studies.

Now, looking at the options:

The correct statements would be F, H, maybe A, G.

The incorrect ones are B, C, D, E, I.

So the question is, which one is not correct.

But the original question is asking which statement cannot be correct.

So the possible answers are B, C, D, E, I.

But looking at the options, the question is about which cannot be correct.

Wait, the question is about which cannot be correct, meaning it's false.

So the incorrect options are B, C, D, E, I.

Which of these is among the options given?

The options are A to I, so the incorrect ones are B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is to pick one.

So the options are:

The answer options are A to J, but the choices are A to I.

Wait, the user said the options are A to I.

So, looking back, the question is which statement can NOT be correct.

So the incorrect statements are B, C, D, E, I.

But the possible correct answers are F, H.

So the question is, which of the options is NOT correct.

The possible options are B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is which one.

In the given options, the correct answer is likely D or E or I.

Wait, let's think about each.

Option D: Case studies always require a large sample size for accurate results. That's not true. Case studies focus on depth, so small samples are the norm. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Can only be used in psychology. No, they're used in business, education, etc. So E is incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth understanding. No, they do. So I is incorrect.

So all of D, E, I are incorrect.

But the question is which one cannot be correct.

Wait, the question is from the context of qualitative research, which is about developing theory from data, not beforehand. So case studies fit here.

So looking at the options, the incorrect statements are:

D: They require large samples. That's wrong.

E: Only in psychology. Wrong.

I: No in-depth. Wrong.

Now, the question is which one is incorrect.

But the question is which one cannot be correct.

So the options are:

A: Based on generalization. Maybe not always, but sometimes, so could be correct.

B: Do not use multiple sources. No, they do. So B is incorrect.

So, the statements that are incorrect are B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is to choose one option.

So the options are:

The question asks which statement can not be correct about case studies.

So, the answer would be one of the incorrect ones.

Looking at the options, the possible answers are B, C, D, E, I.

But the question provides options A to I, so we need to pick which one.

The correct answer is likely D or E or I.

Wait, the original question in the user's message.

The question is: which statement cannot be correct about case studies.

Looking at each option again:

Option D: Case studies always require a large sample size for accurate results. This is definitely incorrect because case studies often involve a single case or a small number of cases. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Case studies can only be used in the field of psychology. No, they're used in many fields like sociology, education, business. So E is incorrect.

Option I: Case studies do not provide in-depth understanding of a particular instance. No, that's the opposite. They do provide in-depth understanding. So I is incorrect.

So the incorrect options are D, E, I.

But the question is to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most incorrect statement.

Option D says they always require a large sample. That's a strong statement and definitely incorrect.

Option I is also incorrect because case studies are all about in-depth understanding.

So which one is more incorrect.

The question is which statement cannot be correct.

So all of D, E, I are incorrect, but the question is to pick one.

But the question gives us options A to I, and the correct answer is among them.

Wait, the original question is multiple-choice, and the options are A to I.

So, let's think about which one is the worst.

Option D: Always require a large sample. That's wrong because case studies usually have small samples.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth. That's the opposite of their purpose.

So both D and I are incorrect.

But the question is which cannot be correct.

Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Assume generalization - maybe correct sometimes.

B: Do not use multiple sources - incorrect.

C: Always short period - incorrect.

D: Always large sample - incorrect.

E: Only psychology - incorrect.

F: Detailed examination - correct.

G: Used for attitudes - maybe correct.

H: Useful as pilot - correct.

I: Do not provide in-depth - incorrect.

So the incorrect options are B, C, D, E, I.

The question is which can NOT be correct.

So, which of these is an incorrect statement.

But the question gives us options A to I, and the correct answer is among them.

But the question is to select the incorrect statement about case studies.

So, the options that are incorrect are B, C, D, E, I.

But the question is to choose one.

Wait, the possible answer is either D, E, or I.

But I think the most clearly incorrect statements are D and I.

The question says, which statement can not be correct.

So, let's look again.

Option D: Always require large sample. That's incorrect, case studies don't.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth. Incorrect.

So, which one is the answer.

Wait, the options are presented, and the answer is to select one.

In the context of the question, the correct answer is likely either D or I.

But looking at the options, the correct answer is likely D or E.

Wait, the question is phrased as: which one cannot be correct.

So, the most incorrect is perhaps D: always require a large sample.

Because case studies are about in-depth analysis of a single case, so they don't require a large sample. So D is incorrect.

Alternatively, option E is incorrect because case studies are used in various fields beyond psychology.

But the question is which one cannot be correct.

So all of D, E, I are incorrect, but I need to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But let me think again about the options.

Another approach: the question is about qualitative research, and case studies are a part of that.

In qualitative research, generalization is not usually the aim, but case studies can sometimes be used for analytical generalization. So A might be incorrect because it's based on the assumption of generalization, but I'm not sure.

Option B: They do not rely on multiple sources. That's incorrect because case studies do use multiple sources.

Option C: Always short period. Incorrect, as they can be longitudinal.

Option D: Always require large sample. No, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Only psychology. No, so E is incorrect.

Option I: Do not provide in-depth. No, so I is incorrect.

So the answer must be one of these.

But the question is which one cannot be correct.

So the answer is either B, C, D, E, or I.

But the options are A to I.

The correct answer is likely D, E, or I.

But perhaps the most incorrect is I because case studies are specifically meant to provide in-depth understanding.

So the statement that says they do not provide in-depth understanding is the opposite of the truth, making option I incorrect.

So, the answer is I.

Wait, option I says: "Case studies do not provide in-depth understanding of a particular instance."

Yes, that's incorrect.

So the answer is I.

To determine which statement about case studies cannot be correct, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "Case studies are based on the assumption that the case can be generalized."  
  This is partially correct in the context of analytical generalization, but not statistically. However, it is not entirely incorrect.

- **Option B**: "Case studies do not rely on multiple sources of information."  
  This is incorrect because case studies often use multiple sources, such as interviews, documents, and observations.

- **Option C**: "Case studies are always conducted over a short period of time."  
  This is incorrect because some case studies are longitudinal and can take a long time.

- **Option D**: "Case studies always require a large sample size for accurate results."  
  This is incorrect because case studies typically focus on a single case or a small number of cases, not large samples.

- **Option E**: "Case studies can only be used in the field of psychology."  
  This is incorrect because case studies are used in various fields, including business, education, and sociology.

- **Option F**: "Case studies are a detailed examination of a single case."  
  This is correct, as case studies are in-depth analyses of a single case or a few cases.

- **Option G**: "Case studies are used for attitude measurement, preferences, & satisfaction."  
  While they can be used for this, it is not their primary purpose. This statement is partially correct.

- **Option H**: "Case studies are most useful as a pilot study to identify variables that can be studied in other ways."  
  This is correct, as case studies are often used to explore variables for further research.

- **Option I**: "Case studies do not provide in-depth understanding of a particular instance."  
  This is incorrect because providing in-depth understanding is the primary purpose of case studies.

Among the incorrect statements (B, C, D, E, I), **Option I** stands out as particularly incorrect because it directly contradicts the fundamental purpose of case studies, which is to provide in-depth understanding. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I**
