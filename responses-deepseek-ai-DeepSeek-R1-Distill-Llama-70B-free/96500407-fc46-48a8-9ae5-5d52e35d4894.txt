Question:

When a monopolist has maximized profit,

Options:

A: any short-run profit will be eliminated through the long-run entry of new firms.
B: price is set equal to average total cost, creating positive economic profit.
C: output is set where price is equal to marginal revenue.
D: price is set above marginal cost, creating allocative inefficiency.
E: any short-run profit will be increased through the long-run exit of existing firms.
F: output is set where price is equal to average total cost.
G: output is set where price is less than average total cost.
H: price is set equal to average variable cost, creating zero economic profit.
I: price is set equal to marginal cost, creating zero economic profit.
J: price is set below marginal cost, creating economic inefficiency.

Okay, so I have this economics question about monopolists and their profit maximization. Hmm, I remember that monopolists are different from perfect competitors because they're the sole seller in the market. Right, so when a monopolist maximizes profit, what happens?

The question gives me options from A to J. I'll need to go through each one and see which fits. Let me think about what I know about monopoly profit maximization.

Monopolists maximize profit where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. I remember that MR=MC is the key point for profit maximization in any market structure, including monopoly. So that's the first thing to note.

Looking at the options:

Option C says output is set where price equals marginal revenue. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in a monopoly, MR is actually less than price because of the demand curve's slope. So MR is not equal to price. So C is incorrect.

Option F says output where price equals average total cost. That sounds more like a perfectly competitive market where firms make zero profit in the long run. Because in perfect competition, price equals ATC at the point where there's no economic profit. But a monopoly doesn't have that. So F is probably wrong.

Option I says price equals marginal cost, creating zero profit. No, wait, that's perfect competition again. In a monopoly, price is above marginal cost, which leads to allocative inefficiency. So I is incorrect.

Option D says price is above marginal cost, causing allocative inefficiency. That makes sense because monopolists don't produce at the socially optimal level. So D seems correct.

Option B: price equals ATC, positive profit. That would mean they're breaking even only when price equals ATC, but in monopoly, they can have profits. Wait, but in the short run, a monopolist might have profits, but in the long run, do new firms enter? No, because monopoly has barriers to entry. So B might not be correct.

Option A says any short-run profit is eliminated by new firms. No, because monopolists have barriers to entry. So A is probably wrong.

Option E: short-run profit increased due to exit. Doesn't seem right. Exit would happen if firms are making losses, but that's more in the short run for other markets, not monopoly.

Option G: price less than ATC. That would imply a loss, but if they're maximizing profit, they might not be in a loss. Unless it's the short run, but the question is about when they've maximized profit, so I think G isn't correct.

Option H: price equals AVC, zero profit. AVC is average variable cost. I'm not sure when that would happen. In the short run, a firm would shut down if price is below AVC. But in this case, the question is about maximizing profit, so H doesn't seem right.

Option J: price below MC, inefficiency. Wait, no, in monopoly, price is above MC, not below. So J is incorrect.

So going back, option D makes sense because in a monopoly, price is set above marginal cost, leading to allocative inefficiency. That's the correct choice.

When a monopolist maximizes profit, they set output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This results in a price that is above marginal cost, leading to allocative inefficiency. This is because monopolists, unlike firms in perfectly competitive markets, do not produce at the socially optimal level where price equals marginal cost. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, E, G, H, I, J**: These options are incorrect because they either describe scenarios inconsistent with monopoly profit maximization or confuse monopoly outcomes with those of perfect competition.  
- **B, C, F**: While these options touch on relevant concepts, they misapply them to the monopoly context. For example, price equaling average total cost (B and F) is characteristic of perfect competition, not monopoly.  
- **D**: Correctly identifies that in monopoly, price exceeds marginal cost, causing allocative inefficiency.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: price is set above marginal cost, creating allocative inefficiency.

Answer: D
