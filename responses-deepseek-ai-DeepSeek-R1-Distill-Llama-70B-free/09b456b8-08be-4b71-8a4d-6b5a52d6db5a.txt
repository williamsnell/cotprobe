Question:

A defendant, a nurse at a nursing home, is charged with murdering a resident at the home by adding an allegedly lethal substance to the resident's food. At trial, to prove that the substance added to the resident's food could result in death, the prosecutor, without first calling any witnesses, offers to read into evidence several pages from a standard medical treatise that support the prosecution's claim that the substance the defendant added to the food is lethal. Is the evidence offered admissible?

Options:

A: Yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent.
B: No, because the treatise must be confirmed by an expert in the field before being admissible.
C: Yes, because the treatise is a public document and therefore exempt from the hearsay rule.
D: No, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit.
E: Yes, because the prosecutor is allowed to introduce evidence without calling witnesses.
F: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.
G: Yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.
H: Yes, because the prosecution is merely providing evidence that supports their claim.
I: No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert.
J: No, because the substance's lethal nature is not relevant to the case.

Okay, so I have this evidence law question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a defendant, a nurse, who's charged with murder. The prosecutor wants to prove that the substance she added to the resident's food could cause death. They're offering several pages from a standard medical treatise without calling any witnesses. So the question is whether this evidence is admissible.

First, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the treatise is written by someone else, not the testifying witness, and it's being used to prove that the substance is lethal. That sounds like hearsay.

But wait, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is the learned treatise exception. I think under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(17), statements in a treatise can be admissible if they're called to the attention of an expert witness and they're relied upon by the expert during testimony. Or maybe it's that the treatise itself is admissible as an exhibit without an expert, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the rule says that a statement in a treatise can be read into evidence by the court or a party if it's established as reliable. But I think the usual procedure is that you have an expert on the stand who can testify that they rely on the treatise, and then you can read from it. Because without that, the treatise might just be hearsay without an exception.

In this case, the prosecutor is just offering to read the pages without calling any witnesses. So there's no expert to vouch for the treatise or to explain its contents. That seems problematic because the treatise is hearsay unless it falls under an exception.

So looking at the options:

Option A: It's about the defendant's state of mind. I don't think that's the issue here. The treatise is about the lethal nature, not the defendant's intent.

Option B: Says the treatise must be confirmed by an expert. That sounds correct because the learned treatise exception usually requires an expert to refer to it.

Option C: Treatise as a public document. No, public documents are a different exception, like government reports. A medical treatise is a private publication, so that's not it.

Option D: Must be introduced as an exhibit. I think the issue is more about it being hearsay, but maybe the form is not the problem. Not sure.

Option E: Prosecutor can introduce evidence without calling witnesses. Well, evidence can be introduced through documents, but hearsay still applies unless an exception.

Option F: Treatise excerpts are hearsay and no exception. That could be right if the exception isn't met.

Option G: Yes, under the learned treatise exception. But I thought the exception requires an expert to use it, so without a witness, it might not apply.

Option I: Excerpts not offered during expert's examination. That seems to align with what I was thinking earlier. The treatise must be used in conjunction with an expert's testimony.

Option J: Not relevant. No, the lethal nature is definitely relevant to the murder charge.

So putting it together: The treatise is hearsay. The only possible exception is the learned treatise exception, which requires that the treatise be introduced through an expert witness. Since the prosecutor isn't calling any witnesses, they can't use the exception. So the evidence should be inadmissible because it's hearsay without an applicable exception.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me check the exact rule. FRE 803(17) says that a statement in a treatise can be admissible if it's called to the attention of an expert witness upon cross-examination or relied upon by the expert, and it's established as reliable. But another part might allow the court to take judicial notice of the treatise? Or perhaps it's admissible as a public record? No, a medical treatise isn't a public record.

Alternatively, maybe it's admissible under the exception for scientific or technical texts if certain conditions are met, but I think that still requires some foundational testimony, possibly by an expert.

So without an expert, the prosecutor can't use the treatise. Therefore, the correct answer would be that it's inadmissible because it's hearsay without an exception, so the answer is F or I.

Looking at the options again:

Option F says it's hearsay and no exception applies. Option I says it wasn't offered during the expert's testimony.

Wait, the question is whether the prosecutor can read it without calling any witnesses. So if they're not calling an expert, then the treatise can't be admitted under the learned treatise exception because that requires the expert to be on the stand.

So the correct reasoning is that it's hearsay and doesn't qualify for an exception because there's no expert testimony. So the answer would be F.

But wait, option G says yes under the learned treatise exception. But without an expert, can the treatise still be admitted? I think not. So the correct answer is either F or I.

Wait, another point: There's another exception for factual findings in treatises. No, I think the learned treatise is the main one, and that requires expert testimony.

So in this scenario, since no witnesses are called, the treatise cannot be admitted. So the evidence is inadmissible because it's hearsay without an exception. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but looking at option I: "No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert." That also seems correct because the learned treatise exception requires that the excerpts be used in connection with an expert's testimony.

So the answer would be either F or I. But which one is more precise.

The question is whether the evidence is admissible. The prosecutor is offering it without any witnesses. So the treatise is hearsay. The only possible exception is the learned treatise, which requires that it be used by an expert during testimony. Since no expert is testifying, the exception doesn't apply, making the evidence inadmissible.

So the correct answer is F: No, because the treatise excerpts are considered hearsay and do not qualify for an exception.

Wait, but another thought: Some jurisdictions allow judicial notice of certain scientific facts, but that's different from a treatise. The court can take judicial notice of a fact, but not of the treatise itself unless it's established as reliable.

So I think F is the correct answer because without the expert, it's just hearsay.

The question revolves around the admissibility of excerpts from a medical treatise offered by the prosecutor to prove the lethal nature of a substance. The key issue is whether the treatise qualifies as admissible evidence under the rules of evidence, particularly in the absence of an expert witness.

The treatise is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the substance is lethal). Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies. One potential exception is the "learned treatise" exception under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(17), which allows statements from a treatise to be admissible if they are relied upon by an expert witness during testimony or are called to the attention of an expert witness.

In this case, the prosecutor is attempting to admit the treatise without calling any witnesses, including an expert. This is problematic because the learned treatise exception requires that the treatise be used in conjunction with an expert witness's testimony. Without an expert to vouch for the treatise's reliability or to explain its contents, the exception does not apply, and the treatise remains inadmissible as hearsay.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The relevance of the treatise to the defendant's state of mind is not the issue; the issue is the admissibility of the treatise as evidence.
- **B**: Incorrect. While expert confirmation is important, the specific requirement is that the treatise be used in conjunction with an expert's testimony, not merely "confirmed" by an expert.
- **C**: Incorrect. A medical treatise is not a public document; it is a private publication and does not fall under the public records exception.
- **D**: Incorrect. The issue is not whether the treatise must be introduced as an exhibit but whether it is admissible as evidence.
- **E**: Incorrect. While evidence can be introduced without witnesses in some cases, hearsay still applies unless an exception is available.
- **F**: Correct. The treatise excerpts are hearsay and do not qualify for an exception because there is no expert witness to invoke the learned treatise exception.
- **G**: Incorrect. The learned treatise exception requires an expert witness, which is absent in this case.
- **H**: Incorrect. The treatise is not admissible simply because it supports the prosecution's claim; it must still comply with the rules of evidence.
- **I**: Incorrect. While it is true that the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert, the more precise reason for inadmissibility is that the treatise is hearsay without an applicable exception.
- **J**: Incorrect. The lethal nature of the substance is highly relevant to the murder charge.

The correct answer is **F**, as the treatise excerpts are hearsay and do not qualify for an exception in the absence of an expert witness. 

Answer: F
