Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about marginal utility and how David Jones would allocate his $7 between two products, A and B. Both have the same price of $1 each. The marginal utilities are given by MU_A = 10 - x and MU_B = 21 - 2y, where x and y are the quantities of A and B, respectively.

Hmm, so I remember that when maximizing utility, a consumer should allocate their income in such a way that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal for both goods. Otherwise, they could get more utility by shifting money from one good to another.

Since both A and B have a price of $1, the marginal utility per dollar is just the marginal utility itself. So the idea is to find the quantities x and y where MU_A equals MU_B, and also make sure that the total expenditure (x + y) doesn't exceed the $7 budget.

Wait, but I think I should approach this step by step. Let me jot down the given information.

Price of A (P_A) = $1
Price of B (P_B) = $1
Budget (I) = $7

MU_A = 10 - x
MU_B = 21 - 2y

The consumer's goal is to maximize total utility, which means he should spend his money where he gets the highest marginal utility per dollar. Since the prices are the same, it's just comparing MU_A and MU_B.

So, to maximize, he should keep buying the good with higher MU until the MUs equalize.

Let me think about how to model this. The optimal condition is when MU_A / P_A = MU_B / P_B. Since P_A and P_B are both 1, it simplifies to MU_A = MU_B.

So setting 10 - x = 21 - 2y.

Let me rearrange that equation. 10 - x = 21 - 2y → Let's move variables to one side.

10 -21 = x - 2y → -11 = x - 2y → So, x = 2y -11.

Hmm, but x and y can't be negative, so I have to make sure that the values I get are non-negative.

Now, I also know that the total expenditure is x + y = 7, because each product costs $1 and he has $7. So, x = 7 - y.

Wait, but I have two equations here: x = 2y -11 and x = 7 - y. Let me substitute the second into the first.

So, 7 - y = 2y -11 → 7 +11 = 2y + y → 18 = 3y → y=6.

Wait, if y is 6, then x = 7 -6 =1. So x=1, y=6.

Let me check if that satisfies the MU equality. MU_A =10 -1=9. MU_B=21-2*6=21-12=9. Yes, they are equal.

So David would buy 1 unit of A and 6 units of B. Now, let me look at the options.

Option B says one unit of A and six units of B. So that's option B.

Wait, but let me double-check if this is indeed the optimal. Maybe I should compute the total utility for this choice and see if it's higher than other options.

Wait, the total utility isn't directly given, but the marginal utilities indicate the additional utility from each unit. To maximize, the highest possible MUs should be consumed first.

Let me think about how the MUs change as he buys more units.

For product A:
Each unit gives MU_A =10 - x. So the first unit gives 9, second 8, third 7, etc.

For product B:
Each unit gives MU_B =21 -2y. So first unit gives 19, second 17, third 15, fourth 13, fifth 11, sixth 9, seventh 7, etc.

Wait, so the marginal utilities for each product as he consumes more units would be:

A: 9 (x=1), 8 (x=2), 7 (x=3), etc.
B:19 (y=1), 17 (y=2), 15(y=3), 13(y=4), 11(y=5), 9(y=6), 7(y=7).

So the idea is to pick the highest available MU first, until the budget is exhausted.

Let me list the MUs in order from highest to lowest:

The highest is B's first unit (19), then B's second (17), B's third (15), B's fourth (13), B's fifth (11), then A's first (9), B's sixth (9), A's second (8), and so on.

Wait, so the consumer would prioritize B first because it starts with higher MUs.

So the order would be:

1. Buy B: y=1 (MU=19)
2. Buy B: y=2 (17)
3. Buy B: y=3 (15)
4. Buy B: y=4 (13)
5. Buy B: y=5 (11)
6. Now, between A's first unit (9) and B's sixth (9). Either one can be chosen next. But since they're equal, it doesn't matter which is picked first. Let's say he buys A first, x=1 (MU=9), then B: y=6 (MU=9).
7. Now, total spent so far is 6 units (5 B's and 1 A) which sums to 6. He has $1 left, so he can buy one more unit. The next highest available is B's seventh (MU=7) or A's second (8). So he should pick A's second, which gives higher MU (8 vs 7). Wait, but wait, after buying y=6, the next B would be y=7 (MU=7). The next A after x=1 is x=2, which gives 8.

So he has $7. Let me recount: y=6 (6 units of B) and x=1 (1 unit of A) sum to 7, which would cost 7*1=7. So that's exactly his budget.

Wait, but wait, if he buys 6 units of B and 1 of A, total units are 7, which is exactly $7. So the MUs at that point are both 9.

So that would be option B: 1 A and 6 B.

But let me think again. Because in the earlier approach, when I set MU_A = MU_B, I got the same result, so that's consistent.

Alternatively, another way to think is that at the optimal bundle, the marginal utilities per dollar equal. Since both are $1, MUA = MUB.

So with x=1, y=6, MUA=9, MUB=9. That's correct.

So the answer should be option B.

To determine how David Jones would allocate his $7 between products A and B, we use the concept of marginal utility and the principle that a consumer should equalize the marginal utility per dollar spent across goods to maximize utility. Since both products have a price of $1, the marginal utility per dollar is simply the marginal utility itself.

The marginal utility functions are given as:

- **MU_A = 10 - x** (for product A)
- **MU_B = 21 - 2y** (for product B)

The optimal condition is **MU_A = MU_B**, which simplifies to:

\[
10 - x = 21 - 2y
\]

Rearranging this equation gives:

\[
x = 2y - 11
\]

Additionally, the total expenditure constraint is:

\[
x + y = 7
\]

Substituting \(x = 7 - y\) into \(x = 2y - 11\), we solve for \(y\):

\[
7 - y = 2y - 11
\]

\[
18 = 3y \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 6
\]

Substituting \(y = 6\) into \(x = 7 - y\), we find:

\[
x = 1
\]

Thus, David would buy **1 unit of product A and 6 units of product B**. To verify, the marginal utilities at these quantities are:

- **MU_A = 10 - 1 = 9**
- **MU_B = 21 - 2(6) = 9**

Since the marginal utilities are equal, this bundle satisfies the optimal condition. The total expenditure is \(1 + 6 = 7\), which matches the budget.

From the given options, this corresponds to **Option B: one unit of product A and six units of product B**.
