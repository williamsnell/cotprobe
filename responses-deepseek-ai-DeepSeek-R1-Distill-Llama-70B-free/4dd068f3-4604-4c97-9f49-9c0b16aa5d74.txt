Okay, so I have this problem about two motors connected in concatenation driving a load. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, let's understand the problem. There are two 60-cycle motors connected in concatenation, which I think means they're connected in series or some kind of cascaded setup. One motor has six poles, the other eight. We need to find their combined speed when the slip is 0.075, and also the speeds each can drive the load alone under the same slip.

I remember that for induction motors, the speed depends on the number of poles and the frequency. The formula I recall is the synchronous speed, which is (120 * frequency) divided by the number of poles. But wait, since these are induction motors, the actual speed is less than synchronous due to slip.

So the formula for the actual speed should be: (synchronous speed) multiplied by (1 - slip). Or wait, wait, I think it's synchronous speed multiplied by (1 - slip). Because when slip is zero, the motor runs at synchronous speed, right? So slip is the difference between synchronous and actual speed, divided by synchronous speed. So actual speed N = (1 - s) * N_sync.

But wait, when motors are connected in concatenation, do their torques add up? Or perhaps their speeds are the same because they're driving the same load? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, in a cascaded or concatenated setup, maybe the motors share the same speed because they're driving the same load. So their individual slips must relate to that common speed.

Wait, another thought: when two motors are connected in concatenation, their secondary circuits are connected in such a way that the current flows through both. So the equivalent circuit would have the rotor resistances and reactances added. But I'm not sure how that affects the overall speed.

Alternatively, maybe the way to approach it is to find the equivalent number of poles for the combined motor setup. But I'm not sure about that. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to model each motor's speed and then see how they interact.

Let me think again. Each motor has a slip s. The problem states that the slip is 0.075. Wait, the slip is given as 0.075 for the combination, but part (a) is about the combination, and part (b) is when each is operated separately, same slip. So for (a), the two motors together have a slip of 0.075, and we need to find their combined speed.

Wait, but each motor has a different number of poles. So their individual synchronous speeds would be different. How does that work when connected together? Oh, because they're connected in concatenation, perhaps their speeds must be the same. So the overall speed is determined by some kind of combination of their characteristics.

Wait, maybe the way to approach this is to model the equivalent circuit of the concatenated motors. When motors are connected in concatenation, their rotor circuits are effectively in series. So the total resistance would be the sum of each motor's rotor resistance, and same with reactance. But without knowing the actual values of resistance and reactance, I'm not sure how to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of the combination depends on the harmonic mean or some function of their individual speeds. Hmm... I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe a different approach. Let's think about each motor's individual synchronous speed first.

For motor 1 with 6 poles: N_sync1 = (120 * 60) / 6 = 1200 rpm.

For motor 2 with 8 poles: N_sync2 = (120 * 60) /8 = 900 rpm.

Wait, but when connected in concatenation, their speeds would be the same. So the actual speed would have to be such that each motor's slip corresponds to that speed.

Wait, slip s is defined as (N_sync - N) / N_sync. So for motor 1, s1 = (1200 - N) / 1200. For motor 2, s2 = (900 - N)/900.

But since they're connected in concatenation, perhaps the currents are the same, leading to the same torque. Wait, but torque in an induction motor is related to slip. Hmm, maybe the torques add up. Alternatively, perhaps the total torque is the sum of each motor's torque.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about it differently.

In a concatenated connection, the rotor currents of the two motors are the same. So the equivalent resistance and reactance in the rotor circuit are the sum of each motor's rotor parameters.

So if motor 1 has rotor resistance R1 and reactance X1, and motor 2 R2 and X2, the equivalent R would be R1 + R2, and equivalent X would be X1 + X2.

The slip for the combined motor would be determined by the equivalent R/X ratio. But without knowing R and X, I'm not sure how to calculate the slip. Wait, but in this problem, the slip is given as 0.075. So perhaps I can find the actual speed based on the equivalent synchronous speed.

Wait, but each motor has a different synchronous speed. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe when two motors are connected in concatenation, their effective number of poles is the sum of the individual poles. Because the fluxes add up, perhaps. So total poles would be 6 + 8 = 14 poles. Then the synchronous speed would be (120 * 60) / 14 ≈ 514.28 rpm. But applying the slip of 0.075, the actual speed would be 514.28 * (1 - 0.075) = 514.28 * 0.925 ≈ 476 rpm. But looking at the options, none of the first numbers are around 476. Hmm.

Wait, maybe that approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the effective number of poles is the least common multiple or something else. Or perhaps the equivalent is the harmonic mean. Like, 2/(1/6 + 1/8) ) = 2/(7/24) ) = 48/7 ≈ 6.857 poles. Then synchronous speed would be 120*60/(48/7) = (7200 *7)/48 = 1050 rpm. Then with slip 0.075, the actual speed is 1050 * 0.925 = 971.25 rpm. But that's not matching any of the options either. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe when connected in concatenation, each motor's torque contributes, but the speed is determined by the load. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is such that the sum of their slips relates to the overall slip.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall slip is determined by the sum of the individual slips, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea. The speed of the combination is when both motors are running at the same speed, so each has a different slip. But wait, the problem says that the slip is 0.075. Maybe the overall slip is 0.075 for each motor, but that can't be because their synchronous speeds are different.

Wait, let me think: for the combination, the slip is given as 0.075. So the actual speed would be N = N_sync * (1 - s). But each motor has a different N_sync. So this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the way to model it is that the two motors are connected in such a way that their effective synchronous speed is somewhere between 900 and 1200 rpm. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the combined system's synchronous speed is determined by the average of the two. But that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's the product or something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the motor with more poles (8) has a lower synchronous speed, so when connected in concatenation, the overall speed is lower than 900 rpm. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the slip equations for each motor and solve for the speed.

Each motor's slip is s = (N_sync - N)/N_sync

So for motor 1: s1 = (1200 - N)/1200

Motor 2: s2 = (900 - N)/900

But when connected in concatenation, how are s1 and s2 related? I'm not sure. Perhaps the torques add up, but torque is proportional to slip in some way.

Wait, the torque developed by an induction motor is proportional to (R2 * s)/(R2^2 + (sX)^2) or something like that. But without knowing the exact parameters, it's hard to model.

Alternatively, maybe when connected in concatenation, the slip of each motor is the same. Because perhaps the same slip applies to both, but that's only possible if the speed is the same for both, but their N_sync are different, which would imply different slips. Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the slip given (0.075) is the overall slip for the combination, so the actual speed is determined by one of the motor's synchronous speeds and the given slip. But that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is the same for both, but each has their own slip, which we can calculate. But the problem says the slip is 0.075, so maybe that's the slip for each motor. No, that wouldn't make sense because their synchronous speeds are different.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to think about part (a) first: the speed of the combination when the slip is 0.075.

But I'm stuck on how to calculate that speed. Maybe I'm missing a key concept here. Wait, perhaps when two motors are connected in concatenation, their effective number of poles is the sum of the poles. So 6 + 8 = 14 poles. Then the synchronous speed would be (120 * 60) /14 = 6000/14 ≈ 428.57 rpm. Then with a slip of 0.075, the actual speed would be 428.57 * (1 - 0.075) ≈ 428.57 * 0.925 ≈ 397 rpm. But none of the options are close to that, so probably that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective number of poles is the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 8, which is 24 poles. Then N_sync = 120*60/24 = 300 rpm. Actual speed would be 300 * 0.925 = 277.5, which is even further off. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the individual speeds when each motor is driving the load alone, which is part (b). Then, perhaps the options will give me a clue.

For part (b), each motor is operated separately, same slip of 0.075.

So for motor 1 (6 poles): N1 = (1 - s) * (120*60/6) = 0.925 * 1200 = 1110 rpm.

For motor 2 (8 poles): N2 = 0.925 * (120*60/8) = 0.925 * 900 = 832.5 rpm.

So when each motor is operated alone, their speeds are 1110 rpm and 832.5 rpm. Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H: 475, 1110, 832 (Close to 832.5)

Option B: 485, 1105, 845

Option H's individual speeds are 1110 and 832, which aligns with my calculation. So for part (b), the speeds would be 1110 and 832.5, which would match part (b) in option H as 1110 and 832.

So part (b) of the problem gives two speeds, which in option H are 1110 and 832.

But the question also asks for the combined speed in part (a). So what is the combined speed when they are connected together with a slip of 0.075.

Wait, so when connected together, perhaps the equivalent number of poles is different, or the effective slip is a combination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The combined system's synchronous speed is determined by the two motors' characteristics. But without more data, perhaps the speed is the average of the two individual synchronous speeds.

Wait, motor 1 has N_sync1 = 1200 rpm, motor 2 N_sync2 = 900 rpm. The average would be 1050 rpm. Then applying slip 0.075, the actual speed would be 1050 * 0.925 = 971.25 rpm. But none of the options have this value for (a).

Alternatively, perhaps the combined system's synchronous speed is the harmonic mean of the two. The harmonic mean of 1200 and 900 is 2/(1/1200 + 1/900) = 2/( (900 + 1200)/(1200*900) )) = 2 * (1200*900)/(2100) ) = 2 * (1080000/2100) ) → 2 * 514.28 ≈ 1028.57 rpm. Then actual speed is 1028.57 * 0.925 ≈ 951 rpm. Still not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe the combined speed is the product of the two individual speeds divided by the sum, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps it's the minimum of the two speeds? But that would be 900 rpm, which when multiplied by 0.925 gives 832.5, which is the speed of motor 2 alone. But in option H, the combined speed is 475, which is much lower.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the concatenated connection results in a lower speed, but how?

Wait, perhaps the slip for each motor is 0.075. So for motor 1, with N_sync = 1200, actual speed N = 1200*(1 - 0.075) = 1110 rpm.

For motor 2, N = 900*(0.925) = 832.5 rpm.

But if they're connected in concatenation, their speeds must be the same, which would only be possible if 1110 equals 832.5, which they don't. So that can't be right. Therefore, the assumption that each motor has the same slip might not hold when connected together.

Alternatively, perhaps the slip for each motor is different when connected in concatenation, but the overall system has a slip of 0.075.

Wait, but in the problem statement, part (a) says if the slip is 0.075, so perhaps that refers to the overall slip, and each motor's slip contributes to that.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, part (a) is the combined speed, and part (b) includes the two individual speeds. From part (b), I can see that in option H, the speeds are 1110 and 832, which match my calculations for each motor when operated alone with slip 0.075.

So option H's part (b) is correct. So the answer for part (a) would be the first number, which is 475 rpm.

But how do I get 475 rpm for the combined speed?

Wait, perhaps when connected in concatenation, the effective number of poles is 6 + 8 =14, so N_sync = 120*60/14 ≈ 514.28 rpm. Then with slip 0.075, N = 514.28 * 0.925 ≈ 476 rpm. Close to 475, which is option H's first value.

So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the equivalent number of poles as the sum when connected in concatenation, leading to N_sync = 514.28 rpm, then applying the slip of 0.075 gives approximately 476 rpm, which rounds to 475 as in option H.

So for part (a), the speed is approximately 475 rpm, and for part (b), the individual speeds are 1110 and 832 rpm.

Looking back at the options, option H is: 475, 1110, 832.

So the answer should be option H.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the two motors connected in concatenation and their individual operation. Here's the breakdown:

### Part (a): Speed of the combination with a slip of 0.075
1. When motors are connected in concatenation, their effective number of poles is the sum of their individual poles:  
   \[
   \text{Total poles} = 6 + 8 = 14
   \]
2. The synchronous speed of the combined system is calculated as:  
   \[
   N_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot 60}{14} \approx 514.29 \, \text{rpm}
   \]
3. With a slip of \( s = 0.075 \), the actual speed is:  
   \[
   N = N_{\text{sync}} \cdot (1 - s) = 514.29 \cdot (1 - 0.075) \approx 514.29 \cdot 0.925 \approx 476 \, \text{rpm}
   \]
   This rounds to approximately **475 rpm**, which matches the first value in option H.

### Part (b): Speeds when each motor is operated separately
1. For motor 1 (6 poles):  
   \[
   N_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot 60}{6} = 1200 \, \text{rpm}
   \]
   With \( s = 0.075 \), the actual speed is:  
   \[
   N = 1200 \cdot (1 - 0.075) = 1200 \cdot 0.925 = 1110 \, \text{rpm}
   \]

2. For motor 2 (8 poles):  
   \[
   N_{\text{sync}} = \frac{120 \cdot 60}{8} = 900 \, \text{rpm}
   \]
   With \( s = 0.075 \), the actual speed is:  
   \[
   N = 900 \cdot (1 - 0.075) = 900 \cdot 0.925 = 832.5 \, \text{rpm}
   \]
   This rounds to approximately **832 rpm**, which matches the third value in option H.

### Final Answer
The combined speed is approximately **475 rpm**, and the individual speeds are **1110 rpm** and **832 rpm**. These values correspond to option H.

**Answer: H**
