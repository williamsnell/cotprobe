Question:

A deed executed by a grantor conveyed his property for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, "to my brother for life, then to the heirs of my brother. " A life interest in the property for the life of the brother is worth $20,000 on the date of the conveyance. The total worth of the property is $50,000. The brother accepted but didn't record the deed. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. "Four years later, the grantor purported to convey his property in fee simple absolute to his two sons, by a warranty deed, as a gift. The two sons recorded the deed. Shortly thereafter, the brother ascertained that the grantor's sons were about to take possession of the property. As a consequence, the brother promptly recorded his deed. In a dispute between the brother and the grantor's children as to the ownership of the property, if the brother prevails it will be because

Okay, so I've got this legal question about property conveyances and recording statutes. Hmm, I need to figure out why the brother would prevail in a dispute with the grantor's children. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the scenario: A grantor conveys property to his brother for life, then to the brother's heirs. The consideration is $1, which was acknowledged. So, the brother has a life estate, and the remainder would go to his heirs. The life estate is worth $20k, and the whole property is worth $50k. 

The brother accepted the deed but didn't record it. The recording statute says that if an instrument isn't recorded, it's void as against subsequent purchasers who pay value and have no notice. So, four years later, the grantor tries to convey the same property to his two sons by a warranty deed as a gift. The sons recorded their deed. Then the brother found out the sons were about to take possession, so he promptly recorded his deed.

The question is, why would the brother win if he prevails? The options are A through J.

Let me think about the recording statute. It's a notice or a race-notice type? The wording is "void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice." So, it's protecting subsequent purchasers for value without notice. If someone buys without notice and pays value, they're protected over a prior unrecorded deed.

In this case, the grantor's sons took the property as a gift. So, they didn't pay value. The statute requires payment of value, so if the sons didn't pay anything, they might not qualify as "purchasers" under the statute. 

Wait, but the sons recorded their deed. But the brother's deed was unrecorded until he recorded it after the sons. But the key is that the sons took as a gift, so no value. So, even though they recorded, they might not be protected because they didn't pay value.

So, when the brother records his deed, his interest would be protected against the sons because the sons didn't pay value. The recording statute only voids unrecorded instruments against subsequent purchasers who pay value without notice. Since the sons took by gift, they're not purchasers for value. Therefore, the brother's prior unrecorded deed would still be valid against them, even if he recorded later.

Looking at the options: Option D says the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute. That makes sense because they didn't pay value. So, the brother's deed, even though recorded late, would still be valid against them.

Option H says the brother's deed wasn't void because of the statute. Wait, but the statute says it's void as against subsequent purchasers for value without notice. Since the sons didn't pay value, the brother's deed isn't void as to them. So H might also be a contender.

Wait, but D says the sons aren't protected by the statute. Because the statute protects subsequent purchasers who pay value. The sons didn't pay, so they don't qualify. So, the brother's interest is still valid, and the sons can't take priority.

So, the reason the brother prevails is that the sons aren't protected by the recording statute because they didn't pay value. So, the correct answer would be D.

Another option: A says the brother paid consideration. He paid $1, which is nominal, but still consideration. But the recording statute's protection is for subsequent purchasers for value without notice. So, if the brother's deed wasn't recorded, and the sons were subsequent purchasers without notice, but if they didn't pay value, they're not protected. So A might not be the main reason.

Option F says the brother had a life interest. Well, that's true, but the issue is about the recording statute and priority. So F is a fact, but not the reason for the brother's victory in this dispute.

So, I'm leaning towards D being the correct answer.

The question revolves around a property dispute between a brother and the grantor's children, focusing on the recording statute and its implications. The brother received a life estate worth $20,000 through a deed that was not initially recorded. The grantor later conveyed the property to his sons as a gift, and the sons recorded their deed. The brother then recorded his deed upon learning of the sons' intent to take possession. The recording statute in the jurisdiction states that unrecorded instruments are void as against subsequent purchasers who pay value and have no notice.

Key analysis:

1. **Recording Statute Requirements**: The statute protects subsequent purchasers who pay value and have no notice. The sons, however, received the property as a gift, meaning they did not pay value. Therefore, they do not qualify as "purchasers" under the statute, and the brother's unrecorded deed remains valid against them.

2. **Brother's Prevailing Reason**: The brother prevails because the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute. Since the sons did not pay value, they do not meet the statutory requirements for protection, even though they recorded their deed after the brother's unrecorded deed.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option D**: Correct. The sons are not protected by the recording statute because they did not pay value, which is a requirement for protection under the statute.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. While the brother's deed was not void, the reason for his prevailing is specifically tied to the sons' lack of protection under the statute due to their failure to pay value.
   - Other options, such as A, F, and others, address related facts but do not directly explain why the brother prevails in this dispute.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**, as the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute because they did not pay value.

Answer: D
