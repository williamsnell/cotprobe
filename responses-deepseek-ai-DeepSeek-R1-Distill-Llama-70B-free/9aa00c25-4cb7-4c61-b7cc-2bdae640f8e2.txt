Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the molecular formula of a gas based on the molecular weight and the percentage composition of carbon and hydrogen.

Alright, the molecular weight is given as 58. The compound contains 82.8% carbon and 17.2% hydrogen. My goal is to find out the molecular formula from the options provided.

First, I remember that the molecular formula can be determined by using the percentages of each element. The usual approach is to assume we have 100 grams of the compound because percentages will then directly translate to grams. So, if I have 100 grams of this compound, there would be 82.8 grams of carbon and 17.2 grams of hydrogen.

Next step is to convert these masses into moles. To do that, I need the atomic weights of carbon and hydrogen. Carbon's atomic weight is approximately 12 g/mol, and hydrogen is about 1 g/mol.

Let me calculate moles for each. For carbon: 82.8 g divided by 12 g/mol. Let me do that division. 82.8 divided by 12 equals... let's see, 12 times 6 is 72, so 82.8-72 is 10.8. 10.8 divided by 12 is 0.9. So total is 6.9 moles of carbon.

For hydrogen: 17.2 g divided by 1 g/mol is 17.2 moles. Oh wait, that's right because each mole of hydrogen is 1 gram.

Now, I need to find the ratio of carbon to hydrogen atoms. So I'll take the moles and divide each by the smallest number of moles to get a simple whole number ratio.

Here, the smallest is 6.9 moles (carbon). So I divide each by 6.9.

Carbon: 6.9 /6.9 =1.
Hydrogen: 17.2 /6.9 ≈ 2.5.

Wait, 2.5 isn't a whole number. That’s a problem because the number of atoms should be whole numbers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecular weight. The molecular weight is 58 g/mol. So, the sum of the atomic weights in the formula should add up to 58.

Let me think differently. Let’s denote the molecular formula as C_xH_y. Then, the molecular weight would be 12x + y = 58.

Also, the percentage composition gives us another equation. The percent carbon is (12x)/(12x + y) *100 =82.8. Similarly for hydrogen: (y)/(12x + y)*100=17.2.

So, let's set up the equations.

From carbon:
12x / (12x + y) = 82.8 /100
12x / (12x + y) =0.828.

Similarly, hydrogen:
y / (12x + y) = 0.172.

Since both denominators are the same, maybe I can set up ratios. Let me see.

Let me denote the total molecular weight as M=58. So, 12x + y=58.

From the carbon percentage:
12x = 0.828 * M
M is 58, so 12x = 0.828 *58.

Calculating that: 58 *0.828. Let me compute.

58 *0.8 is 46.4. 58 *0.028 is approximately 1.624. So total is 46.4 +1.624 = 48.024. So 12x =48.024 → x=48.024/12=4.0018, approximately 4.

So x is about 4. Then, from 12x + y=58, y=58-12*4=58-48=10.

So the formula would be C4H10. Let me check the options. Option G is C4H10.

Wait, but another approach is to use the moles. Let me go back there for confirmation.

We had 6.9 moles of C and 17.2 moles of H. So the ratio is 6.9 :17.2. Let me divide both by 6.9 to get the simplest ratio. That gives 1 : (17.2/6.9) → 1:2.5.

Hmm, 2.5 isn't a whole number, so perhaps I should multiply both by 2 to get rid of the decimal. That would make the ratio 2:5. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1:2.5 is the same as 2:5 when multiplied by 2. So the ratio would be C2H5. But wait, that would make the formula C2H5, which is option F. But earlier calculation suggested C4H10, which is option G. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole calculation. Let me redo that.

The mass percentages: 82.8% C and 17.2% H. So in 100g, 82.8g C and 17.2g H.

Moles of C: 82.8 /12 = 6.9. Correct.
Moles of H:17.2 /1=17.2. Correct.

So the mole ratio is 6.9 :17.2 → divide both by 6.9.

6.9/6.9=1. 17.2/6.9=2.5. So ratio is 1:2.5 → multiply both by 2 to eliminate the decimal. So 2:5.

Which would make the formula C2H5. But wait, that's not possible because 2*12 +5*1=24+5=29. But the molecular weight is 58. That's half of 58. So perhaps the actual formula is (C2H5)2 → C4H10. That makes sense. Because 4*12 +10=48+10=58.

So yes, the formula is C4H10. So the correct option is G.

Let me check the options again. Option G is C4H10, which matches.

Another way to approach this is using the mass percentages to find the empirical formula and then determining the molecular formula.

The empirical formula is CH2.5, but since we can't have half atoms, we multiply by 2 to get C2H5 as the empirical formula. Then, the molecular weight of the empirical formula is (2*12)+(5*1)=24+5=29 g/mol.

The molecular weight of the compound is 58, which is twice 29. So the molecular formula is (C2H5)2 → C4H10.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option G.
</think>

To determine the molecular formula of the compound, we start with the given data: the molecular weight is 58 g/mol, and the compound contains 82.8% carbon (C) and 17.2% hydrogen (H) by mass. 

### Step 1: Convert percentages to masses
Assume 100 g of the compound. Then:
- Mass of carbon = 82.8 g
- Mass of hydrogen = 17.2 g

### Step 2: Convert masses to moles
Using the atomic weights of carbon (12 g/mol) and hydrogen (1 g/mol):
- Moles of carbon = \( \frac{82.8}{12} = 6.9 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of hydrogen = \( \frac{17.2}{1} = 17.2 \, \text{mol} \)

### Step 3: Determine the mole ratio
The mole ratio of carbon to hydrogen is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Moles of carbon}}{\text{Moles of hydrogen}} = \frac{6.9}{17.2} \approx 1 : 2.5
\]
To eliminate the decimal, multiply both sides by 2:
\[
\text{Ratio} = 2 : 5
\]
Thus, the empirical formula is \( \text{C}_2\text{H}_5 \).

### Step 4: Relate the empirical formula to the molecular formula
The molecular weight of the empirical formula \( \text{C}_2\text{H}_5 \) is:
\[
(2 \times 12) + (5 \times 1) = 24 + 5 = 29 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
The molecular weight of the compound is 58 g/mol, which is twice the molecular weight of the empirical formula. Therefore, the molecular formula is:
\[
(\text{C}_2\text{H}_5)_2 = \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10}
\]

### Step 5: Verify the molecular formula
The molecular weight of \( \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} \) is:
\[
(4 \times 12) + (10 \times 1) = 48 + 10 = 58 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
This matches the given molecular weight, confirming the molecular formula is \( \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} \).

### Final Answer:
The molecular formula of the compound is \( \text{C}_4\text{H}_{10} \), which corresponds to **Option G**.
