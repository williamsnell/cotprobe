Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the stock market and its effect on the consumption function and aggregate demand. Hmm, I remember that the stock market can influence consumer behavior. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question is asking what happens when the stock market strengthens. I think a stronger stock market means that people's wealth increases. Because when stock prices go up, the value of people's investments and savings goes up. That makes sense. So, when people feel wealthier, they're more likely to spend money, right? I remember something about the wealth effect.

The consumption function refers to how much households spend based on their income and other factors, including wealth. So if the stock market is up, people have more wealth, which should make the consumption function increase. Because even if their income doesn't change, their wealth does, and that makes them more confident to spend. So the consumption function would shift upwards.

Now, aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for goods and services in the economy. It's influenced by consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. So if consumption goes up because people are spending more, that should increase aggregate demand. So both the consumption function and AD would increase.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are pairs for consumption function and aggregate demand. So we're looking for both to increase.

Option B is Increase, Increase. That seems right. Let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with anything else. Oh wait, sometimes interest rates can affect investment, but here the question is about the stock market, not interest rates. So it's the wealth effect, not the interest rate effect. So yes, consumption up, AD up.

Wait, any other possibilities? Could a stronger stock market affect investment too? Oh, right, businesses might invest more if the stock market is up because it's easier to raise funds. But the question specifically asks about the consumption function and aggregate demand. So the consumption function is about household spending, which increases due to wealth. Aggregate demand includes all components, so if consumption is up, AD is up. So B makes sense.

A stronger stock market increases household wealth, which leads to higher consumer spending through the wealth effect. This causes the consumption function to shift upward. Since aggregate demand includes consumption as a key component, an increase in consumption also leads to an increase in aggregate demand. Therefore, both the consumption function and aggregate demand increase.

The correct answer is **B: Increase, Increase**.
