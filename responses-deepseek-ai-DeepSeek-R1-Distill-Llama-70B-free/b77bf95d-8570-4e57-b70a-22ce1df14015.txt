They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China…
When we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand…In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]…"

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question based on the provided passage from Ibn Battuta's Voyages. Let me read through the passage carefully and then analyze the question and options.

The passage describes Ibn Battuta's observations in China during the 14th century. He mentions that the Chinese are infidels, worship images, and burn their dead like Hindus. The King of China is a Tartar, a descendant of Genghis Khan, which suggests that the Mongols were ruling China at that time, probably the Yuan dynasty. 

He talks about Muslims having their own towns with cells, colleges, and mosques, and being favored by the Chinese kings. When approaching Hangzhou, they were met by the judge, elders of Islam, and merchants. There were many Muslims there. The city is walled with six districts: the first has guards with 12,000 men, the second has Jews, Christians, and Turks who worship the sun, and this area is very beautiful with wealthy elites. Ibn Battuta stayed with some Muslims and was treated honorably.

So, from this, it seems that China under Mongol rule was quite diverse, with various religious groups present. The Muslims, Jews, and Christians each had their own areas within the city, indicating some level of organization and perhaps tolerance, as they were allowed to have their own spaces and religious institutions.

Now, the question is asking which conclusion about the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage. The options are A through J.

Looking at the options:

A: Tech hindered by religious beliefs. The passage doesn't talk about technology, so probably not A.

B: Tech spread via trade routes. Not directly addressed here; the passage is more about religious groups and their presence.

C: Steppe nomad empires united trade links. The Mongols (steppe nomads) did create a vast empire that facilitated trade across Eurasia. Ibn Battuta traveled extensively, and the presence of various religious groups in China suggests connections across regions, so this could be a possibility.

D: Religious tolerance not practiced. But the passage shows that different religions have their own areas and are treated well, which suggests some tolerance. So D might be incorrect.

E: New religions overturned old ones. The passage indicates coexistence rather than replacement, so E might not fit.

F: China isolated. No, the passage shows lots of external influence and presence of various groups, so F is wrong.

G: Trade within civilizations, not between. The presence of merchants and various religious groups from different places suggests trade between civilizations, so G is incorrect.

H: Islam spread through military. The passage doesn't mention military conquest in China, just that Muslims are present and respected, so H might not be the best choice.

I: China was primarily Jewish and Christian. No, the passage says the Chinese are infidels (probably meaning non-Muslim), and that Muslims, Jews, and Christians are present, but the majority isn't stated as Jewish or Christian. So I is wrong.

J: Long-distance contact stagnated. No, because Ibn Battuta's travels and the presence of diverse groups indicate active contact, so J is incorrect.

So the options left are C and possibly B. But the passage doesn't discuss technology, so B is less likely. C talks about steppe nomads uniting trade links, which fits because the Mongols were steppe nomads and their empire facilitated trade across Eurasia, allowing people like Ibn Battuta to travel and for various religious groups to be present in China.

The passage from Ibn Battuta's Voyages highlights the diversity and religious coexistence in China under Mongol rule, with Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others present. It also underscores the connectivity and trade across Eurasia facilitated by the Mongol Empire. Among the options, the conclusion that best fits is that steppe nomad empires, like the Mongols, united trade links across Eurasia.

Answer: C
