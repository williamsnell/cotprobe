Okay, so I've got this problem here about Florence Parrish's earnings. Let me try to understand it step by step. So, she earns a semi-monthly salary of $160. Hmm, semi-monthly means she gets paid twice a month, right? Like, every two weeks. So that's twice a month. So for the whole month, her salary would be 160 multiplied by 2, because there are two pay periods in a month.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, the problem says she earns a semi-monthly salary of $160. So semi-monthly means she gets $160 every two weeks. So in one month, which is about four weeks, she would get paid twice. So her monthly salary would be 160 times 2. So 160 * 2 is 320. So her base salary for the month is $320.

Then, she also gets a commission of 1% of her monthly sales. Oh, right, so she sold $3,680 worth of goods in January. So her commission is 1% of that amount. Let me calculate that. 1% of 3,680. So 0.01 multiplied by 3,680. Let me do that math. 3,680 times 0.01 is 36.8. So her commission is $36.80.

So her total earnings for the month would be her salary plus the commission. So the base salary is $320 plus $36.80 from commission. Let's add those together. 320 + 36.8 equals 356.8. So her total earnings are $356.80.

Now I need to look at the options provided. Let me check each option. 

Option A: 380.80. That's higher than what I calculated. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, maybe I misunderstood the semi-monthly part. So semi-monthly means she's paid twice a month, so each payment is $160. So for the month, that's two payments of 160, which is 320. So that part is correct.

Commission: 1% of 3,680 is indeed 36.80. So 320 + 36.8 is 356.8. So the correct total is $356.80.

Looking back at the options, let's see. Option G is $356.80. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure none of the other options are close. Option I is $376.80, which is higher by 20. Option D is 360.80, which is 4 more than my calculation. Hmm, no, I think 356.8 is correct.
