Question:

The members of a bird species capable of nesting in treetops or on the ledges of nearby cliffs make their homes only in the treetops due to the established presence of a more aggressive bird species on the cliff ledges. With respect to habitat, the treetop-nesting birds are utilizing

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about bird species and their habitats. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ecology terms, but let me think through this.

The question says that there are birds that can nest in treetops or on cliff ledges. But they're only using the treetops because there's a more aggressive bird on the cliffs. So, the treetop is their current habitat.

I remember that in ecology, the terms "fundamental niche" and "realized niche" are important. The fundamental niche is the full range of environmental conditions and resources that a species can potentially use. It's like the ideal situation without any competition or predators. The realized niche, on the other hand, is the actual conditions and resources the species uses, considering factors like competition and predators. So it's narrower than the fundamental niche.

In this case, the birds can potentially nest in two places: treetops and cliffs. But because another aggressive bird is on the cliffs, they don't use that area. So their potential (fundamental) niche includes both, but their realized niche is only the treetops.

Wait, but the question is about habitat utilization. So are they using their fundamental niche or the realized? Since they can't use the cliffs, their actual use is only the treetops, which must be their realized niche.

So the options are looking for which niche they are utilizing. The options are:

A: potential only. No, because they're not using the cliffs. So it's not just potential.

B: ecological niche only. I think ecological niche is another term for realized niche. So maybe.

E: realistic niche only. That sounds right. Because they're only using what they can, considering competition.

Wait, but let me think again. Fundamental niche is the maximum they could use without constraints. Realized is what they actually use. So the birds here are using their realized niche, which is only the treetops.

Looking at the options:

Option E says "their realistic niche only". So the answer should be E.

Alternatively, is there another way to look at it? Do they still have the fundamental niche as their potential, but their realized is just part of it. So the question asks what they are utilizing. They are utilizing their realized niche, which is treetops.

Yes, so the correct answer is E.

The question involves understanding the ecological niches of bird species. The fundamental niche represents the full potential range of environmental conditions and resources a species can use, while the realized niche is the actual conditions and resources used, considering factors like competition and predation. In this scenario, the birds can potentially nest in both treetops and cliff ledges (fundamental niche) but are restricted to treetops due to competition from a more aggressive species. Thus, they are utilizing their realized niche, which is limited to the treetops.

Option E, "their realistic niche only," correctly reflects the birds' current habitat utilization.

Answer: E
