Okay, so I have this question about skewness in a dataset. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The data given is the waist measurements of six chocolate rabbits: 3 inches, 2 inches, 3.7 inches, 5 inches, 2.7 inches, 3 inches. I need to determine the relative measure of skewness for this data.

Wait, what's skewness again? Oh right, skewness is a measure of asymmetry in the distribution of data. A positive skew means the tail is on the right side, so the data is spread out towards higher values. Negative skew is the opposite, with the tail on the left. If skewness is zero, the data is symmetric, like a normal distribution.

So first, I should probably arrange the data in order to get a better sense. Let me list them sorted: 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. Wait, no, wait. Let me count again. Oh wait, the numbers are 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5. So ordered correctly, it's 2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5 inches.

Now, to find the mean, median, and mode. Because skewness is related to how these measures compare. If the mean is greater than the median, it's positively skewed. If less, negatively skewed.

Calculating the mean: sum all the data and divide by the number of observations. Let's add them up: 2 + 2.7 is 4.7, plus 3 is 7.7, another 3 is 10.7, plus 3.7 is 14.4, plus 5 is 19.4. So total is 19.4 inches. There are 6 data points, so mean is 19.4 /6. Let me compute that. 19.4 divided by 6: 6*3=18, so 19.4-18=1.4, so 3 and 1.4/6 â‰ˆ 3.2333 inches.

Median is the middle value. Since there are 6 data points, it's the average of the 3rd and 4th values. The sorted data is [2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7,5]. So 3rd is 3, 4th is 3. So median is (3+3)/2 = 3 inches.

Mode is the most frequent value. Looking at the data, 3 inches appears twice, others appear once. So mode is 3.

Now, mean is higher than median (3.233 >3). So according to what I remember, when mean > median, the distribution is positively skewed because the longer tail is on the right side. So the data is positively skewed.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. Another method I've heard about is the calculation using the formula for skewness. But maybe I don't need to calculate it exactly since the question is about relative measure, not the exact value.

Alternatively, looking at the data, the highest value is 5, which is an outlier compared to the others. The rest are clustered around 2-3.7, so the presence of 5 might pull the mean higher than the median. That would indicate positive skewness.

Wait, but what about the lower end? The smallest value is 2 inches, which is lower than the others, but I don't think it's as much of an outlier as 5. Let me see: The data points are 2, 2.7, 3,3,3.7,5. The distance from 2 to 2.7 is 0.7. From 3.7 to 5 is 1.3. So 5 is further away from the cluster than 2 is. So the tail is longer on the right side.

So that supports positive skewness.

Looking back at the options, option A says the distribution is positively skewed. Option C is negatively skewed, which would be if the mean was less than the median. But here mean is higher, so A seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Mean: 2+2.7=4.7, +3=7.7, +3=10.7, +3.7=14.4, +5=19.4. Divided by 6 is 3.2333. Median is 3. So yes, mean > median, so positive skew.

So the answer should be A.

To determine the relative measure of skewness for the given data, we analyze the waist measurements of six chocolate rabbits: 2 inches, 2.7 inches, 3 inches, 3 inches, 3.7 inches, and 5 inches. Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution, with positive skewness indicating a longer tail on the right side and negative skewness indicating a longer tail on the left side.

First, we calculate the mean, median, and mode of the data:

1. **Mean**: The sum of the data is \( 2 + 2.7 + 3 + 3 + 3.7 + 5 = 19.4 \). Dividing by the number of observations (6), the mean is \( \frac{19.4}{6} \approx 3.2333 \) inches.
2. **Median**: Sorting the data gives \( [2, 2.7, 3, 3, 3.7, 5] \). Since there are 6 data points, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values: \( \frac{3 + 3}{2} = 3 \) inches.
3. **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently is \( 3 \) inches (appearing twice).

The mean (\( \approx 3.2333 \)) is greater than the median (\( 3 \)), which suggests that the distribution is positively skewed. Additionally, the data point \( 5 \) inches is an outlier, pulling the mean higher than the median and creating a longer tail on the right side of the distribution.

Thus, the distribution is positively skewed.
