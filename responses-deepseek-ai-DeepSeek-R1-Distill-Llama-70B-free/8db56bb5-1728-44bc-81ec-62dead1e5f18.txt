Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a boy pumping up his bicycle tires on a day when the temperature is 300 K. The tire pressure needs to be 24.5 lb/in², and the air in the pump is compressed adiabatically. They give gamma for air as 1.40, and I need to find the temperature of the air in the pump after compression.

Hmm, I remember that adiabatic processes are ones where there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so the work done is at the expense of the internal energy. For such processes, there are specific equations that relate temperature and pressure changes. Oh right, the relation PV^γ = constant for an adiabatic process.

Wait, but I think there's another form of the equation that relates temperature and pressure directly. Let me think. Oh yeah, the formula is T1 * (P1)^((1-γ)/γ) = T2 * (P2)^((1-γ)/γ). Or was it T1^(γ) * P1^(1-γ) = T2^(γ) * P2^(1-γ)? I'm a bit confused about the exact form here.

Let me get that straight. The adiabatic condition can be written as TV^(γ-1) = constant. But since PV = nRT, I can express V in terms of P and T. Maybe it's easier to use the relation that combines T and P. Oh right, the relation is T^(γ) * P^(1-γ) = constant. Or wait, maybe it's T1^(γ) / P1^(γ-1) = T2^(γ) / P2^(γ-1). Yeah, that sounds right.

So the formula should be (T1)/(T2) = (P1/P2)^((γ-1)/γ). Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. If pressure increases, temperature should increase as well because when you compress a gas adiabatically, it heats up. So if P2 > P1, then T2 should be greater than T1.

Wait, in the problem, the pump is compressing the air, so the initial state is the ambient air, and the final state is the compressed air in the pump. So the initial pressure is the atmospheric pressure, and the final pressure is higher, 24.5 lb/in². But wait, I need to be careful with units here. Because normal atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 lb/in², right? So if the pump is bringing the pressure up to 24.5, that's higher than atmospheric.

But wait, what's the initial pressure here? Is the pump compressing the air from atmospheric pressure to 24.5 lb/in²? I think that's the case. So P1 is atmospheric pressure, say 14.7 lb/in², and P2 is 24.5 lb/in².

So the initial temperature T1 is 300 K, and we need to find T2 after compression.

Using the formula, T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ). 

Plugging in the numbers: gamma is 1.4, so (γ-1) is 0.4, and divided by γ gives 0.4/1.4 ≈ 0.2857.

So the exponent is approximately 0.2857. Then, P2 is 24.5 and P1 is 14.7. Let me compute the ratio: 24.5 /14.7 ≈ 1.6667.

Now, raise 1.6667 to the power of 0.2857. Let me calculate that. Let me think, 1.6667 is about 5/3, and 0.2857 is roughly 2/7. So (5/3)^(2/7). Hmm, not sure the exact value, but maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, using logarithms might help. Let me compute ln(1.6667) ≈ 0.5108. Multiply by 0.2857: 0.5108 * 0.2857 ≈ 0.1459. Then exponentiate: e^0.1459 ≈ 1.157. So the factor is about 1.157.

So T2 is 300 K multiplied by 1.157. That gives 300 * 1.157 = 347.1 K.

Looking at the options, option B is 347 K. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. Another way to write the adiabatic condition is T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ). Yes, that's correct. So the steps I took should be right.

Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately. Let me calculate 24.5 /14.7 more precisely. 14.7 times 1.666 is 24.5 (14.7 * 1.666 is 24.5, because 14.7 * 1.6 is 23.52, 14.7 * 0.066 is about 0.9702, so total is about 24.49). So the ratio is approximately 1.666666...

So (24.5 /14.7) = 5/3 exactly? Because 14.7 *5/3 is (14.7 *5)=73.5 /3=24.5. Oh, right, so 24.5/14.7 is exactly 5/3. So the ratio is 5/3.

So (5/3) raised to (0.4/1.4). 0.4/1.4 is 2/7, so (5/3)^(2/7).

Hmm, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let's compute (5/3)^(2/7). Taking natural logs again: ln(5/3) = ln(1.6667) ≈ 0.5108256. Multiply by 2/7: 0.5108256 * 2 =1.021651, divided by7 is≈0.145946. e^0.145946 ≈ 1.1575.

So the factor is approximately 1.1575, so T2 =300 *1.1575=347.25 K, which is about 347 K. So option B matches.

Wait, but is the initial pressure really atmospheric pressure? Because when you use a bicycle pump, the starting point is indeed atmospheric, and you're compressing it to a higher pressure. So yes, the setup is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be option B, 347 K.

To solve the problem, we use the adiabatic relation for an ideal gas, which connects temperature and pressure:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

Here:
- \(T_1 = 300 \, \text{K}\) (initial temperature),
- \(P_1 = 14.7 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) (atmospheric pressure),
- \(P_2 = 24.5 \, \text{lb/in}^2\) (final pressure),
- \(\gamma = 1.40\) (adiabatic index for air).

Rearranging for \(T_2\), we get:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
T_2 = 300 \cdot \left(\frac{24.5}{14.7}\right)^{\frac{1.40 - 1}{1.40}}
\]

First, calculate the pressure ratio:
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{24.5}{14.7} \approx 1.6667
\]

Next, compute the exponent:
\[
\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} = \frac{1.40 - 1}{1.40} = \frac{0.40}{1.40} \approx 0.2857
\]

Now, raise the pressure ratio to the power of the exponent:
\[
\left(1.6667\right)^{0.2857} \approx 1.157
\]

Finally, calculate \(T_2\):
\[
T_2 = 300 \cdot 1.157 \approx 347 \, \text{K}
\]

Thus, the temperature of the air in the bicycle pump after adiabatic compression is approximately **347 K**. The correct answer is:

**B: 347 K**
