Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about therapy types and the "miracle question." I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which type of therapy uses the "miracle question" as an initial intervention. The options are A through J, each representing a different therapeutic approach.

First, I remember that the miracle question is something I've heard in the context of a specific therapy. I think it's about imagining a scenario where a problem is solved. Like, "If a miracle happened overnight and your problem was solved, how would you know? What would be different?" This helps the client envision their goals.

Now, thinking about the different therapies. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: transtheoretical. I think that's more about the stages of change model—like pre-contemplation, contemplation, etc. Not sure if that's where the miracle question comes from.

Option B: family systems. This approach looks at the family dynamics and how they contribute to the problem. Maybe, but I'm not recalling the miracle question here.

Option C: solution-focused. Oh wait, that rings a bell. Solution-focused therapy is all about focusing on solutions rather than the problem. They often ask questions that help clients imagine a better future. The miracle question sounds like it would fit here because it's about envisioning a positive outcome.

Option D: psychodynamic. That's more about exploring past experiences and unconscious thoughts. Doesn't seem related to the miracle question.

Option E: REBT. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, which is part of CBT. It's about challenging irrational beliefs. I don't think the miracle question is a main part of REBT.

Option F: interpersonal. Focuses on interpersonal relationships and communication. Not sure about the miracle question here.

Option G: gestalt. This is about being present and awareness of the here and now. Techniques might involve role-playing or empty chair exercises. Doesn't seem to match the miracle question.

Option H: cognitive-behavioral. CBT focuses on thoughts and behaviors. While it's solution-oriented, the miracle question specifically—I think it's more of a solution-focused technique than a standard CBT one.

Option I: humanistic. Approaches like person-centered therapy, which focus on personal growth and self-actualization. The miracle question isn't a term I associate here.

Option J: dialectical behavior. This is a type of CBT that focuses on emotional regulation and coping skills. Again, not directly linked to the miracle question.

Putting it all together, the miracle question is a hallmark of solution-focused therapy. So the correct answer should be option C.

The "miracle question" is most closely associated with solution-focused therapy, which emphasizes envisioning a positive future and identifying steps toward it. This approach aligns with the technique of asking clients to imagine a scenario where their problems are solved, making option C the correct choice.

Answer: C
