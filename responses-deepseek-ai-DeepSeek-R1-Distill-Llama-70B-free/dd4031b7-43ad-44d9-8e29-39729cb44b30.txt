Okay, so I've got this problem about the absorption of H2S from air into water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on mass transfer, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the given data: The total pressure is 2 atm, temperature is 30°C. The mass transfer coefficient, k_c', is 11 lb·mole/hr·ft² per (lb·mole/ft³). So that's the gas-phase coefficient. 

At a certain point, the mole fraction of H2S in the liquid at the interface is 2e-5. The partial pressure of H2S in the air is 0.05 atm. Henry's law constant is 600 atm per mole fraction.

I remember that the rate of absorption can be calculated using the formula: N = k_c' * (P - P_interface), where P is the partial pressure of the solute in the gas phase, and P_interface is the partial pressure at the interface (which is in equilibrium with the liquid).

Wait, but wait. Henry's law says that P = H * x, where x is the mole fraction in the liquid. So the partial pressure at the interface should be H times x. Let me make sure I get that right.

So, P_interface = H * x. Plugging in the numbers, H is 600 atm/(mole fraction), and x is 2e-5. So 600 * 2e-5 = 0.012 atm. Oh, wait, 600 * 2e-5, let me calculate that. 600 * 2 is 1200, times 1e-5 is 0.012 atm. So P_interface is 0.012 atm.

The partial pressure in the gas phase, P, is given as 0.05 atm. So the driving force is P - P_interface = 0.05 - 0.012 = 0.038 atm.

Now, the rate N is k_c' multiplied by this driving force. Wait, no, wait. I think the formula might involve the Henry's law in a different way. Alternatively, sometimes the equation is written as N = (k_c' * P) / (H). Or maybe it's N = k_c' * (P - (x * H)). Wait, no, that's what I did earlier. Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct formula is N = k_c' * (P - P_interface). Because P is the partial pressure in the bulk gas, and P_interface is the partial pressure at the interface. So the driving force is the difference between these two.

So substituting the numbers: k_c' is 11 lb·mole/hr·ft² per (lb·mole/ft³). Wait, wait, that's not the usual way. Oh, wait, the units of k_c' are given as 11 lb·mole/(hr·ft²) divided by (lb·mole/ft³), so that's lb·mole/(hr·ft²) * ft³/(lb·mole) → the units would be ft/hr. But wait, the units for mass transfer coefficients can be a bit confusing.

Wait, no, the units for k_c (gas phase) are typically in terms like lb-mole/(hr·ft²·atm) or similar. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. Oh, I think I need to make sure about the correct formula.

Another approach: the flux (N) can be calculated as (k_c' * P) / H, but only when the liquid phase resistance is negligible. Or maybe when using the overall coefficient based on the gas phase.

Wait, I remember that for gas absorption, the rate can be expressed as N = k_c' * (P - P_interface). Because P is the partial pressure in the bulk gas, and P_interface is the partial pressure at the interface. So the driving force is (P - P_interface).

So plugging in the numbers:

N = 11 lb·mole/(hr·ft²) * (0.05 atm - 0.012 atm) → 11 * 0.038 = ?

Calculating 11 * 0.038: 0.038 * 10 is 0.38, 0.038 * 1 is 0.038, so 0.38 + 0.038 = 0.418? Wait, no, that's 11 times 0.038. Let me compute it properly.

0.038 * 11: 0.038 * 10 = 0.38, 0.038 * 1 = 0.038 → total 0.418 lb·mole/(hr·ft²). Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are around 0.04 to 0.06. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the formula. Maybe the correct expression is N = (k_c' * P) / H. Let me think about that. Henry's law is P = H x → x = P / H. So the concentration in the liquid (x) is P/H. But if the gas is being absorbed, the rate is proportional to the partial pressure difference, but sometimes it's expressed in terms of concentrations.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = k_c' (C_gas - C_interface), where C is the concentration. But C in the gas phase is P/(RT), and in the interface, it's P_interface/(RT). So the difference is (P - P_interface)/(RT). Then N would be k_c' * (P - P_interface)/(RT). But wait, that would involve the ideal gas law, and I don't have R or T given here. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, the given k_c' has units of lb·mole/(hr·ft²· (lb·mole/ft³)), which can be rewritten as (lb·mole)/(hr·ft²) divided by (lb·mole/ft³) → (ft³)/(hr·ft²) → ft/hr. Which is a typical unit for a mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase when concentration is expressed in lb·mole/ft³.

Wait, so if N is in lb·mole/(hr·ft²), then the formula is N = k_c' * (C_gas - C_interface). But C here is in lb·mole/ft³. So how do I get C from the partial pressure?

The concentration in the gas phase can be calculated using the ideal gas law: C = P/(RT). But wait, I don't have R or T. Unless the value is already accounted for in the units of k_c'.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think again. The rate of absorption is given by N = k_c' (P - P_i), where P is the bulk gas partial pressure, and P_i is the interface partial pressure.

But earlier, I calculated P_i as 0.012 atm, so P - P_i is 0.038 atm. But wait, how does that fit with the units? Because the units of k_c' are lb·mole/(hr·ft²) per (lb·mole/ft³). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, no—k_c' is given as 11 lb·mole/(hr·ft²· (lb·mole/ft³)). So the units of k_c' is (lb·mole/(hr·ft²)) / (lb·mole/ft³) = (ft³/(hr·ft²)) → ft/hr. So that's a velocity, but in mass transfer terms, it's a transfer coefficient.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think in terms of concentration differences. Because the mass transfer coefficient's units are ft/hr when dealing with gas-phase and using partial pressures, perhaps the flux is N = (k_c' * (P - P_i)) / H. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation N = k_c' (C_g - C_i), where C_g is the concentration in the bulk gas and C_i is the concentration at the interface.

So, C_g = P / (RT), and C_i = P_i / (RT). So C_g - C_i = (P - P_i) / (RT). Then, N = k_c' * (P - P_i) / (RT).

But wait, I don't have R or T. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to express everything in terms of partial pressures and Henry's law.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Given that Henry's law is P = H x, and the mole fraction x at the interface is 2e-5. So P_i = H * x = 600 * 2e-5 = 0.012 atm. So the driving force is 0.05 - 0.012 = 0.038 atm.

Now, the rate of absorption is N = (k_c' / H) * (P - P_i). Or maybe N = k_c' * (P - P_i) / H. Because Henry's law relates P to x, and perhaps the concentration in the liquid is x, so the mass transfer would be related to the partial pressure difference scaled by H.

Wait, in some textbooks, the overall mass transfer coefficient is used with the Henry's law. So when the liquid phase resistance is negligible, the rate is N = (k_c' / H) * (P - P_i). Or maybe it's N = k_c' * (P - P_i) / H. Let me think about the units.

k_c' is in lb·mole/(hr·ft²) per (lb·mole/ft³). So (k_c') * (P - P_i) → (lb·mole/(hr·ft²·lb·mole/ft³)) ) * atm. Wait, but atm is a pressure unit, which is force per area. Not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (k_c' * P) / (H). Let me try that. So N = (11 lb·mole/(hr·ft²· (lb·mole/ft³))) ) * (0.05 atm) / (600 atm/(lb·mole/(ft³)) )).

Wait, let's see. k_c' has units lb·mole/(hr·ft²) divided by (lb·mole/ft³), so (lb·mole/(hr·ft²)) / (lb·mole/ft³) → ft³/(hr·ft²) → ft/hr.

When you multiply by P (atm), you get ft·atm/hr. Then, dividing by H (atm/(lb·mole/ft³))), so (ft·atm)/(hr) ) / (atm/(lb·mole/ft³))) → (ft·atm)/(hr) * (lb·mole/ft³)/atm → (ft * lb·mole)/(hr·ft³) ) → (lb·mole)/(hr·ft²). Which matches the units for N.

So the formula would be N = (k_c' * P) / H. But wait, that can't be right because we also have the P_i to consider, the interface partial pressure. Because the driving force is (P - P_i), not just P.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (k_c' * (P - P_i)) / H. Let's check the units again.

k_c' = ft/hr.

Multiply by (P - P_i) which is atm → (ft·atm)/hr.

Divide by H in atm/(lb·mole/ft³)) → (ft·atm)/(hr) * (lb·mole/ft³)/atm → (ft·lb·mole)/(hr·ft³) ) → (lb·mole)/(hr·ft²). Which is correct.

So the formula is N = (k_c' * (P - P_i)) / H.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the driving force was (P - P_i), so including that makes sense.

So substituting the numbers:

k_c' = 11 ft/hr.

H = 600 atm/(lb·mole/ft³).

P = 0.05 atm, P_i = 0.012 atm.

So (P - P_i) = 0.038 atm.

So N = (11 ft/hr) * (0.038 atm) / (600 atm/(lb·mole/ft³))).

Let me compute that:

11 * 0.038 = 0.418.

0.418 / 600 = approx 0.0006967.

Wait, but the units, let's see:

ft/hr * atm / (atm/(lb·mole/ft³))) → ft/hr * (atm * lb·mole/ft³)/atm → ft*lb·mole/(hr·ft³) → (lb·mole)/(hr·ft²).

So the numerical value is 0.418 / 600 = 0.0006967 lb·mole/(hr·ft²). That's way too low compared to the options given. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the formula doesn't include dividing by H. Let me think again. Maybe another approach: in gas absorption, when the liquid phase resistance is negligible, the rate can be expressed as N = k_c' (P - P_i). Because k_c' has the appropriate units, and (P - P_i) is in atm. But earlier, that gave me 0.418 lb·mole/(hr·ft²), which isn't among the options.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option D:0.05, but 0.418 is way higher.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Wait, k_c' is given as 11 lb·mole/(hr·ft²) per (lb·mole/ft³), which is 11 (lb·mole/(hr·ft²)) / (lb·mole/ft³) → 11 ft³/(hr·ft²) → 11 ft/hr.

So k_c' is 11 ft/hr.

Then, (P - P_i) = 0.038 atm.

So N = (k_c') * (P - P_i) → 11 ft/hr * 0.038 atm.

But wait, that gives units of ft·atm/(hr). I need to convert that into lb·mole/(hr·ft²). Hmm, perhaps I need to include the ideal gas law.

Wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT → C = n/V = P/(RT), where R is the gas constant.

So, C = P/(RT). So, the concentration difference in the gas phase is (P - P_i)/(RT).

Thus, N = k_c' * (P - P_i)/(RT).

But then I need R and T. Let's see, R is 10.73 ft·atm/(lb·mole·R). Wait, or is it 0.7302 ft·atm/(lb·mole·R)? I'm a bit confused about the exact value.

Wait, R (gas constant) is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mole·R). But since 1 atm is 14.696 psi, so R = 10.7316 * 14.696 ft·atm/(lb·mole·R)? Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, R is approximately 0.7302 ft·atm/(lb·mole·R). Let me confirm that.

Yes, R is 0.7302 ft·atm/(lb·mole·°R). So, at 30°C, which is 86°F, but in Rankine, it's 30 + 459.67 = 489.67 °R.

So, R*T is 0.7302 * 489.67 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.7302 * 489.67 → 0.7302 * 500 is about 365.1, but since it's 489.67, which is 500 -10.33, so 0.7302*(500-10.33)= 365.1 - 0.7302*10.33. 0.7302*10=7.302, 0.7302*0.33≈0.241, so total≈7.543. So 365.1 -7.543≈357.557 ft·atm/(lb·mole).

So R*T ≈ 357.557 ft·atm/(lb·mole).

Now, back to N = k_c' * (P - P_i) / (R*T).

Wait, but wait, k_c' is 11 ft/hr, (P - P_i) is 0.038 atm, R*T is 357.557 ft·atm/(lb·mole).

So N = (11 ft/hr) * (0.038 atm) / (357.557 ft·atm/(lb·mole)).

Let me compute that.

11 * 0.038 = 0.418.

0.418 / 357.557 ≈ 0.001168 lb·mole/(hr·ft²).

But that's even smaller than the previous result, which doesn't make sense because the options are around 0.05.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is N = (k_c' * P) / H. Let me try that.

k_c' = 11 lb·mole/(hr·ft²) per (lb·mole/ft³) → units ft/hr.

So N = (11 ft/hr) * (0.05 atm) / (600 atm/(lb·mole/ft³))).

So 11 * 0.05 = 0.55.

0.55 divided by 600 is 0.0009167 lb·mole/(hr·ft²). Still way too low.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the overall mass transfer coefficient. Wait, another approach: the absorption rate can be expressed as N = k_c * (y - y_i), where y is mole fraction in gas, y_i is at interface.

Wait, but the problem gives partial pressures, not mole fractions. So, let me compute mole fractions.

Total pressure is 2 atm. Partial pressure of H2S is 0.05 atm. So mole fraction y = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025.

At the interface, the partial pressure is 0.012 atm, so mole fraction y_i = 0.012 / 2 = 0.006.

So the driving force is y - y_i = 0.025 -
