Okay, so I've got this riddle that Tisha wrote, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again: "I have 2 faces, no vertices, and I can roll. What am I?" Hmm, interesting. Let's break it down piece by piece.

First, the riddle says "I have 2 faces." Faces, in geometry terms, usually refer to the flat surfaces of a shape. So I'm thinking about three-dimensional objects and how many faces they have. A cube has six faces, a cylinder... wait, a cylinder has two circular faces, right? The top and bottom. So that fits the two faces part.

Next part: "no vertices." Vertices are the corners where edges meet. So which shapes don't have any vertices? Let me think. A sphere is smooth, no edges or vertices, but it has infinite faces if you think about it, but maybe that's not right. A cylinder has two circular edges, but do those count as vertices? Wait, vertices are points, not lines. So the edges of a cylinder are circular and don't have points where they meet, so maybe a cylinder has no vertices. That makes sense because the top and bottom are circles without corners.

Then the last part: "I can roll." Rolling implies that the object can move smoothly without flipping over edges or something. A cylinder can definitely roll, like a wheel or a can. A sphere can roll too, but let's see if it fits the other clues.

Wait, the sphere has all faces... well, it's one continuous face, so it doesn't have two. So that's out. What about a cone? A cone has a base and a tip, so maybe two faces, but the base is a circle and the side is a triangle when unwrapped. Wait, but in 3D, a cone has one base (a face) and one lateral face, but that's two faces. But cones have a vertex at the tip, so that's a vertex. So the riddle says no vertices, so cone is out.

What about a torus? A torus has a hole in the middle, like a donut. It has two faces, the inner and outer surfaces maybe? Or is it one continuous face? I'm a bit confused there. Also, a torus can roll, but I'm not sure about the number of faces and vertices. Wait, a torus doesn't have any vertices either because it's smooth all around. But I'm not certain about the faces part. Maybe it's considered to have one face because it's a single surface, but I'm not sure. So perhaps the cylinder is a better fit.

Putting it all together: two faces (cylinder's top and bottom), no vertices (smooth edges), and can roll. So the answer should be a cylinder. Looking at the options, option I is cylinder.

The riddle states: "I have 2 faces, no vertices, and I can roll." Breaking it down:

1. **Two faces**: A cylinder has two distinct circular faces (top and bottom).
2. **No vertices**: A cylinder lacks vertices since its edges are smooth and continuous.
3. **Can roll**: A cylinder can roll smoothly, like a wheel.

Other options like the sphere (one face, no vertices, but doesn't fit the two-face clue) and cone (has a vertex) are eliminated. The cylinder fits all criteria.
