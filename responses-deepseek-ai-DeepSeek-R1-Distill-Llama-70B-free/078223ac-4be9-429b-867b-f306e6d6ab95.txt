Okay, so I've got this heat pump question here. Hmm, I remember that heat pumps are like the opposite of refrigerators in a way. Instead of moving heat out of a system, they move heat into a system. So in this case, the heat pump is extracting heat from the outdoor environment, which is at 7°C, and bringing it indoors where it's 27°C. 

The question is asking about the smallest amount of work needed to supply 15,000 J of heat indoors. Oh right, I think this is related to the coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump. The COP would tell me how efficient the heat pump is. Since it's the smallest amount of work, we're probably looking for the maximum COP, which would be the Carnot COP because that's the most efficient theoretical cycle.

So the COP for a heat pump in the Carnot cycle is given by COP = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold). But wait, the temperatures need to be in Kelvin for this formula. Okay, I'll convert them. 

T_hot is 27°C, which is 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K. T_cold is 7°C, which is 7 + 273.15 = 280.15 K. 

So plugging those into the COP formula: COP = 300.15 / (300.15 - 280.15). Let me calculate that denominator first. 300.15 minus 280.15 is 20 K. So COP = 300.15 / 20 ≈ 15.0075. Let's just round it to about 15 for simplicity.

Now, the COP is defined as the heat delivered (Q_h) divided by the work input (W). So COP = Q_h / W. We need to find W, so rearranging the formula gives W = Q_h / COP.

The question states that Q_h is 15,000 J. So W = 15,000 J / 15 ≈ 1000 J. So the smallest amount of work needed is approximately 1000 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 1,000 J. So the answer should be B.

Wait a second, let me double-check. Did I get the temperatures right? Yes, 27 and 7 converted correctly. And the formula—yes, COP is T_hot over the difference. So 300/20 is 15. Yeah, that makes sense. So 15000 divided by 15 is 1000. Yep, I think that's correct.

To determine the smallest amount of work required for a heat pump to deliver 15,000 J of heat indoors, we use the concept of the coefficient of performance (COP) for a heat pump operating on a Carnot cycle. The COP is given by:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{T_{\text{hot}}}{T_{\text{hot}} - T_{\text{cold}}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{hot}}\) and \(T_{\text{cold}}\) are the absolute temperatures in Kelvin. Converting the given temperatures:

\[
T_{\text{hot}} = 27^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K}, \quad T_{\text{cold}} = 7^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 280.15 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{300.15}{300.15 - 280.15} = \frac{300.15}{20} \approx 15.
\]

The COP is also defined as:

\[
\text{COP} = \frac{Q_{\text{h}}}{W},
\]

where \(Q_{\text{h}}\) is the heat delivered and \(W\) is the work input. Rearranging for \(W\):

\[
W = \frac{Q_{\text{h}}}{\text{COP}}.
\]

Given \(Q_{\text{h}} = 15,000 \, \text{J}\) and \(\text{COP} \approx 15\):

\[
W = \frac{15,000}{15} = 1,000 \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the smallest amount of work required is approximately 1,000 J. From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 1,000 J**
