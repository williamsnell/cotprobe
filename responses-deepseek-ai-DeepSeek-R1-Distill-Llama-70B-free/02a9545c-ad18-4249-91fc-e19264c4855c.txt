Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a shopkeeper who owns a vacant lot in fee simple absolute. That means he has complete ownership with no limitations, right? Then in 1960, he conveyed the property using a general warranty deed. The deed says: "The grantor conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25."

Hmm, okay. So the grantor (shopkeeper) is giving the property to his friend, but there's a condition. If the lot is ever used for church purposes, it goes to the sister's children who are 25 or older.

At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single. Later, she married and had two sons. Then one son died in a car accident. Three years after that, the sister had a daughter. Now, the question is about determining ownership rights, with all minors represented.

I need to figure out who owns the lot now. Let's break this down.

First, the original conveyance: the friend gets the lot, but with a condition. If the lot is used for church purposes, it goes to the sister's children who are 25 or older. So this looks like a contingent remainder. Because the friend has the present interest, and the sister's children have a future interest that's contingent on two things: the property being used for church purposes and them reaching 25.

Wait, but the sister was single when the conveyance happened. So at that time, she didn't have any children. So when the sister later married and had children, those children would be the ones who could take under the condition.

Now, the sister had two sons. One died, then she had a daughter. So the sons are the first two children, and the daughter is the third.

But let's think about when each child was born. When the shopkeeper conveyed the property in 1960, the sister had no children. So the class of beneficiaries (the sister's children) didn't exist yet. But the deed's condition is about the property being used for church purposes, so that would trigger the shift.

Wait, but under the common law, a class gift (like to a class of people) can include after-born children if the gift is made in a way that includes them. So in this case, the grantor's sister might have more children, and those children would be included as the class members when the condition is met.

So in the deed, the condition is that if the property is ever used for church purposes, then it goes to the children of my sister who reach 25. So the condition is twofold: the use for church, and the children reaching 25.

Now, the friend has the present interest. The sister's children have a contingent remainder subject to their reaching 25.

Wait, but in real property, when you create a future interest, it's important whether it's a contingent remainder or an executory interest. If the condition is a condition subsequent, it's a defeasible fee. But here, the wording is "if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to...", which sounds like a condition subsequent. So the friend has a fee simple subject to defeasance. So if the condition is met (church use), the estate reverts or goes to the specified grantee.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The wording is "conveys to my friend, but if [condition], then to [someone else]." That structure is similar to "to A, but if X happens, then to B." That's typically a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, or maybe a fee simple determinable with a shifting executory interest.

Wait, no. The grant is "to A, but if X happens, then to B." That's a fee simple subject to an executory interest. Because upon occurrence of X, the property goes to B, cutting short A's estate.

So in this case, the friend has a fee simple, but if the lot is used for church purposes, then the property goes to the sister's children who reach 25.

So the friend holds a fee simple subject to an executory interest in the sister's children who reach 25 upon the occurrence of the condition (church use).

But wait, the condition hasn't happened yet, right? The problem doesn't say that the lot is being used for church purposes. So the friend still holds the fee simple, and the executory interest is still in the sister's children, but it's contingent because the condition hasn't occurred.

Wait, but the question is about the current ownership, not when the condition is met. So maybe the friend still owns it unless the condition is triggered.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says "the title is in" and the options are about who owns it now.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the question again. It says, "in an appropriate action to determine the ownership rights to the vacant lot with all minors represented, title is in..." So it's about the current ownership.

But the condition (church use) hasn't occurred yet. So the executory interest hasn't been triggered. Therefore, the friend still holds title, unless I'm missing something.

Wait, but the other possibility is that the conveyance created a fee simple in the friend, with a possibility of reverter if the condition occurs. But I think that's not the case because the language is "to A, but if X, then to B." So it's more like an executory interest in B, not the grantor.

So if the condition occurs, the executory interest takes effect, and the property goes to B (the sister's children who reach 25). But until then, the friend holds the fee simple.

So the friend owns the property, and the sister's children have a contingent future interest (executory interest) that will take effect only if the condition is met.

But the question is about the present ownership. So the friend holds the title, but the executory interest is in the sister's children.

Wait, but the question is about the current ownership rights, so the friend is the current owner, and the sister's children have a potential future interest, but that's only if the condition occurs.

So the current title is with the friend only, unless the condition has been met. Since the condition hasn't been met, the friend holds the title.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is "the friend only", which would make sense if the friend holds the title, and the sister's children have a future interest, but not the present title.

But wait, another angle: the problem states that the sister was single at the time of conveyance, but later married and had two sons, one of whom died, and then had a daughter. So the sister has three children: two sons (one deceased), and a daughter.

So the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25. Let me think about their status.

At the time of conveyance, the sister had no children. So the class of beneficiaries (the sister's children) is a class that can include after-born children, as long as they meet the condition (reach 25 when the condition is met).

But the condition is that the property is used for church purposes. So if that happens, the property goes to those of the sister's children who have reached 25.

So, the sister's children are:

1. Son A: born after 1960, died in an automobile accident. Let's say he died before reaching 25, because otherwise, he would have met the condition.

Wait, but the problem says that after the sister had two sons, one died, and three years after that, she had a daughter. So the two sons are older than the daughter.

Assuming the sister had the first son right after 1960, but not sure. The exact timing isn't given, but let's think: the sister was single in 1960, married later, so the sons were born after that. The first son died, then three years later, the daughter was born.

So the sister has two sons and a daughter. The first son died, perhaps before reaching 25. Let's say he was 20 when he died. The second son is alive, but his age isn't given. The daughter is the youngest, perhaps a minor now.

But the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25. So any of her children who reach 25 when the condition is met would take. But the condition (church use) hasn't happened yet, so the executory interest is still pending.

Wait, but the problem is asking who holds title now, not when the condition occurs. So the friend holds the title, and the executory interest is held by the sister's children, but that's a future interest, not present ownership.

So, in the present, the friend holds title, and the sister's children have a potential future interest. Therefore, the current ownership is with the friend only.

Looking at the options, option C says "the friend only." So that would be the answer.

Wait, but what about the possibility that the executory interest is vested or contingent?

The executory interest here is contingent because the condition (church use) hasn't occurred, and also because the sister's children must reach 25. So the executory interest is contingent on both the condition and their age.

But regardless of that, the current title is with the friend. Because the executory interest hasn't been triggered. So the friend owns the lot.

So the answer would be option C.
</think>

The shopkeeper conveyed the vacant lot to the friend in 1960 with a condition: if the property is ever used for church purposes, it would go to the children of the shopkeeper's sister who reach the age of 25. At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single and had no children. Subsequently, the sister married, had two sons (one of whom died), and later had a daughter. The question asks who holds title to the property now.

The conveyance created a fee simple subject to an executory interest. The friend holds the present estate, while the executory interest is held by the sister's children who reach the age of 25, but only if the condition (use for church purposes) is met. Since the condition has not occurred, the executory interest remains contingent and has not yet vested. Therefore, the friend retains full ownership of the property.

The sister's children (the deceased son, the surviving son, and the daughter) hold a contingent future interest, but this does not affect the current title. The current ownership is with the friend only.

Option C correctly reflects this analysis.
