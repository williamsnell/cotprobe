Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle ABC. The given information is that side AB is 10 cm, side BC is 3 cm, and the angle at B, which is angle ABC, is 107 degrees. Hmm, right, so I'm trying to remember how to calculate the area of a triangle when I know two sides and the included angle. Oh wait, right, I think the formula is something like (1/2)*ab*sinθ, where a and b are the lengths of the sides, and θ is the angle between them.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let's make sure I get this right. So in triangle ABC, the sides AB and BC are given as 10 cm and 3 cm respectively. The angle at B is 107 degrees. So AB is one side, BC is the adjacent side, and the angle between them is 107 degrees. So the formula should apply here.

So the area would be (1/2) * AB * BC * sin(angle ABC). Plugging the numbers in, that's (1/2) * 10 * 3 * sin(107 degrees). Let me compute that step by step.

First, 10 multiplied by 3 is 30. Then, 30 multiplied by 1/2 is 15. So it's 15 times the sine of 107 degrees. Now, I need to calculate sin(107°). I remember that sin(90°) is 1, and as the angle increases beyond 90°, the sine starts to decrease. Wait, no, wait. Wait, sin(90°)=1, sin(180°)=0, so between 90 and 180, the sine goes from 1 to 0. So 107 degrees is in the second quadrant, so sin(107) is positive, and it's about... I'm not exactly sure of the exact value, but I think I can approximate it.

Alternatively, maybe I should just use a calculator for sin(107°). Since I don't have a calculator, I can perhaps remember that sin(60°) is about 0.866, sin(90°) is 1, so 107 is 17 degrees beyond 90. Wait, wait, 107 is 90 + 17 degrees. So maybe I can think of it as sin(90+17) = cos(17), because sin(90+x) = cos(x). Wait, no, wait. No, sin(90 + x) is actually equal to cos(x), but wait, no, wait, sin(90 + x) is cos(x) only for certain quadrants. Wait, no, wait, actually, sin(90° + θ) = cos(θ). Wait, no, wait, let me think. Let me recall the sine addition formula. Sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b. So sin(90 + 17) = sin90 cos17 + cos90 sin17. Since sin90 is 1 and cos90 is 0, this simplifies to cos17. So sin(107°) = cos(17°). Oh, right, so that's easier to compute.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused because when I think about angles, sometimes I mix up sine and cosine. Let me double-check. For example, sin(90°) is 1, and as we go past 90°, the sine decreases. So 107 degrees is in the second quadrant where sine is positive, so that's correct.

But wait, cos(17) is a positive value, so that's correct. So sin(107) = cos(17). So perhaps I can compute cos(17 degrees) to find the value.

Now, I don't remember the exact value of cos(17°), but I can approximate it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator for better accuracy, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try to find an approximate value.

I know that cos(0°) is 1, cos(30°) is about 0.866, cos(45°) is about 0.707, and cos(60°) is 0.5. So 17 degrees is between 0 and 30, so cos(17) should be close to 0.956 or something. Wait, I think cos(15°) is about 0.9659, and cos(30°) is 0.866, so cos(17) would be between those. Let me see: 17 is two degrees more than 15, so maybe around 0.956. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator for more precise calculation. But since I don't have a calculator, I'll proceed with an approximate value. Let's say cos(17°) ≈ 0.9563. So sin(107°)=cos(17°)=0.9563.

Now, going back to the area calculation: 15 * 0.9563 = ?

Let me compute 15 * 0.9563. 15 times 0.9 is 13.5, 15 times 0.05 is 0.75, 15 times 0.0063 is approximately 0.0945. So adding those up: 13.5 + 0.75 is 14.25, plus 0.0945 is approximately 14.3445. So the area is approximately 14.3445 cm².

Looking at the options, option J is 14.34457 cm², which matches my calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, the formula is (1/2)*AB*BC*sinθ. AB is 10, BC is 3, so 10*3=30, times 1/2 is 15. Then, 15 times sin(107°). Wait, earlier I thought sin(107) is cos(17), which is correct, but let me make sure that the approximation of cos(17) as 0.9563 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better method. Let me think: I recall that cos(15°) is approximately 0.9659258, and cos(30°) is 0.8660254. So for 17 degrees, which is 2 degrees above 15, the cosine would be a bit less than 0.9659258. Let me approximate it using linear interpolation, perhaps, although it's not exact.

The difference between 15 and 30 degrees is 15 degrees, and cos(15)=0.9659258, cos(30)=0.8660254. The difference in cos is 0.9659258 - 0.8660254 = 0.0999004 over 15 degrees. So per degree, approximately 0.0999004 / 15 ≈ 0.00666003 decrease per degree. So for 2 degrees beyond 15, the decrease is 2 * 0.00666003 ≈ 0.01332006. So cos(17) ≈ 0.9659258 - 0.01332006 = 0.9526057. Hmm, so maybe my initial approximation of 0.9563 was a bit off. Let me use 0.9526 as a better approximation.

So then, sin(107°) = cos(17°) ≈ 0.9526. Then, the area is 15 * 0.9526 = ?

Let me compute 15 * 0.9526. 10 times 0.9526 is 9.526, and 5 times 0.9526 is 4.763. Adding those together: 9.526 + 4.763 = 14.289. Wait, that's 14.289.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the linear approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just use more accurate values.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator for a more precise value. But since I don't have one, maybe I can recall that sin(107°) is approximately 0.9563. Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought sin(107) is cos(17) which is approximately 0.9563. But when I approximated cos(17) using linear interpolation, I got around 0.9526, which is a bit lower.

Hmm, perhaps I should check another approach. Let me think: Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area of a triangle using the formula (1/2)*a*b*sinθ, which in this case, a=10, b=3, θ=107°, so yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with the initial calculation. So, if I take sin(107°) as approximately 0.9563, then the area would be 15 * 0.9563 = 14.3445 cm², which matches option J.

Wait, but when I did the linear approximation for cos(17), I got a lower value, leading to 14.289. But perhaps that linear approximation is not accurate because the cosine function doesn't decrease linearly with degrees. So, maybe 0.9563 is a better approximation for cos(17°).

Wait, I think the exact value of cos(17°) is approximately 0.95630476. So that's where the 0.9563 comes from. So, then, using that value, 15 * 0.95630476 = ?

Let me compute that accurately. 15 * 0.95630476.

0.95630476 * 15:

Compute 0.95630476 * 10 = 9.5630476

0.95630476 * 5 = 4.7815238

Adding them together: 9.5630476 + 4.7815238 = 14.3445714 cm².

So the area is approximately 14.34457 cm², which matches option J.

Therefore, the correct answer should be J: 14.34457 cm².

To find the area of triangle \(ABC\), we use the formula for the area of a triangle when two sides and the included angle are known:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot |AB| \cdot |BC| \cdot \sin(\angle ABC)
\]

Given:
- \(|AB| = 10 \, \text{cm}\),
- \(|BC| = 3 \, \text{cm}\),
- \(\angle ABC = 107^\circ\),

we substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 3 \cdot \sin(107^\circ)
\]

First, calculate the product of the sides and \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 10 \cdot 3 = 15
\]

Next, determine \(\sin(107^\circ)\). Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ + \theta) = \cos(\theta)\), we find:

\[
\sin(107^\circ) = \sin(90^\circ + 17^\circ) = \cos(17^\circ)
\]

The value of \(\cos(17^\circ)\) is approximately \(0.9563\). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = 15 \cdot 0.9563 = 14.3445 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

To ensure precision, we refine the calculation:

\[
\cos(17^\circ) \approx 0.95630476
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Area} = 15 \cdot 0.95630476 = 14.3445714 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Rounding to five decimal places:

\[
\text{Area} \approx 14.34457 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 14.34457 cm²**
