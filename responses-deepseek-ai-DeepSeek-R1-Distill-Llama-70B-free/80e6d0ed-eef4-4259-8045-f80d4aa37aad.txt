Question:

A man suffered frostbite when he spilled a soft drink on his lap that he had purchased from a restaurant. The man sued the restaurant for negligence and damages. At trial, the man's attorney calls a witness to testify that the witness also suffered frostbite when she spilled a soft drink in her lap that she had purchased at the restaurant two weeks earlier. The witness also states that she told the restaurant about her injury immediately after suffering it. Upon objection by the restaurant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the witness's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, but only to prove the restaurant's negligence and not for any claims of damages.
B: inadmissible, as it is an unrelated incident and does not prove the restaurant's negligence in the man's case.
C: admissible, as it is a similar occurrence and can prove a pattern of negligence by the restaurant.
D: inadmissible, as it is hearsay and not directly related to the man's case.
E: admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger of frostbite posed by its soft drinks.
F: inadmissible, because it is not probative of a fact in issue.
G: admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence, provided that the court gives a cautionary instruction that the testimony should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages.
H: inadmissible, because it seeks to put into evidence separate, unrelated transactions with a third party.
I: admissible, as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk associated with their soft drinks.
J: inadmissible, because it constitutes character evidence against the restaurant.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with admissibility in a trial. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a man suing a restaurant for negligence after he spilled a soft drink on his lap and got frostbite. His attorney is calling a witness who had a similar experience two weeks earlier—she also spilled a soft drink, got frostbite, and told the restaurant about it right away. Now, the restaurant's attorney objects, and the judge has to decide if the witness's testimony is admissible.

I remember that evidence can be excluded if it's not relevant or if it's considered prejudicial. So the first thing I need to figure out is whether this prior incident is relevant. The general rule is that evidence of other acts or occurrences is not admissible to prove a person's character or tendency. But there are exceptions, like when it's used to show a pattern of behavior, knowledge, or negligence.

In this case, the witness's testimony is about a similar incident happening two weeks before the man's incident. She also informed the restaurant, which might indicate that the restaurant had notice of the problem. So maybe this is being offered to show that the restaurant knew about the risk of frostbite from their soft drinks and didn't take steps to prevent it, which would support the claim of negligence.

Wait, but I think evidence of prior similar incidents can be admissible if they're sufficiently similar and not too remote in time. The two-week gap seems pretty short, so that's a point in favor of admissibility. The fact that the witness told the restaurant right after her injury could show that the restaurant had actual knowledge of the potential danger, which is important for establishing negligence.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's admissible as a similar occurrence showing a pattern of negligence. That makes sense because it's not just about character but about showing that the restaurant was negligent in a similar situation, which could imply they were negligent in the man's case too.

Option E says it's admissible to prove the restaurant should have known about the danger. That's another angle—using the prior incident and the notification to show they had knowledge and failed to act, which ties into negligence.

Option I says it's admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge of the risk. That's similar to E, focusing on the notice aspect.

Option A says it's admissible only for negligence, not damages. I think once it's in for negligence, it might be relevant to damages as well, but maybe the court could limit its purpose with an instruction.

Option D says it's inadmissible as hearsay. But the testimony is about her own experience, so it's not hearsay. She's testifying about her own actions and what she told the restaurant, so that's direct evidence, not hearsay.

Option B says it's unrelated. I don't think so because it's a similar incident involving the same product and same type of injury.

Option F says it's not probative. I think it's very probative because it goes to the restaurant's knowledge and possible negligence.

Option G says admissible for negligence with a caution. That sounds plausible because the judge might allow it but instruct the jury on its limited purpose.

Option H says it's inadmissible because it's a third-party transaction. I don't think so because the third-party's incident is being used to show the defendant's knowledge or pattern, which is allowed in some cases.

Option J says it's character evidence. I don't think it's being used to show the restaurant's character but rather their specific knowledge or negligence in these incidents.

So, putting it together, the key points are whether the prior incident is too remote and whether it's being used for the right purpose. Since it's only two weeks prior and she told the restaurant, it's relevant to show they knew about the risk. So options C, E, I, and G are in play.

Wait, but the main issue is whether the evidence is admissible to prove negligence. The prior incident can show that the restaurant had notice, which is a key element of negligence. So the testimony would be relevant for that purpose.

So looking back, the options:

C: Admissible as similar occurrence to show pattern of negligence. 

E: Admissible to show the restaurant should have known about the danger.

I: Admissible to show knowledge.

G: Admissible for negligence with a caution.

Which of these is correct?

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of other acts is admissible if it's relevant for a purpose other than showing that the person acted in accordance with character. Here, the purpose is to show notice and negligence, which is allowed.

So the testimony is admissible, but the judge might need to instruct the jury on the limited purpose. So option C says it's admissible as a similar occurrence showing a pattern of negligence. Option E focuses on knowledge. Option I is about demonstrating knowledge.

Another thought: The witness's testimony includes that she told the restaurant, which would make the restaurant aware. So that supports the idea that the restaurant had knowledge of the risk, which is crucial for negligence.

So the primary purpose here is to show the restaurant's knowledge, which would make E and I relevant.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the witness's testimony. Her testimony is about her own injury and informing the restaurant. So the fact that she was injured and told them is relevant because it shows they had notice.

So the testimony would be admissible to prove that the restaurant knew or should have known about the risk, which is necessary for proving negligence. Therefore, option E or I.

Option E says admissible to prove the restaurant should have been aware of the danger. Option I says it's admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge.

Wait, option I says "the restaurant's knowledge of the risk," which is slightly different than "should have been aware." The witness told them immediately, so it's actual knowledge, not just constructive knowledge.

So option I would be about actual knowledge, while E is about what they should have known. Since the witness informed them, it's actual knowledge, making option I correct.

But wait, the alternative is option C, which is about a pattern of negligence. The prior incident could show that the restaurant was negligent in both cases, indicating a pattern.

Hmm, but the main issue is whether the prior incident is admissible. Under FRE 402, relevance is the first hurdle. Then, even if relevant, other rules might exclude it. But under FRE 405, methods of proving character are limited, but when it's not for character but for some other purpose, it's allowed.

So the testimony is relevant to show notice and negligence, not character. Therefore, it's admissible.

So looking at the options again:

Option C: admissible as similar occurrence and pattern of negligence.

Option E: admissible to show they should have known.

Option I: admissible to show their knowledge.

So the witness's testimony includes that she told the restaurant, which is actual notice. So it's about the restaurant's actual knowledge, making option I correct.

But wait, the man's case is that the restaurant was negligent. So the prior incident, if it's similar, can show that the restaurant had knowledge of the risk, which they failed to address, leading to the man's injury.

So the testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge, which is option I.

Alternatively, it's also about a pattern of negligence, which is option C.

Wait, but the prior incident's admissibility might be under the "similar occurrence" doctrine, which is sometimes allowed to show negligence. So maybe option C is correct.

I'm a bit torn between C and I. Let me think about the elements of negligence. The plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, and damages. To show breach, the plaintiff needs to establish that the restaurant failed to exercise reasonable care. If the restaurant had a similar incident and was notified, that could show that they were on notice and failed to take action, which is a breach.

So the prior incident is being used to show that the restaurant knew about the risk and failed to act, which is negligence. So option I is about showing the restaurant's knowledge, which directly ties into breach of duty.

Option C is about a pattern of negligence, which might imply that the restaurant repeatedly acted negligently. But I think the primary purpose here is to show notice, not necessarily a pattern.

So perhaps option I is the correct answer.

Wait, but the witness's testimony is about a similar incident, which can be used to show both notice and a pattern. So maybe the correct answer is C because it's a similar occurrence showing a pattern, which would support the negligence claim.

Alternatively, the primary purpose is to show notice, so it's I or E.

Wait, let me recall: when a prior incident is used to show that the defendant had knowledge of a dangerous condition, that's a recognized exception. For example, prior accidents can be used to show that the defendant knew or should have known about a hazard.

In this case, the witness told the restaurant about her injury, so the restaurant had actual knowledge. Therefore, the testimony is admissible to show that the restaurant knew about the risk, which supports the claim that they were negligent in not taking precautions.

So option I says it's admissible to demonstrate the restaurant's knowledge of the risk. That seems correct.

Alternatively, option E is about the restaurant should have been aware, but since the witness actually told them, it's more than just "should have known"—it's actual knowledge. So option I is better.

So the witness's testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge, making option I the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: the prior incident's admissibility might also depend on it being sufficiently similar. If the circumstances are similar enough, then it's admissible. Spilling a soft drink causing frostbite is the same in both cases, so it's sufficiently similar.

So putting it all together, the testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge of the risk, so option I.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's testimony in a negligence case. The witness testifies about a similar incident where she suffered frostbite after spilling a soft drink purchased from the same restaurant, and she informed the restaurant about her injury immediately. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible and for what purpose.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, prior incidents can be admissible if they are relevant and used for a purpose other than showing character or propensity. Here, the witness's testimony is relevant because it demonstrates that the restaurant had actual knowledge of the risk of frostbite from their soft drinks, as she informed them immediately after her injury. This knowledge is crucial to establishing negligence, as it shows the restaurant had notice of the danger and failed to take appropriate action.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not limited to proving negligence; it also speaks to the restaurant's knowledge of the risk, which is central to the case.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The incident is not unrelated; it is highly relevant as it involves the same product and similar circumstances.  
- **Option C**: Plausible. The testimony could show a pattern of negligence, but the primary purpose here is to establish the restaurant's knowledge of the risk.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay; the witness is testifying about her own experiences and direct communications with the restaurant.  
- **Option E**: Plausible. The testimony could show that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger, but since the witness actually informed the restaurant, it demonstrates actual knowledge, not just constructive knowledge.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The testimony is highly probative as it directly relates to the restaurant's knowledge and failure to act.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While a cautionary instruction might be appropriate, the testimony is admissible for its primary purpose of showing negligence.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The testimony is not about unrelated transactions; it is directly tied to the restaurant's alleged negligence.  
- **Option I**: Correct. The testimony is admissible to demonstrate the restaurant's actual knowledge of the risk, as the witness informed them immediately after her injury.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The testimony is not character evidence; it is used to show specific knowledge and negligence.

The most accurate answer is **Option I**, as the testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's actual knowledge of the risk, which is essential to proving negligence.
