Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an oil-immersion microscope. The question is asking me to find the numerical aperture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the microscope resolves 112,000 test lines per inch using blue light with a wavelength of 4500 Angstroms. Wait, Angstroms are 10^-10 meters, so 4500 Angstroms would be 4500e-10 meters, which is 450e-9 meters or 450 nm. Got that.

I remember that the resolving power of a microscope is related to the numerical aperture. Oh right, the formula for resolving power (R) is given by R = (2 * NA) / λ, where NA is the numerical aperture and λ is the wavelength of light used. Wait, no, wait—Wait, I think that's not quite right. Or was it that the resolving power is inversely proportional to the limit of resolution? Let me think again.

Oh, wait, the limit of resolution (d) is the minimum distance between two points that can still be seen as separate. The formula for the limit of resolution is d = λ / (2 * NA). So the smaller d is, the higher the resolving power, meaning you can distinguish smaller details. So if the test lines are 112,000 per inch, that must correspond to the resolving power. But how do I relate that?

Oh wait, the resolving power in terms of lines per inch is given by R = 2 * NA * (1 / λ). Or wait, perhaps it's R = (2 * NA) / λ, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me make sure.

I think the correct formula is R = (2 * NA) / λ. Where R is the resolving power in lines per inch. Or wait, no, that can't be dimensionally correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is R (in lines per mm) equals 1000 times NA divided by λ (in micrometers). Or maybe I'm mixing up different formulas.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The resolution (resolving power) is often given by the formula:

R = (2 * NA) / λ

But wait, R here would have units of inverse length. Because NA is dimensionless, λ is in meters, so R would be 1/m. Hmm, but the problem gives R as 112,000 lines per inch. So perhaps I need to convert that into lines per meter first.

So lines per inch: 112,000 lines/inch. There are 39.37 inches in a meter, so 112,000 lines/inch multiplied by 39.37 inches/meter would give lines per meter. Let me compute that. But wait, is that necessary?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for resolving power in lines per millimeter is R = 2 NA / λ (μm), since λ in micrometers and NA is unitless. Let's think: λ is 450 nm, which is 0.45 micrometers. So if I plug that in, R (lines/mm) would be 2 * NA / 0.45 μm.

Wait, but the given R is in lines per inch. So maybe I should convert R into lines per millimeter. Because 1 inch is 25.4 mm. So 112,000 lines per inch would be 112,000 / 25.4 ≈ let's calculate that. 112,000 divided by 25.4. Let me approximate: 25.4 times 4 is 101.6, so 4*25.4=101.6, so 112,000 is 112,000 /25.4 ≈ 4,409.84 lines per mm. Approximately.

Wait, actually, 25.4 mm is 1 inch, so 112,000 lines per inch is 112,000 / 25.4 ≈ 4410 lines/mm. So R is about 4410 lines/mm.

Now, using the formula R (lines/mm) = (2 * NA) / λ (in micrometers). Because λ is in micrometers here. So λ is 0.45 micrometers.

So plugging in R = 4410 = 2 * NA / 0.45.

Wait, so 4410 = (2 NA) / 0.45 → 2 NA = 4410 * 0.45 → 2 NA = 1984.5 → NA = 1984.5 / 2 → NA ≈ 992.25.

Wait, that can't be right. Because numerical aperture can't be that high. The maximum NA for oil immersion is about 1.4 or so. So getting 992 would suggest I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe the formula I'm using is wrong. Perhaps the correct formula is R (lines per mm) = 1000 * NA / λ (in nm). Because 1 mm is 10^3 μm or 1e6 nm. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is the resolving power R in lines per inch is given by R = (2 NA * 1 inch) / λ. Wait, but units aren't matching. Let's think about units.

The limit of resolution d is λ/(2 NA). So d is in meters. If d is the distance between two lines, then the number of lines per meter would be 1/d. So lines per meter = 2 NA / λ.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if d is the minimum separation, then lines per meter would be 1/d. So lines per meter = 2 NA / λ.

But the given value is lines per inch. So first, convert lines per inch to lines per meter.

So lines per inch = 112,000. Lines per meter = 112,000 * 39.37 ≈ 112,000 * 40 would be 4,480,000, but precise calculation: 39.37 * 112,000.

Let me compute 39.37 * 112,000.

Wait, 39.37 * 100,000 is 3,937,000. 39.37 *12,000 is 472,440. So total is 3,937,000 + 472,440 = 4,409,440 lines/meter.

So lines per meter is 4,409,440.

So according to the formula, lines per meter = 2 NA / λ.

Wait, λ is in meters. So λ is 4500 Angstroms = 4500e-10 m = 4.5e-7 m.

So lines per meter = (2 NA) / (4.5e-7 m) ) → 2 NA / 4.5e-7 = lines/m.

We have lines/m = 4,409,440.

So 2 NA / 4.5e-7 = 4,409,440 → NA = (4,409,440 * 4.5e-7) / 2.

Compute numerator: 4,409,440 * 4.5e-7.

Let me compute 4,409,440 * 4.5e-7.

4,409,440 * 4.5 = let's compute that first.

4,409,440 *4 = 17,637,760; 4,409,440 *0.5=2,204,720. So total 19,842,480.

Now multiply by 1e-7: 19,842,480e-7 = 198.4248.

So numerator is 198.4248. Divided by 2 gives NA = 99.2124? That's impossible because NA can't exceed ~1.5 for oil immersion.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait a second, perhaps the formula is R (lines per inch) = (2 NA) / (λ in inches). Let me think.

Because if d = λ/(2 NA), and d is in inches, then lines per inch would be 1/d = 2 NA / (λ in inches).

Wait, let's try this approach.

So, lines per inch R = 2 NA / λ (in inches).

Because λ is in inches in this formula.

So λ is 4500 Angstroms. 1 inch is 2.54 cm = 25,400 Angstroms.

So λ in inches is 4500 / 25,400 ≈ 0.17716 inches.

So R = 2 NA / 0.17716 inches.

Given R is 112,000 lines/inch, so:

112,000 = 2 NA / 0.17716 → 2 NA = 112,000 * 0.17716.

Compute that: 112,000 * 0.17716.

Well, 100,000 * 0.17716 =17,716.

12,000 * 0.17716 = 2,125.92.

So sum is 17,716 + 2,125.92 = 19,841.92.

So 2 NA = 19,841.92 → NA = 19,841.92 / 2 = 9,920.96. That's way too high. So that can't be right either.

Wait, I'm getting NA values over 9, which is impossible. So I must be using the wrong formula.

Let me go back. Maybe I should be using the formula for resolving power in terms of the wavelength and NA correctly.

The standard formula for the resolving power of a microscope is the limit of resolution d = λ/(2 NA). This d is the minimum distance between two points that can be distinguished.

The resolving power R is inversely proportional to d, so R = 1/d = 2 NA / λ.

But R should have units of lines per unit length. So if d is in meters, R is lines per meter.

Alternatively, sometimes R is given in lines per millimeter or per inch.

So perhaps the problem is giving R as 112,000 lines per inch, which needs to be converted into lines per meter, and then use R = 2 NA / λ, where λ is in meters.

So let's try that approach again.

λ = 450 nm = 450e-9 m.

R = 112,000 lines per inch. Convert that to lines per meter.

1 inch = 0.0254 meters. So lines per meter = 112,000 / 0.0254 ≈ 4,409,574 lines/m.

So R = 4,409,574 lines/m.

Using R = (2 NA) / λ,

So 4,409,574 = 2 NA / 450e-9.

Solving for NA:

NA = (4,409,574 * 450e-9) / 2.

Compute numerator: 4,409,574 * 450e-9 = ?

First compute 4,409,574 * 450.

4,409,574 * 400 = 1,763,829,600.

4,409,574 * 50 = 220,478,700.

Sum: 1,763,829,600 + 220,478,700 = 1,984,308,300.

Now multiply by 1e-9: 1,984,308,300e-9 = 1.9843083.

Divide by 2: NA ≈ 0.99215.

Hmm, that's about 0.992, which is close to 1. But oil immersion microscopes typically have NA around 1.3. So why am I getting approximately 0.99?

Wait, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Because sometimes the formula for R is R = (2 NA) / (λ in micrometers).

Wait, let me reconsider. Perhaps R is given in lines per millimeter. Let's try that approach.

R in lines per mm is 112,000 lines/inch / 25.4 mm/inch ≈ 4,409.84 lines/mm.

So R = 4,409.84 lines/mm.

The formula R (lines/mm) = (2 NA) / (λ in micrometers).

λ is 450 nm = 0.45 micrometers.

So plug in:

4,409.84 = 2 NA / 0.45 → 2 NA = 4,409.84 * 0.45 → 2 NA = 1,984.428 → NA ≈ 992.214. Wait, that's again way too high.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I should revisit the formula. Did I confuse resolving power with something else?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for telescope resolution with microscope. Let me double-check.

The resolving power (R) of a microscope is given by R = (2 NA) / λ, where R is in lines per meter. Alternatively, R might be expressed in lines per millimeter, but the units must match.

Wait, another approach: the limit of resolution, d = λ/(2 NA).

So d is the smallest distance that can be resolved. The number of lines per inch would be 1/d, because each line is separated by d inches.

Wait, no, the number of lines per inch is the inverse of d in inches. So if d is in meters, I'd have to convert to inches.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should find an alternative formula that directly relates lines per inch to NA.

I found a reference that the formula for resolving power (R) in lines per inch is R = (2 NA * 1000) / (λ in Angstroms). Let me check the units.

NA is unitless. λ in Angstroms (1e-10 m). 1000 is to convert mm to meters? Hmm, not sure. Let's try plugging the numbers.

R = 2 NA * 1000 / 4500.

Given R is 112,000.

So 112,000 = (2 NA * 1000) / 4500.

Multiply both sides by 4500:

112,000 * 4500 = 2 NA * 1000.

Calculate 112,000 * 4500 = 504,000,000.

So 504,000,000 = 2000 NA.

NA = 504,000,000 / 2000 = 252,000. That's way too high. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is R = (2 NA) / λ (in micrometers), and R is in lines per micrometer. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps R is given by R = (NA) * (1000) / (λ in nm). Because 1 mm is 1000 micrometers.

Wait, let me think in terms of units.

If R is lines per millimeter, then each line is spaced by (1 mm) / R lines. So the distance between lines is d = (1e-3 m) / R.

But the limit of resolution is d = λ/(2 NA). So:

(1e-3) / R = λ/(2 NA).

Rearranging:

R = (2 NA * 1e-3) / λ.

But λ is in meters, so 450 nm is 450e-9 m.

So R = (2 NA * 1e-3) / (450e-9).

Compute that:

(2 NA * 1e-3) / (450e-9) = (2 NA * 1e-3) / (4.5e-7) ) → denominator is 4.5e-7.

So 2 NA * 1e-3 = 2e-3 NA.

Divide by 4.5e-7: (2e-3 NA) / (4.5e-7) ) = (2/4.5) * (1e-3 / 1e-7) * NA → ≈ 0.444 * 1e4 * NA → 4444 * NA.

So R ≈ 4444 NA.

Given R is 112,000 lines per inch, which we earlier converted to about 4,409.84 lines per mm.

Wait, wait, if R is in lines per mm, then R = 4,409.84.

So 4,409.84 = 4444 NA → NA ≈ 4,409.84 / 4444 ≈ 0.992.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So NA is approximately 0.992. But that's not matching the oil-immersion NA, which is usually higher, like around 1.25 or 1.3.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, let me think again. Another source says that the resolving power R (lines per mm) is given by R = (2 NA) / λ (in mm). Because d = λ/(2 NA) in mm, so lines per mm would be 1/d = 2 NA / λ (mm).

Wait, λ in mm would be 450 nm = 450e-9 m = 450e-6 mm = 0.00045 mm.

So R = 2 NA / 0.00045 mm.

Given R is 4,409.84 lines/mm.

So 4,409.84 = 2 NA / 0.00045 → 2 NA = 4,409.84 * 0.00045 → 2 NA ≈ 1.984428 → NA ≈ 0.9922.

Same result again. So I keep getting about 0.99.

But wait, oil immersion microscopes typically have NA around 1.3. So perhaps I'm using the wrong value for λ. Oh wait, wait a second. The wavelength used in the formula is the wavelength in the medium, not in vacuum.

Because for oil immersion, the light travels through oil, which has a refractive index. So the effective wavelength λ' is λ0 / n, where n is the refractive index of the immersion oil.

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong. I forgot to account for the refractive index of the oil. So the correct formula should use λ' = λ0 / n.

So if the oil has a refractive index n, then the effective wavelength is shorter, which improves resolution.

So let me recast the formula with this in mind.

The correct formula for limit of resolution is d = λ/(2 n NA), where n is the refractive index of the medium (oil). Or wait, is it d = λ/(2 NA n)?

Wait, I think the correct formula is d = λ/(2 NA n), because the NA already accounts for the refractive index. Or perhaps NA = n sin θ, where θ is the half-angle of the cone of light entering the objective.

Wait, no, the formula for limit of resolution when using an immersion medium is d = λ/(2 n NA), but I think I might have that wrong. Alternatively, d = λ/(2 NA) when in a medium with refractive index
