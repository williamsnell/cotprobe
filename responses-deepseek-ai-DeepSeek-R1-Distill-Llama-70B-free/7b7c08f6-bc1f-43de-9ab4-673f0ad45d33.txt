Question:

A football player sued a football team for breach of contract. He was a star player for the team before suffering a serious hip injury. Although the player attempted to continue playing for the team, he failed a physical examination and was cut from the team roster. After failing his physical, the team discontinued making contract payments to the player as per the terms of his employment contract. In his lawsuit, the player claimed that he was physically fit to continue playing but that he was cut from the team because they wanted to stop making contract payments. At trial, the team called its physician, an orthopedist, to testify that the player's hip injury was, in fact, career-threatening and, in his opinion, sufficiently serious to warrant failing his physical. The team physician stated during his testimony that his diagnosis was based, in part, upon an examination of the player's x-rays and review of an MRI test conducted by another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results have been admitted into evidence. In all likelihood, the team physician's testimony should be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the team physician is not a radiologist capable of interpreting MRI results.
B: admissible, if the football player confirms that the physician's diagnosis was shared with him.
C: admissible, provided that the other doctor testifies as to the validity of the MRI test results.
D: admissible, provided that the team physician has been practicing for more than 10 years.
E: inadmissible, because the team physician's opinion was not based in part upon his own firsthand observation of the player's physical condition.
F: inadmissible, because neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results had been admitted into evidence at the time he formulated his opinion.
G: admissible, only if the x-rays and MRI test results are presented during the trial.
H: admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field.
I: inadmissible, as the team physician has a possible bias towards the football team.
J: inadmissible, because the team physician should have conducted the MRI test himself.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a physician's testimony in a trial. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is a football player suing his team for breach of contract. The player was cut after failing a physical, and the team stopped payments. The player claims he's fit, but the team says the injury was too severe. The team called their physician, an orthopedist, who testified that the player's hip injury was career-threatening. His diagnosis was based partly on x-rays and an MRI from another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor MRI results are in evidence.

The question is about whether the physician's testimony is admissible. The options are A through J.

So, the key issue here is whether the physician can testify based on x-rays and MRI results that aren't in evidence. I remember that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, expert opinions can be based on various sources, including reliable hearsay if it's the kind of information experts usually rely on in their practice.

Wait, FRE 703 comes into play here. It says that an expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been made aware of or personally observed. Importantly, the expert can rely on otherwise inadmissible information as long as it's the type of information that's reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. But there's a catch: if the facts or data are not admissible, the expert can't base the opinion on them unless they're of a type that's relied upon by experts.

So, in this case, the orthopedist is using x-rays and MRI results from another doctor. Are x-rays and MRI results the kind of data that orthopedists usually rely on? I think yes. Orthopedists regularly review imaging studies done by others, like radiologists. So, even if the x-rays and MRI haven't been admitted into evidence, the doctor can still rely on them for his opinion because that's standard practice.

Let me look at the options.

Option A says it's inadmissible because the physician isn't a radiologist. But orthopedists do interpret x-rays and MRIs as part of their practice, so this might not be correct.

Option B: Admissible if the player confirms the diagnosis was shared. That doesn't seem directly relevant to the admissibility of the physician's testimony based on the MRI and x-rays.

Option C: Admissible if the other doctor testifies. But under FRE 703, the other doctor's testimony isn't necessary if the data is the type that's reasonably relied upon.

Option D: Years of practice don't directly affect this unless it's about qualification, but the question is about the basis of the opinion, not the doctor's credentials.

Option E: Suggests the opinion wasn't based on firsthand observation. But the doctor did examine the player, so he has firsthand observation in addition to the tests.

Option F: Says inadmissible because the tests weren't admitted when he formed his opinion. Wait, but the physician's opinion was formed before trial, right? So during testimony, the fact that the tests weren't admitted yet might not matter because the expert can rely on them if they're the type of data that's usually relied upon.

Option G: Admissible only if the tests are presented. No, because under FRE 703, the underlying data doesn't need to be admitted if it's the right type.

Option H: Admissible if based on data other orthopedic physicians rely on. That aligns with FRE 703. So this looks correct.

Option I: Bias is a factor in credibility, not admissibility. The testimony isn't inadmissible because of bias; it's a matter for cross-examination.

Option J: Physician should have done the MRI himself. That's not required; experts can rely on others' tests.

So the correct answer should be H. The testimony is admissible as long as the data (x-rays and MRI) are the type that orthopedists reasonably rely on.

The question revolves around the admissibility of an orthopedist's testimony regarding a football player's injury. The orthopedist based his opinion, in part, on x-rays and MRI results that were not admitted into evidence. Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 703, an expert may base their opinion on facts or data that are not admitted into evidence, provided those facts or data are of the type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. 

In this case, the orthopedist relied on x-rays and MRI results, which are standard tools for orthopedists to assess injuries. Therefore, the testimony is admissible if the data (x-rays and MRI results) are the type that orthopedists in the field reasonably rely on. This aligns with Option H, which correctly reflects the application of FRE 703.

Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, and J either misinterpret the requirements for expert testimony or focus on irrelevant factors. For example, Option A incorrectly assumes only radiologists can interpret imaging, while Option H correctly identifies the standard for admissibility under FRE 703.
