Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about recursive procedures. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: Let P be a procedure that for some inputs calls itself, meaning it's recursive. And it's guaranteed to terminate. Now, I need to determine which of the statements I, II, III must be true.

The options are A to J, each combining different statements. So I need to analyze each statement.

Statement I: P has a local variable. Hmm. Do recursive procedures necessarily have local variables? Well, a local variable is a variable declared within the procedure. But can a recursive function not have any? For example, consider a simple recursive function like the factorial function. Wait, the standard factorial does have parameters and local variables for the result, but maybe a very simple case might not. Wait, no, because even if it's just one line, like if n == 0 return 1 else return n*fact(n-1), that function has a parameter n, but does it have a local variable? In some languages, functions might not require explicit declaration of variables beyond parameters. Wait, but if the function doesn't have any variables other than parameters, then statement I would be false. So I is not necessarily true. Because P could rely solely on parameters and not have any local variables. So statement I doesn't have to be true.

Statement II: P has an execution path where it does not call itself. Oh right, for a recursive function to terminate, it must have a base case. The base case is where it stops calling itself. So yes, any terminating recursive procedure must have at least one path that doesn't lead to another recursive call. So statement II must be true.

Statement III: P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter. Hmm. Let's think. Can a procedure be recursive without referring to any global variables and without any parameters? Well, wait, if a procedure is recursive, it's typically because it calls itself with different parameters. So it must have at least one parameter to pass varying arguments, right? Or does it?

Wait, maybe not. For example, if the procedure uses a global variable to keep track of state. Like, imagine a counter that's global. The function could increment the global variable each time it's called, and when it reaches a certain value, it stops. So in this case, the function doesn't have any parameters but refers to a global variable. So it's possible for P to have no parameters but refer to a global.

Alternatively, if the function has no parameters and doesn't refer to any global variables, can it be recursive and terminate? Hmm. Let's think: how would it know when to stop? If it has no parameters and no global variables, it can't change state between calls. So every call would be the same, leading to an infinite loop. But the question states that P is guaranteed to terminate, so this scenario can't happen. Therefore, P must have either parameters (so it can pass different values each time) or refer to a global variable (to change state between calls). So statement III must be true.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: could a function have both no parameters and no global variables, but still be recursive and terminate? Like, maybe it's a function that doesn't need to change state because it's tail-recursive and the base case is when some internal condition is met. Wait, but without any variables, how would that condition change? Because all local variables would have to be reinitialized each time. So for example, a function that just returns 1 without any conditions. That's not recursive though. If it's recursive, it's calling itself. So if it's a function that calls itself but has no parameters and no global variables, what's the base case? It would loop infinitely because there's no way to stop.

So yes, statement III must be true. Because if P has no parameters and doesn't refer to any global variables, it can't have a base case to stop recursion. So the procedure must either have parameters (so it can pass varying arguments, allowing the base case to trigger eventually) or refer to a global variable (to track state across calls). So statement III is correct.

So putting it together:

Statement I: Not necessarily true.
Statement II: Must be true.
Statement III: Must be true.

Now, looking at the options, which combinations fit?

The options are:

A: II only → No, because III is also true.
B: I and II only → No, since III is true.
C: II and III only → Yes, this fits.
D: Execution path without call and refers to global → Not sure, but D seems to be a specific scenario, not the general case.
E: I and III only → No.
F: None → No, because II and III are correct.
G: I only → No.
H: III only → No, because II is also correct.
I: All three → No, because I isn't necessarily true.
J: Local and global → Not necessarily.

So the correct answer is option C: II and III only.

To determine which statements must be true for a terminating recursive procedure \( P \), we analyze each statement:

1. **Statement I**: \( P \) has a local variable.  
   A recursive procedure does not necessarily require a local variable. It can rely solely on parameters or global variables. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.

2. **Statement II**: \( P \) has an execution path where it does not call itself.  
   For a recursive procedure to terminate, it must have a base case, which is an execution path where it does not call itself. This is essential to prevent infinite recursion. Thus, this statement must be true.

3. **Statement III**: \( P \) either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.  
   A terminating recursive procedure must have a way to change state between calls to eventually reach the base case. This can be achieved by having at least one parameter (to pass varying arguments) or by referring to a global variable (to track state across calls). Therefore, this statement must be true.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A: II only** → Incorrect, as III is also true.  
- **B: I and II only** → Incorrect, as III is true but I is not necessarily true.  
- **C: II and III only** → Correct, as both II and III must be true.  
- **D: Execution path without a call and refers to a global variable** → Incorrect, as this is a specific scenario, not the general case.  
- **E: I and III only** → Incorrect, as I is not necessarily true.  
- **F: None of the above** → Incorrect, as II and III are true.  
- **G: I only** → Incorrect, as I is not necessarily true.  
- **H: III only** → Incorrect, as II is also true.  
- **I: I, II, and III** → Incorrect, as I is not necessarily true.  
- **J: Local variable and global variable** → Incorrect, as this is not necessarily the case.

The correct answer is **C: II and III only**.
