Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about identifying which of the given bond options doesn't have the negative end written last. Hmm, I remember something about electronegativity and how it affects the order of writing elements in bond notation.

Wait, right! When two elements form a bond, the more electronegative one is usually written last because it tends to pull electrons towards itself. So in a covalent bond, the less electronegative atom is written first. But wait, there are exceptions, especially with hydrogen. Oh right, in bonds involving hydrogen, the H is written first, even if it's less electronegative. Because when H bonds with nonmetals like O, N, S, etc., those nonmetals are more electronegative. But wait, when H is bonded to something less electronegative than itself, like in metal hydrides, then the metal comes first. But in this question, the options are probably all nonmetals paired with H or other nonmetals.

Looking at the options:

Option A: H—O. So H is first, O is second. Oxygen is more electronegative than H, so O comes last. That makes sense because in H-O, O is the negative end.

Option B: P—Cl. Chlorine is more electronegative than phosphorus, so Cl comes last. So this follows the rule.

Option C: N—H. Nitrogen is more electronegative than H, so N is written last. So N—H, yes, correct.

Option D: C—H. Carbon is more electronegative than H? Wait, no. Wait, actually, H has about 2.2 electronegativity, and carbon is 2.55. Oh wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think again. Electronegativity values: H is around 2.2, C is 2.55, so C is more than H. So in C—H, the more electronegative (C) is written first, so the H is second. Wait, but wait, the question is about the negative end being last. So the more electronegative atom is the negative end. So in C—H, C is written first, and since it's more electronegative, the negative end is C, which is written first. So that would mean in C—H, the negative end (C) is first, not last. So this option doesn't have the negative end last. Hmm, that might be the answer.

But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Option E: S—O. Sulfur and oxygen. Oxygen is more electronegative, so O is written last. Correct.

Option F: C—O. Oxygen is more electronegative than C, so O is last. Correct.

Option G: Si—Cl. Chlorine is more electronegative than silicon, so Cl is last. Correct.

So the only option where the negative end is not written last is option D: C—H. Because in this case, carbon is more electronegative than H, so the negative end is C, which is written first, not last. So the correct answer would be option D.

To determine which bond does not have the negative end written last, we analyze the electronegativity of the elements in each option. The more electronegative element is typically written last in bond notation because it represents the negative end of the bond. Here's the breakdown:

- **A: H—O**  
  Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so oxygen is written last. This follows the rule.  

- **B: P—Cl**  
  Chlorine is more electronegative than phosphorus, so chlorine is written last. This follows the rule.  

- **C: N—H**  
  Nitrogen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so nitrogen is written last. This follows the rule.  

- **D: C—H**  
  Carbon is more electronegative than hydrogen, so carbon should be written last. However, in this case, carbon is written first, meaning the negative end (carbon) is not last. This does not follow the rule.  

- **E: S—O**  
  Oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, so oxygen is written last. This follows the rule.  

- **F: C—O**  
  Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so oxygen is written last. This follows the rule.  

- **G: Si—Cl**  
  Chlorine is more electronegative than silicon, so chlorine is written last. This follows the rule.  

The only option where the negative end is not written last is **D: C—H**.
