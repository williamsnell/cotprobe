Okay, so I've got this question here: "How many trees are there on 5 labeled vertices?" And there are a bunch of options to choose from. Hmm, I remember something about graph theory and trees. Let me think this through.

Wait, trees... right, in graph theory, a tree is a connected acyclic graph. So for labeled vertices, the number of trees depends on how the vertices are connected. Oh wait, Cayley's formula! I think that's the key here. Cayley's formula gives the number of labeled trees on n nodes.

What's Cayley's formula again? Oh right, it's n raised to the power of (n-2). So for n vertices, the number of trees is n^(n-2). Let me make sure I got that right. So for 3 vertices, it's 3^(3-2) = 3^1 = 3 trees. Yeah, that makes sense because for three labeled nodes, you can have each node as the center connected to the other two, so three different trees.

So applying this to the question where n is 5. Let me calculate that. 5^(5-2) = 5^3. 5 cubed is 125. So the number of trees should be 125.

Looking back at the options, option F is 125. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Oh right, sometimes I confuse it with the number of spanning trees in a complete graph, but no, for labeled trees, Cayley's formula is definitely n^(n-2).

Another way to think about it: for n=1, it's 1 tree (just a single node). For n=2, it's 1 tree (a single edge). For n=3, as I said, 3 trees. So for n=4, 4^2=16 trees. So n=5 would be 5^3=125. Yep, that lines up.

I think I'm confident with that. So the correct answer should be option F.

The question asks for the number of trees on 5 labeled vertices. To solve this, we use Cayley's formula, which states that the number of labeled trees on \( n \) vertices is given by \( n^{n-2} \). For \( n = 5 \), the calculation is:

\[
5^{5-2} = 5^3 = 125
\]

Thus, the number of trees on 5 labeled vertices is 125. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

F: 125

Answer: F
