Okay, so I've got this question about the role of frustration in human aggression. Let me think through this. I remember from my psychology classes that frustration is related to aggression, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. 

The question is multiple-choice, options A through J. I need to pick the correct one. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Frustration is a form of aggression. Hmm, no, I think frustration is more like a cause or a precursor, not the same as aggression itself. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Frustration leads to aggression only in people with a genetic predisposition to violence. Wait, I recall the idea that frustration can lead to aggression in many people, not just those genetically predisposed. So B might not be correct because it's too restrictive.

Option C: Frustration is always from external stimuli and never causes aggression. That doesn't sound right. I remember examples where frustration does lead to aggression, like someone being blocked from a goal. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Aggression happens spontaneously without frustration. No, I think frustration is a common trigger for aggression. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Frustration is unrelated to aggression and is only environmental. That can't be right because frustration is linked to aggression. E is wrong.

Option F: Frustration occurs when someone feels deprived of something they deserve, which may lead to aggression. This rings a bell. The frustration-aggression hypothesis suggests that when people are blocked from achieving their goals, they become frustrated and may act aggressively. So F sounds correct.

Option G: Frustration is a result of aggression. No, it's the other way around. Frustration leads to aggression, not the reverse. So G is wrong.

Option H: Aggression only happens in painful situations. That's too narrow. Aggression can come from various causes, not just pain. H is incorrect.

Option I: Frustration is a direct cause of aggression. Hmm, I think it's more that frustration can lead to aggression, but it's not a direct cause for everyone. There might be other factors involved, like how someone copes. So I might not be the right choice.

Option J: Aggression is always a conscious choice, and frustration is minor. No, I think aggression can sometimes be impulsive, not always a conscious decision. Plus, frustration plays a significant role, not minor. So J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. It correctly describes frustration as arising from feeling deprived of something deserved and potentially leading to aggression.

The correct answer is F. Frustration arises when a person feels deprived of something they believe they deserve, and this can lead to aggression. This aligns with the frustration-aggression hypothesis, which posits that blocked goals or unmet expectations can trigger aggressive behavior.

Answer: F
