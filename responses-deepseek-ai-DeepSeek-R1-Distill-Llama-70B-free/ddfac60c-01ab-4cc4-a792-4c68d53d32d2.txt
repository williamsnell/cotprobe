Question:

A college student owns an expensive sports car. His friend called him up one afternoon and asked to borrow his car for a date he had that night. The college student generously lent the car to his friend. On his way home from the date, basking in the memories of a beautiful evening, the friend lost control of the car and hit a pedestrian. As a result of the accident, and after learning that the friend had no money and no insurance, the pedestrian brought suit against the college student to recover for his injuries. He asserted a claim against the college student for negligent entrustment of a vehicle. During his case, the pedestrian introduced evidence that the friend had been in several previous accidents. In his defense, the college student offered the testimony of his girlfriend that the college student frequently lent his car to his friend. The girlfriend further testified that the college student gave his friend permission to use his car only after determining that the friend was a careful and attentive driver. The girlfriend's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as evidence of the friend's driving skill.
B: inadmissible, because it's irrelevant to the case.
C: admissible as a present sense impression.
D: inadmissible, because it's hearsay.
E: inadmissible, because it's opinion testimony.
F: admissible as a past recollection recorded.
G: admissible as character evidence.
H: admissible as evidence of habit.
I: inadmissible, because she is biased.
J: inadmissible, because it goes to the college student's character.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about negligent entrustment. Let me start by understanding the scenario. 

So, there's a college student who owns an expensive sports car. His friend asks to borrow it for a date, and the student lends it. The friend ends up hitting a pedestrian, who then sues the student for negligent entrustment. 

The pedestrian's case probably hinges on showing that the student was negligent in lending the car. The friend had several previous accidents, which the pedestrian introduced as evidence. That makes sense because prior accidents could indicate that the friend is a dangerous driver, so the student shouldn't have trusted him with the car.

Now, the student's defense is that he only lent the car after checking that his friend was a careful and attentive driver. To support this, he offers his girlfriend's testimony. She says that the student frequently lent his car to the friend and that he only did so after determining the friend was careful.

The question is about the admissibility of the girlfriend's testimony. Specifically, she testifies about how the student determined the friend's driving ability. I need to determine which option correctly classifies her testimony.

Let me break down the options. The options involve evidence rules, so I need to recall those. The main issues here are hearsay, habit, character evidence, and relevance.

First, the girlfriend's testimony is about what the student did each time before lending the car. She's testifying that every time, he checked that the friend was careful. That sounds like habit evidence because habit is about a person's regular response to a specific situation. Habit is admissible under FRE 406, I think. So if the student had a habit of checking the friend's driving before lending the car, that could be relevant to show he acted carefully.

But wait, the student is testifying through his girlfriend. She's recounting what he did on each occasion. So is her testimony hearsay? Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. If she's recounting what the student said or thought, that might be hearsay. But if she's testifying about his actions, which she observed, that's not hearsay.

Wait, the girlfriend's testimony is about the student's actions, not his statements. She says he gave permission only after determining the friend was careful. So she's describing his behavior, which would be admissible as evidence of his habit. Because habit evidence is about regular practice, and she's testifying that he regularly did this.

So looking at the options, option H says admissible as evidence of habit. Option A says admissible as evidence of the friend's driving skill. But the girlfriend isn't testifying about the friend's actual skill, she's testifying about the student's process of determining it. So A is about the friend's skill, which isn't directly what she's testifying to.

Option D says inadmissible because it's hearsay. But she's not quoting the student's words; she's describing his actions. So it's not hearsay. So D is incorrect.

Option G is about character evidence. But the testimony isn't about the student's character in general, it's about his specific habit when lending the car. So G is probably not the right choice.

Option B says it's inadmissible because irrelevant. But the testimony is relevant because it goes to whether the student acted negligently. If he had a habit of checking, that's relevant to his defense. So B is incorrect.

Option E is about opinion testimony, but the girlfriend isn't giving an opinion; she's stating what she observed the student do.

Option C is present sense impression, which requires the statement to be made while perceiving an event or immediately after. That doesn't apply here because she's testifying about past actions, not something she said at the time.

Option F is about past recollection recorded, which requires a writing made at the time, which isn't the case here.

Options I and J are about bias and character, respectively. The girlfriend's testimony isn't about her own bias, and it's not character evidence about the student. It's about his habit.

So putting it all together, the girlfriend's testimony is about the student's regular practice of checking the friend's driving before lending the car. That's habit evidence under FRE 406, which is admissible. So the correct answer should be H: admissible as evidence of habit.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the girlfriend's testimony in a negligent entrustment case. The college student lent his car to his friend, who later caused an accident. The pedestrian sued the student, alleging negligent entrustment, and introduced evidence of the friend's previous accidents. The student defended by offering his girlfriend's testimony that he only lent the car after determining the friend was a careful driver. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible and, if so, under what evidentiary rule.

The girlfriend's testimony describes the student's regular practice of checking the friend's driving ability before lending the car. This is not hearsay because she is testifying about the student's observable actions, not his out-of-court statements. It is also relevant because it pertains to the student's defense against negligent entrustment. The testimony does not involve opinion testimony, present sense impressions, or past recollection recorded. Additionally, it is not character evidence or biased testimony.

The correct classification of the testimony is as evidence of habit under Federal Rule of Evidence 406, which allows testimony about a person's regular response to a specific situation. This makes the testimony admissible to show the student's consistent practice of ensuring the friend was a careful driver before lending the car.
