Okay, so I've got this double integral to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The problem is to calculate the double integral of y dxdy over a region S, where y is greater than 0. S is a semicircle with diameter 1, centered at the point C(1/2, 0), and it's above the X-axis.

Hmm, first, I remember that when dealing with double integrals, especially over regions that are circles or semicircles, using polar coordinates can make things easier. So the question mentions switching to polar coordinates, which is probably the way to go.

Let me recall how to convert to polar coordinates. The transformations are x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. The Jacobian determinant for the transformation is r, so dxdy becomes r dr dθ. So the integral becomes the integral of y * r dr dθ.

Wait, but the original integral is ∫∫ y dx dy. So substituting in polar, y is r sinθ, and dx dy is r dr dθ. So the integrand becomes y * r dr dθ, which is r sinθ * r dr dθ. So that would be r² sinθ dr dθ. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure: the original integral is y dx dy. So in polar, that's (r sinθ) * r dr dθ, because dx dy is r dr dθ. So the integrand becomes r sinθ * r dr dθ, which simplifies to r² sinθ dr dθ.

Now, I need to set up the limits for r and θ. The region S is a semicircle above the X-axis, with diameter 1, centered at (1/2, 0). Let me visualize this. The diameter is 1, so the radius is 1/2. The center is at (1/2, 0), so the semicircle lies above the X-axis, spanning from (0,0) to (1,0) as the diameter.

Wait, no. Wait, the diameter is from (0,0) to (1,0), because the center is at (1/2, 0), and the radius is 1/2. So the semicircle is the upper half of that circle.

In Cartesian coordinates, the equation of the circle would be (x - 1/2)^2 + y^2 = (1/2)^2. Expanding that, (x^2 - x + 1/4) + y^2 = 1/4, so x^2 - x + y^2 = 0. Hmm, but I might not need that for polar coordinates.

In polar coordinates, the equation of a circle not centered at the origin can be a bit tricky. Let's see. The general equation of a circle in polar coordinates, when the center is at (a, 0), is r = 2a cosθ. Wait, because in Cartesian, the circle is (x - a)^2 + y^2 = a^2. Expanding that: x² - 2a x + a² + y² = a² → x² + y² = 2a x. In polar, x = r cosθ, so r² = 2a r cosθ → r = 2a cosθ. So for our case, a is 1/2, so r = 2*(1/2) cosθ = cosθ. So the equation in polar is r = cosθ.

Wait, but the semicircle is the upper half, so θ will range from -π/2 to π/2, because when θ is 0, r is 1 (cos0=1), and when θ is π/2, r is 0, and similarly for -π/2. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the center is at (1/2, 0), and the circle has radius 1/2, so the circle touches the origin (0,0) when θ is π/2. Hmm, maybe I should sketch it mentally. At θ=0, the point is (r,0), and the maximum r is 1, but wait, no, because when θ is 0, the circle equation gives r = cos0 = 1. But in our case, the center is at (1/2, 0), so perhaps the limits are from θ = -π/2 to θ=π/2, and r from 0 to cosθ. Because when θ is π/2, cosθ is 0, so r goes from 0 to 0, but that's just the origin. Wait, maybe I need to think about it differently.

Wait, for the circle centered at (a, 0) with radius a, the polar equation is r = 2a cosθ. So in our case, a is 1/2, so r = 2*(1/2) cosθ = cosθ. So the circle is described by r = cosθ, and θ ranges from -π/2 to π/2 because beyond that, cosθ becomes negative, but since r can't be negative, those angles would not be part of the circle.

So the semicircle we're considering is the upper half of this circle, so y is positive, which in polar terms means that r sinθ is positive, so sinθ is positive. That happens when θ is between 0 and π. Wait, but wait, the equation r = cosθ is valid only for θ between -π/2 and π/2 because beyond that, cosθ is negative, and r can't be negative. So in this case, the region S is the part of the circle where y ≥ 0, which would be from θ = 0 to θ = π/2. Wait, no. Because for the circle centered at (1/2, 0), the upper semicircle would be where θ ranges from -π/2 to π/2, but only the part where y is positive, so maybe θ goes from 0 to π/2, and the lower part from -π/2 to 0. But in this problem, since y > 0, we're only considering the upper part, so θ from 0 to π/2, and r from 0 to cosθ.

Wait, but let me confirm. If I take θ from -π/2 to π/2, that covers the entire circle, but the upper half would require that y is positive, so sinθ is positive. So θ from 0 to π/2 would cover the right upper part, and θ from -π/2 to 0 would cover the left upper part. So together, θ from -π/2 to π/2, but with r from 0 to cosθ. But since y is positive, we need to include all points where r sinθ is positive, which is when θ is between 0 and π/2 and between -π/2 and 0, but sinθ is positive in both cases. Wait, no: sinθ is positive from 0 to π, and negative from π to 2π. So in the range -π/2 to π/2, sinθ is positive from 0 to π/2 and negative from -π/2 to 0. But in our case, we want y > 0, so we need sinθ positive, which happens when θ is between 0 and π/2. So the limits of θ are from 0 to π/2, and for each θ, r goes from 0 to cosθ.

Wait, but wait, if θ is between 0 and π/2, then cosθ is positive, and r goes from 0 to cosθ, which would cover the right half of the circle. But the semicircle is the upper half, which includes both the right and left sides. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the circle is centered at (1/2, 0) with radius 1/2. So in Cartesian, the circle touches (0,0) and (1,0), and the top of the circle is at (1/2, 1/2). So the semicircle above the X-axis is the upper half of this circle.

In polar coordinates, the equation is r = cosθ, as we derived earlier. So for each θ, r goes from 0 to cosθ, but only where cosθ is positive. So cosθ is positive when θ is between -π/2 and π/2. But since we're considering y ≥ 0, which is sinθ ≥ 0, that occurs when θ is between 0 and π. So the region we're interested in is where θ is between 0 and π/2, and r from 0 to cosθ. Because beyond θ = π/2, cosθ becomes negative, and r can't be negative. Wait, but that doesn't include the left part of the semicircle. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait another approach. Let me parameterize the region S. Since it's a semicircle above the X-axis with diameter from (0,0) to (1,0), the parametric equations in Cartesian would be x = 1/2 + (1/2) cosφ, y = (1/2) sinφ, where φ ranges from 0 to π. Then, converting to polar coordinates, I can express r and θ in terms of φ. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to stick with the limits I have.

So, the integral in polar becomes ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) ∫ (r=0 to cosθ) [r² sinθ] dr dθ.

So let me set up the integral:

I = ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) [ ∫ (r=0 to cosθ) r² dr ] sinθ dθ.

First, compute the inner integral with respect to r:

∫ r² dr from 0 to cosθ is [ (r^3)/3 ] from 0 to cosθ = (cos^3θ)/3.

So now the integral becomes:

I = ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) [ (cos^3θ)/3 ] * sinθ dθ.

Simplify this:

I = (1/3) ∫ (0 to π/2) cos^3θ sinθ dθ.

Hmm, this integral can be solved with substitution. Let me let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ. So when θ=0, u=1; when θ=π/2, u=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

I = (1/3) ∫ (u=1 to 0) u^3 (-du) = (1/3) ∫ (0 to1) u^3 du.

Because the negative sign flips the limits.

So this is:

I = (1/3) * [ (u^4)/4 ] evaluated from 0 to1 = (1/3) * (1/4 - 0) )= 1/12.

Wait, but 1/12 is approximately 0.0833. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 0.0833. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check my steps again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, the original integral was ∫∫ y dx dy, which in polar is ∫∫ (r sinθ) * r dr dθ, because dx dy is r dr dθ. So the integrand becomes r^2 sinθ dr dθ. So yes, that part is correct.

Setting up the limits: θ from 0 to π/2, r from 0 to cosθ. That seems correct because for each θ in that range, r goes from 0 to the circle's boundary at r=cosθ.

Then, the integral I becomes the double integral as set up. Then the inner integral over r is correct, giving (cos^3θ)/3.

Then, the substitution u = cosθ, du = -sinθ dθ, which changes the integral to ∫ u^3 (-du) from u=1 to u=0, which becomes ∫ from 0 to1 of u^3 du. That evaluates to [u^4/4] from 0 to1, which is 1/4. Then, multiplying by 1/3 gives 1/12, which is approximately 0.0833.

So the correct answer should be option G, which is 0.0833.

Wait, but just to make sure, let's think about the region again. Another way to approach this is to compute the integral in Cartesian coordinates to see if we get the same result.

In Cartesian, y ranges from 0 to the semicircle. The equation of the circle is (x - 1/2)^2 + y^2 = (1/2)^2. Solving for y, we get y = sqrt( (1/2)^2 - (x - 1/2)^2 ).

So the integral becomes ∫ (x=0 to 1) ∫ (y=0 to sqrt(1/4 - (x - 1/2)^2 )) y dy dx.

Let's compute the inner integral first: ∫ y dy from 0 to Y is Y^2 / 2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (x=0 to1) [ (sqrt(1/4 - (x - 1/2)^2 ))^2 ] / 2 dx.

Simplify sqrt squared: it's just the argument, so (1/4 - (x - 1/2)^2 ) / 2.

So the integral is ∫ (0 to1) [ (1/4 - (x^2 - x + 1/4)) ] / 2 dx.

Wait, expanding (x - 1/2)^2: x^2 - x + 1/4.

So 1/4 - (x^2 - x + 1/4) = 1/4 - x^2 + x -1/4 = x - x^2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (0 to1) (x - x^2)/2 dx = (1/2) ∫ (0 to1) (x - x^2) dx.

Compute the integral:

∫ x dx = x²/2, ∫ x^2 dx = x^3/3. Evaluated from 0 to1:

(1/2)( [ (1/2 - 1/3) ] ) = (1/2)( (3/6 - 2/6) ) = (1/2)(1/6) )= 1/12.

So yes, same result as before, 1/12, which is 0.0833, so option G.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.

To calculate the double integral $\iint_S y \, dx \, dy$ over the region $S$, where $S$ is the upper half of a semicircle with diameter 1 centered at $(1/2, 0)$, we proceed as follows:

1. **Convert to Polar Coordinates**:  
   The transformations are $x = r \cos\theta$, $y = r \sin\theta$, and $dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta$. Substituting $y = r \sin\theta$, the integrand becomes $y \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta = r^2 \sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta$.

2. **Determine the Limits for $r$ and $\theta$**:  
   The semicircle is centered at $(1/2, 0)$ with radius $1/2$. In polar coordinates, the equation of the circle is $r = \cos\theta$. Since we are considering the upper half of the circle (where $y > 0$), $\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $\pi/2$, and for each $\theta$, $r$ ranges from $0$ to $\cos\theta$.

3. **Set Up the Integral**:  
   The integral becomes:  
   \[
   I = \int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2} \int_{r=0}^{\cos\theta} r^2 \sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Evaluate the Inner Integral**:  
   First, integrate with respect to $r$:  
   \[
   \int_{r=0}^{\cos\theta} r^2 \, dr = \left[\frac{r^3}{3}\right]_{r=0}^{\cos\theta} = \frac{\cos^3\theta}{3}.
   \]

5. **Evaluate the Outer Integral**:  
   Substitute the result of the inner integral:  
   \[
   I = \int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos^3\theta}{3} \sin\theta \, d\theta.
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{3} \int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2} \cos^3\theta \sin\theta \, d\theta.
   \]

6. **Use Substitution**:  
   Let $u = \cos\theta$, so $du = -\sin\theta \, d\theta$. When $\theta = 0$, $u = 1$; when $\theta = \pi/2$, $u = 0$. The integral becomes:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{3} \int_{u=1}^{0} u^3 (-du) = \frac{1}{3} \int_{u=0}^{1} u^3 \, du.
   \]

7. **Evaluate the Integral**:  
   Compute $\int u^3 \, du$:  
   \[
   \int u^3 \, du = \frac{u^4}{4}.
   \]  
   Evaluate from $0$ to $1$:  
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{3} \left[\frac{u^4}{4}\right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{12}.
   \]

8. **Final Answer**:  
   The value of the integral is $\frac{1}{12} \approx 0.0833$, which corresponds to option **G**.
