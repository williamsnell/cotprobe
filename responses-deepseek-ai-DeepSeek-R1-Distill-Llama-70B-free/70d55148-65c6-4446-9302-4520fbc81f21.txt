Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the fugacity of water at 298 K and a pressure of 10^7 N/m². I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

First, I remember that fugacity is a concept used in thermodynamics, especially for real gases. It's kind of like the effective pressure a real gas exerts, taking into account its non-ideal behavior. For an ideal gas, fugacity equals pressure, but real gases can differ.

Wait, the question gives me the vapor pressure of water at 298 K as 3,160 N/m². Oh, right, vapor pressure is the pressure at which the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium at a given temperature. So that might be the saturation pressure.

Now, the problem states the pressure is 10^7 N/m². That's a really high pressure, way above atmospheric. Water at such high pressures is a compressed liquid, I think. So the fugacity in this case would be higher than the vapor pressure because the liquid is under pressure.

Wait, but wait. How do I calculate fugacity? I'm a bit foggy on the exact formula. I think for liquids, the fugacity can be approximated using the Poynting correction, especially when the pressure is much higher than the vapor pressure. The formula is something like f = P * exp( (P - P_sat) * V / (R T) ), where P_sat is the vapor pressure. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Let me try to recall. The Poynting factor accounts for the effect of pressure on fugacity for a liquid. The equation is:

f = φ * P_sat

Where φ is the fugacity coefficient. For a compressed liquid, the fugacity coefficient can be approximated using:

ln φ = (P - P_sat) * V_l / (R T)

Here, V_l is the molar volume of the liquid. Wait, or is it the specific volume? Hmm. Since the formula uses molar volume, I think it's V_l in m³ per kg mol.

Wait, the given data includes the density (rho) of water as 997 kg/m³ and the molecular weight (MW) as 18.02 kg/kg mol. So I can calculate the molar volume. Molar volume V_l = MW / rho.

Let me compute that. V_l = 18.02 kg/kg mol / 997 kg/m³. Let's calculate that.

18.02 / 997 is approximately 0.01807 m³/kg mol. Because 997 is close to 1000, so 18/1000 is 0.018, so that's about right.

Now, R is the gas constant. I think R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Oh wait, but the units here are in N/m², which is equivalent to Pascals, and J is m³·Pa. Let me make sure the units are consistent.

So, (P - P_sat) is 10^7 N/m² - 3160 N/m². Wait, 10^7 is 10,000,000 Pa. So 10,000,000 minus 3160 is approximately 9,968,840 Pa.

Multiply that by V_l (m³ per mol) divided by (R*T). Let me plug in the numbers.

(P - P_sat) = 10^7 - 3160 = approx 9,968,840 Pa.

V_l is 0.01807 m³/mol.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K) because 1 J = 1 m³·Pa.

T is 298 K.

So the term is (9,968,840 Pa) * (0.01807 m³/mol) / (8.314 * 298).

Let me compute the denominator first: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.772.

Now the numerator: 9,968,840 * 0.01807 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 9,968,840 * 0.01 = 99,688.4

Then 9,968,840 * 0.00807 ≈ let's see. 9,968,840 * 0.008 = 79,750.72, and 0.00007 * 9,968,840 is about 697.819. So total is 79,750.72 + 697.819 ≈ 80,448.539.

Adding the two parts: 99,688.4 + 80,448.539 = 180,136.939.

So the term is 180,136.939 / 2477.772 ≈ let's compute this.

Well, 2477.772 * 72 = approx 178,000 (since 2477.77 *70=173,444, and 2*2477.77=4955.54 → 173,444 + 4,955.54 =178,399.54). 180,136.939 -178,399.54 ≈ 1,737.4.

So 72 + (1,737.4 / 2477.772) ≈ 72 + ~0.7 → 72.7.

Wait that's a problem because 72.7 is a large exponent, but wait, taking the natural log and exponentiating it would make the fugacity coefficient really big. But wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again because that seems way too high.

Wait, no, I think I messed up the units. Because (P - P_sat) is in Pa, V_l is in m³/mol, R is in m³·Pa/(mol·K), T is in K. So the units for (P - P_sat) * V_l / (R T) would be (Pa * m³/mol) / (Pa·m³/(mol·K) * K) ) → (Pa·m³/mol) / (Pa·m³/mol) → dimensionless, as it should be.

So the calculation of the exponent is correct.

Wait, but 9.9688e6 * 0.01807 = let me compute that more accurately.

9,968,840 * 0.01807 = ?

Let me compute 9,968,840 * 0.01 = 99,688.4.

9,968,840 * 0.008 = 79,750.72.

9,968,840 * 0.00007 = 697.8188.

Adding them: 99,688.4 + 79,750.72 = 179,439.12 + 697.8188 ≈ 180,136.9388.

So 180,136.9388 / (8.314 * 298) = 180,136.9388 / 2477.772 ≈ let me calculate.

So 2477.772 * 72 = 2477.772 *70=173,444.04 → 2477.772 *2=4,955.544 → total 178,399.584.

The remainder is 180,136.9388 - 178,399.584 ≈ 1,737.3548.

1,737.3548 / 2477.772 → approx 0.7015.

So the total is about 72.7015.

So ln φ ≈ 72.7015 → φ ≈ e^72.7 → wait, that's a gigantic number, which doesn't make sense. Fugacity can't be that high. I must have made a mistake in calculations somewhere.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh no, I think I messed up the formula. Because the formula for the fugacity of a compressed liquid is:

f = P_sat * exp( (P - P_sat) * V_l / (R T) )

Wait, but if the pressure is much higher than the saturation pressure, this term may be positive, making f much larger than P_sat. But in the options, the highest is 10,000 N/m², which is 1e7, but wait, the given pressure is 1e7 N/m². But wait, let me think again.

Wait another thought: Wait, the formula I'm thinking of is for the fugacity of the liquid. But in this problem, are we considering the fugacity of the liquid or the vapor? Hmm. The question says "fugacity of water". At 298 K and 1e7 N/m², which is way above the vapor pressure, so the water is liquid.

So, for the liquid, the fugacity is calculated as f = φ * P_sat, where φ is calculated using that exponent.

Wait, but if the exponent is so high, then φ would be e^72.7, which is an astronomically large number. That can't be possible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait maybe the formula is (P - P_sat) * V_l / (R T), but maybe that's for the vapor phase. Or perhaps I'm confusing the formula for the liquid phase fugacity.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Let me think. For a compressed liquid, the fugacity is approximated as f ≈ P_sat * exp( (P - P_sat) V_l / (R T) )

Yes, that's the correct approximation. But if (P - P_sat) is positive and large, this leads to a large exponent.

But wait, let me compute the exponent again. Perhaps I made a calculation error.

So P is 1e7 N/m², which is 10,000,000 Pa.

P_sat is 3160 Pa.

So P - P_sat = 9,968,840 Pa.

V_l is 0.01807 m³/mol.

So (P - P_sat) * V_l = 9,968,840 * 0.01807 → 180,136.9388 Pa·m³/mol.

Divide by R*T: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.772 J/mol → 2477.772 Pa·m³/mol.

So 180,136.9388 / 2477.772 ≈ 72.7.

So the exponent is 72.7. So φ = e^72.7 ≈ a very big number.

But that would make the fugacity f = 3160 * e^72.7, which is way beyond any of the options given, which are up to 10,000. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Maybe the correct formula uses the specific volume instead of molar volume?

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula uses the specific volume (volume per mass) instead of molar volume. Let me check that.

Wait, specific volume is V = 1/rho = 0.001003 m³/kg (since rho is 997 kg/m³ → 1/997 ≈ 0.001003 m³/kg). But then, when using specific volume, we need to multiply by molecular weight to get molar volume.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses the specific volume multiplied by the molecular weight. Because in some derivations, the formula is expressed in terms of specific volume.

Wait, reviewing the formula: The Poynting factor for liquids is given by ln φ = integral from P_sat to P of (V_l / V_g - Z_l) dP, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, another approximation when P >> P_sat and for liquids, the molar volume is much smaller than the gas, so an approximation is used where V_l is considered constant.

Wait, perhaps the correct term is (P - P_sat) * V_l / (R T), but maybe I should use the specific volume multiplied by the molecular weight to get V_l.

Wait, I think I did that correctly. Let me double-check the calculation of V_l. Rho is 997 kg/m³, MW is 18.02 kg/kg mol.

So V_l = MW / rho = 18.02 kg/kg mol / 997 kg/m³ → 18.02 / 997 ≈ 0.01807 m³/kg mol → correct.

Hmm. So the exponent is correct. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm applying the wrong approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the vapor phase, not the liquid phase. But at 1e7 N/m², the pressure is way above the vapor pressure, so the water would be liquid. So the fugacity would be for the liquid.

But according to my calculation, the fugacity is way higher than any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use the ideal gas law for the vapor and calculate the fugacity as the vapor pressure multiplied by the activity. Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, another method to find fugacity is using f = φ * P, where φ is the fugacity coefficient. But that's for gases. For liquids, we have different approaches.

Alternatively, perhaps for highly compressed liquids, the fugacity is approximated by the vapor pressure. But that doesn't make sense because under high pressure, the fugacity should be higher.

Wait, let me think about the definition of fugacity. Fugacity is a measure that corrects the ideal behavior. For a compressed liquid, the fugacity is higher than the vapor pressure. The options given include 3160 N/m², which is the vapor pressure. So if the pressure is higher, the fugacity should be higher than 3160.

Looking at the options, the higher options are E (4000), D (3400), etc. Option G is 3160, which is the vapor pressure.

So if the pressure is above the vapor pressure, the fugacity should be higher than 3160. So the correct answer can't be G.

But according to my calculation, the exponent leads to a much higher value, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the fugacity of a compressed liquid, which is f = P_sat * exp( (P - P_sat) * V_l / (R T) )

Wait, let me try to compute the exponent again.

(P - P_sat) = 1e7 Pa - 3160 Pa ≈ 9,968,840 Pa.

V_l = 0.01807 m³/mol.

R*T = 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.77 J/mol.

So (9,968,840) * 0.01807 = 180,136.9388 Pa·m³/mol.

Divide by 2477.77: 180,136.9388 / 2477.77 ≈ let me compute this accurately.

2477.77 * 72 = 2477.77 * 70 = 173,443.9, 2477.77 *2=4,955.54 → total 178,399.44.

So 180,136.9388 -178,399.44 = 1,737.4988.

Now, 1,737.4988 / 2477.77 ≈ 0.701.

So ln φ ≈ 72.701 → φ ≈ e^72.701 ≈ a huge number, which can't be right because none of the options are even close.

So I must have made a mistake. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using isn't correct for such a high pressure. Maybe the approximation breaks down because the pressure is extremely high.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fugacity of the vapor phase, but that doesn't make sense because at 1e7 Pa, the vapor would condense into liquid.

Wait another angle: Perhaps the given pressure is 10^7 Pa, but maybe I should compute the reduced pressure and see if the fluid is a gas or liquid. The critical pressure of water is much higher than 10^7 Pa. Wait, no, the critical pressure of water is about 22.06 MPa, which is 22,060,000 Pa. So 10^7 Pa is 10 MPa, which is less than critical pressure, so at 298 K, which is below the critical temperature of water (which is around 374°C or 647 K), so water can exist as liquid or gas depending on pressure.

At 298 K and 10 MPa, water is supercritical? No, because the critical point is at higher temperature. So at 298 K, the pressure of 10 MPa is above the vapor pressure, so it's a compressed liquid.

Wait, but my earlier calculation leads to an exponent of 72, which is way too high. So perhaps the correct approach is to assume that for a compressed liquid, the fugacity is approximately equal to the vapor pressure multiplied by the Poynting factor, and that the Poynting factor is close to 1, making the fugacity near the vapor pressure. But that doesn't fit because the pressure is much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use Henry's law or Raoult's law. Raoult's law states that the fugacity is equal to the mole fraction times the vapor pressure. But for pure water, mole fraction is 1, so f = P_sat. But that would imply f = 3160 N/m², which is option G.

Wait, but that's only true if the pressure is not too high, and the liquid behaves ideally. This is called the ideal solution behavior, where fugacity equals P_sat.

But when the pressure is significantly higher than the vapor pressure, the liquid's fugacity increases beyond P_sat. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the Poynting correction.

But according to that, the fugacity is much higher than any of the options, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use the ideal gas law to compute the fugacity. Let's try that.

Wait, but if the water is a compressed liquid, the ideal gas law doesn't apply. So that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into using the vapor pressure as the fugacity, which would be option G. But that would be the case only if pressure equals the vapor pressure, but here it's much higher.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me look up the correct formula for fugacity of a compressed liquid.

Upon checking (hypothetically, since I can't access external resources), the fugacity of a compressed liquid can be approximated by:

f = P_sat * exp( (P - P_sat) * V_l / (R T) )

Yes, that's correct. So with the given numbers, the exponent is positive, leading to f > P_sat.

But according to my calculation, the exponent is 72.7, which is way too big. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I should use specific volume in m³/kg instead of per mole. Let me try that.

Specific volume v = 1/rho = 1/997 ≈ 0.001003 m³/kg.

But then, to get molar volume, multiply by
