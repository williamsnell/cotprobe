Question:

A graduate of law school received notice that she had successfully passed the bar exam. To celebrate passing, the graduate went out with a few friends to a popular campus bar. The graduate's friend ordered a round of Hula Girls for everyone. A Hula Girl is an extremely potent alcoholic drink consisting. of 2 ounces of dry gin, 1 ounce of French vermouth, and 1 teaspoon of grenadine. After the drink is mixed, it is then served in a glass with an inverted lemon peel, which is cut at the ends to represent a grass skirt. Although the graduate had never heard of a Hula Girl, she was in a festive mood and drank it, anyway. A few minutes later, the graduate became very dizzy and attempted to stand up from the barstool. As she tried to walk to the restroom, she became nauseated and vomited over a customer sitting at a nearby table. The customer was embarrassed and greatly humiliated by the incident. If the customer asserts a claim against the graduate, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the graduate should have known the effects of the drink.
B: not prevail, because the graduate's actions were involuntary.
C: prevail, because an offensive touching resulted.
D: prevail, because the graduate acted negligently by drinking too much.
E: not prevail, because the graduate also suffered as a result of the drink.
F: prevail, because the graduate's conduct was extreme and outrageous.
G: not prevail, because it was the bartender who served the drink.
H: not prevail, because the graduate was unaware what she was drinking.
I: prevail, because the graduate's actions caused emotional distress.
J: not prevail, because the graduate did not intend to harm the customer.

Okay, so I've got this law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is about a law graduate who passed the bar and went out to celebrate. She went to a bar with friends, and one of them ordered a round of Hula Girls. The Hula Girl is a potent drink made with gin, vermouth, and grenadine. The graduate had never heard of it but drank it anyway. A few minutes later, she became dizzy, tried to stand, and then vomited on a nearby customer, causing embarrassment and humiliation. Now, the customer is suing the graduate. The question is about whether the customer (plaintiff) will prevail.

The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason. I need to determine which is correct.

First, I should think about the possible legal claims the customer might have. The most likely claims here would be negligence or battery. Let's consider each.

Battery is an intentional tort where there's harmful or offensive contact with another person. For battery, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted intentionally to cause harmful contact. In this case, the graduate vomited on the customer. But was this intentional? She was intoxicated and lost control. Intoxication can sometimes negate intent, but it's not a blanket excuse. However, if her vomiting was an involuntary action due to being drunk, she might not have intended it.

Negligence, on the other hand, involves a breach of duty, causation, and damages. The graduate's actions (drinking and then moving around) could be seen as negligent if she should have known that drinking such a potent cocktail might lead to intoxication and subsequent harm to others. But the key is whether a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the plaintiff will prevail because the graduate should have known the effects. So this is a negligence angle, implying she was negligent for not knowing the drink's strength.

Option B says the plaintiff won't prevail because her actions were involuntary. That points to the lack of intent needed for battery.

Option C claims offensive touching, which is battery, but again, intent is key.

Option D suggests negligence by drinking too much, which is the same as A but phrased differently.

Option E says the plaintiff won't prevail because the graduate also suffered, which doesn't directly address the claim.

Option F talks about extreme and outrageous conduct, which relates to intentional infliction of emotional distress, but that's a higher bar and probably not applicable here.

Option G says the bartender is at fault, so vicarious liability or dram shop liability. But the question is about suing the graduate, not the bartender.

Option H says the graduate didn't know what she was drinking, which might relate to assumption of risk but not sure it's the key point.

Option I is about emotional distress, which again would be a different tort.

Option J says no intent, so no liability.

So, the main issue is whether the graduate is liable for battery or negligence.

In battery, intent to make contact is required. If she vomited involuntarily, she didn't intend the contact, so battery might not hold. But some jurisdictions might consider whether she voluntarily became intoxicated, which led to the act. However, in many places, voluntary intoxication doesn't excuse negligence but can negate specific intent crimes or intentional torts.

For negligence, the question is whether she breached a duty of care. She was in a bar, drank a strong drink without knowing its potency, then tried to move around. A reasonable person might foresee that getting very drunk could lead to accidents, including vomiting on someone. So perhaps she was negligent in her actions after becoming intoxicated.

Wait, but in some states, there's a dram shop act which holds the server liable if they serve someone who's already intoxicated. But again, the question is about the graduate's liability, not the bar's.

In terms of negligence, the graduate could be held responsible if her actions were negligent. She drank a potent drink, which she didn't know was strong, but when she started feeling unwell, she tried to stand and walk, which led to the vomiting. So perhaps she should have been more careful, like sitting down or seeking help instead of moving and risking vomiting on someone.

Alternatively, if the vomiting was an involuntary act, then it's not negligence because she couldn't control it. But the act of standing and walking might have been a negligent action if she was clearly too intoxicated to do so safely.

Wait, but if she became dizzy upon standing, that suggests she was already too intoxicated, and trying to walk was a negligent act because she knew or should have known she was unsteady. So her decision to stand and walk could be the negligent act that led to the vomiting on the customer.

But then, the vomiting itself is the harmful act. So did her standing and walking cause the contact? Or was the vomiting the cause?

Alternatively, the act of vomiting is an involuntary act, so she might not be liable for that. But her decision to move when she felt dizzy could be considered negligent, leading to the situation where she vomited.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think about relevant legal principles.

Generally, a person is liable for the foreseeable consequences of their actions. If she was so intoxicated that she couldn't control her movements, some courts might find that her becoming intoxicated was a negligent act. However, in many jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication is not a defense to negligence but can negate intent for intentional torts.

So, if she became intoxicated voluntarily, and as a result acted negligently, she could be held liable for negligence. The key is whether her conduct was negligent.

Wait, but in this case, she drank a drink she'd never had before, which is very potent. She might not have known how strong it was, but a reasonable person might ask what's in the drink or how strong it is, especially in a festive setting. So maybe she was negligent in drinking it without knowing its potency, leading to intoxication and the subsequent vomiting.

Alternatively, the friend ordered the drink, but she chose to drink it. She might have a duty to know what she's consuming, especially in a social setting where drinks can vary in strength.

So, considering that, perhaps she was negligent. So the customer could prevail on a negligence claim.

Looking back at the options, options A and D suggest negligence. Option A says she should have known the effects, and D says she acted negligently by drinking too much.

Option D seems to focus on drinking too much as the negligence, while A focuses on knowledge of effects.

Alternatively, option B says her actions were involuntary, which would negate intent for battery but not necessarily for negligence.

Wait, but if her vomiting was an involuntary result of her intoxication, then perhaps she can't be held liable for that. However, if her decision to stand and move when she was already feeling dizzy was negligent, then that could be the basis.

So maybe the graduate is liable because she was negligent in her actions after becoming intoxicated.

So, looking at the options, D says she acted negligently by drinking too much. That could be the case because she drank a potent drink without knowing its strength, which led to her intoxication and subsequent actions.

But option A says she should have known the effects. So whether she should have known the drink's strength is a point. If she didn't know, maybe she couldn't have foreseen the effects, but she was in a law school and should know about alcohol effects? Or perhaps a reasonable person would have asked about the drink's potency before consuming it.

Alternatively, if she didn't know what she was drinking, as in option H, she wasn't aware. But she was in a festive mood and drank it anyway, which might imply assumption of risk or contributory negligence, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the question is about the customer suing the graduate. The graduate's intoxication leading to vomiting on the customer.

In many jurisdictions, if someone becomes intoxicated and injures another, they can be held liable for negligence. The theory is that voluntarily becoming intoxicated can be considered negligent because it impairs judgment and increases the risk of harm to others.

So, under this theory, the graduate was negligent in becoming intoxicated, leading to the harm. So option D would apply.

But wait, the initial action was drinking the potent drink, which she didn't know was strong. So perhaps she should have known better than to drink something without knowing its strength, which could make her negligent.

Alternatively, option A says she should have known the effects, but maybe she couldn't have known because she'd never heard of the drink. So perhaps she wasn't negligent in drinking it, but was negligent in her actions after feeling unwell.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to think of a case or principle. In some cases, courts have held that people who become intoxicated can be liable for their actions while intoxicated, even if they didn't intend them, under a negligence theory.

For example, if a drunk driver causes an accident, they're liable for negligence because driving while intoxicated is a negligent act. Similarly, if someone becomes so drunk that they pass out and fall, causing injury to another, they might be held liable for negligence.

In this case, the graduate drank a potent drink, became intoxicated, and then tried to move, leading to vomiting on another. So her act of standing and moving while intoxicated could be considered negligent because she should have known she was unsteady and might harm someone.

So the negligence is in her decision to move around when she was clearly intoxicated, leading to the vomiting which caused harm.

Therefore, the customer would likely prevail on a negligence claim, making option D the correct answer.

But wait, option D says "acted negligently by drinking too much." So the negligence is in drinking too much, not in the subsequent actions. So perhaps that's the basis.

Alternatively, she might be held liable for her actions while intoxicated under a theory of negligence because she knew or should have known that becoming intoxicated could lead to such incidents.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is D: prevail, because the graduate acted negligently by drinking too much.

Alternatively, option A could be correct if the focus is on knowing the effects of the drink. But if she didn't know it was potent, she might not have known the effects, making A less likely.

Wait, but the drink is described as extremely potent. So perhaps a reasonable person would have inquired about the drink's strength before consuming it, especially in a bar setting where drinks can vary. So she might have been negligent in drinking it without knowing, leading to the intoxication and vomiting.

In that case, option A would apply because she should have known the effects, even though she didn't. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the act of drinking too much could be the negligence (D). On the other hand, not knowing the drink's strength but drinking it anyway could be the negligence (A).

But wait, she had never heard of a Hula Girl, but she was in a festive mood and drank it anyway. So perhaps a reasonable person would have asked what's in it or how strong it is before drinking it, especially in a bar where the name suggests it's something special (maybe stronger). So she might be negligent for not inquiring, leading to her intoxication.

Thus, option A says she should have known the effects, implying that a reasonable person would have known or inquired. So she's negligent for drinking it without knowing, leading to the consequences.

So I'm now thinking that the answer is A.

Wait, but I've heard that in some cases, the person who becomes intoxicated is liable for their actions, but it's under a negligence theory where the act of getting intoxicated is the breach of duty.

So in that case, it's option D.

Alternatively, the fact that she didn't know the drink's strength might mean she couldn't have known the effects, so option H says she was unaware, so she isn't liable. But option H says the plaintiff won't prevail because she was unaware.

But I think that's not correct because she voluntarily drank the drink, and the standard is what a reasonable person would have done.

So perhaps the better approach is to consider that she was negligent in drinking the potent cocktail without knowing its strength, which a reasonable person would have inquired about before consuming.

Thus, the graduate should have known the effects, making option A the correct answer.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, damages.

She had a duty to act as a reasonable person. She breached that duty by drinking a potent drink without knowing its strength. The breach caused her to become intoxicated, leading to vomiting on the customer, which caused damages (embarrassment, humiliation).

So yes, that fits negligence. Therefore, she acted negligently, and the plaintiff would prevail under option A.

Wait, but option D says she acted negligently by drinking too much, which is a bit different. It's more about the quantity than the quality or potency.

But in this case, the drink was 2 oz gin, 1 oz vermouth, and a teaspoon of grenadine. That's a pretty strong drink, but perhaps she only had one. So maybe the quantity wasn't the issue, but the potency was.

So perhaps she didn't drink too much in terms of volume, but the drink was very strong. So option A focuses on the effects of the drink, which she should have known. But if she didn't know, maybe she couldn't have known.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. I think the key is whether she could have reasonably foreseen the effects. Since the drink was ordered by her friend, and she didn't know what was in it, she might not have known how strong it was. So maybe she's not negligent for drinking it, but she is negligent for her actions after drinking it.

Wait, but the act of drinking it was the initial act. If she drank it without knowing its strength, and then became intoxicated, leading to vomiting, then the initial act of drinking it could be considered negligent if a reasonable person would have inquired about the drink's potency before consuming it.

So, perhaps option A is correct because she should have known the effects of the drink, implying that she should have inquired. Alternatively, she might not have known, making option H correct.

But I think that in law, the standard is what a reasonable person would do. So a reasonable person in a bar, when a friend orders a round of drinks with a name they don't recognize, might ask what's in it before drinking, especially if it's described as "extremely potent." So she might be negligent for not inquiring, thus breaching her duty.

Therefore, option A would apply, and the plaintiff would prevail.

Wait, but the question states that the Hula Girl is "extremely potent," but the graduate had never heard of it. So she didn't know it was potent. So she couldn't have known the effects unless she asked. So a reasonable person might have asked, making her negligent for not asking.

So, I think option A is the correct answer.

The scenario involves a law graduate who celebrated passing the bar exam by drinking a potent cocktail called a Hula Girl, which she had never heard of before. After consuming it, she became dizzy, attempted to stand, and vomited on a nearby customer, causing embarrassment and humiliation. The question asks whether the customer (plaintiff) would prevail in a claim against the graduate.

To analyze this, the possible legal claims are negligence or battery. Battery requires intentional harmful or offensive contact, but the graduate's vomiting appears to be an involuntary act due to intoxication, which would negate intent. Therefore, battery is unlikely to apply.

For negligence, the elements are duty, breach, causation, and damages. The graduate had a duty to act as a reasonable person. By drinking the Hula Girl without knowing its potency, she may have breached that duty. A reasonable person might have inquired about the drink's strength before consuming it, especially given its name and the festive setting. Her decision to drink it without such inquiry could be considered negligent, as it led to her intoxication and subsequent vomiting, which caused harm to the customer.

Option A suggests that the graduate should have known the effects of the drink, implying that a reasonable person would have inquired about its potency before consuming it. This aligns with the negligence analysis, as her failure to do so could be seen as a breach of duty. Option D focuses on drinking too much, but the issue here is the drink's potency rather than the quantity consumed. Therefore, Option A is the most accurate.

Other options are less applicable. Option B (involuntary actions) does not negate negligence, as negligence focuses on the act of drinking the potent drink. Option H (unaware of what she was drinking) is addressed by the reasonable person standard, which would expect her to inquire about the drink's strength. Thus, the plaintiff would most likely prevail under a negligence theory.
