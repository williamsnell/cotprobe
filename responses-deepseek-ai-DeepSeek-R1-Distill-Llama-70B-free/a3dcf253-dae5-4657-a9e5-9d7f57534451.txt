Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and displacement fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

So the question is about an isolated positive point charge of 5e-10 coulombs. We're supposed to find the magnitude of E and D at a distance of 30 cm, both when the charge is in air and when it's in glycerin, which has a relative permittivity (epsilon_r) of 50.

Wait, right, I remember that E is the electric field, and D is the electric displacement field. The relationship between them is D = epsilon * E, where epsilon is the permittivity of the medium. Oh wait, no, more precisely, D = epsilon_0 epsilon_r E, right? Because epsilon = epsilon_0 * epsilon_r. And in air, epsilon_r is approximately 1.

But wait, another thing: the formula for E in a point charge is E = (1/(4 pi epsilon)) * (Q / r²). And for D, it's D = (Q / (4 pi r²)). Because D is epsilon_0 times E when epsilon_r is 1, but when there's a medium, D still uses epsilon_0, I think.

So, let me clarify the equations.

The electric field E due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law: E = (Q) / (4 pi epsilon r²). The permittivity epsilon is epsilon_0 multiplied by the relative permittivity (epsilon_r) of the medium. So when in air, epsilon_r is 1, so epsilon = epsilon_0. When in glycerin, epsilon = 50 epsilon_0.

The displacement field D is given by D = Q / (4 pi r²) * (1/epsilon_0). Wait, no, actually, let me think. No, D is defined as D = epsilon_0 E + P, but for linear isotropic materials, P = chi_e epsilon_0 E = (epsilon_r - 1) epsilon_0 E. So D = epsilon_0 (1 + chi_e) E = epsilon_0 epsilon_r E. Therefore, D = (epsilon_r epsilon_0) E. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because I thought D was the same as epsilon_0 E when in vacuum.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The displacement field D is related to E and P (polarization) by D = epsilon_0 E + P. And in linear isotropic materials, P = chi_e epsilon_0 E, where chi_e is the electric susceptibility, which is (epsilon_r - 1). So substituting, D = epsilon_0 E + chi_e epsilon_0 E = epsilon_0 (1 + chi_e) E = epsilon_0 epsilon_r E.

So from that, E = D / (epsilon_0 epsilon_r). And since D = Q/(4 pi r²), because for a point charge, the displacement field is the same as in vacuum, because D depends on free charges, not the medium's response.

Wait, no: for a point charge in a medium, the D field is the same as in vacuum, because D depends on the free charge. So D = (Q) / (4 pi r²) in all cases, right? Because D is due to free charges, and the medium's polarization is accounted for in E and P.

So, to calculate D, it's always Q/(4 pi r²), regardless of the medium. But E depends on the medium's permittivity.

So in air, epsilon_r is 1, so E = D / (epsilon_0 * 1) = D / epsilon_0. And in glycerin, E = D / (epsilon_0 * 50).

So the plan is:

1. Calculate D for both cases (air and glycerin). But since D depends only on the free charge and distance, it's the same in both media. So D is Q/(4 pi r²).

2. Then calculate E for each case using E = D / (epsilon * epsilon_0) or E = D/(epsilon_0 epsilon_r).

Wait, no, E is D divided by the permittivity. Since D = epsilon E, so E = D / epsilon. And epsilon is epsilon_0 * epsilon_r. So yes.

So let me compute D first.

Given Q = 5e-10 C.

r is 30 cm, which is 0.3 meters.

So D = Q / (4 pi r²).

Let me compute that. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, 4 pi r squared: 4 * pi * (0.3)^2 = 4 * pi * 0.09 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 0.09 ≈ 4 * 0.2827 ≈ 1.1308 m².

So D = 5e-10 C / 1.1308 m² ≈ 4.424e-10 C/m².

Wait, wait, let me do that calculation more accurately.

Wait, 0.3 meters squared is 0.09 m². 4 * pi is approximately 12.566. So 12.566 * 0.09 = 1.13094 m².

So D = 5e-10 / 1.13094 ≈ 4.42e-10 C/m².

Wait, that's D for both cases, because D depends only on free charge.

Now, E in air: E_air = D / (epsilon_0 * epsilon_r_air) = D / (epsilon_0 * 1) = D / epsilon_0.

E in glycerin: E_glycerin = D / (epsilon_0 * 50).

So, let's compute E_air first.

We know that 1/(4 pi epsilon_0) is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C², which is Coulomb's constant, k.

So, alternatively, E_air = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0)) * (Q / r²) = k Q / r².

Let me compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Q = 5e-10 C.

r = 0.3 m.

So E_air = 8.988e9 * 5e-10 / (0.3)^2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 5e-10 = 8.988 * 5 * 1e-1 = 44.94 * 0.1 = 4.494.

Denominator: 0.09.

So E_air = 4.494 / 0.09 = approx 49.933 V/m, say about 50 V/m.

Wait, that's the E in air.

Wait, but earlier I thought D was about 4.42e-10 C/m². So let's check that.

E_air should be D / epsilon_0.

Compute D = 4.42e-10 C/m².

So E_air = 4.42e-10 / (8.85e-12 F/m) ?

Wait, wait, wait. Because epsilon_0 is 8.85e-12 F/m (farads per meter). So 1/epsilon_0 is approximately 1.13e11.

So E_air = D / epsilon_0 = 4.42e-10 * 1e11 / 8.85 ≈ (4.42e-10) * (1.13e11) ≈ Let me compute 4.42 * 1.13 is about 5.0, then 1e1, so 50 V/m. Yep, that matches.

So E_air is 50 V/m, D is 4.42e-10 C/m².

Now, for glycerin, epsilon_r is 50. So E_glycerin = D / (epsilon_0 * 50) = (4.42e-10) / (8.85e-12 * 50).

Compute denominator: 8.85e-12 *50 = 4.425e-10.

So E_glycerin = 4.42e-10 / 4.425e-10 ≈ approximately 1.0 V/m.

So, in air, E is 50 V/m, D is 4.42e-10 C/m².

In glycerin, E is 1 V/m, D is same, 4.42e-10 C/m².

Wait, looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option E: E=50 V/m, D=4.44e-10 in air; E=1 V/m, D=4.42e-10 in glycerin. Hmm, that's very close.

Wait, let me check the calculations again for any possible errors.

Wait, D is Q/(4 pi r²). Let me compute that precisely.

Q =5e-10 C.

r =0.3 m.

r² = 0.09 m².

4 pi r² = 4 * pi *0.09 ≈ 1.13097 m².

So D = 5e-10 / 1.13097 ≈ 4.42e-10 C/m².

Yes, that's correct.

E_air = 5e-10 / (4 pi epsilon_0 (0.3)^2 ) 

Wait, alternatively, E = (1/(4 pi epsilon_0 epsilon_r)) * (Q/r²).

In air, epsilon_r =1, so E is (5e-10) / [4 pi epsilon_0 (0.3)^2 ].

Which is 5e-10 / [4 pi * 8.85e-12 * 0.09 ].

Wait, no: 4 pi epsilon_0 r² is 4 pi * 8.85e-12 * 0.09.

Wait, 4 pi epsilon_0 r^2 = 4*3.1416 *8.85e-12 *0.09.

Compute 4*3.1416 = ~12.566.

12.566 *8.85e-12 = approx 1.112e-10.

Multiply by 0.09: 1.112e-10 *0.09 = 1.0008e-11.

So E_air = 5e-10 / 1.0008e-11 ≈ 49.94 V/m, which is about 50 V/m. So that's correct.

So in air, E=50 V/m, D=4.42e-10 C/m².

In glycerin, E is 50 V/m divided by 50, so 1 V/m, and D remains the same.

Looking at the options:

Option E says in air, E=50 V/m, D=4.44e-10; in glycerin, E=1 V/m, D=4.42e-10.

That's exactly what I calculated. So option E matches.

Wait, but let me check if any of the other options are similar. For example, option A has E=55 V/m and D=5e-10 in air, which is higher than our calculation. So probably not.

Yes, I think option E is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the electric field \( E \) and the electric displacement field \( D \) for a point charge \( Q = 5 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{C} \) at a distance \( r = 0.3 \, \mathrm{m} \) in two cases: (a) in air (\( \epsilon_r = 1 \)) and (b) in glycerin (\( \epsilon_r = 50 \)).

### Key Equations:
1. **Electric displacement field (\( D \))**:
   \[
   D = \frac{Q}{4 \pi r^2}
   \]
   This is independent of the medium.

2. **Electric field (\( E \))**:
   \[
   E = \frac{D}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}
   \]
   Here, \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{F/m} \) is the permittivity of free space, and \( \epsilon_r \) is the relative permittivity of the medium.

### Calculations:
1. **Displacement field (\( D \))**:
   \[
   D = \frac{Q}{4 \pi r^2} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-10}}{4 \pi (0.3)^2}
   \]
   Compute \( 4 \pi r^2 \):
   \[
   4 \pi (0.3)^2 = 4 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 0.09 \approx 1.13097 \, \mathrm{m^2}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   D = \frac{5 \times 10^{-10}}{1.13097} \approx 4.42 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{C/m^2}
   \]

2. **Electric field in air (\( E_{\text{air}} \))**:
   In air, \( \epsilon_r = 1 \), so:
   \[
   E_{\text{air}} = \frac{D}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{4.42 \times 10^{-10}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12}} \approx 50 \, \mathrm{V/m}
   \]

3. **Electric field in glycerin (\( E_{\text{glycerin}} \))**:
   In glycerin, \( \epsilon_r = 50 \), so:
   \[
   E_{\text{glycerin}} = \frac{D}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r} = \frac{4.42 \times 10^{-10}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 50} \approx 1 \, \mathrm{V/m}
   \]

### Results:
- In air: \( E = 50 \, \mathrm{V/m} \), \( D = 4.42 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \)
- In glycerin: \( E = 1 \, \mathrm{V/m} \), \( D = 4.42 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \)

### Matching with Options:
From the given options, **Option E** matches the calculated results:
- In air: \( E = 50 \, \mathrm{V/m} \), \( D = 4.44 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \)
- In glycerin: \( E = 1 \, \mathrm{V/m} \), \( D = 4.42 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{C/m^2} \)

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E**
