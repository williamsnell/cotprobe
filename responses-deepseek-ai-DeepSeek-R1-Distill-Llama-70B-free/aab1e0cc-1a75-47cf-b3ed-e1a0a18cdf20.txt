Question:

A man was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a child. At trial, in its case-in-chief, the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence that the man had twice been previously involved in similar cases with other children. The prosecution argues that these past crimes demonstrate the likelihood that the man molested this child. Defense counsel objects to the evidence regarding other children. The judge should find the evidence

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of bad character.
B: admissible, because the evidence of past crimes is relevant to the case at hand.
C: inadmissible, because the evidence of past crimes is prejudicial and would bias the jury.
D: admissible, because the man's past crimes demonstrate a pattern of behavior.
E: inadmissible, because past crimes may not be introduced to prove disposition to commit certain acts.
F: inadmissible, because the man's past crimes are not similar enough to the current charge.
G: admissible, because a common plan or scheme may be proven by other similar criminal acts.
H: admissible, as long as the evidence of past crimes does not outweigh its probative value.
I: inadmissible, because past crimes are not relevant to the case at hand.
J: admissible, because the man's past crimes may be introduced to show that he is more likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of prior crimes in a sexual assault case. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a man charged with sexually assaulting a child. The prosecution wants to introduce evidence that he was involved in two similar cases before. They argue that this shows he's likely to have molested this child. The defense objects, and the judge has to decide whether to admit this evidence.

I remember that in criminal cases, prior convictions or bad acts are generally not admissible to prove that the person is of bad character or disposition. That's because such evidence can be really prejudicialâ€”it might make the jury think, "Well, he did it before, so he must have done it now," without solid proof. But wait, there are exceptions, right?

So under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(b), evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts isn't admissible to prove a person's character to show they acted in conformity with that character. But there are exceptions when such evidence is relevant for other purposes, like showing motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.

In this case, the prosecution is arguing that the prior acts show he's likely to have committed the current crime. That sounds like they're trying to use it to show his propensity, which isn't allowed under 404(b). So the evidence might be inadmissible unless it fits one of the exceptions.

Wait, but sometimes courts allow such evidence if it's for a purpose other than showing bad character. For example, if the prior acts are so similar that they show a modus operandi (MO), which could help in proving identity. Or if it's to show a plan or scheme.

But here, the prosecution's argument is that the past crimes demonstrate the likelihood he molested the child. That's using it to show propensity, which is prohibited.

So looking at the options, let me go through them.

Option A: Inadmissible because prosecution can't initiate bad character evidence. Well, I think the prosecution is offering it, but the defense objects. But Rule 404(b) says that evidence of prior crimes can't be used to prove bad character. So maybe A is correct, but I need to check other options.

Option B: Admissible because relevant. But relevance alone isn't enough. The evidence has to be relevant for a proper purpose, not just to show he's a bad guy.

Option C: Inadmissible because it's prejudicial. While it's true that prior crimes can be prejudicial, the judge could exclude it under Rule 403 (prejudice vs probative value). But the question is about whether it's inadmissible per se, not if it's excluded under 403.

Option D: Admissible to show pattern. If it's a pattern, maybe under 404(b) exceptions, like modus operandi. But the prosecution's stated purpose is to show likelihood, which is propensity, not a pattern for another purpose.

Option E: Inadmissible because past crimes can't prove disposition. This aligns with Rule 404(b). So E looks correct, but let me check others.

Option F: Inadmissible because not similar enough. The question says similar cases, so maybe they are similar. So F might not be the right reason.

Option G: Admissible for common plan or scheme. If there's evidence of a common plan, that's an exception. But the question doesn't say that the prosecution is arguing a plan, just that the past acts show likelihood.

Option H: Admissible as long as probative value outweighs prejudice. That's Rule 403. So if the evidence is admissible under 404(b), then the judge would weigh 403. But if it's excluded under 404(b), then H wouldn't make it admissible.

Option I: Inadmissible because not relevant. But the past crimes are relevant to the issue, so I don't think this is correct. Relevance isn't the issue; it's the purpose for which it's offered.

Option J: Admissible to show he's more likely to have committed. That's using it for propensity, which is exactly what 404(b) prohibits. So J is incorrect.

So putting it together, the evidence is being offered to show that he's likely to have committed the crime because he did similar things before. That's using it to prove his disposition, which is inadmissible under Rule 404(b). So the correct answer should be E: inadmissible because past crimes may not be introduced to prove disposition to commit certain acts.

But wait, another thought: Sometimes, in sex offense cases, there's an exception for prior sex crimes under Rule 414. But I think that's when the defendant is charged with a sexual assault, evidence of prior sexual assaults can be admissible, but I'm not sure about the specifics. However, the question doesn't specify that the prior cases resulted in convictions, just that he was "involved" in similar cases. So maybe 414 doesn't apply here because it might require convictions.

Alternatively, if the prior acts are being used for a purpose other than propensity, like modus operandi, then it could be admissible. But the prosecution's argument here is about likelihood, which is propensity. So E still holds.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence regarding a defendant's prior involvement in similar cases to prove likelihood of committing the current crime. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), prior crimes, wrongs, or acts are generally inadmissible to prove a person's character or propensity to commit crimes. However, there are exceptions if the evidence serves another purpose, such as showing motive, intent, or a modus operandi. 

In this case, the prosecution argues that the prior acts demonstrate the likelihood of the defendant molesting the child, which directly uses the evidence to show propensity. This is prohibited under Rule 404(b). While other options suggest potential exceptions, such as modus operandi or a common plan, the prosecution's stated purpose aligns with propensity, not an exception. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible because past crimes cannot be introduced to prove disposition to commit certain acts.
