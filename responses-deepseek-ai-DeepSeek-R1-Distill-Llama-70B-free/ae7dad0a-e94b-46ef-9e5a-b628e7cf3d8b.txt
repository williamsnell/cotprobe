Alright, so I have this question about popes and their order. The question is asking which pope came right before John Paul II. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Okay, I remember that John Paul II was a very well-known pope, serving from 1978 to 2005. He was the first Polish pope and had a long reign. But the question is about who was just before him.

I think the popes before him were in a sequence. Let me try to recall. I remember there was a pope named John XXIII, but I'm not sure if he was right before John Paul II. Wait, John XXIII was in the early 60s, I think. Then there was Paul VI after him. Oh wait, that's right. Paul VI was the pope before John Paul I, maybe?

Wait, no. Let me think again. After John XXIII, who came next? I think it was Paul VI. He served in the 60s and early 70s. Then after Paul VI, there was John Paul I. Oh right! John Paul I was the one who had a very short papacy, like just a few months in 1978. Then after him came John Paul II.

So the immediate predecessor of John Paul II was John Paul I. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option H is John Paul I. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the numbers. John Paul I was the first with that name, right? Because John Paul II came after him and took the same name but added II. So yes, that makes sense. The order was Paul VI, then John Paul I, then John Paul II.

So among the options, H is John Paul I, which is correct.

The Pope who immediately preceded John Paul II was John Paul I. He had a very brief papacy in 1978 before John Paul II succeeded him.
