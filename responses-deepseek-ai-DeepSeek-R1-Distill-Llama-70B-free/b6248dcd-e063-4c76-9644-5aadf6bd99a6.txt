Okay, so I've got this question about Bob Franklin buying a new car and calculating depreciation using the sum of the years' digits method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the car costs $10,000 and is expected to last 10 years with no residual value. The question is asking how much it depreciates during the seventh year using the sum of the years' digits method. I remember that depreciation methods can vary, and sum of years' digits is one of them.

First, I need to recall how the sum of the years' digits (SYD) method works. I think it's an accelerated depreciation method, meaning higher expenses in the early years and less in the later years. The formula for SYD is to take the sum of the years the asset is expected to last. For 10 years, the sum would be 1+2+3+...+10. Wait, what's the sum of the first n integers? Oh right, it's n(n+1)/2. So for 10 years, sum is 10*11/2 = 55.

Each year's depreciation is calculated by taking the remaining life divided by the sum, multiplied by the depreciable amount. Wait, no, more accurately, each year's depreciation is (year's factor / SYD sum) * cost. Or wait, is it (year's factor / SYD) * depreciable base? I think so.

So for each year, the depreciation is (year number / sum) * cost. Wait, no, I think it's the reverse. Wait, no, waitâ€”each year's depreciation is ( (SYD - previous years' sum ) / SYD ) * cost? Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, for each year, the depreciation is (remaining years) / SYD * cost.

Wait, no, another approach: Each year's depreciation is ( (n - (year -1)) / sum ) * cost. Let me think. For year 1, the fraction is 10/55, year 2 is 9/55, and so on until year 10, which is 1/55. So the depreciation for each year decreases by 1/55 each time.

So for the seventh year, the fraction would be (10 - (7-1)) / 55 = (10-6)/55 = 4/55. So the depreciation for year seven is (4/55)*10,000.

Wait, let me calculate that. 4 divided by 55 is approximately 0.072727... Multiply by 10,000 gives $727.27. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is $727.27. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. The sum of years is 55, correct. Each year's depreciation is ( (10 +1 - year) / 55 ) * cost. Wait, for year 1, it's 10/55, year 2 is 9/55, ..., year 7 is 4/55. Yes, that seems right.

So yes, 4/55 of 10,000 is 727.27. So the correct answer is G.

To calculate the depreciation during the seventh year using the sum of the years' digits (SYD) method, we first determine the total sum of the years. For an asset with a 10-year lifespan, the sum is:

\[
\text{Sum of years} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55
\]

Under the SYD method, the depreciation for each year is calculated as:

\[
\text{Depreciation for year } t = \left(\frac{\text{remaining years}}{\text{sum of years}}\right) \times \text{cost}
\]

For the seventh year, the remaining years are \(10 - (7 - 1) = 4\). Thus, the depreciation for the seventh year is:

\[
\text{Depreciation} = \left(\frac{4}{55}\right) \times 10,000 = 727.27
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: $727.27**

Answer: G
