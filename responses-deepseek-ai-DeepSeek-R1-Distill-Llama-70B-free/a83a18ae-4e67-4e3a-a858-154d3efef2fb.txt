Question:

Okay, so I have this question here about Jared and his hypothesis regarding psychology lectures. Let me read it carefully. Hmm. Jared thinks that going to psychology lectures is a waste of time. He believes that one can do just as well by reading the review book, watching "Discovering Psychology," and taking the tests. So he's testing this hypothesis with an experiment.

The question is asking about the independent variable in his experiment. Right, independent variable is the factor that the researcher manipulates or changes to see if it affects the dependent variable.

So, Jared's hypothesis is that not attending lectures doesn't make a difference in performance. He's probably comparing two groups: one that attends lectures and another that doesn't. Or maybe he's looking at different study methods. Wait, no, in his case, he's suggesting that the alternative methods (review book, videos, tests) are enough.

Let me think about experimental design. The independent variable is what Jared is changing between groups. So, if he's testing whether attending lectures matters, the variable would be whether someone attends lectures or not. But wait, in his setup, he's not necessarily having a control group that goes to lectures. Let me think again.

Wait, Jared's hypothesis is that you can do just as well without the lectures. So his experiment probably involves two conditions: one where people attend lectures plus other stuff, and another where they don't attend lectures but do the other activities. Or maybe he's manipulating whether someone attends lectures or not.

Wait, the question says he's testing his hypothesis with an experiment. So what is he manipulating? He's probably assigning some people to attend lectures and others not to. But wait, in his belief, the alternative is just reading the book, watching the videos, and taking tests. So the independent variable would be whether or not someone attends lectures, because that's the factor he's testing.

Wait, but the options don't directly say that. Let me look at the options.

Option E is "going to lecture classes". Option D is "not going and reading and watching". Option B is all three: going, reading, watching. Hmm, perhaps I need to think about what the variable is.

Wait, the independent variable is the factor the researcher manipulates. If Jared's hypothesis is that attending classes doesn't make a difference, then he's testing whether the method of learning (with or without lectures) affects the outcome.

So maybe in the experiment, one group goes to lectures, reads the book, watches the videos, and takes tests. The other group doesn't go to lectures but does the other activities. So the variable being manipulated is attendance to lectures.

So the independent variable would be whether they attend lectures or not. So looking at the options, the variable is going to lecture classes versus not.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Option E is going to lectures. That's a possible choice. But wait, the independent variable is a condition that is applied. So the variable would be the presence or absence of attending lectures.

Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as the independent variable being the factor he's changing. So if in the experiment, he's having some people attend lectures and others not, then the independent variable is whether they attend lectures.

But looking at the options, option E is "going to lecture classes". So that's the condition he's testing. Alternatively, option D is not going and doing other things.

Wait, perhaps the independent variable is the method used. So in the experiment, one group does everything, another doesn't attend lectures. So the variable is whether they attend lectures or not. So the independent variable is attendance to lecture classes.

Wait, but in the options, option E is just going to lecture classes, which might be one condition, and the other condition is not going. So the independent variable is whether they go to lectures.

Alternatively, the independent variable could be the set of activities they do. So in this case, Jared is comparing two approaches: attending lectures plus other activities versus not attending and doing the others. So the variable is which set of activities they're assigned to.

Wait, but the question is about the independent variable. Let me think again.

In an experiment, the independent variable is the factor that the researcher intentionally changes. The dependent variable is what's measured, like test scores.

So Jared is testing whether attending lectures makes a difference. So he might have two groups: one that attends and one that doesn't. So the independent variable is the presence or absence of attending lectures.

So looking at the options, the variable is whether they go to lectures. So the independent variable would be "going to lecture classes" as it's the factor being manipulated.

Wait, but option E is "going to lecture classes" as the independent variable, while option D is the opposite condition.

Alternatively, if the variable is whether they attend or not, then the variable is "attendance vs. not attendance". But the options don't have that phrased that way.

Wait the question is, which option is the independent variable. So the correct answer would be the factor that Jared is changing. So he's manipulating whether students attend lectures.

Therefore, the independent variable is "going to lecture classes". So the correct option would be E.

Wait, but some might think that the independent variable is the combination of activities. Let me reconsider.

If Jared's hypothesis is that you can do as well without lectures, then he's testing whether the inclusion of lectures affects the outcome. So the variable is whether the student attends lectures or not. So the variable is "going to lecture classes".

So the correct answer would be E.

The question asks about the independent variable in Jared's experiment, where he tests his hypothesis that attending psychology lectures is unnecessary for success in the course. Jared believes that reading the review book, watching "Discovering Psychology," and taking tests are sufficient. The independent variable is the factor Jared manipulates to test his hypothesis. In this case, it is whether students attend lecture classes or not. Jared is likely comparing two groups: one that attends lectures and another that does not, while keeping other factors constant.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E ("going to lecture classes")** directly represents the factor Jared is manipulating. It is the variable being tested to see if it affects the outcome (test scores).
- Other options, such as combinations of activities (e.g., Option B or D), describe conditions but do not isolate the specific factor being manipulated.

Thus, the independent variable is "going to lecture classes," as it is the factor Jared is testing to determine its impact on performance.
