Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the empirical formula of a compound. The compound is made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The total mass is 29.05 grams. The mass of carbon is 18.02 grams, hydrogen is 3.03 grams, and I guess the rest must be oxygen. 

Hmm, I remember that the empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of the elements in the compound. So first, I need to find out how much of each element is present in terms of moles because the ratio will be based on moles, not grams.

Let me start by calculating the mass of oxygen. The total mass is 29.05g, and if I subtract the carbon and hydrogen masses, that should give me the oxygen. So 29.05 minus 18.02 is 11.03, and then minus 3.03 gives me... wait, wait, no. Oh wait no: carbon is 18.02g, hydrogen is 3.03g. So 18.02 + 3.03 is 21.05g. So the remaining is 29.05g total minus 21.05g, which equals 8.00g of oxygen. Oh, that's a neat number.

Now I need to convert each of these masses into moles. I remember the atomic masses from the periodic table: Carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, Hydrogen is about 1.008 g/mol, and Oxygen is 16.00 g/mol.

So for Carbon: 18.02g divided by 12.01g/mol. Let me do that calculation. 18.02 / 12.01 is approximately 1.5 moles. Because 12 times 1.5 is 18, so yeah, it's about 1.5.

Hydrogen: 3.03g divided by 1.008g/mol. Hmm, 3.03 / 1.008. Well, 3 divided by 1 is 3, but since it's 1.008, it's a bit less. Let me compute it: 3.03 / 1.008 equals approximately 3. So, about 3 moles of H.

Oxygen: 8.00g divided by 16.00g/mol is 0.5 moles.

So now I have the moles: C is 1.5, H is 3, O is 0.5.

To find the empirical formula, I need the ratio of these moles. It's probably easiest to divide each by the smallest number of moles, which is 0.5 in this case.

So for C: 1.5 / 0.5 = 3. H: 3 / 0.5 = 6. O: 0.5 /0.5 = 1.

Wait, wait, that would give a ratio of C3H6O. But let me double-check that. Because 1.5 divided by 0.5 is 3, yes. 3 divided by 0.5 is 6, yes. 0.5 divided by 0.5 is 1. So the ratio is 3:6:1.

Wait, but can I simplify that ratio further? Let me think—3,6,1 can all be divided by 1, so that's the simplest. So the empirical formula would be C3H6O.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option F is C3H6O, which matches. But wait, let me double-check the options. Let me look again: the options are A through J. F is C3H6O, yes.

But wait, another thought. Did I do the initial mole calculations correctly? Let me recheck.

Carbon: 18.02g /12.01 g/mol. 12.01 * 1.5 is 18.015, which is about 18.02. So that's correct. So 1.5 moles.

Hydrogen: 3.03g /1.008. Let me compute this more accurately. 1.008 *3 is 3.024, which is a bit more than 3.03. Wait, 3.03-3.024 is 0.006, so 3 + (0.006 /1.008) ≈ 3 + 0.00595 ≈ 3.006. So about 3 moles. So that's correct.

Oxygen: 8.00g /16.00 g/mol is exactly 0.5. So that's right.

Wait, so the ratio is 1.5 C : 3 H : 0.5 O. To make them whole numbers, I can multiply each by 2. That would give 3 C, 6 H, 1 O. So that's the same as before.

So the formula is C3H6O, which is option F.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is C2H4O2. Let me think—could I have made a mistake in the ratios?

Alternatively, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me write down the moles again:

Carbon: 18.02 /12.01 = approx 1.5.

Hydrogen: 3.03 /1.008 = approx 3.

Oxygen: 8.00 /16 = 0.5.

So the mole ratio is C:H:O = 1.5 : 3 : 0.5.

Another way is to write these as fractions. 1.5 is 3/2, 3 is 6/2, 0.5 is 1/2. So the ratio is (3/2) : (6/2) : (1/2), which simplifies to 3:6:1 when multiplied by 2.

So yes, the ratio is 3:6:1. So the empirical formula is C3H6O.

Looking at the options, F is C3H6O, so the correct answer is F.

To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we start by calculating the mass of oxygen, which is the remainder of the total mass after subtracting the masses of carbon and hydrogen:

\[
\text{Mass of oxygen} = 29.05 \, \text{g} - 18.02 \, \text{g} - 3.03 \, \text{g} = 8.00 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we convert the masses of each element into moles using their respective molar masses:

- **Carbon**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of carbon} = \frac{18.02 \, \text{g}}{12.01 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 1.5 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

- **Hydrogen**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of hydrogen} = \frac{3.03 \, \text{g}}{1.008 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 3.0 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

- **Oxygen**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of oxygen} = \frac{8.00 \, \text{g}}{16.00 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.5 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

The mole ratio of the elements is:

\[
\text{C:H:O} = 1.5 : 3.0 : 0.5.
\]

To simplify this ratio, divide each value by the smallest number of moles (0.5):

\[
\text{C:H:O} = \frac{1.5}{0.5} : \frac{3.0}{0.5} : \frac{0.5}{0.5} = 3 : 6 : 1.
\]

Thus, the empirical formula is **C₃H₆O**. Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: C₃H₆O**.
