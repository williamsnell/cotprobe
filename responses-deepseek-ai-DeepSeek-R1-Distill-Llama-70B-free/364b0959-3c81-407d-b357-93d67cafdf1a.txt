Okay, so I have this problem about using Chebyshev's Inequality to find the upper bound of a probability when tossing a fair coin 50 times. The question is about the probability that the number of heads is greater than 35 or less than 15. Hmm, I remember that Chebyshev's Inequality is used to find bounds on probabilities for distributions, especially when we don't know the exact distribution.

First, let me recall what Chebyshev's Inequality states. I think it says that the probability of a random variable being more than k standard deviations away from its mean is at most 1/k². So, P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². But wait, in this problem, we have two tails—so the event is that X is either greater than 35 or less than 15. That's like two-sided, so I need to adjust accordingly.

Let me break this down. The coin is fair, so the probability of heads (p) is 0.5 each toss. The number of trials (n) is 50. Since each toss is a Bernoulli trial, the number of heads (X) follows a binomial distribution with parameters n=50 and p=0.5.

But calculating the exact probability for X >35 or X <15 would be tedious because I'd have to sum a lot of terms. That's where Chebyshev comes in handy because it gives an upper bound without exact calculations.

Chebyshev's Inequality in this case would apply to the binomial distribution. I should probably first find the mean (μ) and the variance (σ²) of X.

For a binomial distribution, μ = n*p. So μ = 50 * 0.5 = 25. That's the expected number of heads.

The variance σ² is n*p*(1-p). So σ² = 50 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 12.5. Therefore, the standard deviation σ is the square root of 12.5. Let me calculate that: sqrt(12.5) is approximately 3.5355.

Now, the problem is asking for P(X >35 or X <15). Let me express this in terms of the mean and standard deviations.

Wait, X >35 is the same as X ≥35+1=36 if we're considering integers, but I think for Chebyshev, it's in terms of distances from the mean. Similarly, X <15 is X ≤14.

So let me find how many standard deviations away these values are from the mean.

The mean is 25, so 35 is 10 above the mean, and 15 is 10 below. So the distance from the mean is 10 in both cases.

But wait, the standard deviation is approximately 3.5355. So 10 divided by 3.5355 is approximately 2.828. Let's call this k.

Wait, so k is the number of standard deviations from the mean. So for X >35, it's (35 - μ)/σ = (35-25)/3.5355 ≈ 10/3.5355 ≈ 2.828. Similarly, for X <15, it's (15 -25)/3.5355 ≈ -10/3.5355 ≈ -2.828. So the absolute value is about 2.828.

But wait, Chebyshev's inequality is about being within k standard deviations. So if we're looking for the probability that X is either >35 or <15, that's the same as |X - μ| >10. So in terms of k, 10 = k * σ. So k = 10 / σ ≈ 2.828.

But Chebyshev's gives P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/(k²). Wait, no. Wait, the inequality is P(|X - μ| ≥ k) ≤ σ²/(k²). Or wait, I might be mixing up the formula.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The exact statement is: For any k >0, P(|X - μ| ≥k) ≤ σ² /k². Or is it 1/k²? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, I think I might have gotten it wrong. Let me think again. The Chebyshev inequality is often written as P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². So when you express the distance in terms of standard deviations. So in this case, the distance from the mean is 10, which is kσ. So 10 =kσ, so k=10/σ ≈ 2.828. Then, the probability is ≤ 1/(k²) = 1/(8). Because 2.828 squared is roughly 8. So 1/8 is 0.125.

Wait, but wait. The problem is that Chebyshev's gives an upper bound for P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². But in this problem, the distance from the mean is 10, which is 10/σ ≈2.828σ. So k is approximately 2.828.

So 1/k² would be 1/(8), since 2.828 is sqrt(8), so squared is 8. So 1/8 is 0.125.

But wait, the question is about X being either greater than 35 or less than 15. So is that the same as |X-25| ≥10, which is exactly what I calculated.

So the probability is ≤ 1/(k²) = 0.125, which is 0.125.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.125. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way: let's compute k as (35 - μ)/σ. So (35-25)/sqrt(12.5) = 10 / 3.5355 ≈ 2.828. So k here is 2.828. So the probability is 1/(k²) = 1/(8) ≈ 0.125. So that's correct.

But wait, in some versions of Chebyshev's inequality, the formula is written differently. Let me confirm.

Chebyshev's inequality in probability theory says that for any random variable X with finite mean and variance, P(|X - μ| ≥ k) ≤ σ² / k².

Ah, wait, that's another version. So if I set k as 10, then P(|X-25| ≥10) ≤ σ² / (10)^2 = 12.5 /100 = 0.125. So same answer.

So either way, whether I express k in terms of standard deviations or in absolute terms, I get the same result.

So the upper bound is 0.125, which is option G.

To solve the problem, we use Chebyshev's Inequality, which provides an upper bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean by a certain amount. The inequality is given by:

\[
P(|X - \mu| \geq k) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2}
\]

Here, \(X\) is the number of heads in 50 tosses of a fair coin. Since the coin is fair, \(X\) follows a binomial distribution with parameters \(n = 50\) and \(p = 0.5\). The mean (\(\mu\)) and variance (\(\sigma^2\)) of \(X\) are:

\[
\mu = np = 50 \cdot 0.5 = 25
\]
\[
\sigma^2 = np(1-p) = 50 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 12.5
\]

The standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) is:

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{12.5} \approx 3.5355
\]

The problem asks for the probability that \(X > 35\) or \(X < 15\), which is equivalent to \(|X - \mu| > 10\). Using Chebyshev's Inequality, we calculate the upper bound on this probability. Setting \(k = 10\), we find:

\[
P(|X - \mu| \geq 10) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2} = \frac{12.5}{10^2} = \frac{12.5}{100} = 0.125
\]

Thus, the upper bound on the probability that the number of heads is greater than 35 or less than 15 is \(0.125\). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: 0.125**
