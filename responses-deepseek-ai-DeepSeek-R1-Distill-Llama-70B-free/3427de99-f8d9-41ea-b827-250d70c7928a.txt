Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the separation of headlights on a car and how that translates to the separation on the retina when the car is a certain distance away. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that the headlights are about 150 cm apart. Wait, that's 1.5 meters. And the car is 30 meters away. So, I guess I need to figure out how this separation looks on the retina. Retina... that's in the eye, right? So this must be about how the image is formed on the retina, probably involving the eye's lens and the image formation.

I remember something about the eye being similar to a camera. When an object is viewed, the lens focuses the light onto the retina. The image formed is real and inverted. But wait, in this case, the car's headlights are two point sources, so they form two point images on the retina. The separation between these two points is what we're after.

So, maybe this is a problem involving the small angle approximation or something with similar triangles. Let me think. The headlights are separated by a certain distance, and the eyes are a certain distance away from the car. The separation on the retina would depend on the angle subtended by the headlights at the eye.

Wait, the formula I remember is something like separation on the retina (let's call it x) divided by the focal length of the eye (f) equals the tangent of the angle theta, which is the angle subtended at the eye by the headlights. So x/f = tan(theta). But maybe I should think in terms of similar triangles.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using the concept of magnification. The separation of the images on the retina would be the magnification times the object separation. Wait, but magnification for a single lens is (image height)/(object height) = (image distance)/(object distance). Hmm, but I'm not sure about the image distance here.

Alternatively, considering the eye as a lens with a certain focal length. The eye's focal length is typically about 2 cm when focused on a distant object, but I'm not sure. Wait, the focal length of the human eye varies depending on accommodation. For something 30 meters away, which is far, the eye would be focused at infinity, so the image would be at the focal point. So the focal length f would be about 2 cm, I think.

Wait, another approach: the separation on the retina (x) would be the actual separation (S) divided by the distance (D) times the focal length (f) of the eye. So x = (S * f) / D.

Wait, that makes sense because when D is large, the image separation is small. So let's plug in the numbers. S is 150 cm, D is 30 meters which is 3000 cm. So S/D is 150 / 3000 = 0.05. If the focal length f is 2 cm, then x = 0.05 * 2 = 0.1 cm, which is 1 mm. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing units.

Wait, another way: using the small angle formula. The angle theta in radians is approximately equal to the opposite side over the adjacent side. So theta ≈ tan(theta) ≈ separation / distance. So theta ≈ 150 cm / 3000 cm = 0.05 radians. Then, on the retina, the image separation x is theta times the focal length. So x = theta * f. If f is 2 cm, then x = 0.05 * 2 cm = 0.1 cm, which is 1 mm. So that would correspond to option C, which is 1 mm.

But wait, let me think again. The formula I remember is that the image height (x) is equal to the object height (h) multiplied by (image distance)/(object distance). But in the case of the eye, when looking at a distant object, the image distance is the focal length because the object is at infinity. So image distance is f, and object distance is D. So x = h * (f / D). Wait, no, actually, magnification m is (image height)/(object height) = -(image distance)/(object distance). Since the image is real and inverted, it's negative, but the magnitude is what matters here.

Wait, the object separation is 150 cm, which is the separation between the headlights. So treating each headlight as a point object, the separation in the image would be the magnification times the object separation. So image separation would be m * S, where m is the magnification. So m = f / D, where D is the object distance. So image separation x = (f/D) * S.

Wait, so f is 2 cm (0.02 m?), D is 30 m. Wait, S is 150 cm, which is 1.5 m. Wait, but units here need to match. Let me convert all to meters.

f = 0.02 m, D = 30 m, S = 1.5 m.

x = (0.02 m / 30 m) * 1.5 m = (0.02 / 30) * 1.5 = (0.000666...) * 1.5 = 0.001 m, which is 1 mm. So same as before, x is 1 mm, option C.

Alternatively, let's think in centimeters. f is 2 cm, D is 3000 cm, S is 150 cm. So x = (2 / 3000) * 150 = (0.000666...) * 150 = 0.1 cm = 1 mm. Yep, same answer.

So the correct answer should be C: 1 mm.

To determine the separation of the images of the headlights on the retina, we can use the concept of magnification in the eye. The separation of the images on the retina (\(x\)) is given by:

\[
x = \left(\frac{f}{D}\right) \cdot S
\]

Where:
- \(f\) is the focal length of the eye (approximately 2 cm for a distant object),
- \(D\) is the distance of the object from the eye (30 meters = 3000 cm),
- \(S\) is the separation of the headlights (150 cm).

Substituting the values:

\[
x = \left(\frac{2}{3000}\right) \cdot 150 = 0.000666 \cdot 150 = 0.1 \, \text{cm} = 1 \, \text{mm}.
\]

Thus, the separation of the images of the headlights on the retina is **1 mm**.
