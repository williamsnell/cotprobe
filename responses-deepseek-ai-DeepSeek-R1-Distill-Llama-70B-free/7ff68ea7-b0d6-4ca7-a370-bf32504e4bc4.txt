Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about Silicon and Germanium. The question is asking what type of elements they are, specifically regarding their valency. Hmm, valency refers to the number of electrons an atom can lose, gain, or share to form a chemical bond. I remember that in the periodic table, elements are arranged into groups based on similar properties, and each group has a specific valency.

Silicon is in the same group as Carbon, right? Let me think. Carbon is in group 14, which used to be group IV. Elements in group IV typically have a valency of 4 because they have four electrons in their outermost shell. Carbon forms four bonds, like in methane (CH4) or diamond where each carbon is bonded to four others.

Germanium is also in group 14, same as Silicon. So if Silicon is tetravalent, Germanium should be too. I think I've heard that Germanium is used in semiconductors, just like Silicon. Semiconductors rely on elements having four valence electrons because they can form a crystal lattice where each atom is covalently bonded to four neighbors.

Wait, are there any exceptions or other possibilities? Let me go through the options. The options are from A to J, each with a different valency. Looking at the options, option B is tetravalent, which sounds right. Let's make sure the other options don't fit. Monovalent is 1, like group 1 metals. Octavalent would be 8, which is rare except for some in the noble gases maybe. Div is 2, like group 2. So yeah, B makes sense here.

Silicon and Germanium are in group 14 of the periodic table, which means they each have four valence electrons. This allows them to form four bonds, making them tetravalent. This property is why they are commonly used in semiconductors, as they can form stable crystal lattices with four covalent bonds. Among the given options, tetravalent (option B) is the correct choice.

Answer: B
