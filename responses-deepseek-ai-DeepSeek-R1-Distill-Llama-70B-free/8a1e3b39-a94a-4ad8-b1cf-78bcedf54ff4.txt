Question:

Explain the TRAILER CARD method of stopping a computer job, i.e., a program.

Options:

A: The Trailer Card method uses a serial number on the first card to stop a program.
B: The Trailer Card method uses a specific phrase typed into the console to signal the end of a job.
C: The Trailer Card method requires a specific card to be inserted physically into the computer.
D: The Trailer Card method involves sending an electronic signal through a network to stop the program.
E: The Trailer Card method employs a magnetic tape marker to indicate the end of a program.
F: The Trailer Card method uses a unique number on the last card in the data section of a program card deck to signal the end of a job.
G: The Trailer Card method utilizes a timer that automatically stops the program after a set duration.
H: The Trailer Card method involves pressing a designated key on the computer's keyboard to terminate the job.
I: The Trailer Card method requires the operator to manually switch off the computer to end the job.
J: The Trailer Card method uses a special code to pause a program.

Okay, so I've got this question about the TRAILER CARD method of stopping a computer job. I'm a bit rusty on some of these older computing techniques, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in the early days of computing, especially with mainframe systems, data was often input using punched cards. Each card represented a line of code or data, and they were processed in sequence. So the concept of a "card deck" comes into play here.

The question is about how the TRAILER CARD method works. I think the trailer card is a specific card placed at the end of the deck. Its purpose is to signal the end of the job. So when the computer reads this trailer card, it knows that there's no more data to process and stops executing the current job.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Talks about a serial number on the first card. That doesn't sound right because the trailer card is at the end, not the beginning.

Option B: A specific phrase typed into the console. I don't think this is it because trailer cards are about physical cards, not console input.

Option C: A specific card inserted physically. This sounds plausible because the trailer card is a physical card in the deck. But I'm not sure if it's just any specific card or if it has a unique identifier.

Option D: Electronic signal through a network. No, trailer cards are part of the card deck, not network signals.

Option E: Magnetic tape marker. That's a different method, probably for tape drives, not cards.

Option F: Unique number on the last card in the data section. Hmm, this sounds right. The trailer card is the last one, and it has a specific number or identifier that signals the end.

Option G: Timer stopping the program. No, that's a different method, like a watchdog timer.

Option H: Pressing a key on the keyboard. Again, that's more of an interactive method, not part of the card processing.

Option I: Manually switching off. That's a drastic measure and not what the trailer card method is about.

Option J: Special code to pause. Pausing is different from stopping, and the trailer is about ending the job.

So, putting it together, the trailer card is the last card in the deck, and it has a unique identifier (like a specific number) that tells the system to stop. So option F seems correct.

The TRAILER CARD method involves using a unique number on the last card in the data section of a program card deck to signal the end of a job. This allows the computer to recognize when there is no more data to process and stop execution accordingly.
