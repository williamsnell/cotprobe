Okay, so I've got this archaeology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about which option is archaeological evidence of social stratification and inequality. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember that social stratification refers to the division of a society into different levels or classes. Archaeological evidence would show that some people had more status, wealth, or power than others. So, I'm thinking about what kinds of artifacts or burial practices would indicate that.

Grave goods are a big indicator. I think when people of higher status die, they're often buried with more valuable or exotic items. Exotic grave goods would suggest that the person had access to resources that others didn't, which points to social inequality.

Also, there's the aspect of physical labor. If someone's bones show signs of more strenuous labor, that might indicate they were from a lower social class, doing manual work. Conversely, less strenuous labor might suggest a higher status, maybe managing others or having more leisure time.

Looking at the options:

Option A says burials with exotic goods have bones showing more strenuous labor. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they have exotic goods, they're probably higher status, so less labor, right? So A seems contradictory.

Option B says all burials have equal exotic goods, but some are more impressive. Hmm, equal amounts but some more impressive? Not sure, but maybe it's about quality vs quantity. But if they have equal amounts, maybe it's not showing inequality.

Option C says burials without exotic goods have more strenuous labor. That could make sense. If they didn't have the goods, they might be lower class, doing more labor. But the question is about evidence of stratification, so maybe this is part of it.

Option D says all burials have same level of labor. That would suggest equality, so not stratification.

Option E talks about segregation based on gender, stature, etc., but I don't think that's directly about stratification in terms of wealth or status. It's more about social roles, maybe, but not necessarily inequality in social classes.

Option F says all have equal non-exotic goods. That sounds like equality, so no stratification.

Option G says exotic goods and less strenuous labor. That makes sense because higher status people might have done less physical work. So G seems like a good candidate.

Option H mentions age and health. Not directly related to social stratification, more about individual differences.

Option I says no exotic goods and less labor. That doesn't fit because if they didn't have goods, maybe they were lower class and did more labor. So I doesn't make sense.

Option J says only exotic goods with no labor indication. Not helpful because we don't know about the labor.

So, putting it together, I think option G is the right answer. Burials with exotic goods (higher status) have less strenuous labor, indicating they didn't do as much physical work, while others without the goods might have done more. This shows a clear social stratification.

The correct answer is G. Burials with exotic grave goods also contain bones indicating that they engaged in less strenuous labor. This suggests social stratification, as those with exotic goods likely held higher status and did less physical labor compared to others without such goods.

Answer: G
